This InstructorΓÇÖs Solution Manual provides solutions (or at least solution sketches) for almost all of the 400 exercises in Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Third Edition). We only give actual code for a few of the programming exercises; writing a lot of code would not be that helpful, if only because we donΓÇÖt know what language you prefer.
In many cases, we give ideas for discussion and follow-up questions, and we try to
explain why we designed each exercise.
There is more supplementary material that we want to offer to the instructor, but we
have decided to do it through the medium of the World Wide Web rather than through a CD or printed InstructorΓÇÖs Manual. The idea is that this solution manual contains the material that must be kept secret from students, but the Web site contains material that can be updated and added to in a more timely fashion. The address for the web site is:
