Here is a quick fact:

Is pure nicotine deadly?
Answer:
60 milligrams (one drop) would kill you instantly. 

The LD/50 (lethal dose) for humans is .9 mg nicotine/ 1 kg of body weight. It would take approx. 45 mg for a 110 lb person or approx. 115 mg for a 285 lb person. Death could be in as little as seconds due to respiratory failure. Very large doses in relation to body weight have been described as near instantaneous."
