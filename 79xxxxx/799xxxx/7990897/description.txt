Not many bands have had such a lengthy and illustrious career as Therion.

Over those years, they have progressed far from the gothically tinged death metal of their elder days in which orchestral arrangements and an operatic symphonic vocal style now dominates.

Then what better way to celebrate this than by releasing a monster of a box set, and I mean a monster.

Spanning over 4 DVDΓÇÖs and featuring a double live cd, Celebrators Of Becoming has everything any Therion hardcore fanatic or anyone curious about the band could possibly want.

The first DVD showcases their show in Mexico, 2004, which is somewhat the clear centrepiece of this release.

Disc 2 displays more of what Therion can do in a live environment and cunningly takes you around the map of the world, giving you a couple of songs from each gig even the little ΓÇÿwithin the band tourΓÇÖ jokes, such as half naked, drunk men with towels on their heads prancing around in what seems to be a dance in respect of the Egyptian gods or maybe just simply dancing whilst intoxicated.

Disc 3, is more entertaining live frolics from the Therion camp, including their whole set at Wacken Open Air and all their music videos and documented studio stuff.
Disc 4 is the disc that will turn any newcomer to Therion into an all knowledgeable fanatic overnight. Featuring an in depth chronological view into old live clips, all the way from their demo stages going right through every release upto the present era in Therion, and of course the mildly entertaining back stage tom foolery is included.
