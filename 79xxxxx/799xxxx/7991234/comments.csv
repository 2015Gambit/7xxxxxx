[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-06T06:56Z,"issue #5 features one of the best ""cover enhancements"" as the publishers liked to call their gimmicks back then. a die-cut cover featuring a character's chest with a gunshot wound -- which ""continued"" entirely through the comic and out the back cover.

blackcanary, sincere respect for hunting these down. old comics never die on TPB."
