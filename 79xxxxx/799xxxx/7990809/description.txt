 This is the above torrent, I have seperated the episodes and named them in proper order,
 with individual titles.  Reasoning is kind of self explanatory;  episodes are now in PROPER
 play order, with titles and each is it's own file (in original .AVI format)
 VirtualDub was used to chop the episodes out of the larger original files.
 Hope you enjoy, and keep on SEEDing.
 Particularly the latter, as of now I have a horrible connection with worse upload.
 If anyone could deal with this long enough to re-SEED I'm sure the community would be thankful.
