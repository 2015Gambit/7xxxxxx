Every Young Man's Battle (Christian Documentary)

Every Young Man's Battle documents the problem of pornography and sexual temptation faced by teenage and young adult males. In this world youΓÇÖre surrounded by sexual images that open the door to temptation. TheyΓÇÖre everywhereΓÇôon TV, billboards, magazines, music, the internetΓÇôand so easy to access that it sometimes feels impossible to escape their clutches. Yet God expects his children to be sexually pure. So how can you survive the relentless battle against temptation? HereΓÇÖs powerful ammunition.

Steve Arterburn and Fred Stoeker, the authors of the hard-hitting best-seller Every ManΓÇÖs Battle, now focus on the temptations young single Christian men like you face every dayΓÇôand they offer workable, biblical strategies for achieving sexual purity.

The authors examine the standard of Ephesians 5:3ΓÇôΓÇ£there must not be even a hint of sexual immoralityΓÇ¥ΓÇôin a positive and sensitive light. And they explain how an authentic, vibrant relationship with Jesus Christ is the key to victory over temptation. Every Young ManΓÇÖs Battle will show you how to train your eyes and your mind, how to clean up your thought life, and how to develop a realistic battle plan for remaining pure in todayΓÇÖs sexually soaked culture. As a result, youΓÇÖll experience hopeΓÇôreal hopeΓÇôfor living a strong, pure life GodΓÇÖs way.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
