In celebration of the 50th year of Jamaican independence on the 6th August, Trojan Records are releasing Freedom Sounds an essential collection of over 100 digitally re-mastered tracks spread across 5 CDs Featuring 50 tracks new to CD, Freedom Sounds highlights many of the most influential Jamaican performers, producers and studios that have influenced popular music across the past five decades.

Alongside such luminaries as Bob Marley and the Wailers, Gregory Isaacs, Desmond Dekker, Beenie Man, Toots & the Maytals, Dennis Brown, Jimmy Cliff, Barrington Levy, John Holt, Chaka Demus & Pliers, Ken Boothe are a multitude of lesser-known performers whose work has often been overlooked in favour of their more widely recognised peers.

In addition, the set highlights the work of many of the island's most important record producers, from early pioneers such as Duke Reid, Leslie Kong and Lindon Pottinger, though to more recent creators, such as Sly & Robbie, Gussie Clarke and Phillip Fatis Burrell. (trojanrecords.com)
