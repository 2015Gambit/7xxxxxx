 Sketch comedy fans will remember the show Almost Live!.
 This is the new show featuring a few of those same people. Here's
 hoping the High-Five'ing White Guys make an appearance or perhaps
 Billy Quan.

 READNFO is because the show started in progress on Shaw Cable in
 Vancouver due to a late to be removed simsub with Global on SNL. We
 asked around on FB and Twitter and apparently not much was missed. We'll
 bitch at Shaw and hopefully it will be fixed for next week."
