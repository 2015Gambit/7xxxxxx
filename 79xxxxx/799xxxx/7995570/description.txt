Surprisingly obscure LP from 1956.....Not in the Accurate Rip database or the

database that titles our rips automatically.....I had to type in the titles.


That's OK..in fact it's a good thing... better than records that have had the

life played out of them.


Johnny Griffin (the little giant) gives proof that he was the fastest tenor in the 

west.
