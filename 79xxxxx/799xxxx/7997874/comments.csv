,Medrev06,2013-01-08T23:28Z,oh nice finally :D your the best 
,viper_12,2013-01-10T12:14Z,"You're the best! Quick question though... Some of these maps are out of print, so I can't buy them. Some of the ones in your upload aren't the best quality scan. If you have the hard-copies of the maps, can we get a little better quality pics so we can reprint our own? "
,elmalvado,2013-01-10T18:49Z,@viper_12 - I don't have access to better quality maps at the moment. Maybe someone will share these files one day.
