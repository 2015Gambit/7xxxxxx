VHS Quality
Picture Quality Good

This torrent is being refreshed for upload as an MKV.  Archivers who have experience using the new tools for MKV files may be able to improve the picture quality.  Mystic Fire Video has never released a dvd of this documentary and so I maintain it as a piece of theater history and as theater as social change.  My notes are original.  The torrent is given because this better copy of the documentary was no longer maintained.  My thanks to the original torrent maker.

  
  Signals Through The Flames documents the Living Theater of Julian Beck and Judith Melina.

  It is the story of political action expressed through experimental theater and is for those archival purposes of theater history and lessons from the movement.

  The original VHS is out of print.  Mystic Fire has not duplicated the film to dvd.

  Please contact them if you think this work is worth preserving for a new generation of theater experimenters.  A few copies of the VHS exist but they are difficult to find.

  This is a new encode in MKV format since the newer format allows more flexibility and new tools to refresh the content.  Theater historians can use this to make a better encode with filters which is simply beyond my capapbility.  


  Julian Beck died in 1985 of stomach cancer.  Judith Melina continues to work
as a director of The Living Theater in New York City.  She has a new production as this is being written and acts in the work presented.  Judith Malina continues this work at the age of 86.

  Living Theater maintains a website with information on new productions:
