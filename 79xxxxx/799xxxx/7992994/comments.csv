Spore asks for registration, ofc not valid.
Expansion fails ingame cause of wrong CD.
Did not receive any dll error message."
,soroxofx,2013-01-10T19:40Z,"Same problem as mlmariss.
I followed the instructions to the dot, didn't install the ea download manger, Used keys provided, etc. Game asks for key evertime I open it up and galactic adventure says I need the spore cd. 

wat do?"
,soroxofx,2013-01-10T19:46Z,"mk, so I just went over your instructions, and it's YOUR instructions that fucked it up. You said to paste the crack in BEFORE patching which means that the patched exe overwrites the cracked exe. For everyone downloading this, You need to put the crack in after patching the game."
,cpt.petobvios,2013-01-10T22:03Z,In my game the creatures in matter of fact everything has no animation they just float around you see life going down but no battle animations any help?
