murphy78 presents Windows 8 Pro x64 Jan2013
This will most likely be the last Windows 8 Pro x64
release that fits on a 4.37GiB Single-Layer DVDR
Future hotfixes will enlarge the setup iso.

No Windows 8 Settings were harmed in the making of this ISO.
No Programs are added to Windows.
No Unattended Settings were added to the installation.
No Registry Settings were modified.

Activate and re-activate with any kms server by typing
the following commands in admin command prompt:
SLMGR -SKMS xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx
SLMGR -ATO

Insert an actual online KMS server there, don't just
type x's. Search web for online kms servers.

--OR--

Use the KMSNano activation program.
LaNanov10.zip contains the release by heldigard.
I have tested this release by running kmsnano.exe
directly from the zip file. I have included pics.
Test did not require volume pre-conversion.
Upgrading from another windows may require conversion.
Read the enclosed text file included with kmsnano
for more information

Reboots system to finish applying the monthly IE security

Use the included Advanced Tokens Manager 3.5b3 to backup your
Activation. Newer versions don't support KMS activation.
For ProWMC users, you can use whatevever version you used
when backing up your original activation.

Do NOT attempt to use ProWMC without having a successful activation
already backed up.  There is currently only one method of activating
it, and it's phone method and data.dat slmgr /ipk swaps.

I'm not going to give the details because they will most likely close
the loophole any day just like they did with the previous swap method.
If you have my previous wmc fix info, you can figure it out I'm sure.

Enjoy Pirates,
