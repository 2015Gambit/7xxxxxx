.NOTES
The Collector's Edition is all in french; the documentary
is originally a french production. The french audio seems to
have a higher and richer audio boost than the english one.
Using the US BD, I added the english track as an external file and
transcribed/merged the english (forced) titles from it into the subs.

I included 4 subtitles:
English - narration subtitles joined with the english forced titles
English (forced titles only) - goes with the english audio
French - narration subtitles
French (locations) - filming locations
