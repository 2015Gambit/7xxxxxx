Queens of the Stone Age is an American rock band from Palm Desert, California, United States, formed in 1997. The band's line-up includes founding member Josh Homme (lead vocals, guitar), alongside longtime members Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, backing vocals), Dave Grohl (drums, percussion), Michael Shuman (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals).
Formed after the dissolution of Homme's previous band, Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age developed a style of riff-oriented, heavy rock music. Their sound has since evolved to incorporate a variety of different styles and influences, including working with ZZ Top member Billy Gibbons and steady contributor Mark Lanegan.
