=================
The plot is simple. A lawyer named Nikki played by Pamela Brumley gets a dinner invitation on the night her husband is going to a ball game with his friends. She believes that the invitation is really from her husband who feels bad about leaving her alone on a Friday night, so she accepts. When she arrives at the resteraunt she finds instead someone she has never seen before, a man, well dressed, who claims to be Jesus Christ. At first she thinks it's a joke and wants to leave, but hey, why give up a free meal? She goes along with his story that he is Jesus Christ and proceeds to ask him questions about everything she can think of from various religions to the creation of the universe. What follows is one of the most interesting conversations put on film.
Let me state that I am not a born again Christian, but when I first saw this film I was glued to the TV, it is a film that makes you think. It is a film that is entertaining, it is a film that is as interesting to those of you who are not religious as to those of you who are.


 
Seed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)

Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
