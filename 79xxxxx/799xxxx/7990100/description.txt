MAX GRAPHICS SETTINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------

From what I can see, the skyΓÇÖs the limit. IΓÇÖve had it running at native 17ΓÇ¥ MBP & even Retina MBP resolutions on Mac without any issues. Make sure you pop up the other render settings as well for best graphics performance. Please mention here any incompatibilities for other peopleΓÇÖs reference.

ISSUES/BUGS/INCOMPATIBILITES
--------------------------------------------------------------

Only issue I ran into when testing it on a multiplayer/singleplayer was that the mouse settings for the 17ΓÇ¥ MacBook Pro I used were completely screwed up. Built-in trackpad & external mouse just didnΓÇÖt want to work as it should, and it was uncontrollable. Had to use keyboard controls instead.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------

Considering this baby just needed a Pentium to run in ΓÇÖ96, I canΓÇÖt imagine there are any problems with running it on an older system. Just for your reference however, itΓÇÖs been tested on both Macs & PCs.  

Windows 7 Ultimate on: 

-	15ΓÇ¥ 2012 Retina MBP (BootCamp) 
-	17ΓÇ¥ Early 2011 MBP (BootCamp)
-	Also on a few PCs at my workplace. ;)  

OS X Native, tested on: 

-	2005 PowerBook G4 1.67GHz 15ΓÇ¥ (OS X 10.5 Leopard)
-	15ΓÇ¥ 2006 Core Duo MacBook Pro 15ΓÇ¥ (OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard)
-	13ΓÇ¥ 2007 MacBook Black (OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard)
-	15ΓÇ¥ 2012 Retina MBP (OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion)
-	17ΓÇ¥ Early 2011 MBP (OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion) 

Works like a dream other than the mouse not working completely correctly on the 17ΓÇ¥ MBP. Not sure why. Works fine on PPC & Intel.

ONLINE PLAY INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------

Very simple to do. All you need to make sure is that you have a port forwarded for your computer (recommend port 42424 as D2 uses this by default). When youΓÇÖve forwarded the port, select ΓÇÿHost GameΓÇÖ in Multiplayer. Obviously make it visible to everybody if you want anyone to join.

If you want to use a different port to forward, go to ΓÇÿAdvanced OptionsΓÇÖ at the bottom of the ΓÇÿHost GameΓÇÖ option before you start the game, and change the port number. Please be aware though that it will ALWAYS default back to 42424 when you start a new game.
