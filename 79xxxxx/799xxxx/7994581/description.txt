About:

This is the loader application that's used by millions of people worldwide, well known for passing Microsoft's WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) and is arguably the safest Windows activation exploit ever created. The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.

Note: You must be running build 7600 or greater for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
Note: I don't recommend using any of the Windows 7 E editions.
Note: Windows 7 N editions will only be supported when OEM SLP serials leak.


Application integrity checking?

Hover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon to see detailed application information.

Note: Even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around the protection system so it's worth checking that the applications path is always the same as the location from which you launched the application. You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.


Virus scanner results

All virus scanner detection's are a false-positive as long as the MD5 matches. Simply turn off your anti-virus while installing the loader.
