,skouras555,2013-01-05T16:46Z,is it worth it if you had GEX or not
,potvinsuks,2013-01-05T18:39Z,"Happy New Year Snakeye!  No, do not use this if you have GEX!  This was actually the first thing I had installed when starting my FSX project.  It was okay but far too much greenage and the textures are a bit FS9 ish.  However, it does cover the whole world opposed to GEX where you have to get individual areas.  Thanks for everyhing Snakeye!"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-01-05T22:50Z,"Correct, it's either this or GEX you should be using.
GEX IMO is much better.
this could be a good solution mainly for FS9"
,skouras555,2013-01-06T01:05Z,thanks for the reply...i'll stick with GEX
