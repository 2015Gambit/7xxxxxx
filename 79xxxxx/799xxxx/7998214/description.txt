John Grisham - The Racketeer [64] Unabridged


Overview
Given the importance of what they do, and the controversies that often surround them, and the violent people they sometimes confront, it is remarkable that in the history of this country only four active federal judges have been murdered.

Judge Raymond Fawcett has just become number five.

Who is the Racketeer? And what does he have to do with the judgeΓÇÖs untimely demise? His name, for the moment, is Malcolm Bannister. Job status? Former attorney. Current residence? The Federal Prison Camp near Frostburg, Maryland.

On paper, MalcolmΓÇÖs situation isnΓÇÖt looking too good these days, but heΓÇÖs got an ace up his sleeve. He knows who killed Judge Fawcett, and he knows why. The judgeΓÇÖs body was found in his remote lakeside cabin. There was no forced entry, no struggle, just two dead bodies: Judge Fawcett and his young secretary. And one large, state-of-the-art, extremely secure safe, opened and emptied.

What was in the safe? The FBI would love to know. And Malcolm Bannister would love to tell them. But everything has a priceΓÇöespecially information as explosive as the sequence of events that led to Judge FawcettΓÇÖs death. And the Racketeer wasnΓÇÖt born yesterday . . .

Nothing is as it seems and everythingΓÇÖs fair game in this wickedly clever new novel from John Grisham, the undisputed master of the legal thriller.

The New York Times
In its early stages [The Racketeer] does follow the familiar Grisham template, in which a lawyer finds himself unexpectedly in legal trouble. But then it breaks out into the exhilarating tale of how Mal, a disbarred attorney, now a savvy, self-taught legal scholar, leads his pursuers on a long, winding chaseΓÇªthis is not a story about a triumph or a miscarriage of courtroom justice. It's the more devious, surprising story of a smart man who gets even smarter once he spends five years honing his skills as a jailhouse lawyerΓÇöand then expertly concocts an ingenious revenge schemeΓÇªMr. Grisham writes with rekindled vigor here. Perhaps that's because he hasn't mired this book in excessive researchΓÇªHe has simplyΓÇªgone back to what he does best, storytelling rather than crusading.
