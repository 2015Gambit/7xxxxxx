A ship sinks in the South Seas. The survivors make it to a remote, uncharted island. There's just one man, but oh so many gorgeous girls! Filmed entirely on location in the South Seas, on an island many have called the most lush on the planet. Like the locale, the action is hot, heavy and sweltering. Surrender in Paradise is more than a classic, it's a throbbing, rollicking adventure.
