This is not a Peter Frampton album.  It is by Nanette Workman and Frampton plays guitar on this CD apparently as a "studio musician".  He does not do any vocals, it is all Nanette Workman.  The cover" art leads you to believe it is a Frampton album: a bit deceiving.  There are still some decent tracks worth listening to for classic rock fans.  You be the judge.
