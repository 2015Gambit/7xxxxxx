,LegoLazze,2013-01-09T11:31Z,"the info on imdb for this movie is none existent.

a quick search with the help of google found me this info about the plot:

""When the heiress of a luxury hotel chain is kidnapped at her dingy motel outside Detroit by a band of ruthless sex traffickers, her downtrodden assistant must figure out a way to rescue her"""
