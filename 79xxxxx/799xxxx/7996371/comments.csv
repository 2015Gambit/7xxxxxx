Why 9 GB?

With my connection it will take until the playoffs start to download this game.

It's because it is uncompressed and 1080i resolution.."
,nikita566,2013-01-08T12:41Z,"Thanks Gondy, for everything.

I just don't have space or bandwidth for that large a file. Most of your files are less than half that amount. I am sure the quality is amazing, but on a PC, not really necessary. Even a 1 GB file would be enough and make me happy. 

Anyway...thanks for all your work!!!!!

I guess I'll have to wait for a smaller version.

Be cool. "
,Dimmis80,2013-01-08T14:24Z,Hey Gondy friend.Are u gonna upload it at 720p with smaller size.??
