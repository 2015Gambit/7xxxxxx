MediaPlayer Classic - Home Cinema v1.6.5.6366

MPC-HC is an extremely light-weight media player for Windows. The player supports all common video and audio file formats available for playback.

Highlights of this release:
Some long standing issues for the Internal Subtitle Renderer/VSFilter have been fixed:
Support UTF-8 subtitles without BOM
Fix high memory usage with complex subtitles (mostly ASS)
Fix most cases where subtitles are not correctly positioned
Allow floating-point values for fscx and fscy in ASS subtitles
Windows 8 is now officially supported and the file association problem has been solved. Windows 8 users should click the ΓÇ£Set Default ProgramsΓÇ¥ button after selecting new formats.
The DVB support has been improved with a better handling of DVB subtitles and a clearer display of the Electronic Program Guide(EPG) information when using live capture.


Enjoyyy!
