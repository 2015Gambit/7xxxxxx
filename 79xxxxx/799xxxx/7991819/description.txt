Doctor Who: Series 6 720p + Subs & including christmas special before the start of the series 5
This is and was my private collection of the doctor who series, next series will the number 7.
All of these files are in minimal 720p quality and have the right subtitles.

Every serie will have it's own torrent, if you like what I am doing (that is sharing, and making doctor who easier to download) then please help me seed the file and download the next torrents of the doctor who series.

Because it is very hard to get doctor who in good quality fast I have collected all the episodes and bunled them with subtitles and the correct filenames and foldernames.
This is one of my first uploads ever, I'll seed it for the upcomming years with my private seedbox and home connection.

Enjoy.
