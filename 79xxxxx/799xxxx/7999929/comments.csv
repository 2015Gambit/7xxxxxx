[V],psspss,2013-01-09T11:15Z,"actually ep2 is out on newsgroups

but not on has added to p2p yet lol

720p though :/ 

I cant grab as no data so perhaps someone will do it for the rest and make a normal size mb"
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2013-01-09T12:14Z,"I thought after Mayan prophesy failed a lot of these nutters would stop . 
Alas they don't  , too many idiots with too much time and money to waste . They spend more time worrying and prepping instead of just enjoying life . What's even more amusing when it's some old cunt in their 70's  spending their last on more food to store away . The food is gonna outlast these lunatics easily . lol"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-09T16:30Z,"@psspss Killers pre'd 720p shortly after it aired then regular scaled down version a few hours later. Dual Survival isn't high priority for TPB.

Besides, the scene hates P2P anyway and you should be thankful 99% of releases actually leak to it.

Thanks K3n. I'm surprised you don't have a skull yet."

[T],k3nd00d,2013-01-09T18:15Z,@steevo .. shut up stupid
[T],k3nd00d,2013-01-09T18:18Z,"@steevo ..  why are you spamming this shit on all of these torrents of this show? If you ever watch the show, none of it was ever about 2012 or Mayan bullshit. Retard. And YOU are a VIP? That is nuts!"
[T],k3nd00d,2013-01-09T18:21Z,@MrUnpopular .. Maybe I have to suck someone off around here or something. Not gonna happen. hahaha
[T],ShoReleases,2013-01-09T21:13Z,"Thanks !
btw i too wonder why u don't have a skull yet... but u'll get it eventually. :)"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-09T21:44Z,"@k3n I could be wrong, but around the time I posted on the Suprbay forums asking to delete a bad torrent of mine I got the skull. Maybe they checked out the uploads and saw I was legit, who knows. Oh well, we know you're legit with or without the skull. Cheers. ^^"
[T],ShoReleases,2013-01-09T22:06Z,@k3n: the forum thing might work. Give it a try :D
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-09T22:39Z,"Yeah, just don't upload a bad torrent to do it. :P Post there in the designated subforum promoting your torrents or something."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2013-01-09T23:12Z,"@ k3nd00d  3 comments is hardly spamming , And my comment was said in jest , so unless you are a doomsday prepper yourself or you made this tv program I can't see why you are so annoyed with my light hearted comment and call me stupid and a retard . And just cause i'm a VIP there is no need to question it . everyone gets skulls for different reasons . 
All the best in the future and i sincerely hope you do get a skull soon . And hopefully you will lighten up a bit . "
[T],k3nd00d,2013-01-10T05:20Z,"Thanks for the info/advice guys. I posted on the forum about my Hillbilly Blood posts. ;)
