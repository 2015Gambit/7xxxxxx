Nate Grey is a survivor.

When the alternate reality he once called home was destroyed, he miraculously escaped certain doom to begin his life anew here on our Earth.

Yes, despite his flight from the Reaper, Nate knows no escape is forever.  For the very powers that granted him a second chance at life--the genetic engineering that was his godlike birthright--now threaten to consume him!

Yes, this "X-Man" is a survivor--but no one lives forever.

Or so it seems...

Enter: ABSYNTHIA--the mysterious woman whose eyes have gazed upon two centuries!  Could the secrets of her prolonged existence be Nate's ultimate salvation?  Is she evidence that Death's icy touch can be denied?

Or is she eternally cursed proof that the price of immortality--the price of survival--is one's own mortal soul...

...and a fate worse than death itself?
