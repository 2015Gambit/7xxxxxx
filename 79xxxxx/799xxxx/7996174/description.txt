For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, in a panic driven stupor I claim:
V=8
A=8
.
I really like this show. Was so disappointed that Lauren Graham wasn't Lorelei Gilmore.
First sitcom brought to a network (WB) by advertisers. Should sound wrong, but doesn't.
And here we have the real Gilmore Girls - they've been behind the scene's the whole time.
She calls herself Michelle Simms now, but same quick wit I've been missing all this time.
And the first three episodes all ended with my mind being blown - yowza!
Amy Sherman-Palladino is the *real* Gilmore Girl(s).
