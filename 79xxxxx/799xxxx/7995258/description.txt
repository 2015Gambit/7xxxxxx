Wicked Tuna Season 1 
Fishing is a hard life, and harder with bluefin stocks depleted. In Gloucester, Massachusetts, there's a special breed of fishermen. For generations they've used rod and reel to catch the elusive bluefin tuna. They depend on these fish for their livelihood, and the competition is brutal.
Over the next 10 weeks, the most skilled fishermen will set out in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic in hopes of catching the valuable bluefin tuna. When one bluefin can bring in as much as $20,000-they'll do whatever it takes to hook up.




2)  Paybacks a Fish 
After going bust on his last trip, Dave Marciano of Hard Merchandise reels in a $10,000 fish. Meanwhile, the Bounty Hunter crew purposely mislead the Tuna.com guys as payback for Dave's fictitious advice that cost them time and money. Bill and Ralph team up for revenge on Dave, convincing him the fish are in a spot they're not. It's payback for the wild goose chase he sent Bill on and the beginning of a pact between old friends.
