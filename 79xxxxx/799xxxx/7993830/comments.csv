The game runs really smooth up to the main menu for me... but I have an issue, when I start a single player game the stage download stops at 80 % every time I try !! and after a few seconds the game crashes !!!
I run it on an 2010 iMac 27'' 
OS 10.8.2, 
3.2 GHz Intel i3, 
4 GB, 
ATI Radeon HD 5670 512 MB "
