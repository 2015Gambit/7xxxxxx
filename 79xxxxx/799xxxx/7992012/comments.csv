Different policies may have been in place when you created this account but we don't allow domain names as usernames at this time.

We can rename this a/c if you wish, to actorschecklist or something else, or (in light of the age) simply leave it in place but locked and you can create a new account.  Let a mod know via IRC what you want to to, or join the forum (link in the footer) and pm me there."
