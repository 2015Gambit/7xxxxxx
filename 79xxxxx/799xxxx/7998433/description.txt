CATIA 5.12, more than a specific application tool is a set of tools that assist engineers in the various stages leading to the design and manufacture of a new product. As an example, we find in CATIA wizards tasks:

ΓÇó Mechanical design of 2D and 3D parts, warped surfaces, assemblies, structures, electronic plates, pipes, wiring ...
ΓÇó Analysis and simulation of mechanical elements: kinematic simulation, structural calculations by the finite element method.
ΓÇó Automatic generation of programs for CNC machining.
ΓÇó Support knowledge management of an engineering design study.
