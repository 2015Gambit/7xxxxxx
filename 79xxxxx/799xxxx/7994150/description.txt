 Several stories unfold at different times: 30 years earlier, a little girl named Audur, daughter of the single mother Kolbrun, is buried; in the present, another little girl, loved by both her parents, dies, and her 31-year-old father, Orm, tries to find out how this genetic disease got into his family; two children find the dead body of a neighbor, old Holberg, attacked in his filthy apartment (filth on the computer and a filthy smell) with an ashtray; and the detective who will put all the pieces together, Erlendur, tries to find a way to save his own pregnant, drug-addicted daughter Eva.
