In 1992, Slapstick made his Marvel debut in a four issue limited series, which guest starred mainstream Marvel characters. Afterwards, he made one other notable appearance, with the New Warriors in Marvel Comics Presents, and was unseen until a Civil War cameo in She-Hulk. He also regularly appeared in Avengers: The Initiative as a recruit.  Slapstick resembles an animated clown and has the abilities of a slapstick cartoon character, such as one from Looney Tunes, including warping reality to match that of an animated cartoon.
