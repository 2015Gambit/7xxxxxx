You do however live up to your newb nick. Ever heard of BootCamp, Crossover, Wine, Parallels Desktop, VMware or GOG? All of them are better choices for old Pc games than getting a virus box. And if you don't expect so much flak or whining then try adding some decent descriptions and system requirements. Specific version numbers wouldn't hurt either. "
