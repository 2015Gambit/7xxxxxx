For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, eyes from beyond and within see:
V=8
A=8

Before the technical gobledegook - I just want to say "talking dead" is better than
this. Talking about the actors is better than listening to them sans script. Jes' sayin'
.
After blowing the seeming triple VG QI, I septuple checked this.
Downloaded the MP4 from UseNet. Downloaded it again from publicHD.
If you download the MP4 version of this, you get a nasty surprise late in the show.
The sound from 30:34 is duplicated @ 37:29, Making the last 6 1/2 minutes useless.
Curiously, the MKV is fine, so I stole that audio for this.
But this is surprising as they are both 2HD. Go figure. Luckily, I spot check.
