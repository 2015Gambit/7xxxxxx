"Credit Where Credit is Due"

When Jimmy and Sabrina decide to buy a new 
car that will be safer for Hope, they 
discover that Jimmy has a rock-bottom credit 
score that dates back to when he was a 
child. Burt and Virginia confess that they 
had maxed out a credit card in Jimmy's name, 
and plead with their bank representative 
Dennis to clear his debt, even if it means 
giving up their new DeLorean.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
