Chronicles of Wormwood is a six-part comic book limited series written by Garth Ennis, drawn by Jacen Burrows, and colored by Andrew Dalhouse. Avatar Press is publishing the title.

Chronicles of Wormwood is the story of a benevolent Antichrist, his best friend Jesus, and a talking rabbit (Jimmy). The story follows God and Satan's attempts to convince Danny Wormwood to begin Armageddon. The series also features an afterlife roadtrip and the Vatican's alliance with the devil. This latter part puts Danny in extreme danger, as the Holy Roman Church knows Danny's weaknesses and is willing to share.
