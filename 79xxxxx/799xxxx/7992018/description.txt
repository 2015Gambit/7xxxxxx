About

Remember the old trick to 'downgrade' Windows 7 Enterprise?? Well, many people still need to downgrade their edition of Windows 8 (don't ask me why ). I posted a manual way a couple of days ago. Then I was thinking to make app to make the job easier & the result is UpDown8. It is a very handy tool to do the job. Just choose the edition you want to upgrade/downgrade offline. Then insert the installation media & do a 'Upgrade' ~ Done!!!
