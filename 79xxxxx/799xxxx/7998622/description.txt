As Don Draper famously said, "Nostalgia: a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone." Nostalgia, of course, also calls to one's appetite. Thanks in part to the popular series Mad Men, fans are discovering the classic cuisine of the 1960's; whether to revisit the favorite recipes of their childhoods or to celebrate the comforting, sometimes kitschy, always-satisfying dishes of the era, including: 


 -Waldorf Salad
 -Sweet and Sour Meatballs
 -Beef Stroganoff
 -Steakhouse Creamed Spinach
 -Buttermilk Dinner Rolls
 -Cherries Jubilee
 -Daiquiri Lime and Gelatin Mold
 -Classic cocktails such as Blue Hawaiians, Brandy Alexanders, and Manhattans
 -And many more!

 Each recipe is adapted for the modern palate, with less fat and healthier ingredients than in the originals (no more bacon fat as a kitchen staple!). Full-color photographs showcase the food, proving that retro cuisine can be sophisticated and delicious. The Sensational Sixties Cookbook will also provide tips on hosting the ultimate sixties soiree, complete with menus, music playlists, and table decorations. So grab a swizzle stick, put Bobby Darin on the turntable, and get cookingΓÇösixties style!
