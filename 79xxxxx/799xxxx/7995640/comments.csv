,lostinmyhope,2013-01-08T05:12Z,Thank you so much for all your true crime shows you've been uploading! You rock. :) Is there any way you can get that show called Married To The Army : Alaska. It comes on the OWN channel. Thanks so much for all your hard work. It is greatly appreciated. :)
,ss9417,2013-01-08T05:18Z,"Not the best video quality, but still watchable.
I would recommend to wait for a better torrent, but if you are desperate it should fit the bill nicely. "
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-08T05:39Z,"There already are better torrents. 2HD (scene) released theirs a minute or two after hours, then it leaked to P2P/TPB a short period later."
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-08T05:39Z,"We haven't got the OWN channel, sorry."
,lostinmyhope,2013-01-08T07:04Z,Thanks anyways  :) Just thought I'd ask! 
,bing52,2013-01-09T02:01Z,Do you have the Hallmark movies Kiss At Pine Lake (2012) and Undercover Bridesmaid (2012)?  Thanks!
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-09T02:14Z,No but we'll try to cap them when they reair.
