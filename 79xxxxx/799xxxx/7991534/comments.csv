[T],MelloYello,2013-01-06T07:24Z,I'm looking for a different copy.  I downloaded one from Mediafire Django.Unchained.2012.DVDSCR.X264.AAC-NoGRP and it goes out of sync after a while by about half a second.  Has anyone watched this copy yet?  Looking for a completely in sync copy.

Great quality and in sync.

MellowYellow: This is a nice copy and in-sync, just watched it."

A/8 V/8
Picture quality is good, not HD, but more than watchable. Better than what you get from cam, that's for sure. Sound is good and in sync. 

M/9 Just a great movie. Tarantino hit another home run with this one."

Quality wise in fantastic A9/V9 defiantly better than the cams out at the moment. Thanks SaM for the upload and the small file size, most are 1-2gb and some are different formats."
,Pat9110,2013-01-07T14:21Z,thanks. a9 v9!
,shawnaldo,2013-01-07T15:14Z,"OK, I watched the whole movie and I'm pretty sure this is a DVD rip from the version they send to Academy Award voters. 

Every once in a while during the movie ""FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION"" will pop up at the bottom. "
