[T],MelloYello,2013-01-06T07:30Z,Is there any sync issues?  I got this from Mediafire Django.Unchained.2012.DVDSCR.X264.AAC-NoGRP.  It's the same as your source.  Just curious if yours is in sync throughout.  Mine isn't I'm just looking for one that is.  Can someone comment that has watched this and let me know.  Thanks alot.

,Slopery,2013-01-07T07:28Z,Sound out of sync.
,michaelrwatson,2013-01-08T09:19Z,"@keeganzo, Ganool: you guys are retards. Why not just export an MP4 (or even an AVI) instead of MKV..?  Then the audio will be in sync!  MKV sux balls. Get a clue."
