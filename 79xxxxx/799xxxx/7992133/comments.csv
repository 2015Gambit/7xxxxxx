I just got a note from Lisa and she told me you had to drop the yoga part of the intensive because of back pain. I'm sooooo sorry!! How disappointing that must be for you!

I hope the meditative part and the practice discussions are going more smoothly. Call me if you want to talk. I'm here!

Love,
Lyn"

********************************************
PLEASE CONTINUE SEEDING after you upload, as much as you can, preferably to a 1.0 ratio. Grab and run downloaders are forcing me to upload to ratios as high as 3.0 before there are enough stable seeds. That means up to two days to upload a torrent before I can start the next one. My upload bandwidth is modest. At this rate it could take another 6 weeks to upload the whole set. By not seeding, you're slowing yourselves down as well as everyone else.
