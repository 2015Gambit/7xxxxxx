  Release Info:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  PortalT2 In MotionT is a DLC campaign for Portal 2 designed by Sixense for 
  use with the high-performance motion tracking of the PlayStationrMove motion 
  controller. Building on the characters and world from Valve's Portal 2, 
  Sixense created Portal 2 In Motion to provide the most intuitive motion 
  control experience ever seen.Players use the PlayStationrMove motion 
  controller to reach, rotate and scale objects in order to solve increasingly 
  challenging puzzles that require creative use of motion. Portal 2 In Motion 
  also adds new depth and possibilities to the familiar tools from Portal 2, 
  requiring the player to fire portals at precise angles and to throw Weighted 
  Storage Cubes with measured force. The light on the PlayStationrMove motion 
  controller changes automatically to correspond to the color of the last 
  portal created (either blue or orange), just like your Aperture Science 
  Handheld Portal Device in the game
