Synopses :

* A bureaucrat in a retro-future world tries to correct an administrative error
and himself becomes an enemy of the state. 

*  Sam Lowry is a harried technocrat in a futuristic society that is needlessly
convoluted and inefficient. He dreams of a life where he can fly away from
technology and overpowering bureaucracy, and spend eternity with the woman
of his dreams.

* The film centres on a man trying to find a woman who appears in his dreams
while he is working in a mind-numbing job and living a life in a small
apartment, set in a dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on
poorly maintained (and rather whimsical) machines.

The film is jam packed with esoteric details, visual jokes and subtext.
Blink and you could miss much of it.
Take the graffiti at Shangrila Towers..
The Ministry of Information [MOI] logo stamped onto everything pilferable on
their premises..
the catalogue numbers spray-stenciled onto the various bits and pieces that
make up the world.
and on, and on...

The film condition is not perfect in many places, but never was.
In various scenes/cuts there is obvious deterioration or 'dirt' on the cell.
This is true of every print I have seen so it's no surprise here.
Overall the video quality is clean with some noise (it was 1985).
The audio is exceptional and particularly enjoyable is the commentary from
Terry Gilliam, a must listen.

This was encoded by me for me.
I'm no expert but I feel it's good enough to be shared.
I hope you enjoy.
