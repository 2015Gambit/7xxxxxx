IMDb Info

Welcome to the Hotel Transylvania, Dracula's lavish five-stake resort, where monsters and
their families can live it up, free to be the monsters they are without humans to bother
them. On one special weekend, Dracula has invited some of the world's most famous
monsters - Frankenstein and his wife, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, a family of
werewolves, and more - to celebrate his daughter Mavis' 118th birthday. For Drac,
catering to all of these legendary monsters is no problem - but his world could
come crashing down when a human stumbles on the hotel for the first time and
takes a shine to Mavis.
