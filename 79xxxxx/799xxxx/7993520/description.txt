 Game Notes 
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 "The Guild 2 - Renaissance" begins in the last day of a dark age when clergy
 and nobility had a stranglehold over all of Europe and the vast wealth of a
 few noble families was obtained through the blood and sweat of the commoners.
 Now however, as the 14th Century draws to an end, the first rays of a shining
 new age appear on the horizon: Common artisans and traders are gaining wealth
 and influence. More and more common people learn how to read and write, and
 the gentry loses many of its privileges. This is the onset of the Renaissance,
 an age of adjustment where common people gain valuable individual freedom,
 and an age where trade, art and artisanry begin to bloom.
 "The Guild 2 - Renaissance" invites the player into a fascinating age of
 societal change. Can you keep up with this challenging new age? 

 This brand-new addon hugely increases both the size and diversity of the game
 world, there are innumerable, often unexpected challenges for the player.
 Nine completely new careers (character classes) allow the player unprecedented
 freedom in creating the ultimate Guild 2 dynasty: Mercenary, undertaker, mason,
 entertainer, innkeeper, banker, miller and the fruit farm proprietor and the
 game also includes a wholly re-worked Title system offering a brand-new
 gameplay element to the player, e.g. in order to reach the next title, youÆll
 need to either supply your King with lansquenet mercenaries, or serve as an
 officer in a war yourself. 

 The vastly improved AI means that enemy dynasties no longer die out easily,
 and the world of "The Guild 2" was made to look and feel much more alive than
 previously. Wild animals roam the game world, and NPC characters such as
 dockworkers, drunkards and beggars add to the game's realistic and detailed
 atmosphere. 

 -New Features-

 New scenarios:
 Additional scenarios set in "The Alps", "Rhineland" and "Transylvania" add 
 detail to the world of "The Guild 2"
 Eight new careers
 The player can decide between nine additional professions and thus decide
 which kinds of character to play.

 Maps expanded:
 The maps are up to four times the size
 of those in the original "The Guild 2"

 War and Peace:
 War keeps breaking out in the new game world, youÆll need to plan your
 tactics accordingly!

 God-Measures:
 Various tasks, such as purchasing a new title or running for an office
 (or forcing someone to marry you), can now be performed without having
 to have the main character present, which will save players lots of time.

 With a plethora of new details such as entirely new buildings, a soundtrack
 especially composed for the add-on, and a completely re-worked judicial
 proceedings system, "The Guild 2 - Renaissance" offers a breathtaking gaming
 experience for Guild noobs and veteran Guild players alike.
