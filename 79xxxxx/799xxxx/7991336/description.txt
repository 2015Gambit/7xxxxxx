You needn't do much research to figure out where Ian Anderson's unusual style

of flute playing came from.  Roland Kirk was vocalizing through his flute

and playing whistles nearly a decade before "TULL."  I like Tull too but flutewise

it had been done before.


Kirk is most remembered for playing several "horns" at once.  The distinction

here is that he made it MUSICAL and could do it with ease in performance.


This guy had attitude.....MINGUS type attitude.  His way with the blues

is so pure and unpredictable.  


These are my favorites from 8 or so CD's......I've left out the track which

includes 10 minutes of silence.........imagine buying a record that contained

a track of mostly silence......KIRK was unique.......we won't see another.
