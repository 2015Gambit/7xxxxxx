,crumrugin,2013-01-07T09:19Z,Its a good copy but the movie is so stylized that suspension of disbelief is impossible..the casting and direction totally sucks as well..remember the original Casino Royale with (gasp) David (woe woe woe ) Niven ??? its like that.. what a waste of a huge budget period production Its a musical without music..you will see for yourself

,zdubinit,2013-01-07T23:49Z,"Thanks for the up.

I haven't watched it yet, but it's got a 7.1 rating (out of 7000+ votes) on IMDB, which is pretty dang good.

Grabbing it because I like Jude Law and Keira Knightley."
