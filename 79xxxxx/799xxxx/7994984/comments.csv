,creative_expansion,2013-01-08T23:37Z,it just bounces on the dock never opens....help?!!!
,keysofanxiety,2013-01-09T01:26Z,"@creative_expansion: Sorry matey, I think I screwed up a little as I didn't zip the application before uploading to TPB â&#x20AC;Ś It does work though, promise! Should've updated the instructions. 

1) Please ensure you've got The 7th Guest in your Applications folder and nowhere else. Does it still not open?
2) As Pazazz mentioned, can you download BatChmod & 'unlock' the file -- does it work now?

Cheers, sorry again for the hassle. I always try to make my torrents as easy as possible so I hope it's not too much trouble.

Thanks for the suggestions as well, Pazazz. "

chmod 755 /Applications/The 7th Guest.app/Contents/MacOS/The 7th Guest"
