In the .rar folder i included a Support and Read me file and a quick how to video on extracting the files, and where to place them to show up in FL.


I Hope You Enjoy This Random Pack of Soundfonts! There From The Web, Different Sites But Mostly Free. If Something Included is Copyright i Apologize, No Harm Intended i Just Downloaded Them and Hold No Responsibility On If you Use Them or Not and for what purpose.



Instructions:

Extract The Rar/Rars File Somewhere. Downloads, Desktop Etc. (Right Click Extract, Or Extract Here.
Once Unpacked, Drag The Folder, or Copy/Paste it To The Install of Image Line Fl Studio. If You Let Fl Studio Install Default it is -
C: Program Files  Image-Line FL StudioDataPatchesPacks

Copy Individually In There or Just The Whole Folder. Open Fl Studio, On The Left "Browser" To Packs and They Will Show up, Then Drag and Drop Them From There onto Your "Step Sequencer".



KEEP IN MIND If you have hidden files enabled on your pc, then 2 versions of the soundfonts will show up. From what I can see, every file that is hidden is 4 kb and will obviously not work. Double check if FL Studio isnt recognizing the files.
