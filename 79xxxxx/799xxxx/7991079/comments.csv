Have a great 2013!
Do you have the NFL wildcard games?"
,geoff777,2013-01-08T10:57Z,"Hi Nepotu,

I've enjoyed the NFL games all season because of your 540p uploads.

Why have you stopped posting the Playoffs?

Please please please my slow connection can't handle the 5Gb downloads from the only other source.

Thanks anyway.

Geoff"
[V],Nepotu,2013-01-08T13:20Z,"Sorry, guyz! Some TPB problems and then some personal problems made me don't be here with my ups. I'll fix this today. Sorry!!!!!!"
,geoff777,2013-01-08T14:40Z,"Thanks Nepotu,

Hope you sorted your problemas out.
If you can upload the Wildcard games that would be so cool, do you know which order they were transmitted so I can avoid seeing the scores on the ticker?"
,jgman191985,2013-01-08T17:07Z,"This is the order of the games

1 IND VS BAL
2 SEA VS WAS
3 CIN VS HOU
4 MIN VS GB"
,jgman191985,2013-01-08T17:26Z,"Thank you so much for all the uploads. this whole season I have been able to watch all of the games thanx to u..

Hope all is well"
,geoff777,2013-01-08T18:44Z,"Thanks jgman.

I'm downloading the Redskins game atm I'll be able to watch it in 2 days at current download rates.

I hope Nepotu can upload the games @540p.
Otherwise the Superbowl will have been played before I watch the wildcards!

Go Redskins!

No spoilers please!"
