The other guy uploading (not this torrent) has his encoded way, way too high for about 70% of the computers out there in the wild.  MKVs in that size won't even play for most users.

Thanks again."

Also, cutting the torrent down to just the heat race highlights and the main event is perfect.  Its like you read my mind!  It will be great not having to set aside 40-60gb to store the 2013 series.  

You are killing it with the Supercross and Dakar torrents.  KILLING IT !!  

Thanks again."

Movies are different, I burn for to playback on a $2500.00 7.1 Polk system. Quality is paramount here.

HD TV shows I don't really need high resolution and or 5.1 AC3

TY tony____"
