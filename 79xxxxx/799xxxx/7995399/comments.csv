2) If it's Japanese and doesn't explicitly say it is uncensored, then don't expect it to be and don't post a comment that it is!  Besides, it ALREADY HAS the Censored tag.  What more do you want?

3) At this time, there is ZERO uncensored and explicit material with either Hitomi Tanaka or Ria Sakuragi (AKA Rikoko / Rin Kajika).  All material is either softcore or hardcore and censored.
