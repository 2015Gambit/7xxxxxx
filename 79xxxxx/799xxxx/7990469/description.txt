REVIEW

Around the same time that Columbia released "The Essential Bob Dylan" in the US, it also released "The Best of Bob Dylan Volume 2" in most overseas markets, a sequel to Volume 1 which was released in 1997.

"The Best of Bob Dylan Volume 2" (17 tracks, 77 min., plus bonus disk) starts off with the 'excuse' that was needed for the release, namely the excellent (and Oscar-winning) "Things Have Changed" from the "Wonder Boys" soundtrack. After that, the remaining 16 tracks provide a chronological overview of Dylan's best known songs not found on Volume 1, and thus form a perfect complement to Volume 1. 
The highlights are many, including "A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall", "I Want You", "Simple Twist of Faith", "Changing of the Guards" (all of which are missing from "The Essential Bob Dylan"), "Hurricane", "Rainy Day Woman", and so on. The audio quality is superb. 
In all, this is an excellent compilation. Highly recomended! (Customer from Amazon)
