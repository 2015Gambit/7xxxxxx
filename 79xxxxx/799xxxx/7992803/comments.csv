,FredMandi,2013-01-08T12:10Z,The second part is not working for me. Already downloaded it twice. Anyone else has the same issue?
,aekiey2,2013-01-08T18:08Z,"Yepp same here woth the second part.

Also, an request to Mr. Slicknick610.

Could you consider to upload like an 480p version of the races? Takes less space, runs smoother and so on!

big up and thanks for all the uploads!"
,Korbendallas,2013-01-09T19:45Z,Thanks! Great quality!
,nathanyoung,2013-01-10T09:17Z,"hey man whats with this mkv stuff, any chance of a new up in mp4 or avi?"
,SC162,2013-01-11T05:53Z,"Please leave it at 720 :) It's much clearer than 480 on a big tv....as for the .mkv, I finaly got it sorted. Anyone having troubles and wanting to watch them on a PS3 (like me), get yourself a copy (it's free) of XMedia Recode. It's really easy and only takes 2-10 minutes to do. You select the .mkv file, set the format and file type to .mp4, click the audio tab, select copy (because it's already aac), then click the video tab, select copy (because the video format is actually already MPEG-4). Then click add job, then encode, then you just have to wait afew minutes. If says it's going to take like 1 and a half hours, you haven't selected copy, and it's going to re-encode the whole thing, which will waste all your time, and probably look like shit aswell, so cancel it and start again....
Keep up the work Slick!"
