PLEASE CONTINUE SEEDING after you upload, as much as you can, preferably to a 1.0 ratio. Grab and run downloaders are forcing me to upload to ratios as high as 3.0 before there are enough stable seeds. That means up to two days to upload a torrent before I can start the next one. My upload bandwidth is modest. At this rate it could take another 6 weeks to upload the whole set. By not seeding, you're slowing yourselves down as well as everyone else.
