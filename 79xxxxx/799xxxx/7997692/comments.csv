Esp on TPB where ""movies"" is all you get to look through, some search keys are needed and much smaller files."

,AmaHist,2013-01-09T06:45Z,"My uTorrent client shows ample seeds for all the torrents in the series. Please post again in 24 hours if you're still having problems. 1955 should be uploaded by then, and I can reseed previous ones for awhile."
,AmaHist,2013-01-09T07:38Z,"On that subject, a question for someone who knows torrents better than I do. When I'm uploading a new torrent, uTorrent lists more than one seeder (me) long before I've finished the initial upload, sometimes when my ratio is as low as 0.30. How is that possible? Is it a glitch? Or something about torrents I don't understand?"
,AmaHist,2013-01-10T06:14Z,"********************************************
PLEASE CONTINUE SEEDING after you upload, as much as you can, preferably to a 1.0 ratio. Grab and run downloaders are forcing me to upload to ratios as high as 3.0 before there are enough stable seeds. That means up to two days to upload a torrent before I can start the next one. My upload bandwidth is modest. At this rate it could take another 6 weeks to upload the whole set. By not seeding, you're slowing yourselves down as well as everyone else.
