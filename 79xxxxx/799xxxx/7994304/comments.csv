Not only could you not properly do your simple addition and division, but you didn't even use the right formula... it should have been:
8 * 3/4 + 2 * 1/4 = 24/4 + 2/4 = 6 + 0.5 = 6.5
By the way, I'm a stupid American."

I don't think I'm some superior specimen, it just pisses me off to be generalized as some low IQ wielding American.

3/4 + 1/4 = 6* OR 3/4 + 1/4 = 5 .. OK I can accept those, depending on the conditions ;)

U told 3/4 = 8 and 1/4 = 2 , then what are we looking at to state/define those values? Just as an example of what you could do from your info : if 3/4 = 8 and 1/4 = 2 , then( using mapping) 2/4 = 4 and 4/4 = 16. According to the mapping : 2,4,8,16, ... -> 1/4 = 2 , 2/4 = 4, 3/4 = 8, ...
Now are we looking for the value of the index of between those two (4) or are we doing something else ? =) Yes now it cam up another value adding to the plausible answers: 4, 5 or 6* ? You could probably come upwith an arbritrary system and get another value to ;)"

@Chased911
OK but of course I think if 1/4x = has density 2 and 3/4y = has density 8 then geometric mean has to be done : sqrt(x*y) = 4. If we are talking about reviewing a movie such as this seems to be : then if first 1/4 of the movie is scoring 2 ( density 2) and the rest 3/4 is scoring 8 (density 8) then the actual score of the entire movie should be according to reasoning of average density ( geometric mean) sqrt(2*8) = sqrt(16) = 4 , so if any of you guys were reasoning such as ""the first1/4 of the movie scored 2 and the rest 8"" then the average score of the whole movie is 4, and not 5 or 6,5 or whatever else ( because of the way you score the movie)."

,Chased911,2013-01-11T07:34Z,"@ apalaxian: Are you serious man? Geometric mean, density, average density, reasoning of average density ... what's next? black holes, relativity and dead stars???

Fuck me man, LOL! Get a life you nerd."
,Maurosso,2013-01-11T17:19Z,"I would like to end you average dispute...What was originally done...was a weighted average. Look it up on wiki or smth...

3/4*8=0.75*8=6
1/4*2=0.25*2=0.5

Because the sum of the weights (0.75 and 0.25) add up you one...you don't divide by anything...the overall film average is: 6 + 0.5 = 6.5
