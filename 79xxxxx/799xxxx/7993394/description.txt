SASΓäó (SAS Institute, 2009) is a statistical software package used in many ∩¼üelds
of research. We have written this book as a reference text for users of SAS. Our
primary goal is to provide users with an easy way to learn how to perform an
analytic task, without having to navigate through the extensive, idiosyncratic,
and sometimes unwieldy documentation provided. We include many common
tasks, including data management, descriptive summaries, inferential proce-
dures, regression analysis, multivariate methods, and the creation of graphics.
We also show a small sample of the many more complex applications available.
In toto, we hope that the text will serve as a brief summary of the features of
SAS most often used by statistical analysts.
We do not attempt to exhaustively detail all possible ways available to
accomplish a given task. Neither do we claim to provide the most elegant so-
lution. We have tried to provide a simple approach that is easy for a new user
to understand, and have supplied several solutions when this seems likely to be
helpful.
