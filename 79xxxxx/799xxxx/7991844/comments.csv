V/7

I found the picture a little jumpy with a slight blur in some parts. It's still really good and for the most part clear and so definitely worth a look until something better comes along.

As for the audio, pretty disappointed that their was no mention of the spoken language in the info, it's almost completely Chinese and if i knew i wouldn't have downloaded. Not bagging the uploader though because for all i know the Chinese speaking version is the only one that will be released. Still, my ignorance aside, if the language was mentioned as i said i wouldn't have downloaded. Also, as mentioned, hard-coded English/Chinese subs.

Cheers again tykoon123
