My audio fucks up at 37:28. Comes back from commercial break and audio reverts back to earlier in the program. The last 8min of the show the audio is only that."

The good news is that while 2HD did both MP4 & MKV, they only screwed up the MP4.

The MKV audio is just fine.

It only takes a minute to spot check these things, ya know.

I just had to know, so I checked then I checked and then I checked again.
Here's the two-part rule for S03E00:

If it's MKV, it's error free - both of them.
If it's AVI, it's error free - both of them."
