A group of fringe astronomers have discovered Vesta, an asteroid the size of Arizona, which has fallen out of its orbit. Vesta is rocketing toward Earth at 200,000 mph with a scheduled impact date of 12/21/12. Scientists say it will create the equivalent of a 15.2 earthquake, and that life as we know it will end. What would you do? Wicked Pictures and award winning director Brad Armstrong bring you The Countdown. This touching, passionate film is a must see for those who like great story-based adult drama. A brilliant cast gives the performances of their career, as they portray a diverse cross section of ordinary people in extraordinary times. The Mayan calendar ends on December 21, 2012 and The Countdown has begun... what will you do when the big bang comes?
