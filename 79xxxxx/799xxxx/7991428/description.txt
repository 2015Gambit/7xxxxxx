Chips (Potechi) 2012 DVDRip x264 AAC [5.1]-BeLLBoY



Movie information

Directed by: Yoshihiro Nakamura 
Plot: A brainteaser about the uncanny connections between a burglar and the baseball player he fanatically cheers, "Potechi" is as mathematical and diverting as a Rubik's cube. In his fourth film adapted from a Kotaro Isaka mystery novel, Yoshihiro Nakamura ("Golden Slumber," "Fish Story") lays out the writer's intricate plot with clarity and delightfully offhand irony. Production may be pint-sized, but this seemingly trivial yarn, enriched by its setting in post-tsunami Sendai, actually ponders huge questions about fate and coincidence.
