Installer is quite professional: It has the choice of English and Russian language so no having to guess with crazy characters; all the redists are there for those who need them. You can install 1 or both of the games: each one took about 15 mins on my rig. Only small downside is the repetitive music but hey, just turn down ur speakers. In case it's not clear the games are K & L Dead Men, K & L Dog Days. Probably has reduced video quality in the cutscenes but still looks ok on 20in monitor; np for me cos gameplay is much more important & cutscenes only need to show u the thread of the story. All in all this is great; thanks a lot NZupload; greatly appreciated; this saves dl'ing 14 gig for the games separately."
