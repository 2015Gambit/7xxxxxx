In 1954 we designated mescaline, lysergic acid diethylamide, and
adrenochrome as hallucinogens. The only other substances which we
classed as hallucinogens were the active principals from marijuana,
harmala alkaloids, and ibogain, not at that time identified chemically
for certain. In the past decade so many additional hallucinogens have
been discovered, studied, and described and so many new publications
have appeared that this may be the last time it will be possible to give a
detailed description of the hallucinogens in a single volume. Within
another five to ten years each hallucinogen may well require its own
monograph.
