,JarjarTwink,2013-01-05T22:15Z,"VLC sucks for MKV, i use Media player classic. "

It's so easy to use too. "

My favorite movie of the year. Go see it in theaters if you haven't already."
,nbmatt,2013-01-06T01:30Z,Why do so many people bitch about MKV containers? Stop being fucking stupid.
,pjatgv,2013-01-06T01:40Z,@JK425 VLC is crap compared to gom player just see for urself... you talk vlc is good but you didn't even bother to try other players.... vlc is primitive.... throw that shit to the garbage...
,soup2012,2013-01-06T01:58Z,awesome upload! thanks alot! great copy!
,steven4,2013-01-06T02:05Z,thanx tykoon  a lot  and all uploadres  rishman..
,northodox,2013-01-06T02:29Z,"Anyone who doesn't like MKV files can easily convert the file into a preferred format with 'Any Video Converter' (also useful for other conversions and even downloading from url's) I usually leave videos from PBay as MKV's when I come across them... but I use the software mentioned for other necessary conversions.

I'm not a d'ler of this torrent [yet] but I extend my ""Thanks"" anyway to the uploader for the effort involved.  Maybe some other time...

Peace"
,moshster,2013-01-06T02:39Z,"Yes, of course, the most flexible and extensible of all the container formats is stupid? Container formats are not stupid, but people who can't figure out how to make use of them clearly are."
,smknjoker,2013-01-06T03:06Z,"@tarims7

Hey I found a even BETTER copy at www.SuckMyBallsYouHairyCuntMuffin.GTFO

@Tykoon

Thanks for the upload!"
,Pseudoplaydo,2013-01-06T03:06Z,"i'm so fucking sick of hearing ""seed you fuckers"". If look at the time stamps, the same people are bitching almost immediately after its been posted. Give people a chance to fucking download it before screaming about seeders. Just because your hitting the refresh button on piratebay waiting for something to watch doesn't mean everyone else is. Chill the fuck out."
,nineonesicks,2013-01-06T03:18Z,"I'm connected to 9 seeds out of 3000, you guys are real classy.

thanks tykoon"

,jmandryk,2013-01-06T03:44Z,mkv files give alot of people issues.. google mkv and you gets thousands of known issues.. but thanks for the upload.. couldn't watch it since the mkv through real player was stuttering so bad but the mp4 i turned it into played flawlessly in vlc. 
,sphinxsix,2013-01-06T10:27Z,"People complaining about MKV or MP4 don't know a shit. They simply can't find a player which plays these formats properly and that shouldn't be a problem for a 6 years old kid! MKV and MP4 offer better quality than similiar size DIVX file so don't complain morrons, just learn to Google!"
,JK425,2013-01-08T21:20Z,I have never had a problem with mkv files you are all fucking retards

,spidey66,2013-01-11T09:30Z,"Thanks for the upload, tykoon. Some of the comments made me wary but I got no problem.

I left the DL to sleep so no idea how long it took but no more than 5 hours -- v. good for my turtle like connection. No complaint re A/V."
