Ep 6: You Took An Ambien
 The Shahs head to Cabo, leaving behind GG but bringing plenty of other drama along.
 PREMIERE: Sunday January 6, 10 pm

The friends decide to take a long weekend in Cabo, but Reza and Asa refuse to go with GG, so the group must make a tough call. GG decides to make the best of being cut out of the vacation by digging in and taking over the launch party for her extensions line, hoping to prove to her sister that she has what it takes to be a real business woman. Lilly and MJ bristle at being forced together by the rest of the gang, and tempers flare when Asa blurts out loud what everyone in the group has been wondering.
