Debuger 17 is out! Andreja Z goes tribal this time, chanting voices, percussions and smooth bassline is what makes this track so contagious. DJ GrujA goes into another direction by using some jazzy brass samples, followed by multiple percussion elements. If you like tribal and melodic tech-house, you will love this release.


Please if you spin this tracks chart it and help us that way.
Kind Regards, DEBUGER team.
