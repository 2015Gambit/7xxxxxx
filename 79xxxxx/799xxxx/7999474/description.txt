EMPLOYMENT
Assassination is an extreme measure not normally used in clandestineoperations. It should be assumed that it will never be ordered or authorized byany U.S. Headquarters, though the latter may in rare instances agree to itsexecution by members of an associated foreign service. This reticence ispartly due to the necessity for committing communications to paper. Noassassination instructions should ever be written or recorded. Consequently,the decision to employ this technique must nearly always be reached in thefield, at the area where the act will take place. Decision and instructionsshould be confined to an absolute minimum of persons. Ideally, only oneperson will be involved. No report may be made, but usually the act will beproperly covered by normal news services, whose output is available to allconcerned.

Killing a political leader whose burgeoningcareer is a clear and present danger to the cause of freedom may be heldnecessary.But assassination can seldom be employed with a clear conscience. Personswho are morally squeamish should not attempt it

A humanbeing may be killed in many ways but sureness is often overlooked by thosewho may be emotionally unstrung by the seriousness of this act they intend tocommit. The specific technique employed will depend upon a large number ofvariables, but should be constant in one point: Death must be absolutelycertain. The attempt on Hitler's life failed because the conspiracy did not givethis matter proper attention.Techniques may be considered as follows:
