Notes on the dvd release transcribed from container:

Years of police work have taught Detective Finlay that where there's crime, there's motive.  But he finds no usual motive when investigating the beating death of a man.  The man was killed because he was a Jew.  "Hate,:  Finlay says, "Is like a gun."

Robert Young portrays Finlay, Robert Mitchum is a laconic army sergeant assisting in the investigation of GI suspects and Robert Ryan plays a vicious bigot in a landmark film noir nominated for five Academy Awards.  Including Best Picture.  Edward Dymytryk (Murder My Sweet) directs, draping the genre's stylistic backdrops and flourishes around a topic rarely before explored in films: anti Semitism in the U.S.  Here, Hollywood took aim at injustiuce... and caught bigotry in a "Crossfire."

This torrent also includes the Featurette on the film called "Hate is like a gun."

The featurette notes that Robert Ryan who portrays the bigot in this film was one of the most tolerant men in Hollywood.  His last performance was in "The Iceman Cometh" by Eugene O'Neill for the American Film Theater which is also available on torrents.
