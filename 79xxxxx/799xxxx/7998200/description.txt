Encoder's notes: 

  I found the audio from the DVDSCR to be on the dull side--it lacked amplitude, bass, and the voices were a bit muffled. Thankfully, TiCKLE-TiME released earlier today their encode with a brilliant sync of the audio from the DVDSCR to the R5 (23.976 to 25.000 fps) so I grabbed it and concentrated on editing the audio. I exported TiCKLE-TiME's audio track to a WAV file for its optimal subsequent editing with Audacity and Mixcraft. I have added both Acoustica and VSF effects, increased the amplitude by 1.5 to 2 decibels, using equalizer and testing different settings so as to avoid audio clipping. Finally, I have edited out 4,200 seconds from the movie intro (from 00:00:11:000 to 00:00:15.200) because it was a a repeat. 

  All this audio remaster took me a long time but I think it was worth the effort. Compare the video sample included in my torrent with samples from other releases and see for yourself.        

  I recommend MPC-HC to view all AVC/H264 content, if possible, with CoreAVC Pro enabled for smoother playback. This encode has been tested on MPC-HC 1.6.0. build 4014, The KM Player 2.9.4. build 1436, VLC 1.1.9 The Luggage, and Winamp 5.6.2. build 3199. If you experience playback issues, it's a problem at your end due to your poor choice in media player, settings or codecs.
