CIA ARTICHOKE FILES
"Manchurian Candidate" ARTICHOKE CIA Files - ARTICHOKE was the CIA'S cryptonym for the study and/or use of special interrogation methods that have been known to included hypnosis, drugs and total isolation. It grew out of the Agency's Operation BLACKBIRD and was a forerunner to the Agency's MKULTRA. 





Project ARTICHOKE also known as Operation ARTICHOKE was run by the CIA's 
Office of Scientific Intelligence. The project went deeper into 
interrogation methods studied in the CIA's Project BLUEBIRD. ARTICHOKE 
offensive mind control techniques experiments attempted to induce amnesia 
and highly suggestive states in its subjects. ARTICHOKE focused on the 
use of hypnosis, forced morphine addiction, forced morphine addiction 
withdrawal, along with other drugs, chemicals, and techniques.
The main focus of the program was summarized in a January 1952 CIA memo, 
"Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our 
bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, 
such as self-preservation?"
One program experiment attempted to see if it was possible to produce a 
"Manchurian Candidate." In Richard CondonΓÇÖs 1959 novel "The Manchurian 
Candidate" an American soldier, who has been placed into a hypnotic state 
by Communist forces, returns home to assassinate on command. Five years 
earlier the CIA considered the possibility. A January 1954 CIA report
asks the question, ΓÇ£Can an individual of [redacted] descent be made to 
perform an act of attempted assassination involuntarily under the 
influence of ARTICHOKE?ΓÇ¥
