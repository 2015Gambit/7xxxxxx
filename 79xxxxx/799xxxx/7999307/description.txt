Use the included Advanced Tokens Manager 3.5b3 to backup your
Activation. Newer versions don't support KMS activation.
For ProWMC users, you can use whatevever version you used
when backing up your original activation.

Do NOT attempt to use ProWMC without having a successful activation
already backed up.  There is currently only one method of activating
it, and it's phone method and data.dat slmgr /ipk swaps.

I'm not going to give the details because they will most likely close
the loophole any day just like they did with the previous swap method.
If you have my previous wmc fix info, you can figure it out I'm sure.

Enjoy Pirates,
