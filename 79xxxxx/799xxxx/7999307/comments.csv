This requires netfx2, but it's still less of a pain in the rear than seeding an entire dvd.  I have chosen this method even though adding the prowmc index to the install.wim is far more efficient, because it literally would not fit without exceeding the 4.37GiB mark for x64 and I wanted the releases for x86 and x64 to match.

Next month it will go over the mark either way, so I will just include them both on the same dvd. It increases the size, but not very much."

[T],murphy78,2013-01-11T06:30Z,"akiyani sorry this does not have net 2-3.5.1.  In the past there was an update that would not register correctly and was very large.  The last couple of months the net2-3.5.1 would make the x64 version too large to fit on a 4.37GiB dvdr, and I always make both the x86 and x64 versions using the same methodology.

If they fixed the update I could not get working, I will have net2-3.5.1 returning next month since the x64 is going to exceed the 4.37GiB mark anyway.  Keep in mind that it still depends on whether or not they fixed the missing kb files to bring it up to date.  I'm not going to add a feature to Windows if MS knows that there is a problem with it, and I cannot patch the problem."
