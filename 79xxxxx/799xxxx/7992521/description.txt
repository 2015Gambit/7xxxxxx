Information
------------------------------

While the world knows of the KGB spies and agents who crossed over to the West, few know of this tale of secret dissention from within. There is one officer, Viktor Orekhov, who went from repression of dissidents to joining their cause.

After months and months of searching, the filmmaker tracked down Orekhov and now brings his story to the world.

Illustrated with the unique testimonies of Viktor Orekhov, now 65, archives and accurately re-enacted sequences, the documentary tells the story of a man who braved an impenetrable system and dared to challenge the KGB.
