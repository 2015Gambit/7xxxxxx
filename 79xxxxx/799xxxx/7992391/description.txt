For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, the sirens corner me into:
V=8
A=8
.
Every episode of S24 was XVID / AVI - except this, the very last one.
AFG seems to have just started - with a 422MB file for a 22min show.
So, just to fill out imaginary collections, I fix a hole where the rain gets in.
It stops my mind from wandering ... where it will go ...
