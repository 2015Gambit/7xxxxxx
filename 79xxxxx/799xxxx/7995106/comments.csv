V - 9
M - Fucking 11!

And whatever, Heisenberg, there's nothing wrong with the audio. It's not a bluray, but for a DVDSCR it's top notch. Volume is fine, it's in sync. What were you expecting, Dolby 5.1? 

As for the rest of you, go buy this fucking movie when it comes out because it's worth owning. "
