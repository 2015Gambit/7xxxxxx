                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two soldiers of fortune, Harry Grigsby and Kip Thompson, used to be the best of 
friends when they fought side by side in the Congo. But now Kip has changed 
sides and Grigsby does not forgive him for what he regards as a betrayal, all 
the more as Thompson now turns his guns against Grigsby's troops and, 
accordingly, against his former friend. While he is London recovering from 
tuberculosis, Rigby is assigned a new mission that he gladly accepts: to 
eliminate Thompson, now in Hong Kong causing tensions with neighboring China by 
creating border incidents...

This movie is somewhat of a rarity.  Haven't seen it posted before.  The quality 
of this is quite good.  I'd give it an A-10 V-9 only because of the occasional 
video blemish.

The story itself is not too bad, but the actual combat scenes were used 
sparingly.  The human drama/love triangle really didn;t do it for me, and I 
guess not for the audience either, since this remined relatively obscure since 
1969/1970 when it was produced.

Enjoy!
