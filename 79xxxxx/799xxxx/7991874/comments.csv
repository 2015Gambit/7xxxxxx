If this version is only comprehensible by Italians could someone please PLEASE upload an English version... its gotta be out there somewhere, right? "

Pure speculation, of course. :)"

,dudes1997,2013-01-10T12:47Z,this is just the first 5 minutes of the movie on a loop for 2 hours.
,IdaTarbell,2013-01-11T08:18Z,"We want the real Master.  Give us one with english subs.  H'wood is turning up its nose because the filmmakers budgeted it so high, this tiny movie can't even come close to making back its nut.  So why cann't the producers do the right thing like Bigelow did a few years ago and flood the net with subtitled screeners, because this movie is truly great?"

First few minutes in a loop.
FAKE."
