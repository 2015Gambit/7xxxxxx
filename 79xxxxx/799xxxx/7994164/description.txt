New Order release their long-awaited mini-album Lost Sirens on January 14 via Rhino/Warner.
 The release collects previously unreleased tracks recorded for 2005's Waiting for the Sirens' Call.
 It features an unreleased mix of the Waiting for the Sirens' Call track "I Told You So"as well as an ext- ended version of "Hellbent", which was previously released on the 2011 compilation Total: From Joy Division to New Order, among other tracks.
 The eight-track album was written, produced and recorded by all band members Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris and Philip Cunningham.
 "Lost Sirens? Well, it's not really lost," drummer Stephen Morris said in a statement. "I remember that Martin Hannett once had an idea of making a record and burying it in his garden, so that one day someone would dig it up, like a time capsule. We just stuck our record in a cupboard. And now we've got it out".
 
"When we did the first one ['Waiting For The Sirens Call'] we had 20 ideas for songs - we were going through a particularly prolific phase - but we couldn't make a double concept album out of them all, so we thought we'd just do two instead," he added.
 
He continued: "The intention was always to write four or five more songs and then put it out 18 months or so after the first one. When we unearthed it from the cupboard recently, with the intention of re-editing some of the songs, we all agreed they didn't actually need it, and it should just be out there. So here it is".
