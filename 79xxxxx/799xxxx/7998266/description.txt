
Two centuries ago, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm published the first volume of ChildrenΓÇÖs and Household Tales. Now Philip Pullman, one of the most accomplished authors of our time, makes us fall in love all over again with the immortal tales of the Brothers Grimm.
 
Pullman retells his fifty favorites, from much-loved stories like ΓÇ£CinderellaΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Rumpelstiltskin,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£RapunzelΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Hansel and GretelΓÇ¥ to lesser-known treasures like ΓÇ£The Three Snake Leaves," "Godfather Death" and "The Girl with No Hands." At  the end of each tale he offers a brief personal commentary, opening a window on the sources of the tales, the various forms they've taken over the centuries and their everlasting appeal.
 
Suffused with romance and villainy, danger and wit, the Grimms' fairy tales have inspired Pullman's unique creative visionΓÇöand his beguiling retellings will draw you back into a world that has long cast a spell on the Western imagination.
