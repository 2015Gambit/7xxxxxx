After portraying a terminally ill patient in ΓÇÿMy life without meΓÇÖ, actress Sarah Polley reunites with Isabel Coixet for the Catalan directorΓÇÖs second English language film called ΓÇÿLa vida secreta de las palabrasΓÇÖ (The secret life of words). Polley plays Hanna, a complex foreign woman with a dark past who breaks away from her established routine when on a whim she decides to pass a few weeks on an oil rig as a nurse to Josef (Tim Robbins), who was badly burnt in a fire on the rig and who cannot be moved because of his injuries.The acquaintance and developing relationship between the nurse Hanna, who is deaf and needs a hearing aid, and the temporarily blind Josef is at the heart of the film. Josef is confined to his room as Hanna is confined to the rig, which has been partially shut down after the accident. Both have secrets they are trying to hide; Hanna by not talking and Josef by talking too much. In the perceptive script written the director, the film explores both characters with an insight in human nature that ΓÇÿMy life without meΓÇÖ sorely lacked; as a character study of two damaged people it works perfectly and the revelations of the latter half of the film cunningly enlarge the themes of words spoken and unspoken to include not only the history of the two protagonists, but more generally the history of the world and the way in which humankind can easily forget or conceal events that should be remembered.
