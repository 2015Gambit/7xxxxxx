   Delhi Safari is the story of a journey     
   undertaken by a cub leopard, his mother,   
   a monkey, a bear and a parrot when the     
   forest they live in is on the verge of     
   destruction. A man is on the run to        
   destroy the forest in order to erect a     
   balcony. These five animals plan to go     
   to Delhi and ask the parliament some very  
   simple yet pertinent questions - why has   
   man become the most dangerous animal?      
   Doesn't man understand that if the         
   forests and the animals don't exist, man   
   will cease to exist?
