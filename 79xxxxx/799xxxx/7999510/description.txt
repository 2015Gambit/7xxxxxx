Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Tuesday, January 8 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers his appearance on CNN's Piers Morgan show last night and his effort to defend the Constitution and the Second Amendment from attack by the establishment media as the government prepares its latest gun-grabbing assault on law-abiding Americans. 

Alex talks about how CNN ejected him from the studio after one segment and how an "armed Mafia" tailed him during his New York visit. 

Alex talks about the overwhelming response to his appearance and the fact we have put the globalists on notice.
