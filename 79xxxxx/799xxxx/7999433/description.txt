Killadelphia is a 2005 live DVD from US metal band Lamb of God, released on Epic Records and shot and directed by Doug Spangenberg. It consists of footage filmed during the band's two gigs at the Trocadero Theatre in Philadelphia on October 16 and 17 of 2004, hence the pun title of the DVD. In addition to the concert footage lasting more than 70 minutes, Killadelphia includes over 2 hours of behind-the-scenes footage recorded throughout the Ashes of the Wake Tour - also included are three music videos, including the uncensored version of "Now You've Got Something To Die For" and a demo version of "Laid To Rest".
