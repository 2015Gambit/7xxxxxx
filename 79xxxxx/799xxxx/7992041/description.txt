Preface:

Effective graphics are indispensable for modern statistical analysis. They reveal patterns, differ-
ences, and uncertainty that are not readily apparent in tabular output. Graphics provoke questions
that stimulate deeper investigation, and they add visual clarity and rich content to reports and
presentations.
There are three major ways in which you can use statistical graphics:
∩┐┐ Exploring your data. Many statistical analyses are begun by producing simple graphs of data
such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.
∩┐┐ Analyzing your data. Graphical results are an integral part of the results of modern statistical
analyses.
∩┐┐ Presenting your data. The ∩¼ünal results of statistical analyses are often presented with graphs.
Presentation graphics might be the same as the graphical results of analyses or they might be
customized in various ways.
The SAS System provides many tools for creating statistical graphics. In many cases, multiple tools
can be used to make a graph.
∩┐┐ Automatically created graphs. With SAS 9.2, statistical graphs are created with an extension
of the Output Delivery System (ODS). ODS manages procedure output and lets you display it
in a variety of destinations, such as HTML and RTF. With ODS Statistical Graphics (or ODS
Graphics for short), statistical procedures produce graphs as automatically as they produce
tables, and graphs are integrated with tables in the ODS output. You only need to enable ODS
Graphics with the ods graphics on statement to get default graphical output. Some graphs
require you to additionally specify one or more simple options.
∩┐┐ SG Procedures. The SG (Statistical Graphics) procedures SGPLOT, SGSCATTER, and
SGPANEL provide a simple and convenient syntax for producing many types of statistical
graphs. They are particularly convenient for exploring and presenting data.
∩┐┐ The GTL. The GTL (Graph Template Language) and PROC SGRENDER provide a powerful
syntax for creating custom graphs. You can also modify the templates that SAS provides for
use with SAS/STAT procedures to create customized results.
