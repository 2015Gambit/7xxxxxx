Certain branches of the gov are monitoring a few specific torrent uploads of mine.  Probably because of the nature of the torrents.   This is what I have to say about that.

I am simply exercising my freedom of speech.  

This all belongs in the public domain.  I found all these files and learned from these books because of my governments report they did in 1997.  So here is the pdf. 


1997 REPORT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF BOMBMAKING INFORMATION

    star rule

    PREPARED BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
    AS REQUIRED BY SECTION 709(a) IF THE
    ANTITERRORISM AND EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT OF 1996

    SUBMITTED TO:

    THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
    AND THE UNITED STATES SENATE

    APRIL 1997



So thanks guys for all your help, now get the fuck off my torrents and go eat a dick Jgov and DoD.   The valuable information you have so graciously shared with the world is your own fault.  I will just help to make it easier for people to access because most do not know where to look.
