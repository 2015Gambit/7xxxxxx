                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Documentary following the life of pensioner Clwyd Davies, who dedicates his 
 every waking moment to caring for 52 untamed horses that he has collected and in 
 some cases bred. Squatting in a derelict farmhouse in Wrexham without heating, 
 electricity or warm water, he lives an isolated existence, but he's struck up a 
 friendship with 44-year-old Michelle Crowther, who runs a livery stables and has 
 recognised that Clwyd is struggling to care for the animals as well as himself.
                                                                 
                                 Enjoy!
