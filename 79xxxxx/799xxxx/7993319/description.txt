
IΓÇÖve downloaded and found almost everything in this 1st pack. I donΓÇÖt take credit for production, just organizing and uploading this drum pack. ItΓÇÖs full of many different kicks, a lot of different styles. I havenΓÇÖt listened to every sound, but thereΓÇÖs a lot of quality samples. Enough to last awhile. Im aiming for over 1000 sounds on every drum/soundpack! 



Support:
To get here, you had to download the file and extract the .Rar contents. Now if to use the sounds. You want to drag the samples to:
C: > Program Files > ImageLine > FL Studio > Data > Patches > Packs. 
Even if they donΓÇÖt go there, in FL Studio you can still see other folders from the library. Even add your own folders that FL will show so itΓÇÖs easier to drag content into! Like your music folder if you sample a lot. Helpful just look at the options.


Please leave a comment letting people know the torrent is safe. Small pack but sharing is caring! seed where you can. Thanks.
