X3 Albion Prelude (Mac App Store)

Intel compatible only. 

Bought by myself from the Mac App Store. Any problems you have, please moan to the developers, not me. HavenΓÇÖt made any modifications to the program as it is.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------

Extract the app from the .zip file. 

Copy file to Applications folder and run it. 

Bit slow, even on 650M w/16GB RAM, so you may have to pop down the graphics settings if youΓÇÖre encountering brief issues with a few seconds of freezing here and there.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------

I wonΓÇÖt lie; itΓÇÖs pretty damn high. Due to it not being natively on Mac itΓÇÖs not going to run silky-smooth, even if youΓÇÖve got the latest hardware. As mentioned above, any issues with a few seconds of freezing here and there, just pop down the graphics settings.
