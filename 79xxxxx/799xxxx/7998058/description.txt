Master of Kung Fu was an American comic book series from 1974 to 1983. The series is alternately known as Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu (not to be confused with a later title of the same name) or MOKF. Beginning with issue #17, the series continued the numbering sequence from Special Marvel Edition (Shang-Chi had previously appeared there in issues #15 and #16). Written primarily by Doug Moench, Master of Kung Fu featured martial arts secret agent Shang-Chi. Although Shang-Chi was an original Marvel Comics character, many of his supporting cast members, including Fu Manchu, Fah Lo Suee, Sir Denis Nayland Smith, and Doctor Petrie, were in fact the creation of pulp crime novelist Sax Rohmer.

That's also why, in the recent Secret Avengers story-arc featuring Shangi-Chi, Marvel chose not to mention Fu Manchu's name, even though a zombified Fu Manchu appeared and interacted with others for many pages!
