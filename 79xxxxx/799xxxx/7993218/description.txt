I've got something to say....I killed a baby today.....doesn't matter much to me as long as it's dead........ This song is an athem for all of those who like Punk, The Misfits with Glen Danzig was the best!!!!! I don't care what they say, Graves was good, But Danzig was better. Anyways. Once you Download please seed.
