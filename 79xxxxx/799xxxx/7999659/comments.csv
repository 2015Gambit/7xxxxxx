As an X-er and ..frankly..The Last Innocent American Generation..I remember the campaign..myself and a few others waged as innocent teens to Obtain 'Caligula'.

'Porn' was Incredibly difficult to get for us..just 3 decades ago..video..meant getting ..ironically and typically one of the more enlightened (or?) Hippie Chicks to get us Not Only the 'tape' but a rental machine too..and more often than not they came back to the ranch with 'Butterfly' or some other useless softcore..OH how we schemed to get hold of THIS very item..

Sigh...the Salad Days...

The Last Innocent Generation...

I salute you.."
