For some reason this torrent was only ever posted as a multi-part .rar which, unsurprisingly, attracted a grand total of 8 seeders. My first torrent, possibly my only one. Just wanted this episode out there because it bugs me that it's not available. Seed; download and post your own; whatever. I'll seed as long as I can. My bandwidth is garbage but its better than nothing.
