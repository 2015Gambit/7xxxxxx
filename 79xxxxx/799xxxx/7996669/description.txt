Worried about a $1.5 million dollar lawsuit left behind by her husband, Taylor invites a psychic to "cleanse" her house. The lawsuit is ultimately settled, though not in the way Taylor would like. The drama also continues in Brandi's life, as Lisa asks her to meet with Scheana, the waitress who admitted to having an affair with BrandiΓÇÖs ex-husband. Seeking counsel from another wise divorcee, Camille, Brandi decides to come face-to-face with the woman who had a hand in ruining her marriage. After the confrontation, things get worse for Scheana as she picks up shifts at Lisa's restaurant, SUR, and tries to fit in with the other servers. In an effort to keep a hand on her unruly staff, Lisa encourages Scheana to stand up to Stassi, the self-proclaimed "leader of the pack" who has been labeling her a "home wrecker" to all of her new co-workers.
