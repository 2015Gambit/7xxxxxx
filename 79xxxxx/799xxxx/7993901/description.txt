Why Everest ?

Because itΓÇÖs  there! Well,  thatΓÇÖs what  famous mountaineer 
George Mallory once said when a cheeky journalist asked him 
the same question.  But there are lots of  great reasons to 
write about the worldΓÇÖs highest mountain. Did you know that 
Mount Everest  is so close to  space, the sky is  black? Or 
that  at Base  Camp, you  sleep on  a river  of ice  (which 
creaks and moans  beneath you)? Or that  mountains can make 
you crazy enough to walk off a cliff, see people who arenΓÇÖt 
there or strip naked in sub-zero temperatures? ItΓÇÖs true!   

     ThereΓÇÖs awesome  facts, spooky  mysteries and  best of 
all, death-  defying stories  of brave adventurers.  My own 
mountain experience  is rather  less inspiring:  on finally 
stumbling up  a snowy 6000-metre  pass in Nepal,  I groaned 
and  threw up  green bile  in front  of a  friendΓÇÖs camera! 
Apart from a sore  stomach and a less-than-glamorous photo, 
it  gave me  a  deep admiration  for  mountaineers -  their 
bravery, their determination,  and their cast-iron stomachs 
. . .  And not just the record-holders  like Edmund Hillary 
and Tenzing Norgay, but the  many people who find their own 
challenges to  face, their own  mountains to climb.  I hope 
you find yours.                                             

     Take care, and happy adventuring!
