Hey guys. This is my first torrent, so let me know if I'm doing something wrong. This is the activator made by Solidsquad to activate Solidworks x64 for any version from 2010-2013. 

With Solidworks 2012 (and maybe other versions) in Windows 8, there are issues with the crack and Solidworks only opens for the 30 day trial period after cracking. I've tried a lot of things to fix this, and the only thing that has worked is this new activator. 


To use this activator, use the same serials from the 2012 crack (including flow simulation etc etc), then run this crack (it can be in any folder when you run it, it automatically replaces swactwiz.exe and other relevant files). 


IMPORTANT!!!!!!
This is not quite the perfect fix. For some reason, this crack has been corrupting some file or reference to a file and the font "Century Gothic" no longer works in Solidworks 2012 after using this crack. The font still works fine in other programs. This isn't a big deal - you just have to change your default Solidworks fonts to something else or your dimensions won't show up. Do this by going to Options > Document Settings > Annotations/Dimensions/Tables and clicking the "Font" button. 

I haven't found a way to change the font for the names of the Sketch planes, so mine show up as "?????????". I'm just going to live with it, though. I've gotten all of my other files and settings to work just fine.


I also have the x32 crack if anyone wants it. 

Enjoy!
