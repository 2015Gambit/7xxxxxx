,Arkenstone,2013-01-06T01:48Z,KMSnano activates via KMS (Key Management Service). It's good for 180 days (6 months) at a time. After 6 months rerun KMSnano to extend activation.
,extracube,2013-01-07T02:25Z,Is it possible that in 6 months from now the KMSnano program will be ineffective?

If Microsoft blocks the KMS host setup key that KMSnano uses it is very possible that KMSnano will be ineffective in 6 months!"

it auto re-activates every 180 days."
,fire_bender,2013-01-09T14:30Z,so its basically same as permanent activator
