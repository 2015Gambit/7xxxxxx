,watnoto,2013-01-08T01:04Z,"Thank you for the uploads.
Please re-upload & re-seed for part-6, part-7 and part-8, to fix the problem 99.8%."
,forthewine,2013-01-09T10:48Z,"anyone that could elaborate on why is this 99% happening and provide us with any workaround maybe? 

thanks for the uploads sys"
,watnoto,2013-01-09T14:47Z,"I have several times found the same stucking problem on other uploader's torrents.
I don't know why it's happened, but I saw that they solve the problem this way: 
--Downloaders already had folder containing files (99.8%) from this stucked torrent. Say it as ""FOLDER A"". 
--Uploader did re-upload new torrent in different title (with exactly the same content) to TPB & re-seed the new torrent. (Then delete this stucked torrent from TPB) 
--Downloaders got the new torrent in their client (uTorrent, BitTorrent, etcs..), let the client did download for 1 or 2 minutes, so that client created, and we had new folder (let's say it as ""FOLDER B""). 
--Stopped downloading in the client. 
--Copied (& replaced) all files from ""FOLDER A"" into ""FOLDER B"". 
--In the torrent client, did mouse's ""right click"" to show pop-up menu, then run ""Force Re-Check"".
--Start the torrent again in the client. 
This way, the same new torrent's folder will have the same files and sizes = 99.8% as the old torrent's folder, and downloaders will only need to download the rest 0.2% pieces.
CMIIW....
(or let uploader to just contact TPB crew on how to solve the problem..  thepiratebay.se/contact) 
thanks..........."

if we could please have the workaround so we can pass it on to similar cases, it would be much appreciated."
