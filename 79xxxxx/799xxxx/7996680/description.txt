Okay so watching the episode this morning and I realised, Lady rainicorn speaks too much, so I got the translation from the wikia, did a bit of editing to the english and made this

I'll do this each time Lady Rainicorn talks a lot or if I'm bored and people want it, I'll try and make subs whenever she talks, just let me know.

To use the subs, just play the episode in question through VLC player and drag the subs in, I think this works with most media players, but sometimes it might be necessary to open the subs manually through the menu and what not

I hope this helps, there was one line that I didn't get, sorry about that
