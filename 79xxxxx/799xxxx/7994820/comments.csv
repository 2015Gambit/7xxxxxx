we can't really just replace it as it would overwrite other sceneries settings that relay on terrain.cfg file that add info into it like UTX and others."
,FSXNebdeath,2013-01-07T18:54Z,the entries on the .cfg file are only tongass fjords that can be copied and pasted to your original
,FSXNebdeath,2013-01-07T18:56Z,"there are 40 lines of texture entries, texture.xxx"
,FSXNebdeath,2013-01-07T18:58Z,"I should've explained, it's a .txt file with entries to copy and paste to your .cfg"
