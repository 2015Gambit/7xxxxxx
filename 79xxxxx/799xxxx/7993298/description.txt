Just one guitar slinger alive today can say he influenced Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Peter Green, Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana, Michael Bloomfield, Albert King, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Bonnie Raitt, and has been embraced as an equal by such legends as Willie Dixon, Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, and Muddy Waters. His name is Otis Rush and he is a master of the guitar, with unpredictable runs packed with daredevil bends, unfalteringly rattled low strings, and adventurous chord progressions. (amazon.com)
