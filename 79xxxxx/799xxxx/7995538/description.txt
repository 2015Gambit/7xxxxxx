It's now 1958 and Russell Keys has long ago left his family. During one of his abductions however, he see his now teenage son Jesse has also been abducted. Keys has been trying to find a pattern to his abductions in the hope of avoiding being taken. So he returns to his home in Illinois and convinces his son to run away with him. His wife, who is re-married to a police officer, is frantic particularly when Russell returns but Jesse does not. Owen Crawford is now a Lieutenant Colonel and in charge of the program resulting from the Roswell crash. Very little has been accomplished in the last 10 years so he fires the entire team and decides on a new tack. In Texas, Sally Clarke's son Jacob is now 10 years old and clearly has special powers. His half brother and sister want to send him away to a boarding school to protect him but Sally is completely against the idea. She reconsiders after getting an unexpected visit from Crawford who tries to dupe her.
