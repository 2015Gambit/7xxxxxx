                     A Memoir
                  with Gareth Owen


The  quintessential  suave  hero,  Roger Moore  has  had  an
extraordinary career  that has  spanned seven  decades, from
early television  to the golden  age of Hollywood and  on to
international superstardom. Dashing, handsome and every inch
the archetypal English gentleman, he is unforgettable as The
Saint, as Lord  Brett Sinclair in "The  Persuaders!" and, of
course, as  James Bond,  making seven blockbusting  films as
arguably the most debonair of  the 007s. For the first time,
Roger  shares  his  recollections  of playing  some  of  the
world's  most famous  roles  alongside a  host of  legendary
stars. It features  myriad stories from his  personal life -
from  his childhood  in  London and  experiences during  the
Second World  War, to the  happy and turbulent times  in his
later life.  Along with anecdotes about  his encounters with
the  stars and  his wonderful  memories from  the heyday  of
Hollywood,  "My Word  is My  Bond"  is as  frank, funny  and
disarmingly charming as the legend himself.
