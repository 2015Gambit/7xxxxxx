Then tonight I thought it through: on the MacBook Pro, it was installed prior to the Mountain Lion upgrade, using version 3, and it all went swimmingly (excuse the pun) when I installed 3.2 over the pre-existing version."

serial box new Version: - 01-2013
you get serial for this here"
[T],NoggintheNomad,2013-01-08T00:57Z,It only has the serial for the pre-Mountain Lion release. 3.0.1. This serial doesn't work on Mountain Lion for a clean install for 3.2. I'm sure I'm not the only person to try installing 3.2 on Mountain Lion with this serial. I found out how.
[T],NoggintheNomad,2013-01-08T01:01Z,3.0.1 serial doesn't work for a first time install on 10.8
,0GW0,2013-01-08T09:36Z,"Works fine for me.
10.8.2"
[T],NoggintheNomad,2013-01-08T16:20Z,"OK, maybe everyone didn't have this issue. But when I used migration assistant to shift from my old iMac (also running Mountain Lion) to the new one, Marine Aquarium 'died', it wouldn't accept the serial at all. This little procedure finally fixed it for me. Being fairly certain that I'm probably not the only one, I uploaded it."
