,potvinsuks,2013-01-05T18:35Z,Happy New Year Snakeye!  Just to let you guys know NOT to use this if you guys are using GEX.
,virtualanarchy,2013-01-05T19:27Z,More of an FS9 tweak if you ask me... But great one _SnakEye! :)
[T],_SnakEye,2013-01-05T22:49Z,"Correct, it's either this or GEX you should be using.
GEX IMO is much better.
this could be a good solution mainly for FS9"
