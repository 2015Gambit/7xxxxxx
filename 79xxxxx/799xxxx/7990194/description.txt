FScene X is a captivating and subtle makeover for the default scenery of Flight Simulator X and FS2004.

This innovative scenery expansion includes the Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter (and a beautiful snowy 'hard Winter' season) to give your flying a makeover that lasts all year!

FScene X transforms the generic FS ground textures to something with far greater realism. Mountains, forests, jungles and deserts take on a new three-dimensional feel; the countryside is subtly transformed with realistic colours and urban areas look more authentic. The software covers a huge swathe of the planet's surface and will transform your simulated flying.

Frame rate-friendly textures won't slow your flying down, and FScene is fully compatible with mesh terrain and add-on airport scenery.
