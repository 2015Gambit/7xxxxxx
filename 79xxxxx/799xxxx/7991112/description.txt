Pat and Karan, owners of the Whiskey Creek Steakhouse in Keyport, Wash., have lost nearly everything in the 20 years their restaurant has been open. As if the poorly cooked food and dreary design weren't big enough problems for Chef Robert Irvine to fix, he also must confront the staff when he uncovers money may be missing from the restaurant's financial records.
