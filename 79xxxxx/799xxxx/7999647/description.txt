Reader Beware:  You will never look at the U.S. Government the same 
                after seeing this one.

Original Scanned Document from 1962

My thoughts:

I have a whole new look on my government after reading this one.
It is pretty fucked up.  They don't care who they kill it seems 
as long as "we think" what they want us to.

I never been a big believer in the 9/11 conspiracy, until I read this
and now know for a fact the government does plan things like this.
It really gets me thinking.

This is the declassified document about the details of US government
planning to commit a terrorist attack on its own people.

About File:

According to secret and long-hidden documents, the Joint Chiefs of Staff drew up and approved plans for what may be the most corrupt plan ever created by the U.S. government ΓÇô A FAKE TERRORIST ATTACK ON ITS OWN CITIZENS.

Code named Operation Northwoods, the plan, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, D.C., Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phony evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer and his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and international backing, they needed to launch their war.

One idea seriously considered involved the launch of John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth. On February 20, 1962, Glenn was to lift off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on his historic journey. The flight was to carry the banner of AmericaΓÇÖs virtues of truth, freedom, and democracy into orbit high over the planet. But Lemnitzer and his Chiefs had a different idea. They proposed to Lansdale that, should the rocket explode and kill Glenn, ΓÇ£the objective is to provide irrevocable proof that the fault lies with the Communists et al Cuba.
