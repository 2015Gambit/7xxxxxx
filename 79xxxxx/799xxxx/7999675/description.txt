Wow, I'm surprised that no-one has posted this Italian classic to TPB. No-one seemed very interested when I posted I'm Not Rappoport, maybe this will be more enticing.

This movie was remade by Al Pacino as Scent of a Woman (1992), but cognoscenti reckon the original is better - check and compare. The story is a comedy about a blind retired military officer who has a lusty taste for the ladies, whom he distinguishes by their scent. After many madcap adventures, he experiences true fear when he genuinely falls in love.

I copped the movie from youtube and the subtitles from opensubtitles, I had a devil of a job to make them fit; they should work fairly well now. The movie is Spanish-dubbed, the subtitles are in English.
