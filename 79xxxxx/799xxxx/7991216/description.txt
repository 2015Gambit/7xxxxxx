Hi,
 
Finally, took me 18 months. Making a gallery to honour our (most) loved artists requires a portrait of Michael Jackson. However to make a suitable portrait is not easy. Too much hits, old stuff, badly cut tracks etc.
 
Tried several times but the energy seemed to leaf my body halfway. Finally its finished. Gathered the best sounding tracks, cut the ruff edges and found some inspiration to listen a bit to the great artist he really was (instead of the hit machine).
 
Fortunately about 20% of the tracks differ from the standard ultimate collections.
 
Enjoy
