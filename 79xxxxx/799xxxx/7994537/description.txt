Book Description
Developers often tell me they wish theyΓÇÖd found our Java book first, before spending time and money on others. Here are a few of the reasons why I believe this book will work equally well for you:

Who this book is for
This book is for anyone who wants to learn the core features of the Java language:

- It works if youΓÇÖre new to programming.
- It works if you have programming experience with another language.
- It works if you already know an older version of Java and you want to get up-to-speed with Java SE 7.
- It works if youΓÇÖve already read 3 or 4 other Java books and still donΓÇÖt know how to develop a real-world application.

If youΓÇÖre new to programming, the prerequisites are minimal. You just need to be familiar with the operation of the platform that youΓÇÖre using. That means you should know how to perform tasks like opening, saving, printing, closing, copying, and deleting files.
