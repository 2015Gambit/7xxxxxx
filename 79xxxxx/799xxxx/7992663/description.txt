Classic Steam Train Collection 
This DVD collection tells the story of many great trains including the King Edward 1st, Green Arrow, Taw Valley, Flying Scotsman, Clan Line, Black Five and Castle & Manor, beautifully capturing the sights and sounds of a bygone era. The 'Flying Scotsman' is the ultimate pictorial records of how the world's most famous express locomotive steamed triumphantly into the Millennium. Then join the drivers and fireman aboard the Great Western engines for live footplate action sequences as you've never seen before, as a team of Great Western engine-men from the days of steam are reunited with their engines.






7)  Castle and Manor 
This volume takes a look at clash between the Bradley Manor and the Earl Bathurst engines for the Torbay Express route between Bristol and Kingswear. See how Castle class locomotive 5051 "Earl Bathurst" copes with a 75-mile an hour dash to the seaside as she stands in for 7802 "Bradley Manor" on the first of a series of Torbay Express excursions between Bristol and Kingswear.
