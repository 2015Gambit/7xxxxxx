 
 
With his signature wit, charm, and seemingly limitless knowledge, Bill Bryson takes 

us on a room-by-room tour through his own house, using each room as a jumping off 

point into the vast history of the domestic artifacts we take for granted. As he 

takes us through the history of our modern comforts, Bryson demonstrates that 

whatever happens in the world eventually ends up in our home, in the paint, the 

pipes, the pillows, and every item of furniture. Bryson has one of the liveliest, 

most inquisitive minds on the planet, and his sheer prose fluency makes At Home one 

of the most entertaining books ever written about private life.
