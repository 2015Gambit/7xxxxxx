Editorial Reviews
All Music Guide - Andrew Leahey
Recorded during her 2010 tour in support of Give Up the Ghost, this live 
album finds Brandi Carlile performing a mix of original songs and cover 
material alongside the Seattle Symphony. Carlile's earthy pop
ock is a far cry from classical fare, perhaps, but the pairing doesn't sound as 
odd as you'd think. With their cathartic melodies and storybook lyrics, her 
songs have always tended to fare equally well in acoustic settings and full-
band arrangements. Backed by a full orchestra, they take on an anthemic 
quality while still highlighting everything that makes Carlile's music so 
appealing, keeping the spotlight on her voice -- which has never sounded 
better -- and festooning it with all sorts of pretty flourishes. Occasionally, the 
symphony pulls away entirely, leaving Carlile and her longtime backing band 
-- including brothers Tim and Phil Hanseroth, who perform a spot-on cover of 
"The Sound of Silence" toward the end of the set -- to remind everyone what 
the core of this music sounds like. But Live at Benaroya Hall is more 
concerned with dressing up Carlile's music in elegant, orchestral clothing, and 
the results are pretty stunning, from the grandeur of "The Story" -- now 
featuring horns, woodwinds, and strings -- to the graceful ebb and flow of 
Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah," which vacillates between simple guitar 
arpeggios and lush symphonic swells. This isn't Brandi Carlile's first concert 
album, but it's certainly the best.
