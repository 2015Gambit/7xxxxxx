Information
------------------------------

Reporter Samantha Poling hears how former servicemen are dying in Iraq and Afghanistan while on UK Government contracts paid for by the taxpayer with little public knowledge of their deaths.

The programme talks to private security contractors who take us to the heart of one of Britain's most powerful - and controversial - industries. It's a sector in which multi-million pound contracts are put up for grabs and where it's feared some companies put profits before the lives of those on the ground.

We also examine the case of a Scottish former Royal Marine murdered in Iraq by a colleague who wasn't properly vetted by the company. The programme reveals that the firm was warned by one of its own employees before taking on the killer, and hears calls from the family of the dead man for the company to face criminal charges.
