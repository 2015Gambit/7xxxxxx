,macwun,2013-01-09T11:18Z,"thank goodness some people encode in 5.1. Unfortunately YIFI is NOT one of them. Downvoting every one of his vids till he decides to 1)encode in 5.1, 2) give details of audio encodes (which he conveniently ""forgets"" to inlcude, probably because he's embarassed he can't or won't encode in 5.1). YIFI sucks. "
,raykyogrou0,2013-01-09T13:17Z,"@macwun:  Why the fuck are you complaining about this?  You should be happy that someone takes their time to encode and upload movies and that you can download them for free!  If you don't like these encodes, then download someone else's and stop complaining, you selfish piece of shit."
