Three men, three dreams. It&#x27;s 1976 in Flint, Michigan. Jackie Moon&#x27;s American Basketball Association team languishes in last place, with few fans in the seats. Jackie dreams of a merger with the NBA. A tough-minded point guard named Monix is at the end of his career; he&#x27;s played on the champion Celtics but accepts a trade to Flint to be close to Lynn, the love of his life. Clarence &#x22;Coffee&#x22; Brown dreams of stardom: he&#x27;s the Tropics&#x27; best player, but he&#x27;s a hotdog who doesn&#x27;t value teamwork. When the trio learns that a merger is in the works that won&#x27;t include the Tropics, they pull the team together to try to achieve the impossible. Can dreams come true in Flint?
