The Ed Show; January 4, 2013.

President Obama nominated Republican Chuck Hagel as defense secretary and conservatives are fuming.

"Chuck Hagel, if confirmed to be secretary of defense, would be the most antagonistic secretary of defense towards the state of Israel in our nation's history," Sen. Lindsay Graham said.

Ed welcomed former Rep. Joe Sestak (D-PA) (former Vice Admiral, U.S. Navy), and Richard Wolffe (Executive Editor, MSNBC.com and MSNBC Political Analyst), to sort out what Hagel's nomination could mean for our nation's defense.

Then, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell doesn't mind another hostage situation for the deficit at the expense of the most vulnerable. David Cay Johnston (columnist for Reuters, Pulitzer Prize winner and author of "Perfectly Legal" and "Free Lunch") layed out the GOP fabricated spending problem ahead.

Then, some Republicans coae out for a government shutdown. John Nichols (Washington Correspondent of The Nation), explained why that's backwards thinking.

The opposition on common sense gun safety reaches extremes. But for Vice President Biden, an assault weapons ban is just the beginning. Ed talked with Val Demings (former Orlando Chief of Police and former Democratic nominee for U.S. Congress).

David Addington (the Bush administration's chief advocate for torture, now has a surprising new mission).

And in the BIG Finish, Democrats are taking action to fix the filibuster after one of the least productive sessions of Congress.  Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) joined Ed to discuss his reform plan.
