Dinosaurs For Hire is an American comic book series created by Tom Mason in 1988. It was first published by Eternity Comics and ran nine issues until 1990 when it was cancelled. The title once again returned to publication in a revamped version in 1993 by Malibu Comics, which Eternity had become an imprint of.

Dinosaurs For Hire, along with Ex-Mutants, was merged with the Protectors universe during Malibu's Genesis crossover before being cancelled a second time. While Malibu was purchased by Marvel Comics in 1993, it is unclear whether or not Dinosaurs for Hire was part of that purchase.

Dinosaurs For Hire is a satirical comic that is heavy on parody and humor. The primary characters are a T-Rex named Archie who dresses like the Terminator, a Triceratops named Lorenzo who wears a Hawaiian shirt, a one-eyed Stegosaurus named Reese who wields heavy weapons and a pterodactyl named Cyrano. In the comics, the Dinosaurs are mercenaries for hire and exist in the 20th century.
