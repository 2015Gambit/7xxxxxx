,Granchy,2013-01-06T07:39Z,"So no one has finished downloading this yet?  If the quality is the same as the hobbit screener, I will either just wait or actually go to a theater."
,number1414,2013-01-07T09:19Z,"Nah the quality is better.

A:10
V:10
M:10"
,michilllie,2013-01-08T03:23Z,"Watched it. Everything was great. V-10, A-10...the only odd thing that happened was when I rebooted, after downloading and watching, my computer died. I've been trying to bring it up all day and nothing had been changed to my comp since the last reboot. I doubt it was because of this download, but if anyone experienced the same problem, please post. I'm not very computer savvy, so I'm just guessing. Thanks  :)"
,Lapendio,2013-01-08T07:53Z,"Still too many leechers...
Thanks EZ!
Will give feedback as soon as I watch it, even though everyone knows your torrents are only best quality."
