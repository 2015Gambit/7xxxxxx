This are fill issues for a request by rakib2099.

I tried to find Buffy the Vampire Slayer Classic 01, 02 & 03 my friend -- and I did find quite a few later issues of that series -- but those first three are elusive!

However, since the "Classic" series is really just a digital reprinting of the old comics, I have gathered the 8 issues which have the original stories that have been reprinted as Classic 1, 2, and 3. They are:

Buffy the Vampire Slayer Classic 01 = Spike and Dru 03
Buffy the Vampire Slayer Classic 02 = Buffy: The Origin 01, 02, 03
Buffy the Vampire Slayer Classic 03 = Buffy 51, 52, 53, 54

rakib2099, I hope this helps!  --STFmaryville
