Paul Chambers-led sextet from 1956 with John Coltrane




FROM LEONARD FEATHER COMMENTS:(included)  I would call Chambers a gas, except that  

it is depressing to think about gas chambers; so perhaps a bolder word may be 

permitted. Chambers, as his fellow musicians have been saying ever since they heard 

his very first solo, IS A BITCH. 




SO....the next time you get scolded for using the "B" word...just explain....

...Honey,.... c'mon......I meant it as a compliment.
