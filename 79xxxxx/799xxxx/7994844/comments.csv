,kornspell,2013-01-10T15:57Z,"So what is this? Dvdscr, dvdrip...what? The quality, judging from the captures doesn't seem very good. Can anyone confirm?"
,Tolzar,2013-01-10T17:02Z,"I am not sure what this is, but dont be deceived by the quality, this film was filmed with HI-8 80s cams. The idea is to give the film an 80s look, so the image quality is intentionally low.
I saw it in theathers and the captures look just right."
