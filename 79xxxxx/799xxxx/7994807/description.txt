Overview:

Assassin’s Creed® is a game that redefined the action-adventure genre. With photo-realistic graphics, an advanced physics model, and a nearly fanatical attention to detail, this title was able to begin a new chapter in gaming history. However, the excellent technical aspects are only half of the reason why it became so popular; the other half is the story.

While you technically play the game as Desmond Miles, the main focus of the game takes place elsewhere. The year is 1191: Jerusalem, the middle of the Third Crusade. You are a member of a mysterious order of assassins where you have trained your whole life to do one thing and one thing only – to kill. The recently growing influence of the Order of the Knights Templar disturbs the delicate balance of power in the region and therefore directly threatens The Brotherhood. The clash of the two most powerful organizations in Jerusalem at the time has the most unexpected consequences and triggers devastating events that threaten the world itself, and you – Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad – are in the middle of all this.
