copy all 11 DLC and DLC FIX .pkg to USB drive

on PS3, first install DLCs, then DLC FIX

then copy files via multiman to correct folder (details in readme.txt)

let me know if you still have trouble

I have downloaded patch for bles01661,then downloaded all blus dlc's & fix (not downloaded v 1.03 blus update)
Installed all DLC's & then fix on ps3, went to MM from ps3 root copied usdir from blus30927 & pasted to bles01661 & did yes overwrite
Now I do not get any empty blus folder as its copy paste instead of cut
Am I doing something wrong?
Do these DLC's show instantly or at some point of time
Please help"

,dududus,2013-01-07T23:36Z,"once you copied the BLUS folder, just delete it.

the DLC should all pop up as soon as you start the game"
,rishi82in,2013-01-08T09:21Z,"done it already, it didnt help..wish i could play all the DLC, anyways thanks dududus for help & support"
,rishi82in,2013-01-08T17:12Z,"hi dududus sorry to bother u, have downloaded blus version, so now I shall just install blus patch, then all dlc's & lastly the fix?"
,dududus,2013-01-09T09:28Z,"yes that will work without any copying

or, with the BLES release, go to MM in your Sleeping Dogs game settings and press ""fix permissions"". Start the game and then try. "
,rishi82in,2013-01-09T16:55Z,"thanks dududus it works perfectly fine,playing & enjoying it again with DLC's, thanks a ton"
