Digimon World Re:Digitize is a 2012 video game for the PlayStation Portable released 

only in Japan. The game play is similar, but not identical, to the good old Digimon 

World for PS1.

You can play it into a PSP with custom firmware, or with a good emulator.

Do not ask me for the translation of this game, I'm waiting too :)

Please seed!
