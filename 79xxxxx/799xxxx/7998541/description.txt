 A new employee at SUR has a hard time overcoming gossip about her past.
 PREMIERE: Monday January 7, 9 pm

Lisa Vanderpump's new hire for SUR, Scheana, is ostracized because of her past affair with a married man. Scheana's co-worker, Stassi, the self-proclaimed "leader of the pack" leads the charge against Scheana, labeling her a "homewrecker." Eventually, Scheana, with Lisa's encouragement, stands up to Stassi, serving notice that she's at the restaurant to stay.
