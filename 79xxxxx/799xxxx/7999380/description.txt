"Black Sunday"

Jules and Grayson are in their first week 
of marriage, but it's not all wedded bliss 
for the latter, who has a lot to learn 
about being Jules' husband. Meanwhile, 
Bobby tries giving fatherly advice to 
Travis after he turns 21; and Ellie and 
Laurie console a depressed Jules when 
Grayson won't apologize for what he did in 
her dream. 

18/Slow
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
