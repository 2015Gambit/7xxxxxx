 Dangerous people from his fatherΓÇÖs world have discovered that Cash holds information that could put them away for a very long time.

Having nearly overcome her wariness of bad boys, OliviaΓÇÖs trust is shaken when this new threat arises.

She soon discovers that there are some situations in life where trust is a girlΓÇÖs only option. And this is one of them. If sheΓÇÖs to live, she must trust Cash with her life.
