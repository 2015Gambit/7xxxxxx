SUMMARY

Decorated Vietnam hero Frank Vega returns home only to
get shunned by society leaving him without a job or his
high school sweetheart. It's not until forty years later
when an incident on a commuter bus (where he protects an
elderly black man from a pair of skin heads) makes him a
local hero where he's suddenly celebrated once again.
But his good fortune suddenly turns for the worse when
his best friend Klondike is murdered and the police
aren't doing anything about it.
