Maybe you've seen the PR - now read the comicbook! At one time, BUTCHER BAKER was the preeminent, All-American superhero. Now he's... getting laid. A lot. But one last mission could signal his return to glory, and now he's back on the blacktop! It's a balls-out, surreal super-epic from creators JOE CASEY (GODLAND, Ben 10) and MIKE HUDDLESTON (The Coffin), and it starts right here!
