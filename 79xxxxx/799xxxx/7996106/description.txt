"Pilot"

The death of wealthy party girl Vivian 
Bowers doesn't add up for FBI agent Will 
Moreno (Laz Alonso), especially in a 
family as suspicious as the Bowers. 
Convinced that the tabloid staple's death 
was a homicide, he recruits his former 
SFPD partner and Vivian's childhood best 
friend, Joanna Padget Locasto (Meagan 
Good) to re-establish ties with the 
Bowers. Determined to find justice for 
her estranged best friend, Joanna 
infiltrates the dynasty she once 
considered family, and quickly begins to 
uncover why Vivian's life was very much 
in danger.
