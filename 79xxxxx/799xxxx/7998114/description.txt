"Mary, Mary" is a fluffy little film on the subject of a liberated businessman (John Leslie) who, when faced with a grievous case of premature ejaculatis, sells his soul to the Devil in exchange for an all powerful aphrodisiac. Sure enough, the Devil (called the Arranger in this film) produces a miracle paste that when rubbed or ingested or otherwise consumed produces more wood than the whole of Canada. A lot of fucking ensues culminating in a climactic orgy in which the Arranger comes down, kills off the participants (who include Sharon Thorpe among others) and carries off Connie into the sunset, proving that the Devil has good taste in womenΓÇªA brilliant, sexy romp and perhaps Constance Money's finest flick in terms of sex. A keeper.
