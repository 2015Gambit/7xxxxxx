Danger UXB is a 1979 British ITV television series developed by John Hawkesworth and starring Anthony Andrews as Lieutenant Brian Ash, a new direct commission officer in World War II.
Ash's first posting is to 347 Section of 97 Tunnelling Company, a bomb disposal unit of the Royal Engineers, which is assigned the duty of defusing unexploded bombs ("UXBs") in London during the Blitz, a job he must learn with the most rudimentary of training. The series primarily featured military storylines, with a romantic thread featuring an inventor's married daughter, Susan Mount (Judy Geeson), with whom Ash falls in love, and other human interest vignettes.
The programme was titled and partly based on the memoirs of Major A. B. Hartley, M.B.E, RE, Unexploded Bomb. The series was filmed in 1978 in and around the Clapham, Streatham and Tooting areas of South London.[1]
The programme appeared on the U.S. PBS as a segment of Masterpiece Theatre from 1980 to 1981. It was also screened in Australia on the public broadcaster ABC Television.
