Welcome to this series of tutorials focusing on creating a 2D avatar based on a photo reference. We will begin this process by discussing what an avatar is and how it can represent a user in a digital form. We'll also examine the photo that we'll be referencing and explore sketching a caricature based off this photo to be used as our avatar. From there, we'll begin fleshing out our avatar's base facial expression by adding line work and blocking in colors and values. Finally, we'll learn how we can create an additional expression for our avatar by using most of the information contained within our initial expression. Throughout this course we will be focusing on how the different aspects of our avatar read visually when shrunken down.
