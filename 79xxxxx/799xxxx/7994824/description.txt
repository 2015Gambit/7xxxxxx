In the 1800s the legendary bandit rode the streets of California on his black horse to challenge the authority of a ruthless government. But once his true identity was discovered he suffered a terrible fate. Several years later, with the help of an eager apprentice for him to pass the torch to, the legend returns. The new bandit helps to right the wrongs done to his mentor and to crush the man who ruined his life. Along the way we discover that although his skills with horses and swords are considerable, his real talent is with the ladies.
