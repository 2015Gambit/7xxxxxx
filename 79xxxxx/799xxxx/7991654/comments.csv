[T],jmanwf,2013-01-06T03:08Z,Please be advised folks this will not work on a ps3 it contains Cinavia Protection their is no possible way to bypass this at the moment sorry
,SpyrosMonster,2013-01-07T12:00Z,"@jmanwf There is actually. When I download a movie before I copy it to my ps3 I open on my pc a program that lets you edit the file and I speed the whole movie up just a very little bit. Example: If the movie is 1hour and 10minutes I speed it up so it is 1hour and 8minutes. You can't see any difference AT ALL not in the video not in the sound! It's pretty amazing! I've done that to Resident Evil: Retribution and to Resident Evil: Afterlife. Although I had some quality loss becasue I used Sony vegas pro 10 to render it... but I'm sure there are many other programs on the internet that can do the same thing without having any quality loss! I'll copy and paste this into a ""MOD"" upload so everyone can see it. Have a nice day! :D"
