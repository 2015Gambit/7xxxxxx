Trinity is an action RPG set in the world of Zill O'll. You lead three characters of different types, Aleus, Daguza, and Zelena, through a massive story that features plenty of optional sub quests.

The game's combat system is party-based, with all three characters using swords, magic, and other attacks to defeat the sometimes massive enemies. The fields of play themselves contribute to the action, changing as you cast magic and break down columns. As an example, you can freeze a lake to walk over it, or pick up a column that's fallen due to your attacks and use it as a weapon.
