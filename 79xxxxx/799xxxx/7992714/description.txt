
 Leary manages to be harsh and hilarious about foibles and situations, stupidity and hypocrisy. No Cure for Cancer is the written version of a series of monologues he wrote while in the United Kingdom. Perhaps the most memorable aspects of the book are the speculation about a story drawn from a supermarket checkout newspaper about a man who lost his penis in an industrial accident; Leary's childhood experience of being shot in the head by his brother with an arrow; and his rants about drugs, the psychoses of New York, and the kind of childhood no one would willingly claim is normal for America, but probably (and frighteningly) is!
