The emulators for activating Windows 8 RTM (Professional and Enterprise) are here!

These scripts were made by the russian WZOR team.this included 2 scripts for activating Enterprise edition (just in case that the first script doesent work) and 1 script for Professional edition and they'll activate you OS for 180 days.

This way works on both x86 and x64 editions.

install notes 

For activating your OS just run one of the scripts As Administrator and restart!
1. First, if you are running an enterprise evaluation from Microsoft, after installation you will see a 90-day watermark at the bottom right of the screen. There is no need to run the emulator only if the trial is left with round 10 days.
2.Run the first emulator with elevated privileges(right click run with administrator.)This will be a quick process. Note: There is no need to disable or to turn off the internet connection.
3.You are done! The trial shows a 90-day before the expiration date. 
N.B. This is not an automated process by a program installed on the computer. You will need to run the scripts again once the trial expires. This emulator cannot be guaranteed of working after the non-evaluation Enterprise version is out. 
*Note: If you get any errors by running one of the files just add the following line to your hosts file by using notepad

for use the VL key will require you to find a working KMS-server(non online at this point) and using the retail keys will require you to activate windows later using an OEM-loader if one becomes available.

(seemes unlikely at this time given the improved security of the OEM activation process).



For good measure here is the default keys allowing you to install this as both core and pro as well as retail and VL
