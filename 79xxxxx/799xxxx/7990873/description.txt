A classic blast from the glorious past! German thrash metal legends Kreator offer up the rare 'At The Pulse Of Kapitulation - Live in East Berlin 1990' for the very first time on DVD. Upgraded to a 5.1 mix via producer Andy Sneap and loaded with bonus footage, this is truly a dream come true for Kreator fans. In the words of band leader Mille Petrozza: "Words don t do justice to the energy that was in the air that day in East Berlin, and the whole event can only be described as utterly unique and historic.
