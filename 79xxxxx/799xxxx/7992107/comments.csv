,moshster,2013-01-07T09:52Z,This has the same Russian surround mix with just the center channel taken from an English dialog mix.  It's not a proper English 5.1 mix.

,kronos88,2013-01-10T07:17Z,"Dialog is English but most written text throughout the movie (on books, written on walls, dates, etc) is Russian. Frustrating but not complaining; I watched this movie for free."
