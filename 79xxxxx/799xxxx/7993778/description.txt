In the not-so-distant future, or maybe a parallel today, there exists a world where superheroes walk, and sometimes fly, among ordinary citizens. Although Ultra is the star of the tale, it follow three heroines who all work for the same superhero management company, Ultra (down-to-earth Latina Pearl Penalosa), Aphrodite (model-turned-superhero Olivia Arancina), and Cowgirl (trust-fund baby Jennifer Janus). One night, the trio drop in on a fortune teller for a little harmless fun and receive fortunes that will come true in the next seven days. Aphrodite and Cowgirl quickly see results, but Ultra doubts shell find true love within a week. Shes momentarily convinced shes wrong after hooking up with a charming civilian, but when Ultra discovers he was just after her for the money he could get by selling her photos to the tabloids, she's back to her cynical self. Meanwhile, Cowgirl and Aphrodite are busy figuring out who they really are. With elegantly casual art that conveys a sense of place with an economy of line, and a wicked ear for contemporary dialogue, the Luna brothers have created a vivid, vibrant world and a charming story.
