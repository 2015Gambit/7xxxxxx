     Lenka (born Lenka Kripac on 19 March 1978) is an Australian singerΓÇôsongwriter, known for her song "The Show," (produced by Stuart Brawley), from her self-titled album Lenka. Her latest song, Everything at Once was used in a Windows 8 advert.
     As Lenka Kripac, she was a member of the Australian electronic-rock crossover band Decoder Ring for two of their albums. She then moved to California in 2007. After adopting her first name as her sole artistic name, Lenka released her eponymous debut album on 24 September 2008, with "The Show" chosen to be the first single release from the set. The album peaked at number 142 on the US Billboard 200.
     Lenka's live performance and visual image has become synonymous with a native-art, vintage craft style. These works, (known as "LenkaLand" on stage), are the result of collaborations with James Gulliver Hancock, an Australian visual artist and illustrator. In 2009 they had their first gallery exhibition, which took place at No. 12 Gallery in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan. The exhibition included a collection of works revolving around her music including set pieces and original drawings and prints. A manifesto outlining the philosophy behind their collaboration, "We Will Not Grow Old" was written to coincide with the exhibition. Lenka sometimes involves fans in art-making, with events so far in Los Angeles (in collaboration with Poketo), Hong Kong and Malaysia. Lenka has a Bachelor of Fine Arts majoring in sculpture from the College of Fine Arts Sydney (COFA).
