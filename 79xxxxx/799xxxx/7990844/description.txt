The same comic writer as Sha and Requiem the Vampire knight, so it has to be good right?

Gorgeous artwork, slow start, that gets interesting very fast :D

I hope you all enjoy.

PS: If you want to request a comic, please make a post here: https://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=51
and add as title something like [scanlation] title_of_comic.
It makes it easier for me to keep track of requests :P

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).
Then, you can use ".cbr files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!

Hope you enjoy!
