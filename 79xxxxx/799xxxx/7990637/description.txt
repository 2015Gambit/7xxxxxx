Editorial Reviews
All Music Guide - Stephen Thomas Erlewine
Presumably, the "other musings" mentioned in the title of Candlebox's fifth 
album allude to the five covers of their big '90s hits tacked onto the end of 
Love Stories & Other Musings. These new versions of "Far Behind" and "You" 
and a handful of others are faithful retreads of the original recordings but the 
band sounds a little bored trying to color within the lines, although the rest of 
Love Stories is a true surprise: Candlebox sound loose, limber, lively for the 
first time on record, breaking free from the brooding grind that's been their 
stock in trade since the start. Guitars sparkle, rhythms are elastic, the hooks 
aren't pushed; they breathe and Love Stories benefits tremendously from 
this open air. Candlebox still sound like veterans of the '90s but they're not 
beholden to grunge: they now favor the melodicism of post-grunge and bear 
the lightness and nimble chops that come with middle age, a combination that 
unexpectedly produces their best, richest album to date.
