Aspen's first-ever ongoing series begins right here!

Yet, what tales of corruption and depravity, aggression and fatal destinies await them on each of their collective paths? Find out in this fresh jumping-on point showcasing new and deadly Executive Assistants each and every month! Kicking off this exciting debut release is the beginning of a three-part story, 'Life After Death', featuring the popular Executive Assistant, Lily, and her attempts to piece together a life after losing her master along with her allies. She will learn the price of freedom is often as costly-and fatal-as a life of servitude! EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT: ASSASSINS starts now!!!
