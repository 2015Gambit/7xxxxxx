CAPSULE

Thirteen years after Wesley (Sam Milby) has cryptically migrated to the States, he returns to attend the funeral of a relative. But it isnΓÇÖt the grief thatΓÇÖs wearing Wesley down, but the deluge of questions from friends, more importantly from Aylynn (Jodi Sta. Maria), his erstwhile girlfriend whom he abandoned without much of an explanation.

When Aylynn learns of WesleyΓÇÖs homecoming, she gets anxious and dismissive. These days, she is the single mother of a smart child whoΓÇÖs 13 years old. She obviously has disceptive issues with her ex boyfriend with whom she had nurtured a 7-year relationship before he up and wentΓÇª without a word. And everyone has been hounding her of WesleyΓÇÖs palpable presence. Without much fanfare, the pertinent questions beg to be asked: Has Wesley sired a child? Will Aylynn finally get the closure she deserves? Why does Wesley keep to himself? Is he staying for good? More importantly, isn't happiness possible in a third world existence?
