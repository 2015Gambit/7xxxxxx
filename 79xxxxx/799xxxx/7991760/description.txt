Converted to MP3 320kps using dBpoweramp from the FLAC files of one of the best uploaded torrents on The Pirate Bay here:

After over 6 years this torrent is still seeded.  I have no information on what gear was used but it sounds very good.  I could listen to track 1 for an hour...

Many thanks to werdwerdus and of course Richard D. James....

Analord is a series of 12" vinyl recordings by UK-based electronic music artist Richard D. James. The first installment, Analord 10, went on sale through the Rephlex Records website on December 15, 2004, and was packaged in a leather binder with sleeves for housing the rest of the series. The record was marketed under James' primary alias "Aphex Twin", although subsequent Analord recordings have so far been released under the "AFX" pseudonym.

James has programmed a variety of analogue equipment throughout his career. Instruments on Analord include drum machines such as the Roland TR-606, TR-808, and TR-909; sequencers such as the Roland MC-4; and various synthesizers and polysynths, including the Roland SH-101 and Roland TB-303, a Fenix Modular Synth (seen on the B-side of Analord 02), and countless others he has collected over the years or borrowed from colleagues.

Analord tracks are similar in atmosphere and melody to James' early acid and ambient techno recordings, yet are still marked by the fast, choppy, multi-layered drum sequencing he has perfected from the Richard D. James Album (1996) onward.
