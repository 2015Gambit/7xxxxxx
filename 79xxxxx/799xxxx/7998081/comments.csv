,xboxgamer999,2013-01-08T21:46Z,"is this a DVD/BRRip

,Ratxhet,2013-01-08T22:43Z,thanks ez
,Skerrrt,2013-01-09T06:00Z,seeeed
,craigtoys,2013-01-09T07:53Z,@xboxgamer999 - you obviously don't know Extremezone. Try it out......
,sahilrox,2013-01-09T08:29Z,@xboxgamer WEBRip means DVD/BR quality video and CAM quality audio. If that is what you mean... :)
,nicklouslingor,2013-01-09T09:18Z,this movie makes no chronological sense..he got his body burned in death race two..which gave birth to frakenstien...so HOW is he one win away and no burn scars?
,desuru,2013-01-09T09:24Z,"sahilrox,
can you clarify the naming convention more?  I thought webrip meant streamed video (which i thought was less than DVD quality) and 480p meant DVD.  
why is the sound on a webrip poor? "
,skulldragon,2013-01-09T09:30Z,"I'll simplify quality review:
On the simple scale of watchability / media quality: 9/10"
,kidlonewolf,2013-01-09T11:47Z,"Great up as always, but i have a question unrelated to this upload. What is the Fastest/best .zip password cracker, please and thank you EZ"
,skulldragon,2013-01-09T23:55Z,"@nicklouslingor
In the beginning of this movie, there was a lot of info about this. First there was a sentence ""fix my face"" and then somewhere an explanation that he didn't actually die, he got burned, but thankfully the host was filthy rich and gave him PLASTIC SURGERY.

Lack of concentration, bad screen size or poor speaker quality? How could you miss all of it?


@kidlonewolf
Machines get bigger and stronger, but making super fast and actually working crackers is condemned as ""helping out the criminals"" and FBI's party van will appear under your window. Only the government is allowed for sake of keeping the real terrorism alive and economy based on slavery going for several decades. So nobody, no developer on this planet, wants to build them for public.
But, there are some old apps left on the internet, like ARCHPR - you still need to have a government powered corporation, about 20 PCs, all supercomputers, to crack a 10 char long password in less than 3 weeks.

Russian IT specialists with an academic education could build faster ones, which can crack a 15 char long in 4 seconds on a regular i7. But you'd have to pay them hard cash, otherwise they'll tell you ""I don't support criminal activity, although I'm building a nuclear power plant in my basement. Thank god I went to a proper academy, which really teaches it all.""."
