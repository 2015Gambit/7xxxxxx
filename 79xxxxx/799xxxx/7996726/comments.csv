It's quite easy, even I know how to do it and I'm no expert. One of the worst encoders out. Thankfully there are decent encoders who do encode 5.1 DDigital and DTS. But i guess YIFI doesn't have a 5.1 system, doesn't care or just doesn't have very discerning hearing. Downvoting as usual :) Thanks."
