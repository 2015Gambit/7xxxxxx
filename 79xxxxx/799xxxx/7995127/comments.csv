Gonna also make yet another request to see if you can find these gems:

Chronicles of Wormwood: The Last Enemy (one shot)

and

Chronicles of Wormwood: The Last Battle  (6 issues mini series)


The only thing I could find here is the original Chronicles of wormwood series (also 6 issues), and I've been DYING to read more of it!"
,Hamster-X,2013-01-08T12:41Z,"Actually, I'm going to fulfill my own request lol. Managed to find them in some obscure DD page (some of the issues were also available in very old 0-day packs from ShipJ, but unfortunately without seeds)."
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-08T13:36Z,"good work! certain torrent sites return search results of individual comic titles, not just the torrent title. that's often helpful. i'd refer you to a good one, but the system here thinks that's a bad idea."
,Hamster-X,2013-01-08T23:43Z,"Let's do something then, contact me on this email:
