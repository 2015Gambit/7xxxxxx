I knew pretty much NOBODY liked the whole #700 nonsense, but to literally push the ""we can bail this out"" button on issue #1?!

Like I said in the #700 comments.. I give this 6 months... maybe a year.. before they push that reset button."

Of course Peter Parker is coming back! You must be all of 12 to think this is permanent. "
