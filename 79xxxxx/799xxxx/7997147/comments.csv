I love your taste in background music and instrumentals in your software cracks, so I was wanted to request that you compile every background music and instrumental you used in your past cracks into a custom collection torrent of MP3s or whatever audio format for download? Or at least your faves if there are too many? For example I love the one in your “WinZip PRO FINAL v15.0 + Serials [ChattChitto RG]” torrent but have no idea what the artist or song is. If you were to create such a compilation torrent, we could enjoy the music you’ve chosen as well as know who the artists are so that we could download more songs by them. I couldn’t join your forum site since we have to be invited to do so, so I’d appreciate a reply to my request here. I chose this torrent to make this request in because you just recently uploaded it and it has a lot of seeds, in case that increases the chances that you’ll end up seeing this comment. I’ll check back here for a reply over the next week, so please do reply.
Many thanks!"
