Join us in celebrating Lady Death's 20th anniversary year with an origins tale from the past masterfully spun by her creator, horror comics legend Brian Pulido! The tragic history and triumphant battles of the sword-wielding heroine, Lady Death, are revealed to comic fans through this new oversized mini-series finally completing her origin tale! Once an innocent girl from a noble household, Hope has sacrificed her humanity to become a deadly warrior and save her mother's captured soul. But it is here, in the pages of Cursed that she finally realizes her dark destiny, assuming the majesty of her new persona as Lady Death. But will her newfound glory be enough to confront the despot Sagos, a murderous warlock who wears her dead father's skin and threatens to conquer the Blacklands?
