Islam and Healing: Loss and Recovery of an Indo-Muslim Medical Tradition, 1600-1900 - 2010kaiser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This book traces the Islamic healing tradition's interaction with Indian society and politics as they evolved in tandem from 1600 to 1900, and demonstrates how an in-house struggle for hegemony can be as potent as external power in defining medical, social and national modernity. This isVa pioneering work on the social and medical history of Indian Islam.
