Today on this live Sunday, January 6, 2013 program, Alex Jones covers the latest in the ongoing efforts to dismantle the 2nd Amendment and the Constitution, including fresh confirmation that the Obama Administration has big designs on gun control despite his 2008 campaign pledge to 'not take guns.' 

Further, cities around the nation, including Austin, TX, are looking to reign in gun shows. 

Meanwhile, Alex is joined by Chief of Police Mark Kessler, who is proposing a '2nd Amendment Preservation' ordinance for his small town in Pennsylvania, which could serve as model legislation to uphold the right to bear arms and nullify unconstitutional gun control maneuvers across the country.
