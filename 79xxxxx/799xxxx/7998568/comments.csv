[T],blackcanary,2013-01-08T23:24Z,"I think I have all of Spider-Girl, but was going to verify the versions.  Feel free to upload the various Spider-Girl series. :)"
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-08T23:51Z,"Ok! However, I don't have the 2011 ""Spider-Girl"" Anya Corazon stuff. I think I have 1-4 and it lasted 8 issues. It's really an Arana title anyway, but if you happen to have it, you could post it."
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-09T00:29Z,"Oops nevermind, I just noticed it's already available on TPB. I upped my Spider-Girl torrent and linked mine with that one."
