Matt Howarth - WRAB Pirate Television

Howski Studios, 1985, 56 pages

Written and Illustrated by Matt Howarth

Funny, subversive, political and ahead of it's time. Some of the best work Matt has ever done, and it seems to have largely been forgotten. Do yourself a favor and check this one out. Just remember it was published in 1985.
