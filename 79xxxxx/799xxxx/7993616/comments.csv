[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-08T18:31Z,"I know right, we have to seed to a ratio of 10 to guarantee our torrents won't die due to hit and runs...even then a 10 ratio for the torrent isn't enough. :/"
[V],rr-ne,2013-01-08T22:15Z,"I didn't like when alot of users hit & run on my older torrents, which is why i dont upload anything else but The Simpsons season 24 episodes"
[V],psspss,2013-01-08T23:17Z,"if they just downloaders not uploaders liek us they should be seeding to 1.5 (a 1 to 1 ratio wont work)
cos its takes 1.5 for another person to get a complete file normally cos the other bits are seeded out to others in the process of grabbing

this is why the idea of private trackers works with ratio watch however they chagre and make much money from memberships the downside
not just running costs covering

anyhow we got there in the end.. cost me more data though but now Im down to 7gb to last another 11 days :/"
[V],psspss,2013-01-08T23:20Z,"cos TPB was down at the time I had it up on the KAT

I didnt notice other xvids up here cos I couldnt search


and it havent propagated to the other search engines from their spydering so seemed no one had converts up so sharing my version was a bit of a waste also"
