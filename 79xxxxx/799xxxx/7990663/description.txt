Editorial Reviews
All Music Guide - James Christopher Monger
As the daughter of folk music giants Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright 
III and sister to chamber pop auteur Rufus Wainwright, drama student 
turned singer/songwriter Martha Wainwright is no stranger to the business. 
Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole -- an image best not taken literally -- is her 
first release since 1997's eponymous EP, and if it's any indication of the soon 
to be released full-length -- also eponymous -- it heralds the coming of yet 
another original voice from one of music's most dependable gene pools. 
Wainwright's husky voice has matured into a thing of real beauty, and her 
ability to sound both majestic and totally wrecked helps to humanize each 
track -- especially the title cut -- without sacrificing any of the volatile 
confidence that fuels lines like "Poetry has no place for a heart's that's a 
whore." Unlike her showier brother, her arrangements are simple and 
stripped down, lending weight to her femme fatale lyricism and wry 
introspection. Wainwright is obviously an old soul -- she cracks like Bonnie 
Tyler, breezes over notes like Bj√∑rk and croons with the kind of weary 
sensuality that most artist's don't discover until their golden years -- but her 
style is just as informed by contemporaries like PJ Harvey and Cat Power as it 
is by Patsy Cline, and when she says jump, the listener's immediate response 
is "how high?"
