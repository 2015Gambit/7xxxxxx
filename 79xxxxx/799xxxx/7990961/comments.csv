,michaelrwatson,2013-01-05T21:54Z,"@EnemyDrone: MKV is an inferior file format that is created by morons like charlesfire22. It is non-standard and many players won't play it properly.

Please create MP4 instead, fuktards. Thanx."
,n0man-b,2013-01-06T00:49Z,"Considering a DVDSCR
A: 8 / V: 8"
,ecchiless,2013-01-06T04:33Z,"@michael

ur so stupid, mkv is a container the x264 is the format xDDD, and inferior to mp4? yea sure xDDDD"
,1EdgyGuy,2013-01-06T06:55Z,"Thank You Sir ,this is a real deal SCREENER and a Perfect one ! ""for your concideration"" is in it occasionally and in 2 parts but I rate it 
V=10  1080p. Bluray Quality
A=10 
M=10 if you like bloody westerns alot of graphic shooting and payback (which I do)
Again Thank You Ul'er"
,nba4me,2013-01-06T10:52Z,"Thanks. Just checked first part and audio sync isn't a problem. 
A : 9  V : 9 amazing quality for 575mb."
,jalucian,2013-01-07T09:36Z,"michaelrwatson, you're the fucking idiot. like ecchiles said, mkv is not a FORMAT at all, you ignorant ponce - it's merely a container. x264 is the format and both mp4 and mkv support the x264 format. Not to mention that mkv is actually a SUPERIOR container considering that mp4 does not support soft-coded subtitles, chapter marks, and several other features and mkv does. The only people who whine about mkv are the kids who live in mom's basement that only watch their movies on Xbox or PS3 because these are the ONLY things mkv isnt supported by. VLC supports mkv just fine, which is what grown-ups use. What a fucking tool."
,jalucian,2013-01-07T09:38Z,"Sorry I didnt notice until after my first comment, but he isn't the only idiot here. Edgyguy, 1080p is a RESOLUTION, not a quality. And since the original source here is just standard DVD and in 480p at that, this is NOT bluray quality and DEFINITELY not 1080p. 

Why do so many fucking people have absolutely NO idea what they're talking about?"
,muveluvr,2013-01-07T19:42Z,thank you jalucian you took most word right out of my mouth i love mkv its small and plays great on vlc out to big screen and with great vid quality and small file size download/seed faster
,1EdgyGuy,2013-01-08T07:28Z,"@jalucian i am no idiot resolution is measured
and to me for the sz. of this mkv version it is as clear as 1080p. so shut ur fattt face.Or are you some professor teaching pirateing 101 ? Honestly Professor wanna-be you're the tool !
V=10
A=10
M=10 "
,BostonAl2012,2013-01-08T07:52Z,"Michael Watson is still a DOUCHE MKV and M4V are practically the same code?

For computer/htpc playback I use/prefer mkv. Works great on PLEX/ROKU too..."
,BostonAl2012,2013-01-08T07:57Z,"Michael Watson is still a DOUCHE!

MKV and M4V are equal containers and both play well on PLEX AND ROKU...  Not much difference.

Surprising that you are so well liked??????  NOT!"
,RTT2,2013-01-08T11:13Z,"michaelrwatson is a notorious troll who repeatedly flamed one uploader for encoding on-screen tags and adverts, when in fact it was just the subtitle track, which of course he could have just disabled. Ignore him."
,ZamKhan,2013-01-08T18:57Z,"Thanks buddy really good audio and video quality

A-8
V-8

[T],MelloYello,2013-01-09T00:22Z,I just read some comments.  Why is there all this talk of mp4 and mkv?  Charlesfire22 always uploads in mp4.  If you look at the top where it says files.  Click on that and it tells you what files are in the torrent.
,NeronLux,2013-01-10T19:35Z,"Very good Quality for this size,Thanx..."
