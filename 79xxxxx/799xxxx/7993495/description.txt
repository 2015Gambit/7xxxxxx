Southern Knights features a team of heroes operating in the Southern USA.  The first issue of Southern Knights was called The Crusaders, but a trademark issue arose with Archie's Mighty Crusaders, so with the second issue the series was renamed Southern Knights. This was explained within the story by the heroes hitting a similar trademark issue and discovering another hero team in their universe is already called Crusaders.
