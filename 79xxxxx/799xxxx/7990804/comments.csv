Nice quality, but this movie SUCKS BALLS!! This idiotic movie makes Blazing Saddles look like 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly'. In reality it's just another opportunity for Tarantino to rewrite history so it pleases the PC police and use the word 'nigger' as many times as he possibly can on film."

,sugarpuffextreme,2013-01-06T05:51Z,"@Charlton-Heston You are doing it wrong. You need to take the opinion of a large populous then average it.

Once mans rating don't mean shit because opinions on movies are subjective, not objective.
Some people like to stare at the wall for 3 hours, other like to stare at shawshank redemtion and a wall and shawshank redemtion are different.

,nbmatt,2013-01-07T04:39Z,"I'm loving how this movie has forced the overly-sensitive inbred hicks out of the woodwork to complain about how anti-white it is. It seems anti-white because it takes place in the fucking American South a few years before the Civil War. Were you all (meaning the aforementioned inbred hicks) under the impression that plantation owners and slave traders regularly gave slaves chocolate and bubble baths? That slaves were justly compensated with monetary wage and reasonable working conditions?

Slaves were considered property. Like Calvin Candie says, ""Broomhilda is my property, and I can choose to do with my property whatever I desire."" This was the dominant understanding of slave code throughout the lands in which slavery was legal, and this is why, as Gunslinger5001 feels the need to cry about, ""all the white people are evil slave owning county folk who rape black women."" It doesn't matter what color they are: Anyone that feels they have ownership of a human life is evil and those people did to their property whatever they desired, which included rape, even though there was no rape in this movie that I can remember.

Most importantly, though, is the fact that the other fucking main protagonist is white (and German) and the final fucking antagonist is a black slave, which completely shatters this entire ""anti-white"" arguments the inbreds like to circle jerk over. "

Very typical Q.T. Film in many aspects... There are many reviews on here that led me to believe the movie would be awful, but it wasn't... Yes there is a lot of blood, typical Tarentino with silly sound effects and over the top B.S. But there is a good story here and there are a few twists I didn't expect... Not for the faint of heart, but definitely worth a peek... Especially since it is here and not at the theater. Great job by juggs99... Props to you on a great piece of work... Thanks for the movie!
