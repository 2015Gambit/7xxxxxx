[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-09T01:00Z,"You're welcome teezmepeas, and no, Life #26 is supposed to come out tomorrow.

While I was looking, I copied the other Archie releases for tomorrow. They are: Archie #640, Archie and Friends Double Digest #23, Betty and Veronica Prom Princesses TPB, Jughead's Double Digest #188, Mega Man #21, New Crusaders Rise Of The Heroes #5, Sonic The Hedgehog #244

I have no idea when any of these will be scanned, but I'll remember to post Life #26 here if I see it anywhere."
