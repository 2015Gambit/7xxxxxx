It is very odd that they got Kristin Scott Thomas to act in this film who is English but did not foresee that Anglophones might be interested in watching it. So - no English subtitles available anywhere...

It is odder still that not even French subtitles are available. Do the film makers hate deaf people? If so why? Maybe there are no deaf French people. If so, is that a genetic trait or a triumph of the French health care system? 

Maybe the film makers just don't give a damn. Yes, that must be it. That is the likeliest motive ""je-m'en-foutisme"". 

Merci les franĂ§ais, pour avoir, encore une fois, justifiĂŠ la mauvaise opinion que les anglais ont de vous."
