Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, January 7 edition of the Alex Jones Show, veteran fill-in guest host Mike Adams "The Health Ranger," editor for NaturalNews.com, fills in for Alex. 

Mike will continue to break down the war being waged on the Second Amendment from both sides of the political divide, and spells out the real agenda behind what gun grabbers are presenting as a public safety concern. 

On today's show, Mike welcomes Pulitzer Prize nominated author and lecturer Jon Rappoport to discuss how patient prescription drug records may be used to deny purchase of firearms. 

Mike also welcomes Mark Baker of Bakers Green Acres, the Michigan farmer facing prosecution for owning pigs with "feral" distinctions.
