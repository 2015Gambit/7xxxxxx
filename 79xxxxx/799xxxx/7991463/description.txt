Storyline:
In a place soon to be known as The Valley of Death, in a football field-sized clearing called landing zone X-Ray,
Lt. Colonel Hal Moore and 400 young troopers from the elite newly formed American 7th "Air" Cavalry,
were surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers dug into the tunnel warren mountainside.
The ensuing battle was one of the most savage in U.S. history and is portrayed here as the signal encounter between the American and North Vietnamese armies.
We Were Soldiers Once... And Young is a tribute to the nobility of those men under fire, their common acts of uncommon valor, and their loyalty to and love for one another.
