04/27/97 Memorial Auditorium, Burlington, VT
1: It Ain't No Use > Aunt Avis > Travelin' Light, Stop-Go > Wondering, Heroes > Greta > Pickin' Up The Pieces > Conrad
2: Ain't Life Grand, Sleeping Man, Mercy > Who Do You Belong To?, Tall Boy > Arleen, Airplane > Do What You Like > Drums > Space Wrangler
E: End Of The Show > Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys
[Last verse of 'Stop-Go' performed to the rhythm of 'Wondering'; 'End Of The Show' began JB solo on mandolin; 'Jingo' jam before 'Space Wrangler'; 'I Wish' tease by Dave during 'Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys'; From Good Homes opened]"
