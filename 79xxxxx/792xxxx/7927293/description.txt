"Detonation." Berlin, formerly an island city encased in a concrete reef, a victim of an East/West loggerhead. Today, it's a thriving metropolis. One that shortly will find itself under siege! A terrorist group plans to systematically exterminate high-ranking British, German and Russian intelligence operatives...unless Miranda Zero exterminates them first.
