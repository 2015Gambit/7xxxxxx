In the 1940s, when blistering bebop scorched the American musical earth,
traditional jazz was shunted to the sidelines, its players and fans
scornfully dubbed "moldy figs." But "Dixieland", in its purest form the
cornerstone of jazz, carried on and, indeed, experienced something of a
revival on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1950s and early '60s. this set
includes some of America's legends of classic jazz - Louis Armstrong, Jack
Teagarden, Red Allen, Kid Ory, and George Lewis - plus two outstanding New
Orleans ensembles, The Original Tuxedo "Jass" Band and Dejan's Original
Olympia Brass Band. Eddie Condon, trad jazz's chief advocate, leads a group
of all-stars who cut their teeth on the sounds of New Orleans; Condon's
longtime associate Max Kaminsky does likewise. Rounding out these
high-spirited proceedings are some of Great Britain's leading revivalists -
Ken Colyer, Alex Welsh, Monty Sunshine, Mr. Acker Bilk, Terry Lightfoot,
Chris Barber, and Humphrey Lyttelton. They carried teh classic jazz torch
to the British pop charts just before the Beatles exploded.
