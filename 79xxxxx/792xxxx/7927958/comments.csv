I will try desmume but it lags so bad. no$gba is much smoother. "

,snuggypoo,2012-12-21T21:58Z,"sorry about my other comment. I got it to work by using desmume 0.9.6. (x64)

It's much faster than 0.9.8

There is still an occasional problem where I enter a building and my character turns into a black box, but it's resolved once I restart (without saving)

Also, make sure not to use too many cheats or it will mess it up. 

Great excellent mod, my favorite pokemon game to date."
