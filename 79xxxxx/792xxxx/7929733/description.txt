Positively exhausted after taxing his powers to the limit in order to erase a fire in Clifden, and dejected after losing his telepathy in the recent "psi-pulse", Nate Grey isolates himself in an inn in Dublin and rests there for six days. Madelyne Pryor tracks him down, worried about his well-being since her existence relies exclusively upon Nate's condition. Madelyne motivates him to get active again, but refuses to teleport him to the X-Men's mansion, to enquire them of the recent "psi-pulse". The pair quickly finds out about a series of murders in Dublin, in which the killer drains the life out of the victims' bodies, leaving behind skeletal cadavers. Nate and Maddie investigate the crime scene and sense energy signatures that belong to someone from the Age of Apocalypse reality. Nate fears he may be blacking out and committing the murders himself, before he and Maddie ambush the true culprit, just as he launches another attack on humans ΓÇô and come face to face with a creature that wears the facial features of Nate himself! In Clifden, Ness laments losing Nate out of his hands and having to track him down again.
