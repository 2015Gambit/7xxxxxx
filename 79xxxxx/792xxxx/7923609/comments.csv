,Narcozy,2012-12-15T10:58Z,Install fail (division by zero error) if not installing on system disc. Maybe it's just something with my system? Thanx esharoth for up.
[T],esharoth,2012-12-15T12:43Z,"Exactly when do you get that error and on what OS? I'm not able to reproduce it on my two PCs, with Windows 7 and XP.

Also, I probably should have mentioned the following in the torrent description:

Suitable only for players aged 18 and over. Contains flashing imagery, violence, nudity & bad language. "
,Narcozy,2012-12-15T17:38Z,"using ulti 7 sp1. installed on system disc, no problem so far. "
,bzilla82,2012-12-15T19:22Z,Is anyone else having trouble playing this in fullscreen?  Mine only works windowed.

Btw anyone who have played this or will play it try the previous game ""Downfall"". It's deserved title ""masterpice"" for indie games. "
