A you guys do relize this is the patch that lowers the damage of weapons and lowers stats of shields, like the Bee shield losses 20k damage, so back up your saves because it alters all saves even if you do not load the game save. 
Other alterations are: Boss health drasticaly increased.
Qwest rewards fixed.
And No special drops from boss in certain cases.

If your someone that already does not update things to keep things running you will understand this Sentence, Do not use this update until it has bin cracked and is nessecary for a DLC.

Read the reviews in youtube before useing this update."

,pickledbeets,2012-12-31T05:39Z,"I'm running Win x64 with SKIDROW B2 + all DLCs. I could get the Launcher up without a problem, but clicking ""Run"" gave me an hourglass for a moment...and then nothing. 

After doing a bit of research, I solved my problem by installing the Steam client (which I didn't have previously). 

I have no idea if it matters, but I'll add that I created an account, logged in, and tried to start the game without success. I had to *exit* the client (right-click on the system tray STEAM icon to select exit), and then start the game again. No problem that time. Weird, right?"
,ijam_j,2013-01-05T15:10Z,this update cause none of my dlc to work. had to fresh reinsstall borderland to be able to play properly.
