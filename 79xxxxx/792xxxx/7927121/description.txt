If you love to street race while blasting J-pop anime music, you're going to have to get yourself a PS3. The latest issue of Famitsu has a
first look at Initial D Extreme Stage, a PS3 version of the Japanese racer that's known in arcades as Initial D Arcade Stage 4. In addition
to a visual update, the big new feature for the home is an online racing mode. Similar to the arcade version's "National Tournament"
mode, players can rise in class by beating other racers and gain access to even tougher opponent classes.The arcade version also let
online players customize their characters. Sega hasn't announced this for the home version yet, but it sounds like a likely feature to us!
Solo drivers can look forward to an updated version of the arcade's single player mode, Koudou Saisoku Densetsu (this name translates
to something along the lines of "Legend of the Fastest on the Road'' ) . Over 20 rivals will appear in this story mode, which uses the PS3
for high quality shading. Initial D hits Japan this Summer. An international release has yet to be announced.
