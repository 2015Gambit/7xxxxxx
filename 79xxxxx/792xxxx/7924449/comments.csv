,mwalsher,2012-12-15T23:30Z,"What the heckâ&#x20AC;˝ Is this automated or something? How exactly does that even work? I can understand automating the recording, and even the conversion, but what about removing commercials? I guess they donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t even watch the shows then huh? :-"
,bickybiky,2012-12-16T03:11Z,This is not S3E12 of Haven rather an episode from eureka

I wondered the exact same. I rip many shows for personal use and use a commercial remover, but it requires human invention to tweak it nearly 100% of the time. 

If they can really fully automate commercial removal 100% reliably, I want that more than the next episode. "
