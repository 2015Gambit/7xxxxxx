Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about ubiquitous surveillance state "smart" technology as the police state integrates itself into all aspects of our lives. 

Alex also covers the latest moves against Syria as the U.S. military sends Patriot missile batteries and soldiers to Turkey. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes back Larry Grathwohl, a FBI informant who was undercover with the Weatherman and subsequently revealed plans by the Marxist terrorist group to kill millions of Americans.
