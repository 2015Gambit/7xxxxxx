Minecraft 1.4.2 with Feed the Beast 1.1 [FEarBG] (currently Beta A)


::: What Is This ? :::

If you want my explanation, this is the new Tekkit. If you do not know what "Tekkit" is, well you will have to learn a lot about this game.


THIS IS CRACKED VERSION! TOTALLY FREE THANKS TO "SILKOOY"!


Here is some Wiki info :

Feed the Beast is a modpack for the game Minecraft. It adds a huge number of items, recipes and world-generation to the game, and is used in the YouTube series "Feed the Beast." The modpack centers on several famous mods such as IndustrialCraft and BuildCraft but the full list is extensive. All of the mods in the pack have been approved by the modders to be included. The FTB launcher was released on Saturday, Nov. 10, 2012, with a live-stream broadcast on the Feed The Beast website. The launcher currently features a work-in-progress version of the Feed the Beast modpack. The official modpack release is TBD and will most likely launch once RedPower 2, Thaumcraft 3, Equivalent Exchange 3 and XyCraft are all fully updated and stable.



::: Instalation :::

Ultra simple. Just run the setup and click next a few times. Do not forget to create a desktop icon.



::: Important :::

Install JAVA 7 : http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp

I made a small change in the main Feed the Beast launcher and now it will not let you play unless you have Java 7.


The cracked Feed The Beast 1.1 launcher it's not created by me. I took it from "silkooy" (another TPB user). Check out his account for new versions.
