DO NOT UPDATE!!!

Otherwise it will download the new non-cracked launcher and you need a premium account to play."
,Richterx8,2012-12-15T20:36Z,I get the same issue as Silkooy's upload
,FEarBG,2012-12-15T21:16Z,"@Richterx8

Which is ?"
,Richterx8,2012-12-15T21:50Z,@FEarBG Crashing on the black screen.
,Richterx8,2012-12-16T00:39Z,lol pardon that was a bit vague when I launch FTB and it goes to the mojang screen it crashes 
,FEarBG,2012-12-16T07:24Z,"@Richterx8

Inject every file from ""MinecraftForge.zip"" inside your ""minecraft.jar"". Then remove the ""MinecraftForge.zip"" from ""instMods"". This should fix your problem."
,ARandomIdiot,2012-12-21T21:36Z,"@FEarBG hey, I did everything you mentioned above but now my game won't even launch. Whenever I click the launch button, all the windows for the game disappear. Any ideas on how to fix this?"
,ARandomIdiot,2012-12-22T02:48Z,"ignore that, i got it to work lol"
,FEarBG,2012-12-22T16:02Z,"@godboy777

This launcher is actually good for nothing, and the user wants to make money with adfly links. So I recommend to ignore him.

If you really want to play portable Minecraft, use MiltiMC..."
,eyereign,2013-01-02T08:04Z,"Hey FEarBG, been some time since Minecraft 1.2.5 with DNS TechPack I downloaded from you.  Enjoying your FTB 1.1 at the moment!  Excellent at always.  Any future cracked Direwolf20 Pack from FTB coming?  (Tried downloading that pack through the FTB launcher many times.)"
,eyereign,2013-01-02T08:16Z,"Hi FEarBG, still enjoying your Dire DNS 1.2.5, and now your FTB 1.1!  Excellent work!  Been trying to download FTB Direwolf mod pack through their cracked 1.1.7 launcher, but failed many times.  Assuming server lag and what not.  Any future cracked FTB Direwolf 1.4.6 mod packs coming? =)"
,eyereign,2013-01-02T08:17Z,"Crap, got caught commenting twice!  NOOB!"
,FEarBG,2013-01-02T18:42Z,"@eyereign

Since there are already another torrent with only the launcher for 1.1.7 and they have much more seed, I thought that nobody needs another pre-download pack.

Anyway, if you still have this problem you can write in my forum where I can give you download links, since many of them are banned here in TPB."
,eyereign,2013-01-03T05:05Z,True true about the 1.1.7 launcher...ok I will contact you.  Thx FEarBG!
