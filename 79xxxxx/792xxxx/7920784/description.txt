Discover the modern versatility of the classic silhouette. The bold lines and strong contrasts of the silhouette are no longer limited to flat, two-color portraits to be hung on the family room wall. In Silhouette Style, silhouette designs take on color, dimension and the 21st Century. Nanetta Bananto teaches you to bring papercuts to life in more than 40 projects incorporating her beautiful, original designs. Create tea-light lanterns, gift boxes, cards, paper dolls and fashion accessories using papercut designs in themes such as sea life, animals, flowers and fashion.

The book includes:
-    Step-by-step instructions for 21 stylish projects and more than 20 variations easily created using the same techniques and designs
-    Tips and techniques on how to cut designs either by hand or using an electronic die-cutting machine
-    A CD-ROM containing all of the cutting design files needed to create the projects, plus bonus designs to expand your creative possibilities
