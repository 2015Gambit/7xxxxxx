,netmafia,2012-12-18T04:55Z,Anyone here has torrent for Super Robot Taisen XO ?
,Vysaga,2012-12-18T14:16Z,"netmafia, tbh, I really doubt it. Couldn't find anything in Chinese/Japanese Torrent/Emule networks. Hopefully someone will share it at some point.
And just as a note, Super Robot Taisen XO is practically a remake of Super Robot Taisen GC.
I still hope that it will be found, nonetheless."
