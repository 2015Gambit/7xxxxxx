,DngnRdr,2012-12-25T12:16Z,I can't seem to find internal 352p of 2x06 and 2x10. Any help would be appreciated?
,DngnRdr,2012-12-25T19:19Z,"Nevermind, I found them... 2x06 was the one that was incorrectly upped as INT.Mini.272p and 2x10 you named INT352p instead of INTERNAL.352p so it didn't come up in my earlier searches.

Thanks for this series.. nowhere near as good as season 1 but still a good show. Thanks"

Belated apology for the file search snafu. I surely wish searches covered actual filenames as well as the posted title.

The problem, of course is fitting those eight great tomatos in that little bitty can.

Which is to say - sometimes 64 characters just isn't enough. And then Oliver Stone hogs the whole thing with just the title - no room for ""xvid"" or ""avi"" at all. Tried shortening ""United States"" to ""US"", but I'm sure there are those who missed me just for that.

Anyway, glad you got past the aggravation to the meaty center. Hope it was as tasty to eat as it was to cook.
