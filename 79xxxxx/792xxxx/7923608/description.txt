Military rule and the martial tradition of the samurai dominated Japanese culture for more than eight hundred years. According to Thomas ClearyΓÇötranslator of more than thirty-five classics of Asian philosophyΓÇöthe Japanese people have been so steeped in the way of the warrior that some of the manners and mentality of this outlook remain embedded in their individual and collective consciousness. Cleary shows how well-known attributes such as the reserve and mystery of formal Japanese behavior are deeply rooted in the ancient strategies of the traditional arts of war. Citing original Japanese sources that are popular among Japanese readers today, he reveals the hidden forces behind Japanese attitudes and conduct in political, business, social, and personal life.
