Malaysian Indian Ethnic Cleansing 

The lawyer-turned activist said ethnic Indians here were by and large ΓÇÿfear riddled, timid and scaredΓÇÖ, but the largest ever demonstration by the community last month showed that they wanted to be free from years of oppression and be heard. 

"To me it is 50 years of marginalisation, suppression and oppression. It has been years of permanent colonisation of Indians in Malaysia. The floodgates just broke with the demonstration," Uttayakumar said. 

Sitting behind a desk piled up with files and with the statuette of a blindfolded woman carrying scales of justice, Uttayakumar said the government was persecuting Hindraf for leading the protest. "That is why they are persecuting and prosecuting Hindraf supporters," the lawyer said as his phones continuously rang. 

He defended his statement about "ethnic cleansing of Indians in Malaysia" which had sparked angry reaction from the ruling party saying the situation was worse than the one in Bosnia where members of a community were selectively killed. 

"In ethnic cleansing 'a la Malaysia' it is worse because you are living and suffering," Uttayakumar said.
