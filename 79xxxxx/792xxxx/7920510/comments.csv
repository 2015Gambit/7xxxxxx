It's good"
,MedicareScott,2012-12-14T14:52Z,This is only a 1 minute clip.  Can you upload the whole episode please?
,rocket76,2012-12-14T15:57Z,If it downloads as a .rar file all you need to do is extract it. Only takes a few seconds and the entire episode is ready to play.  Excellent quality and sound. Thanks Luke!   
,MedicareScott,2012-12-14T17:48Z,How do you make it an rar file?
,elveljung,2012-12-14T18:08Z,Thanks m8 and to all you others out there that keep uploading. It probably takes up alot of time and for that iÂ´am truely grateful. 
,MedicareScott,2012-12-14T18:14Z,How do you do that?
,rocket76,2012-12-14T20:46Z,You don't make it a rar file. That's just how it downloads...at least for me it did. All you do is right click and select 'extract' and it's ready to play within seconds. 
,Random-User,2012-12-15T22:42Z,"google WinRAR, DL it and install. Otherwise, source a cracked copy.

Double click on one of the RAR files in the torrent DL and then drag-n-drop the video file to the desktop or a folder of your choice. Done.

RAR's are actually a good thing if upped by reputable uppers, it allows repair and re-download of just a possible damaged file rather than whole download."
