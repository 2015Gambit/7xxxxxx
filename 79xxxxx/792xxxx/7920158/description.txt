Brent Smith (Shinedown) in his first band, Blind Thought, around the age of 16.  Originally a tape (maybe 500 produced in total), extremely rare (try finding it yourself if you don't believe me) with just a few known cassettes still in existence and some tracks on Youtube.  Consisted of seven (7) songs, including "Silent Goodbye" dedicated to their friend, Brandon Wantland, who died in a car accident.

Tracks Include:

01. Consider
02. Walk Through the Door
03. You're The Reason
04. Hillbilly Rock
05. Screwdriver
06. Sad
07. Silent Goodbye

Also includes cover and original back cover of cassette case *[picture pulled from listing of a copy that was on sale on eBay]

Did my best to clean up the audio, MUCH better then the original sound files I had got my hands on.

If you have any suggestions for further improving the audio, please let me know.

SUPER RARE!  PLEASE SEED!

Enjoy!
