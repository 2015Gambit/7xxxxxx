A documentary film about the extraordinary life of a famous, musical prodigy who has been battling against Lou GehrigΓÇÖs Disease for 22 years. A paralyzing, terminal illness with no real treatment or cure, it has trapped Jason inside of his body for over 15 years; unable to move, unable to speak, and unable to play the instrument which propelled him to international stardom at just 19 years of age.

Using an eye communication system invented by his father, Jason is able to escape the confines of his own body and release the music that is trapped inside of his mind.

This documentary also features interesting interviews with long-time friend and co-member of Cacophony, Marty Friedman, as well as Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Richie Kotzen, and Steve "The Deacon" Hunter.
