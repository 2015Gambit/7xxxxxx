,bjornagainswede,2012-12-18T22:16Z,"Dudes... The Seeder hasn't a clue! MAde 2 major mess-ups in 1) Not Superseeding the torrent from the off and 2) Not hanging around until the seed ration had reached 1.25 - i.e. had generated a healthy amount of seeds to continue seeding!

I plain gave up on this yesterday - if you have JDownloader and an IP address you can reset at will you can download the lot in less than 24 hours on an 8Mb connection. Hope someone will do and just replace the torrent file with the unpacked mo-gatgoty.dmg file

Should work... and then just plain seed. One of the slowest torrents I've seen in a few years this!"
,ray0508,2012-12-19T11:52Z,cmon guys just a lil more seeding
