100 Cases in Clinical Medicine is an indispensable revision tool for medical students preparing for clinical examinations or OSCEs. Using scenarios which mimic daily life, the cases will interest students in clinical problems and help them develop their clinical reasoning skills, with each case presenting details of a patient's medical history and the key findings of a clinical examination, together with initial investigation results for evaluation.

Description
Key questions then prompt the student to evaluate the patient, and reach a decision regarding their condition and the possible management plan, while the answer pages will help the student to understand the processes that a clinician goes through in dealing with the problems presented. Contents are organised to provide a quick review of each body system, with a selection of cases relevant to that specific system, then the majority are presented randomly to mimic real life in a GP surgery or emergency department.
