,mooserocka,2012-12-15T20:38Z,BOOOO this is the only thing you uploaded i did not like daman. O well maybe new generation of kids under age 10 can see it and be like who is mew and mewtoo. This not in my new pokemon lol. 
,AquaPigmyNinja,2012-12-16T02:04Z,"@mooserocka Shut the fuck up. 

Awesome upload. "
,chrisluigi,2012-12-16T02:33Z,"If this is dual-audio and includes Japanese, does that mean it includes all the footage from the version of this movie that was cut for the U.S. release (the stuff that only exists in Japanese)?"
,hutness,2012-12-16T02:44Z,"Thanks for all your hard work, Daman! 
Any chance for Fate/Zero 14-25 either 720p or 1080p bluray? "
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-16T05:29Z,This is the Official Japanese Box Release which brings Movies from 1998-2010 
,xenoFLASH,2012-12-16T13:05Z,"This is a great movie. Thank you for bring back a little something from my youth. 
Also, mooserocka seems to have been checked into the ER from inbibing five gallons of cum."
,chrisluigi,2012-12-16T19:31Z,"It's definitely the original Japanese version (with all the original content intact), meaning there's more content here than in the U.S. release. I'm surprised that 4Kids decided to cut all the beginning context with Ai out. It's pretty good and makes the story much stronger in terms of Mewtwo's lust for revenge."
,mooserocka,2012-12-16T23:06Z,hey aqua how about no. Im gonna give my opinion with everything if you dont like it then dont say ne thing and go back to the cokfest you call life. Other then that I have a deep seeded hatred of the pokemon series. Especially how ash in like 500 epidodes in the original series with 151 pokemon only caught like 10 pokemon. And he gave away primeape so like 9 pokemon. Just not a good series. I did not even like it as a kid. You write comments do give feedback on an upload i HATE this one so i said it. Does it mean i have anything against anyone no i just give my opinion about one anime. I have liked ALL the others.
,mooserocka,2012-12-16T23:12Z,and to xeno you also are an waste of life. Chris 4 kids cut EVERYTHING from everything. They are a horrible company. I dont see how pokemon could have ANY more of a story but i agree they cut out way too much. I also heard yugioh and cardcaptors sakura were WAY better shows without 4 kids ruining them. If this is the original thats cool like i said before in my other comments i bet the new kids have no clu who mew or mewtoo is so maybe they should give it a watch. I dont care what daman uploads since he is doing us a huge favor. I will just ALWAYS comment on it good or bad. ITs all opinion some IDIOTS like the two jerk of$ i named dont understand that. 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-17T01:05Z,"Moose, as i said this is the original Jap version, there is nothing cut dude."
,xenoFLASH,2012-12-17T01:39Z,@mooserocka: There is nothing to be ashamed about. Many people have to use the ER.
,AquaPigmyNinja,2012-12-17T03:08Z,"@mooserocka I'm sure your mother can help you through the recovery after the ER, she has been through the same procedure on more than one occasion. "
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-17T03:47Z,Mooserocka: instigating arguments with the community since 1968.
,bigwhiteguy88,2012-12-17T08:53Z,I'm not ashamed to admit it. I still cry like a bitch at this movie. Will you upload baka ant test season 2?
,xX_xXx_Xx,2012-12-17T14:47Z,Hello Daman!!! I totally love your uploads 
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-18T13:12Z,"whatever im not into fights anymore but when mooserocka like made this MOE comment it made me laugh maybe moose will make 100s of accounts to made him win the comment .Lol Lol Lol and  the person who supports daman the most doesnt like his uploads such a terrible creature 

Hey im like LMFAO  in this"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-18T15:45Z,"I hate to be a killjoy, but you're no better than Mooserocka, Animelife. Stop provoking him."
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-18T17:02Z,Okay Lost_Leaf i guess i went overboard with my own selfishness by provoking him .Im sorry mooserocka for provoking you i am truly sorry please i dont want to make fight but yeah whatever sorry its just that youve been always supporting daman and shit
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-18T17:03Z,@ Lost_Leaf whats your email address or other accounts please im begging you please
,mooserocka,2012-12-19T03:08Z,I think you misunderstood what i said daman. Someone said something about 4 kids cutting. I only AGREEd that 4 kids cuts everything i know this was uncut. I still hate pokemon that was my stance on it. Cut or not i wont watch. I then gave examples how 4 kids ruins anime i never complaine about this being cut or uncut.
,mooserocka,2012-12-19T03:11Z,And anime life you were the one that made a100 accounds you jiz bag. I wouldnt be suprized if once again these were all accounts that you made up again you looser. 
,mooserocka,2012-12-19T03:14Z,Honestly xeno and piggy are probobly just you anime life making up names again. You admited to it what looser does that seriously. And if not my mom is dead so can you come up with better jokes. really IDIOTS.
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-19T05:14Z,"hey mooserocka im not making 100s of account and ask them for your self you cant see the diffrents do you .and i said sorry so beat it kay  and i swear to god that xeno and pig is not my accounts were not mine .


im guessing your misunderstand me moose i admit the comment its the fun niest comment you ever made so stop saying midfing all the time i said im sorry and im not making more accountss !! .Whatever  i should have ingnored you with a question mark to get your treatment .And pig and xeno probably look at our old old old fights and knew bout the mom business and etc 

So dont go arround and saiying stuff that you dont know MOOSE"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-19T05:15Z,????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ingnored 
,mooserocka,2012-12-19T14:32Z,No not ignored even though i should. I just am barely on my computer i have a life im on to check my e-mails and see if daman puts up more anime that is it. I only said something to you casue you chimed in. REally pigy lol wow the name itself is just so gay to even write atleast xeno is normal. hes still a re re but yea. To lost leaf sir you said to anime your just as bad as mooserocka? what makes me bad other then having an opinion about an anime sir. Im not the ones that say vulgar idiotic things like these other jerk wads. All i say is my opinion about an anime series thats waht comments are supposed to be about either to give your opinion or state the quality of the upload. Or just to thank the uploader. I never have provoked anyone without ever getting said something horrible too first. 
,mooserocka,2012-12-19T14:36Z,Also anime life i did misunderstand what you said and im sorry for that. I was just mad thats all. Your right i ALWAYS support daman cause hes awesome but i like the anime he puts out. This time i did not my opinion prob doesnt matter to him but im giving feedback i think he should know what his fans like and dont like. Apparently alot of people do like it and just because they do you dont see me comming at thier dead mothers and freaking out on them its an opinion there is no wrong awnswer geez. Once again sorry anime life for misunderstanding.
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-19T17:47Z,mooserocka im sorry  im really sorry for this terrible comment of mine  present and past .i provoke you and i was wrong . im was mad too you know
,ob1192,2012-12-19T21:24Z,If this is the original japp version. While you watch it dubbed does the japp scenes stay? 
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-20T11:37Z,"10/10 for video & audio. 

It has an intro that goes for about 10:40 that wasn't in the initial version that I watched all those years ago; backstory on Mew Two before he became who he was. 

The only thing missing is the Pikachu's Vacation 21-minute short. 

The whole movie--if played on the English track--will be in English for the entirety of its duration. Nothing is out of sync. "
,mooserocka,2012-12-20T21:00Z,Ok anime life we are good.I totally misundersttod what you said while i was mad from the otheridiots  but aqua pig lmao your name is just that horrible and xeno you should just keep your idiotic statements to yourself. I know you 2 prob have fun blowin each other but cmon keep your love lives private. WE dont need to hear what you two lunkheads do on your own time. Now if you think something i said was wrong DEBATE it like a normal human not say stupid shit especially about someones dead mother. Something is wrong with you scum. So what i dont like it its my opinion im intitled to it. I love everything else daman put out well not bleach but thats only cause im annoyed at it. lol
,xenoFLASH,2012-12-21T13:56Z,"What?
What happened?"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-29T05:18Z,"Mooserocka, you are indeed entitled to an opinion, I strongly implore anyone to have their own set of opinions. All I ask is that you're not insensitive toward others in the process. You can express an opinion without offending people. 

I think it's safe to say at this point that both you, and AnimeLife, have a bit of a notorious history together. When I said that AnimeLife was no better than you, I meant that if he truly meant what he says about not wanting to fight, then he wouldn't encourage you to fight back by insulting you. In essence, he was asking for it. He can't expect you to stop, if he isn't refraining from insulting or provoking you himself. That is what I meant. "
,mooserocka,2012-12-31T05:53Z,I will always be rude to xeno and piggy every time i see thier names because of what they said. ME and anime life are ok now so we will not be fighting anymore. Which is prob a good thing.
