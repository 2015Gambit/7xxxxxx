The Football League Show 15.12.2012

Manish Bhasin presents all the action from the Football League. It has been a season of turmoil so far for Blackpool and Blackburn. Both clubs are under new management and striving for consistency to lift them into promotion contention; their Lancashire derby is this week's featured match.

Barnsley, meanwhile, go head-to-head with Sheffield Wednesday in an all-Yorkshire affair which may have some bearing on the struggle for Championship survival come the end of the season.
