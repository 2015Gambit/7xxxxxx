You will forgive me but some tracks are too tedious for me to listen to them: experimental rubbish that even RSM presses the >> button of his mp3 player so I just deleted. Anyway if you don┬┤t like i had done that, bollocks for you and your friends RSM and me will carry on our lives.
Very important please, Seed this collection. DON┬┤T GIVE UP RSM!!! As some wanker did in TPB: His two posts you still can see them and are useless because his majesty would not seed anymoore. This is a compromise, not a spoiled wankers game.
If u have some money to buy some albums to RSM you can contact him directly in his web page as this guy has been always his own boss, no industries, no gobetweens, nothing, just he and the Music.
This is one of the biggest, wildest, rawest, prolific and amazing geniuses the music has ever had the chance to have in her files. He can look scornfully to hundreds of poor losers who claim to be -and are taken as- geniuses. Let us not say names. This man deserves a lot MOORE!
