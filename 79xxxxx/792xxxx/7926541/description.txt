This is a workshop we ALL need! Learn color management from Eddie Tapp! We'll talk about calibrating equipment, establishing a color managed workflow in Lightroom and Photoshop, and taking advantage of color management workflow for both input processing and printing and output. If you want to accurately capture, manipulate, and reproduce the color you shot, this is the workshop for you!
