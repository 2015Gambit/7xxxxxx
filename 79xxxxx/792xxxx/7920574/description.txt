The first 7 tracks are from the 1981 LP "RIT".....that would be the one to buy.


Tight, with some vocals and dreamy thick guitar sounds.  Tr#8: CANTICLE FOR THE

UNIVERSE from the 1st album is terrific although I was a bit too slow ending

the fadeout.


Overall a pleasant mix of up-tempos and acoustic guitar ballads.


When vinyl is digitized it is no longer vinyl.  Vinyl is my preference but it's a 

bleeding pain in the gloot and unfortunately, dirt happens.  Consequently 95% of 

my listening is digital.  Alot of great music simply isn't available on CD.


Ian Underwood of Zappa's "Mothers..." contributes synthesizer programming on the

early records.
