Parting the Sea Between Brightness and Me is the second studio album by the American post-hardcore band Touché Amoré. The album was released on June 7, 2011 through Deathwish Inc. The album was recorded and produced in five days with Ed Rose at his own Black Lodge Recording studio in Eudora, Kansas. The band was recorded live to give the album a more "honest/raw" feel. The band said they chose to work with him because of the work he has done with The Casket Lottery.
