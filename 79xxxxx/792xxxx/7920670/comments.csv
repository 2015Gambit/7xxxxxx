[T],mf-den,2012-12-19T20:40Z,"^ Try uploading ur codecs to the most recent ones, u can use k-lite mega codec pack in this case as its one of the best. Or u can use the latest vlc player as it is already comes with all the latest codecs in-built. Cos i hav nevr heard of such a prob from anyone before. Also just see to that ur file has downloaded completely as sometimes due to incomplete or improper downloads also this might happen. If its still not working just let me know."
