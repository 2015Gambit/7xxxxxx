These are the same identical files (NFO includes this new text) as in previous:
XIII.The.Series.S02E01.(READ.DESC!!!).(3.quality.choices).(1.torrent)
.
I started this with a bad decision - people don't want to figure out complicated stuff.
My fault and in honor of my promotion, I've decided to rectify it with individual files.

The text on the screen is in French - the dialog is in English
.
For the few lines in the show that need translating,
I've included a very small .srt file if you know how to use it.
It works for me (XP / MPC), your mileage may vary.
It can be opened as a text file if all else fails
Tells you what was said when.
