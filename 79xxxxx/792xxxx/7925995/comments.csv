,cindy25,2012-12-15T15:18Z,magnet links make multiple files very difficult; for many season packs I have had to find the actual torrent on mirror sites
[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-15T15:33Z,"cindy25:

Damn, I forgot all about that!

Me, my client is uTorrent 1.6.1 and it doesn't accept magnet links.

So, I installed Vuze and it creates the torrent from the magnet link and I use that.

Kind of like using a ferrari to get gas for my '56 Ford pickup, but hey.

Now I'm really glad I did this re-release.

Sometimes my stupidity takes a week to catch up with me, thanks for helping!

,Pelaphus,2012-12-15T17:16Z,"I agree single file torrents can be best but sometimes impractical. Or just unavailable. In which case, check to see if your client lets you delete unwanted files while a Magnet download is in progress. Vuze does. (You have to display the files under the name of the containing folder, select any file you want to remove and right click [or control click] to reveal the delete option in a popup/pulldown menu.) It's more of a bother, to be sure, and not much use when a torrent contains a huge archive; but if the folder holds only a few files, it's a useful option to know about. That said, thanks for this, MP4SUX.Â Much appreciated. Am seeding it forward."

Thank you for adding Vuze instructions. The more tips people can provide, the better.

[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-15T18:21Z,"I've decided to re-release ep 1 (272p & 352p) individually.


The audio is all in English (except some asian with hardcoded French subtitltes and my sub-subtitles for them).

I've constructed English subtitles for the French on-screen text (not credits, just story dependent text).

Should be passable to watch without knowing French. I don't know French and since I wanted to know what they say and had to translate for myself, I decided to do it for everyone.

So, try the tiny s02e01 272p and see if it works for you.

Or, much quicker - just download a .srt file and see how much French text is involved by the English translations I provide. Overall, it's not much or I would never have gotten through it.

It should leave you satisfied in most cases.

The smallest subtitle file has only two ""lines"" of text.
That would be for ep 201.

The largest subtitle file has only 22 ""lines"" of text..
That would be for ep 210.

By ""lines"" I mean ""entries"" and some are two lines.

Just enough to be annoying without the translations.
Not enough to be annoying with the subtitles.

If you're starting now, I hope this info helps you decide which resolution
and how to obtain them (UseNet vs BitTorrenT):

==================== All resolutions - UseNet info:
Best bet for 720p is UseNet. $11/mo, fast, no ratios  no seeding. SSL encryption.
(33.39 GB total, 13 episodes, all in one NZB) NZB search term:
XIII.The.Series.S02E01.Phoenix.INTERNAL.720p.BluRay.x264-TheWretched
(650MB each episode, 13 individual episodes, 13 NZB) NZB search term:
XIII The Series S02E01(-S02E13)
(100MB each episode, 13 individual episodes, 13 NZB) NZB search term:
XIII The Series S02E01(-S02E13)

==================== 720p torrent health very low
I'll keep seeding all 13, but this WILL be slow. Few, if any other seeds.
At Least - 47 Completed downloads (as of 20121231)
Jes' Sayin'

==================== 352p torrent health comparatively very high
Note: 352p is the most popular version with (11-19 seeds) (as of 20121231)
At Least - 1,035 Completed downloads (as of 20121231)

==================== 272p torrent health low
Note: 272p does have seeds (~3 each episode).
At Least - 260 Completed downloads (as of 20121231)
Files small enough for me to comfortably seed.

,cindy25,2013-01-05T14:47Z,did Showcase pull this from the schedule?
[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-05T23:27Z,"cindy25:

According to a report on the EZTV web site yesterday
both HBOcanada and Showcase have pulled it.

I guess I'm the only source for a bit longer.

Sorry, it was ""Showcase Canada"" and ""Showcase"", HBOcanada was not mentioned.

Someone should tell EZTV that a BRRip already exists.
I'm too in the thrall of my current fuzzy brain syndrome at the moment.
