,bubbanuggzz,2012-12-17T08:34Z,"@anyone who thinks this is fake:the green skull means the person/people linked to this acount are V.I.P. uploaders.they can hide their name if they wish just as you can download anonymously if you wish.as far as them posting as Anonymous,well....if you don't know the power that name carries on the inter-webs than frankly you don't belong on the inter-webs.....""We Are Legion""....or,at least they are ;)"
,wilzay,2012-12-17T09:05Z,"I know its tempting to download a movie leaked so early but do yourself a favor and ignore, this movie looks like absolute crap.

Second reason not to download, this looks like a similar set up to the movie 'nude nuns with big guns'. The copyright owners hired a company to track the ISP's of some downloaders in the US then send them copyright infringement notices and demand payment or risk going to court. No one was ever taken to court but the movie made more money from infringement payments from spooked downloaders than it did at the box office

do not encourage this practice, fuck copyright and fuck internet censorship"
