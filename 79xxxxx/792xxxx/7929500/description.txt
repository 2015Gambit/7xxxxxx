User review

Once again the story of an officer who makes a peace treaty with the Indians, which ends up not being respected. The story is well told, with Murphy, Linda Lawson and specially Michael Dante giving very good performances. This probably was one of the last conventional westerns, because in 1964 there were plenty of spaghetti westerns, also German westerns and westerns made in Spain, also those trying to destroy the myth of the west were beginning to come out. The fact is that less people were willing to go to a cinema to see this type of film, and they were too expensive to be made only for TV. Perhaps if the market for video stores would exist at the time, they would have kept on being made, which would have been great because they were quite entertaining.
