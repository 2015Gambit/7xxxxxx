Previously On Battlestar Galactica Eight Montage 1080p bsg4you

This is a compilation of "Previously On Battlestar Galactica" clips that include Boomer, Athena, Helo and some Eights. There are some shots that are not in the normal or extended episodes or the deleted scenes. This is a quick fan edit so some of the audio transitions are not as smooth as the full Boomer and Athena fanedits. The video and audio quality is very high though, the same as the Boomer/Athena fanedits.
