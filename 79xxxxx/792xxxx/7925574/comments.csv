,Nephropathia,2012-12-15T21:50Z,It gets blurry if you play this in full-hd... But there's a 720p version out aswell! :-)
,quehouse2,2012-12-16T06:13Z,"@Nephropathia. We watched it on a hi end Samsung  55"" using Allshare wirelessly from a laptop and the picture and audio were very good. Thanks for the upload!"
,mrmouth,2012-12-16T10:03Z,"It should be 3/10. Who the fuck uses MKV as a container? Seriously, stop with that shit. 

And none of these boneholes has the brain capacity to check the right boxes on their software so you can use MKV2VOB."
,kynsi,2012-12-19T08:06Z,"This is blurry, Fact. 4 different players, over half screen and it's really blurry and obviously low quality. Take this torrent down."
,greylion,2012-12-23T09:57Z,"If you check the video bitrate, it's 1000-1200-something kbps, mostly around 1100-1200, whereas the previous episode had an average of 1422 kbps.
Last ep was also 471 MiB, whereas this is only 402. Both are 42:31 long.
I will have to agree, this ep is way below standard. It's mostly watchable, but blurry in many places. For example, from 19:30 to 21:20, it's quite bad."
