[T],murphy78,2012-12-14T22:59Z,Ah heck. I forgot to note that it has IE9 and Net4.5.  I really shouldn't do my descriptions with the flu.
,mew7946510,2012-12-15T00:26Z,does it have windows loader built-in sir?
[T],murphy78,2012-12-15T10:25Z,"you can d/l windows loader from the link. the file trips security as a hacktool and people falsely claim that my iso has a virus.  It doesn't matter that a virus is not a hacktool, when the claim is made I could get banned.  So I leave it to you all."
,Dlurker,2012-12-15T17:52Z,"Thanx for this nice iso, this is perfect to do a clean install for the next year :D
no big deal if windows loader missing it's so easy to get it."
,mystikal_87,2012-12-16T16:48Z,Thanks murphy78. you're the best
,FRID@,2012-12-16T17:19Z,"Thx murphy78 gonna test this =) seems intrested =) with latest update windows 7 out there!
Used -Maherz and -BIE releases before.. "
,54n1,2012-12-17T04:00Z,"need more seeder here.
murphy can you make windows 7 AIO again with last update? or can i make a new one from this, build iso with deleted ei.cfg?"
,mew7946510,2012-12-17T09:53Z,so deleting ei.cfg does really work to make it multi-edtion?
[T],murphy78,2012-12-18T03:31Z,"mew I removed the non-ultimate versions to slim down the install.wim.  There's no reason to include them if I don't upgrade them.

yutian you can use the link I provided and get windows loader from daz. It's probably the best windows activation hacktool of all time.

You don't NEED a key to install, there's a skip button. You CAN enter one if you have a legit key sitting around for ultimate.

If you don't have a legit key I recommend getting windows loader.  You can use removewat, but it will stop you from being able to upgrade to sp2 when it comes out."

,lmv92,2012-12-20T00:07Z,Will laguage packs work?
,into7,2012-12-20T18:55Z,"I'm running it,
and faced no problem yet.

Thanks murphy78 :)"
[T],murphy78,2012-12-25T00:47Z,lmv you should be fine to install lang packs. Just run windows update and select the desired one from the optional tab. Then go into control panel and navigate to languages.
,untalk,2012-12-26T19:12Z,"thanks man, gonna try this, can you please add netfx 2 - 4.5 , DirectX 9.0c (june 2010), and make it preactivated for the next release?"
,ralfmccarthy,2012-12-27T14:34Z,"hey murphy78
thx for the upload. Where is the link you refer to for the loader? I read the whole page and I couldn't find any link...."
,ralfmccarthy,2012-12-27T14:38Z,got it; it was part of the files to download...
,nj98110,2012-12-28T09:27Z,What is the build version of this?
,nj98110,2012-12-30T12:25Z,"ok , i got it. Never mind. Thanks"
,jaw-breaker,2013-01-03T17:55Z,"I burned the iso on a DVD and booted from to to install. But the moment of install process when it says ""Expanding Files..."" it showed me an error saying that some files are missing and the setup failed.

Then I booted to previous windows and extracted it and installed it from desktop, it worked!

I am thankful to you @murphy78 for giving such an updated version of Windows 7, but it has one mentioned problem.

But still accept my thanks and happy new year."
