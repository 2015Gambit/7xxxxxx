Synopsis:
Fairy Tail is undaunted by their poor performance on the first day. As the guild celebrates, they are visited and taunted by Bacchus, Erza's rival from Quatro Cerberus who has come to replace War Cry. Carla also tells Poluchka her premonition, saying that she saw Mercurius collapsing around a tearfully singing Lucy. The second day of the tournament begins with a footrace atop a train of moving chariots, causing the participants Natsu, Gajeel, and Sting to suffer from motion sickness as a side effect of their Dragon Slayer magic. Sting throws the race while Natsu and Gajeel manage to finish behind the other competitors.
