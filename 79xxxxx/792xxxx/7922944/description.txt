Here's an mp3 version of the Bach Magnificat in D often performed at Christmas concerts. It's an analogue recording on the Nonesuch label I've had for almost 50 years. I've removed the ticks and pops that come with time and now it sounds as though it just came out of the shrink wrap.

Performed by the choir and orchestra of the Sarrenbruck Conservatory.
