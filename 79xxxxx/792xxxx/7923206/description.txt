Stop being a poser and start being a real loser. With this collection of country guitar and folk guitar books your playing will eventually drive nuts your Gf, family friends but you┬┤ll have fun for sure emulating your favorite country idols.

The books include all their respective audio files so u can check how far u are from the real thing. Nae worries, it could be worse: you could be sporting a nice mullet. 
 These are the books:

Country:

-Chicken Picking by Erik Halbik
-Country Licks for Guitar by Steve Trovato
-Country Riffs Vol. 1 and 2 by John Chappel

Blues:

-Guitar licks of the Texas blues heros 

Folk Guitar:

-Frailing the guitar by Steve Baugham

Misc books:

-Licktionary (A collection of licks for every style. Very good. Will give ya a wide range of licks u┬┤ll never be able to use because no one will care anymore about your playing but who cares?)
-Play acoustic (great book)
-Telecaster masters by Arlen Roth. (lots of riffs of songs everyone knows. Lots of fun learning from it. Less fun when u realize u forgot them all just one week later.

The idea of learning from books is just to widen your palette but if u really wanna play trust in your ears and you┬┤ll reach beyond all this books. Remmember what mr Hendrix said when was asked how did he manage to play with his teeths:" I don┬┤t play with my teeths, I play with my ears". Same as dumbo

Have fun
