A ballet that originated back in 1862, this version of THE PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER was 
performed at the Bolshoi and stars Svetlana Zakharova. The story follows a young man and his dreams of running away with an exotic Pharaoh's daughter. The choreography is beautifully staged throughout, thanks to the direction provided by Pierre Lacotte, and Serguei Filin proves to be an awesome leading man alongside Zakharova.
