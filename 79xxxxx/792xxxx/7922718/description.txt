Notes: 

- A video sample is included in the folder in case you want to test the quality before downloading the whole movie. 

- This encode has been tested on MPC-HC, The KM Player, and VLC. If you experience playback issues, it's not due to the encode but to your poor choice in media player, settings or codecs.  

- Except for the English, Dutch, and Russian subtitles which were muxed in the source, I have spent hours adding and synchronizing the remaining 18 out of the 21 external subtitles added to this movie. Thanks to all the people and sites that make subtitles for P2P--they never get enough credit.
