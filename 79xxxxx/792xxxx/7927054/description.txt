Bloodstrike issues 26 to 33 (March - December 2012) by Tim Seeley (Hack/Slash) and Francesco Gaston, with covers by Seeley. Bloodstrike is a team of reanimated corpses the government uses for black ops missions. All credit to the original scanners!

This has been a pretty good series (light years ahead of the original 1993-1995 run) and it's such a shame to read that Rob Liefeld is returning to ruin it!
