To upgrade on an x64 system or use recovery mode you need to use the 64bit only version of windows."

[T],murphy78,2012-12-16T20:33Z,"Pro N VL is volume channel Pro with no media player type programs.

It's basically the same as Pro except it doesn't have the built in windows media player or the video player, music player, etc type apps by default.

VL just refers to volume license.  It affects activation method of microsoft products only. IE Office and Windows.  There is still no retail activation fooling program like windows loader was for win7. Both Office and Win8 set to volume channel use kms server activation, which now that someone came up with that emulated kms server program that I mentioned in the description, works perfectly.

The only downside is that you have to run it every 180 days."
[T],murphy78,2012-12-16T20:39Z,"Oh forgot the media center portion of the question. Media center is not enabled by default in any windows versions. There is currently NO legit activation bypass method. You either have to buy windows 8 and use the free key, or wait for someone to crack retail activation, which could take a while. Bob and Daz over at MDL Forums are making progress on the methodology of the keys and the activation, but unless someone from MS leaks the algorithm that comes up with the missing number in the equation, it's still going to be a while.

I'm sure it wouldn't take as long if everyone and their mother were sending those hackers their legit data.dat and tokens.dat files, but noone in their right mind is going to do that, so they have to work with what they can get.

Long story shorter, use the kms nano activator and live without media center for the time being."
,Sonic_27,2012-12-17T05:48Z,"ok, Thanks for the info! Your torrents are the BEST around and really appreciate your work!!"
[T],murphy78,2012-12-17T11:02Z,"Hmm well technically I have found a workaround that I'm going to upload any second for the free upgrade keys, but you need either a ProWMC version of windows or a retail source: win8pro, pro-n, core, core-n.

I am going to release a dec11 patch day version of win8pro for those that are curious enough to try the workaround. Note that you need a legit key. I have included mine, but I have no idea if it will work for anyone else but me.  It is also very likely that MS will close the new loophole soon, but I'm here because it's my hobby so I'll share my work.

Just don't try it if you are extremely attached to your files, as it is experimental and meant more to help the people who already installed or upgraded to my free mode versions."
,bLusiLv,2012-12-17T13:06Z,what if I already using your free prowmc windows 8 upload? any way to activate?
,steve97,2012-12-17T13:12Z,"We are waiting for it murphy78
:D "
[T],murphy78,2012-12-17T13:39Z,"yes, upping it now bLusiLv.

I felt like I needed to test it quite a few times just to make sure.  Works perfectly for me. Just note that you have to use a legit unused free upgrade key. You can try one of mine that I have provided, but MS can plug this hole at any time; so if you are gonna try it, do it soon."
,oblio4,2012-12-22T10:55Z,"hardly an all in one, when it's missing plain Win 8 (sometimes referred to as ""core"", what previous windows called Home/Home Premium)"
[T],murphy78,2012-12-25T00:44Z,"I will make a more expansive AIO, but be warned that there is no way to obtain legit activation files for Win 8 Core or Core N.  The only way you can even remotely activate those is by using a hactivator."
