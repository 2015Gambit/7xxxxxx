Max and Therese have just brought a new house in a leafy suburb. Their suburban dreams are quickly shattered when they find they have the neighbours from hell. The unruly neighbours are loud, uncouth and unrelenting in their endeavours to engage in loud music, violent dispositions and drug dealings. Their ringleader is a man named King with two sidekicks Shrek and Escobar, who are equally despicable.

After no help from the authoriesties and riven by desperation, Max and Therese plot to make things extremely difficult for King. The plot goes haywire and before they even realise it the couple end up with a corpse on their hands.
