INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Four years ago, I started a journey to clearer skin through a 
healthier diet. I hadnΓÇÖt always known this was going to be the path 
that would bring me to a complexion I was proud of. I spent almost 
a decade prior trying to get rid of my imperfections and breakouts 
through topical medications (from three different dermatologists), 
mail order systems, and years expensive over the counter creams. 
But none of them cleared up my skin for good, my breakouts 
always seemed to find their way back.  
 
I was fed up and determined to find an answer. That answer for me 
was a change in diet ΓÇô and it didnΓÇÖt take long for me to see the 
positive results. My clearer skin so surprising that I was shocked 
none of the skin care experts I had sought help from before ever 
mentioned it. I decided to set out on a mission to help others 
struggling with imperfections looking for real answers to end their 
fight towards clear skin. And thus The Skin Nutritionist was born. 
 
This recipe book has been a true labor of love for me. IΓÇÖve spent 
years creating delicious, healthy recipes to clear and strengthen 
my own skin and IΓÇÖm excited to be able to share them with you 
too! This cookbook is more than a just one-angled approach to skin 
health. With a strong emphasis on immune- boosting properties to 
heal and beautify your skin, every recipe in 
this book is also: 
 
ΓÇó Anti-inflammatory 
ΓÇó Low-glycemic 
ΓÇó Gluten-free 
ΓÇó Soy-free 
 
I have incorporated every one of these aspects because they are all 
essential to clear, healthy skin. The best part about this cookbook 
is you can be sure that any recipe within it you enjoy will move you 
towards a glowing, blemish-free complexion.
