,Pdid,2012-12-16T16:09Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2456594/

See...not fake. You morons post comments before you know jack-shit."
,notnowplz,2012-12-16T16:40Z,its noy fake....but if you read the NFO you'll see it is not the new release too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!......DAMN
,lontrus,2012-12-16T16:56Z,People should know by now that every hit movie mostly have B category replika
,ratkenrat666,2012-12-16T17:29Z,"thanks been waiting to see this
!!"
,ag_orange,2012-12-16T17:51Z,It's not fake...but it's not Age of the Hobbit---it's a Age of the Hobbits...3.2 rating on imdb!
,Frank525,2012-12-16T18:24Z,Lawsuit in 3....2.....1.....
,Pdid,2012-12-16T19:54Z,"The lawsuit will go nowhere. Hobbits were an Indonesian tribe from over 10,000 years ago, which this film makes clear. It's an okay b-movie styled fantasy film."
,kumakaze,2012-12-16T21:27Z,"Pdid, the lawsuit will likely be successful. ""Hobbit"" is a registered trademark. Even the D&D folks had to use ""halfling"" instead. The term ""hobbit"" for the homo floresiensis is a nickname used by archeologists and anthropologists because of the small size, but it's not official at all. The Tolkien estate even banned scientists from using ""hobbit"" in lectures about this hominid. "
,hawkesk57,2012-12-17T02:29Z,Looks like it might have made a decent porn.
,aradiel,2012-12-17T03:21Z,"Asylum have made several straight to DVD movies with similar titles to big name productions that release just before the big name hits our screens. If you've seen any of those, you know what to expect.

I'm sure there's a porn title in the works somewhere too."
,Pdid,2012-12-17T15:14Z,"@Kumakaze>You're right! Lol As of yesterday, Asylum has been ordered to change the name. I stand corrected  :)"

[S],WTCSWE,2012-12-18T16:53Z,"To all :

Don't click or follow links from ""trolls"",you'll end up with infected computer(s).

"
,swine666,2012-12-18T19:45Z,not fake but not the hobbit everyone is expecting therefore... Cheap bullshit!
,Accolon9,2012-12-19T02:21Z,"Not fake in the literal sense, but STILL A FRAUD: it's a kind of ""low budget parasite film""!

Check here for more details (about the...ahem: ""studio"" behind this crap): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asylum"
,Accolon9,2012-12-19T02:26Z,"PS: oh and obviously, the stupid lame trolls the MOD WTCSWE is talking about are (for example: more will surely follow):
#dzekiBE

PPL: ONCE FOR ALL, THERE ARE NO SUCH THING AS 
1 - ""GO TO THIS SITE TO SEE IT WITH BETTER QUALITY""!!!
2 - ""Sorry, access is denied because we just need your credit card first for a check on ""
3 - ETC...ETC...

ALWAYS GET PRETTY suspicious about streaming sites: the good exceptions will naturally come to your knowledge by ppl you know in real life and/or can be trusted online, AND NOT BECAUSE SOME TROLL POSTS SOME LINKS ON APPEALING TITLES like ""all torrents  containing the word Hobbit"" at this point!!!"
,Mau40,2012-12-19T04:09Z,"well this is my first comment ona movie

,frkzoid,2012-12-19T06:43Z,I hardly leave bad comments on movies but this movie is worth the 2.2 rating on imdb. Thanks uploader for the upload though.
,Vadge,2012-12-19T12:42Z,"Want to watch the Hobbit? Jam two thumbs up YOUR ASS, pull them out and take a big whiff!!!!!! Works with Playstation 3!!!!!!! Motherfucking FUCKS!!!!!!!!!!"
,moorishnoble,2012-12-19T20:17Z,this is no the 2012 movie this something else
,1OddBall,2012-12-21T08:10Z,"This is a horrible movie.  I knew it wasn't the new hobbit movie.  Asylum does make some watchable movies this isn't one of them.  I did watch the whole movie as I refuse to admit defeat.
8/8

,quimkaos,2012-12-22T10:18Z,TPB needs to review VIP Status
,ChuChullain,2012-12-22T13:12Z,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I've seen this year... lol  

HOWEVER... Thanks for sharing this uploader...  Now I know that anything made by the Asylum should be avoided at all cost. :)  

Despite the bad movie the quality of the uploader's work is great. A8 V8...  :)"
,vandal2,2012-12-23T06:06Z,one does not simply upload a movie under wrong name...LegendET r u 4 real???get your **** straight please
[H],DaET,2012-12-24T14:00Z,"It's amazing how people are blind and don't realize that this isn't 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'. Stop writing false comments about this torrent being fake, because it's not. Suit yourself if you read it wrong."
,MongKP,2012-12-24T16:58Z,lol I know this is not LotR Hobbit but still gonna dl this and see how bad would be. Can't stop laughing after accidentally saw trailer on youtube.
,end77,2012-12-25T17:07Z,This is not the highly debited Unexpected Journey hobbit movie. How many hobbit movies do we have in this year?!
,markusminix,2012-12-30T13:18Z,"To whom protest : ""do you didn't read the tittle? this is ain't the hobbit unexpected journey, this is Age of the hobbit""

LoL"
,nairobi19,2013-01-02T18:43Z,This is actually better than Peter Jackson's one.
