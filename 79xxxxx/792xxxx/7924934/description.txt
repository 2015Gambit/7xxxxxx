Press Quotes
[Ghiaurov has] the most beautiful of bass voices heard since the Second 
World War. Gramophone

This performance was recorded live at La Scala on January 20, 1964. 
Gabriele Santiniùwho would pass away toward the end of that yearùbrings 
the authority of a life saturated in this repertoire to his pacing. Sesto 
Bruscantini hams up FigaroÆs sense of self-regard, nicely matching the other 
big voices on hand: Nicolai Ghiaurov is a positively thunderous Basilio who all 
but brings the house down, while the underrated Carlo Badioli is alone worth 
the price of admission for his hilariously characterized Bartolo. Alva brings 
wonderful variety to the role, encompassing its lovesickness in his serenades 
as well as the swagger of the soldier and the unctuousness of the music 
teacherùthe two fake identities Figaro plots out for him.ö ù Thomas May
