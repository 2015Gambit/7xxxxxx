Profile:

The legendary Motown Record Corporation was founded on April 14, 1960 by
Berry Gordy, Jr., who merged his two successful imprints, Tamla (whose
first release was Marv Johnson's "Come to Me" on January 21, 1959) and
Motown (first release was the Miracles' "Bad Girl" on September 6, 1959).
It was one of the most successful independent record companies in history.
Its stable of hit-making artists such as Miracles, The, Supremes, The,
Temptations, The and many, many others, along with a talented staff of
musicians and songwriters, collectively created the "Motown Sound," a
world famous hybrid of soul, doo-wop, rhythm & blues and pop. Its motto
was "The Sound of Young America..."
