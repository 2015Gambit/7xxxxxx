a young feller from bangkok goes to find his bride in a rural setting in northeast thailand. idiotic humour at its best, language no barrier, excellent acting and plot, local color is very prominent, comedians are on a par with mike myers and adam sandler Zohan, utter stupidity but also fascinating. lots of very well performed thai country music by very good musicians
