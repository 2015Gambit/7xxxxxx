,Chrono.d,2012-12-17T05:28Z,is it possible to play this movie with subtitles on my PS3? i tried to transfer a movie to a USB key and play it on PS3 but it doesn't see the subtitles like on VLC. Thank you for your help.
,cbrcoder,2012-12-19T10:51Z,"@Chrono.d  And other using PS3

Why don't you guys MAN UP and buy a decent digital video player ? It's available for $35 from amazon and plays everything just fine. Get rid of that ""cinavia"" crap."
