Thanks again"
[T],SecTPB,2012-12-15T06:01Z,"Don't worry. All MMA torrents get two versions, one in HD directly after airing and one in SD two hours or so after the HD. Gotta encode. :)"
[T],SecTPB,2012-12-15T06:02Z,"I don't have FUEL TV in HD, only SD. I choose not to capture anything on FUEL due to this as FUEL TV's SD broadcast quality is awful."
,BFCMEEEE,2012-12-15T06:11Z,SERIOUSLY 4.7GB?  WHY WOULDNT YOU UPLOAD SOMETHING SMALLER FOR US NORMAL PEOPLE WTF

,toothizmz,2012-12-15T09:02Z,"Your work is appreciated SecTPB. These 60fps files never work great streaming from PC to PS3 with PS3 Media Server, I usually wait for the lower quality ones. Do you by chance recommend anything that plays these files smooth, streaming from PC to a PS3?"
[T],SecTPB,2012-12-15T09:16Z,"@_Neurotix_
Yup, everything except PPV, which costs money I don't have, otherwise that'd be here too. Enjoy, and thanks."
[T],SecTPB,2012-12-15T09:23Z,"@toothizmz
I would not suggest streaming at all. I'd suggest using your PC/Laptop monitor or connect your PC/Laptop to your TV via HDMI or S-Video, depending on your PC/Laptop graphics card's output ports. 

You can also try using a USB flash drive. I hear changing the file extension to .mpg or .mpeg allows the PS3 and 360 to read the files, but I've never verified it personally. But direct-play of the file is your best option. 

Streaming transcodes the files into a legible video and audio format, reducing quality anyway. I doubt you'd get the full 60FPS as your network will most likely struggle to buffer the data during playback."
,Biiizzz,2012-12-15T15:33Z,"Merci, la qualitĂŠ est fantastique :D"
,MancFan,2012-12-16T01:57Z,"Thanks SecTPB

Also @toothizmz are you streaming to the PS3 through wireless? because I use the PS3 media server through the NIC and there's no problem streaming the 720p files."
