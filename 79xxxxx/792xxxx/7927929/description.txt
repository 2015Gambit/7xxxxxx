description (not mine):
Three women are sent by steamboat to an undisclosed jungle 
prison called "The Home of Lost Souls". Here they experience 
the usual beatings, whippings, cat fights and humiliations. 
The butch warden has a deal on the side with a local pimp 
who forces them to dance in bikinis at a nightclub and sexually 
service the patrons. Tired of cages, rape, torture and rats, 
the girls kill the resident snitch and escape into the jungle.
