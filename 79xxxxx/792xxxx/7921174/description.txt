Jean-Marc Foltz plays clarinet, Bruno Chevillon bass. Together they play this
absolute wonderful CD of free improvisation, called "Cette Opacité", played at
the Jazzdor Festival of Strasbourg in France in 2003. The two musicians play
some fabulously fresh, raw, inventive and fun music. The melodies are great,
the rhythms are stunning, the interplay is remarkable. Foltz's playing at times
reminds me of Ned Rothenberg, and true, both are experts in the circular
breathing technique, but here Chevillon's bass gives it a more haunting and
hypnotic quality. Yet there is joy too, and plenty of it, and suprise, and
melancholy moments too. Apart from their stunning musicianship, their sense of
space and silence is excellent as well. As said, a wonderful album.
