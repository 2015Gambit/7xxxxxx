,susulock,2012-12-14T13:14Z,WTF is mSD always last?? TvTeam please reply.
,CosmAvngr,2012-12-14T15:00Z,I don't think TvTeam has anything to do with producing the mSD releases. They just get them when they can. In fact I think the mSD releases are on a private site and we only get the ones that leak out.

Oh I did not know that. So that's why mSD always take time to come out. Thanks for clearing that up. I do remember downloading mSD releases from other non-torrent sites. Now I know why many mSD's episodes are not here on tpb but are on those sites. But this particular episode, I could not find anywhere."

That site is gone and I have no idea where to get mSD reliably now."
