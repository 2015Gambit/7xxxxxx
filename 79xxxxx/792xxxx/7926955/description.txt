Before pianist/vibist Eddie Costa died in a car crash in his early 30's

he recorded several albums as leader and many more as a sideman.  This

is one he led in 1957. 



You can predict the quality of a record quite well oftentimes just from              

noting the names of the contributing musicians. Another Costa album; an album

with pianist Bill Evans is one I also need to get.


Tracks 2 and 6 are marked for frequent replay


I love it when my ups aren't in the ACCURIP data base
