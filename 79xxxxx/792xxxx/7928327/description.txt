The world's greatest pulp fiction hero clashes with Russian super-spy Nicholas Rokoff in the gilded palaces of France. Then it's off to Africa, to find the legendary city of Opar before Rokoff can steal the treasure for the Tsar. Little does the ape-man know, his true love, Jane Porter, is also heading for Africa. If Rokoff finds out she's there, he won't hesitate to take her hostage. But Jane is no wilting wall-flower! Repeat after me: Oo! Oo! Oo!
