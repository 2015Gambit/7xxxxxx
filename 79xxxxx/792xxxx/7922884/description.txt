A very satisfying performance of J.S. Bach's Magnificat in D, often performed for Christmas celebrations. This is a late 1950s analogue recording on Nonesuch I've had for almost 50 years. I've cleaned it up and removed the pops and ticks that have come with time, and now it sounds as though it's just been pulled from the shrink wrap. 

The performance is by the choir and orchestra of the Sarrenbruck Conversatory.
