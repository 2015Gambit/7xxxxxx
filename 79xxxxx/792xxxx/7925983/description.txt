These are the same identical files (NFO includes this new text) as in the previous:
XIII.The.Series.S02E01.(READ.DESC!!!).(3.quality.choices).(1.torrent)
If you successfully downloaded from that torrent, NO NEW FILES HERE.
.
I started this with a bad decision - people don't want to figure out complicated stuff.
It was a 3-pack of 720p, 352p & 272p - you had to choose the 2 you didn't want.
My fault and in honor of my promotion, I've decided to rectify it with individual files.
.
I had reservations about such a small size for a drama, but I surprise myself.
I dedicate this to neeru, ostensibly of India for reminding me of small values.

The text on the screen is in French - the dialog is in English
.
For the few lines in the show that need translating,
I've included a very small .srt file if you know how to use it.
It works for me (XP / MPC), your mileage may vary.
It can be opened as a text file if all else fails
Tells you what was said when.
