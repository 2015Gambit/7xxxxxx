[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-15T18:09Z,"I've decided to re-release ep 1 (272p & 352p) individually.


The audio is all in English (except some asian with hardcoded French subtitltes and my sub-subtitles for them).

I've constructed English subtitles for the French on-screen text (not credits, just story dependent text).

Should be passable to watch without knowing French. I don't know French and since I wanted to know what they say and had to translate for myself, I decided to do it for everyone.

So, try the tiny s02e01 272p and see if it works for you.

Or, much quicker - just download a .srt file and see how much French text is involved by the English translations I provide. Overall, it's not much or I would never have gotten through it.

It should leave you satisfied in most cases.

The smallest subtitle file has only two ""lines"" of text.
That would be for ep 201.

The largest subtitle file has only 22 ""lines"" of text..
That would be for ep 210.

By ""lines"" I mean ""entries"" and some are two lines.

Just enough to be annoying without the translations.
Not enough to be annoying with the subtitles.
