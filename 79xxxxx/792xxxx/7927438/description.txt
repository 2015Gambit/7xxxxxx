The film follows a small group of students(played by physicists) after a disastrous malfunction in the worlds biggest particle accelerator. As they try desperately to escape from the underground maintenance tunnels, they are hunted by the remains of a maintenance team, who have become less than human. With the recent coverage of the discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC at CERN, the film appeals to a wide-ranging, science-savvy audience, as well as to zombie enthusiasts as a new approach to the genre. Creative Commons is a growing and innovative culture, and this adds to the films appeal. CERN is the European Organisation for Nuclear Research and is the worlds largest particle physics laboratory, employing around 4000 international scientists and hosting many more visiting lecturers and guests. The Higgs boson is a sub-atomic particle thought to be responsible for giving other particles mass. There is absolutely no evidence that it is harmful in any way. CERN and the LHC have been enjoying much media attention in the last few years, and physics is very much in vogue thanks to popular figures such as Brian Cox.

 Made by physicists, it is set at the Large Hadron Collider, and centres around zombies created by exposure to the newly-discovered Higgs boson. Writer and director Luke Thompson, a University of Manchester Ph.D. student, originally conceived the idea in February 2010, after joking that the tunnels under CERN would be ideal for a zombie film. With a budget of approximately £2000 and a regular cast and crew of only 20, the team built a camera shoulder-mount from copper pipes, made fake blood from golden syrup, and scavenged props from dumpsters. It was shot on borrowed digital SLRs including the Canon 5D Mark 2: consumer cameras which have recently been used to shoot parts of movies such as Iron Man 2, Black Swan and the season 6 finale of TV series House. Editing and digital effects were done on a home computer with Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects.
