FOREWORD
-------------------------------------------------
This wordbook aims to find the roots of the words we use
every day,- dirty sex words. Where did we get the F-word
and the C-word from? Where do we get the word ΓÇ£beadsΓÇ¥
from, the former praying tool of wooden, or glass balls clad
on a piece of string, now widely used to describe a lustful
activity.

This wordbook gives the meaning and the uses of each word.
In order to understand the meaning of sex-words we have to
dig deeper into the old English world of words. This wordbook
is a path to the old, partly forgotten, history of old English
language and its origin.

In this research we have found an old Fruitfulness culture
about 5.000 years old that was spread along the Atlantic
coast and Scandinavia. These rituals and traditions, concepts,
and thoughts still influence us today, for example,
when we open a, - pornsite.

This wordbook is also a way to find the roots to your name,
the place where you live, or grew up, because many of the
today┬┤s place names come from this Fruitfulness culture. Our
given names and family names come from the place-names.
The place-names we have come from rituals and traditions.

Yes, it is dirty, but by reading this book you are helping the
old fruitfulness culture to survive. Every time you look at a
porno-site you perform a holy act, as long as you breed and
keep the memory and the culture alive by giving birth to new
generations
