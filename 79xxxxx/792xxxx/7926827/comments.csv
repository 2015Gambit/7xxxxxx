,Music_Is_My_Life,2012-12-15T21:50Z,"English subs: http://subtitlesbank.com/kon-tiki-english-srt-2328824/
The subs are google translated. But most mistakes have been corrected. I have tried the subs, there are some mistakes here and there, but it's nothing too major."

,gypzdood,2012-12-16T18:34Z,"I've been a fan of Hyerdahl's expeditionary stories since I was a kid... the Kon Tiki (balsa raft) and Ra (papyrus reed) voyages, and his anthropological investigation of Easter Island.

I'm greatly anticipating watching this dramatization, but I'd really love to see the Kon Tiki and Ra Expedition documentaries uploaded some day.

Many thanks!"
,Music_Is_My_Life,2012-12-16T19:10Z,@gypzdood The Kon-Tiki documentary is already up on pirate bay.

,hashtagnwo,2012-12-21T19:01Z,"English subs: http://subtitlesbank.com/kon-tiki-english-srt-2328824/
The subs are google translated. But most mistakes have been corrected. I have tried the subs, there are some mistakes here and there, but it's nothing too major. , yes those subs work in vlc player not on a media player attached to hdtv though eg an asus o play , ps @33mins subs dont make sense...whats that scene about ? is it supposed to be 10 years in future ??"
,hashtagnwo,2012-12-21T19:34Z,"end subs summerising things need translating to english from 1h46..so we need new subs really, the ones i mentioned before are 95% ok for the film"
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-23T01:16Z,"""so we need new subs really""... I'll translate that for you: this isn't a proper rip, and you're all dumbfux for watching it w/o proper subs."

,jeffplane,2012-12-27T13:32Z,"This movie is more than watchable, subs are a bit mediocre but you understand everything that is going on. Not only watchable but an incredible experience for people that appreciate good photography and movie crafting. Eventually we will get good subs im sure.  
Thx again for upload!"
,oldtimer48,2012-12-29T05:26Z,"A/10, V/10, thanks EZ, great quality.  The movie is part English, part Norwegian etc, subs are needed, and the subs quoted Xvid-5rFF on subscene website work quite well."

This movie is fantastic. Find a good sub source, none listed here seem to be up to par. 

That said,does anyone know why they didn't use a chase boat? Couldn't afford it or what?"
