,evilg0d,2012-12-22T00:49Z,"Video - Looks good.
Audio - Sounds good but the volume is about Âź what it should be.
A normal YIFY rip. The quality and file size suits me.
Movie - Worst piece of bullshit propaganda seen in years."
,Pdid,2013-01-06T02:50Z,"Good rip; sound is low volume. @Evilgod...This is not propoganda. The movie doesn't mention any terrorist organization and makes the government look ineffectual. Not propoganda really. Unnecessary, yes; propogandic, no. Watch the Nic Cage stinker 'World Trade Center"" for that lol"
