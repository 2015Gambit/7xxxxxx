About "modify battery statistics" permission: MX Video Player displays current battery state while playing video. To do this permission to read battery state is required. However Android does not distinguish between reading battery state permission and writing battery permission. This is why, despite battery state is only being read, permission to write battery state is required.

About "System Tools - display system-level alerts" permission: This permissions is required to block HOME key when input blocking is activated on video playback screen.
