NOTE: No DeNoise was used on this rip. All de-clicking software used in full manual mode to preserve
 musical transients. No music was harmed in the making of this vinyl rip. No silence been removed,
 please burn gapless to match original track layout. Steve had some wacky cuts, I referenced the cd
 version for splitting tracks that run together and am within .100ΓÇ▓ths of a second on my splits,
 although it sounds choppy if not played as a side.
