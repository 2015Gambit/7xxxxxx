Miranda Zero, the mysterious leader/benefactor/recruiter of Global Frequency is a woman with a mission. She saves people. She and 1,000 others make up the most diverse team of specialists the planet has ever seen, connected together across a worldwide telecommunications spider web from Nova Scotia to Tasmania. Their job? To save the world, usually before anyone else notices there's a problem.

Global Frequency - the last, best line of defense that you have never heard of and if you're lucky, you never will.
