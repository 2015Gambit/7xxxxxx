Also, do you know if you'll be getting Steins;Gate, Part Two [Dual-Audio] soon?

It's stated for release: December 18. So I was just wondering if you knew anything on the situation.  "
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-14T12:57Z,", ill probably have it next week,
then it will take me another 2-5days to encode and OCR,
its really a hassle working with anime over 13 episodes."
,WafflesOverWomen,2012-12-14T16:52Z,"Take your time! Just knowing that you have plans is good enough. I just started watching the first 12 so that once I'm done, you'd have the second 12 roaring to go."
,roundnut,2012-12-15T01:41Z,"This is amazing.
I was wondering if it were possible could you upload Porco Rosso in such quality"
,bigwhiteguy88,2012-12-15T02:49Z,Can you upload Mayo Chiki?
,AquaPigmyNinja,2012-12-15T05:34Z,"Thanks, Daman! Your uploads are always awesome. Looking forward to the rest of Steins;Gate!"

[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-15T12:42Z,"Intrigue in teh bakumatsu has been done for a few weeks now, just havent mux and named them yet."
,Wizardx15,2012-12-15T19:52Z,Cool looking forward to it.

,mooserocka,2012-12-19T03:16Z,To aqua pig you made your name aqua pic ENOUGH said that was too easy.
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-21T06:29Z,"Ok, this is superb quality. 10/10 Audio and visual. 

For people who are adamant about the quality, this is great for archiving. 

Cheers Daman. "
