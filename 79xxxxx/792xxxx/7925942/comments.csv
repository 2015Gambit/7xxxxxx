,morfin56,2012-12-17T06:59Z,"Someone should check this out with caution, something smells fishy here. ISO file? 3.66gb? No IMDB or any info on this movie anywere?"
,dr0neunit,2012-12-27T20:41Z,"OK, I bit the bullet on this one.  Nothing in IMDB showed for any actor/tress in this film, producer, etc.  I tracked down the low-budge production company, what with their abuse of the English language on their website, and found this was actually released as ""Mancation"", which does match with some of the profiles of the names involved and uses almost the same poster art.

Otherwise, who RARs an entire TS_VIDEO folder?  Is that really necessary?  Trying to extract it produced an error, but pulling out 3 or 4 files at a time and I think I have a clean copy, finally."
