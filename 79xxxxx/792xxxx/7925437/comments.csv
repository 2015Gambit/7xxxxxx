Every thing this mans says, is a fucking lie. Crying over murdered children here? He has murdered hundreds if not thousands of children in the middle east with his predator drones. And he gets a peace prize? Get a fucking life you ""useful idiot""."

,MikeR56,2012-12-15T16:13Z,"""Useful idiot ""

Term invented in Soviet Russia to describe people who blindly supported the likes of Lenin and Stalin while they committed atrocity after atrocity.

Today, it refers to brainwashed liberals and leftists the world over (usually college students that aren't necessarily idiots, but just misinformed, naive, and ignorant of facts due to being indoctrinated with liberal/socialist propaganda through their public education) who believe that George W. Bush has committed more crimes against humanity than leftist darlings like Saddam Hussain, Yasser Arafat, and Osama Bin Laden, and still defend Communism, the cause of over 100 million deaths to this day.
