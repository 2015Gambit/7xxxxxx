ΓÇÿThe Second HourΓÇÖ is my sequel to ΓÇÿA Night with EnigmaΓÇÖ. 10 years later, this compilation is more developed, physical and carnal than itΓÇÖs earlier mystical and spiritual counterpart. While ΓÇÿA Night with EnigmaΓÇÖ is about finding and giving in to the struggle between religion, sexuality and the life one wantsΓÇª ΓÇÿThe Second HourΓÇÖ is more to exploiting the life that is past the screen behind the mirror.

The idea is that the listener fades into this experiential session. This album tells a story. A dimension of endless paces of sexual and spiritual enlightenment, an overwhelming stimulation of senses: the other life that we all bear inside the world of Enigma.

Enjoy,
