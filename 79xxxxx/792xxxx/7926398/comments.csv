,Dwarth,2012-12-16T14:42Z,"Search ""prison architect.exe has stopped working error"" on google and try to see what they say on the official forum, some people say you got to delete some files"
,MrCraack,2012-12-26T16:42Z,It worked for me on win7 x64
,impdr,2013-01-01T06:46Z,"If it's crashing for you, try going to the preferences.txt file (one way to get there is to go to %appdata%, go up one folder so you're truly in the ""appdata"" folder, go to ""local"", then introversion, then ""prison architect"")

Change the values by ScreenW to something (width) and ScreenH to something (height) for example 800(w) x 600(h), and change ScreenWindowed to true.

This worked for me, and it might work for you, too."
