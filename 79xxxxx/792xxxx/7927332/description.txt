All Music Guide - Blair Sanderson
French Impressions, Joshua Bell's 2012 release on Sony, presents three 
great violin sonatas, prime examples of French chamber music that have 
been cherished for their emotional power and nostalgic coloration. Indeed, 
the "Violin Sonata in D minor" of Camille Saint-Sa╬┤ns and the "Violin Sonata in 
A major" of C╬ÿsar Franck are so significant in French culture and evocative of 
their time, they are thought by literary scholars to have served as inspiration 
for the fictional "Vinteuil Sonata" in Marcel Proust's Γöö la recherche du temps 
perdu. With Maurice Ravel's "Violin Sonata" reflecting a more modern and 
playful approach to the genre, the program explores the warm sonorities and 
subtle moods of French music, as channeled through the classical sonata 
form, and the refined expression of all three works is lovingly handled by Bell 
and his accompanist, Jeremy Denk. Bell's playing ranges from gossamer fine 
lines to thickly resinous attacks, and his command of the violin's timbres 
reveals the rich possibilities to be found in these pieces. For his part, Denk 
provides flexible and understated support, with a piano part that ranges from 
robust activity where needed to atmospheric delicacy. Sony's sound is clear 
and focused and gives the violin central placement, so all the shades of 
expression and dynamics are easily heard above the piano. The Barnes and 
Noble exclusive edition of this album contains a bonus track, Gabriel Faur╬ÿ's 
"Berceuse," a poignantly lyrical masterpiece of the late Romantic era.
