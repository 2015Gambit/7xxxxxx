,WasAtWoodstock,2012-12-17T10:23Z,Thanks for the up. I seeded to a ratio of over 22 before stopping it. But now I am looking for cover art to embed in each track. Music doesn't enter my collection without cover art. I have so far not been able to find any suitable art. Maybe if you posted the Charly catalog numbers of the discs it would help.
