Sand - Golem (1974/2010)

Genre: Germany, Krautrock

This german band was produced by Klaus Shultze. The music is somehow folk, but also cosmic rock inspired, reminiscent of Ash ra temple and Cosmic jokers, thanks to Shultze's influence who mixed it using "Artificial Head Stereo Sound", the aim was "to get an illusion of perfect surrounding space. The idea was brilliant but unfortunately not the sound.". The album has indeed been pressed again three times, as the band was not satisfied with the result. Their sole album Golem, was released in 1974.
