Reviews:

  A great record has certain qualities that canΓÇÖt be captured in any intentional manner because, above all else, a great record must feel organic, as though each note was determined in a split second, every strike of the drum made in the moment. Of course, this is never the case, but, somehow, certain bands are able to create the aura and Celestine has done such. Upon first listens, the record is a cacophony, noise coming in every which direction, a bombardment. The interchanging vocal stylings are perfect in their delivery and timing. The albumΓÇÖs brilliance exudes in every way; Celestine is confident, smart and fun.

But, after several listens, you begin to see certain things, certain flairs of originality that are unmatched in recent memory, elevating this record into an area unachieved by many bands, even at their height. Things like the two tom strikes at 1:15 of ΓÇ£Industrial MindsΓÇ¥ middle breakdown, or the immediate interruption of said breakdown by air siren like guitar work, which is delightfully jarring at first and, upon later listens makes the song a standout amongst this yearΓÇÖs music. ThereΓÇÖs the fluid bass work on ΓÇ£BittermanΓÇ¥ that both challenges ideas of hardcore while elevating it to a whole new sphere of what the genre can achieve aesthetically.

After a while, youΓÇÖll soon realize that you cannot begin this record without finishing it, another characteristic often associated with great records. As a matter of fact, though this recordΓÇÖs been spinning on repeat for over a month now in the Morrison household, this review has been on and off simply because, once the final seconds of ΓÇ£Symptoms of the SoulΓÇ¥ come about, IΓÇÖm completely distracted and can no longer make myself sit long enough to write anything. IΓÇÖm completely consumed in the recordΓÇÖs world once ΓÇ£Feeding the HoleΓÇ¥ takes place and then I find myself waiting. Waiting for my next favourite moment, waiting for the absurdly brilliant synchronicity achieved between the drums and guitars on ΓÇ£God As a Bastard,ΓÇ¥ my favourite track whose last thirty seconds are most likely going down as one of my favourite moments in music this year. Or, waiting for the final moments of ΓÇ£Blood Stays on the BladeΓÇ¥ which soar to heights rarely seen.

ThereΓÇÖs no doubt in my mind that if this record were to fall into the hands of the proper authority, that it would become a defining moment for Icelandic music as a whole and a watershed moment for the Icelandic metal/hardcore scene. ItΓÇÖs been 3 years since IΓÇÖve been affected this deeply by a record and I can say with complete honesty that thereΓÇÖs not a single flaw within the albumΓÇÖs 11 tracks. Every moment is beautifully orchestrated and essential, creating an overarching theme and cohesive tone. And though IΓÇÖve mentioned how the record has elements of greatness, it also achieves something even more significant; it has come to define a period of my life. But thatΓÇÖs not because I wanted it to. It doesnΓÇÖt represent anything specific for me. Instead, Celestine has made a record that forces itself into that position and I more than welcomed it.

An instant classic. [Self released]

Short Biography:

Icelandic sludge, metalcore band. 
The bandΓÇÖs first EP, called At the borders of Arcadia, was described in this way by Icelandic magazine The Grapevine: ΓÇ£From the opening song, Despair And, Celestine evokes a chilling grind built on heavy guitar sound, guttural vocals from one of the most promising throats in the business, and a gradual devolution of structure that parlays the required despair.ΓÇ¥

The bandΓÇÖs second album, This Home Will Be Our Grave, was recently released in Iceland and two members of Celestine co-founded a record label in Iceland in 2008 called Molestin Records along with members from Icelandic death metal band Momentum.

We have just released our third record.
