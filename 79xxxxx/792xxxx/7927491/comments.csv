,Boredguy121,2012-12-20T03:02Z,"Ok, so i downloaded a Win 7 ultimate version but that activator might not work so my question is if i download this and install win7 on my new pc build do i just use this and click install? Like what are the specific instructions on how to use this"
[V],DeGun,2012-12-20T18:09Z,"@ Boredguy121 

instal your new win7 then try first update... then reboot and run this loader as admin and click instal. make sure NOT TO INSTAL any win7 version E ...  instal  ULTIMATE ONLY ! 

let us know if any problems we ll help out ! 

thx all for comments :)
"
,Boredguy121,2012-12-21T02:30Z,When you say 1st update do you mean selecting every possible update first? then restarting and then activate this? The version of Win7 should be ultimate but a OEM version which might or might not require activation (according to uploader)
[V],DeGun,2012-12-22T12:11Z,"It doesnt really matterz, just instal yur win7 , update or not through windows update then reboot & instal this (run as admin) ... 

about the oem version yuh will surely have to run this loader after updating through windows update so in any cases just instal updates yuh need/want an activate with this ( there is a note about OEM edition it concerns the N version )

dont use any of the ""E"" version and dont use any build under the win7 7600"
,Boredguy121,2012-12-22T16:56Z,Idk about the versions and numbers can i just give you a link to it so you can check it for me? 
,yordles,2012-12-24T09:43Z,"Thanks so much for this, I appreciate it ! Should I throw this onto my partitioned usb along with my windows 7 or put it on a different USB? Sorry, this is my second time doing this and I can't remember the end bits."
[V],DeGun,2012-12-24T09:51Z,"@boredgyu : yuh can do so if you want i ll check this for yuh even if i doubt the version yuh ll use is outdated...


@ yordles yuh can put it on side of your bootable usb and run it after instal ... 

let us know if any problems."

,Boredguy121,2012-12-24T18:26Z,The comment box won't let me post it up but i used it from KAT uploaded by MJYMECHANIC
,Boredguy121,2012-12-24T18:26Z,I don't know if you know what KAT stands for but it won't allow me to fully type it out. 
,Boredguy121,2012-12-24T18:28Z,"Sorry for posting so many comments but one guy (from the one i downloaded) said ""AT the bottom right of my screen it says windows 7 build 7600. This copy of windows is not genuine how do i fix it?"""
,2539,2012-12-27T03:29Z,thanxx

Thats a well deserved a.k.a :)"
,Boredguy121,2012-12-27T20:55Z,I actually downloaded the one from Maherz. Win7 x64. Ultimate SP1 November edition. 
,Boredguy121,2012-12-27T20:58Z,Should i use this or the newer one? 
,wardjp,2012-12-28T08:03Z,I have tried to install this multiple times with 2.1.8 and 2.1.9 yet my windows continues to say not genuine. Any ideas what I might be doing wrong or missing?
[V],DeGun,2012-12-28T21:28Z,"@wardjp : i can read from yur last comments here https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7953429/Windows_7_Crack_Loader_by_DAZ_v.2.1.9_December_2012  that yuh know got sorted :) 

@ boredguy : it doesnt matterz , the version 2.1.9 had only a few minors changes : 

* Added a new GRLDR
* Blocked the loader from installing onto Xen as it's not supported
* Added notes about Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 to the read me file

so instal 2.1.8 it will do the job . 

Enjoy the end of 2012 one & all :)"
