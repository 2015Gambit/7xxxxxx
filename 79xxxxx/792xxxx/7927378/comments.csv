I have created this account and am writing you these words to let you know that in a little country which has nothing much to it but a sun which obdurately shines, even though he knows that 'tis the winter and that he ought to have the decency to give us a break.. :), There is an imp with a dream of becoming a real intellect one of these days who is grateful to you for every single thing that you've uploaded.
Rambam, Thaaaaaaaaaaanks!"
