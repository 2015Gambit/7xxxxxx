A fantastically funny and inventive novelisation of the hit Radio 4 comedy series. 'The funniest book since the one I haven't written yet. Mark Evans sets the bar annoyingly high.' Robert Webb 

Bleak Expectations' recounts the remarkable adventures of young Pip Bin as he tries to repair his destroyed family and distinctly damaged life, aided by his best friend Harry Biscuit and definitely not aided by his cruel and ironically named guardian Mr Gently Benevolent and his accomplices, the fearsome Hardthrasher siblings.

Grim circumstances, mistaken identities, unlikely inheritances,nightmarish court cases, ridiculous names, convenient coincidences to resolve plot problems, over-sentimental death scenes and lots and lots of adjectives: 'Bleak Expectations' is the novel Charles Dickens might have written after drinking far too much gin.

Praise for the Radio 4 series:

'Mark Evans writes one of the wittiest, most ingenious scripts on the air, a Dickensian pastiche with a slight Rocky Horror Show echo.' Daily Telegraph.

'A freshly minted comedy classic.' Guardian.

'...inspired lunacy.' The Times
