America's Lost Treasures
Across America there are forgotten links to our history. Family heirlooms and found objects with unexpected value and amazing stories just waiting to be discovered. Each episode of America's Lost Treasures will follow our team of two cast members on their quest to find these treasures, uncover their stories, and choose one item that deserves to take its place in a museum. The chosen object each episode will be on loan to the National Geographic Society's special exhibition of America's Lost Treasures, and the object owner will receive a $10,000 award.

It's off to the Lone Star State, where hosts Curt Doussett and Kinga Phillipps have invited people from all over Texas to bring their personal artifacts to the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum. Curt decides to investigate a revolver with a ruby-encrusted grip and ornate engravings, used by a famous Texas Ranger. Kinga picks a hand-tooled, mint condition trophy saddle won by the legendary cowboy Jim Shoulders, known as the Babe Ruth of Rodeo.
