In every episode, six contestants will select one package from a collection of wrapped gifts containing millions of dollars in prizes. Each contestant will then have to decide whether to steal a previously revealed prize or take a gamble that the unopened box is worth more. The contestant holding the least valuable prize at the end of each round will be eliminated.
