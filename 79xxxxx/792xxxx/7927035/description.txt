Admittedly I performed most of my quality assessment by checking Space scenes for blocks or other artifacts, and by comparing the sparkling clarity of Colonel Deering's eyes & lip gloss.

I re-encoded several times until I found the right settings to maintain black levels & starfield/smoke/flame detail, and to eliminate some framerate shudder visible during action scenes on the DVD source.
