Windows Anytime Upgrade (WAU) is an upgrade method offered by Microsoft and selected licensed resellers for users who wish to upgrade any non-Ultimate edition of Windows Vista or Windows 7. The Windows 7 version of Windows Anytime Upgrade introduced many improvements, notably the upgrade time has been reduced to around 10 minutes, and upgrade license keys can be purchased at retail. Windows Anytime Upgrade DVDs were only used for Windows Vista.

Windows Vista Anytime Upgrade was a full in-place Windows reinstall that usually took considerable time and required the original Windows Vista DVD with the same service pack level as that of the installed edition.[1] Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade does not require physical media and installs the extra components of the Windows 7 edition from the Component-based servicing (CBS) store located on the system.

Microsoft's current marketing material states that all installation media will contain all the functionality of the highest SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) and that higher level functions will be disabled through winlogon.exe and pidgen.dll. This is what is also used in differentiating between Windows XP Home and Windows XP Professional. In practical terms, this means that the license purchased online effectively determines which version of the operating system customers can upgrade from and to.

The benefit of WAU is that if one decides that one wants Windows Media Center, Aero, or Windows Fax and Scan out of a computer that currently runs the Home Basic edition, one could complete the upgrade without needing to acquire a different installation disk and without requiring a reinstall of Windows.

In Windows 8, this feature has been replaced by Add Features to Windows 8.
