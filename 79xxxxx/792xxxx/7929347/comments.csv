,foosha,2012-12-16T21:03Z,"Maybe my error, until I find out for certain, apologizes to the uploader"

,Gordo2772,2012-12-17T11:56Z,It broke after I installed this. I uninstalled and used http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7851522/Call.of.Duty.Black.Ops.II.Update.1.and.2-SKIDROW then I left it alone. Works great so far. I'm only thru the 2nd mission though.
,Shirako99,2012-12-17T16:46Z,I install the game and run first time it's working perfect but 2 days later the game is not run fuck yaaaaaa
,Shirako99,2012-12-17T16:46Z,Help me please
,foosha,2012-12-19T09:31Z,"Gordo, the update you mentioned, worked for me too, or at least the game started. However, once I get to the level preceded by the movie of the little girl being yanked out of bed, I got a freeze.

That freeze was why I was back here for updates to begin with.

I'm not really complaining about folks trying to give us a fix but for now, we pay or we wait. :)"
