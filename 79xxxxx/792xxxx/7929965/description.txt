Biography

Gibson enrolled in media studies at Goldsmiths College, University of London. Tuition and clothing expenditures led her into debt, however, which proved to be the catalyst for her modelling career.[1]

In 2007, Channel Four asked to document her day-to-day activities as an aspiring model in an episode of the children educational documentary TV series My Crazy Media Life. The programme showed her living with her parents and younger brother in rural North Wales, and revealed that she is known as "Haf" (pronounced "Harv") to her friends and family.[2] "Seren Haf" is Welsh for "Summer Star".

Her Myspace blog is called "Accidental Glamour Model", where she explains why she turned to modelling [3]

By the end of 2007, she had been featured in the Daily Star and Maxim[4] and Zoo.[5] As of 22 April 2010, she has appeared on the cover of Front (magazine) six times (December 2007, May 2008, March 2009, January 2010, June 2010 and most recently October 2012).
