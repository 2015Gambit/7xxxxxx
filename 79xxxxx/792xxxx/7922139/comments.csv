Follow the guides Iv tried to make them for even the person that is doing their very first ever Game Install... ::-)))

Enjoy

,davidchiang,2012-12-19T10:24Z,"How to play the omega DLC ?
Should I play a new game first ?
I don't see Downloadable contents in the main menu.. "
,Fantomnz,2012-12-21T20:37Z,"@davidchiang you have to copy & paste the folder that comes with the Omrga DLC into your main install directory, the links are here. Its the same for Leviathan & Extended. My install guides tell you how to do it all.
If I remember correctly Leviathan & Omega become available after the Palaven mission. You get messages at the private terminal from a Dr.Bryson & Aria to meet on the Citadel.

Hope that helps & use my guides  :-)

,davidchiang,2012-12-22T08:29Z,"I have copied it all and also use the DLC unlocker.. 
I was thinking i am not able to play the DLC because i don't see DLC menu in the main menu ( i've seen someone's video has it).. 
By the way, thanks for response and also the guide.. :)"
,Fantomnz,2012-12-24T06:12Z,"@davidchiang At the beginning after you have to speak with the council Eden Prime where you get the ""Prothean"" becomes available as a mission. Im doing another run through but still think its after palaven that you get the private message on your terimal. There is No DLC content in the menu but you can go to the Achievments in Extras at the menu & check to see if you have the last 3 which are for Omega ""Talon,Savior & Meticulous"" If they are there then you have the DLC installed it will just need to be triggered. The ME3 crack & 1.03 update that come with the Extended cut need to be installed :)

I hope that helps....

,Fantomnz,2012-12-24T06:16Z,"Oh & you need the Firefight DLC (you dont need the patch just install it) to be able to do Omega (needed) & I think maybe Leviathan also. I got a message on installing a fresh Install that it was required to play or install......

,Pao___13,2012-12-30T19:35Z,"Hey, good job on compiling all this stuff. Just having an issue with the installer for the initial ME3 install, it says ""The system cannot find the file specified"" when I try to run it. Any ideas? thanks"
,Fantomnz,2012-12-31T05:26Z,"Get Virtual clone drive & mount the iso's.....
I have not had any install issues with VCD & run as Admin...

Hope that helps

,Pao___13,2012-12-31T22:59Z,"hmm. no same problem as when I used deamon tools. Once I start the installer I see these lines:

Installation path: C:Program FilesMass Effect 3
Extracting game files
Files were extracted successfully
Installing game prerequisites, please wait ...
The system cannot find the file specified"
,Meethos,2013-01-02T12:40Z,"Hey Fantomnz thanks for all the hard work and invaluable tips. 
This pack of yours is on my queue so I was wondering...do you mention anywhere in there the order in which we should instal all the stuff? I mean I'm brand new to ME series and I've just grabbed all 3 games + update 1.03 + unlocker + extended cut + leviathan + from ashes + omega dlc and I don't want to mess things up while installing.

Again thank you and sorry about the n00b question."
,Fantomnz,2013-01-03T02:25Z,"@Pao___13 Um do you hav ethe Reloaded version???
I do & after the first Isoa has done its bizzo it asks for 35.rar which has been an issue for people , I have mounted Isob & continued with no issue.

More than happy to help if you can give me some more info....Cheers

,Fantomnz,2013-01-03T02:29Z,"@Meethos 

Yes everything is there as best as I could descibe for someone like I used to be....
You dont need from the Ashes & youll notice I dont mention any Ashes DLC except for the DLC Unlocker gives you it....
Happy to help If you have any Issues.

I would suggest starting on ME1 :)
Worth it IMO :)

,Meethos,2013-01-03T17:09Z,"Thanks for the answer but I think I didn't make myself clear (I'm brazilian btw so my english is not that great). 
I wanted to know if there's any specific order in which I should instal the update and DLCs or if it's just game > update > crack > DLCs (all together in any order)."
,Pao___13,2013-01-05T23:01Z,"yea I downloaded all the links provided above so I do have the Reloaded version. When I mount Isoa and run the installer, this is all I get right away:

Installation path: C:Program FilesMass Effect 3
Extracting game files
Files were extracted successfully
Installing game prerequisites, please wait ...
The system cannot find the file specified

I tried mounting both Isoa & Isob at the same time and that didn't work either. I also tried before and after unpacking the Isos with winrar but it didnt make a difference"
