,Jeus1997,2012-12-24T16:54Z,How to change languege which is in russian..? Ty in advance.
,ancemu,2012-12-29T13:54Z,"I SOLVED THE LANGUAJE PROBLEM: go to User[UsernameAppDataRoamingBioshockBioshock.ini (you will have to activate show hidden files to see appdate folder)
change bioshock.ini  to bioshock.txt (you will have to uncheck hide extension of known files)
open the bioshock.txt file, and under the engine.engine section, there will be a line that says language:rus (rus is the language set) change it to english simply replacing rus with int

The first dialog of the game is in russian, you can activate the subtitles to read it. In my case the english volume dialogs were too low, so I changed the music and effects volume to 20, and left the dialogs in 100.
It works fine for me. Regards"
,ancemu,2012-12-29T14:01Z,"Sorry, I forgot this: YOU SHOULD CHANGE AGAIN bioshock.txt to bioshock.ini

I hope it works for you. Regards."
