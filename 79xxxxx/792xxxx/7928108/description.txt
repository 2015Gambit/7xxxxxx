In Dreamcatcher's Riddle of the Sphinx: An Egyptian Adventure,
 you take on the role of the closest friend of famed archeologist
 Sir Gil Blythe Geoffreys, a talented academician both
 at home and in the field. After discovering a secret 
chamber that has been hidden for centuries, Geoffreys 
finds an ancient scroll that he believes will help 
translate and solve the ancient Mystery of the Sphinx. 
Eager to discover the secrets, he breaks the seal and, after 
deciphering the contents, realizes he has unwittingly unleashed 
a terrible curse.

Fearing for his life, he calls upon you, his most trusted friend,
 to come and help him. Once in Egypt, you discover the archeologist
 and the ancient scroll have disappeared. With little to go on beyond
 his original message, you must find the scroll and the secret chamber
 as a starting point and embark on a quest to uncover the mysteries
 unleashed by your friend's discovery. As your adventure continues,
 you encounter cleverly designed deathtraps, logic puzzles, secret chambers,
 hidden tombs and disorienting labyrinths, as well as Geoffreys greedy colleagues.

Riddle of the Sphinx: An Egyptian Adventure features a soundtrack
 that matches the ancient Egyptian environments. Objects and surroundings
 are rendered in 3D with a variety of movement options including 90┬░ and 180┬░
 turns in most environments and the occasional 360┬░ virtual reality panoramic view.
 A point-and-click interface is used in conjunction with onscreen icons and menus.
