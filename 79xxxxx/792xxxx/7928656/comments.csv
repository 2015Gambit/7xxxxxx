[T],SecTPB,2012-12-17T16:46Z,"Only one's worth watching are 1, 6, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 32.

These are not even close to the best for the most part. There's many missing prior to 1999 that far exceed these. #1 is legendary just for being the VERY first UFC/MMA fight, and #6 to respect the man Royce Gracie who created the UFC and started MMA. It's his longest match ever until he fights Sakuraba in Japan's PRIDE for an hour and a half."
,You_Muppet,2012-12-18T15:27Z,"I think @SecTPB meant to say thank you. 

So on behalf of us leeches, ta.

PS: the file I downloaded didn't come down as an .avi (or, it has no .avi extension). Not sure what happened. VLC plays it fine though."
