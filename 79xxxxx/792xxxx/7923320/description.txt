The Boulez recording(s) are available elsewhere.  I grew up with the 1970

BOULEZ on vinyl (double LP) with the Deryck Cooke 10th included on the

extra disc.  Heavy stuff for a teenager.  It's a joy to hear this awesome

"cantata" without all the worn LP "special effects."


For those of you either new to, or curious about Mahler this is a good work

to initiate yourself with.  Mahler creates nearly unbearable tension with

dissonance but this is accessible music, firmly rooted in Romanticism.


This is not my rip....I extracted it from  COMPLETE WORKS files so that others

can access it without occupying 5GB on disc.


The "program" involves brothers, murder, and a queen with some issues.

Mahler wrote this as A TEENAGER! ......... Crank up the stereo
