Most conversations to get things done at work are of one of four types-initiative conversations, conversations for understanding, performance conversations, or conversations for closure-but they are often done poorly or misused. This book shows managers and employees how to use the right conversation at the right time, plan and start each conversation well, and finish each conversation effectively.
