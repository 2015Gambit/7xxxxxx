,petrus7,2012-12-14T12:51Z,BTW this is first episode in second season. First four was only retrospective. The best of first season. Don't be stupid.
,sumosmurf,2012-12-14T14:12Z,Actually this is the second episode of season 2. The first episode is labeled as S02E05 and is not on TPB as of this post.
