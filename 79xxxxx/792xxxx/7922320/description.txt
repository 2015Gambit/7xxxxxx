Hi,

Sometimes, when I have nothing better to do - and that happens a lot lately ΓÇô I listen to Music. Never knowing which direction the trip will take, I was listening to the my last Indie playlists.

At the end of a year one gets the urge to look back and close up. To round up the Dutch Treat part uptil the end of this year, I actually needed one more Playlist (dedicated to a unique source). Sometimes Music is like mining. Looking for the source.

While thinking I happened to listen to ΓÇ£Mother MotherΓÇ¥. More than Interesting music from an interesting titled Band. Reminds me of Klaatu (plus). Throughout my Indie collection, I happened to have several tracks (I would be happy to play for someone else too).

So, I could find four CDΓÇÖs, from which ΓÇ£Touch UpΓÇ¥ is probably the best pick. A ΓÇ£Mother MotherΓÇ¥ special was born and to be honest, after listening it for the fifth time (why not, it only gets better) I was sure this is serious stuff that easily matches Porcupine Tree, Fink and even Florence.

Enjoy (I donΓÇÖt ask, itΓÇÖs up to you to share, or not):
