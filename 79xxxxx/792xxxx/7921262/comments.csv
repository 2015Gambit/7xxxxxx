,Land_0,2012-12-18T09:10Z,Thanks so much for the upload. I noticed that there's a few presets missing from Film 01 (Portra 800 HC and Auto WB in the Toolkit)
,dptrumpeter91,2012-12-19T20:22Z,"@Land_0 Yea, I didn't realize it either until you just mentioned it... I just got this from some initial posts on CGPeers. If you find them, I'd be awfully appreciative if you'd let me know :) Also, if you find the 6D and D600 camera profiles somewhere, I'd be awfully appreciative too :) "
,spizalope,2012-12-30T21:58Z,6D profile would be awesome! thanks!
,xherzogx,2013-01-01T02:28Z,Does this work for Mac if I drag the files into an equivalent folder?
