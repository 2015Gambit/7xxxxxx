Christmas is coming.....

       Nigel Slater shares the flavours that for him make Christmas
 a truly delicious season. As we tick off the days and open our
 advent calendars, Nigel shows us how to cook for both entertaining
 and self-indulgence; filling our kitchens with tastes and smells to
 get us in the spirit of the season and serving up food designed to 
 bring comfort and joy... Nigel also makes a culinary trip to Norway 
 and goes in search of a very special Christmas tree.
