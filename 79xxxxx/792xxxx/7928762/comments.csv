,zorb69,2012-12-16T21:40Z,"Just registered on TPB, for the sole point of adding my thanks to all the others. Excellent work. It's essentially a public service proving this sort of programming to countries which will never ever receive it via normal channels. "

Sorry for my language.
But, you'll know what I mean if you watch the final episode to the end.

Still the best drama in my life, period!!

There must be fouth season! please~~~~~

Now, I understand why capitalism doesn't work. :)))

Thanks for sharing this great drama, Snowhiter!"

,redcoatfrench,2013-01-06T04:21Z,"Thanks Snowiter. As always, you provide a great service and especially when it comes to sub-titles. Any chance of getting a Danish series called Rejseholdet?  32 episodes from 2000 - 2004. Can't find it with hard coded subs anywhere and that seem to be the only subtitles I can get to work!"
