MY NOTES :D
-----------

-guys its not accomplishment to download and run away , either in life or in the pirate bay , you have to feel for them too , who feels for you!

-what i am trying to say is that if i feel for you and upload these all stuff then
you should also help me in seeding these as long as you can.

-initial seeding will be a bit slow, so no need to panic OK :p

-your comments will encourage me , so let they come

-avoid silly comments because they will hurt me as i am very sensitive :D
