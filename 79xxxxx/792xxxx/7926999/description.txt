IMDB Info:

The King is Dead is a film based on neighbours, both good neighbours and horrifying neighbours. It is a story of a couple, Max (Science Teacher) and Therese (Tax accountant) who move into a leafy neighbourhood and find themselves flanked by a nice family on one side and "interesting" people on the other side. While the good neighbour fosters a beautiful relationship which spans out to include a magic door in the fence dividing the houses, the "interesting" neighbours turn from interesting to concerning, only to proceed to horrifying and finally insufferable. The neighbours from hell are loud, uncouth and unrelenting in their endeavours to engage in loud music, violent dispositions and drug dealings. Their ringleader is a man named King with two sidekicks Shrek and Escobar, who are equally despicable. 
Director: Rolf de Heer
Stars: Roman Vaculik, Michaela Cantwell and Lily Adey
