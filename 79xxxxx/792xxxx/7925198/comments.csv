Gotta say I like your style and it's high time I actually let you know that. Wandering the countryside providing uplifting encouragement as if on a mission - of which you are a perfect exemplar. find your stride and ride it all the way home.

Every gracious encouragement finds my heart and the cockles within and warms them nicely. And you've been consistently verbose in your accolades.

Thank you very much.

For the record, I started with the 720p, then created the 352p and finally the 272p and it is that last that I personally watch on a 32"" 1080p monitor. 2pass encoding is the key to quality at such low bitrates and resolution, I suspect. Took just a little exploring to see that 480 is a great size for small devices and avoids that horrible 320x-whatever stigma and IMHO actual problem resolution of a bygone era..
