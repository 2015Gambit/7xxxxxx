For a Mini 272p XVID AVI with 22K MP3 audio, I'm going to be bold:
V=8
A=8
.
Well, now it's done (finally!) and I can relax once again. Great show, huh?
Sorry to all those who had to wait and thank you everyone for your support.

The text on the screen is in French - the dialog is in English
.
For the few lines in the show that need translating,
I've included a very small .srt file if you know how to use it.
It works for me (XP / MPC), your mileage may vary.
It can be opened as a text file if all else fails
Tells you what was said when.
