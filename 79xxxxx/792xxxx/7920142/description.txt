DP VOL 21

The Grateful Dead's 1985 East Coast fall tour produced 
a few shows that remain as key entries in their three 
decade touring canon. Dick's Picks, Vol. 21 contains 
one such performance. Documented at the Richmond Coliseum 
on November 1, 1985, this show remains a favorite from 
the mid'80s among Deadheads in the know. In addition, 
these three discs also include well over half an hour of 
material from the Community War Memorial in Rochester, NY, 
on September 2, 1980. Why just this fragment? According to 
vault keeper David Lemieux, "All we had in the vault of 
that show is what we are releasing here." One of the main 
reasons this performance ranks so highly is an above average 
song selection. For instance, "Stagger Lee," "Comes a Time,
" and a cover of Dylan's "She Belongs to Me" are all 1985 
revivals. While some material stayed out of the rotation 
longer than others, the influx and overall diversion from 
routine make more common fodder such as "Me and My Uncle," 
"Big River," or "Jack Straw" considerably more palatable. 
There are also some unpredictable moments. The most notable 
occurs during the second set as "Lost Sailor" and "Saint of 
Circumstance" which are usually played together are done 
separately. This show happens to be the sole occurrence in 
which both songs are performed, but not sequentially. An 
unusually animated Bob Weir demonstrates his attributes and 
support to the aural athletics taking place during a rare 
cover of "Gloria." The nearly 40 minutes of music from 
September 2, 1980, was added because it contains some amazing 
music, and because there was a significant amount of time 
available on the third disc after the "feature presentation." 
The brilliant and economical idea to incorporate these 
otherwise useless fragments of music is solved proving once 
again that necessity can still be the mother of invention.
