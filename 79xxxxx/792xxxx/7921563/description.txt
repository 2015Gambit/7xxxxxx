
This is what I believe is the UK single for "Hard TO Make A Stand" - The artwork seems to be different than the US version, although I bought it in a little record store in Berkeley, CA.  Includes 1)  The album version, 2)  Alternate version,  3) Live BBC Simon Mayo Sessions, all of "Hard to Make A Stand" and 4) In Need.

Enjoy.  

I've got more Sheryl Crow Singles with lots of non-album material.  Anyone interested?
