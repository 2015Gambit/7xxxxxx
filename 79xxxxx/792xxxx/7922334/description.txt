Hi Everyone,

I made this torrent for my two picture books The Lonely Lonely Chameleon and Sometimes Life Can Be Scary.  Normally these eBooks costs a little bit of money on my website www.pbpanda.com .  However I totally understand that not everyone has cash to shell out to everything.  That's why I decided to make a torrent for my own books.  Not because I am poor businessman, but because I have faith in the world that it will go full circle.  

I too have used The Pirate Bay for programs and such, and the ones I found I needed and wanted and liked I ultimately supported.  I didn't always buy the product, but I would usually donate in some way back to the creator.  That is why I think it's fair that I pay it forward.  Some of you will love it and want to send a donation back, and that's great!  Some of you will love it but not have any money, and that's fine too!  

I didn't get in the picture book business to become a monster.  Some people have money, some people don't but everyone deserves to have a few nice books to read in their library (be it in physical form or virtual).  If you do have the chance to pay it back my website is http://www.pbpanda.com . You can always just purchase my artwork or just donate back to the cause or just shoot me an email to keep up the good work at LonelyLonelyChameleon@gmail.com .  Regardless of what you do though, I want you to enjoy these books! 

You'll also notice I have this torrent nowhere posted on my website, and that isn't because I am ashamed of it or hiding it- but because one of my favorite things about The Pirate Bay is it's discreetness.  It makes it feel like a secret society.  I want coming across this torrent to be a total surprise and happy event!  

Anyway without further rambling, the description:
