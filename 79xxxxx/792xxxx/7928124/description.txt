Ballad Essentials compiles 12 remastered tracks recorded by jazz guitarist
Kenny Burrell between 1958 and 2002, encompassing his tenure with Prestige,
Fantasy, Contemporary, and Concord Jazz. The romantic themes include four
Duke Ellington compositions, the Miles Davis-penned "Blue in Green," and
Thelonious Monk's "'Round Midnight." The bop-based Detroit guitarist is
backed up on these dates by various all-star ensembles that feature John
Coltrane, Tommy Flanagan, Coleman Hawkins, Joe Sample, Jimmy Smith, and
numerous others. This is another well-chosen set in the Concord Jazz Ballad
Essentials series.
