Keeping Up With The Kardashians season 1

Meet Hollywood's modern-day Brady Bunch. The premiere season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians introduces viewers to the quirky Kardashian clan as they live life in the Hollywood fast lane. Kim, the leader of the pack, is already a paparazzi favorite--and with "Playboy" and the Pussycat Dolls calling, this buxom bombshell is ready to become a pop culture staple. But with two fiercely competitive sisters, two impressionable half-sisters, her menopausal mom (who also doubles as her manager!) and a conservative Olympian step dad Bruce Jenner, life in the Kardashian household is far from harmonious. See what happens when the family celebrates their parents' eighteenth wedding anniversary (with strippers and facelifts, natch!), orchestrate a scandalous "Girls Gone Wild" photo shoot in Puerto Vallarta, and Kim bares all for the cover of "Playboy." Will they be able to work together as one? Or will their individuality end up fracturing the family?
