During their honeymoon, the minds of Jean and Scott are transported to human host bodies in the Askani future by Rachel, aka Mother Askani. She is now over a hundred years old and the Askani Clan is destroyed.  She explains that she brought the two into the future because she canΓÇÖt raise baby Nathan and overthrow Apocalypse herself.
