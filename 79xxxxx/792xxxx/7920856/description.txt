Irwin and Rippe's Intensive Care Medicine is a comprehensive textbook covering both the theoretical and practical aspects of medical and surgical critical care. The Seventh Edition will again be presented as a single volume, and will retain the organizational structure established in in the Fifth EditionΓÇöa major overhaul from its two--volume predecessors. The text is generally organized on an organ-systems approach, but has popular sections such as procedures, overdoses and poisonings, trauma, and surgical problems in the ICU.
Thoroughly updated for its Seventh Edition, this classic reference remains an unsurpassed source of definitive, practical guidance on adult patient care in the ICU. It provides encyclopedic, multidisciplinary coverage of both medical and surgical intensive care and includes a "how-to" atlas of procedures and a new section on noninvasive monitoring. Each chapter, completely revised, identifies Advances in Management based on randomized controlled clinical trials. The cardiology section has been completely rewritten to reflect advances in management of acute coronary syndromes. Also included are extensive updates on management of COPD, diabetes, oncologic emergencies, and overdoses and poisonings.
