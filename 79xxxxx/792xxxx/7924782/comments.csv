[T],SecTPB,2012-12-15T12:50Z,"I don't have FUEL TV in HD, only SD. I choose not to capture anything on FUEL due to this as FUEL TV's SD broadcast quality is awful. I'm sure there are other users who have uploaded it in better quality than I could."

Get Media player Classic (home theatre version) & VLC player.  With those two apps, everything can be played."

Fine Using VLC.
