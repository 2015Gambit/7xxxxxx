The Rough Guide To Highlife ~ 2nd Edition ~ 2CD / 2012 (World Music Network) [FLAC] {MKOP}

Highlife is one of the first jazz/African roots fusion musics, with a history going back to the 1920s. This Rough Guide is jam-packed with some of the biggest hitters in highlife history. Enjoy Victor Uwaifo's Nigerian joromi stylings, the gentle Ghanaian palm-wine of Koo Nimo, and even an early recording of Afrobeat superstar Fela Kuti presenting a firmly highlife vibe. The bonus CD is extremely special. Three virtuoso musicians have shared their ideas and passion to re-explore the traditional sounds of the seprewa and origins of highlife in an acoustic contemporary setting, with breathtaking results. 

 ''A treat of a compiliation CD with a gem of a bonus CD. The music is extremely pleasant and makes fine back ground music.''
