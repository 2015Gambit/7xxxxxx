Bust: 36. Waist: 24. Hips: 36. Guns: .44. IQ: Not so Good... What happens to the Prom Queen when the prom is over? Meet the girls of the sorority, Faith, Hope, and Charity,the most popular girls on campus, and the best assassins the world has ever known! When these girls aren't in class, they're toppling third world governments, playing enforcer for the mob, and causing millions of dollars worth of property damage. They're not sweet. They're not nice. They don't know state capitals. They barely know what month it is. Too pretty to be ignored, and just smart enough to be dangerous! They're the Killer Princesses and they're back to ruin your life... again! It's mayhem, mischief, and misplaced aggression by fan-favorite humor columnist Gail Simone (Bart Simpson Comics) and Eisner-nominated artist Lea Hernandez (Rumble Girls)!

Note:  Page 5 is repeated twice in Issue #1.  I assume this was a mistake, but I did not want to change the original archive.
