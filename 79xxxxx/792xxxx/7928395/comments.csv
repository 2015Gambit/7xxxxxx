,ghalib86,2013-01-07T09:43Z,I've been seeding @ 64kbps & downloading @ 15kbps... this's gonna take me at least 50 hrs to get the file... but no complaints... I'm patient... Bringing Up Baby in 720p... waao!!! this better be worth the wait... I just hate it when a file has optimum no. of seeders and has no comment regarding qlty... aoloffline should've at least provided screens.

I mean, since this's not a BRRip, 720p was not necessary... even 480p would've been just fine & same quality could hv been compressed under 800-900 MiB... but it's okay... audio-video is awesome... no problem whatsoever... I'll keep seeding 4 the greater good."
