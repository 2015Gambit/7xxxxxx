Stand up and pay attention because Gary Gulman is about to break it down. No Can Defend is the comedianΓÇÖs second release, first for Comedy Central Records and from the start; the comedian sets the tone ΓÇô slightly neurotic, cautious but damn is it funny. Gulman is no newbie to the stand-up scene heΓÇÖs been doing his thing for a long time and No Can Defend is the perfect encapsulation of all that is Gary Gulman.

HeΓÇÖs loved for the underlying neurotic tones to his act but given his childhood 
stories, itΓÇÖs easy to see where they come from. Whether his Jewish upbringing (ΓÇ£theyΓÇÖve found themselves in a pickle or twoΓÇ¥) or his desire to visit 8th grade Gary and correct his views on the importance of typing; heΓÇÖs perfectly in touch with his neuroses and heΓÇÖs become a great comedian 
because of it.

GulmanΓÇÖs style lies somewhere between Jerry Seinfeld and Woody Allen, letΓÇÖs call it observational-neurotic. ItΓÇÖs applied well to No Can DefendΓÇÖs which comes off as a roll down Generation X memory lane. Gulman applies hyper-vigilance and skepticism while deconstructing (of all things) the Discman, fonts, MC Hammer, The Karate Kid movies and Vanilla Ice (he never did have the acting career as the IceΓÇÖs Cube and T). However, Gulman is too smart to just tell topical, childhood inducing jokes. HeΓÇÖs whip smart with his deconstruction of said topics. Taking unpopular opinions like Daniel from The Karate Kid really did deserve to get his ass kicked because he was a provoker. Or that Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz was being a bitch by singling out her best friends in front of other friends.

One Gulman characteristic I admire most is the lack of malice in his act. One of the easiest things a comedian can do on stage is go on the attack, whether it be politics or people, thereΓÇÖs often low hanging fruit available for the laugh. Gulman takes the more difficult route with no anger or hatred toward a topic. Sure he gets fired up about subjects but itΓÇÖs not venomous, rather you can feelthe ΓÇ£I canΓÇÖt believe this!ΓÇ¥ tinge to the joke. Probably the angriest Gulman gets on the album is when heΓÇÖs taking shots at Blockbuster. While he takes the piss out of the companies exorbitant late fees and ΓÇ£criminally loose definition of ΓÇÿNew ReleasesΓÇÖΓÇ¥ you still can tell heΓÇÖs smiling as heΓÇÖs doing so. HeΓÇÖs not mean, just delivering fully realized jokes that consistently please. You like 
Gary Gulman, you root for him and it allows you to like him even as heΓÇÖs ripping something apart. DonΓÇÖt make the mistake; even though heΓÇÖs nice about it, Gary Gulman is a total killer. A routine that only comes from too many hours of stage time.
