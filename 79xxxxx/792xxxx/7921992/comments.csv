2. Don't start the program after install is finished.
3. Copy Artisteer.exe from folder Crack
4. Paste in Artisteer directory witch is
C:/Program Files/Artisteer 4/bin
Than start the program and everything should work fine :)

(If you have issue during installation make sure you have installed Framework on your Computer)
