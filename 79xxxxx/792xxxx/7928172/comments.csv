,hombrep,2012-12-16T06:20Z,"just to clear, I tagged ""Fernando Pessoa"" as ""The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis"" is a book about him - see more here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Pessoa#Ricardo_Reis"
,hombrep,2012-12-18T19:07Z,"""Blindness"" is his most famous work, with a film about the book with Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, Gael GarcĂ­a Bernal and Danny Glover starring on it:

The director is the Brazilian Fernando Meirelles

There is a second part of this book, which unfortunately Audible did not paid attention to record it, the book ""Seeing"" - The epub file has the book on print, though.

""The Gospel According to Jesus Christ"" will be the work to follow this reading:

Each book has its own characteristics, there is no a better one, all of them are worth it. My suggestions are based on references that the reader can be familiar with. ""The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis"" for example is a great book for Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa's fans, since it is about his life.

Cheers!!!"
