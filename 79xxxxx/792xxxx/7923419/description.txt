The Dark Ages have been misunderstood. History has identified the period 
following the fall of the Roman Empire with a descent into barbarism - a 
terrible time when civilisation stopped. 

Waldemar Januszczak disagrees. In this four-part series he argues that the Dark 
Ages were a time of great artistic achievement, with new ideas and religions 
provoking new artistic adventures. He embarks on a fascinating trip across 
Europe, Africa and Asia, visits the world's most famous collections and 
discovers hidden artistic gems, all to prove that the Dark Ages were actually 
an 'Age of Light'. 

Along with Christianity, the Dark Ages saw the emergence of another vital 
religion - Islam. After emerging in the near East it spread across North Africa 
and into Europe, bringing its unique artistic style with it. Waldemar examines 
the early artistic explorations of the first Muslims, the development of their 
mosques and their scientific achievements.
