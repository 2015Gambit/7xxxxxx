[X-Art] Baby, Mira (Lipstick Lesbians / 15.12.12)

LIPSTICK LESBIAN: "The Expression is slang Used in the United States to describe Lesbian and Bisexual Women Who Exhibit Extremely Feminine Gender attributes, such as wearing make-up (THUS, Lipstick), wearing Dresses and Skirts or having characteristics Associated with Other Women Feminine. "

The Term is Thought to have emerged in Wide usage DURING the early 1990s. A 1997 episode of the television show Ellen, widely publicized the phrase. In the show, Ellen DeGeneres, when asked by her parents whether a certain woman is a "dispstick lesbian", explains that the term is "lipstick lesbian", and comments that "I would be a Chaptick lesbian." (This is All per Wikipedia)

Sooo, now you know. And now I bet you want to watch these really feminine, bisexual beauties their first time together! Actually, We Already Posted Scenes of a Baby with Susie and Anneli, but this was both Actually Mira's and Baby's FIRST time with Another Girl EVER (this was shot before Those).

Watch as They tentatively Explore each others Feminine parts and kiss. Then enjoy as they truly discover the benefits of the softer sex. They Pretty Quickly Figure out How to Bring the Other to Orgasm with Their mouths and fingers.

They prefer Men as Partners life, but I believe They Will be enjoying both Sexes for a Long time now.

Very cool HD video Coming next of These absolutely Stunning girls! And the video is much more explicit than the photos. XO ~ Colette

PS I bet you guys wish all girls / women were lipstick lesbians!
