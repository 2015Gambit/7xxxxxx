You play as Rohn, a dragon rider in the Asylian army fighting
against the supposedly evil Mokai. You can sense from the start
that there's something creepy about the religious dedication of the
Asylians, so the story twists that appear later aren't exactly
shocking. However, the cutscenes that move the story along are
terrific, giving you a real sense of the culture and backstory.
They are also frequently intrusive, interrupting gameplay every two
or three minutes with a brief clip to remind you of your mission
objectives, as if the last four cutaways would let you forget.
