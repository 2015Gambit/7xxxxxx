,darkpoet1978,2012-12-15T07:39Z,"broshizzy - less than 24 hours after initial upload on a 11GB torrent, and you whine about seeders?  Karma says you better seed this 10:1 now or risk getting kicked in your fake plastic balls."
,Bjellesau,2012-12-15T16:56Z,"Damd, Thanks a lot. What a golden share!!!

But im ssome sort of confused: You call it FLAC, but says ""These are genuine high-quality 320kbps MP3s"".

Please clear out the misunderstanding.

Is it pure flac files or is is 320kbs mp3's converted to flac??

Best wishes."
,darkpoet1978,2012-12-15T18:46Z,Sorry.  I cut and paste the comment from my MP3 upload.  But these are genuine FLAC files - check the ZIP of log files included if you want to be 100% sure!
,darkpoet1978,2012-12-15T20:13Z,Looks like I forgot to rename the På Österåker folder name... sure hope your system can handle diacritics!
