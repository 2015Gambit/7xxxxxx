Man in Black Project - The Complete Columbia Album Collection FLAC

Oh my God, here are FLAC files!  These are pretty much the same as my MP3 upload, but with some minor changes to tags and filenames.  Enjoy!

I was working on a high quality discography of Johnny Cash when I learned the  Complete Columbia Album Collection was released...  So, I've decided to release my Man in Black Project in parts.

Yes, I know the Columbia Collection is available elsewhere.  I've seen it.  It's a hurried release but with good quality.  I've corrected the tags, spelling, and added album art.  I've also combined the Gospel Road and Singles double-CDs into one folder/track-listing.

Everything is tagged under the genre "Country" except the "Christmas" albums.  Collaborations have also been properly separated.  I've got my own way of doing things and hopefully this collection will gel into your already existing collection easily...

Of course, I have checked.  These are genuine high-quality 320kbps MP3s.

Keep an eye out for the next part of the Man in Black Project, which should blow you away.
