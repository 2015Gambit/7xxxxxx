,ryballs,2012-12-17T22:58Z,Did you change the shaders to maximum in options? It causes weird colours..
,ryballs,2012-12-18T07:39Z,I'll take that as a yes.
,kvekan,2012-12-23T01:16Z,"Awesome upload, installed great and all. But I do have one quite annoying problem: Every time in game when I try to build a smeltery I get an access violation error and then the game crashes to desktop. Any solutions? Haven't found anything on the net. Thanks!"
