Harry Belafonte's 1959 benefit concert at Carnegie Hall drew raves from the critics and public. RCA's Living Stereo recording was instantly hailed as one of the best-sounding concert recordings of the era and remains highly collectable among audiophiles. Many of Belafonte's hits are here, but it's far more than a singer doing his best-known numbers for adoring fans. It was a coming together of artist, music and audience that would not be rivaled until Judy Garland took the stage at Carnegie Hall some years later. This is a digital version of RCA's Living Stereo 4-track double-play tape version of the two-disc album. No splices. No ticks. No pops. Just great music.
