By the way, man, when uploading something, it is because you wanna share something tha makes things easy for other people, not for your EGO, which seems to be waaaaay muuuuuch bigger tahn your capacity to give a simple way to register. Anyway, don't download this crap if you are a regular user of pc's, you will have to be almost a hacker to register, look around for good uploaders; i'am sure you're gonna find other alternatives. "

,Slpwlkr,2012-12-23T18:49Z,"usuario2, ""crap""? Seriously?

Followed the steps in the NFO file but I had to do some changes in step 2.

I had to use my local IP instead of the 127.0.0.1:8080 in the ""VCSProfile.xml"" to make it work e.g. ""http://192.168.2.7:8080/reg.txt"" (192.168.2.7 is the static local IP I use).

That's it, the application is working perfectly well.

Thanks for sharing!"
