Probably shouldn't burst such a heartfelt and noble bubble, so maybe me being extraordinarily late with this comment will not see you back here to be dashed by it.

At least it'll be unlikely for me to come back here to witness it.

I, like many others are what's called ""re-encoders"". I don't have a TV, well, I do, but it's not connected to an antenna or cable - just a computer monitor to me. I rely solely on MP4 & MKV to create my XVID AVI. Just being able to avoid the tedious editing and subsequent potential sync problems is worth my somewhat second-class status. I won't mention my brethren as one burst bubble is sufficient to land me in purgatory - I won't make it worse.

Here's how you can tell the level of my deviousness. If it says 624x352 then I used an MP4 source and it's a 2pass process. if it says 640x360 then it's a higher quality MKV source, but single pass encoding. I have yet to hear (noodges discounted) a definitive amount of feedback for one over the other. I personally think the MP4 source is a bit softer somehow, but that may be entirely theatre-of-the-mind on my part.

And now what I really wanted to say - oops, I goofed. see that odd nine letter ""tag"" above? It's actually a bayimg code that was supposed to put a picture on this detail page. Like that Mad About You episode where Jamie is trying this complicated recipe and the last step is the strainer and she lets the prized liquid go down the sink and keeps the useless pulp. heh.
