This torrent is a combo video and instruction manual. The L.I.N.E. system was used before the Corps adopted the modern MCMAP system in use today. The L.I.N.E. system was geared toward finishing off an opponent by killing them. The manual is very detailed and outlines all techniques of L.I.N.E. The video shows some of the techniques but not all.
