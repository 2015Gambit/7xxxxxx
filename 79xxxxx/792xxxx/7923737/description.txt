First addition to my artist specials. Rihanna (26 becomes 33) will be replaced by Dave Matthews (to pair the ladies Christina, Swift, Beyoncé and Alicia). Some minor additions and corrections were made. All files were renamed to to suit (play sequence) a car radio. A perfect set for your Christmas Holidays....

Enjoy and a Merry Christmas and a Happy new year.
