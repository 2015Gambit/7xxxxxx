Trinity and Beyond is an unsettling yet visually fascinating documentary presenting the history of the design, development, production and testing of nuclear weapons between 1945 until 1963 presenting mankind's most ambitious effort at perfecting the means to its own annihilation.

The quality of these images is as startling as are remarkable. With new footage shot with hi-definition cameras, this award-winning production also features an amazing explosion segment that must be seen with 3D glasses to truly take in its full impact.

On July 16, 1945, at a site called Trinity, a plutonium bomb was assembled and brought to the top of a tower. The bomb was detonated, producing an intense flash and a fireball that expanded to 600 meters in two seconds. The explosive power was equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. It grew to a height of more than 12 kilometers, boiling up in the shape of a mushroom. Forty seconds later, the blast of air from the bomb reached the observation bunkers, along with a long and deafening roar of sound. And so began the ATOMIC AGE...
