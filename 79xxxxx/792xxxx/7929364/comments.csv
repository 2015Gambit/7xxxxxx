,Striker1211,2012-12-18T13:52Z,"Warning: Digital signature of file ""TurboTax 2012 Installer.exe"" is corrupted, ie the file has been tampered with since signing. "
,wjigjawirojiw,2012-12-20T16:35Z,The setup file (TurboTax 2012 Installer.exe) is unsigned and my antivirus software goes nuts.  The setup file in the home directory is signed (setup.exe) but it calls the unsigned file in the subdirectory.  I wouldn't download or use this.  All the other files (MSI and EXE) are signed.  Very suspicious.
,pfslow,2012-12-27T00:54Z,"The file appears to be way too small at 86.21MB.

The Mac and PC versions both come on the same disk. It would be nice if someone seeded the whole thing."

,surferbroadband,2013-01-03T01:13Z,"Why do people write untruthful comments? I did not put up this torrent, but I did download, and it works FINE! Are those people putting up comments stooges for Intuit?"

""This digital signature is not valid"" Good luck typing in your social security number and all your other personal financial information into a modified program."
