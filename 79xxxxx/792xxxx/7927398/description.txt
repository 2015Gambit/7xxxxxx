Storyline:
John Nada is a man without job who walks around a big American city trying to find something to do.
He finally finds a job as a worker and a place to spend the nights, but one day something terrible happens to him.
John discovers a pair of sun-glasses through which he can see the true face of people. Many persons in this city are in fact aliens
(from the Andromeda) and most of them are important members of our society.
They keep humans in ignorance and they rule our world as they like.
Nada must find the rest of the men that know what's happening (those who made the strange sun-glasses) and join them in the fight against the aliens.
