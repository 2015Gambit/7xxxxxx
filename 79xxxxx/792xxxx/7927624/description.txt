Episode 2 - The Strangled Queen (2005)

King Philippe is deeply affected by the deaths of the Pope and one of his most trusted advisors, Guillaume de Nogaret, which he blames on the curse of the Grand Master of the Knights Templar. Obsessed with the curse, Philippe starts wasting away and dies shortly afterward.

With PhilippeΓÇÖs eldest son, Louis X, on the throne, Robert of Artois intensifies his scheming to reclaim the County of Artois from his aunt Mahaut. To gain the support and trust of the new king, he allies himself with the kingΓÇÖs uncle Charles of Valois and plots to undermine the once influential chamberlain, Enguerrand de Marigny.
King Louis seeks a new wife to provide him with an heir and ensure the succession, but is hindered by the fact he is still married to Marguerite of Burgundy, who has been imprisoned for adultery in the Tour de Nesle Affair. Furthermore, a new pope has not been elected and so his marriage cannot be annulled.

He sends Robert of Artois to Marguerite in an attempt to coerce her into writing a letter stating that their marriage was never consummated and that her daughter is illegitimate. She writes the letter, but the king does not receive it, and another solution must be foundΓÇª
