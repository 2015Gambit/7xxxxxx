Very Tragic that shooting - A Prayer for all the little ones who's life was cut so short"
,katien44,2012-12-16T06:52Z,"thankyou Ms fenmore for your ongoing support for us all,I am so sad for the familys of the poor little ones and their teachers that were so senslessly gunned down in cold blood,the poor little ones did nothing to anyone now their parents have to plan funerals instead of wrapping gifts,It's hard to fathom how this could happen,I and lots of others will say a special prayer for them and hold them in our hearts."
