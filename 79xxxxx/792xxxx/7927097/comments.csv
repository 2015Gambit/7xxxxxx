,tetnem,2012-12-30T06:43Z,"This book is one of Tolkien best masterpieces. I love all his books, but I must admit that Lord of The Ring trilogy and The Hobbit is his best works. They are some of the best books in the fantasy genre. I have read the book once time before in Norwegian, but I want to read it again,  despite for the new movie that are the first part in The Hobbit trilogy. My second reason is that this time I want to read it on it's original language.  

But anyway, thank you very much for this upload! I really appreciate your effort with this book. "
