Blake Edwards' hilarious poison-pen letter to Hollywood details what happens when a fabulously successful producer (Richard Mulligan)suddenly has a multimillion dollar flop. His wife (Julie Andrews) leaves him. Lawyers descend. Gossips columnists spill oceans of bile. Friends go into hiding. What does the producer do? He turns the flop into an artsy porn movie. Based on his own experiences after the disasters Darling Lili and The Wild Rover, the film is very much an insiders movie, sly and cynical and mostly very funny. It was William Holden's last movie and the only film in which Julie Andrews goes topless.
