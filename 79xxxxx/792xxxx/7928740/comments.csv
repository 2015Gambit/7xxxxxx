,eXindigo,2012-12-20T00:28Z,This is an absolutely great movie. I still have the Nat Geo that finally published the story. Subtitles a little off but are clean and understandable. I give it a V 10 A 9.5. Subs 8. I would have liked to have the ending descriptions of what happened to the crew translated but I did a google search and got the info that way. All in all a very excellent job and THANK YOU!
