Ethan Hunt and the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) are brought into an investigation of a shady international corporation, known as SURMA, that is in possession of a highly advanced computer virus known as Ice Worm. It has the power to break through any type of security system and could lead to the theft of any data ranging from nuclear weapons specs to intelligence of any government. When their own operations are sabotaged, Ethan and the IMF team find out that their secure databases have been hacked and that their enemies are now in possession of some of their deepest, darkest secrets. The team must find this worm to protect global internet security.

This is a Stealth,Action, Third-Person shooter, I have included PCXS2 v 1.0 with all you need to run this game on PC, including pictures of a configuration setting that works perfectly for me.
