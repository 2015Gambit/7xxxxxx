On Friday night, July 20th, 2012 the sleepy town of Aurora, Colorado gained national prominence for all the wrong reasons. Media reports have a lone gunman by the name of James Eagan Holmes entering the Cinema 16 theatre showing of the Dark Knight Rises, tossing tear gas grenades to stun the crowd and the indiscriminately firing into the stunned mass of people.

When the carnage was over, 12 people lay dead and 58 more were wounded, with hundreds more psychologically scarred for life. The deed was so horrific that it sounds like the work of a fictional character.

Surely enough, within hours the media would report that a lone young man, with his hair painted red, and harboring an obsession with the Joker character of Batman fame, had committed the atrocity.

We have seen these sorts of tragedies quite a bit in recent history and the accused certainly fits the profile we have come to know as that of perpetrators in such events. Still, something is just not right about James Eagan Holmes and the story the media has carefully crafted for the viewing public.

Somewhere deep in the bowels of our society, underneath the rosy surface a greater evil than any lone murderer is creeping, evolving, and growing by the minute.
