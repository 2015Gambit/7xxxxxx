[V],GunningHawk90,2012-12-16T18:05Z,I'm never gonna upload another Spiderman comic again.
[T],STFmaryville,2012-12-16T18:23Z,"LOL is that because it sucks or because it leaked GunningHawk90?

I just want to point out, this is not a .CBR file but a handful of shitty .JPG photos (Iphone maybe?), a variant cover and what looks like a screen grab from a message board somewhere."
,danhimself,2012-12-16T19:19Z,this shouldn't have been uploaded at all...Dan Slott and the people of Marvel have been going out of their way to try and make sure that this story isn't spoiled and there are others who are going out of their way to spoil it for everyone...you can't judge a story by seeing a few shitty pics...you should read it the way it was meant to be read on the day that it's released just like everyone else...these people so infatuated with spoiling things for others are ruining the experience of reading comics for the rest of us
[V],GunningHawk90,2012-12-16T22:26Z,"C'mon guys ! You really can't blame the uploader. It clearlt says it contains spoilers. If you don't like 'em, just don't download 'em.

STFM mate, I wasn't pleased when they said Pete wasn't the Superior Spidey. And, by giving the Spidey mantle to this guy, they're tarnishing Spidey's leagacy. Anyways, I really hope these're fake, and we still have 'our' Pete."
[T],STFmaryville,2012-12-17T03:52Z,"danhimself, actually Slott helped create the frenzy to spoil 700 when he threatened fans, colleagues, etc. with permabanning from his social media feeds. (Not sure why anyone would give a crap.) Furthermore the editor Wacker enjoys being an ass to online fans every chance he gets, I dunno if that would make someone want to spoil his book's secret, but there it is. Third, again Wacker and again assuming it's not a clever misdirection ploy, why THE FUCK would he (or any editor) let promo copies go out and not expect this. It's ridiculous.

GunningHawk90, agreed. Agreed agreed & agreed again. To play devil's advocate, I haven't read the book since Strazcynski quit. But this storyline (well, the hype of it) drew me back in.

Final note, this variant cover is Joe Rubenstein but I was thinking they announced it as a John Romita Sr. cover. Wonder what happened?"

,Doc_T,2012-12-17T22:09Z,"I don't see the problem with this upload.  I for one, appreciate it.  The uploader stated exactly what this is;  ""Leaked Spoilers and 3 pages""....  So, what's the problem.  You don't want to see the spoilers, then don't download them...  They were ""leaked"" on purpose.  They were  MEANT to be seen."
[T],STFmaryville,2012-12-18T03:35Z,"thanks for the covers hombrep! Ditko variant f-in rocks! there is also a quesada variant, and a sketch version of the same."
,hombrep,2012-12-19T15:29Z,"re-covers- No probs! Marvel.com always releases all covers of each issue in advance - scanners should know that to save some work, as I see many uploads missing their respective variants! It is just a matter to go to marvel.com, load the variants and add to the issue to be uploaded. spread this word among your Empire+DCPP friends!!!"
