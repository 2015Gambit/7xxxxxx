 When it comes to touring, no band delivers live
 the way Metallica does
 Quebec Magnetic video Their shows
 which began in clubs and garages in the early 80's
 now sell out in arenas and stadiums
 throughout the world
 and continue to be among the most intense
 powerful and visually stimulating concert
 experiences ever delivered
 Quebec Magnetic film One such concert
 experience happened in Quebec city
 Quebec on Halloween weekend 2009
 These shows were recorded live and compiled by
 the band and director Wayne Isham
