,stevem485,2012-12-17T01:16Z,Did they not televise the full event?
,BasilBrush,2012-12-31T17:36Z,"It was televised on European Eurosport live but only the highlights were available the following day on British Eurosport.

You get better biathlon and cross-country coverage on European Eurosport satellite 19.2°E rather than British Eurosport on 28.2°E.

I tried asking Sky if my decoder card for 28.2°E would decode Eurosport on 19.2°E but they said no it wouldn't. You need a Sky card from France or Germany and you need a dish pointing at 19.2°E.

Take a look at the Kingsofsat website:

,BasilBrush,2012-12-31T17:50Z,If you search for Eurosport at the kingsofsat website you'll see all the satellites carrying Eurosport streams. Some have English audio.
