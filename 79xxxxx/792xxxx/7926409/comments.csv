,TPBGurl,2012-12-17T18:38Z,"@coachtsr Welcome to Hollywood USA! smh.. lol

Little bit of info..
Seal Team 6 was interviewed for the movie. Back in the summer there was a lot of news about Obama/State Dept releasing too much details and classified info to the writer of the movie. Not sure if it will make the movie better, worse, more truthful, or more bullshit. lol Either way, hopefully it will be good ;)

Anyway.. TY4UL +1 :)"

,Icarus2020,2012-12-24T23:48Z,"ANYTHING that reminds us how we took out this piece of crap and shot him like the pedophile animal he was, is worth watching.  I don't care how cheap the movie is.  Is going to be a great reminder of a GOOD day for American and any decent human being out there!"
