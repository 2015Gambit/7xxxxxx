"Glee, Actually"

In an homage to the beloved holiday 
film "Love, Actually," seemingly 
separate storylines come together to 
form one merry GLEE episode. As the 
end of 2012 draws near, Sam and 
Brittany live their lives to the 
fullest before the Mayan Apocalypse 
occurs. Meanwhile, Jake and Puck 
spend quality sibling time together 
for Hanukah, Artie has a holiday 
dream that changes his outlook on 
life and Kurt has a Christmas he'll 
never forget.
