,1motime,2012-12-15T15:05Z,Is update v1.0.438.0. needed first before installing this update?
,1motime,2012-12-15T15:13Z,n/m... reading is fundamental. 
,arrow_in_the_knee,2012-12-15T16:22Z,"Thanks for the updates but why are they that big? If anyone knows, do tell.

I read on steam forums, i believe, someone wrote that the first update was only around 300 mb and it sounds credible since once i installed the 7 GB version only around 300 mb were occupied at the end of the install. For this one i predict around 1 gig tops."
