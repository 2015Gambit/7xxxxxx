As for the uploading, the performance is successful, no problem : a .dmg disk-image is mounted on the desktop, allowing the installation of the app. in final outcome. Quite fast downloading by the way

Buuuut : as the app. is not cracked, and in the absence either of a serial, the slightest  use of the app. is made impossible. For completing its launching, any app. belonging to the 'Toon-Boom' folder requires an activation. What's the purpose of uploading such a useless file, I ask, even the 'demo' mode being unavailable for giving a try?"

btw, why you downloadin then? 
in description was clearly written ''no crack and no regkey'' 

( ''iSerial Reader'' has that regkey if you don't knew)"
,macomaniac,2012-12-17T09:37Z,"Quote : ÂŤ""iSerial Reader'' has that regkey if you don't knewÂť. Smart advice indeed : iSerial Reader (2.0.11) offers but a registration key for old versions of 'Toon Boom Studio' (3.5.1 et 4.5), and nothing related to 'Harmony' (as far as I am able to read a list of apps in alphabetic order).

As the package is not downloadable from the Toon Boom site in demo mode (http://www.toonboom.com/downloads/), and myself having very neatly read the forewarning the app wasn't cracked, at least was I expecting a possible 'trial period' from that file, which is not the case.

I can nevertheless mitigate my previous judgement about the uselessness of that file. Useless as I am concerned, but giving an available package for whatsoever team to crack the app. Very narrow purpose though."
