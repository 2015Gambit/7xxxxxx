KMSNano - The Ultimate Activator by heldigard
Based on the work of Ratiborus's KMSmicro v3.10

This is v9.  There are other earlier versions that may or may not work currently.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

KMSnano - is the ideal tool to activate the final version of Windows 7/8 and
Office 2010/2013. Activator does not require user intervention, the entire
activation process takes place in the background, just run the activator
and a couple of minutes to check the activation status of Windows and / or Office.

KMSnano can Activate All Editions Of windows Under Volume Licence

Activates: Windows Vista / 7 / 8 Pro / Enter / N / VL and Windows Server Std /
Data 2008/2008R2/2012, as well as Office 2010/2013.

Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Extract the KMSnano_v9.rar file.
2. Extract the LaNanov9.zip file.
3. Run KMSnano.exe
4. Make sure to allow the windows firewall to have access.
5. Wait a FEW MINUTES while the files run in the background.
(It doesn't let you know when it's done, you can check task manager or just wait a bit)
6. Run the Check_Activation.cmd to verify your KMS activation status.
7. Go about your business. You can get the watermark to go away by auto-hiding the taskbar or similar system stuff.

Why use this program over any other activation method?
Because it runs a mini-system emulator with the KMS activation software.
It does not modify any of your system files.
Because it's not a crack or a hack.
Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
Did I mention it activates ALL of the recent KMS activation software?

Apologies to whomever I copied some of that description from, I didn't put your name down.
Thanks for the tipoff TheOnionRex.
