Windows 7 Explorer For Windows 8 v1.0 | 3.37 Mb

This program restores native Windows 7 start menu and desktop by bringing Windows 7 explorer.exe.
Start menu retains full configurability you expect from Windows 7 start menu.
This program includes sophisticated lightweight wrapper, install/uninstall/patch program.
You can use it on Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012 RTM or RP versions, any edition, any language!

PRECAUTIONS:
This program does not modify system files and system protected registry entries.
You can switch back to unaltered Windows 8 UI any time.
Windows 7 shell is enabled only to users which switched to it.
Other users can use Windows 8 shell without any problems.

LIMITATIONS:
* Metro (Modern) UI is not loaded into memory. As a bonus you save dozens MB of RAM.
* Metro UI screens and programs are unavailable.
* Toasts (like "You have new program to handle this stuff") won't show. You need to use Default programs to change associations.
* You may get more UAC prompts.
* No default language input indicator. Enable language bar via Control Panel->Language->Advanced Settings->Use desktop language bar.
* No multi-monitor taskbars. Maybe more multimon issues.
* No immersive hotkeys (Win+X, Win+PrtScr too).

INSTALLATION:
Launch Ex7ForW8_setup.exe. Follow instructions. You'll need Windows 7 installation DVD or files ready; keep in mind that they should be same language and bitness.

UNINSTALLATION:
Uninstall program from Programs and Features. If you're using portable install, just switch shell to Windows 8 and delete folder.

ALSO NOTE:
All Programs shown in explorer7 has the same shortcuts that explorer8 shows on Start Screen. So the changes you do reflect here and there; better backup desktop.lnk from start menu.

Explorer Ribbon is still there, it's not explorer.exe related!
Using explorer.exe from Windows 8 DP or other Windows versions is not supported and won't be.
