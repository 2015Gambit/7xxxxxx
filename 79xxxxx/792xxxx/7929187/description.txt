Jutoh Features


Formatting
Jutoh supports paragraph and text formatting. You can add custom paragraph styles to the built-in styles, and you can specify custom CSS for each style (or the whole style sheet) if required.
Multiple format export
Jutoh exports to Epub, Mobipocket (if the kindlegen application is available), ODT, single-page HTML, and text.
HTML, text, DOCX, ODT, and Epub import
Jutoh imports from a range of formats. Using an application such as OpenOffice.org, your existing word processor files can be saved in ODT (Open Document Format) for import into Jutoh. Or you can import from DOCX, plain text, HTML, or an existing Epub ebook. (Note that complex CSS style definitions may not be preserved when importing from HTML or Epub.)
'Configurations' allow extensive customisation
Jutoh's configuration facility allows you to define a version of your book that has its own cover, style sheet, and even variations in content (such as a title page with text specific to a web site or publisher).
