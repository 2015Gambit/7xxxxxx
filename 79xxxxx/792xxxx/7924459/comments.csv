""Portlandia"" coming in January on IFC features [Fred] Armisen, [Carrie] Brownstein and guest stars satirizing such alternative-culture types as the owners of a feminist book store, a bike messenger, a punk-rock couple, and an arty duo obsessed with putting little cut-outs of birds on anything they lay their hands on.
