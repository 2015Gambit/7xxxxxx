,batman79,2012-12-29T10:50Z,Stop labeling shit HDTV when its not HD
,N37iM,2012-12-29T20:37Z,"i love this tv show,thanks asdwiv,,,but my only question is:why this season have only 8 episodes,,,i mean 1st season was 6 episodes,2nd was 13,and 3rd is 8 episodes,..its just too litle episodes for very good tv show"
,leandro2121,2012-12-29T23:56Z,@N37iM is only the midseason the other 8 premiere on february i think.... btw this isnt HD terrible quality man
,LG_,2012-12-30T14:19Z,Should not be labelled as COMPLETE when it is only half a season
,Serviceinstaller,2013-01-03T06:37Z,"To LG_:  You fucking asshole.  This guy uploaded 8 episodes of The Walking Dead which, to this date, are the only 8 of this season which have been aired.  It ends on a mid season finale.  Any fan of the show fucking knows this.  Not only are you a fucking idiot, you have the audacity to quip about what asdwiv uploaded while your worthless ass benefits from his effort?  Fuck you and everyone like you."
,wildz21,2013-01-04T00:15Z,"Sound is ok.
Video is ok.
No problem so far...
Probably not the BEST quality (not HD but still pretty good), I'm entirely satisfied.

Thank you."
,0196,2013-01-06T01:49Z,"it is hdtv.. you people just didn't read that he put 480p on it's tag. 480p is hd, just lower quality hd. thanks asdwiv. @batman79 @leandro2121 @wildz21"
,kingofmiami6,2013-01-07T13:28Z,the ones on here bitching and cryin will be the first ones to get eaten by walkers lmao
,Wetrix,2013-01-07T21:00Z,"HDTV means high definition television... which was primarily defined once media was available BEYOND 480p; 480p is NOT HDTV and therefore makes the tag incorrect and more of an oxymoron.

The 3rd season ended with a mid-season finale, but that makes it INCOMPLETE as a WHOLE because it is UNFINISHED. Not everyone who downloads it will know this, which is why the title is WRONG once again.

Please, don't fight over facts here. I understand: This guy put in his time, some effort, and some care. There is absolutely nothing wrong with stating the truth that this is far from hdtv and complete, so stop denying it to justify his mistakes.

Anyway, take care guys, and enjoy the show."
