Yes, you totally know what you are doing..."

Never had an actual nemesis before - welcome back.

The 1536Kbps was for something I considered truly special.
My QI posts (not my rips) are all 1500+ bit rates, so it's more standard than you'd think. Yesterday's XL is nowhere to be seen yet, but it apparently did broadcast.

You should read my ""general mission statement"" at the end of the description for:
The.Daily.Show.2012.12.12.Cory.Booker.PROPER.XVID-AVIGUY.avi

However, all that aside - you asked one very pertinent question:
Why the odd frame rates?

Did some testing and actually looking and found out where the problem lies:
MKV encoding ADDS frames. Not many, but enough to add up.
From 1 frame every 6 video minutes to as many as 6 frames every 6 video minutes.
This throws sync out from 300ms near the end of the video to a full two seconds.

AVC (AnyVideoConverter) does this
MeGui does this.
HandBrake does this
If you can think of another MKV converter, I'd like to try as much as I can.
It doesn't even have to encode to AVI (HandBrake does not).

My XIII.2 encodes don't suffer from this problem because I changed container to AVI and then encoded with VirtualDub and the source / encoding have exactly the same number of frames. In fact, I re-downloaded the XIII ep 213 from scratch and used it for this test. Originally 64991, AVC produces 64999, the other two both 65001.

Not all videos do this. My recent WEB-DL of Whitney did not.

Also, my curiosity still abounds over why you spend time in a place that will never offer what you want.
