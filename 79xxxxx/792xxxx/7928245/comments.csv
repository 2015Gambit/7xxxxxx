,KingFuller,2012-12-16T06:47Z,6 gb is HUGE ill wait for a smaller version. everyone starts out downloading the 6gb version until it gets to 25% completed then a 1.8gb version comes out and people delete your 6gb torent and start dling the 1.8gb file. so noones downloading ur file here. its not hard to shrink it to 1.8gbs whats wrong with you

Will be up in two and a half hours or so. "

Maybe you do that, but not everyone. There's always a few thousand downloads and peers constant on each torrent. If you don't like it, don't download. 6GB for a nearly 2 and a half hour event in HD with full frames is fine. It's not hard to shrink it, which is why I upload two versions. Wait, shut up, or get it from somewhere else. "
,Hoirc88,2012-12-16T07:08Z,Thanks for the first upload man gonna try to d/l this hopefully it goes fast or a smaller version comes out tonight.
