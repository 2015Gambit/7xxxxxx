This is the Box Festivais da Canção Vol 2.
40 years ago, on September 30, 1972, ended the seventh and final edition of the Festival Internacional da Canção (International Song Festival), which also marked the end of the era of festivals. The event broadcast by TV Globo and in the first year by TV Rio - and competed with Festival of MPB's Record - left a huge legacy. The most obvious are the MPB classics as "Saveiros", "Carolina", "Sabiá", "Andança", "Pra Não Dizer Que Não Falei das Flores", "BR-3", "Fio Maravilha", "Casa No Campo ". There are also revelatory moments of aesthetic and political tensions of the time, as the boos Nana Caymmi ("Saveiros"), Tom Jobim and Chico Buarque ("Sabiá"), Jards Macalé ("Gotham City") and Caetano Veloso ("É Proibido Proibir").
