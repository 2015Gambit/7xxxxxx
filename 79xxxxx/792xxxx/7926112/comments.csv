Thanks a bunch and please try to do this on every episode :]"
,Jouco,2012-12-15T16:07Z,I'm not a heavy uploader but since this is my favourite tv show of all times I feel I have to help all you other Gold Rush junkies out there get your saturday night dose!
,pjones452,2012-12-15T17:36Z,yea thanks a lot man I just can't stand commercials so I download thanks for your hard work
,m4now,2012-12-15T22:46Z,"I keep wondering how much of the show is scripted and staged. Coming back from Jungle Gold's Behind The Scenes episode, it seems like a big part of it is actually real.

Some parts are probably fabricated though, like when in Quartz Creek the Truck supposedly could not cross a bridge, i think they just added that problem for dramatic reasons."

Here in Portugal takes so long to show new episodes, and this version has a great quality! "

They need to add some dramatic components to the show, so they can creat some expectations from the viewers... but I believe that the actual goal from the guys, the gold richness, is real... "
,pjones452,2012-12-16T07:57Z,Yeah I second that
,Note2,2012-12-19T20:41Z,Neither ballistic versions works for me
