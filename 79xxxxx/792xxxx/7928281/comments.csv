patchesohullihan, 
I am no Android expert, but I found the /Android/obb-folder directly on the SD card (where I have my ""download"", ""pictures"", ""movies"" and so on) and just pasted in the folder.

I downloaded this with uTorrent for android, moved the folder with ES filemanager and just installed the apk."
