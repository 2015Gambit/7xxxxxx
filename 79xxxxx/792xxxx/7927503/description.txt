Garfield's Fun Fest

Storyline
Garfield's Fun Fest is the second Straight-to-DVD film of the Garfield franchrise. Jon Arbuckle was notably absent for an hour from the movie, and was only a cameo appearance character in the beginning, making Garfield's Fun Fest the movie to have the most smallest role of Jon Arbuckle. Almost every character, scenery, running gag, and background reappears in the movie, except the Reality World. It borrows the story plotline from Around The World In 80 Days and numerous parodies.

Garfield Gets Real

Storyline
Garfield, the mischievous cat with the deadpan delivery, is less than satisfied with the 2-D constraints of the cartoon world. As fortune would have it, Odie the dog happens to drop a bone into a hole in the screen separating the cartoon world from the real one, and Garfield sees the perfect opportunity. Jumping through the hole, the orange cat finds himself in the real word - and it's not exactly what he'd hoped. It's cold, lonely, and uncomfortable, and what's more, none of the other cats believe he's the real Garfield from the comic strips. Now our hero needs to find a way back into the comfort zone of his cartoon home, before the newspaper discontinues his comic strip for good.
