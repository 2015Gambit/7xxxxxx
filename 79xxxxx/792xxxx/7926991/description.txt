 is taken for granted by her family. She is       
 ridiculed for her poor English by her husband    
 Satish and teenage daughter. Shashi is the       
 object of potshots by Satish, who has little     
 respect for her real talent and Sapna, her 7th   
 grade daughter who is ashamed to even introduce  
 her mother to her school folks and teachers      
 because her English is weak. However, her young  
 son Sagar loves her as she is.
