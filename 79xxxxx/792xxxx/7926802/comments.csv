I will be seeding this until 50:1 as I did we;re no angels (1955) when I uploaded that. I am in the process of trying to get a better quality copy of this movie.

A - 8
V - 7
M - 8

Just my opinion. Not bad at all, just not HD"

by any chance would "" One Special Night "" 1999 staring James Garner & Julie Andrews be in your collection . It would be much appreciated."

,tonyclem,2012-12-24T21:19Z,"I have never watched it, but I will tonight. I have always loved James Garner and it kinda seems like a loving and committed to another storyline like The Notebook. I may be way off, but I only read a little about it and I know I love James Garner . . . So I will expect One Special Night to be good and touching"
