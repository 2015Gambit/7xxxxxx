,synesthesik,2012-12-14T18:41Z,"Thanks for UL'ing this :)  

I wasn't sure anyone was going to b/c it's not a very well known/publicized game.  Quite a good game though.  "
,hollisb,2012-12-15T09:00Z,Works great. have you thought about uploading Stealth Bastard Deluxe?
,SirRems,2012-12-15T11:20Z,well it didn't worked for me... says no Open-something  file and dont start the game
,anemzero,2012-12-16T01:03Z,"What exactly is the point of cracking/repacking the steam version of a Humble Bundle game? 

The HB version is exactly the same, but doesn't even need to be cracked. Also, it was available months in advance of the Steam release."
,thaghost1,2012-12-18T03:10Z,"The game itself works fine, But I'm having an issue with the controls.. I have no idea why but my game won't allow me to aim or anything, When I press ESC my mouse slowly moves down to the bottom right corner.. Thought it may have been a gamepad plugged in but none are. Any thoughts? "
,MikeStrider,2012-12-20T09:31Z,If you are getting the OpenAL error. Download this file and run the exe. http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/Forms/AllItems.aspx
,edthatch,2012-12-22T16:40Z,"Great game, but I'm having a problem saving my game. When I end my game it says ""all game info will be saved"" but when I start the game again my save isn't there. Checked the savedata file and nothing there either. Anybody else having this problem? It would suck to have to play it all in one go."
,blizzard_beast,2012-12-23T04:55Z,"Thank you thenoobish for a great torrent.Also anyone getting the 'OpenAl' error , do exactly as MikeStrider said.I believe once you're at the OpenAl website (get there from his link) , it is the second Zip file from the top.Once you run it, you won't have any problems running the game.And to all the Pirate Bayers , PLEASE SEED! Don't be selfish.My rule of thumb is to at least seed the size of the torrent back to the community.Even though I usually end up seeding 3-6 times as much.Without US there will be no files to download.Happy New Year everyone! Guess 2012 was just another bullshit 'prophecy' to cash in on."
,MikeStrider,2012-12-23T06:09Z,Yah I cannot save either. I got to chapter 6 and then saved and exited. Next day I went to play and it loaded Chapter 2. Very upset. I even cried.
,MikeStrider,2012-12-24T09:30Z,Figured it out . I can now save files . As long as u run the exe as admin . lol . silly me
,thaghost1,2012-12-29T04:10Z,"@anemzero

Maybe it's because not many people know about the Humble Bundle is, Besides you still have to pay for the bundle, Torrents = Free, If you forgot."
