Software Info

In 2097, life is discovered on Mars. When your mission of first
popular casual gaming styles: the dual-stick shooter and the
matchcontact becomes trapped by a cave-in, you must master the
alien ecosystem to survive. Soon you stumble upon more than anyone
expected, and with time running out, you will make a decision that
determines the fate of a lost planet
Waking Mars is a one-of-a-kind adventure in which you jetpack through
subterranean Mars encountering a host of extraordinary alien lifeforms
that operate as a living, breathing ecosystem. Learn and master the
behaviors of these creatures to create ecosystems of your own design
if you are to survive and discover the secrets of Mars' past.
