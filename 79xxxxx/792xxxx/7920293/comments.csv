,starblaze80,2012-12-14T15:04Z,"@Ba1tuks, I wouldn't say it is fair at all, but loyal ppl like you and myself always look to make sure that ettv is the uploader ;)"
,Grailknight,2012-12-14T16:55Z,"Say what now...? Ettv didn't encode this episode, they are only distributing it as far as I'm concerned (?).

Private sites had the ASAP version at Dec 13 11pm UTC+1. "
