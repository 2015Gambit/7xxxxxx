,groggery,2012-12-14T22:25Z,"Can someone finally explain why i can't play this in fullscreen? It goes black, i can click the menus and the music keeps going, but i can't play. This should be written on the torrent itself as it's a major issue."
,jon8282,2012-12-14T23:25Z,"@groggery

That sucks... I haven't had that problem with any of the releases so far."
,fearithME,2012-12-15T02:25Z,"if you are using windows 7, make sure you have ""show hidden files"" enabled, then go to:


C:Users##YOUR USER NAME##AppDataLocalFLTSteam

i do not know how many folders you have in there, but it is one of them. you can delete them all IMO. either than or someone can be more descriptive."
,fearithME,2012-12-15T02:27Z,"it is not showing forward slashes for some reason.


C:*Users*##YOUR USER NAME##*AppData * Local*FLT*Steam

replace * with FORWARD SLASH
and ##YOUR USER NAME## with your user name"

,archblue1206,2012-12-15T19:55Z,"Dec 12 Hotfix
Here's a quick hotfix to address some bugs and do some tuning:

Bug fixes:
Profile saving should work again on Chrome.          Unfortunately, there's no way to get back any data that was lost to the bug while it was live.
The 1% phantom trap issue should be fixed.
There is a workaround available for those having trouble starting up with low-memory video cards (see below)


Tuning:
Krampus comes a little less frequently, and in smaller numbers.
Krampus will start to forgive naughtiness if you aren't naughty for a while. So you can still kill lots of bunnies with impunity if you pace yourself and diversify your food sources.
Krampus will target loose items on the ground before going after chests.
Krampus runs a little slower."

,Tosris,2012-12-21T02:36Z,"I had the same problem. I figured it out due to the name of the last .exe shown during the install process, ""dxwebsetup.exe"". You have to be connected to the internet during the install, as it opens a Microsoft DirectX installer."
