I found this missing from thepiratebay so I decided to share it.

This 18-episode series is a complete story of Russian aircraft. Every type of aircraft featured in this series: fighters, bombers, reconnaissance and attack aircraft, transport and passenger aircraft, hydroplanes, training and sports aircraft, naval aviation, WIG craft and air cushion vessels, helicopters.

I have a slow outbound speed so please bear with me and help me seed.
