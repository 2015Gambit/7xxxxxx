I wonder why the British establishment is so worried about this film. If it was just speculation they would surely ignore it, but they have not only not ignored it, but secretly been attacking it's distribution.
This film is also VERY damning of the corporate mainstream media.
I am going to make copies of this and distribute by hand, where it can be most effective. "
