Newark Mayor Cory Booker addresses his superhero reputation, the difficulties of living exclusively on government food stamps, his possible candidacy for governor of New Jersey, the importance of public investment and warns of a permanent recession if America can't fix its education gap and dumb politics in this exclusive, unedited interview.

This is two liberals stroking each other, but Booker makes some interesting arguments that some government programs eventually return more than they cost.

Of course neither of them make the observation that these goals, however noble, should not be paid for with stolen money (taxes).

Also, while decrying the need for better schools, better schools are only a partial fix for lower IQ. See The Bell Curve (book). In particular the public schools with entrenched teachers' unions, have not responded to increased spending with better results.
