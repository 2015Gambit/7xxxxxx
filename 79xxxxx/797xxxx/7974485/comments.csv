,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-31T12:16Z,"Is this standalone or is it necessary for us to watch the first one before this?

And is it comparable to any Anime out there? I did a quick search on this, but there doesn't seem to much on it.

,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-31T12:28Z,"Sorry, comment lag. Thanks for the link. I'll seed this in the meantime. "
,indi711,2012-12-31T12:48Z,I've seen the first part of this. I't would have to be a continuance I'd say. The first was pretty good hope this is too.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-31T12:53Z,"if your looking for something similar to hellsing to some degree but instead of the badass alucard, you replace it with a female, this is what you get, 

Its pretty good, Not as badass as hellsing but its rewarding overall."
