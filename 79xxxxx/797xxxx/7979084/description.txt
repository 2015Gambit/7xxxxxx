  Contraband Sky Grenade.
* Whether you have a Borderlands 1 saved game or not, you'll get an extra head and
  skin for the Commando, Assassin, Siren, and Gunzerker character classes.


	Other changes (all tested):
* You keep your Golden Key when opening the loot chest in Sanctuary. Yeah, you can
  loot that golden chest as often as you want.
* English, French, German, Italian and Spanish localizations are included.
* Standalone version: no Steam connection required.


Limitations:
* As this is a standalone version, all functions requiring Steam can't (and won't)
  work, so: no internet game, no Shift CodesΓÇª Don't lament, go buy the game.
  However, LAN multiplayer games do work.
* LAN games version restrictions still apply: don't mix versions of Borderlands 2,
  be it PC or Mac.
