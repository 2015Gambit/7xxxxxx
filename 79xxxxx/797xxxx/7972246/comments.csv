,beechyboy,2012-12-30T19:17Z,Wasn't Scam City ROME episode #4 that aired in June 24??  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2215532/
,A0976AX,2012-12-30T19:24Z,"According to IMDB, there are only 10 episodes presently and EP4 is Rome, there is no EP11"
,beechyboy,2012-12-30T20:50Z,"This is a Duplicate. Found out this is ep 09 Rome, ep 04 is Barcelona, IMDB is not reliable when it comes to tv shows."
,macwun,2012-12-31T14:25Z,Rome is episode 5 not episode 11
