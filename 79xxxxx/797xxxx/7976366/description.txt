Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch, 
reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot. 
As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle over unforgiving landscape, they experience the bombing of Darwin, 
Australia, by Japanese forces firsthand.
