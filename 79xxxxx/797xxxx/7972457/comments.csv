,drakic,2012-12-30T23:42Z,All movies are cropped too much in last few weeks! Why?! Height: 264 px ?!?! That is lower than my cell phone resolution!!!
,vcdman17,2012-12-31T04:09Z,Screeners are not high resolution. That is the nature of them. Good way to show appreciation for the upload by bitching!

near dvdrip quality :)"
,Juular,2012-12-31T16:43Z,drakic: The movie's aspect ratio is 2:35:1 according to iMDB so 264 sounds about about right to me as 1:85:1 is usually 304. but I could be wrong
