,extracube,2013-01-01T15:19Z,"Thanks for this.  I'm glad to see there are some who are enthusiastic about 7.  I use 7 but am looking for a different copy so this is right on time.  So far I basically refuse to go 8 until people start reporting that validation is 100%.  Likewise, I like my start button so 7 it is for the foreseeable future for me."

Your welcome :-)"
,westcoastst,2013-01-03T04:01Z,Hey Kaiser. I've noticed alot of the Windows 7 uploads on here have activation issues.  Is this one solid ?  Thx ; )
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-03T09:41Z,"@westcoastst

This one works just fine. The loader does the activation as part of the installation on this one. No need to run a loader post activation.
When you install your desired edition of windows from the torrent, you'll see the loader doing the activation right at the last stage of the install. 
Those who have issues with activation can just download the loader from the link below after the installation and run it or ""re-arm"" the installation.

,boyaccent,2013-01-06T02:07Z,"Okay, so I must be doing something wrong. 

1. I downloaded the ISO torrent. 

2. Burnt it on the disc using CyberLink

WITHOUT EXTRACTING the ISO files.

Seletected the ISO file from my hard drive. 

Selected Burn Settings: UDF2.0, Data DVD

3. Burn Finished

4. Restarted the PC with BIOS setup and chose my DVD drive as Boot Option# 1. 

f10 save & exit. 

5 PC Automatically restarts and I get a boot error saying: Unreadable from device. Please insert disc or boot device.....and I hit the wall there. 

Please let me know where I went wrong. Thanks a lot!

,gussrtk,2013-01-08T04:43Z,"I am having trouble with this version. 

Trying to install on a clean system. 

about 3 out of 4 times the Logo screen freezes, when I get to the Set up screen, it asks me for language, that's fine, click next, then I click INSTALL and it says missing files. I am using a Bootable USB loaded through powerISO. Should I try to Reload it and retry?"
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-08T18:01Z,"@gussrtk

I've had experience of making a bootable USB with PowerISO and when i load the Windows 7 files onto the USB through PowerISO and then go to install.
I find out that PowerISO has completely skipped writing the ""install.wim"" to the USB.

Use Win USB Maker from Josh Cell software to transfer the .ISO to a USB which is bootable and you should be fine. Link below:
