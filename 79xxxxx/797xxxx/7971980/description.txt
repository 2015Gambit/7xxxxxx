Ten years after entering the Meiji period following the restoration of the imperial house, Japan has rapidly gone from a land of war and turmoil to one of burgeoning peace and modernity. One day, Himura Kenshin, a wandering swordsman with a disarming charm and an unusual sword with a reversed blade, comes across Kamiya Kaoru, a young woman who succeeded her father's school of sword fighting. However, while growing modernity gives the new age a veneer of order, troubles both new and old plague Japan: Kaoru's school has recently lost its followers after a string of murders by an individual claiming to use techniques from the school, while the industrialist Takeda Kanry┼½ plots to amass arms through profits brought in by a highly-addictive preparation of opium. Kenshin's dark past also continues to follow him, and he is forced to confront it when a chain of events beginning with an assault on Kaoru's dojo suddenly takes place one day.
