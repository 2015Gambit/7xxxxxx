As with all Rifftrax movies if you want the original theatrical, or DVD version's of this movie then this is not the torrent you are looking for...
*******************************************************************************
Captain America: The First Avenger tells us the inspiring story of a skinny weakling who takes excessive quantities of a dangerous performance enhancing drug and becomes a national hero. Along the way he meets a girl, records propaganda films and defeats Sammy Sosa for the 1998 regular season Home Run title.

Standing in Captain AmericaΓÇÖs way is the evil Red Skull, who bears a striking resemblance to the father of the kid in ΓÇ£Son of The Mask.ΓÇ¥  Red Skull has developed some sort of laser, which he intends to use to achieve modest goals of establishing himself as a respected political figure in a small, manageable region of, weΓÇÖre just kidding, he intends on taking over the entire world.

Aiding Captain America is Tommy Lee Jones, who appears to have been 73 for the past three decades, his loyal sidekick Bucky, who weΓÇÖre pretty sure had some lines in the movie, and a guy named Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader "Dum Dum" Dugan who wears a bowler hat, ironic mustache and to re-emphasize, is named Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader "Dum Dum" Dugan.

You canΓÇÖt have an Avengers movie without several years of breathless hype and inflated expectations sure to leave fans disappointed The First Avenger, and Captain America certainly makes a case for filling that role, in that he becomes an Avenger and may even have done so before anybody else. Mike, Kevin and Bill are just happy to see Hitler get punched.
