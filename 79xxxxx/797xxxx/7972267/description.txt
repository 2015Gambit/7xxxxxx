UFO Sightings and abductions by aliens were the beginning, the tip of the iceberg. Dolores Cannon's work in hypnosis has taken the study beyond abduction. This accumulation of twelve years of cases includes: * Cases of missing time * Spacecraft from other dimensions and planes of existence * Condensed or distorted time * The differences and functions of various alien races * Much more Dolores traces the phenomenon from the simple to the complex. Exploring areas untouched by other investigators, she makes the unbelievable become acceptable and understandable.
