Click on the second option showing the lock symbol then click on Appdata. Click on roaming and then GmailNotifierPro. Then you will see the ConfigData XML. Took a few minutes to figure it out.
,PrinceCorwin,2013-01-01T20:32Z,Keygen didn't do anything. And right clicking on the configdata file didn't give me any option to EDIT. Nor could windows open the file. What am I doing wrong?
,jcord9194,2013-01-02T14:52Z,"You should be able to right click and edit on the ConfigData itself and have the choice to edit. It should be the second option on the list when you right click. Make sure you right click on ConfigData not ConfigData.xml.bck or ConfigData.xml.tmp. Copy the generated line from the keygen then highlight the  line in ConfigData and paste. Make sure the program is completly closed, including the taskbar. Good luck. I'm not sure but you may have to uninstall and do a fresh install all over again."
