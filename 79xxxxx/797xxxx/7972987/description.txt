Moomintroll and the Moomin family are characters loved by children and parents 
worldwide who have grown up listening to Finnish writer Tove Jansson's 
delightful stories about a group of philosophical trolls who face a range of 
adventures in Moominland. 

This documentary reveals the strong autobiographical slant in the Moomins 
series as it traces the author's own extraordinary story from living the 
bohemian life of an artist in war-torn Helsinki to becoming a recluse on a 
remote island in the Gulf of Finland. 

Enjoying unprecedented access to Jansson's personal archive, the film reveals 
an unconventional, brave and compelling woman whose creative genius extended 
beyond Moominland to satire, fine art and masterful adult fiction - not least 
her highly-regarded The Summer Book. With home movie footage shot by her long-
term female lover and companion, it offers a unique glimpse of an 
uncompromising fun-loving woman who developed love as the central theme of her 
work.
