Here it is, the infamous book by the most notorious writer of The Simpsons.  This is by John Swartzwelder, who has never appeared in public and is a rare glimpse into how the man thinks.  He has written many, but this particular book is the one that all the other Simpsons writers recommended on dvd commentaries.   

It's only 100 or so pages long, so it comes in many MANY flavours:
epub, lit, lrf, mobi, opf, pdf, and a mysterious "z" file that I don't know what to do with.  But I can confirm the epub works.

Enjoy!
