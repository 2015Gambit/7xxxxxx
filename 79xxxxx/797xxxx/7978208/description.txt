Of the album's 16 tracks, the first eight are more of a hook for the mainstream pop and crossover R&B audience. The standout track from this first half is by far the live track from DAngelo, Heaven Must Be Like This. Otherwise, this portion of the soundtrack has appeal, but is at times typical of the genre and moment, lacking in substance. The depth of the soundtrack begins with a selection from Chaka Khan (track nine), Don't Talk 2 Strangers, is also to be found on her 1998 NPG Records debut, Come 2 My House. From here on out, the music is much more listenable and impressive for its creative output than its commercial appeal.

A pleasant surprise is the track from Angelou friends and past collaborators Ashford and Simpson, whose Uh Uh Ooh Ooh Look Out Here It Comes, is just a slice of heaven. Additionally, the seductive Tracie Spencer offering The Rain, is lovemaking music at its best and a great reintroduction to the beloved diva. A few stumbles along the way, but overall, a very satisfying and enjoyable listening experience. (allmusic.com)
