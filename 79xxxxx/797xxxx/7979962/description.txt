Treehouse - Build An Interactive Website with jQuery

This course is designed to quickly lead you through the steps of building an interactive website, and will walk you through the basics of JavaScript and jQuery from the very beginning. JavaScript is the interactivity or behavioral layer of a front end website and is used to add polish and enhance the user experience.

This project will walk us through the basics of jQuery and JavaScript and add interactivity to the Smells Like Bakin' website. 

Author Andrew Chalkley simplifies the coding process, with straightforward steps you can recreate on your own. The course explains the basic structure of JavaScript, shows how to add interactivity with jQuery, and introduces the jQuery Plugin Directory 

From there, we'll add image sliders, Google Maps, and show you how to use pre-written plugins to add unique interactive elements to your own site.
