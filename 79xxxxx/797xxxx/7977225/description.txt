In Dublin, Nate Grey and Madelyne Pryor confront Nemesis, ApocalypseΓÇÖs heir from the Age of Apocalypse reality who has been committing a series of horrible murders around the city in the past few days, feeding off humansΓÇÖ organic properties in order to sustain his shapeshifting armor. Nemesis initially taunts Nate by wearing NateΓÇÖs face before he reveals his true colors. Before the fight can progress much, though, Maddie teleports Nate and herself far from the battlefield, arguing itΓÇÖs not NateΓÇÖs business to confront Nemesis. Nate convinces her to return them to the battlefield, only he now comes back suited up in a powerful psionic armor. During the encounter, NemesisΓÇÖ own armor implodes and he flees. Nemesis pledges revenge and decides to meet up with Dark Beast in New York. However, despite NemesisΓÇÖs departure, the murders continue in Dublin, making it again likely that Nate may be somehow linked with them. Meanwhile, both Ness and the Gauntlet agents are still trying to track down Nate. A mysterious person, however, tips off Gauntlet agent Vise on NateΓÇÖs current whereabouts.
