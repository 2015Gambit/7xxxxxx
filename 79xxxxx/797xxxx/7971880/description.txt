Book Description
================
The sensual and provocative second volume in the "Cairo Trilogy", "Palace 
Of Desire" follows the Al Jawad family into the awakening world of the 
1920's and the sometimes violent clash between Islamic ideals, personal 
dreams and modern realities. Having given up his vices after his son's 
death, ageing patriarch Al-Sayyid Ahmad pursues an arousing lute-player 
- only to find she has married his eldest son. His rebellious children 
struggle to move beyond his domination as they test the loosening reins 
of societal and parental control. And Ahmad's youngest son, in an unforgettable 
portrayal of unrequited love, ardently courts the sophisticated daughter 
of a rich Europeanised family.
