Gary Lineker introduces highlights of the first seven Premier League fixtures of 2013 on a busy day of New Year action.

Manchester United make the short trip across Lancashire to take on Wigan. The Latics finally ended their 13-game all-time winless league run against Sir Alex Ferguson's men in the 2011 season at the DW Stadium with a famous first-ever victory.

Manchester City host Stoke City, a side they have beaten on all four previous Premier League meetings at the Etihad Stadium without the visitors so much as scoring a goal.

West Ham host Norwich at Upton Park, with recent meetings tending to be close: six of the last seven league encounters between the sides had ended level.

Reading travel to Tottenham for the first time since an enthralling 6-4 defeat in December 2007.
