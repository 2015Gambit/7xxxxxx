Friendship or love, which is more valuable? The age old debate on ΓÇÿnatpuΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿkadhalΓÇÖ comes to the fore once again in VaseegaranΓÇÖs Manjal Veyil. Love and friendship are two subjects that can never lose freshness or appeal, so the maker has not run a big risk by taking on a subject that has been tried many times before. The director had claimed that originality would be the USP of Manjal Veyil. The question is whether he has lived up to his word.
