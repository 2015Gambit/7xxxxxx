,crwildman,2013-01-05T04:46Z,"hey guys.. Just to let you all know this program says for Windows, but it works PERFECT running on my linux box as well.  Just install under Wine...  The only thing that seems to not work is the ""Preview"" window, but u don't need that anyways.. Just open it in VLC to preview it yourself.   Everything else works perfect on both linux and windows.  Thanks, I got both my machines converting tons of files....  :)"
,crwildman,2013-01-09T23:05Z,"Mine stopped working today.

No idea why.  I tried uninstall, reinstall.  Same way i got working before.  Now it isn't working for me.

Any ideas?   Anyone else have this problem?"
