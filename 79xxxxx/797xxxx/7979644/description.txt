Book Description
================
This is a sweeping and evocative portrait of both a family and a country 
struggling to move toward independence in a society that has resisted 
change for centuries. Set against the backdrop of Britain's occupation 
of Egypt immediately after World War I, Palace Walk introduces us to 
the Al Jawad family. Ahmad, a middle-class shopkeeper runs his household 
strictly according to the Qur'an while at night he explores the pleasures 
of Cairo. A tyrant at home, Ahmad forces his gentle, oppressed wife 
and two daughters to live cloistered lives behind the house's latticed 
windows, while his three very different sons live in fear of his harsh 
will.
