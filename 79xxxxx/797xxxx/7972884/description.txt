Lord of the Rings is more or less the foundation of modern D&D. The latter rose from the former, although the two are now so estranged that to reunite them would be an act of savage madness. Imagine a gaggle of modern hack-n-slash roleplayers who had somehow never been exposed to the original Tolkien mythos, and then imagine taking those players and trying to introduce them to Tolkien via a D&D campaign.
ΓÇö The Blurb for the first strip

According to this comic, The Lord of the Rings wouldn't make a good Dungeons & Dragons campaign.

Think about it. Loads of Backstory, few battles, limited treasure (even if you aren't expecting a Monty Haul campaign), and lots and lots of talking (since many events are told to others after the fact).

To a player whose rules are Play The Game Skip The Story and RPGs Equal Combat, this would make for a frustrating game. But it makes a great comic.

PS: Sorry for the previous release, it had a mistake in it, so I deleted it.

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).
Then, you can use ".cbr files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!
