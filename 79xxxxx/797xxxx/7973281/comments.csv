,kispaci,2012-12-31T18:30Z,"One little problem with the patch (in the next release will be resolved)

Problem:
""When I run the patch it says c:vidapatchfilldb.cmd missing.""


Solution:
When you start the patch then write this to the path:

C:backslash   (backslash is a symbol, just Piratebay remove)"
