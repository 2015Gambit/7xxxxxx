To the complete novice, learning about philosophy can be a cause for dread. The Philosophy Book uses innovative graphics and creative typography to help demystify hard-to-grasp concepts for those new to philosophy, cutting through the haze of misunderstanding, untangling knotty theories, and shedding light on abstract concepts. Aimed at anyone with a general interest in how our social, political, and ethical ideas are formed, as well as students of philosophy and politics, The Philosophy Book breathes new life to a subject that is often regarded as esoteric and academic.

About the Author
Will Buckingham is a writer and philosopher based in Leicester currently senior lecturer in the School of Humanities at De Montfort University. He writes mainly fiction, philosophy and for children
He has a degree in Fine Arts from the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (1994), a Masters degree in anthropology from Durham (1997) and a PhD in philosophy from Staffordshire University (2007). He started writing fiction seriously he was in the Tanimbar islands in Indonesia, where he was undertaking research into indigenous traditions and economies of art. The Tanimbar islands were rich in stories; and so, one rainy afternoon, he sat in front of a battered old manual typewriter, and started to write stories of his own.
His PhD in philosophy, which explored amongst other things ethics, storytelling and the curious ways of obscure Indonesian gods, was completed in 2007. His first novel, which drew heavily on my experience in Indonesia, was published by Tindal Street Press. Since then, he has published two philosophy books (with one more forthcoming), as well as a second novel and a children's picture book.
