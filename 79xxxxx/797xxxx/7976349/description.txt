Four young office workers have a bet going to see who can last the longest
without going outside. In the maze that is the downtown core of a large city,
glass skywalks connect apartment buildings, office towers and shopping malls.
Its day 28 of the bet and over the lunch hour, as the office prepares for the
company founder's retirement party, things start to seriously unravel.
