I personally own and have ripped and encoded each and every of these albums. Staind happens to be my favorite band and I have taken the time to make sure each and every one of these albums is complete. :) Enjoy! This torrent is Studio albums only. I did not rerip MP3s or anything like that. These came directly from my CDs so there aren't any leaks or anything and a few bonus tracks may not be here. Sorry but I did not want to trade quality for quantity. Anyways, enjoy these amazing CDs!
