Match of the Day Two 30.12.2012

Colin Murray introduces highlights of the final two Premier League fixtures of 2012, with expert analysis from Alan Shearer and Pat Nevin.

Everton take on Chelsea at Goodison Park, a ground the west London club have struggled at in previous seasons. The Toffees are unbeaten in their last four home encounters against Chelsea, winning the last three. Chelsea's last victory at Goodison came courtesy of a Michael Essien match-winning goal during the 2007/08 campaign.

Queens Park Rangers host Liverpool at Loftus Road in the other game, with the 2011 season's 3-2 triumph for the Rs still fresh in the memory. The visitors led 2-0 with only 13 minutes of the game to go, only for Shaun Derry, Djibril Cisse and Jamie Mackie to turn the game on its head and kick-start what ultimately proved to be QPR's successful Premier League survival campaign.

There is also another chance to see all of the goals from Saturday's games.
