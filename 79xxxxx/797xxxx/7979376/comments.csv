,taispagan,2013-01-07T10:59Z,"@mr1991 No need to discuss with @xsadx... He just want to make himself a polemic person and call attention. 
It is quite obvious for anyone with the minimum Knowledge that Hindi Cinema is a great one. 
It is the only film industry that can compete with Hollywood, It was the most watched films in the URSS , in Middle east, and Egypt. And it doesn't even need all the marketing to reach to people. 
Bollywood films have walked away with several major prizes at prestigious film festivals worldwide over the years. Beginning all the way back in 1937, films from India have captured the attention of international juries. The Cannes Film Festival, without question the most influential and important of all the world's festivals, will pay a homage to India's film Industry in 2013.
Of course Japan has great films, and so does India, and so does USA. They are all different cultures and will bring great joy and information if you keep a open mind and let yourself go out of prejudices and arrogance.
I'm not from India or USA. I'm from Brazil, couldn't be farther apart from either of countries. It is not a political issue, it's art. And India is one of the world's largest leader when it comes to art and spirituality.
The whole world knows it. Only a very small minded person can say it different. @xsadx probably doesn't even know Japan film industry. Just think he will look smarter if he talks about it."
