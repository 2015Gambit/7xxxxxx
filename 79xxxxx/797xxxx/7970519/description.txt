A dramatic documentary biopic in which the drug addicted filmmaker tries a radical and frightening method of detox. He undergoes "IBOGAINE" treatment for his addiction, a rather unorthadoxed method with unusual attributes.


STORYLINE:

An in-depth portrait of a small-time drug addict seeking redemption. Addicted to opiates for almost 20 years, film-maker David Graham Scott decides to opt for a quick fix. The radical detox agent ibogaine puts the user into a gut-wrenching hallucinatory state for 36 hours, from which he emerges cleansed of his addiction. But several fatalities have been reported in connection with the unlicensed drug, and Scott must weigh up the options before embarking on the trip of a lifetime.

Enjoy!!
