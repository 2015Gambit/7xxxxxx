Hey there! Have a lot of Spidey comics? Not sure what order to read them in or what issues you may be missing? Wanna read all them bad boys in Chronological Order to cut out the confusion of multiple running comic lines?

Well look no further! Two handy lists assembled on the comicbackissues site of both the proper reading order of the Core Titles of Spider-Man, as well as the essential NON-Spidey issues you'll need to wrap up certain story lines, all in a handy PDF format.

Enjoy, fellow comic enthusiasts. I know I don't have to remind you to BUY your comics, we're ALL honest here after all. ;)
