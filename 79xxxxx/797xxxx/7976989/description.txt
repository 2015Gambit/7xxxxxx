Touching from a Distance is a biography written by Deborah Curtis. It details her life and marriage with Ian Curtis, lead singer of the 1970s British post-punk rock band Joy Division. In the book, Deborah Curtis speaks of Ian's infidelity, their troubled marriage, Ian's volatile and sometimes troubled personality, and of his health problems (which included epileptic seizures) that likely led to his suicide in 1980, on the eve of Joy Division's first U.S. tour.

The book has been used as a reference for the film Control, for which Deborah Curtis was a co-producer. The role of Deborah was played by Samantha Morton.
