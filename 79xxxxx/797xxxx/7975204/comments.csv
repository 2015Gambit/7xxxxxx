,tempius,2013-01-02T20:30Z,Yes for MAC as well but i think you have to convert to .dmg

,derspanier,2013-01-03T09:12Z,nevermind my bad
,ganec,2013-01-03T21:23Z,Thank you !!!
,valcam,2013-01-04T09:22Z,THAAAAAKKKsSS a lot
,valcam,2013-01-04T09:35Z,This comes with net render?
,picard111,2013-01-05T00:36Z,"spanier insert the right key for studio

@ valcam yes"
,sgroup2,2013-01-08T02:27Z,"Works perfectly, follow instructions in description. Use Serial for Studio version if you want everything. If you're worried about the keygen, run it in Sandboxie. Seeded 12GB, I'll seed for a bit more due to the awesomeness of this torrent :)"
,beachgoth,2013-01-10T20:51Z,"Installation and KeyGen process went great. However, program consistently crashes for me.

Running Windows 7 64 bit, i7 Quad at 2.30GHz, 12 gigs ram, NVIDIA gtx 670 3gb.

Should be running correctly. Anyone else also experience program crashes?"
