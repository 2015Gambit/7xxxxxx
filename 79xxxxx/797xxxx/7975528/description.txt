5.30.1977
The fourth and last night at this venue, this show is one of the best from 1977! Jimmy's playing is amazing, especially in In My Time Of Dying, No Quarter, Achilles Last Stand, and his awesome Stairway To Heaven solo. Ten Years Gone is simply beautiful and epic in scope. Sick Again starts sloppily but after that, this show develops into one of the best from the tour, with each member firing on all cylinders.
