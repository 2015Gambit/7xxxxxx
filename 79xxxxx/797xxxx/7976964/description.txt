[CODE]Pandian (Vishnu) considers him unlucky. All his efforts to come up
 in life end on wrong side.
He approaches contract killer AKP (Amarendran) and urges to kill him.
A shocked AKP is initially hesitant. Soon he decides to give him some time. 
Hence he gives Pandian some money and entrusts him with a job of turning 
a human bomb, a job that 
he should execute within 20 days.
But life changes for Pandian after he meets Vaishnavi (Piaa). They fall in love
with each other. When Pandian decides to go tell AKP that he would 
rather prefer to live, he gets a rude shock. 
AKP and his men are found murdered. Now the blame falls on Pandian. 
Meanwhile, Vaishnavi gets kidnapped by a gang for a big deal. 
ItΓÇÖs chaos and confusion everywhere, before Pandian sets things right.[/CODE][B]
