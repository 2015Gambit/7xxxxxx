[T],GaryBradbury2012,2013-01-01T18:23Z,"Happy New Year to you too and all!!
Here's to another year of Pirate Bay Happiness!!!!
I didn't want the Mayans to be right (or our wrong interpretation of their calendar!!).
I was kinda looking forward to seeing Jesus returning with a sword!! (as in ""Matthew 10:34). 
Now that's a movie I gotta see!!!!"
,nachoholic,2013-01-02T07:58Z,"Gaz, I created a username just to thank you for all the wonderful British torrents that you posted on TPB in 2012.  Last semester I had to work full-time while studying for a graduate degree and looking forward to new MiCs, TOWIEs, and others is what got me through most days (haha is that sad? If so, pretend I never said that). But truly - you provide an awesome service to the world, thanks for brightening all of our days!!  You're a legend!  I have a lot of UK friends from teaching English in Asia, and if I ever make it there (fingers crossed!), you can expect MULTIPLE pints of beer on me!"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2013-01-02T08:31Z,"Cheers mate :)
That is very nice of you. I am glad I can take those studying blues away with some of your favourite shows. I hope I keep getting lucky and post TOWIE, MiC and all the other UK shows people can't find for the whole of 2013 :)
PS- When we do catch up for a beer, we won't watch any sports. You guys are kickin our arses in that department at the moment!!!"
