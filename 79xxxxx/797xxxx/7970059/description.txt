
Movie to GIF Converter is a powerful tool to convert video file to animated GIF file and enables you to add over 50 effects (Add Text, Add Image, Adjust Brightness, Adjust RGB, Adjust Contrast, etc.) to the GIF file. It provides a built-in player that allows you to select the section as you view the clip. You can use this software to convert selected part or convert a single video file. It comes with fast speed and supports a lot of popular movie formats, such as AVI, MPEG1, MPEG2 (NTSC/PAL options for DVD, VCD, SVCD), WMV, ASF and Quick Time formats. The interface is very user-friendly and easy-to-use.
