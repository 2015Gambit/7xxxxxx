Also the album art for Big Sean - Dance is... edited. Like someone literally took their face and pasted it over Big Sean's face in MS Paint."
,SixWingedFreak,2013-01-05T23:22Z,I take that back. ALL the album art is fucked up.
,SixWingedFreak,2013-01-05T23:23Z,"""David Guetta - Turn Me On"" is also distorted.

I would pass on this torrent."
,SixWingedFreak,2013-01-05T23:35Z,The .m3u and .pls files included don't work either.
