I had the pleasure of hearing, seeing, and meeting Sabaton live here in the States. They rock pretty damn hard--hard enough that I dropped the coin on a few of their albums at the merch table after the show.

From Wikipedia:
Sabaton is a Grammis-nominated power metal band from Falun, Sweden formed in 1999. The band's main lyrical themes are those of historical wars. This is heard in albums Primo Victoria, Attero Dominatus and Coat of Arms where all of the songs, except final tracks, take inspiration from historical battles or war. Lyrical content drawn from World War I, World War II and other conflicts is prevalent and includes songs about battles and leaders on all sides of said conflicts.

This torrent contains the Re-armed edition of their 2005 album, Primo Victoria.

Enjoy. \m/
