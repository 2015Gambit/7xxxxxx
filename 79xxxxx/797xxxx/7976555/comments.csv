I have already compressed Physics and Our Universe which is composed of 60 lectures with each file at 100mb.
I haven't uploaded it because someone has already done us some time back though his quality is not as good as mine (which is the reason why I decided to recompress it all over).
Here is a sample : http://bayimg.com/gAIGAaAEc"

waiting for your compressed version of "" Physics and our universe """
