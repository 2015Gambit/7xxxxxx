The creative process is one of the most rewarding aspects of being a musician. Whether or not one aspires to be a songwriter, musicianship can only be enhanced by understanding the music that we play from the inside. However, becoming a songwriter or improving your songwriting is an unparalleled artistic achievement for the musically inclined. It is a journey into your soul; an expression of your being.
