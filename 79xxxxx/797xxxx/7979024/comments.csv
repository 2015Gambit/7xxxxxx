[V],psspss,2013-01-02T07:28Z,"dude read a*E website you can see the numbering is correct for fooksake

also whats the fook wrong with TPB it wont allow to upload now.. timing out like shit

DOS attack or programmer fooking it up at key times again"

[V],psspss,2013-01-02T09:31Z,"
I renamed the new Hardcore pawn to this
since afgs didnt add a title

Hardcore.Pawn.Chicago.S01E01.HDTV.XviD-][ Something's Missing ][ 02-Jan-2013 ]"
,q2323,2013-01-02T14:46Z,thank you
,cholio7,2013-01-03T00:39Z,"I agree with cradle, there are mislabeled as always. Check epguides.com S02E30 was titled Fast Times At Texas High and aired on Jan 1st. S02E31 also aired on Jan 1st and has the right title. "
[V],psspss,2013-01-03T05:30Z,"3rd party sides for guides and titles is stupid

I use the main production site who made the bloody show

wake up guys.. Ive already said in the header

they could be E31-32 cos 2 episode were missed
by looks over xmass.. either they didnt air or
cappers missed them dont know..
but they listed on a&es episode listing

fast times has already aired and was episodes back"

[V],psspss,2013-01-03T06:05Z,"you will notice the 2 missing episodes and titles
they have the wrong air dates on them.. whom
ever does the production site listings messed up
maybe cos it forgot it was 2 episodes each week not one and of course being xmas period

so looks like Fast Times at Texas High
didnt air or was missed on Dec 18-19 2012
the jan 1 is wrong obviously else we would had 3 episodes capped yesterday"
[V],psspss,2013-01-03T06:17Z,"right im done with it..

as long as the titles match the episodes and
its season 2 not season 3

its good enough for me.. 

episodes are always messed up
you rename one way and next season find out it
was really a different season numbering cos
they decide to add 12 episodes ot the previous
sons of guns was like that"
,thejinxster,2013-01-03T07:23Z,Can you get oddities as there seems to be a big gap and many missing from the P.B....thanks
[V],psspss,2013-01-03T09:59Z,"look I have no data any more it runs out fast

I got to stretch 13gb in 17 days now for the
whole household to use

so I cant help.. unless I find a torrent already up else where and add here to TPB"
[V],psspss,2013-01-03T10:06Z,"which ones are missing? san fran ones?
dont think its as popular why its missed capping

as I think all the oddities up to season 3 e23

have been added and prev 2 seasons 

also remember not in USA I just googling about and what not to find stuff if its out there and exists other then that no one capped it"
[V],psspss,2013-01-03T10:12Z,"seems only 6 ep for san fran on tvrage

so it was a pilot season"
,MorphzreaZ,2013-01-03T18:23Z,"wow a new year..with even more whiners...... @craddle why dont u fuck off from TPB.If u can only bitch like a little girl about the wrong episode numbers... my god such children..... fuck m psspss...some ppl still thank you for all your uploads,an happy new year to you  !!!"
