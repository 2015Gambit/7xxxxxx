Best Service - Titan - Virtual Instrument

The biggest and most extensive Synthesizer Sound Collection of all time!

The development and the sampling of this library was 10 years in the making.
TITAN offers 5500 multisamples of the best sounds from 200 (!!) classic Analog Synthesizers and Modular Systems including the biggest & most famous Digital Synths & Workstations of the 80s and 90s but also the newest Virtual Instruments and current synths all in one massive plug-in.

That means 40 years of Synth-history and sound variety, the biggest sound and Style collection ever. We put a great emphasis on preserving the unique sound charachter of each instrument. ThatΓÇÖs why the instruments were partially sampled with their original effects and filters because they can hardly be reproduced in the virtual domain.
All instruments were sampled and looped perfectly and inserted into the best service ENGINE.
