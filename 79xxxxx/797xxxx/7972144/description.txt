In 1948 "Technical Analysis of Stock Trends" was the first book to produce a methodology for interpreting the predictable behavior of investors and markets. It revolutionized technical investment approaches and showed traders and investors how to make money regardless of what the market is doing. Now in its ninth edition, the book remains the benchmark by which all other investment methodologies are measured.

Considered by some to be the bible of technical analysis.
