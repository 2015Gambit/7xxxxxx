Singstar: Queen is packed with the classic songs that made Queen one of the world's favorite bands -- a group so popular that they sold more than 300 million albums and had a worldwide hit musical created in their honor: 'We Will Rock You'. Bohemian Rhapsody and We Are the Champions are there -- as are Another One Bites the Dust and Don't Stop Me Now. Whichever track is your favorite, you'll be lining up to grab the mic and step into the trainers of the legendary Freddie Mercury to raise your living room roof. With stellar tracks from the '70s, '80s and '90s, SingStar Queen will rock SingStars who like to go solo, SingStars who like to duet and, quite possibly, the neighbors next door when they hear your performances coming through the wall!
