Happy New Year to ALL....First on Net...DOE Simplified...


DOE Simplified - Practical Tools for Effective Experimentation, Second Edition...
by Mark J. Anderson and Patrick J. Whitcomb.



Offering a planned approach for determining cause and effect, this work provides researchers with the statistical means to analyze how numerous variables interact. With this second edition of DOE Simplified, Mark Anderson and Patrick Whitcomb retain their lively approach to the learning of fundamentals. They lighten up the inherently dry complexities with interesting sidebars and amusing anecdotes. In this edition, they add new and updated information, including a four-step planning process for designing and executing experiments with a consideration of statistical power.

Design of Experiments (DOE) is a planned approach for determining cause and effect relationships that can be applied to any process with measurable inputs and outputs.  DOE provides a statistical means for analyzing how numerous variables interact.

In DOE SimplifiedΓÇöa comprehensive introductory text geared towards readers with minimal statistical backgroundΓÇöthe authors take a fresh and lively approach to learning the fundamentals. The book covers:

    Basic statistics for DOE
    Methods for collecting and displaying data
    How to draw inferences from data
    The purpose of confidence intervals
    Comparative experiments for testing hypotheses
    Blocking sources of variation from analysis
    Two-level factorial designs
    Fractional factorials
    Minimum-run designs
    Analysis of variance.
