 The handlers of animals featured in the long-running drama offer an insight into how 
 some of the series' most difficult stunts were achieved, such as a chase scene across 
 a river involving a lion. Featuring previously unseen footage and a look at how 
 real-life emergencies are dealt with in the unpredictable world of filming with 
 animals. Narrated by Stephen Tompkinson
                           
                                 Enjoy!
