,and_cac,2013-01-02T14:50Z,Loader not Crack
[V],DeGun,2013-01-02T21:40Z,"and_cac: 

Thank you for letting me know I appreciate your concern but yuh might understand - might - that some people, many of em in fact - search through TPB or internet for a windows 7 crack or patch or activation as - even if hard to believe - many of em dont know the term LOADER or even DAZ so yes I bloody know it is a loader but I try to make people's life easier when searching by adding CRACK or ACTIVATION to the terms LOADER by DAZ ... and trust me IT MAKES a difference.

You could have - could have - guessed by urself I already knew this nah ?

NVM :) have a good year 2013 .

BONNE ANNEE LE PEUPLE JAH BLESSED LOVE .

,vze2mp9g,2013-01-03T05:28Z,"@6zwbob Here is a good link for the most recent and updated Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7923270/Windows_7_Ultimate_SP1_x64_en-US_Dec14_2012  This uploader is murphy78 - this member is a highly rated and trusted uploader. Just install Win7SP1x64 and use this file by DeGun, and you should be set to go. Any questions or concerns go to TPB support form at  https://forum.suprbay.org/index.php . I hope this helps. Happy New Years to TPB! ! !"
,blyss4226,2013-01-03T22:57Z,Props. I have THREE count them THREE legit Windows 7 Home Premium codes and two install discs. Unfortunately apparently one of them is for 64 bit only and the other two a couple of letters are scratched off. I.E. I'm proving the point that DRM and such BS only stops people from doing legit things. Anyone who wants just takes. Get a clue big ass companies!
[V],neon,2013-01-04T12:28Z,Happy new year DeGun :)
,JakesterX,2013-01-08T08:14Z,Says works with VMWare but No hints in the Read Me about using it with VMWare on a Mac Windows install at all. Any specific procedure to follow???
,fatherhud,2013-01-09T00:20Z,"Ok so this may sound like a stupid question but could i get a quick step by step guide to using this loader? Do i install windows and then run this program? i know very little about computers or installing OS's. I'm planning on burning one of these torrents to a dvd:

or

Which should i use?"
,Gnutt1234,2013-01-09T13:43Z,Thx DeGun for making the description noob friendly so i can find it :) 
,JakesterX,2013-01-10T08:13Z,"Can I please get an educated answer as to whether or not this is worthless to me for a Win7 install on a Mac using VMWare Fusion? There is NO Windows environment prior to the install so, unless the Fusion app can work with the loader .EXE file I don't see how. The  list of features at the top says it works with VMWare. VMWare WHAT? Workstation only? I don't have that. Just a MBP, Fusion installed and two different Windows 7 Iso flles hoping I can get one installed with a working key."
