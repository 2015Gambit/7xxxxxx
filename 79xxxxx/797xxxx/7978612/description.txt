Notes: first of missing 2 minutes at the very start!! Cropped borders, rotated,
Then resized aliitle as resolution was so small after the cropping, think
i have the AR right hard to tell with these rips, appends a smoother on
the video to help with the resizing and added some sharpens after that...
tweaked other thigns to like levels, colours, contrast... Theres a couple
of watermarks that appear but most of the time not that noticeable. Audio
well its good clear but abit hollow. Anyway check sample and enjoy :-)
