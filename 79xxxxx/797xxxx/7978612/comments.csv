,Iwatcheverything,2013-01-02T16:56Z,Guess JC said this is his final movie ever in an interview. He's been working on getting it made for years. 
,Congeal,2013-01-03T02:19Z,"@Iwatcheverything, Errr... no. He only said its his last major action film. Jackie is still going to do action movies, although smaller/less stunts or stunt doubles/special effects, and movies in general.
In fact, there's already talk about him joining the next Expendables and doing another movie with Chris Tucker."

V = 3
M = ??? "
,Pseudoplaydo,2013-01-05T03:59Z,just from looking at the screens provided you can tell its better than a 3 for video... some people just rate things shitty.
