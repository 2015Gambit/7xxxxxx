Tuxera NTFS only solution!"
,ClubQBall,2012-12-30T13:20Z,"@bjornagainswede - Um, did the uploader state that this was for Lion or Mountain Lion?  No, he didn't.  There ARE other Mac users out there that have earlier O.S. versions, asshole ... me included.

So, um, shut the fuck up and move along, you arrogant fuck.  If it doesn't apply to you or what you have, why even bother commenting, asshole?"
,ClubQBall,2012-12-30T13:22Z,"'Sides ... Paragon and Tuxera are about evenly matched.  I have both.  Next time?  Next time be a little bit more appreciative of someone's efforts.

God, I fucking hate ungrateful, know-it-all motherfuckers."

,ClubQBall,2012-12-30T23:23Z,"@Cachorro - FUCK YOU.  Got something else to say, motherfucker?  I wasn't even speaking to or addressing you in the first fucking place, so mind your own goddamned business, dickless."
,Cachorro,2012-12-31T13:10Z,"@ClubQball:
You are in need of acute help. Please send me your address and I will send you a truckload with toilet papers so you can clean your mouth.
People near you when you speak, need to hold an umbrella  to protect themselves. Go talk to the toilet bowl."
,ClubQBall,2013-01-01T01:10Z,"@Cachorro - Apparently, it bears repeating:

FUCK YOU. I wasn't even speaking to or addressing you in the first fucking place, so mind your own goddamned business, you fucking ignorant sack of shit.

Go fuck yourself, sweetheart."

thanks for the heads up. what you wrote DID contribute to this torrent. fyi, letting people know it won't (or will, for that matter) work with a specific update is neither arrogant not ungrateful. "
