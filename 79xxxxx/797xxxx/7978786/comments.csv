looks like thats the mix up
I've renamed files so that they show in proper order for the complete season (only way i could get them to run in order)(If and when I can?)

QI.Xmas Show S10E14.Jingle Bells.Avi
VG Pt1(Beast Of)S10E15.Avi"
[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-04T08:53Z,"Well, the confusion does not seem to be over.
Wiki says that S10E16 is compilation 2, except they say it won't air until the 4th.
But it's different than S10E15 and I suspect only two, so I'm going with:

QI.S10E16.VG.(Best.Of).Part.2

Really curious if ""Jolly"" airs on the 4th or 11th
