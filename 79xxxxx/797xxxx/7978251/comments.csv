,dooleynoted,2013-01-02T05:05Z,Huh?  WTF is this?  82GB in a RAR with a BS description?  What moron would download this obvious scam?
,shadowfoxs,2013-01-02T16:17Z,This is the 108 hour course there is a lot of information. This cover pistols rifles and shotguns please feel e mail me any questions.
,dooleynoted,2013-01-03T06:30Z,"If it's legit, then please restructure the torrent so the files aren't hidden in a compressed form and so one can glom individual files, folders or at minimum inidividual discs.  Video isn't further compressed by putting it into RAR and doing so just makes it inconvenient and suspicious. "
,dooleynoted,2013-01-03T06:44Z,"This is how to post such a humongous torrent.

,torrmaker,2013-01-08T16:59Z,"Thanks, shadowfoxs. As Biden said, ""This is a big F!@#ing deal"". Much appreciation for uploading it. While dooleynoted is correct about rar files users really do need to download the whole thing as it is a course, not a collection of unrelated topics like the karm123 upload. Per my comments, I would still like it if you could upload the missing VOB files from the Bob Dunlap DVDs in a separate torrent. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7832592/"
,torrmaker,2013-01-11T04:30Z,We need some people to seed this torrent. My download shows five other users all stuck at 17% and I haven't seen anyone over 18% in the past few days. I'll keep seeing but I need to get to 100% before I can do much good.
,dunn6902,2013-01-11T06:46Z,"Same here.I show everyone at 17% and it hasn't moved all day.I've never downloaded a file this big,how long should it take?Thanks for uploading this."
