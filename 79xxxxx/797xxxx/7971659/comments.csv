,pwnt_soup,2012-12-30T15:44Z,"why is it that my browser blocks a popup when I download some of your stuff here? I dont know if its you or TPB thats linking a popup to the magnet link, do you have any idea? btw thanks for all the kewl stuff you post here. I'm not banging on you just wondering if you knew whats up thats all. Thanks again!"
[V],psspss,2012-12-30T23:30Z,"lol I have nothing to do with the site

but they do make money from the ads and donations

i use firewfox and install ad blocker plus

works a charm.. however i think its now banned from add-ons search feature as i didnt find it last time I looked for a friends pc and only found a crap version with a similar name I guess have to download from their site now so google it"
,pwnt_soup,2012-12-31T01:06Z,"no problem bro, I just wanted to ask. it seems TPB likes your ups for popup I guess. I run addblock+ myself so i dont get the popups just the quick flash as it tries, tuneup utilities will instal it for you if you use that app. thanks for the reply. any idea if/when the gun shows will start again? "
[V],psspss,2012-12-31T02:41Z,"you also need block flash or use dont auto play flash

but then I dont use magnet links

instead cut out the word torrent/ in the url
and replace the / on end and paste it on front
and you can download torrent file like the old days :)
but it wont have torrent on end.. but utorrent
go show all files and load it just the same"
[V],psspss,2012-12-31T12:19Z,so change torrent to torrents and past on front I meant.. I missed out the replace / with S
,pwnt_soup,2013-01-03T23:30Z,thanks for the tip brother!
