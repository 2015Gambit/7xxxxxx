,UncleO,2013-01-07T04:17Z,"Man Eaters?  Wow!  Didn't I read that when a kid (almost?).  73 now.

Far out!

This seems to be a hope-request doomed to always fail:  How about some AA Fair (Erle Stanley Gardner)?  No meticulous time tables in the plotting, I'm sure (you've seen the book on how the Masons were written?) but more full of life, with Donald Lam, Bertha Cool, and sec'y Elsie Brand? Written after Mason had already filled the charts for years. Must have been good for me to remember all these years. Apparently there were dozens more than I had seen back then.

Innyhoo, thanks for the Eaters and some more of these."
