,1ricca,2013-01-02T06:31Z,"Frame rate is totally f'd. Especially since this movie was filmed at 48fps and then converted to 24 (23.97) fps for mosty mediums, including this dvd. So now we are watching a really screwed up dropped-frame conversion that has been converted with a bad pull down from 24 to 30fps. Got a headache from the first 30 seconds. Too bad, this is a great early release and IQ is excellent. "

,1ricca,2013-01-02T09:06Z,"@scene  could you please re-export from your original project file as a proper 23.97fps file? It shouldn't take much at all to do this and it would make this from a 2/10 to a 9/10. If you ever need consulting on encodes and advanced settings, as well as good recovery and quality retaining techniques, hit me up"
,1ricca,2013-01-02T09:12Z,"@mpenn20 the fps issue is likely the uploader's fault. It seems very unlikely that they were provided with a 30fps non-standard format DVD or file and even if it they were, they could have done a decent conversion back to 23.97 using the NLE they used for all the blurs and such. Of all movies to screw up frame rate, this is literally the worst possible one in history due to its novel original frame rate. "
,.Leto.,2013-01-02T09:23Z,"Like it has already been said there's a serious framerate problem, picture is jerky during the whole movie. Still very watchable though, and it's by far the best version available at the moment. Sound quality is excellent. Thanks."
,1ricca,2013-01-02T09:29Z,"So I saw somewhere else that the fps is like this:

Frame rate : 29.534 fps
Original frame rate : 29.547 fps

You should either be keeping the fps identical to the source or doing a hq conversion to 23.97 using compressor's frame reordering or something similarly advanced. If you were going to slightly alter this, it should have been ouput as 29.97fps. "

,bigchiefindian,2013-01-03T00:36Z,"This is probably the best copy of this movie available and the uploader did an immense amount of work to make this available to many.  This torrent is listed through many trackers.  What is unfortunate and disgusting is that there are so many seeds but very few are sharing as they are undoubtedly scared of receiving a letter from their ISP indicating that the copyright owner has complained and they were tracked sharing this file.  What is more unfortunate to me is that these retards don't know how to use a proxy or more securely, a VPN as not to get put on the radar.  What the people that are not sharing don't obviously realize is that they are damaging the torrent out of their greed.  Imagine that the tracker (ie. The Pirate Bay) is a table that all the users are sitting at.  Each user wants the whole book and is given a small portion of that book of which he or she needs to share at least 100% of, which is indicated by a ratio of 1.0.  When 100% of that portion is not shared, patterns develop over time and the torrent is damaged.  This is pure GREED! and IDIOCY!  You ruin it for those of us who understand the technology and know what we are doing.

Just because you were told about Utorrent or some other client that you are using, does not give you the right alone to have access to these files.  Start sharing you goddamned idiots; 100% of what you have taken.  Luckily for you greedy pricks, I don't have the time to start capturing ip addresses and shutting those who don't share down by blocking you through the many methods that you could be shut out of this gift.  Quit being so fucking lazy that you can't google the technology and learn about what you are doing.

Thank you very much for your immense work uploader.  Know that those of us who share appropriately, truly appreciate you.

Those of you capping your download and not sharing what you took can scrub my crotch and go to hell!!!!!"

Trust me. If you want to see a part three worthy of your taste then spend the money and support the film makers. I did."

2) To any chuckle-head telling people to be good chaps and go pay to see the artist's special work in splendid big-screen detail:  Way to spread the ""gospel"" in the ghetto.  How about you buy a carton of smokes for a homeless guy if you want to be a saint.

Best quality early release i've seen in forever.

@bigchiefindian

Torrents don't get damage from seeding less than 1.0 ratio. ALOT of people don't have the capacity to upload a 1.0 ratio. I have a max upload of 40kb/s and a max download of 1.6mb/s. This is a difference of 40x or a ratio of 0.025 : 1. Meaning i would need to seed 40x longer than it takes to download at a minimum to get a 1:1 ratio (so if i download for 2 hours, i have to upload for 80 hours at max speed to reach 1:1). I seed for as  long as i can before moving onto the next torrent, and prioritize my seeding by quality of content and health of tracker. Dropping ""proxy"" and ""VPN"" in your spiel give no validity to your claim, as these aren't 100% anonymity assured. "

The 3D makes it feel like you are looking at the characters behind a window. It's not like any other 3D movie. The movie is awesome as well. 10/10. It's not just the hobbit. Peter Jackson expanded the movie by 100% by incorporating side stories and flashbacks from Silmarillion. You will see awesome scenes, monsters and action scenes.

,Aoishiro,2013-01-03T10:47Z,"Copy Pasted from torrentfreak. Things i wrote sometime ago.

I've wrote an extensive paper on the topic of intellectual and copyright law in college, and describing how archaic the law is and must be renewed since the arrival of 'Internet'. There's still a lot of people out there that saying sharing intellectual property equal stealing. Well you cannot steal something that requires almost no effort to make.

There's three circle, inner, middle, and outer. The first circle consist of people who appreciate the product, understand that it require resources to keep producing. they kept the artist, programmer etc alive. Then there's the middle one, consist mostly of us, people who can't afford to buy the product for various reason, location wise, money wise, etc. The outer circle consist of people who just don't care, billions of human falls into this category.

See, the MPAA or whatever just want to close the product to middle circle. Internet through piratebay and it's peers had provides intellectual property for almost every human being that interested for free. They hope that when they closed the middle circle, every single human being that's in there would go into the inner circle and made them richer. Well that's not going to happen. If there's no more torrent sites and no more file sharing, and internet is dead, then people like me would just lose all of those 'happiness', Only few thousand straggler will integrated into the inner circle, made them teeny bitsy more money than now. That's just pure greed. They would sacrifice happiness of millions for a little bit of money.

Intelligence product means shit literally shit for the survival of human being. For millions of years people evolved without even books or entertainment or anything. We need food, clothes, and a place to stay (space), that's all. When you steal gas (energy), steal food, you deserved to get shot. Every 
single one of food, beans, rice, takes effort to produce, not like intelligence product now don't they. Because of the wonders of human being they can be duplicated and reproduced without effort whatsoever. If one day we can reproduces oil, or beans, or rice without effort because of technology,
then there's happiness for everybody won't they? it's not stealing anymore when you copy/duplicate your neighbours oil, cause they require no effort, no basic production cost to reproduce.

With the arrival of internet, as a medium to reproduce intellectual property with no effort whatsoever, meaning there's unlimited ammount of supply, there's just a lot of people who want to stop that, they want to owned the internet. Control the supply keep the demand high and make shitload of money for something worthless. As an honest worker who sweat days after days working, to pay obscene of money for a 'product' that had almost no reproduction cost is stupid.

But actually it's not stupid isn't it? we had arrived at that time now, where almost all of intellectual property can be obtained for free, but still the good of 'Humanity' provides what's right for the artist, programmer, every original creator. Even when we can obtained things for free, we as a human knows the value and paid for it. Some people don't and some people pay. If your product's good, then we will paid for it, even if it's available for free, cause we want you to make more.

Faith in the goodness of humanity is what kept them alive and rich today. BUT those corporate fucks 
don't give a 2 bit fuck about humanity, about you happiness don't they?"

,Aoishiro,2013-01-03T11:34Z,"Something else to add. Take FM2013 this year. Some people decide to buy the game instead. That means Si successfully convert people from middle into inner circle. But me personally, i still can't afford it  so i still don't buy it. So SI can count statistically how significant the increase in revenue compared to last year? 1 million, 10 million? How many out of tens of thousands of people get converted? We get rob of our happiness so the company could get just a little bit richer?

So on to different topic. Stealing. IF you download this then make money with it, for example sell pirated DVD, then you're stealing. That money you get is not yours to begin with. I intent to use this for myself and my family, i watched this on my own discretion. How's that stealing again? An i own 'THE HOBBIT' after i download this? Do i make money with it? 

I'm a good person, i have conscience. I know that because still feel bad for some of the stuff i got here. I don't care about big budget movie like this of course. But some of the indie game, GOG games for example, i do feel bad/guilty when i download them so i rarely download them. I feel bad for game company like visceral, or big huge game, or radical. I like their games, they provide me with little bit of happiness, and it's sad to see them gone. That's why it's important to support the creator when you could.  That's what a true pirate suppose to be. True pirate have conscience, they truly understand what they did, they appreciate intellectual properties. True pirate share."

,tor1976,2013-01-03T12:27Z,"Thx for all the effort that went into bringing this torrent. FWIW... saw this twice already in theatres... just enjoy the panning shots of the NZ countryside tremendously hope it translates well on my computer screen.

It's rare to see a debate on filesharing here, I'll add my 2 cents...

DON'T fall for the false dichotomy of purchasing / downloading... the entire argument is bogus. The entertainment industry is in complete disarray because it doesn't understand how to take advantage of this flood of technology fast enough to keep ahead of it, and the faster the rate of change the more they fall behind. Economic studies are proving that filesharing is tremendously beneficial to artists and content producers alike. It's not ""stealing"" in the legal sense. It's a form of viral marketing akin to product sampling. Economically provable FACT that there is a positive correlation between downloading in spending on entertainment products, music, movies, games etc from downloaders. Simply put... the biggest downloaders tend to be the biggest spenders on entertainment content.

But tell you what... I will BOYCOTT any production company that chooses to prosecute me for attempting to sample their product when it's my attention, interest and money they should be courting. You don't want me to watch your crappy sh1tass movies or listen to your tripe music? FU I wont. Eat shit and die to all the content nazis out there.

But please don't waste your time on this version... There are much nicer DVDSCR's out there.

you can choose to opt out of google street view and they will not make your photo accessible. 

you own no part of the your ""digital self"" since you agreed to terms and conditions that took ownership away from u. dont like it? dont join these things

the govt does NOT monitor everybody, do you have any idea how goddamn long that would take? it takes u 24 hours to filla day full of activities. meaning it would take just as long to monitor those activities and even longer to determine the meaning and intent behind them. and thats just one single person. 

you may choose to put something on the internet without DRM protection, and then its stolen and theres nothing u can do about it. movie studies put these things in place so that they can get them to people and make them available while still protecting their IP. 

downloading a movie is NOT peaceful protest, nor is redistributing it. It is theft because the media in question has been trademarked, copyrighted, digitally protected and hundreds of thousands if not millions were spent to give the studio the ownership of the media. saying it costs too much or the ""fat cats"" are criminals is not a convincing argument when u walk into a 7/11 during a protest and start taking snickers bars off the rack n shoving them in ur pocket. 

im all for file sharing and free speech and privacy and all that jazz. but the reality is, we live in a day and age where everything is accessible to everyone all the time. you obviously take advantage of that judging by the way you talk, but u seem to not like when its used against you. 

the point is that u can get all high and mighty and it means nothing. this is the internet, your rant sounds no different than anyone elses rant. its not taken seriously and if you honestly tried to use these arguments in a court of law, the judge and everyone listening would tune out halfway through and sentence you to the max penalty when they saw your mouth stop moving. take the movie and shut ur damn mouth.

,dlarrym1111,2013-01-06T06:48Z,"I Loved this movie!!!  There must be a 2nd one. At the very end, IF anyone has read the book, it doesn't end with waking the dragon, the story continues and the dragon is dealt with. The movie follows the book pretty well up to WAYYY premature ending. Hope the rest is made in to a PART 2.I also found it rather dark. I tried VLC, QUICKTIME PRO, DIVX 6.0, & a movie player platformed only for Macs called CHROMA 2009.1. by a company that stopped writing upgrades or changed their name, as the site where I bought it at. . . (aa company called MIRALABS) CHROMA Chroma is based off QUICKTIME and can use its plugins as can it use PERIAN. despite it's inventors being out of business (no further updates are available, it was first released in 2007. ANYWAY, its my favorite.
My point is as hard as I tried, I could not get the movie to brighten up. I got a little better picture by tweaking the GAMMA settings but still was abnormally dark. Lastly, THANKS big time scene4all, it is great to get screeners, and I am grateful, but Is their a version that has not been tampered with??? I feel the blurring out deal makes it worse then the see-through watermarks. I wish a copy that has been left alone will surface. Scene4all, if you have the original screener copy, I would, and many other would jump for joy if an ""untouched version was uploaded. I sounds like you have the original, so if you read this, I hope you can do this. Remember how awesome the X-MEN Origin of WOLVERINE screener was where you could see parts that reveled how they put computer generated sequences into being. That was a really cool upload and got HUGE positive feedback. Also, who and or what is meant by the CM8 that pops up in the middle of the film. it is obviously added in. Is that guy/girl? the person that had the original of this screener. He must have worked for a studio where the record shows like LEONARD MARTIN. He is a popular film critic. he is but one example of an authorized person that gets screeners before the are released. How else could he watch and rate these films before the come out. Someone working in that studio, must have had a powerful laptop that he or she brought to work. It is probably a tech that works with the sound, a gaffer, a keygrip, or set builder. All that would be needed is to get that screener pre release copy and quickly record it onto their laptop and put it back to where ever a studio would store a copy like that without anyone knowing. when this person gets home. . .  BAM, now a movie is out that isn't a shitty CAM but is a real DVD copy but has not hit the theater yet. MAD bravery kudos to whoever is doing that kind of stuff. its the only way a screener can get out to US :~)
Lastly to put emphasis, can an untouched copy with all the watermarks get uploaded. Just take the copy that you have before you put all the blurry stuff every where and upload it. :) I have hear this want by literally thousands of people I know on facebook. they all badly wish that copy will show up. ALL things considered, it is a very watchable and great copy. THANKS again."

It ends half way through the original book, without proper ending, so the producer can rip people off twice. I was disappointed that it wasn't actually a whole story, and why? Hobbit is even thinner than any other part of LOTR.

This is material that happened simultaneously as the events in the hobbit... basically lotr-prequel material, by today's terms. It's a good thing. 

I'm first in line to charge people with exploiting us for a buck, but in this case... Anyone into Tolkien's stuff and Jackson's interpretations should be more than pleased. The 'extra' stuff is crucial Tolkien that no one ever expected to see on screen."
