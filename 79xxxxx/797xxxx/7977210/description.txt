Not particularly country-sounding, the introspective Interiors was seen by a number of critics and fans as a personal catharsis for Rosanne Cash. Shortly after its release, she broke up with husband and longtime producer Rodney Crowell. In a first, Cash produced the album herself, and all of the songs are either written or co-written by Cash. However, the album did not do very well commercially, reaching only no.23 on the Billboard charts. (wikipedia)
