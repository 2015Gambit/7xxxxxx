Blew was intended to be released to promote an upcoming European tour, but this plan was scrapped, and the maxi single ended up being released exclusively in the UK shortly after its completion.
 
As Blew was released only in the UK it was thus difficult to obtain elsewhere. Only 3000 copies of the maxi single were pressed on 12 inch vinyl and CD. Both vinyl and CD counterfeit copies exist, of which the vinyl copies vary in color (the official 12 inch vinyl was only pressed on black vinyl).
