- Captain Britain & MI13 (all 15 numbers)
- Locke and key open moon (One-Shot)
- Wolverine Origins number 50
- X-Men Emperor Vulcan (the 5 numbers)
- Moon Knight v3 numbers 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30
- Wolverine v3 numbers 69 to 74 
Sorry if this isn't the way to approach, but i can't seem to find these :x "
