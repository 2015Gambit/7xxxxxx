[V],thenoobish,2013-01-01T13:15Z,Do you guys have the latest WinRar installed?
,gmazz,2013-01-01T18:57Z,I'm using unarchiver.  
[V],thenoobish,2013-01-01T20:10Z,Guess you are running Mac. Try this program; Split & Concat.
,badboyno1,2013-01-02T12:34Z,7 zip did it for me tnx for the help anyway guys
,gmazz,2013-01-02T22:10Z,This seems to be a waste of time if you are a Mac user.  Stuffit or Unarchiver has no success.  Bummer!
[V],thenoobish,2013-01-02T22:52Z,Did you test the program I recommended? 
,gmazz,2013-01-02T23:25Z,I downloaded it. Seems to be a nightmare to use.   I'm lost!
[V],thenoobish,2013-01-03T00:16Z,"Try HJSplit in that case, or get WinRar."
