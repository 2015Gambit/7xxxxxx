The popular Tony HawkΓÇÖs sports game franchise is now on the Xbox 360 with Tony HawkΓÇÖs American Wasteland. With revamped graphics to match its port as an Xbox 360 video game, this sports game sticks to the previous gameΓÇÖs dynamics that had made the series so popular. Tony HawkΓÇÖs American Wasteland features one massive level, where you make a name for yourself by skating against LAΓÇÖs established gangs. This Xbox 360 video game is a pleasure to play with the Xbox controller, throwing away the earlier notion that it could only be played effectively with a PS controller. The tricks have a rather easy learning curve and novice players can quickly adapt to this sports game, whether it be skating down a railing or doing tricks on a BMX bike. The background music features a selection of punk bands that will immerse you in this Xbox 360 video game. Plus, the multiplayer mode lets you go head to head against a friend on the same console or log in to Xbox Live to battle it out with up to eight other players.
