Santa Claus, my dear old friend, you are a thief, a traitor, a slanderer,
a murderer, a liar, but worst of all you are a mockery of everything for which
I stood.

You have sung your last ho, ho, ho, for I am coming to take your head.
I am coming to take back what is mine, to take back Yuletide...

=======

The author and artist of The Child Thief returns with a modern fabulist tale
of Krampus, the Lord of Yule and mortal enemy of Santa Claus.


One Christmas Eve in a small hollow in Boone County, West Virginia,
struggling songwriter Jesse Walker witnesses a strange spectacle:
seven devilish figures chasing a man in a red suit toward a sleigh and eight
reindeer. When the reindeer leap skyward taking the sleigh, devil men, and
Santa into the clouds, screams follow. Moments later, a large sack plummets
earthward, a magical sack that will thrust the down-on-his luck singer into
the clutches of the terrifying Yule Lord, Krampus. But the lines between good
and evil become blurred as Jesse's new master reveals many dark secrets about
the cherry-cheeked Santa Claus, and how half a millennium ago, the jolly old
saint imprisoned Krampus and usurped his magic.

Now Santa's time is running short, for the Yule Lord is determined to have his
retribution and reclaim Yuletide. If Jesse can survive this ancient feud, he
might have the chance to redeem himself to his family, to save his own broken
dreams...and help bring the magic of Yule to the impoverished folk of Boone
County.
