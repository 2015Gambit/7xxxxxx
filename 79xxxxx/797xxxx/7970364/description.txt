My wicked brother and me asked ourselves: "And Today?" 

What is music today in Italy?
Just the stale reboiled broth of epigones like Ligabue or Vasco Rossi?
Just that off-pitch slob named Jovanotti/Lorenzo Cherubini, playing on his bongo like a chimpanzee and pretending to be an intellectual cause left wingers today see him as trendy (decadence of left winger culture :P )?

No... We got to dig again underground... in the darkness... where strange haunting ghosts prowl, singing strange tunes and... Lo! There's music again...

A lot of bands you haven't probably heard about before. Old artists still playing and new young ones with their ideas and skills.

Progressive rock music in all the declensions which are spelled today...
The progarchives.com site enumerates them like this:
crossover prog = cp
eclectic prog = ep
heavy prog = hp
jazz rock fusion = jrf
neo prog = np
progressive metal = pm
rio avantprog = rio
rock progressivo italiano = rpi
symphonic prog = sp

So now you have it: a collection of more or less 88 albums, giving you a partial insight of the contemporary progressive music in Italy...
It's incomplete of course... We weren't often able to find discographies for these bands ('cause it's almost impossible to find them online and also to buy them in several cases :P )
Also, we didn't want to build a torrent too big and difficult to share. 
Probably in the near future we will post the Revenants 2 with new material we are finding and organizing now...

Meanwhile, dig this ghostly "review"...

All the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).
The sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.
Different rates are signed in the name of the albums zips.

Enjoy :)
