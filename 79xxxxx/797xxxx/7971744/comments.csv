I never thought I would see the day where I get to re-watch ALL of the episodes I have few in my collection! this is just one of those so odd and quirky shows that sticks out from the crowd, sometimes it does feel a bit to centered for a very young crowd but all in all this show is great that coupled with some very strange dream scenes and the black and white photographs for faces ahhh what a great show!"
