The Hits is an out-of-print second compilation album and first wide-released greatest hits album from American country music artist Garth Brooks. Brooks first greatest hits album, The Garth Brooks Collection, was released three months earlier exclusively at McDonald's restaurants for a limited time to raise money for the Ronald McDonald Children's Charities. The Hits was released on December 13, 1994 and was quickly deleted at Brooks' request. He insisted it only be available for a limited time, but not before it sold well over ten million copies. The Hits debuted at no.1 on the Billboard 200, and Top Country Albums. In June 1995, the master was buried under GarthΓÇÖs star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. (wikipedia)
