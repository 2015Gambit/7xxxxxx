I didn't see a torrent of this on here and the CD is now out of print and the album isn't available digitally except via itunes, so I felt it needed preserving.  First album by Jessicka's post-Jack Off Jill band, ripped from CD with EAC and encoded with LAME.  More info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Heart_Dealer
