,brianxxx,2013-01-04T01:56Z,"I have read a few of Trump's books. Basically, they all repeat themselves. I will say that in real business circles with people that are successful, Trump is considered a joke and a farce. I am certainly not rich but have always found it disturbing that this guy cannot get his casinos to be profitable. They have all been through bankruptcy numerous times. lol I mean, how can you not make money with a casino when all his competitors have no trouble doing so. Makes you wonder about his talents...at least it makes me wonder. lol"
