At a time when wildlife is disappearing across the planet, one animal is making a comeback - the wolf.Wolves were wiped out across much of America, with more than a million wolves estimated to have been shot, poisoned or trapped when European settlers arrived. This enthralling series documents the return of one very special wolf pack to the snowy peaks of Washington's Cascade Mountains - the first to return to the American Northwest in 70 years.

Episode 2
Duration: 00:51:48

After spending four weeks camping out in the bitterly cold Cascade Mountains, wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan and a team of wolf experts discover that most of the pack have been killed by locals who live by the motto "shoot, shovel and shut up". But have any of the pack escaped unharmed? As the team chase exciting new leads, there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon.
