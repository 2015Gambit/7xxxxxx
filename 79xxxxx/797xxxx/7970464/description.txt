About Dr. J. Vernon McGee
John Vernon McGee was born in Hillsboro, Texas, in 1904. Dr. McGee remarked, "When I was born and the doctor gave me the customary whack, my mother said that I let out a yell that could be heard on all four borders of Texas!" His Creator well knew that he would need a powerful voice to deliver a powerful message.

On the morning of December 1, 1988, Dr. McGee fell asleep in his chair and quietly passed into the presence of his Savior.

The Devil by B R Larkin:
"A person said to me, 'Why, Dr. Lakin, Jesus could not have been born of a human mother without a human father.' Listen, I would have you know that the first man who ever got in this world got here without either.'"

In the early 1950s Dr. Lakin began a 30-year itinerant ministry that included the largest churches in America, averaging 50,000 miles annually and 4,000 people weekly. He witnessed more than 100,000 conversions to Christ. .

The Judgment Seat of Christ by Harold Sightler:
We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
