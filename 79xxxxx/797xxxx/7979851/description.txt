SONGS FOR DRELLA (1990)
Performed by Lou Reed and John Cale

Digitally mastered from VHS and converted from DVD-R
to MPEG-4 Nero Digital Cinema AVC (high quality MP4)

A collector's item.  The VHS I got from a friend, who can't remember ever playing it, so it's ideal for digital transfer. This little "concert" was never released officially on DVD.

John Cale and Lou Reed teamed up to write and perform this series of songs about the late Andy Warhol.  Easily one of the best projects either one has been involved with, including their famous work with the Velvet Underground. Emotionally and intellectually affecting.
