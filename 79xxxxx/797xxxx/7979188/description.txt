The women of the iconic eighties band the Go-GoΓÇÖs will always be remembered as they appeared on the back of their debut record: sunny, smiling, each soaking in her own private bubble bath with chocolates and champagne. The photo is a perfect tribute to the fun, irreverent brand of pop music that the Go-GoΓÇÖs created, but it also conceals the trials and secret demons that the members of the groupΓÇöand, in particular, its lead singer, Belinda CarlisleΓÇöstruggled with on their rise to stardom.

Leaving her unstable childhood home at the age of eighteen, Belinda battled serious weight issues, having been teased for her pudginess throughout grade school, and grappled with her confusion about being deserted by her biological father as a child. This talented but misguided teen found solace in the punk rock world that so openly welcomed misfitsΓÇöeven though acceptance had its price.
