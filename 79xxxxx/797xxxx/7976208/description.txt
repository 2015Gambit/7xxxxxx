To my fellow pirates,


	To sum it up, I've had an amazing year and with all the things I've done, it'll be a great kick start for 2013! It started with a simple ebook, and now I've become a trusted contributor to The Pirate Bay (it means I got my pink skull!). I've revamped my internet to handle more seeding and have created a website just for my fellow pirates! I've changed the layout of torrents so that they are more user friendly and I'm going to continue bringing change and torrents to the world!

	So to celebrate a great year and an upcoming great one, here's a New Year bundle with all my torrents from 2012! That's 244 MB (expanded) worth of amazing books, cracks and other things! Share it with everybody and I hope you enjoy all these things that I enjoy, which is why I'm sharing it with the world!
