Game info:

The latest creation from gaming icon Tim Schafer and the award-winning team at
Double Fine, Brtal Legend is a 3rd person Action/Adventure game starring Jack
Black in the role of roadie Eddie Riggs, who sets on an epic quest to build an
army of rockers with only a broad axe, a big block V8 and his faithful
guitar in hand. Eddie Riggs has been drawn back through time to a mythical
world dripped in Rock and Roll folklore; where great Metal titans once ruled
and power chords rang from the countryside for all to hear. When an oppressed
people request Eddies knowledge of modern warfare, he pulls from his own
experience in the only occupation hes ever had, a roadie for a Heavy Metal
band. From this springs the most hellacious army man has ever seen, and thus
brings this ancient world into the Age of Metal.
