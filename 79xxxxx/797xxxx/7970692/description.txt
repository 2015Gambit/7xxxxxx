Release Notes:

A companion to the documentary No Room for Rockstars, The Vans Warped Tour:
Greatest Hits serves up a collection of tracks from some of the punk festival's
most prestigious acts. Featuring songs from artists like the Specials, the
Buzzcocks, Suicidal Tendencies, and the Descendents, the ten-track compilation
is like a Punk 101 course, touching on some of the groups that were instrumental
in helping the genre cross over to a wider audience with their pop-leaning
sensibilities. Though most anyone who would check out a documentary about the
Warped Tour no doubt owns most of these songs already, it still makes for a
pretty killer compilation to reminisce about tours past during the summer
months.
