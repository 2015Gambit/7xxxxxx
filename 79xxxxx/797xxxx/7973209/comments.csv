,Amafule10,2012-12-31T11:49Z,Nice movie. But don't expect scary scenes. It's more like a psychological thriller ...with nice boobs.
,n00berman,2012-12-31T14:56Z,"Just FYI, this movie is based on a true story.
Check the movie's wikipedia page or  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_search_prank_call_scam#Mount_Washington.2C_Kentucky.2C_incident"

I've tested it my self and confirmed it as have 3 of my other friends. We all love your uploads, and appreciate them very much. You're uploads are great, but you need to fix this, because giving your loyal followers, who always seed.. Mal-ware and viruses isn't very good. Get rid of TornTV and everything else and get a legitimate direct download site."

M/5, predicable, though does make you question, ""What are you thinking!?"". yuk."
,Phatfish,2013-01-01T15:43Z,"The story is very unsettling but the fact remains that the movie is absolute shit.

Sadly I can say that I know many incidents with real actual police officers involved that where, not as extreme as this , but very similar.

To mentally torment, dominate and humiliate people in interrogation, with total disregard for human rights is sadly not that uncommon, especially when they have no evidence to relay on."
