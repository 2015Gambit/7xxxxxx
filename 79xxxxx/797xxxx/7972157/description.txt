Making quite a splash in the Doctor Who fan film community, the first episode of Doctor Who: An Unofficial Fan Series aspires to be the Star Trek: New Voyages of the Who set. Strong performances (especially Jennifer Richman as Alice) and finely-tuned CG effects make this about as much like the ΓÇ£realΓÇ¥ series as you could ask for. And, if all turns out well, thereΓÇÖll eventually be twelve more just like it. (Hint: There's only the one epsiode)

In SD MP4 format, this is the only copy I could find on the web. The official site for Doctor Who 2009 is at this time offline and it would be a shame to lose this work of film forever. Please seed and I hope you enjoy the film.

Runtime: Approx 70 minutes
