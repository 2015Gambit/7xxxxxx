,Team_Alice,2013-01-01T06:39Z,"hey d, was wonderin if you were going to do a 720p version. sounds interesting but 15G is alot to commit to with out knowing for sure ya know. by the by love your work, thanks for all the enjoyment you've given me."
,anNakaWhat,2013-01-01T07:57Z,"This is kinda random, but i was curious to know if you had Bakuman english dubbed? i can't find any torrents for it"
[V],Daman4Iife,2013-01-01T08:07Z,"a 720p version without losing Grain will come out to be around 8-10GB so its really not worth it. 
This movie has so much grain that encoding it will just hurt it."
,Team_Alice,2013-01-01T08:33Z,that sucks but i understand lol thanks for the resp. guess i'll be devoting all my band-with for awhile lol
,roundnut,2013-01-02T07:46Z,"Hey Daman, I love your uploads. Can you tell me, what is it about your encoding that my devices (wdtv smp, ps3, etc.) can't seem to recognise?"
,Team_Alice,2013-01-02T09:07Z,"@roundnut
more than likely that there mkv. files. 10 bit or 8 bit also makes a diff"
[V],Daman4Iife,2013-01-02T09:14Z,"Round, This is 8bit so it will play fine on the ps3 via Ps3mediaserver.

10bit Videos cant be played on anything besides a computer or special players for now at least."
[V],Daman4Iife,2013-01-02T10:43Z,"just a heads up to people that usually convert this to play on Ps3/Xbox or on the tv via usb, i suggest you dont re-encode it. 
it plays fine on anything since its 8bit.
if you try to get rid of the grain you will lose a tremendou amount of quality and the blu ray version will all be for naught.
this should be watch straight out of the box. "
,roundnut,2013-01-02T10:44Z,thanks guys
,roundnut,2013-01-02T10:54Z,were all of your previous uploads 10bit? (not including the uploads encoded by others)
,realist31,2013-01-02T18:10Z,How do we know if its 8 or 10 bit
[V],Daman4Iife,2013-01-02T20:49Z,"realist, I already said its 8bit,
plus this is a remux meaning its has not been encoded, its straight out of the BLU RAY DISK, 
ALL I DID was change the subtitles FROM pgs to ASS AND GAVE IT A FONT, THATS ALL.

and all Blu ray disks are 8bit."
,mooserocka,2013-01-03T00:12Z,Honestly 480 1080 IT all looks completly the same. With anime i cant tell the differnance like in a movie or watching sports.
,Team_Alice,2013-01-03T01:35Z,"@moos
completly agree, unless ur watching on a high res tv it doesn't matter. i play it on my laptop so i pefer 480p for download size"
,Team_Alice,2013-01-03T01:38Z,"@moos
completly agree, unles ur watching on high-res tv. i play it on my laptop so 480p is better for download size"
[V],Daman4Iife,2013-01-03T01:54Z,"Moose, your monitor is probably complete crap, 
The difference between 720p and 1080p is actually pretty damm high, unless the anime is actually 720p and upscaled to 1080p for Blu ray. 

a 480p Grainy version of this is around 3-6GB"
,mooserocka,2013-01-03T03:39Z,I dont watch on my monitor. I watch on a 65 inch 1080 p tv. I can tell diff on sound sports movies but anime NO differance at all. It looks the same. Maybe the colors look a lil more colorful other then that cant really tell. high def with anime isnt that much of an upgrade.
,ANIMELIFE,2013-01-03T09:11Z,"i watch it on samsung led 1080p 100wt 65x63.5 so it looks high def anyways
doent make any diffrent anyways"
[V],Daman4Iife,2013-01-03T13:30Z,"Monitors or TV make a big difference in the Quality of the Rips. 

I watch everything on a 30inch IPS monitor which Cost around 500-3000$

IPS monitors have better Colors,Contrast and basically everything besides Gaming."
,ANIMELIFE,2013-01-03T17:27Z,"the thing is that ips 30 inch monitor of yours is low on sharpness so sometimes its just watching with a normal 1280x720p monitor you know what i mean. i have a 4k resolution tv so it supports most of the file formats even the latest ones too ,not to brag ips computer of yours is very good and it really needs at least 480 funimation new anime dvd rips to get it look like great ones but its recomended for you to a least have 720p 1080 or 10 bit encode"
,allnone,2013-01-03T19:05Z,"Was hoping for a 720p, but I guess this will have to do. The difference between 720p is hardly noticeable on anything under 40"", IMO and even over 40"" you would have to be close enough to tell the difference. I have a 24"" monitor and 37"" TV so it's mostly the same to me. I can only tell the difference between 480p and 720p on monitor because I sit closer to. Your eye sight can also play into this because you have to be able to see the differences.

But, in live action shows or high budget 3D animation, it's VERY obvious."
[V],Daman4Iife,2013-01-03T22:11Z,"IPS Monitors>>>> anything else 
My monitor Resolution is 2560x1600 
anyone that deals with Filming or wants best Quality possible needs an IPS monitor.

Most Apple 25+inch monitors are IPS

The Sharpness has nothing to do with the monitor or TV. "
,Lost_Leaf,2013-01-06T05:08Z,"Roughly how long will it be do you think before Steins;Gate part 2 released? 

I honestly don't mind the high file size. "
,mooserocka,2013-01-07T03:31Z,honestly big monitors little monitors Im saying with animation there is NO diferance. I cant tell like i can with movies and sports. High def looks EXactly the same to me on 480 and 1080. 
,ANIMELIFE,2013-01-07T09:27Z,it very true
,Gr33ncar,2013-01-09T09:16Z,so any news for when the third one is coming out?
