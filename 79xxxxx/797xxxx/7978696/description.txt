T.O.D. Johnston's Holy Bible studies are thoroughly researched and written from a layman's perspective. The Holy Bible commentaries are based on Bible study lessons that T.O.D. taught at Paran Baptist Church (located at 1603 Johnsonville Highway, Lake City, South Carolina). T.O.D.'s "Bible Study Lessons on Various Subjects" is based on sermons that were taught over the years, at our church.
