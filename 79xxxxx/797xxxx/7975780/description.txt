Thich Nhat Hanh is a Buddhist monk from Viet Nam. He was nominated for the Nobel Peace prize by Martin Luther King Jr.

Here's a nice collection of his books (some pdfs, some epubs) and dharma talks.

Thanks to Thich for making this available and for sharing this with all of us for the benefit of all sentient beings.
