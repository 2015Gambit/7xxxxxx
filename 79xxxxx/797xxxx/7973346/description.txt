Dictionary

The Dictionary is Korean ΓÇô Korean or Korean ΓÇô English, but there is also an English ΓÇô English dictionary (Chambers). 
There are two different ways of finding a word in the ΓÇ£PowerdicΓÇ¥. You can either use a really small on screen keyboard, or you can use the D2s hand writing recognition abilities. The second method is not always terribly accurate. People who have used a PDA will probably be quite familiar with hand writing recognition. 

The Dictionary was added in firmware revision 3.40b.

I have looked everywhere for the Cowon D2 version and have only been able to get the S9 version. I found this on my hard drive while cleaning up files and organizing. I am sure others are looking for this. I will keep seeding for up to a year or so. That will get a good base of seeders going from various audio forums hopefully. Enjoy!
