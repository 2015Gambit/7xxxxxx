The first entry in the joyous roll-em-up series for PlayStation 3, Katamari Forever retains the basic Katamari Damacy formula but ups the scale of everything. You'll find items in far greater numbers sitting around waiting to be picked up and added to your growing katamari clump. The game features over 30 stage goals -- the highest number in series history. All of this is presented in full 1080p visual quality. In addition, the visual design has changed. Or, rather, it can be changed. You can now choose your own visual style, selecting from a variety of styles like "comic touch," "new touch," and "wood touch." The game's rendering engine changes accordingly. Those who like the original style can play the old fashioned way too.
