Plasticni Isus, 1971.

An illegal movie of Yugoslavia. Film was put aside twice. At first, it was forbiden and it's author was arrested. Second time when it was publically aired. Both times it was politics. 
This, and many other re-births of this movie these days are about _movie_ itself. 

Plot:
Tom is a young guy from Zagreb, completely without money, trying to make films in Belgrade. He somehow manages to survive with a help of women. He doesn't believe in anybody, respects no one and is in constant conflict with the ruling system and order. After being left by a silly American girl, Tom binds with a woman whose husband is abroad. When she kicks him out, he moves in with her husband's sister, who later kills him in the attack of jealousy. All this is shown in the context of major historical events prior to 1968. with lots of archive footages of world leaders.
