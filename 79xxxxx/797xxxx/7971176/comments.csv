Hey pussy, why don't you try upgrading your hardware instead of crying? My setup can support .mkv all day, maybe your poverty setup needs someone who is committed to streaming instead of some faggoty 15 year old who cant afford proper equipment. Get out of here you little bitch."

,Sikkwolf,2012-12-31T07:59Z,"Xdesteron seems to have missed the point in the post he so lovingly derided. 

What the other guy was saying, you dumb nigger, is that software support for .mkv is lacking. Truthfully, this has always been the case, it has nothing to do with your rig, as a 500$ acer will put out passable 16:1 nowadays, as long as you don't sneeze while it's doing it. 

It is pointless to upload videos in .mkv seeing as though my computer will run it perfectly with no conversion the same cannot be said for my ps3, xbox, or tablets. Of course I could always bog my rig down with more bullshit streaming software suites, but not conducive to the stability of my own functioning environment and I seek technological homeostasis at all point of my existence. 

Bottom line, thanks for the up Scene, you're always great and for the price, I can be troubled to convert it if I need it on the go. And tough guy with the tasteless ad-hominem diatribe, get a clue before you shit talk, you just look like a clueless ass. "

Awesome quality and very very minimal screener obstruction.  The phrase ""For Your Consideration"" appears at the bottom of the screen for about 3 seconds maybe 3 or 4 times through out the entire film.

,ht0fff,2013-01-05T01:29Z,"@MKV haters: guys, mkv is way superior than mp4 or avi. Just because some HW manufacturers are incapable of a proper implementation, it does not mean that mkv is a bad format.
I suggest you do some reading (especially the specifications and features), before posting crap.
Your PS3 does not even play 6-channel audio, but you are complaining about mkv? So converting a 5.1 AC3 or AAC stream to 2-channel is ok, but converting mkv to mp4/avi is not?
I give you a little hint: use a real media server/streamer/player."

,enonumus,2013-01-05T08:27Z,"@mycholula

You stopped the download and deleted it because it was in an MKV container?  Seriously?  MKV is the newest (although it's several years old now) and best container there is, the fastest to work with, and the most versatile.  It takes 5 minutes MAX to drop the contents of an MKV into an MP4 container if you're incapable of dealing with an MKV, so that was just stupid to cancel your download and waste that time.  Try educating yourself a little bit about containers so you don't sound like a little whiner when someone provides a FREE movie in the best format, and you're too stupid to know how to deal with it."
,jaqattack,2013-01-05T09:10Z,"lovely, thank you very much :-)"
,enonumus,2013-01-06T01:50Z,"A8/V8 (for a  Cam), overall it's definitely watchable.  It's not as dark as most cams, though there's definitely a lot of detail lost to the dark areas.  Audio is pretty good.  The biggest problems are the constant horizontal scan lines and the large amount of screen that's been cropped away, so faces are often cut off, but if you don't want to go see it at the theater for whatever reason and you can't wait for DVD quality or better, this is watchable.
