Description : Tamilee Webb, Donna Richardson, Tracy York!!! If you Like to do Aerobics and toning Together and specifically Want to work on your lower body, this tape may be for you. Co-instructors Tamilee Webb, Donna Richardson, and Tracy York begin by each leading their own aerobics segments. They utilize easy-to-follow dance moves, throwing in variations like a latin or funk beat. After the aerobics section, you move on to the target toning for the lower body, begining with standing exercises (lunges, plies, etc.) And then eventually moving to the floor. Again, each instructor leads you through a different segment of tough leg, hip, and [glutes] work. The exercises themselves are nothing new, but they're clearly effective. All three instructors provide very good cueing, but I found them each to be much more low key than they are on other tapes. However, if you are Looking for a Basic Workout Aerobics and toning, you Will Probably Like this tape Platinum Series
