,toadza,2012-12-31T14:15Z,Do you happen to have the Packers at Minnesota? I'm stationed in Switzerland and have been avoiding FB all day trying to spoil the game :)
,BostonAl2012,2012-12-31T15:14Z,"Thanks Nepotu, for the wonderful NFL Season 2012!  

Some great games this week too.  That determined the Playoff Standings.

PLAYOFFS!  PLAYOFFS DID YOU SAY PLAYOFFS!

AFC:
Broncos
Patriots
Texans
Ravens
colts 
Bengals

NFC:
Falcons
Seahawks
Packers
Cowboys/Redskins Winner (I'm waiting for the torrent to watch this one~don't spoil) :-) 
49ers
Vikings 

BTW: This is a legendary game for a different reason too.  Gil Santos, the Voice of the Patriots in New England for 35yrs (That's Radio) and his partner of 28yrs, color man Gino Capelletti, (the first player to score in the old AFL & the All Time Scoring Leader AFL) are together again (1st qrtr only).  This drama played out on the Radio but was acknowledged briefly on the air during this broadcast.  They cut to the radio feed for the good byes and Gil's call of the last drive in the 1st. "
,BostonAl2012,2012-12-31T15:15Z,I'll take the 540p of the skins/boys Haha game.  :)
[V],Nepotu,2013-01-02T16:08Z,All problems solved. Cheers to all!
