,VA_ATS,2012-12-30T11:59Z,Of course it is a .rar? I had to package it up to reserve space. You think I went through 8 hours of zipping to install a virus? Give me a break dude.
,frobknob,2012-12-30T14:48Z,"And do you think we want to download 56 gigabytes of crap when we might want ten books out of the whole collection?

Jesus, what a waste."
,VA_ATS,2012-12-30T19:43Z,"You know how much data there is beforehand, and I listed the reading materials.

If you guys are that adamant about it, maybe, just maybe, when I get the chance, I will upload the individual folders.

However, as it stands now, this a collection, my library, that I have collected. If you have a specific request, ask and I may fill it.

There is no reason to be nasty about it though guys."
,VA_ATS,2012-12-30T19:44Z,"By the way, you have a recycle bin for a reason. Take what you want and delete the rest if you are that ungrateful ;/"
,w4r3zh4ck,2012-12-30T20:53Z,how dare you release top secret esoteric material ???? you have any idea of the consequences if used wrong by the newbies?

The time of holding up the veil is expiring. Knowledge shouldn't be withheld from any man/woman."
,w4r3zh4ck,2012-12-30T22:51Z,There is a special torrent tracker only for occultism. So for those who seek they will find it. This is a public tracker. Great power musn't fall into the wrong hands
,VA_ATS,2012-12-31T05:47Z,"Warschack, I was not aware of a special torrent tracker for the occult. Could you point me in the right direction?"
,burt007,2012-12-31T08:19Z,"You can rar them, but individually and the result will be the same, but people can choose only the ones they want."
,burt007,2012-12-31T08:20Z,"Delete this torrent, VA_ATS, there are no seeders and re-upload individually rared. Thanks for your effort."
,VA_ATS,2012-12-31T08:32Z,"Burt, would you mind telling me how? Just .rar each folder and make an individual .torrent, or would they all be under the same one ???

I'm kinda new to the uploading portion of TPB. So sorry guys!"
,e8hffff,2012-12-31T12:26Z,"Sorry VA_ATS  there is many rar's shared that are passworded.

You should have separated the share into various compressed files,so that people could download section."
,e8hffff,2012-12-31T12:28Z,"VA_ATS categorise content into folders. Rar each folder separately.  Drag all the rar's into a new appropriately named folder,  then make a torrent based on the folder with only the rar's in it."
,VA_ATS,2012-12-31T23:40Z,"Gotcha. Thanks for the heads-up. I will attempt to redo this upload under those circumstances.

Over 3000 e-books total though guys, so it's quite a treasure chest. Some are duplicates, but not many."
,boyaccent,2013-01-02T11:49Z,"You beat my 41.7 gb occult collection since 2006.  Looking forward to the gift. 

And sorry you had to bear some nasty comments for the noble upload.

Those who are seeking are already aligned, so  no need to add extra layers of deception. "
