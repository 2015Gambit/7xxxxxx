Joanna Lumley: The Search for Noah's Ark 
Whether she's marvelling at the Northern Lights or perspiring gently as she sails along the River Nile, Joanna Lumley is always a pleasant travelling companion, charming everyone she meets. She's exploring the origins of the ancient tale about Noah and the Ark, a story that unites people and religions all over the world. It involves an epic journey from the slopes of Mount Ararat in Turkey to India and finally Oman as she unearths a significant number of scientific facts to back up what some dismiss as a fairy story. Not just a physical search for the ship, it's more about the symbolism of the story and our need to believe in it. For centuries, the possible existence of Noah's Ark has fascinated many, from explorer Marco Polo to oceanographer Robert Ballard, who discovered the wreck of the Titanic. In this documentary, Absolutely Fabulous star Joanna Lumley takes a journey from the British Museum into the heart of India, Turkey and Oman as she tries to uncover the truth behind the myths and track down what is thought to be the biblical vessel's final resting place. Along the way, she investigates claims that it has already been found, tells the story of the flood and asks why the Ark is so important, not only to people of faith, but also to respected scientists and archaeologists.
