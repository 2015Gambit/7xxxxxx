Treehouse - Build A Simple Website with HTML

This course is designed to quickly lead you through the steps of building an HTML website, and will walk you through the basics of HTML and CSS from the very beginning. HTML and CSS are the structural and presentational building blocks of every website and will serve as the foundation for any web project.

Author Nick Pettit simplifies the coding process, with straightforward steps you can recreate on your own. The course explains the basic structure of an HTML document, shows how to add text and images, and introduces font styling with CSS. 

From there, we'll add images, format text, and customize the CSS to create a beautiful standalone website for our imaginary cupcake company.

You'll learn about text editors and FTP programs, hosting, text and image tags, backgrounds, and a lot more!
