After years of meditation and training, 18-year-old Obadiah Archer has been dispatched to New York City to carry out the sacred mission of his family's sect-- kill the booze-addled immortal known only as Armstrong and convene a new world order! But as this underage assassin stalks his prey, he'll soon find that both hunter and hunted are just pawns in a global conspiracy stretching back five millennia-- and that Archer & Armstrong will have to work together if the future is to stand any chance of surviving the past's greatest threat!
