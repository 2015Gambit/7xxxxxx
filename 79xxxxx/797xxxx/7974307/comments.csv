My Win 8 suddenly has lost any network capability.
On the URL I posted is a link to my skydrive.
It wasn't much of anything anyway.
Bit thank you TPB."

And I understand anyone's reluctance to follow a URL link. These are not very well done. It is just my voice track against the original track. I learned to play guitar, piano, saxophone, trumpet, and a little drums as a child. I hung out with a jazz pianist at church. And my friend had a band. I suffer from Amnesia. It was only a few years ago that I began to realize that I knew how to play. Just enough to be embarrassing. I put these up to thank TPB and I am surprised someone is seeding them. I cannot download or seed them now."
,wintersbutterfly,2013-01-01T20:21Z,"I hate being new at stuff. In '97 I was afraid to get on the internet because I was afraid if I didn't know what I was doing I could break it. In '98 I got to demonstrate the internet with its first GUI Mozzila interface to our mayor at the university where I was the lab manager. I demonstrated it to him cause I was the only one who new how to configure the interrupts in the config and autoexec for the Sounfblaster card. I am that old. Anyway I am attempting to seed again. I am piggy backing off a neighbor's wireless (I am that poor) and they do not have open ports and yet I had absolutely no problem downloading 4 files yesterday,"
,wintersbutterfly,2013-01-01T20:38Z,"I am also on the Mac side of my computer at the moment (I have a Hackintosh dual-boot) I could do this easier in Win 8 but Win 8 has turned into a nightmare and my network refuses to work on it. My Wi-Fi is showing disabled although I enable it. So bear with me, please. In uTorrent I see peers and seeds in () and I assume those are peers I am not connected with because my port is not open. On Transmission I see it is seeding but no connected peers and ports are closed. I have tried port 80 and that doesn't seem to work. And yet I initially seeded the piano a couple of days ago on Win 8. I'll try a little longer and then I'll request TPB to remove them and clean up after me."
,wintersbutterfly,2013-01-03T00:41Z,It took me two days to remove Win 8 and still even with Win 7 I cannot seed. I thought possibly that Win 7 could open a port through upnp or teredo but it would not. These are in my Blog on Wordpress on the URL above. They are on my link to my Skydrive. Sorry. They are not much of anything. If I ever do get any good I would hope to just post on my Blog occasionally. Thank you again to TPB.
