,cindy25,2013-01-02T13:59Z,"can someone confirm that 107 and 109 are different, on some sites there are comments they are the same episode

this series will be very confusing to number, as it is shown in different order in Germany, France and Canada

I think this is the French episode order?"

[V],wilimaw,2013-01-03T02:31Z,"episode 1 and 7 are different episodes but have the same car chase scene in them for a few seconds so don't get confuzed,i'm not at fault for a badly made TV SHOW :)"
,craddle,2013-01-03T02:40Z,Can I get a seeder please? Just 1 any 1???
,craddle,2013-01-03T03:22Z,2 hours to download 1 episode........... FINALLY!
,craddle,2013-01-03T05:42Z,Episode 9 is mis-numbered.
,cindy25,2013-01-03T05:57Z,"I had previously downlaoded 9 episodes, and now had tofind the missing two

one was your 105 , and I think/hope the other is your 108

the French eps from the other site was not only numbered differently but named wrong in a few cases"
,cindy25,2013-01-03T06:00Z,"nothing is misnumbered, as this series is numbered in so many different ways (RTL-German, French, and soon Canada) even imdb and tvrage have different ordering

but for sure 105 was not in the original French uploads

we just have to trial and error to get what we miss.
