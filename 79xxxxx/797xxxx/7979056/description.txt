Notes: Big thanks to the source and Hive-CM8 for making safety first. We didnt have
to do to much since source was awesome as it is. All we did was resize video, used
a denoiser to help with the grainy look and adjusted the levels, brightness,
contrast and saturation since it seem a bit dark to us. Audio was changed to MP3
128. ENJOY!

P.S. Video has a slight video shutter to it from the source but.. I watch this video
all the way threw hardly noticeable.
