,helicon84,2013-01-01T20:18Z,Thanks for all the uploads. Amazing stuff. I was wondering has anyone scanned The Hive by Charles Burns? Could you look it up?
,Hamster-X,2013-01-01T20:26Z,OMG! Amazing! Thanks a MILLION STFmaryville!!!!! 
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-01T20:38Z,"helicon84, you're welcome. i haven't seen a scan of the hive yet, but i'll share it if i do. i suspect you already know how rare it is to find scans of (even the really) good independent works like those of burns ... which isn't to say it hasn't been scanned, but i didn't find it. hang in there."
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-01T20:43Z,"you're welcome Hamster-X. by the way, credit to shipJ who shared these in one of the ""Hitlist week"" torrents back in July! keep your eye on those, it's amazing how much great stuff is in them."
,Hamster-X,2013-01-01T21:35Z,@STFmaryville I will most definitely be keeping an eye out for those. Thanks again!
,Val_Wood,2013-01-02T05:04Z,i'll second the request for any Burns material.. if it helps get it scanned any quicker by any hesitant uploadere... Burns is a true genius in the comic storytelling craft
