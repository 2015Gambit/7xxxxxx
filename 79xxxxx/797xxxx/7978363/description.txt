Many good wishes for recovery going out to X-Factor writer Peter David, who had a stroke last week.  :-(

Zombies in King Arthur's Court.

That sums it up, but Knights of the Living Dead is so much more than a zippy high-concept mash-up. Written by Ron Wolfe and illustrated by Pinocchio Vampire Slayer's Dustin Higgins, Knights of the Living Dead transcends the brain-munching of most zombie fiction and examines the nature of ones soul and the essence of being.

All that PLUS brain eating and SWORDS! LOTS OF THEM.

Seriously, this is a fun and cool comic which will (once it sees print) sit beside things like Pinocchio Vampire Slayer as great comics for Young Adults.

While a print edition is planned, right now you can get your Medieval Zombies DIGITALLY, and best of all ISSUE #1 is FREE

Knights of the Living Dead is also available at the iTunes Store and coming soon to Comixology, iVerse, Graphicly and BN.COM (for Nook and Nook Color).
