,lif3isfr33,2012-12-30T21:41Z,900 seeders and 0.8kb/s?? I let this download overnight and all I get is 5% progress? Unbelievable.. gonna go get another torrent this one is too slow. I doubt this is even CDSPEED.. more like DIALUSPEED.
,dbolic,2012-12-30T23:19Z,If don't seed after you've downloaded fully for at least a few hours or something I say you're a douche bag.  That's how it works. But there's no way of upholding anyone to that.
,enonumus,2012-12-31T13:03Z,"The quality was great, thank you very much for this!  The main event and co-main events were very good, definitely worth watching.

FYI for anybody that might be downloading this to watch on a Patriot Box Office or similar media box; the file works but abruptly stops playing about 15 minutes before the end on my PBO, and some of the navigation features wouldn't work with this file either.  It's not the box, my 2,000+ other files work fine.  Not sure about PS3 playback, but it does work fine with VLC.   "

,hwadsworth,2013-01-01T18:11Z,Upload at least as much as you download or you're an ass. Happy New Year.
,IIRed_BaronII,2013-01-01T18:17Z,"Don't know what you're complaining about seeding.
Check your settings, I'm downloading at > 1.5 Mb and with over 200 seeders"
