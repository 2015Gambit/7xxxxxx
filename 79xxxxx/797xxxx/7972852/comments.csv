,Axrtssen,2012-12-31T15:45Z,Screens are fine for me!
,shallow2,2012-12-31T17:29Z,"@Kaptnobi, you could show a little more respect, if you dont like what is uploaded dont download.

However on your thoughts about bayimg I tend to agree. I am still on win xp and get alot of popups and potential virus/trojan and shit from the bayimg links.. The links directly to the jpeg image though is completely safe, and Merzedes and I have discussed it and decided to try posting those instead when we have to up screens ourselves...

This link would then be:
