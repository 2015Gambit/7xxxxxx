This two-disc release is a lot more fun than you might expect when you consider that it's a collection of recreations - sure, it has its flat moments (mainly several Mark Ayres performances that don't come off too well, such as the limp rendition of the Dr. Cult Files Soundtrack music CDs Who theme music and a painfully flat arrangement of the Babylon 5 theme), but these are far outweighed by the excellent performances throughout the album, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra providing notable versions of themes from The Avengers, The Saint, Perry Mason and Ironside, among others (though their arrangement for the Star Trek theme does an unfortunately spectacular job of bringing out the Tiki Lounge elements after a wonderful recreation of the sound of the original opening). Overall, an entertaining package
