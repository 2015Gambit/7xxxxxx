Just finished Mini-Butt 0.8.0 and i thought it was time to release it to the public for everyone to enjoy.
This program is FREEWARE and may be distributed freely and without restrictions. This little piece of
code was made in GFA-Basic 32Bit for Windows in my spare time. I hope everyone enjoys it.

Usage:

This program creates a button in the upper left corner of your desktop, when clicked on
ALL windows on your desktop minimizes or maximizes, thus clearing your desktop from
clutter. This is a feature wich is included in windows 7+, Unsure about Vista.
Ive tried this on a XP machine and it worked fine, although transparency didnt work
but that is a XP issue. I will continue to add bells and whistles, fix bugs etc when time allows for it. Email me if you have any concerns about the software.

Remember this is a early release so dont expect too much yet :)
Send me bugreports if you have trouble running it on your
computer.

Enjoy, and have a nice 2013, since this year is about to end.
