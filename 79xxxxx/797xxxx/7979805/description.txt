Nate Grey is having a nightmare in which he is responsible for half the world being destroyed. After encountering a Tech-Gnome, he and Madelyne Pryor travel to a small island in Philippines, the base of the mysterious Blaquesmith who appears to be the creator of the Tech-Gnomes. When Nate and Madelyne finally meet him, he explains that he gave Nate all those visions and nightmares about the end of the world, quite possibly because it may happen soon ΓÇô if they donΓÇÖt prevent it from happening. Nate and Maddie are then teleported by him to Latveria, where a strange pyramid crashes down from the sky. Elsewhere, Ness asks his cousin, Slaine, to tell him what he knows about the technology of the Tech-Gnome, before theyΓÇÖre attacked by the Hellbent, intent on slaying Ness for betraying them. Slaine dies during the fight but not before killing one of the Hellbent, which flee.
