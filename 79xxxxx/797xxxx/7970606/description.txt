"Dim Dam Dom Variétés" (1967-1968) was a music program, which was produced in addition to main "Dim Dam Dom" program (1965-1971), that was based on art, mode, cinema etc. Both were originally broadcasted by ORTF (Office national de radiodiffusion télévision française) on 2nd channel. 

This is my own compilation, that I made for another tracker. 
Videos taken mostly from repeat broadcasts on "Melody" channel and few from unknown source. The audio/video quality is not perfect for digital tv capture, but quite good.

This torrent has been BANNED on 1)rutracker, 2)dime and 3)TTD, so I post it here.
