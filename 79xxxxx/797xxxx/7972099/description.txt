COURSE DESCRIPTION
A warrior embarks on an ocean voyage to retrieve a mysterious fleece and prove his worth. A young man catches the spinning sun with a lasso to slow it down and lengthen the day. A giant boar raises the earth from beneath the sea with its enormous tusks. These are just a few of the thousands of myths belonging to cultures from around the world. They are tales of powerful gods and goddesses, of fearless heroes facing down frightening monsters, of ingenious tricks and epic battles.
But these powerful stories do more than just widen our eyes, catch our breaths, and stretch our imaginations. They are the keys to truly grasping the ways that principles, rituals, codes, and taboos are woven into the fabric of a particular society or civilization. It's through myths that we can answer these and other fundamental questions:

How was the universe created, and why?
What is the purpose of evil in the world?
Why is human society organized the way it is?
How did natural features like rivers, mountains, and oceans emerge?
