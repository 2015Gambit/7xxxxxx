Plogue ARIA Engine v1.6.2.2







Plogue is proud to announce the release of its new and free sample player that is highly SFZ 2.0 compliant. Advanced musicians and hobbyists now have a free and powerful tool to experiment and share instruments without relying on a proprietary format.
sforzando has only one slot, no fancy UI, effects or mixers. So everything needs to be done at the SFZ text file level, no cheating. sforzando is also a name given for a sudden change in music dynamics which is represented by the ΓÇ£sfzΓÇ¥ symbol.

The SFZ Format is widely accepted as THE open standard to define musical instrument from a bare set of sound recordings. Being a royalty-free format, any developer can create, use and distribute SFZ files and players for either free or commercial purposes.

So when looking for flexibility and portability, SFZ is the obvious option. ThatΓÇÖs why its the default instrument file format used in the ARIA Engine.



System Compatibility

ARIA is fully compatible with 32bits and 64bits architectures on PC.
It can be used as a standalone application or as a VST or RTAS plugin.
