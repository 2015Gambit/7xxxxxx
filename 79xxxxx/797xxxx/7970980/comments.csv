,mikeos2,2012-12-30T11:10Z,Why not upload Pulcinella? This is a great suite.
,JoJoBAH,2012-12-30T17:16Z,I agree with mike0s2. Why not upload the entire CD?
,bbw231,2012-12-31T02:56Z,"I might do that!
I've ripped a few more ""Rite's"" from other labels I planned to upload first.

If you don't get 100% complete, it actually is complete never the less. 
All the music is like it should it's just a couple of txt files with tracklist etc. that I unfortunately edited in between making the torrent and uploading it. "
