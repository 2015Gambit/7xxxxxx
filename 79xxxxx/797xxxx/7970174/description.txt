  Following an epically tumultuous career that included multiple changes in lead singers and ended with a breakup in 2006, Christian emo institution Further Seems Forever return with Penny Black, their first recorded output since reuniting in 2010. Not only is the band back from the dead, but they return in their original lineup, featuring lead vocalist Chris Carrabba, who left the band in 2001 to focus on his wildly successful solo project Dashboard Confessional, as well as guitarist Nick Dominguez, who left in 2001 as well. The re-formed project maintained their powerful sound rooted in melodic punk but smoothed out with a pop approach to aggressive sounds and sentiments. Carrabba's vocals stayed very much in the spotlight, especially on tracks like the first single and video "So Cold."
