Dasvidaniya is a 2008 Bollywood film released on 7 November 2008. The name of the movie is a pun on the list of ten things to be done before death made by Vinay Pathak, and is derived from the Russian phrase (dasvidaniya), meaning good bye. Shy Amar Kaul, played by Vinay Pathak, lives a nondescript life with people oblivious to his existence. One day his doctor tells him that he will die within three months. Realising that his time is limited, Amar makes a list of things he wants to do during his life, and sets out to do them.
