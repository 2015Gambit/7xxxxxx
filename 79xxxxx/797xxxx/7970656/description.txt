In 1961, a few years after his triumph with West Side Story, director-choreographer Jerome Robbins put together an evening of his dances for Broadway under the title Ballets U.S.A. One of the pieces was NY Export, Op. Jazz, with jazz score by Robert Prince. This recording couples that score with dance music from West Side Story. It's the same suite that has much recorded, but with a twist. The small orchestra, mainly a jazz combo, plays with enormous energy, and the drum solos are brilliant. This is a digitalization of a 4-track Warner Bros. open reel tape from the period and the sound is very good.
