The Software ISO is mostly in spanish but you can use Google Translator
to change it to english. Restart Your Computer and Hold F-12. Go to the
Boot Options and select CD and DVD Drive to Load the Disc. It may take a
few hours but a Program Called "Wifite 2" might be able to decrypt a
secure wi-fi connection and give you the security key in order to use
the wi-fi for "free" and not have to pay a monthly bill. I Haven't paid
a bill for the internet in over 6 months and It's a fast connection. 

there's several options on the disc but it will only take you only as
far as you already knowing how to use the program(s).  there may be
tutorials on how to use the other programs.
