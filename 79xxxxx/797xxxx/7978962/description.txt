Hay! WolfWP here, I forgot my password, and I have way to many email accounts. But I did manage to get onto this old account that I never used, so whatever. (PS: This site also cut me off wile I was trying to upload this the first time.)

Anyway, it's time for a LONG overdue revision of the old My Little Pony Friendship is Magic Music Soundtrack. So I have added way more music and reorganized it a bit.

Files : mlp_fim_music_soundtrack_(20_percent_cooler_edtion).rar

Size : 2.75GB (2.82GB After file extraction)

Music format : .mp3

I'm not putting all the artist names any more, but some of the most notable ones are:
[voodoopony], ArtAttack, Chain Algorithm, MandoPony, Not A Clever Pony, Omnipony, RainbowCrash88, Twitch, and many others.

Instructions :
1. Download the torrent using a BitTorrent client like uTorrent.
2. Extract the .rar file using an archiver like 7Zip or WinRAR.
3. Enjoy the 20% more derp.

Notes : 
Again, it's all Audiosurf ready. Please note though that this album is INCOMPLETE, the only reason I'm even uploading this is because it's at least 20% better than the old, super outdated version that's floating around. So expect updates. Also, HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!

Once again, I do hope you all have fun with this.
