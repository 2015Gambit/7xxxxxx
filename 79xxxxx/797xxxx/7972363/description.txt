Leaf Hound was formed from the ashes of Black Cat Bones who added Keith Young on drums and continued on under a new name in 1971. Other members included vocalist Peter French, guitarist Mick Halls, and the Brooks brothers Derek and Stu on guitar and bass respectively. The band's only album contained an acid guitar based psychedelic sludgefest of blues based rock. The band sounded like a raw combination of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.

It is worth noting that vocalist Peter French was later a member of progressive rockers Atomic Rooster, the power boogie band Cactus and the German band Randy Pie. He also unsuccessfully auditioned for Deep Purple after Ian Gillan left the band but David Coverdale was hired instead. This is a highly recommended reissue of powerhouse psychedelic blues based British rock.
