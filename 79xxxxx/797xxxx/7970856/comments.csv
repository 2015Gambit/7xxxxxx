Five minutes into the first lecture, and you have no idea why he is talking about the things he's talking about.  It jumps around like a stream of consciousness, despite the fact that he is clearly consulting his notes. And then, after about 15 minutes, he starts to put long pauses in between every sentence, like he's running out of steam.

It is material like this that makes me appreciate the quality of other lecturers the Teaching Company features.

(No complaint is directed at the uploader, though. I am glad for the opportunity to listen to this. Thanks.)"
