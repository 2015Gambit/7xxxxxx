Lazy f*ckers shouldn't be uploading! Didn't even include a version number."
,bjornagainswede,2012-12-30T10:07Z,"Indeed... what version even??? 

I have 2.3.1 and even that doesn't work properly on ML... only Screenflow or Screenium are any use at all!

Wouldn't bother my A with this! Buggered White Box!"
