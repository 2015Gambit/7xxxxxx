By now you all have probably heard about G4 ending and re-branding meaning the cancellations of Attack of the Show and X-Play. If not, here is the article:

It sucks that these 2 awesome shows are ending. But at least we will have the memories or will we? I believe that all of the great footage from AOTS & X-Play that is available at G4tv.com, on Youtube, & wherever else will probably be taken away when the new network comes. So we will lose all of that great footage unless we do something. That is why I am hoping to archive AOTS, X-Play, & G4 with this: The G4 Lives Project. What I am hoping to do is to keep G4's Legacy alive just like those who did the same with TechTV before me. 

Some Important Notes:


1. The Goal is to post as many AOTS & X-Play in packs. Either by segment, host, etc.


2. The quality of the videos will vary. I am getting the best version for each vid (in HD when available).


3. The sizes of the torrents for this project will vary as well. Some will be small & others will be BIG!


4. We are going to need help on this project. We can NOT do this all on are own(Only 2 people as of this writing). There are thousands & thousands of videos to get from G4tv.com & elsewhere for AOTS, X-Play, & G4. So we are looking for volunteers to help us. If you are interested, let me know in the comments. So then we can coordinate about what you can do. Please guys I need help if this project is going to be successful. So please help out.
