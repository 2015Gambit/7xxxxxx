,desiemmett,2013-01-01T16:02Z,"Installed just fine on Snow Leopard (10.6.8)
A few glitches, however.
I could only get the sound to function with Logic open. Not running it through Logic, just had Logic open.Weird.
It also didn't detect my M-Audio USB keyboard.
FL Studio on a PC doesn't have a problem (and ""yes"" I know all about setting midi preferences).
As far as there being no FL Studio on the Mac- they did do some Mac beta testing with FL Studio 9  so I assume this is where this came from.
There are other issues such as the text being nearly unreadable in the various preference windows- the drop down menus are clear however.
All of this begs the question of why anyone would waste their time with a hack program like Fruity Loops anyway? The convoluted recording path is irritating and the instruments and sounds they produce are worse than children's toys.
(Why do I bother? It's my job to know these things so I have to go through all of this.)
For me- this is a curiosity and nothing more.
FL Studio, whether on it's native PC or ported to the Mac environment, is still dreadful.
Happy New Year to all at TPB!"
