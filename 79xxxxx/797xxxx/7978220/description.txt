The One Thing is an album by Michael Bolton, released on November 16, 1993. Although this album contained the hit Said I Loved You...But I Lied, which reached no.6 in the U.S., it did not match the sales of his previous two albums and was an early sign of his faltering chart success after 1993. Nevertheless, the album was a respectable hit on its own going 3xPlatinum in the US only and selling approximatelly 6 million copies worldwide. (wikipedia)
