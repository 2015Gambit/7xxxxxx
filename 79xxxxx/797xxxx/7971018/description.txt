For centuries alchemists have tried to turn base metals into gold. But is such 
a feat even possible? 

In the final Christmas Lecture, Dr Peter Wothers explores the elements within 
the earth and discovers just how difficult it is for chemists to extract the 
planet's greatest treasures. He discovers how our knowledge of the elements can 
allow us to levitate, turn carbon dioxide into diamonds and maybe turn lead 
into gold. 

Peter is joined by Nobel Prize-winning chemist Professor Sir Harry Kroto and 
together they find out whether a member of the audience is really worth their 
weight in gold and what happens when you set fire to a diamond.
