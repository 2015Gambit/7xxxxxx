,greetz02,2012-12-31T01:18Z,yea. yuizaki posted his subtitle file there as well but i worked on it a bit more so it was similar to some of the official translation for the english manga. plus there were some parts which none of the guys @ asiatorrents translated which i did as well
,greetz02,2012-12-31T01:19Z,its definitely one of the best live action adaptation done so far
,hboi,2012-12-31T09:10Z,how's the A/V quality? I just started downloading.
