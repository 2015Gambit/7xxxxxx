Academy Award-winning filmmaker and former private detective Errol Morris examines the nature of evidence and proof in the infamous Jeffrey MacDonald murder case

Early on the morning of February 17, 1970, in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Jeffrey MacDonald, a Green Beret doctor, called the police for help.  When the officers arrived at his home they found the bloody and battered bodies of MacDonaldΓÇÖs pregnant wife and two young daughters. The word ΓÇ£pigΓÇ¥ was written in blood on the headboard in the master bedroom. As MacDonald was being loaded into the ambulance, he accused a band of drug-crazed hippies of the crime.

So began one of the most notorious and mysterious murder cases of the twentieth century. Jeffrey MacDonald was finally convicted in 1979 and remains in prison today. Since then a number of bestselling booksΓÇöincluding Joe McGinnissΓÇÖs Fatal Vision and Janet MalcolmΓÇÖs The Journalist and the MurdererΓÇöand a blockbuster television miniseries have told their versions of the MacDonald case and what it all means.
