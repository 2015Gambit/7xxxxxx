Thanks allot for all your great uploads!  I really apprecite the work that you, as well as several other skulls, put into getting good movies up on the bay.  If you can, I know allot of people will appreciate it,  i'd love to get an upload of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Django Unchained"".  I know you're probably already working on it. I just thought i'd mention it anyway.  But thanks for your efforts and I look foward to anything  you can get to us in the future.

For anyone wondering, this is a great copy of Lincoln.  Personally I give it a 10 all the way across.  Picture and sound quality, as well as the movie itself. Highly recommended.  Any uploads from .Bone. are legit."
