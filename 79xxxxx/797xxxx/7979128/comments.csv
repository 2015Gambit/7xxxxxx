 bad you moderator delete my torrent on The Hobbit Blu-ray 720p.
It does NOT have these blurs any other uploads.
Size of the movie is 9.11 GB. Has worked hard on it so you delete it.
All other Hobbit on piratebay is of poor quality.
I work at a Swedish cinema and have access to matrial.
Only I have it in swesub,"
