Fans of disaster-from-space movies such as Deep Impact or Armageddon, or of science-fiction novels like LuciferΓÇÖs Hammer, will definitely want to check out this lively yet also rather scary book by a noted astronomer and creator of the clever Web site badastronomy.com. The book is basically a catalogue of astronomical catastrophes that could wipe out life on earth: asteroids, comets, supernovae, black holes, aliens, even our friendly sun. According to Plait, it is virtually inevitable that something will happen, perhaps not in the not-so-distant future, to kill us allΓÇödonΓÇÖt forget, itΓÇÖs already happened once, 65 million years ago (remember the dinosaurs?), and there have been several recent near misses. The thing to do is stop worrying about inevitabilities and start planning for them: find ways, for example, to turn asteroids off course before they hit us. The book is extremely informative: Plait explains not only what can destroy the planet but also how it would happen. ItΓÇÖs a crash course in astronomy as well as a cautionary tale about the (possibly brief) future of our world
