           Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships 

In Social Intelligence, Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world. Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a ΓÇ£neural balletΓÇ¥ that connects us brain to brain with those around us.

Our reactions to others, and theirs to us, have a far-reaching biological impact, sending out cascades of hormones that regulate everything from our hearts to our immune systems, making good relationships act like vitaminsΓÇöand bad relationships like poisons. We can ΓÇ£catchΓÇ¥ other peopleΓÇÖs emotions the way we catch a cold, and the consequences of isolation or relentless social stress can be life-shortening. Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the ΓÇ£dark sideΓÇ¥ of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for ΓÇ£mindsight,ΓÇ¥ as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired.
