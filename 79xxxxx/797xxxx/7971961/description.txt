Prepare to become ensnared in the nightmare that has overwhelmed Hanyuda
the Japanese village which now finds itself awash with evil
and encircled by a sea of blood. There was no warning, no explanation,
in the blink of an eye the village became a gruesome hell
on earth and almost all of its inhabitants met
with a fate that is surely worse than death...
Almost, but not all. There are few survivors, each now embroiled
in their own personal fight for survival. Immersed in a world of fear,
mystery and suspense these survivors begin a desperate search for a way
out and only through their eyes, as they evade the vile creatures that
yesterday were their friends and neighbours, will we begin to understand
the macabre recent events.
