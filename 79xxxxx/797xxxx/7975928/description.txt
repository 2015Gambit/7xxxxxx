Last night Comedy Central Africa premiered their first ever South African Roast when 'Roastee' actor, musician, talk show host, activist and poet, Steve Hofmeyr took the hot seat in a custom Weber-made chair on National Braai Day at The Lyric Theatre.

Based on the US Comedy Central Roast-blue print, Hofmeyr's career and personal life was ridiculed and mocked in the name of comedy by a panel of celebrity 'Roasters' in front of a live studio audience.

The celebrity 'Roasters' included Robert Whitehead who plays Barker Heyns in Isidingo, journalist and Headlines entertainment reporter Kuli Roberts, model Minki van der Westhuizen, actress Shaleen Surtie-Richards, radio personality Anele Mdoda and comedians John Vlismas, Casper de Vries and David Kau. Comedian Trevor Noah acted as 'Roastmaster' of ceremonies.
