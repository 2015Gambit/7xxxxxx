,humantorchid,2013-01-05T19:06Z,"Hey, Raymond, I was Wondering How long Or What it Takes to get the Green Skull On TPB? After How Long Did You Get Them?"
[V],rr-ne,2013-01-07T07:34Z,"Well, i was a big uploader of all sorts of movies when i first started on TPB, i did more than just Simpsons episodes. but i don't anymore due to the type of speed i have. Well first i had no skull, then i think a few months later i got the Trusted pink skull,  one day i signed into my account and happened to have a green skull. That was probably nearly a year of uploading good stuff.

im not really sure how long it was, but thats all i can remember.
