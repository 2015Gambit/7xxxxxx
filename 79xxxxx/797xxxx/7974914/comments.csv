,666s,2013-01-02T04:48Z,"thanks guys, 16;9 ac3, very happy"
,Bofu,2013-01-02T12:41Z,720 x 480 is NOT 720P... Get your shit right.
[V],NLUPPER002,2013-01-02T15:14Z,"@Bofu

U better take some shit out your eyes and read the info that is available. 
720pSCR2DVD
Source: SKYFALL 2012 SCR 720p X264 AC3 5.1 Legend-Rg

So the source is converted 2DVD.
So first go to an optician, before u write some shit. "
,Bofu,2013-01-02T17:08Z,"Ugh, there's no shit in my eyes, only your delusional head... Every other normal person lists 720P as a rip encoded at 1280  x 720 etc... So don't get technical by saying the SOURCE is that of 720, when your finished product is only 480P... How the fuck do retards get VIP?"
,Bofu,2013-01-02T17:20Z,"nobody gives a fuck about the source, they care solely about the quality and the output clearly listed as 720 x 480... Not our problem you're fucking stupid and that you can't encode for shit."
,away001,2013-01-02T17:42Z,"@ Bofu

I searched for your releases in order to evaluate them. Guess what, I didn't find any! 
It's easy to criticize others, if you don't do shit yourself.
So shut the fuck up!!"
,johnsmith25,2013-01-02T20:15Z,"@Bofu - Is that short for BoyFucking? Who are you pissant to come on here and tell us what's up? Where's your work homo? NLUPPER is the shit. Have you looked at some of his stuff? Most of the stuff he's got out well before it's released. His shot of Skyfall is probably the best out there for the time being and that's saying something considering the movie we're talking about. They need to add a feature for posters to block leeching, know-nothing asshats like yourself."
,Up_Yours_,2013-01-02T21:32Z,"This is definitely mislabeled, and it appears to be done on purpose to mislead and dupe downloaders. 

Thanks though NLUPPER002, we can always count on your re-encodes to the DVD format, which nobody uses anymore."
,EstebanLB,2013-01-03T09:06Z,This torrent is mislabelled indeed
,sm1ff,2013-01-07T03:22Z,"misled hell yeah, if its ts with a 720p cam, say its ts insted! we want proper lables! fuck you"
,cubstudios,2013-01-10T13:29Z,"As usual, its a crappy cam pretending to be DVD quality. Don't waste your time with this one."
,jagered,2013-01-10T19:24Z,"@NLUPPER

""720p is a progressive HDTV signal format with 720 horizontal lines and an aspect ratio (AR) of 16:9 (1.78:1). All major HDTV broadcasting standards include a 720p format which has a resolution of 1280Ă&#x2014;720""

so sorry, but you are incorrect.  i agree with most on here that although you may have a few worth while torrents, most wind up being re-packs/cams/crap... "
