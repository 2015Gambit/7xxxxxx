MisterMusic Show - 2 hours  192kbps- episode 234.

I start off the first hour with the usual music mix of indie and alternative music 
mixed with classic hits from the past, and feature The Top 10 Albums of 2012 in my second hour.

The 'Oldie of the Week' is a huge international hit that scored the number 1
modern rock chart position for 4 weeks in January 1992.

You can find more details about the Top 10 of 2012 on the music website (podcloud1.com) and hear the songs in a mix with no dj interruption there.
