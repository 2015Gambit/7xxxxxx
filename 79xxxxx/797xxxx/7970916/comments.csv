Do you know how to enable Advanced Inventory features in Enterprise 2013? There is a button at the bottom left of the main window that says ""Turn on Advanced Inventory"" which transports to a web browser giving a phone number to activate the feature.

I understand that Intuit changes a setting on their end and then the user has to select ""Sync license data online"" from the Help menu. Can we somehow patch this check to return result of Advanced Inventory enabled? "

,love404,2012-12-30T05:46Z,"Hi dechronic,

I tried that multiple times with no success, does that procedure work for you?

I am doing this on the UK version of Enterprise 2013 with non-trial product code. Maybe it's different? I can successfully register the product with the activator though!

Since the Advance Inventory feature is a subscription based feature ($699/year) I don't see how the patch in the would enable this- I think a different part of EntitlementClient needs to be patched.."

Please share product code for QB2013 UK Enterprise. On 27/12/2012, you posted a request on PBay for this code as you did not have it. In your post to dechronic on 30/12/2012, you indicate that you have it. Please share it with PBay community or are you one of those who just wants (a leecher) and is not prepared to share."

Enjoy"
,love404,2012-12-30T07:55Z,"@ganie1608 Can you try enabling Advanced Inventory on your version, are you able to follow jawaidali's instructions successfully?"
,ganie1608,2012-12-30T08:49Z,"@love404

Thanks for the product code. Can you please confirm this code as it is just not working for me. I was able to register the trial version and activate advanced inventory but I need the correct product code for QB2013 uk enterprise in order to test."
,love404,2012-12-30T09:01Z,"@ganie1608

It's definitely working on UK Ent 2013. In your trial version, go to the help menu, select buy Quickbooks. Enter:

1063-0575-1585-222
346-856

If it's not working, make sure you have updated to the latest R4 update and try again."
,love404,2012-12-30T09:12Z,Advanced inventory will be disabled when you switch from the trial to the full version..
,jzelaya,2012-12-30T16:47Z,@dechronic v0.13 is still doing the same thing for me. It shuts off immediately after trying to close running processes. I can give you the teamviewer and password to that PC so that you can take a look at it yourself.
