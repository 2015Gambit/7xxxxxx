================
"Sugar Street", the climactic conclusion to Mafhouz's masterpiece trilogy, 
is the captivating portrait of a family struggling to change with the 
rise of modern Egypt. As Cairo shrugs off the final vestiges of colonialism, 
Ahmad Al Jawad has lost his power and surveys the world from a latticed 
balcony. Unable to control his family's destiny, he watches helplessly 
as his dynasty and the traditions he holds dear disintegrate before 
his eyes. But through Ahamd's three grandsons we see modern how Egypt 
takes shape. One grandson is a communist activist, another a Muslim 
fundamentalist, both working for what they believe will be a better 
world. And Ridwan, the inheritor of his father's charms, launches a 
political career aided by a homosexual affair with prominent politician.
