The broadcaster explores the Galapagos, a
collection of volcanic islands in the Pacific
known for its extraordinary wildlife. More than
150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his
ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote
archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on
the islands has continued to evolve in biological
isolation, examining how the ever-changing
volcanic landscape has given birth to species
and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the
world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose
from the ocean four million years ago

Enjoy!
