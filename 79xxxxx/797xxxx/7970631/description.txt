Betrayed With A Kiss by Eric Ludy:
WARNING: This message pulls no punches. It speaks straightforwardly on a topic that most of us would rather avoid - and that is, wolves in sheep's clothing in the modern church. There are wolves in the sheep pen of modern Christianity undermining the timeless, eternal Truths of Scripture and thus altering the nature and the pattern of the Gospel. But these wolves don't look like wolves. For they are wearing very convincing sheep costumes.

Hell-Shaking Prayer by David Wilkerson:
remember one thing when learning about the new world order (for those who are newly woken up to who the are and what hey are really all about ) you must keep in mind that there is a spiritual side that exists that is just as real that we can't see .

Prophetic Proof / For Every Truth by Philip Sizemore:
We know true prophets existed in the Bible -- all of whom were rejected in their day. Such was the case for Noah, Moses, Jeremiah, Daniel, and John the Baptist. Did God raise up another prophet in our day, and if so, who is this person, and what is the message? (73 minutes)

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.



May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.
