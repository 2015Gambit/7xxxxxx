2D MP4 would be perfect!
Thanks any way."

,cry515,2012-12-31T23:52Z,Gonna DL this and have a look. Wondering though what's the go with playing Red/Blue 3d using Nvidia 3D vision?
,raiblast,2013-01-04T04:12Z,"How would you watch this? My media players just shows the video as 2 frames, side-by-side in sync. The only method I know to view this (uncross your eyes) is not sufficient due to the side of the frames, unless it was a really small screen. Is there a codec or a program used to cause the 3d effect?"
,sharpshot94549,2013-01-04T08:49Z,"@ Raiblast
If you are planning on playing this on a TV, don't worry about it, the TV will take care of it for you. If you want to play it on your computer, i recommend using www=3dtv=at (replace = with .) to play it, buy really i would recommend downloading a better release, as YIFY releases are good for putting on mobile devices, I can't in good consciousnesses recommend their releases for watching on a TV, to many artifacts on dark scenes (which this movie has a lot of) and the lack of decent audio baffles me."
,DaBoogieman3317,2013-01-05T23:12Z,"someone commented on the other torrent its not 3d, and what does he throw up? the real deal. i know cuz someone said they seeing double. my led auto recognizes it and i push ok. 3 cheers for yify. no homo"
