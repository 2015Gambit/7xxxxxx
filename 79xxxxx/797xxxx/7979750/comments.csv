,darkkrisse81,2013-01-03T15:47Z,seems you can't play this on a device with cinavia on it. 
,randombits1,2013-01-03T20:01Z,Frame rate is messed up..  glitchy.  Just like the Hive-CM8 release.
,Sontiago2000,2013-01-04T03:11Z,Yes frame rate is bad but it's slightly better then a cam.
,opoder,2013-01-05T15:46Z,"Good quality like other releases. Because ALL got from the same souce. Where texts warning ""unauthorized copying"" received a blur effect to hide. However, I believe that others think like me: I prefer the unauthorized copying of text (original).

Anyway, THANK YOU for sharing."
,opoder,2013-01-05T15:55Z,"I just need to know one things: This release was re-encoded? Or just copy without re-encod video and audio?
Tnx for answering."
