Information
------------------------------

Two statues, a temple, a hanging garden, two tombs and a lighthouse. This selection of monuments became known as "The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World". There are probably few who could list them right away, are even fewer who know something about each of them or the reasons for which they were labeled as Wonders. Six of those seven were destroyed by forces of nature, or by human hand. Each episode in this series describes one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and we see besides the monuments themselves the people who designed and built them, with the vision to create something wonderful. 


Journey back to the ancient world to discover it's man-made Wonders. Each wonder is recreated with computer animation, and your host, author and archaeologist, John Romer examines the historical background of these ancient monuments and the civilisations to which they belonged.



2)  The Magic Metropolis 
In this episode, John Romer explores the history of the Lighthouse of Alexandria and the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. Of the seven wonders of the world most practical was the Lighthouse of Alexandria. Built in 285 BC, the lighthouse can be seen from 50 km at sea and to show the way to the old town Nepal. From medieval legends we hear magic light attacking and burning sails of the ships . Lighthouse of Alexandria was more than an indicator to ancient ships, it symbolized one of the most spectacular experiments of mankind and birth of the modern city and Magic Metropolis.
In today's Bodrum (ancient city Halicarnassus), Romer visits the initial site where once was the largest tomb the world has ever seen, the tomb of King Mausolus or Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. The term Mausoleum (large funeral tomb) comes after the name of King Mausol.
