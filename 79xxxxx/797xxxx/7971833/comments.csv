,Mr_Heisenberg,2012-12-31T03:52Z,"^Its a dvd screener so its obviously not as good as a blu ray rip but its not bad at all. If you want a perfect copy then you should wait a couple weeks. I'm going to wait for a 1080p rip but i downloaded to check the quality out, definitely watchable if you dont care about hd or 5.1 sound"
