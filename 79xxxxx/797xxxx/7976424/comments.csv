Second - Why is your .zip smaller than the original file, which is also a .zip form where you get it? Sphax x128 File for 1.4.5/6 has round about 20mb from original source.

Either you have 'repacked' it, what doesn't even make sense, or this is not the original version.
Also - TexturePacks going into /.minecraft/texturepacks as .zip - there is no need to extract them like you say in your description."

,Warfalcon,2013-01-01T05:04Z,That never was the point! When you download the original source you already get it as .zip that have ~20mb and for using/installing it you don't even need to extract it. So why does this file differs from the original one? That's what I'm asking for. I could it answer if there were seeds to get the file...
