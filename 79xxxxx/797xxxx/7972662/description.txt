JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES BELIEFS AND HOW DOES THEIR FALSEHOOD ARE CANCELLED. 

THIS BOOK IS AVAILABLE FOR PRINTING IN ANY COUNTRY, BY ANY PERSON, METROPOLIS,OR PATRIARCHATE WITH THE ONLY LIMITATION NOT TO  BE CHANGED THE MEANINGS ON IT.
===========================================================
FOREWORD
This booklet is written in the simple language of our people and aims to expose the fallacies of Jehovah's Witnesses,and demonstrates how do they distorting the Bible. 
Within this booklet,it contains the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses,which are taken from their books, and passages of the Holy Scripture, the rock upon which crushed all heretics to prove how mistaken or how they want to wander and to plan. 

The Watchtower encourages them not to read the Bible because they do not understand it, but to read the Watchtower, that is another gospel, which is more easily understand. 
But,in Galatians a:8, we read "But even if we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed".
I hope this book can become a reason to know better the truth of our Orthodox faith and become another weapon in the arsenal of the Orthodox Church for the glory of God. 
Amen.

Anti-prologue 
"But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good" (Rom. 2.10)
 God and His Church honors and glorifies all the good workers, according to these words of the Scripture. 
 As a spiritual father,I congratulate my dear Mr. Apostolos Xepapadakis because,although he is a simple toiler, without the necessary circulars and theological education, but only with divine zeal, did this remarkable Sect study a valuable tool in the hands of every Orthodox Christian 
who wants to shake and to enlighten our brethren who they are deceived in Jehovah's Witnesses.

 May God bless this effort to bear fruit a hundredfold.With paternal prayersArchimandrite Amfilohios Tsoukos

Few preliminary
The presence in our days of chiliasts,or Jehovah's Witnesses and so many other heretical sects and offshoots shows the measure of the current human apostasy from God, who is the Truth (John 14:6). 
The main reason of heresy is pride. "As Lucifer fell by pride and,from an angel of light became angel of darkness, because he wanted to go up higher than God, so every heretic with pride, wants to put his will over the will of the Church and its teachings with over the teaching of the Holy Fathers basing of his alleged fallacies in the Bible which, because of his pride,he cannot understand properly, because he lacks of the grace of God, and thus distorts and sinks himself, 
and those who follow the precipices of heresy in the words of Scripture

 "Can one blind person lead another? WonΓÇÖt they both fall into a ditch?" (Luke 6.39).
 The truth which the Church believes is an indivisible whole.
 It is the complete.
From this complete the heretics extracts some suggestions and trying this partial to heighten in the "universal".
Their half-truth, thus becomes one big lie, since turning against the complete truth. 
F.e. the sentence:"Jesus Christ is man" is correct, but it becomes a lie when it is made:
 "Jesus Christ is only a man,because now it is turned against the truth that Jesus Christ is God and man.
"So,anyone who hates lies should hate heresies too. And anyone who loves truth should be faithful and conscientious member of the Church in which salvation is only by the Orthodox doctrine and grace of the Holy Mysteries.
