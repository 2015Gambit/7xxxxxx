If we are to be honest: Pagan christianity, all sects included, and its fictional Jesus character [whether he´s portrayed as golfer, gopher or Goofy] is a falsehood."

================
Helmer2 and BaggerX,of course youre not Christians,or you dont have any idea about Christianity. pagan? pagan in what?
there,in the west that you live,you propably have lost the meanings of the Holy Scriptures. 
you dare to compare the Ancient Christianity,with cults that raised like mushrooms 1850 years after the Crucifixion! 
PEOPLE BECAME ''CATHOLIC'' BECAUSE THEY NEVER HAVE MET ORTHODOXY...  SCHISMA IS A  (GREEK WORD).AT 809 FIRST,FRANKS PUT FILIOQUE,AND CHANCE THE SYMBOL OF GAITH.THEN,1054 BECAME TOTALLY SCHISMA,AND THE WESTERN TOOK ANOTHER WAY FROM THE ANCIENT CHURCH. ''CATHOLIC'' IS THE ORTHODOX CHURCH,-THE ONE,HOLY,CATHOLIC AND APOSTOLIC CHURCH. THE PAPISTS USE THIS GREEK WORD FALSE. TAKE A LOOK IF YOU WANT: http://oodegr.com/english/papismos/papismos.htm THEN,BECAME PROTESTANTISM,AND 22000 HERESIES-ALL FROM THE WEST . WHAT A PITTY!

Christrian﻿ Orthodoxy is the true faith that is why we survived for over 2000 years from so many enemies; turks, the venetians, the huns. Our faith is powerful through the works. One of our saints Kosmas aitolos prophesied over 250 years ago how the world would be today. And he wrote it in a book. To name a few of his prophesies; television, internet, wars in the balkans. Look him up. Who knows you might learn a thing or two.

GOD HIMSELF SHOWED US,THROUGH HIS MIRACLES,AS WE SAW IN THE CASE OF THE HUMBLE ELDER,THAT THROUGH  HUMILITY,PEOPLE CAN ACHIEVE THEOSIS.
GOD SHOWED US THE TRUTH EVEN,THROUGH HIS MIRACLES,ABOUT THE REAL FAITH,AS WE CAN SEE THE HOLY LIGHT,THAT IS GIVEN ONLY TO ORTHODOX,FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

ALSO,EVERY YEAR,AT THE FEAST OF THE HOLY THEOFANY,THE WATER IN THE JORDAN RIVER TURNING TOWARDS! 
WE ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SALVATION OF OUR SOUL."
