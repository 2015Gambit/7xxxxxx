Editorial Reviews
All Music Guide - Mark Deming
As strong as Martha Wainwright's self-titled debut album was, her second 
full-length effort, I Know You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too, feels like a 
dazzling surprise, surpassing the first record in artistry and ambition and 
offering an even more striking picture of her talents. Wainwright's 
songwriting is every bit as strong on this collection as on her first album (no 
small achievement), and her skill at defining a character in words is impressive 
indeed, with uneven relationships dominating but not entirely defining the 
many people Wainwright brings to life here. As a singer, she's gone from 
strength to strength on I Know You're Married; sounding like some remarkable 
fusion of Kate Bush, Patti Smith, and Kate McGarrigle (the latter happens to 
be her mom), Wainwright has learned how to draw out the drama from songs 
like "Comin' Tonight," "Bleeding All Over You," and "The George Song," though 
she's intelligent enough to do so without sinking into melodrama. And while 
several different producers worked on this album (most notably Brad Alberta 
and Martin Terefe), the results have a rich, unified sound and feeling, with 
Wainwright's powerhouse vocals luring the spotlight from a talented team of 
studio collaborators (including Pete Townshend, Donald Fagen, Garth 
Hudson, and Martha's brother Rufus) and meshing with arrangements that 
gracefully go from the spare to the grandiose. While much has been made of 
Martha Wainwright's place in a family of very talented musicians, I Know 
You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too is the work of a singer and 
songwriter who stands in no one's shadow and has fashioned a striking voice 
of her own, and that voice is in full and fascinating flight here.
