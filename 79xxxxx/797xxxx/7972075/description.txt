Americans are living in an Orwellian state argue Academy Award-winning director Oliver Stone and historian Peter Kuznick, as they sit down with RT to discuss US foreign policy and the Obama administrationΓÇÖs disregard for the rule of law.

┬¡Both argue that Obama is a wolf in sheepΓÇÖs clothing and that people have forgiven him a lot because of the ΓÇ£nightmare of the Bush presidency that preceded him.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£He has taken all the Bush changes he basically put them into the establishment, he has codified them,ΓÇ¥ Stone told RT. ΓÇ£It is an Orwellian state. It might not be oppressive on the surface, but there is no place to hide. Some part of you is going to end up in the database somewhere.ΓÇ¥

Along with discussion of  Stone's 10-part series ΓÇ£Untold History of the United StatesΓÇ¥
