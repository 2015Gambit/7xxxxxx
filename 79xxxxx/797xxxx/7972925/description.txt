Epiphany follows Eli, a young boy in his first year of high school, through his life with his friends, his distant preacher father, and the Popularity Food Chain.

Oh, and there's also some subplot about duality, the major religion of this universe, and the two gods who created the world, and the fact that (spoiler) one may still be around.

A comic that takes its time, but nonetheless builds up to a very strong plot and offers a more realistic view of how a world of anthropomorphic animals would function and even come to be. Showcases a realistic set of characters with a subtle sense of humor mixed in with some bigger laugh-out-loud moments, with a very unique art style.

For the last chapter of epiphany (which is still ongoing) you can click the link included in the torrent or go straight to http://ianjay.net

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).
Then, you can use ".cbr files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!
