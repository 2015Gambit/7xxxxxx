I have grouped together the three student workbooks from the courses. The workbooks are scanned and are not mine, I got them from different sources.

RH124 and RH134 are in black & white. RH254 is in color.

Exact versions are:
RH124-RHEL6-EN-20110211
RH134-RHEL6-EN-20110131
RH254-RHEL6-EN-20110124

The current learning path would be as follows:
-Red Hat System Administration I (RH124)
-Red Hat System Administration II(RH134)
*Pass the EX200 exam
*You obtained  the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)
-Red Hat System Administration III (RH254)
*Pass the EX300 exam
*You become an Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)


If you have any other training material, or newer versions of these please upload them. I am uploading this only to encourage you to share your material too.

Don't forget to seed
