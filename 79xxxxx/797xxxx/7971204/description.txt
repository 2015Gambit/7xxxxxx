Key features

The features of Debenu PDF Maximus are listed below:
Split and Merge PDF files
Maximus provides two different approaches for merging PDF files and feature set of methods for extracting pages from a PDF file to separate files.

Headers, footers, images, dynamic text and watermarks
Insert permanent text, numbers and images anywhere on the page, including behind and in front of existing page content.

Convert Images to PDFs and PDF to Images
Each image is converted into its own PDF and then can be merge into one PDF using the Merge PDF action. Convert a regular PDF to an image. You can choose from all sorts such as BMP, TIFF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WMF and EMF.

Flatten Layers, Remove Annotations, Attachments, Bookmarks and JavaScript
Pretty much exactly what you think ΓÇª now you see ΓÇÿem, now you donΓÇÖt. Maximus allows you to rid your document of all its layers, annotations, attachments, bookmarks and JavaScripts. Ahh, that feels better.

Crop, Rotate, Delete, Extract and Insert Pages
Lots of fancy stuff here ΓÇô if you like to get your ΓÇ£handsΓÇ¥ dirty, you can do all sorts of things with pages ΓÇô crop and swap, rotate and replace. Great if youΓÇÖre dealing with documents that need new cover pages after theyΓÇÖve been split.

Extract Text, Images and Fonts from PDF files
Get the most value you can from your PDFs ΓÇô you can extract text in plain form, in plain and preserving layout, or with font data also. You can also extract all of the embedded images into their corresponding image format. In addition you can extract all of the TrueType fonts from a PDF.

Flatten PDF Forms and Extract Form Data
Extract all of the data stored in the form fields into a CSV file. Take the form fields and the contents fields and make them part of the document. After this process has been executed it will no longer be possible to enter in new values or change the content.

Edit Initial View Settings and Document Metadata
Setup the layout, magnification and viewer preferences for PDFs when they are opened in a conforming reader. Edit the standard document metadata such as the Title, Author, Subject and Keywords.

Watched Folders for Workflow Automation
Watched Folders are a collection of folders dedicated to automating your PDF workflow. They actively monitor new files and process silently in the background independently of the main Maximus application.

Easy Batch Processing
Process your actions on one file or on a whole collection of files with just a click on a mouse.

Write your own scripts using Debenu Quick PDF Library API
Built-in Maximus features are fantastic for performing most PDF-related tasks. You can write really easy scripts to do the rest. All based on our own Debenu Quick PDF Library API of course!
