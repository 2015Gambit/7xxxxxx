We are not responsible for subtitles / timecodes. We have changed a little delay for subtitles, so it fits better in audio. 

Those who have made subtitles for this movie have been busy and not thinking about timecodes. But we thank you anyway from Realuploads group.

If you want to change subs delay, use mkvmergeGUI program. for every 1 sec is 1000 ms


When Bond's latest assignment goes gravely wrong and agents around the world are exposed, MI6 is attacked forcing M to relocate the agency. These events cause her authority and position to be challenged by Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), the new Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee. With MI6 now compromised from both inside and out, M is left with one ally she can trust: Bond. 007 takes to the shadows - aided only by field agent, Eve (Naomie Harris) - following a trail to the mysterious Silva (Javier Bardem), whose lethal and hidden motives have yet to reveal themselves.

Ps. Some warnings appears in the movies, but we didnt blur them, because the movie would get through 3 converts then and loose quality.
