Mastering the Sony PMW-EX1/EX1R" is the easiest way to learn both the fundamentals and advanced features of the new Sony EX1 & EX1R camcorders and their state-of-the-art tapeless workflow.

This 3.5-hour, 3-disc (DVD video) workshop includes tutorials, step-by-step examples, and detailed instructions covering the most important aspects of camera setup, menus, shooting techniques, clip naming, file management, clip importing, picture profile settings, basic editing, and even archiving.

This DVD will pay for itself many times over by saving you hours of time figuring out things on your own. This is a completely independent production with no participation, sponsorship, input, or approval from Sony -- so it delivers unbiased information and professional advice that can't be found in the owner's manual.

This DVD workshop is designed to help anyone, from a novice to an experienced ENG/EFP shooter, get the best results from their EX1 or EX1R by providing real-world examples and techniques that are easy to put into practice.

Like all Vortex Media training DVDs, this workshop has been carefully researched, planned and scripted (not presented as"live" or ad lib).

This DVD was produced by professionals with years of broadcast-level experience who have the knowledge to recognize what's important about the EX1/EX1R and how to teach it without getting bogged down in jargon.
