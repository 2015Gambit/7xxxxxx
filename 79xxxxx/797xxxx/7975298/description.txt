POtHS Comments on This oneThese times are upon us now. Take Proper Precautions, put on your Spiritual Armour. Satan corrupted the Blood of The Human Race in an attempt to corrupt The Blood Line of Our Savior Jesus Christ. This would prove God a Liar making him Unholy. This would allow Satan to Raise Himself above the Heavens and The Stars.

Description:

Yahweh the Creator needs NO SPACESHIP or Mechanical device to do what He does. There are 2 types of inter-dimensional travelers. Yahweh, Jesus, The Holy Spirit obviously and the unfallen (HEAVENLY) angels that require nothing mechanical to dimension travel, however, The Fallen Angels seem to have lost some of their power and need artificial means to manipulate the different dimensions. EVERYTHING coming in a spaceship is of Satan not The Holy Yahweh.

Some believe the corruption of antediluvian DNA by Watchers was an effort to cut off the birth line of the Messiah. This theory posits that Satan understood the protoevangeliumΓÇöthe promise in Genesis 3:15 that a Savior would be born, the seed of the woman, and that He would destroy the fallen angelΓÇÖs power. SatanΓÇÖs followers therefore intermingled with the human race in a conspiracy to stop the birth of Christ. If human DNA could be universally corrupted or ΓÇ£demonized,ΓÇ¥ they reasoned, no Savior would be born and mankind would be lost forever. Those who support this theory believe this is why God ordered His people to maintain a pure bloodline and not to intermarry with the other nations. When Israel breached this command and the mutated DNA began rapidly spreading among men and animals, God instructed Noah to build an ark and to prepare for a flood that would destroy every living thing. That God had to send such a universal fiat like the Flood illustrates how widespread the altered DNA eventually became. In fact, the Bible says in Genesis 6:9 that only Noah, and by extension his children, were found ΓÇ£perfectΓÇ¥ in their generation. The Hebrew word for ΓÇ£perfectΓÇ¥ in this case is tamiym, which means ΓÇ£without blemishΓÇ¥ or ΓÇ£healthy,ΓÇ¥ the same word used in Leviticus to describe an unblemished, sacrificial lamb. The meaning was not that Noah was morally perfect, but that his physical makeupΓÇöhis DNAΓÇöhad not been contaminated with nephilim descent, as apparently the rest of the world had become. In order to preserve mankind as He had made them, God destroyed all but NoahΓÇÖs family in the Flood. The ancient records including those of the Bible appear to agree with this theology, consistently describing the cause of the Flood as happening in response to ΓÇ£all fleshΓÇ¥ having become ΓÇ£corrupted, both man and beast.ΓÇ¥

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


Seed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)

Ephesians 5:11

11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
