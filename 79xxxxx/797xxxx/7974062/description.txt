
Prepare for The Hypnotist to cast its spell
 
In the frigid clime of Tumba, Sweden, a gruesome triple homicide attracts the interest of Detective Inspector Joona Linna, who demands to investigate the murders. The killer is still at large, and thereΓÇÖs only one surviving witnessΓÇöthe boy whose family was killed before his eyes. Whoever committed the crimes wanted this boy to die: heΓÇÖs suffered more than one hundred knife wounds and lapsed into a state of shock. Desperate for information, Linna sees only one option: hypnotism. He enlists Dr. Erik Maria Bark to mesmerize the boy, hoping to discover the killer through his eyes.
 
ItΓÇÖs the sort of work that Bark has sworn he would never do againΓÇöethically dubious and psychically scarring. When he breaks his promise and hypnotizes the victim, a long and terrifying chain of events begins to unfurl.
 
An international sensation, The Hypnotist is set to appear in thirty-seven countries, and it has landed at the top of bestseller lists wherever itΓÇÖs been publishedΓÇöin France, Holland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Denmark. Now itΓÇÖs AmericaΓÇÖs turn. Combining the addictive power of the Stieg Larsson trilogy with the storytelling drive of The Silence of the Lambs, this adrenaline-drenched thriller is spellbinding from its very first page.
