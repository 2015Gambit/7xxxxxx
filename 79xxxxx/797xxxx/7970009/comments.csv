I'm not able to tell by some of the subs I saw where this was a cam  from and only watched the first 25 minutes or so but it's pretty distracting when you can constantly hear people talking and laughing at inappropriate times throughout.  Again, I do appreciate the up and I do realize it's free.  Just thought it was kinda weird, maybe a cultural difference, that people go to a movie and talk while watching a movie in theatre."

,SpaceCadet6969754,2013-01-01T15:45Z,Was this camed by arab sickos or something? They are talking loud and laughing the whole way through while kids are screaming from injuries? Good cam if wasn't for the retards talking the whole way through it it makes you want to punch your screen to shut them up.
