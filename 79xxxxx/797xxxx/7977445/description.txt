Peter Klaven&#x27;s world revolves around his real estate work and Zooey, his soon-to-be fianc&#xe9;e. After he pops the question, she calls her best friends and they go into wedding planning mode. Peter has no male friends and that poses problems: will he turn out to be a clingy guy, and who will be his best man? Zooey, her friends, and Peter&#x27;s brother Robbie offer help that results in awkward moments. Then, at an open house Peter&#x27;s hosting, he meets Sydney, an amiable, low-key guy. They trade business cards, and Peter calls him to meet for drinks. A friendship develops that&#x27;s great at first but then threatens Peter&#x27;s engagement and career. Can guys be friends and couples be in love?
