If you've seen Riverdance or a Chieftains video and think you might be interested in Celtic music but aren't quite sure where to start, this sampler is just what you've been looking for. Frankly, if you're a longtime aficionado of Celtic music and are looking for a solid collection of great music by the world's greatest Irish and Scots performers, this album is for you, too. It's compiled from various releases on the Green Linnet label and includes artists ranging in orientation from strictly traditional (the Tannahill Weavers, Mick Moloney) to the more progressive (Silly Wizard, Relativity) and thus reflects the wide stylistic spectrum of Celtic folk music as it is currently interpreted. The tunes range from standard-issue sets of jigs and reels to synthesizer-tinged modern folk songs, and there's enough variety to maintain the interest of just about anyone. Highlights include Silly Wizard's medley of "The Secret Portrait" and "Wha'll Be King but Charlie?" and a lovely piece of puirt a beul by Capercaillie.
