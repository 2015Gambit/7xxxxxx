,BetterRedThan,2012-12-30T22:15Z,"@i.me.myself not
No you cannot. No matter how good the codec it can not recreate lost information (exactly)."
,BetterRedThan,2012-12-30T22:19Z,Thanks protoyu!
,skit111,2012-12-30T22:24Z,still waiting for dts...
,Mr_Heisenberg,2012-12-31T03:54Z,"Is this a russian source? Trying to hold for the U.S. version, the russian captions suck. You really need to know where everything is taking place so english captions are a must for movies like this. Thanks for a reply."
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2013-01-01T22:33Z,"Still the Russian RC BluRay was the Source [RC=Region C]

The Correct title :

Cloud.Atlas.2012.1080p.[RC].BluRay.x264-HDMaNiAcS

[See the description for the audio:

Source Audio....: Cloud Atlas 2012 DD 5.1 448K Track English CHD ]

Good work but still not the proper one [RA or RB].

This one has the explicit text natural hard-coded in the movie ... in Russian!
As all the other rips have for now for ""Cloud Atlas""!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2013-01-01T22:37Z,"@Mr_Heisenberg:

It's the one with ""russian captions"".

No English captions!"
,bon-bongo,2013-01-02T10:37Z,So now people have strong incentive to learn Russian. :-) Good luck to you people.
,bamboofm,2013-01-04T21:03Z,"well done, bro,
