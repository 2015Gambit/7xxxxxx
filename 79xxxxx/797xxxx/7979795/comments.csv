[V],thenoobish,2013-01-04T10:13Z,I don't hate helping people. I just don't have the knowledge to help out. That's why the community have to help each other out. Why just rely on a single man?
,joaolonas,2013-01-05T04:38Z,"Mate, is this F.E.A.R 1? 2?  I saw another FEAR around here sometime ago and it had like 11gb. I couldnt get that to work. Ill give this one a try. 
Thanks!"
,Apotheus,2013-01-10T22:02Z,"JuicyGlo-if it weren't for thenoobish then these torrents would never be uploaded.  He's not saying he isn't going to help people, he's asking if you would write a more professional comment stating your issues with the said torrent rather than going ""This torrent sucks it doesn't work, it fucked up my computer, it doesn't work on Mountain Lion, blah blah""
also, joaolonas-i'm pretty sure this is the original FEAR seeing that there is no number after the title and the download is only 3.22 gb.
thanks again thenoobish.
i'm pretty sure every Mac game i've had the pleasure of playing (non-steam) has been from you."
