Naiad was a hardcore band from Kyoto, Japan. Formed in March 2001 they combined emotional hardcore with ambient instrumental music.

In July 2001 they released their first self-titled demo tape containing 2 tracks, followed by the contribution of 3 songs to the ΓÇ£Change It From Ideal To RealΓÇ¥ split CD of February 2002. With the release of their MCD ΓÇ£Hardcore EmotionΓÇ¥ in 2003, they quickly established themselves as a leading band in the japanese hardcore scene.

After two members left the band for unknown reasons, a planned CD release for August 2006 was cancelled. They played their last show on January 8, 2006.
