BATMAN BEYOND [COMPLETE]
SEED AND COMMENT
IF YOU HAVE A REQUEST COMMENT AND LET ME KNOW ILL TRY =)

Batman Beyond (known as Batman of the Future in Europe, Japan and Latin America) is an American animated television series created by Warner Bros. Animation in collaboration with DC Comics as a continuation of the Batman legacy.[1] Depicting teenager Terry McGinnis as a new Batman in a futuristic Gotham City under the tutelage of an elderly Bruce Wayne, the series began airing on January 10, 1999, and ended its run on December 18, 2001. After 52 episodes spanning three seasons and one direct-to-video film (which seems like an unofficial series finale), the series was put on hold for the Justice League animated series despite the network having announced plans for a fourth season.[2]

Batman Beyond is set in the chronological future of the DC Animated Universe (despite being released before Static Shock, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited).

Batman Beyond is said to explore the darker side of many Batman projects, playing on key elements such as emotions, personal relations, fear of the unknown, technological malfunctions and the disturbing psychological elements of the character of Bruce Wayne. As such, it was considerably darker than most other children's programs at the time, although producer Bruce Timm recalls it was conceived as a kid-friendly Batman cartoon.[3] It is also the first Batman series to portray the hero as a teenager. IGN named the show 40th on their list of "Top 100 Animated TV Series."[4] The continuity of Batman Beyond has made various crossovers into comic books published by DC Comics, including an ongoing series beginning in 2011.

Batman Beyond is currently airing on the UK channel Kix! under the title of Batman of the Future.
