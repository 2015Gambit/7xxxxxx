Good Cheese is an anthropomorphic webcomic drawn and written by Kelly Hamilton about a dormouse named Ashlee and her four friends. The plot centers around their struggles with school work, dates with (mostly) boys and the school's spring formal. The main character Ashlee has a crush on a male anthro lynx named Gunther, who is a photographer but can't afford to go to the Spring formal.
The story and general theme fits into the category of a teen high school movies such as The Breakfast Club. The comic is intended for a high school audience but is appropriate for all ages over 10.
The webcomic was hosted at Keenspace. In 2004, Kelly moved the webcomic to WirePop. The current run of the comic started on 12 December 2006, with daily updates for a month, then moved to bi-weekly updates until September 2007, when it switched to weekly Monday updates.
As of June 31st, 2008, the comic has reached the end of its storyline and there will be no more updates in the foreseeable future.
