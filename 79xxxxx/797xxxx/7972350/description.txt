While John Coltrane was immersed in New YorkΓÇÖs studios and clubs, the Modern Jazz Quartet, under the leadership of pianist John Lewis, enjoyed commercial success exploring the fugues and canons of classical music.

This basically packaged collection brings together five of their best Atlantic recordings, including The Pyramid and Third Stream Music. And they stand up remarkably well. LewisΓÇÖs light, bluesy touch is balanced by Milt JacksonΓÇÖs soulful vibes, Percy Heath is one of the great jazz bass players, and thereΓÇÖs grit beneath the surface.
