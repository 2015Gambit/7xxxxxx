The Body Language Project is the culmination of a decade of personal research including a thorough review of over 60 primary scientific research journal articles. In dating and attraction, body language forms the perfect foundation. If you are only picking up on what is being said, you are missing more than half of the message. It is pinnacle that you understand the subconscious as it is often much more reliable than spoken words. DonΓÇÖt miss the signals, and donΓÇÖt be left wondering and guessing.
