Treehouse - Build A Responsive Website

This course is designed to quickly lead you through the steps of building a responsive website that looks good on any device. The Smells Like Bakin' cupcake company needs their website to work on tablets and phones. We will modify the code of their pre-existing website so that it is flexible and fits beautifully into a wide variety of screen resolutions and devices..

This project will walk us through the basics of responsive design and add support for multiple devices and screen resolutions to the Smells Like Bakin' website. 

Author Allison Grayce simplifies the coding process, with straightforward steps you can recreate on your own. The course explains the basic structure of responsive design, shows how to create a fluid foundation, and introduces the methods for creating a site that adapts to the device it's being viewed on

From there, we'll add media queries, and ensure that all of our typography and media are fully responsive and look great on tablets, phones, and computers.
