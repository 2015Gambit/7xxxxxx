The Worlds Most Expensive Cars
See the worlds most expensive cars has there go up for sale at Christie's.Would you believe that the most expensive car in the world was developed by Volkswagen? The Bugatti Veyron is a mid-engine grand tourer developed by Volkswagen and produced by the Volkswagen-brand Bugatti Automobiles SAS at their headquarters in Chateau St. Jean in Molsheim (Alsace, France).This is by far the most expensive street-legal car available on the market today. It is the fastest accelerating car, reaching 0-60 in 2.6 seconds, and claims to be the fastest car, with a top speed of 253 mph. (Again, IT does not claim this so much as its builders do.) But that claim is not true, as noted in our No. 6 car, the SSC Ultimate Aero. Still, you would probably enjoy owning a Bugatti Veyron, you think?
