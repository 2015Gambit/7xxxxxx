Description : This is one of the earlier tapes done by Tamilee. It's Low-Budget, but still IT's Better than the More Recent, higher-Budget Thighs of Steel workouts. Workout The first Gives a Good Workout cardio as well as toning Giving target. The second is a floor workout, without cardio. I've been doing this a while now, and I still love it. To increase difficulty, I add heavier and heavier leg weights, and sometimes I add hand weights as well. Once you go through it a few times, you learn the routine and know how many things you have to go before you're done. I do both workouts in a row, and still IT Goes by Quickly. Tamilee Changes the exercises to Keep you from Getting bored, Explains About stretching, Muscles You're using, and Reasons You're working Those Muscles. Also she Has a Good presence and the Workout Helps Keep from Getting tedious. This is a Great Workout for All levels, as you CAN Adjust Weights to Keep Improving. I've tried many of the Buns of Steel, as well as a number of other workout tapes, and this one is simply my favorite. I definintely recommend it. From myself - this is an early workout Temili, through which she became famous. In the program with her ΓÇïΓÇïDonna Richardson and Tracy York. Also known now coaches.
