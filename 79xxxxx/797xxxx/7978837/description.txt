In the 1950s, Britain looked back on its epic war effort in films such as The 
Dam Busters, The Cruel Sea and The Colditz Story. However, even at the time 
these productions were criticised for being class-bound and living in the past. 

Journalist and historian Simon Heffer argues that these films have real 
cinematic merit and a genuine cultural importance, that they tell us something 
significant not only about the 1950s Britain from which they emerged but also 
about what it means to be British today.

His case is supported by interviews with stars including Virginia McKenna, 
Sylvia Syms and Sir Donald Sinden, with further contributions from directors 
Guy Hamilton (The Colditz Story) and Michael Anderson (The Dam Busters).
