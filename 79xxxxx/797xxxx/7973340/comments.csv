BTW do you have the complete Batman Brave and the bold 200 comics? because the torrent link here is almost dead for months.

Happy New Year!"
,Hamster-X,2012-12-31T14:01Z,"@STFmaryville Thanks a million for all your uploads! You are one of the main reasons I decided to buy a tablet xDDD

Would you by any chance have (or be able to get) ""Knights of the Living Dead""? (published by SLG). I've been trying to get my hands on them for ages now."
,riverchase,2012-12-31T21:40Z,There was a series called Ash from event comics several years ago. I would love to read anything related to it.
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-01T04:48Z,you're welcome LyokoMx and Hamster-X! i'll see what i can dig up on these requests in the next couple of days. for the moment i'm using significant bandwidth to seed this and a super-villain team-up torrent.  :-)

,tlwytgyh,2013-01-05T05:34Z,"Thank you very much! I've been looking for the Dark Horse hardcover graphic novel ""The Brides of Mister X and Other Stories"" but have been unable to find a copy; is it available? Thanks again!"
,doctor_roxo,2013-01-05T11:04Z,"Awesome work dude! I've been looking for 3 things that i can't find. Any chance you might be able to upload them? They are: Upgrade by Louis Rosenberg, Drafted by Mark Powers & Chris Lie, and 2001 Nights: The Death Trilogy Overture by Yukinobu Hoshino. I have been looking for these for many months with no luck."
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-06T06:41Z,"tlwytgyh and doctor_roxo, i'm sorry to say i haven't seen scans of any of those! doctor_roxo, i did find an old torrent ... i think it's the original english translation of 2001 nights (10 issues from viz comics, i think they later collected them in 3 volumes) but unfortunately there are no seeds. i will keep an eye out for all of the requests."
,doctor_roxo,2013-01-09T19:27Z,Thanks STFmaryville. Yea i kinda figured it might be a problem. I've searched high and low with no luck. But thanks for looking too. I'll keep checking back to see if anything pops up and will follow your uploads. keep up the good work.
