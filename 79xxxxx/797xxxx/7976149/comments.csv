,suiteo,2013-01-01T04:01Z,Plot? IMDB Link??? Without either of these two items (not to mention the technical specs of the video itself) it's a complete waste of time.  If you can't be bothered to be informative then I just can't be bothered with any of your downloads.
,and153,2013-01-01T09:24Z,@suiteo  I can't believe some people in this community.  Too fucking lazy to look it up for yourself. You're getting a free movie but only on your terms?  And if you have not heard about this film then your head must be even further up your own than it comes across in your comment.  Wanker.

,piratebuddha,2013-01-01T14:23Z,"@and153 The movie might be free but the internet access we use to download it isn't. 
There is a reason why The Pirate Bay has a ""description"" section which, at the very least, should have all the detailed tech specs for this upload. "
,vcdman17,2013-01-01T16:08Z,"They are both right. The movie is free so people shouldn't bitch, but there should be some info included, which TVTeam NEVER does. It gets old having to look up every torrent they post as well as scrolling through page after page of multiple copies of the same file that they post and repost over and over just to get better download stats. I only use TVteam when I absolutely have to."
