Rare and not so known as the other two Dragonball movie adaptations, this was done in South Korea without license, and is thus in the public domain.

Follow the adventures of Son Goku, Bulma, Yamcha, Piggy, and Puar as they battle the evil Emperor Pilaf for the 7 magical Dragonballs. Along the way, meet other favorite characters and see other battles against evil along the way to victory against Pilaf.

This movie closely follows the original "Dragonball" plot.

SUBTITLES TO ENGLISH AND OTHER LANGUAGES WANTED!

IMPORTANT: DO NOT SHARE THIS ANYWHERE! You can share clips on youtube, or review it on a site with screenshots and a few clips, but please do not retorrent or upload this to any sites - streaming, or hosting, or torrent! Keep it exclusively here!

Remastered: I scaled the video properly and de-hissed the audio and mixed it to sound as good as it could. I also made the DVD jacket inserts and did many hours of work to bring you this rare find!

Extras:
I did include a few other things besides the iso. Included is a small mpg file that has all of the previews that came before the movie (the audio on those isn't corrected, and the video isn't scaled).

I also included scans of the VHS jackets, and a couple of DVD jackets that I made.
