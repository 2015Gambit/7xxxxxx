Before.The.Fall is part1 of a BSG s4e19 Daybreak fan edit. Part2 is BSG.fanedit.Daybreak2.Battle.Of.The.Colony.bsg4you.mkv

The Before.The.Fall fanedit is made up of:
* s4e19 Daybreak (150 minute extended version), flashbacks
* s4e19 Daybreak, deleted scene flashbacks
* s0e01 Night1 mini-series, deleted scenes before the Fall of the Twelve Colonies
* s5e00 The Plan, 1 scene that was supposed to be a Daybreak flashback

Before.The.Fall covers from about 2 years before the Fall of the Twelve Colonies right up to the mini-series Night. These scenes are collected by character and are ordered like this:

00.00-10.05 Laura Roslin

10.06-20.40 Kara "Starbuck" Thrace and Lee "Apollo" Adama

20.41-22.11 Sam Anders

22.12-29.39 William Adama, Saul Tigh and Ellen Tigh
* the scene with Ellen arriving at the bar was last in the broadcast but is placed when it happened

29.40-30.22 Tory Foster and John Cavil with Boomer very briefly at the start

30.23-38.47 Sharon "Boomer" Valerii, Galen Tyrol, Karl "Helo" Agathon and Cally Henderson
* the Boomer and Gina Six clip is from the movie The Plan though it was originally shot as a flashback for s4e19 Daybreak
* Boomer landing hard is a deleted scene from the mini-series, s0e01 Night; some blue screen is visible though unfinished special effects were removed
* The Boomer and Chief "I'm a very bad pilot" scene is also from the mini-series and was included since it occurred during the s4e19 Daybreak flashbacks

38.48-50.03 Gaius Baltar and Caprica Six
* the last scene has the last 25 seconds of "The Shape Of Things To Come" added on at the end
