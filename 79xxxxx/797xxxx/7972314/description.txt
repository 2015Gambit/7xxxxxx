Storyline:
Unable to gain acceptance at the snootier fraternities they pledge, the Deltas,
a motley crew of misfits and sociopaths bent on disrupting the well-starched status quo,
engage in various illegalities that land them in hot water with both the stern college dean and the neighboring jock fraternity.
Their exploits eventually cause them to be placed on "double-secret probation,"
until finally, they are kicked out of school and, as the dean reminds them, newly eligible for the Vietnam draft. What's a Delta to do?
