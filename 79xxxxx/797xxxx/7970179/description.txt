Storyline:
In a small town in Oregon, farm girls Dottie Hinson and Kit Keller are sisters who compete with each other, even over the little things.
With so many young men overseas fighting the Axis, there is a danger that professional baseball will be shut down for the duration of the war.
A well-known candy manufacturer, Walter Harvey, contrives the idea to create a professional baseball league for women;
both the keep the sport alive and to make a buck or two.
Dottie is recruited by a scout for this new league but refuses to go unless her sister is allowed on the team.
These women, along with their team-mates, begin a journey that opens up a whole new world, far beyond that of the baseball diamond,
lead by team manager, Jimmy Dugan, a washed-up star ruined by alcohol and angered and embarrassed to be the coach of a girl's team.
