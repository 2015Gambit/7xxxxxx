it's definately a clip show...alltought it may include a few out takes that I don't recall seeing ....I could be wrong perhaps I just didn't remember seeing them...................(wonder what you think)?        
Thanks."

had a look at this and it's appears to be the same episode as the VG S10 E16....(I'm not critizing...just a little confused)...I'm sure you will get it sussed out when the bbc get there stuff together...(the best of are not super important to me I can""t speak for others however).....your right...real bummer"

Wikipedia lists this as: ""QI VG: Series J Compilation Show 1""

Seems odd that wiki got it right as the BBC got it wrong.
.
It even gives the correct play date of 12-28
.
My only mistake was in calling it ""Jolly"", which is next up, I think.
