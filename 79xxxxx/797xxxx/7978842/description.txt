For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, too tired, but to suppose:
V=8
A8
.
UseNet labeled this 'S10E15' which makes it 'Jolly' and 11 days early.
but it looks like another clip show to me - says 'VG' like S10E16 does.
Can't be S10E17, that's three days off and this is three days old.
Possibly I've screwed up, you tell me.
