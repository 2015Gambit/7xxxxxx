Melissa Harris-Perry; Sunday, December 30, 2012.Nerdland looked back at the funny, absurd and ridiculous moments of 2012 that literally made Nerdland do a double take and goes, say what?


In Nerdland were:

Jaime Kilstein (co-host of Citizen Radio), Maysoon Zayid (founder of the New York Arab American comedy festival), Elon James White columnist, a blogger and host of this week "In Blackness"), and Molly Knefel (a writer and co-host of podcast radio dispatch).

Dorie Clark (former spokesperson for Howard Dean, contributing reporter at magazine and adjent professor at Duke University's global executive) joins and replaced Molly Knefel on the panel.

Then new panel: Molly Knefel (stand-up comic and writer and co-host of "Radio Dispatch"), Maysoon Zayid (founder of New York Arab Comedy 
Festival); Dorie Clark (adjunct professor at Duke University and former spokeswoman for Howard Dean), and Jaime Kilstein (co-host of "Citizen Radio") came.

Elon James White returned at some point.

Then they had a lightning round.

She then had a thank you to her staff to end the year.
