[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-01T16:30Z,"you're welcome kthxbye2. gene26, i included the project superpowers omnibus last week in a big ass torrent of books. (the omnibus contains the whole series, vol. 1 + 2.) assuming your torrent client has the option, you can download just the PS volume! hope that helps.
