In this torrent, I've included: the original series; both Giant-Size issues; a few Avengers issues that crossed over with SVTU #9; and the CHAMPIONS issue that finishes the story from #14. And just for the heck of it, the 5-issue SVTU revival from '07 that stars MODOK.

The first series started in 1975 with two Giant-Size issues before changing into a regular bi-monthly series. It initially teamed up Dr. Doom and Sub-Mariner, who had lost his own series, from which it picked up the unresolved plots, especially that of comatose Atlanteans. After several changes of writers and artists and a crossover with The Avengers, the plot gets resolved in issue #13 when Dr. Doom revives the Atlanteans, thus dissolving his alliance with Sub-Mariner.

Issue #14 featured Magneto and Dr. Doom and was the final issue of the series, and its plot-line was resolved in Champions #16. However, SVTU continued with issue #15 the next year, but it was just a reprint of the Doom stories from Astonishing Tales #4 and 5. SVTU issues #16 and 17 featured the Red Skull and the Hate-Monger. Inexplicably, the final issue (17) was cover-dated June 1980, more than a year after #16.

SVTU includes the death of 1940s Sub-Mariner sweetheart Betty Dean and the gruesome death of her murderer, Dr. Dorcas. Steve Englehart created The Shroud, a character partly inspired by Batman, shortly before he started to work for DC Comics on Detective Comics. The series also features a bizarre guest-appearance by Henry Kissinger.

Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11 was a 2007-2008 mini-series, featuring eleven super-villains in the manner of the movie "Ocean's Eleven."
