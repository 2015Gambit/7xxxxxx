,zuttty,2013-01-01T21:38Z,Is #7 going to be coming?
,cindy25,2013-01-02T02:28Z,"there was no scene release for ep 7, so tvteam can't release it.  the only way we will get ep 7 is if someone with showtime caps it, and posts it.

I wish this would be broadcast in the UK. :)"
,scratcht,2013-01-02T06:25Z,someone with showtime can you please upload EPISODE 7?
,TheTooleMan,2013-01-02T16:11Z,What's a scene release? Hope someone can grab #7.

[T],theburningbush,2013-01-03T22:58Z,"According to http://www.sho.com/sho/oliver-stones-untold-history-of-the-united-states/season/1/episode/7#/index , any Showtime subscriber with either ""On Demand"" or ""Showtime Anytime"" service -- and the ability to capture from the service -- has until 05-Feb-2013 to get episode 7."
