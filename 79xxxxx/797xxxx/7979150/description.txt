     Do Not Ask What Good We Do: Inside the U.S. House of Representatives


The U.S. House of RepresentativesΓÇöa large, often unruly body of men and women elected every other year from 435 distinct microcosms of AmericaΓÇöhas achieved renown as ΓÇ£the peopleΓÇÖs House,ΓÇ¥ the worldΓÇÖs most democratic institution, and an acute Rorschach of biennial public passions. In the midterm election year 2010, recession-battered Americans expressed their discontent with a simultaneously overreaching and underperforming government by turning the formerly Democratically controlled House over to the Republicans. Among the new GOP majority were eighty-seven freshmen, many of them political novices with Tea Party backing who pledged a more open, responsive, and fiscally thrifty House. What the 112th Congress instead achieved was a public standing so lowΓÇöa ghastly 9 percent approval ratingΓÇö that, as its longest-serving member, John Dingell, would dryly remark, ΓÇ£I think pedophiles would do better.ΓÇ¥ What happened? Robert Draper explores this question just as he examined the Bush White House in his 2007 New York Times bestselling book Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W. BushΓÇöby burrowing deeply inside the subject, gaining cooperation of the major players, and producing a colorful, unsparingly detailed, but evenhanded narrative of how the House of Representatives became a house of ill repute.
