Battle.Of.The.Colony is part2 of a BSG s4e19 Daybreak fan edit. Part1 is BSG.fanedit.Daybreak1.Before.The.Fall.bsg4you.mkv

The Battle.Of.The.Colony fanedit is made up of non-flashback portions of Battlestar Galactica s4e19 Daybreak (150 minute extended version). There are no s4e19 Daybreak deleted scenes that are not flashbacks so Battle.Of.The.Colony is all 1080p clips. Other than removing the flashbacks, 3 changes were made for Battle.Of.The.Colony:

1) Removed 3 pieces of Starbuck dialog just before and during the climactic confrontation between Athena and Boomer:
* "Company let's move!" 2.5 seconds
* "All right, this is really touching, can we get the hell out of here?" 2.5 seconds
* "Eh, can we not tell her the plan?" 1.5 seconds

2) Removed the following 3 clips from the very end of s4e19 Daybreak:
* The robot montage with Jimi's Watchtower playing, 35 seconds
* HeadSix and HeadBaltar walking away on the busy city side walk, 12.5 seconds
* The credits, 4.25 minutes

3) Added a new ending that starts just after HeadBaltar says "silly me ... silly, silly me":
* A 7 minute montage of upbeat clips set to Jimi Hendrix's version of All Along the Watchtower
