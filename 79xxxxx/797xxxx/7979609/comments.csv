,iceman0826,2013-01-03T03:11Z,"nosteam i've been enjoying your releases^^, especially the updates and patches that's included in every release that you made. But i have a question in your website there is a separate link in the downloading the save game patches, do i still need to download it? or the one that you uploaded here in tpb already have those game save patches/updates?  i am quite confused especially with the crysis torrent you have here in tpb. thanks anyway^^"

report back after install, nosteam is usually great though ;)"

Everything is working flawlessly for me.....I didn't need an update patch to save my game...In fact, I've never needed any of the update patches to save.  I hope everything is working for you because this is one awesome game!"
