According to Saxon, during the 1960s he sent brochures about The Militant's Formulary to 'several thousand' police and fire chiefs. His stated purpose was that, as a result of several officers being killed by "improvised weaponry directed at them by radicals", police and fire departments could use the literature 'to recognize improvised bombs and such and their common components'. However, some of the recipients believed Saxon to be a radical, and sent letters stating this fact to the police in Saxon's hometown of Eureka, California. In response, the chief of the Eureka Police Department replied with letters assuring the others that Saxon was 'on their side'.

Much of the content of these books consists of reprints of old books now in the public domain. The first volume talks about how to blow up a car, make napalm and poisons such as ricin, nicotine, arsenic and cyanide. It also contained a full U.S. Army self-defense manual along with a gunsmithing workshop. This included diagrams of how to alter the firing mechanism for different firearms. These modifications were often to increase rate of fire. The second volume talks about improvised weapons that could be made legally using common household items. It also had a number of easily made and readily available booby traps and a number of other explosives recipes. The third volume, which was not widely available, is the least controversial as it mostly contained information on crime in modern society, how to beat the system, and significantly less information on "anarchism" or 'terrorism. A fourth volume was published, but it is very rare to find a copy and contains more of what the previous volumes contained.
