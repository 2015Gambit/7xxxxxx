Medieval alchemists wrote of a mysterious fountain of youth, whose waters could 
rejuvenate anyone who drank them. But can water really be magical? 

In the second of this year's Christmas Lectures, Dr Peter Wothers drinks from 
the fountain and finds out whether the elements lurking in the water can 
restore his youth. Along the way he discovers how exploding balloons could 
solve the energy crisis, how water contains the remains of the most violent 
reactions on Earth and that the real secret to eternal youth might be drinking 
no water at all. 

Peter is joined in his quest by Paralympic champion cyclist Mark Colbourne and 
finds out what happens when the two most reactive elements on the periodic 
table, caesium and fluorine, meet each other.
