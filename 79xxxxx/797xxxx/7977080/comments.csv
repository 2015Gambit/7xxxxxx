Aside from this instance..I never do this..but I gotta request a rip or two..sorry..but they are decent stories..actors/actresses..production crew etc...oh yeah..and they basically don't exist as...active... torrents now..

'Browns Requiem'

'Rolling Thunder' 

'Killing Zoe' (this one may be a challenge as it really requires hardcoded english subs for the many french lingo portions)

I really appreciate and enjoy your 1 1/2 (+/-) to 3G UL's..thanks again."
