Tomorrow we can all enjoy the classic gta:sa game when we are done partying hard! Don't get too drunk mates! 

Also, NEVER go near firework that fail to go off! The are not reliable.. Otherwise you might not have any eyes left for playing games like these! :(

Take care!

I will wait for a DUPLEX crack

,wooled,2013-01-03T06:24Z,"Okay this is for all of the guys like me who have never used ReactPSN and have firmwares between v.4.21 - 4.30v2.3 because we already have the patched VSH file.
1. Download reActPSN v2.23
2. Install .pkg file on PS3
3. Create new user named ""aa""
4. Leave PS3 alone and go to computer; do not launch reActPSN it will not work
5. Use Ps3Splitter to split the GTA SA .pkg file
6. Make sure in options you have your install directory as your external HDD
7. Put exdata folder in external HDD and make a new folder named GTA SA and put the split  GTA SA.pkg file in
8. Go back to PS3 and insert external HDD on the rightmost USB port (make sure it is the only USB connected) and in user ""aa"" go into reActPSN
9. It should reboot and the ""aa"" username should change now go back to the original user
10. The GTA SA .pkg file is now ready to be installed
11. Go into Multiman and go to file manager
12. Take the GTA SA folder and copy it and paste it in dev_hdd0
13. Go into the folder after the folder is pasted and the split files should be joined
14. Install the .pkg file
You are now done and ready to play GTA SA freely. If you don't have firmwares between v.4.21 - 4.30v2.3 you have to get a patched VSH file. I don't know how to install that but I'm sure there are numerous other guides that can help you. After you do that you should be free to use this guide with no problems."
,Lucianb20,2013-01-03T13:17Z,"Wooled you gave a cool tutorial, followed step by step...good job bro...but the graphics is f*&^% up...is there a way to fix it...note it is a ps2 game and can only be played with charging cable not wireless"
,hamedbc,2013-01-03T19:07Z,"seed pls , 2 day 1gb download , seeeed"
,wooled,2013-01-03T21:27Z,"No. I don't think there's any way to fix the graphics. They don't look too bad in my opinion standard PS2 quality, although I did have to fiddle around with the brightness settings.
You could try uninstalling are re installing since you already took care of the ReactPSN steps.
And on another note I was able to play the game wireless."
