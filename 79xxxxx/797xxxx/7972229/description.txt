Keats compared discovering Homer to "finding a new planet." What is it in Homer's great worksΓÇöand especially the OdysseyΓÇöthat so enthralled him? Why have readers before and since reacted the same way? By joining award-winning classics professor Elizabeth Vandiver for these lectures on the Odyssey, you can get answers to these and hundreds of other questions.
At first glance, those first two questions indeed seem troubling.

The epic's exploration centers around a single question about the protagonist, and the two related questions it immediately suggests:

- Why does Odysseus long so powerfully to go home?
- What holds people together and keeps them going in extreme situationn such as war or shipwreck?
- Why do we love our own so strongly?
- It is this universal theme that seems of paramount importance. What does it mean to live?
