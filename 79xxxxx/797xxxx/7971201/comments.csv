I am barely staying above 54.2 KB/s  & I am uploading at 160 KB/s

Thank you Resistance for the Movie, I am not unappreciated of your work & I have been DL your streams for years.  Thanks... Looks like I may exceed the 1:1 or 1:2 ratio before I even get to watch it.. LOL

Promise to Rate A/V when complete"

Thank You for a Great Rip!  As always visual Difference on Large HD Wide Screen & the surround was just the Cherry on top!  Well Done!"
