,uncleseano,2013-01-01T14:59Z,Impressive uploads lad!
,offameoffire,2013-01-07T07:45Z,I will seed all of these for as long as possible. This is exactly what I was hoping to find.
,AmaHist,2013-01-07T12:26Z,"It's a great series. It's a history lesson on how the ideas of space travel, alien beings, etc. were coming into general awareness. Watching them is filling in all kinds of pop-culture references from that time that I never caught before. And they're just a lot of fun -- thoughtful, playful, exploitative, and just plain dumb. 

Whoever created these was still going, posting a new one every week or so, when Demonoid shut down. Broke my heart, especially for this series. I've scoured the search engines, but as far as I can find, they never reposted the series or posted new sets. I hope they'll will see this reposting and pick up where they left off."

PLEASE CONTINUE SEEDING after you upload, as much as you can, preferably to a 1.0 ratio. Grab and run downloaders are forcing me to upload to ratios as high as 3.0 before there are enough stable seeds. That means up to two days to upload a torrent before I can start the next one. My upload bandwidth is modest. At this rate it could take another 6 weeks to upload the whole set. By not seeding, you're slowing yourselves down as well as everyone else.
