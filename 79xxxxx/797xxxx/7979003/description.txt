Wind And Water: Your Personal Feng Shui Journey
Format: ePub

Feng Shui works with the circulation and flow of the life force (ch'i) in the living and working environment to create balance and harmony. It provides ways to create or select an ideal living or work space to bring prosperity, productivity, and peace.
Throughout the centuries, Feng Shui has been extensively used in all Eastern cultures. It has recently found its way to the West where it has gained popularity as people have come to realize its power.
Wind and Water: Your Personal Feng Shui Journey presents Feng Shui as simple suggestions that can be done on a daily basis. There are many Feng Shui books that provide the complete didactic approach. In this book, each page will provide information and a corresponding activity. Instead of reading about Feng Shui, this book will provide an immediate experience of Feng Shui.
