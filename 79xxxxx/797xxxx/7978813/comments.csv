,pneuma11,2013-01-02T06:08Z,This for real?? Not that I doubt your green skull how is the a/v/m on it? Is it legit dvd quality sound or is it cam sound Im just wondering?
,pneuma11,2013-01-02T06:28Z,Yeah it did not download fast at all and why are the comments being deleted a legit question about your dvd screener?
,pneuma11,2013-01-02T06:44Z,sorry i retract that statement was having problems with tpb and my posts... No worries and the dl has sped up a ton...
,slick321,2013-01-02T09:32Z,"Good quality video but the audio is way, way  out of sync.

,ne0shane,2013-01-02T19:52Z,does this have the watermark on a certain scene like the others? just wanted to  ask :)
,iverie,2013-01-02T20:01Z,"Very, very good quality for a cam. There is a watermark every now and then, but it doesn't bother much.
Audio is out of sync, can be fixed easily with VLC."
,pneuma11,2013-01-02T21:32Z,sound is out of sync about half way through on not that it mattered it was the most watchable version yet... 
,Typhoon222,2013-01-02T21:55Z,pls can somebody fix sound and reupload it? it is horrible always change sync when you are watching it over smart tv... please can somebody do somethink? THX for upload and great quality!
,PauloFran,2013-01-03T00:18Z,"Great quality for a SCR.
Thank you!"
,n0bl3h0bO,2013-01-03T01:12Z,how is the frame rate on this one?
,pneuma11,2013-01-03T02:25Z,"A-8/v-9/m-4

,slick321,2013-01-03T20:46Z,"+400. Ok, thanx neon"
,jovic_d,2013-01-03T23:12Z,"A-8, V-9, M-8 
Thanks for this, great job ;)"
,chaletamale,2013-01-04T01:34Z,"V: 6 (thats being pretty generous considering this is a screener)
A: out of sync, but 7 otherwise

not being picky here. just honest. the quality of the picture is severely degraded and extremely dark. it almost looks like youre watching it on an old VHS tape. some scenes its so dark and blurry that everything just fades into a mess of black. i dunno if the academy just sent out a degraded copy of the movie for screening or if maybe the ripper just did a mediocre job, but its pretty bad. 

still, its good enough to get us by till the real versions leak, but yea. just giving you guys a heads up.

not gonna mention audio cuz its already been mentioned multiple times here. just felt an honest post about the picture quality needed to be posted"
,bechep,2013-01-04T07:05Z,thank you thank you thank you!! You're awesome!
,fragomatic,2013-01-04T18:26Z,"AUDIO 10/10
VIDEO 8.6/10
TINY TINY DOWNLOAD

HOW THE FUCK DID YOU DO THIS!

WELL DONE!"
,Lenhoy,2013-01-06T00:15Z,"Pretty good video, though the watermark, that appears from time to time is a bit annoying. Great Audio, but it's not in sync. I started with +0.4 seconds, but turned it up to +1 second halfway trough the movie. Still Great quality, and small file size :D"
,dlarrym1111,2013-01-06T11:14Z,"Cams don't have watermarks. they are not released in theaters but are for the film academy to preview, or for movie reviewers like Siskel & Ebert or Leonard Martin, 
A cam cannot be a screener. what movie in IMAX, or in any theater have you gone to see, pay 15+ dollars to see, then all kinds of warnings pop up every 20 mins? The answer is none. The watermarks are there to prevent it from being released in a theater, enough said."
,You_Muppet,2013-01-07T03:13Z,"I agree with @lenhoy's comments (in VLC, 'k' on the key board will increase the speed and 'J' will decrease it). V=7, A=8. Ta."
,Madrid20,2013-01-07T04:09Z,When we can expect a DVDRIP 700 mb or 1.37 gb avi copy from this ?
,Afzal8920,2013-01-07T20:42Z,nice moves buddy
,michaelrwatson,2013-01-08T09:17Z,"@Ganool/neon: PLEASE don't create/upload mkv files. MKV sucks balls, and so do you. Thanx."
[V],neon,2013-01-08T21:19Z,"@michaelrwatson...you have 3 choices

1-download
2-dont download
3-suck my balls

,gungrave4ever,2013-01-09T19:40Z,"dlarrym1111, Siskel & Ebert?  Get with the fucking times; Siskel died back in the twentieth century.  Where the fuck have you been for the last two decades?"
