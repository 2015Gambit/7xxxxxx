This book covers most SAS programming techniques, from the basics to intermediate and 
advanced topics. As indicated by the title, every programming technique is illustrated by 
one or more examples. Each chapter contains problems so that it could also be used as a 
textbook in a college course. Solutions to the odd-numbered problems are included in the 
book, while a complete set of solutions are available online for instructors. 
The four major sections cover getting started, DATA step processing, presenting and 
summarizing your data, and advanced topics (such as reading unstructured data and using 
multilabel and embedded formats). 
Anyone who programs using SAS, from beginner to intermediate and advanced users, 
will find this book helpful. 
The example approach makes it unique. If you ask most programmers how they learn to 
program or understand a SAS feature, they will tell you that they want to see an example. 
Every example in the book is followed by a detailed explanation of how the program 
works. 
Because this book covers so many diverse topics, it should be an ideal reference for SAS 
users. There is enough detail, in chapters covering such topics as PROC REPORT or 
PROC TABULATE, that for many users, this book will be all they need (in addition to 
SAS OnlineDoc, of course).
