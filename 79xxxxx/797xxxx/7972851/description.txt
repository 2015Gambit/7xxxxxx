I know I said no more releases and no more packs. But after wandering around
the forums and looking around online and notice an idiot or two taking credit for v2.0 of my Mega Mapper (not to mention the entire contents of the torrent). I figured I'd one up everyone and provide the answers to the questions:

Q. Who has v1.19 of this cracked or has a working serial for this?
A. This fella and this has it

Q, Who has any of the missing model packs?
A. Again thanks to some of my friends, moi again.

Q. Why is it so damn big?
A. Ummmm you did see what's all in this right?

Q. Why doesn't it have the alternative method for Multiplayer map extending?
A. Cuz they were involved with TGC's first attacks at V1 and V2 of my product simply cuz I refuse to be one of them cuz they can't ask properly and nicely to lend a hand to this product. Please and thank you get you everywhere with me. I'm simply repaying such kindness shown to me, would've left it be but you flagged my videos so damn much and still came bugging on another video website claiming libel and I coughed up enough proof there to shut you up.

Q. Can I marry you?
A. Nope taken, but you can kiss me on my cheek. :P

Q. Why 3 discs? Why not make it a simple file dump as usual?
A. Cuz of that moron I caught lazily copying the entire contents of my last torrent of this and then laying claim to my Mega Mapper and even renaming it his invention. I tag my name so they can trust it, you tagged your name to get famous off my FREE product dumbass....

Special Thanks to these people cuz if it weren't for them I wouldn't have realized what kind of morons them idiots were in the first place. Even going legit with them wasn't worth it:

FuZzi and Madjunkies (I seen ya trying dude, i really did but unfortunately nothings seeded anymore, but i know the first copies of the early model packs are your rips)

WHOEVER UPLOADED THAT MEGA DVD, have no idea who put that up but you contributed as well.

Your Model Pack 35 wasn't used, and neither were a few, then i realized, damn they are all tagged with it. So again screw TGC and I sandboxed it to extract the files i wanted out of it cleanly, VOILA! Clean rip of 35 but it doesnt include the installer (only thing missing off it, the actual files to copy and paste into your files areas are there intact and clean)

Pack #47 wasn't extracting as well, could've been hit at an earlier time. Used a rar repairer for it, snapped it out of it and i got the fully functioning installer out of it. It's STILL not a full set yet. Buuuuut we're getting pretty damn close :P
