[T],n2kmaster,2012-12-31T00:21Z,Same issues with 47 use 7zip to pull out the files
,zured,2013-01-02T21:44Z,It's an awesome release please seed it! I seed it with 1Mbyte/s but I got stucked az 65% (30kb/s)
[T],n2kmaster,2013-01-03T23:50Z,"Don't worry im leaving it up on multiple machines to seed it, im not letting the ratio drop on this cuz its a big collection. Plus to this was a request to prove i actually read the forum round here. 1.19 version has been something everyone wanted.

Disc 1 - Installers, Disc 2- TGC's Model Packs, Disc 3 - Extra and custom stuff
If you download only 1 disc, help seed it, every little bit counts on this one"
[T],n2kmaster,2013-01-03T23:54Z,"Side note, if your version 1.19 doesnt start in full mode and you're stuck in free version, open your userdetails.ini file and look for the following

[PERSONAL DATA]
YourName=
YourSerialCode=
YourFullPath= 

And manually insert the 1.19 valid serial. I would also recommend disabling the updating of it as well. I noticed they started putting that feature in there to catch the torrents. 

Yeah what was that line they used on someone they thought was harmless ""Yeah, don't look up EFX Mod on google anymore"" when one of your members asked for a copy of it :P LOL!"

[T],n2kmaster,2013-01-10T22:47Z,"I am still seeding it, actually 3 of the seeders are me. Hence why I'm asking for a seedbox that someone would be super awesome and share with me. I'm on cracked wifi and capped upload speeds no matter how I look at it I can only send so fast. But this is one I wont stop seeding simply cuz its that good. Sorry no, I'm not splitting it up simply because the last big pack i put up some idiot copy and pasted the entire torrent + the description from pirate bay, labeled my model packs and my mega mapper his own initials, refused to label it correctly, even asked for me to pull my comments for posting where he ripped them off from.  If it wasn't for him, i would've uploaded each pack individually. So you can all go blame the blogger idiot for that one...."
[T],n2kmaster,2013-01-10T22:49Z,"and if you're only in it for the model packs, disc 2 has em"
