,wanderlustus,2013-01-02T03:20Z,"I'm still suspecting fake, even though I'm downloading.  'Something' about this seems dodgy.  Skulls ever been hacked?"
,Yamcha67,2013-01-02T03:26Z,Awesome!! I'm not gonna doubt Extremezone.. Looks legit
,anilboom,2013-01-02T03:26Z,alrerady!!! with EZ know its real
[V],extremezone,2013-01-02T03:47Z,"wanderlustus-how to spot a fake:
1.User-trusted,other uploads
2.Description-screens/etc
3.Check if other uploaders shared the ""love"" thepiratebay.se/browse/201"
,Yamcha67,2013-01-02T03:49Z,"Just tested the portion I have downloaded using VLC, and it is infact legit. The audio is english, the quality is rather good, definitely DVD Screener material.. 

Thanks for the awesome upload ExtremeZone =) "
,MegansDad,2013-01-02T03:52Z,@wanderlustus - all of these copies of The Hobbit that have flooded TPB the past day or so are MPAA screener copies for the Academy Awards.  They're the copies that are sent to Academy voters to watch to help them decide what movies get nominated for the various categories.
,mrholmes,2013-01-02T04:08Z,"skimmed through it, v8 a8 minus 1 point for the blurred water mark. however its legit."
,TWEETY2455,2013-01-02T04:11Z,"IT IS NOT FAKE THERE ARE 1000S IN 30M OF THE SAME D/L  IT IS GOING TO TAKE HOURS TO FINISH D/LING ;., "

,scotch6,2013-01-02T04:38Z,Thanks !
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-01-02T04:51Z,"It's not that unusual for screeners to relatively new movies to pop up around this time of year. Sometimes even for movies that have only had awards screenings and won't see wide released until after the Academy Awards broadcast. Shoot, 'This Is 40' had a nice looking screener out two weeks after it was released. At least The Hobbit has already made a nice chunk of change at the box office.

Thanks extreme. Nice one."
,wanderlustus,2013-01-02T04:56Z,"Sorry, EZ.  Just my paranoia, I guess.  Should shut my gob until I'd grabbed more of it, as it's looking good."
,TheRaja,2013-01-02T05:02Z,"WOW!
*TOOK* an unexpected journey. "
,Deathwoolf,2013-01-02T05:03Z,Thanks! Extremezone
,PleaseDontBanMe,2013-01-02T05:14Z,Holy shit!! I had to log in just to tell you extremezone you're the fucking man! Thanks dude will be seeding this for days.
,poijhbn,2013-01-02T05:16Z,This is great! Surely it won't be long before a Les MisĂŠrables screener?
,JohnnyNeto,2013-01-02T05:30Z,"Thanks man, I hope it's the same or better quality than Skyfall screener."
,kevduch,2013-01-02T05:31Z,"Extremezone, I love you. Your my most trusted uploader. = )"
,a2dogs222,2013-01-02T05:57Z,"Please know that we fully appreciate your hard work and expertise on this, and we thank you."
,1ricca,2013-01-02T06:46Z,"This is great how a DVDrip is out so soon but why are all of these uploads at 30fps? Headache city, that means it's been converted from 48fps to 24fps then a 3:2 pull down to 30fps. "
,.Leto.,2013-01-02T09:24Z,"There's a framerate problem, picture is jerky during the whole movie. Still very watchable though, and it's by far the best version available at the moment. Sound quality is excellent. Thanks."
,AJoX,2013-01-02T09:36Z,"awesome ! ty extremezone ! just 1 question,i don't want to sound gay but,my GF is killing me about the new Twilight movie,can you upload it so i can get chance of some anal action ? ty btw,perfect torrents as always :)"

,sealedsaint,2013-01-02T15:56Z,This is freaking awesome.. extremezone is the best!!
,Trakanonn,2013-01-02T17:25Z,Anyone else only getting like 30KB/s?  I set my max connections all to 500 and upload to 200.  And it keeps climbing and falling from like 20 to 50 then from 50 to 20.
,tambu90,2013-01-02T17:30Z,thanks men i love this movie
,papayrus1,2013-01-02T18:49Z,Groovejet this is downloading 101 for idiots class session 1. How are you going to have somehting like a bluray when it is not even on a dvd yet? Answer is your not but this is a 10 considering those facts. You want bluray then wait till it is on bluray you want to compare a camera recording to a bluray then either you don't realise how this works or your just trying to be wise and looking foolish in the process. I think almost everyone here knows it can't be compared to a bluray. You are comparing apples and oranges. 2 different things. Compare a bluray rip to another bluray rip or a cam to another cam not a cam to a bluray. For a cam this is 10. Thanks Extreme.
,papayrus1,2013-01-02T18:52Z,Oops my bad says dvdscr but still comparing dvd to bluray is like comparing apples and oranges. It says dvdscr not bluray.

,Karayan71,2013-01-02T20:19Z,"I dont know why Jackson(Peter( is gonna make this 3 movies, 2 is enough, and we still have to wait a year for the second one.  Trying to do a Deathly hallows with the hobbit, well hallows bombed.....lets wait and see."
,oobaka,2013-01-02T20:33Z,"video is clear but I find it jerky.
I'd give it a 6 at best"
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-01-02T21:44Z,Its pretty dark the whole way through. These movies are meant to be stunning and bright but it is a dvd screener so i understand. Thanks for the up regardless but i recommend waiting for blu ray if you really wanna enjoy this one
,Infenix13,2013-01-03T00:08Z,"This actually isn't 480p as mentioned above, it's 304p. I'll wait for a 720/1080p copy, though thanks uploader!"
,PauloFran,2013-01-03T00:17Z,"Great quality for a SCR.

,Groovejet,2013-01-03T06:40Z,"@papayrus1
My comment was aimed at those that own a big screen TV and like to see a film at it's best. If you can't afford to go to the cinema to see it now then wait till the bluray torrent comes out. This release is great for viewing on an ipad or small TV, but not a big 60""panel."
,Granchy,2013-01-03T07:34Z,"V:6

Don't ruin movies for yourself by watching awful copies like this."
,Minty_Winty,2013-01-03T07:51Z,"Video is no more than a 6 on a big tv.  Definitely wait for a proper BDrip if quality is what you're after.  

Audio is a 7, 2.3 GB and no 5.1?  Is the screener not 5.1 or is the rip just lazy?

Saw movie in HFR and thought the movie was great, HFR needs work though."
,arcanebop,2013-01-03T16:33Z,"Anybody been able to find accurate Eng subtitles yet? I used Google Translate with the Dutch version and replaced the Dutch with the English with the .srt, but as one can imagine, it's not 100% accurate (overtly literal translations, awkward grammar, etc.)"
,DopeShooter,2013-01-03T19:13Z,Is this better than  scene4all's upload? Because he is in the top! 
,RlynnSII,2013-01-03T21:04Z,As always the best!! Thanks extemezone! Happy New Year! :)

Thank you for all of your outstanding work. Yet another brilliant up."
,Madrid20,2013-01-07T04:08Z,When we can expect a DVDRIP 700 mb or 1.37 gb avi copy from this ?
,DangerHeart,2013-01-08T07:07Z,Downloaded fast and quality/sound look great from just scanning over scenes. Another great dl extremezone.
