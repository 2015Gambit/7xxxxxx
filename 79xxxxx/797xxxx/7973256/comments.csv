Fuck TvTeam people, get a grip on reality, your loosing seeders day by day because you think you're so fucking fantastic you don't need to give us any info or links.

Soon I will stop using your contributions at all, I'm getting fed up..."
,RadioResearch,2012-12-31T01:49Z,"Maybe this?

,mark_aleshnick,2012-12-31T01:54Z,"If I see an interesting title from tvteam, I just go to another seed by a COURTEOUS poster and use theirs - boycott tvteam."
,illtress,2012-12-31T02:29Z,"Thanx TvTeam for all the interesting titles and good job ignoring dicks who can't even google ""ingrate""...LOL "
,bwagner79,2012-12-31T02:35Z,"Boy, do I ever agree with the comments here.  TvTeam needs to get its act together, providing torrent info, and filtering out some of its uploads"
,aikoaiko,2012-12-31T09:25Z,"Whiny Bitches!!!  Why don't you take the 10 seconds to look it up on Google and post a link yourself?

  And Oh No! Don't stop downloading their free torrents!  Whatever would they do?!!

 Cruntsacks!

 p.s.  thanks TVTeam "

,suiteo,2013-01-01T03:55Z,"Plot? IMDB Link??? Without either of these two items (not to mention the technical specs of the video itself) it's a complete waste of time.  If you can't be bothered to be informative then I just can't be bothered with any of your downloads.

After reading some of these other comments it is interesting to see I am not alone with my opinion.  However, to the potty mouths out there........ grow up!  There is no need for such foul language to get your point across.  It only demonstrates your true intelligence.

As far as other suggestions to Google for the information................. I for one am a busy person and often multitask.  Since there are a ton of movies and other selections to review on Pirate Bay, it is a complete distraction and waste of time to be forced to look for further information when it can easily be posted right here in front of you.  I lost count how many times I googled something and when I get to the webpage, the information I wanted is nowhere to be found, only misleading links that open up yet more webpages of useless, unwanted information.  The same applies here for time being wasted."
