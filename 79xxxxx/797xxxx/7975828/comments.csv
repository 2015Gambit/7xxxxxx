,riverchase,2012-12-31T21:41Z,Have you heard of Ash from the defunct Event Comics. I can't find anything about how the story ended.
[T],blackcanary,2012-12-31T22:45Z,"riverchase, I have the series.  Do you just want Ash #0-6 from Event Comics or do you also want Ash: The Fire Within 1-2, Ash: Cinder & Smoke 1-6, Ash: Fire and Crossfire 1-2, the crossovers with 22 Brides (2 issues), Azrael (1 issue), and Cyberforce (2 issues), and the issues from Wizard?"
