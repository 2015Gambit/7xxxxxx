Christopher de Leon, Dina Bonnevie, Lani Mercado, Jacklyn Jose, Ricky Davao, Megan Young and Valerie Concepcion. This list of actors is nothing short of a casting coup; one that any movie company would certainly brag about.

Flames of Love is a multi-plot story that tackles the pressing issues surrounding the modern-day family. Listed by Nebrida, they are, among others, drug addiction, infidelity, promiscuity and even abortion.
