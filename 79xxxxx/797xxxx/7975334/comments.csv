,MusicNutt,2013-01-01T18:44Z,Thx Nepotu for all the killer Skins ups. ;) You don't by chance have weeks 2&15?
,pdogemp,2013-01-02T00:44Z,MKV File? what kind of file is that cause i cant watch it on my Media Player. 
[V],Nepotu,2013-01-02T16:15Z,"You're all welcome, guyz! I didn't cut the intro, was the ripper's call. MKV it's very good format who increase the quality and decrese the size of the file. Try to DL some new codecs and will work. Weeks 2 & 15, what about it? Whay do you mean?"
