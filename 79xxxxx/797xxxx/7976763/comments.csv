Reports:

Jan 1st - 16/19 (best of part one)
Jan 4th - 17/19 (best of part two)
Jan 11th - 15/19 (Jolly)

There's a chance that the two ""best of"" won't show up
I'm personally not interested in clip shows.
But if they show up, I'll probably post them."

hey thanks......
not to cocern with best of either (but I will get them if see them)
It looks like someone has posted a complation type show last week....(S10-E15)...could be a fake?
I watch it and it played O K....not sure its official though... will keep my eyes open for your post thanks again!"

Don't mistake my posting of this S10E15 as proof of its legitimacy. You're right that there's something screwey about it. It has the VG and it is a clip show - except that ep isn't advertised as such.. also, three in a row seems a bit much and mislabeled at tthat. Not that the BBC is doing any better - a week late on an XL and they're releasing their S10E15 a week after 16 & 17. I think what really bums me is lsoing out on at leas three XL opportunities.
