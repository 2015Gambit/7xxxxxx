For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, pure guesswork for iPlayer source:
V=7.5
A=7.5
.
johncymru is either very late or AWOL, so I'm going with this one.
From one kind anonymous soul's iPlayer version off of UseNet.
Source was x264 700Kbps, so I've encoded to XVID 666.
At least download will be faster.
