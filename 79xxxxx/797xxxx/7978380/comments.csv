,whadjasai,2013-01-01T21:26Z,"Yea, ep7 !
Maybe there's something there that Oliver Stone doesn't WANT us to see."
,blajas,2013-01-01T21:40Z,silly people that episode was never uploaded anywhere for some reason. My guess is that people didn't realized the show was still airing over the Christmas holiday

,dimitri71,2013-01-03T08:46Z,There has got to be some way to find a source for episode 7.
[T],theburningbush,2013-01-03T22:54Z,"According to http://www.sho.com/sho/oliver-stones-untold-history-of-the-united-states/season/1/episode/7#/index , any Showtime subscriber with either ""On Demand"" or ""Showtime Anytime"" service -- and the ability to capture from the service -- has until 05-Feb-2013 to get episode 7."
