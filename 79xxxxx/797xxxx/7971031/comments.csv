,Aryl,2012-12-30T05:40Z,"Thanks Acesn8s, I was just going to try and rip this from amazon.

No seeds though :(

I'll seed for as long as I can if I can get this downloaded. This movie fucked my mind.

Not as good as the book, lots of stuff left out and/or changed- But given the hour and a half it is, they could not have possibly done a better job in that timeframe.

Just remember. THAT DOOR CANNOT BE OPENED!"
,ShockIce,2012-12-30T06:47Z,"Thanks for the upload, but definitely check out David Wong's statement regarding pirating this film on Cracked - Support the independent artist when/where you can. "
,crwildman,2012-12-30T06:49Z,"What has been seen cannot be unseen..

Just remember that before watching this movie.

Wonder what happens at the End?  John Dies.   lol"
,mcgrrarg,2012-12-30T06:53Z,"Thank you! I actually paid the ten bucks to rent this on iTunes the day it was released, but I really wanted to watch it again. 

So not as good as the book, but a fun movie, anyway."
,2dgeek,2012-12-30T07:32Z,"Thanks for the upload! about to finish the book.. which i started reading only because i saw the trailer and couldnt wait for the movie to come out.

,flare561,2012-12-30T08:11Z,You know I literally just finished ripping this from amazon? Your's is probably a much higher quality rip though.
,radrian,2012-12-30T11:10Z,"Time to get blasted and watch this fine gem, thank you."

,bunksteve,2012-12-30T18:00Z,"Just wanted to reiterate what some people have been saying on here: This is a low-budget. indie movie. If you download it and like it, then please rent it on iTunes or something. 

I personally want them to keep making movies like these."

Really good movie and quality, thanks for the upload! If it comes to my country I'll buy it"
,MalikeW,2013-01-01T08:48Z,"Best 10 bucks I have spent on Amazon in a long time. Worth paying for.  Seriously, its only 10 bucks."
,blowout1977,2013-01-01T10:32Z,"Truely one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen. Dorky and boring. I watched about 15min of it and just couldnt take it anymore.

,damndl0ser,2013-01-01T23:05Z,"I usually try and support all the movies I ""pirate"".  But if I don't have the cash I support the ones I enjoyed the most.  So if I enjoy this I will certainly try and support it.  Esp.. Since its an indie flick, which I appreciate more than most do.  "

A 10 V 10 M what did I just sit thru? Why? Because of these bullshit reviews! This movie sucks, and your all dicks for lying about that!"
,iveseenitall,2013-01-03T07:55Z,"I'm still upset about this, fa real. Fuck you nerds! I had to delete this off my hard drive before I punched my laptop in it's face! Straight garbage. Just watch the SYFY channel if you want low budget cornball shit like this to throw up in your brain. It's not even clever, the multi dimension aspect was just used as an excuse to not make sense, and suck it hard. AHHHH!!"

Definitely felt like the movie was too rushed, do check out the book if you're at all interested in seeing the story make much more sense and become more fleshed out. 

Do try and support the film/book, too, where you can. I'm fortunate enough to have a screening next month in my city, though for folks in the UK or Canada, they don't even get it available for rental in iTunes. Check out the book!"

,yerk55,2013-01-06T00:06Z,"Yes please support this franchise. Im only downloading this because my iTunes rental has no audio and I couldnt resolve it. I will pay the rental fee for as many times as I decide to watch this until I can own the bluray.

Book was amazing, reading it the 2nd time around before watching this."

LOVE the books. But this film is utter garbage from the script through to the bad director choices. 

I really wanted to like it. 

Thanks for the UL though :)"
