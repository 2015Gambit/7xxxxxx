Twelve great Irish Drinking Songs performed by The Shannon Clovers. I received this disc from an ex-girlfriend years ago and any time I'm kicking back some brews I love to pop this in and dance a jig! Many of these songs are renditions of old classics and they are done very well. The vocals and instrumentals are really captivating and you just kinda lose yourself in the track. There are plenty of ironic and funny sayings throughout and it's a great play thru and thru.
