Hiren's Boot DVD 15.2 Restored Edition V 1.0 (January 2013)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

HirenΓÇÖs Boot CD is a vast collection of bootable and portable
utilities for the management, diagnosis and repair of computer
problems, recover lost or deleted files or cracking passwords. There
is no computer problem for which HBCD does not have at least one tool
to help with its solution. In addition, HBCD provides the means to
take control of any computer and communicate with other computers,
surf the internet, write documents or programs, without booting the
installed operating system. There are literally hundreds of utilities
and it is advised that you explore the contents before the need for
it arises. 


This Restored DVD by Proteus includes all the utilities found in the latest
HirenΓÇÖs Boot CD 15.2 (December 2012). [1] with many of the utilities
updated to their latest version. It is called Restored because it
contains all the commercial utilities omitted from the official
releases (since version 11.0.) It also includes other tools such by
Acronis, Paragon, Active@, and other useful software fully integrated
within HirenΓÇÖs menus.
