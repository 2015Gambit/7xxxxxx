This album is Martha WainwrightΓÇÖs first collection of original music in four years and was produced by Yuka C. Honda of Cibo Matto.  Recorded earlier this year, mostly at Sean LennonΓÇÖs home studio in New York City, Come Home To Mama displays the passionate angst of her 2005 eponymous debut coupled with the twisted pop of 2008ΓÇÖs I Know Your Married But IΓÇÖve Got Feelings Too.  Yuka and Martha have created an edgy, multi-instrumental soundscape that showcases MarthaΓÇÖs raw, confessional poetry with undeniable style and grace.  The captivating 10-song set features performances from Yuka Honda, Nels Cline (Wilco), Sean Lennon, Jim White (Dirty Three), Brad Albetta and Thomas Bartlett (Doveman). (marthawainwright.com)
