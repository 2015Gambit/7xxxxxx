,Puxes,2013-01-03T04:39Z,Thank you soo much admz0r! Hope you have a happy new years and thanks for everything this year dude :)
,SizzlinSlice,2013-01-03T22:08Z,"Thanks for this admz0r. I've been using your Sims stuff ever since it came out without any issues. However..

Is anyone having a problem with using the Minus One Kelvin refrigerator and Multitab 6000 after updating the fixer files? I'm hoping that I'm not the only one experiencing this."
,SizzlinSlice,2013-01-03T22:27Z,Are we not allowed to ask about problems or something? I wanted to know if more people were having an issue with the Minus One Kelvin fridge and the Multitab besides myself after updating the fixer files. Not asking for a solution.
[T],AncientRome,2013-01-06T06:27Z,"Thank you for the store content, but I think you should stop providing the store fixes and start promoting Fixed Images.

That way users will start using the sims3launcher to automatically update their game and receive content patches without having to worry about cracked files and where to put these fixes.

Also, the fixed files keep forcing the launcher to try and download the latest content patches which it had already installed. These monthly fixes are the reason why the game keeps lagging so much for me.

Not the best report, but the store content is working great. :)"
,L.Madness,2013-01-09T11:53Z,the Fixes still don't work for me!!! :|
