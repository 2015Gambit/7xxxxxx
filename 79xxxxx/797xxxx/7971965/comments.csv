,love404,2013-01-01T00:29Z,"I believe this patch isn't complete- after completing activation, exit QuickBooks and change your computer's date to 2 months ahead (make sure ""automatically sync with internet time server"" is off your date/time will be readjusted), now open QuickBooks- the message I get is:

""QuickBooks has reached the expiration date and will no longer open company files.""

Trying to re-activate right before or after expiration doesn't work either.

Anyone else can test this?"

,piratedawg75,2013-01-10T16:58Z,"@dechronic:

Hi dechronic, maybe you can take a look at AccuPOS 2013?

AccuPOS 2013 is a good program to crack for restaurant owners.

I hope it will work just like AccuPOS 2010, but it's quite old and buggy already.

Will donate for this. Thanks! "
