This activation patch was made possible because of the information 
provided by means of Beast_iND's activator/patcher and based on the
information provided by microbolt.

All thanks therefore go to them.

This patch should only be a temporary solution until Beast_iND
releases a newer version of his patcher that includes support for
Quickbooks 2013, I personally still prefer his patcher, as his patcher
is comprehensive, as it also supports older versions of Quickbooks.

Changes since the previous versions:

v0.14 (Working)
Versions 0.12 and 0.13 are just not working.
I have just lightened up the code, since the way Windows repairs itself, the program I use to close any open programs should always be present. I therefore took out  the checks for that file, which were causing problems.
I need to learn a language that can be compiled. 


v0.13 (Scrapped)
Added a bracket so that it actually works again as version 0.12 is broken.
I should run at least a test on it before releasing it. Very sorry to all who were frustrated with the last version 0.12. 
I guess I haven't gotten enough sleep yet.


v0.12 (Scrapped)
Changed a couple of lines of code to fix the unnecessary messages that appear at times due to ending parts of the code prematurely.
Due to completely to a lack of sleep and writing the code going to bed, If I remember correctly. I am sorry about that and I hope this will alleviate any confusion.


v0.11
Added the possibility to automatically close any open Quickbooks or Intuit programs that may interfere with the backing up, replacing and restoring of the patched file, provided a certain Windows program exists.
