Harbinger is/as a local band hailing from Cookeville, TN. Formerly known as The Iron Sea (of which I was a member), Harbinger is a four-piece progressive rock/metal band that I truly believe deserve a massive audience. They're on a bit of a hiatus as of now, but perhaps they'll gain their confidence back if their fanbase grows to the size is should. 

Recorded and soft-released in 2010, The Incoming Outcome is Harbinger's first full length album. I guarantee you'll never hear anything quite like it, so please share this with everyone you know, friends, and family. If you enjoy it enough, purchasing the album on iTunes would be mighty fine of you. Either way, enjoy!
