Here is a series of anecdotes by a registered nurse (nicknamed Nurse-kun) who posted on 4chan's /b/ board for years about his story with his patient, a little 7 year old girl (nicknamed Ampu-tan) who was in a severe car accident which took her parents, and crippled her for life.  Be aware that this is a story for hardened hearts. It was posted to a website where rape jokes and pornographic subtexts are par for the course, and you will see plenty of these. Nevertheless, it develops into something beautiful as you go along.  You must be well-versed in internet culture (especially 4chan culture) to understand the full depth of this story (3deep5u), but even if you aren't an oldfag you may still enjoy it (if you can stomach it, this IS 4chan after all).  While no one can verify the authenticity of the story completely, some people swear by it.

Basically, this torrent is a copy of all the 4chan threads in which Nurse-kun posted about his story, along with the fanart created in the threads.  It's quite well-known to oldfags.
