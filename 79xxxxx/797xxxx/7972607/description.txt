What if Star Wars as we know it didn't exist, but instead the plot of the movies was being made up on the spot by players of a Tabletop Game?
Well, for one, the results might actually make a lot more sense, from an out-of-story point of view...
Darths & Droids is a webcomic created by The Comic Irregulars (David Morgan-Mar and seven of his friends from work), following the footsteps of DM of the Rings, which used a similar premise for The Lord of the Rings. However, while DOTR featured a railroading GM herding a bunch of bored Munchkin players with an iron fist, Darths & Droids has a more tolerant GM, who's willing to let the players get Off the Rails and contribute to the development of the setting, if that's what it takes to have a fun and interesting game. Indeed, the very plot of Star Wars, with all its inconsistencies and bizarre leaps of logic, comes along because the players constantly force the GM to improvise.
