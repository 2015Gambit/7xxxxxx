It's about assassins, see trailer-looks nice, english .srt file included

Uploader Note: First happy new year and thanks to downloaders and pirateships captains, second
for the movie/quality-movie was a dissapointment if you ask me...after so much years it deserved
to be much better as the previous lotr parts...i was to cinema and about 4 times i almost asleep
same old story Hollywood...anyway quality it's pretty good-have lots of small watermarks so if
you really want to watch it wait for a real dvdrip/bluray, download and decide...and maybe it's
time to create some quality movies like last movies watched by me tonight"The Host (2006),
Memories Of Murder (2003), not same type but some movies worthing the MONEY SPENT, see ya
till next time
