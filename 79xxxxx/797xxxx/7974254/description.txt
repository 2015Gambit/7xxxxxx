Notes: I'm sorry for my hiatus; internet troubles and with the holidays and all it has been a busy winter for me. I figured I would upload something small. :) I'm going to do a Staind discography next and then I will get to request. You can always request something in the comments but that does not mean I will do it.

Enjoy this amazing EP! Aaron Lewis is a very talented man and if you enjoyed this album please support him and buy the EP. You can find it on Amazon for 3 bucks. It isn't like you have to sell an arm and a leg.
