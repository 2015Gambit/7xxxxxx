Read minds. Bend steel. Break all the rules. Teenager Pete Stanchek is out of work, on the skids, and-- unbeknownst to him-- a psionic-powered harbinger with the potential to reshape the course of human history. Toyo Harada is a wealthy business magnate, a respected philanthropist and the most powerful harbinger of all-- or so he thought. As they forge an uneasy alliance, will Harada offer Pete a chance for redemption-- or attempt to induct him into a secret network of conspiracy, subversion and control? Pete is about to discover that he's not alone in the world and, soon, the generation who has nothing will take on the man who has everything.
