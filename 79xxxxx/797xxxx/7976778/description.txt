So these are all the maps from Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, and both their sequels. I fixed as best I can a problem with the green textures on the water of Balur's Gate 1. They are in jpeg format with minimal quality loss.

These are NOT the maps used in the mini-map. These are the large resolution textures used in the main game. To my knowledge, I am the only one who is providing these. Therefore, get this data spread out and distributed.

If you have any questions, comment on pirate bay. Check out the other torrents I have, they might be useful, as they're all related. Let me know if you like this by commenting and seeding. This is a niche market, so seeders would be great.
