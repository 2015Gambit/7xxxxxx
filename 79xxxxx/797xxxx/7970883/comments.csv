You can test your setupcomplete.cmd by putting the files from the directory in your windows_setup_scripts directory and running it as admin.  If it installs your loader, reboots, and deletes the scripts directory you should be good to go."

Is there a program or a way to change the wallpaper on Windows 8 on the app side, to add your own wallpaper NOT any of the windows wallpapers?? Thanks"

There's no such thing as a stupid question but you sure do push the limits. I've seen you post dozens of questions that can be answered with a Google search.

I linked you to your answer. You're welcome:

First off I did Google it unlike you did.

Second off at least I post questions that make sense since your website took you to a blank page.

Third...go play in the middle of the tracks so people like you don't look like a dump as*!

Final go elsewhere to post spam you retard!!!

It's glaringly obvious that you don't know about the anti-spam bot that filters out hyperlinks (and how to get around it). You are new here.

The only thing you have accomplished here is embarrassing yourself; I'm quite surprised natural selection hasn't punched your card yet.

I'll bet you the contents of my wallet that the current url in the address bar reads ""thepiratebay"" and not google search. We are not your personal Google army answering your ""how to change my background to pretty ponies"" question on a torrent that activates Windows.

Before you open your mouth to comment or reply I implore you to run it by somebody else first."
[T],murphy78,2012-12-31T22:13Z,"Lets keep it civil guys. Onion is right in that the windows loader torrent comment page is not the best place to ask about windows 8 advice, but I could see why sonic would ask it here.  If I couldn't figure out something like that by doing a few searches, I'd start asking places where I know there are some experts lurking.

Anyhow, I'm still seeding the monster Christmas torrents, so I really won't be getting a lot done until January patch date.

But to bribe off any people who may be tempted to keep up any acrimony, I will say that I am going to make an xdelta patch for windows loader pre-loaded versions of windows 7 ultimate sp1 for this coming patch date.  I will include the xdelta program and the xdeltaui program.

I will do this, if and only if we all make nice.
So there you go guys, incentive to let it go :)"

I'm glad you enjoy mother jokes on the internet; you would also enjoy r/imfourteenandthisisfunny and xbox live!"

Much appreciated!  :)

Just curious though, will you be upping a updated Win7 disc set again like the October releases?

The x64/x86 AIO disc is great for USB installs, saves allot of time and disc carrying.  ;)"
[T],murphy78,2013-01-08T05:28Z,"yes cha, I got distracted this month will all the work and testing I was doing, but I think I'm just going to stick with English language stuff with all-in-one releases and stuff.

I should start working on this stuff tomorrow if it's patch date like I think it will be."
