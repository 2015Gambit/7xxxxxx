Flock of Dodos: Behind Modern Creationism, Intelligent Design and the Easter Bunny

What is creationism? Is it science, theology, both, neither? Who's behind it? And why should you give a damn in the first place? Ex-National Lampooner Barrett Brown and Professor of Sociology Jon P. Alston, Ph.D, answer these questions, and perhaps one of two more, in a superbly unorthodox, serenely offensive and splendidly hilarious look at the forces behind the most talked-about pseudo-theory in modern history.
