Notes About the Release: Getting Requestions in my PM boxes please NLU rencode this one.
Because the other NLtoppers Release sucks.
And i check that and it is true.
1. There lying about the DD5.1 = DD2.0
2. There cannot tell if it is NTSC or PAl there say in there info Fps 23.796 lol it is 25.000
3. Did A lot of NL Subtitles corrections because there were lines show as 5 lines
