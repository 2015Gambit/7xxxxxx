Plot
   When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides 
to take his place in a mission on the distant world of Pandora. There he learns 
of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of driving off the 
native humanoid "Na'vi" in order to mine for the precious material scattered 
throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal surgery that will fix 
his legs, Jake gathers intel for the cooperating military unit spearheaded by 
gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the 
Na'vi people with the use of an "avatar" identity. While Jake begins to bond 
with the native tribe and quickly falls in love with the beautiful alien 
Neytiri, the restless Colonel moves forward with his ruthless extermination 
tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand - and fight back in an epic battle 
for the fate of Pandora.
