A new classic, cited by leaders and media around the globe as a highly recommended read for anyone interested in innovation.
 
In The InnovatorΓÇÖs DNA, authors Jeffrey Dyer, Hal Gregersen, and bestselling author Clayton Christensen (The InnovatorΓÇÖs Dilemma, The InnovatorΓÇÖs Solution, How Will You Measure Your Life?) build on what we know about disruptive innovation to show how individuals can develop the skills necessary to move progressively from idea to impact.
 
By identifying behaviors of the worldΓÇÖs best innovatorsΓÇöfrom leaders at Amazon and Apple to those at Google, Skype, and Virgin GroupΓÇöthe authors outline five discovery skills that distinguish innovative entrepreneurs and executives from ordinary managers: Associating, Questioning, Observing, Networking, and Experimenting.
 
Once you master these competencies (the authors provide a self-assessment for rating your own innovatorΓÇÖs DNA), the authors explain how to generate ideas, collaborate to implement them, and build innovation skills throughout the organization to result in a competitive edge. This innovation advantage will translate into a premium in your companyΓÇÖs stock priceΓÇöan innovation premiumΓÇöwhich is possible only by building the code for innovation right into your organizationΓÇÖs people, processes, and guiding philosophies.
 
Practical and provocative, The InnovatorΓÇÖs DNA is an essential resource for individuals and teams who want to strengthen their innovative prowess.
