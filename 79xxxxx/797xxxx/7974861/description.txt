Avengers vs. X-Men (linear edit)

This is the Marvel crossover "Avengers vs. X-Men", presented in a format where you can start at the beginning, read through the chapters in order, and enjoy the whole story even if you've never read a Marvel comic before in your life. The many issues of the crossover, written by countless writers and artists, have been edited together to form a seamless novelistic reading experience. Scenes which were redundant or slowed down the pace too much have been left on the cutting room floor, pages were reformatted and combined with other pages, and what's left is a fast-paced but epic superhero war story, over a thousand pages in 27 chapters.

This is how Marvel would be presenting their comics digitally, if they actually cared about digital.
