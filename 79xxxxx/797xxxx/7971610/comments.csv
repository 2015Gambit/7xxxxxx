,Xigor,2012-12-31T21:51Z,Whats the difference between this and the free version?
,nomonija,2013-01-01T01:57Z,"Xigor, you have some levels which can be played only if you pay 5$ for them (something like donation).
How to save progress in game? When i close web browser and start the game again i have to go all from the start. Any help is great."
