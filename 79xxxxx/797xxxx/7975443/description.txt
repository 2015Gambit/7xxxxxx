For those of you who have never heard of the man (Tiesto) he is the number ONE Dj in the world!
Most of you will recognise his performance at the Athens Olympic Games, which is only a small glimpse of what his really capable of!
This man has topped the Dj Mag awards for the 3 year in a row and doesn't look like giving up the crown just yet!
