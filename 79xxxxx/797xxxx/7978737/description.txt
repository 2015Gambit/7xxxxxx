The Diary of a Nobody (2007 BBC) DVD Rip aac x264 mp4


starring Hugh Bonneville


adapted from the novel by George and Weedon Grossmith


In this one-man-show, Bonneville portrays the fictional Mr. Pooter, who in 1891 decides that as he has read the published diaries of people of whom he has not heard, why should others not one day enjoy reading his. The mundane becomes dryly humourous in this account of a middle-class London clerk, his wife and 20 year old son, and the coming and goings of their friends Messers. Gowing and Cummings.
