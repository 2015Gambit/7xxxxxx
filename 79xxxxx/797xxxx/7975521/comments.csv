However I'm open to suggestions regarding anything, not that I'll respond but I will take comments on board.

I saw in a comment on a Spock upload that this was hard to get so it's nice to be able to give something back to the community. ZZZ"

I've picked up a few over the 90's but lost them to water damage...or beer, and ex-girlfriends trashing my belongings...guess i relate to these stories a bit. Anyway, any Thompkins or Charles Burns work is greatly appreciated"
