Release Info:

The undead are multiplying and filling the streets of Tokyo's red light
district. The area is quarantined quickly, but degenerates into a district
full of terror, panic and devastation. Survivors try to flee the city, but
four men rise up to protect those they care most about. If you think
zombies are bad, meet the Yakuza.

As they run through the battle-scarred streets and witness the scale of the
destruction, they are seen as the final hope for the remaining residents of
the city as they kick, snipe, batter and bulldoze their way through the
hordes of zombies.

Immerse yourself in the Kamurocho experience as the true to life recreation
of Tokyo's sin-city district faces its greatest threat. Unravel the story
as you play through the eyes of four characters, form alliances, and work
together to save Japan from the zombie apocalypse.

From Zombie table tennis to gunning down the walking dead on a date with
a beautiful hostess, all the side missions, clubs, karaoke, bars, dungeon
crawling, and more are back.

The revered Kazuma Kiryu and Shun Akiyama return, now joined by Goro
"Mad-dog" Majima and Ryuji Goda, the Dragon of Kansai.

Unleash new devastation. Use the all-new heat-snipe to unleash chaos in
the face of hordes of zombies.

The Yakuza franchise takes an exciting new twist with an all-new 3rd
person shooting mechanic, a wide array of guns and upgrades, and a city
packed full of the undead.
