Description:
The Grand Design is a popular-science book written by physicists Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow. It argues that invoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the universe, and that the Big Bang is a consequence of the laws of physics alone. In response to criticism, Hawking has said; "One can't prove that God doesn't exist, but science makes God unnecessary." The authors of the book point out that a Unified Field Theory (a theory, based on an early model of the universe, proposed by Albert Einstein and other physicists) may not exist. The book examines the history of scientific knowledge about the universe and explains 11 dimension M-theory, a theory many modern physicists support.

I've made this version myself using widespread 320kbps CD-rip files.

Changes in this properly cut version:
1) much smaller files in comparison with those jumbo hour-long versions
2) chapter-related names with chunk-subnumbers for convenient navigation
3) no CD-related numbers, cuz, hey, who gives a shit about them?
4) adequate Mp3-tags for media-library based players
5) fine-tuned converted smaller size 192kbps files with yet the same quality

Enjoy!
