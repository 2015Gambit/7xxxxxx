----------------------------------------------


Principles of Macroeconomics, Sixth Edition, became a best seller after its introduction and continues to be the most popular and widely used text in the economics classroom. Instructors found it the perfect complement to their teaching. A text by a superb writer and economist that stressed the most important concepts without overwhelming students with an excess of detail was a formula that was quickly imitated, but has yet to be matched.

The sixth edition features a strong revision of content in all twenty-three chapters. Dozens of new applications emphasize the real-world relevance of economics for today's students through interesting news articles, realistic case studies, and engaging problems.

The premier ancillary package is the most extensive in the industry, using a team of instructors/preparers that have been with the project since the first edition. The text material is again fully integrated into Aplia, the best-selling online homework solution.
