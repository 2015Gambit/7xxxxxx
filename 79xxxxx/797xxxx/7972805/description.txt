About the Game:

The Darkness II is a psychological horror first-person shooter with light role-playing elements developed by Digital Extremes and published by 2K Games. 
The game is the sequel to 2007's The Darkness. The script for the game was written by comic book writer Paul Jenkins, who previously worked on The Darkness comic series.
The Darkness II plays similarly to its predecessor, but with the introduction of new features such as "quad wielding," a technique which allows Jackie to use both the Darkness' "Creeping Dark" tendrils and firearms simultaneously. 
The player has access to one Darkling, who is involved in the plot and useful in various situations. 
The player can use the "Creeping Dark" tendrils to slash or pick up enemies for executions or to simply throw them, or various items within the environment (parking meters, car doors, ect) and use them as projectile weapons or shields. 
Each kill, discovered relic, and execution earns the player Essence, which allows players to purchase new abilities from Talent Shrines. 
Devouring hearts restores Jackie's health and earns Essence.
Like the previous game, Jackie loses his powers in the light, though in this game light also causes Jackie's vision to brightly blur and is coupled with a high-pitched ringing....
