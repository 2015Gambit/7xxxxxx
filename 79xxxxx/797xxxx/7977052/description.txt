The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion is a wide-ranging, comparative study of mythology and religion, written by the Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer (1854ΓÇô1941). It was first published in two volumes in 1890; in three volumes in 1900; and the third edition, published 1906ΓÇô15, comprised twelve volumes.

Frazer offered a modernist approach to discussing religion, treating it dispassionately as a cultural phenomenon rather than from a theological perspective. The influence of The Golden Bough on contemporary European literature and thought was substantial.
