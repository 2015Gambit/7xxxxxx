So this one was a bit difficult to figure out. Finally did after a lot
of searching. I'm not going to name the source, as to not call WOTC's
attention to them.

In one folder is the original stuff, it has in there a very old
version of PCGen. Work with me here... the stuff from CMP is old. Very
old. There are legal reasons why this is, I'm not going to go into
them. You're likely good with computers to throw this stuff together,
just accept the struggle for a while, and only use Java 6, not 7.

The other folder is my installation. It has all of CMP's stuff 
installed already, with the added bonus of everything eslse being in
there and working (basically CMP recommended a way of doing something,
I didn't understand their reasoning and did it my way which worked).

Good luck. I'm putting this up because I noticed no one else offered
them, and others that did had broken delievery systems. I hope that
it will make the ease of getting these matterals better.
