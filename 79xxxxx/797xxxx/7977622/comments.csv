,suiteo,2013-01-01T16:56Z,Plot? IMDB Link??? Without either of these two items (not to mention the technical specs of the video itself) it's a complete waste of time.  If you can't be bothered to be informative then I just can't be bothered with any of your downloads.
,KjellzTPB,2013-01-01T18:01Z,"Yes, its the same as IMDBs. Only I made it extracted it at posted an .avi file, for I cant understand the rar thing. Its just for making it easyer for the green-headed like my gilfriend to download and wach without any pc-skills..."
,forestarmike,2013-01-01T19:07Z,"for gods sake ""suiteo"" just download the movie and see for yourself!  These people make it possible for us to see movies we couldnt otherwise see.  Have a little respect & patience, please!"
