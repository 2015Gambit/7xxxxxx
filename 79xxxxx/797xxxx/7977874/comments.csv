I download most of your game is good but like mass effect 3 seriously there is no sound abd voice, game works... I'm using 2011 mac n is on lion... by the way cos i port mass effect 3 using wineskin it works but there is a game crash. mayb when u used cider for mass effect 3 mayb something is wrong with cider which make the game has no voice when other people download. by the way im still new to porting and im trying hard to wineskin fifa manager 13... by any chance u can create fifa manager 13 for mac/eng/. by the way good job on getting more games for mac community...."
