Queen Victoria and Prince Albert shared a passionate marriage. Behind closed 
doors, royal domestic life often seemed like a battlefield. 

In a 60-year family saga this new three-part series explores the reign of 
Victoria through her personal relationships with her husband and her nine 
children. It is a story of manipulation, conflict, intimidation, emotional 
blackmail, and fevered attempts by her children to escape the clutches of their 
domineering and needy mother.

The series uses a wealth of written material and photos left by Victoria, 
Albert and their children, including letters, diaries, memoirs and journals, to 
bring the subject and characters to life. 

This first episode focuses on Victoria's tempestuous relationship with Prince 
Albert, their attempts to engineer the upbringing of their children and to save 
the monarchy by projecting a modern image of the royal family.
