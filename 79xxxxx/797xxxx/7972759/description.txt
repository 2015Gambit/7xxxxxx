Mayhem is largely a derby racer. YouΓÇÖll be racing on very small tracks with a variety of cars ranging from muscle cars to monster trucks. ThereΓÇÖs three modes to play: Banger Race (which is the small track racing), Demolition Derby (which requires you to smash your opponents and be the last man standing), and Domination (which asks you to push your opponents off a circuit). ThereΓÇÖs a career mode in here that primarily requires you to complete various difficulties of said three gametypes.
