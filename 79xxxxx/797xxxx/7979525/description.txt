NOTES: 
first of missing 2 minutes at the very start!! Cropped borders, rotated, 
Then resized aliitle as resolution was so small after the cropping, think 
i have the AR right hard to tell with these rips, appends a smoother on 
the video to help with the resizing and added some sharpens after that... 
tweaked other thigns to like levels, colours, contrast... Theres a couple 
of watermarks that appear but most of the time not that noticeable. Audio 
well its good clear but abit hollow. Anyway check sample and enjoy :-)

Long Live The - RESiSTANCE
