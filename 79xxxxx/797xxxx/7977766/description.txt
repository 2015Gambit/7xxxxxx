Unsafe Sex in the City
BBC's fly on the wall documentary about Manchester's irresponsible youth was both compelling viewing and shocking. As they say, you can't script stuff like this, and it's certainly not a show you'd want to watch with your dinner. It's estimated that there are over 22,000 people living in the UK with HIV, and many, many more with various forms of STIs. Over 6000 new STIs are being diagnosed every week and are on the increase. Kervin, a 22 year odd security guard, didn't use a condom on a one night stand, got a bad dose of Gonorrhea (over 20,000 have it in the UK) and now has to explain it to both his brief shag and his long term girlfriend. How do you tell her that you've been unfaithful and given her the clap?




3)  Part 3 
John comes into the clinic hoping he won't be diagnosed with chlamydia for an astonishing fourth time, clinic staff provide sexual health care for the inmates of maximum security jail HMP Manchester and, after a drunken one night stand, 26-year-old student Ben tries to persuade his girlfriend to lift a sex ban by proving he's still STI-free.
