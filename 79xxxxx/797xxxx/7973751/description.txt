Show Description
................

On the riveting Sunday, December 30 transmission of Infowars Live, Alex Jones analyzes Obama's Meet the Press interview in which he continued milking the Newtown tragedy for all it's worth, promising to put his "full weight" behind an assault rifle ban that would affect the rights of millions of law-abiding, gun-owning Americans. He'll also talk to Piers Morgan's penned response in the Daily Mail threatening to leave the U.S. if the Second Amendment was not scaled back significantly. Alex will also break down the criminality of insider trading funding the globalists' takeover, and the imminent "fiscal cliff" implications come January 1, 2013.
