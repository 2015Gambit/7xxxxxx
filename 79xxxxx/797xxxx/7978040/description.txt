Ten series of The Teaching Company (The Great Courses) lectures by Prof. Robert Greenberg covering Beethoven, Brahms,Haydn, Liszt, Mahler, Mozart, Robert & Clara Schumann, Shostakovich, Stravinsky, and Tchaikovsky.

All these lectures have been around for years, but often broken up into 5 minute sections that were inconvenient for listening.  I merged all these smaller sections to complete each individual lecture and then completed correcting all the properties.  If this isn't appreciated by the music lover then I don't know what is.  Enjoy!
