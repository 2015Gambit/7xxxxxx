A fresh new voice from the left issues a smart, funny challenge to stop the idiocy!
 
  Author Joe Marconi exposes the folly and downright stupidity spilling from a cornucopia of public liars and self-important dolts whose illogic, opacity, and invective are cluttering up AmericaΓÇÖs public discourse. 
 
 
Exposing the curious logic of Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Dr. Laura Schlesinger, and Michael Savage, along with Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, and other Republican presidential hopefuls, Cultural Idiocy is as laugh-out-loud funny as it is thought provoking. YouΓÇÖll wonder how people who say and do the most inane and often malicious things become honored as ΓÇ£leaders.ΓÇ¥ 
 
 
 
With a dry, biting wit, Marconi probes the absurdities of political hate-speak, self-righteous ΓÇ£family valuesΓÇ¥ posturing, Fox News distortions, and that all-purpose non-apology, ΓÇ£Mistakes were made.ΓÇ¥ YouΓÇÖll wish that you could force-feed Cultural Idiocy to all of your conservative friends before the next time politics comes up in conversation.
