Storyline:
The passage from this world to the fantasy kingdom of Stormhold is through a breach in a wall beside an English village.
In the 1800s, a boy becomes a man when he ventures through the breech in pursuit of a fallen star, to prove his love for the village beauty.
The star is no lump of rock, it's a maiden, Yvaine. Tristan, the youth, is not the only one looking for her: three witches,
led by Lamia, want her heart to make them young; and, the sons of the dead king of Stormhold want her
because she holds a ruby that will give one of them title to the throne.
Assisting Tristan are his mother, the victim of a spell, and a transvestite pirate of the skies.
Will Tristan win his true love?
