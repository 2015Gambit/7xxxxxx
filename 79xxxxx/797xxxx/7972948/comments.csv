,grendelkhan69,2012-12-31T03:01Z,"Dunno. Says it's from the iTunes release and I checked and sure enough, it's available for rental before it's in theaters. Downloading now, will report back if it's for realz. "
,phase700b,2012-12-31T06:29Z,Of course it's real. DownTYU uploads are always top quality. You guys must be new around here.
,grendelkhan69,2012-12-31T18:06Z,"Yup, it's legit. And I'd never heard of the DownTYU and publichd guys before, but they're on my radar now! Quality is dynamite, going to watch it tonight!"

,horea88,2013-01-01T05:41Z,Totally legit! Full 1080p. Thanks DownTYU!
,nobodynever,2013-01-01T09:00Z,One of the weirdest movies I've ever seen.  And I've seen Mulholland Drive.
