The legendary Knytt series continues with Nifflas latest
creation; Knytt Underground
In this Knytteration; humans have long since abandoned
the planet after practically destroying it in a war
five hundred years ago. The remaining population of
Sprites, Fairies (and various other life forms) now live
in mysterious tunnels underground where they are
trying to discover the secrets of their origin and the
meaning of life

Mixed up in all of this curiosity is Mi - a mute but
extraordinary sprite! She develops special powers as the
game progresses and embarks upon many exciting quests on
her adventure. Her main goal is to find and ring the six
bells of fate before time runs out. If she doesn't a
destructive chain reaction will begin that will
obliterate the entire planet! There's one small detail
though; the odds are it's just a superstitious nonsense
and the world isn't really ending
