If you're Jaime Rubirosa, I have to ask - why are you posting your own ebook on TPB? Won't that hurt your Amazon sales?"

I'm putting my little book on here because I'm tired of stupid legislation, greedy corporations, and terrible DRM.

I believe in the sharing community. If somebody reads my book and enjoys it, that's enough to make me happy. And if somebody reads my book and loves it, I trust them to vote with their wallet, if they can (and if they can't right now, that's fine too).

I'm not the first, anyway. Just the latest:
