THE AGENT

Anna Creighton travels the globe, in the shadow of wealth and power. To some, she is the perfect, devoted girlfriend; to others, a ravenous courtesan. But only a handful of people know the truth: Anna is a secret agent, a modern day Mata Hari, gifted in the art of seduction, willing to do whatever it takes to complete her assignment!

THE MISSION

When a year-long investigation threatens to unravel, a desperate covert agency turns to Anna for help. At first, her task seems simple enough: seduce a wealthy banker, and keep him working as an informant. Soon, however, Anna soon discovers there's more to the job -- and her target -- than she could have ever imagined. 

Now, the two are locked in a deadly erotic game, and the only way Anna can maintain her cover is by satisfying him in every way -- but as their passions rise, will the secrets they carry destroy them both?

This dark 10,000 word espionage tale contains explicit sexual scenes of domination, psychological manipulation, and non-consensual play.
