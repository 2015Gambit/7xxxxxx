:: WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES

When first initiated this script checks that your internett connection is up, if not waits for it.
Then checks that your VPN service is running. 
If not it shuts down your torrentclient and tries to restart the VPN service. 
If successfull it will restart your torrentclient
In short it not only checks that you never use your 
torrentclient over an open network it will restart 
both VPN service and torrentclient if one or both goes down
a good place to put this is in your autostart folder.
