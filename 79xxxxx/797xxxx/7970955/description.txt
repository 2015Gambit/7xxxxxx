"Confessions"

Spirits intensify at Roosevelt Medical Center 
when Dr. Devlin and Dr. Robinson treat a 
priest who was bitten in the face during an 
exorcism of a demon. After Constantine learns 
that newcomer Russell King (guest star Madsen) 
has his eye on taking over downtown, he 
consults Celeste (guest star Beals) and Al 
Trapani (guest star Starr) to help him 
evaluate the risks and rewards of 
consolidating the power in Chicago. Meanwhile, 
Dr. Devlin dives deeper into the fold when 
Nate calls her into action to aide a runaway 
who may have witnessed a murder.
