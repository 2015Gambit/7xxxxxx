This album was the first professional tribute album to be released for Rocky 
Horror (there was an amateur fan tribute album put out on LP three years 
previous). "Absolute Pleasure" has an eclectic mix of styles from a wide range 
of bands, with some preference towards Texas groups since the people 
organizing the album were located in Dallas, Texas. At least two of the bands 
(The Emma Peel Advocates and Darby Jones) had members from their local 
Rocky Horror Picture Show performing casts.
