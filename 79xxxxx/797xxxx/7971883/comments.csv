,muLineZu,2013-01-07T23:36Z,"I don't think is fair not to mention the source (Deadfall.2012.720p.HDTV.DD5.1.x264-CtrlHD) and mostly is not right to change the title from HDTV to Blu-ray, when it's obvious that's not the source (at min 05:01 down-right it appears HDNET Movies, the TV Channel from which it has been recorded from).
The V/A quality is not so bad, I would say a 7/8, but it's not ok to take credit for someone else's release (the only thing that's changed is the Swedish subtitle that's muxed on, and of course the title). I think that one should respect it's VIP status, in order to be respected. Am I wrong?"
