 Fundamentals Of Linear Algebra And Analytical Geometry 
 by Ya. S. Bugrov, S. M. Nikolsky.

  What this text is about?
  
  The present book is the first part of our three-part textbook
  Higher-Mathematics. We deal here with the fundamentals of the theory
  of deteminants, the elements of theory of matrices, the theory of
  systems of linear equations, and vector algebra. The book is also
  intended to introduce its readers to the basic aspects of linear
  algebra: linear operators, orthogonal transformations, self-adjoint
  operators, the quadratic forms and reducing it to the canonical
  form. Elements of analytical geometry (the straight line, the plane,
  the straight line in space, and second order curves and surfaces)
  are also included.  
 
  This book was translated from the Russian by Leonid Levant and
  was first published by Mir Publishers in 1982.
