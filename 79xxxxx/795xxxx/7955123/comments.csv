,Jessy1237,2012-12-25T03:51Z,"Please seed, almost no one is seeding and it is going to take me a week to finish downloading. Do merlin first then once this torrent is set, then pls seed mrs browns boys. Once my download is finished i will seed for about a week."
,Vendommoir,2012-12-25T04:48Z,The Original uploader is uploading @ slow speeds. Everyone is stuck @ about 55% due to that very reason. Could you pause the Mrs. Browns for an hour so a few people could finish Merlin up? Thanks.
,Vendommoir,2012-12-25T04:54Z,@AJAXEN95 is uploading @ 2kps / second !! Everyone is stuck @ about 55% due to that very reason. Could you pause the Mrs. Browns for an hour so a few people could finish Merlin up? Thanks.
,Notor1ous,2012-12-25T05:25Z,"Its only taken four hours to get to 63% !!!
And my internet is so fast, it could swallow this torrent like a dog swallowing a doggy treat."
