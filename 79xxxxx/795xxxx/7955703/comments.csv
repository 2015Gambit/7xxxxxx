,canopener,2012-12-25T15:43Z,"File size is small for 1080p but I'll try it nonetheless. Any comments on the quality? A? V?
Thx BOZX!"
,El_Bugger,2012-12-25T21:20Z,"MKV file is really a RAR archive containing what looks like DEXTER episodes. Thanks, it's just what I was looking for ......."
,Luggnagg,2012-12-26T01:35Z,"Don't listen to the dipshit above.  I've just watched this on 50"" and video/audio are 10/10."
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-26T01:53Z,"""File size is small for 1080p but I'll try it nonetheless""

So, 6+1/2 GIGAbytes is too small for you..? OMG, you're a moron. I *never* download any movie over 1.4GB is size because it's pointless, even for a 48"" screen."
,nightrun,2012-12-26T04:50Z,"Luggnagg you are the dipshit!!

El_Bugger is right, this is a .rar file with like 15 folders named Dexter and some others rar files, just to make this file large enough.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD, or just dont believe me, download this and see for yourself."
,phase700b,2012-12-26T06:31Z,"Great quality. 10/10, thanks BOZX."
,percypp,2012-12-26T12:18Z,"El_Bugger, I'd stomp on your face if I met you in real life. You're a dickhead."
,666s,2012-12-26T12:57Z,"i get the same as el bugger and nightrun, big waste of time"
,Sifu73,2012-12-26T17:01Z,"Just to be clear, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG, REPEAT, NOTHING WRONG witrh this post!  NO rar file or anything of the such!  The quality is not bad and is watchable!  I don't rate on the 10 scale so I will say it's FREE!  Don't bitch and moan!  Also, BOZX is a trusted and reputable Uploader that doesn't post fakes or Rar files so this won't be a waste of time to download!  Thanks BOZX!!!"
,ogge7,2012-12-26T18:41Z,"@michaelrwatson If you don't notice any difference between this and a YIFY-release, you'll need to get your eyes and ears checked asap."
,Powerslave0,2012-12-27T05:25Z,".MKV is not a RAR you asshole.  It's just a container for the movie!   IF you ever used MKV2VOB, they don't need transcoded.  Some people are dip shits..."
,sharpshot94549,2012-12-27T13:48Z,"@El_Bugger, nightrun, and 666s, you people are the cancer of the internet and should die slowly in a fire. 
@michaelrwatson, You need to get your eyes checked if you can't tell the difference between this and a poor excuse for HD release by YIFY.
...now that that is out of the way
A/10
V/10
I have compared this one and the 1080p YIFY release on my 60'' plasma, this is better"
,Ryall,2012-12-27T19:21Z,"Thanks again BOZX.

To anyone who is uncertain about how to view the files in a torrent, scroll up and click the '1' link after the 'Files:' heading. 
This then opens a file list above these comments.
As you can see, the only file in this torrent is:

dredd.2012.1080p.bluray.x264-sparks.mkv

Some people are either deliberately misleading or clueless."

,666s,2012-12-29T17:09Z,"alright, i'll explain what happened to me, after downloading, the folder showed normal mkv file but when i tried to play through vlc it just showed the playlist with a heap of unplayable dexter rar files, dont know how the glich happened but it did and obviously the exact same thing happened to some others aswell, i know bozx is a trusted uploader, coz i download his ups all the time and this is the first one ive had a glich with but doesnt change the fact that i did @sharpshot your just a fkn wanker, to wish people dead for commenting on a upload LOSER"

Evidently you need to get your eyes or your equipment checked if you don't notice any difference between a 1.4GB and a 6.5 GB rip of a 1080p movie. There's just too much information to be passed along in such a low bitrate as a 1.4GB movie would contain.
Especially in darker parts of the movies it's usually pretty obvious when the bitrate is too low as you end up with blockiness.

If movies don't look better in a higher bitrate there's something seriously wrong with your equipment.

I'm not saying you can't be perfectly happy watching your super-shrunken versions, but don't call people morons just because they prefer less artifacts.

Personally I'm about to downloade the 9.59 GB version of this movie which BOZX also uploaded. ;)"
,sharpshot94549,2013-01-01T15:54Z,"@666s

I know it might seem harsh, but I know that I am not the only one who has wished a similar fate to the cancer of the internet. Also, is wanker the best you can come up with? I would bet that the true definition of wanker could describe most people on this site, yourself included."
,666s,2013-01-02T08:32Z,"@sharpshot, your not worth it"
,sharpshot94549,2013-01-05T10:52Z,"@666s lol, ok, concede that you are full of shit"
,pokgais,2013-01-09T06:39Z,"Why aren't there ever any screens for 1080p releases from PublicHD? Nevertheless, I trust this source for quality rips. Ignore the blatant liars."
