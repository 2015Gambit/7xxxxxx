ΓÇ£Between Heaven and Earth exists no place where there isnΓÇÖt also good and evil.ΓÇ¥

Milo arrives in a remote valley only to find it ridden with the spirits of the undead. The demon Guishen is on the rise and soon Milo finds himself entangled in a web of deceit, catapulted into action as the saviour of the world. He accepts the burden for all the wrong reasons: to be a hero ΓÇô to get the girl - his own selfish path. But at the crossroad between our world and the next, he is faced with a decision that could determine the fate of the world. After years of self-serving ruthlessness, does he have what it takes to be a hero?
