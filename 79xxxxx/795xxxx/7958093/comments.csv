Attention everyone, unless you want the show you've been eagerly awaiting to be spoiled for you by an inconsiderable idiot, don't read the comment below. What a fucking wanker. "
,Peacock94,2012-12-26T09:26Z,"Gah. *Comment above.* I registered just to leave the comment, so I hadn't realized mine would be above his. I can't believe asanti2012 was that foolish and rude. 

The quality of the torrent is fine. I'm just pissed off that someone decided to ruin it."

,jimaa66,2012-12-26T13:58Z,"What a moron...
Go discuss with your knitting group- not in the torrent section.
How is it that such idiots can actually figure out how to download- shows you how easy getting torrents is...."
,Zejock,2012-12-26T15:49Z,"Thanks for the up, which we will enjoy this evening.

As for asanti2012, here's an idea for a New Year's resolution:

KEEP YOUR BIG MOUTH SHUT!"
,internat47,2012-12-26T16:38Z,"Really? Gee, I've only been waiting for this about three months now. Why didn't you tell us then? Geeze  : ( "

,internat47,2012-12-26T17:17Z,"Though in assanti2012's defense, a simple google search of DA gives it away, too. The British press jumped all over this. : ("
,compozzer,2012-12-26T17:59Z,asanti2012... ThePirateBay should thank you for having sudden registrations since your smart comment. Registered only to write a comment. I hope you are enjoying your seconds of fame... can only be from someone that needs attention... sad.
,BuckeyeNut67,2012-12-26T19:39Z,Really ASANTI2012 !!! Who would put a comment like that on here?  What a total ass...
,Dimmis80,2012-12-26T20:04Z,Can anyone can tell me if this episode is part of the season 3 or is from season 4.??Thanks in advance guys.??
,BuckeyeNut67,2012-12-26T20:50Z,"It sits at the end of season 3 I believe, like the Christmas episode last year sat at the end of season 2.  So it is essentially between season 3 and 4."
,Dimmis80,2012-12-27T12:51Z,Thanks a lot mate for the response.;-)
,spamoften,2012-12-27T13:44Z,"Please rate the quality using the +/- rater on the upper right corner of this page.  

And please ignore irresponsible plot-related spoiler comments you'll see if you go back into the first page of these comments. "
