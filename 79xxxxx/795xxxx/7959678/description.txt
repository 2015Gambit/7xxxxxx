The combination of Soprano Dame Kiri Te Kanawa's vocals to Oscar & Grammy awarded Michel Legrand is a dream come true and as such, this album is aptly titled ‘Magic.’ Dame Te Kanawa sings all the 18 classic easy listening songs with such vocal prowess that you can't help but wonder how she does it. Legrand's tunes of course needs no introduction as I'm sure, everyone has heard different versions of these throughout the years. This album is a must buy for all fans of Legrand, Te Kanawa and great music as this will prove to be an invaluable item in anyone's record collection.
