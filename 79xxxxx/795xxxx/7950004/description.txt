Craig is a high-school junior, in the gifted program, infatuated with his best friend&#x27;s girl. When he realizes he&#x27;s suicidal, he checks himself into the psychiatric ward of a hospital, thinking they&#x27;ll do an observation, help him, and send him home in time for school the next day. Once in, however, he must stay for a week; the juvenile ward is being renovated, so he&#x27;s in with adults as well as a few youths. Bobby, a man with a young daughter, shows him around; Craig notices Noelle, about his age. He tries to keep his friends from finding out where he is. Little things: he draws, goes to therapy, sings, helps Bobby rehearse an interview. Is this the stuff of insight?
