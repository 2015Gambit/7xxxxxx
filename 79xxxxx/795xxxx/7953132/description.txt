Lectures on Analytical Mechanics by F. Gantmacher.

 
 The course of analytical mechanics is a foundation supporting such
  divisions of theoretical physics as quantum mechanics, the special
  and general theories of relativity, and so forth. For this reason, a
  detailed presentation is given of variational principles and the
  integral invariants of mechanics, canonical transformations, the
  Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and systems with cyclic (ignorable)
  coordinates (Chapters 2, 3, 4and 7). Following the ideas of Poincare
  and Cartan, the author takes the integral invariants of mechanics as
  the basis of presentation. Here they do not represent an
  embellishment of the theory but its actual workaday machinery. The
  technical applications are associated with a consideration of
  constrained systems, which are studied in detail in Chapter 1. In a
  special section of that chapter, which is devoted to
  electromechanical analogies, the possibility is investigated of
  extending the analytical methods of mechanics to electrical and
  electromechanical systems. In Chapters 5 and 6 are given
  applications of analytical mechanics to Lyapunov's theory of
  stability and the theory of oscillations. Elements of modern
  frequency methods are given along with the classical problems in the
  theory of linear oscillations. Problems in the dynamics of rigid
  bodies are taken up in individual examples. 

  Whom this text is for and what are the prerequisites?

  It is assumed the reader is acquainted with the general fundamentals
  of theoretical mechanics and higher mathematics. The text is
  designed for undergraduate and graduate students of
  mechanico-mathematical, physical and physical-engineering
  departments of universities, and also for research engineers and
  other specialists who feel a need to extend and deepen their
  knowledge in the field of mechanics.

  This book was translated from the Russian by George Yankovsky and
  was first published by Mir Publishers in 1975.
