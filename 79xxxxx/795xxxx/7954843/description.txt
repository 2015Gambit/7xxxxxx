We've been conditioned to lead our lives in fear - fear of "what if?", fear of success, fear of failure, fear of seeming different from others, even fear of being afraid! It's time to set yourself free, and it all begins with 3 days of powerful hypnosis in Montreal. I'll be joined this time by Master Hypnotist Steve Piccus for an astonishing romp through life as we see it - more like an uproarious carnival than an object of dread! Imagine 3 days of stories, digressions, exercises examples and inductions -- all weaving together the thoughts, beliefs and actions of your new relaxed and confident self. Imagine all that you will accomplish once you get out of your own way. Once you've absorbed all the "Steve-ness" and "Mark-ness", it's the rest of the world that will get out of the way!
