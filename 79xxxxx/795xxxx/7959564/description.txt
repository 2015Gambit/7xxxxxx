[b] Konoha has suddenly been attacked by flying shinobi from the Sky Country. It turns out to be revenge for the Second Great Ninja War, when Konoha destroyed the Sky Country. At the same time, a doctor and his apprentice, Shinou and Amaru, appear in Konoha requesting aid for their village on the outskirts of Fire Country, as they also have been attacked by the Sky Country. Naruto, Sakura, and Hinata team up to form a three-man cell to accompany and help Shinou and Amaru as they head on to their village. Meanwhile, Shikamaru and other ninja take the offensive to attack the Sky Country's fleet before they can launch a second assault.[/i]
