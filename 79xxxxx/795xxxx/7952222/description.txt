Information
------------------------------

Unreported World meets the Burmese villagers fighting for their ancestral lands as foreign investors flood in to a nation rich in undeveloped resources. After 50 years of military dictatorship, Burma is finally re-emerging from isolation as a pariah state. The release of political dissident Aung San Suu Kyi and the moves towards a more open society are the end of the story for some. However, economic development is leading to new social unrest as tensions build between big business and local people. Reporter Evan Williams and director Wael Dabbous travel to the north of Burma, close to the country's famed second city Mandalay. It's the centre of a farmers' resistance movement against some of the most powerful forces in the region and the stakes couldn't be higher.
