,samasaur,2012-12-24T10:08Z,Plays fine v10 a10 but it is showing me a runtime of 7:13:45. Weird.
,hrector,2012-12-24T11:16Z,"Nvm, synced subs: http://subscene.com/subtitles/stargate/english/667107

The runtime is an encoding error, video is fine however"
,friherrekurre,2012-12-26T02:43Z,A classic. Thanks.
,hrector,2012-12-27T11:40Z,Subtitle reuploaded here: http://subscene.com/subtitles/stargate/english/667377
,nanismp,2012-12-27T15:46Z,why is this showing 7+ hours of run time ?
,michelasso,2013-01-09T11:56Z,It's even worse than that. My tv didn't let the movie to fast forward or backward. Something si pretty bad with the encoding.
