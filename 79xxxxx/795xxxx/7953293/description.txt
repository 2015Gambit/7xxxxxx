In this post we will see Problems and Exercises in the Calculus of
Variations by M. L. Krasnov, G. I. Makarenko, A. I. Kiselev . 

The calculus of variations is one of the most important divisions of
classical mathematical analysis as regards applications.The authors'
aim was to supply the reader with a certain minimum of problems
covering the basic divisions of the classical calculus of variations,
and they deliberately avoided questions pertaining to the theory of
optimal control.
