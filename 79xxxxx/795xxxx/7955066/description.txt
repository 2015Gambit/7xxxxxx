A CHRISTMAS PROMISE
 
Three days before Christmas, in LondonΓÇÖs East End, thirteen-year-old Gracie Phipps encounters eight-year-old Minnie Maude Mudway, freezing and alone. Only the day before, someone murdered Minnie MaudeΓÇÖs Uncle Alf and made off with his rag-and-bones cartΓÇöas well as with Charlie, the beloved donkey who pulled it. Now, Grace and Minnie Maude set off to rescue Charlie. But the path that Uncle Alf had taken to his death was not his regular route, and in his cart, the children are told, was a dazzling golden casket that could very well be a PandoraΓÇÖs box of evil or a shining prize of hope.
 
A CHRISTMAS ODYSSEY
 
Ten days before Christmas, James Wentworth feels not joy but grief. His reckless son, Lucien, has been lured into a world of drugs and wild passion. WentworthΓÇÖs only hope, he believes, is his old friend Henry Rathbone, who volunteers to search for the wayward young man with the help of two new companionsΓÇöSqueaky Robinson, a reformed brothel-keeper, and Crow, a mysterious slum doctor. As this odd trio gathers clues about LucienΓÇÖs disappearance on LondonΓÇÖs dark streets, they find themselves on a mission whose outcome they cannot begin to guess. - Goodreads Summary
