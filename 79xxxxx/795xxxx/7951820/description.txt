Rachel and Becky Unthank continue their journey around England's hidden customs 
and dance traditions and into the dark heart of its winter pastimes. The 
follow-up to Still Folk Dancing After All These Years, which explored English 
folk dances from spring to harvest, this film explores English folk customs 
around the country though the other six months of the year.

200 years of political intrigue and clashes with police authorities in Lewes on 
Guy Fawkes Night have created an awe-inspiring procession of burning popes and 
other effigies of the enemies of the bonfire, not to mention a heavy police 
presence to this day. Throwing the Yorkshire carols of Sheffield out of the 
church repertoire has only served to enhance the heart-stopping show of 
unrestrained joy found in the powerful singing at the Royal Hotel pub in 
Dungworth. 

The longsword dancers of the North East and molly dancers of East Anglia, who 
have gone collecting funds each year, are a reminder that no higher power puts 
food on the plate. Just as these customs rely on the communities themselves to 
mark each point with song, remembrance and a gathering together, the very need 
to survive lies in the hands of your neighbour.

The Unthanks discover these stories through singing, dancing, meeting people 
who have grown up with these traditions and trying not to get set on fire.
