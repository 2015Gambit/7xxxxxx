,KevTheOne,2012-12-24T17:39Z,"Thanks man, another fucking awesome job from Orbx. I just hate the fact they focus too much in these small airfields where I'm unable to land my NGX. :S"
,FSXNebdeath,2012-12-24T21:46Z,Thank-You!!!!!
,Marklam_Voom,2012-12-24T22:01Z,well at least we have a company making GA airfields.
,Marklam_Voom,2012-12-25T06:52Z,"@KevTheOne Btw, you can surely land an NGX on any of these airfields, you just need to know how to control them and how to stop in such short runways. ;-) I've done that on some of OrbX airfieds when I tried them. :-P"
,gol48,2012-12-25T11:02Z,"nice again, thanks ! and merry christmas to all fellow pilots..."
,tornade25,2012-12-25T12:18Z,"Thank you for this first European Airport from orbx.
NZMF Milford Sound (first NZ Airport) is released.
Merry Xmas to all the FSX community."
,tornade25,2012-12-25T17:53Z,"I got confused, it is Chichester that is the first European ORBX Airport.
This one is the first for NRM
I appreciate it too, thank you for it"
,KevTheOne,2012-12-25T23:10Z,"@Marklam_Voom You can't land a loaded 738 in such runways, and if you do, wouldn't be realistic at all."
