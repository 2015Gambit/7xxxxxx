In an age long ago, the last village of clever, peace-loving Hobbits is attacked and enslaved by the Java Men, komodo-worshiping, dragon-riding cannibals. Now the young Hobbit Goben, along with his father and sister, must seek help from the ΓÇ£giantsΓÇ¥ (human hunters) to find the JavasΓÇÖ lair and rescue the last surviving Hobbits, GobenΓÇÖs mother among them. In their quest to destroy the Javas, the heroic partnership of humans and Hobbits will transform both species forever.
