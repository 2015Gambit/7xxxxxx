A week after the gangrape of a 23 year old Indian girl, following a nation-wide protests for introduction of strict rape laws and effective policing system, The Indian Prime minister, Mr. Manmohan Singh finally addressed the nation on Dec 23, 2012.
A minute long script that he read off a paper was ineffective, wooden and lacking any emotions. 
His comment "Theek hai?" (all well?) towards the end of the speech, which was intended for the camera persons, went unedited and on-air on a dozen tv channels.

'Theek hai' - sparked a nation wide outrage and became a symbol of the corrupt and ineffective government's attitude toward sensitive issues.
