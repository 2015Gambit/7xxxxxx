General Hume has been defeated and the six mystical guns are now in the possession of our heroes. But Hume is too evil to stay dead for long, and the power of the guns come at a terrible price. In the haunted bayous around New Orleans, Drake, Becky, and Gord hunt for a way to rid themselves of the cursed weapons while evil forces conspire all around them.
