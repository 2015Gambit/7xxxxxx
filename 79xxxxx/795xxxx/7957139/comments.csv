Couldn't you are least break this into separate floppy-sized chunks so I don't clog up my Winmodem?"
,summer1967love,2012-12-26T01:29Z,Take the loaf out of your ass and show some respect for the uploader.
,Bazz1,2012-12-26T02:37Z,everyone knows 350 mb is the new 699 mb

As usual, A10/V10.

I really appreciate your amazing-quality uploads!"
,kian089,2012-12-28T20:13Z,"hahahaha very funny loaf,,but some of us prefer smaller file sizes,some because of speed and some because of less HD space."
[T],MelloYello,2012-12-29T02:02Z,+1 Thanks.  Good movie.  Nice quality.  It even has Deb from Dexter in it. lol
[T],MelloYello,2012-12-29T06:27Z,Not compatible with ConvertXtoDVD.  You will get green screen with sound only.  Plays fine with VLC Player.  Now that I think about it.  I downloaded That's My Boy from you a while back and had the same problem.  I burn MKV files all the time not sure what is different with your encodings. I like your uploads I just don't like having to watch everything on my computer.
