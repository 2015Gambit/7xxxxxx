,ClubQBall,2012-12-23T17:00Z,"@robert342 - Oh, since you want even FURTHER clarification:

Google.com - ""Whole Disk Encryption Software For Mac""

I count AT LEAST **seven** other options ..."
,robert342,2012-12-23T17:16Z,"OK, I appreciate the links. I also agree with you that Symantec products basically suck. But do you have any of WDE for the Mac with a ""key""? I like SecureDoc but I don't have a working copy.
Thanks"
,chaostastic,2012-12-28T23:02Z,Thanks Robert! I have some older PGP disk images (made with PGP Disk in 2005) that I hope this one will be compatible with. There are no alternatives for that as far as I know.
,robert342,2012-12-30T17:00Z,"There are a few alternatives to WDE, but unfortunately I never see any posted with cracks."
