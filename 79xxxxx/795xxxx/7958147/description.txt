Yep, I finally ran out of stuff to say as we come down to the final four.

OK, can't resist one update. I've decided to split my bandwidth between the current
post with the other half devoted to the earlier episodes. Seems a good compromise.

Late addition. If TSI is to be believed,
it would seem that the seeding of episodes 2-8 has been left entirely up to me.
Serves me right for such a long and detailed rant, I suppose.
After all, *I* am the one interested in seeing these stay seeded. heh.
And still episode 9 seems to have been fully seeded in record time.
What else can I do but humbly present yet another package of 5 files:
