This is the straight installation file for A2A Simulation's SHOCKWAVE 3D LIGHTS Redux addon for Flight Simulator X, which adds pretty nice textures for the light effects on ALL default aircraft.

You can add the lights addon to other freeware and payware also, just head over to A2A Simulation's forum thread for it.

Most popular freeware and payware aircraft are listed at that page, along with the lines needed for installation of the lights to those certain aircraft. 

NOTE: Some configurations there work on other aircraft too, so try experimenting and see how you go.
