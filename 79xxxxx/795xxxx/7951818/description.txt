One of the greatest books ever written about Rock radio. It's centered around Richard Neer's life at 102.7 during the era of the great rock DJs. 

(For those not in the know, 102.7 was WNEW at the time, which left rock for a shock jock style years later until O&A got kicked off the air, which forced them into a changing lineup and then eventually it became the same top pop hit station every other channel is)

It's a cool book. Read it if you love music.
