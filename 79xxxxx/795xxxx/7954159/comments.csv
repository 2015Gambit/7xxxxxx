,getshort,2012-12-30T22:21Z,"Installed on 10.8.2. Does not record save games. Every time you load the game you have to start over. And it doesn't let you command-tab out of the window, or change your settings to not be fullscreen. Any solutions?

There is no usersettings.ini file to be found. And no save game file is created in Library where it should be. Blah."
