From Wikipedia:



Gary Malcolm Wright (born April 26, 1943) is an American musician, best known for his songs "Dream Weaver" and "Love Is Alive".


The Dream Weaver is a hit solo album by one-time Spooky Tooth keyboard player Gary Wright released in June 1975.

The album was said by Wright to be the first-ever all-synthesizer/keyboard album (though there were many all-synthesizer LPs before this, including Switched-On Bach by Wendy Carlos, in 1968) - it features Wright on vocals and keyboards and Jim Keltner and Andy Newmark on drums. The only track to feature any guitar was "Power Of Love" which featured fellow labelmate Ronnie Montrose on electric guitar.

The album's success was a slow but steady accomplishment as the album eventually peaked at #7 on Billboard album chart in the Spring of 1976. The album's title cut and "Love is Alive" both peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.
