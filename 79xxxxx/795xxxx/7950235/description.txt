This encore presentation of 'A Night with Enigma' is the prequel to 'The Second Hour'. This album is all about exploring yourself and finding your true path, undomesticated. It is about forgetting what is prohibited; this ΓÇÿNightΓÇÖ, nothing is forbidden...

The First Chapter (MCMXC a.D.)will be your guide.  The Second Chapter (The Cross of Changes)shows you the world of Enigma.

Enjoy,
