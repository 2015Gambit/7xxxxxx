,wecaz1,2012-12-25T12:37Z,I don't prefer YIFY encodes because video gets blurry during motion scene.

,nbmatt,2012-12-25T23:16Z,"@dragonballz: No, 3D torrents are usually in the 3D section. YIFY just included the 3D part of the original title of the film in this torrent's title, but the actual file download is just Dredd (2012) and a non-3D BrRip. In the future, just check the sample photos linked in the info box. Actual 3D torrents will have two frames side-by-side in those sample shots (and be substantially larger file size).

Thanks for another fantastic upload, YIFY! "
,filhodaputa,2012-12-25T23:42Z,"The sound is really bad on this one,"
,drakic,2012-12-26T01:21Z,Is it cropped too much?! Reliable A/V?
,Monkeylovemovieslikebanan,2012-12-26T04:26Z,YIFY U ARE A GOD! CLOUD ATLAS NOW THIS OMG U R THE BEST UPLOADER!!!. EVERYONE ON PB KNOWS AND WORSHIPS YOU!
,Monkeylovemovieslikebanan,2012-12-26T04:27Z,about the sound no one cares and it's not really that low. just turn up the volume a bit more. what matters is the size and quality

,flash244,2012-12-27T05:50Z,GREAT! Big thanks YIFY :)
,eroticburps,2012-12-27T16:31Z,"It is surprising how you have brilliantly encoded a movie to a 720p clarity without it being released on DVD. Crystal Clear
Video 10
Audio: very good worked on
Highly recommended for download..... Thanks YIFY
+1 indeed"
,vamss,2012-12-27T18:07Z,"YIFY am a biggest fan of you...
when i see the name YIFY i blindly download it...
you are the king of Torrents....
please upload ""Outsourced(2006)"" movie in 720p with less size..
please....!!!

,letitbe123,2012-12-29T15:50Z,thanks yify love you work but this is not 3d mate 
,davecampbell99,2012-12-30T08:07Z,this is listed as 3D but is not...a rare mistake by Yify..... hehe
,LocoRodeo,2012-12-31T12:23Z,"I hope all of you still buy this. I want a sequel, goddammit!"
,sharpshot94549,2013-01-01T16:09Z,"to all the people saying ""why isn't this in 3D?"", the movie was marketed as ""Dredd 3D"" even when not shown in 3D. If you are looking for a 3D copy, TPB has a #D section now, hell, even a physibles too. "
,spyderx810,2013-01-03T04:16Z,"Video quality is very good for its size, but the audio is shit (snap crackle pop cereal comes to mind)...90kbps mp3??? you got another 50MB if you're looking to keep the video able to fit on a cd could have at least fit 160-192 kbps mp3 on there..."
