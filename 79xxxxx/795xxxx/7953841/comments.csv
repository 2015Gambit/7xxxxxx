Keep this shit out of the Highres section."
,evilabbot,2012-12-24T15:22Z,"Sorry, I tried to edit this torrent to remove from the high-res section like you said but I can't.

I will remember in future not to put anything I downmix into high-res section.

Thanks for the tip."
,Seaford,2012-12-24T20:25Z,Thank you for this. Especially the subs which I have been unable to find anywhere else.  Pay no attention to negative comments.
,xidio,2012-12-24T20:34Z,"afkuser... the ""720p HD"" Versions arent 720p, they are 960x720 which is 4:3.."
,Seaford,2012-12-25T21:43Z,Everyone - 720p refers only to the height of the picture.  YIFY and others upload many movies that are only 540p in height  but still are classified Highres.  Evilabbot - as I watch these episodes I see no reason they should not be classified as Highres.  Keep up the good work and thank you again!!!
,evilabbot,2012-12-26T14:00Z,"@seaford - thanks for the encouragement. Still, I should probably put any future down-mixes out of this section, just in case. I don't want to be violating any rules of the site :)"
,acc6804,2012-12-26T23:11Z,"Thank you very much, sir!! Any chance you could do the same thing with Original Series BRRIP's? I'd do it myself, but my computer isn't up to the challenge. :)"

,star_trek_thebest,2012-12-30T17:41Z,Thanks for this! Any chance of uploading the season 2 special features? Please? :)
,lpeti93,2012-12-30T17:54Z,"If it is not too much to ask, could you upload the extended version of the 9th episode ""Measure of a man""? The torrent seems good so far. Thanks"
,evilabbot,2012-12-30T19:39Z,"Hi guys,

@acc6804 - I don't have the TOS files, but will look into doing so if I can get them :)

@star_trek_thebest and @lpeti93 - sorry, I only have the torrent listed in my description to work from.. I have nothing else from Season 2 :("
,star_trek_thebest,2012-12-31T01:10Z,@evilabbot That's a bummer but thanks anyway. Keep up the good work :)
,Seaford,2013-01-01T13:10Z,Link to TOS files - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7276404/Star_Trek.TOS.Remastered.Bluray.720p.Ac3.Eng.Swe.sub.mkv_
,evilabbot,2013-01-04T17:13Z,"@Seaford - thanks, getting it now. May take a while to complete tho... heh!"
