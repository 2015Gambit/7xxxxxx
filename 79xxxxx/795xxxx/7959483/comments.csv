?

Or do people rate basically on scales of CAM/TS/DVD/Blu-Ray

,coykoi,2012-12-28T05:32Z,"Haze: The latter.

This is a good looking DVDrip, but if it were labeled ""DVDrip"" and looked or sounded like a cam, it'd get weak ratings. Similarly a rip labeled ""1080p"" or ""Blu-ray"" that has more pixelation or a poor audio track would get weaker ratings, while a very good looking Blu rip is higher. This would explain why a good lookin' DVDrip can sometimes have a better rating than a poor Blu rip.

In other news, this is a wonderful movie, and I'm so glad to have the opportunity to watch it again.  My rating A:10 and V:9. Great work. Thanks so much."
,SuprVgeta,2012-12-28T06:29Z,"keith696969,

I usually don't login to write comments on torrents, but I had to address your ignorance.  It's not your fault, you have been inducted into the Lincoln cult that has re-written history to make Lincoln out to be some kind of slave freeing superhero sent by God to America.

The truth is that the Civil War was not about slavery.  It initially started due to the South wanting to be a free trade zone, where as the North and Lincoln was all about high protective tariffs.  The North feared that the South would steal all foreign commerce from them due to this.  The South wanted to peacefully secede, and Lincoln said no.  He didn't give a damn about freeing the slaves when the Civil War started.  Here are some famous quotes straight from the ""Great Emancipator:""

1858 - The Great Emancipator on the black & white races
Lincoln's words from the famous Lincoln vs. Douglas debate on Sept. 18, 1858:

    ""I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, [applause] — that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, not to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will for ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.""

1862 - The Great Emancipator on freeing slaves
Lincoln wrote to Horace Greeley:

    ""My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.""

I highly suggest you read REAL history books, such as ""The Real Lincoln"" by Thomas DiLorenzo to innoculate yourself of the revisionist history of the Lincoln propagandists."

Those tired quotes that all cynical pricks like to highlight were meant for a contemporary audience. He was saying what needed to be said to retain credibility with a racist culture in both the north and the south. It's the same reason every modern president comes out against the drug war, even though they all did drugs. Or that they fall all over themselves to emphasize how close and friendly and wonderful the US relationship with Israel is even though we all can see that it is the modern equivalent of south africa under apartheid but with even higher stakes and bigger assholes on both sides.

You're right, he was a politician, and a damn good one. So you trot out quotes from PUBLIC SPEECHES as evidence of his true feelings?

So he stated that he was for it, just to get into politics, and abolish it from within. Correct me if I'm wrong."

,PirateWizard,2012-12-29T13:19Z,"Thank you jeff btw. You are correct and took the words out of my mouth. And since superv is quoting President Lincoln, lets not forget these as well:

“I have always thought that all men should be free; but if any should be slaves it should be first those who desire it for themselves, and secondly those who desire it for others.  Whenever I hear any one arguing for slavery I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally.”  ( Lincoln, 1865)

“The most dumb and stupid slave that ever toiled for a master, does constantly know that he is wronged…although volume upon volume is written to prove slavery a very good thing, we never hear of the man who wishes to take the good of it, by being a slave himself.” (Lincoln, 1854?)

Abraham Lincoln wrote to Joshua Speed, a slave-owning friend: “I confess I hate to see the poor creatures hunted down, and caught, and carried back to their stripes, and unrewarded toils; but I bite my lip and keep quiet… In 1841 you and I had together a tedious low-water trip, on a Steam Boat from Louisville to St. Louis. You may remember, as I well do, that from Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio there were, on board, ten or a dozen slaves, shackled together with irons. That sight was a continual torment to me; and I see something like it every time I touch the Ohio (River), or any other slave-border.It is hardly fair for you to assume, that I have no interest in a thing which has, and continually exercises, the power of making me miserable.” (Lincoln, 1855)

I can go on, and on, and on, and on.... Bottom line, personal letters and journal entries clearly show not only the AL was against slavery, but that it tormented him. Some bs he said in a speech to get the ball moving hardly proves your idiocy.

If you believe everything a politician says in his speeches Suprvgeta, then I assume your convinced there are weapons of mass destruction not yet found in Iraq?"

There's a glut of fake quotes the conservatives have started to spew about most everyone in early American history to back some contemporary interpretation of the Constitution.
