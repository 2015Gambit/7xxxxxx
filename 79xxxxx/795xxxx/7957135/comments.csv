A ? V ?"
,Mr_Heisenberg,2012-12-26T07:04Z,"^its brownsugar, its always legit. Great video quality and 384 kb audio, very respectable. I recommend downloading from brownsugar if you care about quality audio. If not go download from yify lol 120 kb audio if your lucky and the picture isnt even as good as brownsugar, you decide..."
,Avoakrabian,2012-12-26T09:52Z,"Yes I see.. I had a look at his torrents, all of them are 5.1 surround sound and small sizes (1-2GB) !!
I couldnt find any 5.1 movie less than 4GB.
I am on 40% on this movie still, after finishing and watching, if the quality really is good, i am actually going to start to ""Seed"" torrents ! His torrents !"
,jimaa66,2012-12-26T13:53Z,"Watched last night. I'd have to give it good marks for quality. Easily watchable, as I didn't see too much glitching on a 54 inch plasma. Nice Torrent. thanks."

Can you provide Taken 2 1080p DD 5.1 With same quality (Video and Audio) and the same size as this movie?"
