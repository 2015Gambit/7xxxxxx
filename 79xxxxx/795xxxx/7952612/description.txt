This is the Meshes.bsa file to fix the hair and forehead glitch cause by http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7485053/Fallout.New.Vegas.Ultimate.Edition-KaOs unpacking all the .bsa files for some reason. This goes directly into the Data folder. You only need to get rid of the characters file within Data/meshes but if you need more space you can *probably* delete every file that doesn't have "dlc" somewhere in its name without issue.
