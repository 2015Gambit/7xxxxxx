If you'd take time to read the info that the uploader has generously provided, you would have seen where he had the ""real"" name listed.
Clash of the Empires (Age of the Hobbits).  Not being a smart ass or anything. I know u were just trying to provide a little extra info, I just thought I'd point out that it was already there.  So thanks to you anyway, and thanks very much to the uploader."
,ThinkBachs,2012-12-24T07:52Z,"To be fair, ""Age of the Hobbits"" is a little misleading, particularly for those looking for the latest Hobbit movie.  This actually doesn't seem to have anything to do with Hobbits in the sense that most people are currently looking for.  Just another B movie looking to capitalize on The Ring franchise..."
