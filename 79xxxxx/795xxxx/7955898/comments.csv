,airbusflyer,2012-12-25T16:48Z,"Someone knows how to get the 1226 working with JeppFD v2 and iOS 6.0.1 iPad 1? I tried several tipps but I only got the charts working.
When checking the map no datas are displayed but everything is checked etc.

Thanks
PS: JeppTC is working very fine :)"

airbusflyer... I had the same problem.... it can be solve if you follow this upload by V1rotateV2. It really works
HEY GUYS! Finally I've been able to make run 1225 FULLY, VFR-enabled, under IOS 6.0.1 and app v2.0, using Diskaid v5.42!

- Erase JEPP FD application and download it from APPLE store.
- Open it once, without having updated anything.
- Close it completely (with X)
- Copy only TermCharts from 1225.
- Erase Enroute Charts (whatever you find in Documents)
- Copy Enroute Charts from 1213.
- Copy OVER PREVIOUS FOLDER, Enroute Charts from 1225.
- If you want to enable VFR Terminal Charts, create your own airportlist.bin file (need jepp.exe application and JeppView for Windows)
- Overwrite the older airportlist.bin with newer one in TermCharts
- Copy FROM ""C:ProgramDataJeppesenCommonTerminalCharts"" TO your IPAD folder ""JeppFDDocumentsdataTermCharts""
theese files: vfrcharts.bin, vfrchrts.dbf, vfrntms.dbf and vfrntms.dbt.

* Note 1: vfrcharts.bin must be writen in LOWERCASE letters, NOT IN CAPITALS.
* Note 2: Google to find jepp.exe application and it's manual.

Voila! FULL JeppFD ;-)"

,goonre,2013-01-06T07:52Z,so i followed the instructions for the 1225 install and still no enr charts. one thing i noticed is that on the initial installation there is no enr folder in data is that normal?
