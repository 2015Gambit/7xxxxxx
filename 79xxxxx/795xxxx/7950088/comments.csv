DVDRIP from widescreen movie, ""Robots"". The movie came out in 2005. The decription on the back reads: ""Fasten your seat bolts and gear up for a hilarious, heartwarming comedy that's fun for the whole family!
With the help of his misfit mechanical friends, a small town robot named Rodney embarks on the adventure of a lifetime as he heads for the big city to pursue his dreams---and ultimately proves that anyone can shine no matter what they're made of.""

And thank you again, suiteo, for the feedback."
