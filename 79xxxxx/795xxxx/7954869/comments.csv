,Xitz,2012-12-24T22:20Z,My past couple of uploads have a problem with fast forwarding... the problem is with the file format... I have rectified the problem and my future releases will be in mkv format with the subtitles softcoded (or muxed)... sorry for the inconvenience caused guys...
,Mr_Heisenberg,2012-12-27T22:59Z,"thanks for the up but the audio is not very good. 64 kbs audio is ridiculous actually. Very nice video quality tho, thanks anyways. "
,Xitz,2012-12-29T03:00Z,sorry man... got to keep d file size low... i used 48kbps (as i generally do) but then found the audio was not good... then used 64kbps which was pretty decent...
,Mr_Heisenberg,2012-12-29T05:16Z,"^totally understand man. Its definitely still watchable and its free so i cant complain. Just looking for better audio to burn to dvd, thanks for your work regardless. "
