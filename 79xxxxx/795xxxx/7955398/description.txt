Nature Documentary hosted by LINDA HUNT, published by PBS broadcasted as part of PBS Nature series in 2006 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Christmas in Yellowstone, a breathtaking look at wintertime deep within America's first national park.

Stretching across more than 2.2 million acres of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho is one of the greatest expanses of unspoiled nature and wildlife anywhere on Earth - Yellowstone National Park. Designated America's first national park in 1872, Yellowstone now receives almost three million visitors each year. Yet only a small fraction of those who glimpse the park's stunning vistas, geological wonders, and animal residents do so during the winter months, a time when nature's inhospitality is matched only by its serenity.

NATURE follows in the snowy footprints of Yellowstone's red foxes, spies on the predatory warfare of wolves and elk, and climbs into the den of a grizzly bear that gives birth to two cubs while deep in hibernation. In addition to mesmerizing footage of landscapes and wildlife, trail alongside author and photographer Tom Murphy, who has been coming to Yellowstone for the past 26 winters, camping and photographing amid the silence and solitude of the park. And go behind the scenes with filmmaker Shane Moore to find out how he kept up with Murphy during an at times harrowing trek, reminiscent of the legendary John Colter's first journey into the park nearly two hundred years ago.
