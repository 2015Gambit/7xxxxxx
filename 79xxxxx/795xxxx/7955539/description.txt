How many times lady love had given me missed call,
What to tell you lazy, left no battery at all..
Idhar Udhar heart bouncing like a ping pong ball ball, ball ball ball ball ball ball,
Tring tring tring tring tring tring, hello honey bunny,
Feeling something something, hello honey bunny, honey bunny
Feeling something something, hello honey bunny, honey bunny

Cupid such a stupid fellow, that is what I thought,
Making people fall in love, no other work or what?
Want to know him better when you enter in the plot plot plot plot plot plot,
Thanks to his Idea, you're my honey bunny,
I'm your pumpkin piya, you're my honey bunny,
Bole tring tring jiya, I'm your honey bunny, honey bunny,
