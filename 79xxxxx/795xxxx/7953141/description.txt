Analytical Geometry by A. V. Pogorelov.  

  Analytical geometry has no strictly defined contents. It is the
  method but not the subject under investigation, that constitutes the
  leading feature of this branch of geometry.

  The essence of this method consists in that geometric objects are
  associated in some standard way with equations (or systems of
  equations) so that geometric relations of figures are expressed
  through properties of their equations.

  For instance, in case of Cartesian coordinates any straight line in
  the plane is uniquely associated with a linear equation ax+by+ c =
  0.

    The intersection of three straight, lines at one point is
    expressed by the condition of compatibility of a system of three
    equations which specify these lines.

    Due to a multipurpose approach to solving various problems, the
    method of analytic geometry has become the leading method in
    geometric investigations and is widely applied in other fields of
    exact natural sciences, such as mechanics and physics.

    Analytical geometry joined geometry with algebra and analysis -
    the fact which has told fruitfully on further development of
    these three subject of mathematics.

    The principal ideas of analytical geometry are traced back to the
    French mathematician, Rene Descartes (1595-1650), who in 1637
    described the fundamentals of its method in his famous work
    "Geometric". 
    What this book is about and whom it is for?
    
    The present book, which is a course of lectures, treats the
    fundamentals of the method of analytic geometry as applied to the
    simplest geometric objects. It is designed for the university
    students majoring in physics and mathematics, 
    

  This book was translated from the Russian by Leonid Levant and
  was first published by Mir Publishers in 1980.
