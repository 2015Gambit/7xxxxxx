edited by B. P. Demidovich. 

The list of authors is G. Baranenkov B. Demidovich, V. Efimenko, S. Kogan, G. Lunts, E. Porshneva,E. Sychera, S. Frolov, R. Shostak and A.  Yanpolsky. 

  This collection of problems and exercises in mathematical analysis
  covers the maximum requirements of general courses in higher
  mathematics for higher technical schools. It contains over 3,000
  problems sequentially arranged in Chapters I to X covering branches
  of higher mathematics (with the exception of analytical geometry)
  given in college courses. Particular attention is given to the most
  important sections of the course that require established skills
  (the finding of limits, differentiation techniques, the graphing of
  functions, integration techniques, the applications all of definite
  integrals, series, the solution of differential equations).  

  This collection of problems is the result of many years of teaching
  higher mathematics in the technical schools of the Soviet Union. It
  includes, in addition to original problems and examples, a large
  number of commonly used problems. 


  This book was translated from the Russian by George Yankovsky. The
  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 19??.
