Summary:

Something stopped Nita's hand as it ran along the bookshelf. She looked and found that one of the books had a loose thread at the top of its spine. It was one of those So You Want to Be a . . . books, a series on careers. So You Want to Be a Pilot, and a Scientist . . . a Writer. But this one said, So You Want to Be a Wizard.
I don't believe this, Nina thought. She shut the book and stood there holding it in her hand, confused, amazed, suspicious--and delighted. If it was a joke, it was a great one. If it wasn't . . . ? - Goodreads Summary of So You Want To Be A Wizard (Young Wizards #1)


Tip: This series is pure fantasy, and visits themes much similar to Harry Potter. And it's more geared towards a younger audience!
