Some programs, like ADR patcher, already allowed you to patch 
your game from NTSC from PAL. But the screen was not centered!

Most of the times you had to search for a specific patch.
No any more, I hope!

Support ISO and BIN CD/DVD PS2 images and single ELF files as well.
!!!!!!!! NEW: Now you have the option to build a P/N Selector !!!!!!!!!

Attention:
	Case 1) This program will modify the ELF file.
		BACKUP THE ELF FILE FIRST, PLEASE.
	Case 2) For CD/DVD PS2 images the ELF file is backuped automatically.


USAGE:
	Click on 'Browse' and then choose an ELF file or a CD/DVD PS2 image.
	Check the 'MAKE PN SELECTOR' Box for building a P/N selector. Otherwise, uncheck it.
	Click on 'Patch File' and read the text output.
	AFTER BURN, please report the result at http://www.nofuzz.com/ktd.
	
	NEW: if the patching did not work you can restore the ELF file 
of the PS2 CD/DVD image with the backuped one.
	Click on 'Browse' and then choose the CD/DVD PS2 image.
	Click on 'RESTORE' and select the backup ELF.


The program will first try to change the video mode from NTSC to PAL.
It will indicate you if found any locations to patch, if the ELF is 
already patched and the number of locations to patch.
Then it will try to patch the screen Y position. It will indicate you if
can not find any patch locations or if can not patch the locations found.
