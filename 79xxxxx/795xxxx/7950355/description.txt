[SexArt] Jasmine W (Undercover Dangerous II / 23.12.12)

Recap: Dangerous Agent Has Been Dispatched to Unknown places with instructions to Recover Jasmine W from the evil clutches of Dr. Sharkray, a deranged nuclear physicist. Dr. Sharkray was working for Jasmine's father at the CIA where he developed a laser that could control all the global satellites from anywhere in the world. At an instant's notice, the CIA, or Dr. Sharkray, could simply turn off the global communication infrastructure causing world wide panic and mayhem. After developing the laser, Dr. Sharkray disappeared and was believed to have been recruited by VILE (Villain's International League of Evil). Intel secured from Wikileaks sources confirms Jasmine is being held somewhere along the horn of Africa on a coastal compound owned by a company whose major stockholder is, in fact, Dr. Sharkray.
