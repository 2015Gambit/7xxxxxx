Yea, I'mma sucker for a Denzel drama.

Definitely a dvd screener for the awards. As it says so on the bottom of the screen a few times throughout the movie. No full-time watermark though, which is quite nice."
,Shucky_Ducky,2012-12-27T08:31Z,"Awesome, great quality for the size of the file.

A/V = 10 (considering file size)"

,hockey989,2012-12-31T04:25Z,i keep getting an error...it was happening on and off through out the download and now it is stuck at 99.86 % any ideas?
,waiyan22,2013-01-02T13:32Z,seeding...plz
,nazzy82,2013-01-02T15:00Z,"Don't feel this is great quality at all. Sound levels are annoying - you know when the soundtrack is blaring but you miss all the dialogue?
Some scenes were pixelated if they were dark. Other than this, i guess it is fine and watchable - just not 'great', unless you are fine with these standards - and i think a lot of people are, so worth checking out. Sample would've helped heaps though :)

The film itself is fluid and Denzel is in his zone all the way through - he does a perfect job- such a pro :)"

Excellent DVD quality. Had to sync the audio by .200 seconds using VLC but after that it was perfect (not bagging the upload because i'm not sure what causes the audio to go out of sync i.e. is it the uploaded file or my PC?, just saying in case anyone else has the same problem just adjust by .200 seconds). 

Cheers
