Superfish: Bluefin Tuna
It is a giant among fish. Few have filmed it in the wild. For marine biologist and wildlife cameraman Rick Rosenthal, documenting the bluefin became the ultimate challenge. Rosenthal sets off to uncover the secrets of the legendary bluefin tuna, while documenting its place in the grand scheme of the vast marine ecosystem. Capable of weighing in at 1,500 pounds, spanning 10 feet and swimming up to 50 miles per hour in a range from one end of the North Atlantic to the other.
