Discovery Channel On The Run Whiskey Robber...Its a wonderful documentary on a Hungarian Robber named Atilla Ambruse who looted many banks.



Attila Ambrus (October 6, 1967), alias Whiskey Robber, is a Hungarian former thief and professional ice hockey player. He became notorious during the 1990's for committing a string of undercover "gentleman robberies" in and around Budapest, Hungary while working a day job as a professional ice hockey player. He became (in)famous in Hungary as a folk hero symbolic of the times in the decade after the introduction of capitalism to the former Communist state. Ambrus was eventually caught and imprisoned for about 12 years, released in 2012. His story was made into a book, Ballad of the Whiskey Robber (2004), which has been optioned by Johnny Depp for a possible adaption to film.
