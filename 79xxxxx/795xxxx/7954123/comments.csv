,MVC78,2012-12-27T23:39Z,"Right-wingers are in a rage as the electorate and culture passes them by. It's ok little right wingers, just because you lost another national election and the swing states are inching further and further left every year another American turns 18, just because the Republican brand has become a national joke and your politicians know only how to stick their foot in their mouth or capitulate to Democrats, it doesn't mean all is lost.

Just because the institutions that teach our children hate you, the media despises you, the popular culture that influences our dialogue deplores you, the movie and music industry revile you as old, out of touch, racist, misogynist, raging Bible-thumpers, all that doesn't mean your cause has been lost and things can't swing your way again in the future :) 

Happy 20-some days until President Obama's inauguration! "
