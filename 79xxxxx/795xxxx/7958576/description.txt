The revolutionary PrinBord Anti Cockroach is the first direct-printed and UV-lacquer coated wood panel in the world that repels cockroaches. When a cockroach touches the board, the repellent compound stimulates the nerves of the cockroach and prevents it from resting or colonizing on the board. Suitable for furniture and carpentry works, PrinBord Anti Cockroach has a wide range of use such as making kitchens, drawers and cabinets.
