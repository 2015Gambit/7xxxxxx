,Shotgunhead,2012-12-25T05:31Z,Looking at the sample this appears to be the same video everyone else is using.

It usually is. They just rename some bit or change the info to make it look like it's different."

Yeah but I was hoping there would be something that wasn't fitted together(Spanish Vid/English Aud) and was complete(not missing 6 minutes)... maybe higher resolution..."

First one I checked out so I can't compare to any of the other THAUJ offerings available.  This is watchable but I'll be waiting for better quality before I watch.  Even if that means waiting for BluRay.  I'm sure this can be enjoyed by some however.

Thanks for the up :)"
