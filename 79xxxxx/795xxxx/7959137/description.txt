ΓÇ£There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odiousΓÇömakes you so sick at heartΓÇöthat you can't take part. You can't even passively take part. And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all.ΓÇ¥

method, please post it. I also included the text files I used. Please
feel free to make your own versions and post them.

These books are for people like me who, for one reason or another,
have a hard time reading for extended periods. Not, to rip David off.

If you don't like computer generated speech, these books are not for
you.
