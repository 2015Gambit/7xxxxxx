These are direct rips of the episodes as recorded from 4HD by a Freesat box.

Encoded with Handbrake (High Profile [two pass] @ 3000kb/s), with MKV Merge to remux.

Kept the original 1080i rather than downsampling to 720p as scene rips do.

About as close as you'll get to broadcast quality without the original TS files!
