Computational Mathematics 
by B. P. Demidovich, I. A. Maron. 
  
  The basic aim of this book is to give as far as possible a
  systematic and modern presentation of the most important methods and
  techniques of computational mathematics on the basis of the general
  course of higher mathematics taught in higher technical schools. The
  book has been arranged so that the basic portion constitutes a
  manual for the first cycle of studies in approximate computations
  for higher technical colleges. The text contains supplementary
  material which goes beyond the scope of the ordinary college course,
  but the reader can select those sections which interest him and omit
  any extra material without loss of continuity. The chapters and
  sections which may be dropped out in a first reading are marked with
  an asterisk.

  For a full comprehension of the contents of this book, the reader
  should have a background of linear algebra and the theory of linear
  vector spaces. With the aim of making the text as self-contained as
  possible, the authors have included all the necessary starting
  material in these subjects. The appropriate chapter are completely
  independent of the basic text and can be omitted by readers who have
  already studied these sections. 

  A few words about the contents of the book. In the main it is
  devoted to the following problems: operations involving approximate
  numbers, computation of functions by means of series and iterative
  processes, approximate and numerical solution of algebraic and
  transcendental equations, computational methods of linear algebra,
  interpolation of functions, numerical differentiation and
  integration of functions, and the Monte Carlo method.

  This book was translated from the Russian by George Yankovsky. The book was
  published by first Mir Publishers in 1973, with reprints in 1976,
  and 1981. The book below is from the 1981 reprint.
