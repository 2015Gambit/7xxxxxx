Merry Xmas, interwebzs!  

In case you never heard of it, Dragon Ball Z Abridged is "a non-profit fan-based parody" of DBZ produced by Team Four Star and as they point out, "Dragonball, Dragonball Z, and Dragonball GT are all owned by FUNimation, Toei Animation, Fuji TV, and Akira Toriyama.  Please support the official release."  You can find out more about Dragon Ball Z Abridged at the sites teamfourstar.com and thatguywiththeglasses.com

Submitted for your approval, just in time to celebrate Christmas, Festivus, Yule, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Winter Solstice, or what have you, here is a custom DVD ISO containing the entire first two seasons of Dragon Ball Z Abridged, plus the Abridged movie, "Christmas Tree of Might,"  That's more than six hours of video on one DVD!  The videos, all 35 of them, were originally downloaded as .flv's and .mp4's from various torrents and 'tubes, and then re-encoded into 1500kbps video and 160kbps audio mpeg-2 files using avconv.  The video quality is average for a DVD.  The menus are very simple. 

Enjoy!
