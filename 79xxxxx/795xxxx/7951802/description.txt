They definitely know "IT'S CHRISTMAAAASSSS!" 

Top pop documentary, narrated by Radio One's Mark Radcliffe, about one of 
Britain's greatest and best-loved bands. Slade scored six number ones in the 
70s, a feat rivalled only by Abba. Formed in Wolverhampton and led by Noddy 
Holder, Slade sold over 50 million records worldwide during a 20-year career 
which saw them re-invent themselves as skinhead yobs, then mirror-hatted 
platform-shoe-pioneering glam gods, before finally re-emerging as hard rock 
heroes. 

Their poorly-spelled, self-written selection of terrace anthems included Cum on 
Feel the Noize, Coz I Luv You, Take Me Bak Ome, Mama Weer All Crazee Now and, 
unforgettably, Merry Xmas Everybody. Apart from Noddy and his bandmates - Dave 
Hill, Jim Lea and Don Powell - the cast here also includes Noel Gallagher of 
Oasis (who covered Cum On Feel the Noize), Status Quo, Toyah Wilcox, Suzi 
Quatro and Ozzy Osbourne.

Altogether now "Are you hanging up your stocking on the wall..........?".
