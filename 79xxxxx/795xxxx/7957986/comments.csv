Waiting for rest of the seasons.. Thanx in advance  :)"
,Xitz,2012-12-29T02:58Z,u can download the subtitle files for the source... i am sure they'll work perfectly...
,somalibay,2012-12-30T06:47Z,"awesome !!!!!!!!!!
perfect quality, but also perfect size
perfect choice of bitrates, you know what you're doing
thanks a lot !!!!!!!!!
please up the other seasons as well, that would be beautiful
the publichd torrents are just way too big (insane bitrates)
keep up the good work, you rock"
,Xitz,2012-12-30T22:08Z,thanks for ur support mate... i'll do all d seasons in 720p as well as 480p (75mb)... it might take some time but will definitely do it...
,somalibay,2012-12-31T07:05Z,"Wow, thanks a lot. Really looking forward. Will seed for months!!!!!!!
Just watched Season 1. The quality is breathtaking considering the low bitrates. How did you do that?
I use x264 (video, veryslow preset) and Nero's AAC encoder (audio).
Do you use x264? If so, do you use custom/optimized settings?
Again, thanks a lot. You made us very happy."
,duranachief,2013-01-01T15:48Z,"well, i would differ slightly with comments regarding quality. it is just about ok. i dont think 4 gb rip is going to work for me. would wait for around 8gb brrip for a season, if anyone does it."
