38 people download and say nothing? It is a dummy of course but someone must have survived opening it to tell what happened? No?"
,crwildman,2012-12-23T10:04Z,Ill write a comment.  I think it is bull shit.  Only way to activate windows 8 is with a KMS server.   Which is good for 180 days.   Someone prove me wrong please.

,raghu50,2012-12-23T12:26Z,"@sami1953

No it's not the same! And this does work. I have a Win8 PC and I activated my software using this only. "
,raghu50,2012-12-23T12:26Z,And yeah.. its an offline activator.
,kmi28,2012-12-23T14:55Z,Nice subject
,edtbognot,2012-12-24T13:28Z,This works very well. It activated my Win 8 Pro with Media center.
,intelarmamd,2012-12-26T01:32Z,Is this permanent activator; updates enabled?
,raghu50,2012-12-26T18:03Z,"Yes, this is permanent activator with updates enabled. You will get updates like a user who has legally registered his software"
,nickgeorgiou,2012-12-26T20:23Z,When I run sfc/scannow that makes some corrections to my pc and it is not starting any more windows 8???something wrong with the security it says.. Pls why???
,van62,2012-12-26T20:29Z,when I run sfc/scannow then it corrects something which is not safe as it says and the windows not start anymore!!! Raghu50 pls can you help????
,raghu50,2012-12-28T03:13Z,"@nickgeorgiou and @van62,

The SFC/Scannow only repairs damaged files in your Windows 8 OS. and Windows should start. 

Does it get stuck in the booting?"
,van62,2012-12-28T20:02Z,"Dear raghu50, it does not stuck in boot,but when I go to enter the password to log in,it keeps moving,i mean the bar is moving so I cannot write the password."
,spadedqueen,2012-12-30T19:52Z,works good just make sure you use it offline
,HORROR96,2012-12-31T13:48Z,so this will survive the update?
,wasifmehmood,2013-01-02T18:59Z,"trogen.dnt wast time.cn,t able tu activate win 8 ultimate"
,Gizmonoid,2013-01-07T17:11Z,"Using this I was able to activate my Windows 8 x32 Enterprise. But the question is - how long will it stay activated? And what does the activator actually do? Does it simply replace ActionCenter.dll,GenuineCenter.dll,Shell32.dll,twinui.dll and slmgr.vbs with their patched versions?"
,Gizmonoid,2013-01-07T18:08Z,Hmm... Activation is still there after updating W8 :) I really do hope I won't have to mess around with KMS servers If stays like this after 180 days.
,Gizmonoid,2013-01-08T00:17Z,"Oops... There seems to be a small problem with the personalization option which is not fully unlocked. When I try to change the lockscreen's background it does change in the settings, but when I log off and then log in again the picture remains unchanged. I'm a bit disappointed... "

,crwildman,2013-01-10T08:56Z,"I don't care what these people say about it working.  The only KMS activator that works is KMSnano, it is a small kms server simulator that works offline and is good for 180 days.   Anyone else who says different is a lier.   The problems with this one is that you get locked out of your personalization options after updates.   "
