                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Animated adaptation of the children's book by author Julia Donaldson and 
 illustrator Axel Scheffler, the creators of modern classic The Gruffalo. It 
 tells the story of a kind witch who invites a surprising number of animals to 
 ride on her broom - much to the frustration of her cat. But when a fearsome 
 dragon appears, what will the gang do? Gillian Anderson heads the voice cast as 
 the witch, with Rob Brydon, Martin Clunes, Sally Hawkins and David Walliams as 
 the animals, Timothy Spall as the dragon and Simon Pegg as narrator.
