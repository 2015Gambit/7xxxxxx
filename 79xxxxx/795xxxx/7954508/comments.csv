,LJE111,2012-12-25T04:10Z,"Are any of these latest uploads decent? All the Christmas movies I DL'd a couple weeks ago were not watchable... sound out of sync and so distorted it sounded like a bad cam. Had to dump them all.

Would love to watch these if you fixed the problems. Thanks!"
,jawick9,2012-12-25T05:19Z,"LJE111,  what is wrong with you?  Of course, these aren't Blu-ray/HD copies, but they are definitely watchable.  

Before so rudely complaining, why don't you see if it is your video player that is not properly working with the files RayCort took the time and energy to upload for all of us here!  Judging by the fact that it is only you having these serious problems (I certainly am not with the videos that I have watched from RayCort), you might want to try a different video player.  The KMPlayer is a really good one that I've never had a problem with.  VLC media player is also another good one, but make sure they are up-to-date.


And, thank you, RayCort, for taking the time out of your busy life and graciously providing these fine family movies to those of us who can't otherwise see them this Christmas season.  
Thanks again, RayCort.

Merry Christmas to all!"
