 The movie stars the quite beautiful            
 Archana Puran Singh as Anita who gets          
 tormented by the evil demon Shakaal,           
 who was buried alive by her father             
 after he had killed sacrificed several         
 children, one being Anita's sister.            
 Shakaal attacks Anita and her closest          
 ones throughout the movie. Anita and           
 her gang tries to avoid him by going           
 on field trips and by doing a few              
 musical numbers where they sing and dance.     
 The movie is made by the Ramsay brothers       
 who might have the "honour" of being           
 the horror kings of India.
