 Travel to Distant Worlds by Karl Gilzin. 

This is a very optimistic book about future, written at just the beginning of
  space age. 

  The youth throughout the world have been manifesting a great
  interest in the problem of space travel. This interest has long
  since ceased to be a question of idle curiosity: "Is space travel
  possible?" Every pupil now knows the answer to this question. The
  interest of our young people in the problem of space travel has
  assumed quite concrete form. They want to know what interplanetary
  flights are possible today, at the present level of scientific and
  technical development, they want to know what achievements have
  been attained in the development of remarkable reaction engines,
  which will be the vital part of any interplanetary vessel. These
  young people question the astronomers about the routes of future
  cosmic flights. They question the doctors about the specific effects
  of space travel on the human organism. They are interest- ed in the
  possibility of a collision between a space ship and meteors, in the
  possibility of using artificial satellites of the Earth and in many
  other things.  In a few words, our youth are keenly interested in
  all the problems covered by the science of space travel. This
  science has already developed to such an extent, especially during
  the past decade, that it is impossible even to attempt any detailed
  account of its achievements in any one book.  If this publication
  succeeds in replying to some of the questions put by our young
  readers, if it arouses their greater interest and curiosity, its aim
  will have been achieved.
  
  This book was translated from the Russian by Pauline Rose and
  illustrated by N. Kolchitsky and designed by G. Dauman. The book was
  published by Foreign Languages Publishing House in 1957.
