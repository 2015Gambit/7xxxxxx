Wild Rooster - Riot (2008) mp3



Wild Roosters debut album. Many rockers will recognise the members of Wild Rooster from Rockn Roll bands including Snakebite, The Dreadnoughts and The Rockin Wildcats.
This fantastic four-piece rock it up in traditional Teddyboy style, writing mostly their own songs.  The only two cover songs here were originally performed by Johnny and The Roccos and Jesse James.
Fans of the Ted style of Greasy Rockn Roll will love Wild Rooster.  They write great songs and perform them very well, with some nice guitar licks adding to their sound.

Wild Rooster are a bunch of wild rockin cats from Sweden. Some have played rockn roll/rockabilly for over a decade in several bands. They have a big mix of bands as inspiration, from them early cool rockers like Charley Feathers, Johnny Burnette, Gene Vincent and many more, to them cool rockers of today! What youll hear is a wild act of crazy foot stompin rockn roll delivered by the wildest roosters around.
