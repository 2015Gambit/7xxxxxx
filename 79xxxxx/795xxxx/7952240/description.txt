blink-182's latest EP (Dogs Eating Dogs) presented in 320kbs.

BPM is calculated, lyrics are included, and it's all properly tagged, with no extra garbage tags. Formatted for iTunes 11, and tested on a 4th generation iPod touch.


Fall Out Boy's latest four albums have lyrics, I'm waiting to find 320kbps copies of the albums. I'm also having trouble finding Brand New's albums in 320. If anybody could assist with that, it'd be really appreciated.
