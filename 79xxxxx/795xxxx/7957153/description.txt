Electronic Arts returns for the 2012/2013 football season with a new 
iteration of its single and multi-player soccer special. FIFA 13 comes with 
plentiful innovations to add to the gameplay offered in FIFA 12. 

FIFA 13 also comes, of course, with more than 500 officially licensed clubs 
with more than 60 officially licensed stadia and more than 15,000 players 
to choose from. There is also a massive soundtrack with more than 50 
tracks. 

The All-New Attacking Intelligence is the most sophisticated artificial 
intelligence that EA has managed to program in a FIFA title so far. AI 
players can now analyse space to enable them to work harder and smarter in 
order to break down the gamer's defence. 

Also added is a new dribbling system that has been inspired by Barcelona 
and Argentina star Lionel Messi. Called Complete Dribbling it enables 
players to face their opponent and use precise dribble touches combined 
with true 360-degree control. 
  
The next addition is the FIFA 13 1st Touch Control system that makes the 
AI opposition less perfect and more realistic in order to make battling for 
the ball more of a challenge. 

FIFA 13 Tactical Free Kicks enable the gamer to create new and 
unpredictable free kicks positions and strategies: up to three players can 
congregate over the ball and then make dummy runs or use new passing 
options. 

The EA Sports team has also ensured that FIFA 13 Fundamentals the 
essential elements in footy have been retained. Importantly, referees will 
now make better decisions when awarding fouls and cards, and goalkeeper 
intelligence has been improved.
