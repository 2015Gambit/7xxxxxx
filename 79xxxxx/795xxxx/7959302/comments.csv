,girtas_123,2012-12-29T13:55Z,"Yes, it does. Make sure you have the latest DirectX and XNA 3.1 installed."
,pascualhr,2012-12-29T22:39Z,Both things are installed. But still I have the same problem. When I run the launcher game the process stops.

I had the same issue, but try installing XNA 4.0 redist. there is a link to it in the .nfo (but it lists it as 3.1)"

Thank you so much! :D
Now the game is working fine.
@girtas_123 , you should change the ""readme"".
