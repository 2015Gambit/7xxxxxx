One year after the prom-night misadventures immortalized in ""American Pie"" the entire gang has reunited for the summer. Now, an innocent-looking beach house will be transformed into the ultimate party central. Five guys will discover the powerful bonds of friendship...and Super Glue. Five girls will explore the mysteries of love...and the Rule of Three. And from late-night band camp encounters to some very accommodating next-door neighbors, this will be one summer vacation none of them will ever forget!"
