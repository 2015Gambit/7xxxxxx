I haven't played the 2nd one, but from what I've heard, the first one is waaaay better than the second one. You should give it try, the graphics look bad because it's an old game, and the AI is somewhat clunky, but other than that it's a exciting game."
,The_cool_guy,2012-12-27T17:33Z,hey man please seed ! i was downloading some files of the same size and it got downloaded in half an hour. but this is frustrating because i`m trying to download this file since yesterday and still its not completed. I was downloading as a guest user but i had to make an account just to write this comment.

Well I'm not a 24 hours seeding kind of uploader, but I'm seeding as much as i can. A lot of people just snatched this & ran away without seeding at all. :/"
,The_cool_guy,2012-12-28T08:44Z,thanks man ! I downloaded it yesterday and seeded it for 5 hours. game is running great. :D

If you all into the graphics type of game and not in the game aspect you might not like it. Alot of people think that graphics make the game and it's not all true."
,jKlark,2012-12-30T17:24Z,Ugh... It's like nobody cares to seed anymore... Oh well.
