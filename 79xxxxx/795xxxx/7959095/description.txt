This is the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast #302 64k Time Warped version. Time warped means the audio is played 35% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)
The reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.
