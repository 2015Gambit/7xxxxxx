Taken from IMDb:
Tina & Bettina: The Movie is based on a mini-series on norwegian TV of the same name (minus "the movie"). It's about these two girl bloggers and their life in school. It's all going fine and dandy for them; they're the leaders of the school, but one day a new girl enters the place. Let's just say it becomes total chaos.
