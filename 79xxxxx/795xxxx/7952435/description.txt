Dark Summit is a 2001 sports video game released by Radical Entertainment. The game simulates snowboarding.

A neat little snowboarding game that I came across that emulates very well on PC.

PCSX2 v 1.0 with plugins & bios files included. I have also included my setup pics.

The average rating for this game is about 7/10.



Please seed this for others, cheers.
