,KriLL3,2012-12-24T14:06Z,"It's tomorrow, btw don't feel guilty about not buying this, they ran a kickstarter to fund it and are charging $72~ per YEAR or $92~ for lifetime, that's plainly gouging people, and they tack on hotspot, if it cost $20 for life I'd consider buying it, but $72/$92 and no trial to check if it works as advertised? rip-off.

Also note it doesn't actually merge bandwidth from both connections, it only works that way if you use a download manager that uses at least as many parts as there are connections, it basically downloads the parts on different connections, means it doesn't work for the vast majority of downloads, you can download 2 things faster, but that single download from one source will still take the same amount of time."
,KriLL3,2012-12-24T15:46Z,"Man I hate when this weirdness happens, I'm connected to 8 peers none of which have any of the download, connected to 0 seeders of 7... why do torrents do this a times? feels like we're our own little swarm over to the side that'll never get access to the main one."
,kostatsis,2012-12-24T18:08Z,"Now seeding normally. Again, very sorry"

,wcngh,2012-12-26T07:04Z,"Seems fake- no icon for the installer, nothing pops up upon opening."
,houta97,2012-12-26T07:05Z,"installer just put a drivers.vbs script and other shit, this is a virus dudes, beware nod32 didn't detect it"
