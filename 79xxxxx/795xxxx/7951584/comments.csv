,reneshakil,2012-12-25T19:24Z,"i really want. but i said earlier that i need to attend to a job that need 14 hours a day, 6 days a week.  i upload in break time or at night when i'm so tired that i left these necessary info. hope u guys understand my situation."
[V],RubrumPopulus,2012-12-25T21:08Z,"Oh. well in that case, it's actually easier to leave the file names as they were released.  You don't have to do anything but upload.  Removing the information, requires you do to _more_ work lol.
For example, this was originall released as: Tron - Legacy (2012) (digital) (Son of Ultron-Empire) .  
So it actually required you to do MORE work to remove that information. :)"
,reneshakil,2012-12-25T22:39Z,ok if u guys want it.
[V],RubrumPopulus,2012-12-25T23:39Z,Sweet. Thanks!
