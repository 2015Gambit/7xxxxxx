,wardjp,2012-12-28T08:03Z,I have tried to install this multiple times with 2.1.8 and 2.1.9 yet my windows continues to say not genuine. Any ideas what I might be doing wrong or missing?
,silmany,2012-12-28T09:30Z,"@wardjp if loader didnÂ´t work for u, the best solution is to remove windows genuine asking. goodluck with that :) "
,silmany,2012-12-28T09:33Z,@wardjp use remove wat if loader didnÂ´t work.
,wardjp,2012-12-28T10:34Z,"So I used remove wat, and it did clear out some corrupted stuff (I had tried to use hazar loader before) Then i tried to install 2.1.9 again, and it is still coming back with a non-genuine notification."
,wardjp,2012-12-28T10:37Z,"Err, I didn't use Remove WAT cause I read that it was outdated and not useful, instead I used WAT Fix, but nonethless, same outcome"
,wardjp,2012-12-28T10:41Z,"Disregard! So sorry for the confusion, I never went to the microsoft website and validated, just did that, it is now genuine. TYSM DAZ, you rock :)"
,unclegob,2012-12-31T08:14Z,I'm such a noob... Can anyone explain to me how you actually use this? Do you run it in the version of Windows that you want to activate?
