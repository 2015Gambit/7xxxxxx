Tetryonic templates [12-2012].


For use in physically modelling the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter as depicted in Tetryonic theory.

Simply Print out the page from your computer.
       Cut out the 4pi Triangle geometries and
       Then fold each 4pi triangle into Tetrahedral geometries 
         (by taping the sides together).

Sort the Tetrahedra into Positive, Neutral and Negative models of Matter quanta.

This will then provide  you with 3D models of Tetryons for use in the physical modelling of Charged geometries as depicted in Tetryonic theory.
