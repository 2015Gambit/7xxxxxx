Obita is one of the most versatile lyricists in America currently. Having been a featured artist on multiple tracks this is his mixtape debut. Videos are soon to be released to this mixtape. Namely 'let the beat bang', 'Everybody dance' and 100 million Thousand. Having been a well travelled individual, especial with regards to his stay in South Africa, he has a much broader view on hip hop than your average artist. Hence forth making his reach even greater.
