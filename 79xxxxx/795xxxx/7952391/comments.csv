,goneisgone,2012-12-24T06:46Z,"Great movie, I'll be sure to seed for a while if this is a good rip."

,Amafule10,2012-12-24T11:14Z,"Thanks YIFY!!!
All of you that complain about the download speed a patient. It's been only 10 hours since it was uploaded. Everyone wants it right now but there are only 58 seeders. Be a little patient and you will have it soon."
,EstiloNovo,2012-12-24T13:39Z,How's the audio on this one? is it the Studio audio that's also being used on all the other releases or is it legit english bluray audio?

,suiteo,2012-12-24T17:37Z,"All your whining about seeding isn't going to change a damn thing because nobody ever listens.  So grow up, clean out your filthy mouths and just shut up since this is the best your IQ level will ever be!"

,Phatfish,2012-12-24T20:29Z,"Audio is fine from the little of the movie that I watched.

Video is strobing heavenly though for me in vlc.

Also the movie seems absolute cheesy shit. I cant not understand what they think they are going to gain from marketing this as a full on sci-fi movie when it absolutely isn't.  People will just get annoyed and feel disappointed even it the movie in it self might be good. "

You very clearly stated that this movie is not for ""dumb"" people.  In fact, you said that twice.

I am a dumb person and I downloaded it and watched it anyway.  

Why did I do that?  Why didn't I read and understand your sage words?

Some idiot made the surround sound mix out of the Russian audio, and completely fucked up.  You can hear an annoying echo of Russia voices in many random scenes.  That makes the sound fucked!  Fix it!

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7949066/Cloud_Atlas_2012_READNFO_BRRip_XviD-G3noc1d3

This is the only one I found that has quality audio without the Russian echo, but the video quality of that one is shit, even though everyone in the comments are saying that it's good.  The vid actually flickers, it's so low resolution.  The vid quality of that one is worse than this YIFY release.  Is there a torrent with quality as good as this one or the 6 GB BIDA release, but with the same sound as that G3noc1d3 release?"

AV were both great 10/10, BUT the text in the movie, including the main title screen, credits, and any subs, are in Russian or something. Still watchable, but you can't read some of the locations and dates."
,blugoo,2013-01-05T19:33Z,"Happy new year!
YIFY, this time, a 'thank you' with a 'but' ;)
Picture is perfect except for missing English and added Russian titles regarding locations, dates, newspapers, etc. (the source is a Russian Bluray).
Audio (English) is almost perfect (reasonable volume on TV speakers, echo barely noticeable and rare) but stops in the middle of the end credits (Russian Bluray didn't have English audio so a theater line must have been used).
Subtitles would have been great to translate these Russian titles (guess they weren't on the disc either).
I've enjoyed several YIFY releases and none had anything wrong with them but if you don't read Russian, be sure to get some English subs if you're gonna watch this rip. (The movie itself is great, BTW.)
Have a nice day."
