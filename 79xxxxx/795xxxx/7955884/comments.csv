,tordolplayer,2012-12-30T20:39Z,"So, is it just me or is anyone else getting virus tags from the Ella downloads? I've been using AVG and everytime I download Anons versions of the images it always flags a virus."
,SiMiHa013,2012-12-31T03:15Z,"@ tordol:

All files are in jpeg format released from FG. If you think the files have virus then stop downloading. Or change your AV software.

As far as AVG flagging JPGs as viruses... maybe you need a different antivirus solution?"
