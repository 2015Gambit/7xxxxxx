Not 100% sure yet how soon and fast for all of these!  I have a major surgery in January which will take me offline for a bit to recover!!!"
,ratedloud,2012-12-26T23:46Z,"this has NO audio.  I tried playing with itunes, windows media classic, and windows media player.  I will convert the file  to a avi using prism then ill comment again to tell if it has audio"
,Sifu73,2012-12-27T04:21Z,"ratedloud:

Odd since I just ran the file through VLC, KmPlayer, SMplayer, Potplayer, and Quicktime and the audio was just fine!  No issues on my end?  Might want to update your codecs!!!"
,Sifu73,2012-12-27T05:08Z,Apologies!  I was able to play it on all players except for Quicktime!  Not sure why but I never use that program anyway so I don't really care why!  This file however does playback fine using the other mentioned programs in my above comment!  I would recommend you check and see that you have the latest codecs installed ratedloud which should sort it out for you!!!
,Sifu73,2012-12-27T06:07Z,"UPDATE:

You can add Media Player Classic and the latest Windows Media Player to my list of programs that this file will play in just fine!  Still haven't figured out about Quicktime and I'm not messing around with iTunes!  Anyone knowledgeable in those 2 players willing to help out ratedloud with his dilemma!  I'd appreciate it and I'm sure so would they!!!"
,Sifu73,2012-12-29T03:10Z,I figured out what the mistake was and I apologize!  For anyone that needs to play this on Apple related products I will be encoding this again with the correction and for those that need it you can download it again!  I do apologize and will make sure in the future to double-check that my encodes play in every Video Player I have on my PC and especially Quicktime and iTunes!!!
