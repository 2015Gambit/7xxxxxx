In one giant volume, three of Herbert van Thai's popular books of great detective stories containing classics of the genre by famous writers.
Herbert van Thai was one of the world's most prolific anthologists. Best known for his collections of horror and suspense stories, which sold millions of copies, his other publications included Lander, a biographical anthology and The Tops of the Mulberry Trees, his autobiography.
This is my 3rd anthology of detective stories & at 640 pages, its the largest book that I have scanned in past 3 years! Now only one more anthology is remaining.
