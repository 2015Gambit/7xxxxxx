 There is a war raging in India. A war whose     
 end can't be seen.A war that isn't being waged  
 by outsiders. The enemy is our own! The youth   
 of the country are rebelling.. Against injustice
 against tyranny, against exploitation.Inequality
 will not be tolerated forever. There is anger,  
 and there is deep social unrest. Our own        
 countrymen are locked in the bloodiest          
 armed mutiny this country has ever seen.        
 Chakravyuh is the story of six extraordinary    
 characters, each with an all-consuming dream..  
 A promise.. A promise they will uphold above    
 everything else.
