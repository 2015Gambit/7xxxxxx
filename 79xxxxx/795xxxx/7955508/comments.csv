,PetaFlux,2012-12-25T22:28Z,"@release2 
Why don't you kill yourself you fucking spammer?"
,nairobi19,2012-12-25T22:49Z,man those screen shots look really noisy and shitty...
,topk,2012-12-26T01:26Z,"I never understood... if this is x536p then why is it called ""720p"" - it's much lower then 720p, namely - it's 536p, not 720p?..."
,aymeeloot,2012-12-26T02:57Z,"Thanks, was great quality in my opinion!"
,piratebobby,2012-12-26T03:08Z,"Why is this 720p?
720p is generally considered 1280x720 at full 16:9
Because the movie was shot at 2.35:1, 544 * 2.35 = 1280.

720p = 1280 horizontal, anything vertical.
1080p = 1920 horizontal, anything vertical.

But why are the screen shots so noisy? the screen shots from SilverTorrent (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7955704/Dredd_2012_720p_BRRip_x264_AC3-PTpOWeR_%28SilverTorrent%29) are not noisy like this."
,gogo6546,2012-12-26T05:35Z,Thank you BOZX:) Your my #1 for BluRay
,ofpirate,2012-12-26T08:17Z,"finally, a sane response to the CONSTANT novice vertical resolution bitchery.. thank you piratebobby!"
,letisa,2012-12-26T17:26Z,"SO glad i watched this in theaters first. this movie is insane. stoked to watch it again, thanks for the download"
,Powerslave0,2012-12-27T05:22Z,"Not a good rip, even the stills look crappy...  Wait or a better one."

,FeLeTr0n,2012-12-29T01:49Z,Horrible Film.
,spindeln,2012-12-29T05:08Z,"the reason is that it is black on top and bottom., and what is black is 0 in the computer world"
,xmorobertson,2012-12-29T06:12Z,Subtitles formated for DVD or Blu Ray burning can be found at: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4751941/dredd-3d-en
,piratebobby,2012-12-29T10:16Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD.

There are two coding errors with this video. The first is early on and the second is at around the 40 minute mark. When will a fixed version be available? I've tried fixing it with Meteroite but to no avail. The second one hung my BluRay player, crashed the player in the TV and VLC."
,h11s,2012-12-30T22:23Z,"this movie is so bad ,scenario is very bad ,acting poor ,its like india movie "
,SuperJimSmally,2013-01-01T22:28Z,Please don't comment on whether you thought the movies was good or not. They are NOT relevent to anyone but yourself. People only care about the A/V quality. And thank you to those that follow such standards.
,drakic,2013-01-06T01:12Z,"Not god. A=8 V=5. Video players on 3 laptops and 2 desktops have problem with decoding on same spots (5-10 seconds in each min from 15 to 62 min, blur and stop) in the movie so I can conclude that this isn't encoded very well. Skip it!"
,S3nd41,2013-01-08T19:29Z,"V=5
A=3

Crappy release. The audio garbles up when intense scenes arise and the video is grainy and low quality.

PublicHD normally has good quality releases so I dunno why this has such awful quality, really disappointing!"
