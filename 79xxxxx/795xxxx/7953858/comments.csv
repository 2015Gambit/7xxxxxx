That coupled with people already potentially having a language problem trying to download these, and I decided to shelf that xdelta idea.

Anyhow, I will stagger these releases over the next week or so because they are very large torrents and I need time for them to propagate.

Don't worry, I'll release every single msdn language updated to December patch date for Christmas.

Have a Murphy Christmas."

I have used a few of your OS'S
They are great, Except : In every one that i have used i have found A BitCoin.EXE in every one ?

Now I understand why there is so many Versions.

Look in the Default user File in AppData it is there! Every person who uses Any of his OS'S
are Bit minning for him ?
He just puts out a os every few days and people
use it - He gets Paid !

[T],murphy78,2012-12-24T19:33Z,"ahh so you are saying that someone lied and claimed that I inserted some sort of infected exe? Sad... Some people truly look gift horses in the mouth.

No worries guys, I most certainly do not infect anything I upload."
[T],murphy78,2012-12-25T00:22Z,"For the record, there is no such bitcoin.exe in my uploads.  You can look for yourself.  Whoever that guy is, I probably pissed off by making fun of T.F.K or Only by the Rain."
[T],murphy78,2012-12-25T10:03Z,"Guys, I feel as if a lot of people are not downloading this because of the total size. That would be a tragedy.  You can skip the files you do not want to download. I just ask that you seed the ones that you do, please."
[T],murphy78,2012-12-28T13:08Z,"getnikkoo there are only two activators that I know of that generate legit activation files. kmsnano and scypt's activator. scypt's activator uses kms servers, but with something like that, the kms servers will run out of activation slots for certain editions of windows, most notably pro.  So realistically the only way to activate and get legit activation files is to use the kmsnano program.  A good rule of thumb is that if an activator requires you to reboot, it's does not use legit activation files.

I have uploaded kmsnano v10 already. Follow the directions and it should work just fine for you."
,getnikkoo,2013-01-05T07:42Z,got it thanks for uploading kmsnano
