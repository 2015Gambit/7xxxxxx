The Shadow knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men. But when Lamont Cranston crosses paths with an old friend -- a fellow veteran of "the war to end all wars" -- Cranston's justice serving alter ego must judge a man whose path to villainy began with their friendship! At the risk of his own secrets being laid bare, Cranston accepts an invitation to join a very exclusive club of adventurers whose dark hearts might be the worst The Shadow has ever encountered!
