A one-eyed vigilante (Gaffey) with a dark past has vowed
to change his ways, trading his machine gun for a yoga mat.
But when he encounters a beautiful young mother (Benson)
in deep trouble with a cannibalistic drug lord and his evil
goons, he realizes that justice must be served. Teamed up
with his smooth-talking Native American hipster sidekick,
our hero rides into the bad ass brawl of the century.
