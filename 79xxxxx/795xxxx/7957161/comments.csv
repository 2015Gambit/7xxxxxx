In you next version can you please include VSS/Volume Shadow Copy.
A lot of cloning/backup programs do not work without this service."
,hoozer99,2012-12-27T09:26Z,"A good mini version.

Is it possible to enable remote desktop services server?  The windows ""Remote Settings"" GUI allows the service to be enabled, but ""Remote Desktop Services"" is not present when you run services.msc."
,akumod77,2012-12-30T10:21Z,Thanks for the new release. Will windows update works on this? 
,gnufella,2013-01-07T14:42Z,"hi soulking77,

i'm using your previous release (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7945755/Windows_7_Ultimate_SP1_Mini_x86-x64_Rus-Eng_) right now. working fine as far as i can see.

what's new in this 'doomsday' release? is it worth the while to download and use 'doomsday' release over the earlier one?

do you intend to work on a new release with ""VSS/Volume Shadow Copy"" included?

please respond. many thanks for your work."
