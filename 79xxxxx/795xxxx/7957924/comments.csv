,libertaswv,2012-12-26T01:15Z,"Thx from West Virginia, TvTeam - Sincerely appreciated as always! Thanks too to all you yuletidey seeders and leechers out there - Thx for making it happen!

If anyone is planning on slapping this on a disc for a family member or something, here's a seed from thetorrentlord to fill up the wasted space (the cast together on a talk show)... Call it a bonus feature:

Also, the great MemoryOnSmells (far and away the best subtitle'er of British tv) will have the eng subs up soon at his uksubtitles dot ru site, as well as at addic7ed sometime soon after that

Thx all - hope whatever holidays you celebrate (inc just being off work) are good ones"
