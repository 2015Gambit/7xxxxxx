Is the serial number contained in the ISO file? After installation, are their special instructions for executing the activator? Thanks for your help."
,twindragon_2010,2012-12-26T00:16Z,include serial or what ?

3. A window will open up with a lots of things in it. Ignore
4. On the top of that window it is asking you where do you want to download to. Select the location

you should always look for a trusted uploader first, like DeGun said. They are those with the skulls ;-)
Also, don't feel like u are somehow morally obliged to seed after your dl is complete. This is your choice alone. Get acquainted with the whole thing first, THEN decide whether and how long u want to seed for others. Of course, without people seeding after the download, there would be no pirate bay but don't forget that there are also certain risks involved if you seed too much, depending on the country where u live and the measures you take to protect your privacy (like VPN, e.g.). Take it easy!"

,jmward007,2013-01-02T18:40Z,"Excellent!  Thank you so much for this, I am running it on VMWare Player, and have activated it successfully with ""Windows 8 All Versions Permanent Activator"" from iA2ZiT (32.3 MiB (33869507 Bytes), uploaded 2012-11-07 12:59:14 GMT)  (because I am afraid yours didn't work).  Other versions of W8 that I have tried unfortunately didn't work under VMWare or VirtualBox, but this is fine!"
