   The road from youth to adulthood is        
   paved with myriad emotions and Student     
   Of The Year celebrates this colorful       
   coming of age. It is the story of          
   Abhimanyu and Rohan who traverse the path  
   of competition, envy, triumph, failure,    
   manipulation and heartbreak in their       
   mini-universe of St. Teresa's High School, 
   Dehradun.                                  
   As new ambitions are born and old loyalties
   fall by the wayside, each segment of the   
   Student Of The Year competition manages    
   to tear apart both, the participants and th
   spectators, to redefine the choices of the 
   three protagonists.
