V = 10
A = 10
M = 7.5
Who needs 1080p when YIFY's 720p's always look so good :p I only go with the 1080p's if they're effects-laden blockbuster's like Avatar, Avengers, Dark Knight, Iron Man, Jurassic Park, King Kong, Terminator etc.
Check me out on IMDb:

,halofubar,2013-01-10T00:38Z,"who the fuck down-rates torrents like this and doesn't leave a goddamn comment? if you don't like the MOVIE, fuck off. don't downrate torrents unless the torrent itself is shit, and i highly doubt this is, fuckers."
