I'll tell you now you want seeders and people to DL. Put more info up.  
Check the more popular torrents and see what they list.  It will help. A lot."

,B1GSMOKE,2012-12-24T17:47Z,I got the DVD from my cousin and I used DVD Decrypter to take out the all the files and once that was done I used AGK to make the movie file with hardcoded subtitles but...the voices didn`t match the moving lips. I had to dub it using Virtualdub and sync the voices and the file came out pretty good. My first time too.
