You are welcome my friend Merry xmas :)"

Same to you. How about Easter lol? I have a slow outbound speed and I'm the only seeder so far. Bear with me and help me seed afterwards."
,rrmerlin51D,2012-12-25T10:00Z,"My apologies. Meant no real disrespect.  I've seen some of these from a certain Team which will go nameless that went for days, stopped at a high percentage and never was finished.  Guess I was haunted by the.Ghost of Uploads Past.   Be happy to seed when finished. I love this stuff and can't wait to check it out. Again, Thanks and Merry Christmas."

No need to apologize my friend :) I know what you mean and I have been there myself it's very frustrating when people upload torrent and don't seed them. Have a very joyful Christmas :)"
