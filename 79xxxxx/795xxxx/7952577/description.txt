Summer, 2008: John McCain secures the nomination, but polls behind Barack Obama. Strategist Steve Schmidt suggests a game changer: picking a conservative female with media savvy, unknown Alaska governor Sarah Palin, as vice president. Shes an immediate hit and a quick study - the gap closes. Then, Tina Feys impersonation, a raft of criticism, and missing her family send Palin into a near-catatonic state: she doesnt prepare for her Katie Couric interview and bombs. Schmidt searches for an answer: don&#x27;t expect her to learn the issues, but give her a script. Palin does well in the debate with Biden; she finds her voice, goes off script, and goes rogue. A mistake?
