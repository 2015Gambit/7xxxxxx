The title graphics in the show spell it "Guerilla" but
the "Now on" graphics spell it "Guerrilla". The website 
goes for two r's, along with most tv listings. However 
the cover for the dvd-r you can order from Nat Geo spell 
it with one "r" and iMDB goes for "Guerilla" aswell.
From a language stand point both version seems to be ok,
with Guerrilla being the most commonly used and closer 
to the roots from the spanish word Guerra, meaning war. 
Show main graphics feels like the stronger pimp hand
slapping the other bitches around, even if they happen
to be a bit more correct in this case. So that's why we 
went with one R.
