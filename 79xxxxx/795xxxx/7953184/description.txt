
Higher Algebra by A. Kurosh. 

 Higher algebra - the subject of this text - is a far-reaching and
 natural generalization of the basic school course of elementary
 algebra. Central to elementary algebra is without doubt the problem
 of solving equations. The study of equations begins with the very
 simple case of one equation of the first degree in one unknown. From
 there on, the development proceeds in two directions: to systems of
 two and three equations of the first degree in two and, respectively,
 three unknowns, and to a single quadratic equation in one unknown and
 also to a few special types of higher-degree equations which readily
 reduce to quadratic equations (quartic equations, for example). Both
 trends are further developed in the course of higher algebra, thus
 determining its two large areas of study. One - the foundations of
 linear algebra - starts with the study of arbitrary systems of
 equations of the first degree (linear equations). When the number of
 equations equals the number of unknowns, solutions of such systems
 are obtained by means of the theory of determinants.
