turn on cameras beside highway, turn the other way and walk dangerously over a deep cravass for no reason within eyesight of resort still and 100ft from the parking lot, turn off cameras, eat some energy bars, turn on cameras eat some grass hoppers and say you're deep in the wilderness, lost for days now & starving ... and continue to ignore that you actually dropped out of the artisans honourary division of the SAS because you broke your back attempting to parachute and NEVER served in the foriegn legion after you claimed you did SEVERAL times in media and in print like a FUCKING WANKER DIPSHIT SHMUCK."
