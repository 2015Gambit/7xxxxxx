Book Description

It covers basic concepts, including Views and editors, as well as features that are not commonly understood, such as Perspectives and Launch Configurations. YouΓÇÖll learn how to write and debug your Java codeΓÇôand how to integrate that code with tools such as Ant and JUnit. YouΓÇÖll also get a toolbox full of tips and tricks to handle commonΓÇôand sometimes unexpectedΓÇôtasks that youΓÇÖll run across in your Java development cycle.

Additionally, the Eclipse IDE Pocket Guide has a thorough appendix detailing all of EclipseΓÇÖs important views, menus, and commands.

The Eclipse IDE Pocket Guide is just the resource you need for using Eclipse, whether itΓÇÖs on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Put it in your back pocket, or just throw it in your backpack. With this guide in hand, youΓÇÖre ready to tackle the Eclipse programming environment.
