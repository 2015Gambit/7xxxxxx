,julitha,2012-12-27T22:19Z,how exactly do you use this to crack photoshop? 
[T],tta64,2012-12-30T18:18Z,"the file is definitely clean. Most antiviruses think any crack file is a virus. And some antiviruses's alarms go off everytime you download a torrent!

and first download photoshop cs6 extended as a trial, then copy the amtlib.dll file, and find the directory C:/Program Files/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop CS6. Paste the file there, it will ask to overwrite the original file, just click yes. And your done!"
,InfinityX7,2013-01-02T10:23Z,Thank you! It works perfectly
,jakennbake,2013-01-03T01:55Z,"Only crack I have found that works. A million thanks go to you sir! Great torrent, no viruses or anything. Read instructions and profit."
,julitha,2013-01-03T01:56Z,"is it okay that the free trial pop-up still appears?
I'm confused to whether it worked or not. thank you for your instructions as well!"
,hestrofanon,2013-01-03T08:56Z," Am I doing something wrong? It seems that I only get the standard CS6 version - not the CS6 Extended. I can't find tools for animations for example and the splash screen only says ""Photoshop CS6"" (no ""Extended"") "
[T],tta64,2013-01-06T09:15Z,"@julitha - there might be something wrong however after 30 days if your still able to fully use all the features then I wouldn't worry about it!

@hestrofanon - check if you downloaded the extended trial version or the regular trial version. if that doesn't help, try downloading the regular photoshop cs6 crack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7955472/Adobe_Photoshop_CS6_Crack_.DLL_Files_32bit_64bit"
,DirtLip,2013-01-07T07:42Z,Can't thank you enough
