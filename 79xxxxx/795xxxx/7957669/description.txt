Platform  : PS3 PSN                   Genre    : Action

Release Info:

In Oddworld, you played as a former slave/worker that, almost despite
himself, rose to lead his Mudokon people against the evil corporate
scumbags the Glukkons. In Munch you're introduced to a new race, the
Gabbits, who have been driven to extinction simply because their lungs
happen to match the chain-smoking Glukkon's size and fit for replacement
surgery. To make matters worse, Munch has been implanted with a sonic
device by the Vykkers in an experiment, and is to be used to capture
more creatures. With the help of the Fuzzles, big-toothed fuzzballs
used for product testing, Munch escapes, meets up with Abe, and together
they set out to stop the Glukkons at their game... not to mention win
back the last can of Gabbiar -- Gabbit eggs -- in the world.
