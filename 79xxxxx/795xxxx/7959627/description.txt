
How does one of the most brutal dictators, an outcast, put under embargoby the 

UN in 1992 after the UTA DC 10 and Lockerbie attacks, manage, a decade later, 

to mingle with heads of state and European and American leaders in Tripoli, 

Paris or New York? With the accounts of front lineactors, such as Tony Blair 

and Condoleezza Rice, this film takes a look at 40 years of relations between 

Gaddafi and the West. It shows how, during all these years, Gaddafi used the 

West and the West used its "best enemy".
