Summary:

DANICA SHARDAE IS an avian shapeshifter, and the golden hawkΓÇÖs form in which she takes to the sky is as natural to her as the human one that graces her on land. The only thing more familiar to her is war: It has raged between her people and the serpiente for so long, no one can remember how the fighting began. As heir to the avian throne, sheΓÇÖll do anything in her power to stop this warΓÇöeven accept Zane Cobriana, the terrifying leader of her kindΓÇÖs greatest enemy, as her pair bond and make the two royal families one.

Trust. It is all Zane asks of DanicaΓÇöand all they ask of their peopleΓÇöbut it may be more than she can give.
