Qt is a free and opensource cross-platform application and UI programming framework for developers using C++ or QML, a CSS & JavaScript like language.

Qt is a full development framework with tools designed to streamline the creation of applications and user interfaces for desktop, embedded and mobile platforms.

With Qt, you can reuse code efficiently to target multiple platforms with one code base. The modular C++ class library and developer tools easily enables developers to create applications for one platform and easily build and run to deploy on another platform.

Qt 5 continues to offer all of the power of native Qt C++ enabling highly sophisticated user experiences, offering applications the full capabilities of OpenGL/OpenGL ES graphics acceleration. Key benefits include graphics quality improvements, higher performance on constrained hardware, cross-platform portability, support for C++11, HTML5 support with QtWebKit 2, a vastly improved QML engine with new APIs, and ease of use and compatibility with Qt 4 versions.
