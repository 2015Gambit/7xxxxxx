This is a very nice movie IMO, and what makes it special is that it's James Stewart's last film.  I've heard he was criticised somewhat for choosing such a 'homey' type film.  I read on Wikipedia that the reason he did choose this film was that it was the most decent one offered him that year, and I think that stands as a testimony to his character.  I understand Alice Faye also came out of retirement for this film as well.  See the pages included with the torrent.
