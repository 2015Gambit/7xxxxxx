There is a lot of info, dense at times even though it's generally well written. Very important and useful book if you want to understand how to think more rationally and critically IMO. Some of the examples were pretty shocking - how badly things have gone in some fields for a very long time because assumptions were not examined or no one would admit responsibility. 

cloak-and-dagger - Thank you for all the great audiobooks!"
