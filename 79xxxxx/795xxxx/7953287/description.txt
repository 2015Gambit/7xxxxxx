Problems in Calculus of One Variable (With Elements of Theory) 
by Issac A. Maron

  This textbook on mathematical analysis is based on many years'
  experience of lecturing at a higher technical college. Its aim is to
  train the students in active approach to mathematical exercises, as
  is done at a seminar. Much attention is given to problems improving
  the theoretical background. Therefore standard computational
  exercises are supplemented by examples and problems explaining the
  theory, promoting its deeper understanding and stimulating precise
  mathematical thinking. Some counter examples explaining the need for
  certain conditions in the formulation of basic theorems are also
  included. 

  The book is designed along the following lines. Each section opens
  with a concise theoretical introduction containing the principal
  definitions, theorems and formulas. Then follows a detailed solution
  of one or more typical problems. Finally, problems without solution
  are given, which are similar to those solved but contain certain
  peculiarities. Some of them are provided with hints. 

  These sections should prove of interest to the inquiring student,
  and possibly also to lecturers in selecting material for classwork
  or seminars. 

  This book was translated from the Russian by Leonid Levant. The book
  was published by first Mir Publishers in 1973. The book is still in
  print in Indian edition by CBSPD.
