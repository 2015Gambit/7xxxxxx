Also with Manfred Mann, the last appearance by The Equals,
Tiny Tim (not sure why), and a repeat of the previous week's 
performance of The Bee Gees singing "I've Gotta Get a Message to You".

Both The Beach Boys and Geno Washington are in this show.
It's interesting to note that years later in the 1970s, they 
teamed up to record some music that was never released.
