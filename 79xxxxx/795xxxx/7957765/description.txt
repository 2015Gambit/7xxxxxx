Full Throttle Saloon Season One just started to air in Australia a couple months ago which is how I found out about this show.  

I downloaded seasons 1-3 here:

A good upload however the final episode of season one was missing and I couldn't find it anywhere for download.

It finally played on tv last week and I decided to record and upload it in case anyone out there is interested in watching it.

I edited out the commercials but I missed the first few minutes of the show. The file is also larger than I wanted but the quality was very poor otherwise.

 
Enjoy & Seed
Cheers
