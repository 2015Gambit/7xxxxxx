This documentary is one of these underground motion pictures which are brilliant yet hard to find. Recorded in 1979 this movie shows live takes from the Montego Bay Sunsplash, presenting Burning Spear, Bob Marley and the Wailers, Peter Tosh and Third World.

Alongside the concert clips are a stash of artists interviews and snippets showing the environmental setting of jamaican music culture. This makes ΓÇ£Reggae by BusΓÇ¥  a serious piece of roots reggae documentaries.
