Witch Doctor Malpractice #2 (of 6)

Doc Morrow doesn't remember what happened to him last night--and what he doesn't know might kill him! With the clock ticking, Morrow consults with some very unorthodox specialists. But will the cure prove worse than the disease? "Charmingly demented... I can't wait for future volumes." --Cory Doctorow, Boing Boing
