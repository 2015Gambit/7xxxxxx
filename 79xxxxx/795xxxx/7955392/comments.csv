If you find a language that you appreciate me working on, please help seed.

I need people to seed and sustain the torrents for these alternate languages or I cannot keep making them. I can't be the only seeder forever."
[T],murphy78,2012-12-25T03:06Z,"The info folder in the en-GB release links to the normal thepiratebay.se/user/murphy78 but of course you will need to replace that with the proxy server and add the user/murphy78 to make a correct link.

Great Britain has that block for the normal tpb"
,vze2mp9g,2012-12-25T06:14Z,@murphy78 Merry Christmas! ! ! I'll seed this torrent for a week or so.. Enjoy the holiday.
[T],murphy78,2012-12-25T10:04Z,"Guys, I feel as if a lot of people are not downloading this because of the total size. That would be a tragedy.  You can skip the files you do not want to download. I just ask that you seed the ones that you do, please."
