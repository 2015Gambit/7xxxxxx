   The road from youth to adulthood is         
   paved with myriad emotions and Student      
   Of The Year celebrates this colorful        
   coming of age. It is the story of           
   Abhimanyu and Rohan who traverse the path   
   of competition, envy, triumph, failure,     
   manipulation and heartbreak in their        
   mini-universe of St. Teresa's High School,  
   Dehradun.                                   
   As new ambitions are born and old loyalties 
   fall by the wayside, each segment of the    
   Student Of The Year competition manages     
   to tear apart both, the participants and the
   spectators, to redefine the choices of the  
   three protagonists.
