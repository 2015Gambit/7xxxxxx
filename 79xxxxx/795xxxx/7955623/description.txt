Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective is one of the most enduring popular sleuths of all time. Gathered together in this striking collector's box set is all the Arthur Conan Doyle stories and novels featuring Holmes & Watson - an impressive accomplishment! The entire 48-hour series features the same expert team of directors, producers, dramatizers, and leading actors - including Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. Acclaim for this work has been widespread: "A remarkable undertaking - the dramatization of all 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories. Applauding them, and particularly Clive Merrison's Holmes, made my hands sore." - Peter Davalle, The Times (London).

This collection is a welcome addition to the library of any Doyle aficionado, and will provide hours of unrivaled entertainment.
