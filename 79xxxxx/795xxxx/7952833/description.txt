Pinebox Serenade - Let The River Take Them Home (2008) mp3


Pinebox Serenade continue to spread their dark, snake-oil concoction of folk, country, and rock with their sophomore release on Devils Ruin Records.

Pinebox Serenade draws influence from the general demeanor of Texas along with Texan music influences including Slobberbone and Centromatic.

The term Gothic Americana can mean a lot of things and those unfamiliar with the genre or turned off by it, don't run away by the label. Let the River Take Them Home, pushes towards popular mainstream music in the vein of Murder by Death. Combining brilliant songwriting with empassioned performances with a dark mask over each song creates a beautiful album moving past niche genres to epic big rock sound.

These are songs that have real meaning and depth and are presented to the listener in a way that sparks imagery and soul in every note and phrase. A great record.
