,Early_Riser,2012-12-28T08:46Z,"Very fine upload even for your first one. Both Video and audio are excellent even with the small file sizes.I have only checked out E09 so far, the rest are still downloading. On your next torrent you should include coding info such as res, frame rate, etc. Also on your next torrent you may wish to strip your name from the properties on all the files before uploading them. Thank you for this, in North America, season 5 only starts in a couple of weeks.
For those who want to know,
File format H 264 in mp4
Res width 720
Res height 404
Frame rate 25
Audio Stereo, AAC, mp4a"
