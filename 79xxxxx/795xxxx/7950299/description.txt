Parzania | 2005 |Critically Acclaimed|Hindi|x264|AAC|Phantom

Parzania (translation: Heaven and hell on earth) is a 2007 Indian drama film co-written and directed by Rahul Dholakia; David N. Donihue is the other co-writer. The film featured Naseeruddin Shah and Sarika in the lead roles, while Corin Nemec and Raj Zutshi played supporting roles. 

The film is inspired by the true story of a ten-year-old Parsi boy, Azhar Mody, essayed in the film as Parzaan Pithawala in the film, who disappeared after the 28 February 2002 Gulbarg Society massacre, during the communal riots in Gujarat in 2002 during which 69 people were killed. The film traces the journey of the Pithawala family while trying to locate their missing son. The film only portrays a subplot during the riots, not the entire riots. But, since the film earned publicity as one based on the riots, it was criticized for showcasing only the Hindu attacks, while ignoring the Muslim retaliation and certain reviews termed it pro-Muslim. 

The film was premiered at 36th India International Film Festival in Goa on 26 November 2005, before being released nationwide on 26 January 2007.
