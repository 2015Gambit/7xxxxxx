I have around 30 ebooks and documentation on my computer. I also know a link where there are lots of sas ebooks . But the main problem is that my internet connection is very very slow. If you can arrange some volunteers who will seed these valuable tutorials and ebooks , then I am ready to share."
,techJ,2013-01-06T00:14Z,"Hey this did not work for me.  I have SAS 9.2.  the SID I had expired Dec 2012.  I got the same message when I tried to renew with the Feb 2013 SID posted.

An error occurred applying the setinit file. Please refer to the log file for additional information.

C:Program FilesSASSASFoundation9.2(32-bit)setinit.log"
,boral1,2013-01-06T06:41Z,"techJ 
This sid is for sas 9.3 only. It will not work for sas 9.2 ( as far as I know ). Download sas 9.3 and then apply this sid. If your OS is of 32 bit and you want to use sas 9.3 , I advise you to use virtual box."
