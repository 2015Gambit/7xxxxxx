Slugterra - Season 1 - Complete (WEB-DL - 720p)
-----------------------------------------------

Eli Shane is determined to be the greatest slugslinging hero of them all! Deep in
the underground world of Slugterra, Eli and his crew roam the 99 caverns collecting,
training and dueling with little critters called "slugs". But there is a very real
threat to the world and the slugs; evil Dr. Blakk is seeking to "ghoul" the slugs,
transforming them into feral mindless weapons! No one has been able to stand up
to Blakk's powerful slugs and army of henchmen... until now.
