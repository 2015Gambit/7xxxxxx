,Magnuna1,2012-12-30T19:44Z,"Thank you for all the movies! I love Hallmark and Lifetime movies, but they are mostly not available in my country. 

I am also looking for Hallmark's Skylark (1993), do you have it?"
,jungcookie,2013-01-02T16:46Z,"May I request THE WISHING WELL please..
Thank you :)"
,lucyfan98,2013-01-02T17:33Z,"Hi there RayCort, First, I would just like to say thank you so very much for all that you post on this site. I really enjoy Hallmark and Lifetime movies especially at Christmas time. Thank you so much for making it possible for those of us that enjoy them to view them. And of course, for all of your hard work finding some of them. I was looking for A Carol Christmas for many years! I was so excited to finally see it on here! That is one of the reasons why I am messaging you now. Since the movie came out in 1997, I have been searching for Two Came Back. I just recently learned that it is a Hallmark movie. Since you are so good at finding those, I thought I might try and ask and see if maybe you might have it. I have only been able to find one copy on this site, however, I tried downloading it for over a year, and it never completed. Not to mention, it had hard coded Swedish subtitles. So, if you are able to help me out, please let me know. You can email me at lucyfan_98@yahoo.com. Thanks so much, and Happy New Year!"
,lucyfan98,2013-01-04T05:40Z,"I was also wondering one more movie. Can't find it anywhere! Anyone know where to find the Lifetime movie ""Girl, Positive""? If so, please let me know! Thanks!"
[T],RayCort,2013-01-05T19:54Z,"@lucyfan98, Sorry I don't ""Two Came Back"". You can get Girl Positive from iTunes for $3.99. I don't feel like paying then having to strip DRM and reencode to avi then upload it. Too much work, and not worth it for one person. Most of my christmas movies I recorded and reencoded to reduce file size and synchronize video and audio was painstaking then uploaded during the holidays was alot of ton time consuming work, and was honestly a hankless Job except a few of you who followed me from Demonoid, so I appreciate it. I am considering not uploading anymore movies here in the future, due to the so many Hit and Run Leechers and don't even bother to say thanks, and only a few manage to seed so others can see the movies, but many times I am asked to reupload and it irrates me to the point that I don't want to do it anymore."
,Splum,2013-01-06T06:47Z,"RayCort, hope you don't stop putting Lifetime movies up. Canada much appreciates them and the Travis Wall series!! We don't get them here. Thanks very much!!"
,cindy25,2013-01-07T06:54Z,"i don't think the piratebay community is used to thanks; many don't know how, as one has to sign up todo so.  just to send a PM one has to go to the forum, and I think this is the only place that does that.

I think people are used to downloading from ettv or tvteam, where there is never any answer, so they just gave up and did not bother. 

that is slowly changing; you get far more comments than most.  give it time.  

and Lifetime and Hallmark movies are important.

[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-08T03:21Z,"Yeah, you get comments on nearly everything and we get next to nothing. :P It is definitely painstaking work."
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-08T03:28Z,"And also if you have any requests for something on lifetime or another channel, feel free to contact us - mail or torrent comment. Quality would be about the same as RayCort's. Not HD feed. We'll do what we can."
