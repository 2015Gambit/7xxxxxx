,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-26T17:47Z,IS THIS THE SERIES THAT YOU LIKED DAMAN
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-26T22:54Z,"not really. 
this series is average, only like because of shinsengumi."
,mooserocka,2012-12-27T00:30Z,this is a psp game. Also has a female lead by the way. It wasnt that bad tho i cant wait to see in english.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-27T02:35Z,"actually the leads are Hijikata and female, 
And even if the female was lead theres still a badass Gang behind her."
,realist31,2012-12-27T02:53Z,Can u please get shangri la and dream eater merry. I love the work u do daman 
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-27T03:32Z,"Daman, I only noticed then that you've uploaded Studio Ghibli Movie Pack HD [1280x720 Dual-Audio]. I was thinking of downloading this, but I was just wondering what the main differences between this and your recent Kiki's Delivery Service were?

And if the differences are substantial, are you planning on uploading more Ghibli movies on Blu-Ray soon? If so, I'll just wait until then to download.
"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-27T04:05Z,yeah seen it in jap it was still good before that i watch samurai x [rurouni kenshin] .Yeah daman your right its all because of the shinsengumi
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-27T05:39Z,"The ghibli movie pack has HDTV and Blu rays in it,
Kiki was recently release in blu rays so the quality is way better.

I will be doing, 2-3 more Ghibli movies that were not on Blu ray before.
But most of them have an extreme amount of grain and Grain= bigger filesize."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-27T05:43Z,"just a heads up, i will be doing some of my favorite animes even tho they are quite old,
kaze no stigma, Getbackers, and a 4-6month project DB,DBZ,DBGT Dragonbox Project.

the Dragonbox from Japan Quality is as good or probably better than Funimation DBKAi Blu rays.
"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-27T07:39Z,Will the Dragonbox set have the original Funimation dub from the 90's muxed into it? Or will it just be Japanese audio? 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-27T09:45Z,"Yes it will have Funimations Dub and and japanese.
Thats why  it will take a long time since i have to manually sync all episodes and that is
DB=150 or so, DBZ= 291, DBGT=64"
,allnone,2012-12-27T13:43Z,"Glad that you will be working on some personal projects, but will you be doing the second part of steins;gate soon? The first part was brilliant and I really want to see the second part.

There are 1080p files out there, but they are 900mb+ and I was looking for just the 720p, which you provide also. Just wanted to ask to know if I should try the 1080p files or if I can wait on yours."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-27T16:36Z,I suggest you go for the 1080p DHD files even tho they are full or Banding due to No filters.
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-27T17:03Z,"will it be on bluray or dvd But my guess is DVD cuz those shows are really really old  shows but still great .... so can we have sgt keroro cant find it on other groups even via irc rizon .I found most of the animes thanks if you could

IM looking forward for dball and get back
"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-27T18:20Z,"animelife, Dragonboxes are the best DB,DBZ will ever get, those DVDs are amazing there just as good or even better than the DBKai Blu rays"
,roundnut,2012-12-27T21:58Z,"hey Daman4life, Just wondering which ghibli movies will you be uploading. cheers"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-28T03:16Z,"That's amazing. I've been after a good quality collection of DBZ for a while. 

And could anyone please direct me to the 1080p DHD files of Steins;Gate part 2? I've been looking through most of the main sites, but they're all subbed, with only Part 1 being dubbed. Would be greatly appreciated. "
,mooserocka,2012-12-28T03:47Z,"dbz is ANOTHER crap anime that is going to take like 6 months to possibly upload everything. I never liked dbz how it took one epidode to throw one punch then 3 more to get maybe a fireball. It was just horrid. kaze no stigma and getbackers were AWESOME though. I can already see them whenever i want on netflix though. I cant beleive daman doesnt like anime with female leads, I actually find female lead anime WAY better then male lead IF there is no fanservice. Once in a while a little fanservice is ok but sometimes its just so much and it ruins the anime. Shangri la has no fanservice and its so good. I also heard NOTHIng but great things about 006 i wanna see that also it never came out in bluray though."
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-28T04:26Z,"Mooserocka, I think I've figured out why people often attack you for 'no reason'. 

It's all in how you word yourself: ''dbz is ANOTHER crap Anime''. The common consensus is that DBZ is one of the classic Anime of a time now lost to us. You may not like DBZ, moose, but you don't need to state it as if it were a fact. Remember: taste is subjective, and it varies from person to person. 

In my opinion I did not enjoy the series, Paranoia Agent, but this does not in itself make it a bad series.  
"
,darkcontrol1,2012-12-28T04:53Z,are you planning on uploading the second season of steins;gate?
,mooserocka,2012-12-28T05:13Z,I did state it as an opinion people should already know that? I should not have to say well my opinion is if people are too dumb to already have the common sence to figure it is an opinion then i cant help them lol. I also liked two anime and said how i like them. You clearly stuck to the negative of my opinion instead of the 2 positives.  wHAT IF SOMEONE DID NOT LIKE  the 2 animes i said were great then it would be the exact same thing. So was i saying getbackers and kaze no stigama were great and its a fact no. So i clearly dont understand what your getting at of course everything i say is opinion?
,mooserocka,2012-12-28T05:27Z,But it is a fact that each battle takes 30 episodes just for one fight. It is soo annoying and slow. And dbz is full of filler in the middle of them. The story is just terrible I do think the bad guys were pretty good up until boo. After i watched it i just felt like i wasted my life YES THIS IS MY OPINION. 
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-28T06:17Z,"You didn't state is as your opinion, you said it very blatantly and objectively. ''DBZ is another crap Anime''.

The problem is that you're assuming that the context, which may be obvious to you, is therefore obvious to everyone else as well; It isn't always. It's best to not assume people automatically understand you, especially on the internet. Because of this, you unintentionally offend people, because you assume they know you're joking. We don't know you personally, so how are we to know you are joking? We simply don't.

I'm just letting you know to be a little more clearer. It will save you a lot of trouble in the future. You know I'm not against you, moose, I'm just pointing this out for your benefit. 
"
,allnone,2012-12-29T01:18Z,"Actually, it is obvious that it's his opinion. He is talking about a subjective topic, which is an anime, and that should be clear to people that it is his opinion because a critic on a show cannot be a fact. He could say the artwork in DBZ was horrible and that can't be a fact because you can't prove that it is bad.

Now, if we were talking about something that could proven, you would have a point. He can't say the earth is flat because we know damn well that it isn't. Anybody's critic on a show is an opinion and people will always get offended by others opinions that they don't agree with. He may have been rude in his description, but it was clearly an opinion because it's impossible for it to be a fact."
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-29T05:07Z,"Allnone, while it's clear to an intelligent human being that an opinion is subjective, it isn't obvious to everyone. We already knew what he said was subjective per se; this goes without saying. The problem is how he carries his words which is what bothers other people, as if his perception on the subjective content itself is objective--or better somehow. 

I know Moose doesn't intend to come across this way, but other people on the internet don't know this and often misinterpret him as a result.

It's important to pay attention to how you convey yourself online. 

And as to whether he made his opinion clear that it was in fact [his] opinion, this too is disputable, as his obviousness of opinion comes down to a varying context dependent on the reader and how much they pick up on.
"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-29T08:16Z,OMG CAN WE JUST STAY OUT OF THIS. YES MOOSE IS GIVING HIS AND HIS ONLY OPINION SO CUT THIS CRAP OUT GUYS WE ALL TOTALLY HAVE A CLEAR THAT LOSTLEAF IS AVOIDING MOOSE TO GET INTO ANOTHER ARGUMENT SO ALLONE AND LOST LEAF SHUT UP WE KNOW THAT WE DONT WANNA FIGHT SO LET MOOSE BE HIMSELF ITS OUR PROBLEM TO GET IN FIGHT .SO WE TAKE RESPOSIBILITY
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-29T10:31Z,"Honestly, AnimeLife, get a hold of yourself and gain some composure. No one is attacking anyone. Half the time you're as incomprehensible as a drowning otter, so I don't quite know how to respond to your last comment. Bear in mind also, we, the community, do not wish to sift through the trail of spam and hostility you often leave behind. So yes, when you fight in a public place like this, it becomes everyone's business. 

Now, can you please stop with the theatrics? It's getting tiresome. 
"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-29T18:45Z,YOU KNOW LOST_LEAF ITS REALLY ANNOYING TO TALK TO U.YES YOUR GREAT BUT AND TIME YOUR JUST A WHORE .WELL SINCE WE WERE ALMOST GETTING FIGHT WITH PEOPLE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ITS RATHER BEST TO SHUT UP WHEN MOOSE WAS GIVING HIS OPINION AND YOU SAY ITS NOT AN OPINION SO IM JUST SAYING THAT YOU ARE LIKE PARENT THAY COULD GIVE GOOD EXAMPLES BUT AT TIMES LIKE THIS THEY ARE ANNOYING IDIOTS.SO ILL WILL IGNORE YOU WITH QUESTION MARKS TO GET YOUR TREATMENT .YOU KNOW WHAT IM TRIYING TO IGNORE YOU RIGHT KNOW.PLEASE DONT GIVE YOUR ANNOYING SHIT I RATHER SLEEP 24/7 RATHER THAN HEARING YOUR CRAP
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-29T19:11Z,You know me being an drowning otter .Than what are you THE GREAT MIGHTY EMPEROR Lost_Leaf yeah you act that you are doing the right thing but  your as annoying like as a Gorilla but why are acting like your always right sometimes your wrong too .You know your clogging all of the comment section .I'm bored with getting into fights or preventing one ill just get the same punishment
,mooserocka,2012-12-30T05:48Z,Im sure for how much i hate dbz there is someone who likes it just as much. MAybe that is even daman cause he said it was one of his all time favorites hes gotta like it if hes gonna spend all that time doin what he said he was gonna. Hey as long as he keeps putting out new anime while hes doin that and doesnt go into a dbz hybernation for 5 months it wont bother me at all. He has put out EVERY new anime except for shangri la and 006. So hes doing a great job. Next he needs to get out blood c on time. I heard its great. Blood plus is ANOTHER female LEAD anime that was AWESOME.  Saya is amazing. Yes it was clearly an opinion i get where lost leaf is comming from people on the internet are not smart and will take it as im stating a fact. 
,mooserocka,2012-12-30T05:54Z,Another thing Me and lost leaf were NOT fighting at all. If anything it was a debate about weather it was an opinion. The other guy had some good insight. He was right i could have said it in a less rude way but i chose not to just cause im tired of mainstream anime. I dont take ANYthing lost leaf says personaly in fact i learn from what he says SOMETIMES. IF i dont agree with it im sure he doesnt care as much as i dont. The only time i EVER fought with people was when they said something about my mother who is dead and cant defend herself. Other then that I take nothing ANYONE says personally. The otter crack had me really LOL i was like WHAT!!! 
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-30T11:06Z,yeah IM sometime agree to Lost_Leaf BUT he must realize that some agree and some dont (not saying that you dont) .Its good to give advice which are useful but you gotta save your advices and poem until its a good timing to use it.Im sorry dont take stuff i say personally cuz it runs im my blood at time when im mad .No i was only avoiding a fight before it gets mass effect not only at you guys but with everyone else(maybe other people get into the fight who is gonna defend them) Like massacre it doesnt make  one person traumatized but many others of people.
,mooserocka,2012-12-31T05:51Z,What is no6 is so gay mean? Does it mean gay like omg horrible or gay like Gravition. I have heard nothing but good things and saw an amv and the art was nice. You then said you will never put an anime of THAT genre up what genre is this. IS it that bad? It doesnt look like it has a female lead although i still dont understand what is bad about having a female lead yet lol. 
,FireIsHot,2012-12-31T20:05Z,"@Daman4life - Hi I've downloaded quite a bit of your stuff. My problem is with this and the latest dub Naruto Shippuden Movie. 

I can't convert them. The movie gets all glitchy, and these as soon as they are put into a converter the video grays out. Yet the original files are fine, any suggestions (other than the obvious one of watching on my Computer)

Thanks!"
[V],Daman4Iife,2013-01-01T08:10Z,"fireishot: are you using a Program that supports 10bit>8bit conversion if not that is the problem.

Try out Handbrake, Staxrip."
,mooserocka,2013-01-03T00:11Z,Just dl the naruto movies somewhere else its mainstream i bet like 100 other people have it uploaded.
