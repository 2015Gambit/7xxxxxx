,indie69,2012-12-29T09:49Z,"gaspanic, what sort of problem are you having? Not enough seeds? I see over 20, and I'm one of them. I'd like to help, but I'm not sure what is happening. Is it really slow? Or just nothing?"
,indie69,2012-12-29T22:04Z,"If you mean it literally.. as in the magnet link works but you cannot download the torrent file itself, you'll have to upgrade your client. There's nothing I can do about that one."
,dragonbandit314,2012-12-30T23:48Z,"Hi Indie, No problems at my end. Another great compilation. Many thanks.
All the best to you and yours for 2013.
Be well. T."
