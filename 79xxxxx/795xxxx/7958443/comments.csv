[T],murphy78,2012-12-26T10:04Z,"OK so maybe 250GB worth of uploads for one holiday is a bit excessive...

This will probably be a one-time-only release. Next year I'm sure the cumulative updates will exceed the single-layer size for x64 and be even more of a pain in the rear.

I think I'll probably seed these alt-lang-packs till the January patch date.  Please help me out if you appreciate this sort of work guys."
,vze2mp9g,2012-12-27T04:23Z,"@murphy78 You are a very kind soul.. You work hard at what you do, and you are honest and reliable. You don't see those types of people very often, but when I do, I let them know, and you are one of those peoples. I'll try to seed for a month.
I just have one question, I was able to find all the tools you used except for one, oscdimg for ISO mastering, can you clue me in where I can find it? Thank You. :)

Happy New Years to you and everyone on TPB! ! ! "
[T],murphy78,2012-12-27T08:13Z,"thanks for the kind words vze... you can find it in the waik or adk software.  Those are the gui style integration tools from microsoft, but oscdimg is a command line utility that you have to use from admin command prompt.

,Sonic_27,2012-12-28T15:43Z,Does anybody know a program on how to change the wallpaper on the app side??
,Sonic_27,2012-12-28T15:50Z,"Let me put it a better way, your own wallpaper on the app side not the Windows wallpapers??"
[T],murphy78,2012-12-31T22:23Z,"Open charms bar with winkey+c or mouse to a right corner.

Click settings. Click Change PC Settings. Click on the Start Screen tab.

This is how to switch between something like 10 pre-installed background patterns.

For custom backgrounds on the start screen, you need to use a customization program like one at:
