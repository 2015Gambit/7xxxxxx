Hard of hearing and/or deaf people use sub titles"

,muddicks,2012-12-28T12:18Z,Not a single rating above. Bunch of absolute spastics.
,pipetrain,2012-12-28T19:03Z,"I live in Spain, my gf doesn't understand english good enough, so she needs the subtitles. Not everyone knows english perfectly!! *sigh*.. british people..."
,Jakez93,2012-12-28T21:50Z,@mr2old It's easier to follow if you have english subtitle. And english is not my first language. 
,victrois,2012-12-28T23:30Z,"to all the people asking for english subs. I'm surprised anyone from another country would even want to see a movie about Abraham Lincoln. maybe yall are confusing this movie with the other one. he doesn't kill vampires in this one. its a historical drama about a us president,... who presided over the nation during the war between werewolves and leprechauns for american gold"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-12-28T23:57Z,"""maybe yall are confusing this movie with the other one. he doesn't kill vampires in this one.""

I laughed."

,molly_dog,2012-12-30T03:54Z,"One more time cuz I still don't understand. 

Why do we need English subtitles for a movie about ""Abenersham"" Lincoln that was made in America by sighing Americans who are for this Illinois lawyer because he's on the $5 note but, despite his winning a second term, nobody seems to admit that they like the lawyer who most recently lived in Illinois (after somehow duping the entire immigration department and the entire US government when he came here after having grown up as a Muslim in Kenya) before moving to the White House which, ironically, he might not have been able to do had the first Illinois lawyer, about whom this sigh-inducing American movie is made, not gotten passed by Congress the Emancipation Proclamation which essentially said, ""Y'all slaves are all free. Go forth and sin no more. Y'all slave-owners don't like it, y'all can kiss my lily-white ass that looks better than my face, BTW. An' if y'all don't want to do that then simply f**k off 'cuz I learned a long time ago about trying to please ever'body all the time--it just AIN'T hap'nin'"".

Did I miss anything? 8-D"
