murphy78 presents Windows 8 Pro Alt-Lang-Pack 6of7
These are isos created with the same dism scripts as my en-US
release using different language MSDN source files.
They include KB file hotfix integration current to Dec Patch date
I have tested them all.

No Windows 8 Settings were harmed in the making of this ISO.
No Programs are added.
No Unattended Settings were added to the installation.
No Registry Settings were modified.

1) Burn ISO to DVDR or copy the contents to a usb drive.
2) Boot from the setup DVD or USB drive or run setup.exe to upgrade
3) This does not ask for a product key, but you can enter one later
4) The only activation that generates legit files is KMS.

Activate and re-activate with any kms server by typing
the following commands in admin command prompt:
SLMGR -IPK NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
SLMGR -SKMS xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx
SLMGR -ATO

Insert an actual online KMS server there, don't just
type x's. Search web for online kms servers.

--OR--

Use the KMSNano program.
Extract lanano_v10.zip to a directory
You will need to extract the kmsnano.exe file with winrar or 7zip
Run the fix hacktivations.cmd (This checks all sys files and sets
your windows to volume to enable correct kms activation)

Then just run kmsnano.exe and wait a few mins (theres no progress
bar or completion windows) Check task manager or run the
check_activation.cmd after a couple mins.
