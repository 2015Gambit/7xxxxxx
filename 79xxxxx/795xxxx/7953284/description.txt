A premium version of VNC Viewer, including support for the 2010 Intel Core vPro Processor Family.

PCs with the 2010 Intel Core vPro Processor Family enjoy the benefit of a VNC Server embedded directly onto the chip, providing remote access capability and manageability functions. A RealVNC collaboration with Intel's ground-breaking hardware has produced VNC Viewer Plus, capable of connecting to the remote computer out-of-band.

VNC Viewer Plus will also connect to VNC Enterprise Edition, VNC Personal Edition and VNC Free Edition servers running in-band. The benefits from the additional functionality of connecting to a VNC Server in-band include file transfer, remote printing, chat and more. Protocol-compliant third party VNC projects may also accept an incoming connection from VNC Viewer Plus.
