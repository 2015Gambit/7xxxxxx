 
AmericaΓÇÖs most sought-after executive coach shows how to climb the last few rungs of the ladder.
 
 
The corporate world is filled with executives, men and women who have worked hard for years to reach the upper levels of management. TheyΓÇÖre intelligent, skilled, and even charismatic. But only a handful of them will ever reach the pinnacle -- and as executive coach Marshall Goldsmith shows in this book, subtle nuances make all the difference. These are small "transactional flaws" performed by one person against another (as simple as not saying thank you enough), which lead to negative perceptions that can hold any executive back. Using GoldsmithΓÇÖs straightforward, jargon-free advice, itΓÇÖs amazingly easy behavior to change.
 
Executives who hire Goldsmith for one-on-one coaching pay $250,000 for the privilege. With this book, his help is available for 1/10,000th of the price.
