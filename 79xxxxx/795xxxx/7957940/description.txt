Stephen Fry: Gadget Man
Stephen Fry welcomes us into his wonderful world of tech, from the everyday to the extraordinary. Stephen doesn't live life like the rest of us. He doesn't get caught in traffic jams, doesn't have to push his own shopping trolley or even hold his own toothbrush - instead he relies on his collection of trusty gadgets to make his life run smoothly. In this show Stephen tries out all the products and prototypes he can lay his hands on, gadgets from the future, gadgets from the past, life-changing ones and sweet little gizmos that will change the way you live your life tomorrow. And he does it all in the company of some of his famous friends. Every week Stephen also creates his very own super gadget. Or at least tries to.


1)  Super Commuter 
Stephen and his guest Jonathan Ross look at how gadgets can make the daily commute more bearable and more fun. Gadgets include a very unconventional electric car, a very unusual bicycle and a 3D headset. And Stephen attempts to beat the traffic jams by creating his own fantasy super-vehicle.

2)  Tasty Tech 
Stephen takes a look at how gadgets can make shopping and cooking so much easier and far more entertaining. He escorts the world's only driverless shopping trolley around the supermarket, tests high-end barbecues and tries out an array of fancy kitchen gadgets as he prepares to host a spectacular dinner party for his friends Derren Brown, Carol Vorderman and Jo Brand.

3)  Work Made Easy 
Stephen examines devices that make work easier and more fun and meets up with Lord Sugar to road test some of the latest work-saving gizmos. There's also a coffee machine that talks to your phone. Stephen plays around with some of Lord Sugar's early inventions. Other gadgets covered in this episode include a pen that transcribes notes direct to your computer, and an executive sleep pod.

4)  Fun and Games 
This time Stephen looks at how gadgets entertain us. There's a remote-controlled pet, an automatic cocktail-maker and a futuristic pool-table machine that lines up your shots for you. There's also Jeremy Clarkson, who joins Stephen in a bid to overhaul traditional pub games by replacing them with gadgets. And Stephen tries to build the world's biggest computer game.

5)  Body Beautiful 
Stephen looks at how new technology can help keep us fit and healthy. He road-tests some of the latest gym gadgets and gets a makeover from Amy Childs, from The Only Way is Essex, using some weird and wonderful beauty devices. Some of the gadgets on the show include an app which predicts how long you will live, the world's most incredible treadmill and a device that claims to make you slimmer in just 30 minutes. And Stephen attempts to build the ultimate running machine that will enable him to race against double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes.

6)  Christmas Special 
In this one-off Christmas special, Stephen Fry brings his insight and wit to bear on gadgets from Christmases past. Drawing on unusual and entertaining archive footage, Stephen surveys how Christmas and gadgets go together like mince pies and cream, as he takes a wry look at toys, snow, decorations and Christmas dinner.
