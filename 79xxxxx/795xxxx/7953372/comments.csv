That is what has been reported to me.  It will say corrupt data.   But works on all other models as far as I know.

,timemann,2013-01-05T22:29Z,Where Are you suppose to put it i have the psp 3000 and it still says currupt data
,crwildman,2013-01-09T08:41Z,"No idea, it seems to be working for some people and not others.  

Do you have custom firmware installed?  If you do and it still doesn't work, then try this:

Search for ""Lamecraft psp survival download"" on google.  It should yield you some results.  

This is called ""Lamecraft"" it is a clone of minecraft. 

Good luck"
