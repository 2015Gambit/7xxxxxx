,meagain01,2012-12-25T00:15Z,many tnx
,crwildman,2012-12-25T07:21Z,"This is the best video of Life of Pi that is available and in english.  It isn't clearly stated in the description or can be a bit misleading because it says ""Asian""  but it is all in English and very good quality.  The best out so far.  There is also No HARDCODED Subs like stated in the description. 

There are no foreign speaking parts.  No hardcoded subs.  You obviously didn't look at the video and just uploaded from ssomeone elses description.

Merry Fucking Christmas... Going to watch this rest of this right now.  :)   I'll be seeding all xmas enjoy

,crwildman,2012-12-25T08:00Z,"Ok so There is some parts in the movie where they speak another language, and there are subtitles.  But this is normal for any movies, including the ones playing at the theaters now.  I just checked on the cam's from the ones playing now in english.  This is just normal for any movie.  and when the DVD comes out you still going to have a few parts in another language with subtitles.. But most all the movie is spoken in english.  with very few subtitles."

Whoever is using the camera doesn't understand how to use the focus. The whole film is soft.

,ledamay,2013-01-10T18:13Z,"I have also noticed many times I was unable to unRAR and there is an easy way to fix that.

Remove the torrent from the list. Close Torrent. Reopen it and get that same torrent again.
It will CHECK then resume fixing the CRC gaps in the RAR files. Sometimes you have to do this a couple times before the RAR will extract properly"
