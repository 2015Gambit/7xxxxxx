,Amafule10,2012-12-26T15:34Z,"You can still download torrent files from piratebay. Here is the trick:
1) At the end of the URL of the torrent add:  "".torrent""
2) Then after ""http://"" and before ""thepiratebay"" write ""torrents.""
3) Delete the word ""/torrent"" in the middle of the URL (after ""piratebay.se"" and before the number)"

,tflagger997,2012-12-26T21:12Z,"@hxxq - It actually effect many players, including some of the newer computer hardware so it was a valid question.  

So is it protected by Cinavia or not?"

,SugerHigh,2012-12-27T08:42Z,"Those asking about Cinavia. I will post after downloading to let you know... 

Unless you download and test first, then please let us know."
,Fresh101,2012-12-27T13:37Z,"Hey Yify, I love your videos and ready formatted for iPad. What program you recommend to use for burning to a DVD-R leaving it a the same ""RESOLUTION"" of the source or at least higher than what I am getting now? I currently use ""ConvertXtoDVD"" and it lower it to 720x480.

Thanks in advance"

,Prince_of_Ravens,2012-12-27T21:03Z,People still crying about Cinavia? Either plug your computer into your TV or get a WD Media Center...
,mrmouth,2012-12-28T01:40Z,"PS3 is also a media player... 

And fortunately Cinavia is dying a slow death like most every other expensive DRM has done. The studios realize it isn't cost effective."
,Lyono,2012-12-28T02:07Z,"Yify you convert from 1080p but why not 5.1 sound, if the size will be big then please make 1 more file for 5.1, 2 channel sound is so out dated. Please please upgrade to 5.1"
,SugerHigh,2012-12-28T10:35Z,"NO Cinavia - WATCHED ENTIRE MOVIE ON PS3 WITH NO PROBLEMS.

Shitty movie though, just saying... chick is hot though."

,Meadows_zeta,2012-12-30T23:44Z,"How dare you compress 1080p into 1.5 GB?

If I wanted to watch artifacts, I'd go to youtube. ...Well, off I go to BOXZ's release instead."
,pirateYoho,2012-12-31T02:13Z,"@..zeta
  How dare he?  How dare you? 
YIFY makes the best torrents, and we appreciate that he doesnt need more than 1.5gb! to make you look like a fool for critiSIZING him!
Enjoy your box.. and gfy!"

,codeir,2013-01-01T01:52Z,Thank you! I love All of YIFY's releases! Very resourceful! God bless your team :D
,Far-Q,2013-01-01T12:21Z,Torrent quality is good played without a problem...Cheers! :)
,sharpshot94549,2013-01-01T16:23Z,"@ everyone here besides meadows_zeta apparently

If you have some free time, download this one, and also download either of the 2 1080p's from BOZX. Watch this one in the dark areas and the action heavy areas, then watch the BOZX one at the same areas. I can see a difference between the 2 on my 17 inch laptop screen, you guys who put them on your big screen tv's should be able to as well. the only reason I see for downloading this YIFY releases would be for iPad's or iPhones for the 720p ones. Also, i find it funny that hardly anyone ever complains on the audio on these, because its 2.0, not even 5.1 let alone blu-ray standard 7.1. The audio tracks on BOZX's releases are the size of this one. "
,lotharian,2013-01-01T21:48Z,"As usual, great job YIFY !

A=9
V=9

If you like films about ""justice warriors"", you can't lose it. But it's just another movie of violent justice with poor argument and many shots.
"
,Ginjasnapz,2013-01-02T23:37Z,"@pirateYoho, stop being an ass-kiss!  YIFY does not make the best torrents!  There are plenty others who do a better job and without all the hard-coded english subs attached to all his torrents!  Why put hard-coded english subs on an english movie? "
,UAofE,2013-01-04T08:23Z,"A: 8

1995 Judge Dredd was better in every way than this movie. Better plot, acting and sets.

This movie is just violence and effects with a poor plot, no character development and no humor. People that give it a high rating have not actually watched the original."
,alejandro70pb,2013-01-05T00:53Z,GRACIAS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Nako995,2013-01-07T23:45Z,YIFY WTF this is not 1080p !!! THIS IS 720p !! asshole 
,diabloson,2013-01-09T02:02Z,"YIFY makes consistently good torrents. Some of you don't like it you can just FOff. Download something or somewhere else.

I almost never comment but I had to come out and say thanks for constant good work YIFY"
,SaveCash,2013-01-10T06:27Z,Perfect. Let them keep them bitching about whatever- it is perfect.
