Selected Problems and Theorems in  Elementary Mathematics - Arithmetic and Algebra

by D. O. Shklyarsky,  N. N. Chentsov and I. M. Yaglom. 

  This book contains the conditions of problems, the answers and hints
  to them and ihe solutions of the problems. The conditions of the
  most difficult problems are marked by stars. 

  Most of the problems in the book are independent of one another
  except those in the last hvo sections ("Complex Numbers" and
  "Several Problems in Number Theory") where the problems are more
  closely interrelated. 

  This book was translated from the Russian by V. M. Volosov and
  I. G. Volosova. The book was published by first Mir Publishers in
  1978.
