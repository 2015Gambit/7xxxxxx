Love and Mathematics: Sofya Kovalevskaya  
by Pelageya Kochina. 

This book was edited by A. Yu. Ishlinsky and Z. K. Sokolovskaya.  

  The sheer personality of Sofya Kovalevskaya, the renowned Russian
  woman mathematician, was so remarkable, multifaceted, and
  interesting that the great Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen said to
  write her biography would need a poem. My aim in writing this book
  is different and somewhat more modest: it is to present the basic
  information about her life from the numerous sources available.

  This book was translated from the Russian by Michael Burov. The
  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1985.
