Plot:

In 'The Philadelphia Experiment', a secret government research project tries reviving the World War II 

"Philadelphia Experiment," which was an attempt to create a cloaking device to render warships invisible. When the 

experiment succeeds, it brings back the original ship (the Eldridge) that disappeared during the first test in 

1943 - which brings death and destruction to the 21st century. It's up to the sole survivor (Lea) of the first 

experiment and his granddaughter (Ullerup) to stop it.

Notes:
why so small sized.. x264 codec allows a lot of compression therefore allowing you to use lower bitrates by 

keeping constant quality...(CRF encoding...) sample included enjoy.
