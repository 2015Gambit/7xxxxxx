But when the USA is finally bankrupt, it'll be a good thing for the rest of the world, as that means the number one supporter of war, terrorism, occupation, landmine, and weapons manufacturer, will no longer be able to invade, destroy, murder, destabilize, install puppet regimes, support other illegitimate governments... and we can all live in a more peaceful world.

PS. Obama is just as bad as Romney. Only Ron Paul MIGHT have made a difference."

I believe that the Founding Fathers had no concept of what we would be facing in the 21st century, so what they tried to do 200+ years ago is irrelevant. Ron Paul is not the answer, and neither is the neo-con ""Tea Party""."
