On Halim Natacha Atlas made her own Middle Eastern record. It's not traditional, by any means, but it's in the tradition: songs of love and spirit. In terms of arrangements there are plenty of concessions to the West, but there's absolutely no doubt where it's all rooted. This is all for the best. Atlas is a world-class singer, but on these songs she can really let herself go, reach back into herself and squeeze out every ounce of emotion.
