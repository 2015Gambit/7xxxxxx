An interesting viewpoint on one of the possible ways in which society could develop in a post apocalyptic situation. It has been a long long time since the modern man destroyed themselves and what humans do exist in this time, do not remember what happened to destroy the world. All they have is their semi nomadic life, and their battle circles. The only thing that gives them a feeling of justice or stability in this hostile world.
