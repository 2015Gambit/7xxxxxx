User Review

Chato's Land" was well suited to Bronson's evolutionary screen persona, that of the strong, relatively silent avengerΓÇöa solid figure of firm intention but few wordsΓÇª

As Pardon Chato, the vengeful Apache half-breed, Bronson enjoyed the most vocally reticent role of his starring career, speaking but few linesΓÇöand most of those in Apache!

Again, Spanish locations represented the American frontier West for this post-Civil War tale about a white posse's search for Chato, who, in self-defense, had killed the sheriff of a small New Mexico townΓÇª As the pursuers forge deeper into Apache country, the situation shifts around, with hunters becoming the huntedΓÇª Failing out among themselves, the posse members gradually become victim either to each other's violence or to Chato's well-justified vengeance, after they rape his womanΓÇª

In the non-U.S. countries where Bronson enjoyed his greatest popularity, "Chato's Land" was well met and highly successfulΓÇª
