From Wiki:


Jon and Vangelis is the collaborative effort between the singer Jon Anderson (the lead vocalist of the progressive rock band Yes) and the Greek synthesizer musician Vangelis. Together they released a number of successful albums in the 1980s.

In 1974, Vangelis was considered as a replacement for Rick Wakeman as keyboardist in Yes, and although the job went to Patrick Moraz, it led to several collaborations with Anderson, who contributed vocals to Vangelis' Heaven and Hell (1975), harp to Opera Sauvage (1979), and vocals to See You Later (1980).

Anderson left Yes between 1980 and 1983, and during this time the collaboration with Vangelis began in earnest. The two recorded several albums between 1979 and 1991, producing the major hits "I Hear You Now" (UK No. 8), "I'll Find My Way Home" (UK No. 6)[1] and "The Friends of Mr. Cairo" (Canada No. 1). Anderson wrote the lyrics, and Vangelis composed the music.

In 1986, Jon & Vangelis made a few attempts at writing a new album, but much of this work was never officially released under the Jon and Vangelis name. Twelve tracks were compiled on 1991's Page of Life, while other songs from these sessions appeared in later works, including "Let's Pretend", the last song on the 1989 album Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe. Anderson ultimately took it upon himself to re-work Page of Life, which was released in 1998 in the United States only with nine tracks. Vangelis did not approve this, and it is cited as the reason for the dissolution of their collaboration.[2] "Sing With Your Eyes" appeared in 1991, as a B-side on the CD single release of "Wisdom Chain" / "Page of Life". 


The Friends of Mr. Cairo 1981

The Friends of Mr Cairo is the second album by Jon and Vangelis, released in 1981. There are two editions of this album, with different sleeves. Both versions were released in 1981 within a few weeks of each other. The title track, "The Friends Of Mr Cairo", peaked at #1 on the Canadian singles late 1981, though this track was not a hit elsewhere. The second edition of the album includes the single "I'll Find My Way Home", which stayed for 14 weeks in the Swiss charts and peaked at #1 on March 7, 1982. "State of Independence" was later a hit single for Donna Summer, and a decade later for Moodswings with Chrissie Hynde on vocal. Anderson also later re-recorded that song on his solo album Change We Must, released in 1994.

The title track and its accompanying music video serve as an ode to classic Hollywood films of the 30s and 40s. Most notable references are to the classic film noir The Maltese Falcon. The track incorporates sound effects and voice impressions of the stars of the era most notably Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre and Jimmy Stewart. During the track, a screeching of tyres and a car horn are heard, presumably as a car makes its getaway. This screeching sound/car horn is identical to that heard in the 1970 feature film 'Get Carter' (at 1.1.52-1.1.56), and was probably sampled for use on the track. Joel Cairo (Mr Cairo) is the name of the character played by Peter Lorre in the Maltese Falcon.
