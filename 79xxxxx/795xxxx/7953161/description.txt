This is a collection of Middle-Earth related writings by J.R.R. Tolkien. It includes searchable PDFs of the first nine volumes of The History of Middle Earth, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and the Tolkien Reader. Also it includes commercial EPUBs of the rest of his Middle-Earth writings. The scans new--not the old OCR EPUBs. Also included are high resolution scans in case anyone wants to make proper EPUBs, though given the formatting it won't be easy. I would be interested in scans of the last three volumes if anyone has them.

Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (new PDF)
