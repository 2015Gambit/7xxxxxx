Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises 

All release are done in 1080P with respective audio which title came with.

Batman Begins and the The Dark Knight use Dolby True HD which I have included.

Dark Knight Rises use DTS HD Master Audio which I have included as well.


First three screenshot are from batman begins, next three from dark knight and last three dark knight rises.

Also my rips can be played directly on blu-ray player without additional processing.
