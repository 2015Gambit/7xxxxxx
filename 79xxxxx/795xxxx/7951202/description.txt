On August 10, 2012, Victoria Justice stated that the series would not be renewed.[3] Justice also said that Victorious was the number one show on Nick and she did not know why it was cancelled.[4] Dan Schneider added in a blog post that Nickelodeon often ends shows after about 60 episodes. Even though he and the cast would have been willing to shoot more episodes, the network decided to end the series. He also denied rumors that Victorious is ending because of its new spin-off show, Sam & Cat.[5] Although the Victorious cast only filmed three seasons, when the series was cancelled, Nickelodeon split the third season in half, making a fourth season.[4] The third and final soundtrack was released on November 6, 2012 and entitled Victorious 3.0.
