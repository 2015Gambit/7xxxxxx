Problems in Higher Algebra
by D. Faddeev, L. Sominsky 

This book of problems in higher algebra grew out of a course
of instruction at the Leningrad State University and the Herzen
Pedagogical Institute. It is designed for students of universities
and teacher's colleges as a problem book in higher algebra.

The problems included here are of two radically different types. On
the one hand, there are a large number of numerical examples aimed at
developing computational skills and illustrating the basic
propositions of the theory. The authors believe that the number of
problems is sufficient to cover work in class, at home and for tests.

On the other hand, there are a rather large number of problems
of medium difficulty and many which will demand all the ini-
tiative and ingenuity of the student. Many of the problems of
this category are accompanied by hints and suggestions to be
found in Part II. These problems are starred.

Answers are given to all problems, some of the problems are
supplied with detailed solutions.


  This book was translated from the Russian by George Yankovsky. The
  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1978.
