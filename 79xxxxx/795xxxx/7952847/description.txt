While soaring through the sky in their fabulous Dreamship, Reader Rabbit and Sam the Lion notice an unusual island in the waters below. As they swoop down for a closer look, a strange object shoots up from the island and begins wrapping up the ship. Forced off the Dreamship, they find themselves in a new land called Balloon Town. To get their Dreamship back, you must help Reader Rabbit and Sam the Lion collect 5 musical instruments to wake the sleeping Bull that guards the palace where the ship is kept.
