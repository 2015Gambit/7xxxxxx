Jayke Orvis - It`s All Been Said (2010) mp3


Jayke Orvis is an ex member of the 357.string band and current Goddam gallows. Its all been said, is his first solo record, released in 2010 by Farmageddon records (a cool record label for outlaw/punk country music). Jayke Orvis is a killer mandoline player and his music could be described as sinister hillbilly. the songs are good, the playing top notch and the vocals allright even if you're not that much into hillbilly singing style. it's really among the cool records from the dark & punk side of country music.
