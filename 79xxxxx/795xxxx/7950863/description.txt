Chicago hotel clerk Frank Harris dreams of life as a cowboy, and he gets his chance when, jilted by the father of the woman he loves, he joins Tom Reece and his cattle-driving outfit. Soon, though, the tenderfoot finds out life on the range is neither what he expected nor what he's been looking for.

User Review

Delmer Daves was very successful with this film, about how a young hotel clerk (Lemmon) becomes a cowboy, but most of all how he becomes a man. Daves takes us on journey, driving a cattle herd from Mexico to finally place them on the Santa Fe train bound for Chicago, and he manages to keep us interested every moment. There is a snake, an Indian attack, wild horses, a cattle stampede, cowboys fighting...What is impressive is the efficiency with which Glenn Ford commands the operation, no time is lost, everything must be done to deliver the herd with as few losses as possible. Lemmon starts becoming like Ford, obsessed about his task, when they both learn something about human values.
