Starting out as a simple bedroom studio project, guitarist Keshav Dhar has seen Skyharbor quickly evolve into one of India's hottest metal prospects, with huge admiration coming in from some of the biggest names in metal worldwide. An astonishing amount of buzz surround in the bands first ever performance at the Bacardi NH7 festival in Pune, India earlier this year, where they played to over 1,000 people and were one of the weekend's highlights. The long awaited debut album from Skyharbor promises to be a landmark release for the Indian independent music scene, in no small part thanks to the incredible number of international guest appearances it will see, including the likes of Marty Fiedman (Ex Megadeth), Daniel Tompkins (Tesseract), Vishal J. Singh (Amogh Symphony) and Sunnieth Revankar (Bhayank Muat)
