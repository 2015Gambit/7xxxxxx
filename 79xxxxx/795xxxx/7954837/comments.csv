Had to jump through a few loops however to make it work. First off, The Unarchiver would report a corrupted archive, which is wrong because 7z extracted everything just fine. Secondly, the game wouldn't start, the executeable flag was missing, I had to do 

chmod a+x ./F1 2012.app/Contents/MacOS/F1 2012

to get it to work. After that, just click play as the instructions say."

,anthony0224,2012-12-26T15:03Z,"If you are on a Mac, BetterZip will allow you to unzip this file correctly also. All i did was unzip with betterzip then play, works great."
,PS13DOD,2012-12-26T15:07Z,"I download this 2 times all ready and still have issue if checksum is failed. How to unpack this to f12012.app ?? Any ideas ?? I`m use ""The Unarchiver"" to extract this to one file."
,mojo-666,2012-12-26T22:23Z,"Problem with ""The Unarchiver"" has been reported before: http://code.google.com/p/theunarchiver/issues/detail?id=594"
,lostinostin,2012-12-26T22:24Z,@anthony0224 I used BetterZip but it only creates one zip file of the 42 .rar files...how do I play?
,o.rashid,2012-12-27T01:18Z,god damn people need to seed
,lostinostin,2012-12-27T05:01Z,"Ok so because this is a split archive, simply open mo-f12012.r00.  This is the first file in the download.  However, if you use the Unarchiver, it will tell you there are a couple of files that are corrupt and I don't know how to get around this problem.  @mojo-666 suggested using 7-zip will extract the .rar files without any problems, however, 7-zip is a windows application, so I don't know how to get past this problem."
,mojo-666,2012-12-27T05:41Z,"@lostinostin: the first main rar file isn't mo-f12012.r00, it is mo-f12012.rar. Also I didn't write anything about 7-zip, I wrote 7z, which is a native OS X command line app."
,mikehouston09,2012-12-28T11:28Z,fist get the unrarx free  after install unrarx grab all the file and drop to the box of unrarx and waite until he finish and boom u have the f1 and then drop the f1 to the application thanks

,Radeanus,2012-12-28T17:17Z,"@mojo-666

Could you be more specific on how to use the
chmod a+x ./F1 2012.app/Contents/MacOS/F1 2012?

I guess I should use Terminal but a just copy/paste doesn't do the trick :("
,mojo-666,2012-12-29T03:12Z,"@Radeanus: problem is PB chokes the backslash. Well suppose you installed the game in /Applications then this should work:

chmod a+x Applications/F1\ 2012.app/Contents/MacOS/F1\ 2012

If there are no backslashes then you have to add  one after each ""F1"". HTH."
,mojo-666,2012-12-29T03:13Z,"crap I missed the first slash..

chmod a+x /Applications/F1\ 2012.app/Contents/MacOS/F1\ 2012"
,Radeanus,2012-12-29T09:54Z,"Worked flawlessly...

Thank you!"
,kax3,2013-01-04T15:37Z,"No problem with unpacking using Stuffit. Thank you thenoobish, for the upload. 

I bought this game for PC cause I thought it was not available for Mac. Now I don't have to reboot my Mac as PC just to play :)"
