,QborT,2012-12-26T19:06Z,I love the fact that tykoon uploads this with the wrong title so it ends up in the wrong section and instead of simply deleting the torrent and clearing the hash to re-up the torrent properly.   He/she just deletes the comments of those that complain.  Fucking priceless (and I assume this comment will disapear soon enough).
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-12-27T03:36Z,"thank you tykoon ,  honestly some people make a big deal out of a simple mistake , it's not as if you had the wrong movie in title . and you said sorry . 
Theres just no pleasing some people . "
[M],Hero,2012-12-27T20:26Z,"QborT: The funny thing is that only mods (nasty people like me) are able to delete comments. And since I am paying special attention to every comment made in tykoon123 torrents lately, a looot of comments are being removed and a lot of trolls are getting banned. 

As you can see, I love my job :)"
