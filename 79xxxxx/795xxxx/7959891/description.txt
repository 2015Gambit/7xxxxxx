Team dynamics:
* FIFA Manager 13 comes alive with a team analysis feature called
"Team Matrix", as well as a hierarchy pyramid, which allows you to
visualize which players are facing challenges in the team pecking order
In the Team Dynamics section you get an overview of team hierarchy
rivalry, personality clashes, personal goals, family relationships and
much more
* Your assistant manager helps you to analyse the team, and requesting a
psychological profile of a player before signing him might help avoid
future problems
* The new individual player objectives have a special role, and your team
will be successful only with enough team leaders and everyone pulling in
the same direction. From balancing player rivalries to spending enough
time understanding and setting player expectations, FIFA Manager 13 will
push you to perfect the art of team management

Player objectives:
* Every player of the team has his personal objectives. Some want to become
a first team regular, others want to play for their country
