Don't download this unless you're ok with seeing Swedish subtitles you can't get rid of."

The subtitle are muxxed in as all my bluray releases, that means you can turn them off.
In VLC, go to Video meny, and subtitles then Disable and the subtitle will be off :)"

I see, you're right.  You can disable the Subtitles.  Sorry for the mishap.  Thanks for the download!"
