A powerful and mysterious supervillain has imprisoned the worldΓÇÖs greatest superheroes, forcing them to fight to the death until there is but one victor. ItΓÇÖs kill or be killed as we settle the score on all those hypothetical superhero match-ups in the ultimate DEATHMATCH.

Written by industry legend Paul Jenkins (SENTRY, INHUMANS) and drawn by comics superstar Carlos Magno (PLANET OF THE APES, TRANSFORMERS), DEATHMATCH is a dark, psychological deconstruction of the superhero genre that canΓÇÖt be missed.
