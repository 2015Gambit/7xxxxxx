   The road from youth to adulthood is     
   paved with myriad emotions and Student  
   Of The Year celebrates this colorful    
   coming of age. It is the story of       
   Abhimanyu and Rohan who traverse the pat
   of competition, envy, triumph, failure, 
   manipulation and heartbreak in their    
   mini-universe of St. Teresa's High Schoo
   Dehradun.                               
   As new ambitions are born and old loyalt
   fall by the wayside, each segment of the
   Student Of The Year competition manages 
   to tear apart both, the participants and
   spectators, to redefine the choices of t
   three protagonists.
