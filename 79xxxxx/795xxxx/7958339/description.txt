For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, I put my faith in:
V=8
A=8
.
No Pre-Screening as 2HD has wrested tonight's show from LOL's evil clutches
Off for Christmas or a permanent bequeath, only time will tell. Finger's crossed.

And as a special tribute to this momentous changing of the Rizzoli guard:
Follow along with me, our beloved "Scene-into-the-treacherous-land-of-MP4" RGs:
LOL is still strongly in first place with 154 errors and NOT a source of tonight's show.
ASAP is far behind with a paltry 7 errors
2HD (Newly crowned as source for tonight's show) in third with a measely 2 errors
There is a five-way tie for fourth place with but 1 error each
The rest of the pack are bunched up in the back stretch in a 6-way tie of perfection:
YesTV=0 | TLA=0 | MOMENTUM=0 | FTP=0 | SYS=0 | EVOLVE=0
Give them all a round of applause and please tip your waitress on the way out.

This has been a production of MP4SUX who has sole responsibility
for the facts presented here tonight with the usual disclaimer:
I only report on errors that I have personally documented.
List available on demand ONLY with the permission of our gracious management.
Heavy is the head that now beams energy direct from the coveted green skull.
Any misrepresentation of who is or is not a RG of "The Scene" is unintentinal.
Corrections to any of these presumed facts will be rigorously investigated
And if warranted, many lashes in the public square will take place soonest.
