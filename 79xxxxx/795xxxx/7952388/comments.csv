,Toker_Wolf,2012-12-24T17:36Z,is this the russian version with the really bad audio? also russian captions
,QborT,2012-12-24T19:28Z,Labeling this as a BRRip without mentioning it is an RC source is weak.  Seriously misleading the amateurs that flock to your tiny rips.

,seanincali,2012-12-26T19:14Z,"when is the american version coming out? 

also why is your rip so bad on audio? i don't understand. it ruins the movie. virtually every single one has bad audio.  this one isn't an exception."
,vamss,2012-12-27T18:07Z,"YIFY am a biggest fan of you...

,sconlan,2012-12-27T21:35Z,First YIFY rip I have ever been unhappy with. YIFY was once associated with perfection in my mind.

,alan-bakr,2012-12-29T19:29Z,"I am also a huge fan of YIFY, but sometimes the audio is just not good enough. I donÂ´t know why, but if he finds away to improve this, he will be the king of kings. "

Tyvm for the work you do Yify. As others have said plz turn up the audio of your releases. "
,dtanfay,2013-01-03T22:59Z,Audio cuts out during the credits?? Same problem with Hit and Run and Dredd. Please retain the full audio in future rips. How many MB's does muting the audio for a couple of mins really save??
,taposh_xp,2013-01-04T12:17Z,"Dude Need Subtitle..Please
