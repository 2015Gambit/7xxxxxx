We found out Bloons is using it's own dir with Adobe AIR [Version 3.4] and it will not be affected by whatever version install of Adobe AIR.
For smoother experience & better performance, we recommend you to install Adobe AIR 3.6.
After that go to C:Program Files (x86)Common FilesAdobe AIRVersions1.0 [for 64 bit windows] and copy Adobe AIR.dll to the Adobe AIR folder included in TD5 and replace their old file."
