Summary:

There are stories where the girl gets her prince, and they live happily ever after. (This is not one of those stories.)

Jenna LordΓÇÖs first sixteen years were not exactly a fairytale. Her father is a controlling psycho and her mother is a drunk. She used to count on her older brotherΓÇöuntil he shipped off to Afghanistan. And then, of course, there was the time she almost died in a fire. 

There are stories where the monster gets the girl, and we all shed tears for his innocent victim. (This is not one of those stories either.)

Mitch Anderson is many things: A dedicated teacher and coach. A caring husband. A man with a certain... magnetism. 

And there are stories where itΓÇÖs hard to be sure whoΓÇÖs a prince and whoΓÇÖs a monster, who is a victim and who should live happily ever after. (These are the most interesting stories of all.)

Drowning Instinct is a novel of pain, deception, desperation, and love against the oddsΓÇöand the rules. - Goodreads Summary
