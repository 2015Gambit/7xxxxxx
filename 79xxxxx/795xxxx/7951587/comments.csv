,Mr.remo68,2012-12-26T22:06Z,â&#x20AC;Ś it works now but i had to download it twice
,Steezy5,2012-12-28T01:46Z,"@ip_man, sorry but i use 32bit OS's, so i wont be purchasing the 64bit version.

@alalguac, im doing the best i can. im seeding and will be for quite awhile. but the leechers out there are unbelievable.. 

@Mr.remo, must have just been a problem with your download getting corrupt. Try not to close torrent well downloading, sometimes you can get errors that way."
,rhizzu,2013-01-04T03:13Z,can i install this on windows or bootable install only?
,Steezy5,2013-01-06T02:04Z,"@rhizzu

I don't understand the question? this is a boot disk. you can install it as a stand alone OS or through a virtual machine. 

you cannot really install it ""on"" windows, as it is not a program. you can install a VM program to install this in if you would like though."
