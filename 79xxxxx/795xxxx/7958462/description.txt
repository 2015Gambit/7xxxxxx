Editorial Reviews
All Music Guide - Stephen Thomas Erlewine
American Originals unexpectedly revived Andy Griffith's musical career. 
Thanks to a series of television commercials, the album became a hit, even if 
it never charted -- then again, the album was never designed with the charts 
in mind; it was targeted at the legions of Griffith fans who grew up on The 
Andy Griffith Show and currently watched Matlock. As such, it contained a 
bunch of stories, poems, and songs -- some original, most classics -- all of 
which create a mythical small-town America, a theme that should be familiar 
to any fan of Griffith. There's humor, but it's not a comedy record -- it's a 
record filled with warmth and humanity, one that comes close to capturing 
the spirit of Griffith.
