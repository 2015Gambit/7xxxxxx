Psychic-medium Kim Russo and actress Gina Gershon journey to an apartment building in New York to investigate paranormal activity.

Release Note:
Where is episode 07 Michael Rapaport? I don't know. As far as I can tell, it never aired. TVguide, TVrage, wiki, whatever, can say it aired last week, but I can vouche episode 07 did NOT air on December 15th; a repeat of the Eric Mabius episode aired instead.
