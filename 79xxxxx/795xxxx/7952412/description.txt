-The.Simpsons.S24E08.ALTERNATE.CUT.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION
Aired 23.12.2012

So FuX aired this just last week, and tonight aired it 
again with a couple of changes. The original had no couch
or chalkboard gags sicne it had no opening, this does have
those, on the flip side, this does not have the final 
scene from the original. I would guess the retail will 
have the opening as well as the final scene, but who knows
with the fuckwits at FuX what they will do.  

"To Cur with Love - Version 2"

When a fire at the retirement home forces 
Grampa to move back in with the Simpsons, 
Homer throws out his back on moving day.
While resting at home, he gets hooked on 
the super-addictive tablet game, 
Villageville. And, in his distraction, he 
loses the family dog, Santas Little Helper. 
Everyone is angry with Homer for not seeming 
to care about the missing dog, but Grampa 
tells them the story of Homers long-lost 
childhood pup, Bongo.
