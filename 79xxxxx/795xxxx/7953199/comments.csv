14 Day Trial works fine though (before patching), although I can't get the media player to play DVD's despite having powerdvd installed as recommended by their FAQ.  Oh and T**D** *D support is nonexistent, asshats."

If you are using WinXP, I can't help you.

Be sure to choose the right Display for your monitor and GPU from the Control Panel.

What do you mean with ""failed to see a Direct3D game start and hook into it""? You sound as if this app drivers were implemented from an Windows backgound service like iZ3D. It isn't.
Are you starting the games through the application games' shortcuts and getting an ""This game did not use Direct3D 9, 10 or 11. It may not be compatible with ..."" error when you exit the game? Or are you doing something else and getting other errors.

When you start a game from an Ignition shortcut and the game runs, what do you read in the screen lower-left corner? And when you press ""0"", does the console show in the uper-right corner?

You are worng: the app support exists. And exists in two formats: 
1. a direct support through the costumer service tickets 
2. An user based support forum"
