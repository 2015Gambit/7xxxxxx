DISCLAIMER:

I'm aware of the claims that my files have virus,

trojans or whatever malware but, as I really care 

about my reputation and credibility of my work, I

had a virus scan made today 12/24/2013, to the .7z 

I uploaded.

The results were as follows:

As you can see, there are a few engines that report

the files as having some kind of malware. This is

absolutely normal when the hack tool dUP2 is used.

Therefore, FALSE-POSITIVES.

I think the subject is now crystal clear to everbody

Thanks.
