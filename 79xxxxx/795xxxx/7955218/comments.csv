,uheardmebitch,2012-12-28T07:46Z,"nice work, you haven't linked which movie this is, or even confirmed it once someone provided the link, you don't mention what LANGUAGE this is in, or the fact that there are no subs available anywhere for it. is it so hard to leave an imdb link? or INDICATE WHAT LANGUAGE the film is in?. 
for those that are wondering, do not download this unless u speak chinese. it's 1.4 gb u'll never get back or be able to use"
,uheardmebitch,2012-12-28T07:47Z,unfortunately the movie looks very good and the rip is great
