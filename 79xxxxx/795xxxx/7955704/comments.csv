This is not 720p.

Another great upload by one and only gayrukhfan."
,moshster,2012-12-25T10:17Z,"@girodice, yes, it IS 720P.  The movie was not shot in 16:9, it is a 21:9 movie, so it has black bars which takes up some of the 720 vertical pixels."

,topk,2012-12-26T01:25Z,"Why is he noob? This is indeed 1280x536 so how can it be ""720p""? It's much lower than 720p - it's 536p"
,MyFootHurts,2012-12-26T07:08Z,"Bad news topk, you're a noob as well."

,antares23,2012-12-29T05:30Z,"IT IS 720p but the movie is FILMED in 2:35:1 aspect ratio widescreen, so you'll see bars on top and bottom.

Technical Specs (FROM IMDB)

,Squa7ch2112,2012-12-29T18:11Z,This film was shot in an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (for every 1 unit high it's 2.35 units wide) which means it should be 1280 pixels wide by 536 pixels tall (with no black bars that is).  Do a little research before complaining about whether or not it's 720p lol.
