Storyline: Elijah Kane falls back onto his special forces past, re-emerging from the ashes of his destroyed SIU to once again work for the government. 

Aware of his skill as a long-range sniper, Kane is recruited by Marcus Mitchell of the CIA to come back as an operative. In return, Marcus promises that the CIA will provide information to Kane about who put out the hit on his SIU team. Kane is given a long-term 'off-the-grid' mission to take out a high level target that the CIA cannot go after in the 'traditional' way. Marcus feeds Kane intel that leads him into the target's 'circle' with a goal of getting Kane close enough to take a kill shot from a distance. Only then will the identity of the target be revealed to the team.
