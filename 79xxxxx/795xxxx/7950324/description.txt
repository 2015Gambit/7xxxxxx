Extermination is a 3rd person shooter/survival horror video game for PlayStation 2. It was used as a showcase for the PS2 system at trade shows before its release. The game was considered the first survival horror release on PlayStation 2.

PCSX2 v 1.0 with plugins & bios  included.
Extract with 7zip, or winrar, 2 gig output.

I use xpadder with this game to get better control of the charactor, the PS2 control layouts don't suit me since i'm used to more modern control setups in FPS games; so if you want, get a hold of, and use xppader to get better gameplay from any emulated PS2 game.

Please seed this game if you can for others to enjoy.
