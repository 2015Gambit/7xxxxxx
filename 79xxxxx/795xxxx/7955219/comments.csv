,vanman_88,2012-12-25T09:51Z,To the uploader: Remove this tonrent immediately because it is not cracked. This is no place for the millions of programs available on the net. Try to stick to crackade versions. If you can not crack it yourself. Leave it to send it out. This destroys only TPB entire building.
,sidelee72,2012-12-25T13:17Z,"no crack, no shit!"
,FSKing2,2012-12-25T19:08Z,"Idiot. We want the cracked version, not this shit! 
@All: Does anyone have an uncracked version of this bird? Need it, because the other few on tpb are not cracked properly (FSX crashes always ...)"
,skouras555,2012-12-25T22:52Z,"there are torrents also uncracked that others have upload and others that take them to crack it...remember that to be able to download it even uncracked you have to buy it or to be a member only if you buy it in vertical sims forum
thanks buddy for the upload

,aarque,2012-12-27T09:34Z,"ya skouras, how many versions is enough? This only shows active torrents, it doesn't count all the ones that have come and gone with zero seeders.

No one is going to crack it, no one wants to. Besides stepping on my torrent personally, ""anonymous"" and his crap has no more value here than if each and every one of us uploaded our very own version of what the VRS Superbug should be.

Oh and ya'll should try using the search function, you know, besides ""fsx."" You'd be amazed."
