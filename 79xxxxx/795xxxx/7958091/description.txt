I got sick of waiting around for someone to post a torrent with a collection of all Blalock's and criznittle's Indie Rock Playlist. So I spent the last few days collecting all of 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. I still have half of 2008 and I am looking for 2006, 2007, and half of 2008 if anyone could help me. Ill be posting the rest later on and then a very large file with all the years.
Unfortunately because Piratebay sucks, I had to zip a bunch of months together, otherwise it wouldn't upload my torrent because there were too many file-names/files.
This torrent includes the songs for every month in 2009. January 2009 is the last Criznittle post and the rest of 2009 is Blalock's.


2007,2008,2010,2011 and 2012 coming soon.
