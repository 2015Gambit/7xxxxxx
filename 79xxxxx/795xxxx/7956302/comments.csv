,zairon666,2012-12-28T00:02Z,"OK calm down. In different places the movie has different names even in dfferent countries. Some call it Dredd some call it Dredd 3D: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343727/releaseinfo#akas
But one thing is sure that this is 2D version so lets call it even. PS. I have seen the movie in cinema and it was good. Can`t wait the 3D version to watch on TV. Peace!"
