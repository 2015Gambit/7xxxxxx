Hello, SteelBubblez here - and this is my first torrent!

It contains every single episode of GTO.(1-43)  
I organized each one by hand, and the quality is as good as it comes for this series.

The files are .OGM, but can easily be converted to .AVI.  
Also, .OGM files can be burned straight to DVD if you're using the program "ConvertXtoDVD".

Also, they can be watched instantly with awesome quality if you're using MediaPlayerClassic, which in my opinion, is way better than VLC.  (Although VLC is good, MPC plays even MORE file-types with awesome quality - and that same portability).

Hope you enjoy the torrent, and PLEASE SEED, as I can (usually) only seed at night!!!  I don't know much about torrents, but I used the fastest trackers I could find so the download should be bearable.  Emphasis on 'should'.
