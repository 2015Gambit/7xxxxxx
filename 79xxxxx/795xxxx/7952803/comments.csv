Says 0 seeds, but I'm still seeding."
,SteelBubblez,2012-12-24T07:14Z,"*PS- They're all in English, but play in Japanese when I use VLC...  Strange, but when I use MediaPlayerClassic, it's all English.  Probably some wierdness with the fact they're .OGM's, but again, they can be converted and it's only with VLC.  Haven't tried burning them, (although you can), but I hope they stay in English when they're burned.  If anything, I'll take the time to convert all the files to AVI myself."

,SteelBubblez,2012-12-24T18:24Z,"Welcome!  I couldn't find a complete set of the GTO episodes that were organized, in English, and decent quality - so I made the torrent myself!  Glad you enjoy, and let me know in this comment section if there's anything I could do in the to speed up the download!  If enough people seed this, I'll re-upload it in AVI format.  But again, the OGM format is actually pretty good - as unknown as it is.  (Pretty sure it's the same as AVI, but with the ability to add dubs/external audio.  Which is why tons of anime torrents use it)."
