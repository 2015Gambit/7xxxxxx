Thnx for the upload.
Guys, when you install this, crack with 1.01 crack that comes with Skidrow release, and you'll be able to load your old savegame. Otherwise, the game can't load the saves.
So, just install this and use the first crack released."
,Performer81,2012-12-25T16:36Z,"game isnt patched coorectly when u do this, for example u havent the new options from patch 1.04."
,rappercake,2012-12-25T19:24Z,"Fucking thank you so much Atrax, just re-copying the 1.01 crack allowed me to be able to continue my game when nothing else worked.

Make sure your Orbit folder is still named 46 and you can play again."
,simolino,2012-12-26T00:23Z,Skidrowz seems pretty legit...so when is he going to earn the skull?
,simolino,2012-12-26T00:28Z,"If your in the middle of the game don't update until you're done playing the game. For example if you plan to play again, you can update it for your second play-through."
