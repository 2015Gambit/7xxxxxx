Any opinions on the audio book? Is it worth downloading? Thanks in advance, & thanks to the uploader. Holla."
,sariel777,2012-12-27T13:12Z,How about you seed the torrent so we can see?  I'm guessing the audio is not official audio book as it's not released by black library but hoping the epub/mobi are real.

,xahelus,2012-12-29T03:30Z,"It's actually not seeding at all, so that point should be self-evident."
