Is this because I need to buy expensive glasses (I haven't bought any yet, I'm just trying the ones you get when you watch a 3D movie) or is there a way to fix it?"

,AnitialD,2012-12-29T01:10Z,On my TV I have to go to options then 3D then  SBS(side by side). This merges the 2 images and then the 3D works

SPECIAL (2006) starring michael rapaport its the funniest thing ever, not to be confused with special dead a completely different movie. thanks yify you rule"
,POWERxHOUSE,2012-12-30T19:20Z,to fix your problem is easy.  Your most likely trying to watch it through itunes or something that is mirroring it from your computer.  DON'T mirror the movie or you will get an extra blur that wont work. Make sure you are watching it directly though a USB or Burnt disc.  that will help your problem !  good luck

Well, those are passive glassed and you'll need active one for your Panasonic - yeah, that's right, the expensive ones! :) You should know that all Panasonic Viera TVs from 2012 can be used with universal 3D glasses (that work with Bluetooth), that means you don't exactly need to buy the rather expensive Panasonic branded ones 'cause you have and option on the cheap: Samsung SSG-4100GB."
