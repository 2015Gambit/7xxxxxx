,Kingsanx,2012-12-25T06:33Z,wth is this? there is no pokemon black/white 2 for PC and there definitely are no executables. There are ROMs which end in .zip or .nds   
,juances,2012-12-25T21:21Z,Rom embedded with an emulator packed together in an exe installer?
,Kingsanx,2012-12-26T05:44Z,"I highly doubt it. Doesn't say it includes emulator and it doesn't show any kind of installation instructions. Also misleading file types will lead to the ""majority"" of people skipping and not downloading. At least put a reason why this is an .exe so downloaders will feel better. Tip "
