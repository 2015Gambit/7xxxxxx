                ++POKEMON BLACK & WHITE 2 FOR PC [HYPERDRIVE25]++
                +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Pokémon Black Version 2 (Pocket Monsters Black 2) and Pokémon White Version 2 (Pocket Monsters White 2) are the second paired versions of Generation V and are the sequels of Pokémon Black and White, respectively. 

 Gameplay changes
================
The new Unova Link is introduced, which makes way for new features.

Challenge Mode and Easy Mode are introduced, which raise and lower the strength of opposing Trainers respectively.

A new feature called the Memory Link is introduced, which reveals flashbacks from the NPCs that shed light on events that happened between Black and White and Black 2 and White 2. 

Many TMs and all but one HM are received in different locations.

The Xtransceiver adds two new mini-games called Balloon Catch, where the player needs to catch balloons of their face or an NPC's, and Balloon Smash, where the player needs to inflate the balloons as large as possible without bursting them.

The Move Tutors are back, and as with Pokémon Platinum, they teach most of the moves that were in that game for Shards, but here they all ask for shards of a specific color. They also teach many moves that lost their TM status, such as Dark Pulse, Roost and Stealth Rock. 

If the player has used a Repel, after its effect wears off, and if the player has more Repels in their bag, they will be asked if they would like to use another immediately without having to go into the menu.

A number of legendaries from Hoenn and Sinnoh (excluding the Weather trio and Creation trio) can be found in the post-game.

Zorua, Zoroark and TM95 (Snarl), which were previously accessible through Nintendo events only, can now be found within the game without any special requirements.

The Kami Trio are notably the only Unova regional Pokémon absent from either game and must be obtained through the Pokémon Dream Radar and then transferred or alternatively they can be traded from Black and White. 

The Dream Radar is also necessary to obtain their new forms.

Breeding was changed—the Everstone now always passes down nature (if both parents hold Everstone, one parent's nature is randomly picked). 
Furthermore, offspring have an 80% chance to have the Ability slot corresponding to their mother, unless it is a Hidden Ability; for example, Venomoth with Shield Dust is more likely to breed Venonat with Compoundeyes than with Tinted Lens.

All Pokémon Breeders can now be rebattled every time the player re-enters the area in which they are found.
