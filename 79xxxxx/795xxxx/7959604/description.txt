History Documentary hosted by David Suchet, published by BBC in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

David Suchet undertakes an epic journey spanning the Mediterranean. His inspiration is a charismatic individual whose own travels through this region, two thousand years ago, changed the world forever - Paul the Apostle.


1)  Early Life 
David visits Jerusalem to discover Paul's early life as a devout Jew and his subsequent, life-changing, conversion to the new Jesus Movement. David journeys to Tarsus in modern Turkey where Paul was born, and learns he was a citizen of two worlds. He travels to Antioch in Eastern Turkey, where Paul set about his mission of converting the Gentile world to the new religion of Christianity; and to Ephesus, where Paul challenged the gods of Empire. In so doing, he was challenging the might of Rome itself.

2)  Later Life 
David follows Paul's mission in Europe to convert the Gentile, Roman world to the new Christian faith. In Greece David visits the ancient city of Philippi, where Paul made his first convert in Europe, and then heads on to Thessalonika, Athens and Corinth. Local historians and archaeologists help David make sense of Paul's world and the impact he made. We learn of his successes and failures, and how letter-writing was an important social media of his time to keep the young churches together. David discovers that, contrary to popular belief, Paul valued the role of women in his work. The journey ends in Rome, where Paul met his death, and David uncovers some fascinating archaeological evidence to support the Paul story.
