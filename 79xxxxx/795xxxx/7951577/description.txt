Transcoded from "THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD 1955 60 143 EPS 4 SEASONS" founded on the net.

As a fact, in the founded torrents, there are some minus:
- in fact, they all have only 141 eps ,
- they are out of order
- the files are HUGE mpeg2 shots from vhs tapes(My guess), very noisy, artefacted,
out of sync sound, blips...you name it

Well, after about 3 mounths of trials, I've got this:
- renamed the files according with wikipedia
- completed the series with the missing 3x01 and 3x02 eps form a poor flv french source
- properly cropped and trimmed the comercials

The final result is 10 times smaller and in my opinion, not much quality was lost.
The files are encoded with x264, mp3 (HandBrake 0.98) at constant quality.
The very big difference in filesize is only dictated by the
noise or the flatness of the original material

I really liked the series and wish to keep it,
but the original size make this impossible.

This is my gift for the community.

P.S.
If you have the sources of better quality material,
I can reforge my PC for 2-3 weeks to retranscode.

Only if you have all the 143eps and at better quality,
