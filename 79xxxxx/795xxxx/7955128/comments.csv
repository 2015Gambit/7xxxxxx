,Vendommoir2,2012-12-25T05:03Z,@Ajaxen94 You are uploading Merlin @ 2kps / second !! Everyone is stuck @ about 55% due to that very reason. Could you pause the Mrs. Browns for an hour so a few people could finish Merlin up? Or don't post until either one is uploaded. This has been like this for over 4 hours now. Not nice.
