Wouldnt matter anyways... the online modes are dead.  Complete ghost towns.  "
,whateverthefuck,2012-12-30T15:10Z,"All the included DLC is multiplayer only, and the game isn't cracked for LAN/online multiplayer. 

But nonetheless, it's a small install package, and while slow, the installation process is very simple. 

Besides considering THQ (the publisher) just went bankrupt a couple of weeks ago and all their assets, including ""Relic Entertainment"" await the highest bidder, this would essentially be the final version of the game, ever. 

So, if you have the game already, and it works properly, there is no point in downloading this, otherwise it's a fine download of a very fine game."
