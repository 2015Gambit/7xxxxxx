GRACE the Forbidden Gospel by Andre van der Merwe (pdf)

If youΓÇÖve never been exposed to hearing the gospel preached by Paul the Apostle in its pure, undiluted form, this book might offend and possibly even anger you. The Gospel of Grace has been outlawed and frowned upon by most organized religious institutions. Take courage though, there is a generation of believers rising up in the earth whose eyes are opening to the truth of the gospel of grace ΓÇô a wave of people that has grown fed up with the way that church is done: Either good news is preached with some guilt and manipulation mixed in, or church services take the form of well orchestrated shows. Many believersΓÇÖ entire lives are reduced to nothing more than a sin management program, running the endless treadmill of trying to please God by doing more for Him or trying to sin less.

If you have been raised with religion, then understanding the gospel of grace may involve unlearning most of what you have learnt through the years. It may initially feel as though the carpet is being plucked from under your feet, but as the perfume of GodΓÇÖs love rises and the truth of the Word begins to set you free, you will find yourself unable to resist the FatherΓÇÖs romantic advances, drawing you into Himself for a deeper experience of who He is.
