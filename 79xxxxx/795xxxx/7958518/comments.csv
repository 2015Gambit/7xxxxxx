[H],Wanderer,2012-12-26T09:52Z,"Sorry mate i ain't taking any requests but i try to upload any suggestions from you if i find it and it's not already in the pirate bay.
As for your game there's no other copy out except the HI2U.This is supposed to be multi language but some people are having problems with the subtitles."
,motley666,2012-12-26T15:06Z,"Wanderer, age of wonders games are already in the piratebay and still you uploaded them."
[H],Wanderer,2012-12-26T20:37Z,This is a different version than the ones uploaded. more user friendly.
,motley666,2012-12-27T02:51Z,"You're right indeed, but i hope people will buy the games to support the developers, they deserve it, they made timeless games."
