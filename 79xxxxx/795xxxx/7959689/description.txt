The choice of composers and works represented in ΓÇÿBack to the FutureΓÇÖ is entirely mine. And it is a very subjective choice. Each piece is distinctive, and I found extraordinary contrasts between them: for example, only seven years separate WebernΓÇÖs Four Pieces for Violin and Piano, Op. 7 of 1910 and the RespighiΓÇÖs Sonata for Violin and Piano of 1917, yet they could scarcely be more contradictory. In the Webern you have this sparse explosive array of sounds while Respighi sets you dreaming of Brahms and Italy. This immense variety recurs throughout the repertory. Is there a common thread?
Yes: I have chosen pieces that exhibit color and expressivity - none of these pieces was composed as an experiment or as a purely intellectual statement. All of this chosen music is deeply rooted in the past without trying to copy the past. All of it expresses the coloristic quality, the emotional quality of the instrument, the sculpting quality of the sound production that the voice and the violin have in common.
