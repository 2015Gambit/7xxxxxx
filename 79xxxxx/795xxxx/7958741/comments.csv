,wpjbs,2012-12-26T13:27Z,thanks for all these. Much appreciated.  Do you have any more of the Carol Burnett Show?  Loved that show
[V],TheExecutive,2012-12-26T19:14Z,"No more Carol Burnett Shows unfortunately.
There are too many of them that Carol doesn't own the rights to and those are from the first 5 years...which is about half the run.  Also a lot from the other seasons she does own that have yet to be released.  Too many issues with musicians' union rights."
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-12-27T13:53Z,This appears not to be correctly seeding as it has been running for 24 hours and yet to connect to anyone with more than 0.0%. Glad to see your re-posting today. Thanks for this series as someone posted a bunch of these a while back and the files were crap.
[V],TheExecutive,2012-12-28T02:41Z,"I didn't re-upload it and it seeds just fine -- you have to wait a few minutes till it starts.  I'm no longer one of the seeder of course.

The other show with Paul Revere & the Raider is their second appearance. This is the first."
