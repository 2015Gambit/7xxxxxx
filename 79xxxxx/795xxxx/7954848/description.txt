Synopsis

LINUX OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION introduces readers to Linux operations and system administration through a unified installation, using virtual machines. This text is more effective than those that take a professional approach because it eliminates confusion from working with differing hardware configurations, while allowing users to test interoperability between Linux and Windows. Detailed, yet reader-friendly, Linux Operations and Administration makes it easy to learn Linux and practice it with helpful in-text features like learning objectives and key terms, as well as items for self assessment such as review questions, hands-on activities, and case projects.
