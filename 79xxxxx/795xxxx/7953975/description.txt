This session headed by trumpeter Lee Morgan was not initially released until this 1998 CD. 

Morgan is joined by an all-star cast of James Spaulding on flute and alto, tenor saxophonist 

Wayne Shorter, baritonist Pepper Adams, pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter and 

drummer Mickey Roker, but the music overall is not all that memorable. Most of the 

selections, although allegedly ΓÇ£standards,ΓÇ¥ were of more recent vintage (like ΓÇ£A Lot of 

LivinΓÇÖ to DoΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£If I Were a CarpenterΓÇ¥), and even if Morgan and the other musicians play 

well, nothing too exciting occurs. Although not a dud, it was not a major loss that this 

recording stayed in the vaults.
