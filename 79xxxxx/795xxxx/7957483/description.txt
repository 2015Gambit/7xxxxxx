Book Description
After a dozen years of incremental changes, C# has become one of the most versatile programming languages available. With this comprehensive guide, youΓÇÖll learn just how powerful the combination of C# 5.0 and .NET 4.5 can be. Author Ian Griffiths guides you through C# 5.0 fundamentals and teaches you techniques for building web and desktop applications, including Windows 8-style apps.

Completely rewritten for experienced programmers, this book provides many code examples to help you work with the nuts and bolts of C# code, such as generics, dynamic typing, and the new asynchronous programming features. YouΓÇÖll also get up to speed on XAML, ASP.NET, LINQ, and other .NET tools.
