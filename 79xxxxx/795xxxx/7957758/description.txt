User Review

Except for one character (Alley Cat, the jumping Indian) and a few bits of dialogue, this film was excellent. Unlike some of the Spaghetti Westerns, it kept true to the tongue-in-cheek nature of the genre while still presenting a gritty, violent story. I particularly like the portrayal of Banjo's relationship with Jane, which accurately compares and contrasts the mercenary sides of men and women.

Lee Van Cleef was, as always, always, always, excellent. Magnificent. How could Hollywood have ever neglected such a wonderful actor? Even when merely walking around a room, he commanded complete attention and gives insight into the character. William Berger couldn't have been better as Banjo. Indeed, he played the 'I'll take any side as long as I can get lots of money out of it' type of character much better than Clint Eastwood did.

The dialogue goes on a bit in a few places but other than that, works very well. The music is not exceptional, but the main theme is catchy and for all its 'pop music' somehow fits the film.
