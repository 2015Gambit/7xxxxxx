This Christmas, there's no need to panic if the idea of cooking for the whole family fills you with dread. Help is at hand as Gordon Ramsay serves up an action-packed, entertaining guide to cooking a foolproof Christmas dinner - on Christmas Day.

Gordon invites the nation's families to cookalong together. Don't leave it all to mum - Gordon challenges everyone to muck in and help create the perfect three-course festive feast: turkey with pork, porcini and sage stuffing; Madeira gravy; clementine carrots with freshly grated nutmeg; Brussels sprouts with chilli, lemon, garlic and toasted hazelnuts; and the perfect goose fat roast potatoes with garlic and rosemary.

Plus, Gordon serves up a delicious starter of parsnip and pea soup with a walnut pesto, and a show-stopping ice cream snowball for pudding.
