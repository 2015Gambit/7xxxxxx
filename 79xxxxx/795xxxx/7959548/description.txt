George Clarks Amazing Spaces: Christmas
George returns for a Christmas special, visiting Christmas-themed builds including a gingerbread house, an underground grotto decorated with over four and a half million shells, and a beach hut advent calendar where every day a festive space opens its doors to the public. George also catches up with expert designer William, to look back on the extraordinary journey to transform his 1970s caravan into a spectacular 21st century holiday retreat. George meets up the couple who invested their life savings in the hope of converting a wreck of a bus into a holiday let; the teacher in his forester's woodland hut in the Lake District; the architect who transformed a disused underground toilet into an incredible apartment; and the man who now has a shipping container for an office in his back garden.
