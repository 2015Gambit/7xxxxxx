I ripped these audio files using TextAloud. The voice is Audrey16 (UK
English) at 128,000 Kbps-25,050 KHZ Mono. If anyone has a better
method, please post it. I also included the text files I used. Please
feel free to make your own versions and post them.

These books are for people like me who, for one reason or another,
have a hard time reading for extended periods. Not, to rip David off.

If you don't like computer generated speech, these books are not for
you.
