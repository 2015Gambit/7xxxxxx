 Animated sequel to Raymond Briggs' classic festive tale The Snowman, telling the 
 story of another youngster's magical Christmas. A boy's snowman and snowdog come to 
 life at the stroke of midnight and take him on an adventure to the North Pole, where 
 he and his new companions meet an assortment of colourful characters, including 
 Santa himself, before returning home - where a wonderful surprise awaits.
                          

 The.Snowman.And.The.SnowDog.2012.720p.HDTV.x264-RAWNiTRO bitrate is way to 
 high due to bad compression in this case video bitrate is 6847 Kbps at crf 18.
 even the raw itself is very close to it i've add a few details to show the diffrents

 the rules say "As a general suggestion, average video bitrate in excess of 5000kb/s 
 is a sign that a higher CRF value should be chosen, when possible"

 using a higher crf was possible, i used crf 21 to keep it below 5000 kbps for 
 the video and 1.22 gb is just silly :(
