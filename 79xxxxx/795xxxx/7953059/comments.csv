seems no one did xvid for it not even afg

 but if you grab this you can make a xvid without too much effort using 
Umile Encoder 3.12 get this version less buggy when doing mp4s 

just make a interleave profile AVI and set it to bitrate 1008 and custom size of 640x360
and mp3 128 cbr tick correct sync
and leave others on default

your good to go.. will make a xvid in 5min on i7 lappy dont align on interleaves though but shouldnt be a issue from what I found.. on most gear as long as use cbr for video and sound"
,axprodigy1,2012-12-26T02:29Z,Fantastic mate thanks. Merry xmas to you and yours.
