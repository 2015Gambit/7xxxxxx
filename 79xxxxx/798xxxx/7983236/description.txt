Now in its fifth edition, JAVASCRIPT guides beginning programmers through Web application development using the JavaScript programming language. As with previous editions of this book, Don Gosselin introduces key Web authoring techniques with a strong focus on industry application. A real-world project, similar to what students would encounter in a professional setting, is developed throughout each chapter. Since professional Web development jobs often require programmers to add features to an existing site, each chapter project uses a professionally designed Web site. After completing the course, students will be able to use JavaScript to build professional quality, dynamic Web sites.
