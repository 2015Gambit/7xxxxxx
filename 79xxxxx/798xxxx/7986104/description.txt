This all-purpose star atlas is the first of its kind devoted to observing the Herschel objects with binoculars and telescopes. It displays over 2500 of the most visually attractive star clusters, nebulae and galaxies that were discovered by Sir William, Caroline and Sir John Herschel. Covering the entire sky from the North to the South Celestial Pole, and showing all 88 constellations, it is also a general sky atlas showing variable, double and multiple stars, and the Milky Way. Written by experienced observer James Mullaney and illustrated by renowned celestial cartographer Wil Tirion, this is a magnificent 'celestial roadmap' to some of the finest deep-sky showpieces. Spiral bound and printed in red-light friendly colors for use at a telescope, with color-coded symbols for easy recognition and identification, this is a must-have observing reference for all amateur observers.
