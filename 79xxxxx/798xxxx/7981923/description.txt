Story of a tramp who suddenly makes it big in high society - I could give a better description if I spoke Polish. It somehow reminds me of Diary of a Madman.

"Being There" is said to be inspired by this story, in fact Jerzy Kosinski was accused of outright plagiarism - compare for yourself. I see similar themes, but very different stories about different sorts of people.

I got this off youtube, thus it is in flv format - it will play on VLC. Youtube sometimes takes things down, so I will post it here.

Anyone got English subs?
