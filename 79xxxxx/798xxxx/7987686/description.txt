Star Trek: The True Story
The True Story looks at the real lives and true stories behind Hollywood blockbusters and this episode examines the Sci-Fi phenomenon and most successful franchise in history - Star Trek. Since the original motion picture premier in 1979 Star Trek has boldly gone onto produce multiple TV series, 11 further films and can boast the most loyal and passionate fanbase in the world. The origins of this multi-billion dollar business can be traced back to one man - LA cop, Gene Roddenberry. As the world of television blossomed in the 1950's, Roddenberry began to write scripts for police dramas in his spare time. Until one day he came up with a ground-breaking new idea - Star Trek. The original motion picture is set in the twenty-third century when a powerful alien machine called Vger approaches Earth destroying everything in its path. The last possible chance to save the planet is Admiral James T Kirk at the helm of the USS Enterprise. Using impressive special effects it was what legions of Trekkies/Treckers were waiting for.
