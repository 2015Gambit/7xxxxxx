Joe Walsh

Walsh took time during the show to tell of getting his first guitar, a $40 Sears & Roebuck Silvertone model after originally playing trombone and clarinet growing up. ΓÇ£I stumbled across the guitar, because I needed something I could play that wasnΓÇÖt in my mouth, and that I could write music on,ΓÇ¥ he laughs. ΓÇ£I was never going to get any girls playing clarinet. Not that I got any playing guitar, but it was a lot more fun.ΓÇ¥

Taking a cue from the title of his latest album, Analog Man, Walsh criticizes the ΓÇ£digital recipeΓÇ¥ of most pop music today, explaining, ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs all about the magic of a human performance.ΓÇ¥

And thereΓÇÖs no better example of that than the interaction between Walsh and his host on the latest edition of Live from DarylΓÇÖs House, which turns HallΓÇÖs living room into a garage, with a slam-bang version of ΓÇ£Wrecking BallΓÇ¥ ending in what Daryl dubs, ΓÇ£a Neil Young moment.ΓÇ¥ There were more than several of those over the course of the episode.
