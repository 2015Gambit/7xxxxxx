,shih9019,2013-01-03T15:14Z,DOESNT ANYONE CHECK THE TORRENTS? IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HANSEL AND GRETEL - ACTUALLY QUITE A BAD VERSION. JUST THE PICS SHOW THE ACTORS ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE POSTER.

If you did you'd see that the uploader never claims it's the upcoming Jeremy Renner movie

There's even a trailer included for chrissakes, no mention of this being any other movie than the one it actually is!
