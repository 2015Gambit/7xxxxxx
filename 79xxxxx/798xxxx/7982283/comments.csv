,PeterVH,2013-01-04T13:33Z,"Hey harbackgrad, I'm currently seeding the first part but not seeing any activity right now. I hope I'm doing it right since I'm new to uploading torrents =/ If you can't get it on here though, I do have the first part posted on SmashWords and I'll be putting up the second part soon. 

This is all probably in violation of the fact I'm also selling them for 99 cents on Amazon, but sales haven't been going too well and at this point I care more about getting my work out there and having people read it than I do about money. If you'd like to support me on that front, it would be greatly appreciated =)

But I'll always have these stories circulating for free somewhere or other. Again, if you can't get the first part on here, it is on SmashWords for free and I should have part 2 on there sometime in the next couple weeks =)     "
,PeterVH,2013-01-04T13:35Z,"Also on SmashWords, it's available in all formats =)"
