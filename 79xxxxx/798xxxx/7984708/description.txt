This Upload of The Avengers 3D is basically a copy of Harshad's 3D Anaglyph copy.  That file is Dual-Audio (English and Hindi).  I Downloaded that copy and then used WinX HD Converter Deluxe to remove the Hindi Audio portion.  This created an English exclusive XVID copy.  Then I used Nero Vision to create the VIDEO_TS files in this Torrent.

To burn a DVD, that will play in most DVD Players, just Download this file and Burn with any DVD Burner.  I use Nero Burning Rom.

The Audio is AC3 on this Print.
