Classic Steam Train Collection 
This DVD collection tells the story of many great trains including the King Edward 1st, Green Arrow, Taw Valley, Flying Scotsman, Clan Line, Black Five and Castle & Manor, beautifully capturing the sights and sounds of a bygone era. The 'Flying Scotsman' is the ultimate pictorial records of how the world's most famous express locomotive steamed triumphantly into the Millennium. Then join the drivers and fireman aboard the Great Western engines for live footplate action sequences as you've never seen before, as a team of Great Western engine-men from the days of steam are reunited with their engines.




4)  Flying Scotsman 
The ultimate pictorial record of how the world's most famous express locomotive steamed triumphantly into the Millennium, reborn with far greater power than Sir Nigel Gresley had ever envisaged. It is a story of financial nightmares and engineering excellence and it's told with the help of three men, her owner, the chief engineer, and the traction inspector who was on the footplate at key moments. In BR days the engine, then numbered 60103, produced just under 33,000 pounds of tractive effort. But higher boiler pressure, bigger cylinders and improved steam passages all contributed to the Flying Scotsman improving that to 40,000 pounds. A professional TV documentary crew intensively filmed the engine in action during her first year back on the mainline. The result is a unique film, 'A Day in the Life' and 'A Year in the Life' - the star is "Flying Scotsman".
