"Push Comes to Shove"

When Reba learns that June's school has 
dropped its music program, she tries to rally 
the music committee moms to revive it. Cash 
gets a reputation as a bully after he stands 
up to the most popular boy in school, and 
enjoys the popularity that his new "bad boy" 
persona brings. But when Reba goes toe to toe 
with the school principal, she gains the same 
reputation. Meanwhile Lillie takes part in a 
protest to keep her local pot dispensary up 
and running.

Evolve... or die.
