,endoii,2013-01-04T08:49Z,could you blease do a 700mb version for better quality???

Have you clicked the screenshots.. they clearly show the quality...

and I don't understand how you can say inferior for 1080p and then request I make a 700mb version... which would be REALLY terrible looking.

could you clarify?"
