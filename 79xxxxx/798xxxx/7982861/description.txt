Classic Steam Train Collection 
This DVD collection tells the story of many great trains including the King Edward 1st, Green Arrow, Taw Valley, Flying Scotsman, Clan Line, Black Five and Castle & Manor, beautifully capturing the sights and sounds of a bygone era. The 'Flying Scotsman' is the ultimate pictorial records of how the world's most famous express locomotive steamed triumphantly into the Millennium. Then join the drivers and fireman aboard the Great Western engines for live footplate action sequences as you've never seen before, as a team of Great Western engine-men from the days of steam are reunited with their engines.


1)  King Edward I 
This is the most comprehensive coverage of a steam rail trip ever made, as cameras at more than 50 locations followed the beautifully restored 6024 "King Edward I" from London to Bristol and back to Didcot. Wearing "The Bristolian" headboard, the King's progress was followed by cameras at the lineside, on the footplate as well as from the air to capture the sights and sounds of a bygone era. The load behind the 460 class locomotive was over 500 tons and the schedule called for some sharp timings to keep out of the way of high speed trains. The programme includes dramatic footplate commentary on the climb through Box Tunnel to help you enjoy in more detail than ever previously possible, exactly what it was like to ride with the King for a day.
