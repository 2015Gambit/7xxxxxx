,notnowplz,2013-01-04T15:24Z,goes in and out of focus...horrible!!!!!...but its a CAM....I think I'll wait....it's honestly pretty bad!!!!!!!!!!V-3......A-4 at the very most!!!!!!!
,gigarest,2013-01-04T17:49Z,"I was eager to check this movie, this cam does the job. There are distracting blurry moments in the first 45 minutes, then it gets better for a while overall, but there are blurry patches throughout, never enough to not understand what is going on on screen. Handheld cam, you never see the left edge of the screen, but you often see the ceiling of the cinema.
A: 4.0 clear dialogues throughout, loud movie with sound effects fron in the mix
V: 3.5 Movie starts from the company logos, blurry and distorted, but action on screen is always fairly clear
M: 3.0 very boring parts in the middle, some cool isolated sequences in the first 45 minutes and the last half-hour"
,michaelrwatson,2013-01-05T01:35Z,"Perhaps the ""boring parts in the middle"" are boring because it's blurry and you're seeing the ceiling of the theatre...."
