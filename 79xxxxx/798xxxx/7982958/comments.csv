Wrong.  Germany is showing it out of order, just like FOX did with ""Firefly""."
,lcasarin,2013-01-04T03:39Z,"vmx order is the correct one according to wiki

i m missing episodes 10 and 12 according to vmx order... anyone has them?"
,vbmx,2013-01-04T04:00Z,"@ml1976,

I followed the order from Wikipedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transporter:_The_Series

@lcasarin ,

I downloaded THIS TORRENT and the one below
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7980036/Transporter.The.Series.S01E11.BRRiP.XViD-PSiG

That should cover the 11/12 episodes."
