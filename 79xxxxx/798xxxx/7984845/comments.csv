There's only couple stations left with real shitty audio. I don't care what anyone says. Radio is ""More Important"" than TV and Internet, yes Internet. ""Everyone"" has free access to radio and they know it."

[T],480v,2013-01-04T02:29Z,Seriously I don't know if I can get Randi anymore. Unless there's a station that broadcasts her show after 4pm pacific. It doesn't look good. Damnit!!! I'll keep searching. If anyone finds one please let me know through comments one of my latest uploads.
