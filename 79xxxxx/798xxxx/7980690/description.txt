Jimmy Carr puts another panel of celebrities to the test as they battle it out 
to see who remembers most about 2012. What did Prince Harry get up to in Vegas? 
Why were we all talking about pasties and sausage rolls? And how did Usain Bolt 
celebrate his amazing 200m win at the Olympics? If you know the answer to all, 
some or even none of the above, then join us as a host of big names, including 
Jonathan Ross, Russell Howard, Jack Whitehall and James Corden, vie for the 
coveted Big Fat Quiz crown. As usual, Jimmy will be calling on some seriously 
A-list question-setters, with Seth Rogen, Jack Black, Ricky Gervais, Will Ferrell, 
Quentin Tarantino and Sacha Baron Cohen all turning up to lend a helping hand in 
previous years. Play along at home or just sit back and let the celebs do all the 
hard work, but don't miss The Big Fat Quiz of the Year.
