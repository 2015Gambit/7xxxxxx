These small group sides were recorded shortly before Ben Webster and Jimmy Blanton

came aboard to form what the experts consider Ellington's best band...The Blanton/

Webster band or as it was known for awhile - Duke Ellington and his "Famous 

Orchestra."


Ellington (EKE) plays piano throughout but the credited leaders are:



Johnny Hodges and his Orchestra;      tracks 1-4 Disc 1     trk 1-6 Disc 2



Cootie Williams and his Rug Cutters;      tracks 5-22 Disc 1    trk 7-18  Disc 2



Rex Stewart and his 52nd street Stompers;  trks 19-21  Disc 2



Some of the material is pretty marginal but like Billie Holiday, these guys

could work magic with it.  Ellington fans will love it.....others...maybe not
