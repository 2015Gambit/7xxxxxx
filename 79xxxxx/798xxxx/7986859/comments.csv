Thanks EZ for another good one!"
,freddy213809,2013-01-07T05:29Z,"@sonicsurf_71 According to IMDB it's a fictional/written film, so nope, not real or even based on real events."
,gazraill,2013-01-08T02:16Z,"Not the best video quality for its size, a bit grainy in the dark scenes.  Not a camera version.  A really good movie ... I will consider it haha."
,yob09,2013-01-08T07:16Z,"hi EZ, how dis differ from seal team six: the raid on osama bin laden shown in natgeotv.com?, & file was too big i'll wait for a smaller size copy anyway, tnx 4 d upload"
,some.bozo,2013-01-11T08:19Z,"Excellent!  A9, V9. A DVD rip, not a screener, taken from an Academy Award member's DVD (that's why it says ""For Your Consideration"" occassionally)."
