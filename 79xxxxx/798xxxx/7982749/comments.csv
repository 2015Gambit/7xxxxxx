thanks!
could you try to get galaxy on fire 2 with the two extra packs?"
,gatosardina,2013-01-05T14:16Z,"i must recomment
the game works fine, but the controls are ""slow""
What i mean is that if i press the ""fire"" button, it will take 20 seconds for the game to process that i pressed the ""fire"" button
any ideas?"
