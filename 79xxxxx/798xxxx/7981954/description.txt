PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS FOR ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS, Fourth Edition, continues the approach that has made previous editions successful. As a teacher and researcher at a premier engineering school, author Tony Hayter is in touch with engineers daily--and understands their vocabulary. The result of this familiarity with the professional community is a clear and readable writing style that readers understand and appreciate, as well as high-interest, relevant examples and data sets that hold readers' attention. A flexible approach to the use of computer tools includes tips for using various software packages as well as computer output (using MINITAB and other programs) that offers practice in interpreting output. Extensive use of examples and data sets illustrates the importance of statistical data collection and analysis for students in a variety of engineering areas as well as for students in physics, chemistry, computing, biology, management, and mathematics.
