you all are reading comments of another site and put it here on The Pirate Bay,why?

episode is diferent than the other 10 i uploaded today,ewerithing is ok"
,beechyboy,2013-01-03T01:43Z,"Just read on a German newssite the 12 episodes had to be reduced to 10 because Chris Vance got injured during a stunt. So maybe episode 11 (â&#x20AC;&#x2122;12 Hoursâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;), which is a bonus episode on bluray, IS the last one.

Google translated quote:
The production was plagued by various problems. So for example, actor Chris Vance was injured during a stunt, which has led to a long hiatus. The first season is therefore not, as initially planned, twelve, but only ten episodes."
,cindy25,2013-01-03T03:35Z,there is a lot of confusion with different groups using various numbering order but I can confirm this is a duplicate (for me) of either 105 or 106 of the French numbering system
[V],wilimaw,2013-01-03T04:09Z,"this one is in german order,maybe it needs a little tweak :)"
[V],wilimaw,2013-01-03T04:13Z,"in my upload are no duplicates,i wached them all"

,snflwr,2013-01-04T18:39Z,"Thnx for the ups on this wilimaw but, despite your protests, this E11 IS just a copy of E06"
[V],wilimaw,2013-01-04T23:24Z,"@hizman,@snflwr

i don't know how to explain it for you so that you understand me,in my to torrents are 11 diferent episodes(episode 12 was canceled from season 1,for those who keep asking and searching for it).If you keep mixing episodes from my torrents whit episodes from other downloads from somewhere else,this is what hapens and stupid comments appear.
Just deleate al epiodes what you hawe and make a fresh download,only of this 2 torrents and ewerything will be fine
This is my last comment on this 2 torrents,if you dont like it dont download it anymore

good luck"
