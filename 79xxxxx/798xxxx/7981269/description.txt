Gary Lineker presents highlights of the night's three Premier League games, with analysis from Alan Hansen and Michael Owen.

Chelsea go into their derby game with west London neighbours Queens Park Rangers at Stamford Bridge boasting a 12-match unbeaten home record against the Rs. Fernando Torres scored a hat-trick in Chelsea's 6-1 triumph in April 2012.

Liverpool entertain Sunderland, who have provided dogged resistance at Anfield during the Premier League era, drawing six of 11 total matches, including each of their last two visits.

Everton travel to St James' Park in the day's other game to take on Newcastle. The Toffees had recorded just one win on their last 10 trips to Tyneside.

There is also another chance to see all of the goals from Tuesday's games.
