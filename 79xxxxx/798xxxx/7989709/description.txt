Hello again everyone, I found this album by SuperCell online and I though that I would upload for the rest of you to enjoy.

The whole album was all in one big .Wav file when I got it so I used sound booth to cut it up into the 12 respective songs that are on the album, don't worry everything sounds just perfect.

The songs are all 32, 44100 sample rate stereo uncompressed Wav files. I have all renamed the tracks to their english names (as best as I could fine, some may be incorrect but their is little I can to about that as I don't speak Japanese or know anyone that does) I also included a list (in order) of the song names to help you organize them in the way they were originally on the album and I have included the album cover.

If there are any problems with it please tell me in the comments below.

There is a tad more info at this website here (sadly the names of the songs on this site are in Japanese but there is little I can do about that) -- http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Supercell_tribute_~Stowaways~


Have a great time listening and don't forget to never stop sharing with the world!!!!
