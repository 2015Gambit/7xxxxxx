There’s something oddly fascinating about twins. Maybe it’s the secret languages they create, their identical façade, or the claim that one can feel when the other is hurt. But when one twin turns bad, does the other stay pure of heart? Channeling sibling rivalries and deadly childhood pacts, EVIL TWINS follows true-crime mysteries surrounding real-life cases of these evil archetypes. Each episode reveals shocking stories of twins on the edge, from sleeping with their sibling’s husband then setting them up for murder to stealing their identity and even coming back from the dead.
