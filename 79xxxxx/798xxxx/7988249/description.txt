From the play by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. who also wrote the screenplay.

A big game hunter returns, after being lost in the Amazon jungle for eight 
years, to find his wife has become an educated, independent woman and his 
ideals of manhood have become outmoded. 

Kurt Vonnegut later gave himself a 'D' grade for his own writing and found
the experience of making this movie very disappointing, but the stellar 
cast get the most out of it and there are many very funny and memorable 
scenes (e.g. playing shuffleboard in Heaven) and characters (e.g. Hickey's 
Looseleaf Harper) in this adaptation.

This recording (probably from an old video tape) is very low quality, but considering how difficult it is to find, this will have to do for now. 

Does anyone have a better copy? Please post it.
