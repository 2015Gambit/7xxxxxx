,Benishdamenish,2013-01-05T05:49Z,"This movie is based on pure horse shit. No intelligent and informed person would ever believe this nonsense. Osama Bin Laden died many years ago and had nothing to do with the FBI/CIA's bombing, using planes, of the world trade centre.. "

Great quality upload. Haven't watched it yet, but Hurt Locker was FANTASTIC so I hope this will be as good or better.
THANKS once again, scene4all!!"
,armand72,2013-01-05T08:19Z,you done it again mate. first to upload this title. thanks mate
,Kra3zd,2013-01-05T13:41Z,"Support this movie if you support ignorance. 

No offence to you scene4all, I love wht you do, but I just have to comment on something that has about 2% of truth to it. Once again, this movie is bullshit."
,micwood49,2013-01-05T14:00Z,Awesome Movie!
,lanterngr,2013-01-05T16:32Z,"LMAO at the USA hating morons, get back to us when you leave your parents basement..."
,TPBGurl,2013-01-05T20:14Z,"So I guess that was Lil Wayne"" we captured and killed in Afganistan... ooops! @Benishdamenish"
,magicman0900,2013-01-07T04:27Z,"i like how Kra3zd complains about this story only being 2% real, as if he was apart of seal team 6... any person with common sense already knows this movie is anything but the truth...."
,hatepig,2013-01-07T09:39Z,"Only fucking retards think criticism of a government means you hate a country of millions of people. Keep sucking that propaganda dick you piece of shit. For one, the FBI themselves say there was 0 evidence bin Laden was linked to 9/11. Even if he was, only someone who really does hate the idea of the USA would cheer for assassination rather than trial."
,scottsasse,2013-01-07T16:59Z,"Wow we are only 10 comments in and already have 3 angry prepubescent little boys who weren't even born on 9/11 acting like they know it all!! Get a life Benishdamenish (your name says it all!!), Kra3zd (your name speaks the truth about you too!!), hatepig (really, do I even need to mention the ignorance expressed in your name??) Don't worry children, you will get a pubic hair soon enough. But you will all probably be angry little virgins for life because girls don't like immature, tiny-dicked towelheads who troll the internet and chronically masturbate to pictures of pigs genitals!! ..................and many THANKS scene4all:)"
,alan-bakr,2013-01-08T19:46Z,"a good rip, except at the end, at the most exciting part, when the raid on the compound begins. Then the image freaks out. therefore overall, A=8, V=6.5"
,alan-bakr,2013-01-08T19:53Z,The movie is completely bad at the end. 
,jalucian,2013-01-09T03:05Z,"I like how the notes for this torrent say ""Long movie but kept the file size way down."" 1.5gigs is supposed to be a reasonable file size? That's laughable. This could have been done in 720p resolution (if the source was good enough) for under 850megs or so, and this isn't anywhere near that resolution. This is over twice as big as it needs to be. Take a look at the quality and size of encodes by YIFY in 720 if you doubt what I'm saying."
,alan-bakr,2013-01-09T10:50Z,Google is nowadays filtering out subtitle searches because of copyright. Some technical genious may find a solution to this problem eventually. May be we can torrent subtitles as well :)
,DWLR,2013-01-09T17:21Z,"kudos scene4all 
the Ending video quality is in the toilet for sure. likely because of dark scenes and data compression. 2.5 hrs of movie prob better at 2.4gigs

,hackerps3,2013-01-10T23:42Z,Come on everybody let's keep all this towards the quality of the movie and things of that nature. I quickly browsed through the movie and it keeps saying For You're Consideration at the bottom of the screen while playing. I play the file using VLC Media Player. Any idea what that may be anybody? Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks for the upload scene4all! I greatly appreciate all of your uploads!
,hackerps3,2013-01-10T23:45Z,Sorry I forgot to give my ratings of the video. It's a great quality and haven't watched the end yet but so far I'm at A=8 V=8.
