Today everyone--whether they know it or not--is in the emotional transportation business. More and more, success is won by creating compelling stories that have the power to move partners, shareholders, customers, and employees to action. Simply put, if you canΓÇÖt tell it, you canΓÇÖt sell it. And this book tells you how to do both.

Historically, stories have always been igniters of action, moving people to do things. But only recently has it become clear that purposeful stories--those created with a specific mission in mind--are absolutely essential in persuading others to support a vision, dream or cause.

Peter Guber, whose executive and entrepreneurial accomplishments have made him a success in multiple industries, has long relied on purposeful story telling to motivate, win over, shape, engage and sell. Indeed, what began as knack for telling stories as an entertainment industry executive has, through years of perspiration and inspiration, evolved into a set of principles that anyone can use to achieve their goals.

In Tell to Win, Guber shows how to move beyond soulless Power Point slides, facts, and figures to create purposeful stories that can serve as powerful calls to action. Among his techniques:



*Capture your audienceΓÇÖs attention first, fast and foremost

*Motivate your listeners by demonstrating authenticity

*Build your tell around ΓÇ£whatΓÇÖs in it for themΓÇ¥

*Change passive listeners into active participants

*Use ΓÇ£state-of-the-heartΓÇ¥ technology online and offline to make sure audience commitment remains strong


To validate the power of telling purposeful stories, Guber includes in this book a remarkably diverse number of ΓÇ£voicesΓÇ¥--master tellers with whom heΓÇÖs shared experiences. They include YouTube founder Chad Hurley, NBA champion Pat Riley, clothing designer Normal Kamali, ΓÇ£Mission to MarsΓÇ¥ scientist Gentry Lee, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, former South African president Nelson Mandela, magician David Copperfield, film director Steven Spielberg, novelist Nora Roberts, rock legend Gene Simmons, and physician and author Deepak Chopra.

After listening to this extraordinary mix of voices, youΓÇÖll know how to craft, deliver--and own--a story that is truly compelling, one capable of turning others into viral advocates for your goal.
