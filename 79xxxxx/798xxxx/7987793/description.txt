Here is our special remastered BrDrip of "Terminator" first opus of the saga released on 1984.
Btw,we forgot a little thing :
We wish you all a very happy new year 2013 with our best wishes and more indeed.

BD source : Metal box jacket "Limited edition" released to public on market in october 2012...
So far,this is the best remastered version of this one,concerning quality between video and sound and color as well.
For this time,we bring you it as mkv. H.263 in hd.720p still with our lovered E-AC3 aka DD+ 32 bit/48 Khz/5.1 at 640 kbps in English and French with english sub only.
This movie has been sucessfully tested on PotPlayer and PowerDVD 11 and 12 as fully working anyway.
We always test our movie through an AV Amplifier Home Cinema Pioneer VSX-2022K
7.2 channels to be sure to get true functional sound anyway.
Btw,no more pixelated garbage as well as you can find few screenshoots of this movie where you know and as usual anyway
...
You may get possible few micro Pixelations but no more in any case if you run on a decent 
video graphic card in 256 bits or more.
A 128 bits should still working quite fine within but we cannot promise you the best possible experience on a 64 bits model so.
Final Thoughts : a good 15/20 seems approximaly just right for...
A good quality can be expected for sure anyway.
Final size : 9,5 Go
Status : PreRC3 as experimental but working project anyway.
We recommend you to try 24 bits sound if supported on your computer or try 16 bits to see if better so.(PotPlayer supports 16,24 and 32 bits sound anyway)
Btw,take care 'cause Basses can be quite strong in 32 bits so set your bass to 0.0 db strict for starting and see after to be sure then.
