,ectoendomezo,2013-01-04T15:27Z,"Hey Vicerock..

first..Thanks for ALL the beautifully done torrents..in this phase of my life of hiding in my cave..its more than appreciated..

I never really do this...make requests..but I'm asking my favorite Artist UL'rs..you..zenbud..for these..Please..two are straight up Unavailable or in 'German Language Only' or suffering from the Mortal Fatal Flaw in torrents..no Hardcoded English Subs in NON english critical plot moments;

'Killing Zoe'

'Browns Requiem'

'Rolling Thunder'.

That last one IS available but NOT at your quality..a 'Keeper' 2-3G rip would be greatly appreciated AND imho a service to the 'Great Torrent Library' (Before it too like Alexandria and Demonoid is Burned by Philistines)
Thank you..truly.."
