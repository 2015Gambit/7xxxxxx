Short Circuit: Live at the Electric Circus is a compilation album of songs recorded live at the Electric Circus, Manchester, on the 1st and 2 October 1977, two concerts marking the last nights of the venue before it closed. Released by Virgin Records in 1978, the album was originally only available on 10-inch blue, black, and yellow vinyl.

Manchester legendary band Joy Division performed under their original name Warsaw on the second night, but the track was credited to Joy Division on the sleeve as they had changed their name in January 1978. Guitarist Bernard Sumner can be heard shouting "Have you all forgotten Rudolf Hess!?" at the beginning of "At a Later Date".

The album was reissued on CD in 1990 on the Blue Plate label.

In 2004, the record was included in a trakMarx review of Classic Punk Rock Compilation LPs.

The album was the debut release for The Fall; Joy Division self-released their debut 7" An Ideal for Living just 13 days earlier, and all the other bands had released debuts in 1977.
