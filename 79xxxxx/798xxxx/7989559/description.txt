====================================
 Correspondence Chess Database 2013
====================================

a correspondence chess database
in standard Chessbase .cbh format
complete with many keys

-1,041,845 total correspondence chess games 
-years from 1804 to 2012
-latest games added in Sept 2012
-ICCF, IECC, IECG, mail, email, chess server, etc

This is not so complete and up-to-date as the analogous Mega Chess Database for over-the-board players and frankly it needs a lot of work. But if you play serious correspondence chess you will probably want to take a look. It's interesting and may be useful for research. It might also be a basis for building your own correspondence chess database using this one for starters. I notice that it also contains some Fischer Random Chess (960) games which may not be of interest.

Instructions:
-unpack the .7z file which gives an .exe file
-run the .exe file which installs the database
-open the .cbh file with Chessbase or your favorite CB GUI (Fritz, Hiarcs, Junior, Shredder, etc)
