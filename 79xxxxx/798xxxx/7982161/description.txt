"Here are some songs that I put together for an EP that came together last minute.  Scary Bolly Dub is a song I've been playing in my sets for a while.  I use it more as a DJ tool, but I wanted you guys to have it.

The Reason and Leaving came together last minute.  I made Leaving in my hotel room in Mexico and just finished The Reason an hour ago in my hotel room in Miami.  I guess it's just kind of a reflection of how I'm feeling right now.  Hope you guys enjoy these quality WAVS.  

Sincerely,
Sonny Moore"
