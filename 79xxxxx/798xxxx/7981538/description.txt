"God Has Spoken"

Eaten up by his guilt over Flacos death in 
the fire, Cruz goes to Casey to confess. 
While Shay recovers from a head injury 
sustained in the ambulance crash, Severide 
asks Dawson for her help in dealing with his 
own injury. Casey is caught in the middle of 
a family conflict between his mother and 
sister. Elsewhere, Herrmann finds a business 
deal hard to stomach.

Evolve... or die.
