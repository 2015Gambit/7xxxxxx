To quote a YouTube user who has kindly uploaded this:

"How many out there remember this ancient mac game, with music by Petteri Lajunen of Pest/TranZe unfamy (anyone have any of his other contributions from the 90's demoscene)?"

Whatever the "unfamy", this soundtrack is killer, as was the game. Music from all five standard levels, plus the title theme, is included. Please seed!
