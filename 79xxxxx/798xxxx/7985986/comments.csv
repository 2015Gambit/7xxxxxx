But I suppose if St Clair has the time and money it takes to go through the process, he's entitled to have his name attached to these follies.

The sadder thing is that there are people who actually take this tripe seriously and believe it possible."
,BUZZFILMS,2013-01-04T22:37Z,i agree with you LemonJ-Lo .. it is a very intersting read nonetheless for sci fi fans and free energy buffs & comic fans! and who knows some actual scientist and engineers might find some useful information in st clair's patents.  what do you think about the other info LemonJ-Lo? im curious your take on the additional info...
