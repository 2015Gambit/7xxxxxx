I know the Marvel NOW torrent for this week already had this issue inside, but here it is anyway.

It moves me to again mention that fans of Marvel Comics may want to send prayers or just good vibes out to X-Factor writer Peter David, who suffered a stroke while on vacation with family over the holidays. Peter was the LONGTIME writer of Incredible Hulk, and developed Betty (now Red She-Hulk) into an awesome supporting cast member. --STFmaryville
