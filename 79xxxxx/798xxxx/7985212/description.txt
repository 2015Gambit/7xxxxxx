 Home ownership is a cornerstone of the American dream, but it's a complex process that, without the right guidance, can seem like a nightmare. This Missing Manual takes you through the process of buying a home, from start to finish. Along the way, you'll use the book's expert advice and fill-in forms to identify the house you want, figure out what kind of neighborhood you want to live in, determine what a target home is really worth, make an offer, and close the deal. Throughout the process, this book helps you: 
 Realistically determine how much house you can afford 
 Assemble a real estate team that's looking after your interests and not the seller's 
 Understand the different ways to finance your house, and which is best for you 
 Create an attractive offer with the best chance of acceptance 
 Learn what lenders look for so you can get your mortgage approved 
 Inspect your new home to uncover potential problems 
 Prepare all the right paperwork for a smooth closing
