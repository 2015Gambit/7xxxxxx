One Moment, One Morning - EPUB + MOBI
The Brighton to London line. The 7:44 am train. Cars packed with commuters. One woman occupies her time observing the people around her. Opposite, a girl puts on her make-up. Across the aisle, a husband strokes his wifeΓÇÖs hand. Further along, another woman flicks through a glossy magazine. Then, abruptly, everything changes: a man collapses, the train is stopped, and an ambulance is called.
For at least three passengers on the 7:44 on that particular morning, life will never be the same again. ThereΓÇÖs Lou, in an adjacent seat, who witnesses events first hand. Anna, whoΓÇÖs sitting further up the train, impatient to get to work. And Karen, the manΓÇÖs wife.

Telling the story of the week following that fateful train journey, One Moment, One Morning is a stunning novel about love and loss, about family and ΓÇô above allΓÇô friendship. A stark reminder that, sometimes, one moment is all it takes to shatter everything. Yet it also reminds us that somehow, despite it all, life can and does go on.

The Two Week Wait - AZW3 + EPUB + MOBI
After a health scare, Brighton-based Lou is forced to confront the fact that her time to have a baby is running out. She canΓÇÖt imagine a future without children, but her partner doesnΓÇÖt seem to feel the same way, and sheΓÇÖs not sure whether she could go it alone. Meanwhile, up in Yorkshire, Cath is longing to start a family with her husband, Rich. No one would be happier to have a child than Rich, but Cath is infertile. Could these strangers help one another out? Combining Sarah RaynerΓÇÖs deft exploration of raw emotions with the joy and resilience of friendship, The Two Week Wait is a memorable, moving page-turner about two very different women, each yearning to create a family of her own.
