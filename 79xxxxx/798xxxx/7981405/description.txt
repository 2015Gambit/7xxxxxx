"Presumed Guilty"

Enrique Rodriquez, a working-class Catholic man 
is determined to seek justice for his sister when 
he finds out that she's part of a church cover-
up. The scandal is made public when Father Shea, 
a priest, is pulled from his car and brutally 
beaten. When the police arrive, they arrest Fin's 
ex-wife's brother, Sam Randall. Despite Sam's 
former criminal record and various stints behind 
bars, Fin doesn't think Sam is their man and asks 
his SVU partners for help getting to the bottom 
of the case.
