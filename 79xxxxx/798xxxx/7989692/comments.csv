If not you might want to do what I did for several months last year: Subscribe to her podcast for $6 a month.  All the commercials are cut and those shows have none of the bumper music interrupting her comments leading into or out of the commercials."
[T],480v,2013-01-08T08:37Z,Yes I found an alternative feed. She's on a pretty right wing station that broadcasts Beck and other right wing talkers. Even their news feed is Fox news.
[T],480v,2013-01-08T08:39Z,"I wasn't too hip to the idea when Randi 1st joined Premier Radio, but let's face it, the other side has better resources to protect her. They give her more freedom to say what she wants which I find ironic. But most importantly, conservative listeners gets an opportunity to hear our side. Her rise in conservative callers is by no accident. lol, a lot of them sound confused because she makes a lot of sense. In a way Randi has infiltrated that market. She still isn't as wide spread as Limbaugh, but nevertheless, this is a good thing. She's really cut down on talking down to these people which is important."
