Not this again. :|

At what point is the frame rate screwed on these releases?"

VERY NORMAL OK?"
,cmonk2112,2013-01-04T08:16Z,probably something to do with the fact that the movie isnt out of theatres yet so they dont want someone getting ahold of the good quality movie until they get paid
,poijhbn,2013-01-04T08:30Z,"I'm sure nobody would want Academy members to see their film as a jerky piece of trash. And Skyfall was 24p.

Oh well, it's still great quality so soon after release."
