Book Description
4 STAR DOODY'S REVIEW!
"The myth of the difficulty of the neurosciences for the average medical student is dispensed with this book....This is a very useful book for health science students. The integration of real-life clinical cases with neuroscience concepts helps students to focus on the important aspects. This is a superb contribution to the field with little in common with other review books in this field."--Doody's Review Service
