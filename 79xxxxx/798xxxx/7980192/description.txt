||									||
||		ViDEO LENGTH: 2h07m35s					||
||									||
||		NOTES: Okay, a couple things with this release, and 	||
||		we're going to be honest about it.			||
||									||
||		1) It's shit. Why? The feed while capping got all 	||
||		grainy and crappy. We tried our best to smoothen it out	||
||		but throughout a majority of this you'll see some	||
||		moving pixels, like we added some 1940s filter or 	||
||		something to it. The video colouring itself is fine	||
||		for the most part. Audio is the same as always (fine).	||
||									||
||		2) Some websites like TVrage incorrectly report this	||
||		as a new episode, s01e04. That is not right. The Book	||
||		of Levi episode of Amish Mafia is simply episodes 1-3	||
||		with the social reload Discovery likes to do, featuring	||
||		tweets about the show. This also has a sneak peek of	||
||		the real s01e04 epiosde, which the scene will most	||
||		likely do. (so leech off them even though they hate p2p)||
||									||
||		3) We weren't totally sure how to name this release	||
||		since it's not a S01 special. It's kind of like		||
||		and extended/modified cut. But the name of this rls	||
||		is pretty self explanatory of what it is.		||
||									||
||		4) Adding on to note 1, we'd have simply recapped this	||
||		book of levi episode with the feed 100% correct and not	||
||		shit but according to our tvguide it's not airing	||
||		again anytime soon, if at all. So if you absolutely	||
||		love Amish Mafia, here you go. If this doesn't interest	||
||		you, it's fine with us. Just wanted to share it. Bye.	||

||				ABOUT:					||
||									||
||		UNPOPULAR is a lame P2P group that sucks at		||
||		releasing on time and in high quality. They		||
||		do what they can, but without HDTV feed or		||
||		any prior encoding experience, they receive		||
||		more complaints than compliments. They try!		||
