                            NOTE:
                           -------

While the first volume from the vanguard '80s label stuck with in-house artists, this second volume of ZTT's favorite 12"s collects some "related" material, as when in-house act the Art of Noise remixed Sir Paul McCartney ("Spies Like Us"). 
Elsewhere, there's Godley & Creme's extended "Cry", which features Art of Noise members on its backing tracks along with label head Trevor Horn as its producer, and Scritti Politti's "Absolute" is included thanks to its remix from AoN member Gary Langan.
 It all lets synth pop historians examine that short sliver of time when every remix wanted to be a ZTT remix with narration, pompous literary quotes, and isolation of each track on the multi-track all being part of the formula.
 It was a grand time for headphones, and when you add a mammoth remix of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's "Two Tribes" and a couple choice mixes from Propaganda, it doesn't matter that the filler is worse for wear after all these years, and that the Mint Juleps cut is an unnecessarily epic 14 minutes.
 Surprising the series got to "hardcore fans only" by Vol. 2, but the hardcore fans will still love it and appreciate not having to wait for their remix fix of Instinct, Nasty Rox, and Das Psych-oh! Rangers.
