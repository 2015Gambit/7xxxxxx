,rajakumar,2013-01-04T23:41Z,"the audio on this one is out of sync and need to be corrected by vlc player while playing with video.

video: very dark blurry scenes   7/10
audio: out of sync                     8/10

thanks"
,Mutegrill,2013-01-05T03:47Z,"I don't trust someone who demands to be believed merely based on his word (rajakumar), when the possibilities to prove the points he claim is so grand:

Post proper screen-caps to show us how blury the movie is, or link us to a sample to let us know how much out-of sync it is.

Summary justice is not welcome on piratebay, so I intend to download from charlesfire22, thank you very much! :-)

Finally, a useful tip for the uploader: To rid any doubts, to fight off loosly based claims of the quality and to gather a bigger base of followers (seeders), ALWAYS attach AT LEAST singular screencaps (not mashed up thumnails builds), or better yet; attach a video sample (short is enough)."

,vaseem81,2013-01-05T13:39Z,Thanks for sharing i will say one thing about quality that for this size it is not bad i really appreciate the effort you put for sharing this. Thank you once again.
,michaelrwatson,2013-01-08T04:09Z,"@Mutegrill: I recommend you quit doing drugs ASAP. 

Meanwhile, can anyone say if this has/needs subs for foreign parts..?  "
,jalucian,2013-01-09T02:59Z,"The audio is not out of synch, but the video bitrate is so unbelievably low that the very dark scenes near the end of the movie are unwatchable. I appreciate someone who wants to limit file size to save space, but not at the expense of image quality to the point where the pixels in dark scenes are almost as big as a fingernail when viewed fullscreen. That's inexcusable. It's so bad that I'm having to stop the movie with 30 minutes remaining and download one of the larger file size torrents just so I can stand to finish the movie. 311 for video bitrate is obscenely low. At this resolution, it should be at LEAST twice that. "
,scottsasse,2013-01-10T03:03Z,WTF is wrong with the comments section??
