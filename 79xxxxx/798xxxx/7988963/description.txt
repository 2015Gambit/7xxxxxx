Game Notes
I'm Kouta Koikawa, and I'm having a problem with my studies. It's not that
my classmates' ruckus bothers me, I sit at the front of the room to avoid
their antics. The real problem is my social studies professor, Chieri Hase.
From the day she started teaching here I haven't been able to keep my eyes
off her! She's a rookie teacher, but I'm captivated by every movement of
her beautiful body. I can't work up the nerve to confess my feelings - I'm
her student, after all, and I'm sure she wouldn't find this sort of
forbidden love to be proper... until one day when fate brings us together
in an encounter that changes our lives forever.
