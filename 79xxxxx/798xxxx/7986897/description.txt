celtic - Alan Stivell discography


Dig the music lore of Alan Stivell:
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Stivell


Since his father rebuilt the celtic harp from ancient documents, Stivell resumed and expanded the celtic tradition in his works:
Irish, Scottish, Welsh and especially his own Breton lore became the field of his music explorations.
He's not only an harpist but he plays as well flutes, bagpipes and he's able to manage entire orchestras: an all-round music maestro.
Dreaming airs mix with gaelic jazz hard rock arrangements... This is pure progressive folk. :)

If you're lost and dont know where to start... try for instance the 1972 Olympia Concert, or the marvellous 1973 Chemins de Terre album.
If you're an experienced progger you may like to plunge directly in the majestic Symphonie Celtique.
Or maybe, from a more modern "world music" point of view, you can start from the 1998 1 Douar album and listen for instance to Alan Stivell which duets with Youssou N'Dour in a song which could really be the world music manifesto.

There's so much to hear, to learn and to love in Stivell's discography.
It may also happen that you start to play strange instruments...
that you start to transcribe harp tunes on the guitar with fingerstyle techniques...
that you start singing in breton...
it may happen to you... To me... it happened :D

There are 30 albums: 27 from his discography (pretty complete apart some redundant compilation) and 3 with various authors.
The sampling rate is 320kbps. (Except for two compilations with various artists) 

Enjoy :)
