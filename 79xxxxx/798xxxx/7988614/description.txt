Walter Matthau gives a great performance as an elderly radical who unleashes grey power on the world. Based on a play, this explores human relationships in a funny-tragic kind of way. No big explosions - but... I got lots of takers for The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne, maybe pirates will like this also. Dedicated to lovers of fine acting.
