,Chased911,2013-01-09T23:48Z,"YIFI Team is like Apple. It had the edge, was ahead of all with amazing uploads and quality. Now, others have caught up with better uploads.

I am not talking about this particular movie, but in general.

WTF is up with 10,000 uploads of old movies nobody cares about?

Step it up..."

,SpotDiablo,2013-01-10T10:59Z,"This file SHOULD NOT be in the HIGHRES movie section. 700MB is not HIGHRES. Always so many YIFY files are here when they are not real 720P or 1080P.
Stop polluting the HIGHRES section with your normal quality files. Time to get real bro."
