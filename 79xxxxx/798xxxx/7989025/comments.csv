Novoseltsev: I have two kids. A boy and... a boy, too. Two boys. 

Kalugina: Well, how's the cat? 
Novoseltsev: Better, she said. 
Kalugina: Just so she said, didn't she? 
Novoseltsev: Yes, she did. 
Kalugina: Such a wonderful cat! The best cat in the world, isn't she? 

Samokhvalov: It's just that... it compromises you. 
Kalugina: I have had such a spotless reputation, it's about time I were compromised. 

Kalugina: What are you doing? 
Verochka: Uhm, I'm considering these boots, Ljudmila Prokofjevna. Do you like them? 
Kalugina: They are very slutty, I would not buy them. And in your place, I would concentrate on my job, and shop for boots after work. 
[Exits. ] 
Verochka: Meaning, good boots, I should take them. 

Kalugina: You didn't do too well in grade school, did you? 
Novoseltsev: Let's leave my shady past alone. 

Novoseltsev: Don't hit me on the head! It's my sensitive spot! 
Kalugina: It's your empty spot! 

Verochka's husband: I've realized why we keep fighting. We need a baby. 
Verochka: [on the phone at work] You want a baby? 
Verochka's husband: Yes, and as soon as possible. 
Verochka: I... I can't right now. 

Novoseltsev: Why did you have to eat modeling clay? 
Novoseltsev's Son: But I ate it with sugar. 

Shura: [collecting money for a birthday present] 50 copecks! 
Verochka: Again? 
Shura: When you're fifty, we'll collect for you too! 
Verochka: I won't live that long. I have an unhealthy job. 

Shura: [collecting money] 50 copecks! 50 copecks! Masha V. had a baby! 
Novoseltsev: If someone else at this job dies or has a baby, I'll be left without lunch. "

This is really a very good movie - if you haven't seen it yet, do so! It's a really funny movie... I don't know if you can get this movie in english, if you understand russian, this is a movie you h a v e to see!

First Russian movie I have seen on the TV after a very long time. I saw a lot of serious historical Russian movies, so it was really a pleasant surprise for me. Great and enjoyable comedy, excellent actor performances. Simply loved it !!!
