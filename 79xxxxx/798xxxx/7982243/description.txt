This is a selection of 10 tracks of mine that I like. It took over 1 year of sporadic work.

This release was put together on a very small budget, seriously, I only own 1 microphone (An SM57 *shudder*).

Everything was recorded and mixed in Reason 5 + Record and later on Reason 6.

Stop Calibrating and Absum were among the first tracks I ever recorded, hopefully you should be able to notice my production skills 

improving as the album progresses.

I hope to redo some of these songs one day with a bigger budget, more time, more gear and more skills. For now, I have worked on them 

enough and it is time for me to concentrate on my live performance skills and the writing of new material.


Enjoy,
 
Nondairy
