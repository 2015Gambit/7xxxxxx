Black slapstick comedy about a guy who is surprised by a burglar as he is about to commit suicide. He asks the burglar to do the job (for money) but the burglar puts it off for a day; meanwhile he subcontracts the deed to another guy. Meanwhile the suicide has ended up in a night club and fallen in love - life doesn't seem so bad after all. Now he must go through a series of misadventures to recall the contract.

An early sound film, sometimes it seems like a silent. Now it is mostly known as the point of origin for the song "Wenn Ich mir was wuenschen duerfte", since made famous by many singers.
