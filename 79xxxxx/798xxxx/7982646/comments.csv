,GoodGravy,2013-01-03T14:37Z,"Yeah, my link is what came up by default via a google search. Since TvTeam very rarely sets up links for the upload, I ran with what seemed to be the obvious, so, EnemyDrone, you might want to go see the screener; this is the only thing I hate about TvTeam uploads, lack of info & links."
