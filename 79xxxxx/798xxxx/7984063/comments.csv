,zipomatic,2013-01-04T01:05Z,"I have every episode of Party Hardcore that has ever been released (in weekly form) from 2004-2012, mainly in low quality formats (to be fair, the early years were only ever released in low quality)

So I'll probably upload the monthly episodes up until December 2005. 2006 onwards were probably released on DVD."
,bribasse,2013-01-04T12:59Z,"WOW i envy you:)  thank you very much, that would be great if you did that:)  yes at some point in 2006 they started making dvds of the show:)    The fact that they are real girls makes it so good:)"
,bribasse,2013-01-10T11:59Z,"it would be great with party hardcore 2004 november, december :)    but only if you have the time of course:)   how many mins. does such a upload take for you??"
