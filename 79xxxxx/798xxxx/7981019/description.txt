Lord Asano is goaded into an assault by a corrupt court official in the Shogun's palace, and then forced to commit seppuku! Learning that Asano was sentenced without a proper investigation, his retainers set in motion a plan to enact revenge on the official whose insults proved too much for Asano to bear.
