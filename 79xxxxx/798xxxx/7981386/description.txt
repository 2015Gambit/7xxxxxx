Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, January 2 broadcast of the Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks down the continued threat imposed against Americans' right to bear arms as he revisits a U.S. Army manual outlining exactly how gun confiscation under Obama order would take place. Alex also blasts the traitorous Republicans completely selling out to the New World Order by "compromising" on the so-called fiscal cliff, begetting a 41:1 ratio of tax increases to spending cuts. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes weather weapon expert and Iran-Contra affair whistle-blower Bob Fletcher.
