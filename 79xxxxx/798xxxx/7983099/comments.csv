,bungunners,2013-01-03T17:12Z,Followed the instructions right down to the letter and it all works excellent!!  Thank you very much for this fix.  It's nice having those extra features of 1.04.  Superb!
,l1ll3man,2013-01-04T13:14Z,"I don't get it? What am I supposed to do with the files/folders that I just downloaded?

I backed up my old save files from v1.02 (was 2 folders named; 48 and 54) @ C:ProgramDataOrbit46

Runned the patcher, started a new game and played until I were able to manually save the game. 
Then exit and replaced the newly created folder @ C:ProgramDataOrbit46

But when I start up the game again, it just asks me to start a new game again.

Help please."

You were not supposed to replace your backed up save folder after manually saving. You had to copy paste the 1.04 crack to the game's bin folder.

Step 1 is so that you won't lose your save in case something goes wrong.

What you actually do with this method is to open the 1.04 version of the game with the 1.02 crack to make the game able to read your 1.02 save, then load it and manually save and then copy paste the 1.04 crack. Now you have the features of 1.04 and your old game save working."
,VÃ­vek,2013-01-05T14:30Z,Do i have to do this every-time i closed the game or only once?
,hasfas22,2013-01-06T00:51Z,I tried to do the same with a 1.03 to get 100% completion but it doesn't seem to work any info anyone?

No, just once. "
