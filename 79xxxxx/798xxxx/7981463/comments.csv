If you are considering new TV shows to upload how about ""inside the NFL? It is only uploaded by one person and he's usually so busy it doesn't get put up for days after it airs. (Once the Sunday games air it is pretty useless because it's old news.) I totally appreciate his efforts though!!  It would just be nice to getit  in the quick time-frame ETTV generally works within.

It airs on Showtime on Wednesday and runs through the Superbowl.

Thanks for the consideration - and thanks again for all your great uploads!"
