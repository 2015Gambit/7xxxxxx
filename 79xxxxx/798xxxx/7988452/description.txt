A new twist on Zombies with action, horror, and the uncomfortably recognizable in the old West! A stop-lossed Army vet. A president in office without the popular vote. A terror crisis gripping the nation! Meet William Wade, newly minted - and seriously resentful - secret agent for President Rutherford B. Hayes. His mission with cerebral partner J.J. Flynn: travel the West and investigate outbreaks of the living dead - each one more horrifyingly advanced than the last. For Wade, 1877 is turning out to be one rotten year.
