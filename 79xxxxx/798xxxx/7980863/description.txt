We are the dreamers of dreams

Today's magic presented by the Digital Insanity heroes is:

MAGIX Xara 3D Maker 7 v7.0.0.442

Cracker Brainrain & DarkSide Protection Serial
Supplier Digital Insanity Release Date 01/01/2013
Packager Digital Insanity Release Type Keygen
Tester Digital Insanity Release Size 24 disks/10.0 MB Description

Note to siteops/nukers:

This time we decided to pack the setups too next to our
keygen (even the non pro, and older versions despite the
fact that some of them were released with patch), because
as we noticed the downloadable setups/contents can vary
depending on various circumstances for example which magix
domain you visit (http://www.magix.com 
http://www.magix.com/gb, http://www.magix.com/de, etc) or
which country your IP belongs to, and who knows what else
Different versions can have different product parameters
so we are trying to avoid troubles at the end user side
with this decision

Note to MAGIX authors:

We would like to give something back and not only take
away, so open your eyes now: Your WMI implementation is
faulty and will never be executed properly
You should call CoInitializeSecurity to set the needed
privileges to be able to query the MAC address through WMI

Special thanks goes to DarkSide for hardcore reversing
sessions and many sleepless nights.
Always remember: Quality over quantity

We wish you Happy New Year and all the best in the future
