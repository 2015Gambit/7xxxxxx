Book Description
HTML5 and CSS3 (the latest standards for HTML and cascading style sheets) are packed with coding options that make it easier than ever to create web pages with the features users want today, from an up-to-date look and feelΓÇªto immediate validation of user entriesΓÇªto audio and video samplings. At the same time, there are still older browsers and millions of existing web sites that require you to integrate HTML5 and CSS3 features with the earlier standards. So how do you learn all this?

This book is exactly the practical approach you need. It teaches you how to use HTML5 and CSS3 the way they were meant to work, with HTML5 to provide the page content and CSS3 to format the content and lay out the pages. But it also teaches you how to use the HTML5 and CSS3 features alongside the earlier standards to ensure that your pages will work for the widest possible audience. So if youΓÇÖre going to be developing web pagesΓÇªwhether youΓÇÖre a web designer, a JavaScript programmer, a server-side programmer, or a rookieΓÇªthis book is for you.

It begins with a 6-chapter, quick-start course to get you working at the professional level right away. Soon, youΓÇÖll be using HTML5 featuresΓÇªlike the semantic tags that improve the structure of your content and your search engine rankingsΓÇªalong with CSS3 featuresΓÇªlike text and border shadows, rounded corners, and background gradients that give your pages a cutting-edge feel. And youΓÇÖll know how and when to blend them with the earlier HTML and CSS code.

After that quick-start, youΓÇÖll learn how to make your pages work better for your site visitors by enhancing them with audio and video filesΓÇªusing the jQuery Mobile library to deliver content on mobile devicesΓÇªadding jQuery routines for special effects like slide shows and accordionsΓÇªand using JavaScript to provide for features like geolocation, web storage, canvas, and drag-and-dropΓÇªthe kinds of skills that go far beyond what youΓÇÖll find in other introductory books.

Who this book is for
This book is for anyone who wants to develop web pages the professional way, using HTML5 semantic tags to structure the content and CSS to format and lay it out on the page. That includes:

- budding web developers
- experienced web developers who want to update their HTML/CSS skills to the new standards
- web developers who still use tables for page layout when they should be using CSS

But itΓÇÖs also for web programmers, whether theyΓÇÖre working in JavaScript or using a server-side language like PHP, ASP.NET, or Java servlets and JSPs. Web programmers are often surprised at the intricacies involved in writing good HTML and CSS code, yet understanding that piece makes them more effective members of the development team.
