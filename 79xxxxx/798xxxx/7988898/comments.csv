,marvelnerd76,2013-01-05T20:56Z,Dude you dropped an awesome bomb this time! Love X-files. Great collection put together. As always my thanks.
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-01-05T21:04Z,"Thanks so much for this. I really wanted the 2008-2009 X-files. now if I could only find the mini novels they did for high schoolers back in the day, lol"
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-01-05T22:50Z,"A question - I have read the Topps comic series, reprinted in the three volume sets, and these. Are there other X-files comics?"
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-06T01:38Z,"BabiesDontNeedSpleens, I started trying to answer your question and it's so complicated I gave up. So you may want to go to Wikipedia and read the The X-Files (comics) article! In short, the Topps series went 41 issues, plus a 1/2 issue, 2 Annuals, 3 Digests, and the original graphic novel ""Afterflight."" Topps and two different U.K. publishers have released trade paperbacks, but none of them cover that whole series.

Anyway, the Topps comics ran 1995-1998 for about 50 issues or so and DC/Wildstorm 2008-2011 with these 13."
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-06T05:07Z,"rakib2099, i could not find Buffy the Vampire Slayer Classic 01, 02, 03 but i did share the original issues that they reprint:

[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-06T06:11Z,"BabiesDontNeedSpleens, I do have ""The X-Files: Skin"" an original novel by Ben Mezrich. It came out in '99 or 2000 and it's in PDF format, if you want it."
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-01-07T10:25Z," Skin would be most appreciated, and thanks. 

I started looking up the X-files question as well, and see what you mean about complex. sorry bout that - just love the series.

Thanks for the information, and the upload again. Like you told Black Canary, old comics never die here. I think they just find people who keep loving them. "
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-07T15:32Z,"BabiesDontNeedSpleens, I was a big X-Files fan in high school. I vividly remember an extended preview for the Pilot episode, our dimly-lit living room, the TV set I saw it on. It's etched into my memory, I guess.

Here's the Mezrich X-Files book. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7994300/THE_X-FILES_-_SKIN_-_BEN_MEZRICH_%28HarperCollins%29

About love of old comics, I can recall being age 11 at a flea market, the first time I ever bought a back issue. Rifling through the bagged and boarded comics in a long box... 

I also used to love reading the back issue ads in Marvels, and thinking of which ones I would buy if I had the money (or a checking account, lol).

Never would have imagined someday people would have the capability to download every book in the entire damn ad!"
,rakib2099,2013-01-08T10:13Z,THE X-FILES Afterflight link plz...
