THE X-FILES/30 DAYS OF NIGHT

Two of the most popular horror properties of the last two decades collide in this harrowing 6-issue adventure of epic proportions. Co-writers Steve Niles (writer and co-creator of 30 Days of Night) and rockstar-turned-writer Adam Jones (the band Tool) team with the amazing, moody artistry of industry legend Tom Mandrake (THE SPECTRE, BATMAN) to unleash the ultimate comics culture crossover.

When evidence of a possible cannibal killer in Wainright, Alaska, draws the attention of the FBI, Agents Mulder and Scully draw the less-than-glamorous assignment. But all is not as it seems once the agents are on the ground. Not only has the long seasonal darkness begun to fall, but thereΓÇÖs something unnatural about a few of the locals. And what does a chilling, mysterious black ship have to do with the murders?
