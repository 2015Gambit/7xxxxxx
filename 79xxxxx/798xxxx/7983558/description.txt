Dean Martin (born Dino Paul Crocetti; June 7, 1917 ΓÇô December 25, 1995) was an
American singer, film actor, television star and comedian.
One of the most popular and enduring American entertainers of the mid-20th
Century, Martin was nicknamed the "King of Cool" due to his seemingly
effortless charisma and self-assuredness. A member of the "Rat Pack," Martin
was a major star in four areas of show business: concert stage/night clubs,
recordings, motion pictures, and television. He was the host of the successful
television variety program The Dean Martin Show (1965-1974), and subsequently
The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts (1974-1985)
Martin's relaxed, warbling crooning voice earned him dozens of hit singles
including his signature songs "Memories Are Made of This", "That's
Amore", "Everybody Loves Somebody", "You're Nobody till Somebody Loves
You", "Sway", "Volare" and "Ain't That a Kick in the Head?".
