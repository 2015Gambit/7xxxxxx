,iHaunteR,2013-01-07T23:20Z,Can someone explain to me why people refuse to RIP in 1920x1080? I mean really is there an actual reason? Who has widescreen TVs?
,raiden121,2013-01-08T19:05Z,"@iHaunteR

It is ripped in 1080 it is just in letterbox format so the extra bit that would make it 1080 instead of 808 is the black bars.. movies aren't filmed in the 16:9 format. If you want it to fill the whole screen you would need to crop the sides which would make you lose part of the picture."
,raiden121,2013-01-08T19:07Z,If this truly is a blu-ray rip that is and not an upscaled dvd/dvd-screener rip that is
