Bloodsport... He plays for keeps!

"Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen!" Imagine the death and destruction a sadistic madman could cause if he were able to have any weapon he could think of appear in his hand simply by wishing it to. Well the man called Bloodsport has this ability. Can Superman stop this maniacal killer before more innocent lives are lost? Featuring Jimmy Olsen.
