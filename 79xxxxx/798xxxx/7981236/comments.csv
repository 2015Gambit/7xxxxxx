,AsifAkheir,2013-01-03T10:48Z,"@ shih9019. Is this the mockbuster one?

Wikipedia info:
Hansel & Gretel is produced by The Asylum, Directed by Anthony Ferrante, and is set for release direct-to-DVD on January 8, 2013. 
Hansel & Gretel is a mockbuster of the upcoming Paramount Pictures/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters."
,AsifAkheir,2013-01-03T11:13Z,"Blame The Asylum studios for this direct-to-DVD horror ""mockbuster"" directed by Anthony Ferrante.

Hansel & Gretel is a ""mockbuster"" of the upcoming Paramount/MGM film Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters directed by Tommy Wirkola and filmed in 3-D. "
,fourbinator,2013-01-03T12:53Z,"Sorry but what does mockbuster mean? Does it stand for parody, impresionnation, cheap copy or something like that?

Sorry for asking but english isn't my birth language :)"
,oobaka,2013-01-03T13:49Z,"This is NOT the movie as described. In the info, the uploader's imdb link points to the wrong movie.
It is NOT http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2381962/

This is the movie http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2415464/

@fourbinator
a mockbuster means a movie that is purposely meant to be VERY similar to a VERY popular movie. Such as Transmorphers which is a lot like Transformers"
,AsifAkheir,2013-01-04T07:56Z,"@ fourbinator

Mockbuster = cheap imitation of a film, deliberately designed in subject matter, title, etc. to be confused with an original good film. The Asylum studio specializes in such shoddy work.

see oobaka's example: Transmorphers -> Transformers 

Look up The Asylum studio in wikipedia for a list of other movies to avoid."
