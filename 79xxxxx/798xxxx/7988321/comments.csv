,Pseudoplaydo,2013-01-05T03:53Z,just about all the mkv's i get are in better quality... maybe someones just stuck on using WMP.

,bassposaune,2013-01-09T02:07Z,"Yeah this mkv is much better quality than the avi version.  

Why would anybody prefer the avi version.  It's not all that great.

Thanks a lot Acesn8s for the clean up.
