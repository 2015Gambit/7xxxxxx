Youngblood #75

It's been twenty years in the making, but YOUNGBLOOD reaches its 75th issue with an oversized story! And who can blame them?! In this issue Jeff Terrell returns to the team, Cougar realizes that as impossible as it seems, he might actually be in love. We get one more clue as to the fate of Badrock, and Die Hard and Vogue discover there is more "there" there than they every suspected. All this and a battle worthy of the world's greatest superhero team!
