Audiffex Pedals v1.0.7






A complete set of 36 plug-ins for guitar, bass, software instruments, vocal and acoustic instruments.

Audiffex guitar pedals - the legendary product, released under our previous label DSound 10 years ago as one of the first professional guitar software solutions. Because of a strong demand to release this set also for ProTools and as a standalone product, we have released the complete set of our stomp-box effects in one package.



   Modular system: instead of a single complex plug-in, you can create any order of the effects in the effect chain.
   Preset management: simple and exactly the same for all the effects.
   Exact models of real hardware in some effects - tube amplifiers, solid state amplifiers. Cabinets are measured by reference industrial measurement systems in a concrete dumb chamber.
   Consistent GUI: All the effects have similar control.
