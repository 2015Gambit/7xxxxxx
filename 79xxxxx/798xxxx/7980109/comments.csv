[T],blackcanary,2013-01-04T23:45Z,"Shark011, I generally prefer to upload a complete series instead of a calendar year because some series will have overlaps or would be missing several issues.

For example:  Batman v2 (New 52) #0-15 + Annual (Ongoing) was first published September 21, 2011, so a Batman (2012) torrent would miss the first four issues.  Deadpool (2012) would include Deadpool v3 #49-63 and Deadpool v4 (Marvel NOW!) #1-3.

If there's a specific series you would like to see collected, post a request on my most recent torrent.  If you request Batman (2012), I would probably upload Batman #0-15 + Annual and you could de-select the files you didn't need.  I'm always open to suggestions on how to do things better, though. :)"
