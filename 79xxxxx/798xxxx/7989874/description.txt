THE TYLENOL MAFIA: Marketing, Murder, and Johnson & Johnson (Revised 2nd Edition)
Overview
On September 29, 1982, seven people in Chicago died after taking Extra Strength 

Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide. Officials have long cited the scarcity of 

physical evidence and apparent lack of motive to explain why they never solved the 

Tylenol murders. However, new revelations and information not previously disclosed 

tell a very different story of a crime that should have been solved.

In a story both fascinating and dramatic in its warnings, The Tylenol Mafia rips away 

the facade of an investigation that J&J CEO James Burke labeled "A demonstration 

without parallel of government and business working with the news media to help 

protect the public." This gripping, meticulously documented expose' unearths the 

troubling details of an investigation corrupted by well-connected corporate 

executives and politically motivated government officials who simply buried the truth 

inside a shadow legal system inaccessible to everyday Americans.
 
Praise for The Tylenol Mafia...
Scott Bartz authored a brilliant piece of investigative journalism that reveals 

shocking details of what really happened when these tragic Tylenol murders were 

investigated.
