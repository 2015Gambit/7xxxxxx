The film was made by people who love making movies, and funded mostly by ourselves, family & friends. It was made on a very small budget – a truly “independent” film. Sadly, it’s become incredibly difficult for independent filmmakers to make their money back on their films nowadays, and that’s certainly true for us.

If you enjoy the film and would like to support us, I’d like to ask that you please consider buying a copy on DVD. It's been released in the USA & Canada already, and will be out in the UK & Australia very soon.  (No dates yet for any other countries.)  Or, you could also donate to us directly via Paypal, at our email address: midnightsonmovie@yahoo.com

I know some of you may doubt that I'm really the producer of the film, and that's certainly understandable.  Feel free to send an email to me via the ""contact"" link on our website, and I'll be happy to respond.  www.midnightsonmovie.com

Thanks, and enjoy the movie!"
