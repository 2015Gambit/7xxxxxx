When the combine has been assembled and is ready for painting, it undergoes a seven-hour process to receive the trademark John Deere green color. When John Deere decides to update its tractor design, the modification is first tested in the factory's state-of-the-art virtual reality lab to measure the potential impact to the assembly line process, saving both time and money. With its 21st century technology and human innovation, the John Deere mega factory shows the raw power behind one of agriculture's most vital machines."
