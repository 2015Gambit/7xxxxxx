Shelby Lynne

Lynne first broke through at the age of 18, when her demos landed her an appearance on TNNΓÇÖs Nashville Now series. Her 1999 breakthrough, I Am Shelby Lynne, led to a Grammy for Best New Artist. She followed with critically acclaimed albums Love, Shelby (2001), Identity Crisis (2003) and Suit Yourself (2005). She made her acting debut playing Johnny CashΓÇÖs mother in the Oscar-winning Fox Searchlight movie, Walk the Line. Just a Little LovinΓÇÖ, her tribute to Dusty Springfield, came out in 2008. In 2010, she founded her own label, EVERSO Records, a move that has given her the freedom to release music on her own timetable. Her EVERSO debut, Tears, Lies, And Alibis, dropped in 2010 and was followed by Merry Christmas (2010) and Revelation Road (2011). In November, she released a deluxe edition of the latter, which also includes her first-ever live album, recorded this past May at McCabeΓÇÖs Guitar Shop in Santa Monica, along with a Live in London DVD and a documentary on the making of the album.

ΓÇ£I loved hanging out with Daryl and the guys in the band,ΓÇ¥ enthuses Shelby. ΓÇ£Daryl is as amazing a person as he is a singer. I was honored to go to his place and make music. Daryl's Place will stay around a long time because it's all about the integrity of the artist and the music."
