PINK FLOYD - Royal Festival Hall 14Apr69
*** video from Anthony Stern's back-up DVD, with remastered LPCM audio ***

This video footage shows Pink Floyd rehearsing in the Royal Festival Hall,
London, on April 14, 1969, for their 1st performance of the conceptal suite
"The Man & The Journey".
These rushes were filmed by Anthony Stern.

Video : MPEG-2, 720x576, 4:3, 25fps, PAL, 7600kbps
Audio : 48kHz Linear PCM
Length: 25 min

Lineage: 16mm film > VHS(0) > DVD
Audio remastering by MOB

Details:

The video comes from a copy of the "back-up DVD" made for Anthony Stern some
years ago. Mr. Stern had a copy of this film made from 16mm to VHS for his
own personal use. Then, he had the VHS tape transferred to DVD. The video
here comes directly from that transfer, with no additional re-encoding.

The audio was slightly remastered in order to suppress VHS crackles and noises,
to adjust the levels and EQ, and to synchronise the different parts with the
video, especially the organ part where the audio was about 1,7s too early
compared to the video.

When authoring the DVD with the remastered LPCM audio, I did a menu and cut
the footage in 6 chapters:
- Afternoon
- The Beginning
- Beset By Creatures Of The Deep
- Doing It!
- The End Of The Beginning
- Nightmare (audio from the actual evening show)

Enjoy!
