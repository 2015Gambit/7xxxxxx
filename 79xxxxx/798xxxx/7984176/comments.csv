,borkborf,2013-01-04T08:35Z,"I'm running it on mountain lion 10.7.5 and it was working at first but I found that about 70% of the time of the gameplay the screen is black, and I tweaked the graphics settings all around but nothing helped. But it may still work for other people so someone should give it a try"

,joeka93,2013-01-06T05:10Z,"I'm running Mac Book Pro 15'' Lion . it works~ but there's a couple of bug problems in the gameplay.. here's what i've found..

- the screen goes black each time you step into a shadowed/dark space, if you move to a bright place, the screen returns to normal.

- there's a weird holographic thingy pops out on the soldiers eye

- when we switched into a battle mode, the interfaces is white

it's an awesome game btw. hope there's a fix for this."

,sirnilson,2013-01-07T12:05Z,guys google porting team and search for what you want on their website. has a lot of popular games. You'll need to fiddle around with some of the ports to get them working though.
