,eightyth_attempt2register,2013-01-04T07:04Z,I went to the EZTV and Sceneline torrents of this for the HD.  I sat 10 minutes on each on a very fast connection and no one would share the god damn torrent file despite a connection to 100s of seeders and peers.  Then I go to the DIbyaTPB and in 5 seconds someone sent me the torrent file.
