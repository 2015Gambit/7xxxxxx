,groundbeef,2013-01-03T16:59Z,Halo 1 works great. Unfortunately no matter how I try to install Halo 2 it won't start because of Windows Live error on Win 7 32bit. I have uninstalled Live and reinstalled through Halo 2 Installer. If there is a way to get Halo 2 running without issue please post. Thank you for this. R.G. Catalyst always gives great share!
