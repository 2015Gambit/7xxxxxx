Two of turntablismΓÇÖs finest go back to back: D-Styles and DJ Qbert live at Voodoo Music Experience in New Orleans.
Emerging to international fame in the mid-90s as forerunners of the growing turntablist movement, DJ Qbert and D-Styles ΓÇô both members of the Invisbl Skratch Piklz turntable collective ΓÇô are perhaps some of the most widely recognised turntablists within the hip hop spectrum, pioneering countless scratch techniques and unimaginable turntable tricks, in turn allowing the turntable to become widely accepted as a true musical instrument. From their iconic and wildly named Dirt Style battle break records (Black Market Snuff Breaks, 100mph Backsliding Turkey Kuts anyone?) to their oft-bootlegged live battle routines, the two have left an indelible mark on global DJ culture. With D-Styles a regular now at LAΓÇÖs infamous Low End Theory nights and Qbert pursuing turntable education, DJ-centric product design, animated movies and video game scoring, the two continue to expand the world of DJ-ing.
