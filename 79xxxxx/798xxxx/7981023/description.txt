#7 requested by hrmschach. I threw in the complete miniseries. Pretty good storyline from what I read, but definitely Mature Readers for extreme gore, just f.y.i.

From Wikipedia:

No Hero is a superhero comic book created by writer Warren Ellis and Juan Jose Ryp.

No Hero takes place in a world where superheroes have existed since the 1960s and came about as a reaction to increasingly violent police reactions to the American counter-culture movement as well as violent street crime. The original heroes of the 1960s called themselves "The Levellers" after the popular movement that came out of the English Civil War. The Levellers eventually evolved into "The Front Line" who derive their superpowers from pills that have side-effects as dangerous as the powers they gain.
