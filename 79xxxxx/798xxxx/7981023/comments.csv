,Hamster-X,2013-01-03T01:23Z,"Thanks again STFmaryville, this is another one I wanted to get xD

PS. If I may, I'd like to make another request, I'm looking for volumes 2 and 3 of the ""Dragonlance Legends"" trilogy (""War of the twins"" and ""Test of the twins"").

From the little information I found about this, I'm not 100% sure they ever got printed, but I'm sure you're more of an expert on this than me :P"
,thecardmonster,2013-01-03T02:20Z,This is GREAT! Thank you so much! We need more Avatar stuff.
[T],blackcanary,2013-01-03T03:13Z,"Hamster-X, Devil's Due restructured in December 2008 and they haven't published another Dragonlance comic since then."
,Hamster-X,2013-01-03T03:35Z,"Ah, so I feared. :(

While I'm nagging you with requests, this might be a similar issue (non print) as it's also by Devil's Due: ""Forgotten Realms: The Legacy"" (3 issues total, also known as ""The legend of Drizzt: Book VII"").

Although for these 3 issues I've manged to find a ton of dead links, which leads me to believe they were actually released."
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-03T04:10Z,"those were released, they were scanned by Whitewolf-DCP back in '08. looking 4 them."
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-03T06:02Z,"Hamster-X, you're in luck.  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7981632/FORGOTTEN_REALMS_-_LEGACY_01_to_03_%282008%29_%28Devil_s_Due%29_REQUEST"
,Hamster-X,2013-01-03T11:51Z,Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!! You rock! xD
,aegnoralkarin,2013-01-03T18:23Z,"Excellent! While we're looking, do you have the entire 'Beware the Superman' trilogy i.e. Black Summer, No Hero, and Supergod? I have Black Summer in paper form, but I've never read Supergod."
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-03T23:03Z,"aegnoralkarin, here's black summer http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6114988/Black_Summer_Mini_Series . will look 4 supergod, as i only have #1"
,hrmschach,2013-01-03T23:40Z,"yes, thank you!!

imho, it's the best story in the trilogy- best art too, but i have to admit i don't like ryps style too much, his panels are just too.... busy."
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-04T02:04Z,"hey thanks i don't know why i didn't search on here, must have brain flu! i'll read that 2morrow. i've been backtracking thru some ellis super-hero comics, as i haven't read his run of astonishing x-men, for example.  :-)"
