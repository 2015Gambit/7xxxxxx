Note:
-----


Three years since the release of the highly acclaimed Drift, LA-based producer Nosaj Thing returns with this latest album release, "Home".
 Not only does this album see a release on a new label, "Home" also unfolds a new chapter for the musician - this is the first time that Nosaj Thing has invited collaborative input into his work; Kazu Makino (Blonde Redhead) and Toro Y Moi provide a vocal presence over music that explores more organic tones.
 As crystalline and as brittle as Drift is in places, Home is never short of Nosaj Thing's signature, panoramic style but progresses into a new space where Drift left off.
