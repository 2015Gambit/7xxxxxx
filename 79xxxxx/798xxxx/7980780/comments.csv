,MellowYo,2013-01-03T00:37Z,This isn't Hansel and Gretel witch hunters people!!!!!!!! SOME FAKE AND GAY ONE!! FUCK YOU BOZX
,movie_maniac13,2013-01-03T01:01Z,yes...not the good movie !
,N2x,2013-01-03T01:18Z,Booboo Stewart? Is this even a real movie?
,QuakeGod,2013-01-03T03:47Z,"Come on people, all you have to do is read the title, or even better, click on the IMDB link.  Nowhere in the title of this torrent does it say ""Witch Hunters"".  There have been several movies released lately that have had someone making a similar, lower-budget version of it, such as The Hobbit and Zero Dark Thirty."
,iponk1322,2013-01-03T08:12Z,"@MellowYo you should read the title and open the imdb link before downloading. BOZX is one of the best and reliable uploader in tpb. He always uploading movies with the best picture and audio quality.. Even if the movie itself is sucks. But that is good, because he upload all movies for us to download. We just have to choose what to download."
,taistoi,2013-01-03T08:20Z,uploader is a homosexual child raping dick sucking pedophile
,Sumoki,2013-01-03T08:59Z,I think taistoi mistook his computer monitor for a mirror. 
,AsifAkheir,2013-01-03T11:13Z,"Blame The Asylum studios for this direct-to-DVD horror ""mockbuster"" directed by Anthony Ferrante.

Hansel & Gretel is a ""mockbuster"" of the upcoming Paramount/MGM film Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters directed by Tommy Wirkola and filmed in 3-D. "
,mbisdagame1,2013-01-03T11:14Z,"FUCK all of you ungrateful, illiterate, banana eating, cliff ape cunts. If you bothered to click on the IMBD link you would see that this isn't the popular Hollywood film that hasn't even hit theaters yet!

Use your brains! Without BOZX great uploads you nigsauces would have to resort to spending your child support coin on theater tickets! "

i think it's this one.. cover looks tight xD"
,sugarpuffextreme,2013-01-03T15:45Z,"This movie was never made to be seen so why bozx uploaded it makes no sense.

This movie was meant to be sold only by tricking people into thinking it is ""hansel and gretel witch hunter""

With that fact stated its makes even less sense why this is available for free here.

Just search for Hansel & Gretel: Warriors of Witchcraft on youtube to see

All you need to see"
,le__richard,2013-01-03T18:57Z,"there's always straight to dvd movies that straight up copy blockbusters. Transmorphers, Age of the Hobbits, a bunch of other ones i;ve forgotten :P. it's a laugh"
,SpikeBit,2013-01-03T22:04Z,Nothing here to see.... move along!
,Chuck.ie,2013-01-03T23:35Z,Ya'll are so fucking hilarious
,SikDuc,2013-01-04T00:27Z,"It's got Cherie Currie! It's gotta be awesome!

Cherie Currie rose to major rock stardom as the teenage lead vocalist for the now-legendary all female rock band, The Runaways, which also included Joan Jett, Lita Ford, Sandy West & Jackie Fox. Three albums with The Runaways, {The Runaways, Queens of Noise, and Live In Japan}"
,oldbreadbutt,2013-01-04T09:42Z,"to anyone complaining about which version of ""Hansel and Gretel"" this is, the imdb link is posted in the description.

if you can't complete a task as simple as clicking on a link, then do us all a favor and remove your reproductive organs."
,angelpunem,2013-01-04T19:09Z,"@oldbreadbutt, that is the funniest & truest comment so far.... LOL"
,fistanleydo,2013-01-05T01:35Z,aWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW DAMNIT! I was getting happy for a minute.
,caesar_aprilla,2013-01-05T08:51Z,are this is fake or not ?
