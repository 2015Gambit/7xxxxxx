,Capridr,2013-01-03T02:17Z,"Highlighting this as 50000 errors misleading and as misrepresentative as I have found most Christians do. The Bible is full of errors, inconsistencies, additions (never in the original scrolls). It saddens me to say that dishonest things like this is what I have come to expect by fundamentalist or radical believers who choose not to think for themselves.  The 50000 errors is the title of at Watchtower tract, but it has absolutely nothing to do with errors and inconsistencies in this so-called ""inspired"" work."
,Capridr,2013-01-03T02:19Z,"If you think this is an honest book you are either a complete fool or perfectly deceived.  The title for this download is deceitful. It is a Watchtower publication and NOT about inconsistencies in the so-called ""inerrant"" or ""inspired"" scriptures."
