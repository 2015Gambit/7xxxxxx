,Glenn_K9,2013-01-05T05:32Z,Is this cam?
,xperfectrainx,2013-01-05T06:27Z,why is everyone one uploading mkv now? so crap!!!
,BreezeTDK,2013-01-05T07:27Z,mkv isn't the future anymore...it is the now...turn down that jungle drum rock n roll music on your 8 track hi fi you little whipper snapper!

,sconlan,2013-01-05T09:30Z,Why does it matter if it's an mkv? It's just a container. Doesn't effect the quality. Codecs are more responsible for quality.
,MTLGENTLEMAN,2013-01-05T09:53Z,A word of thanks for sharing this movie. 
,tfmoffat,2013-01-05T11:08Z,thank you
,crwildman,2013-01-05T11:25Z,"@xperfectrainx your ridiculous bro.  You know nothing about file extensions, conversions, compression, or quality.  If you did.  You would see this line:

Bitrate..............: 1 553 Kbps

and then you would know what the quality is.

But you must not know very much.  Go do some reading and come back.   Typically anything over 1500 kbps is very good quality.   Anything over 1000 is still very good, very watchable quality.  Anything over 2000 is damn near perfect.  That is your lesson for today.  Hope you learned something  :)"
,topeak,2013-01-05T13:58Z,"@Scanlon

It matters if it's in MKV because a lot of players don't support that. It's a shit choice for anything other than anime, which for some reason looks better in MKV than anything else. 
Otherwise, these releases should be in AVI or MP4, both of which are supported by pretty much everything now, from game systems like Xbox and PS3, to set top boxes like Bluray players, to cheap apps like CineXplayer for the iPad and other tablets, all of which DON'T playback MKV's. 

Answer your question?"
,ganjubi,2013-01-05T15:22Z,"OMG, stop arguing, and give me some one legit info on quality."
,ecd007,2013-01-05T15:39Z,"@topeak if your player/device doesn't support mkv, then maybe you should consider upgrading rather than whining about it. And if you absolutely need it to be an .avi container, then you can always convert it yourself."
,chaletamale,2013-01-05T16:02Z,"im sorry your pirated movie wasnt accommodated well enough to your needs topeak....... 

:: facepalm ::"
,pyroarch,2013-01-05T16:02Z,"Stream to your xbox & ps3, let the streaming program re-encode it on the fly you sour pusses :p

I could care less if it was AVI, MP4, MPEG, MKV, OGG, etc... because I'm fluent in technology >:D 

Thanx for the upload!"
,Suba23,2013-01-05T17:26Z,excellent quality ....excellent movie.... so so sad
,krille470,2013-01-05T17:47Z,vlc supports .mkv file format so use that instead you freakin noobs with windows media player
,spankdaddy,2013-01-05T19:04Z,"its funny wildman even after you went over what the bitrate meant how to use it to determine the level of upload there was still someone who asked for someone to list the quality LOL. Thank you i learned something atleast, and even for a new PB member i knew enough to convert the file if i needed it to be in a different format for my player come on guys if you didnt know that then get to reading and stay out of posting if your clueless like that holy hell. I do however have a question and hoped I could get it cleared up ... could you please discuss what a DVDScr is or what exactly is a screener? I think I know just would like some clarification. Thanks for the upload any negative bs on a free upload must mean they are just friggen clueless."
,urdivine1,2013-01-05T19:18Z,"I just can't thank you enough, allowing me to see movies that will never play in this part of the U.S."
,michaelmotes,2013-01-05T19:27Z,"DVD screener is a dvd provided to emmy critics for review. ?Somehow? they are leaked to the public after the markings are removed that identify the recipient of the screener.

I love emmy season."
,firexninja,2013-01-05T19:57Z,thank you!
,Music_Is_My_Life,2013-01-05T21:41Z,"Man, I fucking enjoy the shit out of all these screeners man! I'm still waiting for Life of Pi screener though.

,michaelrwatson,2013-01-05T22:08Z,"@FooKaS, tykoon123: MKV sucks balls. You should export MP4 instead. 

And, doesn't this need SUBTITLES for the THAI parts..?"
,michaelrwatson,2013-01-05T22:10Z,"@pyroarch: you are fluent in stupidity. If the movie were encoded properly to begin with (i.e. NOT mkv), then ten million people wouldn't have to reencode it later. What a waste."

,moshster,2013-01-06T02:50Z,"@topeak

You need to do your research.  The two biggest TV manufacturers on the planet support MKV natively on all modern TV sets.  Not to mention hundreds of Bluray players also."
,moshster,2013-01-06T02:52Z,"@michaelrwatson

The other 90 million are happy with MKV"

,curvenger,2013-01-06T10:58Z,"Why are you people whining about MKV, its the best format container and also free, that is why you can play it with any linux variant. Read about GNU and see what is free and what not. "

,sconlan,2013-01-07T03:28Z,"@topeak 
I Purchased a $14 set top box 6 months ago that plays mkv and any other format I've tried from a USB stick. Aren't XBOX and PS3 like 7 or 8 years old now? Maybe get with the times. You don't go out and complain your record player doesn't play mp3's do you? Also I agree with ecd007 Pretty easy to convert it your self. Takes 20mins on a decent machine."
,michaelrwatson,2013-01-07T07:31Z,"You mean to say, ""takes 20 min on a brand new, high-end machine"". It's more like 30-60 min on a decent machine. 

Anyway, that's 30-60 min of intense hard drive usage to recompress one frickkn movie that in all likelihood is missing subtitles anyway, or out of sync, or has some other problem, so 500 million people are supposed to reencode every piece of shit they download before even watching it...... to end up with more shit. Sheesh, you're all morons."
,GreenBlount,2013-01-07T12:47Z,"@michaelrwatson
What part of stfu and gtfo you dont understand?
Btw if you are so concerned about 500mil ppl,why dont you convert the movie to whatever shitty format you like,and upload it?I tell you why:coz you are a real lazy moron.UFF EOL"

,LegoLazze,2013-01-07T19:12Z,"seems like a white-centric movie

thx for the up, but I'll pass
they are in Thailand for gods sake, and no thai people appears dead in this but there are tons of white tourists.
modern day racism I guess"
,CarlZeiss,2013-01-07T21:16Z,"@LegoLazze

Modern day racism?  As opposed to what? lol

There are many Thai people in this film.  the film happens to be about a white family who survived the tsunami."

Love MKV! :D"
,FriendlySpidey,2013-01-08T02:50Z,"Thanks!

And for the record, it takes MAYBE 10 minutes, usually less to remux an .mkv into an .mp4 file. Use XenonMKV or GotSent if MKV files are so traumatic for you. What ingrates. "

,sconlan,2013-01-09T01:49Z,"@michaelrwatson My i7 930 is about 5 years old takes 20 mins. Was high end when I bought it 5 years ago. Not really what you'd call high end anymore. But really does it really matter if it takes an hour? I think whats happening here is your not able to figure out how to re-encode so you expect others to do it for you. From your comments I can see you can't even figure out how to find subtitles, code them or re sync audio and we're the morons? Also 500 Million people don't need to re-encode this, only the minority trying to play it on outdated devices. How about you get a VGA or DVI cable, connect your PC to your TV? Problem solved."
,gayestmovieever,2013-01-10T14:59Z,"I have been downloading torrents from this site since the beginning of time and i just registered now for the first time ever for the only purpose to state that ""This is the Gayest movie in the history of all movies"" and i am not talking about the kind of gay between 2 men that suck each others dicks and ass fuck one another. Anyone that thinks anything different should punch themselves repeatedly numerous times in the face and than proceed to tie a belt or a rope around there neck and hang themselves until dead. You deserve a slow painful death, that is what you like if you like this movie, its basically the same thing you that it feels like, you must not have any kind emotion that you need to watch this shit predictable ugly boring sad ass shit movie to feel anything and addicted to feeling shitty and being a shit human being brainwashed chicken troll.. This should be in sci-fi section since there acting was so far from reality, i am sure delusional morons that think that there actions and emotions where not fake as fuck dick son and so far from any reality in the world as we know it.. now BE GONE."

Well when I hold this movie in one hand and your comment in the other, it's you comment that sinks to the bottom of the shit-pit!! You speak of us having ""no emotion"" but no emotion is better than your emotional, train-wrecked, dildo clogged ass!! Also your repressed homosexuality is blatently obvious. You are the one who wrote ""suck each others dicks and assfuck one another"" and used the word ""gayest"" to register your own user-name.
