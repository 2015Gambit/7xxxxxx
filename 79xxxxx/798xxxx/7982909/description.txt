REVIEW

There have been many Bob Dylan greatest hits compilations over the years, and no major excuse is needed for yet another one. The excuse for this particular compilation, originally released in 1997, was the prominent use of several Dylan songs in the movie "Jerry Maguire", including "Shelter from the Storm" in a (slightly) different version from the one on "Blood on the Tracks".

"The Best of Bob Dylan" (18 tracks, 76 min.) provides a chronological overview of his biggest hits and best known songs, including "Blowin' in the Wind", "Like a Rolling Stone", "Lay Lady Lay", "Knockin' on Heaven's Door", Tangled Up in Blue", and the latter day tracks "Jokerman" and "Everything is Broken". The afore-mentioned "Shelter from the Storm" closes the album. Three years later, this set would be followed by the equally excellent "Best of, Volume 2". 
The remastered sound is fabulous. Regretfully there are no detailed liner notes. 
Taken together, Volume 1 and Volume 2 of "The Best of Bob Dylan" provide a truly "Essential Bob Dylan" overview. (Customer from Amazon)
