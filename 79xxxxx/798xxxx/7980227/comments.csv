Waiting for Talaash...."
,jKlark,2013-01-02T18:41Z,Quality is a little low for my taste. Should've done a 1.4GB rip instead. Hopefully honey8ee will do the said encode.
,shizzi12345,2013-01-02T19:17Z,"Honey8ee insulting the rip. . .
Charmeleon doing great."
,dieanotherday,2013-01-03T00:26Z,"Jklark: Thanks for your suggesstion, just enjoy the free movie and buzz off.
We don't need your suggestion on others.
Charmeleon- Please ignore people like Jklark. Thanks for your great rips"

Thanx..:-)"
,kaaviyan,2013-01-03T13:38Z,"@Jklark: its just a DvDRip and u dont expect a bluray quality in it.....
Thanks Charm..."
,jKlark,2013-01-03T18:03Z,"Yeah, ignore people like me who actually comment on the quality of the release rather than posting the same ""thanks"" & ""great rip"" kind of comments on every release that the rest of the users do... Yeah whatever.

@CharmeLeon Your rips are appreciated bro, just consider increasing the bitrates when required. :)"
