This is a webrip of CNN's New Year's. It's not the best of quality but it's 552 MB worth 2 hr 25 min of fun with Kathy's shenanigans and Anderson's squirming. 

I will seed this everyday starting at 1 pm and ending at 9 pm US pacific time (4 pm to 12 am EST) for one week. Enjoy and pick up the seeding burden! Sharing is caring!
