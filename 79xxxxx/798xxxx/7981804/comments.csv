,MrPapaoso42,2013-01-03T07:07Z,@CAPTAIN7SS I was under the impression that nobody wanted this program so I kinda stopped posting. Now that I know you are interested I will try to post regularly. I have downloaded your Michael Savage programs for a while now. We can work together to spread the conservative gospel a bit. Thank you friend for all of your uploads as well.
