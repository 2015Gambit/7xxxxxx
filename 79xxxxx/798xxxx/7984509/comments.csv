,krdonnell,2013-01-04T04:21Z,Comments? Ratings?
,flyingv66,2013-01-04T06:17Z,"Excellent. A/9, V/9. Thanks!"
,e8hffff,2013-01-04T22:06Z,MKV crap.  Worse format around if you need to fix audio.
,Uhuburu,2013-01-04T22:44Z,MKV crap? If you want to edit just use MKVextract. Simple.
,ecchiless,2013-01-05T00:10Z,"e8hfffff ur so stupid man, mkv is not a format is a container, fking retard. 
And like uhuburu says is so easy to fix things with this kind of container also with mp4."

A7 
V6 (AAF - against all formats)"
,topeak,2013-01-05T03:31Z,Does this one have the same fucked up choppy frame rate as all the others?
,FRivera,2013-01-05T04:22Z,It has a very fluent video but minor watermarks. There's a sample included.
,topeak,2013-01-05T13:51Z,"Yeah but the sample on the others looked fine, but the main video was choppy. I don't mind the watermarks, but the chop chop chop video gave me a headache after ten minutes. "
,captcrikey,2013-01-07T11:55Z,Still looks as choppy as the others - the sample although not obvious does display the same traits as the others. i'm waiting.. 
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-01-08T02:57Z,this torrent has sped up the framerate so its not choppy. Check it out if you wish http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7994702/The.Hobbit.An.Unexpected.Journey.2012.DVDSCREENER.XviD-THESTiG
