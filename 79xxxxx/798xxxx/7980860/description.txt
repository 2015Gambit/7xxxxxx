Hello Seahorse! is a four member mexican band that creates the most pure indie pop nowadays 

Hello Seahorse! who call Mexio City home. I've listened to their album ...And the Jellyfish Parade several times this week already and I like it more and more each time I hear it. I highly recommend taking the time to search out this band and their music. Its the perfect soundtrack for a summer day by the pool or while you're at the beach.
