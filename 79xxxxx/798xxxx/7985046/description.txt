 Now you can rediscover American cuisine at home with the recipes in Bobby FlayΓÇÖs Bar Americain Cookbook. Start with a Kentucky 95ΓÇöa riff on a classic French cocktail but made with bourbonΓÇöand Barbecued Oysters with Black PepperΓÇôTarragon Butter. Choose from sumptuous soups and salads, including a creamy clam chowder built on a sweet potato base, and Kentucky ham and ripe figs over a bed of arugula dressed with molasses-mustard dressing. Entrees will fill your family family-style, from red snapper with a crisp skin of plantains accompanied by avocado, mango, and black beans to a host of beef steaks, spice-rubbed and accompanied by side dishes such as Brooklyn hash browns and cauliflower and goat cheese gratin.
