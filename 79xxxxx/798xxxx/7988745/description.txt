Track #7 known as FAE aka "three man sonata" is the joint work of Brahms, Robt

Schumann and his pupil Albert Dietrich.  It was never meant for publication

but rather for their private enjoyment.



Brahms was criticized by Wagner for being too OLD SCHOOL....Brahms took it in 

stride while at the same time appreciating Wagner's genius.





The great thing about chamber music digitally recorded (DDD) is that a good

quality HI FI can put you right in the auditorium.  The sound of a full 

orchestra is not nearly as realistic...at least not with my gear...froogAL
