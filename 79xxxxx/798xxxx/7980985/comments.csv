,eirini_c,2013-01-04T13:45Z,Any idea where to find English subs? Cheers!
,matdk1,2013-01-05T05:33Z,Subtitles would be nice :)
,ozky666,2013-01-05T21:31Z,"never mind, the first 2 episodes are on BBC this evening.
After the fiasco here of The Killing 3's English subtitles, I'll download direct from the BBC with get_iplayer."
,eirini_c,2013-01-05T23:03Z,I think that BBC4 currently airs the 2nd season and not the 3rd one?
,blaraka,2013-01-05T23:20Z,"yes, on bbc4 second season is bein aired. it was available (with subs!) here some time at the beginning of last year. "
,ozky666,2013-01-06T00:06Z,"BBC is showing the 3rd season.
I just watch the first 2 episodes, over 5 minutes ago."
,blaraka,2013-01-06T00:38Z,"so you watched two first episoded of the second season. i can use bbc website dude and i see that 89.000 Children and In Brussels No-One Can Hear You Scream were broadcast. These are from SECOND season. 

anyway, i put request on addic7ed but i don't really hope for subtitles... at least now. worst case scenario is probably subtitles coming along wita bbc  broadcasting third season next year:/ "
