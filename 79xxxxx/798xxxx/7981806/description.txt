Storyline: Michael Madsen (RESEVOIR DOGS, THELMA & LOUISE) appears in his first film role as Cecil Moe, an alcoholic who finally hits bottom when his family leaves him. Filled with despair, Moe decides to turn to God for help. Opening up a phone book, Moe looks up the number of a preacher, and calls him as a last resort. Torn apart by depression, addiction, and a traumatic childhood, Moe's last chance lies in this preacher, and ultimately, in his Christian faith.
