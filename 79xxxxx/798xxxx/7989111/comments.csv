My encoding scheme in the near future may change... i'm heavily considering a bump in the 5.1 audio from 192 to 256 which should only increase the size of for example THIS movie by 67MB in the worst case senario. A bump in the 2 channel from 96 to 128 would result in a 34mb worse case scenario. So increase the audio quality a smidge at the cost of an additional 100mb to the download. It's just a thought.

I will however be doing all further encodes in which a 1080p movie that is 1920x999 and below will remain 2250kbps and anything 1920x1000 and above will be encoded @ 2500kbps. Idealy though, 2750kbps would be more attuned to the increase in picture size, but that starts getting a wee bit large perhaps.

Just throwing ideas around. (I originally tuned my encoding settings for a 1920x816) Ever since avatar, i'm really leaning on the full screen 1080p movies to be encoding using the larger video bitrate to match. This is likely to be implemented first rather than the audio change."
