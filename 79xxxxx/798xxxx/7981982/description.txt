Icon Collection Pack 2013 [by InterlinkKnight] 8172 icons for Windows (ICO), no PNG files

All kinds of icon images (computers, laptops, phones, printers, brands, recycle bins, cars, sports, flashdrives, etc.) for windows (ICO), no PNG files.

Most of these icons where extracted from other collections packs (from torrent, websites, etc). The difference is that I rename most of the icons to something with more sense, and I delete the repeated icons. Some other icons are made by myself or have been collected from softwares, OS, websites, games, etc. by myself.

What's new compared to the previews version? 976 new icons (all of them HD), dozens of icons re-named for corrections, and also a few repeated icons have been deleted.

Every year I upload a new version with more icons and corrections so you can report any mistake to make the next version better.

If you have the previous pack version, I recommend replacing it for this one. It still has the same icons, although you may find that some icons were renamed compared to the previous versions.

If you like it, please comment and seed. I always enjoy reading all the comments.

Enjoy.
