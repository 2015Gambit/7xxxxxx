This is the Truefire.com course "How to play guitar in 21 days"
All videos have been converted to avi format and combined into day-by-day videos.
eg: all Day 1 videos have been merged into a single file "Day 1.avi" etc.
I have also included all of the .PDF files that were included.

Enjoy, and if you have any other TrueFire courses, or know of any other good Acoustic guitar videos, please leave comment with link.

Most beginners think that you need to know thousands of chords to play thousands of songs. NOT SO! You really only need to know a handful of chords and a few strumming patterns to play thousands of rock, folks, blues and pop songs.

The reason guitar is the most popular instrument on the planet is because it's the quickest and easiest instrument to learn how to play. You do NOT need to read music. You do NOT need to learn music theory. You do NOT need to struggle through exercises, or practice scales, or learn how to play Mary Had A Little Lamb.
