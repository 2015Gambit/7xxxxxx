Long-time friends: Davide, a successful novelist, lives with Lorenzo, who's everyone's favorite; Antonio and Angelique, married with two children; Neval, a voluble Turk, and her compliant husband; Sergio, an aging gay man; and, Roberta, beautiful, heavily into drugs. They have secrets: an affair, a business venture. Then, tragedy strikes, and the group pulls together for one of their own, who may not want their intersession. Are there limits to the power of friendship?
