Book Description
Every application developer who uses SQL Server 2012 should own this book. To start, it presents the essential SQL statements for retrieving and updating the data in a database. You have to master these to work effectively with database data in your applications. Then, it shows you how to design and create a database, because application developers often end up in the role of database designer and DBA. Next, it shows how to work with views, scripts, stored procedures, functions, triggers, cursors, transactions, locking, security, XML data, and BLOB data with FILESTREAM storage. These features allow you to create database applications that are thoroughly professional. Finally, this book shows how to use the CLR integration feature and SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), so you can use Visual Studio to code stored procedures, functions, triggers, aggregate functions, and user-defined types in C# or Visual Basic.

Who this book is for
I think itΓÇÖs fair to say that most developers donΓÇÖt know enough about SQL and the database management system theyΓÇÖre using. As one customer put it, ΓÇ£I know just enough about SQL Server to be a little bit dangerous!ΓÇ¥

ThatΓÇÖs why developers often code SQL statements that donΓÇÖt perform as efficiently as they ought to. ThatΓÇÖs why they arenΓÇÖt able to code some of the queries that they need for their applications. ThatΓÇÖs why they donΓÇÖt take advantage of all the features that SQL Server has to offer.

And thatΓÇÖs why this book should be required reading for every application programmer who uses SQL Server. Beyond that, this is the right first book for anyone who wants to become a database administrator. Of course, if you want to become a DBA, youΓÇÖll need to continue your study of SQL ServerΓÇÖs advanced features after you finish this bookΓÇªbut youΓÇÖll be well-prepared to go on.
