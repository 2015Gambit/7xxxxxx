[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-05T03:31Z,"OK, I get first comment:
.
S10E15 is a VG
S10E16 is a VG
S10E17 is a VG
.
They are all different. Everyone says there are only two.
.
Wiki, BBC and johncymru are all confused
.
possibly there is no 15 and someone slipped a previous year in here?
.
Sound unlikely - looking for a clue, anybody seen one?

[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-05T03:48Z,"S10E15 is a VG and has a clip from S10E01 with Victoria Coren (1st QI appearance)
S10E16 is a VG has a clip from S10E12 'Justice' (red coat, powdered wig)
S10E17 is a VG has a clip from S10E12 'Justice' (red coat, powdered wig)
.
So, all three are from season 10 and all are VG and all are different.
.
And officially, there are only two ...
.
Still looking for a clue, anybody seen one?

( some would say that's nothing new )!



Thanks MP4SUX"
,cancab,2013-01-05T05:54Z,"at the risk of sounding like a knob..........
its seems that the file s10e15 is VG pt 1
the file s10e16 is VG pt 2
not sure what file s10e17 is (haven't view it yet)
I thought the file posted as jolly ep15 was the same as the file posted  ep 16 VG pt1 ....just an uneducated guess?"
,cancab,2013-01-05T07:31Z,"just watch this ep.
at end of program lady annoucer states 
next week tim vine and rob brydon join the regulars could that be the final ep. (perhaps the jolly show ?)..............(s10e17)
or maybe the answer to the whole mystery is:
a BLUE WHALE called DAVE.................???????"
[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-05T23:23Z,"cancab:

a ""BLUE WHALE called DAVE"" only helps if your name is Alan.

Here are the issues:
BBC says 15 is ""Jolly"" and will air next Friday. 16 (VG1), 17 (VG2) have aired.
Wiki says 15 (VG1), 16 (VG2) have aired and 17 ""Jolly"" will air next Friday.
Both say next Friday is ""Jolly"" with Julia Zemiro, Tim Vine, Rob Brydon (15) or (17)

Nothing anywhere explains the extra VG episode.
I sometimes find myself in an alternate universe
Must have picked up 15 ""over there"".

Final discrepancy - BBC says there are 19 episodes and Wiki says there are 18.
Why did the BBC decide to air out of order?
Why did Wiki just renumber them so they are in order?

Where the heck did a third VG episode come from?
To reiterate, I've posted three completely different VG episodes from season 10.

Maybe it's the ambergris from Dave, the Blue Whale after all.

,cancab,2013-01-06T00:51Z,"just one more comment...
I noticed on this VG about 9min20sec in there is a short clip with Julia Zemiro, Tim Vine, Rob Brydon on the panel wondering why they would add clip from show that has not yet aired.....(I could easily be confused as often I am).......O K I'll go away now and say no more...:)"
[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-06T03:34Z,"And the confusion finally ends - with egg on my face, it would seem.
.
Just went back and looked for the umpteenth time and guess what? My S10E15 is the same as my S10E16. I could have sworn I'd identified
three different beginnings.
.
Mass halucination? The power of myself verbose shoots hole in reality?
.
Apologies all around, sorry for the merry chase.
.
cancab:
.
Your Zemiro/Vine/Brydon comment would indicate that it is the BBC airing shows out of order (as they actually claim). Next Friday will be the one true S10E15 that they've decided to air after the compilation that has clips from it.
.
So, Wikipedia is numbering them wrong. I'd go fix that, but I'm a bit shakey about pushing reality upon anyone at the moment.
.
cancab, your (I could easily be confused as often I am) puts you in second place behind me, at least for now.

,bomberone2001,2013-01-06T05:34Z,What does VG stand for in this context?
,cancab,2013-01-06T06:38Z,"@bomberone2001
VG=compilation episodes....aka (best of)
XL=extented repeats......aka (longer version of episode with added clips that where cut from the orginal airing....(don't quote me on this as I don't understand the use of the letters VG for the former) "
,bomberone2001,2013-01-07T06:19Z,"@cancab
Thanks.  I did some digging and it seems VG simply stands for Very Good. As in Very Good parts of the season, therefore included in the compilation."
