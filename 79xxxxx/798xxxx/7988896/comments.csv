[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-05T04:31Z,"Also: with this release we did crf 20 instead of crf 22 which is why the filesize is bigger than normal by ~100 MB. So it doesn't look *as* shitty but is still shit compared to HDTV feed.

also: we encoded this segment by segment (which is why we uploaded so fast) and then joined all the segments into 1 file so let us know if there's anything out of the normal that you spot.

Cheers!"
