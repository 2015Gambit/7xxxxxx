A journey into the past of Frank Duval, a man of great power and feared. The events lead him to meet his fate with the lives of other people. Thoughts and memories of his father and most of the facts that have counted in his career crowding his mind. His dark past, the fact of crime, has turned into the powerful and rich man and today... but the present and past merge in a series of events that lead the viewer to empathize completely with the protagonist, a man who has made "crime" his flag.
