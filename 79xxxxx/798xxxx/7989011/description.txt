Doug Baker and the Mudminers expect a record last cleanup but the jig plant clogs, gushing Doug's profit right back to the ground. John Reeves and his kids navigate towards an encouraging spot for gold but a mishap in the woods could keep them from ever finding out what's underneath the surface. Finally, Creighton Lapp and Chuck Tillian, the young founders of CCR, take one last chance to flip their season around.
