I haven't had a chance to read this yet, but since it was so much trouble to find it in the first place I've uploaded it to make it easier for anyone interested. The previous book was great, and I'm sure this will be also; please support the author if you enjoy it, the book is only $4 for the Kindle version. 

[plot]

Former combat pilot Jake Bronson believed the worst was behind him. But when a sophisticated terrorist cell shows up in his home town, he's drawn into a conflict that threatens the heart and soul of every mother in America. The bonds of love and loyalty are tested as Jake and his friends are swept into a deadly chase that takes them from the beaches of California, to the depths of the world's longest underground river, and finally to the remote jungles of the Venezuelan rain forest--where Jake discovers that it will take far more than his enhanced abilities to prevent what is coming.
