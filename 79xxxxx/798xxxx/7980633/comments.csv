[T],blackcanary,2013-01-02T22:14Z,I agree STFmaryville.  You're doing a great job uploading and seeding.  People just need a little patience. :)  I usually try to space out my uploads so ideally I have no more than 4-6 torrents with a share ratio below 10x.
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-02T22:52Z,"LOL it was my mistake to try and seed my brave and the bold set on the day b4 new comics day. big torrents are a drain. after i look back on it, i posted 16 books that came out today. that's plenty!  :-)"
