,chaletamale,2013-01-06T04:14Z,"HORRIBLY out of sync
video quality is good though"
,chaletamale,2013-01-06T07:16Z,"btw. to adjust the audio in vlc, change the sync to - -0.4 for perfect sync up

also, just finished watching. this movie is fantastic. most realistic disaster film ever made hands down. honestly this movie should win academy award for best picture, but there is no justice. theyre probably gonna give it to that horrible Lincoln movie"
