This will likely be my last Coast to Coast AM torrent.  My subscription is about to expire.  It appears that Bart_L has been uploading the monthly episodes and jmarko11 has been uploading episodes weekly.  Two years ago, I started uploading the episodes because nobody else was doing so.  Others have taken up the job.

For all episodes of Exposing PseudoAstronomy, you can go directly to the website and download it for free at http://podcast.sjrdesign.net/archives.html or on iTunes.

I highly suggest that all who listen to Coast to Coast AM try listening to Exposing PseudoAstronomy.
