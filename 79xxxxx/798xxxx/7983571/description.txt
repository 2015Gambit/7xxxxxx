Various Artists Alan Wake Soundtrack [FLAC]:


I made this music recopilation because I didn't found it original in any place.
The lossless (FLAC) sound files are extracted from some different places 
(direct downloads, CD's, torrents...) and tagged by me. I added as a extra 
the principal song of Alan Wake's American Nightmare.
