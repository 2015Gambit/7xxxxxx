,paulbonar,2013-01-05T05:45Z,Is this the same source as all the rest on The Pirate Bay? Any audio sync problems? Thanks!
,michilllie,2013-01-05T07:35Z,"Audio fine, not out of sync. Video has some strange looking subtitles and a couple of light watermarks/gray squares (very faint).  Otherwise a fine copy. Haven't watched it yet, just reviewed for quality. Thank you so much!!!"

,Spongehammer,2013-01-06T00:17Z,"HAHA this is out already on piratebay? God I love this site, and I mourn the day it gets taken down.

Okay, so on that day, are we all clear that we must topple the government when that happens?"
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-01-07T03:50Z,"^ That will never happen, its not illegal to share something you bought with friends. So they would have to outlaw watching movies with friends (or letting friends borrow movies you bought) for it to be illegal to share with people online. Its the same concept........."
