Batched together from various sources by Obscurus, 2011.


The goal of this boot was to recreate a standard set list of the late 1984 show with songs arranged in order as they were originally performed.

Tracks taken from the original 1986 EMI CD, the DVD release, and various other official (YCDTOSA CDs mostly) and unofficial sources (bootlegs) which feature songs recorded during the same 1984 tour performances.
