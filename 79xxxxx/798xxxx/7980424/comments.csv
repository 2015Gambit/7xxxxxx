I'm new to this, so please excuse my ignorance, but is this something that is in my control or can change?"
,OmniusPrime,2013-01-04T20:39Z,"If the torrent is for a file that's on your computer, then my understanding is you need to leave your torrent software and computer running long enough for at least a couple other people to have 100% of the file. You cannot of course control whether they keep their computers on long enough for others to reach 100%, but if there are a lot of people downloading this torrent then there should be enough at 100% to keep it going - after the first few get there downloading from you."
