Heavy metal superstars Korn get an industrial rock tribute on The Electro-Industrial Tribute to Korn. In actuality, there are only four bands covering the nine Korn tracks found here, plus Motor Industries try their hand at writing their own Korn-style song, entitled "Gone." Fans of the band may find this an interesting curiosity, although some might find the low number of actual songs by Korn to be a disappointment.
