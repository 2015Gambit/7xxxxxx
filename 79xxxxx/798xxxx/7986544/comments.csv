,Infenix13,2013-01-04T17:20Z,What is difference between this and normal rated movie?
,mub_arak,2013-01-04T17:55Z,"Hey guys

What does ""UNRATED"" means? and what does ""EXTENDED"" means?"
,onlyHD,2013-01-04T18:56Z,"actually the difference between unrated and rated movie is so simple. you can watch the rated version with your family but if you are dare enough to watch the unrated version with your family, then you might be kicked off from the family."
,firexninja,2013-01-04T22:16Z,thank you!
,Skram0,2013-01-05T04:38Z,"@reelook
There's no such thing as an LED TV. I hate it when the uninformed don't know any better. It's actually an LCD TV w/LED back-light. Gotta blame this on the manufacturers, it's how THEY advertize their LCD TVs."
,novrizal,2013-01-05T07:15Z,yuu r the best YIFY...Thanks a lot..

,semaho,2013-01-05T17:35Z,"@openhouse
Idiot, i doubt that even you have 55 inch LED TV looser, you even don't know how to respect an uploader that is best in all torrents sites, YIFY is best and remembered me that late secret_myth, axxo, fxg, fxm, Kingben team, you looser"

,SpibbyMcGoo,2013-01-06T04:09Z,"What kind of fucking idiot can afford a 55"" HDtv, but goes out and downloads low end rips of movies to play on it anyway?"
,6trolls,2013-01-06T06:26Z,the kind that steals a big tv.  
,caneZ607,2013-01-06T10:02Z,"@ Skram you are an idiot, i normally do not bother commenting on shit but your comment regarding LED tv's is a joke. It is the miss informed and overly retarded such as yourself that do not understand that there is such a thing as an LED tv. I own one, and i am pretty sure you do not. I can already tell you are one of those idiots who believes the screen creates the picture not the lights. Sorry to inform you that the lighting is what creates the picture. There for a tv using LED lighting to produce its picture is in fact an LED tv.  "

Has YIFY changed his audio transcoding settings?, the audio on this is excellent, a perfect 10, I didn't have to keep changing volume up & down like on previous rips. GREAT !!.

As for the tards above moaning about the movie itself, this was pretty decent, had me watching closely from beginning to end, not as bad as people said, M=8.

@openhouse tard above STFU dumb cunt, there is NO pixelation whatsoever, I have a decent desktop setup with 24"" bright led/lcd & good Harmon Kardon Soundsticks, picture quality perfect & audio perfect"
