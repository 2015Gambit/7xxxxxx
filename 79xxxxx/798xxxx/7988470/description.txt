The Ed Show; January 3, 2013.

The debt ceiling battle has begun, and so has the deception on the right.

Ed broke down the strategy to hijack our economy and how the Democrats plan to fight it with Rep. John Garamendi (D- CA).

Then, the 113th Congress was sworn-in and the circus is already in full swing. Richard Wolffe (Executive Editor, MSNBC.com, MSNBC Political Analyst), looked at today's bizarre vote for Speaker of the House and how the new Congress could crash the economy.

Plus, the Sandy relief disgrace continued. Ed talked to Brooklyn business owner Monica Byrne, who can't survive unless House Republicans act quickly.

Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy called on Washington to "get its act together" on gun laws, but Republicans are already saying "no" to new legislation. Ed dove into that issue with Katrina Vanden Heuvel (co-owner/Editor, The Nation magazine), and Jonathan Alter (MSNBC Political Analyst and Bloomberg View Columnist).

And in the BIG Finish, President Obama has called Bill O' Reilly's bluff and raised his taxes. Ed bid a fond farewell to the mayor of cable news with Michael Tomasky (Special Correspondent, The Daily Beast).
