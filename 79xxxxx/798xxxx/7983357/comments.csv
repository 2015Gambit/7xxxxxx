,Readdy,2013-01-10T02:12Z,HEY D..I think it's something I'm doing wrong bud..I loaded it up like all the rest and loads up good works and everything..but when I close my session and reopen it..all the settings go back to default..do u know of anything I'm doing wrong my friend?! Oh I didn't see a keygen either..this happens with all the ones I've trie this one..I think something may be wrong on my end.thanks again for everything dude.
,Readdy,2013-01-10T02:19Z,I just checked again to make sure..but I don't see a keygen..I did however get this one in 01/07/2013..I don't know if u put one up before this one..where can I find the keygen?
,Readdy,2013-01-10T03:31Z,Just downloaded the key file generator along with the plugins..but no other generator is in the folder..how do I use the key file thing? It's just a black box with writing..lol I'm really lost right now
[V],deepstatus,2013-01-10T13:41Z,the keyfile
[V],deepstatus,2013-01-10T13:47Z,"opps i hit the enter by mystake!!!

the keyfile generator is in KF_TB_Plugins_v2.8.4_x86 x64.rar file, extract
now double click in it... you go to see that black box like a dos command...
choose the number that correspond to REGISTRED or NFR
1 or 2 for x32
5 or 6 for x64
hit the enter!!!
Copy the keyfiles to the same directory, that means to your vst plugs folder!!

that's it!!! hope this time you made it!!!"
