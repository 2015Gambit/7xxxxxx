,PseudoPositive,2013-01-03T16:33Z,"@dwiss, the caesar quote is more in reference of money & those who trust in it. Torrents in general have little to do with money, apart from the costs involved in ISP sevices, electricity bills etc; as for the Jewish Nazi comment, Hitler himself, was part Jewish, & there was no bigger Nazi than him, but he would never give others information like this torrent gives. As for the validation for posting these torrents; did Jesus preach to the righteous alone?, no, but rather he went where the sinner was, if there was ever a justification for a torrent, this is it."
