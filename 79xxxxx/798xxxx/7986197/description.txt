Classic Steam Train Collection 
This DVD collection tells the story of many great trains including the King Edward 1st, Green Arrow, Taw Valley, Flying Scotsman, Clan Line, Black Five and Castle & Manor, beautifully capturing the sights and sounds of a bygone era. The 'Flying Scotsman' is the ultimate pictorial records of how the world's most famous express locomotive steamed triumphantly into the Millennium. Then join the drivers and fireman aboard the Great Western engines for live footplate action sequences as you've never seen before, as a team of Great Western engine-men from the days of steam are reunited with their engines.




3)  Taw Valley 
This is the story of the Southern West Country- class 34027 "Taw Valley". She was saved by a single minded Yorkshireman with a romantic streak who rescued it from the scrapyard in 1980 as a birthday gift for his wife. This DVD is a unique record of 34027 on the Orient Express in Southern England. We join the footplate crew for live action commentary of the engine at work and go behind the scenes with the men who care for the West Country Bulleid
