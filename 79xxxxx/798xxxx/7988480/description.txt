"In A Universe from Nothing, Lawrence Krauss has written a thrilling introduction to the current state of cosmologyΓÇöthe branch of science that tells us about the deep past and deeper future of everything. As it turns out, everything has a lot to do with nothingΓÇöand nothing to do with God. This is a brilliant and disarming book."-- Sam Harris, author of The Moral Landscape

"Astronomers at the beginning of the twentieth century were wondering whether there was anything beyond our Milky Way Galaxy. As Lawrence Krauss lucidly explains, astronomers living two trillion years from now, will perhaps be pondering precisely the same question! Beautifully navigating through deep intellectual waters, Krauss presents the most recent ideas on the nature of our cosmos, and of our place within it. A fascinating read."
