           Battleship Bismarck (Anatomy of the Ship)-2010kaiser
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




The Bismarck is perhaps the most famous warship in the world. The German battleship, 45,000 tons, was completed in early 1941 and went on to sink the 'Mighty Hood', pride of the Royal Navy, in one of the most celebrated naval encounters ever. After a dramatic chase around the North Atlantic involving many units of the Royal Navy, Bismarck was finally brought to the big guns of the Home Fleet on 27 May, and dispatched with gunfire and torpedoes. Before this, however, she was the most fearsome battleship in any European navy. 

The 'Anatomy of the Ship' series aims to provide the finest documentation of individual ships and ship types ever published. What makes the series unique is a complete set of superbly executed line drawings, both the conventional type of plan as well as explanatory views, with fully descriptive keys. These are supported by technical details, photos and a record of the ship's service history. Complete with an extended ship's plan on the reverse of a fold-out jacket.
