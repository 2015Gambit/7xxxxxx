Here's another lost Canadian gem from the archives.  Long out of print on a defunct indy label.  If you have any requests, feel free to pass them along...

Stats:

Plasterscene Replicas - Glow
Raining Records 1988
Vinyl Dub, 320kps mp3
Turntable - Technics 1200 MKII
Cartridge/Stylus - Shure M44-7

The album art won't upload to this page but of course, it's included in the download and each track is tagged just like you'd expect from any of my shares.

Please seed and send along your feedback!

Enjoy!
