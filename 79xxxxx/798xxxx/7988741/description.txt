                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Last time, they did Countdown. Now, Jimmy Carr, Sean Lock and Jon Richardson 
 hijack an episode of Deal or No Deal to cross swords with the Banker, which 
 could prove emotional for Jimmy who failed so miserably when he appeared on the 
 show as a contestant back in April
                                  
                                 Enjoy!
