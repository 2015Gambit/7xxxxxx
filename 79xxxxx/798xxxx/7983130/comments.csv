Now, Now... let's not get nasty shall we!

Even on a particular OS X version a game may or may now work depending on a lot of things,,, hardware set up, preferences etc... Some Wine ports work pretty well others not so well... and at that some work way better in one wrapper than another.

In my experience I find Wineskin to be the most reliable of them all and Wineskin is frequently updated... however some games that play nice in Cider don't play nice in Wineskin...and so on...

What would be good of you though would be to specify whether a Native game is PPC, UB or Intel.... Wouldn't be nice for example to download a title like DEUS EX and find that its PPC and you're on an Intel running ML...

I downloaded one of your games Kung Fu Panda and found it wouldn't launch. Luckily the terminal ownership fix sorted that out!... By the way that game is NOT native... it ยกs a re-packaged Cider port (as you will see when loading the game...) but works fine other than than those annoying cloud  and leaf hops! Bad game in that respect - if movement were controllable by the mouse much better! Reminds me of early Tomb Raider.... back to the dawn of Computing! That said the new TR is my most awaited titled in years! Only hope they will deliver in February!"

VM too before Crossover.... Wineskin and Cider way better options!"
