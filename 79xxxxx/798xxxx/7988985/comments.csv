[T],Chamchan,2013-01-06T03:57Z,sorry! when i transferred it from my library to my upload files I must have missed the last 3 volumes.  I will be deleting this and creating a new one  also i will upload a temporary one with the files 
,zippospam,2013-01-06T04:52Z,ok then I love you again now.
[T],Chamchan,2013-01-06T06:47Z,Lmao. I love being loved ;)  I only upload Manga that is complete so if this happens again just let me know.  I dont like my manga in the .rar format but tpb wont let me upload the larger collections without it.  Thats where the files got left off.
,zippospam,2013-01-07T12:05Z,"you should pack the manga in volumes, but what do I know Im not a trusted user or anything, as long as you share complete manga do it as you can, feel or what ever.
PD. still loving yo. "
[T],Chamchan,2013-01-07T20:20Z,"When I first started uploading manga, I asked what people preferred, and most said they like them unrar'ed. And since thats the easier way for me to upload them... I figured that if people like them rar'ed they can do it themsleves. :)   lol, i think back to how much work i put into collecting, cleaning, and organizing these....that was enough. haha"
