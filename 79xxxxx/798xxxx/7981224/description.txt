A brother and sister move into an old seaside house they find abandoned for many years on the English coast. Their original enchantment with the house diminishes as they hear stories of the previous owners and meet their daughter (now a young woman) who now lives as a neighbor with her grandfather. Also heard are unexplained sounds during the night. It becomes obvious that the house is haunted. The reasons for the haunting and how they relate to the daughter whom the brother is falling in love with, prove to be a complex mystery. As they are compelled to solve it, the supernatural activity at the house increases to a frightening level. 
   
  The Uninvited is one of the rare Hollywood ghost stories that does not cop out with a "logical" ending and  remains one of the spookiest "old dark house" films ever made, even after years of inundation by computer-generated special effects.
