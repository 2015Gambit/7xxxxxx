Chris Packham unpacks the strange fiction facts behind what really happened. 
Chris looks at the events that stop people in their tracks, invade the human 
world and disrupt everyday lives. He travels to a village awash with billions 
of tiny crabs, meets the residents facing an angry mob of elk and visits the 
town that woke up to an apocalyptic sky.
