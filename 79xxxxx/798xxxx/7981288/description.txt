Over the Transom: Footnotes³ is a unique 6 track collaboration with electro space core duo Mayday to the Moon.

These songs were all born out of improvised jams recorded one evening in the summer of ’11 in Montréal. The performances of those initial recordings remain the fundamental elements heard in these tracks while new instrumentation and arrangements were worked on throughout 2012.
