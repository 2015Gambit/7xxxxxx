Death Brigade is the full-length album by the American thrash metal band Avenger of Blood. It was released in 2008 by Heavy Artillery Records. 


In poor quality at 128kbps MP3 format. I had to make what I could myself from a shitty youtube video, but this is usable on most things as-is. I will work on a better [flac or better than mp3] version later.

If you don't like the sound of what I told you, then fucking wait. I put in the work needed, and I will make more and better. So go troll 4chan if thats your thing.
