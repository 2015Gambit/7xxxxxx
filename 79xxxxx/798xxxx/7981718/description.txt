HplusDigitalSeries Episodes 32 - 44

I decided to combine the episodes into a 45 minute video.

Resolution: 480W X 270H

Frame rate: 29 frames / sec

Data rate: 465kbps

Format: .mp4

Size: 193 mb

The episodes were downloaded using keepvid.

The episodes were combined using PowerDirector.

Video playback is smooth. However I noticed that you can not jump forward or 

backward through the video. So if someone feels like fixing it please do.

You can pause and play the video.

I just got tired of watching the small length episodes.
