,sfdonner,2013-01-08T07:56Z,Thanks dude. For some reason my DVR didn't record it when I set it. No idea why. Stoked to watch this show. I grew up in Colfax and know a lot of CalTrans/CHP/towtruck driver types. I taught skiing on the summit P/T for ten seasons and have hundreds of days driving up and down the freeway in gnarly weather. Good times.
