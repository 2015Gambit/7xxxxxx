,preparationh,2013-01-03T15:10Z,gonna wait for your 1080p upload
,humaidx,2013-01-03T15:30Z,I'll go with this one..Thanks YIFY!
,silentinquiry,2013-01-03T16:00Z,"Excellent. A/10 V/10 English source, no title or sub title issues. just outstanding copy, good job,"
,silentinquiry,2013-01-03T17:06Z,"However, my nero burning program rejects it outright as corrupt of containing a virus, Yet, it plays fine on my windows media player,  Go figure. Surprising for a 3 hour movie, this is only 650 mb, which probably has something to do with the problem, Converting it to dvd and its already 1.6 gb and only half way throug. Error in size density uploading I would suspect. 
D/L at your own risk"
,silentinquiry,2013-01-03T17:25Z,"Additional,
In converting to any other format, the results display and audio error and will not finish. Appears the audio in this one is not corrected.."

,biteme1011,2013-01-04T04:08Z,"Silentinquiry, how the fuck do you figure this is a 3 hour movie!? It's 1 hour and 32 mins. Are you even paying attention or are you too broke? Yify, thanks for another great upload. A-9 V-10."
,sugarpuffextreme,2013-01-04T05:36Z,"Missing info:

Video bitrate: 887 Kbps

Audio bit rate: 96 Kbps stereo aac

PQ is blurry and the film grain is completely gone because of that.

Blur is higher in frames with fast movement.

I estimate you get about twice the picture quality from a proper rip when it comes to video quality. When it comes to sound you get A LOT more considering it would be low bit rate stereo vs 1.5mbps DTS surround.

I am impressed by the video quality on this considering the small filesize though.
If I had a 17 inch random pc monitor with stereo pc speakers, bad internet and low hdd space I'd take this but now I got a 65 inch panny plasma, logitec z5500 surround, 100mbit internet and 9 tb hdd so its kind aout of the question lol."

V = 10
A = 10
M = 8
Plenty of creepy bits. Fizzled slightly at the end.

,preparationh,2013-01-04T20:52Z,"so i was gonna wait for your 1080p upload, but since you didn't upload it the same day as the 720p like you always do, i just got this one. i'm guessing there won't be a 1.5gb 1080p :(

i think this might be one of your best looking -700mb  i've seen! good job, thanks"
,FureeTutawk,2013-01-07T06:36Z,"@sugarpuffextreme  Oh big shot got the big shot equipment, why don't you just buy your movies and STF up? If you don't like small movie files download the bigger ones.. yify supplies both with nearly every movie, you don't know that?"
