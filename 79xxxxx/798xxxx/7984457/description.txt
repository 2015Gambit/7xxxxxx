Sacred Fire album by Nicholas Gunn was released Sep 27, 1994 on the Real Music label. Nicholas Gunn's THE SACRED FIRE is a provocative and introspective album. Sacred Fire songs Drawing from tribal mysticism, and a deep love for the flute, this British transplant captures life in the American Southwest like few of his contemporaries.

Selections such as "Earth Story" and "Baile Para La Luna" mimic the atmosphere and feel of the Sonoran and Mojave deserts. On these selections, Gunn uses wind sound effects, flamenco guitar riffs, and aboriginal percussion instruments to create a vivid picture of this region. The title track is clearly an allusion to Native American cosmology. This is manifested in Gunn's flute playing, which borrows specifically from the music of the Navajo and Hopi. Further, Gunn's thick keyboard layers are supported here by Indian chanting and throbbing tom-tom rhythms. In general, THE SACRED FIRE is a majestic release that invokes the spirit of the Arizona desert including the musical styles of its varied inhabitants.
