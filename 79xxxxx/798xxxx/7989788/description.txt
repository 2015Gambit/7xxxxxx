"TANK is a quarterly UK magazine, launched in 1998, covering contemporary culture, such as art, architecture, fashion, current affairs, and music. Completely unknown to most magazine readers, but with a following in the worlds of art and fashion, the magazine has acquired an idiosyncratic, distinct voice through design, critical approach to writing and eclectic style, although The Daily Telegraph has questioned if the articles are read. Tank also produces publications with advertisers such as Levis and Prada."

This is a CD that was included with one of the issues back in 2005.
