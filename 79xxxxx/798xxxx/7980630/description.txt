1996-07-27
New York, NY Third nite
Date: 96-07-27
Venue: Madison Square Garden

Recording: AUD
Quality: 8(-)
Menu: YES
Extras: None
Comments: 3-cam mix. Mostly well-shot but the picture is a bit washed-out and blurry. The editing, mainly the transition effects, is really annoying. Audio is distant and really sounds like a massive venue. It's mostly mids and highs and has plenty of audience, almost like it's added.
