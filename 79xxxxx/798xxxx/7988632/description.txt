wish I knew where "JBird"s home site is


Note:
Most are 300 - 400 mb MKV files ripped by "JBird" aka "J_Bd" (thank you JBird), 
that are as good or better than many 600 - 900 mb files of the same movies , 
including a couple I uploaded earlier.

1963 Call Me Bwana & 1972 Cancel My Reservation are from "Crash247"
1955 The Seven Little Foys is from "TvTeam" or "sceneline"

Note:
1961 Bachelor in Paradise is watchable but 1gb more then it's worth

Note:
1947 My Favorite Brunette the bottom 20% is cropped 
(probably to remove hardsubs)


20 have English subs
10 have Spanish subs
 2 have Russian subs
