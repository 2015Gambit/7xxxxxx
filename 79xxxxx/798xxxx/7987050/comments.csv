,Random-User,2013-01-06T05:59Z,"Cheers for the upload bud, I too second the other comment. WTF are good series like these hard to get?

Mind you, if DC and directors don't stop making shit up, series will die off. Not sure what I mean, last week, when they couldn't get the gear down, it was filmed in a hanger on jacks. The tag on the pin wasn't blowing around, the site window he broke out was glass (actual site window is polycarbonate) and you can also see the temp fasteners holding it in. We won't mention that when the knuckle is out, it is locked."
