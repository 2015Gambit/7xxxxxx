Reign of the Dinosaurs
Combining the talent of the world's best animators, the latest paleontological research and Hollywood style storytelling Reign of the Dinosaurs illustrates the extraordinary life of dinosaurs. If you thought Dinosaurs were just over-sized, sluggish grey reptiles then think again as this brand new series drops viewers directly into the Prehistoric era and showcases the ancient world like seen never before. Presented with sparse narration, the latest cutting-edge animation and computer generated storytelling techniques; this new series features never-before-seen intimate behaviours and puts the life of dinosaurs into a whole new light.




3)  Survival Tactics 
The world of the dinosaur is a tough and dangerous one. Remember the ferocious Velociraptors made famous by "Jurassic Park?" Watch as bigger versions of them, Utahraptors, take down larger prey by hunting in groups. It takes revolutionary adaptations to stay alive during the era of the dinosaur, and this episode exposes how different species changed to survive. See how a smaller version of the Utahraptor, the Rahonavis, used its special ability to run up trees to evade predators. In the skies, a young pterosaur -- a flying reptile -- uses flight to evade its enemy. Reign of the Dinosaur reveals the radical discovery that mammals were much more diverse at an earlier time than previously thought. You'll see the unusual Castorocauda, a beaver-like animal, and the Volaticotherium, an animal similar to a flying squirrel -- mammals who shared the earth with dinosaurs during their reign. And an orphaned Protoceratops -- a cousin to the more famous Triceratops -- finds safety in numbers when it joins up with a group to fight off predators.
