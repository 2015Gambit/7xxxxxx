My annual collection of newspaper comics I liked enough to save, with selections from about 175 strips - classics like "Garfield," "Dilbert" and "Herman" and new ones like "F Minus" and "Brewster Rockit." Also includes strips in reruns such as "Calvin and Hobbes" and "Peanuts"

The collection is divided into two archives. 2005-2011 are the same ones I uploaded in previous years, 2012 is new.
