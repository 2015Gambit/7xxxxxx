Book Description
Today, jQuery is used by more than half of the 10,000 most-visited web sites, and jQuery is one of the technologies that every web developer should master. The trouble is that jQuery is difficult to learn, especially for programming novices. Now, this new book makes it easier than ever to learn jQuery, jQuery UI (User Interface), and jQuery Mobile.

In essence, sections 2 and 3 of this book present all of the jQuery and jQuery UI skills that you need for developing professional jQuery applications. With those skills, youΓÇÖll be able to add all of the popular jQuery applications to your web pages: image swaps, image rollovers, collapsible panels, slide shows, accordions, tabs, carousels, and more. Beyond that, though, youΓÇÖll have all the skills that you need for developing unique jQuery applications of your own.

But thatΓÇÖs just two of the five sections in the book. Because you need to know JavaScript in order to use jQuery, section 1 presents the least you need to know about JavaScript to get the most from jQuery. This is essential for programming novices, but this is also valuable for experienced programmers who may not remember how a specific JavaScript statement or method works. In short, this section makes this book a complete reference for jQuery programmers.

Who this book is for
You can think of jQuery as one of the 4 technologies that every professional web developer should master, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So this book is for any web developer today. That includes:

- web developers who know HTML and CSS but are new to JavaScript and jQuery
- web developers who have done JavaScript programming but are new to jQuery
- web developers who have used jQuery for special-purpose applications, but donΓÇÖt feel comfortable with it
- web developers who program in ASP.NET, JSP, or PHP on the server side and now want to master client-side programming
- web developers who have already read 3 or 4 jQuery books but still arenΓÇÖt sure how to use jQuery in real-world applications

The only prerequisite is a basic familiarity with HTML and CSS. We donΓÇÖt expect you to code HTML and CSS, though, so we provide that code for all of the examples and exercises in the book. Then, if you ever want to learn more, please see our book, MurachΓÇÖs HTML5 and CSS3.
