The hardware you can get CHEAP at a local Radio Shack or Electronics Store. I would really appreciate it if you can look into this for me and possibly others. :D If you would like to look into it, here is the link with the details : http://www.magix.com/us/rescue-your-videotapes/detail/functions/   Thanks!"
