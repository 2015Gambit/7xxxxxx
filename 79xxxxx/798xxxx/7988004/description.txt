Information
------------------------------

On June 4, 1944, with World War II still raging across Europe, Captain Daniel Gallery and his men of the U.S. Naval Task Force 22.3 did the nearly impossible - they captured a German U-boat. It was the first enemy man-of-war captured in battle on the high seas by the U.S. Navy since 1815. 
Climb aboard the historic U-505 and relive its journey from a powerhouse of the German fleet to a display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. Witness exclusive interviews with both German and American crew members involved in the capture of the U-505. And view even rarer footage of Captain Daniel Gallery and Harold Lange, Captain of the U-505 at the time of its capture.
