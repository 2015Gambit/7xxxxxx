Happy new year rachel! ;)"
,lexalyssophobia,2013-01-05T19:52Z,You should really start doing this one month at a time...because having to go through this whole thing every time sucks.
,BDSMers,2013-01-06T09:33Z,"@lexalyssophobia 

if you look close you can see that each month IS seperate and mainly downloadable apart from the rest of the files. Look for each months updates.

Rachel as usual is doing a great job, dont forget, its free. If somebody walked up to you in the street and gave you a bag with 500 bucks in notes mixed with a few thousand bucks monopoly money you wouldnt tell them to sort it out before giving it you "

I obviously wasn't saying it to be an asshole. So you don't have to be. I know it's separate. But i meant, because the actual download is 10+ GB and counting, i think it stills takes longer than if it were just January."

""you can select specific files to download""  

in your torrent client, right click the files that you don't want to download and choose ""don't download"" or...
you can select specific files by right clicking the file on the torrent client and choose the priority to be normal or high. sigh*"
,dhod4ever,2013-01-07T15:05Z,"for some pirates who experience error when extracting the files. continue reading~

""Changes in v1.3 package and sims3pack files

Files have been recompressed to lower torrent's total size. Conversion will be done gradually over several months instead of all at once. The only change to 1.3 files is the compression algorythym of the .zip files""

Try downloading latest WinRar or 7Zip if you keep having trouble. WinRar works fine when I use it to decompress. If you still have issues try grabbing 7-Zip, between the 2 there is nothing you won't be able to decompress.
I did decompress one of these files on a computer that only had winzip to be sure nothing 
more was needed. What I think may be the case 
is a few people are experiencing some corruption issues in their downloads."
,Sunnaie,2013-01-08T00:47Z,"not sure why people are complaining about the wanting it in separate months, if you leave the folder as is without deleting anything it doesn't make you download all the files all over again, it checks the existing folder and then only downloads the new stuff, at least for me. i'm using utorrent."
,Sunnaie,2013-01-08T00:55Z,"Also i keep getting an extracting error when using winrar, i downloaded the newest version still happened but worked fine with 7zip"
,seedslikejohnny,2013-01-09T06:09Z,@Sunnaie I think most BT clients will do that if you keep the files where they were downloaded. I'm on Bitlord and it pretty much found my Dec 2012 folder and started adding to it.
,BDSMers,2013-01-09T20:19Z,"@Sunnaieyup, I use uTorrent on my seedbox and all I do is load the newest .torrent file and it just adds whatever is new

@lexalyssophobia wasnt aiming to be asshole, figured you to be another newb who couldnt be assed to read descriptions or didnt know how to part download a file as   dhod4ever   described"
,CateMarie124,2013-01-10T05:48Z,"NEED MORE SEEDERS!!!

Downloading at 2.5 kb/s :(

But cheers for the torrent rachelstoolbox"
,LordOfKobol,2013-01-11T08:05Z,"Just wondering, why this month the files smaller than last month? by about a gig, has it been compressed more or whats the deal?"
,dhod4ever,2013-01-11T10:39Z,"FACE PALM! :/ (again*)

read the description man! If you have more question, go to rachel's KAT account and ask her."
