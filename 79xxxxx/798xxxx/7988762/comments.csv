Stuck at 9.30% for three days.  "

,Namdhak,2013-01-09T01:53Z,"2 seeders onl,,,come on"
,Pruusis,2013-01-09T15:00Z,"So if it is still stuck at 9.3% i suppose that it is a fake torrent, or the uploader needs to delete these and make a new upload that works. This is just a thought more really a suggestion."
,alex3142,2013-01-09T15:22Z,I don't know why it gets stuck can anybody give me a suggestion?
,Pruusis,2013-01-09T16:29Z,"alex3142 i suppose you did not upload the torrent file correctly, why don't you just delete these and put a new one in that has to supposibly work."
,Namdhak,2013-01-10T01:20Z,"agree,,,priuus"
,TheLahnik,2013-01-10T08:12Z,"Not gunna lie, but for about 4 minutes this torrent was working. I got over 1mb/s, and now it's stuck at 11.6%
-.-
Whatever you did alex3142 PLEASE do it again!

Wait...actually, as i was writing the comment the torrent went up to over 200kb/s...and now it's back down to 1kb/s..."
