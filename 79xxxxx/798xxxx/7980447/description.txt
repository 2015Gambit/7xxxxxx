This is the last new torrent I'm posting today. I got a complaint about not seeding, which annoys me. I seed my torrents as much as my ISP allows (about 250kB/s)! But it's true that I have a lot to seed so it's spread thin right now. -- Of course, if certain assholes would seed ...! Instead they download 100% of 200 Brave & the Bold comics, then quickly hit the stop button so they don't have to upload ...!

Anyway, where the fuck did they get this cover artist? It's awful. (Not the blood, the anatomy/perspective.)  --STFmaryville
