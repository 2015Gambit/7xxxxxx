[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-02T20:21Z,"hrmschach thanks 4 the compliment. no more torrents from me today. however, i put the INCORRUPTIBLE OMNIBUS (all 30 issues) in this one:  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7955113/101_GRAPHIC_NOVEL__HARDCOVER__TRADE_PAPERBACK_-_MARVEL__DC__MORE

assuming your system allows you to get 1 book from a torrent, grab it!"
,Neek77,2013-01-02T20:38Z,"I'm bummed that some tools have to ruin it for everyone else. You are one of the most dependable people on here. If you can, when you decide to put more up, could you please put up Transformers Rage of the Dinobots #2? You rock man, fuck the haters."
,hrmschach,2013-01-02T21:14Z,"FUCK YES! saw that one but must've overlooked the incorruptible file, gonna grab it tonite, thanks a bunch!"
[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-02T21:21Z,"enjoy hrmschach, and f.y.i. i located no hero #7 and will upload it when i can. i'll link it here when i do.

neek77 thanks. i'm not angry, the commenter just wanted his comic and didn't know i'd put up 2 huge torrents this week. he/she WAS right, the one book he/she wanted was going slow. shit happens. the important thing to remember is SEED IF YOU CAN AND WHENEVER YOU CAN.  :-)"
,hrmschach,2013-01-02T23:23Z,"does your aqesomeness know no bounds???

if its on here somewhere ( dunno, a zero day bundle or something like that) , just link me to it, no need to strain your upload with another torrent.

[T],STFmaryville,2013-01-03T01:38Z,"hrmschach, i didn't find it on here. i found it via another site (that apparently this site doesn't want me to mention) and in fact it was a very old torrent that once had been on TPB. here ya go http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7981023/NO_HERO_00_to_07_%282008-2009%29_%28Avatar%29_Warren_Ellis_REQUESTED"
