,phase700b,2013-01-05T16:03Z,I looked around for House of Games. Doesn't look like there's an HD copy available yet.

@phase, yes no HD copy here nor on other torrents sites as well.

for anyone who's looking for the English subtitle for this, here's the link:

note: you have to delay the subs to 6000ms in VLC to sync it with this release."
