When Meat Loaf became unable to record the follow up to the smash hit Bat out of Hell, writer and producer Jim Steinman took to the studio to record the album anyway. Since that album, Bad for Good, Meat Loaf has recorded almost every track from it. This album is what I think Meat Loaf's Bad for Good could have been. I've included two tracks from Meat Loaf's second album, Dead Ringer, to fill in the gaps left by Dance In My Pants, and Stark Raving Love as they were never recorded by Meat Loaf. I've also spliced in Jim's spoken word intro into Left in the Dark by Meat. Hope you enjoy.
