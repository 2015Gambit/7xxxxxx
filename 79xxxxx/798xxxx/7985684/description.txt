Notes: 
This show had a good many dropouts, especially early on - these seem to be on the Masters; 'Just Kissed My Baby' had channel dropouts; 'Pigeons' had numerous droppouts and spots of diginoise; much effort was made to minimize and eliminate problems whenever possible; sonic problems aside, this show kicks so much ass, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. ~ Wade
