DESCRiPTiON

Neil Armstrong's family and friends, many of whom have never spoken publicly
before, tell the story of the first man to set foot on the moon

Drawing heavily on unbroadcast archive footage and the unique perspectives of
the contributors, this is an exclusive account of Neil Armstrong's extraordinary
life story. From his childhood during America's Great Depression to the heady
days of the space programme, his historic first step on the Moon and his
famously private later life. Seen through the eyes of those who were with him
the film explores the man behind the myth, a man who was very much a product of
his time

The filmgoes beyond his days as an astronaut and shows that his life after the
flight of Apollo 11 was, in many ways equally challenging, as Armstrong came to
terms with life outside NASA and the relentless demands of fame until his death
in August 2012

From the producers of 'In the Shadow of the Moon'. Featuring interviews with
Armstrong's first wife Janet, their two sons, Rick and Mark, Neil's brother and
sister Dean and June, his best friend Kotcho Solacoff and second wife Carol
Fellow astronauts Mike Collins, Buzz Aldrin, Charlie Duke and Dave Scott also
feature in this revealing biopic

Enjoy!
