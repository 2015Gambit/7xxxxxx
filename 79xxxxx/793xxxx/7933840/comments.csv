,Maj0ra,2012-12-20T23:07Z,Super grateful for these uploads. I hope to see you for 242+ :D Apparently someone says there's an error for 235 so I hope that can be corrected in some manner.
,SaTaNiK1,2012-12-24T05:12Z,I watched all of them and just double checked that episode and everything is perfect. It is your player or something that is messed up.
