Superman has stumbled upon a hidden laboratory he's been looking for weeks. He is startled to see that numerous data about him has been collected about him there. Superman flies up with the laboratory and places it at a lagrange point in space. Coming back to Metropolis, he finds an attempted bank heist and a new villain. They start fighting each other and it is later revealed that the villain is Metallo, a man with a heart of Kryptonite and with enough power to kill Superman.
