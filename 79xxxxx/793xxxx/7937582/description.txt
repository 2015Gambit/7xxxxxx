Note: This is a rare occasion for me to release a wrestling file. Don't expect this weekly. I MAY do Super Smackdowns, but that's about it. I rip weekly WWE/TNA for the guys over at http://www.Wrestle-Zone.net.pk though. Usually WWE Main Event and WWE Saturday Morning Slam, unless they absolutely need RAW, iMPACT!, or Smackdown. Wrestling is on too long. Three hours for RAW... Just no. But go visit my friends' site if you want weekly WWE shit.
