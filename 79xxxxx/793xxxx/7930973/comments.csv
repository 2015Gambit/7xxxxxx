,scottsasse,2012-12-17T16:05Z,"How can those Showtime fuckfaces decide they are only going to only do 1 more season and then kill off Dexter for good?? Dexter put them on the fucking map of pay television!! I do wonder what they have in the works as a replacement show. A/V=10 and a reasonably fast download too:) Many THANKS to ET and all you seeders!!! .....................and ET, when you get the chance, phone the fuck home!!!"
