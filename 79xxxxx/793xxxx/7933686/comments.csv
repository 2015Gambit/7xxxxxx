,FatBastard420,2012-12-20T23:07Z,"Thanks for the UL.  I have to agree with brutalmaster, though.  There's just no edge to the show anymore.  As someone who doesn't even own a TV, I couldn't care less about AGT.  Been a Stern fan for a very long time, but I'm frankly fairly sick of the inane sycophantic drivel that makes up much of the subject matter.  I miss Artie.  "
