Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, December 17 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex will run down the renewed efforts by anti-Second Amendment advocates in the wake of Friday's mass shooting to ban assault weapons. He'll also break down the crafty rhetoric in Obama's Sunday speech as he vowed to use "whatever power this office holds in an effort to prevent more tragedies like this," and analyze the new direction the Sandy Hook investigation has taken in labeling gunman Adam Lanza's mother a "survivalist." 

On today's show, we'll hear former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura's take on the school massacre and also get the latest updates on his TV show Conspiracy Theory.
