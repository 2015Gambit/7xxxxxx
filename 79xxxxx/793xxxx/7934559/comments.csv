,MVC78,2012-12-18T08:01Z,"Yes it's real. Unlike your spam shit, you filthy spammer! Nobody go to that website, it gives you ISP threats and feline AIDS! "
,icchhi1,2012-12-18T08:33Z,"What do you mean with 

""there is roughly 2mins missing i believe but majority is there"" ?

A/V quality anyone? :)"
,some-young-guy,2012-12-18T09:29Z,"Sample ratings

A-7 mostly clear, a lot of high end, mild background noise in the theater.

V-6.5 does not appear cropped too much.  Mild blurriness, good colors.  Comparable to late 70s porn.

Very watchable, though a DVD Screener would be tits!"
,alastargrum,2012-12-18T10:24Z,"sample from lord of the rings, its fake !!!!"
,some-young-guy,2012-12-18T15:24Z,"umm, no, the sample is from torrent in question.  

""Next time you have a thought, ... just let it go..."" Ron White"
,some-young-guy,2012-12-18T15:27Z,"And for the record, Cinavia on PS3 would never allow these titles to play through that system, so there's more evidence that your spam links are total and complete bullshit.  

Investigate and google search Cinavia to see for yourselves."
,KoRn_01,2012-12-18T17:04Z,great uploads... keep it up :) question i noticed most are uploading new material... was wondering if you could get... seven psychopaths?... it was out before pitch perfect and no one seems to have it.. if you could get would be appreciated... Thanks

,1di0t,2012-12-18T21:15Z,"Downloading at 2.2 K/bs, this is going nowhere...

Seed this up dudes."
,tremault,2012-12-18T21:26Z,"thanks for this, I really want to pay them lots of money for this but I am saving to move to another country. hopefully I can go to the cinema when I get to where I'm going and get my first paycheck. "

,pokerplayer74,2012-12-18T22:58Z,"Why do people always have to post those bad links which requires credit cards or have viruses on them - so f...... annoying. I have yet to see any such link that is legit - if if they have so good copies on these places don't you think anyone would have downloaded them already and made a working torrent of it? 

To all - don't fall for any links to other websites, its ALWAYS  a scam!

Thanks for the upload Acesn8s - looking forward to check the quality myself.

,42000,2012-12-18T23:44Z,"V: 2
A: 3.5

Goodluck filming a 48 FPS movie dudes. The 20 dollar camera you bought at walmart won't do. "
,lisafair45,2012-12-19T01:04Z,Didn't take long to download and A-7 V-6 its watchable...
,42000,2012-12-19T02:54Z,"Seriously though,

dude who said V:6 A:7 is a huge twat.. lol. The rating system isn't based on sympathetically accepting the quality of the movie due to it being a CAM. CAM has a number, and it's not 6.  "
,42000,2012-12-19T03:00Z,"And anybody who is torrenting this is a twat too. The quality sucks, and everything filmed by Peter Jackson introduces some form of new technology to the film industry. Don't short change innovation. Plus it's worth seeing in theaters. Get off your ass. "
,talia_burke,2012-12-19T05:15Z,Speed is near max for my little chug along computer. Thanks to all who are sticking around to seed!
,j2theroc,2012-12-19T08:10Z,"Camera is out of focus, a little playing around with sharpness in vlc makes it less noticeable. Audio has strange artifacts. If quality means anything to you don't bother with this torrent. A: 5 V: 5"
,philoso,2012-12-19T10:38Z,"It plays like a minute of the movie for me then stops, i tried playing in VLC and says some of the avi is missing, vlc gives option to repair but that doesnt work. Not sure whats up with it..."
,papayrus1,2012-12-19T11:20Z,@42000 seriously though dude where is your camera at and your recorded version. Is it under your other username?
,papayrus1,2012-12-19T11:23Z,seriously dude I am sure it looks great at the theater because it's not recorded from a cam so why are you here? Helping us so that we don't screw up and accidently download this?
,xaviergordon,2012-12-19T13:05Z,wow you guys are ruthless and just mean i think im to scared to read more comments 
,Dogbark,2012-12-19T15:26Z,"Wow, the spam scum squad is out in force on this one. Thanks for your god work Acesn8s! Disregard all the pond scum comments saying go to this other site to view."
,dwilly66,2012-12-20T04:59Z,"crap

,charley0,2012-12-20T09:42Z,"I have downloaded both yours and scene4all's copies, and I must say yours is the best cam, both for A and V, thank you *S"

,MrJumper,2012-12-20T16:48Z,"Ya'll seriously need to stop your Bitching, 1st of all, the Uploader has a Pink Skull next to their name....witch means that they are trusted, 2nd, they have taken the time to provide a FREE (did I mention FREE) method of us cheap or poor asses to see this without having to actually leave the house or spend the money....damn people, either go the the theater or wait for the Retail release if ya don't like the quality....."
,MrJumper,2012-12-20T16:52Z,"And to the Uploader, thanx for your time and if it's bad.....I won't bitch, I'll look for an alternate torrent..."
,shawnaldo,2012-12-20T18:53Z,"@42000, you're so fucking dumb it blows the mind.

1. Not every theatre uses the higher frame rate projectors. The Hobbit is release in 3D-HFR, regular 3D AND in regular 2D.

2. whining about other peoples ratings is pointless. Just post your opinion and STFU about what other people rate it as. Not everyone has the same shitty screen and sound system you have. Oh sorry, did I just burst your bubble? Did you just realize the world doesn't revolve around your stupid ass?

3. Go eat some arsenic."
,Tallyortoby,2012-12-21T12:03Z,"@42000 you are the twat here cuz your rating is based on comparing it to a DVD.
lisafair rated it for what it is a CAM.
You can very well give a 6-7 for a CAM. There are CAMs out there which could even be rated 10 as some take real time to get a HD Quality CAM out there.
You learn how to grade correctly you n00b.
Oh and I uploaded a few things, just so you know it"
,JakobTPB,2012-12-21T23:17Z,is this the best copy on tpb?
,fragomatic,2012-12-22T01:16Z,"A 5/10 (For a cam)
v 3.5/10 (For a cam)

I stopped watching at around 40 minutes because this masterpiece is unwatchable.

I just noticed there is another one on piratebay.se that is a 6 and v 7."
,BigBrassPair,2012-12-22T22:31Z,Anyone know why DVDrips and screeners disappeared?
[H],EverybodyLies,2012-12-23T15:20Z,"DVDrips are only available after the DVDs are commercially available or leaked.
Screeners are produced only in the awards season.

So you will have to wait a bit for both."
,BigBrassPair,2012-12-23T17:37Z,A few were here on TPB for a few moments yesterday
[H],EverybodyLies,2012-12-23T18:45Z,Those were fakes and were promptly deleted and uploaders banned.
,Rubix10,2012-12-23T20:08Z,"Much appreciation Acesn8s and entirely agreed mrjumper..Don't like it,don't watch,but always show appreciation for the effort from another.Thx again Acesn8s."
,Djcole,2012-12-24T10:04Z,"dwilly66 how can you complain when it's free?
the video is much better than a 2 it's more like
6 or 7 if you want better video download the
Spanish version that's 1.98gb it's not a 3d cam
so the video is much better. 
Thanks Acesn8s great upload"
,Bembie,2012-12-24T15:20Z,"The video looks fine, it's really better than some others. The audio is good too.
I think we all should thank the uploader for the CAM, because it was uploaded here so quickly yet with a good quality for a CAM."
,jimbob43,2012-12-24T17:26Z,Looks like a 4th grade show and tell. What a waste.
,ato080,2012-12-25T00:15Z,"For the bitches and moaners, why not just say you have no idea how to set your equalizer and ask for help?  No reason to adopt the mannerism of bottom feeders."
,dadiorick1,2012-12-27T02:54Z,Thanks for the up  A-3  v-6
,Shoobox,2012-12-28T04:59Z,"I bitch and moan, fuck it,
 i remember the good ole days when pirates put out great cam qualities at 700mb, now we have all these fckn 1-2gb cams with horrible quality compared to the ole 700mb cam size,
fuck it i watch blurry cams but why the fuck are the latest cam releases so fuckn big in size and shitty quality.
"
,Shoobox,2012-12-28T05:03Z,"Now that I'm thinking about it, bring back all the old shitty foreign movies in cam that are 3 hours long and have a music video 30 minutes long in the middle of the movie, just so I can beat my dick on the tv instead of watching a high quality porn.
 that's right.!"
,You_Muppet,2012-12-28T11:06Z,"A=4, V=5. True, it is watchable, but if you can wait for a better source, I'd wait.

I've downloaded froggie's XVID-26k and TvTeam's H262-CRYS and I couldn't tell the difference.

Thanks to Acesn8s."
,Piglet666,2012-12-28T22:19Z,"Thanks.. would never stand to watch it on a cinema.. with out being able to fastforward, or throw it away when I get bored with it!"
,.Leto.,2012-12-29T20:49Z,"totally unwatchable, don't waste your time"
,ElDigato,2012-12-31T02:55Z,quit yo bitchin it's free
