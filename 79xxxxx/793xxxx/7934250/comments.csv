[V],rr-ne,2012-12-18T04:11Z,"the words get cut off on all your torrents

there is a max of words visible on a torrent name

did you know that"
[V],rr-ne,2012-12-18T04:12Z,MORE LIVE ACTION! lol
[V],psspss,2012-12-18T05:28Z,"yeh I know title gets clipped.. which is silly really as the title here is a weebit small

the description sometimes have to reduce as well
as limited 

not sure why the stats says 0.0 still but I think it had 4 seeding when I added"
[V],psspss,2012-12-18T05:30Z,"the problem is you can enter as much as you want in the inputs for uploading but it dont give you a clue you entered too many

and off course you cant re-edit a torrent as they disabled 
not sure why.. was it buggy or being abused..

surely if your a vip edit should be given back to them as they trusted"
[V],psspss,2012-12-18T05:36Z,"im stull out of data so wont be much from me til after 21st thats if the world dont end :)
