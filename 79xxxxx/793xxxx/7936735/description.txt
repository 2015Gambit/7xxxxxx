Fourth and final film in producer George Pal's series of '50s space films, following Destination Moon, When Worlds Collide and War of the Worlds. Released in 1955, the film was a box-office flop, prompting Paramount to cancel plans for After Worlds Collide. Pal left the studio and went to work at MGM, where he produced The Time Machine and fantasies like Tom Thumb and The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm.
