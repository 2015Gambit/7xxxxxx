Wrong information.

AS_AIRBUS-X-EXTENDED_FSX_PREPA from 4Shared

You can use  ascrypt_pro.dll (3KB)
the same as  ascrypt_pro.dll from AS_AIRPORT_TOULOUSE_V100.

Cracked ^^

HAVE FUN ;)"

Marry Christmas & Happy New Year to all!"
,XperienceX,2012-12-19T20:58Z,"A little feedback about this addon...
-Spent 3 hours setting throttles, and finally found a solution from 3rd party ppl, not from Aerosoft.
-""FPS friendly"" (that's what they say) my hairy ass, I can run the NGX at 30FPS constant but with this one I was under 20 most of the time.
-Camera cycles suck.
-After completing my flight got the most unrealistic touchdown I ever had.
Advice: If you are planning to buy it don't waste your money here, save it for the FSLabs one which should be with us in a few months."

I will like to thank you for all the uploads you have made...

I have a question for you, do you know if its possible to get the NavDataPRO updates once they are released, so we can use them with this aircraft?"
[T],_SnakEye,2012-12-20T13:00Z,"No Idea about the ""NavDataPRO"".
this concerns me as well as I am subscribed to Navigraph Data.
I also found that NavDataPRO lacking many SID/STARs compared to Navigraph's AIRAC releases."
[T],_SnakEye,2012-12-20T16:16Z,"@Gab_420, why are you re posting a release that is already here in TPB?
this post is with a Crack!!

you will cause a split seeders which would eventually bring the death of both torrents.
please head over to the superbay forums (link below at the bottom of this page)
and ask them to remove your redundant torrent.
Thank You"
,jeradwtf,2012-12-20T16:32Z,"SnakEye, this would go great with some Flight Beam KHPX :D just throwing that out there."
,anymore2,2012-12-20T23:48Z,"Snake, can you post Hotfix1, will be released tomorrow?

Thank you."
[T],_SnakEye,2012-12-21T11:37Z,I sure can..
