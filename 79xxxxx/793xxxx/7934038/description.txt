I am publisher and writer of this work and am uploading to curious downloaders for free. If you want to support my art, you can buy a paperback copy of the book for US$20 and have something neat, attractive and tangible to sit on your dresser. If not, enjoy the free digital version. Either way, drop by to the sites mentioned at the end of the book and tell me what you think.

Thank you for your curiosity and enjoy. It's a hell of a ride.
