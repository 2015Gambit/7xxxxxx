,RMaynard,2012-12-19T19:09Z,Is this real? Can anyone confirm this? Kinda strange that it's from Anonymous but on the front page he has a skull. And this isn't supposed to be out for a week I think.
,RMaynard,2012-12-19T19:12Z,"And even with ""Two backup stories"", 82 megs is a bit large. Am I over thinking this one?"
[T],STFmaryville,2012-12-19T21:03Z,"RMaynard the torrent's real. amazing 700 -- which is a 100-page issue -- shipped to comic shops today with instructions not to sell until 12/26. (same thing for avenging 15.1!)

anyway info + photographs started showing up days ago, followed by the scans! as for the file size, no offense to scanbro but i don't know if he's experienced (never heard of him before this). it's completely readable though."
[T],MrDowntown,2012-12-20T01:14Z,It is legit.
,RMaynard,2012-12-20T05:18Z,Thanks!
,Oneiros42,2012-12-20T06:06Z,"Nevermind file size, Scanbro needs to learn how to SCAN.  I appreciate the effort he made, but his shit is too blurry to bother with."
,56821,2012-12-20T21:35Z,"It is NOT too blurry to read, if you think it is then you may need new bi-focals.

This scan is absolutely fine. I'm sure there will be better scans in the coming days, but this one is just fine.

Thanks for the upload!"
