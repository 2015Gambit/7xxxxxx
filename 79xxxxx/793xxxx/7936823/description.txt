The KGB has captured Western spy Mikhail Tulyev (Georgiy Zhzhonov) and strives to utilize him in their counterintelligence tactics against the West. In the meantime, a bright but naive young Soviet engineer, Vladimir Barkov (Andrei Vertogradov), is ensnared by Western intelligence agencies.

With its rose-colored depiction of Soviet society and deep Cold War paranoia, The Secret AgentΓÇÖs Destiny will be enjoyed by cultural history aficionados as well as fans of realistic spy fiction.

The second installment in the Secret Agent series: The Secret AgentΓÇÖs Blunder (1968), The Secret AgentΓÇÖs Destiny (1970), The Secret AgentΓÇÖs Return (1982), and The End of Operation ΓÇ£Secret AgentΓÇ¥ (1986). Russian president Vladimir Putin, a former KGB agent himself, has stated that his career as an intelligence officer was prompted in part by ZhzhonovΓÇÖs performance in these films.

This version is the result of efforts to improve both the video and subtitles from the low-quality Ruscico DVD. Video has been exactingly cleaned up as follows:

- Cropped windowboxing (source DVD is overcropped on the sides, unfortunately)
- Stabilized gate weave
- Removed flickering
- Removed blue tint
- Corrected levels and restored crushed blacks
- Recovered details and reduced aliasing
- Cleaned noise and banding
- (See the before / after reel and final screenshot at the link above)

Subtitles have been edited line-by-line for readability and accuracy. There are two English subtitle tracks, identical save for format:

- Default track: lower resolution IDX (VobSub) format; compatible with many standalone media players
- Secondary track: high resolution SSA format; recommended if watching on a computer
