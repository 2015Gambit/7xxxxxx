The world was as fascinated with the intoxicating music of Latin America in the '50s and '40s as it is today, and here are twenty huge hits front that era. 
From the big bands (Artie Shaw, Charlie Barnet, Jimmy Dorsey, Glenn Miller) to top solo stars (Bing, Frank, Dinah Shore, Connie Boswe11), everyone got "a touch of latin". Here also are more "authentic" hits from Carmen Miranda and Xavier Cugat; some Brits - Anne Shelton, Nat Gonella, Lew Stone, Al ╬Æ╬┐wlly; and, of course, Ethel Smith's organ tour-de-force "Tico Tico" ...but the last word must go to Bing and the Andrew Sisters with their terrific "South America, Take It Away".
