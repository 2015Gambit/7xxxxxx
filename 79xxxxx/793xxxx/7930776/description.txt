"To Cur with Love"

When a fire at the retirement home forces 
Grampa to move back in with the Simpsons, 
Homer throws out his back on moving day.
While resting at home, he gets hooked on 
the super-addictive tablet game, 
Villageville. And, in his distraction, he 
loses the family dog, Santas Little Helper. 
Everyone is angry with Homer for not seeming 
to care about the missing dog, but Grampa 
tells them the story of Homers long-lost 
childhood pup, Bongo.
