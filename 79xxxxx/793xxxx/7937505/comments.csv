,ThaWulf96,2012-12-20T01:01Z,"Thanks for the comment, it is annoying when you share a cd with so many people and noone will confirm quality...

I got the cd from itunes, because that version was up early, but I will look into gettin Flac when they sell it through their website/etc"

I will upload and link when I get."
