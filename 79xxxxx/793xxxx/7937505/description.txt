From Monstercat FB:

Monstercat 011 - Revolution Album represents our efforts to lead change in the music industry. We're throwing off the shackles and restraints that the modern industry imposes on up and coming artists.

 

Major Record Labels are still ignorant towards:

 

The power of the Internet.

The power of Electronic Dance Music.

- but most importantly

The power of Monstercat.

 

2013 is the year that we, as a family, show our true potential. We hope to lead change!  It will be the Major Labels who will be fighting to catch up.

 

Although...there is one thing that the majors will never have. Our community...our family.
