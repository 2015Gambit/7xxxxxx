We all know how it feels when our colleagues talk about us but not to us. It's frustrating, and it creates tension. When candor is missing in the workplace, employees feel like they're working in the dark. Leaders don't know what employees really think; managers are frustrated when outcomes are not what they expect; and employees often don't know where they stand performance-wise.
 
Many of us remain passive against broken, indirect communication habits, hoping that things will miraculously improve--but they won't. Not without skills and effort.
 
The people you work with can work with you, around you, or against you. How people work with you depends on the relationships you cultivate. Do your colleagues trust you? Can they speak openly to you when projects and tasks go awry?
 
Take charge of your career by taking charge of your business relationships. Make your work environment less tense and more productive by practicing direct communication. Set relationship expectations, work with people how they like to work, and give and receive regular feedback.
