The Simpsons record-annihilating 24th season starts September 30, with Bart going

at his prime. October 7, the Treehouse of Horror returns, with Springfield menaced
by a black hole, a demon from Hell, and Marge's old boyfriend Artie Ziff. As the
season continues, the stars of Portlandia, Steve Carrell, Tom Waits, and many,
many surprises help Lisa fend off a terrifying substitute teacher, the Simpsons
repel invaders from Portland and Homer prep for the end of the world - all
