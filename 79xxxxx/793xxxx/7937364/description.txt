How the worldΓÇÖs most successful companies stay relevant through constant transformation
 
 
 
For most businesses, success is fleeting. There are only two real choices: stick with the status quo until things inevitably decline, or continuously change to stay vital. But how?
 
Bestselling leadership and management guru Jason Jennings and his researchers screened 22,000 com┬¡panies around the world that had been cited as great examples of reinvention. They selected the best, verified their success, interviewed their leaders, and learned how they pursue never-ending radical change. The fresh insights they discovered became JenningsΓÇÖs ΓÇ£reinvention rulesΓÇ¥ for any business. The featured companies include:
 
ΓÇó StarbucksΓÇöwhich turned itself around by mak┬¡ing tons of small bets on new ideas. Fresher store designs, better food products, and free Wi-Fi were a few of the results.
 
ΓÇó Apollo TyresΓÇöwhich launched the Apollo Academy to train everyone and reinvented how it finds, keeps, and grows people. It went from five hundred million to two billion in annual sales in only a few years.
 
ΓÇó Arrow ElectronicsΓÇöwhich found success by solving problems that drove its customers crazy and has become a twenty-billion-dollar electronics giant by shifting its focus from selling commodities to custom tailoring solutions. 
 
ΓÇó Smithfield FoodsΓÇöwhich faced a PR crisis over the way it slaughtered animals and polluted the environment and transformed itself by hiring an environmental activist and empowering him to transform the companyΓÇÖs ethos.
 
ΓÇó The Anderson-McQueen Funeral HomeΓÇöwhich instead of lamenting the growing popularity of cre┬¡mations opened its own profitable cremation center and turned the entire industry upside down.
 
If youΓÇÖre ready to toss same old, same old out the door, The Reinventors will become your road map to successfully pursuing continuous change. It will help your company stay relevant for years to come.
