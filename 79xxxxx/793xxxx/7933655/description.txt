All the legendary re-recordings conducted by the composer of his most famous film scores in one long OOP box with 52-page booklet in PDF format

In my opinion, Masters Film MusicΓÇÖs 1989 CD box entitled Bernard Herrmann: The Concert Suites is one of the monumental achievements in the short history of digital reissues of important film scoring. A four disc set, this essential collection includes ALL the recordings Bernard Herrmann conducted in London of his OWN film music for the Decca International record label in the late 1960ΓÇÖs and early 1970ΓÇÖs (of course, Herrmann recorded, at that time, many other composersΓÇÖ work). The orchestras performing under HerrmannΓÇÖs leadership are the London Philharmonic and National Philharmonic Orchestras.

The boxed set from which this music is derived has been out of print for over 15 years and is estimated to be valued at approximately $350.00. Some of these suites have been released on various Herrmann CDΓÇÖs but here we have ALL of them, and in top quality lossless sound! I hope everyone will enjoy these recordings (nearly three hours of GREAT music), which should be part of any serious film music library. See below for links. Scoredaddy
