,SpEaKs60,2012-12-18T05:28Z,"@aloisonline ~ Sadly TvTeam give NOTHING in the way of info, re Subject, Language, AV, or anything. No slight on them but it is frustrating so I choose not to download anything from here. I'm here because I was hoping the 1 and only comment may have been the IMDB link ... "
,cujimmmy,2012-12-18T20:10Z,I too downloaded this torrent and it wil be the last time from TvTeam. no eng subs no info no good Fuck off tvteam absolutley useless uploaders. If you don't believe me then check out how many times they give any info on their torrents and how many complaints they get  except from the Fannyboys and fools that help them out with links

,res19,2012-12-19T09:52Z,"There's no subtitles because they don't yet exist. TvTeam makes available some of the rarest titles and probably uploads more than any other user. The sheer volume of work they put into this is astounding. The least you could do is highlight the name and drag it onto your Google bar, you useless, illiterate, hillbilly twat. :D"
