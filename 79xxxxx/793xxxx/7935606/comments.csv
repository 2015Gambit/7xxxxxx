I havent sussed covers on it yet, but well, if you want detail, buy the paperback its fucking spectacular, sleak and sexy... digital is...... convenient and user firendly. My  Aplogies though, its only 2 extra blank pages but its not perfect and its fucking with my head alot. i'll suss out the program and upload a prettier version. Book 2 - Utopian Circus has been completed for a while and is awaiting editing. When i finish the book im working on now, i'll edit both and put online for free. I promise at least 2-3 books free per year, if you promise to read them.

Thanks guys. Listen, visit the blog, add on facebook, keep updated on my art, let me know you are real. Kind of lonely in my head. i'll keep pumping out these stories, might be nice to see a face. 

Take Risk and Take Care,
