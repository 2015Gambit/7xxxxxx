,earth2too,2012-12-18T23:38Z,"I remember this being a low point for Marv Wolfman (in fact, shortly after Perez returned then departed NTT and they became The New Titans, it was downhill) but I love the Keving Maguire, and especially the Phil Jimenez art, so I'll give it a fresh look.

I would love to see a set of the original Teen Titans series on here, I have have no idea if they've ever been scanned, but I know other somewhat esoteric but cult-pop DC has (this huge DP vol. 1 pack being a prime example: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4155913/Doom_Patrol_v1 ).

Thanks, blackcanary!"
