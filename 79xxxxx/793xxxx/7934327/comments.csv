We need a 8 loader."
,Shadow_Nexus,2012-12-20T15:41Z,Geoffp:  There're plenty people out there still using win 7. I even still using win 98 for programming & debuging PIC. :-)
[T],murphy78,2012-12-20T16:06Z,"Yah, I wish they'd crack the algorithm on the missing datapoint already.  It's a pain in the butt trying to use legit activation workarounds."

[T],murphy78,2012-12-21T01:42Z,"degun i wouldn't recommend that for win8. that is what's called a hacktivator. That simply fools the user and stops the nagging. It does not activate windows, for a real activation method use the kmsnano. It will generate legit-style activation files (data.dat and tokens.dat).  I think when I tried the kj activation method it simply turned my system into a bluescreen of death that I couldn't log onto.  The onthreeseas hacktivator appeared to work at first, but every time you used a function that ran something through explorer.exe like rightclicking it would reset your explorer."
,light2001,2012-12-22T20:32Z,"murphy78, i have a problem! 
After activation, on keyboard of my notebook Dell, not work any buttons. Five, six, del and... on top of keyboard. before activation, buttons worked properly. i try to reinstall, but this not effect.
sorry for bad english. please help!"
[T],murphy78,2012-12-23T08:55Z,"light that is very strange.  This is not the only windows loader version out there. You could try running the app again and uninstalling, then use a different win loader version.

If nothing works you can always use the kmsnano to convert to volume license and activate."
,light2001,2012-12-23T14:51Z,"Murphy, Thank you! i will try Kmsnano for my Win 7."
