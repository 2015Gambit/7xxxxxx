Today on this live Sunday, December 16, 2012 edition, Alex Jones focuses on the coordinated moves from the gun control lobby to seize upon the tragic shooting in Connecticut in order to restrict the 2nd Amendment. Sen. Dianne Feinstein has vowed to introduce new legislation in Congress for an Assault Weapons Ban immediately when the new session begins, while a wide spectrum of media pundits and political figures are demanding gun rights be curtailed. Shockingly, social media outlets like Twitter have flooded with calls not only to target gun ownership, but to actually murder gun owners themselves.
