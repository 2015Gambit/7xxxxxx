Overview: 

Things were going well for Azra, the sheltered Royal Librarian. There were books to sort, dust, and put away, important royal documents to transcribe. All this was swept away by the deadly plague that devastated the Kingdom of Ash. The plague killed quickly, so quickly that no one has the time to bury the dead, instead they are thrown, without ceremony, into the Pit. Azra, infected with the plague, is cast into the Pit. Soon, she finds herself in the Half-Way World, the place between life and death and learns of her true power--that of being able to bring anyone into the Half-Way World with her. Now, she must traverse the Pit in the hopes of finding the cause of the plague and must fight to not only save herself but the Kingdom as well. 

Defenders Quest is a tower defense and RPG hybrid that features classic tower defense gameplay intermingled with RPG mechanics. Recruit your troops and pick the ones that best fit your needs as you ll have a wide variety to choose from: berserkers, archers, healers, mages, and many more. Upgrade their skills, items, and abilities and watch your party grow in power.
