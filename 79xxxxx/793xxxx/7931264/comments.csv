[T],blackcanary,2012-12-17T15:53Z,"riverchase, I don't have a complete collection of Team Titans #1-24 (1992-1994).  I have #1, 4-8, 10, 13, and the two annuals.  Once I find the other issues I'll upload the set."
,riverchase,2012-12-17T21:48Z,I cant thank you enough for all your hard work. I love jimenez style and would love to read any uploads of his work. Congratulations on your skull status you deserve it
[T],STFmaryville,2012-12-18T05:17Z,"blackcanary this may be a dumb comment but have you seen this torrent, i think it may have the team titans issues you are lacking: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6852509/MTCDC-NMC_47_DC_from_Te-Tn_%28joshua13"
,riverchase,2012-12-18T20:03Z,just a question this is a huge file I just want the teen titans parts . how do I screen out the rest and just get what I want
[T],blackcanary,2012-12-18T20:35Z,"STFmaryville, thanks for reminding me.  I have all of joshua13's MTCDCs, but I had them on another drive which I thought I checked, but I obviously didn't.  I'll upload these once uploading is fixed.

riverchase, to just download certain files, in uTorrent, click the Files tab, select the files you don't want to download, right-click and select ""Don't Download""."
