,michaelrwatson,2012-12-21T00:47Z,Is this cropped..? Looks like it. I'd rather have the Korean subs than a cropped image.
,Shoobox,2012-12-21T03:23Z,"@michaelrwatson 
its not cropped, has the Korean subs, 
all you have to do is dl the sample and see for yourself. not really that hard"

At 0:05 in you can see Dredd's dialogue but not the ""Rookie's"". It's cropped but not as severely as the others. Definitely watchable without destroying the scenes."
