,kolagen,2012-12-17T11:16Z,@DavidTenn not only that but it fucks up internet connection!
,Taix4,2012-12-17T18:11Z,"why would you even download this
none of youtube dllers work properly"
,korgull_x,2012-12-24T19:52Z,"Works like a charm here. Sure it installs itself on your HDD, but I think that the uploader means that it's ""portable"" because it's only one file (no extra files for crack, .nfo, serials etc. just one .exe) and that it takes almost zero time to install."
,Th3L00nYm00N,2012-12-29T16:04Z,Great job man i have downloaded this several times and each time it works perfectly without any problems  keep up the good work  and as for yall stupid bastards that diss this torrent go suck a choad  you computer illitarate assholes
,TW63684,2012-12-31T07:44Z,"Thanks Duck, seemed install clean, scanned before hand no threats, upon .exe of the file the AV did pick up two PDM.DNS Query (not sure what this is). Duck I do have a question all your torrents say portable does that mean that simple put they can be put on a flash drive and installed anywhere thanks again."
