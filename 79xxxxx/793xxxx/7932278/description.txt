Match of the Day Two 16.12.2012

Colin Murray presents highlights of the day's two Premier League matches, as Tottenham host Swansea and West Ham face West Brom at the Hawthorns. Spurs beat the Welsh club 3-1 when they met last season, on April Fool's Day, although the north Londoners' season eventually ended in disappointment as they ultimately failed to qualify for the European Champions League. That is their target once more this season under new manager Andre Villas-Boas.

The Swans, meanwhile, are enjoying life under their new boss Michael Laudrup. Both West Brom and West Ham have enjoyed a fine start to the season, rising higher than expecting in the Premier League table. Baggies boss Steve Clarke has made an impressive switch from being an assistant at various clubs to being the main man in charge, while Sam Allardyce - an experienced hand in the management game - is displaying all his old guile and craft after getting the Hammers promoted back into the top flight at the first time of asking.

Colin and guests also look back at the goals from Saturday's six matches.
