,acp2010,2012-12-22T07:08Z,can i update after installation?
,ElFlaco-77,2012-12-22T18:53Z,"Awesome! Working beautifully. Thanks Chattchitto.
@ acp2010, YES you can update but this is already the latest version.
Please note that the ""crack"" folder installs by default in ""MyDocuments"" directory. Copy ALL the files contained in this ""crack"" folder and copy/replace in the default installation directory."

,Duutte,2012-12-24T23:25Z,"Hey, not working here... I get ""you do not have a genuine product key"" I tried deleting  the ""...Wow6432NodeCLSID{64A3D41B..."" key, but still not working. Any idea why? "
,anni1994,2012-12-25T21:55Z,"ChattChitto 
Thanks but to works permanently this version needs only product key not cracks or patches. With cracks or patches works only for a few days no more.    "
,SimpleeDa,2012-12-26T22:28Z,"Duutte and all, ChattChitto does great work and is much admired but there are a few steps to solving the not genuine problem, its a little work but it will last perm, k here we go:
Uninstall the program,
find the folder and delete
C:Program Files (x86)TuneUp Utilities 2013
and open regedit.exe with adm priv (right click on regedit.exe and choose run with admin priv) granted your the administrator, find and delete mainkeys and all subkeys
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARETuneUpUtilities]
and
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeTuneUpUtilities]
SHUT OFF INTERNET AND INSTALL PROGRAMS AND CRACKS THEN DO NOT EVER UPDATE, EVER!!!!!!!!
then add the following files to be blocked by your firewall (depending on which software the methods will differ)
Integrator.exe and UpdateWizard.exe
and for added security add
127.0.0.1  secure.tune-up.com
to your host file. (google How to change host file)
Thats it, turn on internet and scan PC with the software, just remeber never ever update, try and turn it off if possible, because what happens is if it does reach home they will see your illegal license and block the program, Happy Holidays everyone. SimpleeDa"
,daveo76,2012-12-27T08:25Z,I prefer a crack option where you just click on it and it patch the program to full version. Because if I update it then replace the files with the included cracked ones then it won't work
,SimpleeDa,2012-12-30T01:30Z,"One more file needs to be blocked by firewall just found out is 
TUautoupdatecheck.exe"
,Raviraj97,2012-12-30T06:18Z,"Automated Cracking worked Smoothly...

No hiccups no tensions!!!

HATS OFF ChattChitto!!!"
,spawtpawt,2013-01-02T06:29Z,"how come i cant install this? ? it says ""the installation of this tune up product is defective. please install the tuneup product again to correct the problem (5)"" i uninstalled my 2012 to install this one. thx in advance! "
,spawtpawt,2013-01-03T13:27Z,Pls help me =(
,chume21,2013-01-04T09:16Z,Everything works flawless! What is the name of song which is playing in menu ?
,SM-003,2013-01-05T20:19Z,"@SimpleeDa @ChattChitto

I did exactly as per your instruction but still caught after 2 days. 

Now what to do? any help? "
,chalotn,2013-01-05T21:16Z,"@SimpleeDa

I did exactly what you said, including the TUautouptadecheck.exe... there must be something we are skipping, any idea? there is no way this program can keep banning us if it has no internet connection im very surprised right now."
,war76,2013-01-07T08:10Z,thanks it work's
,argotera,2013-01-07T16:29Z,"@chume21   

""tango to evora""
"
,zhaggypwnz,2013-01-08T04:13Z,"works 100%
for beginners:
-1 open the file
-2 click tuneup utilities setup
-3 when you're installing tuneup will try to automatically update, just hit cancel (you have to  be quick) 
-4 click automated cracking 1 x32 if you have 32 bits and x64 if you have 64 bits operating system"
,Sholaska18,2013-01-09T04:30Z,"So far, so good. Used the above instructions. Thanks uploader."
