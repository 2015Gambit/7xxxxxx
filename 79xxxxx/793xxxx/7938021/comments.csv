,kimmj,2012-12-19T18:57Z,thk for another awesome upload. For running this dlc do i need specific crack or is any crack version fine?
,Athazel,2012-12-19T20:31Z,"Thanks, everything works perfectly fine!"
,mgblu9,2012-12-20T06:37Z,Thx for the update didn't expect to get it soon
,T3st1fy,2012-12-20T08:11Z,kimmj - you dont need any crack once you are updated to the second skidrow update im pretty sure they are using the gamersgate version which is DRM free you only need the activator to activate the DLC because they normally have online activation
,xetios,2012-12-21T19:19Z,Thank you so much!

,monkeyman1397,2012-12-22T00:34Z,"Isn't working. I put the DLC folder in the dlc folder which is what Windows 7 keeps doing for some reason, but I know that's incorrect, so I fixed it to that the files in the DLC folder from the torrent go into the DLC folder in the installation directory. I've got the 1.08 version and used the DLC Activator several times, but whenever I use the launcher it does not show any DLC. Don't know what's up, but wouldn't recommend this torrent because I followed the instructions to the letter and it does not work. "
,Jornii,2012-12-23T00:26Z,"This works for me. And I'll tell you how.

I have the original Skidrow version of the game here: 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7025486/Crusader_Kings_II-SKIDROW

Then update this version to Skidrow's Updates 1 and then 2 found here:
#1: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7034744/Crusader_Kings_II_Update_1-SKIDROW

#2: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7041548/Crusader_Kings_II_Update_2-SKIDROW

Then, from the game launcher update the game to the most recent patch (1.08b I think)

Then, download this. Copy ALL DLC files from this and overwrite them into your existing Crusader Kings 2 DLC folder. 

Place the DLC activator that comes with this into the Crusader Kings 2 folder, and run. The game will open and load, but will crash during loading. THIS IS NORMAL. Now, run the game from the game launcher. UNCLICK ALL DLCs in the selector. Now RECLICK THEM ALL. Press Start CKII. 

The game should now run with all DLCs enabled and working. This is exactly what I did and have had no problems or bugs. All the above torrents are legit and this DLC torrent is legit. 

Thank you for uploading and seeding. I hope this helps others. If you have issues getting it to work, please uninstall the game completely and use the above torrents to install the Skidrow version and skidrow updates.

,vietanh,2012-12-24T08:39Z,"I get this work with 1.07

I try use 1.02 then update to 1.08 but my  game only appear as 1.03 so I guess may be a fail update or something. Still try run activator but the desktop just flash then nothing happen

After that I use the 1.07 update then  put the activator in and run it seem work for me after that"
,Athazel,2012-12-24T12:42Z,"@Monkeyman 
I have 1.8 version and I also have windows 7 and everything works so something is wrong with you not with the torrent."
,vietanh,2012-12-24T15:31Z,"ok I got it work for 1.08 now
it seem I made a little wrong install location when update but it work now 
the DLC appear in game and I can play
the only problem is the coat of arms of others Nations seem mess up"
