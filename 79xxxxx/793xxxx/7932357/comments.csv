It has the missing pack of KB files.
I used this version so people could try my WMC workaround if they want. Note that you use it at your own risk. There's no murphy78 customer service Chinese guy named Bob to help you.

I don't mean that I or our fellow people won't try to help, but we cannot force it to work. It either works or it doesn't. Do not upgrade to WMC if you are attached to your data. "
,jacob5800,2012-12-17T14:58Z,I tried all activation method on the pirate and none of them work for my region  but I found one on internet by jocelyne699 who register here on pirate bay and was deleted  his activator is defferent and works thanks any way for the upload
[T],murphy78,2012-12-17T16:00Z,"If it doesn't work you gotta run the convert or the fix commands, then re-run the exe."
,FRID@,2012-12-17T16:52Z,"Thx for sharing dis, i haveall the msdn version of Windows xp/vista/7/ and 8 but i want a updated version of vista, do you know where do get one updated vista ? :/ anyways thx 4 sharing murphy78. THX"
[T],murphy78,2012-12-18T00:56Z,"I don't integrate vista.  I am not sure of people who do. It's simply not popular enough to even sustain a seeder base if I were to integrate it.

Win7 is barely popular enough to sustain their own torrents.  People are really into win8 lately.

I could make an updated vista, but why? Nobody would use it."
,FRID@,2012-12-18T17:31Z,Is there a donate button :O so you can try make a vista x86 version :O?
[T],murphy78,2012-12-19T04:25Z,":P sorry frid I make absolutely nothing doing this stuff. It's just my hobby.  I tell you what. I'll make a vista version one time only, but it's going to be up to you to get it before the interest dies down and people stop seeding it.  I'm not going to seed old stuff like that forever."
[T],murphy78,2012-12-19T11:26Z,"I'm going to work on a bunch of non-English versions for Christmas.  I don't want to do multi5 etc releases though. I want to use original sources. I have original msdn rtm versions for more than half of the languages out there.  I plan on making what is called xdelta patch files in a big pack with the xdelta ui program and all of the different languages in xdelta patch format.

You will need the iso from this release if you want to get your language version."
,kavasie,2012-12-19T15:26Z,"Thanks for sharing. during install, I keep getting a message that it can't find the software license terms. Any ideas?"

,kavasie,2012-12-19T22:01Z,The Microsoft software license terms are missing and it wont let me continue installation. What can I do?
,renolds,2012-12-20T09:11Z,"Windows 8 is the most awesome operating system, i have ever seen. Hats off to Microsoft for their work.! Thanks for the upload!"
[T],murphy78,2012-12-20T23:18Z,"kavasie if you are using a usb drive you could go into the sources directory and delete the ei.cfg file. Then when asked for a product key you can use:
NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4

That's the default key and should work fine.
If you STILL have problems after all of that, it's probably your system. If you are overclocked much, you could try turning down your settings."
,radhey6,2012-12-22T14:48Z,can i update windows using windows update........
[T],murphy78,2012-12-23T08:57Z,"yes of course, I never release anything you cannot update"
[T],murphy78,2012-12-24T11:14Z,"cancel on the xdelta patches of this to other languages.  The patch files I was creating were too large to bother.  I will just release them in like 6 or 7 packs.  The prowmc flip versions only seem to have a 300meg patch, so I may release some in xdelta version for the people who have prowmc activations saved with tokens manager."
