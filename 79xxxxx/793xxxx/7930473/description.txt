From prime numbers to paraboloids, this collection of projects proves that learning mathematics can still be fun. Introducing children to the beauty and wonder of the subject through hands-on activities, this guide demonstrates how to construct a geodesic dome big enough for a person to sit in, solve the world’s hardest two-piece puzzle, pass a straight line through a curved slot, and amaze others with the mysterious Möbius strip. Emphasizing how mathematics can be encountered in daily life, this intriguing reference highlights the hidden patterns in snowflakes, soap bubbles, and even the graceful curves of the Golden Gate Bridge.
