Pure Gold For Your CD Collection!!!!

Pure Gold was a 1975 compilation album released as part of RCA's budget 'Pure Gold' series of albums.

Though at this point in his career Elvis Presley was focused more on the country music market, this compilation focuses more on earlier material than his 1970's hits.

When originally released, 'Kentucky Rain', 'Fever', 'It's Impossible', and 'In The Ghetto' were true stereo mixes while all other tracks were in 'electronically reprocessed' stereo. When this album was eventually issued on CD for the first time in the early 1990s, the 6 songs from the 50's were restored to original monaural sound.
ΓÇóThe album wasn't a strong seller when it was first released in 1975. 
ΓÇóIt was certified Gold 9/12/1977, Platinum 3/20/1988 and 2x Platinum 3/27/1992 by the R.I.A.A. 
ΓÇóThe front cover photo features Elvis from his ' Aloha from Hawaii' concert in 1973. 
ΓÇóIn Europe the album was released, with a differend cover, in RCA's ' Take-Off ' series.
