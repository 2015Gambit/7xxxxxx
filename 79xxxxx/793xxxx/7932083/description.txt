Assassin Creed III-Blackbox
Set against the backdrop of the American Revolution in the late 18th century, Assassin's Creed III
introduces a new hero, Ratohnhaketon, of Native American and English heritage. Adopting the name
Connor, he becomes the new voice for justice in the ancient war between the Assassins and
Templars. Players become an Assassin in the war for liberty against ruthless tyranny in the
most stylized and fluid combat experiences in the franchise to date. Assassin's Creed III spans
the Revolutionary War, taking gamers from the vibrant, untamed frontier to bustling colonial towns
and the intense, chaotic battlefields where George Washington's Continental Army clashed with the
imposing British Army.
