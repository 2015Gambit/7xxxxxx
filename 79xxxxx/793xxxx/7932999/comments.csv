,KernSaxton,2012-12-18T18:43Z,"Hello,
My name is Kern Saxton and I directed, co-wrote, produced and edited this film, Sushi Girl. Thank you for your interest in the movie, it seems that this and other torrents have generated quite a bit of traffic. Thank you for watching, and I hope you enjoy it. If you do like it, please consider purchasing the film at some point, either on VOD, where it can be viewed through most cable and satellite providers in North America, in theaters when it is released early next year, or on DVD and Blu-Ray (which will have 7.1 audio and a great deal of extra features) when released in February. It would certainly mean a lot to me and the cast and crew, as many of us spent over three years working on this film, most of us with little to no pay, so you could enjoy it. Independent films like Sushi Girl are heavily affected by digital torrent sites like this, and while we appreciate that you want to watch our film, it is very difficult for people like us to make a living when it is given out for free. So, if you like it and want to show your support, please purchase it legally. I would also recommend seeing the film in a theater, preferably one that will show it in 7.1 Dolby, but that's just the perfectionist in me. If you don't like it, at least have some common courtesy and don't talk or spoil the film for others, as you acquired it for free. All I ask is that you give it a fair shot, as I hope to make more films in the future for you all to enjoy. So again, if you like the film, please buy it in some form, and please encourage your friends to buy it too. That's the only way we're really going to be able to keep independent cinema alive!
Thanks!

Interesting. I didn't have much interest in this film to be honest. But after reading your comments, I'm now curious. It takes a lot of guts to come here, see your work being distributed for free, and not rage at everyone for it. I will indeed give this movie a shot.

Stay classy."
,redskies666,2012-12-19T04:47Z,don't forget to rate the movie on IMDB. for the sake of the director of this movie.
,ioulianos,2012-12-19T09:34Z,Will do. 
,ReOfLight,2012-12-19T15:23Z,"@KernSaxton

That's a good point. Fair enough, I'll wait till the DVD gets released in my part of the world."
,GinoDon,2012-12-19T22:44Z,"@KernSaxton

I have a lot of respect for you for coming here and saying that. Normally, I would imagine someone in your role to lash out if given a chance on a torrent site such as this. I love independent movies more than anything, and you can count on me to watch your movie in theaters and even purchase it. Mad respect. "
,e0je,2012-12-20T05:25Z,@KernSaxton thanks for supporting torrents and I appreciate your posting on tpb and this is the reason why I will be seeing this in the theaters..
,Trufax,2012-12-20T10:14Z,"@KernSaxton

You should leave a Bitcoin receiving address. I would much rather give money directly to the people who made the film than blood-sucking vermin like cable companies who offer your film on pay-per-view. Also, some of us live in parts of the world where we have no other way to pay you. "
,qaz000,2012-12-20T15:42Z,"Boss Kern

Thank you for your support!"

Thanks! We currently have plans to release in Australia. I may even be making a trip there early next year to attend the Gold Coast Film Festival and Supanova. "
