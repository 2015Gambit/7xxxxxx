My current system of training is primarily a streamlined, integrated system of karate and boxing training and skills, aerobic endurance training, body weight training for strength, and athletic skill work. Integrating gymnastics and parkour work would certainly round out the latter two areas, and improve physical ability for martial arts. All in all, it will assist my goal of creating a complete methodology for training freedom of movement and personal self expression.
