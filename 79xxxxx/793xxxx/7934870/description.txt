SRSLY PHENOMENAL:  
AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE  
APPEAL OF LOLCATS

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  
 
LOLCats wouldnΓÇÖt be what they are without a ton of people contributing their time, creativity, 
and enthusiasm. The same goes for this paper, and IΓÇÖd like to acknowledge a few individuals 
specifically.  
First, I want to thank the 36 insightful, articulate, funny, and generous participants in my focus 
groups. You guys make me want to do focus group research for ever.   
Second, IΓÇÖd like to thank Dr. Powell for her guidance and patience, and Drs. Banaji, Helsper, 
and Livingstone for their insight.  
Third, IΓÇÖd like to thank Cole Stryker for sending me his unpublished work and giving me the 
proud distinction of being the first person to cite what will likely be a staple of Internet culture 
literature.  
Fourth, IΓÇÖd like to thank BC, LG, LM, AS, and JT for helping to make this year one of the most 
fulfilling of my life, and for supporting me when times were tough. The Bear loves you. 
Fifth, IΓÇÖd like to thank my Dad for his love, support, and Facebook messages.  
Finally, I need to thank DB, without whom this dissertation would not have happened. Thank 
you for calming me down, pumping me up, keeping me grounded, and inspiring me to new 
heights. I am so grateful for you, my Gallant Sir.  Smoosh.
