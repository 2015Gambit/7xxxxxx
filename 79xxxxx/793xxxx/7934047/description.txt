Rich with Cold War themes and Soviet cultural references, The Secret Agent’s Blunder will be enjoyed by fans of realistic espionage drama (cf. le Carré) and Sovietophiles alike.

The first installment in the Secret Agent series: The Secret Agent’s Blunder (1968), The Secret Agent’s Destiny (1970), The Secret Agent’s Return (1982), and The End of Operation “Secret Agent” (1986). Russian president Vladimir Putin, a former KGB agent himself, has stated that his career as an intelligence officer was prompted in part by Zhzhonov’s performance in these films.

This version is the result of efforts to improve both the video and subtitles from the low-quality Ruscico DVD. Video has been exactingly cleaned up as follows:

- Cropped windowboxing (source DVD is overcropped on the sides, unfortunately)
- Stabilized gate weave
- Removed flickering
- Removed chroma noise (rainbowing and yellow tinting)
- Corrected / balanced levels
- Recovered details and reduced aliasing
- Cleaned noise and banding
- (See the before / after reel and bottommost screenshot below)

Subtitles have been edited line-by-line for readability and accuracy. There are two English subtitle tracks, identical save for format:

- Default track: lower resolution IDX (VobSub) format; compatible with many standalone media players
- Secondary track: high resolution SSA format; recommended if watching on a computer
