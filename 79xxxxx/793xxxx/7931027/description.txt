PVS-Studio

PVS-Studio is a static analyzer that detects errors in source code of C/C++/C++11 applications. There are sets of rules included into PVS-Studio:
1. General-purpose diagnosis
2. Detection of possible optimizations
3. Diagnosis of 64-bit errors (Viva64)
4. Diagnosis of parallel errors (VivaMP)
To learn more about each type of diagnosis, visit the corresponding pages. The PVS-Studio tool is intended for developers of contemporary applications and it integrates into the Visual Studio 2012, 2010, 2008, 2005 environment providing the programmer with a convenient user interface to analyze files, navigate through code and get reference information. You do not need to study documentation and settings preliminarily to work with the analyzer. The analyzer is ready to work right after it is installed.
The methodology of static code analysis we employ has significant advantages over other types of analysis since it allows you to cover the whole program code. The procedure of code check cannot damage the code itself in any way. The analysis process is completely controlled by person and it is the programmer who decides if it needs modification.
