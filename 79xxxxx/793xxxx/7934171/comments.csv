,tricky10601,2012-12-30T16:55Z,can you watch VLC or .mkv on a regular dvd player?  thanks!
,num1337,2012-12-31T16:20Z,"VLC is a program to launch mkv. files. 

mkv it's type of file, so if You want to watch it on regular dvd player You have to convert mkv to other type of file, probably avi/divx will be ok on normal dvd player."
,tstpnwn,2013-01-07T07:31Z,"VLC is just one of numerous programs that can read MKV files.
MKV is just a container, like AVI.
I guess, that it would be codec x264, cause it's most common source.
Subtitles included? If so, in which language?
Tough thanks for torrent, so that I don't have to crawl for more and more torrents."
