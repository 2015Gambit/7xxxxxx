Thanks a lot"
,Hoirc88,2012-12-17T05:31Z,Thx!
,JKincaid,2012-12-17T06:52Z,"**spoiler free** An excellent end to a great season, a hell of a lot better and exciting than Season 6 that's for sure. And for those wondering - They have already said that the next season (8) will be the last one. 

Also, I would not recommend looking much further down in comments - Lots of assholes around this time try to spoil the ending for whatever fucked up reason. All you need to know is this: A10, V10"
