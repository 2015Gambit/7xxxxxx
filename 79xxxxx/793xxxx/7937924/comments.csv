WTF is wrong with you lately?  This only started happening in the past few weeks.  Go back to the old software or old way of doing it, please.  "
,sahilrox,2012-12-20T09:39Z,"@dididie Why the fuck don't you watch it on tv than here? What's wrong with you....If you download it, Watch once and delete....Who stores SD with them?"
,dididie,2012-12-20T19:47Z,I don't watch because there's only about 3 talents I still like and WWE's creative and booking has been doing the same thing with most of them for 3 years.  I only watch about 20 minutes of the show and skip around.  I don't want to contribute to their rating system until they start doing a better show.  Same thing with raw.  I only watch TNA on tv but they're starting to do the same shit.
,dididie,2012-12-20T19:48Z,Let me know when you're done with that chapter of the book you're writing about me.  I'll help you with the others.
,sahilrox,2012-12-21T04:57Z,"Well, i agree on one thing atleast with you....Even i skip and fast forward stuff i know will happen and does happen....I only watch about 15mins...skip most mid-card matches they are trash.

As far as TNA goes, it was good earlier but with all this Aces and Eights shit its bad...

Maybe time to shift permanently to UFC....lol

But my point was scene never messes up his videos, it could be because of the source encode by KYR....I don't even think it is as good as RUDOS/NWCHD/Freak or others.... :)"
