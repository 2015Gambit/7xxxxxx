*** THE PRANKSTER ***
If you're a little brother who wants to tease his sister, or a father who wants to play with his children, or all just a troll who just wants to do his work, then this application is for you!
The Prankster is an IT project composed of a client application (on Android) and a server program (on Windows).
The client application (The Prankster) can send pranks to the server.
The server program (The Prankster Server) can run pranks received from the client.
The Prankster and The Prankster Server must be in the same Lan (wireless or cable), that is to say connected to the same modem.
