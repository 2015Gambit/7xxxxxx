Classic Diamonds - The DVD is a DVD video album by hard rock singer Doro Pesch, released in 2004 by AFM Records. The DVD contains footage from two concerts held during the European tour which followed the release of the studio album Classic Diamonds. The album was a special project for Doro Pesch, who revised and re-arranged some of her songs for the Classic Night Orchestra, a 30-elements symphonic orchestra. A smaller ensemble of the orchestra accompanied Doro and her usual touring musicians on tour, but the full orchestra was on stage in August 2004 at Wacken Open Air for a strictly acoustic set, an unusual performance for the largest European heavy metal festival. Special guests of the night were former-Iron Maiden singer Blaze Bayley and guitarist Chris Caffery (Savatage, Trans-Siberian Orchestra).

As an extra, the DVD features also a concert held in Cologne, Germany, where Doro performed her usual heavy metal repertoire and which the German TV show Rockpalast broadcasted on 17 October 2004.
