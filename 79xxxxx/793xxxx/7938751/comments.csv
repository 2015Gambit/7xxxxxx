,dotheratchet,2012-12-26T19:42Z,i commented earlier about the audio being broken... the reason some people say 10-10 and others disagree is because for some reason this file only works on windows and not on mac. Luckily i have both and figured it out this file also cannot be run through handbrake on either OS. extremezone you are still the BEST! I just thought everyone should know.
,casperskates,2012-12-28T00:59Z,"Thanx for your uploads extremezone.
