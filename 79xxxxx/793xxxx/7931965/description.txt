fifth floor ep
this will take fourteen minutes of your life

these tunes are from the fifth floor

beyond lo-fi

short-circuiting "discourse" since 10 november 2011
when 30 000 students marched in montreal for free education
and there was an occupation of the principal of mcgill university's office
and students swarmed to support and were smashed back by pigs

everything you have heard about our love is true 

originally released 27 november 2011
tracks remastered and rereleased on 17 december 2012
mastered at the hippy shack on 16 december 2012
with special thanks to: 
life, marijuana, alcohol, nicotine

original first take of this anarchojam is available at
with riot porn from 10 november 2012
after militarized pigs entered mcgill university
with stunning and glorious high-definition footage
