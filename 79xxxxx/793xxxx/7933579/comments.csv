,raindr0ps,2012-12-18T02:30Z,Why would I want to D/L over a gig of a file without knowing what is in it?? Why RAR. You don't really save that much download time and maybe I don't want everything here. All you do with and archive file is hide the contents. WHY??
,pharmakate,2012-12-18T04:20Z,Almost certainly fake -- seeder has never uploaded anything else. Don't waste your time or bandwidth.
,raindr0ps,2012-12-19T00:12Z,It has been 24 hours and still only one seeder?? Wish one of those leechers would post a comment on how much they have downloaded so far. I wouldn't be surprised if it was zero percent!
