Overview: 

An ambitious re-imagining of the Puzzle/Maze genre.


Cognitile throws you, a budding adventurer on a tile-based journey! Use the power of Cog Vision to watch the sequence of hazards at the beginning of a level and then carve a safe path through the mayhem by memory to find the hidden treasure. Make one mistake and you could fall down a crumbling tile, find yourself poisoned or engulfed in flames, get crushed by a boulder or attacked by snakes (why'd it have to be snakes!).
The game doesn't end when you've solved the 60 official levels. Enter the Workshop to build your own levels and play levels that other community members have shared. Our powerful and easy to use level builder puts the very same tools our developers used to make the official levels in your hands.
Hardware Notice:
We can only recommend playing Cognitile on modern Android devices that can typically play new games well. If your device is older you may notice framerate drops or crashing on boot-up. One of our top priorities moving forward is extending compatibility to legacy devices as best as possible.
