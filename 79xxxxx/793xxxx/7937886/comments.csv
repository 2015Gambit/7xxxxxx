Collected from all over the web, edited for name consistency, duplicate pruning, extensively and lovingly photoshopped: cropped, straightened, luminosity, black and white levels, contrast and so on. Although I've put in many long days of work for this, none is my own scan so it is fitting to offer my thanks to the original uploaders, no matter how bad their scanning skills, because without them there wouldn't be any material to begin with. 
All the files are loose (no rars) so that you can pick and choose what you like. If what you already have is not of good quality, chances are that I have repaired it, so give it a try (if it's .jpgs, download only one to check). 
My socks folder was big (more than 1000 files), so TPB wouldn't let me upload it, and I had to split it into 4 different torrents. "
