,dokkyonai,2012-12-18T22:37Z,"Someone tell me why in the hell people don't record in HD. My damn phone can record up to 1080p. Store the video on an SDHC card and record the audio with a separate audio recorder, then mux them together. There is no reason for shitty cams anymore."
,pettard1,2012-12-18T23:46Z,"You should wait for a better release! This movie is worth paying the money to see! Wait for a better copy or wait for blu-ray!

My adwise!"
,jayrockskee,2012-12-19T00:00Z,"@ dokkyonai

Why don't you fucking do it dipshit? Everyone always wants everyone else to do something for them. If you have an idea then manifest it into something actual. How else can you EXPECT something? Just wish upon a star and bitch about it when you don't get your way. You're a crybaby."
,dokkyonai,2012-12-19T00:56Z,"@jayrockskee

Your ad hominems have no effect on me. Try answering the concern next time, fraggot."
,CrankyAVM,2012-12-19T03:07Z,"Saw this in the theater at 48 fps. Blew me away. The first hour or so is really all it took me to get used to it (it will seem like people are moving too fast at first) but then it was fantastic. People, this is one movie (and Peter Jackson is one man) worth giving your money to. Even if you don't have a local theater showing it with the new frame rate technology, see it at least in IMAX or IMAX 3D. By paying for this one you're sending a message to other directors and producers that 48 fps is worth investing in.

..can't remember the last time I ever endorsed paying for a movie...still, there's a first for everything. I'm sure desolation of smaug will be the second"
,supNegga,2012-12-19T10:57Z,hey fuck u and ur bullshit (gay) hobbit links yall Trolls posting...im on the Bay 2 get vids..not ur gay ass websites..

,jallen8482,2012-12-21T11:08Z,Thanks for the upload as always. And those of you that rated this higher than a 4 on picture quality need your eyes checked. Its terrible quality. Out of focus 90% of the time and the camera is even crooked. I will wait for a better copy or if its still in theaters next Friday when i get paid i will go watch it there. I still appreciate the upload and effort.
,pjatgv,2012-12-22T01:46Z,"to all you fuckers hammering bullshit about dokkyonai like little monkeys bouncing on the tree just chill the fuck up... you're just little sheep that follow the first one that screamed: ""WOLF!!!!"" mother dumb sensationalist psycological predator fuckers

he's just sugesting to the ACTUAL PEOPLE THAT LIKE TO GO TO CINEMAS AND REC MOVIES THAT NOWADAYS IT'S EASY TO RECORD CAM VER. WITH QUALITY.... 

I've seen Cam uploads these days almost with the same quality as dvdrips, R5s, u name it. i rarelly dl cams only the ones worth my time. I'm not complaining about the upload but you fuckers once you smell blood you jump on a person like stray dogs fucking animals"

,Yamcha67,2012-12-22T16:40Z,"I don't even know why people are arguing over this torrent.

First of all the uploader has provided screenshots, If your not happy with the quality don't download it.

I'm personally waiting for R5 release.. The Hobbit is an awesome movie, and It's worth spending $10.00 to watch it on the cinema If your that impatient.."
