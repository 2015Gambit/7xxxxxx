Brazil, 1943. Three brothers set out into the feral center of the country seeking adventure. Armed with an insatiable curiosity, they befriend a village of Xingu Indians, and together they build an airstrip to bring modernity to this ancient place. But after a flu epidemic wipes out half the village, the brothers' naïveté turns into a decades-long fight to protect the Xingu from the disastrous side effects of progress. 

This triumphant epic film traces the real-life saga of the Villas-Boas brothers as they stand up to corrupt governments and their own inner struggles. With wild, breathtaking visuals and eerie, rich sound design, TFF alum Cao Hamburger conveys a distinct vision of Brazil while finding a universally resonant message in his protagonists' revolutionary vision. Felipe Carmago, João Miguel and Caio Blat (as Orlando, Cláudio, and Leonardo Villas-Boas) craft characters whose unique struggles combine to make a powerful narrative. Xingu tells an inspiring story of human rights and environmental activism that remains as controversial and relevant today as it was 60 years ago.
