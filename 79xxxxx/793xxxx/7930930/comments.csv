 There is NO we, you fucking spammer!  Some people are looking for this film, and its labled correctly! So don't you fucking dare come on here, with even the slightest hint of negativity toward the uploader, saying we anything! Your a leach, and the real WE do not want you fucking spammers on here!  WE are not falling for your bullshit website!  So why don't YOU go fuck yourself!  

BTW, thanks to the uploader for this, because I actually was looking for this film.  I had read the same thing about the court order and it made me curious. So thanks very much."
