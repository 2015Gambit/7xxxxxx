PLOT: 

A man has everything: dozens of servants, a palace, vast woods, gardens, a lake, mechanical toys, private entertainment troupes of musicians and dancers. He has it all - but love. When alone, he sits at a desk, sighing, and looking at a photograph of a pretty girl. One day, the circus descended onto his palace, and amidst all the fun it brought, he recognized the Amazon on the white horse - the girl in the photograph. The girl is now the mother of a small boy, Yo-Yo, whom she considers that looks like the millionaire, even under a clown's make-up. The boy will spend some time in the palace, in awe of so much riches, but he will leave (in a dream-like scene) on the tusks of the elephant. Time passes - and one day Yo-Yo will be the owner of his father's palace in decay. Starting from scratch, he will rebuilt it, and be praised as a great clown, an artist, a film-maker, a millionaire. Yet, something is amiss...

“A master of screen comedy! He is every bit as worthy of praise and study as Tati, yet he is all but unknown today.” –Leonard Maltin
 
"Étaix is a revelation: hilarious, subversive, deadpan. You can see in his work the seeds of everything we've laughed at during the last sixty plus years." –Ken Burns
 
“Twice in my life I understood what genius was. The first time was looking at the definition in the dictionary. The second was encountering Pierre Étaix.”  -Jerry Lewis
