Allison Blaire (aka The Dazzler) is an ally of the X-Men with the mutant power to transform sound into light, which she uses to create a spectacular stage show to accompany her singing performances. This soap-opera-esque graphic novel follows her ill-fated romance with Hollywood celebrity Roman Nekoboh, a co-star in her first movie, and his public outing of her as a mutant--those who are born with special powers or abilities which cause them to be societal pariahs.

This story takes place between Dazzler #34 and #35.
