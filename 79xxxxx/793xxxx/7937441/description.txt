6teen is focused on the common problems related to teenagers. The characters, Nikki, Jonesy, Jen, Jude, Wyatt, and Caitlin deal with first crushes, first jobs, first bank accounts and a sweet taste of freedom. Nikki finds herself stuck working at The Khaki Barn, a store that she wouldn't be caught dead shopping in, while Jen has found her dream job at a sports shop, but makes some mistakes. Jonesy manages to get fired from a new store in every single episode, Wyatt's hopelessly in love with his older co-worker, and Caitlin endures the daily humiliation of working in the lowest store in the mall's hierarchy of cool ΓÇô The Big Squeeze, a giant lemon.
