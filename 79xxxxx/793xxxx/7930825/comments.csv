Unfortunately the stream (both FOX and Canadian affiliates) were preempted less than 10 minutes in for the presidentâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s memorial address.

What happens sucks hard, but they really could have waited a mere 20 minutes to do the address during reruns. No sense in piling more bad on bad if it can be avoided."
