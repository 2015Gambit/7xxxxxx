Lifetime-Merry In-Laws (2012)

Air Date: 15 Dec 2012

Summary: Alex’s fiancé Peter is a little nervous when his parents decide to stay for a pre-Christmas visit, but their eccentric, charming ways soon begin to awaken Alex’s hidden inner child. With fairy tale snowfalls, Mrs Claus’ magical ways in the kitchen and the somewhat surprising discovery of a sick reindeer in the garage, Alex’s six-year-old son Max begins to suspect the exciting truth. Caught up in the enchantment surrounding her perspective-in-laws, Alex doesn’t realise her cynical father and jealous colleague are plotting against the Claus’ in a bid to win Alex back to their sceptical world. With the wedding on the brink of being cancelled, it’s a battle of heart versus mind, with Christmas itself at stake.
