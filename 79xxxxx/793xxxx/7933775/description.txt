Lossless rips of the EP Remission (1984), Bites (1985), and the single Dig It (1986).

I ripped these to lossless monkeys audio, years ago. They aren't really being promoted any longer, so I figured I'd decompress and recompress to the current standard.

I own damn near all the Skinny Puppy CDs, so if there's anything you're missing, let me know.

I'm looking for lossless ohGr and cEvin Key releases.
