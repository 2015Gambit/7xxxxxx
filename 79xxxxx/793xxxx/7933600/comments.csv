,Ace.The.Bat.Hound,2012-12-20T20:29Z,well then don't be a bunghole and seed when you are done or just download the one you really want to see
,ratsima,2012-12-21T23:15Z,"Ace.The.Bat.Hound: Of course I will only download the ones I want! How do you think ISPs work? D/L levels are limited.
I appreciate your upload but it's not going very quickly, just a fact. My ratio is currently 3.069 for the torrent tho Ive only managed to d/l less than 30% in almost a week. I don't and wont have any problems seeding but fact is nobody else but you can seed the full deal cos nobody can get it!! "
