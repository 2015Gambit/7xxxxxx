PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD.

Hi,

The last half year I tried to monitor my uploads. I like to known how many people appreciates certain uploads. I get annoyed while trackers report less uploads than Seeders or when they come up with some minor downloaded figures. Soldier from Angus and Julia for instance reported 790 the first day and 304 the next. Now it sais 194 downloads while I know that it should be more than 6000 (when I just look at the first three numbers of the IP address).

So IΓÇÖve written a small application and I noticed a lot of strange traffic (same requests for 99% from ten different servers for instance) and some IP addresses which downloaded almost all uploads. And I want to be as precise as possible.

So I thought when I upload a torrent that is not downloaded by a person, I will be able to see some automatic generated traffic, so I will be able to BLOCK this traffic in the future.

Thanks for doing nothing (if you did not read this and download anyway you will be blocked)

A similar upload is available on this site and If all goes well I probably will be able to say for sure that in the last 18 month more than 100.000 (Indie) playlists has been downloaded. Good for our Indie Artists and a good motivation to continue (its hard sometimes)
