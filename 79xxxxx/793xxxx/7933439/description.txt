> Jurassic: the Hunted is an epic shooter set on a dark, mysterious island lost
in time. Players assume the role of weapons and survival expert Craig Dylan,
who has been hired to protect a research team studying the strange temporal
energy of the island. Protection quickly becomes a fight for survival as Dylan
is pulled back in time through the Bermuda Triangle and finds himself facing
the most terrifying creatures in the history of the planet. Combat encounters
include arena style fights, fortification sieges, survival modes and
unforgettable boss battles. Adrenaline bursts give you an edge - this
cinematic gameplay feature allows the player to visualize and then target an
opponent's weak points in slow motion. Jurassic the Hunted promises hours of
dino-survivalist entertainment at its finest.
Thanks to all our supporters! I really should get myself a PS3 I always wanted
one once it was hacked and now it is.
