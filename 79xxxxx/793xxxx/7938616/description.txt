Notes:

- This encode has been tested on MPC-HC, The KM Player, and VLC. If you experience playback issues, it's not due to the encode but to your poor choice in media player, settings or codecs.

- The subtitles are muxed in the MKV container--they're soft, optional subtitles. I have OCR'd the Russian subtitles directly from the DVD source, and have sync'd all of the remaining ones but for the Greek subs that were already in sync. Thanks to all the people and sites that make subtitles for P2P--they never get enough credit.
