"Actually taking place in the middle of the original Thorn Birds miniseries, which 

chronicled the love affair of Meggie Cleary and Fr. Ralph de Bricassart from 1920 to 

1962, this two-part miniseries begins in 1943. Father Ralph returns to Drogheda to 

evaluate its financial situation just as his one true love, Meggie, is embroiled in 

a bitter custody battle with her ex-husband, Luke."


I stumbled across this after uploading the four episodes of the 1983 video.

This is taken from the original novel but left out of the first production.

This fill-in was made 13 years after the first one. Richard Chamberlain is older.

Meggie is a different actress all-together. 

I am entering in my computer after the first four episodes.

I'll watch it later.
