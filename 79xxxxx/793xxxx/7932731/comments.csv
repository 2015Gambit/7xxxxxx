,dertrak,2012-12-22T17:24Z,"For those of you that want to try something new there is a game called Tribes:Ascend.It's similar to Unreal Tournament or Quake. Evryone gets a jetpack and jetboots, you get to fly around at very high speeds and it's quite a lot of fun. Here is a link for those of you who are interested https://account.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/?referral=1263875&utm_campaign=email"
