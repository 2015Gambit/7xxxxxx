About the Game

Battlefield: Bad Company 2 (Commonly abbreviated BFBC2) is a first-person shooter video game developed by the Swedish firm EA Digital Illusions CE (DICE) and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and iOS systems. 
The game is primarily a squad-level online first person shooter based in a contemporary modern warfare setting. Additionally, the game includes a single-player campaign, where the player re-assumes the role of Preston Marlowe, the protagonist of the original game. 
The game's Frostbite 1.5 engine allows for destructible environments,[8] and multiplayer maps, which allows for five different game modes, contain a wide selection of vehicles, aircraft and emplacements.
While Bad Company 2 is primarily a first-person shooter, it follows other games in the series by allowing the player to control certain vehicles, including ATVs, APCs, tanks, and helicopters. 
On foot, players are given access to a variety of real-world small arms such as assault rifles and machine guns. 
Players can also jump, crouch, and sprint. They can carry one primary weapon and a pistol in multiplayer, or two primary weapons in single-player, as well as grenades and other equipment. 
Players can fire "from the hip", but zooming in and using iron sights, reflex sights, or telescopic sights (depending on the weapon) will provide much better accuracy when shooting.......
