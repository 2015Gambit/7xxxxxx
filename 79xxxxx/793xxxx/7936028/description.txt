 An Italian Inspired Christmas

 

Nigella loves Christmas and for her a party is the perfect way to celebrate. This year, she kicks off festivities with a glittering buffet party. For her Italian inspiration Nigella travels to Venice, a city that has been close to her heart ever since her first visit 20 years ago. Armed with recipe and party ideas for her festive feast, Nigella returns to create a tasty Christmas buffet menu for her guests.

Nigella gets the party started with her own ruby red Venetian cocktail, served with quick and easy canapes like parmesan shortbreads and panettone stuffing squares. To follow is Nigella's new approach for the big bird - a turkey breast stuffed with Italian sausage and marsala steeped cranberries, served alongside a dazzling renaissance salad and a hearty brussel sprout pasta.

Guests are treated to irresistible desserts including a marshmallow cappuccino pavlova and a stunning Italian Christmas pudding cake - adorned with chocolate chips and pomegranate seeds - thought to bring good luck to the table. Nigella's Italian inspired party is spectacular sumptuous and will definitely get you in the Christmas spirit.

Buon Natale!
