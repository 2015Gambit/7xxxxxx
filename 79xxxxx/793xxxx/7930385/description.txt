This torrent contains a few fitness related documents I put together. Included in the "fitness books and videos" PDF are links to high quality fitness resources,that I specifically chose for martial artists. There are plenty of functional exercises to help build stamina as well as functional, explosive strength. Martial arts specific routines are also linked to. The "Overcoming Gravity" PDF has three pages of my personal notes about the book - including some tips on how to study it, constructing your own workbook based on the progression charts, and other bits of advice. Lastly, the "Strength and Fitness" guide contains articles that I personally wrote for the benefit of my martial arts students. Now, you get to benefit from it as well! Visit my website if you would like to know more about my style of karate.
