Reservedekk (2011)

John is driving through the most godforsaken area of Norway, when he accidently gets a flat tire. By his attempt to change the tire he realizes that that his car wasn’t equipped with one. But as he takes a peek at the ditch next to the road, he sees a whole bunch of spare tires.
While John is attempting to change his flat tire a nice guy comes along and offers him help.
But all John wants is to be left alone…
