[S],velvet.,2012-12-19T19:56Z,Enjoy your pink skull.
,EstiloNovo,2012-12-19T20:27Z,"Hey velvet, good choice of giving him a skull. He has been uploading quality torrents for a while now :)!"
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-19T21:30Z,I kind of like having those oriental subs on a movie.... gives it more of an international flavor. 
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-19T21:39Z,"Someone PLEASE export this to 640x272 ASAP, and don't crop it. Thanx."
,thorkis420,2012-12-20T01:54Z,why hardcode it when its just as easy to add the subs in a file. Gah
,Aoishiro,2012-12-20T05:41Z,"Why did korean always get an early bluray release? Usually russian too? Also why did the hardcoded the sub? Is it like marking their territory or something? Well at least the russian didn't hardcoded their subs.

Anyway congrats on the skull."
,Dlurker,2012-12-20T07:06Z,"I don't give a shit it's hardsub at least it isn't crop!

,10912362,2012-12-20T12:48Z,It comes hardcoded cause usually the source is from IPTV in Korea and foreign movies shown in Korea always comes with subtitles.
,KoaLARP,2012-12-20T13:42Z,i dont mind the hardcoded subs and im very glad that i donÂ´t have to wait another two weeks.so thank you very much mister(?) condors369 and yes enjoy your skull.
,sugarpuffextreme,2012-12-20T13:57Z,the subbed non cropped version is better. better image quality and this one is not only cropped.. it is stretched :/
,sugarpuffextreme,2012-12-20T13:58Z,sry my previous comment was suppose to go in the other torrents commentfield lol :P
,Aoishiro,2012-12-20T14:26Z,"So it's a direct rip from tv, that explains the hardcoded subs. So the korean get to see this on tv  before bluray/DVD gets released huh.l"
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-21T00:30Z,"@sugarpuffextreme: What are you smoking..? This *IS* the uncropped version with full korean subs and correct A/R. Thanks, JYK/condors369!"
,10912362,2012-12-21T00:57Z,The problem with having such widespread IPTV usage (only $5/month) is that the DVD/Bluray market is virtually dead in korea. Consequently the korean film studios have to make all their money from cinema ticket sales resulting in less of great films from the likes of park chan-wook and kim ki-duk which tend to not do well in cinemas and more of garbage films with shitty 3D post production and dumbed-down comedies.
,nairobi19,2012-12-21T03:51Z,"This is the best quality rip of Dredd on pirate bay, I've tried like 5 of them. Korean subs aren't distracting."
,AsifAkheir,2012-12-21T09:36Z,"Thanks condors369.

,michaelrwatson,2012-12-21T21:45Z,"Can anyone confirm, how is the audio on this one? Some rips apparently have pauses or glitches or something.... THis looks like the best version qualitywise right now, so.... depends on the audio. Thx."
,net0junky,2012-12-22T00:22Z,No sample?
,lerijiso,2012-12-24T15:15Z,"This one looked the best based on the screenshots, uncropped and even fully shown the korean sub.  Thanks for the fantastic work. I hate croppers."
,lerijiso,2012-12-24T15:38Z,"Based on the screenshot, this look to be the best yet..video wise. Uncropped with the subs displayed fully. I don't mind that. Thanks a lot."
,Toker_Wolf,2012-12-24T17:41Z,"V: 10 A: 9 M: 9

liked the movie, Olivia Thirlby was smoking hot as a blonde. since I watch all my anime with subs, was kinda hard not to look at the subs but was do-able. great upload thanks!"
