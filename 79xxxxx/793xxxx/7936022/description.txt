POtHS Comments on This one:

Description:

IndoctriNation _ the movie:
"Every Christian parent with a child in a government school should see this [movie] and be forced to confront their unwillingness to do what Scripture requires for the children on loan to them by God. A mass exodus from government schools is the only way to preserve the souls and minds of our children."
Cal Thomas (AmericaΓÇÖs most widely syndicated op-ed columnist)

Public Schools Are the Cause of Christianity's Decline.  Christian documentary filmmaker Colin Gunn chose a yellow school bus to represent the impact of public schools on students and society in his new film, ΓÇ£IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America.ΓÇ¥

"The bus became a symbol for the public school system, partly because it broke down so frequently,ΓÇ¥ Gunn told The Christian Post Thursday. ΓÇ£Our philosophy of the public school system is it is something that can't be fixed. It is something that Christians need to walk away from."

The film follows Gunn and his family as they take a three-week road trip in a 1988 Chevy school bus to visit sites that pertain to education in America. It addresses the philosophy, history and practicality of the public education system, Gunn said, and shows a side of the system the media and schools don't show. ...


11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
