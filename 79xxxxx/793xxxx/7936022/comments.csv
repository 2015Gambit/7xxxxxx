People learn to think critically and conclude that they no longer need bronze-age mythology ruling their lives and filling them with fear and intolerance. Our schools should not be teaching or encouraging  the lies and myths that keep people ignorant of the truth of the universe. Science may cause people to question their religious indoctrination and conclude that they don't need a 'god' to be happy or morally correct. This is a good thing. This needs to happen if we are to become a peaceful, civilized society. 

I know, I know, I'm 'free to leave'. Your standard comeback for any who disagree with your world view. 

I am also free to say anything I want in opposition to the misguided, misinformed, myth-based, paranoid garbage that you post.  

Have a nice day."
