Storyline

An Apache warrior who defies U.S. attempts to bring the Indians under control grapples with an array of U.S. soldiers sent to subdue his revolt. Sympathetic scouts seek to bring Geronimo back to the reservation before he is hunted down. 

User Review

Chuck Connors is an unlikely "Geronimo", who (depending on your perspective) was a rebellious tribal leader of the Apache who engineered a number of bloody coups against the Mexicans and U.S. territories north of the border. This version (there are several films on the subject) concentrates on his time both on and at times off the imposed reservation following his surrender, with arrogant cavalry captain Pat Conway goading him into retaliation after repeated mistreatment and degradation of his people.

More temperate types (pre-Batman Adam West as a uniformed pacifier) attempt to cajole Geronimo back to the safety of the reservation, culminating in a tense climax. Larry Dobkin, John Anderson, Ross Martin and Denver Pyle (20 years pre "Dukes of Hazzard", but still recognisable) have supporting roles, but Connors chews the scenery as hero, with Conway firmly painted as the antagonist.

Not especially gripping, nor apparently historically accurate, the atmosphere is typical Hollywood gloss and aside from some impressive horse-riding and wrangling stunt-work, there's little else to recommend.
