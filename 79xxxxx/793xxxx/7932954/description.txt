THE NEW WORLD ORDER AND THE WORK OF THE UNITED NATIONS

The Spiritual Impulse Behind the United Nations:
"Let Purpose guide the little wills of men". It is not a coincidence that we are celebrating both the 50th anniversary of the Great Invocation and the United Nations. Both in different ways are pivotal to the Plan and much as yet remains to be done before the purpose of either can be fully realized. Let us therefore utilize our opportunity today and continue to hold and deepen the group's spiritual tension. Let us together, complete the triangle of light, love and power and from this vantage point, let us contemplate that world body--"the hope of humanity"--which was conceived just 50 years ago under the impulse of the three spiritual Festivals. (falling on March 28th, April 27th and May 26th)

As the dream that arose from a nightmare, it gave hope to the world at a time when people were in despair. Pronouncing an end to the scourge of war and envisioning a world of justice, peace and progress for all peoples of the earth, the United Nations has been called humanity's most far-sighted and significant undertaking.

It was on April 25, 1945 two days previous to the full moon of Taurus and the Festival of Wesak that delegates from 50 nations, met in San Francisco for a conference known officially as the United Nations Conference on International Organization.

Appalled at the atrocities they had witnessed and the hell they had undergone, their mission was to create an organization that would forever end the scourge of war and serve as a mechanism for future peace.  source : http://www.aquaac.org/un/impulse.html
