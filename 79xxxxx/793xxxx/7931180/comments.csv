,mike953100,2012-12-24T03:42Z,"So, this upload does not have Episode 4.  It also does not have:

Homeland.S02E03.PROPER.HDTV.x264-EVOLVE
Homeland.S02E05.PROPER.HDTV.x264-EVOLVE
Homeland.S02E12.PROPER.HDTV.x264-EVOLVE.

You can find all 12 PROPER and correct episodes with subtitles, samples, and NFO here:

,jbski,2012-12-31T14:29Z,"Hi sorry, am i missing something here, ok i know part 4 is missing and u posted the link and i downloaded cool stuff. however, at the begininng of episode 2 in this torrent it shows some clips of scenes that are not in episode one. as far as i knew it was ""last time cut scenes"" not cuts from the current episode like BSG annoying was. However, It seems like episode 2 is missing and the file labeled ep2 is actually ep3, the file ep 3 is actually ep4. I tried another torrent source and same issue. So why i do really feel like i havent seen ep2, shes running throught the market and knees that dude in balls and that hasnt happened yet in ep1. Also the bit where he burried the koran isnt in ep1 so why is it in the ""last time on"" cut scenes in ep2. this is really irritation lol because i dont want to watch ep the wrong episode. ignore the grammar i cant be arsed to correct it...any ideas??"
,jbski,2012-12-31T14:33Z,wow totally ignore my last post i must be going mad. sorry. great torrent thanks so much.
