The pictures and layout make this book a treat. You can relate the info and place it to a face. Also, the author's genuine take on the acts, bring a human feeling to the psychological acts behind the murderer's hiding behind a medical uniform."
  
This book captures the stories of five doctors who have killed their patients, including, Harold Shipman, Marcel Petiot, Michael Swango, H.H. Holmes, and John Bodkin Adams. It is amazing that these people chose a profession to help save lives, but preferred to kill.
