[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-12-19T00:39Z,"@iryhousen- Lol!! Although, technically, those of us in Australia have until Saturday!
I've been watching 8 out of 10 cats and noticed if the guest is from TOWIE, they are so dumb it's hilarious! If they are from Made in Chelsea, it is your privilege to be watching them, they are so vain. And if they are from Hollyoaks, it doesn't matter how dumb or vain they are when they are as hot as Jennifer Metcalfe!! "
,magz64,2012-12-19T07:50Z,"Hi Gary, can you please put up made in chelsea come dine with me special? Thanks for uploading soo quickly for all of us ozzies"
,iryhousen,2012-12-19T10:48Z,"The Come Dine With Me Made in Chelsea is available, it just needs to be seeded a little more.  I guess I'm going to have to watch 8 out of ten cats if they had  on Mercedes McQueen.   I wish someone would put up Hollyoaks, although it's usually available on Youtube, they're about a week behind right now.  Episode 02.22 of Winners and Losers from Australia hasn't been uploaded.  "
,jangocfc,2012-12-19T17:29Z,"Thanks Gary... every week you come through, and i get to watch the football in peace, while my fiance watches this. You are a Legend"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-12-19T22:22Z,"@jangocfc- No worries! Glad I could help!!!
@magz64- Is it the one I posted a while back under my original username? Or is there a newer one? If it's the old one, I might still have it on a hard drive somewhere and can re-seed it. 
@iryhousen- You are far better watching Hollyoaks on YouTube even if it is one week behind. When I did up it, people never seeded for long and it is a daily show which makes that even more frustrating! This way it permanently is there! "
,iryhousen,2012-12-20T01:47Z,"You can find Gary's Come Dine With Me MiC upload  in two parts under ""Channel 4 Mash Up"".  There are more seeds now.  "
,djt067,2012-12-20T09:39Z,"Hi Gary,will you be doing the TOWIE xmas special at all if its not toomuch trouble, think ts on tonight or last nite not sure,chrs"
,magz64,2012-12-20T23:25Z,"Its a new come dine with me made in chelsea special, i have watched the other one. I only know cos it says at the end of episode 10"
,rndgs,2012-12-26T00:31Z,Hey GB! Just wanted to say thank you for all the awesome shows that you take the time to upload - really appreciate it! Hope you've had a brilliant Christmas break :)
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2013-01-03T22:13Z,"@rndgs- Sorry mate, I only just saw your post! I try to respond to everyone. Especially the ones who are complimentary! I had a great break thanks and wish you a happy 2013!!"
