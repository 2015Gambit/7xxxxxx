It took me a while to figure this out since I am no tech wiz, and I'm sure most of you have probably spent hours on the internet looking for Bible versions that are compatible with OpenLP. The good news is, I made a breakthrough and was able to convert 75 different Bible versions into xmm.(open song)format.

Now all you have to do is download the file; start OpenLP, click import, slecet Bible, click next, select OpenSong format, locate the file, fill in the name and copyright column - its that simple.
God Bless you as you serve in His vineyard.
