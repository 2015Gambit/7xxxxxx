Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Tuesday, December 18 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex confronts a tidal wave of anti-Second Amendment propaganda flooding out of the corporate media as the government ramps up its assault against legal firearms. 

He also covers the link between mass shootings and antidepressants and talks about the latest surge in firearms purchases after the Sandy Hook shooting. 

Alex talks with the executive director of Gun Owners of America, Larry Pratt, about the government push to ban firearms and the Democrat effort in the coming year to pass anti-gun legislation. 

Alex also talks with Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) about Obama's unconstitutional effort to involve the United States in a possible Syrian intervention under the guise of preventing the use of chemical weapons.
