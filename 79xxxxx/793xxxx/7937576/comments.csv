,rmeleby,2012-12-19T21:03Z,"Thanks for posting, _SnakEye

Anyone else having an issue with text not displaying on the PFD and EICAS? The ND is working perfectly. Impossible to fly without the airspeed and altitude tapes.

I have uninstalled and re installed 3 times now.

Thanks"

,Ssquito,2012-12-20T08:21Z,"Hi there

I am quite new to all this. I downloaded the installer version and I see there is a .dll file included, where do I put this? I can't install the software as it asks for email.

Thanks in advance."
,chinopr,2012-12-20T08:38Z,"_SnakEye


I will like to thank you for all the uploads you have made...

I have a question for you, do you know if its possible to get the NavDataPRO updates once they are released, so we can use them with this aircraft?"
,themastertorrentseeder,2012-12-20T09:28Z,"@Ssquito
How to install:
1) Extract the .RAR file
2) Inside the extracted folder open the .EXE file
3) Select language and press OK
4) Now go to AppDataLocal and search for file ""ascrypt_pro.dll""
5) Right click this found file and select ""Open file location
6) Now drag and replace the .dll file from the extracted folder to the one you have just searched for
7) Continue with the installation was all registration fields blank
8) Install, have fun!
9) Don't forget to install the latest AIRAC Cycle! ;)

Thanks SnakEye for this great upload!"

Thank you so much! Works perfectly! Much appreciated."
,DarkstarG,2012-12-20T10:09Z,"Thank you for the up.
Tested this new marvel - I wouldn't say it's worth every penny.
Textures in VC could be better, smoothness in the VC is good, but externally stuttering... will be flying a bit, if I like it, buy, if not, off the disk and wait for FSL."
,Kooosh,2012-12-20T12:47Z,What's the difference between paid version and this? :/ 
[T],_SnakEye,2012-12-20T12:55Z,"@DarkstarG, correct. worth every penny for the price range of this Product.
you shouldn't expect this to compete with the High End Products like PMDG, etc.

--Quote Mathijs Kok (Aerosoft)--
""Keep in mind this is a medium priced product and not intended to have the same features as a high priced aircraft. We made this product 'wide' meaning we added features like RAAS and a Flight Data Recorder that are normally paid add-ons."""
[T],_SnakEye,2012-12-20T12:57Z,"@Gab_420, why are you re posting a release that is already here in TPB?
this post is with a Crack!!

you will cause a split seeders which would eventually bring the death of both torrents.
please head over to the superbay forums (link below at the bottom of this page)
and ask them to remove your redundant torrent.
Thank You"

,Kooosh,2012-12-20T18:25Z,How do you install? I can't seem to find AppDataLocal like themastertorrentseeder recommended! 
,themastertorrentseeder,2012-12-20T18:35Z,"@Kooosh
Sorry, I didn't realise TPB doesnt like slashes, so I'll use _ instead:

""C:_Users_Username_AppData_Local"""
[T],_SnakEye,2012-12-20T18:49Z,Local folder is in side Appdata folder
,anymore2,2012-12-20T23:26Z,"Snake, can you post Hotfix1, will be released tomorrow?
