Try searching for:

NCIS S10E10

or

NCIS S10*

or NCIS*

None of them seem to bring up this, or any of the other episode 10s in the search results (No hits)"

Sorry, this is way too late to be of use. There was a temporary glitch in adding new files to the search queue for about 36 hours, I believe. It's long been fixed now, sorry for the inconvenience. and the delay responding.
