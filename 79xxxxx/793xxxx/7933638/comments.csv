,Skram0,2012-12-19T04:51Z,No seeders. Nice..
,mojo300,2012-12-31T20:20Z,"This was uploaded December 17, 2012 and 10 days later it is already dead? How about seeding some more please. This is bloody ridiculous. 

And how about you 18 leeching bastards keep seeding for a change?

Thanks for the upload. And, for you who have seen the content, is it any good?"
,Andy_S,2013-01-01T10:28Z,"mojo300: sadly, there haven't been any seeders since 19th (as Skram0 pointed out)... and althrough there are leechers, if they don't have anything (i myself have 1.5MB of 72GB), nothing can be shared... you know, you first need a seeder from which those leeches can download at first place :]"
,mojo300,2013-01-05T03:40Z,"Andy_S thanks for the reply. Yeah, I understand what you are saying - there has to be something to seed in the 1st place.

I just don't get why ermanrich would make a 72GB upload and then abandon it so quickly. It makes me think that it's a bogus upload. I found the ""DUKES"" upload of TNG season 2 (72GB same as this it seems) tracked at KickA$$ Torrents. I downloaded from their torrent link and I got the whole thing in less than 3 days. Go find it there. It works and is legit. It is all in rar files."
,mojo300,2013-01-05T03:45Z,"Do a search at that other tracker I mentioned above. Search for ""star trek tng dukes"" and you will find the good copy."
,mojo300,2013-01-05T03:53Z,"Andy_S thanks for the reply. I posted a reply on how to find this torrent on another tracking site but my comment was almost immediately deleted. That comment was not spam. Anyway, just do a search for TNG dukes elsewhere (still 72GB and 1080p) and you will find it."
