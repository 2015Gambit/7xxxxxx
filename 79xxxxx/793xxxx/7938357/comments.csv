,Dimmis80,2012-12-19T16:20Z,Hey MsFenmore.I think that i have a problem generaly with piratebay/torrents.In the search box when i like always wrote The bold just these to words and it found all of the words The Bold and the Beautiful it found the previous episode and not this new one and i found this when i clicked in your name.!?Does anyone has this problem is it PB problem or is just a problem of mine or something.??Thanks in advance guys.???Btw i have that thing with all of the torrents like movies NBA and stuff.!!????
,bleslie1,2012-12-19T19:26Z,"It's probably because it was recently uploaded. After its been up for a while you should be able to get it by just searching ""the bold"" or ""the bold and the beautiful.""  Same thing happens to me when she first puts them up sometimes. I'm not 100% sure why that is though.

Anyway, thanks again, Msfenmore! :)"

,GfcTrayis,2013-01-03T14:25Z,if a torrent is new you might not be able to see it in the search because it doesnt have enough seeds and leeches / relevance. as more people get the torrent and its gets a little older it will start to show up in higher priority on search results. best option if you know what your waiting for is the check the user not just search :)
