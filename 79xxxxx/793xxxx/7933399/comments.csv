,xidio,2012-12-20T04:14Z,Beware This is 4:3 not 16:9 thus not 720p.
,demzer1,2012-12-20T04:50Z,"Xidio, because something is shown in 4:3 doesn't automatically make it standard-def or non-720p.  TV shows are ""framed"" 4:3 yet can be available in HD (just like Star Trek: TOS on BluRay).  Besides, there IS no 16:9 version of ST:TNG, even this remastered one is 4:3, because the shots were framed that way.  If you widened the frame you would see boom mics, technicians, etc. so when remastering they retained the original aspect ratio."
,chrralph,2012-12-20T14:21Z,"the above poster is correct.. 4:3 is how it was shot in the first place (on a side note there are episodes of everybody loves raymond where you can see boom mics if your watching the dvd on a 16:9 tv)

seriously though the support on the star trek tng torrents is horrible.. season 1 & 2 for me downloading at 7kbps (dont mind the waiting as im getting it for free, but its a horrible speed) and its not my fault because i have torrents download usually around 1-3mbps"
,xidio,2012-12-20T19:12Z,"Then write the correct resolution instead of lying.

Its not 720p, its 960x720.

Just because it says 720 behind something does NOT mean it is 720p. Its nowhere near 720p.

Soon people will think 1280x1080 is 1080p..."
,cohfan123,2012-12-21T00:31Z,"Hey xidiot... if you don't know WTF you're talking about, please refrain from commenting."
,StarkRG,2012-12-21T02:40Z,"720p means 720 horizontal scan lines (top-to-bottom virtical resolution) making this more 720p than most movies which are wider than 16:9. However xidio is correct that true 720p requires an aspect ratio of 16:9 meaning this isn't true 720p just like most movies with 1280 pixels of horizontal resolution but less than 720 pixels of virtical resolution are not true 720p, and yet every 720p bluray will say it's 720p despite the movie not being 16:9 and require letterboxing."
,Chris2027,2012-12-21T22:06Z,"xidio, you're an idiot...

Upload a video that is 960x720 or 1440x1080 on YouTube, you get the 720p and 1080p HD options...

1280x720 is 16:9 HD...
960x720 is 4:3 HD...

1920x1080 is 16:9 full HD...
1440x1080 is 4:3 full HD...

The vertical pixel count is what matters, not the horizontal pixel count..."
,cohfan123,2012-12-22T22:12Z,Why is this so slow?? Come on people... im uploading at 80kB/s and downloading at 100 kB/s for like 4 days now... at this rate I'll be waiting until next year!
,Torrenad000,2012-12-22T23:34Z,"Thanks so much for this you rock! Hey cmon people quit complaining and thank the uploader, unless you wanna go and pay 70 bucks to buy this..."
,Torrenad000,2012-12-22T23:37Z,A:10 V: 10 btw 
,cohfan123,2012-12-28T01:44Z,"Look dudes... thanks a lot for the upload... but it'd be really nice if you'd all stop including subtitles in the damned files... or at least don't make them so they automatically load... it's really annoying when I have to get up and turn them off every single episode... I can't be the only one who hates this... if I wanted subtitles, I'd fucking download them... thanks!"
,notseen,2012-12-28T15:49Z,"Still downloading, but the quality of the first couple episodes is incredible.

cohfan123 - You can turn off subtitles automatically loading in VLC or MPC or whatever program you are using, there is always an option."
,vatel88,2013-01-02T16:08Z,"If you dont like subtitles then DELETE THE SUBTITLE FILE YOU FRAKING MORON!!!

To the idiots complaing this isnt true HD. You obviously did not watch the special features on the first season which explains why this is in 4:3 and why its still in HD regardless of your lack of understanding of HD image specifications. "
,vatel88,2013-01-02T16:26Z,"No complaints at BOZX but i do have to say this is the slowest torrent i've download since switching from dial up over a decade ago. 

Those that have completed this torrent please continue seeding this torrent doesn't die please. IM sure there is someone else out there just like yourself that also really wants to see these awesome episodes in glorious HD so please KEEP SEEDING until 2:1!"
,danwat1234,2013-01-02T23:42Z,Any extra content like the extra minutes of 'measure of a man' or the 10 minute blooper video?
,danwat1234,2013-01-02T23:44Z,"What matters more is not if it is ""True HD"" or not but if the bitrate is high enough so compression doesn't crappify the quality. I say if you can see the pores of actors faces on close ups, that's just fine."
,vatel88,2013-01-07T23:49Z,"What is the ETA on the SEASON 2 Extras? The BEST part of this series being re-released by far.

Also could you upload the extended versions of Q Who and Measure of a Man?"
,Skram0,2013-01-08T07:46Z,"Here's a comparison I did with some VLC snapshots between an older encode (549MB) and these new ones (2.18GB). The older encode was from meech, and appears to be some type of interlaced encoding. The new encodes are far superior in quality and size. I couldn't imagine what 1080p would look like.
