From Wiki:

The Cranberries are an Irish rock band formed in Limerick in 1989. The band consists of vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan and drummer Fergal Lawler. Although widely associated with alternative rock, the band's sound also incorporates indie pop, post-punk, Irish folk and pop rock elements.[1]

The Cranberries rose to international fame in the 1990s with their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, which became a commercial success and sold over five million copies in the United States. The group was one of the most successful rock acts of the '90s and sold over 15 million albums in the United States alone. The band has achieved four top 20 albums on the Billboard 200 chart (Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?; No Need to Argue; To the Faithful Departed and Bury the Hatchet)[2] and eight top 20 singles on the Modern Rock Tracks chart ("Linger", "Dreams", "Zombie", "Ode to My Family", "Ridiculous Thoughts", "Salvation", "Free to Decide" and "Promises").[2]

After a six-year hiatus, The Cranberries reunited and began a North American tour, followed by dates in Latin America and Europe in early 2010.[3][4] The band recorded their sixth album, Roses, in May 2011, and released it on 27 February 2012.

Roses is the sixth studio album by Irish band The Cranberries, released in the Republic of Ireland[1] on 24 February 2012 and globally on 27 February 2012.[2][3] Produced by Stephen Street, it is the band's first studio release in ten years. Originally planned to be released in early 2004[4] the recordings for the follow-up to Wake Up and Smell the Coffee were scrapped after the band decided to go their separate ways.[5][6] After a six-year hiatus, The Cranberries announced their intention to record a new album during their 2009ΓÇô2010 reunion tour. The title Roses was announced on The Cranberries website, on 24 May 2011. The album deals with relationships, both romantic love and love in other forms.
