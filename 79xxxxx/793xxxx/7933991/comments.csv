,RafVne2,2012-12-18T01:01Z,"Guys I see 18 peers on utorrent... I'm not asking you write a fucking essay. Just post something like ""yeah dude it's working"" . I just want to know if it's my utorrent acting up (it's been giving me some shit lately, crashing and shit) I can't diagnose a problem without a damn info.

So... just want to know... is it working?"

So I'm guessing the torrent IS working. No need for rarring the thing then? (i thought pirate bay may/doesn't recognize 7z format). Thanks dor the post though."
