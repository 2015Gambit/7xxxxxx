Couldn't find one in English so I decided to make one myself, my first time doing this and it turned out pretty well, as good as I could get it atleast. 

Have watched most of the movie and didn't lose sync at any time, The 3D effect was decent but not the best I have seen.

Unfortunately only 2 Channel audio but was the best audio sync I could get without downloading a 5gb torrent just to test if I could sync it. With enough demand I may make a 5.1 Channel version though.

Merry Christmas! - Hawk333
