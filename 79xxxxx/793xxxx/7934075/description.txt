The Shift of the Ages is a dramatic documentary film that reveals the story of the Mayan culture and its sophisticated prophecies of time, as told for the first time by the Grand Elder of the Mayan people, Alejandro Cirilo Perez Oxlaj. Commissioned on behalf of the Maya nation, the Shift of the Ages is the first official discourse to the world from the Mayan Council of Elders, intended to dispel misconceptions and replace them with the positive story about this incredible period of time for humanity. Known as Wandering Wolf, Don Alejandro is the elected Grand Elder of the living Maya, former Ambassador in the Guatemalan Government, and mystical Aj QΓÇÖji, or timekeeper of tradition.
