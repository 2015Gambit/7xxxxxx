Unaired ""TSA"" episode

On October 29, 2012 Jesse Ventura made an appearance on the Alex Jones radio show and made it known that the final episode of the third season, an episode involving the TSA, would not air. He declined to mention what the reason was, only that ""the decision was made at TruTV, if you want to know, ask them.""
[edit] David Icke feud

On the premiere episode for season three, which focused on the conspiracy theory that shape-shifting reptilians are controlling the world in human form, Ventura interviewed the man who popularized the conspiracy, David Icke. Ventura met Icke at the Agora in Cleveland, Ohio in November 2011, where Icke had just finished one of his seminars. During the interview, Ventura pitched what he called ""hard questions"" at Icke such as how much money he made off the conspiracy with book sales and speeches. Icke became insulted and an argument broke out in which Icke eventually walked off the set.

In an article written by Icke shortly after the incident, Icke said part of the reason for his getting upset was because he waited a long time for Ventura to start the interview. Icke also said that Ventura, who in the end of the episode concluded that the reptilian conspiracy was false, should have stayed and listened to Icke giving all the information and ""connecting all the dots,"" to confirm Icke's theories"
