  Working once again with producer Jude Cole, Lifehouse finally achieve a semblance of maturity on 2012's Almer√≠a, the band's sixth album. The difference is this: the band is settling into its maturity, no longer feeling the need to create muscular, mordant modern rock anthems. Here, the group embraces a wider sonic palette, a shift that's immediate from the dense tapestry of the opening "Gotta Be Tonight." Elsewhere, Natasha Bedingfield and Peter Frampton stop by for cameos, lending color to Lifehouse's sometimes dour rockers. On the whole, Lifehouse have gotten lighter with age. They no longer are determined to plumb the depths of their soul; they're happy to offer slight, meaningful textures to their introspective rockers. The cumulative effect is welcoming: they're brighter, happier, and lighter than before, qualities that make for one of their better records.
