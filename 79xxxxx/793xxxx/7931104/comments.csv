,.Leto.,2012-12-17T19:46Z,"My god, what a bad show this was! Mick Jagger is the only one who looks alive. It's really amazing to still be able to move like that at his age. But the other 3 really look like zombies, barely moving. Except for Mick Taylor the guests were useless.
Best moment of the show: Midnight Rambler with Mick Taylor. I really wish he had played the whole show instead of just 1 song.
Worst moment: lady gaga ruining Gimme Shelter. That woman is a total joke!!"
