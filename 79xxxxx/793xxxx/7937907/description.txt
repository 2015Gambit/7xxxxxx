 Suman lives a wealthy lifestyle along with          
 her widower dad, Thakur Ranvir Singh, and an        
 unmarried aunt, Damyanti, in a palatial house       
 in Bombay. They are direct descendants of Raja      
 Hariman Singh of Bijapur. When Ranvir finds         
 out that Suman is in love with a middle-classed     
 male, Sanjay, he expresses displeasure and forbids  
 her to ever see him again. When she persists,       
 he tells her that there is a curse on the entire   
 family - a curse that was inflicted 200 years ago  
 by a blood-thirsty, flesh-eating demon named Samri.
 This curse impacts only women in their family, who 
 are hideously transformed after giving birth to     
 their firstborn, and die a painful death. Treating  
 this as mere superstitious, Suman and Sanjay, along 
 with Sanjay's friend, Anand and his wife, Sapna,    
 set out to Bijapur to unearth and put an end to this
 rumor - not knowing that soon they will resurrect   
 a virtually indestructible Samri...
