"Putting Out Fires"

Following a public mishap, Skip (Josh 
Gad), the First Son of President 
Gilchrist (Bill Pullman), is ushered back 
to the White House so he can be kept 
under careful watch. Meanwhile, Dale 
attempts to keep a cool atmosphere when 
South American leaders visit to discuss a 
trade agreement. Elsewhere, Emily (Jenna 
Elfman) tries to make peace with her 
stepdaughter Becca (Martha MacIsaac), who 
has a surprise in store for everybody.
