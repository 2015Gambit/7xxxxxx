Hi guys/galls.

(Other torrent did not seem to work)

So I was searching for a 1.04 update and I couldn't find it. I could just post a link to the place I found it on... except... I have no damn clue where I found it.

So first things first... 
I'd like to thank people from Reloaded team (and I do realize you guys hate P2P) And I know you won't read it... doesn't matter... you guys are a brilliant bunch and the least I can do is say a simple fucking thank you.

So again... Thank you.

What else...

I have a really shitty upload speed (can't afford a better one) i can only up at 50-60 KB and this one isn't a small file. (it's like 1.5 Gigs). So please, if it's not too much to ask seed the fucking thing.

There's a chance I fucked something up, so let me know.

I threw in a reloaded crack and a coalesced that will unlock all the bonus stuff. For your convenience I enigmatically called it "thrown In" folder. (bet you wouldn't crack that code) :). Oh I think that this coalesced will also unlock the stripper/dancer outfit.


If anyone will post "Seed"... I'll fucking find you and bitch slap you like a little fuck you obviously are. (just realized that I'm inviting whole bunch of ppl to ironically post "seed" Which is kind of funny when used sarcastically ):)


I didn't notice any change so don't ask me what this update does.
There's a chance you will not be able to get through some DLC moments, I have found three moments (both terminals in From ashes, trying to land on the planet searching for doc in leviathan, and going by a pod in Omega).
A fix is simple... Delete the "Bioware" folder, save your saves, than just move your saves back once the game create new folder. I think you gotta run the game once you delete bioware folder. I couldn't figure out where the code hides, but it is definitely in your documents.

if you got a firefight DLC you will see two missing weapon graphics... to fix that you need a multiplayer DLC (Devs must have fucked up)... What was it called... let me check...

I've set them to private because, 
gets many times Bad Gateway or MySQL errors on my browsers.

Oh and if you want insert a F12 binding to unlock Firefight DLC Weapons,
I've tested that today on afternoon!
My modified DLC Coalesced.bin hasn't working!

but i hope you will have luck

EDIT:
To solve the problem with the two missing weapons....
install Resurgence and Rebellion Multiplayer-DLC's![/quote]


I think I got it off of some Russian site (got great memory... short though) :)




I think that's it I probably forgot something, but hey [fake Italian accent]Wacha' gonna' do[/fake italian accent]
 So be good now 
And take care
