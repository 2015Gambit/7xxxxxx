,bears34,2012-12-27T05:15Z,"how do i execute the patch, do i copy and paste everything in the RAR into My Mass Effect 3 directory?"
,bears34,2012-12-27T05:16Z,and what do I run to actually get the patch to install?
,Fantomnz,2012-12-30T08:15Z,"@bears34

Yes except for the last four files which are the torrent file to the Whats new file.
Copy paste merge & overwrite.
Dont forget to make a new shortcut from the now NEW ME3.exe & Run as Admin.....

,vencivool,2013-01-01T19:26Z,This Update worked really good on my Mass Effect 3  but I want ask if you can upload the Groundside Resistance Pack for ME3
,wymm666,2013-01-07T07:51Z,"From Ashes crashes with this reloaded update (if it in fact is a reloaded release)

It's the console bug on eden prime. you access one of the two consoles, and the game crashes. very repeatable bug, tried with different classes, characters, squadmate, different time in plots, all of them crashes the game.

and the workaround from before the 1.04 update no longer work -- the esc button smashing trick and the go-to-the-other-console-first trick don't work anymore."
