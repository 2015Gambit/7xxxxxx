"The album is a unique musical expression of the experience of the total eclipse of the Sun moving over countries of Europe (Hungary among others) and Asia on August 11, 1999. The compositions do not follow the order of events; rather they convey the atmosphere of the solar eclipse and the accompanying phenomena in the language of music".
