MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) is a preservation project to save the software from old arcade games in a playable form for future generations.
In this torrent are the roms, hard disk images, and artwork for MAME 0.144 (still works with current version, 0.147 [as of 2012.12.11]). 18604 zipped rom files, 416 CHD files, plus ~7 GB of artwork.
I take only a little credit for this torrent, it is compiled from a collection of other torrents.  I just thought it should be available as one (giant) accessable repository (instead of the confiusing list of updates and versions I started with).

enjoy!

p.s. Due to the size of this torrent, it is crucial for the first people who finish downloading to seed at least as much as they downloaded, and not just "hit and run." [fingers crossed.]
p.p.s. Had to put in rars to make torrent file small enough to be accepted by TPB system. (and split it into two torrents)
