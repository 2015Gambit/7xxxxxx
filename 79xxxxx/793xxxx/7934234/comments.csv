,cutypi,2012-12-25T13:32Z,"Hey i just downloaded and mounted the .iso but there is now game install file? help would be appreciated, thanks."
,JaySexy,2012-12-26T22:14Z,"downloaded power iso to help mount the files, but ISO can't mount/open the "".001"" file let alone install it. Help would be appreciated... thanks man."
,JaySexy,2012-12-26T22:39Z,"finally got it to PowerISO, it's mounting now. you never said that we had to extract every volume just for "".001"" to work. I think you should revise your instructions so that it isn't so trial and error."
,JaySexy,2012-12-26T23:33Z,"It installed but now it is saying ""XINPUT1_3.dll is missing from your computer."" I've checked the all the files included with installation but XINPUT1_3.dll isn't one of them. Help would be most appreciated, thank you."
