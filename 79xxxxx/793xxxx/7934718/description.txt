Book Description
C++ΓÇÖs flexibility, modelling power, support for object-oriented and generic programming, and extensive tool set, make it attractive for embedded projects, but some developers worry about code bloat and hidden performance penalties. This seminar begins by confronting those issues directly, then moves on to demonstrate how C++ can improve the correctness, readability, and efficiency of embedded software, in some cases accomplishing what is literally impossible in C.
