,freeegatee,2012-12-19T18:56Z,Thanks so much.
,cs01ws,2012-12-19T21:06Z,"This is the un-cropped version if anyone is wondering, it is however still only very slightly cropped but I don't mind the subtitles being there better that than miss nearly 20% of the screen with the other version that is out there!"
,cs01ws,2012-12-19T21:06Z,BTW thanks uploader!
,swine666,2012-12-19T23:06Z,Id rather watch the subtitles (which i don't understand) along with the rest of the movie than have the cropped version
,arnaiz08,2012-12-20T01:20Z,merry thanks
,nihilizm,2012-12-20T04:25Z,"nothing to complain about - imbedded subs no complaints when the movie is perfect pitch and just newly released - wicked

,Kelaro,2012-12-20T05:52Z,"Question: I'm a noob - does the 3D bit in the title mean that I need special glasses for this torrent, or does it mean something different in the downloading world?"
,PseudoPositive,2012-12-20T06:17Z,"Thanks S4A, very nice, no problems with the subs , booze will take of that. @kelaro, you don't need glasses, it's just like a regular movie. +1."
,NaNaMoose,2012-12-20T07:40Z,thanks for all the great ups! happy holidays
,hatepig,2012-12-20T09:41Z,worst movie i've ever seen.
,trace535,2012-12-20T19:21Z,"To those wondering why the second line of Korean subtitles is cut in half, in the source 720p HD movie there is a black bar at the bottom, but it was removed here. So rest assured, this is indeed completely uncropped."
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-21T00:20Z,"Doesn't look right with the subtitles *partially* cropped. Either cut them off or don't, but don't do it half-assed. The narrow black bar is typical for a DVD/BR w/ subs. This rip should be NUKED."
,trace535,2012-12-21T00:38Z,"michaelrwatson:

So this perfect (v:10 a:10) release with the bottom black bar removed should be nuked because the part of the korean subs that would appear over the black bar are gone? Are you nuts?"
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-21T04:54Z,"Hmm, okay, maybe no one's going to nuke it, but the point is, it's not ""v 10"" as you write. It's not a proper rip. Of course, whaddya expect from some stoners in the Ukraine..?"
,trace535,2012-12-21T06:07Z,"I realize this is subjective, but why do you say the video quality isn't a 10? 1000 kbps is more than enough for 720x304 video using x264."
,carljen,2012-12-21T23:42Z,"thanks for the upload scene4all v 9 a 8
but this movie suck big time"
,steven4,2012-12-23T09:05Z,thanx...

Uncropped. The video quality is good but the audio, oh my gosh..i pity my speakers. Overall, decent quality rip but the audio could have been better."
,egent,2012-12-25T20:40Z,"I wonder for those who always download the movies and write their negatives comments, I wish they just shut up and stop written you are getting the movie for free, all you need to do is say thanks for the upholder and if you want to write something just rate the quality, thatâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s all.
I wish piratebay Admin banned all violators in comments.

Thanks scene4all"
