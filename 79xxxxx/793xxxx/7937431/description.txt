Dennis Hopper, Warren Oates, Peter Boyle: Bickford Waner, an apparently naive young man from Fort Worth, arrives in the tiny Texas town of Dime Box and takes on a variety of menial jobs. Bickford is actually the notorious train robber Kid Blue. Noah Segan loved this movie so much, he took Kid Blue as his handle. Rian Johnson wrote a part especially for Segan in "Looper" and named the character "Kid Blue". And this is the rest of the story.
