,brussell,2012-12-20T22:04Z,the sound is shit and it cuts in and out....
,ZefPrawn,2012-12-22T05:28Z,Audio is ABYSMAL. I'm not going to watch this.
,wanderlustus,2012-12-22T11:41Z,"ZefPrawn is most correct, the audio is so bad we didn't bother watching more than 5 minutes.  Waste of bandwidth and time."
,whateverthefuck,2013-01-05T16:48Z,"V=9 very good for a 720p rip
A=1 Horrible, just horrible; my ears are still ringing with the insane bass. Even at the lowest bass setting of my sound system, it is just barely comprehensible."
