  The Stocking Filler

    Nigella Lawson starts early by filling her shelves with homemade
 Beetroot and Ginger Chutney, Chilli Jelly, Spiced Fruits steeped
 in Ximinez Sherry and Winter Spiced Vodka. Nigella also makes 
 her Christmas 'Puddin' Truffles and Christmas cookies, showing
 that Christmas doesn't have to come off the shelf. Later, Nigella 
 opens her doors to a few friends for a pre-Christmas brunch 
 featuring an Espresso Martini, Triple Cheese and Onion Strata, 
 Glazed and Toasted Vanilla Cake 'Brioche' and an antioxidant
 Fruit Salad.
