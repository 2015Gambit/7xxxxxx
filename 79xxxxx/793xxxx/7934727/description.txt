This is v10.  There are other earlier versions that may or may not work currently.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

KMSnano - is the ideal tool to activate the final version of Windows 7/8 and
Office 2010/2013. Activator does not require user intervention, the entire
activation process takes place in the background, just run the activator
and a couple of minutes to check the activation status of Windows and / or Office.

KMSnano can Activate All Editions Of windows Under Volume Licence

Activates: Windows Vista / 7 / 8 Pro / Enter / N / VL and Windows Server Std /
Data 2008/2008R2/2012, as well as Office 2010/2013.

Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Extract the LaNanov10.zip file.
2. Run KMSnano.exe
3. Make sure to allow the windows firewall to have access.
4. Wait a FEW MINUTES while the files run in the background.
(It doesn't let you know when it's done, you can check task manager or just wait a bit)
5. Run the Check_Activation.cmd to verify your KMS activation status.
6. Go about your business. You can get the watermark to go away by auto-hiding the
taskbar or similar system stuff.

If it does not activate, you probably need to convert your activations to volume licenses.
Extract the kmsnano.exe to a subdirectory and run the convert_windows_retail2vl.cmd.
If that program does not run, there is an error in your data.dat and tokens.dat files.
In that case run the Fix Hacktivations.cmd file.
(This does a SFC scan on all your system files including data.dat and tokens.dat)
It then converts your windows to volume channel.
Rerun the kmsnano.exe once you have successfully converted to volume license.

There's no reason to convert to retail at this time. There are no legit
activation bypasses for retail versions. The only exception being the ProWMC
loophole, which is fairly complicated.

Why use this program over any other activation method?
It does not modify any of your system files.
Because it's not a crack or a hack.
Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?
