Also featuring The Dave Clark Five and singer Jimmy Cliff (pictured above). 

This was around the time that Dave Davies of The Kinks 
was trying to put together his first solo album.
He didn't actually do that until 1980 but in the late 1960s 
he put out some singles that wound up on Kinks albums, and in 
this and another Beat Club he performed two of them.
