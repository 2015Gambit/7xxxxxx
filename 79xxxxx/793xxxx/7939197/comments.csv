continuing what i talked about in the comments of issue 1, i noticed a specific out-of-context phrase in this issue's script: ""new universe"""

,Devastation101,2013-01-01T07:41Z,what program do i use to view this?
[T],GIANNIS511,2013-01-03T13:24Z,Well you can use comical. At least that's what I use.
