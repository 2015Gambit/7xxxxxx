Description:
Black Dahlia is a point-and-click puzzle-solving adventure based loosely on the unsolved California murder of Elizabeth Short. Taking place in the 1940s, the game puts the player in control of rookie government agent Jim Pearson, whose first case involves investigating Nazi propaganda. The case is not as simple as it sounds, however. Before long, Jim uncovers information and evidence that the Nazis have connections to the supernatural, occultism as well as some very bizarre and ritualistic killings. Jim meets Elizabeth Short who possesses a strange engraved stone known as the Black Dahlia, an artifact coveted by the Nazis as a source of ultimate power. When her brutal murder occurs, the stone disappears. During Jim's search for the missing item, he uncovers a web of evil, deceit and intrigue.
