From Wiki:


Eric Patrick Clapton CBE (born 30 March 1945) is an English guitarist and singer-songwriter. Clapton is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist, and separately as a member of The Yardbirds and Cream. Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time.[1] Clapton ranked second in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"[2] and fourth in Gibson's Top 50 Guitarists of All Time.[3]

In the mid 1960s, Clapton departed from the Yardbirds to play blues with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. In his one-year stay with Mayall, Clapton gained the nickname "Slowhand". Immediately after leaving Mayall, Clapton formed Cream, a power trio with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist Jack Bruce in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and "arty, blues-based psychedelic pop." For most of the 1970s, Clapton's output bore the influence of the mellow style of J.J. Cale and the reggae of Bob Marley. His version of Marley's "I Shot the Sheriff" helped reggae reach a mass market.[4] Two of his most popular recordings were "Layla", recorded by Derek and the Dominos, another band he formed and Robert Johnson's "Crossroads", recorded by Cream. A recipient of seventeen Grammy Awards,[5] in 2004 Clapton was awarded a CBE at Buckingham Palace for services to music.[6] In 1998, Clapton, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, founded the Crossroads Centre on Antigua, a medical facility for recovering substance abusers. 


Unplugged 1992

Unplugged is a live album by Eric Clapton released in 1992.[2] It was recorded live in England for the MTV Unplugged series and includes both the hit single "Tears in Heaven" and a heavily reworked acoustic version of "Layla".

Clapton performed the show in front of a small audience on 16 January 1992 at Bray Film Studios in Windsor, England. In addition to the final album tracks, the performance included early versions of "My Father's Eyes" and "Circus Left Town" along with "Worried Life Blues and an impromptu version of Rollin' and Tumblin'."[3] Clapton played a Martin 000-42 acoustic guitar for much of this performance, and in 2004, the guitar sold for $791,500 (┬ú434,400) in auction.

Clapton earned six Grammy Awards for the album including Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Best Rock Male Vocal Performance and Best Rock Song.[10] "Tears in Heaven" earned three of the six awards.[10] The album reached number one on the Billboard 200, and has been certified Diamond by the RIAA for shipping over 10 million copies in the United States.[11] In 2000 Q magazine placed Unplugged at number 71 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums. In October 2011, the album was ranked number nine (between Iron Maiden's Fear of the Dark and Stone Temple Pilots' Core) on Guitar World magazine's top ten list of guitar albums of 1992.[12]

Commenting on the popularity of the album in his 2007 autobiography, Clapton wishes the reader to understand its great emotional toll, and suggests that they visit the grave of his son Conor in Ripley in order to do so.
