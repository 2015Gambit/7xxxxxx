Mark Lamarr's Rhythm and Blues Christmas (Acrobat) [FLAC] {MKOP}

With Shake, Rattle And Roll, The Beginners Guide To Reggae and Alternative '60s under his belt, Mark LamarrΓÇÖs current Radio 2 slots are the self-explanatory Shake, Rattle And Roll and GodΓÇÖs Jukebox, an eclectic mix of hip hop, funk, country and gospel. Mark is also regularly called upon to present a radio show on Christmas Day and it is the R&B, blues, doo wop and jazz element of that show that is reflected in this selection of favourites drawn from his own collection.

The RavensΓÇÖ ''White Christmas'' and Mabel ScottΓÇÖs ''Boogie Woogie Santa Claus'' reached #9 and #12 respectively on the R&B chart over the 1948 Christmas holiday period; Felix GrossΓÇÖs ''Love For Christmas'' and The OrioleΓÇÖs ''What Are You Doing New YearΓÇÖs Eve?'' both peaked at #9 a year later; and ''Far Away Blues (Xmas Blues)'', which featured Little Esther and Mel Walker singing with the Johnny Otis Orchestra, was a #6 hit in 1950. The remainder of MarkΓÇÖs selection is a mixture of familiar names (The Moonglows, Joe Turner, Jimmy Witherspoon, LightninΓÇÖ Hopkins and Louis Armstrong, among others) and a smattering of less well known artists, all conspiring to make your seasonal holiday a Rhythm & Blues Christmas to remember.
