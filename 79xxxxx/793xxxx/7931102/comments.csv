,tommybertsen1,2012-12-18T00:49Z,"if you cannot upload ur own torrents , why re-upload someone else's ? If my internet was better  i would make my own packs to upload, not steal others' work! This is not fair cooldude187, I suggest you delete this torrent. "
,jdveraser,2012-12-18T08:49Z,"at least when ARMANI ploads, he puts the names of the files somewhere in the description or comments. how is anyone supposed to know what they're getting? effin chode..."
,jdveraser,2012-12-18T08:51Z,btw i just checked your torrents and at least 9/10 are re-uploads with credit removed. fake ass....
,zippyhd,2012-12-18T18:11Z,What is up with this survery crap to get a password to unlock the archive?  take that shit someplace else and get the fuck outta here!
,chop007,2012-12-21T19:36Z,"Yeh, watch out for this knob, he is doing the same with win7 software etc etc. Sometimes the software name does not even match the image example of the software. Very suspicious, I would not touch this guys torrents even if it was the end of the world, again. "
