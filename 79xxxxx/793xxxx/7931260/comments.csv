[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-26T01:48Z,"While ""The Scene"" enforces it's MP4 mandate (note that DVDrips by ""The Scene"" are still almost completely XVID AVI if less then 720p), somebody's gotta keep reality off of life-support.

I keep suggesting a lifting of that mandate, if only to stop the near avalanche of pixelated (due ENTIRELY to CPU intensive x264 on-the-fly encoding) ... ahem ... crap that completely belies their only reason for said mandate - quality.

Went from lurker-leech to Prince of my own little niche. The pink and then green skulls completely floored me. I'd've thunk that my irascible nature (exemplified above) would have precluded me from receiving such honors. Still wondering how long I can be a vocal thorn before I get the boot. Then I take a vacation from all this hard work and a more respectable pirate steps up to take my place. Where-oh-where is that longed for savior of mine? Sigh ... nose back to grindstone. The mark of a good soldier is his ability to rag mightily on the system which supports his endeavors.
