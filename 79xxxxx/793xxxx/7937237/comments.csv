Thankyou so much have been following all the other instructions and could not get it to work. Anybody experiencing any problems follow MusicTime's instructions. They work perfect. 

Thanks"

INSTRUCTIONS

install APK, dont open! then create this folder if it doesnt exist:
sdcard/Android/data/com.rockstargames.gtavc/files

On your PC, rename the .obb file to .zip, then unzip and copy contents to the /files directory from above. 

Play Game!




Dunno about any of the above comments, this is what ive always done and its always worked perfectly."
,jdoggg211,2012-12-26T19:02Z,"GALAXY S3

Install APK, dont open!

navigate to sdcard/Android/data/com.rockstargames.gtavc/files          or create directory in /data if doesnt exist.

On your PC, rename .obb file to .zip, then unzip and copy contents to /files  that you just created.

PLAY GAME!


Works every time, dunno about above instructions on other phones, this has always been the way ive done it on my s3 and its never failed."
,moeburn1,2012-12-27T16:19Z,"Tried jdoggg211's instructions, MusicTime's instructions, nothing works on my Atrix.  I either get an ""XAPK validation failed"" error, or a ""Download failed because you may not have purchased this app"" error.  

Way to crack, guys."
,TorrentRating,2012-12-29T05:12Z,"Holy fucking shit moeburn1! It's EASY!

Download the torrent. There will be an APK that you install. DO NOT RUN THE GAME.

NOW take the OTHER God damn FOLDER that comes in the torrent. Move that entire FOLDER named com.rockstargames.gtavc to your tablet. You want to put it into the ""android"" folder on your tablet's SD card. Look for the ""obb"" subfolder INSIDE THE ANDROID folder. It MAY already exist there but If the ""obb"" folder does NOT exist there, create it and place the whole com.rockstargames.gtavc FOLDER inside. Now you can run the game.
It does work, but whether it will run properly on your tablet, is to be seen."
,moeburn1,2012-12-29T12:00Z,"yep TorrentRating, did exactly that, thats what gave me the ""You have not purchased this app"" error.  I did already have an obb folder, thanks to another game already installed, and I placed the entire folder in there.  Then I install the APK and run the game.  Why you would do it in the other order is strange.  By the way, an Atrix is a phone, not a tablet, although quite capable of playing more graphics-intensive games than this.  I think my problem lies in the apk installation - it doesn't install like other apks with a dialogue, progress bar, and the option to run at the end of installation.  after running the apk, i just get a message that says it 'installed successfully', and i have to go looking in my app drawer for it."
,moeburn1,2012-12-29T12:03Z,"i should mention i did try doing it in your order first, installing the apk, then copying the folder over, then running the game, but that didn't work either."
,odbyd,2013-01-04T23:21Z,works ok on my xperia u. i followed MusicTime's instructions
,DS1997247,2013-01-04T23:44Z,"Works quite well on my Nexus 7, though I'm a bit disappointed about the performance, I've expected more FPS on the highest resolution from a Tegra 3 device :"
,DS1997247,2013-01-04T23:46Z,Try to install the apk first and only then move the SD DATA stuff to your device. See if it helps :)
