"This is my comedy show that I recorded April 20, 2012 at the Tabernacle Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia.

It was all professionally filmed and edited by my friends at PositiveImage Video, and I paid for the entire production and editing myself.

That shit ain't cheap, so please don't illegally download it.

Following Louis CK's lead I have made this available for what I feel is the very reasonable price of $5.00, and if this self distribution thing goes the way I hope it will, I would like to release one of these this way every year or so, depending on my personal schedule and when I feel the material is "ready."

A huge thank you to everyone that was in the crowd that night, it was a fantastic audience of enthusiastic awesomeness. I can't imagine it could be possible to have better crowds than I've been enjoying these last few years, and I want you all to know that I appreciate the fuck out of it, and it motivates me to produce more work like nothing I've ever experienced in my life.

We're all on this crazy, fucked up ride together, my friends, and I couldn't be happier.

Enjoy the show, and I'll see you dirty bitches on the other side.

Much love,
Joe"
