,pryingeyes,2012-12-18T02:44Z,No reason to clutter up this site. Free and very quick download from google: http://www.gbooksdownloader.com/gbooksmac.dmg
,ClubQBall,2012-12-19T01:13Z,"@pryingeyes - Hey, asshole?  When YOU elect to upload a tool, application, or software package to share with others, then you'll have the right to criticize.  Otherwise?  Sit the fuck down, have a Coke and a goddamned smile, and SHUT THE FUCK UP.

Who cares if it can be found elsewhere???  Say fucking 'Thank you for your efforts, cooldude187"" and move the fuck along.

Fucking ignorant assholes, I swear to fucking God."
,ClubQBall,2012-12-19T01:14Z,"@cooldude187 - Hey, man ... I, for one, really appreciate the upload.  Thank you for your efforts.

Pay no attention to ass-clowns around.  They're a dime-a-dozen and most of 'em haven't uploaded shit.  "
,pryingeyes,2012-12-19T02:42Z,"@foul-mouthed morons who don't understand how a torrent site works:

I've uploaded more here than you could ever dream of, and I've been here for years, and I clearly know a little more about this than you do. But go ahead in your fantasy realm if you'd like. Maybe there, you can find the OP, who in addition to having no concept of how to contribute here, also isn't seeding. So enjoy watching your client sputter at zero on this one. In the time it took you to look up each word in order to post your comments, you could have downloaded the file you're after a hundred times.

I repeat: This file is instantly available for free directly from google. Uploading freeware here, when it can instantly be found at the source, is absurd and only serves to clutter this site. And uploading a torrent file and then not seeding it is nearly as stupid as coming to the pathetic defense of someone who does.

Run along now. Some day you'll understand. And thank me. Until then, go download some more rated-E games and have your little fun."
,ClubQBall,2012-12-19T03:21Z,"@shit-for-brains, know-it-all-fucks:

Who gives two shits' worth of stink WHAT you think, know, or do, really?  Your profile here shows you've uploaded SHIT, fuck-nuts:

http://thepiratebay.se/user/pryingeyes/

ZERO.  NADA.  NYET.  NEIN.  NOT A GODDAMNED THING, PUSSY.

So shut the fuck up and go fuck with someone else, asshole.

You are not a fucking God.  You are not a Moderator.  Hell, you pussy motherfucker, you ain't even a man, so shut the fuck up, go hump on your Momma's fat, greasy thigh some more, and shut the fuck up already.

Who gives a rat's ass if it can be found elsewhere?!?!?!  The point is, dipshit:

WELCOME THE NEW PEOPLE AND SAY ""THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS.""

Man, fuck you AND that sway-backed nag you rode in on, you dumb-ass hillbilly motherfucker."
,ClubQBall,2012-12-19T03:24Z,"Oh ... and pryingeyes?  Word to the wise, son.  There's always someone bigger, badder, smarter, and meaner than you, silly motherfucker.  I ain't sayin' I'm that person, but still ... 

YOU AIN'T SHIT.  So stop actin' like a bad-ass on here and leave the new people alone.  If you've been around as long as you claim, you know this Site is about SHARING ... even IF it is redundant.

Eat shit and die, eh?  =)  Bye, sweetpea.  Tell ya Momma that I'll be over later after your Daddy goes to work."

Works like a fucking charm, people. =)

cooldude187?  Many thanks again, bud.  

pryingeyes? SHUT THE FUCK UP, YOU SILLY PIECE OF SHIT."
,117olddude,2012-12-19T15:52Z,"Excuse me, but why so much anger and swearing?  I hear that tone and those words in my classroom all the time, and it's always silly teenage posturing.  Does that kind of behavior belong here?  If you disagree with someone, simply say it and move on.  If you had thanked the OP for his upload and left it at that, you would have made your point.  The rest of what you wrote is just... infantile.  And I have to assume that you would never dare talk to someone like that face to face.  So please don't do it here where you feel safe in your anonymity.  It doesn't reflect well on you."
,ClubQBall,2012-12-20T01:49Z,"@117olddude - Out of deference to your moniker, I'll say it like this:

You really have no clue as to what has gone on before between myself and pryingeyes.  You see it for what it is here.  While I appreciate your perspective, it isn't really needed, to be honest.  I am quite capable of handling myself in an adult manner because I *AM* an adult, thank you very much.

I don't recall actually soliciting your - or anyone else's, for that matter - opinion, so why you felt the need to post *your* OPINION about something that wasn't even your business to begin with is beyond me.

As they say, sir, mind your own business and you won't have any issues with me ... or any other individual.

And as far as how I would conduct myself in person?  I am who I am.  I neither require nor do I need your opinion of my character, thank you very much.

So, please, take your own UNSOLICITED advice and ... well, sir, MOVE THE FUCK ON.  =)  This doesn't concern you.

Have a wonderful day."
,ClubQBall,2012-12-20T01:53Z,"And by the way?  WHO CARES HOW IT REFLECTS UPON ME HERE?  You folks are nothing more than faceless entities spread all over the world.  LMGDFAO.  You'll never meet me nor will I ever meet you ... thank God in Heaven above, so please ... spare me the lecture, old man.  I really have no desire to hear YOUR ridiculously judgmental and heavy-handed condemnation of what doesn't even concern you in the first place.

What a pompous, egotistical, moralistic ass you must be in real life.  Thank God I have a different perspective.

But again ... thank you for your UNSOLICITED opinion.  =)"
,117olddude,2012-12-20T15:56Z,"Seriously?  What an unpleasant person you show yourself to be.  All I suggested was that you comport yourself in a ""civilized manner"" in a public forum.  Whatever your history is with the other poster, your language is out of line and your anger is stunning.  And now, with no history between us, you start with the ""f-bombs"" with me.  There was nothing pompous about my post in regards to your lack of civility.  These are public blogs and the least you could do is act accordingly.  As to ""unsolicited"" advice, when you start spewing your vitriol you are going to get a response.  Which, I suppose, is your desire.  In a setting such as this, with no moderators, you can get away with this behavior.  On any site that is moderated, you would not.  

As to your attempts to paint yourself as a free-thinker, unconstrained by the feelings or opinions of others, you sound like a spoiled child.  The world is full of other people, all of whom have rights and opinions and, for the most part, civility.  You apparently feel that you are the only sentient person alive, or at least the only one who counts.  I've got a bulletin for you: you aren't.  And you look and sound like a fool here in these posts.  Throttle it back, read what you write before pushing the button to send, and consider the effect your words may have.

As to insults, I'm fully capable of cutting you into little pieces here WITHOUT using bad language.  I'm making a choice to act like an adult.  You should try it.

Oh, and happy holidays to you, too."
,ClubQBall,2012-12-21T02:24Z,"(YAWN.)

Finished preachin' yet, Gramps?  No?  Alright, I'll be over here fucking Grandma up the ol' Hershey Highway ... she likes it that way, by the way. 

Go away.  Mind your own business.  Go masturbate to little boys, small animals, or whatever it is that you fucking do for jollies, you pious prick.  

Otherwise?  Just shut the fuck up.  PLEASE?  You're boring me to tears here, Daddy-O.  I mean, seriously, what's it to you anyway?  Who the fuck are YOU to sit in judgment of ME ... or anyone else, for that matter, you nosey ol'  ignorant fool?  I mean, what the fuck ... got a hero complex or somethin', Dad?  Wanna stomp out all manner of evil, chaos, and vile language?

Or are you just some pathetic, lonely, overweight, four-eyed know-it-all sittin' in the dark with his dick in one hand while he types puerile responses to another faceless entity on the anonymous World Wide Web.

I pity you.  Greatly.  Go get a life.  Or die.  It's your choice, old man.  But you have no beef with me.  I don't know; don't care know you ... and even IF I did know, I'd probably stomp the shit out of you for being such an egotistical, self-righteous, judgmental ass.

I wasn't even addressing you in the first place until you came along and butted your fucking ass into my conversation with that other dense motherfucker.  You're just some random shit-for-brains who craves a little bit of attention and reciprocity.  Well, congratulations.  You got some.  Now ... go away and speak no more, ""olddude"".

Don't you have a little boy or two to fondle and grope?

Fucking idiot.

,117olddude,2012-12-21T04:12Z,"And a hearty Merry Christmas to you, too.  Your mind is a fetid swamp.  And I say that with all possible charity.  It sounds like you spend a lot of time thinking about ""deviant"" sexual behavior you can do with/to people and children.  While I have no issue with your fantasy life, I sincerely hope you keep your behaviors in your mind, and not with actual people.  

As to any beef I have with you, no, no beef.  I merely had the temerity to call you on your boorish behavior.  If you can't stand someone pointing out that you are acting in a really unpleasant manner in a very public forum, stop acting like the fool your posts paint you to be.  

Your talking about ""stomping the shit out of [me]"" is pretty funny (you are making assumptions about me based on my writing style and site name.  Never a good idea).  Also a cyber threat.  You might want to watch that kind of talk.  As to the rest of your latest post, you sure make a lot of assumptions about your right to be unpleasant here.  A loud-mouthed cyber bully is not really ""scary.""   You don't scare me or anyone else here with your foul mouth and your twisted imagination and threats.  What you really sound like is a scared teenager who sits at home watching porn, playing violent video games, and imagining that he can take on anyone.  When, in reality, you are just a poor, scared little kid.   So, one last time, just grow up, act like a civilized person here (where the rest of us are behaving ourselves), and accept the fact that this persona you present isn't working.

Oh, and a Happy New Year to you as well."

Shut the fuck up and speak when you're spoken to, genius.  Go slap your pathetic, shriveled cock against some washed-up, dried-up whore down on Main Street, sport ... you want none of this, so disappear.  Go fuck a goat or something ... do what you do best, you needle-dick motherfucker.
