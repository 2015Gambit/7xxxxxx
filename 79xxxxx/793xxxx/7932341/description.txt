Activate and re-activate with any kms server by typing
the following commands in admin command prompt:
SLMGR -SKMS xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx
SLMGR -ATO

Insert an actual online KMS server there, don't just
type x's. Search web for online kms servers.

--OR--

Use the KMSNano program.
You will need to extract the kmsnano.exe file with winrar or 7zip
and run the convert_windows_retail2vl.cmd or fix hacktivations.cmd
try the convert first. If it doesn't do anything, run the fix.
Then just run kmsnano.exe and wait a few mins (theres no progress
bar or completion windows) Check task manager or run the
check_activation.cmd after a couple mins.
