For the fifth game in a series, Conflict:
Denied Ops sure doesn't show any signs of
evolution. This may actually be the simplest
edition of the shooter franchise that developer
Pivotal Games has produced, with gameplay so
out of date that it might as well be wearing a
plaid flannel shirt and listening to Alice in
Chains. But even though the action is a good
decade behind the times, the game's rapid-fire
pace blurs the fact that you're shooting the
same bad guys over and over again. Cooperative
play is a highlight and earns the game some
applause all by itself given how this shooter
feature is so often asked for and so rarely
delivered. This mindless shooter is ideal for
those moments when you want to switch off the
synapses, though some awkward control issues
occasionally get in the way.
