A true collaboration between Capcom and its fans for Mega Man's and Street Fighter's 25th Anniversary, Street Fighter x Mega Man was created and developed by Singapore native Seow Zong Hui (aka "Sonic"), with an original soundtrack by Luke Esquivel (aka "A_Rival"), and with support provided Capcom, Street Fighter X Mega Man stars the Blue Bomber as he goes toe-to-toe with some of Street Fighter's most beloved characters complete with their own individual themed stages and boss battles. Jump, shoot, and use your special new Street Fighter abilities to defeat your foes and become the world's strongest robot!

Street Fighter X Mega Man is a classic Megaman game. The platforming title features all the familiar jumping and shooting mechanic that we know and love, but now our blue hero will have to face off against Street Fighters characters as bosses. Mega Man will have to beat them, steal their power, and beat up some more to advance.
The game deftly blended elements from both original titles, with an appropriately retro soundtrack that will please both old and new fans alike.
