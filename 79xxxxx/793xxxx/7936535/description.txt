ItΓÇÖs the Merc with a Mouth in a pulp caper filled with lies, spies and shapely thighs, courtesy of Mike Benson & Adam Glass (Deadpool: Suicide Kings, Luke Cage Noir) and Laurence Campbell (Punisher)! Wade Wilson. Codename: Deadpool. HeΓÇÖs the CIAΓÇÖs deadliest agent. HeΓÇÖs also certifiably insane, suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder and haunted by the ghosts of his past. In other words, heΓÇÖs the perfect soldier in a Cold War where itΓÇÖs impossible to tell friend from foe and reality from a lie. Wilson is also the only one capable of hunting down a rogue CIA agent and recovering the stolen nuclear suitcase sheΓÇÖs carrying before she hands it over to AmericaΓÇÖs enemies. But who is this femme fatale and why has she turned traitor? And is Deadpool crazy enough to survive or will he become trapped in a web of international intrigue?
