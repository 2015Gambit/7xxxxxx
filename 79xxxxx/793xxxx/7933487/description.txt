Unlawful Killing is a 2011 British documentary film, directed by Keith Allen, about the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed on 31 August 1997. It was financed by Mohamed Al-Fayed and Associated-Rediffusion and premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.

It argues that the British and French authorities have covered up uncomfortable facts about the crash, accuses Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret of being 'gangsters in tiaras', and alleges that Prince Philip has a 'Nazi background'. It is claimed that the film would need 87 cuts to be screened in the United Kingdom, for which it is therefore not scheduled to be released.[2] However, the director believes that it will make money in America, where conspiracy theories about the Princess of Wales' death remain popular.
