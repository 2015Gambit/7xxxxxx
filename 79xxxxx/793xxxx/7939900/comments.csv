,nyanrott,2012-12-25T15:30Z,"Hello LuxLOL
Can you tell me how to use this file?
it is neither kind of rar file nor zip file. The type of its file appears as 20 file and it is only one file. So how can extract it and use it? Give me some suggestion please."
,LuxLOL,2012-12-25T17:17Z,"It is a .ZIP file that includes an "".ISO"" file and a full ""Read Me"" file (Help file)."

It's a very very easy as ""click click click finish"" process now, and I tried it my self but on another image of XP

go there http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/

download the tool

follow the tool and select to create xp bootable image

this page also has known issues hints to educate you before using this tool, I copied the following part as it's important for XP case

""
The Windows XP Installation from USB option currently works by booting directly from your XP ISO, hence the YUMI menu entry is created under ""Directly Bootable ISOs"". In order for the Windows XP installation to succeed, you must perform the following steps;
1.) To begin an install, select (Stage 1)
2.) Upon first reboot, you must select (Stage 2)
3.) Finally, after (Stage 2) is complete â&#x20AC;&#x201C; upon the second reboot, select (Stage 3) to boot the drive where you installed Windows XP. If this option fails, simply remove the USB and reboot!
