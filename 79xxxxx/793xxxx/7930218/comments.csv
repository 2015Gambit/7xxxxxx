,goldpianogarden,2012-12-17T14:40Z,"I hope I didn't miss your response elsewhere, cause I've been trying to watch for it.....RayCort, is there a reason the sound on these is distorted now? I've followed your uploads for a long, long, long time, and they've always been awesome (can't get Hallmark Channel), and the quality has always been topnotch, but the ones this season (Christmas) have almost all been quite distorted and some are very difficult to make out what is being said.  Unfortunately, most are too new to be able to find subtitles to help the family make out what is being said. I just wondered if something had changed, or maybe a piece of equipment was slowly failing, etc.  It sounds like a radio station that isn't quite tuned fully onto the station, if you know what I mean. Thanks for your response!"
[T],RayCort,2012-12-17T14:48Z,i don't know about the sound. They seem okay when I check them. Almost got me conviced to just stop recording and uploading since you and one other seem to have a problem with my uploads.
,Jewlwhite,2012-12-17T15:52Z,We appreciate what you do raycort. Keep up the good work.  
,bing52,2012-12-17T19:13Z,"RayCort...Just had to let you know that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the sound or picture in any of your uploads at this end.  As a matter of fact, I have downloaded every Christmas movie that you have put on the site.  Excellent work and thank you once again.  "
[T],RayCort,2012-12-17T20:11Z,"@bing52. I truly appreciate the vote of confidence that my uploads are okay.

@ sh1998, Ebbe airs tomorrow 18 Dec and The Three Gifts airs on Friday 21 Dec. Will try to record if I can remmeber and no conflict on other movies being aired at same time."
,tinyangel15,2012-12-18T06:32Z,"Thank You, please keep Christmas comming, don't stop up loading, the quality I am downloading is just fine, its playing on the Pal TV I have. "
,sh1998,2012-12-18T07:01Z,Thanks RayCort!!!  And don't ever stop uploading you are awesome.  I love every movie you put on here.  Thanks so very much
,LJE111,2013-01-01T08:27Z,"I agree the sound in some of the 2012 DL's have been so badly distorted as to make the moves unwatchable. I dumped about a half-dozen and commented on just a few of the specific movies so you could check it out yourself. But I noticed some of your older uploads are fine. I've tried watching on VLC and our HD TV so I know it's not my equipment. (And I'm not having issues with any other downloads.) 

I will DL this one and come back to rate the quality. "
