Here are the three early appearances of the Teen Titans that pre-date Teen Titans #1. And the "lost" (just a retro/marketing ploy) "Giant-Size 1967 Annual" that DC published in 1999.

From Wikipedia:

Original incarnation

Robin (Dick Grayson), Kid Flash (Wally West), and Aqualad - the sidekicks of Justice League members Batman, the Flash, and Aquaman - teamed up to defeat a weather-controlling villain known as Mister Twister in The Brave and the Bold #54 (July 1964) by writer Bob Haney and artist Bruno Premiani. They subsequently appeared under the name "Teen Titans" in The Brave and the Bold #60 (July 1965), joined by Wonder Woman's younger sister Wonder Girl (Donna Troy) in her first appearance. After next being featured in Showcase #59 (December 1965), the Teen Titans were spun off into their own series with Teen Titans #1 (cover-dated February 1966) by Haney and artist Nick Cardy.
