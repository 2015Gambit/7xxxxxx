The Simpsons record-annihilating 24th season starts September 30, with Bart going
through his little black book and finding more young starlets than Warren Beatty
at his prime. October 7, the Treehouse of Horror returns, with Springfield menaced
by a black hole, a demon from Hell, and Marge's old boyfriend Artie Ziff. As the
season continues, the stars of Portlandia, Steve Carrell, Tom Waits, and many,
many surprises help Lisa fend off a terrifying substitute teacher, the Simpsons
repel invaders from Portland and Homer prep for the end of the world - all
