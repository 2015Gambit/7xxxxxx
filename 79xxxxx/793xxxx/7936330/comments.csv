,DEBRATABOR,2012-12-19T13:23Z,"Everything comes with a serious delay - downloading is fine now, but comments appear after some time only."
,doorpro,2012-12-19T13:23Z,"Yes but still not showing up in main search, i'm sure that all will be fixed soon.
Thanks again h20bagger"
[T],h2obagger,2012-12-19T21:32Z,"It does appear that things have been acting a bit ""hinky"" the last couple days.  I'm seeing the same ""interesting"" search results as reported.  Haven't changed anything at this end so all I can recommend is patience and probably pulling out some of your backup / alternative plans. I can assure you folks are still finding their way to the EE torrents, though probably requiring a bit more poking around  to turn them up the last few days.

X'ing my fingers for Thursdays submission, till then cheers."
,DEBRATABOR,2012-12-20T10:31Z,"Thanks h2obagger:-) just keep uploading, we'll find you somehow.
TPB will survive, I'm sure, and we - as you say - have to be patient and resilient, like this site ;-)
BTW- proxy is still working, despite the news it was closed down.
