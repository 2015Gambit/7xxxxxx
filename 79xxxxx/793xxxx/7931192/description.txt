Run time: 100'20 [new extended edit] / 91'12 [original film]

The 2009, all-new edit of the best horror film of the 80's marks its 25th anniversary, and features 9 minutes of restored and digitally enhanced footage, new scenes, alternate takes, longer scenes, a different soundtrack and for the very first time, Johnny Depp's full and uncut death scene fully re-edited into the film, the SPFX of Heather Langenkamp's blue screen footage at last finalized, as well as Craven's original ending the way he wanted it to be seen. Every added shot has been colour-corrected and cleaned, and the film's soundtrack has been completely remastered and reworked. This is a brand new edit done in 2009, not the low-quality 2004 edit previously available. I started from scratch in order to deliver a high quality, coherent and longer edit of the film, finally including some never-before-used footage, making this the ultimate Nightmare edit, completed by a second DVD of bonus materials [cf. details below]. The DVDs include animated menus and chapters.
