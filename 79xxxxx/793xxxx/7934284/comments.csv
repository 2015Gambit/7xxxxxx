,Nanoniano,2012-12-18T14:35Z,What's with this s*it of rar files? Compression rate is unsignifficant and you highly increase the odds of an user deleting one of the pieces; not to mention twice disk usage if you want to watch it while seeding and the time to decompress...
,skwerrel,2012-12-18T20:43Z,And then Nanoniano cried like a bitch.  You can see what files are in the torrent prior to ever clicking the link to download it.  Don't like RARs? Don't download torrents of RAR'd files.  Bitching just makes you look like a stupid bitch and accomplishes jack shit.
