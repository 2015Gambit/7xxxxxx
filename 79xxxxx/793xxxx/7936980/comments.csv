,cliftonenrico,2012-12-19T02:34Z,really...with no seeders? who do you think you're fooling?
[T],STFmaryville,2012-12-19T02:40Z,"the seeders leechers counters aren't working. this torrent is working, and does contain the cover, title page and main story from amazing #700. it's the real thing -- it's been on various websites all day today."
,Keeeeevin,2012-12-19T02:43Z,"I SWEAR TO U!!!!!! These scans including one of Avenging Spider-Man 15.1 are REAL! I swear it....these were gonna be released wed this week BUT.... Marvel holds them back till the 26th, a marvel employee sells both copies (ASM 700+AVSM15.1) for 10 bucks and he sells on ebay... but scans b4 he does! 

This is real... keep any eye out for Avenging Spider Man 15.1 by same scanner here soon!

Ive read both and Read ASM 700 first!

FYI quality is not the best but still readable

Its Real"
,StonedYoda,2012-12-19T03:33Z,It's definitely not a fake. Just read it. Wow. Thanks for the excellent upload.  Can't wait to read the eventual digital scan but this was really decent. 
,cliftonenrico,2012-12-19T03:54Z,"oooh. i didnt know. 
but i'll wait till the 26th for a better scan seeing how its the last asm.
enjoy it."
,BruceWayneJr,2012-12-19T06:16Z,"Thank you. 

And to all the jerkoffs who've read this/read about this: Keep in mind that this is just a storyline. In the same way the Knightfall was a storyline; that the death of Superman was a storyline; that One More Day was a fucking storyline. The status quo will resume, but possibly not as soon as you may like. Don't send death threats, and don't bitch that your childhood has been defiled. DON'T READ IT, if you don't like it, and WAIT for the inevitable return to status quo that comics always brings you."
,Eskostar,2012-12-19T12:18Z,"I'll be taking Bruce's suggestion and stay away from SuperiorSM until they return to AmazingSM numbering or they just reinstate Parker, really have no interest at all on a Spider-Man without Peter. I just hope that this indeed is just a storyline and not here to stay."
,Keeeeevin,2012-12-19T15:11Z,Guys come on...... Its Marvel u know he will be back... they always r.... Mighty Marvel Fashion right?
[T],STFmaryville,2012-12-19T15:15Z,"BruceWayneJr, I think what most people get pissed off about is exactly what you describe. The fact that sales hype is driving a story rather than a good story is driving sales/marketing.

This has been a chronic problem at Marvel ever since Secret Wars!

Readers all know it's nothing permanent but it's what Marvel and DC shit out all the time, for a short-term sales boost and no long-term quality.

""Knightfall/Death of Superman/Clone Saga/Return of Bruce Wayne/Death of Captain America/One More Day/Ultimatum/Death of Ultimate Spider-Man"" examples are perfect!

I, having finally read this one and Avenging 15.1 last night, just think it's a stupid plot.

I agree with you, if you don't like it, don't buy it. But dumbass empty death threats aside, people are entitled to their opinions."
,marvelnerd76,2012-12-19T15:16Z,people are so afraid of change....I think this is a fascinating new development. You know Parker will be back eventually.. Enjoy the ride people...
,JackOmally,2012-12-19T23:01Z,"I have no problem with them not having Peter Parker as spider-man, they have been doing great with Ultimate Spider-man. But this made no fucking sense and now we are supposed to root for the bad guy now. @BruceWayneJr Brand New Day was fucking awful man, and they still didn't really change that. "
[T],MrDowntown,2012-12-20T01:11Z,"I have 2 theories:

First will be proven or disproven next week:

Obviously Peter Will be back. And the fact that they said things like ""Peter Parker had his time"" and ""People will forget him in a year"" its OBVIOUS that they are intentionally stirring up Pro-Peter hype, so that when he comes back, more issues will sell.

So either, he will be back in a year

OR...

The Leaked #700 was done on purpose and is a HUGE misdirection. If so, I will so applaud Marvel if they pulled that off."
