This is the HD video from the first of two concerts given by the Michoacan Symphonic Orchestra (Osidem) at Teatro Ocampo, Morelia, on 15th december 2012, conducted by Mexican conductor Miguel Salmon del Real, disciple of Pierre Boulez and Bernard Haitink. Concert consisted of a performance of the Fantasy for piano, chorus and orchestra in C minor op. 80 and the Symphonie #9 Op. 125 in D minor. This was a superb performance, on which young conductor lead Osidem by memory (not reading the score) and reading in full detail this masterpiece, which was performance on a historic character, such it was performed as a Period instrument orchestra, which means no vibrato and tempi more close to those whishing by the composer. An incredible live performance.
