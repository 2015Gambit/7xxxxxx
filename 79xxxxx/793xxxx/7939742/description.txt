This is direct from Microsoft's web site. I Have my own key and needed to reinstall and found no original versions so decided to go thru all the steps. It contains both 32bit and 64bit in a image format uncorrupted version of MS-Office 2013. You need to either burn image to a disk or use a program such as Winrar, magic ISO or any program which will extract the files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You do not have to download both files unless you want them both. Choose which one you need... 
(MSOfficeProfessionalPlus-2013-_x86_en-us.img---------- is 32bit)
                       
                    and

(MSOfficeProfessionalPlus-2013-_x64_en-us.img---------- is 64bit) 

for those of you who don't know already.
