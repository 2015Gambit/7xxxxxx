,pasillas1,2012-12-17T02:23Z,"this is latino spanish to be exact, the good spanish, looks good for a cam rip and very good audio"
,Vfire27,2012-12-17T02:43Z,i should have took my cam to the theater
,loyis77,2012-12-17T04:39Z,The best and most anticipated film of 2012 and all we get is a Spanish language version so far after 3 days already of the film in cinemas ??? We should had like a million versions out in the web already and instead we only got 1 ??? Why is that happening does anyone knows ?
,k3nd00d,2012-12-17T05:43Z,"@loyis77 
Your list of uploaded torrents here is very impressive. You whiny shitbag."
,loyis77,2012-12-17T07:18Z,"@k3nd00d Did i said i am an uploader my self you stupid asshole ? Do you see me stating anything like that you faggot ? I simply asked the obvious. How come after 3 days of released there aren't any uploaded torrents of The Hobbit ? And only an asshole like yourself answered...
FFS"

,BruceWayneJr,2012-12-17T09:26Z,"padagrad is full of shit, and loyis needs to go out and buy a fucking ticket if piracy isn't moving fast enough for them"
,Elerian,2012-12-17T09:57Z,"@BruceWayne In my country Hobbit will be released on 28th dec and I'd like to watch it sooner. Sincerly, stfu."
,Wave_rider,2012-12-17T10:50Z,"@loyis77, HE who DOES NOT upload has no right to complain. Poop on your shoe you whiny bitch"
,BruceWayneJr,2012-12-17T11:40Z,"Elerian, who was talking to you? Were you the one complaining about the delay it takes for someone to upload a movie to them for free? No? Then why are you taking offense to what I said? ""Sincerly, stfu."""
,iLirian,2012-12-17T12:31Z,I dont care. I know spanish so Im gonna watch this motherfucker.
,kmilito,2012-12-17T17:20Z,I would rather pay and see it on 3d
,iLirian,2012-12-17T20:27Z,"For a cam:

,Djcole,2012-12-24T10:14Z,"I don't speak Spanish but I saw the movie in 3d
opening day. and was surprised to see it here at all after 3 days.. I have to say it's very good picture quality for a cam. I didn't download this one. I downloaded the 1.98 gb file but it's the same rip.   Thanks 0whois0"
