WASTE OF TIME "
,geoffp,2012-12-27T14:56Z,"Okay, listen up. The missing Rdl.dll file is deleted by any decent AV program, because it's a Virus generating tool and classed as the most dangerous version. The option to allow it isn't made - it's automatically removed. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INSTALL A PATCH TO OVERCOME IT! 
Delete the whole program and run a virus scan on your entire system - including pen-drives and other attachable memory devices."
