Leave it to Little Steven to come up with an exquistely hip and fun Christmas set that perfectly balances rockin' chestnuts with deep-vault obscurites. While tracks such as the Kinks' "Father Christmas," Clarence Carter's "Backdoor Santa," and the Ramones' "Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)" are perennial favorites for those who require something a bit more jumpin' than Bing Crosby, the presence of Bob Seger's killer "Sock It to Me Santa" and Keith Richards's "Run Rudolph Run" alone make CHRISTMAS A GO-GO a seasonal must-have. Other stand-out Yuletide jams include Roy Wood's "I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday," Soupy Sales's "Santa Clause is Surfin to Town," and the ridiculously funky "I'll be Your Santa" by Rufus Thomas.
