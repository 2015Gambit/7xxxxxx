[V],ChattChitto,2012-12-18T22:28Z,"@bobn744
DVDFab developers ""Fengtao"" are still supporting and releasing two versions of DVDFab (v8 and v9).
So are we :)"
,bobn744,2012-12-20T00:22Z,"OK, I get it.  On V9, it asked if I wanted to update, I'm guessing that would be a mistake.  I just said no to the update and everything worked fine."
,thepiratedrake,2012-12-22T14:45Z,Thanks ChatChitto!! His / Their torrents are always clean! I still like v8 over v9 (change isn't always good)
,Cunningly_Linguistic,2012-12-23T18:17Z,"Unfortunately when I install this it comes up as Blu-ray-to-DVD option expired. There are also a lot of the other extras that are showing as not being active.

Is there a way of enabling these functions?"
,TONPumper,2012-12-23T23:21Z,Applied crack but it still says that I'm a trial user. Any suggestions? I noticed this occurrence when I updated from 8.2.2.4 to 8.2.2.5 of the program.
,isKizzitto,2013-01-03T14:47Z,"Perfect ChattChitto.

ChattChitto please the song name."
