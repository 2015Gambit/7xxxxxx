,paulbonar,2012-12-19T18:39Z,"This is just a simple question, how does one get a blu ray rip, presumably from the Bluray disc...but not the audio?"
,fiveofseven,2012-12-19T19:06Z,"Blu Ray is in Russian, they synched the English Cam Audio to tide us over until a better option becomes available. Thank you too all who try for us. You do not get the appreciation you deserve. "
,pio2102,2012-12-19T19:23Z,can someone tell me how I can find captions or subtitles for this movie ?
,SugerHigh,2012-12-19T21:18Z,"I dont get it.. Russian or not, the BluRay disc should still contain an English Audio track.

All the DVDs I own, have Spanish Audio tracks on them.. just hit the Audio button on the remote and it switches from English to Spanish.

The Original English track should be on there, its not like the Actors/Actress speak Russian.. movie was filmed in english."

,SugerHigh,2012-12-20T03:51Z,"@optikus165 You use the phrase ""Fo"" and yet call me Dumb? Are you to fucking stupid to include 1 more letter to form a complete word (FOR) or is it just pure fucking laziness?

DVDs/BR released in the US contain Multiple Audio Tracks. The ones in my BR Player has English, French & Spanish. So why is it dumb to assume movie discs released in other countries do not contain the same feature... Now fucking kill yourself you dumb cum guzzling hoodrat, ""fo"" real."

That is one of the differences of the region codes on the dvd, for example their  dvd may have Russian as the original sound and Georgian as an option with no english at all."

,Langham81,2012-12-20T23:54Z,"To all the haters: the critics who panned this movie didn't read the book.  Don't listen to them, this is an excellent film.  If you're on the fence about it I recommend downloading the book.  It's almost a thousand pages and worth every page."
,doug13,2012-12-21T00:08Z,"Fuck you 1000 pages??????
just fuck you"
,Oort_Kuiper,2012-12-21T01:27Z,"lol a 1000 pages?!  No its around 400 pgs.  But its a challenging read I'll say.  Multiple stories from different periods of time with different characters in each of them, it's a bit complex but worth it.  The movie was excellent, Ebert finally got this one right."
,dallek1,2012-12-21T01:52Z,"the greatest movie i have ever seen, can someone explain it to me?"

3) It ends before the actual ending."

,passwordu,2012-12-23T01:03Z,Thanks for the torrent. V7 A7 . I am a bit slow and had to watch twice to get the big picture. The multiple characters roles played by the same actor makes this movie some what interesting and eventually comes full circle. The flow of the movie seems to be in sync. One would have to watch to maybe to determine the story line unless one has read the book. Thanks again
,Kelaro,2012-12-23T03:10Z,"A=3 V=8 The audio is just recorded in a cinema and is quite muffled, parts of it is in russian where they haven't bothered to put the english audio in. There are also moments when there is no sound at all - makes it very hard to understand."
