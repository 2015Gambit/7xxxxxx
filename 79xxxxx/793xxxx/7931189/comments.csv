,bashfullabyrint2517,2012-12-18T02:58Z,great post33
,funseeker521,2012-12-18T06:48Z,I'm DLing the whole season even though it got too stupid for me when Carrie got sent to Beirut in the first episode and what's-his-name got invited into the TAC room even though he was just some junior congressman. I'm hoping I was just having an f'd up day and couldn't do the old suspension of belief trick.
,passionpit,2012-12-18T09:58Z,Thank-you very much VTV.

,imyourfather,2012-12-27T15:38Z,"@harmoniser

have to agree,it's gettin a bit soap series type with all the lovey dovey stuff,get back to the whole point of the show,still love it though but bit more action next series,someone said 4 more seasons how thwe hell are they gonna drag it out that long,get like 24/lost and everyone will just switch off and get bored..."
