,cindy25,2012-12-20T09:25Z,"thanks

its bad enough converting MP4

MKV are worse

saved me a lot of hassle"
[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-20T11:35Z,"MKV is worse than a pain - I'm still looking into the ""frame adding"" problem that affects sync.
.
My current fix is to demux the MKV and then remux to MP4 and then re-encode.
Every encode now I do both the created MP4 followed by the original MKV to compare resultant frame counts. The frames problem seems to affect fewer files than it used to and not this one (both lost two frames in the conversion, which is acceptable).
