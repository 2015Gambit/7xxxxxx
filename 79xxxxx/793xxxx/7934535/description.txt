Cleveland Brown (Mike Henry) and his family and friends are back for more

Cleveland discovers a conspiracy behind hip-hop music; pursues his dream of
becoming a Major League Baseball scout; and befriends the family's new physician,
Dr. Fist (recurring guest voice Bryan Cranston). Also, Donna takes her run for
local office way too seriously, and Cleveland Jr. takes Rallo under his wing
after a lice outbreak at school forces him to chop off his beloved 'fro.

Cleveland discovers that the food served at the local homeless shelter
is much better than it is at home, so he pretends to be homeless to
benefit from the meals. But when the community catches onto his
ill-spirited scheme, they confront him and he must apologize to everyone.
Meanwhile, chauvinistic storeowner Harris Grundle (guest voice Offerman)
hires Roberta as a Christmas elf but requires all of Santa's female helpers to
don sexy costumes. Later, Kendra saves Christmas for the children of Stoolbend.
