,burt007,2012-12-17T07:52Z,People have warned a million time to countless uploader not to zip. But even-than you always find uploaders zipping them. What if somebody only wants one of them? he still has to download the whole thing. Can't you upload without zipping or zip individually and upload? 
,burt007,2012-12-17T07:55Z,and how about the list of all of them?
,burt007,2012-12-17T08:22Z,"you can upload at this site as well. Millions of technicians from all over the world come here for their needs, and all types of service manual and schematics are here and this site has been around for many many years. I am sure a lot of people will appreciate it.
