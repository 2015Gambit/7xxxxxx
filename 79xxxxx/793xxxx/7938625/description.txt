The Dark Ages have been misunderstood. History has identified the period 
following the fall of the Roman Empire with a descent into barbarism - a 
terrible time when civilisation stopped. 

Waldemar Januszczak disagrees. In this four-part series he argues that the Dark 
Ages were a time of great artistic achievement, with new ideas and religions 
provoking new artistic adventures. He embarks on a fascinating trip across 
Europe, Africa and Asia, visits the world's most famous collections and 
discovers hidden artistic gems, all to prove that the Dark Ages were actually 
an 'Age of Light'. 

In the final episode, Waldemar looks towards the north of Europe. The 
Carolingians saw themselves as successors to Rome, reflected in their art. 
Elsewhere, the Vikings were constructing long ships with intricate decoration 
and marking their territory with powerful rune stones. And on the British 
Isles, the Irish and Anglo-Saxons were creating unique works of manuscript 
illumination and remarkable jewellery.
