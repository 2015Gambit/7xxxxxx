Have you ever wondered how one day the media can assert that alcohol is bad for us and the next unashamedly run a story touting the benefits of daily alcohol consumption? Or how a drug that is pulled off the market for causing heart attacks ever got approved in the first place? How can average readers, who arenΓÇÖt medical doctors or Ph.D.s in biochemistry, tell what they should be paying attention to and whatΓÇÖs, well, just more bullshit?
 
 
Ben Goldacre has made a point of exposing quack doctors and nutritionists, bogus credentialing programs, and biased scientific studies. He has also taken the media to task for its willingness to throw facts and proof out the window. But heΓÇÖs not here just to tell you whatΓÇÖs wrong. Goldacre is here to teach you how to evaluate placebo effects, double-blind studies, and sample sizes, so that you can recognize bad science when you see it. YouΓÇÖre about to feel a whole lot better.
