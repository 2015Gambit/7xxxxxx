Summary:

This story is told by a man named Han Byeong-tae (or Pyongt'ae), recalling his memories when he was in 5th grade.
Due to Byeong-tae's father failing in business, they move to a low town and go to Y Elementary School. There, he meets Eom Seokdae (or Om Sokdae), a president of the 5th grade and one who holds everything in his grade, more than his teacher. However, it is really Eom Seokdae forcing students by force to follow him. Byeong-tae fights Soekdae's reign, however, every student supports Soekdae. Therefore everything goes wrong for him; his parents misunderstand him, his grades go down and his power rankings also go down. Hence he loses, gives up, and goes under Seokdae's power.
After, Seokdae gives him a great treatment. First, he restores Byeong-tae's power rankings to even higher than before. Second, he makes everyone play with Byeong-tae so he is not alone. Byeong-tae also gets his grades back up. At this point, the narrator begins have mixed feelings for Seokdae, ranging from gratitude to fear. "I was thankful to Seok-hyen. But when I think it back, those things were the things I had lost to Seokdae. He has just given it back."
But when Byeong-tae goes to 6th grade, Seokdae's power breaks, due to the new teacher who has sensed there is a strange distribution of power among the classmates. Seokdae, leaves the school and is last seen by Byeong-tae, saying, "Do it well."
The story zooms to the present. Byeong-tae's riding the train to where Seokdae is living to get a face of him. On the train, someone is being dragged by polices and is surprisingly Eom Seokdae. However, he does not recognize Byeong-tae.
