Overview
ΓÇ£No writer better articulates ourinterest in the confluence of hope, 
eccentricity, and the timelessness of the bold and strange than Paul 
Collins.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöDAVE EGGERS

On Long Island, a farmer finds a duck pond turned red with blood. On the 
Lower East Side, two boys playing at a pier discover a floating human torso 
wrapped tightly in oilcloth. Blueberry pickers near Harlem stumble upon neatly 
severed limbs in an overgrown ditch. Clues to a horrifying crime are turning 
up all over New York, but the police are baffled: There are no witnesses, no 
motives, no suspects.

The grisly finds that began on the afternoon of June 26, 1897, plunged 
detectives headlong into the eraΓÇÖs most baffling murder mystery. Seized upon 
by battling media moguls Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst, the 
case became a publicity circus. Reenactments of the murder were staged in 
Times Square, armed reporters lurked in the streets of HellΓÇÖs Kitchen in pursuit 
of suspects, and an unlikely trioΓÇöa hard-luck cop, a cub reporter, and an 
eccentric professorΓÇöall raced to solve the crime.

What emerged was a sensational love triangle and an even more sensational 
trial: an unprecedented capital case hinging on circumstantial evidence 
around a victim whom the police couldnΓÇÖt identify with certainty, and who the 
defense claimed wasnΓÇÖt even dead. The Murder of the Century is a rollicking 
taleΓÇöa rich evocation of America during the Gilded Age and a colorful re-
creation of the tabloid wars that have dominated media to this day.

Editorial Reviews
James McGrath Morris
Paul Collins engagingly recounts the press's obsessive pursuit of the story, 
the unlikely alliances that eventually led to the apprehension of the suspects 
and the trialΓÇª[he] has crafted a work that won't disappoint readers in search 
of a book like Erik Larson's The Devil in the White City.
