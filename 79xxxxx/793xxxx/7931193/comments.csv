[T],yerisan710,2012-12-17T08:33Z,ScreenShot......?????
,MVC78,2012-12-17T08:37Z,Spanish is the language of love
,Music_Is_My_Life,2012-12-17T16:28Z,"Thanks for the up! Finally someone who posted a legit version of this! Shame that it's in Spanish though. Only thing we need is someone to go to the movies and record the english audio, then add it to this video. Then of course, upload it."
,pokerplayer74,2012-12-17T22:07Z,"Is this something you just ripped from someone?
Reason I ask is that you are Swedish and you upload a version dubbed to Spanish. Does this mean that we wont see a English version from you?

Thanks for the effort though - but I have to have it in a language I understand. "
,Mordor64,2012-12-17T23:53Z,"Yes, it is in a Latin based language (probably Spanish).  The Video and Audio is not that good (for a CAM), but it is watchable.

I heard a lot of bad reviews of how boring it was.  From what I can see here, it is not and I cannot wait to go see it in a theater!  Thank you Happy Viking!

,Kingman_Arizona,2012-12-18T00:30Z,Can't we all just get along togeather ... Chill out - If you don't Speak Spanish - download elsewhere..
,peachville,2012-12-18T01:33Z,"""This film needs no explanation because all waiting for it."" 

Thanks for the upload but most of us would truly appreciate the 2 extra seconds required to let everyone know the spoken language is SPANISH."
,ippiki,2012-12-18T20:13Z,Good job trying to fool people into downloading your garbage torrent by leaving out the fact that it's in fucking SPANISH. -1
,Zarthusta,2012-12-22T23:01Z,"AMAZING!!!!! great job and many thanks Happyviking Im definitley going to see it in the theaters first and wait for an english torrent but unbeleivable to see the hobbit already as a torent download.
