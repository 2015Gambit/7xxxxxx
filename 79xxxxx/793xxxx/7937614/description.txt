SUSPIRIA: RESTORED & PRESERVED [HD 1080p DTS] 
Dario Argento's masterpiece restored to its original look.

Of the many home-video editions of SUSPIRIA released to date, none was true to the film's original sound and visual presentation. The best, and most faithful, was the 2001 Anchor Bay DVD set. Unfortunately, even this suffered from very poor encoding, featuring a truncated soundtrack with missing sound effect and music cues, and sometimes inaudible dialogue. All the recently released Blu-rays and DVDs were created using a horribly recoloured and over-contrasted print, approved by the either senile or greedy director of photography, Luciano Tovoli. The resulting product was a shameless, revisionist, absolutely unwatchable mess, and was severely criticised by casual viewers and fans of SUSPIRIA alike [more on these awful Suspiria releases here].
Following the 2011 "Restored and Preserved" DVD Internet release of SUSPIRIA, this new 35th anniversary preservation edition - released in 1080p format - was redone from scratch, and improves dramatically on the original release. The intent is to present Argento's masterpiece the way it was meant to be seen back in 1977 at the time of its release. Using the best elements from various sources [SD and HD], the film has been restored shot by shot to its original colours, tints and contrasts; the sound mix has also been carefully recreated and restored, and is presented in its original 4 tracks audio mix through digital DTS encoding [audio track 2]. A brand new reworked 5.1 DTS mix is also included [audio track 1].
As a respectful fan of the film, and of its masterfully innovative visual and sonic design, I consider this HD preservation to be the best and most authentic version available so far, and a must-see for all fans of SUSPIRIA.
