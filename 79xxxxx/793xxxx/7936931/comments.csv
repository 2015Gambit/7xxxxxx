And even though I would rather not have my 5 years+ of work distributed for free, I can't force you to take it down. So I just ask that you check out my website + Bandcamp. I have tons of music out there, almost all of which is free to listen, and I sell my albums at low prices for lossless FLAC.

If you like the music, the best way to support me is by buying it legitimately... thank you!

Please stop wasting your hard earned cash on people who claim they are artists out there and don't actually ""create"" their music from the heart. If you're here, you obviously don't intend on spending any money on the album but please at least show your support  at:
http://www.zirconmusic.com/
http://zirconstudios.bandcamp.com/

...and you can always donate $1 or $2 (won't brake your bank).

God Bless You Andrew & Jillian, Merry Christmas!"
