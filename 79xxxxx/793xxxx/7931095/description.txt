WARLOCK WISHES


And we went to the mountain
A few of us had not survived
The witch told us to carry on
So we counted up till five

Tell me why, my love, is there so much pain?
Tell me why, my love, did we live in vain?

There were caves and grizzly bears
Who had been the formal heirs
There were bad signs all along
But we knew that we were strong
(But we knew that we were strong)

Tell me why, my love, is there so much hate?
Tell me why, my love, did we trust our fate?

Soon we found the castle there
And it made us tremble in fear
And the wizard spoke to us:
"Have you come to die, thus?"

We tried our best, lo, to advance
But we did not have one chance
And the wizard spoke again:
"Fulfilled be your wish, then"

Tell me why, my love, is there so much time?
Tell me why, my love, does the sun not shine?



RAG RUG


Some go silent when something goes astray
I cannot but think what may



CALIFORNIA ROAD TRIP


Our friends, they're all waiting for us
We are going to California, thus
So we're racing through Nevada fast
And leave the desert in a blaze of desert dust

Want to see the ocean that is blue
In the past days, heat was the only colour we knew
There is one fact: "The sun is shining", and that is true
And now this verse is ending too.

COINS


Some people go around town
Pickin' up coins
Drinking coffee with their boys
Some people go to places, places unheard of
Where they've set up races

Girls in the sunshine, in the sunshine

Some girls go around town
Pickin' up boys
Playing with their toys

Some people go around town
Pickin' up coins



GONE BACK


Light like fire
I'm gone, I've gone back
Light like fire
I'm gone, I've gone back

Early morning
The time has come
Run together
We'll die, so long



WHERE PEOPLE PUT PLANES


I've got a place to liiive
Where I escape the beeeeees
Somewhere along the coast line
People would say it's fine
I choose radical high time
Where my fears never ceeeaaase
Janitors live at eeeaaase

Summer just never eeends
Where the wild garden grooows
Somewhere along the right line
Everyone says we combine
People choose radical high time
And loneliness never shooows
Because I'm the last one who goooeees
Where literal feathers arooose, yes, they will
