Solar Mamas follows the remarkable story of Rafea, a mother-of-four from Jordan 
who challenges the status quo of her traditional marriage by travelling to 
India to train as a solar engineer for six months. Along with 27 other mothers 
and grandmothers from poor communities around the world - many of whom are 
illiterate - she will learn the skills needed to bring electricity and light 
back to her village.

For Rafea, it is a life changing journey. As the second wife of a Bedouin 
living in a remote part of the Jordanian desert, she has had limited 
opportunities in life. Now she has been selected to attend the Barefoot College 
in India run by the inimitable Roy Bunker. Alongside women from Kenya, Burkina 
Faso and Colombia and across cultural and language divides, Rafea needs to get 
to grips with electrical components, circuit boards and soldering. Her new 
knowledge will see her do things she never imagined, but it will also have an 
unanticipated effect on her relationship with her patriarchal husband.

Addressing themes of education, gender equality, environmental sustainability 
and development, the documentary takes an inspiring and compelling look at 
poverty - and the ways women around the world are working to pull themselves 
out of the poverty trap.

A BBC Storyville film, produced in partnership with the Open University, it 
screens as part of Why Poverty? - when the BBC and the OU, in conjunction with 
more than 70 broadcasters around the world, hosts a debate about contemporary 
poverty.
