,Walmut90,2012-12-17T16:14Z,Fake wrestling sucks!!! UFC is the shit!!
,Walmut90,2012-12-17T16:16Z,"Typical Monday Night RAW: Talking, some tan guy enters, talking, some cheesy music plays, more talking, another tan guy enters, talking, someone gets picked up and ""slammed"" in the mat. FUCK THIS SHIT!!! ITS FUCKING BORING"
,Walmut90,2012-12-17T16:17Z,"Thing is, they are supposed to be total badasses, and with the exception of Brock Lesnar I would have kicked all their asses in a real fight. GROW UP BITCHES"
,Walmut90,2012-12-17T16:20Z,"This aint sports
This aint entertainment
This aint sports entertainment

What is it then?

ITS FUCKING BORING AND LAME AND FAKE AND REQUIRES NO SKILL"
,.Leto.,2012-12-17T16:40Z,Video quality is really average. RUDOS 700x400 releases were far superior to this.
,Excising,2012-12-17T17:00Z,"lol , why are you watching it then ?? geeez"
[T],SecTPB,2012-12-17T17:02Z,"The first match with Rey/Sin vs. Damien/Cody suffers from disconnection errors from the user's Open Box AVerMedia PCIe capture card. The person capping had to disconnect the USB and the signal was lost, and lots of error messages popped up on the screen, interfering quite a bit. There's also a ""Record"" logo stuck in the corner for the entire thing, but it's not that intrusive at all. Source is SkySports HD, but the encoding settings for the AVC profile being used was not well-done and video suffers mass pixelation and color distortion. Resolution of video is only 400p, which is a non-traditional SD resolution. If the broadcast is HD, the SD encode should be the highest SD resolution of 480p with a bit higher bitrate. I highly suggest downloading another low quality copy or simply downloading it in 720p. Regardless, thanks for the upload and time, whoever did it. You do need a better capture card and should record the show as a base file of 720p @ 60FPS or 1080i if your card can't utilize 60FPS. Makes for smoother transitions when encoding it to 29.970FPS or below if you use a proper b-frame pyramid in your h.264 settings. "
[T],EvilCraze,2012-12-17T17:20Z,"This Is The Worst Pay-Per-View Ever , Sincara And Rey Mysterio Lost , Sheamus Lost , Team Hell No And Ryback Lost , Aj Lee Made Cena Lose MITB Title . Fuck this Payper view Just Fuck IT !"
,cool-arrow,2012-12-17T18:20Z,"To all the assholes who insist on spamming this thread, here's an idea: if you don't like it, DON'T FUCKING WATCH IT.  And you might try minding your own fucking business and not worrying so much about everyone else's.  Have a nice day."
,ReliableMike,2012-12-17T18:22Z,This was actually one of the best PPVs of the year. Team Hell No + Ryback vs. The Shield was the best match I have seen in YEARS. Literally. Like maybe the last 3-4 years. It's was AMAZING!
,.Leto.,2012-12-17T19:35Z,"I have to agree with Walmut90 and EvilCraze, this PPV was a total joke. So lame, so boring and so stupid that I skipped everything. Not surprising though, WWE has been dead for years. Only a 10-year-old kid could be excited about this. "
,DeanMasta,2012-12-17T20:16Z,Thanks for the spoilers
,AlexLibman,2012-12-18T05:38Z,@Walmut90 - it's the fakeness that makes it fun.
,sittinginabunker,2012-12-18T11:32Z,"thanks for the spoilers EvilCraze, ya fucking tool"
,solutioN-Ghost,2012-12-18T14:15Z,"whats with the annoying pop ups that occured randomly like : 

""USB device connected""
""Device speed blah blah blah....""

:|"
,Wahab_Minsate,2012-12-18T14:48Z,"@scene4all Where is the WWE.TLC.2012 720p

,free117ny,2012-12-18T23:22Z,"****VIDEO IS OUT OF SYNC, CONSTANT CABLE POP UPS, BREAKS INBETWEEN MATCHES DUE TO USB PULLS***

Sorry but this encoding SUCKED!"
,notalright17,2012-12-19T03:47Z,"all in all decent quality d/l. The first match is pretty messed up and missing a minute or more but its rhodes scholars so who cares. too many pop ups on screen its a little distracting 

a/v 8/7"
,sittinginabunker,2012-12-19T07:50Z,wow at the haters... hell no vs the shield was one of the best matches EVER... reminds me of the attitude era
,sahilrox,2012-12-19T15:12Z,"As the rest said : Shield vs Hello No and Ryback was the best match in over 3-4 years....Rest were close to trash......This match should have been the main event. Btw, why was entire Brooklyn over excited about Ziggler?"
