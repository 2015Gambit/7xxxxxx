PREMIERE: Monday December 17, 9 

Kim, though newly out of rehab, plans a trip to Vegas for her son's 21st birthday -- and neglects to invite Kyle. Meanwhile, the fallout from Brandi's revelation about Adrienne continues, and it is not pretty. Angry that this happened at an event of his, Mauricio doesn't want Brandi to come to Kyle's upcoming dinner party, but it's too late; she's already invited. At the party, Kyle's friend Faye demands to know why Brandi said what she did, and won't accept an explanation until Brandi departs in tears.
