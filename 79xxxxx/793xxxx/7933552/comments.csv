RayCort: I have never said anything negative against an uploader in my many years on Pirate Bay because I generally appreciate the time they take to upload. I have to make an exception here because these are such a waste of time and bandwith to download.

Every single Hallmark & Lifetime Christmas movie of yours that I recently uploaded (and unfortunately I downloaded a lot of them before checking the quality - my bad!) is distorted and the sync constantly drifts so badly that these movies are utterly  unwatchable. They look and sound a lot like a cam -- a really, really bad cam.

There is something terribly wrong with the way you are recording these. At the very least turn your audio down - this alone could eliminate the distortion. (I don't have a clue why they were all so badly out of sync). 

 Please either do it correctly or stop! Other good uploaders see that you have uploaded these movies so they don't bother -- and everyone loses the opportunity to see some wonderful movies in a quality that is watchable. 

If you disagree with my assessment then at the very least upload a sample so people can decide for themselves... or better yet - try watching then yourself."
,jawick9,2012-12-25T05:17Z,"LJE111,  what is wrong with you?  Of course, these aren't Blu-ray/HD copies, but they are definitely watchable.  

Before so rudely complaining, why don't you see if it is your video player that is not properly working with the files RayCort took the time and energy to upload for all of us here!  Judging by the fact that it is only you having these serious problems (I certainly am not with the videos that I have watched from RayCort), you might want to try a different video player.  The KMPlayer is a really good one that I've never had a problem with.  VLC media player is also another good one, but make sure they are up-to-date.


And, thank you, RayCort, for taking the time out of your busy life and graciously providing these fine family movies to those of us who can't otherwise see them this Christmas season.  
Thanks again, RayCort.

Merry Christmas to all!"
[T],RayCort,2012-12-26T12:20Z,"@LJE111, I check them before uploading and feel they are okay, granted not HD, but watchable, and sound is in synch using Avidemux 2.5 that automatically synch audio an video. If you are having problems, you may want to check your player, you are only ONE that has complained, and well I can't please everyone, so STOP downloading my stuff if you feel they are a waste."

I agree with LJE. The audio was so bad that we couldn't watch it, both on my computer as well as my LG TV. The same goes for about 8 of the most recent Hallmark stuff Ray has uploaded. :-("
,jawick9,2012-12-27T17:24Z,"I find it quite odd that StanCanada would post exactly the same thing as LJE111 with the exact same warning and audio and video ratings.  

Could they be one and the same?"
