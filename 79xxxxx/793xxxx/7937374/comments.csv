[H],shirepirate,2012-12-27T14:25Z,"make sure you follow the instructions correctly and copy to the correct folder. if it doesn't recognize that there is SD Data already on the device then you may have screwed something up. if it doesn't launch at all the game may not be compatible with your device.

follow the instructions to use an unpacker on the android device, it takes forever to copy the folder over from computer to device but copying 1 packed file is quick and easy."
