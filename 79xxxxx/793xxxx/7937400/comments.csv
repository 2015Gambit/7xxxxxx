The season 3 uploads ended after the winner was announced in episode 10.

However, there have been 3 more episodes.

11 - Masterclass - Paul and Mary take over the Bake Off tent to show how the technical challenges should be done.

12 - Bake Off Revisited - where Contestants from last year's competition talk about their experiences about taking part.

13 - This upload - the Christmas Special.

I can not find episodes 11 or 12 anywhere.

If anyone has these, can you PLEASE upload them.  Thanks in advance.

Thanks again Sir Isaac for this upload!"
