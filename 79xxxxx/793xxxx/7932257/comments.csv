,Stymieblue,2012-12-17T23:15Z,"I will let you know as soon as I find the keygen, which incidentally wasn't included, and if it was...it's hidden"

it's in the Air folder. However, as it says in the description- a virus program (in my case AWG) will see it as a threat. If you can ignore the threat it will be in the Air folder.
All of the Studio One torrents come with a keygen that I can't seem to get to work- Mac or Windows. Really, if you just use Reaper none of this is necessary :)
Curious to see if this work s for anyone."
