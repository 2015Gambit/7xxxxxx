Of course the Idiot Right doesn't see it that way but as many have pointed out, they are bad at math and refuse to acknowledge that facts are facts.

As Obama pointed out just a couple of days ago... in the '80s he would have been considered a moderate Republican rather than a Democrat... he is NOT a rabid Left-winger or we would have had Single Payer healthcare at least on the table for discussion, etc."

,nbrazil,2012-12-19T06:13Z,"Bill, Obama lies. He has never spoken more than five minutes publicly without lying. When he made that claim every conservative listening broke up laughing at the audacity of the claim. In the 80s Obama would have been considered what he is, a commie in all but name. He has surrounded himself with people who were once openly commies or mentored by same.

Obama has repeatedly disregarded the Constitution. And you believe those on the Right are math impaired? Ask Obama what happens when the interest on the national debt exceeds GDP. Or you can just wait a while, because that is where we're heading. Hint: There isn't infinite money, no mater what class warfare claims you try to make. You could seize the assets, not just tax a bit more but take everything, of the hundred wealthiest Americans and it would not cover Obama's spending for a year.

But math doesn't matter when your goals aren't concerned with solvency."
