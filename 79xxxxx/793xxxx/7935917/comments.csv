,Damitttttt,2012-12-18T20:25Z,Seriously why do the two part stuff at least warn us write it in the title.

A/V - 10/10
M - 8.5/10

One of the best horror and thrillers in a while....

And here we again with unworthy twarts who complain about 2 files.....

Ok Read This :

Uploaders get this shit for you. They put their ass on fire to escape  the authorities, encode to a downloadable size with awesome quality and never fucking ask you for money. They themselves spend money and time for us and unworthy people like whoever is behind Damittt name discourage them day by day. What has the world come to.....????"
,LegoLazze,2012-12-19T18:34Z,"don't like two files, download another torrent

as simple as that


I myself prefer the two file system so thank you extremezone for this one"
,MrIks,2012-12-19T23:51Z,Thx extremezone !
,X-Bit2011,2012-12-20T02:51Z,"two files? Better than a hundert files in rar format... just a joke for some veterans here ;-)

Thanks EZ, good work as always!"

,since1871,2012-12-20T05:45Z,nice! TY EZ
,nvmyrx,2012-12-20T09:00Z,"another 10/10 for extremezone - movies not bad, had the potential for one of the scariest bad-assed bad guys off all time (think pennywise the clown only darker) but then they went and put a lame twist in at the end. Still give it a 7/10 though as far as horrors go"

Draggy for me...not enough bite to it.  Awesome upload though as always.  "
,kjhgviyvoiyoi,2012-12-20T16:00Z,"Thanx.
I am wondering actually also why one part in the CD format. Long time now since I saw any CD's.
It's like when you guys split bigger files into 1.44mb files 20 years after I saw my last floppy.
Can't you explain instead of calling people faggots, jews, niggerlovers and such when we ask you something?"
,Loner12,2012-12-21T04:31Z,"Hate 2 files videos, hard to get subs for or should I say very hard. But I really shouldnt be complaining since Xtremezone never lets anyone down. But yerh one file is better nevertheless good quality audio and video but the subs included doesnt have english so anyone want english subs will need to find it themselves. Great torrent still"
,Loner12,2012-12-21T04:35Z,"I usually cant find subtitles for 2 file videos but this one was quite easy so no dramas. Great movie, hope they make this a series. It has potential"
,chernye,2012-12-21T06:34Z,"the movie is not even scary, just sad."
,GetMeSome,2012-12-21T07:58Z,"If yer so obsessed about it being in one part, merge the dang files yerself ya lazy arse and don't forget to share. :p"

,KCAtBat2012,2012-12-22T15:52Z,"Great Movie and the A/V is also great as always expected with extremezone BUT slightly disappointed with the movie being in 2 halfs and, for some reason, when I use my regular programs I use to combined separate clips like this, it shrinks the screen resolution immensely.  To say all of this is to say, other than that small inconvenience which, considering it is FREE, is more to tell people what their download will look like than conplaining, the movie and torrent are very good in my view."
,WinkyPirate,2012-12-25T13:41Z,Thank you.

,mwalsher,2012-12-28T18:48Z,How can this be a DVD rip if the DVD is not out until Feb.19.2013? Is it actually a screener?

,jak41497,2013-01-02T05:50Z,"Good Quality, slight buffering, but it was a good torrent"

,jak41497,2013-01-02T05:51Z,"Good quality, slight buffering in a couple of spots. Good torrent though. Thanks man"
,Government10,2013-01-07T02:54Z,"Dont like 2 files?

-Get any editing software and merge both files together...  render it.
-add both files as a playlist on whatever media program you use.
-download a different torrent

Bitching about it in the comments aint gonna get you one single file.

Thanks EZ...  yet another great torrent."
