,conziyus,2012-12-19T19:59Z,What does cropped mean in context to Movie rips? 
,vonerik,2012-12-19T20:09Z,Cropped normaly means that the original size of the picture has been cutted/edited.

Judge Dredd is an age old comic book from up around the times of ""phantom"" and conan comics and was intended for little kids as something different. If you think this movie is bad then I hope you didnt see the Sylvester stalone's judge dredd back in the late 80s or you would have jumped off a roof.

This one is just a remake of that movie and for the other CRAP remake FEST thats going on for e.g Predator remake and total recall remake (ugh) this one does way better than those x.x

Otherwise video quality was excellent. The cropping is not much of a factor other than preventing a few 'focus' shots of gore/injuries that normally would shown at the bottom of the screen.  But the surrounding shots (before/after) offered enough to compensate.

The movie itself (plot, acting, etc.) was much better than I expected.  Pretty violent though. "

just check for yourself: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113492/

SO, there is not any reason to put a 3D beside the title DREDD to differentiate it from the Stallone film, being they are titled totally different. In addition, the Stallone film has (1995) tagged with it and the other, being currant, (2012) will be tagged to it.
There is a 3D version of DREDD at the IMAX theaters, but at the regular theaters, it isn't in 3D, or at least not in the area I live in. Why would someone upload a 3D version of ANY movie, much less this one. If you do not have the right Flat screen and/or the right 3D glasses to accompany the flat screen, then it would look like crap. Just lift your 3D glasses off at the next 3D IMAX film you goto and that is what it will look like to watch a CAM of a 3D movie. I guess one could upload the BLU-RAY 3D home version, but the the same would be true for all those without the right ""REAL-3D"" glasses. (some glasses are passive, and some have a wire that connects to the TV and are considered active in that they need some kind of signal from the TV to create the illusion of 3D), I hear these suck but have not tried them. I have tried the passive or ""REAL 3D"" (that's a brand name or trade mark) and they work great. It is the ""REAL-3D"" that is used when you see a movie in the theater in 3D.

As to your comment:

""why isnt this at number one in movie downloads?????????"".

Well there are many who just didn't like it (the plot) but most are not happy that the bottom 1/5th - 1/6th of the screen is cropped. It was done to ""remove"" the hard coded sub titles, but I, and apparently many others, would rather have the ENTIRE movie shown as part of the movie between the subs and behind them are  parts the uploader decided we didn't care if we missed that visual data. Can't WE (all the members and guests) crop those subs out if we want? He made that decision for us like we are to dumb to crop  it our selves and that we all must like it how HE watches movies (the uploader)
I do appreciate his time and effort, and had it not been cropped, it would have been in my view as a great upload, but thats not the reality 
.  There are lots of FREE apps to crop a movie so why do so many unloaders make all kinds of adjustments to a DVD or BLU-Ray DVD when, (In my humble opinion), they should upload a movie as is. don't crop it, don't change the contrast or brightness or esp the color saturation and hue. 
THIS is the reason it isn't the highest rated or considered the best move or even in the top 10, as a movie missing @ 1/5th to 1/6th throughout the entire film IS NOT getting a full download. "

Maybe  the uploader added that as part of the description to identify it better?? not sure though but without the PASSIVE 3-D glasses, and the right display it would look terrible and blurry."
