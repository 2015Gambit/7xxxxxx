,Skram0,2012-12-19T04:04Z,"As much stuff as I download, I'll definitely be buying this Blu-ray, probably two, one for my brother. It will go good with my Baraka Blu-ray. I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. I suppose that's nothing when you remember it took them over 5 years in 25 countries to film.

I totally recommend buying this BR and to support the crew's hard work."
,HerrNiIsson,2012-12-19T22:27Z,Amazing! Will a full Blu-ray ISO be available?

,closin99,2012-12-22T05:16Z,"It is visually stunning very well done.
But hard to know where those places are as there are no narration or commentaries or subtitles."
,cropereza,2012-12-28T00:39Z,"@skramO That's my comment also... i just want add one big thing about SAMSARA, IT WAS FILMED with maybe best camera in the world.. THAT's so important because of picture quality .. It was filmed on 70mm film role. That's equivalent of 8k pic rezolution. That mean the picture is 4 times bigger than full HD (1080p) and caught mililon times more details than fullHD cameras.. I just bought 46 inches flat screen led TV and blu ray player.. for that occasion--  Now i just wait SAMSARA BD... DEFINETELLY MASTERPIECE OF FILM INDUSTRY"
,Fuzi0719,2012-12-28T18:08Z,"This is an amazing, beautiful film.  This copy has excellent picture and sound quality.  Great job, thank you!"
,Namarin,2012-12-29T11:58Z,Can anyone know who have a soundtrack to this movie? It's breathtaking.  
,Skram0,2012-12-30T06:52Z,"http://barakasamsara.com/updates/samsara-soundtrack-now-available-download-itunes

I really wanted to see this on the big screen. And I guess there's still time.

""SAMSARA was photographed entirely in 70mm film utilizing both standard frame rates and with a motion control time-lapse camera designed specifically for this project.  This camera system allows perspective shifts to reveal extraordinary views of ordinary scenes.  The images were then transferred through the highest resolution scanning process available to the new 4K digital projection format that allows for mesmerizing images of unprecedented clarity.  SAMSARA will be a showpiece for the new, high-resolution 4K digital projection, the HD format, as well as standard digital and film projection."""
,.KRAAG.,2013-01-02T22:44Z,"Haa, seeing familiar Fricke fans faces on the comments. Just dropped in to leave feedback on encode.

NO SUBTITLES! = guessing where they filmed each scene. Can someone post a link if they find any good synched english subs?
