Set in a futuristic 2002 (um...?), uber-nerd Trent Johnson (Tom Byron) spies through his binoculars the girl of his dreams, his next-door neighbor, Nevada Green (Renee Summers), having sex with another man. He's heartbroken. When his parents (Tracey Adams, Joel Holzman) leave on a weekend trip to grandma's house, Byron sees it as the perfect opportunity to invite Summers over. She isn't much interested in nerdy Byron's romantic overtures, that is until he mentions that his father has a time travel machine. Before long she's arriving at his door, and they are setting off on a journey backward into time, beginning with a drive-in circa 1955 where they observe a couple making love. Blasting forward into the sixties, they observe the free love culture firsthand. Later, complications arise when Byron discovers that the red-haired college student he impregnated on a jaunt to 1985 (in a bid to make Summers jealous) was actually his mom. Hey, oops! As he and Summers endeavour to make things right, a romance soon develops that promises to change both their futures.
