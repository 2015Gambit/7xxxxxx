We all know the type. Jerry, who badmouths his boss behind every chance he gets. Passive-aggressive Barb, who listens to her supervisor's instructions with glazed eyes and then goes about things her own way. Or loutish Archie, who seems to think that putting Playboy centerfolds up in his cubicle is a form of "creative expression." They're the people that make getting the job done difficult for everyone. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Handling Difficult Employees is packed with dozens of failsafe techniques for responding to problem workers appropriately and effectively. It gives managers and supervisors advice on everything from negotiating a dispute between two or more workers, to working out a fair punishment and appeals policy, to safely and legally discharging an employee who's just not working out. Plenty of real-life examples speak to the kind of human resource problems that managers face everyday, and show the way toward a more harmonious, collaborative, and productive work environment.
