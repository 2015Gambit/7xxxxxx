IMDB LINK
A re-creation of the original version of this great British 80's horror film, aka the "Cannes Cut", using exclusive original film elements, completed by a couple of quick shots only used for the international market, all remastered. This fan-edit only differs for about 30 seconds with the released version(s), but it's mostly a good excuse to watch this rare British film in great quality, as it was never released on DVD, and the VHS has been long out of print. Sources used: a brand-new original transfer of a 16mm print of the "Cannes Cut" (original reels), and the Russian VHS of the film, only used for a couple of additional shots.
