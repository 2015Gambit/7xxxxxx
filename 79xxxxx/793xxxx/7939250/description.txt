Book Description
Expert F# 3.0 is about practical programming in a beautiful language that puts the power and elegance of data-rich functional programming into the hands of professional developers. In combination with .NET, F# achieves unrivaled levels of programmer productivity and program clarity.

Expert F# 3.0 is:
- A comprehensive guide to F# by the inventor of F#
- A treasury of F# techniques for practical problem-solving
- An in-depth case book of how F# applications and of F# 3.0 concepts, syntax, and features

F# isnΓÇÖt just another functional programming language. ItΓÇÖs a general-purpose language ideal for solving real-world development problems. F# seamlessly integrates functional, imperative, object-oriented and query programming styles so you can flexibly and elegantly solve any programming problem. F# 3.0 combines this with the seamless data-integration capabilities of F# Information-Rich Programming. Whatever your background, youΓÇÖll find that F# is easy to learn, fun to use, and extraordinarily powerful. F# will change the way you think aboutΓÇöand go aboutΓÇöprogramming.

Written by F#ΓÇÖs inventor and two major F# community members, Expert F# 3.0 is a comprehensive and in-depth guide to the language and its use. Designed to help others become experts, the book quickly yet carefully describes the paradigms supported by F# language, and then shows how to use F# elegantly for a practical web, data, parallel and analytical programming tasks.

The worldΓÇÖs experts in F# show you how to program in F# the way they do!

What youΓÇÖll learn
- Explore F# and its features quickly and thoroughly in the introductory chapters
- Use F# with matching technologies including SQL, LINQ, ASP.NET and REST
- Build reactive, asynchronous, and distributed web applications with F#
- Interoperate with F# from other languages, especially C#
- Integrate data sources and services using F# 3.0 Information-Rich Programming
- Test, profile, and performance tune F# applications
- Create mobile applications, both web and native

Who this book is for
Expert F# 3.0 is for anyone interested in state-of-the-art programming for solving real-world problems. Programmers of all backgrounds will find it engrossing. For C#, Java and VB programmers, F# provides invaluable insights into the future of these languages. For lovers of Python, Ruby and other dynamic languages, F# shows how you can get most of the benefits of these languages while keeping strong types and good performance. For educators, F# is the answer to a decades-long prayer: a language based on strong computer science concepts that also excites and empowers, not just in the classroom, but also in the real world.
