Was wondering if anyone knows if there are scenes with non-english dialogue?  There's no srt with this, but I just wanted to check so I can wait to get some necessary subs to hardcode if I have to...just for non-english parts if there are any. Thanks"

Its hard to make a follow up to taken, and its not the same class as the first one but still decent."
,lporiginalg,2012-12-22T00:57Z,"Video is fine but audio is out of sync from the very start. 

Movie lacks all the sincerity that made the first one decent."
,libertaswv,2012-12-22T02:33Z,"@lporiginalg - I encoded to disc using convertX and i'm watching it as i type.... i'm 10 minutes in and the sync is either perfect, or so slightly out-of-sync as to be imperceptible. I'm a real dick about sync problems - very picky - and i'm detecting no problem at all. Might change, but ""from the very start"" is bs, at least.

I'm getting a fairly regular glitchy noise (like a brief electronic squelch sound) every 30 seconds or so, but that might just be the burn. I have another copy burning now and will check it to see if the sound repeats (and anyone queuing up to make 'people still burn?' comments... yeah, they do, because they like to share with people who only have dvd players) 

 -- just checked the 2nd copy...same problem. Could just be my encode (doubt it, but could be). If people are making archive copies for themselves though, i'd check it first to make sure it's up to your own standards. 

Sincere thanks to the uploader and all seeders and leechers... Much appreciated! Happy holidays to all, whatever you celebrate... Even if it's just time off"

,penfold22,2012-12-22T06:22Z,"Just finished watching. Audio was perfectly in sync from start to finish, and I didn't notice any glitches. Couldn't ask for a better copy.

As for the movie, no it wasn't as good as the first. Plot is stretched a little thin at this point, but it was still entertaining. Not sure if I'd watch a third one, though."
,TruckerRich,2012-12-22T19:28Z,"I have been dling for sometime now. I seem to be having trouble with this one. I have dl it 2 times and still have the same problem. The sound track has glitches from start to finish. Every second there is a glitch. It appears that no body else is having this problem, since there are no comments of this nature. All of the other torrents I dl today were perfect. The only trouble was this one. Any ideas?"
