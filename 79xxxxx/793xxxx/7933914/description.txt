#298 - Dennis McKenna, Brian Redban [64k Time Warped]

Dennis Jon McKenna (born December 17, 1950) is an American ethnopharmacologist, author and brother to well-known psychedelics proponent Terence McKenna.


This is the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast #298 64k Time Warped version. Time warped means the audio is played 38% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)
The reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.
