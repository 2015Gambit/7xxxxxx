,Naralli15,2012-12-21T03:14Z,"Perfect quality. However, the film glitched 4 times. I always play my films with VLC. My computer wasn't doing anything in the background so something must be wrong with the file. Aside from that, the quality is perfect! Thanks :)

,Sifu73,2012-12-22T00:30Z,I watched this also with the VLC Player and saw no glitches whatsoever!  I don't know what Naralli15 is talking about except to say that this isn't typical quality of an IceBane post!  There no glitches with thwe video that I saw and I just finished watching it in it;s entirety!!!
,Naralli15,2012-12-22T03:42Z,Perhaps my computer was running something in the background. I checked the file with VLC where the glitches occurred and there were no issues. So I take back my previous statement :)
