With many cities around the globe bursting at the seams, town planners are starting to create smaller lot sizes with which to accommodate our growing populations, while at the same time avoiding environmental impact on our rural spaces. As a result, architects and designers are pushing the boundaries to make best use of the available space. In this book, we take a look at some of these solutions and help you to think outside the square, to create a house that is both aesthetically pleasing and practical for modern living.
