"Race to Nowhere" is a film that calls us to challenge current thinking about how we prepare our children for success. Named by TakePart.com as one of ΓÇ£10 Education Documentaries You DonΓÇÖt Want to MissΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£Race to NowhereΓÇ¥ brings communities together to spark dialogue and galvanize change in AmericaΓÇÖs schools.
 
Featuring the heartbreaking stories of students across the country who have been pushed to the brink by over-scheduling, over-testing and the relentless pressure to achieve, ΓÇ£Race to NowhereΓÇ¥ points to a silent epidemic in our schools. Through the testimony of educators, parents and education experts, it reveals an education system in which cheating has become commonplace; students have become disengaged; stress-related illness, depression and burnout are rampant; and young people arrive at college and the workplace unprepared and uninspired.
 
Shown nationwide and internationally in more than 5,000 schools, universities, cinemas, hospitals, corporations and community centers, ΓÇ£Race to NowhereΓÇ¥ has become the centerpiece of a nationwide, grassroots movement for the transformation of education.
