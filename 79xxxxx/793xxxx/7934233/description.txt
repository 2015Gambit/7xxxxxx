The crew becomes divided as Asa and Reza draw a line in the sand over GG's behavior at the pool party. Asa tries to solve her money problems with an outrageous new business idea that's so crazy it might just work and GG's plans to become a business tycoon are derailed when she and her sister have a nasty fight. Reza is increasingly disillusioned with what he sees as MJ's character flaws and their friction sparks into a potentially friendship-ending fight.

You are not my customers and I have no obligations to provide bigger files or upload them to any schedule.I do this because I am a generous person but my generosity has its limits.Thank you and enjoy the show
