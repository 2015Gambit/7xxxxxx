,PurityDeath,2012-12-09T04:55Z,"Good quality video/audio. 100% enjoyably watchable.

Looks more like 720 with a slight downgrade to video quality and goes out of whack when you skip around like some video does but never looked out of synch.

Some asian subs at bottom but English language spoken and they're not too much in the way.

Didn't watch it yet but it looks fun.

Overall V-9 A-10 for me since it sounds good enough and is synched."

,OSUpig,2012-12-09T22:02Z,"thanx for the up, yo"
,PurityDeath,2012-12-10T08:55Z,"I thought it'd be fun but it was pretty bad. A shoddy recap of the dubbed asian wirework import days. Those were what WTC enjoyed though and I know it's what they were shooting for. Comes off a bit like Evil Dead.

It had a couple of decent moments and overall it was ""good enough"" to watch to the end but it's a far removal from the path Bruce Li's led us down. Don't expect the realistic fighting of Blood Sport, Ong Bak, Chocolate, The Raid and it's a far cry from the interesting Wuxia of Hero, House of Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.

Thanks for the upload though. :) I really wanted to see it even if it didn't quite reach the levels I was hoping for."

,jalucian,2013-01-08T06:55Z,"PurityDeath, what do you mean ""Looks more like 720?"" 1080p and 720p are resolutions, meaning window sizes. Sounds like you're mistakenly thinking those in some way reflect quality. They don't. The quality comes from the bitrate, which can be anywhere from perfect to complete shit in both 1080p and 720p, depending on what settings the encoder uses. But this is indeed 1920x1080, which is 1080p resolution. I'm constantly surprised at how many people don't seem to know the most basic of terms..."
