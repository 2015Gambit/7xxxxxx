,phase700b,2012-12-10T16:11Z,"That's some serious hi res audio, thanks! I was wondering if you have that Supertramp Live in Paris 1979 disc. I have the DVD but would love to see it in higher resolution. Thanks again Marcus."
,marcus100868,2012-12-10T19:55Z,"phase700b,yes i have Supertramp Live In Paris '79 has also got Great Audio dts Hd master 96kHz i also ripped it in m2ts file because when i did it in Mkv the audio was dts 96/24 bit which is still good.Once the Neil Young is done i will upload it."
,phase700b,2012-12-10T20:59Z,"Sounds great! You're right, DTS 96/24 still sounds super. It's crazy how long it took to release that. I don't think it was ever out on VHS, DVD or any other media until this year. It's kind of the Holy Grail for Supertramp fans."
,marcus100868,2012-12-10T21:47Z,"phase700b,yes you're right only this year. I still listen to album on vinyl love it!!! "
,phase700b,2012-12-11T01:29Z,Same here. We still get the vinyl out every once in a while.
