[T],prodallasosoft,2012-12-09T07:28Z,So far I am able to connect  http://thepiratebay.se/ here in the U.S. As always I block all incoming or outgoing traffic. We now have a 1-800-report your local pirate # here being broadcast on local TV. As always Thanks to the hard work and effort. May God watch over all the good pirates out there. Happy and safe holidays to the BAY crowd
