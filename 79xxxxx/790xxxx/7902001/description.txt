Ford Theatre were one of the most promising and best US psychedelic bands of the 60 ΓÇÿs. A few months after truly excellent Trilogy For The Masses debut LP (from December 1968) they released another concept album for ABC Records - Time Changes. Influenced by the recent works of The Beatles, The Byrds and Love, this slightly more commercial and unjustly underrated record was a kind of musical based on one manΓÇÖs life. The music itself was very diverse, ranged from dark, atmospheric and ambitious tracks full of hard rock guitar-organ interplay, to much lighter sounds usually coupled with lush sound of strings. This record (an early production by Bill Szymczyk) is specially recommended for those who like classic 60ΓÇÖs rock sound.
