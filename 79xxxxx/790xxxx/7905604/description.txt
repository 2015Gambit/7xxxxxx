When homicide detective David Grey's soul is stolen by a mysterious supernatural entity known only as the Other Guy, he falls through the cracks in the world to the place in-between, a shadow-world populated by the lost, the uncared-for and the thrown-away. To confront the entity and reclaim his soul, he must travel on foot from Los Angeles to New York accompanied by Laurel, a beautiful and engimatic woman who may be far more than she appears to be. Together they run a gauntlet of those determined to stop them, and along the way discover wonder, terror, beauty, danger and an unexpected love.
