,flacdude,2012-12-09T20:02Z,Is this really FLAC?
,jazznbluz,2012-12-09T20:49Z,Unfortunately this site will not me tag it as music or other.  It is a m4 file.  I'm pretty new to this and I'm running out of room on my HD.  As soon as get my larger ext HD I will convert many of the mp3's and m4's to Flac.  I felt it was better to share than not to share at this time.  
,par222,2012-12-10T16:58Z,You CAN NOT re encode an MP3 to FLAC to improve quality. You can't restore the lost quality when you rip to mp3 by changing the mp3 to FLAC. You have to rip from the original source to gain the advantages of FLAC. Converting mp3 to flac actually degrades the recording somewhat.
