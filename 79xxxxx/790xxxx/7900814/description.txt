Okay here it is all one frame size 720 x 400
Done on virtual dub at 1250 kbps
With the original DVD AC3 sound

2 samples included only 25 seconds long but with several size changes (so you can upload them quicker) to show you the original versus the all the same size.

And when watching the sample you will notice that when it changes itΓÇÖs BAM straight into it no fade into it like on normal movies for a few frames.  ThatΓÇÖs just the way it is made.

Seed dam you SEE eeeee EED
I cannot stress this enough as my upload speed is only 1 mbps so until a few people have it or part of it and seed back it is going to be slow going so donΓÇÖt complain if it takes 24 hours for the first few people to get it all and then a lot faster for others if they SEEEEED.

When I first decided to do this, I thought it would be simple and quick, yeah right, 139 times give or take 1 it changes from one size to the other.

Anyway original DVD was 720 x 480 the height of the IMAX parts so I trimmed 40 off top and bottom and on the standard bitΓÇÖs besides chopping the black off I took 74 off the sides.  You really donΓÇÖt seem to miss anything and this makes both sizeΓÇÖs 400 high without stretching or distorting anything.

Overall quality is okay but I feel that as a DVD rip itΓÇÖs not quite as crisp as other recent DVD rips but I feel that this is more because itΓÇÖs a 2 hour and 40 minit movie crammed onto a DVD.

My understanding is that the blue ray played from a blue ray is astounding.  Well I donΓÇÖt have one and donΓÇÖt want to keep blue ray size rips and DAM that size changing is annoying at least to me.

So enjoy and bloody SEEEEEEEEEED
