By removing the black bars, the image would have to trim bits off of the side to display it correctly, or it would have to manipulate and stretch the image.

So this shouldn't be of benefit for a TV.

However a computer can remove the black bars very easy, using the same techniques.

So what is the benefit of this? "
,garfiel,2012-12-08T12:42Z,"The benefit is that you can just play it on anything and there are no black bars. Not everyone plays it on a computer and even then if you set your computer player to remove the black bars as you watch it, it also chops a lot off the top and bottom of the imax bit's.  aprox 100 pixels top and bottom of the dvd rip, where in my rip it is missing only 40 pixels from top and bottom.  And as in my comments the non imax bits have 74 pixels trimmed off the sides so it assumes the same ratio with no distortion of the picture. i.e. stretching them vertically.             I suggest people down load the samples and compare them before downloading the whole thing to see if it suit's them.  PS I also left out the end credits to save a bit of file size but left all the start there so that any subs should still line up if any one wants to down load them from some where else."
