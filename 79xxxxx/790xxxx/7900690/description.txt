The Goddamn Gallows - Ghost Of The Rails (2010) mp3




The Goddamn Gallows began on a cold, dark and violent night in Lansing, Michigan, when 3 kids met in a face scarring fight with Benton Harbor gangbangers at a notorious East Lansing flophouse. 
They then migrated across the country, residing in LA squats and smoke stained apartments.
They then found Avery, a fire breathing washboard player who also plays accordian, and Jayke, former mandolin player for the .357 string band who also picked up a banjoΓÇª 

Psychobilly? Punk? Americana? How about just a damn good time! The Goddamn Gallows are hands down one of the hardest working bands in America. They have taken their blend of Rock'n'Roll from coast to coast numerous times and have built themselves a very dedicated following. With this their latest, that following should grow along with picking up new fans as well. They have played with everyone from the Koffin Kats to the Nekromantix to the Chop Tops and way too many to mention. A party band and one that you should not ignore!
