thanks a lot !"
,boodee,2012-12-09T05:07Z,"Great share
Flew here a few times this year"
,Marklam_Voom,2012-12-09T05:18Z,"So soon? Yes! I usually don't post this early. But after the OrbX England fiasco and the way they treated and threated many costumers in their forum blocking accounts and putting an ignorant stamp on their heads, this is payback. Thank you OrbX for being such assholes!"
,joshdu25,2012-12-09T08:09Z,"Too bad this doesn't download very fast, not much seeders lol :)"
,Felidae17,2012-12-09T10:28Z," 0,2 kb/s ! You are very quick with uploading but dowloading will take a year!
Thanks anyway; It's a fine scenery! But where are the seeders? I've been seeding all the night the 40% I've got on my pc"
,Marklam_Voom,2012-12-09T13:46Z,"No seeders? Slow download?
LOL
Over 40 seeders listed and been seeding above 100kbps all night!! xD
I'm sure you need to read the internet's instruction manual first."
,Metthos,2012-12-09T14:26Z,"@Marklam_Voom 
Also 39,3% for a very long time.
Download will take forever.
Can you please seed more?"
,joshdu25,2012-12-09T14:30Z,"Strange because 9 hours I'm downloading this and blocked at 39% with 0.1 kb/s. By the way I see only 3 seeders and more than 400 leechers, maybe hat's why..."
,aarque,2012-12-09T15:30Z,"Thanks for the share, but just so you all know; the seeder/leecher ratio indicated on the torrent page is not at all accurate. Marklam_Voom will notice that his torrent client reports a very different ratio of seed/leech than does TPB torrent page. The torrent client shows the correct numbers."
,joshdu25,2012-12-09T19:11Z,Thx for the info :)
,re330,2012-12-09T19:42Z,34 seeders and none of them available . cmon guys...
,turlututu,2012-12-10T11:13Z,"Thanks you very much for this share.

But I see 0 seed in my torrent client !
All client are block to 61.2%.

PLEASE, SEEDERS SEED !"
,DJiF,2012-12-10T12:43Z,"stuck at 62.7%. please seed, thank you."
,Marklam_Voom,2012-12-10T12:59Z,"Well then, I don't understand why. I'm almost positively sure it isn't a problem on my side. Because I am currently uploading to 25 leechers and have 22 seeders in the swarm.
Try adding more trackers to see if it speeds up."
,phrgflyer,2012-12-10T13:37Z,"Please SEED.  I have been trying to  d/l for 23 hrs and am stuck at 66.5%.

Again please SEED SEED SEED

Thank you."
,jimbob43,2012-12-10T18:21Z,Stuck at 99%. C'mon seeders.
,jimbob43,2012-12-10T18:41Z,Finally got it! Will seed for a few days. Thanks Voom.
,NGGhoSt,2012-12-11T16:59Z,"Downloading at 1.7mbps.
So really. Just stop yelling seed and pay more for your internet. 

Thanks Marklam"
,ak416,2012-12-11T17:47Z,"Hey NGGhoSt, guessing you werent one of us who spent 2 days downloading this getting only a few mbs per hour, huh? No, so fuck off, you are getting those speeds because everyone else is now seeding after spending days waiting for it."
,johnnie47,2012-12-17T22:21Z,"hi guys, dow's anyone else has missing snow textures on taxi ways?"
