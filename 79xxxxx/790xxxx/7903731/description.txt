"Why Can't We Be Friends?"

Stan decides that Snot isnt cool enough to 
be Steves best friend. So he attempts to 
separate them by staging a shooting at an 
ice cream parlor, of which Snot is the only 
witness and is then placed in the CIA 
Witness Protection program. Meanwhile, Roger 
hires Jeff to clean his attic for extra 
cash, but keeps robbing him every time he 
goes back downstairs.
