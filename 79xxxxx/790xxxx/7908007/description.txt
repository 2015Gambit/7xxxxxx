This 2012 torrent supersedes the somewhat similar "Conan the Barbarian soundtrack - Ultimate Version" found here:

Back in 2008, I published the first version of this torrent at the above link, declaring it quite accurately as "the longest, best-quality version of Basil Poledouris' CONAN THE BARBARIAN soundtrack ever created." Now, in December 2012, a brand new 3-CD complete version of this soundtrack has just been released from Intrada records. I was elated -- in a perfect world, that would be it, and we could just buy the Intrada CDs and consign my previous "best version" torrent to the ash heap of torrent history. 

Unfortunately, although Intrada makes various claims on their website that they "recreated entire sequence[s] (including awkward edits)" to maintain fidelity to the way the music appeared in the film, the truth is far different. Here are the most egregious problems with the Intrada 2012 3-CD set as I see them:

20th CENTURY FOX FANFARE: not included at all.

PROLOGUE: drum part too short, and the version with Mako's narration doesn't use the new master tape drum track.

DISCIPLINE OF STEEL / FREEDOM COUNCIL: uses drums that didn't appear in the film.

THE KITCHEN: a few bars of music out of place, plus the WARPAINT track blending into the beginning is awful to listen to IMHO (even though it is that way in the film)

STEALING THE PRINCESS: the big fight right after the Orgy is edited horribly. No wave of brass at the transition between orgy and fight. Some of the music is clearly not the same recording as the film version. The speed of the music in the film is about 5% faster than the Intrada version. Worst of all, Intrada just dropped the Anvil of Crom cue into this scene -- THE WHOLE DAMN CUE, including the string middle section that doesn't appear at all here in the film. This all equals a music track that doesn't accurately portray perhaps the single best scene in the movie. Unforgivable.

END TITLES: Again, music is dropped into this track that doesn't at all match what is in the film. The Anvil of Crom music should be a bit faster, and have somewhat muted horns. They also failed to include a version with Mako's narration, the way they did for the Prologue. 

__________________________________________________________

You simply cannot listen to that set and get the experience of HEARING THE MOVIE. Instead, you are constantly jarred out of the experience by strange edits, choices, and omissions that do battle with your now-thirty-year expectations of what each track should sound like. It's maddening.

Hence this torrent.

I have spent the last few days meticulously editing the Intrada release to make it match the film as closely as possible. This torrent presents all of the music in film order, with many little edits and tricks to bring it into film shape. A few notes:

Includes Prologue and End Credits that both feature Mako and don't. Your choice as to which to listen to. 

THE KITCHEN has been fixed to correspond to the film, and the WARPAINT music has been separated from the very beginning of it.

For THE ORGY, I've kept the famous long waltz-like introductory note that's always been on all versions of the soundtrack, although that note doesn't appear in the film. 

During the fight after the orgy, the wonderful wave of brass is now back. I also kept one flourish from the last version of my torrent: the magnificent BOOM! sound effect as the pillar Thorgrim hits crashes to the ground. (For those who don't want this, I've also included a version sans BOOM!). The entire fight section has been sped up approximately 5%, which is what it took to make it match the film exactly. And all of the little edits that make the film version propulsive and great are there -- in fact, since a part of this track in the film features a specific version of music that appears nowhere in the Intrada release, I was forced to take that music directly from the film. Don't worry -- I equalized the sound so it matches the Intrada sound almost exactly, so it fits right in. 

All music that doesn't appear in the film is cut out of the main presentation of tracks, and has been relegated to the files labelled as A01-A16 at the bottom of the list. This way you can listen to a playlist that sounds as close to the original film as possible. 

So there you have it. I urge you to buy the 3-CD Intrada set, as it has a lot of extras not included here (most prominently, it has a completely remastered version of the original CD soundtrack, which sounds subtly different from the remastered version in that it sounds less over-produced, without the too-high highs and too-low lows of most modern releases. It's pleasant to listen to for a change of pace, and Intrada is to be commended for including it in their set. 

But for those who are as frustrated as me that their expensive Intrada release deviated so significantly from the film, I hope this torrent eases your pain as much as it's done for me. Enjoy.
