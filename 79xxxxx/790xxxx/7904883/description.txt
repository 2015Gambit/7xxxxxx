COURSE DESCRIPTION
Explore the era between the fall of Rome and the rise of the Renaissance in three 24-lecture courses that reveal the important role the Middle Ages played in Western CivilizationΓÇöeach taught by expert medieval scholar and award-winning Professor Philip Daileader.

Begin your tour with The Early Middle Ages, which centers on the period between A.D. 300 and A.D. 1000, when the ancient world had ended and Europe had seemingly vanished into ignorance and shadow. 

Then, venture into the heart of the age with The High Middle Ages, in which you investigate how and why medieval society made great strides in philosophy, commerce, education, literature, and politics. Plunge into a world of knights and ladies, popes and emperors, lords and vassals, and other important players on the medieval stage including Francis of Assisi and Frederick II.

Finally, to complete your grasp of this historical period, you look at the years between 1300 and 1500ΓÇöduring which the seeds of modernity were planted.
