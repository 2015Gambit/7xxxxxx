This is the combatives program the US Army adopted years back. About 20 years ago the Gracies, using their Ultimate Fighting Championship fame began to schmooze US law enforcement and military brass into letting them train personnel. And who could blame them? Everbody's gotta make a buck somehow. Anyway these vids are what remains of what the Army culled from the training that Rorion et. al. gave to them. 

You'll see that the standard rope a dope - sucker ya into the guard (great if you've got a nice, soft mat)has been dropped in favor of a more logical street fighting scenario (hint - no one ever wins from the bottom in the real world). As well as the realizatiom that someone might indeed try to clobber your ass instead of getting gay all over you. 

It's a good example of great Jiu jitsu/MMA training that has been re-worked and applied with reality in mind. This stuff wasn't meant to be used on the battlefield but rather for soldiers so tat they wouldn't get their asses handed to them while hanging out off duty in some foreign theater of ops.
