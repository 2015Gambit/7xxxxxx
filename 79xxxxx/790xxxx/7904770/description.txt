My aim is to introduce you to the C# language (and a tiny bit of the .NET Framework), and give you a clear understanding of the fundamentals needed to start writing applications in C#.

I wonΓÇÖt lie; some of the material is easier to grasp if you have some programming background. But I do try to explain things from the standpoint of a complete beginner. So even if you havenΓÇÖt programmed before, I hope youΓÇÖll find my explanations of programming concepts and fundamentals understandable.

All I ask is for a few minutes of your time each day for a month. Ready?
