Carina Round - Tigermending [2012] [FLAC]

==================================================================================

"ItΓÇÖs been five years since Carina Round released her last full albumΓÇö2007ΓÇÖs Slow Motion AddictΓÇö but the L.A.-via-England singer/songwriter hasnΓÇÖt been idle in the interim. She released the Things You Should Know EP in ΓÇÿ09 and joined the more straightforward Early Winters and released an EP last year. She also joined Maynard James KeenanΓÇÖs Puscifer on tour and on last yearΓÇÖs Conditions of my Parole as a background singer while RoundΓÇÖs music found its way onto the silver screen with placements on shows such as American Horror Story, Pretty Little Liars and Dollhouse.

And honestly, that Round does well as a collaborator and in film syncs is fairly telling of what Tigermending has in store.

Big, bold choruses in songs like ΓÇ£The Last TimeΓÇ¥ and the strummy guitars and ΓÇ£doo-doo-dooΓÇ¥s in ΓÇ£You And MeΓÇ¥ beg for the screen. And as an arranger, Round boasts an abundance of ideas; her songs are stuffed with keys, horns, strings and electronics, though they rarely stray into ambient or overly textural territory. With such an array of timbres at her disposal, RoundΓÇÖs songs travel great distances. ΓÇ£MotherΓÇÖs Pride,ΓÇ¥ for example, begins relatively sparsely, with crisp electric guitar and RoundΓÇÖs full, smooth voice; it boils over into a squall bordering on noise-rock as Round accelerates into bluesy belting. This is an artist ever on the verge of pop-chart indie rock, and ever willing to peel away with a daring move like this one.

And thatΓÇÖs TigermendingΓÇÖs most compelling asset. The vibrant and varied arrangements are plenty approachable. Round knows her way around a hook, and she swings for the fences with every chorus. But none of that comes at the expense of her songs. Instead of writing vague tunes for the sake of easy licensing, Round uses her eclectic-pop approach as a vehicle for striking imagery and ambitious compositions.

ItΓÇÖs not likely a smart move commercially to open an album with a cynical story of domestic ruin, with the speaker as antagonist. But Round does, opening ΓÇ£Pick up the PhoneΓÇ¥ by informing its unnamed subject ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm pregnant with your babyΓÇ¥ Later, she sings matter-of-factly, ΓÇ£His wife didnΓÇÖt stop crying/ For at least a week he told me/ But at least she got the kids and half a million/ I just assumed that she was sleeping.ΓÇ¥

Round doesnΓÇÖt let up much throughout the album. On ΓÇ£The Last Time,ΓÇ¥ she sings, ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm hung/ Like a tongue/ From my open-mouth window.ΓÇ¥ On ΓÇ£MotherΓÇÖs Pride,ΓÇ¥ she begins with an accusation ΓÇö ΓÇ£Mother, Mother, you are a disgusting liar/ I have had the heart torn from my pure, white flower/ It was not beautiful/ It was not how you said it would beΓÇ¥ΓÇösung in her sweetest voice.

ItΓÇÖs little wonder RoundΓÇÖs been so frequently compared to PJ Harvey, another Englishwoman with a dynamic voice and an unflinching way with words. But RoundΓÇÖs a bit of a vocal chameleon, adopting different styles as they suit her songs. ΓÇ£MotherΓÇÖs PrideΓÇ¥ suggests, alternately, Nicole Atkins and Grace Slick. Elsewhere she evokes shades of Fiona Apple and Nick Cave, and on ΓÇ£The Secret of Drowning,ΓÇ¥ co-written with EurythmicsΓÇÖ Dave Stewart, one canΓÇÖt help but detect a tinge of Annie LennoxΓÇÖs deep, cool vocal.

That makes it a bit difficult, perhaps, for Round to stake a claim as a singular voice. But with an album as accomplished as Tigermending, she makes up for it."
