Each episode includes four subtitle tracks. These are:

1. English (forced): Intended to be used with the English dub, only subtitles Japanese text and lyrics. Lyrics subtitles alternate between English and Japanese (romaji) in each episode.

2. English: Intended to be used with the Japanese audio, translates all dialogue. Includes translation of onscreen text, lyrics, and some culture notes.

3. SRT version of (1). Many players like VLC and Media Player Classic will render SRT subtitles at much higher resolution, so they will appear much sharper and easier to read. On the downside, SRT subtitles can only render at the bottom, not both the top and bottom. This is the default subtitle channel.

4. SRT version of (2).

In some episodes subtitles (1) and (2) are reversed.

Encoding: Encoded from original DVDs using Handbrake at H.264 Constant Quality RF:19, the maximum recommended quality for DVDs. Audio is original AC3 audio from DVDs (passthrough). All other settings were set to achieve the maximum possible compression (b-adapt=2:rc-lookahead=50:bframes=5:ref=6:direct=auto:subq=10:analyse=all:me=tesa:trellis=2). Episodes differ in size based on how compressible they are. SRT files were produced using a combination of SubRip, Jubler, custom tools, and manual editing.
