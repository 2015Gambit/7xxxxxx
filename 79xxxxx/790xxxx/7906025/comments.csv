Just when people start warming up to Curtis, they kill him off and Rudy can't carry the entire show forever before they somehow screw him up and we're sick of him too! Bleh, I think the season will be the last, and if not, it should be."

,Xplosiv0,2012-12-10T04:50Z,"Forgot to thank ettv for the upload. After watching the episode, I am all but confident that this should be the final series. It's like they're depending on obscene shock value to hook the audience. How about explaining the origins of the storm? Or better yet, stop with the community service, it's no longer believable that they all coincidentally have powers and are at the same community center. How about covering the public's reaction to the storm? Nope, they'll just keep giving us more of the same which is not nearly as good as it used to be. Then again, as someone who pirated every episode so far, I guess I'm not the target audience."
