The 2-Disc set includes a CD featuring the best of The English Beat at the US Festival, and a DVD featuring full sets from both 1982 and 1983. Live At The US Festival is the first English Beat US Festival concert performance to be released on DVD and has been largely unseen for nearly 30 years. (See full track listing below)

For those of you unfamiliar with the US FESTIVAL, read on:

The US Festival was held over two weekends in 1982 and 1983. Steve Wozniak, cofounder of Apple Computer, funded the concerts and accompanying technology exposition, as well as the construction of a brand-new outdoor venue in Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino, CA. Nearly every musical genre was represented by bands as diverse as U2, Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Ozzy Osbourne, Waylon Jennings, The Ramones, The Police and The Clash. Over the combined seven days of the festival, more than one million people passed through the entrance gates.

Music fans have waited decades for performances from The US Festival to be made available on CD and DVD, and the wait was worthwhile. Initial US Festival releases captured performances by Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and Quiet Riot, and The English Beat are next in line, with their 2 unforgettable shows. The English Beat performed at The US Festival on September 3, 1982 in a lineup that included The Ramones, The B-52's, The Police, Talking Heads, Oingo Boingo and Gang of Four. They returned the next year to play ΓÇ£New Wave DayΓÇ¥ on May 28, 1983, along with The Clash, INXS, Oingo Boingo, Stray Cats, Men at Work, A Flock of Seagulls, Wall of Voodoo, and Divinyls. The English Beat and Oingo Boingo were the only bands to play both the 1982 and 1983 US Festivals.
