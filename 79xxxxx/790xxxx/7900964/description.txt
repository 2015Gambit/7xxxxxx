For a Mini 272p XVID AVI with 22K MP3 audio, I'm going to be bold:
V=8
A=8
.
I had reservations about such a small size for a drama, but I surprise myself.
I dedicate this to neeru, ostensibly of India for reminding me of small values.

From AVIGUY:
My Release Date.: 2012-12-07
Release Size: 80 Mb
Run Time.......: 45:49
Resolution.....: 480x272
Video Codec...: XVID

So, 9 hours and I'm going to skip the 720p files for now.

If anyone is really interested and can't get it anywhere else (UseNet),
I'm willing to do a "slow crawl" which could take a day or two per file.

I'm just not up to committing all my bandwidth for that long at a stretch.

Hopefully someone with better bandwidth and UseNet access will step up.

So, back to individual files - yes, the 272p will compete with the 352p

If this is the first you're hearing of this and want to know where 201 is:
