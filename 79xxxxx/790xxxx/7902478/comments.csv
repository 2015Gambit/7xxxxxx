,dududus,2012-12-09T23:07Z,"MagMaster

with this version, downgrade to 3.55 and QA flag is no longer necessary

also, recovery mode is not necessary

install from USB stick directly from XMB

no bricks reported since release approx 2 weeks ago

if you have been unsure because of all the betas and downgrading.. this is for you

brickproof and simple and only takes 5 mins"
,mixtape78,2012-12-12T06:32Z,I'm on Kmeaw and have loads of games on internal HDD patched and fixed for 3.55 (both in Multiman and PSN games on XMB)... Will I need to re-patch/fix any of the installed games on CFW4.30?
,dududus,2012-12-13T04:10Z,"Most (95%) of PS3 games will work no problems. Just delete any game data (not save data) if one doesn't. No patching required.

PSN games won't work without patching ie signing with new keys... luckily there is a program that does it with one click:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7864601/PS3_CFW_4.xx_Fully_Automatic_Resigner_v0.5b

At this point all the bugs in 4.30 have been ironed out, 3.55 has more and more unpatched new releases or only partially working. 

On 4.30 .. everything works, no patching."
,mixtape78,2012-12-13T05:54Z,"Thanks dududus, that's very helpful!"
,mixtape78,2012-12-13T06:08Z,"Another question: Can I ever downgrade back to 3.55 if I decide one day? I ask because I have Cobra dongle, which has unique features and currently only works on 3.55

The Cobra team announced that they will be releasing a 4.3x update soon, but I'm not sure if I'll need to be on 3.55 to update to Cobra 4.3x"

You can downgrade anytime.. check

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7792694/PS3_CFW_4.30_Brickproof_Upgrade_Kit_-_Tested

use MagMasters other 2 torrents for the files

@99Saif 

you need to get your ps3 downgraded by a professional modder first.. $50 or 35 GBP"

,MagMaster,2012-12-23T14:01Z,"66saif, if you are on 4.31 OFW, then you must use flasher to downgrade your PS3.

If can be downgraded, ofcourse."
