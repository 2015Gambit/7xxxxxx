5 Hours and 20 minutes of classic tracks from the 70ΓÇÖs and early 80ΓÇÖs,

All files are mp3 VBR VO.

As the tracks are sourced from both vinyl and CD, all have been tagged with Replay Gain and coded for iPod compatibility.

Burrn will write from the tags to produce a disc that plays at a single volume level, http://www.burrrn.net/?page_id=6 this is a free programme, its small and does the job.

Had to load this again, due to torrent error, apologies.
