,crumrugin,2012-12-14T01:06Z,Having watched it ...It's a GREAT real look at an American high school football team and what a coaches love and determination can do to make an impoverished bunch of loser into glorious winners 
,1964XMEN,2012-12-18T09:28Z,I really didnt get what others wrote in their comments on here - this was about men making boys into men- color had no bearing- the way it should be - sports is about TEAM - it doesnt build character - it gives u the oppurtunity to show what character u hav inside u as a man.  Thanks so much for upload - wish life was more in tune to things like this but unfortunately its not and that is why we r where we r as a nation and world right now.  It was a pleasure - thank you so much for a lil glimpse of hope.  USAFspec. retired
