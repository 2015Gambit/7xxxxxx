While Kaine ponders his mortality over the corpse of a dead man in a funeral home, Spider-Man (Ben Reilly) silently observes the grave of "his" friend, Harry Osborn. Kaine decides that he should not die alone, and so he formulates a plan. He sends a stranger across the country in search of Ben, and in the meantime visits Ben, "firing the first volley in a war that, with luck would destroy us both."
