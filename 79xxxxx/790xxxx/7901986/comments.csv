This is mostly a 'filler' episode, don't expect too much entertainment from it."

,LgZeldA,2012-12-11T05:04Z,Bad quality. Too bad EZTV is usually trustable.
,LgZeldA,2012-12-11T05:12Z,Disregard last comment. Utorrent crapped out on me. Torrent is fine.

,D1Nonly,2012-12-15T14:21Z,"Just what i want to see in Star Wars.. Stupid fucking droids and gimmicky one-off's to sell toys.

Why not show the Clones? Nulls, ARC's and commando's..?
