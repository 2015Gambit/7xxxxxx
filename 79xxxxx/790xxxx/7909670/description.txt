RIP Sir Patrick Moore

This is the last edition filmed with Patrick Moore,
who died peacefully at home with the company of
friends and colleagues at his bedside, Sunday, 9.December, 2012.

I say "last edition" he filmed as I don't know if there are any new
pre-recorded segments that may air later on.
