This is the original set of videos offered on the Russian grappling art of Sambo by Panther productions (now out of business). These videos, like all other Panther vids were eventually picked up by 3rd party retailers and now most are not being restocked when the supply is depleted. There has already been lots of great knowledge lost to the records (as far as videos are concerned) so please seed. Don't download this to your download folder and then move it. It doesn't protect you in any way and no one cares about out of circulation videos anyway. I have been able to obtain a large percentage of many of the old vidoes that existed and I will be posting other torrents in the next few weeks. 

You'll notice that there are a few missing. All of the techniques vids are there. Missing are the self defense tape (usually poor quality) and the schlock interview and the exercise tape. All irrelevant to the meat of the series.
