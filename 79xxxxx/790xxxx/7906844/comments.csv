,TxJag,2012-12-15T07:42Z,"@N112358 I did research just now for the ""History of Middle Earth"" and they are not available in any sort of eBook format at the moment.

@arsenalmatt I am actually getting ready to work on obtaining the John Sandford Bibliography and Jonathan Kellerman Bibliography which I hope to release sometime next year."
