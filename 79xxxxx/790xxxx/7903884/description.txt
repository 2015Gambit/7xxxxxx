Springfield is ready to celebrate the holiday season, but the weather just isn't cooperating, and it's up to Lisa to find out what's keeping winter away.  Then, all the girls at Springfield Elementary try to capture Bart beneath the mistletoe and steal a Christmas kiss.  Will they succeed or will Bart remain cootie-free?  And when Homer once again ruins Ned Flanders annual holiday party, Ned is pushed past his breaking point.  Can Homer make amends or is this the end of their relationship?
