finally my dad will be happy :D"
,liveinreal20,2012-12-13T22:24Z,"@Piratechnix yes, you need to block the exe. if you get the error message over and over again then, delete the solsuite registry key from regedit and register again."
,Piratechnix,2012-12-14T11:22Z,"OK well this thing is not working for me....I blocked the exe with firewall even blocked the updater exe and it will accept the serial when i first enter it but when i restart the program it says the same thing "" a problem has been detected with your activation code"" and it switches me back to trial version."
[T],Ching_Liu,2012-12-14T12:54Z,@Piratechnix - You possibly used older version of the application with key. Please uninstall and clean your registry (old key) and install again.
,Piratechnix,2012-12-14T13:58Z,"@Ching_Liu  - the only ' version ' i have is what came with this torrent so i don't see how i could be installing an older one. Also, i have tried re-installing after deleting the Application Data  SolSuite folder and the game accepts the serial i generate with the keygen but it doesn't stick. As i said before it's like the game is still connecting to their servers and detecting the serial as being bad and it rejects it. I have the exe blocked with my firewall (inbound and outbound) so i don't see how it is even connecting to their servers at all really..... thanks for responding and trying to help btw."
