As a progressive rock fan I recognize that many songs made today have a good musical quality regardless of the gender.

Most artists are just posers and copycats, but, we can listen to many well produced songs made by quality sound teams.

Ten years ago was the real Dark Ages, lets just be thankful that Pop and Rap are losing ground to RB, Electronic and mostly, to the fact that many stars are seeing themselves as artists and experimenting."
