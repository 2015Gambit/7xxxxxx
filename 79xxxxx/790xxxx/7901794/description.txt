Interpol - Turn on the Bright Lights: The 10th Anniversary Edition (2012)


Ten years ago, InterpolΓÇÖs debut album seized the imagination of a generation. The spare, lean textures, darkly oblique lyrics and suave stage presence were entirely different from the bands who preceded them on the charts and the radio. Now fully remastered in a beautiful deluxe hardbound book with unreleased photos (48 pages in the CD, 28 large pages in the vinyl) and a second disc of bonus tracks, many unreleased, plus demos and B-sides and a DVD.

The album will be available as a double CD+DVD, double LP+DVD, and digital album with digital booklet. Pre-orders will come with a replica of the band's first item of merchandise, a button with the original Interpol logo.
