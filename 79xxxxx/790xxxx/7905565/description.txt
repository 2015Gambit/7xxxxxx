Ok. There is only one other torrent on PB that has this...and that douche is not seeding.  So here ya go.  

This came from xdark 4.2, the 64bit version.  There are a TON of windows apps here.

I have used quite a few of these. the custom xdark apps( bottom of the list) are pretty cool.

Installation is simple...just download the iso. Mount it.Run WPI.exe
You will have a number of screens to navigate, which groups all the apps into specific categories.

I have included a txt file, with a complete listing of all the apps.

peace
