i hope that this movie works great on my lg 3D cinema, because some other movies like 'Born To Be Wild 3D' 'ParaNorman 3D' doesn't work. 

sorry for my english, is not my official language."

if movies does'nt play, then you have to reformat them or if no sound, then format sound to AC3, if it is dolby digital.
LG has limited the sound only  Dolby Digital, not DTS"

If you update software on your LG Cinema TV it'll play DTS format"
