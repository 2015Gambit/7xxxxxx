America's Lost Treasures
Across America there are forgotten links to our history. Family heirlooms and found objects with unexpected value and amazing stories just waiting to be discovered. Each episode of America's Lost Treasures will follow our team of two cast members on their quest to find these treasures, uncover their stories, and choose one item that deserves to take its place in a museum. The chosen object each episode will be on loan to the National Geographic Society's special exhibition of America's Lost Treasures, and the object owner will receive a $10,000 award.



2)  Philadelphia 
The next stop for uncovering fascinating American artifacts is our nations first capital: Philadelphia, Pa. Curt and Kinga investigate a letter seal used by Robert Morris, financier of the American revolution, signer of the Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution; and an original artists proof of the George Washington engraving used by Alfred Sealy in the first (and subsequent) Washington dollar bill.
