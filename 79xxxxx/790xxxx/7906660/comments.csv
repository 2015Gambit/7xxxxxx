,nonukez,2012-12-10T07:47Z,"Oh man, some people...
Seriously, what's the point of leaving comments saying it's fake? I legitimately want to know how these people's brains work. 
Does people *not* downloading give them benefit somehow? Do they enjoy trying to confuse people? 
This isn't even good trolling, since the evidence this is real is there, right by ""ettv"", the green skull, and every other comment saying it's real. Truly saddening, the things people waste their time with. "

,scottsasse,2012-12-10T10:07Z,"Does anyone else have problems lately with their comments not posting right after clicking the submit button? Like a time lag before it appears, if it appears at all. I used to think that people who posted the same comment 4 times in a row were retarded but now I might just be one of them!! Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. You can e-mail me at DrWynnScott@gmail.com . Anyhoo, THANKS ET for yet another awesome upload and THANKS to all you seeders, I'm getting a blazing fast download and will be sure to return the favor :)"
