[V],catflap,2012-12-08T23:07Z,"That's all the new stuff I have this year.

Most of my xmas and new years stuff
from 2009, 2010, and 2011 are still being
seeded. Just click on my name and you'll
find a lot more classic goodies.

I don't think I'll be buying anymore new
things this year.

But I might decide to post a few things I did
before 2009 if I think they might be wanted...

...AND ONLY if I have the time and inclination. As always, my own downloading takes priority.

Reasons Greetings and Merry Newtonmas!"
[V],catflap,2012-12-09T05:15Z,"I should also say that in the coming days and weeks
if there are any new holiday specials that I like but
aren't released in xvid, and if I think people would
want it, AND if I have the time and inclination
(because my own downloading always has priority),
then I might do some new recordings.

I DO NOT TAKE REQUESTS, SO DON'T ASK.
BUT YOU MIGHT GET LUCKY IF I DECIDE TO
DO ANY NEW HOLIDAY SPECIAL RECORDINGS.

I forgot to mention earlier that I WILL be sharing
the two Still Game Hogmanay Specials between
Christmas and 31. December. I've already
ripped and re-encoded them.

Reasons Greetings and Merry Newtonmas!"
