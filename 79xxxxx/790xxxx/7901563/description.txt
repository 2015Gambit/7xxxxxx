
Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones is the sixth official compilation album by The Rolling Stones. It was initially released worldwide, except in North America, in 1993. The North American release came on 24 August 2004.

It was the first Rolling Stones compilation packaged in the compact disc era, and covered the band's career from 1971's Sticky Fingers to then-most recent studio album Steel Wheels in 1989. It was also the band's first release under their contract with Virgin Records, which had been signed in November 1993, while Voodoo Lounge was being recorded. 
The album reached #16 in the UK and became an enduring seller. Despite its very belated release in the US in 2004, it managed to peak at #30 and go platinum. The album artwork was designed by Maurice Jones and all 4 shoes / boots illustrated are still in Mr Jones' possession.

In 2009 it was remastered and reissued by Universal Music. (wikipedia.org)
