I have a folder ""Sysnative"" of 1,371,806,777 bytes with no date & attributes shown, in my C:|Windows folder. I'm short of disk space and was wondering if this is essential and if this folder can be deleted. I don't think I've noticed such a folder with other installations. Pls. advise.

Thanks for the upload."
