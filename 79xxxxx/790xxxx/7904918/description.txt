about windows update
Windows update doesn't like if you touch WinSxS. It will just install the system update readiness
tool, which will re-install a bunch of shit into WinSxS, and then updates will fail because they attempt
to update stuff that doesn't exist.Some updates will install, others will not. Generally, the ones
that will not install is due to stuff being removed, and it can't update what isn't there
