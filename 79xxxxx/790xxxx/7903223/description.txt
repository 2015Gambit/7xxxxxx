Its valuable content is in an accessible format. In three comprehensive volumes and approximately 2,000 A-to-Z entries, this definitive resource pres more thorough, complete coverage than any other encyclopedia. Each entry pres an at-a-glance look at the war in question and a narrative discussion of the war, examining its social context, major battles and events, and broader significance in cultural and historical terms.
