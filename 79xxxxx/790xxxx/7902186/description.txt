ΓÇ£ikd-sjΓÇ¥ are constructed with a grinding tom-tom, and the snare of garage beats, and a bleeding vocals of trance, and the buzz-saw assault, and a lot of industrial-strength riff textures. ΓÇ£a blend darkΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£the bleak riffsΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£the head-spinning guitar playsΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£drifting into the resignedΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£the psych-torporΓÇ¥,etc ΓÇªbut any words can not express them exactly. one day, they concocted a golden formula that would reanimate the dormant corpse of very rock sounds. and they got just as solid a base of pop hooks, but even at their most vitriolic, that go so long to explaining insanity of them. ΓÇ£ikd-sjΓÇ¥ imbue their blustery music with a cathartic element of tragedy.
