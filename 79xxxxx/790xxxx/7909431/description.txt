A vacation in the country has strange and unexpected consequences in this offbeat drama from filmmaker Jan Kr√ºger. Robin (Eric Golub) and his lover, Johann (Sebastian Schlecht), take some time off and set out on a bicycle trip through the woods of Brandenburg. The further Robin and Johann venture into the woods, the more eccentric their surroundings become, and everyday events begin to take on a decidedly surreal edge. The couple enjoys a respite from the strange events when they happen upon a farm, where a woman named Grit (Iris Minich) welcomes them with open arms. Robin and Johann relax and enjoy the idyllic surroundings at Grit's estate, but the two soon notice that Grit's teenage son, Henri (Denis Alevi), is displaying a powerful curiosity about their lifestyle.
