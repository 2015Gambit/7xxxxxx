Once upon a time, W.H.E.A.T. convened in secret to conduct a fell ritual of hate and darkness.  The result of this evil gathering was the album "Legend of Tales, Many Ages Past".  Yet somehow, during the great epoch of archiving, 5 songs disappeared from the recordings.

This E.P. contains those disgusting, mind-reaving songs.

Before the "Legends.." session commenced, the band had assigned a working title to the forthcoming album.  However, after the album began to come together, a new title emerged.  When the lost songs were unearthed, it was decided by congress with dark spirits that the resulting E.P. should carry the original, intended title:

"To The Maxxx, With Power and Suckulence"

What lurks within represents some of the most offensively bad, brain-in-a-food-processor-suicide-inducingly unlistenable garbge that will ever fall upon the human ear.  And yet, it is rumored... that other secrets lurk within.
