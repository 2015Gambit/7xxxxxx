I had reservations about such a small size for a drama, but I surprise myself.
I dedicate this to neeru, ostensibly of India for reminding me of small values.
.
I say to XVID codec - 192K and it says "nope, gonna do 256K" adds about 12MB

The text on the screen is in French - the dialog is in English

For the few lines in the show that need translating,
I've included a very small .srt file if you know how to use it.
It works for me (XP / MPC), your mileage may vary.
It can be opened as a text file if all else fails
Tells you what was said when.
