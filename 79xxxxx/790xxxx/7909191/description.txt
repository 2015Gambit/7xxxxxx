ION-A Christmas Wedding Date (2012) 

Air Date: 9 Dec 2012

Summary: After being fired from her high-powered job, Rebecca (Sokoloff) heads back home to see her mom, Shirley (Hicks), and attend her friends' small-town wedding on Christmas Eve. Initially convinced that the trip is a terrible mistake, especially her botched romantic conversation with former beau, Chad (Carmack), Rebecca soon learns that, indeed, you can go home again, and, again -- until you get it right.
