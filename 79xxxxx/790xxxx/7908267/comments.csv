This looks like it's a compressed file. Just use WinRAR or 7zip to extract the first file (nfl.2012.12.09.lions.vs.packers.720p.hdtv.x264-bajskorv.r00)

Once you extract this file, it will automatically extract all the others and compile it into a video for you.

If you need more help, I recommend google."
