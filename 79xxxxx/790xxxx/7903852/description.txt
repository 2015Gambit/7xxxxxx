Enzoani is scheduled to release Timeless December 10, 2012, a viral commercial debuting the 2013 Enzoani Collections entirely shot in Ultra HD 4K, RED One technology. With the highest quality of film technology currently in the industry, Enzoani is one of the first in the bridal industry to use this technology for commercial use. Used to distinguish Enzoani as a lifestyle brand, the video follows a young woman through several stages of her life as she grows from flirty and fun prom fashion to the elegance of an Enzoani bride.  Her transition is complemented with a musical score produced by composer Giona Ostinelli, known for his work in movies such as Perdition, The Campaign and more. In unison with its debut, Enzoani will be hosting a month long contest running from December 10, 2012 to January 10, 2013 where one randomly selected winner will get to choose a dream gown up to $3,000 value.
