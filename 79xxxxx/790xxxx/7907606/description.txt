Barnes & Noble - Carol Wright
Celebrate Hanukkah with the sounds of a provocative mix of contemporary 
Jewish music. The light-in-the-darkness of Dave Koz's "Memories of a Winter 
Night" is inspiring, while the passionate voice of Neshama Cablebach on "A 
Love Transcending" seems to emanate from the candles themselves. There's 
laughter, too, as in the inevitable holiday relationship tangle in "Feast of 
Lights" by They Might Be Giants. More traditional sounds are offered by The 
Klezmatics in "I'm Going to Take My Shoes Off," and vocalist Chava 
Albertstein's heartrending supplication. Sephardic music is embellished with an 
ambient groove on Victor E. Friedberg's "Continuo -- La Mujer de Terah," 
featuring historic samples of the voice of Berta Aguado. Angelic chanting 
gives an ethereal atmosphere to Wayne Horvitz and Robin Holcomb's "Mah 
L'kha Ha-Yam Variation." Jazz saxophone, big band, and a Dylan-like folk 
song sung by Peter Himmelman are just a few of the other styles to savor. 
And last, but certainly not least, is Frank London's evocative "Song of 
Praise," a swirling mixture of muted trumpets, plucked lute, keyboard drones, 
and Middle Eastern percussion. FESTIVAL OF LIGHT 2 is sure to fire up your 
Hannukah festivities.

All Music Guide - Steve Huey
Festival of Light, Vol. 2 is an equally satisfying follow-up to the 
groundbreaking Hanukkah holiday compilation, capturing traditional and non-
traditional musical takes on the season ranging from humorous and 
celebratory to ethereal, solemn, and spiritual. The generally subdued musical 
feel is broken at times by more boisterous offerings from the Klezmatics, the 
Frank London Big Band, and They Might Be Giants, for example; differing 
styles abound, including world music, rock, new age/contemporary 
instrumental, folk, klezmer, smooth jazz, electronic dance music, and 
traditional hymns, which gives the disc an amazing variety.
