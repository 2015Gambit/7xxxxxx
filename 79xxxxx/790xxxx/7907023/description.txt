With thanks to "anonymous" for the original image files.

Pattern Magic Vol 1 is the first of 3 volumes describing a radical method of clothing design and construction. The books don't come in any other language but Japanese, but the pictures are easy to follow. The hardest part is getting your head around the theory behind the designs. 

Even if these garments are not your style, I recommend reading these anyway. You're guaranteed to learn a lot from them. For more information there are various videos on youtube. Although they are not as helpful as the book, the combination is great.


Please note that page 7 was missing in the original files, and I haven't been able to locate it. 

Enjoy!
