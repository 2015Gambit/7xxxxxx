The Onion AV Club

Kyle Kinane is an exceptionally smart comedian whoÆs made a career out of 
acting stupid. He perpetuates and revels in his hobo-clown persona, 
characterizing himself on Whiskey Icarus as ôUncle Barbecue [telling] his 
dum-dum stories,ö or perhaps ôthe wise high-school janitor,ö the type of 
genial burnout who would name the tracks on his second stand-up album 
after the songs on KissÆ Destroyer, just because. (He did the same thing with 
2010Æs Death Of The Party, only with Cheap TrickÆs Dream Police.) But the 
mind behind that character is as sharp as they come, capable of sussing out 
the unexpected angles in an anecdote, as in a tour-de-force bit where he 
breaks down the multitude of questions raised by his airplane seatmate 
deciding to bring a Foot Locker shopping bag full of pancakes on board. 
(ôPancakes got X-rayed that day!ö)

The other great contradiction of KinaneÆs comedy is his ability to render 
ostensibly depressing material playful, and even heartening, via silly details 
and sly wordplay. He turns a lonely, drunken WendyÆs run into a late-night 
heist with an unamused cabbie in the role of getaway driver. He sees his sad 
life reflected back at him on the face of an unsliced pizza, and soldiers on 
anyway, marveling, ôThis giant taco tastes like Italy!ö And finally, he 
proposes using his own headstone as an opportunity to elicit laughs from 
cemetery passers-by, perhaps the finest distillation of his ability to fuse the 
bleak with the uplifting. KinaneÆs material is frequently self-deprecating, 
sardonic, and debased, but the underlying joy informing his approach gives it 
life, even when heÆs talking about death. 

The interplay between Kyle Kinane the character and Kyle Kinane the writer is 
what makes Whiskey Icarus such a compelling listen. ItÆs full of surprising 
moments that feel natural, the ramblings of an eccentric who has far more 
control over the situation than he lets on. KinaneÆs lack of self-control is the 
centerpiece of many of his stories, whether heÆs getting drunk on an airplane, 
making a sad meal of 7-Eleven cheeseburger dogs, or pondering whether a 
Twizzler would fit in his butthole; but heÆs extremely savvy in how he portrays 
these moments, manipulating and stacking them for maximum impact when 
the punchline falls, turning what could be a one-note character into a power 
chord.
