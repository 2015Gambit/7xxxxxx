I place the files in sdandroiddata and it gets stuck in the loading screen forever. 
I got an Xperia Arc S and in Play store says  this app is compatible with my phone.."

it seems to work just fine using the provided instructions. i don't know why you are having a problem. i don't think it makes a difference, but try to install and run it both offline and online. make sure you copied to the correct folder, com.cipherprime.splice goes in /Android/obb

you don't place the obb file in /Android/obb, you place the included folder in /Android/obb

hope that helps"
