Thank God You're Here is about well known performers doing a scene which they have no idea what's going on. It may be a Roman dungeon, a boardroom or a tonight show. The only thing you can bank on is that everyone else in the scene knows who they are and that their role is critical. There is no 'voting out', just fun.
