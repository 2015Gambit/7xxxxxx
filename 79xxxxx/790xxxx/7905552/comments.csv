U can easy make with convertx better BR2DVD, u need to now how. I never uses that program because other can make it better.

But convertx u need to set also 2passes, u need to set manuel disc size in MB.

I converted it with programs that works with HC Encoder give me best results with 2 passes.
Above all i prefer TMPG Encoder workshop5 that program can make everything u want tons off filtering on board so best is TMPG Workshop 5"
