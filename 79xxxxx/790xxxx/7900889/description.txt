Your dog is talking. Do you know what he is saying? Yawning, lip-licking, sneezing, even scratching are just a few of the 30 plus signals that dogs use to communicate with one another. In her landmark book, On Talking Terms with Dogs: Calming Signals, now in its second edition, Turid Rugaas identified and explained the meaning of these signals she calls calming signals. Now, with this DVD, you can see these signals in action. Become a keen observer of canine behavior at home, in the community and among dogs to get better behavior and build a solid relationship. Learn to identify situations that are stressful to your dog so that you can resolve or avoid them. Filmed by the author in lovely outdoor settings, see the signals in action while Turid narrates.
