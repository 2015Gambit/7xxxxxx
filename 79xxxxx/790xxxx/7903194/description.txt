This is a German music series from the 1960s and 1970s, which
originally had lesser-known rock and pop acts and just the early
episodes kids dancing "American Bandstand" style.  
There were two co-costs always including gorgeous Uschi Nerke 
who mostly just spoke German, while most of the later episodes the 
show gained a huge following with major English and American stars
such as Spencer Davis Group, The Who, and Jimi Hendrix.
