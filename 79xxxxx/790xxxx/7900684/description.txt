Those Poor Bastards - Behold The Abyss (2012) mp3


Yes! Everyones favorite musical doomsday preachers have returned with a set of peppy,  inspiring and uplifting ditties.....  NOT! As we all know, Those Poor Bastards has put out a good number of excellent albums and eps since 2004. If youre worried that these lunatics might have run out of steam or lost their faith, well, Behold The Abyss is sure to get your ass back on its knees and ask forgiveness that you could have even doubted them! 
Those Poor Bastards play miserable and primitive old-time gothic country music. Lonesome Wyatt (guitar, vocals) and The Minister (banjo, bass, etc.) are both legally certified holiness preachers.
