Description:

In todayΓÇÖs world of computers and cell phones, few people have time for superstition and ghost storiesΓÇöbut that doesnΓÇÖt mean that they arenΓÇÖt real! Amane Kamori is a powerful medium from a remote village in rural Japan. Her guardian is Hyoue Inugami, a demon dog whose powers are literally fueled by her kiss! Together they protect humans from vengeful spirits and bring peace to the dead. 

But when AmaneΓÇÖs family moves to the big city of Tokyo, all the magical power in the world canΓÇÖt help her survive high school! Her chilly demeanor and lack of social graces make her a campus misfit. Popularity comes much easier to Hyoue, whose sexy good looks (in his human form) bring him lots of female fans. But HyoueΓÇÖs lapdog loyalty to Amane only leads to more woe, as jealous classmates canΓÇÖt understand what he sees in her. If only they knewΓÇª
