Notes: Cropped the hardcoded non-english subtitles, placed a nice smooth blur filter over the watermark on the top right, (Same as the blurs on our other releases, takes extra long  to encode.) filtered the video as normal and then hardcoded the english subtitles for the  non-english parts, thanks to our bro who gave us the .srt. XviD, small file size and great quality.
