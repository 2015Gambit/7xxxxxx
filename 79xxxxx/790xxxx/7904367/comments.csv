,mooserocka,2012-12-09T22:18Z,thanks daman your awesome. SO i have heard nothing but GREAT things about this anime. What do you think?
,Daww,2012-12-10T07:03Z,"Thank you, I'm just a poor New Zealander with pain issues so English dubs are so great, Your uploads frequently make my day/week. ^_^"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-10T07:36Z,well for me ill wait but still great in jap too
,CraftedFury,2012-12-10T20:06Z,"Could you upload K? (K Anime; K-Project) http://myanimelist.net/anime/14467/K

Or if you know of a user who is uploading them in 720p?"
,mooserocka,2012-12-11T06:10Z,I love your anime in 480 so much better. Honestly i see no differnce. I dont understand animation just looks the same no matter what definition its in. These dled so much quicker and they look great. If you could please uploadmore stuff from the funimation site it would be awesome especially shangri la!!!!
,Daww,2012-12-11T06:34Z,"Daman4Iife ; has stated before that he was going to upload latest only, I don't know if his view has changed but he did at the time give us a vast list of releases he was planning to do.

I'm not sure if requests are welcome or not but i'm just grateful for the uploads anyway.
On the 480 vs + on larger screens i imagine larger is better and i always download the largest version in the end.. But the funimation rips are good and have been series i haven't started because they were subbed. so yay ^_^"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-11T08:17Z,"moose is because most anime are upscales there days, the only true 1080p anime that funimation ever release were, Yu YU Hakusho and Freezing thats about it.
everything else is either mastered at 540p or upscaled to 1080p"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-11T17:50Z,@Daww i agree with you for the comment because its still the same show/great uploads but yeah it feels greater to have a nice resolutions for funimations anime especially when they say bd rip on it but its still great
,mooserocka,2012-12-12T01:20Z,Im not saying he is wrong for uploading bluray. I could care less whatever he uploads im going to download as long as its dubbed. Just i noticed teh 480 went so fast . I had them loaded on my ps3 and downloaded in under a half an hour for both series. While the blu ray takes all night and then another like 14 hours to load on the ps3.
,Daww,2012-12-12T05:26Z,"Yeah moose sorry if i sounded like i was saying your opinion wasn't correct or something, I don't mean it like that.
I have so far liked 90% of what Daman has uploaded smaller res or not doesn't matter to me when the anime uploaded is so good, I can pickup a higher res later.

I just don't like to ramble on much about what does or doesn't get uploaded being as he is doing us a great service by sharing with us anything he does. ^_^"
,mooserocka,2012-12-13T01:03Z,Daww i couldnt agree more. You are totally right everything he has done so far is awesome. Maybe i have been asking for too much lately but now im done with all these amazing animes and want more lol. O well whatever he decides to put up next im sure it will be awesome. I just want shangri la so bad cause im up to episode 7 and i dont wanna buy volume 1 just to get 2 episodes. 
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-13T11:09Z,i couldn't careless with resolution i cant believe it but i agree with you both all of daman [almost all] of his uploads are great and watchable iguess 
,mooserocka,2012-12-16T23:26Z,Just watched more Im into it. I dont really like the whole memory loss angle. Other then that its a really good anime. There hasnt been a really good one in a while so im happy. 
,kenno2008,2012-12-19T19:46Z,Nice I originally upload this and you get all the thanks for this. Funimation has released more than Freezing and YYH in native hd.
,kenno2008,2012-12-19T20:09Z,Daman you have no idea what you are talking about Funimation has released a lot of titles that were not unscaled.  http://www.mania.com/aodvb/showthread.php?t=101718
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-22T02:02Z,"Kenno, yea you are right funimation has release many non upscales.
But since they have so many upscales is hard to tell which is which. "
,mooserocka,2012-12-31T05:59Z,Honestly i would RATHER have my anime at 480. I honestly cant tell the differnce at all. They take up less space and dl quicker. I wish he only uploaded dvd 480 but what can ya do. Also im around epidode 15 and getting very bored of this anime. I just dont like it as much now. Trying to fight thru without falling asleep.
