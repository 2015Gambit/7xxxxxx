Set in a city of scientifically advanced superhuman students, but in a world where magic is also real. Touma KamijouΓÇÖs right hand, the Imagine Breaker, will negate all magic, psychic, or divine powers, but not his own bad luck. One day he finds a young girl hanging on his balcony railing. She turns out to be a nun from the Church of England, and her mind has been implanted with the Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum - all the magical texts the Church has removed from circulation.

I take no credit for this Release.
This is a Funimation Site Rip.
These are for Desperate people that cant wait for Blu rays or DVD versions.
