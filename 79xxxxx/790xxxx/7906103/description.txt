Phineas and Ferb are up to unbelievable shenanigans like never before!
The boys take hockey to the extreme with Hockey Z-9, put their own special
touches on the New Year's Eve ball drop, and accidentally turn Candace
into a fly. Perry the Platypus, aka Agent P, has much bigger problems
than just Dr. Doofenshmirtz. He teams up with a former partner to stop

hunter set out on destroying him!
