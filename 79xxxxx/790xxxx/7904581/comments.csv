,goldpianogarden,2012-12-11T00:42Z,"Has your equipment changed or something, RayCort? I just noticed a few months back that the sound on them is kinda distorted now and hard to understand everything that is said, so I wondered if you had changed something that resulted in that outcome.  Thanks!"

RayCort: I have never said anything negative against an uploader in my many years on Pirate Bay because I generally appreciate the time they take to upload. I have to make an exception here because these are such a waste of time and bandwith to download.

Every single Hallmark Christmas movie of yours that I recently uploaded (and unfortunately I downloaded a lot of them before checking the quality - my bad!) is distorted and the sync constantly drifts so badly that these movies are utterly  unwatchable. They look and sound a lot like a cam -- a really, really bad cam.

There is something terribly wrong with the way you are recording these. At the very least turn your audio down - this alone could eliminate the distortion. (I don't have a clue why they were all so badly out of sync). 

 Please either do it correctly or stop! Other good uploaders see that you have uploaded these movies so they don't bother -- and everyone loses the opportunity to see some wonderful movies in a quality that is watchable. 

If you disagree with my assessment then at the very least upload a sample so people can decide for themselves... or better yet - try watching then yourself."

I thought there must be wrong with my configuration, because RayCort's movies have always been really good. I downloaded a bunch of the 2012 Halmark movies to watch on Christmas day, but most of them were too distorted to watch; although the Good Witch (2012) was just fine.

I hope he will be able to re-process them.
