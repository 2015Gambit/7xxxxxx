The audio-rip of TOUR2011 AGE QUOD AGIS Vol.2 [U.S. & Japan]. I will post it individually as soon as I get it.

Also, They have a new single coming out on 2012.12.19 so please check it out.

PLEASE buy their music if you enjoy it. We have waited years to finally be able to buy their music for a reasonable price and it is possible now that they have their music released worldwide. 

SUPPORT THE AUTHOR IF YOU CAN."
,kyzumi,2012-12-09T01:34Z,Please forgive my slow upload rate! I am trying to seed the best I can! It is going slow but I guarantee I will seed it until it is done!
,kyzumi,2012-12-20T06:41Z,"It seems like I can't seed past the 99.8% mark but I have confirmed that even though people are stuck at 99.8%, all the files are complete. So, if you are stuck at 99.8%, you are actually done and you can finally seed and listen to it! Thank you and please keep seeding!"
,windowless,2012-12-27T01:50Z,Is there anyway you could upload the new single album? Or anyone for that matter im haveing a hard time finding it.
