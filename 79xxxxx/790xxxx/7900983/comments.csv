XIII.The.Series.S02E01.(READ.DESC!!!).(3.quality.choices).(1.torrent)

The text on the screen is in French - the dialog is English

For the five lines in the show that need translating,
I've included a very small .srt file if you know how to use it.
It works for me (XP / MPC), your mileage may vary.

[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-09T02:50Z,"Thank you cindy25: for the French broadcast info (explains much).

IMDB shows broadcast dates for only six of the 13 season 2 eps.
The other seven just say 2012.

I wonder who released the Blu-Ray the my UseNet benefactor provided.

From Amazon to here at good ol' TPB, it's all new.

It's fun when I'm first (almost never happens).
