,RTT2,2012-12-09T11:35Z,"Oh dear. 'Cranks supporting cranks' time again. You give credence to the alien conspiracy by accepting 'evidence', and 'explaining' them as 'fallen angels'. 

It's the same thing I noticed years ago when I saw evangelicals giving credence to ludicrous occultists. See also the Catholic church's support for 'The Exorcist', a film they would surely want to ban if 'possession' was not the explanation. 

They support each other in their delusions. Sad."
