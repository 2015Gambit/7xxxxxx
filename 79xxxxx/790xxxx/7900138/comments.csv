The best image stitching technology in the world.
Behind Autopano Giga's simplicity and ease of use lurks a stitching engine based on advanced algorithms. The image stitching technology (SIFT) included in Autopano Giga was developed as part of a research project at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver (Canada). It has been mathematically proven to be the best technology in the world at recognizing similarities between images.

Thanks "

You inverted the 32 bits and 64 bits files so the 64 bits torrent contains the 32 bits file and the 32 bits torrent contains the 64 bits file.

I noticed that the 64 bits torrent was containing a too small file when I checked on the official site and then I decided to download (and install) the 64 bits file from the official site.

Then, I used your serial with internet OFF and it worked.

I'm not sure the serial will work with the 32 bits file however."
