,iPlunder,2012-12-09T09:35Z,"Is there supposed to be a confirmation upon successful registration?

I've done this 8 times now, and there's been no confirmation. Never had such difficulty patching Path Finder before.

I successfully apply the patch then open PF.
Next I generate a password and paste it into the registration window.
When I click Apply, nothing happens."
,snaky.by,2012-12-09T10:09Z,"@iPlunder, go to Path Finder->Registration, you should see something like ""Registered to xxxx users"" below field with serial."
,iPlunder,2012-12-10T09:02Z,"I've seen that license window with all the previous versions, but all I get with this one is the registration window.

That's why I asked if this patch was supposed to give confirmation.

I do have v6.1.2 installed and it's not telling me I have xx days left for the demo, so it appears to be registered but isn't showing the license window."
