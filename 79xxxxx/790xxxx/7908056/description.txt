I found this on another tracker a while ago and now it's nowhere to be found so therefore i can't give credits to the original uploader. It's the only high resolution version i found and the video is better than any other torrent uploaded on the Pirate Bay until now.

Some of the stats i found, i can't list more because i'm not an expert.
