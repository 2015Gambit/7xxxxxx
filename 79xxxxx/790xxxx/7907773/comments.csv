,Ghostv33,2012-12-10T13:05Z,does this actually works?
,PattyrRob,2012-12-10T18:07Z,Anything from Tony Blair will work. Going to grab it now.
,Rambunction,2012-12-10T22:26Z,"Works great. First thing it did was remove your
keygen. LOL"
,bmercer94,2012-12-11T16:11Z,"Yes, it does work, and naturally removes the keygen due to false positives. turn off active protection for 5/15 minutes to get your key."
,bmercer94,2012-12-11T16:15Z,"As you can see: reported as keygen(obviously), false positives:

,anonraaa,2012-12-12T07:40Z,"its not working on windows 8 x64 !!

it says cant install driver etc etc....."
,bmercer94,2012-12-13T00:03Z,"@anonraaa i've only seen one other person report this, and i'm honestly not sure why. I believe it may be a windows 8 issue though, as i'm using w7 x64 with no issues."
,ArtepSkywork,2012-12-13T19:34Z,Yeah unsure what it is but this version or Premium does not like windows 8 or isn't made for windows 8. Just installed a trial version from there site and installed fine.
,ArtepSkywork,2012-12-13T20:41Z,"Continued - I downloaded another version 3.xxx it installed, used the keygen (Which does work) then the shitty auto update came on and canceled my activation. I downloaded another 4.xxx torrent which allowed me to upgrade the current 3.xxx version, it installed fine but the keygen was useless. It does work but I'm not sure why you have to have the 3.xxx version first, which in the end will cancel the activation. So if your windows 8 just wait for another torrent for compatibility or find another AntiVirus. I had AVG, but apparently doesn't work with Windows 8."
,anonraaa,2012-12-14T12:42Z,"yeah i think also that this  has issues with windows 8, its not made for it!

i installed vipre internet security 2013 with trial reset 2 weeks ago...it worked fine, but i tried to reset days and reset didnt work that day...uploader on that slovenian torrent page said that the reset worked on windows 7, he confirmed that, but on windows 8 nobody tried except me! i will upload maybe  vipre internet security 2013!"
,Ffej5647,2012-12-27T22:45Z,"@ArtepSkywork, downlaod this, run keygen and get the lifetime license. Then go to website, www.vipreantivirus.com and download the 2013 internet security trial and install. It will have the same lifetime license after it installs. 

its as easy as 123  :)"
