,BobVilaHomeAgain,2012-12-17T11:54Z,"Doesn't work for me. When I press play it says ""The Steam servers are currently too busy to handle your request. Please try again in a few minutes"". Not sure what is wrong. Tried installing twice and have been getting the same error."
,IiTraxiI,2012-12-18T12:30Z,"Hello everyone for those having problems Train Simulator recently updated we have released it here: http://1337x.org/torrent/443309/Train-Simulator-2013-Steam-Cracked-Edition/ 

@BobVilaHomeAgain make sure you are not using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) when trying to log in.

@dilinwe there will be no portable version as Steam is required to play this game.

@sunnyzafar we are no longer uploading to The Pirate Bay due to restrictions on page coding: please visit us either on our website: http://www.railgamer.co.uk, or at http://railworkscentral.com. We still upload torrents over at: http://1337x.org/user/RailGamer/
