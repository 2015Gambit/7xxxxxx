[T],MrUnpopular,2012-12-10T04:55Z,Guys it's a big file since it's the direct transport stream in 1080i format in 5.1 audio. There's no compression or anything. It's the real deal.

,balanced,2012-12-10T12:56Z,"For those complaining about the size of the download we who are downloading it would just like you to know that when we watch something we want to watch the entire thing rather than compressed bits and pieces of it.

As I'm typically prone to writing on the topic:  anything less than this is fucking shit."
,Nitrousbird,2012-12-10T13:56Z,"I'm very thankful for these uploads.  All these ""1GB"" files qb87 and domtriga like are crap.  Always have artifacts, usually are 2 channel audio, many times having motion issues (jitter in the video).  This is the real deal and I wish all uploads were like these  "
,Indiana85,2012-12-11T06:36Z,"yo shabbamanuk...next time keep your mouth shut about what happens!! Been waiting all week for this episode...people come here to download cause they haven't seen them yet! Not a blog to discuss what happens in the episode

Cheers

BTW domtriga don't run cause it's a big file...if you have any appreciation for quality and the uploads that Secludedly does you would gladly take this file and on that note Secludedly thanx for the amazing uploads...flawless!!"
