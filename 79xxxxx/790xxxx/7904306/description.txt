Edgar G. Ulmer's Detour begins when hitchhiker Al Roberts  accepts a ride from affable gambler Charles Haskell Jr.  When Haskell suffers a fatal heart attack, Roberts, afraid that he'll be accused of murder, disposes of the body, takes the man's clothes, wallet, car and identity,  begins driving the car himself. But thanks to a blackmailing dame, Roberts' every move plunges him deeper into trouble.
