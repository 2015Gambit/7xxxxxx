Tom's a student who hires out a room in Hyapatia's house and Ms. Lee's a weird (land)lady who seems to lead a rather reserved lifestyle. Sunny and Mike are Tom's friends who break his room in with a nice fuck (while Tom's in the shower) and the next day, Tom also breaks his room in with girlfriend Madison. One day, Hyapatia surprises Tom when she nearly makes sexual advances towards him and lets him know that he should forget about school because she'll teach him all he needs to know.
The next day, she has a confrontation from Mike, who's concerned that Tom is failing school and puts the blame on Hyapatia. But he can clearly see that Hyapatia's a voluptuous woman indeed and falls for her tender charms as well.

In the end, Hyapatia and a bevy of babes take Byron on and when they're all done, Tom sneaks downstairs to enter some forbidden (?) room. Once he opens the door, we see a surprised look on his face with a cheesy audio of a creature growling and a man screaming (supposed to be Tom). Then 'to be continued'. As far as I know, a sequel was never made.
