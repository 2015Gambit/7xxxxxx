If J.Bourne were in love and fighting to save five children, you'd have FALLING UP. Jesse is an American on the run in Cologne, Germany. Suddenly he is given the chance to help a beautiful social worker with five children she took from a trafficker. As Jesse fights for the children he begins to like himself again, and begins to remember the family man he used to be. He even remembers love when he speaks with the children's keeper, the beautiful and mysterious Zaid, a half German and half Ethiopian gypsy.

In order to buy the children a future, Jesse, with the aid of an old spy and a Jamaican ladies' man, plans a huge scam--to sell 150 kilos of fake hashish at a rock festival, under the nose of the cop obsessed with arresting him, and the trafficker who is out to tear his heart from his chest.

It is a modern, gritty story of love on the street.
