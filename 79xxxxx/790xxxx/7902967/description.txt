The Honor Bound series is a World War II thriller series by W.E.B. Griffin, with the latest three books co-authored by William E. Butterworth IV (Griffin's son). The series takes place mostly in Argentina, but also deals with internal struggles within the Nazi Party as the war escalates. Griffin based the events in the books partially on historical events, and relies heavily on his own connections and experiences in Argentina to flesh out the story.
