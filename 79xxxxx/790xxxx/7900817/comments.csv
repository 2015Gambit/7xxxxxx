,JaisJose,2012-12-12T07:58Z,"Where Is This Program data,orbit ,46 and all?"
,tflagger997,2012-12-13T20:38Z,So R.A.M.O. how about you actually test these before claiming they work?
,DontHackMeBro,2012-12-14T22:30Z,Works perfectly for me. Thanks so much!
,Gaurav2107,2012-12-17T05:54Z,"For those who cant save their progress try this:
Go to your installation folder-C:Program FilesFarCry 3bin and locate orbit_api file.Open it and change the GameId=46 to GameId=48.Save it and run the game as administrator always."
,R.A.M.O,2012-12-22T17:48Z,"For Those Who Are Having Saving Issues.....!!!

1. First backup the save files located in ""46"" folder in C:program dataorbit (i.e) [3 files] located in the 46 folder.

2.Now change the folder name from 46 to 48.

3.Now copy the backup and overwrite the original in 48 folder.

4.Now run the game as admin.(Some people might notice the ""LOAD GAME "" option is now available with your last save).

5.If ""LOAD GAME"" is not available, Quit the Game.Now, Repeat the "" Step No.3 "".

6.Now, Restart your PC.

7.Now,Run the game as ""ADMIN"" and ""YOUR SAVE IS BACK"".

8.This is not a permanent solution,that means you could the face the problem of "" NOT ABLE TO LOAD THE SAVE GAME "" anytime.

9.My advice is that whenever you quit the game after reaching some level in the game , backup the save file by doing the "" STEP NO:1 "" [Hereafter the folder name is 48].

Believe me guys i've played the game about 20 hrs at one point of time i lost my save and now
i'm about to complete the game.I've installed blackbox version.

ALWAYS REMEMBER : 
1.Backup your save file after quitting the game.
2.If you can load your last save,that means no problem.
3.If you're unable to load the last save.
4.Do the "" STEP NO:3 ""
5.Restart your pc
6.Now play the game from where you left........!!!

PEACE OUT..............!    "

for ppl that cant get it working, this is what I did

install game, copied orbit_api to bin, launched game worked (folder 46 isnt generated til the game is launched. if you copy orbit_api BEFORE you launch the game, the folder generated will be titled 48.

right click farcry DX11 or whatever version u use, go to properties, compatability, run as administrator. apply exit launch, and ur good"
