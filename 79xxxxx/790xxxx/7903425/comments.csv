@chedderz66, that is how these movies are supposed to work, small fights leading to medium fights leading to the final big showdown where one side is left standing. mixed with a lot ob blood and gore and bad faked hair. Yes, the acting in not top notch but by far not the worst movie ever"

As this is supposed to be a tribute-esque film (i.e Kill Bill) to classic Kung Fu cinema i have to say that topping Kill Bill would be a chore for even Tarantino (why he's vowed to never make a 3rd even though it's already written). The only comment i will make on the acting etc is RZA should stick to music its clearly what he does best. "

It had a couple of decent moments and overall it was ""good enough"" to watch to the end but it's a far removal from the path Bruce Li's led us down. Don't expect the realistic fighting of Blood Sport, Ong Bak, Chocolate, The Raid and it's a far cry from the interesting Wuxia of Hero, House of Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."

Blocky in parts, audio is super bass-heavy. Even with my sub turned off and bass dialed down on my mixer it was still near impossible to sit through. I'd say wait for a proper DVDRip to come out, but from what I did sit through, it's not worth the bandwidth. Big fan of RZA, but this movie is just shit. Dried, crusted, aged bird shit, to be exact.

,dlarrym1111,2012-12-15T04:00Z,"It's a great quality upload, my only criticism is that it is cropped so that the hard coded subs cannot be seen. Otherwise, it is a V/10-A/8 (it is a bit loud, the uploader also ramped up the gain from what its FLAT/original gain was at. I wish it had been uploaded as is, not modified by the uploader. Why assume that the entire 30 million+ people that use this site will want the same modifications as the uploader. Every uploader can find the apps needed to modify a movie any way they wish. There is no need to make those choices with the assumption that we (the downloading members or guests) want our movie to look and play the same as the uploader. PLEASE give us the option to make those changes, we are not children (or at least I am not, and I know many others are not, i can't speak for everyone. Sadly some peoples CHRONOLOGICAL age doesn't match there maturity or lack there of).
I am not bitching, just offering constructive criticism 
If you watch closely, especially the part where it shows the Hero's origin in the cave with the laying BUDDA all in Gold, you can see just the White dots that are the tips of the subs. They move from one spoken phrase to the next. The monk is speaking Chinese (Mandarin I think) and as I said the very top of the letters in the subs (i have no idea what language the subs are in) can be seen as white dots across the bottom. the dots move as the monk continues to speak.
NOT only are we NOT getting these subs which may have been helpful (since they were cropped we will never know, and even if they are not in a  language I understand, I'd rather have them there as the cropping takes away the bottom part of the viewable movie as well. Think about all the times that there were no subs. It is cropped so the bottom is missing from the entire movie not just cropped where the subs are.
I wish uploaders wouldn't crop ANY PART of ANY movie."
,dlarrym1111,2012-12-15T04:07Z,"Last thing, I do want to make clear, I DO APPRECIATE this upload, and other then the fore mentioned modification, I think it is an excellent upload.
The Video clairity is great, the audio is great for the most part, a little loud, but very good. OVERALL, the movie is very very watchable. The cropping isn't so bad that I would totally slam the uploader. I just wanted to take this upload as an example of why uploaders should NOT modify a movie they get ahold of. This may have already been modified before  got it in his possession.

,jmenelow,2012-12-22T23:58Z,"Had high hopes for this one. As soon as RZA's character called himself a ""blacksmif"", I was done. "

,keanu501,2013-01-01T06:08Z,the audio is out of sync =[
,MightySwami,2013-01-01T08:47Z,"Made an account just to say, V-2 (nice graphics but serious who in their right mind purposely crops subtitles?) A-7, slight distortion, don't turn your audio too high to hear what RZA is saying, the moron just can't pronounce words properly. M-3, I got sooo amped for this and it was such a let down, don't let RZA anywhere near a movie ever again, directing or acting. He even failed at narrating, like how do you do that?"
,macwun,2013-01-01T09:21Z,mp3 audio wtf? crap
,headstone5,2013-01-01T16:15Z,"Really wanted this to be good.

RZA performance was weak. Story was meh. Action was good.

Thanks Acesn8s...very good quality, but wow does this movie suck.  I like cheesy martial arts movies, but this is just painfully bad.  "
