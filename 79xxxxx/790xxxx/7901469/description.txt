DESCRiPTiON

Years after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third
Street Saints have evolved from street gang to
household brand name, with Saints sneakers, Saints
energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobble head dolls
all available at a store near you.
The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity
status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary
criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the
globe,has turned its eye on the Saints and demands
tribute. Refusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the
fight to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to
a struggling city of sin under Syndicate control.
Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted
airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and defend
yourself against a highly-trained military force using
only a sex toy in the most out- landish gameplay
scenarios ever seen, igniting a city-wide war that
will set Steelport on fire. Strap it on.
