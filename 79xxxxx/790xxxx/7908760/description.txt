Brightly - Sarah 7" (+ film clip)
---------------------------------

Brightly are a Melbourne-based indie pop band, combining elements of
folk and electronica.

They have followed up their debut release "We Were In Tokyo & Then We Woke Up"
with a 7" vinyl single, "Sarah".

Inspired by Hotel Max (before closing down) on Melbourne's Commercial Road,
Charlie describes Sarah as "a period of time when my friends and I would sit
in bars, getting drunk and rambling about past relationships. It is a metaphor
for the shared experience of being ready to fall in love, but not being sure
who with".

With a live show that takes advantage of their multi-instrumental background,
rampant enthusiasm and a enduring love of glitter, Brightly is a riotous
soiree late into the pitch black night, awaiting morning.

"Sarah" was recorded at Ony's house and Charlie's apartment, and features
saxophone courtesy of Marcus De Fazio. It was produced, mixed and mastered by
Andrei "Ony" Eremin at Jack The Bear's.

In MP3 and WAV formats, with an additional MP4 film clip.
