Flamenco guitarist Roni Benise will help you pass the time with his brilliant music.
Included are 5 studio albums and 1 live one I believe. I was browsing a Russian forum and found this excellent pack. They're very hard to come by so big thanks to the Russians.

Albums included:
Carnaval
Mediterranea
Nights Of Fire (with extras)
Romance & Passion
Spanish Nights
Taboo
