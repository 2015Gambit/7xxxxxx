New remaster from commercial DVD of The Glass Slipper, MGM's 1955 retelling of the Cinderella story, with Leslie Caron and Michael Wilding. The film is a sort of followup to Lili, which involved many of the same talents two years earlier - director Charles Walters, writer Helen Deutsch and composer Bronislau Kaper. Joining them is choreographer Roland Petit and his Ballet de Paris for a couple of splashy fantasy dance scenes. While not as successful as Lili, the film has its charms nonetheless. Kaper and Deutsch came up with another enchanting song, Climbing Rose (Take My Love), and Estelle Winwood is a delighful scene-stealer as the Fairy Godmother
