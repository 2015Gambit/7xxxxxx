"The Day the Earth Stood Cool"

Homer wants a younger, hipper image, so he 
starts hanging out with Terrence (guest 
voice Armisen) and Emily (guest voice 
Brownstein), his cool new neighbors from 
Portland, OR. But Marge finds their trendy 
parenting methods extreme and Bart quickly 
realizes their son, T-Rex (guest voice 
Oswalt), is super-pretentious.

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
