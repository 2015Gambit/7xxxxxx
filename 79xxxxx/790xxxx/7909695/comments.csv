[V],PirateBoy,2012-12-11T21:54Z,"@ Shekharda

First of all, thanks for the compliments.

Now, as for Max Payne 3, just as ""gansuk"" here told above, there won't be any Max Payne 3 release from KaOs. I hope you are satisfied now that gansuk himself has given the same reply as me.

Anyways, if you are still not satisfied and think that insulting a member would bring out a MaxPayne 3 release from Kaos, then go on and insult me more cuz i really cant be arsed with some ""words"" from a chinese guy named ""Shekhar Shinde"" lol.

Wait a sec... a Chinese guy named ""Shekhar Shinde""??? Are you f***ing kiddin me??? O.o"

,doritoman,2012-12-12T01:59Z,why would you rip the map editor?? disappointed. its like removing 50% of the game basically.
,crossebby,2012-12-12T07:00Z,"@pirateboy 

Forgive him, coz they don't know how much it takes to rip and put it online. Poor souls. 

Thanks to KAOS, I am big fan of U guys. I love all."

,Munro98,2012-12-13T00:39Z,My saved game get deleted when I exit. Could someone help and fix it and also tell me where the saved games are stored.
,crazyman1,2012-12-13T05:16Z,"@Munro98

i read somewhere that u need to exit first to the menu and then continue the game and then exit to the menu and then to desktop. seems like a lot to do but thats what i am doing and i have no problems so far...and run the exe in admin and do not save manually tooo...just give it a try "

,Protoss01,2012-12-13T13:38Z,Why no max payne 3???? :(
[V],PirateBoy,2012-12-13T16:38Z,"@ Protoss01 and all who are waiting for Max Payne 3

Some games like Max Payne 3, Rage, LA Noire, The Amazing Spiderman, etc... are not worth releasing because they are not much compressable or rather ""rip""-able. In fact, its better that you download the scene release of those games. So, we do not release those kinda games which are not worth releasing as a rip.

Hope you understand."
,Catalyzer,2012-12-13T16:41Z,"@shekharda : calm down u r abusing ppl limitlessly for no apparent reason , m watching over ur posts , ur free to comment what ever u want but really .... getting this abusive , the freedom that u have over the internet sitting on the other side and saying what u feel like shudnt be overdone too !
if some1 cant rip a game that u ask for like Max Payne 3 u wanted from Kaos then u find another rip , abusing their team members or saying all these things abt them doesnt make u look smart in front of anyone ! i downlaoded a rip from blackbox and i m happy with it , appreciate the fact that u get it for free , Kaos dont get paid from u or any1 else , so forcing them to your will ... is not possible , a sincere request is what u can ask for !
and a person by the name of ""Skekhar Shinde"" and saying he is chinese , doesnt even fit in properly !
to make things better for you , i will speak it out in a language we both talk and understand : 
""jara tu thand ghe re mitra , evdha chidun saglyanvar kahi honar nahi , te hi vinakran ""
if u think this comment i made was useless and shud be ignored , just do it then , and please dont start arguing with me now after this , i wont even heed to wat u say 
take it as a advice and leave it or else continue the flame war , idnt care mch "

,crazyman1,2012-12-15T10:00Z,"@ PirateBoy

so is black ops 2 also in that nonrippable list??? just wondering coz none of the rippers (tptb and blackbox) are uploading them"
[V],PirateBoy,2012-12-16T20:54Z,"@ crazyman1

To all who are waiting for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 from KaOs, we can't say anything about it now because currently there aren't any good tools out to rip the game. We may try it in the future once there are tools good enough to use on it.

So, keep your fingers crossed."

also is there a confirmed fix for it?"
,yesterdays_pirate,2013-01-01T01:25Z,"@SecondSystem, Maybe something is replacing a FC3.dll or FC3_d3d11.dll?

This is common when using a modded or cracked game, and the crack/mod FC3.dll or FC3_d3d11.dll you replaced is not edited to use cracked uplay_r1_loader.dll and ubiorbitapi_r2_loader.dll.
