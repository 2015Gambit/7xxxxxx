This episode is crazy, they bring in a hipster type family and demonize the hell out of them.

The hipsters make a garden, and in turn a fire could not be put out because the garden uses all the water.

They try to steal marges baby because she doesnt breast feed, how brainwashing is this shit? Nobody should watch this especially kids"
