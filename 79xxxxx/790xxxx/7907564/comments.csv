,okbymyself,2012-12-11T00:43Z,"This copy is TRASH, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.

Whoever the idiot is that uploaded it did a very bad job. The frame rate is all fucked up so the picture quality is about 2/10.

Don't waste your time, another version uploaded by TvTeam can be found here:

Hopefully SCSA420 will continue to do the PPVs soon as well as all the wonderful uploads of Impact that he does consistently every week. For those of us old school wrestling fans who have re-discovered TNA, we would be nothing without SCSA420. Always support his torrents first. Thanks"
,AcesM,2012-12-11T06:16Z,"@okbymyself, shut up ... this copy is way better then avi version that u promote ... just look at the seeders different ... :p"
,Fonze532,2012-12-11T10:10Z,"Yeah, this copy is a PoS, frames are all jerky, no offence but as of this year, S4A, coming closer to the end of the year, the quality of your uploads have sucked. I always downloaded WWE things from you, now I don't touch them, I get them from SCSA420"
,fuckyou579,2012-12-11T16:12Z,this verson is fucked beyond fucked
,LAMBORGHINI39M,2012-12-11T18:39Z,where is the 720p version?
,dididie,2012-12-12T00:33Z,"Not to be a dick, because Scene4all usually does a great job, but it's like watching on a shitty internet connection to youtube.  Very choppy throughout, so the actual matches are unwatchable unless you already have a nervous twitch.  Then maybe this would be perfect for you.  Thanks for trying... i guess."
,LAMBORGHINI39M,2012-12-14T09:12Z,"quality below 720p is bad ,so i pass this ,and i will wait for the 720p or im not gonna download it."
,Mercury8215,2012-12-16T23:47Z,I didn't download this torrent because of the quality complaints.  I downloaded the torrent suggested by okbymyself and the quality is pretty good for such a small file.  I recommend it too.
