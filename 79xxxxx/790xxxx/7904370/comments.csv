I haven't received a single bit. 

Why didn't you rip straight to FLAC 8?"
,iPlunder,2012-12-19T22:35Z,It's finally seeding! Thanks.
,iPlunder,2012-12-23T23:14Z,"Well it WAS seeding, everyone's been stuck at 95% for several days."
,iPlunder,2012-12-28T09:33Z,"Nothing to see here folks, move along.

This MORON uploaded the same torrent 10 days apart, and they're both dead - hasn't moved in a week, everyone stuck at 95%."
