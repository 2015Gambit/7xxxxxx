,P3nc3kez,2012-12-09T01:07Z,can anyone confirm if this is legit or not?
,IPASuperior,2012-12-09T01:34Z,"@P3nc3kez

I was trying to make a sample, but I gave up. I'm currently rendering video for a project atm, but I'm sure someone has to have finished downloading it. Sorry if I'm not that reassuring. :P"
,P3nc3kez,2012-12-09T03:51Z,"its just that this torrent was so new ;^^
i downloaded it anyways though and it works fun. yay thank you "
,IPASuperior,2012-12-09T04:53Z,"@P3nc3kez

Ok. All's well then. Yay! :D

So it's ok? No major issues or anything? "
,P3nc3kez,2012-12-09T05:46Z,ehh other than the sound being a bit louder at times than others its fine. i just changed my audio settings to fix it
,IPASuperior,2012-12-09T20:49Z,"Yeah. It was ripped straight from the Blu-Ray disk, so I dunno why. It did that to a bunch of other torrents too. 

I think it's the actual movie."
,DLC....,2012-12-11T05:56Z,"download files just fine, but will not play on any app i use. any advice?"
,shadowswimer,2012-12-11T06:19Z,"there is no audio at all for me, i checked everything."
,DLC....,2012-12-11T06:32Z,"am i missing something here, every time i try to use a different app or program to play this file all i get is new screenshot icons but unable to play/load file/open"
,IPASuperior,2012-12-12T00:58Z,"@DLC

That's a weird problem... :/

@shadowswimer

Again, a weird problem. I don't have any audio problems at all."
,senorpianist,2012-12-16T22:10Z,"there is a problem with audio.except vlc player all other media players that i have dosnt have sound.i have real,winamp,windows media player,divx player.
and even in vlc the sound is blurry hazy from time to time.probably due to a problem while ripping from the blueray disc.to the uploader .thanks for the upload but could u please look into the problem."
,mrt28,2012-12-18T21:22Z,"The sound is screwed up, lots of scratching and in and out audio, using vlc."
,mountainlion2012,2012-12-23T07:30Z,Worthless torrent!!! No sound at all!!!complete waist of 3 hours 
,IPASuperior,2012-12-24T06:02Z,"Just double-checked it. I have no issues with sound or audio. And I'm using Windows Media Player. I do have a custom codec installed though. Try through VLC or use a codec. I'm getting perfect audio UNLESS I try to play it through the torrent app (I use Vuze, get some audio bumps)"
,HipKat,2012-12-28T13:41Z,I've had others that had audio problems on almost everything but VLC Player or Win. Media Player with K-Lite codecs installed. I'll give this a shot and comment back
,HipKat,2012-12-31T15:37Z,"Audio is fine on VLC and Windows Media Player. Video, played on my TV (50"" plasma 1080p) was a little grainy, if you look close up. Some scenes, especially with a lot of smoke in them had a touch of archiving. Nothing serious, but doesn't look like a typical BR Rip. Color isn't very vibrant, but that could be how it was filmed. Either way, it wasn't enough for me to really even notice.

Overall, Good job! And thanks! Great movie!"
,IPASuperior,2012-12-31T17:29Z,"@HipKat
Thanks for the feedback! I was also trying to make it as small as I could, that's the reason for the grainy picture sometimes. But the movie itself is also grainy.

@Everyone else having issues
The issue is that I used an AAC codec that is sometimes not compatible with Windows Media Player. Sorry for this inconvenience."
