Bluray sites report that this has never been released in Bluray?"
,philipo,2012-12-11T21:48Z,"As I said, I have downloaded them, and as the info says: my source is weedson. I dont know him, and I'm not even sure it is bluray, anyways the quality is as for a DVD, and for a series made in 1985 I dont think you can get better quality out there;)"
