[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-10T10:39Z,"Just a heads up, Funimation wont be releasing Blu rays for Index and Zombie desuka. "
,mooserocka,2012-12-11T06:08Z,DAman HONESTLY its FINE. I think 480 downloads faster and looks almost EXACTLY the same. The only dif is sound but who cares i would rather you did 480 all the time but its whatever you put is fine. Just these went so fast i dled both of the new series in a half an hour. While the blu rays take all night.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-11T08:18Z,is not that it takes long is that there this website that grabs the files of Nyaa instantly and hogs all the bandwidth without seeding its really a pain seriously.
,mooserocka,2012-12-13T01:01Z,That stinks. WEll its usually a day process for anything bluray i dont care because you cant complain were getting them without having to go to the store ya kno. Its worth it. It just goes faster 480 and i can barely tell the differance.
