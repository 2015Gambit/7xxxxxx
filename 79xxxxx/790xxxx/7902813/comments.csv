[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-08T23:24Z,"When your download finishes. Don't 'STOP' it. Then your 'SEEDING'. If your having problems finishing the download, re-post and i'll give the torrent more bandwidth/priority.

ALL my uploads from tonight are comparitively small and will be seeded for the next 12hrs at 250kbps."
