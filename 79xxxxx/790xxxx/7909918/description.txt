Once a legend in the brutal world of illicit underground fighting, Shane Slavin (Gary Daniels) decides to turn his life around, promising his wife and young son hes fought his last battle. But when his younger brother betrays a ruthless crime boss (Peter Weller, RoboCop I & II), Shane is forced back into the arena to pay his brothers debts and to protect his family.
