with  PS3 - Rogero CFW4.30 V2.03 , downgrade to 3.55 and QA flag is no longer necessary

also, recovery mode is not necessary

install from USB stick directly from XMB

no bricks reported since release approx 2 weeks ago

if you have been unsure because of all the betas and downgrading.. this is for you

brickproof and simple and only takes 5 mins 

thanks to your upload:
