,morug,2012-12-26T20:16Z,"Hi dohduhdah,

Please read this.

I come from a poor family, my dad is mentally disabled and my mom worked manual labor for support me my sister and my dad.

I ended up getting going to college for engineering but my k-12 schooling was shit. Schools in poor neighborhoods really are shit. I need these videos to refresh my skills and you have everything related to math.

Knowledge should NOT be restricted to kids who have inherited money from their parents (i.e., those who have not earned it).

It is (in my system of ethics) immoral.

Whatever reason you are doing what you are doing, know that you are really saving lives of people who love knowledge yet are denied access due to what their parents failed to do in life.

If you pm me on the forum, I'd be happy to send you books I've scanned (I cut up my books and scan them for convenience). I don't know how torrenting works and I don't care about credit.

I'll also buy you a beer if you want."

Though i don't believe education should be free, i do believe in our society it's treated too much of a commodity and is overpriced and overvalued.

For anyone interested they have some free online courses at MIT, http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/"
