Overview:

What happened to the humans? Set in a post-apocalyptic world strewn with cast-off pieces of machinery, Primordia tells the story of Horatio Nullbuilt, who finds his peaceful existence threatened when a rogue robot steals his power core the sole source of energy fueling his ship and keeping him alive. To recover it, the robot and his companion, Crispin, must leave behind their idyllic home for Metropol, the city of glass and light. Their quest to reclaim what has been taken away will lead Horatio to unexpected discoveries about his origins and a new understanding of the humans who walked the earth before him.
