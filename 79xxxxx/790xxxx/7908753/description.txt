Anyone who is interested in the secret societies and the evil present in the world today will want to see this video.


This is an extremely clever piece of propaganda issued by the Catholic Church. Masonic rites were written by a Jesuit priest in France prior to May day (May 1st) 1717 (formation of the lodge of England). Under Weishaupt's simple plan for world domination the Jesuits were reborn under the name the Illuminati (The Society of Jesus, or the Jesuit Order) after the pope had disbanded them and he was poisoned for it.

The Jesuit priest reveals certain historical facts about the atomic bombs unleashed upon Japan, and the JFK assassination as well as a few more and reveals the many reasons why satan actually exists.

They use a few quotes to make it appear that the catholic church has excommunicated freemasonry. When in reality they control it through the Jesuit General (Black Pope).

If you have seen The Secrets Behind the Secret Societies, or The Man Behind the Mask by Prof Walter Veith you know the real story as supported by the catholic church's own evidence.

Enjoy, but beware of wolves in sheep's clothing

or as Jesus said; Be careful, allow no to man deceive you!

God bless!
