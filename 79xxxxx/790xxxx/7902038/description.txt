Layered romantic drama The Words follows young writer Rory Jansen who finally achieves long sought after literary success after publishing the next great American novel. There&#x27;s only one catch - he didn&#x27;t write it. As the past comes back to haunt him and his literary star continues to rise, Jansen is forced to confront the steep price that must be paid for stealing another man&#x27;s work, and for placing ambition and success above life&#x27;s most fundamental three words.
