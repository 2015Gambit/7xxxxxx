"DECADES" Her clan destroyed, her family murdered by vampires, Chinatsu, a once- proud female ninja, had nothing left to live for...save revenge. In this centuries-spanning tale of bloodlust and betrayal, Chinatsu, now a vampire herself, tracks the dark lord that turned her all those long years ago. Immortality has only made her need for vengeance stronger as she follows him across the globe, through myriad time periods, battling the undead minions that rise up to stop her.
