,Itbankrock,2012-12-09T04:10Z,"Tested on my Sony Xperia Acro S

Game started, at start everything was good, no hiccups, lags or whatsoever, but when I got on a vehicle, and drived around a bit, my whole phone froze and got no choice but to force restart the phone. I guess I'll wait for the stable version from Rockstar :/"

,arcmay56,2012-12-11T02:34Z,"Worked great on my Galaxy S3.

Just moved sd data to /Android/obb/ and installed the game!"
,AlphaKennyThing,2012-12-11T19:47Z,"If you're having trouble starting the game and getting black screens place the obb in:

Android/obb/com.rockstargames.gtavc

You're going to have to create a new folder.

Have fun."
,sid5jabi,2012-12-13T12:28Z,"@Darklyse

All you need to do is load the files into the sd card and then once you are into the files explorer go to the Sd card and move this file com.rockstargames.gtavc to the location 
phone storage/android/obb
-----------------------------------
Once you go to the android folder you will see data folder there, but you will need to create the obb folder. Now just move that com.rockstargames.gtavc folder inside the obb folder and keep the .apk installer file in the sd card. Now i assume you have uninstalled the gta vice city if you have tried before and then just simply run the .apk file and you will successfully instal the game on your Note 2. I'm running this game on Note 2 and there is no lag or what so ever. It is running smooth on full 5.5 inch display. "

Put the obb in the

,TorrentRating,2012-12-27T22:04Z,"Good torrent. If you put the obb in the right folder it works fine.
Doesn't play very well on Kindle Fire HD. Speed is fine, but definite corruption in the graphics making it more or less unplayable."
