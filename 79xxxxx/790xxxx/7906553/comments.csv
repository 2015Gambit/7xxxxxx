,JarjarTwink,2012-12-10T04:03Z,"haha i thought you were just racist, but checked imdb it's actually called motherfucker with a turban. 

dude, you can swear on tpb. it's ok. "
,rhodyvik,2012-12-10T04:22Z,"I thought this was called ""The Motherfucker with a Turban"" according to Wikipedia. Obviously I'm not using Wikipedia as my #1 source of info, lol. This doesn't make sense how it's out before it has even aired on Showtime at 10pm EST. It's now 10:22pm EST. It hasn't finished. They would never show it early in any other country like they do the 10pm shows that air in the USA but at 7pm in Canada."
,rhodyvik,2012-12-10T04:34Z,I will take back my previous comment. This is actually the legit 11th episode! How awesome is this. NICE UP ETTV! Fucking stellar.
,xcfzm94,2012-12-10T04:37Z,"i just went over it quickly it looks like the right episode, the preview included the previous episode so im pretty damn sure it is, you should change the title tho misleading "
,mrmouth,2012-12-10T04:49Z," MKV that is totally unfriendly for media players because he/they haven't learned to tick a few boxes on the software. Also wont convert with MKV2VOB.

 A proper x264 upload in mp4 would be about the same size, so it makes absolutely no sense.

 Run the fuck away until MSD comes correct."
,HKCannibal,2012-12-10T05:22Z,"Thank ettv!
The only doubt was regarding the name of the episode, which was previously ""The Motherfucker with a Turban"" (IMDb), and now came out as ""In Memoriam.""

I appreciate the versions on WEB-DL because of that, the speed at which they are available, for those who commented earlier, this has no relation with the tv, because this episode is available on iTunes."

,makeyourself,2012-12-10T05:51Z,fuckin leachers 
,nessinator,2012-12-10T06:39Z,.mkv is the worst file format. Never had a file from ettv thats like that. Thanks for your effort every week though =)
,Gonzotabb,2012-12-10T06:53Z,"Shut the fuck up ""makeyourself"". Most people are still downloading it for fuck sake. I'm sure you can wait a little bit, if it's such a pain in the ass go order showtime"

,Dwch,2012-12-10T22:43Z,"The name of the episode was FORMERLY ""The Motherfucker with a Turban"" but is now renamed ""In Memoriam"".

Showtime is the network that airs Homeland, so it doesn't get more official than that."
