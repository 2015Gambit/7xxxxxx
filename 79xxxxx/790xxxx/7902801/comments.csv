there's nothing wrong with the file.
it works fine.

no one else has said it's ""broken"", or reported
any type of problem.

you are obviously missing some pieces.

try restarting the torrent to pick up the
pieces you are missing.

i just watched it again and there is
absolutely no problem in any player, as
well as when i play it on my tv from
an ext HDD or wirelessly from my laptop
to my tv or phone. It also plays perfectly
on ,y Archos 7."
