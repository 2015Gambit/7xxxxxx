Tom's new book, The Little BIG Things, is a compendium of 163 ways to pursue excellenceΓÇöwith tips ranging from the blatantly obvious, "Show Up! (It's a Start.)" and "It's All About ... the Quality of the Workforce," to the wildly counterintuitive, "Boring Is Beautiful" and "Reward DNK (Do Not Know)," to the often repeated, "The Customer Is 'She.'" Begun as a repackaging of the Success Tips from our blog, this book became so much more as Tom worked and reworked its contents. Now, its main message is that EXCELLENCE is the result of many small tasks, all of which can be practiced and mastered. The Little BIG Things are meant to be sampled, a bit at a time. As Tom says in the Introduction, "My colleagues and I mostly expect you to read the book while sitting on the toilet. (Literally or figuratively.) That is, we hardly imagine that you'll breathlessly read the whole thing from start to finish. Instead, I imagine you'll look at this idea or thatΓÇöand I obviously hope that a few will be compelling enough to induce you to take action."
