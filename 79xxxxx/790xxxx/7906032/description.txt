All Music Guide - Stewart Mason
The first of several albums of songs from the hilarious mid-'90s cartoon show 
Animaniacs, this brief album is filled with surprisingly witty and often 
outlandish song parodies and comic tunes. Songs in the style of Gilbert & 
Sullivan "I Am the Very Model of a Cartoon Individual" and Tom Lehrer "Be 
Careful What You Eat" show that the writers, led by music director Richard 
Stone, know their predecessors in comic music inside and out. Polysyllabic list 
songs like "Yakko's World" and "Wakko's America" fall into this tradition as 
well, while character-based songs like "I'm Mad" and "I'm Cute" are in a more 
Broadway style. Perhaps the best songs are the didactic ones like "The 
Planets" and "The Senses," which impart useful information in a clever, witty 
style not too far removed from They Might Be Giants' kid-oriented tunes. 
Regardless, the album as a whole is surprisingly enjoyable and often 
extremely funny.
