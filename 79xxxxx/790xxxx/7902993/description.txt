"Ex-Wives of Rock" tells the stories of the women who married, divorced and lived to tell the tales of what it means to love a rock star and the lifestyle that comes with it.

Narrated by Shannon Tweed, wife of KISS bassist Gene Simmons, the show chronicles the lives of Athena Lee (ex-wife of Scorpions drummer James Kottak and sister to Tommy Lee), Sharise Neil (ex-wife of Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil), Bobbie Brown (ex-wife of Warrant frontman Jani Lane and once engaged to Tommy Lee) and Susan "Blue" Dixon (ex-wife of Warrant bassist Jerry Dixon) as they struggle to succeed as mothers, business women, friends and spouses after the party's ended and the glory days are over.
