In ‘The Philadelphia Experiment, a secret government research project tries reviving the World War II “Philadelphia Experiment,” which was an attempt to create a cloaking device to render warships invisible. When the experiment succeeds, it brings back the original ship (the Eldridge) that disappeared during the first test in 1943 – which brings death and destruction to the 21st century. Its up to the sole survivor (Lea) of the first experiment and his granddaughter (Ullerup) to stop it.
