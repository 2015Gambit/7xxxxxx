,autobrakes3,2012-12-15T11:45Z,"Hi everyone!

Can someone teach me how to install this into an Ipad correctly? 

I copied the entire ""data"" file into the documents folder but I still do not have any enroute charts.

Also, after i copied the files into my ipad I am still required to enter an Activation code or click demo. Is this normal? 

Thanks!"
,V1RotateV2,2012-12-15T18:12Z,"HEY GUYS! Finally I've been able to make run 1225 FULLY, VFR-enabled, under IOS 6.0.1 and app v2.0, using Diskaid v5.42!

- Erase JEPP FD application and download it from APPLE store.
- Open it once, without having updated anything.
- Close it completely (with X)
- Copy only TermCharts from 1225.
- Erase Enroute Charts (whatever you find in Documents)
- Copy Enroute Charts from 1213.
- Copy OVER PREVIOUS FOLDER, Enroute Charts from 1225.
- If you want to enable VFR Terminal Charts, create your own airportlist.bin file (need jepp.exe application and JeppView for Windows)
- Overwrite the older airportlist.bin with newer one in TermCharts
- Copy FROM ""C:ProgramDataJeppesenCommonTerminalCharts""  TO your IPAD folder ""JeppFDDocumentsdataTermCharts""
theese files: vfrcharts.bin, vfrchrts.dbf, vfrntms.dbf and vfrntms.dbt.

* Note 1: vfrcharts.bin must be writen in LOWERCASE letters, NOT IN CAPITALS.
* Note 2: Google to find jepp.exe application and it's manual.

Voila! FULL JeppFD ;-)"

,b_boy31,2012-12-24T18:55Z,"V1RotateV2 

Just a quick one about your steps....

Erase Enroute charts.....do you mean erase the contents and keep the folder (on disk aid)

Copy OVER PREVIOUS FOLDER, Enroute Charts from 1225

I dont fully understand this bit. Can you explain??

thanks very much"
,V1RotateV2,2012-12-25T21:37Z,"Erasing means, deleting the folder ""Enroute"" after installation (everything inside it also). Then you have to copy ""Enroute"" directory from cycle 1213 and then OVERWRITE ""Enroute"" from actual one cycle."
,b_boy31,2012-12-26T17:40Z,Excellent. Works a treat. Thank you
,jumbodriver,2012-12-30T17:54Z,"Thanks a bunch for the upload! I'm new at this! I've got an iPad 1 ios 5.1.1. JBn; Mac, OS X M.L.. Just haven't been able to get this to work at all, after my green efforts in following your instructions using iExp. For one thing I don't see any Enroute folder in iExp dir of my freshly downloaded JeppFD (I opened it once like you said to do...Do I agree to terms and choose Demo as well before closing & moving onto the iExp steps?)?! What I see don't match your step by step instruction. Pls help, cheers & HAPPY NEW YEAR."
