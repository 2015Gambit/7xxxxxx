,cgculpepper,2012-12-12T00:14Z,"THIS IS A QUOTE OF THE RESPONSE I GOT FOR ASKING TO HAVE THIS TORRENT MOVED

""CerberusStyle
Today 13:48

Torrents containing MP3 (audio) files will not work in the Movies section and we wont move them to help you bypass a deliberate site block. Plus You also have URL web files in there and they are not allowed either.

and if you ask again you will be banned.""
