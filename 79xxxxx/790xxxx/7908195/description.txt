Barbara Stanwyck Filmography pt.2 cgculpepper


At this time I've seeded "Barbara Stanwyck Filmography pt.1 cgculpepper"
to a ratio of 16:1 (116GB). Currently 4 seeds & 6 peers including myself.
I know these old movie torrents are hard to keep alive , hoping grouping 
them will help. I stopped seeding my Bogart DvD's as there were to many 
hit&runs.

note For English on "1933 The Bitter Tea of General Yen" play with MPC
I can't load seperate audio with VLC.

note Included Spanish & Russian subs along with the English where available 
as that is where many of these come from.

note Some of these movies were Extremely difficult to find. If anyone knows of 
files (1.5gb or less) that are better than what I'm uploading please leave 
a link in comments.
