,e343balla,2012-12-15T08:06Z,"you guys this isnt spam
Im DL'ing this and then just going to youtube for track 5, im using software from ""maniactools.com"" its a youtube to mp3 converter/DL tool and actually it does WAV and mp4 i think also. try it, its free and its better than waiting for a new upload since nobody seems to have the Itunes version, just look it up on youtube lol"
,Forerunners,2012-12-15T10:15Z,It's only $6.99 on iTunes but your quality is better! I just want to tell you how much I love you
