This CD includes two pieces for an extraordinary combination of forces: solo 
viola, chorus, and orchestra (or percussion). Composers Giya Kancheli and 
John Tavener are frequently classified as "holy minimalists," but the 
designation "holy post-modernist" would be more accurate, if decidedly less 
spiritual sounding. Both composers are products of secular societies, have 
developed a preoccupation with spiritual topics in their music, and have 
rejected the prevailing modernism of their times in favor of a style, which in 
spite of its emotional directness and simplicity can't by any stretch of the 
imagination be legitimately characterized as minimalism. One characteristic 
that links Kancheli and the other so-called "holy minimalists" such as Górecki 
and Pärt is the earnest sobriety of their music. It would be ungenerous to 
characterize the work of such a diverse group of composers as humorless, 
but (particularly among those who suffered for the bulk of their professional 
lives under the artistic restrictions of the Eastern Bloc) their work is often 
notable for its relentlessly somber tone. That is the case of the two works 
recorded here. The darkness of the viola in its lower register and the 
agonized wail of its absolutely highest notes make it an apt vehicle for 
Kancheli's and Tavener's sober and sometimes anguished visions, and they 
write for it with great expressiveness. Both composers use the chorus 
orchestrally, more to create a particular textural color than to convey textual 
content, and their choral writing is inventive and colorful. The works are 
harmonically sumptuous and richly imagined, and they have an undeniably 
powerful emotional fiber. Violist Maxim Rysanov and conductor Máris Sirmais, 
leading the Liepaja Symphony Orchestra, the youth choir, Kamer…, and the 
State Choir Latvija perform with all the virtuosity and wrenching intensity the 
works require.
