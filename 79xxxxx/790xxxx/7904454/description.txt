The game features beautifully rendered land and space battles set on
memorable planets such as Hoth, Tatooine and Dagobah as well as
never-before-seen environments taken directly from the Star Wars films
and expanded universe novels. In the game, players can choose to join
either the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire, building and setting up
tactical forces that can be unleashed on the enemy in real-time 3D. All of
the gameplay and action within Star Wars Empire at War is persistent,
meaning that strategic and tactical elements from previous events will
have a permanent effect on the galaxy.
