There are 10 seasons.... i think 210 episodes total (150 and a half hours), from the original stargate 1994 film to the newest 2 stargate films.

HOWEVER keep in mind The 1994 film is only partially connected to the stargate series and series films.

I'm in no real position to be able to encode the series itself.... it's far to much data.... hours... and i don't have them on bluray. I would suggest perhaps looking for the entire series as a total torrent somewhere.

Sorry"
