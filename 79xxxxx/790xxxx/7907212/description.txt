In Regards to the Splitting of the file into 2 parts, this is actually the way the Collectors Extended Edition is presented. Each of the 3 movies have been split onto 2 separate bluray disks.

Ideally I would have combined the files into a single Mp4... but although the first two fall dangerously within the FAT32 4GB limit, the last one will not. So to keep the files and their structures in tact, to also avoid any potential encoding problems and to make certain the subtitles worked as intended without falling out of sync, each part is in tact identical to what the bluray disk arrangements are.


Compliant with Xbox360/PS3/iPads/Mobile Devices/etc. devices that require the primary Audio stream to be AAC Stereo (many do not accept/work with AAC 5.1 format). Audio Stream 2 available to those that also wish to experience great 5.1 sound that goes right alongside great picture quality.

For those experiencing LOW VOLUME issues, try to playback the 2nd Audio stream in stereo mode, this should improve audio quality and increase the volume substantially.

If you wish to experience 5.1 audio on the original PS3 or Newer PS3, Just select the audio options and ensure the 5.1 stream/track is selected.

PC Users will have to use something like VLC that allows you to choose the 2nd Audio stream/track, Depending on your configuration, vlc should automatically enable 5.1 playback after the track change, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 5.1
