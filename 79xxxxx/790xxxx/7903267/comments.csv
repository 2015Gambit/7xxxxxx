,Lucixir,2012-12-27T00:32Z,"Great copy, 10/10
Question: What is the difference between the 720 version and 1080 version, other than file size. I have a 2 year old 50inch LG Plasma that was top of the line when I bought it, even compared to the 1080's out at the time and I am not sure which copies I should be viewing. Some people say always use 1080 and it will make it the best it can be, others have said use the 720 because anything over is a waste. Can someone explain which I should be using to optimize to best standard? Thank you for any explanation or reason why I should do which."
