Fantastic series of torrents, every single episode of Samurai (I'm referring to both seasons as Samurai because fuck the 'Super' shit) is flawless.  Despite the fact that Samurai was garbage sometimes, due to the lack of given shits by Saban, you have done a great service to PR fans, and I greatly look forward to your rips of Megaforce as we head into the anniversary season.

Thanks for everything.  See you guys next year, and may the power protect you!"
