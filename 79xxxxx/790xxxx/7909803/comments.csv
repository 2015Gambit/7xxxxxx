Having been a fan of the characters since Academy #1 and the general concept since Initiative #1 ... hell, really since New Mutants & Power Pack in the '80s, I think it's pathetic that Marvel has to take good characters and aim for the lowest common denominator.

But oh well, it's Marvel. What did I expect? Fuck you Dennis, Bill, Alex ... whoever's responsible."
,japman37,2012-12-11T01:41Z,how is this even out...its not supposed to be released till wednesday
,cliftonenrico,2012-12-11T02:26Z,@japman37...the internet...
,1234abcd,2012-12-11T06:05Z,I like Hopeless...gave it a chance...after reading it I won't be buying this and wishing I had never bought an issue of Academy or Initiative. Way to take characters that had to be some of the best written coming from Marvel and throw them away like they were nothing. I'm starting to see what Ed Brubaker told me...maybe I need to stop reading comics from the Big Two.
[V],GunningHawk90,2012-12-11T07:06Z,"I don't believe it. I still fucking don't.

They pick up one of the best ongoings ever and turn it into this piece of trash.

I hope it so happens that these kids are in some sort of dream-reality, and they actually aren't dead when they die in this reality.

Sounds kinda lame, but it's better than what they're showing right now."
,Proteus11,2012-12-11T12:15Z,"I donÂ´t know what the fuck that was. The art is really cool, sure, but who the HELL came up with this concept? It seems... I donÂ´t know, *amazingly* shitty to bring in all these kids, cool characters who have grown and evolved, and just kill them off for teh EDGZY."
,xenoFLASH,2012-12-11T15:41Z,"Since when has Arcade had ""god-like"" powers? I bet this ends with everyone finding out that they have been plugged into a machine, a'la The Matrix, or somethin'. Also, all the work and story lines based on X-23 not just being a killing machine, being used by someone else: out the fucking window!
What a shit concept."
[T],STFmaryville,2012-12-11T15:48Z,"Having slept on it, I'm willing to say the writer's dialogue and the art was good; it's just the whole concept that the editors should've said ""Uhmmm nah. Let's not go there.""

Explained this comic to my wife (she only reads TWD) and her sister, and we all came to the conclusion that just like slasher horror flicks, the plot with a young woman who has sex with her boyfriend then suffers horrendous punishment, which is *particularly* sad about this issue.

Re: the comments ^above^ I agree with you folks. I'm glad I'm not the only one."
,1234abcd,2012-12-11T16:36Z,"I mean Hopeless is talented enough that he should have been able to create throw away characters but still gave us enough characterization that it would have mattered when they died. Create a mini to introduce the characters, don't spoil what will happen to them until the last page of the mini, and then kick off the series having well written characters that aren't already developed into previous long lasting storylines. To me this was lazy of Marvel, lazy of Alonso, and not a good place for Hopeless to start his career with the Big Two. I was even okay with them replacing Peter Parker but this is just bullshit. I certainly hope Cable and the X-Force is better or I might be boycotting all Hopeless's books."
[V],GunningHawk90,2012-12-11T17:50Z,"^On a side note, I really don't think they're gonna replace Peter. It's something much more complicated.

If you notice, the next Avenging Spiderman issue, already includes the Superior Spiderman. If it was a new Spiderman all together, he'd take time like Miles did. Unless of course, the rumors are true and they're bringing back Spidey 2099."
,DreamingFar,2012-12-11T18:35Z,"Damn, I read through Avengers academy in order to catch up for this piece of shit?

It's worse because I actually liked Academy by the end."
,Street_Disciple,2012-12-11T19:49Z,I've never read any Avengers Academy comics before but I read this one because of everyone else's comments.  I don't know what to say... art was good story was brutal. Are the cast of Twilight going to show up next?  
,angrychango,2012-12-12T23:31Z,Hey Dude thanks for the comic! but Bad Quality is Bad
,jfms,2012-12-12T23:50Z,"Don't read this. Go after the original Battle Royale, way better. It's complete in the manga traders site."
,XVkato15,2012-12-13T00:28Z,People stop complaining about the book and be happy you got it for free... jeez
,1234abcd,2012-12-14T07:14Z,"I think we have every right to complain. We are the readers that invest in these characters. That said though I often use these copies as my readers while buying what I like, but after a long talk with Christos Gage today the answer is simple...this story is not my cup of tea...I won't buy it...and not every book has to be my cup of tea. I still see it as cheap like Thunderbolts during the Fight Club craze or Jubilee as a vampire as Twilight was coming out but that is my opinion and I guess I just have to be okay with it being just that. Still bummed by them essentially wasting a character I quite loved, but if Gage can let it slide I'm going to let this one go and just not buy the title. BTW...Cable and The X-Force is quite good. Bought 4 copies to share."
,evolved..,2012-12-14T11:31Z,"I honestly think this is one of the best concepts in Marvel NOW. It's left to be seen if it will be executed well. That said, most of these characters are pretty throwaway. Many lack any real substance. It'll be nice to see some of these characters bite the dust, though as most of you know there's a chance that any character that dies will be brought back."
,evolved..,2012-12-14T12:20Z,"@Street_Disciple: 

You'd only like academy if you like your comics extra campy and poorly written. They're like the D list heroes of the Marvel U. That said, the last 6 or so comics before the series before the whole AvX things werent bad. The AvX stuff was poor, to say the least."
