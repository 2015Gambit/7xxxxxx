I have now blocked your popup and script ridden IMG host. As i also see this is not your first time to get it blocked so i will say this only once:

if any more crappy script ridden img hosts by you, you will be banned.
if you try to get around the blocks with some cheap re-directs, you will be banned.

there are plenty of good free img hosts that are crap free. One is even runned by TPB :

http://bayimg.com/

I hope i make this clear to you"
,sharebird,2012-12-11T05:06Z,"@random:  Bit harsh.  I've looked through every one of spartakusx's post, and yours is the first warning I've seen.  He's since switched to bayimg, so I'm sure it was just a case of not knowing a good host.

Spartakusx has only been on for a couple of weeks, but he's posting quality torrents... they're well-labeled, always have screenshots, and always include file details and resolution info, not just on video, but his picture archives, as well.  

Think he deserves some slack, at the very least... appreciation wouldn't be uncalled for, even :)"
