The third album of songs from the mid-'90s children's TV show Animaniacs one 
of the few kids' shows since The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle to direct 
its humor as much toward adults as kids is proof that the show was a nonstop 
fount of brilliant musical parodies and silly tunes. Opening with a cute 
reworking of Harry Belafonte's calypso standard "The Monkey Song," the CD 
gathers a few odds and ends that somehow hadn't made it to the earlier 
discs, like "Pinky and the Brain" and "The Slappy Squirrel Theme," and adds 
the three-part self-parody "All the Words in the English Language," a takeoff 
of earlier polysyllabic gems like "Yakko's World." Some of the songs, like "The 
Anvil Song" and "At the Big Wrap Party Tonight," don't work as well without 
the visuals, a flaw the earlier Animaniacs collections don't have. Still, this is 
pretty much essential for fans.
