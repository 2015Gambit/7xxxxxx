Does anyone have the 2013 version of this software??"

,MUTHUMOL,2012-12-15T15:43Z," Mcafee As Taken By Intel Resellers Closed this loophole frm activating, I think nobody will be able to activate after 14/12/2012.....and Thus the home users in India like country are going to A HEAVY VIRUS INFECTIONS as they (home users in india) mostly use Free or Pirated AV and Now Norton and Mcafee making it harder to pirate, The home users will be in hell to protect from Virus attacks, God only knows what to do or If Mcafee is seeing this...please help them better.

Who told this torrent or download is Virus or has virus.......No Virus at all I know....But cannot activate check yourself CANNOT ACTIVATE AFTER 12TH DECEMBER 2012.Mcafee Closed the loophole. That is what I said in the previous comment also, as a consequence people in india will have to suffer from future virus infections that's all, I know Raghu and u are a nice gentleman and No Virus But unable to activateMcafee That's all. Thanks for your comments, To Raghu (....tcr...)"
