,Sarmasx,2012-12-30T09:26Z,"I can find a few torrents with the soundtrack here on PB, but i noticed that there is actually one and the rest are copies of this one torrent. Why? My favorite track, Misty Mountains has the same fucking sound glitches at exacltly the same spots in the song. And i can't find it elsewhere. I hate people who download torrents and reupload them as their own! Worthless scums!"
