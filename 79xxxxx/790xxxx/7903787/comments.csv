,anon522,2012-12-09T06:32Z,"Thanks for the upload. Got a question for fellow pirates though, is there any advantage to having RAR files instead of just a single video file? I personally really fucking hate RAR uploads. I encounter way more problems with them than if I were to just download a single video file. But maybe I'm missing something... If anyone feels like enlightening me, thanks ahead of time!

Cheers"

,macwun,2013-01-08T16:37Z,"yeah well, putting vid files in rars is not something most uploaders do anymore, it's frowned upon and people, me included, hate it. there is absolutely no need to compress and already compressed file. none whatsoever"
,aParadox,2013-01-08T19:04Z,"Actually, rar-ing big files began with UseNet and the types. It would make it easy if the storage/host lost it, at least you could tell you had parts 1-6 and need 7-12, so instead of downloading a single iso or avi again, just get the parts.
People who RAR nowadays are either: new to the scene so they copy the 'big boys' to fit in, or people who  have been on the scene and are too lazy not to stop doing something that died out 12 years ago.
It should stop, no one uses dialup anymore.

Even worse are the people who put RARs inside RARs to save 42kb. Just stop it already, pissing off people like me who know how this shit works."
