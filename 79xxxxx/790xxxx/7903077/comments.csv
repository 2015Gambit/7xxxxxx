,vestigialkokoro,2012-12-11T05:55Z,"For those that don't know.. this is a remake of the 1984 movie by the same title staring Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen , and.. uh.. well that's the only two I remember.  "
,mefear,2012-12-11T13:35Z,"This movie is so strange, i mean im happy to watch this kind of movie after so long time.
This is like relaxing action where you don't need to think about plot, it's just happening.
Quality sucked but i found a better copy on reddawn.sofabot.com worked well for me.
Enjoy the movie!"
