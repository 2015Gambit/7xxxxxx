PHP 5.3 introduced a number of new features that every professional PHP programmer should incorporate into their skill set: namespaces, lambdas, closures, and late static binding, all of which are concepts that you might know from other languages and which are now available in PHP. In this workshop, professional developer Edward Tanguay shows you how to use these features and introduces you to a number of new, useful functions such as array_replace, date_add, new functions to work with ini files, and more. In addition to these new features of PHP, you┬┤ll also learn the basics of using cookies and regular expressions.
