Elakelaiset -[2009]- My Best Of, is a compilation of songs I liked the best by the Finnish humppa band Elakelaiset. If you want to get drunk and do a happy dance, this is the right place.

(Mostly known rock cover songs in hummpa style ex. Led Zeppelin, Motorhead, GNR, Bon Jovi etc.)

25 Tracks, 54 Minutes, 140VBR MP3
