Just because TPB says there are seeders doesn't mean the seeders shown have the whole file, so it is impossible for me to know if that torrent is actually moving forward.  If you are having trouble finding a seed PLEASE LEAVE A COMMENT and I will go back and seed it more.  I know very few people read the comments in the first place, and even less go back to read them once they've started downloading.  Just let me know.  Remember less than half of the downloaders share at all, and few of the ones that share do more than trickle their upload.  I do my best, but I don't have an unlimited upload ability."
