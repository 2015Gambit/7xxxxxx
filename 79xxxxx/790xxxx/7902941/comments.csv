,hrector,2012-12-15T02:37Z,"The subtitles file provided is messed up, missing half the dialogue content

Also, this is clearly not a dvdscr, it's a camrip of a dvdscr, there are issues with audio/video sync in some parts of the video

,techranjit,2012-12-22T13:50Z,"I am an Indian,I feel Indian movies are not taking india anywhere.
It is just spoiling the peoples mind with all these fantasy and masala movies where there is no head,neck and tail.
I blame bollywood and the government of india ,which make and give licences to these kind of movies and spoil indian citizens mind.
india will never develop because of these unrealistic movies,which is nothing to with our life or anybodies life.
Indian people are leading a masala life!!young people are not living in a realistic world !"
,xsadx,2012-12-25T08:24Z,"Hindi films belong in the trash, Its like every movie Bollywood creates is just a disaster and a slap in the face to the film industry. I mean cmon japan has better films then India lol."
