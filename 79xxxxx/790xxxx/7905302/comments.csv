Your torrent is perfect and I trust your work it has never let me down, but sometimes I see numerous torrent by one person that  has suspect appearance, i.e 54 seeders and 24 leechers on each one."

Also, do not delete your empty registry keys. Try tuneup utillities it is simpler if you just need a click and forget program, but obviously not as effective."
