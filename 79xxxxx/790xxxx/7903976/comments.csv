,UBARC,2012-12-09T09:50Z,"@Midou01
When I tried it worked with the first one I got. I assumed it always worked. Regardless, it will do for now."
,Midou01,2012-12-09T11:37Z,"@UBARC
you got lucky, for me I tried 5 times, and finally I got it working: not all generated activation keys work!"
,TUDz,2012-12-10T07:53Z,Any form to download and activate the Mathematica 9.0 version for Linux?
,maxjasper,2012-12-11T07:29Z,Thanks a lot bro
,aquarrius,2012-12-11T19:56Z,Correct me if i'm wrong but didnt his kegen contain a trojan?
,aquarrius,2012-12-11T20:07Z,"Hey why did u delete my comment? No matter, let me repost it... 


Mathematica 8 keygen contained a trojan, am i right?"
,Midou01,2012-12-13T07:02Z,"Wrong, it's clean. It's a false positive."
,ais2000,2012-12-14T03:32Z,Does the free-form input work here?

@aquarrius
I checked it with my own software. Unlike most keygens, I didn't even get a false positive. If others do, it is indeed that. It's safe. You can isolate it in a sandbox if you're really concerned. It won't effect anything.

@ais2000
The program has to connect to Wolfram|Alpha, and sometimes your number of calls is limited. I just checked, and it's working."
,gimli23,2012-12-14T10:37Z,Does anybody have Wolfram SystemModeler?
,niarlttep,2012-12-14T17:57Z,"Hi everybody !
Looking for Mathemetica 9 working under Mac OS 10.6.8
If some one have an idee ?
Thanks"
,TUDz,2012-12-15T04:21Z, @UBARC Thanks dude :D Downloading!
,IsItReally,2012-12-16T05:11Z,"UBARC, thank you for this share.

I am confused though; is this the full/standard version of Mathematica 9 (https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) or is it the Home Edition (as linked by you in the description-- https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica-home-edition/)? Please reply ASAP!"
,jma9454,2012-12-16T06:35Z,"@gimli: what is the system modeler? it's one of the new things for 9 right? isn't it already included in the program?
@UBARC: is the call number limited? or can we use it as much as we want without penalty?
  Also, Thank you SO much for the upload! I checked the first week after if came out, cause I like using it for physics, engineering, and higher level calculus over the alternative of Matlab. I didn't see it, but I knew it was just time before someone put it up. so thanks!"
,lamwilton,2013-01-01T11:32Z,Keygen worked after I tried 4 times.
