Mathematica 9, downloaded from the Wolfram site.

This includes AGAiN's keygen for Mathematica 8, which still works for 9. Same drill as before, but just in case;


1. Install the program, then run it. It will ask you to activate.

2. Click "Other ways to activate", or something like that, and pick "Manuel".

3. Enter your Math ID into the Keygen, and click "Save Mathpass".

4. Copy the resulting activation key and password, and accept the agreement.

5. Congrats, you have the program!

If you're having problems, you probably wrote your Math ID in the keygen wrong. MAKE SURE YOU ENTERED IT IN CORRECTLY. This is the main reason people have problems. Check, then re-check. It should work.


If you have the money and you like the product, buy it yourself.
