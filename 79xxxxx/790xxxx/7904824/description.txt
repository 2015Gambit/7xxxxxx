"The Oxford History of the United States is by far the most respected
multi volume history of our nation.
Now, in the newest volume in the series, one of America's most esteemed
historians, Gordon S. Wood, offers a brilliant account of the early American
Republic, ranging from 1789 and the beginning of the national government
to the end of the War of 1812.

Named a New York Times Notable Book, Empire of Liberty offers a marvelous
account of this pivotal era when America took its first unsteady steps as
a new and rapidly expanding nation."
