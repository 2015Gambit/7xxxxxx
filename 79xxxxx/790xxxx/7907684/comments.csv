,nicklas1015,2012-12-10T11:35Z,Can anyone confirm?
,auxois116,2012-12-10T12:29Z,it's legit. I just tried and walked over to the Monkey Business quest and it started up the quest.
,mansonfamily,2012-12-10T13:20Z,"So, works with reloaded ? And saves aren't messed up ?"
,auxois116,2012-12-10T13:22Z,"so I had progressed thru the Monkey Business Quest line. Once it sent me to the 2nd island and I fast traveled to the spot closest to it. The game crashed, so I reloaded the game back up and I have to do the quest line from the beginning again. I don't know if it's because of the crash but I will save before that part again and see what happens when I quit out of the game and come back. I'm curious if the DLC quests reset to the beginning from quitting out of the game."
,auxois116,2012-12-10T13:29Z,"Yes it works with the reloaded version and my save is perfectly fine.

alright so another update:

Since I had already finished the quest line before the crash. I went to start it back up but it behaved like all the objectives were done already from before the crash. Now just advances thru the quest line but it's stuck on the photograph corpse part of the monkey business mission and will not let me advance."
,auxois116,2012-12-10T14:33Z,"so the quests will reset back to the start of it every time you quit out of the game. If the game glitches the quest on you when you try playing it out again, you have to remember where the quest lead you and it should trigger it again."
,mansonfamily,2012-12-10T15:12Z,"  @auxois116

thanks"
,auxois116,2012-12-10T15:40Z,"alright so I finished all of the DLC quests. There is no DLC weapons in this, just the DLC quests. Also after finishing them all in one sitting, when you quit out of the game and start it back up again. All the quests are back on the map again. I don't think they are really worth it because they really don't do anything for you if you way far in the game. It's mostly glorified loot fests and exp. Good for when you're just starting out, you can just whore the quests constantly and get exp for them but anyone far in the game. Not really worth the headache. I'll wait til the DLC weapons are released. Good upload either way."
,trap205,2012-12-10T18:22Z,know any version which has dlc content (with wepons)????
,Maher90,2012-12-10T20:31Z,I can too confirm that this DLC is glitched..i don't know if it's from the game or the DLC itself :l too bad i wished if i could enjoy the DLC
,jackerty,2012-12-11T01:49Z,WORKS!! thanks man :) just finished the story line and its fucking epic! now ive got another bit of time on it :D THANKS
,Stefanovics,2012-12-12T22:54Z,"Works but the dlc's are glitched, you have to complete the at one play, because if you exit the game, fail the mission, or just restart the mission, you have to find the mission giver again and all the completed dlc quest are appear again on the map"
,nukeajs,2012-12-12T23:23Z,"You gotta beat the DLC missions without dying, quitting, or restarting or else you gotta start at the beginning.  Also, the DLC mission starters don't remove themselves after completion which can be a problem because all the quest-related loot items (required to move forward) will already be looted and you'll be stuck in the missions (abandoning the missions fixes this)."
,FUAUDRIN,2012-12-13T23:08Z,"THIS KILLED MY SAVE GAMES! I was 100% done with towers & bases and suddenly bam, savegames gone after using this. 

A) DOWNOADER BEWARE
B) Anyone have any advice on getting my savegames back?"
,tflagger997,2012-12-14T19:43Z,"They were probably overwritten.  Go to the savegame folder and look for any that end in .bak.  If not, then they are gone.

With all the complaints about this everyone should consider it plagueware = Do not download/use."
,tflagger997,2012-12-14T19:44Z,Forgot to include - the complaints are not just on this torrent.  It sounds like the DLC was rushed out and needs official patching.
,JoaoPauloBR,2012-12-17T18:18Z,I luv u
