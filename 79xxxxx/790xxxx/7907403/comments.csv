Don't know if it was just my setup (Win64Ultimate) or just the software, but version 7.1.7 didn't lock or hide the GPT drives I had.  Thought I might have to convert the drive to MBR, but thankfully no need as this version locks/hides GPT drives properly.

Either way -Thank you!  "

,SiliconGhost,2012-12-18T07:12Z,The same serial was included with a 7.1.7 installation I had prior.  So far the program has stayed registered after updating to 7.1.8 and is still working fine for me.
