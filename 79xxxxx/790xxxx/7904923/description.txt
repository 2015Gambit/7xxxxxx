The Football League Show 08.12.2012

It's a fixture which conjures memories of classic encounters from the 1970s; this week our featured match is Derby v Leeds.

After a slow start, Henning Berg is finding his feet at Ewood Park; his side Blackburn entertain high-flying Cardiff, and there is a second city derby as Wolves meet Birmingham at Molineux.
