Movies : Crime : TV Rip : English, 68mins 33secs
This is a redo of my torrent to reduce file size, new format mkv.

Please Note: The movie is essentially complete but the end of the movie ends abruptly and you miss the last few seconds and "the end", you really don't miss anything, the story is over and the actor credits appear in the beginning of the movie. Very hard to find.
