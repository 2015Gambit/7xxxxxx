This is a direct rip of the episode as recorded from 4HD by a Freesat box.

Encoded with Handbrake (High Profile [two pass] @ 3000kb/s), with MKV Merge to remux.

Kept the original 1080i rather than downsampling to 720p as scene rips do.

The interlacing of the original video is present if your player supports it.

About as close as you'll get to broadcast quality without the original TS file...
