,That1Ninja,2012-12-10T16:09Z,Kind of clueless here. How do i stop the license check?
,chop007,2012-12-11T20:11Z,"To disable licence check, you need to be rooted, then just disable background data and syncing for that specific app. I am sure it also works if you are non rooted and you can download an app that lets you specify 'permissions' for a specific app. I always root so as to have complete control over what apps do."
