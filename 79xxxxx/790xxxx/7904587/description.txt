Summary: NYC ad exec Holly Maddux can't help but notice the window display she passes by on her way to work every day, the one with the perfect, hunky mannequin. But when Holly slips one day in front of the store and hits her head, she wakes up to find a perfect, hunky gentleman by her side, helping her up. Holly hits it off with her new beau, and soon things are going along... well, perfectly. But when Holly begins to discover that the pressure to be perfect all the time is not all that it's cracked up to be, she has to make a choice between the perfect life she's always dreamed of... and the real love that's been waiting for her all along.
