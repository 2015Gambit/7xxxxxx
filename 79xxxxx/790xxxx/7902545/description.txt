Working with Models

Want to learn how to find models, how to build your portfolio, and about the business of fashion photography? Fashion photographer Matthew Jordan Smith returns to the creativeLIVE studios for a 3-day workshop teaching photographers how to work with models! Matthew and fashion model Yoanna House from America's Next Top Model will take you through the model-photographer relationship from both sides, showing what sort of direction is helpful and what is confusing, how to cast for a photoshoot, and what you should look for in a model. Matthew will share his insights on how you get the look you need from a model and how to build relationships with models to get the best possible results.
