A COLLECTION OF VINTAGE EAST-L.A. GROOVES FROM THE VAULTS OF RAMPART RECORDS!!

For LA's East Side kids, Eddie Davis was The Man. Eddie founded what would become the Motown for the California chicanos: Rampart Records, and from the beginning of his career as a record producer in 1958 into the early nineties, his groups gave rise to a unique genre eventually dubbed "The West Coast Eastside Sound" or "Pachuco Soul": the music coming out of East L.A. in the early 60s from bands formed by Mexican American musicians. Eddie "was trying to do with Chicanos what Motown was doing with Blacks". Davis' "family of musicians" was an outlet of expression for the young Chicano scene, and helped give legitimacy to the culture of lowrider cars, "cholos and cholas": Mexican American kids had found their own scene and dances. Davis was in the right place at the right time, and his dedication to the music helped a scene of young L.A. musicians establish a new sound. In the words of KPFA Berkeley music director, Chuey Varela, "Eddie caught the vibe and laid the foundation for everything that followed".

In this compilation, a tribute to that magnificent musical adventure, you can find the very best and hottest music that ever came out from Rampart Records.

The best way to celebrate and discover the scorching beat of the "Pachuco Soul"!
