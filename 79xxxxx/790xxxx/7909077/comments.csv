,bobbi.aisec,2012-12-12T10:17Z,Great game. Thz
,N37iM,2012-12-20T23:34Z,"you said this is a great game,,,,hahaha,maybe if you dont have brain,,,this game is piece of shit,,,graphic is like from 1990's,,and game is FPS but more like Adventure,,,god,,,,,and warning ""DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE A WEAK HEART"" is for idiots,,,,"
,N37iM,2012-12-20T23:43Z,"worst game i ever played,,its like The Walking Dead,,,Adventure games are for retards and for those who dont have strong PC's or laptop's to play the newest games in the world,,,,but again,not everybody is KHC gamer-(King of Hard Core Gamers),,,,"
,riddickxx,2012-12-21T11:44Z,N37iM is a humongous faggot.
,shiv7827,2012-12-21T14:39Z,PLAYING GAMES LIKE COD IN VETERAN MODE DOESNT MAKE YOU KHC @N37iM
,xSIKKlown,2012-12-24T04:34Z,@N37iM The Walkind Dead had over 20 nominations and won Game of the Year. This game is nowhere near as good but what you just said made you a complete retard that deserves to go to a mental care hospital.
,Hitman86,2013-01-06T02:57Z,"N37iM likes dicks. 

He said it himself. He's the ""King of Hard Cocks!"""

i think you're not even 15 years! who wastes dads money to buy ur gaming rig & who cries on his birthday to get more stuff... 
PLUS,
""Empty Vessels Make The Most Sound"" so ur showing off ur self as a HARDCORE gamer and also showing u have a strong PC to play latest games! 
but u r really.a cat.... licking ur own pussy bcuz u want a BIG dick.. but u cant even handle a pencil! ""REAL GAMERS DON'T CARE ABOUT GRAPHICS""  u dumb noob!
i think u got scared to finish the game and to prove ur self above the standard ur currently trying to show the internet randoms that how awesome u r in game analyzing & reviews! 
...and adventure is for hard workers not for a lazy little bitch like you! i think you don't have brain to ""think and play""... so i wish you better luck with your self-side dumbass mind which thinks ""i'm a great gamer!""... PEACE OUT!"
