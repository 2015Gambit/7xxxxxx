,mikekolesar,2012-12-09T11:16Z,"I try to get things up quickly but beyond that there should be better options in the upcoming days in regards of quality and size. 

Anywho, no prob man."

,money2burn,2012-12-09T12:11Z,why kill myself over this fake shit
,Rush,2012-12-09T12:19Z,"It's real, just previewed, don't listen to the promoter shills, this is their modus operandi.  Carpet bomb PPV uploads with ""FAKE"" comments 

TPB don't pull this up it's as real as shit

TY, mikekolesar for the first up, cant comment on the quality yet but good luck on your skull"
,money2burn,2012-12-09T12:20Z,"dont hesitate to suck my balls, fake ass"
,bloodyfool0,2012-12-09T12:26Z,Thanks Mike!
,mikekolesar,2012-12-09T12:41Z,"Ah money, it appears you haven't taken my advice =/ lolol 

However, I naturally understand the .wmv concerns. I didn't think much of it as I've started rendering captured streams with sony vegas under their HD wmv profile. 

I guess in that regard anybody who has concerns refer to the comments, anti-virus, or simply my word. Other than that I'd have to say don't download.

Thanks for the info btw Rush, and i'll keep the file type in mind for next upload!"
,money2burn,2012-12-09T12:47Z,"this shit is fake people, but the real one is out there, check the pirate bay, and download the obama one"
,money2burn,2012-12-09T12:50Z,"im sorry, check torrent reactor for the real one"
,hanzo2,2012-12-09T13:35Z,"use format factory to convert ...

[T],Gondy10,2012-12-09T13:45Z,"Just saw the preview (few seconds)..
It's legit.. but sorry i'll wait for another.. this is way beyond my preferences..
Thanks for the up though.."
,KatamariD,2012-12-09T14:04Z,"Please seed guys, im 51% complete. Dont believe this guy trying to bring the seeders down. He has no life.

Yes its from HBO"
,quain44,2012-12-09T14:09Z,"if you all are looking for a smaller version of this, you can find it here, enjoy for slow speed internet!

keep seeding please, dont listen to these guys saying its fake, they are haters

I watched parts of it and it plays in windows media player fine. no converting, not HD but good enough. "
,gtohyper,2012-12-09T14:18Z,yea this file is too big for the quality is like SD only
,FedorG,2012-12-09T14:34Z,"Thanks for the upload but I can't believe how slow this torrent is. I've been downloading for 3,5 hours and it's only at 50%."
,KLINGER123,2012-12-09T15:01Z,Been downloading for hours than 1.5kb - don't even have 1% yet!!
,KLINGER123,2012-12-09T15:02Z,This is bullshit!
,free117ny,2012-12-09T17:27Z,IT DOWNLOADS TO 80% AND STOPS FOR 5-10 MINS FLAT. 2MB download just to get walled. sucky sucky seeding!
,T-10,2012-12-09T18:03Z,"Mike, please don't be offended because I have been through exactly what's happening to you, many years ago.  Ditch your wmv s/w and get something up to date, because you could have seeded this in minutes instead of 12 hours or more.  Get mp4/mkv editing s/w, and also it helps if you will just add more trackers to your client... there are lists if you just google for it.  But I wish you good luck and thank you for the attempt... I'm just now finishing the dl after 12 hours of intermittent incoming. "
,T-10,2012-12-09T18:05Z,"part 2... (heh)
a lot of the problem also is the high number of people here who are downloading but not sharing... not much you can do about that... the world is full of ungrateful takers."
,Frosty_Winnipeg,2012-12-09T18:09Z,"Geeze, WMV I wonder if its a fake. If not a fake. Do not make WMV's cause people will think its a fake. "
,T-10,2012-12-09T18:14Z,"additional note (heh, sorry)
look at bitsnoop's tracker list for what is current and best.
also a big problem is that less than half of your leechers are sharing at ALL, and many of the ones supposedly sharing are only trickling their uploads."
,94401,2012-12-09T18:53Z,Thanks...It's real
,Rush,2012-12-09T19:10Z,"All the haters... read the second comment.  He [uploader] was trying to get this up asap, file type/ file size was a secondary concern. If it doesn't work for you wait till another  TPB uploader work on a copy just for your taste. Ungrateful Beeches

Show some appreciation and quit whining. "
,psycho34,2012-12-09T19:22Z,"Thank you uploader! 
all good watched it with 321 media player. "
,Edwin14,2012-12-09T20:07Z,can anyone seed please
,Dargonplay,2012-12-09T20:15Z,"Is this the real Fight, Fake Or some preview?"
