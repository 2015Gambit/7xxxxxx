Uncle Sinner - Ballads And Mental Breakdowns (2008) mp3


Uncle Sinner is a Canadian artist who plays music that sweats, scratches and stomps. Most of his songs are created using the skeletons of traditional American music, but the words are often re-written and the bones rearranged. Uncle Sinner accompanies his arrangements with banjo, slide guitar and various other guitars. Additional instrumentation and arrangement is provided by Fuller Vengeance, aka Matt McLeod of The White Light Machine.

Unmelodic, bitter, ugly, and sparse are a few words I would use to describe the 2008 debut album Ballads and Mental Breakdowns of death country┬¥artists Uncle Sinner. Hearing this album reminds me of those strangely yellow skies after a heavy rain when the wood of the porch is bone soaked and the water just rolls off the roof and gutters with a cold, wet smell that makes you think the sun is never coming back. It also leaves me speechless and depressed, completely subject to the power of its bleakness. Mostly a collection of old gospel and folk songs, Ballads and Mental Breakdowns redefine these songs as ugly slices of dirty Americana, as real as the dirt in old photographs and the hardships of loss, heartbreak, death, and career gambling. The best endorsement I can give this album is that it is absolutely perfect for drinking alone, unless maybe youre prone to self-mutilation or something like that. In just over 45 minutes, Uncle Sinner can completely eradicate your will to live.
