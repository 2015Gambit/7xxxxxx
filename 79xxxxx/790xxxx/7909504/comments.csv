I wish you'd write the date properly though!!! Takes me ages to work it out..."

For the not yet clued in the torrent names end with the original broadcast date in the format year (YYYY) month (MM) day (DD).

Descriptions (borrowed) usually also show broadcast date but in the English folk preferred format of day month and year.  Considering EE's origins it seems appropriate to leave that unmolested."
