Information
------------------------------

Griff Rhys Jones visits major metropolises, exploring their diverse cultures and meeting the ordinary people who give them their distinctive character and identity


1)  Rome 
The writer and actor returns to experience a day in the life of three more major cities, beginning with a visit to Rome to discover its traditions, history and secrets. He eats offal and milks goats in the style of a Roman peasant and visits a basilica that is home to nuns who spend their lives in complete silence. Griff learns how to direct traffic at one of the busiest road intersections in Europe and lands an audience with the mayor - who explains how to run the city without being assassinated

2)  Sydney 
The writer and actor heads Down Under to experience a day in the life of Sydney, learning how what started as a penal colony is now regarded as one of the most desirable places in the world to live. He joins members of the Surf Watch team in their helicopter as they scan the sea for potential dangers, is taken to a sacred site by an Aboriginal cultural leader and visits the Opera House

3)  Hong Kong 
The writer and actor heads to the Far East to experience a day in the life of Hong Kong, a complex city that is a mix of the ancient and modern, East and West, and where consumerism and spiritualism live side by side. Griff helps run a stall at a bird market, goes on a bus ride with a group of Chinese tourists, has a water fight with a troop of boy scouts and joins schoolchildren being taught a unique method of mental arithmetic
