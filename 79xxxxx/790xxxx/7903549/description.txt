LucisArt 3 for Photoshop

LucisArt 3 ED has an Enhance Detail slider that allow you to enhance image detail in increments of 2 intensity levels- that is up to 125 settings for an 8-bit image. You can repair image exposure and increase image detail- from small sharpening enhancements to DHR effects to revealing extreme detail.
Digital-type Artists - Be surprised. You have never seen effects like this because no conventional filters work like LucisArt. What's hidden in your image will amaze you.

LucisArt 3 Benefits:

Creativity: 
With LucisArt you will quickly and easily explore the creative potential of your image. Once you see a version of your image that you like you may be able to determine how to approximately duplicate that LucisArt artistic effect using other methods. But that is time consuming. And you would not know that the LucisArt version of your image was even possible except for LucisArt revealing it to you. Use LucisArt multiple times or in conjunction with other image processing methods to even further expand the variety of artistic effects.

Time savings: 
Professional photographers need to quickly repair images and create salable artistic effects. LucisArt lets you quickly explore your image and see what it could become. You will create artistic effects in a few minutes that would take much longer to even approximately achieve with other image processing methods (if those artistic effects could be achieved at all). This could save hours of image-processing time for professionals processing a few dozen images. Effectively no learning curve: The LucisArt controls are intuitive and easy to use. There is no manual. Create your first LucisArt image in as little as 5 minutes.

Value: 
Professional photographers are looking to differentiate themselves from their primary competition - their customers. In addition to the time savings, professional photographers could charge for adding LucisArt special effects and secure artistic image sales from customers no longer interested in purchasing realistic photography.
