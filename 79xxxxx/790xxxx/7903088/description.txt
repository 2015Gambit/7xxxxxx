GENIUS is an Italian progressive metal project created by Daniele Liverani and drummer Dario Ciccioni. Their 3 albums are to be looked at as a trilogy, and the intent of the project was to create a progressive metal rock opera. The opera was completed with their 2007 album "Episode 3: The Final Surprise".

This opera is of incredible quality. Think of classic prog operas like "The Lamb Lies Down On Broaway" or "Tommy". This trilogy surely ranks up there, and I consider in one of Daniele's best projects. The 3 Episodes in the trilogy are 2002's "Episode 1: A Human Into Dreams World", "2004's Episode 2: In Search of the Little Prince", and 2007's "Episode 3: The Final Surprise".

The project is somewhat like THE ALAN PARSONS PROJECT being that it has various guest performances. It includes performances by people like JOHN WETTON, DANIEL GILDENLOW, STEVE WALSH, and various others. This project will surely impress people looking for an excellent progressive metal opera.
