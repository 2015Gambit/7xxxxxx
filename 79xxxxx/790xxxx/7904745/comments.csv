,cake3434,2012-12-09T17:44Z,Does this go in MyDocuments/Sims3/Mods/Packages ?
,cake3434,2012-12-09T17:54Z,Oh I see it goes into packages folder. I have other sims 3 store updates in this folder. Should i delete them to add this fix or leave them there? (They fix my blackjack table so i am trying not to delete them)

This one is to replace the one you have.

It will fix not only what is mentioned but it will also fix everything else that requires fixes.

Because of that the old fix file you have is no longer required."
,mommapixie449,2012-12-11T04:29Z,i downloaded both the monte vista torrent and the cake oven fix and the oven is still not working. :(
,BabS_,2012-12-17T19:50Z,ok I downloaded monte vista torrent and this one but I don't have nothing to replace :S I put it into Sims3 folder but it doesn't ask me to replace anything.....
