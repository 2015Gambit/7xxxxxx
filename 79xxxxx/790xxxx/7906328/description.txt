            Another year, another console, another Hackmii Installer!          
                                                                               
                                                                                      
     Update:                                                                  
     Unfortunately some bugs snuck into the v1.1 release, which are now fixed 
     in v1.2.                                                                 
                                                                              
        PAL 50Hz (576i) video mode now works properly                         
        BootMii/boot2 can be installed again on newer Wiis                    
        Icons load again in The Homebrew Channel            
                                                            
     Sorry for the inconvenience.
