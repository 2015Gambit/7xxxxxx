Quaternity

Symbolic performance art by Thomas Joseph Brown

The fundamental nature of quadrature relationships pervades all levels of existence: physical and spiritual directions, elements, ethers, mandalas, medicine wheels, labyrinths. The four quadrants emerge from the quintessence, and in reflection the quintessence emerges from the four quadrants when actively awakened.

The quintessence is the spirit in matter which animates us and inspires our curiosity about our place in reality. The four elements and four ethers combine to make seven stages, reflected in our chakras and our connections to the alchemical seven planets and noble metals.

Are we two legged cows to be grazed on genetically disrupted foods and enslaved by debt-based currencies? Or can we experience an awakened emergence from the eternal void, traversing ancient symbol streams as they manifest in reality around us?

Here we discover our path through Quaternity
