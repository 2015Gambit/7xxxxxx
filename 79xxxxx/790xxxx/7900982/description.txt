Lately, IΓÇÖve been getting this question a lot: ΓÇ£how did you get your terminal to look the way it does?ΓÇ¥ If youΓÇÖve noticed my terminal and are curious about how I set it up, this is the tutorial for you! Of course, what you learn here will be enough to get you started on creating your own custom command prompt, as well!

Before we get started, I want to make something extremely clear. IΓÇÖm certainly a command line enthusiast, but IΓÇÖm not at all a command line pro. I feel at home in a terminal, but IΓÇÖm a far cry from knowing everything. So hereΓÇÖs the deal: IΓÇÖm going to show you how IΓÇÖve set up my terminal, but that doesnΓÇÖt mean IΓÇÖll be able to explain every single line of code weΓÇÖll look at. There are some things here that are the way they are just because thatΓÇÖs what works ΓÇª and I donΓÇÖt always 100% know why.
