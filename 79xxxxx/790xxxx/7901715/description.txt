18)  Frances Normandy 
From a dramatic, historic coast to rural pastures, this sweet section of France abounds with apple orchards, enchanting villages, stunning abbeys and sparkling seaports. We base in the lovely seaside town Honfleur. At Giverny, and in the museums in Rouen and Honfleur, we discover the birth of Impressionism. Near the famous beaches of Normandy, the Norman Conquest unfolds in the Bayeux tapestry and we remember the poignant victory of World War II's D-day. Cider and cheese draw us to the lovely farmland just inland from Honfleur. Our journey ends at the awe inspiring Abbey of Mont-St-Michel.
