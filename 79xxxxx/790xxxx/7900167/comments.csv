,FrenchFan,2012-12-08T09:43Z,Oh God you won't post any more episodes? It's so sad ! How will we follow our soaps :( Your work was incredible jmanwf !
,cbix29,2012-12-08T17:14Z,"That sucks. You were the best source for GH I've ever found. If possible, could you tell us what program you used to rip the eps with such vq in such a small file size? Thanks for all your work."
,Dakota85,2012-12-09T12:06Z,"Hi Jmanwf - I wish it wasn't so unexpected but for the record, thank you for doing such an amazing job when there is no other real recognition for it apart from the whole group of us that watch this show across the world thanks to you. You brought random people together via torrenting and we are all grateful. If there is a way you can help us to help each other/ourselves since I believe even Doolfan isn't uploading them either anymore, we'd all appreciate it. Thanks and hope you come back soon! =D Dak"
,disneydreams,2012-12-13T12:21Z,thanks so much jmanvf for all you did.
,keithandrews,2012-12-15T01:21Z,http://tvunderground.org.ru/ you can find all General Hospital episode at above web address. Latest one included.
,disneydreams,2012-12-18T12:17Z,thank you keithandrews for the site. 
,carnaval93,2012-12-22T11:16Z,This other website is bull.....there are no new episodes either.
,Dakota85,2012-12-28T08:16Z,"Hey Guys, I don't think you'll get this since you've probably given up but you can keep watching GH by ripping the videos off youtube. someone like JSMS99 is fantastic, just right click on the video and click on ""copy link address"" and go to a website called Keepvid. Paste the link into the box and click go and it will download the video. Then choose the format you want it in (I find mp4 works quicker and easier but everyone's different) and just wait a few minutes and it is done! :) I hope that helps, it's definitely been a miracle worker and saving me 37mins of sitting in front of a computer haha. JSMS also includes the preview clip at the end of the ep. Hope that helps everyone! Merry Xmas!"
