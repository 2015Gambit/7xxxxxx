This is a collection of History resources for teachers and students. 

The materials here are found elsewhere on the internet and many thanks 

go to the countless numbers of original uploaders. The documentaries 

and materials have merely be resorted into chronological order to make 

them more accessable. 

The folders are named by date of the event or period, followed by a 

title which more or less suggests the content. Some folders may cover 

a period across several centuries, while others may cover a single 

event. Historic figures before the twentieth century are generally 

listed under their date of birth, then death, while political figures 

of the last century or so, are listed by the dates during which they 

were in power. Some individuals appear by their date of death where 

this is more appropriate. The entire collection covers from 1400 BC to 

the present. Every major event in world history is represented in its 

individual folder. Some folders may only have a single documentary, 

while others may have a great number of video files and books.

It is suggested that you might use a torrent client like utorrent 

which allows the user to select the files they wish to download, as 

some folders may have far to much material to be practicable as a 

single download.
