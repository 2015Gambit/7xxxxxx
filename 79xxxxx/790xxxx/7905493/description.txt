All Music Guide - Stephen Thomas Erlewine
To commemorate the close of the New York Mets' historic Shea Stadium, the 
powers that be brought in the one local superstar who could pay tribute to 
this quintessential New York landmark: the one and only Billy Joel. He 
assembled a killer lineup of guest stars topped by Sir Paul McCartney, whose 
Beatles performed a legendary show at Shea in 1965, an event echoed by a 
rollicking encore where Macca duets on "I Saw Her Standing There," then 
draws the show to a close with "Let It Be." Prior to that, Billy goes through a 
set list that is remarkably similar to 2006's 12 Gardens Live, a show that 
contains the same opening pair of "Prelude/Angry Young Man" and "My Life," 
then follows roughly the same pattern through the conclusion of "Piano Man." 
Apart from Tony Bennett sitting in on "New York State of Mind," Garth Brooks 
sharing "Shameless," John Mayer playing on "This Is the Time," "The River of 
Dreams" turned into a medley with "A Hard Day's Night," and the introduction 
of a snippet of "Yankee Doodle Dandy" into "My Life," there are no surprises 
in execution or song selection. It's a thoroughly professional and entertaining 
set, perhaps somewhat diminished by its lack of freshness -- it would seem 
that a historic event like this would contain some spark -- but enjoyable all the 
same.
