Mangajin's Basic Japanese Through Comics
by Ashizawa Kazuko

Description:
 What is "Basic Japanese"? 

This book presents some very basic words and phrases along with some that are not usually considered "basic" at all. In fact, some of the material in this book is not typically presented until the student is well into his or her study of the Japanese languageΓÇöand even then, it can be confusing without a skilled explanation. The Mangajin method, however, makes even this advanced material "basic" and accessible to students at all levels. Frames from Japanese manga ("comics") are used to illustrate every point, and English translations and notes allow even the basic beginner to understand material that might otherwise stump advanced students. 

Basic Japanese through Comics is not intended as a textbook, but rather as an entertaining supplement to a more formal study of Japanese. The 24 "lessons" in this book do not build on each otherΓÇöthey can be read or studied in any order.
