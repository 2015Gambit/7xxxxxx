 This concert film captures a February 28, 2003 performance by KISS in Australia. What makes the night special is that the band was backed up by a full symphony orchestra. The group performs three sets of songs that night, one high-energy traditional rock and roll show, a more sedate acoustic set, and finally a series of songs with backing from the classically trained musicians. The twenty-two song setlist includes such all time favorites as "Beth," "Deuce," "Strutter," "Detroit Rock City," and "Rock and Roll All Nite."
