Various Artists - Holy Spirit: Spiritual Soul & Gospel Funk from Shreveport's Jewel Records [2012]

ΓêÆ Original Release / Harmless / HURTXCD 119 / CD

2012 two CD compilation of American independent funky Soul and Gospel music which is currently one of most exciting areas of record collecting. One of the greatest labels for funky Gospel releases was undoubtedly Jewel Records from Shreveport, Louisiana in 1963. From such humble beginnings sprang a recording empire which also included the Paula, Ronn and Soul Power labels. We invited serious DJ's, record collectors and all round funky Gospel addicts, the UK based David Hill and US based Greg Belson, to compile the best funky Gospel and Spiritual Soul from the Jewel archives. Also, we're delighted to include one of the rare records which made it into John Peel's legendary 7'' record box: the sensational ''No More Ghettos In America'' by Stanley Winston, proof positive that Jewel's funky Gospel sound found supporters right across the spectrum.

One of the funkiest gospel collections you'll ever hope to own ΓÇô and an amazing document of the criss-crossing styles going down at the legendary Jewel Records! Jewel didn't just record gospel, but handled a fair bit of soul, funk, blues, and jazz ΓÇô all of which seems to bubble forth in these amazing recordings ΓÇô tracks that easily represent some of the hippest, coolest gospel sides of the late 60s and early 70s ΓÇô the kind of work we've dug for years in its ability to easily cross over to the secular scene, thanks to wicked grooves underneath the vocals! And the vocals are pretty darn great too ΓÇô work by singers who could have been huge in the mainstream world, had they broken from the spiritual realm ΓÇô really belting out with the best of the southern soul scene of the time. The package features a whopping 41 tracks in all ΓÇô with tracks that "Don't Forget The Bridge" by Mighty Songs Of Glory, "There's A Creator" by Roscoe Robinson, "Trouble's Brewin" by The Meditation Singers, "Brotherly Love" by BP's Revolution, "I'm Trying To Be Your Friend" by Soul Stirrers, "Far Away From God" by Armstrong Brothers, "Golden Gate" by Traveling Echoes, "He's A Friend" by Dorothy Norwood, "Watch That Rogue" by Silver Gate Quartet, "You've Got To Serve Somebody" by Bill Moss, and "The Upper Way" by The Violinaires.
