Acclaimed Israeli director Eytan Fox brings to life a modern fable with a catchy musical message and a story based on the songs of Israeli pop legend Svika Pick. Miriam (Maya Dagan) is an adoring fan of Svika Pick (who appears as himself). She dreams of being a famous singer, leading her to mysteriously abandon her son Meir (Ido Rosenberg) on his tenth birthday. Both Meir and his best school friend Shuli-who happens to be a beautiful girl-have their eye on the same gorgeous guy. But despite worthy distractions, Meir never stops searching for his mother, eventually moving to Tel Aviv and becoming famous as a drag queen named Mary Lou. The songs never stop coming as Meir/Mary Lou discovers he needs to find himself even more than his mother.
