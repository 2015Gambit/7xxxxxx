The world is full of problems and conflicts. So why can we not solve them? According to Edward de Bono, current thinking cannot solve world problems because current thinking is itself the problem. And this is getting worse: we are so accustomed to readily available information online that we search immediately for the answers rather than thinking about them. Our minds function like trying to drive a car using only one wheel. There's nothing wrong with that one wheelΓÇöconventional thinkingΓÇöbut we could all get a lot further if we used all four. De Bono examines why we think the way we do from a historical perspective and uses some of his famous thinking techniques combined with new ideas to show us how to change the way we think. If we strengthen our ability and raise our thinking level, other areas of our lifeΓÇöboth personal and business successΓÇöwill improve. De Bono is the master of the original big "concept" book and his enticement to us to use our minds as constructively as possible should appeal to a whole new generation of fans.
