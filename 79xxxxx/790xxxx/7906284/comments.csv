,carnaval93,2012-12-12T22:51Z,Hi...around 59:50 the picture gets out of sync with the subtitles.
[T],Chamchan,2012-12-13T00:10Z,I watched the file with VLC Media Player and the subtitles were ok.  What program do you use? maybe just a glitch that you can restart?  Let me know and i can help you more.

,carnaval93,2012-12-13T12:35Z,I'll use windows media classic.
[T],Chamchan,2012-12-13T20:41Z,"Try VLC. its the best. and free. I always have problems viewing anything with WMP.  If that still doesnt work and you want it fixed, you can always download Aegis Sub editor.  You can fix the delay time.  Thats what I was going to do but i cant since I cant see the Lag."
