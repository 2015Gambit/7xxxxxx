,tensigh2,2012-12-10T12:52Z,Does anybody have a non .rar version? .Rar archives suck and they do NOT save space.

To the haters: is it really that hard to open a .rar file? It only takes a few seconds you lazy fucks.

Also - I love neoputu too, but I just downloaded the same game he just put up, and sceneline's has way better audio and video.  Download both, see for yourself, it's not even close.  So not only did sceneline put up a BETTER video but he did it sooner than neoputu did.  But because it's .rar people bitch... so sad.

Thank this man!!
