,watermelonseeds,2012-12-10T05:37Z,"^ Yeah I downloaded a fake last week, it pissed me off so much lol.  Needed a password for it.  This one is uploaded by sceneline so who knows, might be legit.  I'll report back."
,Fitzy727,2012-12-10T05:39Z,This is not a fake.  Sceneline is just old school and still uploads things that are zipped.  Not to mention that hes a skull...  Thanks for the up!  My season 7 marathon starts tomorrow :)
