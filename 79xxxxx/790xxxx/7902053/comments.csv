You open the Avast cent,
settings,

Create a Notepad == >> ((fake) Fake!)) version.dll file, which is
c:  Program Files  AVAST Software  Avast  folder to,
or wherever you have installed the avast.
(Content can be anything, or nothing, of no significance, because in the future they can be overwritten)
Having done that run the Avast Activator.exe in 2050, right-click Administrator.
If you restart the computer to activate already been implemented,

2.Create an empty notepad save it as version.dll file, in c:Program Files/AVAST Software/Avast
or wherever you have installed the avast.
3. Run Avast Activator.exe in 2050 as administrator and activate.
4. Restart and then connect to the internet and activate the license.
