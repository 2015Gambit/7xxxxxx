,ca1981,2012-12-11T22:28Z,This DLC is DRM free and will work with the 1st edition of Saints Row the Third (You do not need The Full Package DVD1)
,anonxnero,2012-12-13T00:30Z,"did you even look at its contents? i only ripped the dlc onto my harddrive then uploaded it as is 
its not like most games which have the dlc seperate and labled it comes in 4 packages labled ""package: the first"" and so on trust me ive been doing this for a long time"

,anonxnero,2013-01-02T20:28Z,format a usb pendrive with your xbox transfer the files in the content folder to the pendrive using horizon then just put your usb back in your xbox and transfer the dlc over to your harddrive then play
