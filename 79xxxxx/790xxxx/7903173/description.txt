RAGE is a groundbreaking first-person shooter set in the not-too-distant

civilization, "Arks" are constructed and buried deep underground. These
cryogenic lifeboats carry humanity's future, preserved with the tools they
need to rebuild. But when survivors begin to emerge, they find the
unexpected. Many humans who were above ground during the impact
unexpectedly survived, while horrific mutants roam the dead cities.
And a mysterious tyrannical government, bent on creating a new world order,
has begun the search... for you.
