,mikehouston09,2012-12-12T00:38Z,can somebody help to make this game work
,1236987,2012-12-12T01:38Z,"Heres what I did to get it to work. And thanks noobish for the game! aces!

1.) Drag the crack.zip to Users/shared
2.) Launch Terminal (if you cant find it use spotlight)
3.) copy past this : defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
4.) Press enter
5.) Relaunch Finder (hold down the cmd+alt+esc then click on finder then click Relaunch)
**another way to do is is to click the apple logo on the top left and select Force Quit Application, were not really force quitting anything but that gives us the option to select Finder and Relaunch it.
6.) After relaunching finder, go to Users/shared and some hidden documents will appear. delete the "".SharedUserDB
7.) Open the crack.zip and you should see a new "".SharedUserDB"".
8.) Go back to Terminal and copy paste this: defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles NO
9.) Press enter
10.) Relaunch Finder once more.
11.) Enjoy and have fun. Hope that helps!"
