If you are thanking me for uploading then you are welcome. 

If you are asking for a faster seeding i would remind you this isn't supported by the likes of eztv and their collection of seedboxes.  It starts with just me seeding to what almost instantly is about 40 people and quickly grows from there. After a few hours there is a nice group of seeders but the leechers also increase. As of writing this there is 1 seeder for about every 5 leechers. It isn't going to be super fast but it is available.

Enjoy the show. Series 3 finale is next Sunday - yes, it is only 6 episodes."
,HowyaBoss,2012-12-11T10:49Z,Appreciate you uploading this man but Im stuck on 99%!! Really want to watch this but its frustrating as hell being so close yet so far!!
,kennyuk,2012-12-11T14:25Z,Seed plx. Stuck at 99.8% for a very good while
,Beery,2012-12-11T16:31Z,Mine was stuck on 99.87% too but when played through vlc it's all there. probably just missing a bit of the credits. Thanks for your time and efforts iamgreat.
,Hancock79,2012-12-12T03:44Z,thanks for upload.  ignore the whiners it doesn't get better than this for most people lol
,Hancock79,2012-12-12T05:01Z,by the way those stuck at 99% all you have to do is copy the file after it gets stuck(don't stop it or anything just in case).  i watched it and less than 1 second was cut out and it didn't interrupt the conversation it happened on at all.
[T],iamgreat,2012-12-12T22:45Z,I am showing over 100 people @ 100% so i am really not sure why so many of you are stuck at 99.8%.  Has anyone had that resolve for them since since i joined back in seeding this in the past 12 hours or so?
,cindy25,2012-12-15T04:05Z,any chance you could post the CTV Movie Horses of McBride (air date 12.16) and/or the unaired (in USA) episode of Haven (312) ?
,simon200,2012-12-15T12:32Z,"Cheers iamgreat
that 99.8% issue sorted itself out "
[T],iamgreat,2012-12-16T21:13Z,"simon200,
good to know.

Cindy, havem't we had this conversation about requests vs commenting on the torrent? :P

Haven s3e12 will be on 21 Dec @ 9pm ET (its originally scheduled time in CA) and s3e13 will be on immediately following @ 10pm ET on Showcase. Subject to revision anytime between now and then. Unlike Syfy there hasn't been any change to Showcase's schedule in the last 40 hours. Haven has been on an annoying-as-**** 7-day delay in Canada, except for the season finale. That means it isn't available at this time from Canadian tv. I have to wait just like you do.

The Horses Of McBride is on tonight @ 7pm on CTV and 19 Dec @ 9pm ET on Bravo! with repeats at 2am ET and 4am ET on 20 Dec. I might get it one of those times or from iTunes."
,HowyaBoss,2012-12-17T10:26Z,"It was stuck at 99.8% for me for a long time but it still played fine in VLC media player.....cheers again for putting it up, cant wait to watch the finale!!"
,giggles99,2012-12-18T09:30Z,Great job mate... whens the finale comming ive been looking everywhere for it!! thanks
,cindy25,2012-12-18T09:41Z,"I just checked the Showcase schedule, and it now shows 313 for 9 pm with 213 Silent Night at 10 pm

,cindy25,2012-12-18T10:42Z,just found out that Haven 312 will be on SciFyUK 12-18
,rayzor1978,2012-12-18T16:34Z,Hey man :) any chance of uploading episode 6..The final one.. it was on rte last sunday ! cheers
