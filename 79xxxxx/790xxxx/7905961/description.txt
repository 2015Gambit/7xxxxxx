Notes: Not the best quality here, source wasn't the best. The colours on the video
were nearly non-existent, I don't know if the movie is supposed to be like that, I
doubt it. So we tried our best to put some colour and a bit of life into this one
without wrecking it. It's safe to say that this was a right b!tch. This should be
able to tide you over until the DVD I suppose?
