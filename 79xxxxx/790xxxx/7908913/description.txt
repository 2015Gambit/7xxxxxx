'IΓÇÖd bet that if French cooks could get their hands on Michele Scicolones French Slow Cooker, which is filled with smart, practical, and convenient recipes, theyΓÇÖd never let it go.' ΓÇö Dorie Greenspan, author of Around My French Table
With a slow cooker, even novices can turn out dishes that taste as though they came straight out of the kitchen of a French grandmere. Provencal vegetable soup. Red-wine braised beef with mushrooms. Chicken with forty cloves of garlic. Even bouillabaisse. With The French Slow Cooker, all of these are as simple as setting the timer and walking away. Michele Scicolone goes far beyond the usual slow-cooker standbys of soups and stews, with Slow-Cooked Salmon with Lemon and Green Olives, Crispy Duck Confit, and Spinach Souffle. And for dessert, how about Ginger Creme Brulee? With The French Slow Cooker, the results are always magnifique.
