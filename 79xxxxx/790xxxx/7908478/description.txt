This double album was never released in the USA. It came out in the UK 
in 1968, the same year as their "Mixed Bag" album. The main tracks on 
"Hip Hip Hooray" are from Mixed Bag, which I uploaded separately the other day.

These remaining tracks are some of The Troggs' best work in my opinion,
and should have been hits because many of them are better than "Wild Thing"
and "With a Girl Like You" that they're best known for.
