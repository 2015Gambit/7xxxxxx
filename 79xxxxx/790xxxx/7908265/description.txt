Santiago, a young Argentinean, has left New York to find the land willed to him in Uruguay by his parents, who have died in a car crash. On the way he picks up a young Belgian hitchhiker Juliette, who is looking for a man she met in Costa Rica, now believed to be living in a hippie commune. Thus begins a charming and playful relationship, as the two travel across the stunning Uruguayan countryside.
Much of the joy in this movie comes from their interactions with the local characters. Shot in an almost documentary fashion, these scenes are genuinely enchanting and engaging.
