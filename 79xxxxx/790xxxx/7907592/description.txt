Paul Paray made his U.S. debut in New York in 1939, and it would be in 
America that he achieved his greatest renown. In 1952 he was named music 
director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, where he remained until 1963. 
Though not one of the world's sleekest ensembles, the Detroit Symphony 
under Paray's hands became noted for its snap and fire, especially through 
the recordings it made for Mercury. These LPs focused largely on French 
music, although Paray acquitted himself admirably with other works, including 
a Schumann cycle. The recorded performances tended to be bracingly fast 
(especially the Saint-Sa╬┤ns "Organ" Symphony and Franck D minor 
Symphony), yet Paray's phrasing was supple and witty, and the orchestra 
played with great precision, high energy, and light heart. For decades these 
1950s recordings, particularly of Ravel and various light overtures, inspired 
great affection among collectors.
