,monoxide_child420,2012-12-11T05:20Z,no prob glad you like it. please seed if you can
,ahdhdj,2012-12-11T07:56Z,no one is seeding im at 13.4% =/
,monoxide_child420,2012-12-11T17:18Z,i have been seeding all night and day.
,ahdhdj,2012-12-11T18:49Z,not sure why its stuck at 13.4% then...
,monoxide_child420,2012-12-11T19:04Z,is it going up yet? i have been seeding the whole time.
,monoxide_child420,2012-12-11T19:07Z,ok i saw what the prob was. i had my downloader set at 100% for seeding so it stopped at 100% meaning some one got it and stopped seeding after they downloaded it. i need to get my desktop pc hooked up so i can use that as a seedbox
,ahdhdj,2012-12-11T19:12Z,as i say that someone finally is seeding to me...
,monoxide_child420,2012-12-11T20:25Z,yea it is me finally seeding again. i changed settings.
