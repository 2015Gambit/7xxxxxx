,DatSeraph,2012-12-24T21:09Z,I recently found out about your uploads and I have to say they are of the best quality I have seen elsewhere. I know you use MetaX for editing metadata but the thing Iâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;m wondering is what are you using to convert/encode? As always your work is appreciated.
