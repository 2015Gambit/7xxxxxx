In this game you will be creating "organisms" by moving the single cells that makes it.
As you advance in the game you will find mutating "cells" with surprising effects. Always remember that you have a limited number of "splits" or moves. 
Hold left mouse button and drag to move cells around, right button to mutate, wheel to go steps back or forward and space to reset the cell.

Always remember to support companies and helping them create these awesome applications by purchasing the game!
