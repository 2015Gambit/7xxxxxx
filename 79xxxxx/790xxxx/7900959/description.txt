JIM JEFFERIES

ATTENTION: LetΓÇÖs be quite clear about something, if the word Cunt offends you, even when it rolls of the tongue with an amusing accent, then Jefferies might not be for you. If thatΓÇÖs the case itΓÇÖs all right, you are just extremely uptight and a liberal dose of Jefferies brand of humor is exactly what you need to sort yourself out.


PLOT: There's something magical about an Australian accent that seems to make even the most caustic wit come off with good-natured charm. And that delicate blend of deviant behavior and good intentions has skyrocketed Aussie comic Jim Jefferies to international acclaim with critics and fans alike. In this new hour-long special, the man hailed by Q Magazine as "Britain's most offensive stand-up comedian" shares fresh tales from his life on the edge, including a menage a trois in Montreal and attending a party where God is on the guest list.
