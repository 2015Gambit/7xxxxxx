Comic actors John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd received a lot of flak for their 
Blues Brothers shtick -- mostly for the albums, not 1980's beloved classic film. 
But they should be given credit for exposing many people -- including this 
reviewer -- to the music of blues and R&B veterans. The Blues Brothers 
soundtrack was released on Atlantic Records. On the surface this doesn't 
seem unusual, since the Blues Brothers' Atlantic debut, Briefcase Full of 
Blues, was a number one album; but the movie was released by Universal, 
and its parent company, MCA, passed on the soundtrack. The rollicking 
remake of the Spencer Davis Group's "Gimme Some Lovin'" was a hit, 
featuring an arrangement notable for the horn section that replaces Steve 
Winwood's rumbling organ work. Ray Charles has a good time with "Shake a 
Tail Feather," and he's helped out by Jake and Elwood Blues (Belushi and 
Aykroyd, respectively). The cover of Solomon Burke's "Everybody Needs 
Somebody to Love" is a lot of fun, thanks to the great overall rhythm and 
Elwood's lightning-fast stage rap, while James Brown and the Reverend 
James Cleveland Choir provide a blast of gospel music on "Old Landmark." 
Aretha Franklin's "Think" is explosive, and Cab Calloway's "Minnie the 
Moocher" is slyly irresistible. Charles, Brown, Franklin, and Calloway all have 
small roles in the film, yet so does John Lee Hooker, but he's not represented 
here.
