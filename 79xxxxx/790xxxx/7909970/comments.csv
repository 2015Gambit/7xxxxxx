A: 8
V: 8
M: 8
The first 15 minutes feel rushed, but the last hour is extremely well edited and paced."

V=9
A=9
Now, the move! This film should have an X rating for maniacal and gruesome material. It takes a sick, twisted, and deranged mind to concoct something like this. 
The movie was a heinous labyrinth of unbridled bloodletting that descended to levels of perverse torture & macabre heretofore unseen & quite conceivably un imagined, rivaled only by the most legendary of suffering imagined to take place in the deepest crawlspaces of abyss where light is afraid to travel, and where darkness is made to cringe! 
With that stated, I absolutely loves it. I I give it a 10.
Couldn't imagine the sequel to be this good! "
