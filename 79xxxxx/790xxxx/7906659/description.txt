"Take Down That Million I + II"

The final two legs of the race with the winners
being announced.


FYI- Splitting this would leave the parts quite 
uneven in runtime. Also, there are no credits at 
the end of the first half nor are there texted 
credits/intro at the start fo the second half. 
Which means 1 solid release as always.

Rules are unclear if a show such as this would
be 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to
this being a literal race involving lots of
running and high motion we went with 
'competitive'.

22/Slower+
Evolve... or die.
Enjoy :)
