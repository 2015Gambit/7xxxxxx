[T],mf-den,2012-12-09T07:49Z,@genocide44: These are all magnet links and not ur normal torrent files (which tpb stopped using for security reasons). So u gotta wait for some time for the file info to be loaded in ur torrent client as initially the file info will be empty. Pls read up on how to use magnet links to solve ur problem
