Bobbi Humphrey - Dig This! [1972]

Excellent album jazz funk !!! US original LP with killer jazz funk flute sessions, including "Smiling Faces Sometimes" sampled by Common for "Puppy Chow" track. This is the Second & rarest lp by Bobbi.

Dig This! finds flutist Bobbi Humphrey in her pre-Mizell production days at Blue Note. Instead, George Butler did production with Wade Marcus, Horace Ott and Alphonze Mouzon sharing the arranging duties. ThereΓÇÖs a nice sharp edge to covers of Lonely Town, Lonely Street even with its string backing, Smiling Faces Sometimes and Nubian Lady. Stevie WonderΓÇÖs I Love Every Little Thing About You and El Mundo De Maravillas (A World Of Beauty) are also worth a listen.
