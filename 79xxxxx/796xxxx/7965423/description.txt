Halos and Horns is the 37th studio album by Dolly Parton, released in May 2002.
Her third album for the independent, roots music label Sugar Hill, the album continued Parton's experimentation with the folk and bluegrass sounds begun on The Grass Is Blue 1999 and Little Sparrow 2001. Of the album's songs, perhaps the most noteworthy selection was Parton's folksy cover of Led Zeppelin's classic ΓÇÿStairway to HeavenΓÇÖ (with which Zep singer Robert Plant was said to be pleased). The album was nominated for three Grammy Awards. Parton embarked on her first tour in 10 years in support of the album. The sold-out Halos and Horns Tour played the United States and the United Kingdom. The cover photo was taken by famed photographer Annie Leibovitz. (wikipedia)
