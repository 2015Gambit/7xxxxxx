,culatr,2012-12-29T04:54Z,"Hmmmm 2.9 out of 10 from 90 users.  That answer your question brettsurfer?  Ahh what the hell, cheese is good in moderation."
,skulldragon,2012-12-29T06:25Z,"There are actually only 3 reviews at IMDB and indeed most high scores of modern movies are actually forged.

Quote from a real critic about this movie:
""If you watch this you will see doors slamming on their own and static camera shots with cgi shadow ghost walking around. Then a ghost will be jump cut directly in front of the camera, and he will make a scary ghost face. People will argue about whether they should leave or not. No one ever thinks to stop filming. Deaths will occur off screen because there wasn't room in the budget for anything real. IMDb will have plant reviews that give it a 10/10 and claim it's the second coming of Christ. I particularly like the shill review that pretty much says, ""Watch this movie! IT'S GOT TITTIES!"" """
