  Statistics' Denver Dalley takes his work very seriously. As an artist, music means much more in literal terms for Dalley, and that's probably why he's ventured off in different directions. He wants to experiment, and the desire to do so was exactly right on his 2003 self-titled EP. His research and development continues on Statistics' first full-length album, Leave Your Name. Less concentrated on complex electronic arrangements, Leave Your Name thrives on layered guitars for something more hook-based. Rich new wave synths aren't entirely done away with; they're just evenly widespread with the idea that Leave Your Name should be completely separate from the Statistics EP. Shimmering electronic bits fade into a dynamic guitar set on the emo-like "Sing a Song." Dalley's vocals are crisp, highlighting his growing confidence as a singer. "The Grass Is Always Greener" and "2 A.M." are more melodic and straightforward with floating strings. Leave Your Name is an album that's loaded with lush instrumentation, a cinematic soundscape that flows freely thanks to Dalley's meticulous approach. He doesn't think too hard about how it should be. He lets the songs do that for him.
