,ptv83,2012-12-29T01:10Z,"as incorrectly nitpicked in another uploaders comments by some douchebag...

should be mentioned that apparently nLiBRA Video source is russian r5.. aka: everything in the video is written in russian

not mentioned in title of torrent or anywhere in info.

then again extremezone was never a detailed oriented uploader anyways.. if for whatever reason this sort of thing (R5 source video) then you've been warned.. then again, if you are bothered by such things.. then you  probably havelearned long ago that extremezone torrents are definitely not for you (constantly misslabelled and misrepresented mass/spam uploading of everything that hits the scene and never checking to either see if it's fake or not)"

translation .. i don't care if somebody is on limited bandwidth cap for the month (or all months), they can download my torrents and deal with whatever copy/paste torrent i grabbed from the scene because i pick and choose what info to provide or not provide. dont worry EZ you've proven this many times in the past with many torrents.

Agapadar, the text in an R5 is in russian, and i said that it was complained about in another users comments of the same torrent (even though he clearly wrote it was an R5 source)
. i even said apparently, as in: i've not downloaded this; it's been reported as such.. if this bothers you, you have the information now as it's not above so don't complain if you had the chance to read the correction.

fuckin zealots... yeeash!"

LOL, I better check myself .. LMFAO. sure
.. you should go check your history facts before you tell a guy you know nothing about to go check himself.

Extremezone got his/her/it's skull taken away for misslabelling/missrepresenting and uploading fakes (either intentional or not checking while enmass copy/paste scene uploading)

search the piratebay's forums superbay on the subject of extremezone's torrent credibility.

i myself have been burned several times before i learned to stay clear of extremezone uploads .. afterall the comments are never any good.. they're all 10/10 keep up the good work! .. (zealots who haven't dl'd the file yet and have yet to even realise that EZ doesn't do any rips.. )

,ba567,2012-12-29T06:43Z,piv83 sounds like you're crying like a little bitch over some spilled milk
,iamtrombone,2012-12-29T06:52Z,wah wah wah...people bitch about a title being in russian and then someone leaving a damn notice in the NFO. the rip is high quality and its before american dvd release. everyone shut your damn pie hole and watch them movie.
,iamtrombone,2012-12-29T06:52Z,if you are going to bitch about a misrepresentation at least do it when the misrepresentation ACTUALLY CHANGES the quality of viewing the movie itself.
,ptv83,2012-12-29T07:08Z,"ba567 is correct LMFAO = boo-fuckin-hoo with tears a plenty.

why i've soaked my t-shirt so obviously is so.. because extremezone floods the different torrent sites with links and spam mail to his torrents, with frequently fakes dowload stats to make his torrents appear more popular than they are, to misrepresent his torrents as better quality than they really are so he'll get more downloads and zealots .. 

yes all this brings me to my knees with sadness because all those downloads do.. what exactly against me?  nothing, i'm not a rival uploader (no harm there) extremezone makes money from all of this(nope again) , he's somehow stealing from me(nope) he's waisted my bandwidth(nope, i've always had unlimited even when i did download his torrents regularly enough to get bit several times)

maybe i'm crying because .. well i can't think of any reason really... so back to LMFAO. what the fuck is wrong with you zealots? seriously ignorant.

refer to my original post in the comments.. 1. useful information, properly relayed in the manor of a). not representing first hand knowledge when it was only reported to me by several trusted sources b). had been complained about by user michaelrwatson in several other non-extremezone users uploads who actually wrote that the source was russian (but not extremezones.. given the history of EZ spamming other users torrents this is no surprise at all.)

2. thought that this would normally be of little issue, especially to the loyal zealots of extremezone who should be used to getting somehing different than advertised by now. (to which the history and the testimony of mods and other users have proven factual and relevant.)

,PirateWizard,2012-12-29T11:35Z,"First, thank you for the upload...

Now about all this bitching. I will say, with all due respect, that extremezone torrents are sometimes not quite what I would consider what the label represents. However, they are always good. I never considered that some people might be on ""limited bandwidth"" and whatnot. However again, this is their choice. If they download an extremezone torrent, and do not find it to their liking, they do not have to upload from him again. I have unlimited, so if he has something I'm interested in, though I may not always be ""100%"" happy, I've never, EVER, been flat out disappointed.

At the end of the day, he is uploading quality torrents that otherwise I would not find elsewhere, or would have to wait several more days or weeks to get. So thank you very much extremezone. Your work is very much appreciated."

,minkepants,2013-01-04T05:00Z,"I appreciate the time and effort of the up-loader.

The quality is just fine. 

The movie is garbage. It's not just that I don't like the way the ""central metaphor' is presented.

The movie is inept. In one scene Ray Liotta gets out of a car in a torrential downpour. It is incredibly obvious that the rain is coming down between him and the camera, as neither him, nor his clothes, become wet. Then the scene cuts to a second camera angle, and, instantly, he's as wet as a drowned rat.

Continuity much?

I know I should be concentrating on the deep underlying message of the movie, rather than its realism, but that's difficult to do when the set-up is so ridiculous:

Two idiots rip off a mafia card game; a game that's already been robbed: 

We're to believe

1.) There's no doorman/ security at the game, even though the game has already been subject to a prior heist.
2.)The twenty wise guys in attendance have no problems depositing a combined hundred thousand dollars in buy-in money in a brief case which is left unprotected and unattended in a cupboard in another room
3.)The two thieves are able to walk out of the heist, one at a time, down a hundred foot long alleyway, with no one so much as attempting a pursuit, or, say, pointing a gun down said alleyway and killing the thieves.

Scene after scene is stretched by the use of CNN and CSPAN, not because the message needs to be repeated with such frequency, but because MR. Dominik is a lazy, stoned writer who couldn't be bothered to rouse himself from his lethargy long enough to finish writing a script.

The only reason I can see for this movie's existence is that Brad Pitt enjoys getting baked with it's director. In order for Mr. Pitt to feel he is spending his recreation time with a colleague rather than a paid flunky, an employee, he leaned his considerable clout to the making of this careless mess.

Awww.... Brad bought a friend.

This movie, isn't just bad. It's incompetent."

The director isn't australian dipshit. And typing up a full page essay about how the movie sucked because you didn't like it and other people do doesn't make you automatically smart.

You'll never use The Pirate Bay ever again because you watched a movie you thought was bad? Be right back, excuse me while I go huddle up in the corner and cry myself into a coma.

It's horrible in that WTF did I just watch way. Don't think getting it for free here is great bc you are not paying money for it...if you watch it, you are still wasting your time. 

Seriously, I'm trying to help others avoid watching this POS. I can't remember the last time I watched a movie that was this awful. "

,Catsar,2013-01-04T21:43Z,"@pvt83 I have never posted something to bash someone ever.  I only post my honest opinion, your opinion is noted, your facts and proof supporting your opinions of EZ are outdated by over 3 years.  I read the forum you posted, its dated 2009, ok he did some things to lose his skull back then, shit happens, people make mistakes, your not perfect either and those facts are no longer relevant.  You find something factual a little more recent then perhaps I would give you frame of mind.  You seen the uploader when you clicked on the movie, you know you don't like EZ, you complain about his spam from years ago, you rub his name in the dirt, you have no supporting recent facts, in my mind you are just a spammer getting off on flaming someone else.  You don't like them that's your right, don't click on their name, don't creep through their uploads, don't download their upload, basically go somewhere else.  Don't continue to crucify someone for their past mistakes cause you look like an ass doing it."

I watched this for 37 minutes before I gave up. I was hoping the movie would pick up. It didn't. The movie is slow moving. I didn't care for any of the characters. The director does not know how to tell a story while keeping the viewer engaged.

I guess Brad Pitt didn't have anything else to do so he decided to star in this turkey.
