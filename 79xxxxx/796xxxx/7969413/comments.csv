Can you put a README file or version number in your activator?

Thanks a lot mate."
,dechronic,2012-12-29T16:18Z,"The version number is in the name of the batch file and when you run (as administrator) it shows the version number at the top. The README part of it is imbedded in the program as it gives instructions on what to do as you go along. If you still having difficulty, please let me know."
,love404,2012-12-29T16:39Z,"Thanks for your awesome work dechronic!

Do you know how to enable Advanced Inventory features in Enterprise 2013? There is a button at the bottom left of the main window that says ""Turn on Advanced Inventory"" which transports to a web browser giving a phone number to activate the feature.

I understand that Intuit changes a setting on their end and then the user has to select ""Sync license data online"" from the Help menu. Can we somehow patch this check to return result of Advanced Inventory enabled?"
,jzelaya,2012-12-29T19:45Z,"For some reason the activator BAT file is closing itself after I press enter the second time when it says that it will close any open quickbooks processes. I am running Win XP SP3 as administrator, and should I drop a copy od the DLL that comes with the activator on C:Program FilesIntuitQuickbooks Enterprise Solution 13.0 or what could I be doing wrong?"
,jzelaya,2012-12-29T19:49Z,is there any way you can get in touch with me I'd like to donate for your time and I also need a little help. jzelaya@usa.net
,rsaraiva,2012-12-30T00:02Z,@jzelaya I can help you and you donÂ´t need to spend money. What is wrong?
,jzelaya,2012-12-30T00:09Z,"my problem is that the activator closes up when i run it, when it starts to look for open quickbook processes after i press enter it closes up and does not do anything. "
,jzelaya,2012-12-30T00:25Z,"my problem is that the BAT file that comes with the activator keeps quitting. When it says that it will close running processes, i click enter and it immediately closes. I have tried replacing the dll file  with one found in windows microsoft.net etc but with no luck it still says i only have 9 days left."
,jzelaya,2012-12-30T00:26Z,my problem is that come jan ist i have to start with a fresh copy of my company file with 0 transactions and if i do not get to crack it i will have to use 2010 pro which i am already running.
,dechronic,2012-12-30T03:20Z,"@jzelaya
I'll try and look into it."
,dechronic,2012-12-30T03:48Z,"VERY TO SORRY EVERYONE ABOUT THIS VERSION.
I missed one bracket that ""broke"" it and this version does NOT work.

Please use version 0.13 at http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7970916
Thanks to jzelaya for pointing this out to me."
,dsteelspecialist,2012-12-30T04:08Z,"Dechronic, beast et al, again thank you for this patch.

I am just wondering, are you all familiar with the crack and keygen of linezero for qb2012 ent. It works great. It is just that they dont have a crack for qb2013. And it seems people using piratebay are different from the one using warezbb, where the crack of linezero is posted. And vice versa.

A lot of people in piratebay who are using qb11 and are just waiting for beast to crack qb12 and they are not aware that qb12 by linezero is already available in warezbb."
,dechronic,2012-12-30T04:50Z,"@dsteelspecialist
Beast_iND's activator v0.5 Build 63 works all the way up to Quickbooks 2012. It doesn't work with QB2013 as that is using a newer version of the dll file that is manipulated.
He released the activator since nov 2010.
