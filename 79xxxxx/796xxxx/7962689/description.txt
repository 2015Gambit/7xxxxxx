It's interesting that the Freedom Fighters were a group of Quality Comics superheroes acquired by DC (much like the Charlton heroes, including Blue Beetle, Captain Atom and Rorsch-- um, er, The Question). It's also notable that they were NOT a team at Quality, but were only packaged as such once they "reached" DC.

If you download this, check out issues 8 and 9 in which the Fighters go up against thinly-veiled copies of CAPTAIN AMERICA, THE HUMAN TORCH and SUB-MARINER!

In addition to Freedom Fighters volume 1, I included the two-part JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA story that introduced the group. And just for the hell of it, I also threw in the rarely-torrented two-part UNCLE SAM Vertigo book, fully-painted by ALEX ROSS!

From Wikipedia:

Freedom Fighters is a DC Comics comic book superhero team made up of characters acquired from the defunct company Quality Comics. Although the characters were created by Quality, they never were gathered in a group before acquired by DC. The team first appeared in a Justice League of America/Justice Society of America team-up, which ran in Justice League of America #107-108 (OctoberΓÇôDecember 1973), written by Len Wein and drawn by Dick Dillin. Their own ongoing series premiered with Freedom Fighters #1 (April 1976), written by Gerry Conway and Martin Pasko, and drawn by Ric Estrada.
