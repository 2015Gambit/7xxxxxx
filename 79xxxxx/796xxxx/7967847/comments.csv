,ptv83,2012-12-29T01:02Z,"michaelrwatson needs to:
 1. learn to read
 2. go troll spam someone elses account like extremezon who a). uploaded this same rip and didn't say squat about the russian r3 rental r5 source
b). has a history of mislabelling uploads, uploading fakes, and password protected rar files
3. learn to fucking read
4. go do steps 1 and 2 and 3 again
5. repeat number 4. until he learns to read
6. fuck off and learn to read"
