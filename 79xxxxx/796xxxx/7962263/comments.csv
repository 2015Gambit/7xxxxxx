Many new content sample scenes are provided, ranging from simple scenes to help get you up to speed with 501 new features to more detailed scenes that show off advanced rigging and rendering features. Over 60 brush presets are provided along with material presets designed especially for use while sculpting.

Scene files, presets, textures and more
In addition to the new material textures shown earlier, many new scene files and presets are provided in modo 501, including: brushes, meshes, rigs, materials â&#x20AC;&#x201C; even a handy set of monster teeth! Much of this new content is designed to specifically use or demonstrate the use of new modo features and workflows. Almost all of it comes from the beta testing team who helped test modo 501."
