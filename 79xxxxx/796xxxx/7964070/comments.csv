,akosiroel,2012-12-28T02:05Z,I wish people would just put their A/V rating instead of the link to the film's imdb page. People know how to use google after all.
,dyland10,2012-12-28T02:07Z,Whats the deal here
,bangingyourmomallnight,2012-12-28T03:00Z,"What the fuck is this shit. v/4 a/7.
Are you guys still camming? When is the REAL dvdscr coming out?"
,CarlZeiss,2012-12-28T03:42Z,Is this a screener or a filmed screen?
,goatmanilla,2012-12-28T04:35Z,I believe it to be a screener since it does have a blurred out watermark.
,mpenn20,2012-12-28T04:47Z,"lol @bangingyourmomallnight you are a trolling twat. quality is awesome legend, blurred watermark at bottom for entirety of movie, but honestly who cares? Thanks for the up, excellent belated christmas gift V9A9"
,MrBishop,2012-12-28T05:19Z,Don't listen to the first person rating this movie because its really really good quality and there is no way in hell you give the video a 4.  C'mon man!  The movie is very good except for the blurred out watermark on the screen.  I would give this a 8a/7v(because of the blur) if not more.  
,JarjarTwink,2012-12-28T06:20Z,"A 8
V 8

thanks =) "
,spina27,2012-12-28T09:40Z,"Perfect copy I dunno what people have to complain about? Thanks! Can you get The guilt trip, chasing maverics or the possesion?"
,vocalised80,2012-12-28T09:40Z,"Thanks heaps LegendET big up bruva!!

I don't think we willl get this tonight due to all the INSIGNIFICUNT Leechers out there, if only they would let it seed we would all get more more often.

A tiny watermark vs shit quality.... I take the mark any day.

I give it V/8 from the screens
and MrBishop writes quality comments so I take his rating for audio and a big win for all us PB surfers, happy new year."
,vocalised80,2012-12-28T09:41Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!!!!
,vocalised80,2012-12-28T11:46Z,SERIOUSLY PEOPLE...... SEED!!!
,BreezeTDK,2012-12-29T08:12Z,"Thank you!  +1

V=6 (blurred a few times, but came right back)
A=9 (but it is 2ch stereo)

Not a cam.  Blur mark at bottom to cover screener titling.  Excellent for a DVD Screener.
