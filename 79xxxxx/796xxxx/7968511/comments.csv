V-10
A- 10
M- 8.5

Unbelievable how stupid or naive people can be.  The level of stupidity is incredible but well done movie with great cast who did such challenging rolls.  Although the level of stupidity is unbelievable the movie was till good and convincingly done...hard to believe this was inspired by true events!"

,trywait4,2013-01-01T11:49Z,"Totally agree with Glenn_K9, and was about to make a similar comment! Don't watch this movie if you are proud to be of the human race. Unbelievable that it is based on true events.
A/V 10, M 5, predicable, though does make you question, ""What are you thinking!?"". yuk."
