[T],ShoReleases,2012-12-29T17:33Z,It's not fake u a$$hole. It is ep10. 
,sadjeppe,2012-12-29T18:14Z,"This is not the ""Leprechaun Gold"" episode!
Leprechaun Gold is not aired yet (Jan 4th, 2013). 
This is ""Bio Special (The Dirt)"" episode, who aired on December 28, 2012."
,veedmo,2012-12-29T18:19Z,"I call Bullshit! This file is The Dirt, not a proper ep at all. The description makes it a fake. "
,veedmo,2012-12-29T18:30Z,The Dirt and nothing else. The description does in no way match the file. Fake.
[T],ShoReleases,2012-12-29T19:18Z,Many sites have this wrongly named. -BALLSITIC grp says it's ep 10. I only uploaded it here. 
[T],ShoReleases,2012-12-29T19:23Z,"Yup, my desc is wrong. It's actually this :
“The Dirt – Bio Special”
Executive Producer Christo Doyle digs deeper into the personal lives of the miners while their wives offer up secrets about their early years. Also included is a special sneak peek of what’s ahead in second half of the Gold Rush “Do or Die” season

But it's still ep10 according to the release grp."
,QborT,2012-12-29T20:33Z,"Too fucking funny, people don't seem to understand the difference between fake and incorrect labeling.

Thanks anyways ShoReleases.  "
[T],ShoReleases,2012-12-29T21:04Z,"@QborT : Thanks for the support man :)
& your welcome. :)"

If you chose to upload someone elses fuckup, then you inherit the blame for not taking 5 seconds to check.

For the record, the next episode is s03e09: Leprechaun Gold.

Last weeks busllshit was also and repeat special."
,livens01,2012-12-30T04:37Z,Thanks for the upload!
,panttera,2012-12-30T20:37Z,This is So9 and not So10 FAKE!!!
,Random-User,2012-12-30T22:21Z,"No, its another fucken special for special people who want more repeated footage.

s03e09 (proper indexing) hasn't been release."
,panttera,2012-12-31T00:52Z,Oh great i can see you can Google and i can also tell you are a special person by doing that.
,maniac1755,2013-01-05T23:30Z,"thanks for the upload...it is not a fake, it is simply mislabled!"
,snowdog1,2013-01-06T06:16Z,Works fine. Perhaps those who negative comment should make the effort to u/l rather than d/l and then dog on about a stupid label without appreciation for the 'free' effort. Must be good to be one 'tough ones' who hide behind the anonymity of TPB. Thanx for your effort...
,panttera,2013-01-09T09:42Z,"Listen, all i said was that whoever uploads something needs to label it correctly. I don't give a rats ass if it's free or not on who uploads it or d/ls it. This kind of stuff has been going on for ever you'd think that ppl would learn by now how to do it correctly."
