Everyone knows that Chelsea Knot can't keep a secret

Until now. Because the last secret she shared turned her into a social outcastΓÇöand nearly got someone killed.

Now Chelsea has taken a vow of silenceΓÇöto learn to keep her mouth shut, and to stop hurting anyone else. And if she thinks keeping secrets is hard, not speaking up when she's ignored, ridiculed and even attacked is worse.

But there's strength in silence, and in the new friends who are, shockingly, coming her wayΓÇöpeople she never noticed before; a boy she might even fall for. If only her new friends can forgive what she's done. If only she can forgive herself.
