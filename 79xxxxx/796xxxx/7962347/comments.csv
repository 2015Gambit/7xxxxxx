Same as the source !!

RC means Region C  [this one is Russian ]

I have my own 720p h264 rip [not released] ...but I'll wait 'til comes RA or RB release HD to make the proper one !!!"

,Up_Yours_,2012-12-29T06:38Z,RC stands for Release Candidate.

Up_Yours_ ... Wrrroooong! Very wrong and tendentious and ... with obvious bad language [why Up_Yours_ ??]

See SuperBay forum's thread about this subject:

https://forum.suprbay.org/printthread.php?tid=96852

Still RC stands for Region C [and in this case the source was Russian Bluray !!!].

Happy Holidays to EveryOne !!"
