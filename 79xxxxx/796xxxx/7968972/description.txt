Pure - ATV is not a simulator, and did not race at all in the conventional sense. Motorcycle speed competition imply a bitter struggle for the first place, masterful cornering and error-free ride. There is all this does not matter, but the most interesting is high above the ground. Every bump or jump - an excellent opportunity to break away from the dirt road and a couple of fantastic otkabluchit somersaults. Repeat them in life is not something that is dangerous, but it is physically impossible, but in this lies the beauty of Pure. The game defies the law of gravity, with a crash hurt oneself genre framework and treacherously steals all my free time, at least in the first few days after they met.
