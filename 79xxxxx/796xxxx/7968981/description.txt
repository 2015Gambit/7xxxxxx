Tammy is mellower and more reflective than in the seventies but still sounding as good as ever. Gone are the songs about standing by - or standing up to - her man, that generated so much interest early in her career. Also gone are the songs about children. Of course, anybody who followed Tammy's career knows that these songs had already become a rarity.

Bob Montgomery produced this album. A few years earlier, he was Janie Fricke's producer on a couple of albums. One of the songs that Janie recorded with Bob, Where's the fire, is covered by Tammy here. Other highlights here include Let's call it a day today, Suddenly single and What goes with blue, but there are many wonderful songs here.
