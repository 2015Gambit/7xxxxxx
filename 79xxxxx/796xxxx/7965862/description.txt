Perhaps the band-name refers to the convergence of two North American
improvisers ΓÇô cornetist Taylor Ho Bynum and drummer Harris Eisenstadt ΓÇô and two
from the UK: pianist Alexander Hawkins and bassist Dominic Lash. Or perhaps it
refers to their distinctive synthesis between composition and improvisation,
arrangement and spontaneity. In any case, this fine CD is their second release,
recorded in the studio during the course of a short UK tour in spring 2009. The
nine tunes include originals by each member along with Leroy JenkinsΓÇÖ ΓÇ£Albert
Ayler (His Life Was Too Short)ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Kudala,ΓÇ¥ a traditional South African
song. HereΓÇÖs a band that truly understands how to ride the edge of
inside/outside, at times dulcetly melodic, at other times quite prickly; theyΓÇÖre
always doing something unexpected, weaving their way through collective
counterpoint, lyrical solos, and bracing free interludes, as well. Early
Ellington is a strong influence, and you can hear that the bandmembers have
learned much from ongoing work with musicians like Braxton, Evan Parker, Lol
Coxhill, and Joe McPhee, but they all have forged distinctive voices on their
instruments. LetΓÇÖs hope this long-distance Trans-Atlantic relationship
continues, as this is a group that deserves to be more than an occasional
project.
