A&E presents the new original real life series ""Be the Boss"", a competition-based series that pits two employees of a franchise-based company in the battle of a lifetime - with the chance to become the owner of their very own franchise - to, in success, become their own boss. ""Be the Boss"" premieres Sunday, December 2 at 10PM ET/PT. From the Emmy-award winning creators of ""Undercover Boss"", ""Be the Boss"" faces off two lower-level employees from the ranks, giving them the chance at what they think is a big promotion. In each episode, the CEO summons two deserving candidates to the company headquarters and subsequently puts them through a series of challenges to test their mettle at being in a senior management role. Both employees battle to prove they should earn the promotion, but they're in for the shock of their lives when they discover that an even greater opportunity is ultimately at stake - the keys to their very own franchise! With franchise fees often running into the hundreds of thousands and sometimes even exceeding one million dollars, ""Be the Boss"" offers one of the largest prizes in all of television... and the promotion goes to the runner-up!
