Description
It is impossible to over-emphasize the crucial nature of note-keeping in A&E. An average junior doctor or nurse will be involved directly in the treatment of up to 3000 new 

patients during a 6 month period. With the passage of time, it is impossible to remember all aspects relating to these cases, but there may be a requirement to give evidence 

in court, several years after the initial event. The only reference will be the notes made much earlier. Medicolegally, the A&E record is the prime source of evidence in 

medical negligence cases (p30)
