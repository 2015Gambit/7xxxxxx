FUCK ME!!!

If some of you just let it SEED instead of LEECHING

You would not be such INSIGNIFICUNTS!!!!

On a funnier note the book describes JR as 6'5 & 200+ pounds........ok TC.

@michaelrwatson, your still a douche!!

,cool_blade,2012-12-27T04:49Z,"Its really watchable.

Too much bass in the audio, use vlc to correct that.
Video, Slightly flickers throughout.

Solid first cam

V=6
A=6"
,observations,2012-12-27T06:53Z,"just watched first 5 mins. 6/6 smallest amount of flickering, but it's consistent so it's hardly a distraction. As mentioned the bass is touchy but that's a small flaw and an easy fix. I didn't mess with it any - I find it very watchable as is. Took a while to complete, please seed. Unless you're waiting for BR this is the torrent you want.

Thanks srkfan."
,BostonAl2012,2012-12-27T09:43Z,"A good Honest 6/6~which means pretty good for a CAM~can't complain about that!

Have to agree with vocalised80:

Thanks for UL srkfan!  :)"
,rooboy64,2012-12-27T13:53Z,No Flicker  Bull Shite this movies got more flicker then a 50s silent movie and the pictures crap too nice try uploader but i would only rate it 2/5 video and 3/5 sound thanks anyway 
,tverlaine,2012-12-27T17:14Z,"Thanks for the work you put into this and all your others,not bad for an early cam,but will wait a little while longer."

Video is excellent, audio-some parts are incomprehensible, but without those parts one can still put together the film, what is spoken has been heard in so many movies, so one can guess of what is being said. "

,cm1975,2012-12-27T23:58Z,watchable cam thanks
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-28T08:19Z,"@vocalised80, amoulak: I'm going to quit seeding just for you assholes. From now on, i download at full speed, upload at 5k/sec, and stop it as soon as i've got the file. And why should i download 1.4 GIGAbytes just to find out it's a piece of shit?

Well, i did download it on campus (2MB/s, sweet) and this has fairly nasty flicker throughout, as others have commented. I will say the sound is better than advertised though. Thx, OCW, srkfan."
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-28T08:22Z,And is it really necessary to make this 1.4 GB? Why not 700MB? It's only a cam (and not a great one at that).....
,aalinares14,2012-12-28T10:02Z,"anyone else hear the background sound of a guy at the end of the movie saying ""listen to me when i talk to you or something"" ?i thought it was very strange he sounded as if he was yelling and in a movie theatre ? "

,YardBoy,2012-12-31T04:31Z,"Thanks 2.06X so far, +1 to a quality ULer and those who seed.  The film was quite watchable.  V7/A6.  The visual flicker lasts thru the entire film as does the hollow audio, coughs, throat clearings and laughing."
,schlinks,2012-12-31T04:37Z,"Rating for a cam
V=9
A=7 
Flicker isn't bad u tards! It's a fucking cam ur not gonna get blue ray quality! The audio is a little bad in some parts but for the most part it's watchable with almost no disappointments. 

@ aalinares14 that was the dude arguing with his gf in the bus u jack ass! lol"
,schlinks,2012-12-31T04:43Z,"also forgot to say, the dude recording the movie needs to chill the fuck out with the zoom button. there would be nothing wrong with the zoom then all of a sudden dude starts clicking away, fuckin it up. sorry that was my only major problem lol!"
,YardBoy,2012-12-31T04:43Z,"Why do so many cry ""seed"" and yet don't indicate what they seed?  And don't all clients behave as mine [Transmission}, i.e. as soon as it starts leeching, it simultaneously seeds twice as much?  Giving 2X as much as you get makes sense to me.  My ratio over 134 days is actually 4.11X [198GB leeched, 815GB seeded]."
,moeburn1,2012-12-31T16:41Z,"There is an HD version of this exact cam at torrent[slash]7964397 , but here's my review of it:

V7/A5. Video is kinda flickery in some points, could be fixed if people used MANUAL exposure and white balance! Also the cam's little mic couldn't handle the rumbling bass, and sometimes it is difficult to hear what people are saying. Lots of coughing, sneezing, audience noises, etc. Also cam guy couldn't keep his hands off the camera, kept adjusting zoom levels and pressing buttons that made a loud click every time.

Buuuut nonetheless its a very watchable cam rip, and I'm picky. The video quality is more important to me, and aside from zooming in too far at points, its fine."

,jb72179,2013-01-01T02:30Z,"Definitely watchable... for a cam.

A: 8
V: 6

,DrMD,2013-01-01T06:36Z,"It's a cam but video is fair sound is like in an echo chamber, you can barely understand the dialog and someone is coughing every 19-15 minutes in background. If you just gotta let me tell you it isn't even that great of a movie."
,Bunstuff,2013-01-01T12:48Z,"Cams are for people who want to see the show or learn the story,; generally, we want to see if we should spend the $$ on the DVD or Blue-ray. So a good Cam does not need a high quality and so is evaluated differently from a 720p or a 1080p. We expect the audio to be bad with the occasional giggle or cough or scraping of feet or fart (or, in this case, a huge belch). We expect the video to be unclear or (a lttle) fuzzy now and then. 

The following comments are to help the cammer improve his game. Respects to the cammer for doing his bit for the community.

In this copy, we have an A=3 – too much booming, too many level changes and too much audience participation (the above-mentioned coughing, sneezing and farting). You have to fiddle the sound considerably and still resign yourself to not being able to understand around one line in eight.

In addition, I rate this as V=3.  The cammer had an unfortunate tendency to play with the zoom, all through the recording. In addition, he decided to “fill frame” in the most unfortunate manner. A lot of the actors looked like they had been trepanned, as well as undergoing jaw surgery.

I rate M=8. Interesting little caper-flick; a bit clichéd, but show me one caper-flick that ain’t. Also, there was the occasional reach for the cheap laugh, which detracted a bit IMHO. However, it’s very watchable, and, personally, I’m getting the DVD or Blue-ray when it comes out."
,caballero350,2013-01-02T05:35Z,"People, its not a digital copy, its a fucking cam bootleg, for Christsakes. Stop your bitchin!!!! Its VERY good quality, for a CAM BOOTLEG!!!"
,nobodynever,2013-01-02T16:38Z,"Hey asshole:  Point the russett potato you're using to record the movie at the screen, turn it on, then leave it the fuck alone.  No need whatsoever to constantly adjust it through out the movie.  "
,oldcarman,2013-01-02T17:52Z,"Overall not too bad for a cam, more than watchable, video decent at about 6 or 7 audio at about 4 or 5 Cruise needs to grow another foot and put on about eighty pounds to take on roles like this as he does not seem credible, he seems to ruin what could be a good movie...."

It's a cam so you're not getting dvd quality.  But it is watchable.  Audio is not great but it works good enough.  Some audio was difficult to decipher but no big deal.  But there was a guy that kept on coughing in the audience!  lol!

Movie was pretty entertaining as well.  Thanks SilverTorrent!  "
,suiteo,2013-01-10T07:32Z,"It's not the ZOOM that's your major problem schlinks.  Your major problem is your foul mouth along with your lack of intelligence!  If you have to be that vulgar when you criticize, just don't say anything at all."
,ectoendomezo,2013-01-10T16:47Z,"@Bunstuf..

Exactly..well said..

And I would add..some of us are actually into the audience.

No Joke..along with bunstuf's CAM statement which is highly accurate..I for example..truly enjoy the strange reality of 'listening to the watchers'...the audience noises are fascinating..NO audience in our town would EVER make such noises.. its almost a 'double feature'..""More Real Than Real""..""Smell-o-Vision"""
