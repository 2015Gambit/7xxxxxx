[V],alexisthebest,2013-01-03T09:30Z,"I saw this was released and was rather interested by the idea. Downloaded this and rest assured, i was hooked once i saw YouTubers pop up.
I immediately stopped watching and got the 1080p version.

This is a great movie.
Obviously not the best, but it was a lot more enjoyable than some of the shit Hollywood puts out.

Started searching around and found out it was a series of episodes.

Gonna keep an eye out for the newer stuff coming out.

Support these guys. They worked hard and it's one hell of a job!"
