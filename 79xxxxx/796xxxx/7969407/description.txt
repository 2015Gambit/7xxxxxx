Description:
Hybrid of action, role-playing and real-time strategy, developed by Chris Taylor and his Gas Powered Games with a clear eye on the unrivaled mod Defence of the Ancients for Warcraft 3, more popularly known as DotA. In which, unlike the other "right┬╗ RTS, you gather resources and to clone units in the barracks, but manage with only one hero who gives slap neutral monsters and heroes of the opponents. Experience, money, buying valuable items - like all the best houses in the genre of role.
Approximately on the same principles will be built and Demigod. You control one of the many "demigod", very different from each other. Someone "leaves" solely on their own skills and physical strength, sending the opponent in the knock-out with a couple of blows, some rely on large amounts of calls on pot-bellied little thing. One of the characters presented - The Rook - the late King, the spirit that animates the battlefield walking castle with an impressive hammer.
Of course, at stake will be made to fight online, in particular - to the cooperative. Single-user mode also takes place, although, according to the developers themselves, it will be nothing more than a training ground before going to the "online."
