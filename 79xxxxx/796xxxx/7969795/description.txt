Science for Everyone Series

Elementary Kinematics of Elementary Particles 

by G. I. Kopylov. 

    This book tells a fascinating story of one of physics today: the discovery of primary building blocks of matter. This field of science is called particle or high-energy physics and is one of the frontiers of present day physical research.

    How is it possible to detect particles a hundred thousand times smaller than the atom, which itself is many times smaller than an apple as the apple is smaller than the Earth? How can we follow motion of particles that have velocity almost that of light? How can we measure the lifetime of these particles when it is of the order of 0.00000000000000000000001 second? What kind of clock can we ;'use? How can we investigate the properties of these astonishing and elusive bits of matter?

    All these and many other questions are comprehensively answered in this book written for the layman by the late Dr. Gersten Kopylov, who was a prominent scientist, well known in the world of particle physics. This book was written to be understood even by readers having only a secondary school education and it requires a knowledge of only  elementary algebra and geometry. Nevertheless in the author's treatment , the material is no way oversimplified or distorted.

The book was translated from the Russian by Nicholas Weinstein and was first published by Mir in 1983.
