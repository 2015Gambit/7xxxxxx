,grandslammer,2012-12-30T13:59Z,"Got it to work after playing around with the Wineskin settings...not sure exactly what fixed it - I tried opening it once after doing something and it didn't work. Then I tried again straight after, and it worked! It has worked every time since then.

Weird...but at least it's working!"
,Turingmachine,2012-12-30T20:53Z,so the game works fine for me except that people are either floating heads or arms with no bodies. anyone else having this weird glitch? everything else looks fine graphic wise.

You probably have an Intel HD Integrated graphics card. It's not meant for gaming, so you'll have to live with that as that's the best it can do it terms of rendering graphics."

,Apotheus,2013-01-10T21:59Z,"So i downloaded this torrent and it ran fine at Max Setting on my Mac, then around 30 seconds into gameplay the FPS just drops until the game is frozen over a period of a minute.  Is anyone else having this issue? I'm using an early 2011 MBP, Intel HD 3000 Graphics Card.
any feedback would be great.
thank you thenoobish for always being a reliable uploader!"
