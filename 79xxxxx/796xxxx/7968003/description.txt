Full unlocked map of the bicycle release.
Works on all Garmin devices that support this maps.
The advantage is, there is no installation of maps needed on your main pc.
Therefore you save space on your harddisk.
This map can be viewed on the PC by using BaseCamp (Basecamp not included).
The map must be copied on an USB drive, Garmin folder, or in your GPS Garmin folder.
After plugging in the Gps or the Usb stick in te computer.
BaseCamp can read automaticly the maps.

The first time it will take several minutes.
