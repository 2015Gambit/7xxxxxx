This is the episode that was delayed in some parts of the world due to the mass murder at a school in Connecticut earlier on the day initially scheduled for broadcast. If you don't want to watch the episode now then maybe don't download it. For those who want to see what comes after that cliff-hanger ending to s3e11 now you can.
