In most things that aren't WMP you can disable the subtitle track. It isn't hard-coded."

Yes there is an EN subtitles track. ECI, the group that released the first 11 eps of s3 in WEB-DL, did not include the subtitles for those episodes. If you play the episode with VLC you can disable the subtitles track if it annoys you. 

For anyone who is wondering, the episodes (s3e12 & s3e13) haven't been on TV yet in any country but they were released in a few countries where the iTunes release schedule hadn't been updated to reflect the delay in broadcast. This is NOT another copy of the Eureka! Christmas episode ;)"
