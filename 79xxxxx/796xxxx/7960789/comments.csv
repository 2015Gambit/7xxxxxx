Pure prestitute piece on anything damaging their redistribution cause."
,RTT2,2012-12-28T11:39Z,"You're the one 'attacking blindly'. You clearly don't know the background here. The documentary wasn't bad as far as it went, but it's no 'Merchants of Doubt'. In fact some denialists were quite pleased with the exposure it gave them. Not as pleased as they were with the uncritical exposure given to hack Tony Watts that PBS gave before this, though. For that reason this will be seen as 'making amends', sadly.

No mad libertarian ideas of international conspiracy theories, involving thousands of hand-holding, uncompetitive climate scientists, were at work here, no 'Marxists', just the not-too-bad result of a journalistic lapse in allowing 'false balance'...

A Merry Marxist Xmas and a Happy New World Order!

Oops, I mean New Year!"
