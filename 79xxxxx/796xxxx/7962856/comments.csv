I'm just wondering if anyone else is having an issue with the scope sights not appearing.. i noticed on most of the ""marksman sights"" tond have a reticule in them... makes it very hard to snipe if at all... any possibility of a fix? or am i the only one. ive installed everything over twice... and repatched it up to 1.04... but still no sight picture.. iron sights and red dot work.. but the Recurve bow sights both dont show and all of the sniper rifles sight picture aka reticule dont show when looking down the sight. Help me please if anyone knows how to fix or if anyone else has the same problem. i've had this issue with every version of this game. thanks in advance"

,Insomneac,2012-12-27T23:16Z,"To get out of the car in the first mission, you have to reset the use key back to default, get out then set it back to whatever you want.

I can't believe Ubisoft still haven't fixed this."
