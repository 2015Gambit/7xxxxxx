My personal Bonnie Prince Billy / Will Oldham mega collection.

This is almost a complete discography, I am missing a few super-rare 10 and 7 inch vinyl records. 

70 albums and a few live and radio performances, 192kbps - 320kbps with some flac sources as well. MP3 album art embedded.  All tracks are "Album Artist" ID3 tagged as Will Oldham for ease of organization on your favorite playback device.  

I tried uploading this last year and had some kind of problem.  Sorry about that.
It took me almost a decade to collect all of these so if you appreciate the collection please say thanks!
