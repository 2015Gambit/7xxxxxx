Course in Mathematical Analysis Vol. 2 

by 

S. M. Nikolsky. 

The major part of this two-volume textbook stems from the
course in mathematical analysis given by the author for many
years at the Moscow Physico-technical Institute.

The first volume consisting of eleven chapters includes an
introduction (Chapter 1)which treats offundamental notions of
mathematical analysis using an intuitive concept ofa limit. With
the aid of visual interpretation and some considerations of a
physical character it establishes the relationship between the
derivative and the integral and gives some elements of differentiation
and integration techniques necessary to those readers
who are simultaneously studying physics.

The notion of a real number is interpreted in the first volume
(Chapter 2) on the basis ofits representation as an infinite decimal.
Chapters 3-11 contain the following topics: Limit of Sequence,
Limit of Function, Functions of One Variable, Functions
of Several Variables, Indefinite Integral, Definite Integral,
Some Applications of Integrals, Series.

This book was translated from the Russian by V. M. Volosov. The
  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1977 with reprints in
  1981, 1985 and 1987. The copy below is from the 1987 print.
