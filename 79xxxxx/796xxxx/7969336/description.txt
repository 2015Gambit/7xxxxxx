   Top chef and self-confessed petrol head James Martin tells a tale
 of triumph and tragedy as he joins Sir Jackie Stewart on an 
 incredible journey though the legend's life. James gets a
 taste of the swinging seventies, and an insight into Jackie s
 jet set lifestyle as the pair cruise through the Alps in a Pantera 
 supercar before Martin dons the Flying Scotsman s tartan 
 helmet and attempts to drive a 1973 Tyrell F1 car around the
 iconic Monza circuit.
