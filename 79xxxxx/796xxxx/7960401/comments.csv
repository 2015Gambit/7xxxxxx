,spam_hater,2012-12-28T00:03Z,The game works as demo version without the fix... When I apply the fix and start the game I get an error 80010017... Any idea what I do wrong?
[V],thenoobish,2012-12-28T00:22Z,"You have to copy the up0006-NPUB30543_00-LICENSEHIWARPHDD.edаt to the folder /dev_hdd0/home/ 00000001/exdаtа/ and then install the fix.

The 00000001 folder can be named something else, depending on your ps3.

Sorry for not being so clear about it."

My PS3 runs Rogero 4.31 so it seams I don't need the fix. I just placed the .edat in the directory you wrote and the game is unlocked and runs prefectily.

Thank's a lot :-)"
