This movie asks the ultimate question how far would your girlfriend go for you?
This is one of Nikki Fritz's best movies in my opinion. In it she is the wife of a guy who owes her ex a rather large amount of money. He doesn't have the money to pay him back, so what does the Ex do? He breaks her husband's fingers. This makes the husband go into hiding. In return Nikki makes this plan to convince her ex to let her "Work off" the debt by doing favors for him over the week and weekend. Everything from having sex with him to finding out who is after him in court and who the witnesses are. I think they should have had the camera on Nikki more than they did. The lesbian bodyguards didn't do anything, for me they looked too Butch. Other than the lesbian Bodyguards the movie was awesome. I prefer one of those Nikki Fritz massages right now.
