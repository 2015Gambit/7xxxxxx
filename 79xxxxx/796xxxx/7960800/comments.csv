""let's write a script for the board game BATTLESHIP.. okay.. um... nobody has battleships anymore.. hmm.. well nevermind that! ok so what then a period piece from WWI? . NAW that'd make too much damn sense! .. how about ALIENS and they destroy are entire fleet and no other nation in the worl but us americans have warships.. and no land based aircraft or missles are allowed .. so.. so where we gonna get a battleship from again? how about the USS Iowa, it was good to go as late as 2006? and is sitting in San Fransico bay? .. NAW, how about the Missouri! ..But it last saw action in 1992 .. and is nothing but mothballs and steel...  pfft nobody cares about that! this is a crap script aboutbattleship for chist sake.. with aliens andthe US is the only military force left in the world!  Reality is already out the f'n window along with common sense and any logic whatsoever!""
