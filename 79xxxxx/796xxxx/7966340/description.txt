Book Description
================
From Publishers Weekly
A new play is the talk of Cairo. Through the script, the author, a young 
unknown named Abbas Karam Younis, seems to implicate himself in the 
death of his ailing wife and the disclosure to the police of his mother, 
a prostitute, and his father, a gambler. Then Abbas mysteriously vanishes, 
leaving behind a suicide note but no corpse. Previously published here 
in a limited edition, this 1981 novel by the Egyptian Nobel laureate 
adopts the Faulkneresque device of employing a different character to 
narrate each chapter. All four accounts are marked by a deft blend of 
everyday details of Cairo life and compelling, stream-of-consciousness 
monologues. "Abbas could never betray his mother," she muses at one 
point. "He may have scorned everything else, but not my love. Love is 
stronger than evil itself." Throughout, Mahfouz probes the nature of 
art: what is real, what is fantasy. "A play is just a play. Nothing 
more," one character says. "Otherwise, the law would have the right 
to put ninety percent of our authors in the prisoner's dock." This transcendent 
book is evidence of how well Mahfouz's penetrating stories travel across 
cultural borders.
