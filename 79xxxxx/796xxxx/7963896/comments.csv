,Jethroisnowhere,2012-12-29T16:51Z,Does this works on windows 8?
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-29T19:03Z,"@jethroisnowhere

Yes"
,speedingcheetah,2012-12-29T20:55Z,Whats the difference between pro plus and Select edition..Select ed is much bigger file size?
,vze2mp9g,2012-12-30T01:16Z,"The Pro Plus Ed can fit on a DVD. The Select Ed consists of files on your HD, and you can Select what you want to install. The Select Ed, won't fit on a DVD because of it's size. I hope I got that right!"
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-30T04:04Z,"@vze2mp9g

,gin520,2012-12-31T06:31Z,does this include the sharepoint 2013?
,DECA2014,2012-12-31T15:38Z,Thanks  for this. When I activate Office 2013 do I have to worry about it trying to activate a legitimate copy of Win 8?
,Dakeith15,2012-12-31T23:26Z,"KMSNano doesn't work for me. I've disconnected internet, disable firewall, and turned off AV. I ran KMSNano and let it run overnight and when I got up it was still running.

Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?

Win 7 x64"
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-01T01:00Z,"@Dakeith15

If you disconnect your internet how do you expect the App. to be able to reach a server?"
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-01T01:32Z,"Instructions @murphy78

1. Extract the LaNanov10.zip file.
2. Run KMSnano.exe
3. Make sure to allow the windows firewall to have access.
4. Wait a FEW MINUTES while the files run in the background.
(It doesn't let you know when it's done, you can check task manager or just wait a bit)
5. Run the Check_Activation.cmd to verify your KMS activation status.
6. Go about your business. You can get the watermark to go away by auto-hiding the
taskbar or similar system stuff."
,borhan48,2013-01-01T08:25Z,Is this customer preview? 
,DECA2014,2013-01-01T17:50Z,Does this allow you to choose which program to activate ie. win 8 or office 15.
,Dakeith15,2013-01-02T00:03Z,"@2010kaiser I just figured I would have to disconnect my internet. I feel like a noob now. Just got used to disconnecting to crack programs I suppose.

Thanks for the help!"
