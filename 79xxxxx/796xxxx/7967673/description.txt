A couple from a village heads towards the city to start there new life. They face a lot of problems in coping up with the city life. Survanta is the movie all about the story of there journey how they cope up with the city life and live happily ever after.

Dr.Shreeram Lagoo and Nilu Phule try to recreate the Saamna(1975) magical encounter in this movie after a gap of almost 20 years. Shreeram Lagoo marks his entry in the movie and his first encounter with Nilu bhau with "Kunachya Khandyavar Kunache Oze" playing in the background. Dr.Lagoo and Nilu kaka even call each other Master & Maalak in this movie just like Saamna. But since the encounter is very brief and not the heart of the story, this movie fails to create the Saamna magic.
