[S],Agricola,2012-12-29T00:49Z,STOP uploading the same thing more than once
,hypercenter666,2012-12-29T02:13Z,"this torrent contains updated epub files for specific devices & the inclusion of a musical piece to accompany the novel, a 70 minute industrial/rock musical piece of the same name. This is not a repeating file. This is providing mre choice for downloaders, respecting their individual needs and in case of the added album, giving an extra dimension to my art. And a key ingredient here is my art. I have chosen The Pirate Bay to exclusively provide my novels and music for free. This is not borrowed files, borrowed art or stolen and claimed art. This is an artist who has taken his heart and his soul, the body of his work and is giving it to people who want  to feel and be affected.

i thought you represented freedom lol
i will try to be less right when i write from now on. 
Or would it be more appropriate if i created a new account, pretended to steal the files and uploaded them so we can pretend to be anti-industry "
[S],Agricola,2012-12-29T02:32Z,"the file you upload 3 times was exactly the same size, down to the bit, with the same files in it"
[S],Agricola,2012-12-29T02:38Z,and what comment removed ?
,hypercenter666,2012-12-29T05:00Z,"issues with computer. comment vanished and re-appeared. face to face communication is always more appropriate. I attempted to upload the file to music and ebooks sections, compromising potential people who might be swimming in either stream. If this has breached an uploading moral code than I apologise. I'm just trying to give people some really cool fucking art. "
,frobknob,2012-12-29T12:11Z,"You've uploaded this at least THIRTY times already! You don't need to u/l in so many different formats, there are format converters available. You're spamming the fuck out of this thing."
,hypercenter666,2012-12-29T16:16Z,"you1re assuming that every downoader has the technical capability to use a converter and that every single person who has downloaded each individual version will willingly take the risk downloading the software and understanding the software. The only reason we weriters bother is because we have to, because we don't have the financial resources to pay professionals to do the work for us. Our effort and our focus is on creating our art, in this case an 80,000 word novel - 3 n fact which were written consecutivey and are being given away for free as well as a very complex piece of music. It would be same to assume that the 2000 people who downloaded more than likely have never heard of Calibre software or other conversion software and are looking for convenience of a file that suits their specific needs and device, such is the nature of the digital consumer world we live. As a writer it is concerns i must take into account when providing my art.  Better that the some wuality art pass through these seas than the grouoped spamming of mediocrity such as Bieber, Twiilight & 50 shades of who gives a fuck that colours the sea bland and contrite unto which The PIrate hoists its sail. In a short period have i really done anyone any wrong. Read my work, the first page. This isn't spam. This is the highest calibre of writing that I have chosen to give for free and which people are willingly downloading and thanking me for doing so. This si what the piratebay stands for. This is people providing for people, without industry. In fact, in promote and defend  The PIrate Bay in the forums that i communicate my art. I am trying; with my art, to redefine that attitude towards downloaders, that they are in fact curious cats and not the thieving criminals described by industry and independant artists and as for the Pirate bay, i am trying in tow to show that when it comes to truly independant art, the pirate bay is artist friendly and can help an artist to take their creation to conscious ears and eyes further than their intention could imagine. The era is changing for Pirate Bay to assume its new role as not just passing on stolen information, but to be the vice to foster artists and to capacitate artists to promote their art and to enable hungry desire ridden consumers, art enthusiasts and the collective conscious to be within reach of new sensations, of new art, travelling together amidst an ocean of quality as opposed to the industrialised mediocrity that stunts artists and consumer's wanton creativity.

yes, there were a few torrents and they have passed now the initial stream. That's fine. Through The Pirate Bay over the xmas period there were approx 2200 people who are now experiencing high quality art, they are experiencing and that is the most important part and they will associate this find, this goodness in life that comes from discovering something of worth, form that something they discovered reminding them that their attention has worth, and they will associate this feeling with The Pirate Bay. Is the Pirate Bay prepared to go from being the rebellious teenager to a nurturing and fostering responsible adult? It is inevitable and all change seems unpredictable and scary. Schopenhauer puts change in 3 states: denial, ridicule and then finally acceptance.

as of now, each torrent has maybe 3-5 leechers per day. At this point the burden and flood sits more on my hard drive than anywhere else but i have to account for the one or two stragglers that come through founded by the unique singular torrent.

I want with my future books (i have 2 more completed to edit, do artwork and upload and am 50% through 4h) directly linked with The Pirate Bay. I do apologise if I came across as spamming or got under your nerves somehow but I do thank you and your time. We have, together, in this time, reasserted expectation and changed people's perspectives. We, together, gave people a surprise, made people happy and gave them free art. You were just as much a part of this as I. so thank you from myself and the thanks i have received for my work and"

This is a collected torrent which now includes the musical that accompanies the album, a 70 minute piece of music. A grouped collection of the art. Download and feel loved.
