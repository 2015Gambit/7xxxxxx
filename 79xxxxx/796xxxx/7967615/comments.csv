[T],mf-den,2013-01-07T15:12Z,"@all: The normal encodes will resume from this thursday, just some urgent matters there to take care, sry for the delay

@petrpan004: Is the site working now, if not tell me what error is shown in the browser
@zaidiishak: We dont have walking dead s02 720p currently in our encodes so will do it sometime in future
@iamdk: Sometime in the weekend
@rameramwe: We're short of encoders atm, so later"
,technoM,2013-01-07T16:59Z,"To open the site:

Go to C:WindowsSystem32driversetc

Open the ""hosts"" file via Notepad and remove the last two lines (if it is minirlss.net). Overall, it should look something like this:

# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost
#	::1             localhost"
,petrpan004,2013-01-08T07:52Z,Thnx a lot..:)..it worked..i removed d last 2 lines 4m d hosts file..
