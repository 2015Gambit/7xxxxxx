"But Seriously, Folks..." is the fourth studio album by Joe Walsh, released in 1978 (see 1978 in music). It included the satirical song "Life's Been Good". The original eight-minute album version of this track was edited down to 4┬╜ minutes for single release and this became Walsh's biggest solo hit, peaking at #12 on the Billboard chart.

The album also features the other four members of the EaglesΓÇöwhich Walsh had joined two years earlierΓÇöas well as singer-guitarist Jay Ferguson, a former member of the groups Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne (who co-wrote one track on the album), drummer Joe Vitale from Walsh's former band Barnstorm, and bassist Willie Weeks.

Original pressings of this record had text engraved on the carry-out grooves:

Side 1: Luncheon Counter of the Deli Kind
Side 2: Call It In the Air!
The leadout track after Life's Been Good has a recording of "A flock of wah-wahs" which is a minute of gibberish wah-wahs.

Walsh ran a mock campaign for President in 1980; one of the planks of his platform was to make "Life's Been Good" the new national anthem.
