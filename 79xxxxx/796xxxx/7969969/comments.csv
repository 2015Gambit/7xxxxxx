,mr_spy,2013-01-02T21:00Z,"alcluizPT* NOTE: We are not noobs! Do not install this patch, because is a hacked fake version of 1.02b a surprise from the developer team. This will overvrite registry and aircraft files makes the plane unflyable. Not a joke I installed this, and seen the result. Recommended to trust me."
,Rolecram,2013-01-05T00:55Z,"Hello alcluizPT, thanks for Aerosoft - Airbus X Extended v1.02c Hot Fix  can post FLYSIMWARE - BELL 47G & SIOUX H-13 FSX 2012 and FLYSIMWARE - SUPER HUEY X 2012 FSX?
Thank you "
,alcluizPT,2013-01-05T01:48Z,"mr_spy No, it's not such thing, the patch is ok, and the plane fly perfect after you apply the fix. I use this to fly in a VA everyday."
,mr_spy,2013-01-05T12:12Z,"Okay. Let's take a turn back to the issue I've suggested. This ""patch"" have the same date of version, same program name (Hotfix 2), same list of files have to modify. -- If you apply this patch, the aircraft loading C/D with huge differences and problems no chocks, unopened cabin doors, fail of checklist, bad configuration of external power unit. The throttle is not working for me, but only if i install this, previous versions were working properly. May this is not enough for you, but I tell you an other thing. I told you, that 1.02b modifing the same two files like this. But this file is 400 kb. and 1.02b is only about 200 kbytes. Inpossible, or something wrong. This patch could not be released the same day with the same files with heavily different size... "

,rmeleby,2013-01-06T03:14Z,I downloaded the 1.02c fix directly from the aerosoft forums and my scarebus still works perfectly. 
,mr_spy,2013-01-07T17:32Z,"rmeleby - What is the version number is located in the title, that you've downloaded? Hotfix (?) Date?
Filesize?"
,mr_spy,2013-01-07T17:36Z,"I apologize from everyone but if this patch is official and the aircraft became form cold and dark to northpole and pitchblack including the putaway of Saitek support, i'll not purchase this. :("
,mr_spy,2013-01-08T13:00Z,"I apologize one more time, I've installed 1.02 clean (did not applied 1.02b) and than downloaded the patch from aerosoft forums and now it is working fine. "
