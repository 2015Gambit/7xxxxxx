,pcfan2013,2012-12-30T14:07Z,"JK425 Who the hell you think you are to call me ""persistent little shit"" i need the game OK? and i don't have the money to buy it! so go to bother someone else! in this place people like Wanderer take the time and effort to share things,not to pick a stupid fight!"
,FrancoHarris,2012-12-30T15:53Z,Wanderer - Nice share! Thanks for this great adventure game. I played it several years ago and loved it. Think I'll D/L this and play it again. GOG has some great games.
