You will need 3D ANAGLYPH RED/BLUE GLASSES to see these properly!!


These are some of the best 3D pics I have ever seen.

363 actual photos in 3D. No artwork or CGI except for GOCE pics.



I have them separated into five categories:

Earth - Earth from space and as seen from the International Space Station or ISS. Also a set of 25 pics of the gravity map of Earth from the GOCE satellite.  

Equipment - Apollo modules, rovers, and suits. The ISS, Mars rovers, Space shuttle, etc.

Mars - Mars as seen from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and from the various rovers.

Misc - Various moons, asteroids, etc. Including 3 GIF's.

Moon - The moon as seen from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the various Apollo missions.

Sun - 7 pictures of the sun.



These are all .JPG pictures so be careful if you resave them. If you do it too often the picture quality degrades and the 3D effect starts to look bad. Copy/paste is fine if you want to move them around.

Also, because of that, the previews will not look as good or as clear as the pics you will download.


Previews.
