[T],Hyperdrive25,2013-01-08T18:03Z,"@TWEETY2455: I have the latest antivirus on my computer. I always use ESET, which is the best antivirus in the world. I suggest you switch to  ESET SMART SECURITY 4/5/6. 

Download Eset 6RC or 5 RC from their website, download ESET Purefix (ESET5 PureFix Crack [HYPERDRIVE25].exe.torrent) and apply this fix in SAFE MODE.

Voila!
