Thanks and enjoy :)"
,burkaboy,2012-12-29T11:17Z,Will converter for PDF -> MSWord work?
,Heartofthorns,2012-12-29T16:51Z,"@ burkaboy
What converter are you talking about mate? This is simple Flash Player needed for playing flash videos/games etc."
,burkaboy,2012-12-30T13:11Z,I have Adobe Reader XI v. 11.0.0 installed and it has a menu for converting PDF documents to both MSWord and other formats. But all I am allowed to do is reading PDF's.
,burkaboy,2012-12-30T13:18Z,Reader is free but paid account required to use conversion.

What you are talking about is Adobe ""READER"". This torrent is Adobe ""FLASH PLAYER"". They are two completely different things mate.

If you want to edit your PDF files and save in other formats, get Adobe Acrobat Pro.  This is the adobe link  https://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro.html
For torrents of it see this link :
