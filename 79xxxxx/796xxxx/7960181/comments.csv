When you guys name folders in Cyrillic script nothing works until you rename it and if you have several like that you have them all with names like ""???? ??? ???? ???"" and ""?? ??? ????"" and it's hard to figure out which folder is which.

You had to name the file in English when you uploaded it... that should be a clue that you needed to name the folder in English, too.... or at least don't use Cyrillic script."
