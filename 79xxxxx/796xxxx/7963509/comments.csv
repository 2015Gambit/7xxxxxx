The category isn't LOSSLESS, meaning you can post m4a or APE or any lossless format you want.

It's a helluva lot easier for the uploader to convert their files to FLAC before uploading, than it is for hundreds of downloaders to do it later."

Frankly, I would like the categori to be just - lossless :-)"
