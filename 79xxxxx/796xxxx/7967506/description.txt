Book Description
The Oxford Handbook of Oncology is a practical guide to clinical consultation in oncology, covering the scientific basis as well as diagnosis, investigation, management and palliative care issues in cancer. Key information is provided in an easy-to-use format and each section is designed to give the reader sufficient background, understanding and vocabulary in the topic to allow further in-depth study. Diseases are dealt with systematically and the bulk of the text is dedicated to specific malignancies emphasising the more common malignancies. This pocket handbook will appeal to medical staff (both junior and senior) in oncology/palliative care and related disciplines which have a significant amount of malignant disease.
