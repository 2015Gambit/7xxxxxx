The world of Arx is wrought with turmoil, brought to the brink of destruction by a violent war. The sun has disappeared from overhead to shroud the world in eternal darkness forcing communities to begin inhabiting the underground mines. But as food and drink becomes scarce, the wars become even more violent as each race struggles for survival.
