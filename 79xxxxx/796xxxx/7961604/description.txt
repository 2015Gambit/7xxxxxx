Collects all 3 issues! The world of fairy tales is real, kept alive by the storytellers of old and the innocent belief of children. But when the original guardian of the fable realm turns from fairy godmother to wicked witch, fantasy land and all its inhabitants are transformed into deteriorating shadows of their former selves. With the last remaining Legendary Talespinners hunted and dying, all hope now rests in a young woman who locked away her fertile imagination long ago. Can even the forever fanciful stories of the legendary Baron Munchausen crack the defensive shell Abby has woven around herself in time to rescue the last surviving remnants of fantasy land?
