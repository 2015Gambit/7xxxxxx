According to Claude Albouze, Production Director of Merlin in France: ΓÇ£There will certainly be a Season 6 of Merlin, itΓÇÖs just a matter of negotiations because the first contract was signed for a period of five years and has to be renewed, he assures that both BBC and Shine absolutely want a Season 6 of Merlin, they want it desperately, they both want to continue the adventureΓÇ¥. They are just like us guys, they want a Season 6!

Summary:
--------
Merlin knows he must act fast before Morgana's twisted control over Gwen gets further out of hand. But only the most powerful magic can save the queen and this will not be easy, even for Merlin. As the high priestess tightens her grip on Camelot, one thing is clear - she will not give up her puppet without a fight.
