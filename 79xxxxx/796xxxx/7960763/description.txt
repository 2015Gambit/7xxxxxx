Note: Our previous releases of this game had a bug in our emulator,
potentially affecting savegames. It wasn't a problem until v1.03 broke it
We've updated the emulator so that future updates won't have any problems,
and added support for loading v1.01 and v1.02 saves which should work for
most people

Far Cry 3 returns the series to a tropical island setting, similar to the
first game and unlike the second game, which took place in an African
savanna setting. Players will assume the role of protagonist Jason Brody, a
tourist who has been stranded on an island chain in the grips of violent
local conflict for years

Jason has been separated from his girlfriend and, in his search for her, he
will have to deal with a wide cast of mostly unstable characters who have
been on these islands for some time
