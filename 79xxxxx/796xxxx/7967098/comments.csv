[H],EverybodyLies,2012-12-28T16:43Z,"How did you figure out that this is a fake??
The uploader has 6 pages of torrents. I think he is not going to upload fakes."
,glanza22104,2012-12-28T19:45Z,not fake its real deal
,BostonAl2012,2012-12-29T00:55Z,"Real, and a really good UL, same flicker and sound issues but they are less noticeable here~A/V 8.5/8.5 for a CAM and 600MBs! "
,wyattspoppa,2012-12-30T17:37Z,"It's not a fake my uneducated friends, it's an MKV file and you probably aren't using a player that can handle MKV files. (DIVX if you don't know)
It's a very nice cam, the video is good except for a flicker that's common, the problem with this is audio. It sounds like a single channel AM radio being listened to inside a small room with echos and static
V=7.5
A=4.0"
,geoffp,2013-01-10T14:47Z,V2.A1 Sounds like its filmed under 20 meters of water. The video is also dark and flickers. Pretty dreadful unless you're desperate to watch.
