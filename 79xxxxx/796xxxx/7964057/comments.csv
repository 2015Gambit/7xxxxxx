,Ren_Sprit,2012-12-28T00:49Z,thmax: Are there any English or Spanish subtitles?
,ScottyD7421,2012-12-28T13:24Z,"Appreciate the effort @thmax

Sorry but this is not a DVD Screener....it's a cam copy. The beginning is shaking and off centre like a cam and the audio is not very good. 

Audio language is Hindi and the English speaking actors are dubbed Hindi as well.

Finally, there is a web address plastered in the middle of the screen for the entire duration of the movie, and not superimposed like a Hollywood job, it's actually full blown white writing in a black square. 

V/5
A/3

Very poor copy.
