Animated film based on the wonderful children's picture book
written by Julia Donaldson and illustrated by Axel Scheffler.

A kind witch invites a surprising collection of animals to
join her on her broom, much to the frustration of her cat.
The gang ultimately saves the witch from a fearsome dragon
and in gratitude she rewards them with a magnificent new
broom which has room for everyone.

of the hugely successful The Gruffalo and The Gruffalo's Child.
