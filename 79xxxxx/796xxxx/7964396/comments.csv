,foegel,2012-12-28T01:40Z,cam sound or not?:O
,QborT,2012-12-28T02:14Z,BiDA got the audio from the Hive-CM8 rip.  Hive used studio audio and combined it with the Russian surround audio to create the 5.1.  Pretty dang fancy.
,tpbuser8,2012-12-28T03:37Z,Best audio so far!  Thanks!
,tpbuser8,2012-12-28T03:43Z,"Very good English sub here:

,LEXX911,2012-12-28T09:16Z,Video is playing nicely on the PC but trying to play it through both my media players on my tv it doesn't work.  One media player you can hear the audio but no picture the the other one just not playing it.
,moshster,2012-12-28T10:23Z,"Center channel volume is very low, almost drowned out by the other channels.  Great movie, I'd advise to wait for a proper to get the best audio."
,neon2579,2012-12-30T11:18Z,Same problem as LEXX911...
,dispo1,2013-01-03T14:53Z,"This torrent probably has the best quality video for the size, but the sound is completely fucked.  The idiot who's really proud of himself for making the surround sound mix out of the Russian audio completely fucked up.  You can hear an annoying echo of Russia voices in many random scenes.  That makes the sound fucked, morons!  Fix it!

This is the only one I found that has quality audio without the Russian echo, but the video quality of that one is shit, even though everyone in the comments are saying that it's good.  The vid actually flickers, it's so low resolution.  The vid quality of that one is worse than the YIFY release.  Is there a torrent with quality as good as this BIDA release, but with the same sound as that G3noc1d3 release?"
