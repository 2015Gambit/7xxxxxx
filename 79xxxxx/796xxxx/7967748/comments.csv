,Death_489,2012-12-30T10:51Z,"It doesn't work for me 

) I opened the download file (Mirrors Edge.dmg) 
) Copied both the game and the dlc to the desktop 
) started the game , it went to 800 x 600 and i saw the image of the game then a small white window with something like a loading icon , it looks like it freeze there for me , i wait but nothing happen and when i exit the game the desktop stays  800 x 600 so if i try to start the game again in 800 x 600 it doesn't work but when i scaled it to the original it start again with the same problem.. 

anyone made this game work ?..
