Problem Book In High School Mathematics 

edited by

A. I. Prilepko. 

The present problem book is meant for high-school students
who intend to enter technical colleges. I t contains more than
two thousand problems and examples covering all divisions
of high-school mathematics.

The main aim of the book is to help students to revise their
school knowledge of mathematics and develop a technique
in solving a variety of problems.

The book consists of nine chapters divided into sections,
each of which deals with a certain theme. The problems on
a definite theme are arranged in the order of increasing
difficulty, which makes it possible for a student to gradually
acquire the necessary techniques and experience in problem
solving. Thus, the problems are classified as far as possible.
Most of the problems were given at the entrance examinations
in various colleges to the USSR in recent years. All the
problems are supplied with answers, and some of them with
solutions or instructions. The words "Solution" and "Hint"
are replaced by the signs A and. respectively. The list of
designations makes the use of the book more convenient.
All the contributors to the book have a long experience
as lecturers at preparatory courses of colleges, as teachers
at high schools specializing in physics and mathematics and
as examiners in mathematics.

This book was translated from the Russian by I. A. Aleksanova. The
  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1985.
