While not great, this little flick isn't bad either. A pseudo-film noir about a private eye named Ray Malory who is hired to find out if someone's wife is being unfaithful, this film actually develops into a halfway decent mystery/detective plot for an erotic movie. Unfortunately, some sloppy and shoddy story telling, such as obvious clues (the postcard and the matchbooks in her room both have the same guy's name on them, yet the detective doesn't think they're a big deal), plot angles that don't add up (why does he ask Mrs. Sterling what JT stands for?), and cheap execution on some scenes (the thug in the jeep - how did he follow Malory?) gives the impression that this was another rushed project. Ether that, or else the writer could have given it another rewrite. The only other weakness to this film is the bad casting of some of the female roles. To be honest, a few of these girls where not that good looking, to put it lightly. Still, overall I have to say that this holds up well against any other erotic film playing on Skinemax.
