Young Molly Hale is a 5-year old girl who has lost her father to the Unown, a strange group of Pokemon who can make a person's dreams real by using their Psychic energy. One day she accidently releases the Unown, and they begin to answer Molly's wishes; first by creating Entei, a legendary lion-like Pokemon who Molly then thinks is her father because he always pretended to be Entei when he played with her. Molly then feels lonely because she has no mother, so Entei decides to kidnap Ash's mother and forces her to become Molly's. Ash, Brock, and Misty must then try to save Ash's mom, Delia, and Molly; And in the process they must also try to find a way to stop the Unown from turning the town of Greenfield into a bizarre crystal wasteland.
