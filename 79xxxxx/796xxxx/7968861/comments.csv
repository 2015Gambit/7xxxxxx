As for Shana, hmm ive had the blu rays for about 2weeks now but the english Dubs are so bad+ quality of the blu rays are horrible it makes me not want to even bother doing it."
,bigwhiteguy88,2012-12-30T10:07Z,Do you know of a program that'll convert these so they can be burned to dvd? Or at least a mp4?
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-30T10:39Z,yeah im really looking forward for most of the shows stated on your like moose especially bodasius space pirates.Ive seen the trailer it was so so
,mooserocka,2012-12-30T20:45Z,shana wasnt THAT bad i liked the audio. I honestly could not tell the differance from regular or blu ray though. It would me much apreciated i seen the first season a WHILE ago but the new one is good people said. 
,mooserocka,2012-12-31T05:49Z,Just seen more trailers for kamisama dolls. Its NOTHING what the title seems. It looks dark and wild and crazy. Looks so good i seen a couple amv's for it and looked so good.

[V],Daman4Iife,2013-01-07T03:46Z,chris the subtitles are fine.
