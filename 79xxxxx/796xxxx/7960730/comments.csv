[V],bestec1234,2012-12-27T20:17Z,"Sorry... that sounded negative ...

I'd be glad to do your requests ... Just be sure to send future ones to Suprbay. :)

I DO read comments, and I DO appreciate them.  I just don't always get to the requests in torrent comments, for whatever reason.

Sometimes I read requests in comments, and to me, it seems like people just want to say, ""Give me more!"" rather than say thank you, but I know that's not what people mean.  Just seems that way sometimes. :D"
