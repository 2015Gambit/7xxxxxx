,groundbeef,2012-12-27T13:22Z,You have to be the biggest douche bag. Go to school and learn something about a computer before you blow your shit up! I got 3 year old nephews who could upload on piratebay. Idiot.
,groundbeef,2012-12-27T13:27Z,How many freakin times are you planning to upload this shit? Are you having fun fucking around? It's a good fucking thing you don't do brain surgery...you'd kill the first 70 patients.
,groundbeef,2012-12-27T13:31Z,"Hey Achmed, stick to riding camels and fucking sheep!"
,14impala,2012-12-27T14:21Z,"well you have to know this file was made after several tests, i was considering how big each piece should be to make torrent file last as long as possible while not sacrificing downloading speed... "
,groundbeef,2012-12-27T14:45Z,"and so far this thing has been uploaded 6 times in 3 days. Here is some rope, find yourself a good overhead tree limb that will support your weight, and have fun danglin. You have officially become fucktard #1 at PB. Maybe when your toes go numb you'll figure out exactly what damn filesize and filespeed you feel is necessary to share this 533 MB file. If you feel that I am being harsh it is because I have pressed ""download torrent"" 10 fucking times now and my finger is starting to grow annoyed. But like a complete shmuck I keep thinking that this bozo who keeps uploading will eventually figure out what the letters and buttons on his pretty little keyboard actually do. Then when I see everyone stuck at 2.6 goddam percent I realize, again, how stupid I was for falling for it yet another time."
,14impala,2012-12-27T15:27Z,"i have uploaded this 7 times indeed, only one file was deleted on my disk accidentally. rest 4 were somehow deleted by TPB for no reason ( then i checked up and i think it's normal, sometimes ). all 5 torrent are seeding properly right now, and first 100 users should have downloaded them successfully already ( which i saw on my uTorrent panel )  

the one stuck at 2.6% is the one i accidentally deleted, rest are seeding and if you are patient enough you will get the game ( if you dont delete the first one you were downloading it should be right in your computer already ) 

and im seeding few more old video games and some modified games, namely the FlatOut 1 with cockpit view added, and very scarce F1 1995 "
,groundbeef,2012-12-27T15:46Z,"Are you smoking drugs? You checked up and files were deleted and it is normal sometimes? Huh? The first 100 users have downloaded what file? Because I think there are 3452356234645 leeching at 3.5% on this one here. The one stuck at 2.6 you deleted? So which fucking file should I download? When you get your shit all in order and make a little sense then maybe you could attempt to reupload...until then you probably shouldn't do anything that might get you hurt...like thinking, breathing, talking...etc. "
,14impala,2012-12-27T16:28Z,"oh the one at 3.5% are proceeding to 3.7% now and it's seeding as it should. 

the one stuck at 2.6% is surely dead i think, thats the one i accidentally deleted. 

and somehow TPB is really acting up dead torrent file cannot be deleted by user manually, clicking on the red cross just doesnt work.  and it's normal to see torrent file deleted for no reason, if you just check up "
,14impala,2012-12-27T16:35Z,"first 100 users should have obtained V rally 2 from few previous torrent files already , i never delete those files on my laptop thus they can still get the file 

the one at 3.5% is proceeding to 3.7% right now and it's seeding as it should 

the one stuck at 2.7% was accidentally deleted earlier as i mentioned.

,groundbeef,2012-12-27T16:58Z,What the FUCK??? Do you have this uploading at 1 kilobyte an hour or some shit? Is this torrent some kind of sick joke? Dude...WHAT THE FUCK??????? Is there someone sitting next to you that can slap the every-loving shit out of you? It's been how freakin long and its only at 3.7? Is this some kind of patience test for PS users? 
,groundbeef,2012-12-27T17:12Z,"What the fuck did you do 3 days ago? Decide how you could be the biggest asshair on PB? ""Duh, I think i'll post a torrent 20 times and upload it at .3kb/s."" Did you have some dope in your Cheerios? This was amusing for a little while but I am not wasting any more time waiting for you to abandon this share next month before it finishes. I can see it too...your ass sitting in your computer chair waiting to click on ""exit utorrent"" after everybody climbed to 98.6 percent or some shit. Then you will be brave and stupid enough to reupload it again with a different file size or different compression extension. The fun with this is done."
,14impala,2012-12-27T17:18Z,"2.3kb/s on average, for the current torrent file. 
4.0% now XD 
"
,14impala,2012-12-27T17:39Z,"im not  that kind of people. if you want to know why, read what i wrote in readme file ( which includes in the game ) "
,14impala,2012-12-27T17:48Z,"and i will not shut down u Torrent till someone has obtained the full file, i just want to keep it alive. "
,Anroid869,2012-12-28T01:55Z,"You're a very retarded person, just go away, we dont need you at PB!"
,groundbeef,2012-12-28T04:07Z,Don't worry...he'll upload it again 4 more times tomorrow...
,14impala,2012-12-28T10:42Z,TPB somehow deleted my earlier torrent and thats not my fault. i just reupload it to keep it here

,14impala,2012-12-28T13:34Z,hey everyone! i know this file hasnt completed seeding for the first time yet but i have to go off for a trip in the next two days thus the seeding will be queued for two days and after that seeding will be resumed.
