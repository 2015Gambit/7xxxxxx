 Fun is what happens when three extraordinarily talented musicians come together to create something altogether new and wonderful. Nate Ruess, late of The Format, has teamed up with ex-Anathallo multi-instrumentalist Andrew Dost and Steel TrainΓÇÖs Jack Antonoff, resulting in their ingenious debut, Aim And Ignite. The trio melds a stunning array of diverse inspirations ΓÇô spanning Broadway to The Beach Boys, Nilsson Shmilsson to Pinkerton ΓÇô into an irresistible collection of freewheeling Pop songcraft. Fun have crafted something special indeed, a contemporary rethinking of classic ΓÇÖ70s pop, where ornate arrangements and inspired orchestrations meet present-day Rock ΓÇÿnΓÇÖ Roll.
