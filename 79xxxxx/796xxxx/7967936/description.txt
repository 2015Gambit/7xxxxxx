This is Brandon Levon's amazing book New World Bible - The Story of the Truth (2009) which attempts to reveal our true history by combining ancient stories from around the world with the Key of Life and the forbidden calendar system of the past. Covering a time span of 26,000 years, it long predates the information of the bible and it is the representation of one cycle of the earth - the beginning and ending of time as the ancients understood it and how it was encoded in the astrological circle. New World Bible provides an alternative historical account not only for the current generation but for generations to come. 210 pages. A must read for everyone.
