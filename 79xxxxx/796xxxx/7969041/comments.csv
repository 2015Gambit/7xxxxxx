Because of the release of the Full Version of Diablo 3 on May 15th. I will no longer be updating Mooege compiles or be supporting the D3 Beta.I hope everyone enjoyed Mooege and at least got a glimpse of the Diablo 3 Beta even though it wasn't 100% complete.
Thanks to everyone for support, feedback, bugs, and above all, thanks to the talented Mooege Developers!

In the months ahead Mooege may support the full version of Diablo 3. Time will only tell

It hasn't been updated or worked on at all since release.   

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR HARDDRIVE SPACE GUYS.   lol"
