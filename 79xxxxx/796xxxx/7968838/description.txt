With over 3.5 billion cell phone users around the world, thousands of cell phone towers popping up in people's neighborhoods, children's schools and neighbor's rooftops, people are starting to feel the effects. Full Signal talks to scientists, lawmakers, lawyers and everyday people to investigate the truths and myths behind the impact of cellular technology.
