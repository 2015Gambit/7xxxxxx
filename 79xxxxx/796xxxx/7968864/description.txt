This torrent contains "Pokemon Snake Wood"

Use an emulator(Visual Boy Advance) to play it. Link below.

This ROM is a hack of "Pokemon Ruby" where Hoenn has been invaded by an army of zombies.

Features:
-New scripts, new overworlds, new sprites - the usual
-Exciting new areas, such as the hidden Meathouse, the maddening Island of Calm and the unexpected Hoenn University of Film
-Several zombie versions of normal Pokémon, two of which are capturable
-6 Denjuu
-An indeterminate number of Fakemon (somewhere between 40 and 50), including a good number of hidden evolutions to existing Pokémon
-New legendaries, some of which are very, very evil
-7 Sinnoh Pokémon
-5 Isshu (or Unova, depending on how much you care) Pokémon
-Most Gyms have now been destroyed by zombies, and hence Badges are come by in somewhat unusual ways
-A few type changes for Pokémon here and there.
-A surprising pet shop run by a certain Count
-A host of deceitful characters who will do anything to lie to you
-An unusual and somewhat wandering storyline
-An enormous number of references to books, films, manga, other hacks and other such things
-A somewhat darker plot than usual
-A slightly increased difficulty level
