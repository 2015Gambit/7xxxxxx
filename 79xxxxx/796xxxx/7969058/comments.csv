V/9
A/9

I would've given 10/10 but the movie seemed to stutter slightly the whole way through. It was like taking a step then pausing a millisecond before taking the next. Its a little hard to explain and it is quite possible that it is my PC (i did try it on several media players) so i'd be interested in someone else's opinion on quality. All in all, especially if it is my PC, i'd recommend downloading.
