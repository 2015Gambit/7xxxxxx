[T],dhjudasx,2012-12-28T20:35Z,"I'm not entirely sure what you mean alcinodias...

Suggestions on what more information you may want/need/like to have?

I'm willing to put a little more info in the discription if it'll help, within reason. ;)"
,maxwellsm,2012-12-29T00:22Z,"Another great trilogy, thanks again!"

,jalucian,2012-12-31T18:34Z,"Top of the line work, as always Judas! I wish YIFY would follow your lead and use higher bitrates (I assume yours are higher since he is notorious for never listing his) and offer both stereo and 5.1 audio tracks like you do. Given the size:quality ratio I consider your encodes the best I've found so far (FASM comes close but no cigar.) My only wish would have been for you to have done Avengers before this trilogy - it would have been awesome for New Years Eve. Who knows, maybe you'll surprise us and post it today. :)  Thanks a million Judas!"
[T],dhjudasx,2012-12-31T22:28Z,"ah yes.... avengers... I wanted to get the movies that  come prior to avengers up... I still have to get the incredible hulk up...

as much as I plan to upload.... delays in getting other seeders to help seed and my limited upload rate tends to really hamper things.

appreciate the comments overall though... thanks ;)"
