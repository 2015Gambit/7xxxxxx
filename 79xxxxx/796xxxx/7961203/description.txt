Mostly Harmless is a novel by Douglas Adams and the fifth book in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy trilogy. It is described on the cover of the first editions as "The fifth book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhikers Trilogy". It was the last Hitchhiker's book written by Adams.

I put this together because I am a huge fan of Douglas Adams and the Hitchhikers "trilogy" but I could never find a propper rip of these audiobooks. Sure, there's plenty of rips in shitty, lossy mp3, but who the fuck wants that? FLAC gives you full loseless audio, and when you have audio books which are narrated by Stephen Fry and Martin Freeman, why would you want anything else?
So I bought all 5 audiobooks on cd, ripped each disc using Exact Audio Copy, logs and scans are included. Enjoy!

All I ask in return is that you #KeepSeeding!
