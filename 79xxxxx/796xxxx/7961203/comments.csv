,Apt411,2012-12-28T18:42Z,"Thanks so much for this wonderful upload.  Incidentally, this torrent proves that very few quality audiobooks/movies are pirated (few seeds).  Most TPB content involves shitty Hollyood pdxns or porn.  So what is all the fuss about?  "
,piratebuddha,2012-12-29T02:18Z,"@Apt411 Glad you like it :)

And I agree with you. I got sick and tired of trying to find these audiobooks in FLAC/lossless quality, which I would have paid for happily. All the places that sell audiobooks had this in shitty, lossy mp3, so I managed to find the set, and put this together because I knew there were other people out there who want these in CD quality."
,piratebuddha,2012-12-29T02:22Z,"And if these CD's were easy to find then I probably wouldn't have put them up for download, because I believe they are definitely worth paying for, but since the CD's are almost out of print (took me months to get the set) and the only option is shitty mp3 quality, I figured this had to be done :)"
,Nick1472,2012-12-29T23:03Z,"Awesome..
I am so glad I know where my towel is.
One question tho...
Martin Freeman and Stephen Fry are nice but do you know if there are any torrents out there in good quality where Douglas actually narrates it ?
I have some ""shitty"" quality ones with him..would be nice to have them in flac.
Dont know why but they way he reads it is just awesome.
Still..great work and many thanks.
Keep up the great uploads :D"
,Nick1472,2012-12-29T23:21Z,"Thank you for those awesome DNA torrents.
One question tho..
Do you know if there are sources available with DNA narrating the books ?
I just really love his style and tone of voice.
Don't get me wrong...Stephen Fry and Martin Freeman are awesome too.
Anyways..thanks..keep up those awesome uploads."
,Nick1472,2012-12-29T23:22Z,Heh sorry for the double post. My tablet is being a pain in the rear.
,piratebuddha,2012-12-30T21:17Z,"@Nick1472 No need to apologize ;)

I have never seen the version where Adams narrates in FLAC, or a loseless format. I've only ever seen it in very low quality, which is understandable because those versions are quite old, but I'll have to do some searching because that would be an awesome find!"
