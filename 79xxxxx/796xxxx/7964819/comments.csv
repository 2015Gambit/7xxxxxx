,oldiesguy,2012-12-28T16:50Z,"Hi JMZ,

Thanks for all the uploads.

There's a problem with this set - it's a mess. Most
of the songs have been folded to mono and the
sound is muffled. What were they thinking?

,oldiesguy,2012-12-28T20:01Z,"All the cuts are muffled except 108, 116,302, & 311.

It sounds like they took stereo songs and folded
them to mono - which causes problems. In this
case, the vocals are down in the mix and the
songs are distorted and muffled.  At first I thought
it was the torrent, but the above songs are fine.
Beats me what happened.  Do the original cd's
sound OK? Are they stereo?
