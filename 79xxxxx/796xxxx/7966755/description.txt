Solving Problems in Geometry 

by

V. Gusev, V. Litvinenko, A. Mordkovich. 

This book is intended for students at pedagogical (teacher training)
institutes majoring in mathematics or in mathematics and physics. It
has been written in correspondence with the current syllabus "Solving
Problems".

When preparing the text, we wanted to represent the main types of
problems in geometry found at school. The book contains about 1000
problems that should be solved independently. Alongside rather simple
problems, there are problems whose solution requires profound
meditation and sometimes even a nonstandard approach. The solution of
moat of the problems in this book will help the student form the
professional habits important for a future teacher of mathematics,
that is, to know how to solve the geometrical problems covered by the
mathematics syllabus for high schools and vocational schools.

This book was translated from the Russian by Leonid Levant. The book
was published by first Mir Publishers in 1988.
