A Hundred Swords, A Thousand Battles!

Real time strategy reaches new heights in this medieval masterpiece
where stunning 3D characters battle it out with a myriad of weapons.

The world of Hundred Swords is divided into four warring factions, 
each united under a different leader. Every group has their own unique 
look, as well as their own special units and military advantages. King 
Naravale commands strong cavalry troops, while Queen Gran's followers 
have the advantage of greater magical ability. Prince Mascar, who 
leads a skilled infantry force, and General Ruplustorie, who 
specializes in ranged combat, rounds out the main cast. 

To get ahead in Hundred Swords you must gather resources and use them 
to build structures and create your own armies! You can also build 
vehicles such as golems and airships. 

100 Swords offers a progression system for your Leaders. Winning each 
battle, you'll be rewarded with Shells which add swords and armor. 
These can be used during battle to increase your attack or defensive 
capabilities! Shells can also be handy in the Network games to add a 
challenging dimension to the game.
