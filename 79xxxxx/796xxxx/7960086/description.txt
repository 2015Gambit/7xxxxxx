??? Jim Davis as the bad guy and Van Cleef as is number 1 guy ??
Actual movie plot i guess comes down to Davis trying to seize and make everyone
move off the land he stole from the original land grant holder. 

User Review

After making The Badge of Marshal Brennan earlier in the year, Jim Davis once again teamed with producer/director Albert C. Gannaway and co-stars Arleen Whelan, Marty Robbins, Lee Van Cleef, Louis Jean Heydt, Harry Lauter, and Douglas Fowley, among others, for this one. Here, he's Captain Angus McKane who, after the Mexican war, takes the land that once belonged to his enemies by force and threatens to shoot anyone who dares to challenge him for it. I admit to being partly confused by some sequence of events but a flashback near the end explains nearly everything to my satisfaction. I also noticed one sequence involving fighting Indians that seemed the same one from the other picture I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Probably was done that way for budget purposes but it didn't ruin my enjoyment of this one. Really, there's good action and compelling drama throughout. So on that note, Raiders of Old California is recommended.
