How to use the BioSentinel Lockscreen:

*SECRET* 
The app will not grant access until you touch the secret spot on the screen.  To unlock the device, tap one of the top corners of the screen before scanning your biometric pattern.


DISCLAIMER:

This app was designed for entertainment purposes only and cannot guarantee the security of your phone. Your device is not technically capable of actually reading your fingerprint, or scanning  your biometric signature.

Unfortunately this app cannot be set as the actual lock screen due to limitations in the current SDK.  However, as a workaround you can always turn off the pasword for the lockscreen and run the program when you leave the device unattended.  We will continue to update this app and will hopefully be able to make it a true lockscreen in the future.
