I hope you don't mind my posting this here, but I noticed you as the UL...

I just wanted you to know that I am having to re-encode your lovely 'LET SLEEPING CORPSES LIE' because AND I FOUND OUT THE REASON....!!!  You are using level 5.1 as the version and you are using 9 reference frames.

Now, I don't mean to be unappreciative of all your hard work, but PLEASE, all of us out here who want to play movies on stand alone Blu-ray players CANNOT do so with the way you encode it.

May I PLEASE humbly just make a suggestion that you just set the version to 4.1 and use 4 reference frames and then all the REST of us will be able to enjoy your EXCELLENT uploads!

I TRULY appreciate it if you could do that; I REALLY hate not being able to play ANY of your posts.  Just so you know, almost EVERYONE else here who is very good (BOZX, AOLOFFLINE, DOWNTU, etc.)  deliberately use these lower number formats so that we ALL can play them.

Thank you so much in advance!!!"
