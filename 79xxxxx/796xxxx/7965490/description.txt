This is a compilation disc of the years 1975 - 1978 when Gong were playing jazz fusion. The tunes come from Shamal (4 cuts), Gazeuse! (3 cuts), and Expresso II (4 cuts). What made Gong's style of fusion stand out for me was the use of vibes, which is not the norm. It added a color and timbre to the music that made it sound open, warm and unique.This is an excellent compilation.
