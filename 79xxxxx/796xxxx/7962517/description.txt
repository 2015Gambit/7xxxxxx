Book Description
Thoroughly revised with a wide range of new topics, presentations, and a new layout to aid quick reference, the new edition of this bestselling Oxford Handbook serves as an accessible pocket reference for junior surgical trainees, medical students, nursing, paramedical and rehabilitation staff. It covers the assessment and preparation of the patient, anaesthesia and critical care, inflammation, wound healing and infection, and the key components of general surgical practice as well as chapters on other surgical specialties, including plastic, paediatric and orthopaedic surgery. There are step by step descriptions of common operative surgical techniques, practical hints and procedures, and information on signs, symptoms and rarities. Emergency presentations are clearly identified for rapid reference and investigations and management plans are set out in a clear and easy to follow way. Surgically relevant anatomy and physiology is provided for each area, quick reference symbols ensure the reader is guided to key facts and there is an increased focus on evidence-based practice throughout. A cut above the rest, this is the essential guide to clinical surgery and the surgical specialities.
