,konfuzedtorrent,2012-12-29T19:22Z,"So far uploaded 29gigs. Ill keep it going for a few more days.

@partyhardy247-All you'll need is a 3d tv with glasses. No nvidia required. When playing the video just switch the tv to Side-by-Side mode and you should Good to Go. "

,pjones452,2012-12-30T07:05Z,If you plug it straight into the tv sometimes it wont play the audio so Nvidia is the best way to go.

,chr0m312,2012-12-31T16:01Z,As I saw from screenshots there were black bars so can anyone tell me if they will be shown on tv/pc too?
,dragodami,2012-12-31T17:45Z,"Hello everyone!
I need some help!Can someone tell me a free media player which can open a 3d movie (this one for example)?I don`t have red-blue 3d glasses, I have some other sort of glasses so the RED-BLUE 3d won`t work for me."
,chr0me12,2013-01-01T18:59Z,"As I saw from screenshots well there were black bars, they will be shown on tv/pc too?"
,djnforce9,2013-01-01T19:30Z,"This movie is absolutely fantastic and the 3D Effects are used extremely well (especially when the slow-mo drugs are shown off).

@partyhardy247:
You need a 3DTV or player that supports ""side-by-side"" frames. I believe all standalone 3DTV's can do it and for computer solutions, there is the ""Stereoscopic Player"" (which also has an analgyph mode if you lack a 3DTV/Monitor)."
,invalidloser,2013-01-10T06:56Z,"you can watch these SBS movies with stereoscopic player, choose the options sbs (left or right Your choice) choose your aspect ratio start movie, it will start in the red/blue mode but on the player bar (near play,pause, etc) you will see an EYE looking icon HIT THAT! problem solved no glasses or 3d tv enjoy :)"
