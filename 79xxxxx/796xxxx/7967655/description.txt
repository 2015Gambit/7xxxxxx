The movie is missing some bits at the start and some (or quite a lot) bits in the ends





This torrent should be reported because it is utter pure bullshit quality wise, hope it sends a message to tpb admins that the high res movie section SHOULD have quality standards... quality standards that are something along these lines:

Must be bluray source or equivalent 
Must be half or full hd
Must have respectable bit rate
Must have surround sound
Must not be cropped or miss parts of the movie


Having a video width of 1280 should NOT be the only criteria to be able to put up something in the high res movie section for obvious reasons, if you dont get the obvious reasons then I urge you to download my "amazing HD version" of The Hobbit
