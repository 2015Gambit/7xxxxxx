,sugarpuffextreme,2012-12-28T22:07Z,"likewise.

Do you have any idea how boring and tiring it was to hold the camera and film my tv for 10 minutes?

You should be grateful ^__^"

,.Leto.,2012-12-29T05:23Z,"I totally agree with what sugarpuffextreme said in his torrent description. Too much crap being posted in the High-Res category. And it's being posted by uploaders with a skull! 
800MB BluRay rips, shitty ""high-res"" cams don't have anything to do here."
,denoorman,2012-12-29T06:44Z,"sugarpuffextreme, way to go, super!!!"
,zanozikk,2012-12-29T08:12Z,Nice! DOWNLOAD AND SEED! :))) LOL
,BigBrassPair,2012-12-29T17:57Z,I love it! look at all the seeders and leechers.....they obviously dont bother to read the info given.
,.Leto.,2012-12-29T20:11Z,@BigBrassPair: you don't even need to read the info to know this isn't the real stuff. 237MB for a 720p 3 hours long movie? Can you imagine how stupid you have to be to download this?
,ChasUGC,2012-12-30T04:43Z,"I disagree. This guy is the idiot. Let this guy go to a movie theatre and present a good copy of this movie. He is just another whiner. The people who go to the movie theatres and risk jail time to present this movie to us for free are the real hero's. And then the uploaders who spend hours trying to clean these things up for us, again for free. These people are the hero's."
,ScottyD7421,2012-12-30T09:36Z,"Nice way to get your point across. 

If you're one of those like myself who hate uploaders not putting in enough information, and you still download this then more fool you. Info says it all.

LOL Funny as hell"
,Yamcha67,2012-12-30T17:55Z,"Alright I'm never one to complain about quality, but this is ridiculous, first of all this belongs in the movie clips section as It's 5 minutes in length. Second the title is misleading, and the description is confusing.

Your description is telling us that this torrent should be reported, I'm not entirely sure If you added that, or It was added by an administrator.

Third, what is the point of this upload? I understand there are people who risk and work hard to get us upload's even though they are low quality, and I have no problem with that.

But this is 5 minutes in length, I really don't understand why you bothered. There is way more footage on the behind the scenes video and trailer's that are available on youtube at 1080P..

And AGAIN, this is listed in the wrong section, your passing off a 5 minute video as a Movie?"
,wyattspoppa,2012-12-30T18:33Z,"Those of you defending this dipstick are nearly as moroinic as he is. First, there are noobs to torrnting every day who wouldn't know an mb (not MiB Zippy) from a bagel, so they aren't ""stupid"" for DL'ing. We all got hustled by Hollywood with $25 DVD's and $12 flicks which is why we exist, we don't need idiots like sugarpuff destroying trust in the torrenting community."
,sugarpuffextreme,2012-12-31T00:04Z,"hey dumwits, this is not about complaining about movie rips of bad quality due to being early cams. I respect those.

however, passing them out as a high res movie by posting in said section I do not accept.

They should have their owns section.

Also, by todays tpb definition this is de facto a movie and not a clip due to the simple fact that it is above 200mb which apparently is the only criteria to different movie from clip... which also needs to change obviously."
,ChasUGC,2012-12-31T06:08Z,"@sugarpuffextreme- you still sound like a whinner, uploading crap and wasting space to make what point?

That TPB should do things your way, to make your life easier when you get these movies for free anyway. 

To lazy to even read?

How about going to a movie theatre and give us a copy that meets your standards. Show us how its done.

NO! Instead you whine and waste space with your rant, and useless download. Get a grip."
,sugarpuffextreme,2012-12-31T07:13Z,"Yes tpb should have proper sections to make things easy for me.

I cant film a movie in the theater that meets standards that is associated with the ""high res movie"" section.

I dont see any reason why I should or where I have claimed cams should have such standard.

Are you illiterate or retarded or both?"
,.Leto.,2012-12-31T16:33Z,"example of what we're talking about: yesterday a 800MB DVD screener of Skyfall was released. Guess what was posted in High-Res movies a few hours ago? A 720p upscale of that screener...

,TWEETY2455,2013-01-01T16:50Z,"L@L love it,this mtf sure was JerkingOFF on the hobbits *_*,and he forgot to keep filming."
,.Leto.,2013-01-01T19:59Z,"lol, this is hilarious, this torrent is like an IQ test. Amazing how many idiots can't understand basic English. And can't realize that 237MB for this movie is totally impossible."
,superdavee,2013-01-01T20:41Z,i laughed i cryed...nicely done
,jesusshockwave,2013-01-07T03:25Z,Hairy hobbits lol
