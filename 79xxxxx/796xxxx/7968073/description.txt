The medieval alchemists made elements react to create magnificent shows, 
enthralling kings and commoners alike, but their secrets were never revealed 
until now. 

In the first of this year's Christmas Lectures, Dr Peter Wothers explores what 
the alchemists knew about the air we breathe and reveals how our modern 
knowledge of these elements can be used to control fire, defy gravity and 
harness the power of a lightning storm. Peter is joined by the cast of the 
musical Loserville and is helped in his exploration of the 118 modern elements 
by a periodic table made from audience members at the Royal Institution.
