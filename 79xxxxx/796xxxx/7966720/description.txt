Hi,

There is a big difference between `Best` and `I-like-the-most`. Here are 91 tracks that are both. selected from about 30.000 Indie tracks I heard this year (2012).

100% clean and labeled. Rearranged according to sound quality and rhythm (so you can play it in one go publicly).

You probably like them too......Enjoy
