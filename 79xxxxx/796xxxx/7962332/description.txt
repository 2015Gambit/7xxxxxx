 Note: Our previous releases of this game had a bug in our emulator,
 potentially affecting savegames. It wasn't a problem until v1.03 broke it.
 We've updated the emulator so that future updates won't have any problems,
 and added support for loading v1.01 and v1.02 saves which should work for
 most people.
 
 Check the included .txt for the long list of updates on this one!

 Far Cry 3 returns the series to a tropical island setting, similar to the
 first game and unlike the second game, which took place in an African
 savanna setting. Players will assume the role of protagonist Jason Brody, a
 tourist who has been stranded on an island chain in the grips of violent
 local conflict for years.
 
 Jason has been separated from his girlfriend and, in his search for her, he
 will have to deal with a wide cast of mostly unstable characters who have
 been on these islands for some time..
