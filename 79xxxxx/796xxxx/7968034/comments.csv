,cutsickass1,2012-12-29T00:36Z,Note: The Sample is XviD.
,Pakosan,2012-12-29T01:04Z,thnx
,ForbiddenSoul,2012-12-29T02:11Z,"H.264 (x264) is what XVid is based on, and in my opinion a much better encoder. Only difference is XVid is free to use, and H264 is copyrighted by SOMEONE, and there is the possibility you could incur huge usage fees. I would much rather these uploads be encoded with H.264, and I don't think the uploaders are very concerned with copyrights....

Wouldn't worry about mislabeled uploads just so long as they are in the higher quality H.264"

thanks"
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-29T05:48Z,"@ForbiddenSoul: You are clueless. Xvid is not based on h264. Xvid is an MPEG-4 codec. 

In any event, there is now a V2 version of this, with the ""fog"" look ""corrected"", but I believe this movie was filmed that way. "
,beechyboy,2012-12-29T15:02Z,"Yes that's right.

Tweaked video to remove that ""fog"" look, came out nice
added abit of sharpness, and tweaked brightness/contrast
alittle along with other things Enjoy a much better rip
