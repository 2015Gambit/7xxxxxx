,t3rdman,2012-12-28T02:41Z,huge almost in the middle of the screen. i'll pass. would be nice if that was in the notes
,t3rdman,2012-12-28T02:44Z,huge blurry section near the middle of the screen 
,tpg6950,2012-12-28T03:14Z,sound dont work
,Jenson100,2012-12-28T03:37Z,The blur was marking out the productions companys name or whatever.Not bad for free :p
,Hemude,2012-12-28T03:43Z,"@t3rdman: The blurred rectangle is common with screeners (and it's nowhere near ""huge""). It may not have been mentioned in the notes, but it's very clearly in the provided screenshots.

+1 for HeroMaster. This movie doesn't look like it's worth $30+ at the theater, but this copy is great - and free. Thanks, HeroMaster."
,ba567,2012-12-28T03:44Z,this is a work print not a screener
,Hulk62468,2012-12-28T03:47Z,AH their is a blur in the middle of the picture... If any of you took the 10 seconds to look at the screens you would know that. Thanks HM! Funny ass movie
,BoyRatty,2012-12-28T04:54Z,"HM, top flight...  first class."
,gezina,2012-12-28T05:38Z,"@ba567 work print or screener and @ all the other haters, who really gives a flying fuck if theres a blurry patch at the bottom of the screen as is with any screener! this is free ffs what dont you get? cant you appreciate what the uploaders do to get these to us? get a life you sad fucks or go pay to watch at the theatre. nothing good to say... then keep your mouths shut.

heromaster thanks again for a great up, will seed for a while. much kudos man."

Both picture and audio are very good and as for the ""huge"" blurry part in the middle of the screen, LOL it's actually pretty small and a good job of removing the superimposed text. It hardly detracts from the movie at all.

Good job M8

Thanks HeroMaster. and i've watched it all no audio or any other problems. if you have issues it's probabaly because your using some exotic media player called Zumba nakk tukk or some shit like that. use vlc or MPC "

,umin3,2012-12-28T19:08Z,no sound?  please help
,thathrills,2012-12-28T19:39Z,"Thats strange, I'm playing it on a quicktime player like i do all my AVI files and at 1:18:36 it ends file. 
I also downloaded the other available torrent and the exact same issue. "
,piizda,2012-12-28T20:01Z,"HeroMaster 
There is a blured label almost in the middle of the screen, cant see a shit in that place. all movie long!!!!"
,ATR215,2012-12-28T20:11Z,There is a whole hr missing in this movie.
,steaz55,2012-12-28T21:05Z,ATR215 is a liar. This is the whole movie. 2 hr 11 min of it. Not worth the money seeing it at the theaters though. 
,CarlZeiss,2012-12-28T21:19Z,@JarJar - I have NEVER had any problems with my  Zumba nakk tukk media player.  It's actually better than VLC.
,dahydeout,2012-12-28T23:17Z,Could you PLEASE upload the Les Miserables screener too? 
,krikri3,2012-12-28T23:30Z,DO NOT POST PROBLEMS UNLESS IT HAPPENS ON VLC. GET IT AT videolan.org

,Edwin14,2012-12-29T00:25Z,the video quality is great i dont mind the blurry square anyone know whats going on with the audio?
,CarlZeiss,2012-12-29T00:27Z,@tpg6950 Are you using VLC?
,zakimar5,2012-12-29T02:13Z,"Thanks! Great for what I paid (free), not worth admission to a theater though."
,sherriff89,2012-12-29T02:55Z,"To the people saying theres no audio - Why even say that if your not even going to mention what third world player your using? My suggestion is to be a man, spend like 3mb of bandwidth and use VLC, or actually give some information as to what your using/doing instead of just saying ""Its not working, help"" - Just my two cents worth."

M - I think it sums up extremely perfect whats wrong with 40 year old women (oh yes, she is 40), however it's not very pleasant or entertaining as a 30 year old man to watch. It's just depressing, annoying and makes you semi suicidal. "
,smitty007,2012-12-30T07:58Z,I'm using Utorrent and when a torrent completes its download it automatically removes itself off the list so I can't seed. It used to just stay there until I remove it. How do I change it so it stays?
