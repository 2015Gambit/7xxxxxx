Flight Club

Technology Documentary hosted by James May, published by BBC in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

In this epic Toy Stories Christmas special, James gets to the heart of the nation's childhood love affair with the model plane and sets out to achieve what seems an impossible dream: the first cross-channel flight ever achieved by an engineless, homemade supersized toy. If it survives the perilous 22 mile journey, James's classic toy glider, lovingly built from over 1,000 pieces of balsa, will smash the British distance record.

James's mission is dedicated to making the dream of flight come true for the generations of children who, like James himself, slaved for hours over balsa and glue only to see their fragile and much loved planes smash tragically on to the unyielding concrete of reality.
