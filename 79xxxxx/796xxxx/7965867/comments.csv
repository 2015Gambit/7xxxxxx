,marick626,2012-12-29T07:23Z,"for some reason, when I choose the aircraft it causes FSX to crash. I have looked for solutions but nothing helps. I am curious if anyone has this problem and could provide a solution. "
,gr82bagator,2012-12-29T19:47Z,I get the same problem Marick. I have used an older version of this software in the past (it is a great addon) and didn't have any issues. Maybe try an older version and see if it works for you.
