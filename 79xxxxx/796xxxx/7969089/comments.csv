,jaxx1rr,2012-12-29T18:29Z,Seed after you downloaded and tell me if you got it to work..
,F3NR1Z,2012-12-31T12:00Z,"i got bad cd key at the start of the game and running options.cmd didn't help. I manually typed new keys in registry.reg. The game is working now, but whenever I want to join my own server it says bad cd key. I blocked port 29910 in windows firewall, AVG firewall and even on my router. And i tried more than 10 cd keys. Still says bad cd key"
,irekslayer,2012-12-31T14:38Z,"""bad cd-key given in setup"" did as u wrote, tried also cd-keys from that option.cmd but didnt help either. Made me sad :("
,jaxx1rr,2013-01-01T07:47Z,dude use options bat to put key in.. the key is the second thing in the keygen not the first u need to put for arma 2 and armored operations.. read desc pls
,F3NR1Z,2013-01-01T13:31Z,"I used options.cmd. I know i have to put in the lower key without spaces. I did it dozen of times but  the key never changed. There was always the same key at the top where it says which key I am currently using. And I couldn't even get in to the game at all. After I double clicked file it was loading for some time then it gave me bad cd key. But after changing the key in registry and running it I finally could run the game to get in the menu. And now running options.cmd shows the new keys I put in registry. But again, I can't change them through options.cmd. 
I did it all just like it says in description and I just can't get it to run. This is the 4th torrent I downloaded. No one worked for me. But if I put back dayz 1.7.1 with server, everything works fine. I think I'm just gonna wait for dayz standalone. 
I'm gonna seed anyway though"
,jaxx1rr,2013-01-01T14:33Z,"you dont need to seed I see theres enough seeders for now..
I know it should work without install because:
I installed the game using installers and it worked fine (server+client)
then I installed windows 8 and did not reinstall game.. just exported reg and imported in 8 ... so location was same (d:\games\Arma 2) and it worked.. so thats where you should have it..
the included reg is created by jimbo.. maybe I should have included mine..
also if you cant use your server just install tunngle it has 100+ players in lan and try there.."
,jaxx1rr,2013-01-01T14:33Z,can anyone else write a message that actually got it to work ??
,jaxx1rr,2013-01-01T14:35Z,wrote a long comment and it got lost.. fuking thepirateshit
,jaxx1rr,2013-01-01T14:37Z,Ill install it at some friends and see if theres a problem and how to fix it..
,Martin-z-Prahy,2013-01-01T15:54Z,"Hi Jaxx1rr - I put the lower key from the keygen using options.cmd for Arma 2 and for AO (sp I used the same key twice) - and I could only launch Arma 2.exe. Than I tried number 9 from options.cmd (so I used different keys) and that worked, now I can launch Arma 2 and AO. But the game is somehow not working for me - its so slow, like my pc isnt good enough - even when I lower the settings to minimum - I still have almost the same perfomance. Oh - and if I could help you try something in this release - feel free to tell me."
,Martin-z-Prahy,2013-01-01T16:31Z,"Okay - the issue with lag was completely my problem - this torrent works great - but when I execute ""dayz-game.bat"" and try to join some server it tells me I have an invalid cd-key. I used option 9 from options.cmd cause the keys from keygen didnt work for me (or I have done something wrong). As I said I tried the lower key for both serial keys and than the upper key with the lower key - but only the otions from options.cmd worked for me."
,knaken1234,2013-01-01T17:30Z,works perfect with tunngle! thank you Jaxx1rr! :)
,karlinnG,2013-01-01T21:59Z,"ok so i start server but it is stuck on creating and when i join it says waiting for host
when i check server log it says creating lingor bank
help?"
,karlinnG,2013-01-01T22:09Z,"ok it just says waiting for host when i join my server.
any fix?"
,karlinnG,2013-01-01T22:11Z,and status on server is just creating
,jaxx1rr,2013-01-01T23:13Z,"ok i managed to install this torrent at a friend in d://games//Arma 2 (my orig location) .. so basically modify all entries in the reg file but make sure u use double //// so its d:////games////Arma2
After that use options.cmd go to change key and use option 10 to put in key manually and start keygen to generate for Arma 2 ( copy paste and remove spaces) then for Arma 2 AO same and u should be set.. also block UDP OUTBOUND port 29910 in firewall like its written in desc"
,jaxx1rr,2013-01-01T23:15Z,dammit ... in last comment it should be D:\Games\Arma 2 not D:////Games////Arma 2.. I confused  with / and also I put to many coz in torrent creation every // gets turned into /
,jaxx1rr,2013-01-01T23:18Z,the worst thing about this is I cant see my new created comments.. happen to anyone else? :D
,jaxx1rr,2013-01-01T23:20Z,"mmkay .. the best location in REG file is D:\\Games\\Arma 2 ... (i had to put 4 \ so 2 will appear in this shit comment)
Maybe others work, I dont know.. as for hosting dunno check if firewall rule is up.. peace im out"
,knaken1234,2013-01-03T15:57Z,"on step 3, Open keygen, open registry reg file and change the cd keys ( ArmA 2 and ArmA 2 OA) remember to take away spaces and put out commas(,) just like it was, Then SAVE the reg file.
Now just open the REG file as ""REGISTRY EDITOR"" and then the game should work. PLAY WITH TUNNGLE aka LAN not via internet."
,knaken1234,2013-01-03T15:59Z,also you need change location in the same file if you installed it somewhere else then D.
