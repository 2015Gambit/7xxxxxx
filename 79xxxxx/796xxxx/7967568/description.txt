In Brooklyn circa 1900, the Nolans manage to enjoy life on pennies despite great poverty and Papas alcoholism. We come to know these people well through big and little troubles... Aunt Sissys scandalous succession of "husbands"... the removal of the one tree visible from their tenement... and young Francies desire to transfer to a better school...if irresponsible Papa can get his act together.
