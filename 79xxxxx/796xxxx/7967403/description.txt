Reseed on a seedbox after requests:


progressive - Indiana Jones And The Scavengers of Italy

A MUSIC torrent :)

Some time ago, my wicked younger brother and me met for some days after a long time.
We started soon to talk about the music we love, since we have similar tastes.
Examining a torrent I made time ago

progressive and beyond - Music for Old Animals

he uttered: Those you put there arent but the most famous bands of the RPI (Rock Progressivo Italiano). I wonder what there is beyond them.

So, just joking, we started scavenging the big sea of junk of Internet.
And we found a lot of jewels, scattered amongst forgotten torrents and streaming sites... We really felt like Indiana Jones after the discovery of some lost treasure.
So now you have it: a collection of more or less 140 albums which represent a fair sample of that unrepeteable moment that was in the 70s the Progressive Rock renaissance in Italy. Obscure groups, who often published an album only, but the musical level is really high. 
Using the excellent progarchives.com site as a reference map, we recovered archaelogic witness that our country, that now lies under a deep layer of shit, had a glorious artistic past... 
Nowadays we live under the shit, but we have developed excellent apnea techniques to survive :)
And if we had such a past, we hope that in our forgotten culture there is the seed of a better future... 

All the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).
The sampling rate is 320kbps for the 95% of the albums.
Different rates are signed in the name of the albums zips.

Enjoy :)
