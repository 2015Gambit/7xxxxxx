The Rolling Stones 1978 tour of the USA in support of that year's Some Girls album is considered by fans to be one of their very best. The tour followed immediately on the release of the Some Girls album and by the time the band arrived in Texas in mid-July the album had hit the No. 1 spot on the US charts. The tour took a back to basics approach, with the band and their music very much at the forefront and little or no elaborate staging. Filmed at the Will Rogers Memorial Center in Fort Worth, Texas, on July 18th, 1978, this concert is typical of the tour with the Rolling Stones delivering a raw, energetic performance in front of a crowd who are clearly loving the show. Many of the tracks from Some Girls are included in the live set with a sprinkling of Stones classics from earlier albums. Originally shot on 16mm film, the footage has been carefully restored and the sound remixed and remastered by Bob Clearmountain from the original multitrack tapes. This is undeniably the Rolling Stones at the peak of their form. Bonus Features: Newly filmed interview with Mick Jagger; "Tomorrow" featuring Dan Aykroyd and Mick Jagger - from Saturday Night Live, October 1978; "Shattered," "Respectable," and "Beast Of Burden" performed by The Rolling Stones, introduced by Laraine Newman - from Saturday Night Live, October 1978; Excerpts from ABC 20/20 Special, introduced by Hugh Downs with interviews by Geraldo Rivera - from 20/20, June 1978 5 mins. in total includes Mick, Keith, Ronnie and Bill; Interview with Mick [France Aug 2011] 15 mins.
