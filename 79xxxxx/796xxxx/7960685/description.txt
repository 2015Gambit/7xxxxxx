Stephen Fry: Gadget Man
Stephen Fry welcomes us into his wonderful world of tech, from the everyday to the extraordinary. Stephen doesn't live life like the rest of us. He doesn't get caught in traffic jams, doesn't have to push his own shopping trolley or even hold his own toothbrush - instead he relies on his collection of trusty gadgets to make his life run smoothly. In this show Stephen tries out all the products and prototypes he can lay his hands on, gadgets from the future, gadgets from the past, life-changing ones and sweet little gizmos that will change the way you live your life tomorrow. And he does it all in the company of some of his famous friends. Every week Stephen also creates his very own super gadget. Or at least tries to.




3)  Work Made Easy 
Stephen examines devices that make work easier and more fun and meets up with Lord Sugar to road test some of the latest work-saving gizmos. There's also a coffee machine that talks to your phone. Stephen plays around with some of Lord Sugar's early inventions. Other gadgets covered in this episode include a pen that transcribes notes direct to your computer, and an executive sleep pod.
