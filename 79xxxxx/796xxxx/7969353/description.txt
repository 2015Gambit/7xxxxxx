Pickwick ΓÇô Myths: Vols. 1, 2, and 3

Seattle based six-piece Pickwick is creating a local buzz as leaders of the soul revival, and their first few in a series of 7ΓÇ¥ were recently self-released. Prior to their breakthrough as a soulful pop band, Pickwick explored alt-country and folk, never quite hitting their stride. Following the release of the first single ΓÇ£Hacienda MotelΓÇ¥ (aka Myths: Vol. 1), which won airplay on the internationally acclaimed radio station KEXP, the band found a new audience and have gone on to issue Myths: Vol. 2 (ΓÇ£The RoundΓÇ¥) and Vol. 3 (ΓÇ£LimelightΓÇ¥). With lead Galen Disston and Grammy Award winner Kory Kruckenberg (Damien Jurado, The Maldives) on their side, Pickwick is a band to watch. ΓÇô Written by JFelton
