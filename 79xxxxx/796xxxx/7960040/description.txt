Programme telling the story of Ronnie Barker,
a quiet dedicated actor who might have been
a bank manager but went on to become one of
the country's favourite comedy stars.

Ben Elton, Michael Grade, David Renwick and
Josephine Tewson are among friends and
colleagues who remember his genius. Famed
as one half of the Two Ronnies and the likeable
convict Fletcher in Porridge, he was also a
prolific writer and admired actor in serious roles.
