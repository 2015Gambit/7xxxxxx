@ xMovie_Buffx

The ""output fps"" in this convert is 25, 
so this is a PAL version ( 720 x 576 )

When an uploader like ""Yakomo"" ignores to present
ALL spoken languages / ALL texted languages in all
his DVD-Uploads ( except his own ""subtitle dutch"" ) ....

.... and he doesn't answer a simple 
decent question if it is PAL or NTSC .... ( ? )

Should this uploader really have a trusted skull .... ?
