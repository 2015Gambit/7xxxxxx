@gu1t4r5tud Check your Gatekeeper settings. I'm going to copy & paste what I've said already on another torrent:

You have to:
1. Install the app.
2. Block internet connections via your Firewall (LittleSnitch recommended). Make sure app is closed at this point.
3. Open the app (if it doesn't open try right-click-> open in FINDER -not any other filesystem manager-). You don't have to spread open Gatekeeper like a whore, my setting on Privacy panel for GateKeeper is ""Mac AppStore and Identified Developers"".
5. Enjoy.

My guess is that you either have incorrect Gatekeeper settings (probably ""Mac AppStore"" only) OR you don't have a firewall rule and it's calling home."
