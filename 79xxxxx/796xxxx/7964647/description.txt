I'm missing the 46th show, in which one of the guests was Rory Gallagher.
That was also the last show with Dave Lee Travis, who later resurfaced 
in the UK as one of the 1970s & 80s hosts of the popular "Tops of the Pops".  

Lovely Uschi Nerke got a new (but temporary) co-host starting with this,
the 47th episode from September 1969 : Dave Dee -- then still lead singer 
of the rock band Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, who had made a few appearances on Beat Club and was taking a break at that time. 

This show is noteable for having more airtime for two featured bands; 
particularly The Who who perform several songs from their "Tommy" rock opera.
