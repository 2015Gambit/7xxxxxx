Notes:   Producer's note:  
3000 South Paradise Road provides a unique insight of Elvis rehearsing 6 hours before the opening night at the Las Vegas Hilton on August 4, 1972 and a complete performance from August 12, 1972.
Disc 1 is taken from the original reel. Disc 2 is from a personal cassette tape recording. The sonic quality on disc 2 is below standard, but the historical significance of the recording more than compensates for its audio limitations
