,8_SiN_8,2012-12-27T18:13Z,My wife is going to kill me if someone doesn't start posting .AVI's!
,8_SiN_8,2012-12-27T19:07Z,"does anyone know why no matter what i convert the last two episodes to they WILL NOT play on my ps3. Ive never come across this problem before. Ive tried every format under the sun. ALWAYS the same thing. Even downloaded a new video converter thinking mines was messed up. Same result with the new one, CORRUPTED DATA."
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2012-12-27T21:38Z,"@ 8_SIN_8 First of all your welcome for the upload!! 

I don't know what torrent client you use but wit Vuze you can transcode the file and add it to your ps3 library using that otherwise i suggest using Xilisoft to convert your files!! 

Latest version here from TorDigger - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7957167/Xilisoft_HD_Video_Converter_v7.7.0_build_20121224_with_Key_[TorD

Hope that helps!!"
