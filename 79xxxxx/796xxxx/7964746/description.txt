Don Jose Campos
The Shaman and Ayahuasca
Format: ePub

Internationally respected Peruvian shaman Don José Campos illuminates the practices and benefits of Ayahuasca with grace and gentleness and much respect and gratitude for the gifts Ayahuasca has bestowed on him throughout the 25 years he has been a practicing shaman. He takes the reader on a journey through his own difficulties in the discovery of other worlds, other dimensions, alien entities and plant teachers. Among other things, he discusses his difficulties in coping with some of the concepts taught to him by his plant teachers like the discovery that everything has consciousness. But if we accept this, our entire cosmology shifts for the greater benefit of mankind.

Along with Don José s transmission, we meet Pablo Amaringo. The world famous visionary painter talks about his art and his experiences as a shaman and the shocking reasons he stopped. Other voices include Julio Arce Hidalgo, biochemist and philosopher, and Don Solon, at 92 years old, the sole surviving Maestro of Don José. If one is interested in this most fascinating subject but is put off or frightened by the traveller s tales, this is the perfect book to introduce you to the profound experiences of Ayahuasca.
