Three women, an asping actress, a reporter, and a lawyer, hatch a scheme to enrich each other. The actress will fake a sexual harassment charge against a politician and get a lot of publicity, the reporter will get the scoop, and the lawyer will get a reputation for defending the actress. The scam goes as planned, but things start to break down.
