Recorded live in Basel, Switzerland on May 4, 2010, Resonance features the original line-up of the legendary prog rock supergroup Asia in concert during their Omega tour. This is an older but no less adept Asia - grounded by vocalist/bassist John Wetton's still powerful vocal chops - performing a cross-section of their ambitious songs that mix a hard rock intensity and classical virtuosity with a catchy, melodic songcraft.
