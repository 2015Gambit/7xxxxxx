Synopis:

After Charles Dobbs, a security officer, has a 

friendly chat with Samuel Fennan from the 

Foreign Office, the man commits suicide. An 

anonymous typed letter had been received 

accusing Fennan of being a Communist during 

his days at Oxford and their chat while walking 

in the park was quite amiable. Senior officials 

want the whole thing swept under the rug and 

are pleased to leave it as a suicide. Dobbs isn't 

at all sure as there are a number of anomalies 

that simply can't be explained away. Dobbs is 

also having trouble at home with his errant wife, 

whom he very much loves, having frequent 

affairs. He's also pleased to see an old friend, 

Dieter Frey, who he recruited after the war. With 

the assistance of a colleague and a retired 

policeman, Dobbs tries to piece together just 

who is the spy and who in fact assassinated 

Fennan.
