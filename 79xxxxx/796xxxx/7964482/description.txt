Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: Alex returns to the airwaves on this Thursday, December 27 edition of the Alex Jones Show. On the show today, Alex talks about the growing momentum of Democrats led by California's Dianne Feinstein to ram through legislation in the new year banning a large number of firearms and rolling back the Second Amendment following the Sandy Hook massacre in Connecticut earlier this month. 

He talks about the collectivization of America and covers the so-called fiscal cliff as Democrats and Republicans fail to come up with a deal as the terms of the Budget Control Act of 2011 are scheduled to go into effect.
