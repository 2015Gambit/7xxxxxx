This a costume drama and period piece based on real people and true facts all set in the 18th century.

Not only is it well acted, but the subjects treated in Garrow's cases are pertinent and timely to our own affairs of today. Enjoy a positive story about the struggle for truth, justice and the dignity of honest men and women no matter their lot in life.

Taking on the established legal practices and smug inertia of the courts, Garrow pioneered the art of cross-examination as an advocate for the accused.
