Young Merlin is a teenager, discovering and then learning to master his magical gift. Magister Gaius, King Uther Pendragon's learned court physician to whom he's assigned as humble page, teaches him medicine, coaches his magical self-study, and warns him of Uther's strong aversion to magic. Merlin becomes servant and later friend to the noble but imprudent crown prince, Arthur, whose fate is linked with Merlin. In this, the fifth and final season, Arthur is now King of Camelot and the Druid boy, Mordred, is now a knight of the round table.  While Morgana is still on the loose looking for a way to bring down the reign of the Pendragons.
