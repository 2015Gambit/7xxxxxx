Francois "Canut" Reyes is the "second voice" of the Gipsy Kings. Although his 
brother Nicholas' strong vocals lead out in many of the group's songs, and 
certainly brothers Andre & Patchai have solos sprinkled here & there, Canut's 
softer, huskier voice can be heard leading a few songs, and on this solo 
recording we can indulge in the full extent of his talent--vocals as well as 
guitar playing. Fortunately, there is a very noticeable lack of a band, allowing 
a nice, uncluttered presentation of Mr. Reyes' talent.

On this recording, you get Canut, a few back-up guys chanting comments, 
adding palmas & a minimum [but well-placed!] of percussion, and that's all. He 
'covers' Ravel [Bolero, of course] and Bizet ["L'Arlesienne"] in true, proud 
gitane style. Hearing him makes one long to be by a campfire late at night, 
gathered with friends & family, singing & dancing and perhaps reflecting on 
love lost.
