The Futurians was a superhero team created by Dave Cockrum, who first appeared in 1983 in issue 9 of the Marvel Graphic Novels series; and then later, in a three-issue run published by Lodestone Comics.  The series was reprinted by Eternity Comics in 1987.

The premise was of an extremely advanced future society called the Terminus, who attempted to alter the past by sending genetic information back through time, to give certain human beings super-powers (and a compulsion to use them) in order to enable them to stop some unnamed disaster. In the late 20th Century, a future inhabitant known only as "Vandervecken,"  or "The Dutchman," (both names for The Flying Dutchman) downloaded his mind into the body of a hobo who later becomes the owner of the Future Dynamics corporation.  Vandervecken then began gathering up those who had been empowered to begin preparing them for their historic battles.

Here are the main characters of The Futurians:
