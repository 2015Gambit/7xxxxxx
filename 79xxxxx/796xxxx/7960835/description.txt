Storyline:
Butter surveys the raw ambition of Laura Pickler IowaΓÇÖs long-reigning champion butter carver. For 15 years, Laura has relished her high-profile role as the beautiful, loyal helpmate to her affable, artistically gifted husband. But when Bob is pressured to retire and allow someone else a chance at glory, an indignant Laura decides to enter the competition herself. She is first in line on sign-up day, only to see her odds of victory fall with the arrival of an unlikely yet formidable contender: 10-year-old Destiny. And thatΓÇÖs not all. BobΓÇÖs would-be mistress, bad-girl stripper Brooke also declares her candidacy, as does his #1 fan, Carol-Ann. Facing three opponents, mocked by her stepdaughter Kaitlen and furious with her husband, Laura resolves to do whatever it takes to win. And if that means resorting to sabotage ΓÇô and recruiting her dim-witted former boyfriend Boyd as a co-conspirator ΓÇô then so be it.
