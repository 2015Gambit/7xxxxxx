,Rez994,2012-12-30T15:05Z,is there a way to play the original version of the game with this torrent ?
,tarzanscousin,2012-12-30T23:42Z,"Didn't work for me without running in XP mode on Widows 7 64 Pro and after that it barely worked at all. Has possibly the most obnoxious ""music"" in the history of mankind on the installer, thanks a lot for that. Don't bother with this and get one that works.... "
,maniabers,2012-12-31T18:31Z,game work but its sometime low fps and i got bug in single player story -.- I exept something better ;/
,L337ish,2013-01-01T03:02Z,"After I finally got this working, I uninstalled it almost immediately. The mods make the game run super slow, which never happens in any of my other modded games. With settings on max, the resource monitor said I had over 1GB of DDR5 video memory available and I was still getting like 25fps. They modded everything, including Niko, who now looks so stupid I laughed when I saw it. The installer plays really annoying dub step. 

Here's why I'm commenting. I got viruses on my first computer, after that, I learned my lesson and am much more careful. I never use anti-virus software because it only makes you slightly safer and it require so much more work and scanning and updating. My 2nd was a laptop I had for 2 years, used TPB and torrents plenty of times, never got a virus on the computer. I've had PC for a little less than a year now, been using TPB, torrents, etc just like I used to. No anti-virus software, still no viruses. 
Until I downloaded this torrent. After I installed this game, saw the first game I've ever seen made worse by mods, then uninstalled, my computer locked up and ransomware told me I had to pay a fine to unlock my computer. I put a stop to that quick, fast, and in a hurry. But now I'm gonna have to buy a new hard drive to clear my conscience. 

Don't download this, because I'm pretty sure it somehow gave ransomware access to my computer. If it didn't, don't download this because it's terrible. Vanilla GTA4 was pretty good, and I bet it gets even better with mods, but not these mods. Get vanilla, and then mod it yourself, it will probably turn out better. 

I never thumbs down a green skull, but it's happening on this one, sorry. "
,stridsvagnen91,2013-01-10T01:39Z,"Honestly, what is up with having music on installers? I forget about it everytime, and almost get a heartattack when i start installing, it's so incredibly loud and so fucking pointless."
