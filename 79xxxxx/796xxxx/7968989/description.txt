SYNOPSIS:
"We all live in continuous hypnosis, and those people who awake from the dream and start to live their own lives frighten the rest of us.
This film documents Andr치s Feldm치r's thoughts, thoughts that make listeners very uneasy, thoughts that prompt us to search our souls. Through his thoughts we become acquainted with a man who continually searches his own soul and has a way of thinking that makes us very uneasy."

Quote:
Andr치s Feldm치r:
A lot of youngsters are taken to psychiatrists because they sit for hours watching a wall. But nobody takes the parents away when they stare at a TV screen in the same manner. The real question is not if there is a life after death, but whether there is a death after life.

Quote:
Benedek Fliegauf:
All he said was, there's this Canadian-Hungarian psychologist in Debrecen who's a psychotherapist, and all his lectures are so packed there wouldn't be space to drop a pin even, and the people tape the lectures. Has an added benefit in the sense that with a little attention, people who are interested in this topic can find volumes of information.
And I think this film is good for breaking open the hard nut:
That locked place that people live inside.
