Student of the Year 2012 DVDRip x264 AAC - ViZNU [P2PDL]
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2172071/
Dean Yoginder Vashisht (Rishi Kapoor), retired, has fallen gravely ill. Several students from his
final year at St. Theresa's College rush to his side. In flashbacks, they all recall the events that
none of them have gotten over yet, including the dean, and how the "Student of the Year" competition
shaped who they were, how they related, and what they've become.

Recommend to you to use latest version of VLC player. Install K-Lite Codec Pack or shark007 codecs
in case of any kind of problem in playback (For non-VLC Media Player users). Alternatively, install
Core AVC codecs, the fastest decoder that there is coupled with Community Center Codec Pack and play
on Windows Media Player Classic. Check sample to be sure.
Enjoy!
