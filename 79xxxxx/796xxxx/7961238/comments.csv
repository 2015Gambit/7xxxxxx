OK, I cheated and downloaded this one from UseNet and it's really:

Chelsea.Lately.2012.12.26.Dita.Von.Teese.HDTV.x264-2HD

Both report here as 171.49MB

Also plopped my misnamed Chelsea into the ffolder for this torrent and sure enough, a ""force recheck"" found my misnamed Chelsea a certain match.

So, I'm betting on (and downloading) the first ""149.99 MiB"" file.

The really odd thing is that both were uploaded by TvTeam.

I'm sure this is an honext mistake, but folks may be wondering.

Management should nuke this or whatever the proper term is.
