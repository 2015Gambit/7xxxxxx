    In the peaceful Appalachian hills of Jackson, Kentucky the earth burns. The toxins being dumped into abandoned mines could turn Jackson into a wasteland if no one stops it. EPA Marshal Jack Taggert will.

Taggert's job is to ferret out those responible for poisoning the land. When thugs try to take him out of the action, Taggert takes on another line of work.  He's in the butt-kicking buisness. Buisness is good.
