The Cave Singers - Invitation Songs (2007)


Seattles Cave Singers debut with a rural blend of homespun mystery and - folk music approached by way of punk rock, or an updated version of the - Anthology Of American Folk Music, Seattle Weekly. - You might hear bits of Calexico, Iron and Wine, Devendra, or Lindsey Buckingham in their dense and eerie sound. Singer Pete Quirks appealingly nasal voice simultaneously echoes Arlo Guthrie and a mosquitos buzz.
