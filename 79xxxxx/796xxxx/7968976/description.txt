For this late eighties renaissance album, Dolly Parton told producer Ricky Skaggs to ΓÇÿTake Me Back to the Country.ΓÇÖ After years of mediocre pop-oriented material, Dolly returned to her traditional roots, and the results were very, very impressive!
This collection started Dolly back on the road to artistic elegance even if most disc jockeys ignore her these days. White Limozeen is just one more reason to turn off the radio's cowboy hatted clones and enjoy the stellar country of Dolly and her contemporaries.
