Philo Beddoe the easygoing truck driver and bare-knuckle brawler, and his 165-pound orangutan pal Clyde get into more mischief in this faster and funnier sequel to every which way but loose. Clint Eastwood is Philo, hoping to "retire" from fighting. But a new contender lures him back - and mobstera kidnap Philo's gir(Sondra Locke) to ensure he'll turn up for the showdown. Ruth Gordon as Ma, Goeffrey Lewis as Orville and those hapless motorcycle morons called the Black Widows all return in fine form.
