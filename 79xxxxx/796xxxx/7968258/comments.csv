,QborT,2012-12-29T02:14Z,"You didn't recieve this because you asked dumbass, they upped this because it was available.  It's not like they are going to sit on a new release, this whole deal is a race to be the first to provide."
,MisterE2108,2012-12-29T03:52Z,Dontcha just luv it when a guy who knows NOTHING about life in general suddenly becomes an expert on EVERYTHING...golly wow thanks so much for that imperative information @QborT

,2HardRain,2012-12-29T15:52Z,Praise Love. Beyond Jesus... P.S Jesus would approve...
,QborT,2012-12-29T18:49Z,"It's nice to be recognized as an expert in EVERYTHING ----- Takes a bow.

Seriously MisterE2108, tell me where I misspoke in that comment?  Tell me 1 part that is wrong.  Please I beg you, correct me if you can."
,mikeesm,2012-12-29T20:35Z,anyone care to provide the A:? V:? M:? ratings?
,JNA1313,2012-12-29T21:50Z,"QborT - He said ask and you shall receive, I doubt he was asking for you to tell him how TPB works. I believe he was just conveying how happy he was with the quick ""up""! I think most who use this site  are smart enough to know how it works, right? But thank you so much for trying to show off how tech savvy you are! 
As for the torrent:
Thank you so much BOZX! I love your 1080 torrents!
A/A 10/10 - as always!!"
,minjigga,2012-12-30T00:44Z,"@QborT, it is entirely possible that MisterE2108 had ""asked"" for this release on another channel, such as FB or the release group's website. I wouldn't be so quick to jump on someone so needlessly. You don't make any friends that way, and you end up looking impertinent.

Your obvious irritation with this user betrays something about yourself which I find very interesting. While you did contribute some ""information"", you've disseminated it in a fashion that hinders reception, making your only discernible intention bullying those with ""inferior intellect"".

I would hazard a guess that the reason you dislike individuals such as MisterE2108, is that their comments don't contribute much of anything to primary purpose of the ""comment section"". Without a rating on quality, a confirmation a crack works, or the like, comments like the one you quickly attacked just leave you more to read. Therein lies your frustration, and eventual self-separation, from the ""common horde"" of uneducated digital pirates.

Ironically, you sabotage yourself with your attack, as there is even more garbage on this torrent than there ever would have been, should you have left it alone.

Cheers."
,maxjasper,2012-12-30T03:47Z,Thanks a lot bro
,badpie99,2012-12-30T04:34Z,"I recently paid Qbot for manual hand release and he did come through for me however there was an incident that required some visine and a wet wipe that left him in a bit of a mood, please excuse him while he goes down the rough road to recovery. Cheers! A10 V10 M6"

Both video and audio quality is excellent. I particularly found this movie to be a little weird, given its nature. After learning that it was inspired by true events, it made me feel a little better. It's hard to believe that something like this could happen, so many times."
,QborT,2012-12-30T05:28Z,"minjigga-- mad props to you for your extremely well written logical stab at me, even if it doesn't really hit home.  Except the impertinent part, I am without a doubt a total dick and I was indeed bullying someone with inferior knowledge.  Not necessarily someone with ""inferior intellect"" (as you suggested), I would never assume I am smarter than anyone based on a simple comment.  For all I know MisterE is an mad genius.  

I truly don't care if MisterE2108 asked for this on another channel/site/forum.  My point was that you don't get ""new"" movie releases because you ask.  They get uploaded as soon as possible so uploaders/ripper/groups can increase their E-peen size.

Your guess about what irritated me in regards to MisterE's comment is totally wrong.  I have very little interest in ""information"" that is provided in the comment section.  I am not some amateur that looks for A/V ratings from the average user (mikeesm I'm looking at you lulz).  I have discernible taste so I make sure I know what I am grabbing before hand.  Infact I loved MisterE's comment because it gave me a chance to mock and ridicule him, which in turn has evolved into this awesomely amusing comment strip.  There is no frustration in my world, only contempt for people that comment without knowing what they are talking about.  However, my contempt is easily turned into amusement (like this). 

JNA1313-- TPB has over 6 million registered users, and I would be willing to bet that most of those users have very little knowledge as to how all ""this"" works.   FFS most people don't know the difference between an uploader and a ripper or a scene group vs a P2P group......  And you are more than welcome, I am glad I could impress you with my savviness.

Troll on, but make sure they are good.  Not like badpie's weak attempt, that really was feeble dude.  

:)"
,MisterE2108,2012-12-30T07:59Z,"Great quality, thanks so much, the director did an amazing job...top notch on all levels of film making. A familiar story, but this film will stain people's morals. Will be disturbing to some. LMFAO...for a sec there I thought I was posting a review on IMDB?! 
A - 10
V - 10

I had to masturbate after this movie."
,FireIsHot,2012-12-31T07:43Z,"Sounds Interesting and Disturbing at the same time. I can't let this one slip by. Will comment on A/V/M after viewing. 

Thanks BOZX!"
,sylver_shadow,2012-12-31T23:11Z,"This is the stupidest movie i ever saw!!! And the fact that its based on true events makes it unbelievably stupid!!! Who in their right mind with an ounce of intelligence would do and continue following ridiculous orders from an ""officer"" over the phone?? How stupid and retarded were these people in real life? I think its just totally unbelievable...and very stupid of them to make into a movie. Bunch of retards!!!"
,trywait4,2013-01-01T11:57Z,"Don't watch this movie if you are proud to be of the human race. Unbelievable that it is based on true events.
M/5, predicable, though does make you question, ""What are you thinking!?"". yuk.

Certainly not worth the 4.26GigB. You can waste time better, Sling Blade or just ask the other commenters, ""What are you thinking? Get a room Bozos!"""
