Every episode released for Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide.
Some of the files are in .wmv, some in .avi, and some in .m4v, all of which can be easily converted to another type if desired. This is basically a finisher for the seedless torrents that roam the internet of this show, so PLEASE SEED!
Feel free to message me if there are any problems.
