Lawrence of Arabia
by David Murphy

Description:
 Thomas Edward Lawrence, more popularly known as Lawrence of Arabia, was one of the most iconic figures of the 20th century, immortalized on stage and screen, whose exploits in the Middle East in the second half of World War I helped shape the campaign in that part of the world. In the course of two brief years, Lawrence emerged as one of the main strategic and tactical minds behind the Arab Revolt. He went from being an obscure staff officer to the rank of full colonel and became one of the men who shaped the modern Middle East. From being a pure amateur, he also developed desert tactics that would be used throughout World War II and afterwards. This new Command title provides an in-depth analysis of every aspect of Lawrence's storied military career.

"All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible. This I did."
