,vocalised80,2012-12-27T23:30Z,"@michaelrwatson

You are a serious FUCKTARD!!!!!

All you seem to do is whinge and complain.

You don't do shit and prob don't even seed.

I hope you step in front of a bus some time soon so the rest of us don't have to see your stupid ignorant posts everytime a quality skull up's something new, just hold your fucking breath until it all goes black.

thanks charlesfire22 for all your work"
,BostonAl2012,2012-12-28T00:32Z,"OMG he's everywhere!

Have to agree with you again V80!

And yes he's still a Douche too!

DLing and will update on the A/V!  But right away want to say thank you for such a great UL size wise~Efforts are really appreciated!  

A CAM doesn't need to be 1-2gigs~I mean after all it's just a cam!  On the other hand, I will take 1-2gigs and be happy too! ;)"
,BostonAl2012,2012-12-28T00:55Z,"Watched first 5mins streamed through Utorrent Player.

General A/V = 5/5

But as far as Cams go, I would say 7 or 8 for video and maybe the same for Audio, timing seemed spot on.  

Credits slightly cut, so video maybe too, although  I could clearly see the Cammer adjust as the credits rolled.

Overall I would have to say, that it works for me!

TY to everyone involved in this UL! "

,michaelrwatson,2012-12-28T06:57Z,"@vocalised80, BostonAl2012: Hey you gay boinkers, if you ever get tired of spanking your monkeys, your moms would like to get some. 

Btw, i do seed, and no, i don't try to fix screwed up torrentz like these."
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-28T08:14Z,"WARNING: This has nasty flicker throughout, although the audio is better than advertised. 

ALSO, be warned that the moron who encoded it used the very latest h264 codec, so you'll have to upgrade VLC to v2+ (if that will even run on your computer).

@charlesfire22: Are you the fucking retard who reencoded this shyte?"
,BostonAl2012,2012-12-29T00:38Z,"Michael; Sod Off, you wanker!

Your comments suck and are of no value!

Get the Bollocks out of your mouth and Ass and grow a pair of your own!

You're still a DOUCHE!"
,BostonAl2012,2012-12-29T00:42Z,"BTW:  The Sound on this gets deep and is somewhat muffled later on in the movie, as it does in all the Cams of this flick out there right now.  Also yes it has a flicker through out as previously mentioned in other threads ~ But as I said for the size I'll take this torrent so far...  Checking out the 600MB one uled today now!  I'm betting it's no better!

Also : Michael is still a DOUCHE and a Wanker!"
