2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

It's been an absolute pleasure sharing this Christian Music with everyone during 2012, just as it was freely shared with me.  Fifty-five bundles of 2012 music, and as December quickly winds down, this will be my final torrent of the year.  For anyone keeping count, the 55 bundles accounted for 1,461 Christian Releases.  If even one of those 1,461 products has blessed your life, be sure to support the Artist in their ministry, and most importantly, thank the Lord.  Because without Him, all of this would be pointless.
