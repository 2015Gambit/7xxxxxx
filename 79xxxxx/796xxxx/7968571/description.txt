TagCraftMC's official 1.4.6 Minecraft client!

Our client is super simple to install!

- Download the torrent.

- Run the Installer

- Play Minecraft from the Shortcut made on the Desktop.


For 1.4.6 we are trying and releasing our new client. This client should give you the user more freedom as well as a small news feed. This client is still an early build so we have packed the old client with it just in case it is not working for you. (Old and new client can be found @ C:Users%user%AppDataRoaming.minecraftTagCraftMC Launcher)
If you have/find any bugs or problems with this client please feel free to make a post in the right section on our forums. http://www.tagcraftmc.com/forum/m/7524762/viewthread/5345483

The new client requires .net framework 4, most windows PCΓÇÖs running Vista or higher should not have a problem running the new client, if you do get an error about not having .net 4 installed please install .net 4, this client has been tested on Vista, Win 7 and Win 8.
.net 4 Web Installer: http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=17851

If you have any problems, please open the "Client Help and Info" file or click the "Client Help and Info" button on the top of our website www.tagcraftmc.com.

On our website we also offer and Online Cracked Client for those unable to use the installer (Mac OS ect), this allows you to play Cracked Minecraft from our website, just Click the "Play Online!" link under the ΓÇ£Download or Play OnlineΓÇ¥ button or use the following link. http://www.tagcraftmc.com/playonline

On our site we also supply a direct download of the installer, this is for people who cannot or do not want to use the torrent. These can be seen under the ΓÇ£Download or Play OnlineΓÇ¥ button.

Due to our late release of this client we were able to pack with it reiΓÇÖs minimap as well as the faithful 32 32 texture pack and MC patcher.

Our server is already in the sever list when starting up minecraft, but in case you deleted it, you can connect to our server with play.tagcraftmc.com.

If you have any questions please feel free to post on our forums or in the comments.
