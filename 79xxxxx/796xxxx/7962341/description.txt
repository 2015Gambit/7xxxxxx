Book Description
================
Naguib Mahfouz guides us on a journey through the history of the tumultuous 
alley belonging to a delightful - and sometimes diabolical - Egyptian 
family: the descendants of a man named Gebelawi. We accompany them in 
their struggles to right their wrongs, to eke out a better existence 
for themselves and their cohorts - and we discover a second, hidden, 
and daring narrative: the spiritual history of humankind. From the supreme 
feudal lord who disowns one son for cruel pride and puts another to 
the test, to the savior of a succeeding generation who frees his people 
from bondage, we find the men and women of a modern Cairo neighborhood 
unwittingly reenacting the lives of their holy ancestors: the "children 
of the alley."
