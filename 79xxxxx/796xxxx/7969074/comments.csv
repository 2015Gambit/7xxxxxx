Happy viewing!"
,Heloc,2012-12-29T23:58Z,"The video quality is better than I expected. The problem is, for some reason, the characters' voices aren't audible. But the other 'environment' sounds are fine. Am I doing something wrong here or is there something that I should do to fix this? Please help."
,jv_kenshin416,2012-12-30T00:58Z,"UPDATE:

Just finished downloading. Took a quick look at the video. It's very good. Subs is good. There are 2 subs in the file. Use the english sub and it should be fine. Thanks again condors369 for this great torrent."

,MHNZ,2012-12-30T01:56Z,Heloc - The audio is encoded in 6 Channels. I presume you are watching on a stereo setup. You need to check your audio config in computer and your media player.

Sometimes audio switches between environment and voices, becomes like a CAM audio, no biggie. "
