A collection of materials I used to prepare for the Revised GRE test. Numbers in brackets signify my ratings of the material, 1 being the most useful (and official) prep book, and 6 being the one least worth checking. Note that only ETS's official guide gives overview of the new math areas (statistics and such). Other books are (actually) rehashed old editions and do not provide proper math updates. They are very useful nonetheless and you must use at least one of them, because the official guide is too short. My advice is to go through as many practical exercises as possible with your stopwatch on. Good luck.

N.B. Ask me if you want more info or advice (especially for the Verbal section).
