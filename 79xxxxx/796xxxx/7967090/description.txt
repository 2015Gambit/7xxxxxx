When his sister gets pregnant, Surjit goes to Thakur's house in order to get Manjit to marry his sister. The Thakur humiliates him, making him, a vegetarian, eat dog-food, and beg on his knees. Surjit does so, and is told to go home and make wedding preparations. The next day, Thakur visits Surjit and kills him and his wife in broad daylight. Surjit's last dying wish is that his two sons, Raju and Kishan, must get married to Thakur's two daughters, Megha and Preeti, and they must have the Thakur come begging to their doorstep for this marriage alliance. Surjit's sister agrees to this, and accordingly brings up the two children. Unfortunately, Raju decides to move away, leaving her alone to bring up Kishan. Years later, they are re-united when Raju returns home...
