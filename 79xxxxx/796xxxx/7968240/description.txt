All the JAR files up to the current version, including the first Alpha files!

To use them, 

1. Make a backup (ZIP/RAR) of your current minecraft.jar in:

Windows XP:
C:Documents and Settings(Your Name)AppdataRoaming.minecraftBin

Windows 7:
C:Users(Your Name)AppdataRoaming.minecraftBin

Delete the original minecraft.jar

2. Drag the version you want over (i.e. MineCraft Beta 1.1_02.jar), rename it to minecraft.jar.

3. Run Minecraft and do not update if it asks!

Have Fun!
