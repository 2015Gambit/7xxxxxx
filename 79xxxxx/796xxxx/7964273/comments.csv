,rocketmanzzz,2013-01-02T04:13Z,WwTIPPYwW  could you please give us the link or where we can dowload the multi state hack from last year?  Thanks
,ElFlaco-77,2013-01-02T05:43Z,"Thank you very much StimpyCat. Would it be possible to point me to the multi-state crack if there's one available?

Happy New Year to you and all."
,StimpyCat,2013-01-02T20:29Z,"Hi ElFlaco-77, I have no idea about any multi-state crack. In fact, I know nothing about any cracks for TurboTax. Can it be possible to install this on two or more computers and use different states? If anyone trys to do that, please feel free to post your findings. As for the multi-state crack, if anyone knows of a legit one, go ahead and post the link.

Thanks for all the positive reviews. Have a wonderful and safe New Year!"
,ElFlaco-77,2013-01-03T02:28Z,"Thanks for responding StimpyCat. Yes you can install TT in in different computers and hence download different states but it's quite a drag if you're preparing tax returns for someone who works in several states. In any case, I'll post if I find out anything about the multi-state crack. I've never seen it but just mentioned it because someone else had a reference to such a crack. Cheers!"

Thank you for the instructions on how to get multiple states. Confirm it's working with this 2012 edition. Tiny update on step 8, the file name is  'Price_S2012US1040PER.xml'."
