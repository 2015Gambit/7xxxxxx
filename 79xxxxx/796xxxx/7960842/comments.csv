I saw nothing, but hope is not lost.

One thing that always threatens to happen in the torrent world is that you grabbed it when it was 99.9% complete by accident. This is easy to check and easy to fix. Just put it back (usually means to tell your torrent client to start again, stopping it, then replacing the files with A COPY OF your complete files). Then (only works on a STOPPED torren) tell it to ""Force Recheck"". This will tell you if it's complete. If there's any error whatsover, even something you or anything else did AFTER you finished. If your HDD has a bad sector - anything will be discovered by telling you it's incomplete. At least my antiquated version of uTorrent offers this really cool way of instantly tellin by setting it to append "".!ut"" to the end, giving it a false extension until it's complete and then removing it. I can then instantly tell what's complete and what's not just by looking at the file, even if my torrent client isn't running.

Strikes me as something to remember for the future - create an SFV. Sigh ...

Of course, you're probably thinking that the error was there and I either missed it or am trying to escape responsibility for it. I have a tiny bit expertise in this area as I have screwed up one (that I remember offhand) of these and discovered that VLC and XBMC can be fragile and tracking down such problems is difficult. If you have a second player and the problem doesn't arise there, this info can be helpful in troubleshooting. And just for you or anyone else that has a problem, giving TOO MUCH information is ALWAYS a good thing. What player, what version, what device, operating system, etc ... that you are using.

Two reasons why I reject this theory. (1) this is the only incidence reported and with the other two versions [272p 352p] directly dependent upon this copy, it seems reasonable that there would be more complaints and (2) this would mean ""tough luck"" as it is the only available copy in the known universe (torrent and UseNet). The whole project relies on a single provider calling themselves TheWretched (wtd) and all appearances are that they did a rather professional job of it. Not having access to DTS equipment denies me authority to say anything about that.

So, there you have it. If I can be of further help, just holler (on my neweswt torrent as I won't watch this forever and as time goes by, less and less often).

Spoiler Alert!!!

I still feel the violence and the rage and the paranoia, XIII!
Sounds to me like your natural state.

Cool part to relive, thank you."
