720p CAM.  ... those are reserved for movies not for High Res. unless its rip alot of users wont go for it."
,percypp,2012-12-30T12:36Z,"why do people bother with this CAM shit? 

do you need to see the movie so desperately that you'll watch a CAM?

there's a million other proper rips on here to watch while you're waiting for a decent version to come out."
,Agent666,2013-01-04T16:25Z,"HEY FROGGIE100: THANKS FOR THE TORRENT!

IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH THERE ARE MANY INDIVIDUALS, THAT, FEEL IT'S NECESSARY TO COMPLAIN ABOUT CAM-VIDEOS, WELL, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM, DON'T GET THEM, AND KEEP YOUR IGNORANT COMMENTS TO YOURSELVES!"

AUDIO IS CLEAN/GOOD (NO ECHO)

Thanks Froggie"
