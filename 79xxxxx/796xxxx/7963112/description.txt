NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)

NOTE: English Subtitles are on by default.  Simply tap the V key to disable them or delete the .srt files.

NOTE: Three video samples are included as well as the NFO files for all 12 episodes.

NOTE: This upload may take a few days since I do not have constant Internet access.  Please be patient!
