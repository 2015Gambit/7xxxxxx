It provides detailed and practical advice on the management of psychiatric disorders, in-depth coverage of psychiatric assessment, psychopathology, evidence-based practice, mental health and capacity legislation in the British Isles, difficult and urgent situations, transcultural psychiatry, and therapeutic issues. 
The new edition features a completely updated legal section with coverage of the new English mental health act, updated coverage of the Scottish mental health act and new coverage of incapacity legislation in England, Wales and Scotland, a completely updated section on schizophrenia, and the addition of new drugs and new clinical guidance from recognized institutions such as NICE. 
It also includes specialist chapters on learning disabilities, psychotherapy and child psychiatry reviewed and revised by specialist registrars currently working in the fields. 
The book is internally cross-referenced and has both key references to important papers and to further information resources. As well as being indexed alphabetically, it is also indexed by ICD-10 / DSM-IV codes, and there is a quick index for acute presentations. 
This handbook is practical and didactic in style, designed to provide portable reassurance to doctors beginning psychiatry. There is helpful advice for the management of difficult and urgent situations, and the text is peppered with clinical observations on the practice of clinical psychiatry and guidance based upon the experience of the authors.
