,Lucky1one,2012-12-28T08:37Z,Works great.  Thanks for the up!  Sucks that it's set up to work with xbox 360 controller.  Managed to get it working with a PS3 controller using gamepad companion (also available on the pirate bay here) and mapping out the keyboard functions to the controller.  If you're ps3 controller is connected by bluetooth it will assume you're using a xbox controller when initially opening the game but the controls are all messed up and it's useless.  Disconnect it from the bluetooth and start the game up so it's setting you up to play with the mouse and keyboard.  Then plug in the ps3 controller via the usb port turn on the gamepad companion (Don't forget to map the keyboard functions to the ps3 controller first however you'd like it set up).  Hope this is of some help to those that like using a gamepad.  Cheers
