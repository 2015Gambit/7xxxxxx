,pokeluna,2013-01-05T01:01Z,"If you have the stfk problem when you start, you can play by pressing ""enter"" quickly to skip the logos but but it will crash if u play in the arcade"
,2high334,2013-01-06T00:50Z,taking forever to download... but hopefully this works .. ...
,Scrusoe,2013-01-06T06:25Z,"@Jabroni40, firstly, I think you better check your wineskin's engine and wrapper first. Try to click your mouse when the first message appears and keep pushing the spacebar each time you see any logo until the game menu appears. This trick works for me so far."
