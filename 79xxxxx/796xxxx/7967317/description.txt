Love and God - By Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

Maharishi expresses the spontaneous flow of love, gratitude, and devotion arising from the state of supreme Self-Realization.
This is a beautiful lecture Maharishi was worldwide published in 1967/68 when the Beatles, Donovan, Mike Love, Paul Horn and other great Artists found him and started to meditate with TM.
But the Original Lecture is from 1964!
Transcendental Meditation (TM) is the tool to bring all good Qualities to life from within because the "Kingdom of Heaven" is within every Soul.
TM is the most simple, easy & natural & yet totally dynamic method to dive within & tap the source of thought from where all energy, power & creativity comes. It give us best health & makes us alert to change the world into a better place to live in!
All my gratitude goes to my Master His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
