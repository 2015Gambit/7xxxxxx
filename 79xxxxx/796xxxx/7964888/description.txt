Talk Talk - Today [promo].VOB


Very HQ rare promo music video from a promo DVD. "Today" is a song from The Party's Over, the debut album by Talk Talk. It was released in 1982 and produced by Colin Thurston, who was a former engineer for David Bowie but was better known for producing Duran Duran's first two albums. 

In the United Kingdom, the album's single "Today" was a top twenty hit. The remixed version of the single "Talk Talk" reached #1 in South Africa in 1983 (and #23 in the UK). In the United States, the album entered the Billboard Top 200 reaching #132, while the single "Talk Talk" peaked at #75. 

In New Zealand, the album was a hit, peaking at #8, due to the success of "Today" which reached there #10 in 1983. 

Talk Talk began as a quartet consisting of Mark Hollis (vocals), Simon Brenner (keyboards), Lee Harris (drums) and Paul Webb (bass guitar). They were generally associated with the New Romantic movement; more specifically, in their early years, they were often compared with Duran Duran, as both bands sported a name which was a single word repeated twice, a Roxy Music-inspired musical direction, and shared the same record label (EMI) and producer (Colin Thurston). 

In their later years the band's commercial appeal receded, but their critical reputation increased as they moved from synthpop to a more experimental form. Their final two albums, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock, were highly acclaimed and remain influential to experimental alternative rock genres, especially post-rock. 

Talk Talk's influence upon musicians has exceeded the band's visibility among the general public. Along with the band Slint, Talk Talk are credited with inventing post-rock in their last two albums, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock. Sigur Ros has played Talk Talk songs before their shows. 

Bands and artists that have claimed to be influenced by and/or a fan of Talk Talk include Portishead, Bark Psychosis, The Catherine Wheel, Lights, Radiohead and DJ Shadow. The band Weezer covered their song "Life's What You Make It" and No Doubt scored a hit with a cover of "It's My Life" in 2003. John Taylor of Duran Duran also has expressed fondness for the group; Talk Talk opened for Duran Duran back in 1982.
