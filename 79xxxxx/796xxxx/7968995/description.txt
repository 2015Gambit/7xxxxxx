In the pursuit of what he labeled ΓÇÿCosmic American Music,ΓÇÖ Gram Parsons-with the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, and as a solo artist-helped invent country-rock, forever changing the relationship between the two genres. GP, released in 1973, and Grievous Angel, released posthumously in 1974, are the only two studio albums on which Parsons served as the lone bandleader. With the help of Elvis Presley's backing band and a then unknown singer named Emmylou Harris on harmony vocals, Parsons wrapped up bluegrass, honky tonk, traditional country, R&B, and rock & roll in one delicious package.
