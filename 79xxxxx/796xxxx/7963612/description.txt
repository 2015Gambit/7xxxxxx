Cousin Joe (December 20, 1907 ΓÇö October 2,1989) was an American blues and jazz singer, later famous for his 1940s recordings with clarinetist Sidney Bechet and saxophonist Mezz Mezzrow. His birth name was Pleasant Joseph and he was born in Wallace, Louisiana, United States. He died in his sleep from natural causes in New Orleans, at the age of 81

Under his own name and a whole host of aliases, including Cousin Joe, Smiling Joe, Pleasant Joe, and Brother Joshua, combined country blues piano with just a bit of New Orleans jazz, and coupled with his everyman voice, which managed to convey a wink and a grin in just about every inflection, he maintained an impressive balance between sounding down-home and uptown, even splitting his time between New Orleans and New York as if to geographically seal the deal

On this CD is compiled his first recordings made in 1945 and 1946 for the King Jazz, Savoy, and Gothic labels. Today Joe is greatly overlooked amongst New Orleans music talent.
