This is William C. Mitchell's mindblowing book Bye Bye Big Bang - Hello Reality (2002) which presents a compelling tour of the troubles of the Big Bang theory, a survey of alternatives and a reasonable alternative of its own. A lucid description of the Big Bang theory is first presented. Following that, the long list of older flaws in that theory are reviewed, and some newly discovered additions to those are presented. The combined impact of those flaws forever destroys the credibility of a Big Bang. But, more importantly, an alternative theory that is based on astronomical data, proven science and logic is then presented. Mitchell takes apart the Big Bang theory in a careful, methodical manner, turning nearly all the data scientists think actually proves the Big Bang happened. He examines red shifts and the sacred Hubble constant, the age of white dwarfs (many as old as 20 billion years, older than the age of the universe), discussing for the first time the age and life-cycles of galaxies and how these cycles cover tens of billions of years. He further examines the nature of entropy and finally concludes that the universe has been in a steady-state for perhaps billions upon billions of years, infinite in all directions. The author is of course ignored, pilloried, and excoriated by mainstream scientists, but he is also one of the few who have chosen to challenge mainstream ideas that are held just because they are comfortable. Gain an understanding of the Big Bang theory in a few short chapters. Learn about its many flaws - why you shouldnΓÇÖt believe a word of it. Then learn the true story of cosmology based on facts and logic. 400 pages. A must read for everyone.
