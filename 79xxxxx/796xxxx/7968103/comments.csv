 does that make u a stupid DINK?"
,Fattys,2012-12-30T05:48Z,"Props to extremezone for the upload, but seriously guys don't waste your time on this godawful movie, everything is terrible about it. Just a friendly person trying to spare you 1 1/2 hours of your time."
,JakobTPB,2012-12-30T07:42Z,"the movie isnt all that awfull - for an exorsist movie, and if u like that stuff go for it... the rational thinking (plot) by some characters bugs me though. especially the mom. so a bit laking in the writing department. the good speciall effects is a +.

its entertaining and has a few WTF moments!

Happy Piratey New Year Everyone!

Salut & cheers to another year the Pirate Bay is still an unsinkable ship!  May your torrents go top 100 and your VPNS get cheaper! ;)

To Hollywood.. Dont you have some extortion letters to send out to Parliament, Congress, Warner, Unversial, and Sony Entertaintment? Damn thieves! WHAT were they thinking illegally downloading movies and crappy shows like ""Gossip Girl""! tsk.. tsk.. tsk. (No accounting for taste)

Anywho.. Party on TPB peeps!"
,Jenxx,2012-12-30T15:02Z,"Wasnt all that bad until i realized the ""ancient spirit"" is actually speaking in Polish and it became more of a comedy then a horror listening to his dialogues. Shouldnt creepy old spirits speak in latin or something?"
,Pirate2P,2012-12-30T18:21Z,@FDSeoul - why don`t u just shut the fuck up u wanker

,Delron41,2013-01-03T02:04Z,"Was I the only one who noticed the dropped frame every second?
Anyways, I once dated a girl with a box much like this one,    she acted like something possessed when I put stuff in it.
I think she may have even spoke Polish once.

And by stuff, I mean...my penis."
,Delron41,2013-01-03T02:12Z,"And by box....

No but seriously I saw this movie when it was called the Exorcist.
Thanks for the up EZ."
