Uniblue DriverScanner is an application designed to help you deal with drivers in a nice and easy way, relying on a set of dedicated tools to update drivers, create backups and restore them in just a few minutes.
Using DriverScanner is not at all difficult because it comes with a straightforward interface that guides you through the whole process.
You can thus scan your computer and get a comprehensive list of drivers to be updated, along with download links to get the job done without even leaving the main window of the app.
And speaking of the main window, along with device driver information, you also get a bunch of version details, plus driver age and a ΓÇ£learn moreΓÇ¥ link to see even more info.
Uniblue DriverScanner can display information on every single piece of hardware under the hood of your computer, including network adapters, processors, sound, video and game controllers, disk drives, display adapters and USB controllers.
On the other hand, it also comprises dedicated tools to backup and restore drivers, so you are able to remove and install drivers in just a few minutes with a single click.
The application works with so-called restore points, similar to the ones created by Windows, only that these ones are made by DriverScanner every time a new piece of driver is installed on your computer.
Although it has a pretty easy to use interface, the help manual included in the package is actually published on the developer's website, so in case you don't have an Internet connection it's impossible to read the available documentation.
But all in all, Uniblue DriverScanner is quite a handy tool that provides an impressive amount of information regarding your drivers. And even if it has a pretty hefty price, it could be one of the best investments you've ever made.
