"On the Other Side" is a sleazy tabloid show hosted by the sardonic and nymphomaniac Scott. Every week, the show covers different behind-the-scenes scandals from popular sitcoms, aided by a seedy papparazzi crew that makes amateur porn movies with a professional touch by videotaping the sexual antics of the show's subject. As Scott gets more and more obsessed with the sexual details of his guests' on-the-set infidelity, a warped menage'a trois scandal surfaces between a trio of actors who portray the mother, father, and daughter on a popular TV show.
