Also the cam's little mic couldn't handle the rumbling bass, and sometimes it is difficult to hear what people are saying.  Lots of coughing, sneezing, audience noises, etc.  Also cam guy couldn't keep his hands off the camera, kept adjusting zoom levels and pressing buttons that made a loud click every time.

Buuuut nonetheless its a very watchable cam rip, and I'm picky.  The video quality is more important to me, and aside from zooming in too far at points, its fine."
