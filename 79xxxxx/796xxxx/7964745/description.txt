For a couple months I have been accumulating paintings and pictures so that I can have my own collection to draw inspiration and reference from. IΓÇÖm torrenting these so other artists and art appreciators can have them for viewing pleasure

Folders are split into smaller folders containing >100 items for faster loading

INSPIRATION
-This folder contains around 700 pieces of art work
-use it to study the masters 
-get inspiration (hence the name) when you fall into an art block

REFERENCE
-This folder contains around 400 items
-mainly contains photographs
-use this is for references in anatomy, texture, landscape, fashion, and others
-.PSD's are collages with certain objects in mind, you can resize individual photos without losing resolution

SOURCES
Many things in these folders are quickly saved and may not have the sources listed. If it is sourced the title of the work or artist should be contained in the file name. If you interested in who painted or photographed different pieces that don't contain a source, use a backwards image search or mail me with the file name and I can find it for you. If you feel peeved by a particular un-sourced picture, leave a comment and I will change it on the next update.
