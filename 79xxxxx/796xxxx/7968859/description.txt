Blue Peter 2012 Christmas Special
BBC

It's one of the highlights of the Blue Peter year - the
Christmas special. Helen and Barney are outside the
studio singing Christmas songs and carols with hundreds
of children.

Helen shows you a brilliant chocolate gift to make for
your friends, there are presents for the pets and we
find out what wishes you have for the festive season.
