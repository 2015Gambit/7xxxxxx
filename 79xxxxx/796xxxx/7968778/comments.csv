,xkenya1,2012-12-29T08:30Z,"Hey Daman, big fan of your torrents. Just wondering if you had an approximate date on the Steins Gate part 2 dub. I just don't check back often and would like to get it as soon as you decide to upload.
Thanks."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-29T08:30Z,"Kerero is a long series and is not even complete yet, basically is a waste of time. "
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-29T08:41Z,"xkenya, IDK havent had time to really start doing it, since new years is coming. 
ill probably have it up sometime in January. not sure"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-29T10:15Z,"Beggars can't be choosers, AnimeLife. It's not wise to bite the hand that feeds you. Daman doesn't have to do this at all, so let's just be grateful he goes to the trouble of uploading anything at all. 

As Daman has already stated, some people do actually like Pokemon, whether it be for nostalgia's sake or not. "
,Daww,2012-12-29T11:12Z,"Animelife, You shouldn't complain Daman can upload or not whatever he chooses we are just lucky enough to be able to download from him. ^_^"
,dantedmc22,2012-12-29T13:48Z,hey can u upload Dance in the Vampire Bund and BLOOD-C and Murder Princess and Corpse Princess: Shikabane Hime n english dub thanks if u can
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-29T19:03Z,"Yeah Lost_Leaf beggars  can expect what they want if they act good lots of people are doing it right now so dont give me stuff which is like putting salt into the sea .As for you Daww yes your right that were so lucky that we can download from daman and he uploads (the source of free great animes in the world) but you know why im so enthusiastic about keroro its because that daman said yes he was going to upload it.

But he went to uploading dragonboxes which are ok but same time fantastic . Im not too fond of the show because the show take 10 episodes for a fight seriusly im not kidding about it"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-30T05:20Z,"I don't understand what the problem is. Daww practically reiterated what I said, and I then provided you with Daman's reason for uploading Pokemon. Why are you upset? 

"
,mooserocka,2012-12-30T05:58Z,I hate the fact that pokemon is being uploaded but beggers cant be choosers. These are free and he did update my anime colection. I actually for once understand what anime life is saying he wants his picks other then the crap that is poke poke. But its up to daman. LAtely the choices have not been good but nothing new has been released also. BLOOD c is comming soon when will you have that daman!?!?!?
,mooserocka,2012-12-30T06:08Z,SORRY daman i kept saying 006 i meant when will you release the anime NO 6
,mooserocka,2012-12-30T06:13Z,"DANTED i also am asking for blood c. HE has ALREADY released vampire bund, Murder princess, and corpse princess im not sure though because its a female lead and he said he does not like them but im 100% sure about vampire bund and murder princess. Just scroll back he prob released them 4-5 months ago."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-30T10:19Z,"lol No.6 is a gay anime dude, and that is the genre i hate the most lol, Im never going to release that anime, "
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-30T10:20Z,"dance in teh vampire bund is not female lead, but male lead, and co female lead."
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-30T10:49Z,No its fine even thou that we cant have our hope on what daman uploads cuz hes gotta get the blurays/dvd /or other torrents from somewhere or maybe his friends .But whatever hate to say its true you cant choose when your a beggar .But sometimes promise cant always be trusted too guys  . OH Yeah Lost_Leaf im not really upset but just being the 2nd part of nature
,mooserocka,2012-12-30T20:50Z,Ok well WHAT GENREis 006. I have no info on it except reviews which i heard was good. What is bad about it? And when you mean gay do you mean like sucks or like gravitation?  Sometimes i cant tell weather you release anime for the public or for yourself lol. Cause pokemon is the lamest of ALL the anime. In MY OPINION. I never said ANYTHING about vampire bund being a female lead i SAID SAYA in blood plus. I was saying how BLOOD c is supposed to be awesome. So what is wrong with 006 i just want to know i cant find any info on it. Other then its reviews.
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-31T01:59Z,"Lol Moose. Daman does only release Anime that he has a personal interest in (unless he has the DVD or Blu-Ray lying around for whatever reason). Why at all does he upload torrents in the first place? It's a personal hobby of sharing his interests. He uploaded Pokemon because it's nostalgic to him, back in the days when it was actually enjoyable to some people. 

No normal person would go to the trouble of doing something they don't like. Which is why Daman's not going to upload Anime that are bad in his opinion. "
,mooserocka,2012-12-31T05:47Z,He uploads PLENTY that are bad lol. I just liked how he put out anything new. He has also said MANY times he didnt like what he put out. Most the time he does not have a blu ray lying around cause he releases it 4 months before the release date on the ones im talking about. I asked a question what kind of gay did he mean by no6. Is it like gravition gay or just stinks gay. I dont understand cause i have not seen it. Only heard it was a heartwarming and good anime. Whay genre is it? I still do no understand the female lead thing either because There are better anime where there is a female lead well without fanservice. I dont really like anime with a male lead most of the time they are the same whiney lil high school kid that is shy of girls thats the typical anime guy. Or the brooding guy that doesnt talk much and is emo like squall in ff8. Its ok though thats what he likes and he wont put out my shangri la which was SO good and i wanted to finish so bad cause i dont want to buy the first box set for 2 epidodes cause i watched up to epidode 6. If i can just see up to the second box set i would buy it. Someone please explain what genre no6 is that is refused to be shown is it like a bad anime? im confused.
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-31T06:54Z,"Yes, plenty that are bad to you or even me, but to Daman? He wouldn't upload a torrent he has zero personal interest or purpose in. Unless there were an incredibly high demand, like with Steins;Gate, but your requests are more personal. 

By gay I'm fairly sure he meant that it just isn't a series he likes: It's an adventure, drama, psychological, science fiction set in a post-apocalyptic dystopia. Though this alone may not be his reason for his dislike, he may just not have liked the story. 

And there are probably a lot of good Anime with female leads, but that doesn't mean that Daman will necessarily like them. In summary, generally speaking, it comes down to what Daman wants to upload. If it's female-based it's likely he won't want to upload it. 

"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-31T08:14Z,"Lost leaf, actually i mean it literally the anime No.6 is gay, is Shounen Ai "
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-31T19:51Z,i support moose for hating pokemon and db for db its for slow fights and for pokemon its because those are kids show
,mooserocka,2013-01-03T00:10Z,So what if its gay daman. LOL so you wont upload something because 2 guys are in love. 70% of anime says pedofilia is ok  AND BELEIVE ME THAT IS THE FARTHEST THING FROM O !!!!!! ITs just anime. If its a love story its a love story. Sure ide prefer guy and girl but i actually watched gravitation and it wasnt that bad. I did not know this i still would watch no6 if you put it up though just to give it a chance. Even though there is 2 gay people the story may be good. Im sensing a weird no female no gays vibe but its your uploads. Just weird reasoning to never upload something because of females or gays. O well you give us all the good man anime so cant complain that much.
,mooserocka,2013-01-07T03:34Z,I just duno whats wrong with women and gays weird.
