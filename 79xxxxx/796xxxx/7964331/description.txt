Predictive Astrology: The Eagle and the Lark
Format: PDF

For serious astrologers, this book is full of predictive techniques that really work, including cycles, transits, returns, progressions, eclipses, and the clearest explanation of the Saros cycles ever! Describes luminary and planetary arcs, and how to use transits to set up time maps. Brady also interprets progressed planets, waxing and waning orbs, planets changing signs, retrograde motion of transits and lunar phases and how they operate in predictive work.
