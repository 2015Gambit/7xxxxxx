Originally conceived as a simple recording production, Les Miserables evolved 
quickly into one of the premiere theater events of the 1980s. Theatrically on 
par with The Phantom of the Opera, Les Miz is drawn from the Victor Hugo 
novel of the same name. The story chronicles the life of Jean Valjean, a 
simple Frenchman who was arrested as a youth for stealing a loaf of bread. 
After serving five years for that crime, as well as an additional 14 for 
attempted escape, Valjean is released on parole. Upon changing his name 
and eluding his parole officer, Valjean becomes the surrogate father of a 
young girl and a mayor as the French Revolution sets in. As the war rages, 
he finds that he cannot change the man he is. Les Miserables is typical of 
theater in the '80s, with extravagant effects and large full-cast numbers. The 
beautiful score is full of emotion and humor, including such memorable and 
noteworthy songs as "Look Down," "Do You Hear the People Sing?," "Bring 
Him Home," "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables," and the ubiquitous "On My 
Own." The original London cast recording is considered by many to be 
superior to various other releases of Les Miz, including the Broadway cast. 
Colm Wilkinson and Frances Ruffelle originate here the roles they played in 
the Broadway cast, joined by Patti LuPone and Michael Ball. An important 
addition to a collection for those who want a nearly complete version but who 
don't need the full symphonic version.
