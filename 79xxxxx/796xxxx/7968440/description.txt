|                                            Release Notes

This two-disc set of R&B hits was released early in 2009, well before the
emergence of any big singles released during that calendar year. In fact,
there isn't much concentration on hits from the previous year, either --
though Usher's "Love in This Club," Jordin Sparks and Chris Brown's "No
Air," Jennifer Hudson's "Spotlight," and John Legend's "Green Light" are
included. Instead, R&B Love Songs 2009 skips across three decades, reaching
as far back as 1981 for Luther Vandross' "Never Too Much," and it doesn't
even limit itself to love songs or straight R&B (Missy Elliott's "The
Rain," Anthony Hamilton's "Comin from Where I'm From," Sean Paul's "Like
Glue"). Even with the confusion, there's no denying that this is a
well-selected, wide-ranging set that should appeal to just about any fan of
modern R&B. You can't go wrong with a compilation that includes Anita
Baker's "Sweet Love," Keith Sweat's "I Want Her," Angie Stone's "Wish I
Didn't Miss You," and Omarion's "Ice Box."
