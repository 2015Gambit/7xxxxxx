Muleskinner Jones - Terrible Stories (2002) mp3


The Muleskinner Jones debut EP is a malevolent melee of traditional murder ballads that left critics ecstatic and exasperated in equal measure.

This is a product of a twisted mind and a sick musical imagination. These tales of murder and dismemberment are sung in strangely real voices with instruments sometimes just over the edge of being in tune. Sod the country revival - this is the sound of someone locked in an Appalachian mountain log cabin with a case of Jack Daniels, 10 feet of snow outside, too many sharp implements. and some suspicious lumps under the floorboards. 

There are Nick Cave comparisons to make but this has the metallic taste of madness on top and, most frighteningly, these are all traditional songs (albeit from the repertoire of the damned). I warn you, thisll grow on you and you DONT want to be singing these to yourself at the bus stop.
