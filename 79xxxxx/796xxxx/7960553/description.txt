Overall a decent show...No major standouts other than Dupree's.  The
next legendary night overshadowed this one.  However, it was still
a fun show that I attended (mostly due to my pal having the flu and
being out of it during the show).  He was pretty grumpy and yelling
during the setbreak of how bad the show is.  I remember at least 20
people listening intently to him and laughing hysterically.
