Nobody would believe that the immensity of the universe was created based on 5 elements (faith, courage, freedom, wisdom and love) and God has created every living creature on it from water.

Like any living space, Sibull requires of these 5 elements to maintain the stay of its own citizens to a life of peace and harmony.

A lack of one of these elements or all, Sibull residents have suffered drastic changes in the functioning of their body, they lost the harmony and can not love, laugh and enjoy the life. They live in the hope that one day everything will be as before.

Sili and Bili, two friends with little anatomy but with radiant courage, took the hard work from the exciting journey of finding the 5 elements. It will not be easy, nonconformities are endless. Dragons of different civilizations, radioactive plants, misleading roads, powerful leaders are just some of the many obstacles that impede constantly our characters to deposit the stones (elements) in the sacred place. Doing so, the binding energy of these five stones will give pass to the next level, which complexity does not equal the previous.
