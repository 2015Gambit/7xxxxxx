,akosiroel,2012-12-28T02:07Z,I wish people would just put their A/V rating instead of the link to the film's imdb page. We people know how to use google after all.
,magredana,2012-12-28T03:57Z,"I do wish you would fuck off writing your stupid little comment about people taking the time and effort to paste in the IMDB link thus saving us all the time of doing it on every fucking torrent you come across .

Seriously, why would you even care enough to copy and paste that on sooooo many torrents you twat?!"
,akosiroel,2012-12-28T04:20Z,"Why? Because I care about the A/V rating more than anything else, that's why. And if you consider going to the film's imdb page as taking too much time, then you need to reassess your fucking life."
,hilmarp,2012-12-28T16:25Z,"I for one appreciate the imdb link, keep it up and thank you."
,Billythebat,2012-12-29T08:13Z,"Nice linkage there with the IMDB, that was awesome.  
It is perfectly logical to put up a link for IMDB, as like me i dont know what the film is about, once i know i will be interested i download it. The link saves many 100 of thousands of copy and pasting into google etc...
Then after i have downloaded it put a V/ A/ M score.
Nice work Lserevil.

,BreezeTDK,2012-12-29T08:39Z,"I wish akosiroel would put an A/V rating instead of bitching about other people not doing it.  Thank you for the link LserEvil (laser, lesser, loser...sorry it's a habit).  By the way, most A/V ratings are not reliable.  I love the one guy who also adds in his own rating guide.  The only bad part is that his guide shows blu ray as 10 and dvd as 9...WTF?  If blu ray is 10 then DVD should be like 5.  Right?

Thanks eztv!"
,hawkesk57,2012-12-29T10:47Z,"LOTS of times I get the IMDB link, see it's a REAL FUCKING LOW RATE, so I don't download it, but I STILL paste the link."
,sillig50,2012-12-29T19:54Z,"Any links and constructive comments are always welcome and that includes both imdb links & audio/visual ratings. On the other hand foul language reduces a message to nought, if someone can't bother to write or speak decently then really what worth can you place on their thought process? "
,BreezeTDK,2012-12-29T22:17Z,"@sillig50

So, should everyone hold it against you because of your bad grammar?  That is my opinion.  Also, I am sorry for making fun of the guy who displays his own video rating guide.  Have a Happy New Year!"
,ionnrachtagh,2013-01-06T10:04Z,Wouldn't all your comments on IMDB links be more appropriate in a forum? After 10 comments I still have no idea on V/A. Hello people get it together.
