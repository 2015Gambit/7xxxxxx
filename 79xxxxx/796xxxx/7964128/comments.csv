,enonumus,2013-01-06T01:53Z,"A8/V8 (for a Cam), overall it's definitely watchable. It's not as dark as most cams, though there's definitely a lot of detail lost to the dark areas. Audio is pretty good. The biggest problems are the constant horizontal scan lines and the large amount of screen that's been cropped away, so faces are often cut off, but if you don't want to go see it at the theater for whatever reason and you can't wait for DVD quality or better, this is watchable.

Thanks! "
