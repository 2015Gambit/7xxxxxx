Fundamental of Quantum Mechanics 

by 

V. A. Fock.

Vladimir Aleksandrovich Fock was one of the group of brilliant
physics theoreticians whose work built the magnificent edifice of
the quantum theory.

The author's main purpose is to introduce the reader to a new
set of ideas differing greatly from the classical theory. He has
endeavoured to avoid using images from the classical theory as
being inapplicable to quantum physics. Rather, he has attempted
to familiarize the reader with the basic concepts underlying a
quantum description of the states of atomic systems.

The second edition of this book, unlike the first, devotes a separate
chapter to the nonrelativistic theory of the electron spin (Pauli's
theory of the electron) and contains a chapter on the many-electron
problem of quantum mechanics. In addition, some of the author's
findings have been incorporated as separate sections. Otherwise, the
subject matter of the book (both the mathematical theory and its
physical interpretation) remains the same, except for certain new
formulations of an epistemological character (the concepts of
relativity with respect to the means of observation and of potential
possibility), which has necessitated changing the expression "the
statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics" to "the probabilistic
interpretation". The new formulations are more precise than the
previous ones.

The title of the book speaks for itself. The word "fundamentals"
can be understood as "basic principles" or as "introductory
facts".

This book was translated from the Russian by Eugene Yankovsky. The
book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1978 with a reprint
in 1982.
