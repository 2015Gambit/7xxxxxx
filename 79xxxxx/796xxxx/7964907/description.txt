Information
------------------------------

In three days of savagery the picturesque town Gainesville Florida is sent reeling with shock. Five university students are brutally attacked and killed. As officers meticulously investigate the death scenes, they realise this is no average murderer. This killer knows how to cover his tracks. Each scene has been literally scrubbed clean and the bodies washed to eliminate hairs or body fluids. There are no fingerprints anywhere. The murder weapon is nowhere to be found.
