Hollywood actor Sir Patrick Stewart tells the enthralling story of Sir Stirling 
Moss's glittering race career. The pair travel to Florence in a classic Gull 
Wing Mercedes to retrace the route of Italy's most famous road race, the Mille 
Miglia, and discuss how Stirling's near-fatal crash may have been the best 
thing that ever happened to him. Yet how will Sir Patrick cope with the raw 
power of the era when he drives a 1957 Formula 1 car at the scene of Stirling's 
historic British Grand Prix victory?
