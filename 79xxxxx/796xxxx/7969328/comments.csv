,FelatioSucks,2012-12-29T15:58Z,"according to a quick google it's region a, released by Mill Creek Entertainment. which is also found on the disk posted above!"
,ofpirate,2012-12-29T22:02Z,confident its legit.. DownTYU is solid!
,ilnot1,2012-12-30T00:31Z,"I didn't mean to suggest this wasn't legit, I've just been waiting so long for this to come out on Bluray and I still can't find it anywhere (USA, Europe, Japan) to buy. Not even a release date. That is what's so confounding, that there can be a rip something that there isn't even a whiff of being available for legitimate sale anywhere. Kudos and my thanks to those responsible."
