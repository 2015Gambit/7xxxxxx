 Len Goodman s Dancing Feet: The British Ballroom Story

  Len Goodman explores ballroom dancing in the early 20th century,
a time when it was considered a radical and trendy form of 
entertainment. The Strictly Come Dancing judge visits Blackpool
and joins professional dancer Erin Boag to practise some classic 
moves, before heading to London where he revisits the Rivoli, his 
favourite venue from his youth. The presenter also meets singers
and musicians who still remember the golden era of ballroom and 
discovers why rules were introduced to govern steps, movements
and music.
