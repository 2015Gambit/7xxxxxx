,rosstitute,2012-12-28T12:40Z,More info needed. AC3 audio encoded?
,rosstitute,2012-12-28T15:47Z,No AC3/Dolby Digital surround track so not the full iTunes rip. Rather a lot of bandwidth wasted because the uploader didn't give the full details.

,peti789,2012-12-28T20:11Z,FUCK the asswipes complaining! Thanks bro!
,rosstitute,2012-12-28T21:29Z,"Firstly peti789, you're a twat.

Secondly, thanks for the upload dabadguy69. I understand the need to reduce the file size and not include AC3, but you need to put more detail in the description to let us know. Also the bitrate, resolution etc would be handy."
