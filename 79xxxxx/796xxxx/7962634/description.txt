Book Description
This popular pocket book presents the practical aspects of diagnosis and management for postgraduate dental trainees in hospitals or general and community dental practice. With coverage of oral medicine and pathology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, including traumatology, and relevant aspects of sedation, anaesthetics and therapeutics, this book bridges the gap between undergraduate dental and medical knowledge, allowing the dental professional to be able to take a full medical history, examine the patient, perform the appropriate investigations, appreciate the patient's medical problems and their implications on dental management, and finally enabling them to treat their patients in a safe and effective way.
