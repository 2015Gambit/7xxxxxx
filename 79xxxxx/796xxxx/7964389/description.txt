A take off on the oft-told tale of a student professor relationship, it stars Mia, one of my favorites, as the sexy student and Bobby Johnston, who describes himself as a "literary professor." It is a good natured film with Mia displaying her wiles. It also has the indomitable Kim Dawson in it. Catch it on late night TV and tape it as I did. You won't be disappointed, as it should be a welcome addition to your soft core collection.
