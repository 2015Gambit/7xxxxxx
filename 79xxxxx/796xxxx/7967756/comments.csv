OS X 10.8.2

Installed Game to my games folder on a Separate drive... Installed the fix to the same folder. Launched the game which bounded briefly in the dock and then quit!

Absolutely NO information provided at all with this torrent. Thanks for Nada!"
,bjornagainswede,2012-12-29T18:55Z,"Update...

Fire up terminal and do a change ownership on the game file

cjhmod -R 755 (drag in the game file here leaving a space after the 755)
chown -R 0:0 (drag in the app file as before!)

Fixes the bounce and launch issue... wait a few and the game fires up!"
,bjornagainswede,2012-12-29T19:22Z,"Update...

Fixed using terminal

fire up terminal is su mode 

chmod -R 755 (drag game app into teminal leaving a space after the 5
chown -R 0:0 (drag app into terminal again leaving a space...

done.

Game now launches but give it a minute or 3 to start!"
