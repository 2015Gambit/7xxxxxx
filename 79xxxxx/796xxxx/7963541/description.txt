Stephen Fry: Gadget Man
Stephen Fry welcomes us into his wonderful world of tech, from the everyday to the extraordinary. Stephen doesn't live life like the rest of us. He doesn't get caught in traffic jams, doesn't have to push his own shopping trolley or even hold his own toothbrush - instead he relies on his collection of trusty gadgets to make his life run smoothly. In this show Stephen tries out all the products and prototypes he can lay his hands on, gadgets from the future, gadgets from the past, life-changing ones and sweet little gizmos that will change the way you live your life tomorrow. And he does it all in the company of some of his famous friends. Every week Stephen also creates his very own super gadget. Or at least tries to.

He road-tests some of the latest gym gadgets and gets a makeover from Amy Childs, from The Only Way is Essex, using some weird and wonderful beauty devices. Some of the gadgets on the show include an app which predicts how long you will live, the world's most incredible treadmill and a device that claims to make you slimmer in just 30 minutes. And Stephen attempts to build the ultimate running machine that will enable him to race against double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes.
