PREZ "disciples" Perkins and Kamuca play simpatico with nearly indistinguishable

"light tone."  There is no battling to be found here.  It's full co-operative

harmonizing.  When these two play unison lines it's like a flanger or chorus

generator has been switched on....their tones are that similar with Lester Young's

sound and choice of notes.  This is not hard bop...more like swing bop


This is textbook West Coast Jazz sound..heavy on the ballad content


If you like Getz or early Zoot your ears will be happy.
