,GODblezhackers,2012-12-26T20:19Z,"it wont work, it says cant detect version number, installation aborted...is there a way to fix this?"
,jcgeny,2012-12-26T20:26Z,"game has some nice thing , but looks half-finished with second part that has no sens .
the worst thing is the ""no save"" during mission.... this crazy shit that makes game unplayable near end .

so Mr.Stifmeister please add something like to the patch : the save [during missions] ;']"
,GODblezhackers,2012-12-26T20:29Z,"ohh shit my bad, i was in a rush i 4Got to use the crackkk ^__^"
,theresdividnglines,2012-12-26T21:01Z,"This update/patch doesn't break previous save files like the previous 1.04 (and 1.03) update, does it?"
,yoep,2012-12-26T21:24Z,Can someone tell me where the reloaded version saves the save data?
,schakalen95,2012-12-26T23:48Z,"Thank you you dumb bastards called Reloaded, now my save file is gone, thank you very much!"
,morbidmurderer,2012-12-26T23:59Z,I think I read if you still have say a version 1.02 crack then copy that over instead of this cracks and your saves might come back. I'm still on 1.02.
,Performer81,2012-12-27T00:17Z,file sizes of the crack files are different than the other 2 1.04 crackz. Why? whats different?
,schakalen95,2012-12-27T02:01Z,"I had the 1.03 patch installed and the crack from 1.03, but i will searrch for other cracks and see if it works"
,Viciously,2012-12-27T04:22Z,Thanks.
,Viciously,2012-12-27T14:27Z,Fuck. My saves are gone. 
,Viciously,2012-12-27T14:35Z,"Guys, just put the crack files of your previous update, back, and saves will work. Fuck, I am relieved."
,coltraz,2012-12-27T16:51Z,Does this come with a new crack? If so can we not just neglect to copy it into our install dir? 
,simolino,2012-12-28T02:09Z,"This fucks up your game saves. Just warning you, but it does fix the game really well. Since it works better, you might as well start it all over again with the better experience."
,wazim123,2012-12-28T05:02Z,guys i have the extracted version of fc3 .... now the problem is i cant update the game cause the update cant find the installation folder ... what should i do someone plz help...... plz

,LloydTempleton,2012-12-28T12:16Z,"The update works perfectly, and what a great game.

Is it possible to change the name ""ReLOADed"" that appears at the start screen?"
,yesterdays_pirate,2012-12-28T12:47Z,"Ok, folks. Here's a fix for those who are having SAVING problems. 

First of all, when I first played this game for the second time, I noticed that my saves were greyed out, only the New Game option was active. 

I tried every fix in PB but to no avail. But finally, the fix was more simple than I thought. At least for me. 

I've managed to reproduce the problem and the fix 100%.

I noticed that your saves files in your C:->ProgramData->Orbit->46
only works when you delete them and repaste them again. Viola!

Its weird, but I've managed to reproduce the problem and fix 100%. The only drawback is that you need to do this every time you want to play the game. No problem for me. It's a simple procedure. 


Try it, and tell me if it works.

Btw, this should go without saying: you need to add the -offline parameters in your FC3 shortcut. You know the drill:)"
,Marciolii,2012-12-28T17:41Z,Anyone know why I don't float during the mushroom trip and why the boulders don't move like it supposed to?
,hakim462000,2012-12-29T14:26Z,"Hi guys, i'm using R.G Mechanic's repack and all i got was ""Could not retrieve version number! Installation will be aborted."" HELP D:"
,barakuda1111,2012-12-29T16:03Z,"I have this version installed http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7869515/Far_Cry_3-RELOADED

If i install this update will my save games be gone?

With current version there's a problem with Dennis  calls repeating all the time so im thinking of updating but dont wana lose my saves."
,noobfor,2012-12-30T15:53Z,does anyone found a savegame fix yet?
,koopatroopa_15,2012-12-30T23:15Z,"This seems to work just fine. Played through to the first part where you can actually save your own game ( not autosave ) and was able to quit the game then have my save still be there. 

Installed the Reloaded Far Cry 3 version fresh then followed instructions in this update. THANKS FOR THIS I was going to die if I had to play through the first scenes again lol. "
,djozhedebeljan,2012-12-30T23:46Z,thank u!
,civoniz,2012-12-31T03:24Z,"If what koopatroopa_15 says is true. (After getting update 1.04) Play the game until you reach the city where you meet david, 1) save, 2) quit game, 3) swap Orbit/46 files, 4) Play YOUR own saves. 

Can someone confirm this?"
,bungunners,2012-12-31T10:27Z,"I started new and played all the way up to the part where you defeat the band at the camp and go off on your own to meet the Dr. for the first time.  I took the old saves that I had and replaced the new ones that were created and when I started the game, It just gave me the option to start new game.  The save files are different sizes so I tried the combination of just the save files then just the .ini files and every combination of those.  Nothing has worked.  The only way to get my old saves working was using the 1.02 crack.   "
,yesterdays_pirate,2013-01-01T01:22Z,"@bungunners, Maybe something is replacing a FC3.dll or FC3_d3d11.dll?

This is common when using a modded or  cracked game, and the crack/mod FC3.dll or FC3_d3d11.dll you replaced is not edited to use cracked uplay_r1_loader.dll and ubiorbitapi_r2_loader.dll.

Btw, you need to use a hex editor(free) to make the changes.
"
,bungunners,2013-01-01T18:17Z,So are you saying that this is the fix for 1.02 saves on a 1.04 updated game? That is the only issue I'm having... along with everybody else who updated from 1.02 to 1.04.  
,bungunners,2013-01-01T18:30Z,"@yesterdays_pirate.
So is this the fix for everybody who is having a problem using 1.02 saves on a 1.04 updated game?  Or is your issue different?  I can save new games just fine with all versions.  It's just using those older saves on the newer updated game that is the problem."
,Bean-Bandit,2013-01-04T14:30Z,Anybody having a issue where the autosave is always on and saving? I just updated and after selling stuff in the shop the autosave will start up to save but never go away.
,civoniz,2013-01-05T05:40Z,"SOLUTION: Use Update 1.02 !

Worked for me, i can now play my Saves again. and the game is not too bad (IF you alter the GameSettings file in the Documents folder, YOUR GAME WILL CRASH!, so just elave it alone.)"
,zdubinit,2013-01-06T04:44Z,"I've been playing FC3 Reloaded un-patched since release. I did not patch to 1.02 or 1.03 or anything.

I just installed this 1.04 patch from reloaded, and all my previous save games work fine. 

Just thought I'd mention my experience. "

,Bean-Bandit,2013-01-07T14:38Z,Since I really didn't play that much my auto save that wouldn't stop was fixed by uninstalling and deleting my saved games and restarting. That was the 1.04 patch.
,LanceLionroar,2013-01-07T18:46Z,"""Could not retrieve version number! Installation will be aborted."" Fuck this shit."
