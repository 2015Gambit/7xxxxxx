Christmas is a time for charity, hope and
goodwill to all men - but for Horrible
Histories it's a time of farting jesters,
finding bacon in your Christmas card, and
having your dinner confiscated by Oliver Cromwell.

Horrible Histories Christmas Special reveals
all this and more in a foul festive
treat - the smelliest, silliest, goriest
stories about everyone's favourite time of year.

This episode showcases bizarre Yuletide
absurdities from over the centuries with
a unique blend of sketches, pastiche and
song - a foul and festive treat. Revel
in the smelliest, silliest and goriest
stories about everyone's favourite time of year.
