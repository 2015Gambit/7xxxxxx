DUNGEON KEEPER 2
VERSION: 1.8 + HW acc. patch



Hi, this is my first torrent here on PB :)

I've managed (well technically not me, some russian guys and the dedicated community for DK2) to mix two versions together to make a version that uses some sort of graphic emulation for DK2. 

The game works PERFECTLY. I've played for about 3h yesterday (singleplayer AND MULTIPLAYER) and it works flawless - NO CRASHES, NO SOFTWARE RENDERING, AND THE FRAMERATE IS MOSTLY VERY SMOOTH (~50 FPS).

Just for comparison I have Windows 7 x64, 4GB RAM and ATI HD 6670.

Just follow the bellow instructions EXACTLY, and it will work:



INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Mount the .iso (with Daemon tools etc..)

2. Install the game

3. Copy contents from the "patch1" folder into where you installed the game

4. THEN copy contents from the "patch2" folder into where you installed the game

5. ALWAYS run the DKII-dx.exe NOT DKII.exe

6. ????

7. PROFIT!
