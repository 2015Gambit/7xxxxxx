,cf38,2012-12-30T18:34Z,"Snakeye

Can you log in to the Support database of Aerosoft 

http://support.aerosoft.com/support.php?

And make the paintkits available for all of us by uploading on tpb please? "
,alef1995,2012-12-30T22:56Z,"upload VRS TACKPACK PLIZ AND SUPERBUG! 

HAPPY NEW YEAR =D"

,cf38,2012-12-31T09:27Z,It's only the Neo/Sharklet A320 version though bro. To get the normal CFM and IAE A320 & A321 paintkits you have to download them through that support place.
[T],_SnakEye,2012-12-31T21:30Z,"it was downloaded from the Support place.
that is what they had there."
,ovracvr,2013-01-01T08:40Z,As a requirement ..you need a joystick with throttle control to operate this aircraft.. Is there a alternative? Let me know.. Thanks SnakeEye.
,cf38,2013-01-01T13:45Z,"I think they've updated the support database bro,  to include more paintkits rather than the default  one which means you can only paint neo aircraft
