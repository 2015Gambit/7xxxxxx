Aerodynamics 1
 Fundamentals of Theory. Aerodynamics of an Airfoil and a Wing 

by 

N. F. Krasnov

The present textbook, in addition to the general laws of flow of a
fluid, treats the application of aerodynamics, chiefly in rocketry and
modern hi-speed aviation. The book consists of two parts, each forming
a separate volume.  The first of them concerns the fundamental
concepts and definitions of aerodynamirs and the theory of flow over
an airfoil and a wing, including an unsteady  flow (Chapters
1-9), while the second describes the aerodynamic design of craft
and their individual parts (Chapters 10-15). The two parts are
designed for use in a two semester course of aerodynamics, although
the first part can be used  independently by those interested in
individual problems of theoretical aerodynamics.


This book was translated from the Russian by G. Leib. The
  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1985.
