Book Description
The Oxford Handbook of Dialysis provides a patient-centred and comprehensive guide to all aspects of dialysis, covering everything from patient preparation and details of both haeom- and peritoneal dialysis, to continuous haemofiltration techniques and complications of end stage kidney disease.

In this new edition, all sections have been completely updated, with new material on a multitude of topics including haemofiltration, monitoring techniques, infection prevention, new PD fluids, trials in haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, integrated care, role of predialysis nurses, supportive care, care of dying patients, pain control and newer drugs such as darbepoietin, new vitamin D analogues, new anticoagulants and phosphate binders. With new chapters on transplantation and dialysis in Acute Kidney Injury, and references to the most up-to-date clinical guidelines, this handbook continues to be the essential, compact resource for anyone managing patients with end stage renal failure.
