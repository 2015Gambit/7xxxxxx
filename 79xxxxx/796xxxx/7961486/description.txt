The Banco Central burglary at Fortaleza was the theft of about R$ 160 million 

from the vault of the Banco Central branch located in Fortaleza, in the state 

of Cear√°, Brazil. It is one of the world's largest heists. In the aftermath of 

the burglary, of the 25 persons thought to be involved, just eight had been 

arrested, and R$7.35 million recovered, up to the end of 2005. In addition, 

several of the gang are thought to have been victims of kidnapping, and one, 

Luis Fernando Ribeiro, thought to have been the mastermind of the operation, 

was killed by kidnappers after a ransom was paid. Arrests and recovery of the 

money, as well as kidnapping and murder of the perpetrators, have been ongoing, 

though most are still unaccounted for
