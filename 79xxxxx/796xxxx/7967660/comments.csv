,iCondemned_88,2012-12-30T19:34Z,It doesn't work. :/
,iCondemned_88,2012-12-30T19:36Z,You can't play it unless you active the game through EA. :/ Might as well go buy the game.
,qazxsw158,2013-01-01T03:14Z,what are the instructions for downloading and installing the game
,dylank22,2013-01-04T01:52Z,"OK I figured it out. Copy the dragonage2.exe from the crack folder into:
Contents>Resources>Transgaming>C_drive>Program Files>Dragon Age> bin_ship
This should disable the activation process and allow you to play the game perfectly. I did not update it so I am not sure if it will work if you do. Hope this helps anyone having problems"
