Eyes That See in the Dark is the 12th solo studio album by Kenny Rogers, first released by RCA Records in August 1983. This album has sold 15 million copies world-wide. It marks Barry Gibb's third production project of the 1980s outside of The Bee Gees. Gibb wrote most of the songs that were more reminiscent of Kenny Rogers's days with the First Edition. 

At first, ΓÇÿIslands in the StreamΓÇÖ was not a duet and Rogers was not happy with the recording and only after Dolly Parton was brought in and recorded the song as a duet did the song take off. It became a major hit, reaching no.1 on both the Billboard pop and country charts. 

The version of ΓÇÿI Will Always Love YouΓÇÖ featured on this album was written by Barry and Maurice Gibb, and is hence not the same as the more famous song of the same name, which was written by Dolly Parton. However, Kenny Rogers had also recorded a version of the Dolly Parton song for his 1996 album Vote for Love. (wikipedia)
