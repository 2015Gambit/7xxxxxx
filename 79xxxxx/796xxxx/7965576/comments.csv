Merry Christmas!"
,Jer88,2012-12-28T11:50Z,"This is a great series, gets a little romantic towards the middle, but redeems itself again and again. Stay with it and you'll enjoy it. Thanks Eromai!"
,Eromai,2012-12-29T02:51Z,"Thanks, this is one of my favourite animes too!"
,bailtail,2013-01-04T06:05Z,"I'm downloading a few eps at a time because I have a data cap, and I found that ep 3 is actually ep 7. Does anyone know if it's just a accidental switch or if there is no ep 3?"
,bailtail,2013-01-04T06:22Z,"Nvm, it's the subs that effed up in the beginning..."
,Eromai,2013-01-05T15:17Z,"Not sure what you mean by wrong episode ordering but there is a certain desync problem in the intro because of those silly karaoke fonts from UTW. 

Though that's easily fixable by either a) following the intructions in the notes.txt or b) playing the vids in vlc player. People with fast computers won't even notice it if their machines can render it quick enough."
