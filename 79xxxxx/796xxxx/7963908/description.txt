CBeebies Christmas Panto: Cinderella
BBC

Cinderella lives with her father, Baron Hardup. They are
very poor and can't afford a TV to watch the dancing. At
the palace, Prince Charming has everything apart from rhythm!
The judges on the TV show give Prince Charming the lowest
score ever so he decides to quit. But a chance meeting with
a girl collecting firewood changes everything.

Will Cinderella go to the royal ball and will she find her
Prince Charming before the clock strikes midnight?
