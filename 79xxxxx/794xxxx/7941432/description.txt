I remember watching this movie at Christmas time when I was 10 years old.  I was obsessed with the Wizard of Oz, and must have watched this TV movie dozens of times.  It's very entertaining and very informative about the creation of the novel that has since become our Nation's first true American fairy tale.  I still enjoy watching this so much, and hopefully you will all enjoy it as well!  Happy Holidays!  :)
