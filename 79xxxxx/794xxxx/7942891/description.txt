Re-do of original file. believe it or not there were 2 pretty consequential words missing from the original edit which i only noticed when viewing the file through my wife's ipad. 2 verbs which make a hell of a difference.

So here we have the re-do of the file, this time as well, formatted through Calibre for your specific device so hopefully it sits and scrolls pleasingly for the eye. 

A Rising fall, book 1 in the dystopian trilogy entitled CITY:aliteraryconcerto

Complete copy of dystopian philosophical novel:  A Rising Fall by Irish/Australian philosopher & artist C. Sean McGee

I am publisher and writer of this work and am uploading to curious downloaders for free. If you want to support my art, you can buy a paperback copy of the book for US$20 and have something neat, attractive and tangible to sit on your dresser. If not, enjoy the free digital version. Either way, drop by to the sites mentioned at the end of the book and tell me what you think.

Thank you for your curiosity and enjoy. It's a hell of a ride.
