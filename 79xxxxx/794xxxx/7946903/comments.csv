however Im sure they have excusses or theories why its not today..

e.g. year 0 not counted in mayan calander so really 2013

or its just end of era.. a peak time.. we had big quakes leading up to it and we still will have quakes leading away from it"

He's framing prepping as something to do with 2012 doomsday/biblical prophecy, etc. Most preppers are preparing simply because of where the USA and the world is going based on public/political/financial policy in the USA and in other places in the world. Nothing to do with prophecies for most people."
