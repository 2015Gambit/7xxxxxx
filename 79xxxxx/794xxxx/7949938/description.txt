Donnie Darko doesn&#x27;t get along too well with his family, his teachers and his classmates; but he does manage to find a sympathetic friend in Gretchen, who agrees to date him. He has a compassionate psychiatrist, who discovers hypnosis is the means to unlock hidden secrets. His other companion may not be a true ally. Donnie has a friend named Frank - a large bunny which only Donnie can see. When an engine falls off a plane and destroys his bedroom, Donnie is not there. Both the event, and Donnie&#x27;s escape, seem to have been caused by supernatural events. Donnie&#x27;s mental illness, if such it is, may never allow him to find out for sure.
