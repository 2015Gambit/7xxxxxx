XXClone 0.58.0 - [cooldude187]


The simple way to clone a Windows disk to another disk, it makes a self-bootable clone of Windows system disk. Supports common internal disk drives (IDE, SATA, SCSI) and external USB/FIREWIRE drives. Competes with Norton Ghost, DriveImage, MaxBlast etc. This is much faster than any of them in typical daily backup.
