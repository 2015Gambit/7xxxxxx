,Gamble40k,2012-12-24T12:34Z,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone could please help me with a problem I've been having with games that use the Steam_api.dll crack.


Whenever I run a game that uses crack steam dlls, my legit steam games won't run properly. I tried installing cracked games on a seperate partition and blocking the game file in windows 7 firewall, but it still happens. The first time this happened, the conflict persisted through system restarts.. it kept saying that my game files were corrupt or something along those lines. It eventually took a system restore to get my valid steam games working without completely reinstalling. Since then I stopped trying to dl games that used cracked steam_api.dll, however I recently figured out that if I turned off Steam Client Service in task manager after I was finished playing the cracked game, then restarted steam, my valid steam games work fine.

My question is: 

how do I setup my cracked games so that they don't conflict with my legitimate steam games. Or is stopping the service in Task Manager and then restarting steam the only reliable way to do it?"

I know cause my graphic card only plays 10.1, i got error saying Error module: d3d11.dll, if anyone says its directx problem shut up, cause i tryed from CD runned from internet directly run directx update nothing. :// So guys if you wanna play 2012 games go to store buy new PC machine!!!"
