Looks like it's got a lot of support, but no one has said.

The scene4all release has a green skull in the comments saying it (the s4a release) was really jerky (though everyone else gave it high ratings)

Thx to MANTESH for the up!"

,libertaswv,2012-12-24T04:09Z,"Sincere thx, hawkesk57 - I appreciate it :)"
,libertaswv,2012-12-28T23:52Z,"This was a solid copy, for the record... Maybe a little dark, but complete and entirely watchable. I'd give it a 9/9 or 9/10. 

2 days ago, i was unable to find eng subs for this release. May well be some out there by now.

Thx to MANTESH and all seeders and leechers - Sincerely appreciated! "
