Sorry the quality is so bad. It's the only file currently available. Also, I apologize for no image link or standard IMDB. TPB didn't like the links for some reason.

THIS IS THE FRENCH AUDIO WITH NO ENGLISH VOICING AND NO SUBS.

I can't stress this enough. I don't want to hear any complaints about it not being in English. This just came out today, MoonScoop isn't officially subbing it, and no English Audio version exists. When it gets fansubbed, I'll upload that.

Since Code Lyoko is rather unpopular, I'll be seeding this for a while. If for some reason I'm not, email me at codelyokoe@yahoo.com. It may take me a while to reply... I don't check it too often. Be assured though, you'll get your file.

THIS FILE IS NOT MY WORK. CREDIT GOES TO EPISODESDECODELYOKO.COM FOR THE RECORDING.

Enjoy.
