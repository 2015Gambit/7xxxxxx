Smiley Lewis (1913-1966) was the unluckiest man in New Orleans. He hit on a formula for slow-rocking, small-band numbers like ΓÇÿThe Bells Are RingingΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿI Hear You KnockingΓÇÖ only to have Fats Domino come up behind him with similar music more ingratiatingly delivered. Lewis was practically drowned in Domino's backwash.
