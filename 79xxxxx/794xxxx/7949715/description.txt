Near India and Pakistan's border-town of Fatehpur, lives Ranjit Singh Choudhary who has been labeled as a rebel by his schoolmaster and his dad, Makhan's employer, Bade Thakur, as he could not stand the injustice that was meted to farmers like his dad, and his ancestors who had become economic slaves to the upper-caste Thakurs, who loaned them some money, mortgaged their land, made them toil in the fields, took away their crops, molested their women, and when they passed away, forced their children to take on the debt. Ranjit decides to leave for good, but does return on the very day of his dad's passing. He is asked to assume the loan left unpaid by his dad, when he refuses to do so, he is treated as a bandit, leading him to confront the corrupt Police Force. When Bade Thakur's daughter, Sumitra, who was Ranjit's childhood sweetheart, marries DSP Sultan Singh, a buffalo is slaughtered and left to rot in the community well...

This movie has my fav song sung by the immortal Lata Didi,
Zihal-e-muskeen maqun ba-ranjish, 
Bahaal-e-hijra bechara dil hai

[[Word meanings (Persian to English): Zihal = To notice or see, Muskeen = Poor, Maqun = Do not, 
Ba-ranjish = With enmity/anger, Bahaal = Recently, Hijr = Seperation

In English: Don't look at this poor heart with enmity,
It (the heart) is fresh with wounds of separation.]]
