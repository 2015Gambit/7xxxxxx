I get sooooo many indications from people that the best quality is what's really wanted.
Let's test that theory, shall we?
.
Started slow, but picking up peers along the way - welcome all.
.
The MKV, NFO are original BrRip 720p DTS audio. ALL credit to "TheWretched".
These have been available on UseNet the whole time.
I have only renamed them because "wthd-xiii-204-720p.mkv" looks stupid to me.
The original filename is within the original NFO, so if you're a purist - name them back.
The subtitles are mine, all mine from my dual AVI project of the same name.
That's why the subtitles are not inside the MKV.
.
I was hoping someone else would do this, because I hate really large files.
It takes forever for spillover even dedicating all my bandwidth.
Nine hours for the 201 seed, this is a little smaller.
If the interest is there for this, I'll get to the next one soonest.
.
There have been two torrents at present for ep 201 only, my 3-in-1
and an NLsubs version. Mine, you can get from:
.
XIII.The.Series.S02E01.(READ.DESC!!!).(3.quality.choices).(1.torrent)
Truncated on TPB to:
XIII.The.Series.S02E01.(READ.DESC!!!).(3.quality.choices).(1.tor
It's 2.8 GB instead of the 2.18 GB norm because it contains three resolutions.
If you can't choose to ignore the little ones, it's not that much extra.
.
And now I present 5 more files
