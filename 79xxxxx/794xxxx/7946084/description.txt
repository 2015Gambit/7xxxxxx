missing "LIBERTY" encore on all SBD sources

Notes:
At least one other version of this show circulates
as of June 18, 2002. The previous version is from a 
"liberated" bootleg. It suffers from a big cut in "Drums",
as well as a cut in "Space".  This version is a direct
copy from a DAT clone. No digital processing other 
than resampling has been performed. No fades added. 
Tracks can be seamlessly reassembled when a longer 
disc format becomes available.
