Release notes: 
http://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2012-0013.html


This fixes some nasty bugs that you shouldn't have to pay for support to have fixed.  You can download ESX fixes for free from VMware.

You'll have to find a license somewhere else...this is just the download from the VMware site.
