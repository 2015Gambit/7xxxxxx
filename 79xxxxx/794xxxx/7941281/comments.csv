,godswallops,2012-12-20T16:47Z,"I've downloaded this probably 4 times from as many different sources over the last 6 years and without doubt this is by _far_ the best I've seen.

It's such a good movie it was always disappointing that the DVD copy was always fuzzy & missing background etc.  

This copy is is not perfect, but compared to what has been available before, it is just great stuff!

Thanks to your team :)"
