I cut episodes 1-16 of Naruto Shippuuden together so that it more accurately follows the manga.  

Its not perfect.  

While I have striven to make this contiguous, I'm still new to video editing and there are some noticeable jumps between some scenes.

Some parts might seem odd because they are "out of anime" order, where a scene in the manga may follow all at one time, that same scene could be broken up and otherwise presented in the anime timeline.  Some stuff isn't in the manga.  I tried to keep all the fun fight scenes cut in, even if they weren't detailed in the manga.  In the same sense I tried to remove any extraneous backstory or flashbacks, because we've all seen the show and know the backstory...besides the fact that its already over 4hrs long.  Some parts flow better in the anime presentation.  

One key thing you should notice is that most of the fight scenes are much more coherent and do not jump back and forth between different battles.
