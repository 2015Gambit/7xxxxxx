,Kuroi_Kenshi,2012-12-21T14:51Z,l tried to handbrake it for my Apple TV but it did not work :/ anyone knows why?
,Rampant_Uterus,2012-12-22T08:50Z,"shoot, using MPC-HC but its not rendering with my GPU (got 1 core CPU) video quality looks great but it stutters/ slows/ audio misses (NOT VIDEO PROBLEM "
,timothx,2012-12-22T19:59Z,"I ran this twice and found I couldn't skip ahead without it freezing permanently.

I concur with others' statements regarding the somewhat inaccurate subtitle translations. For instance, Guts, is referred to as 'Gatts', in at least one instance."
,Kuroi_Kenshi,2012-12-26T13:50Z,Can't handbrake it so l'll have to wait for another upload....
,Froglet,2012-12-29T13:42Z,"Thanks for this Bijan151. It is brilliant!! Better than part one, and Guts' famous battle of 100 men more realistic, and bloodier than ever before. Graphics are excellent, while retaining the style and feel of the series. 
Re: the subs, they were translated by a Frenchman who first did them in French and then into English. Even with a few minor grammatical errors, he did a superb job, and the sense of the original seems to be captured completely. Merci beaucoup, monsieur.
No censoring, which is good because the nudity is part of the story, and really, what's a few flashes of tit and pube and dick, compared to the explosive violence? "
