About the Game

BlackSite: Area 51 (BlackSite in Europe) is a horror science fiction first-person shooter video game, released for Xbox 360 and Windows on November 12, 2007 in North America, with a PlayStation 3 version coming a few weeks later. 
The game is mostly unrelated to the 2005 Multi-platform game Area 51.
BlackSite: Area 51 features standard first-person shooter gameplay. 
It uses a regenerating health system; additionally the player's character can absorb relatively large amounts of gunfire before dying. 
The game features 6 different weapons, however only two weapons can be carried at the same time. The game also features the ability to use grenades and melee attacks. 
One of the main features of the game is squad tactics. For almost the entire game, the player will have a team of two A.I. controlled squadmates accompanying them.
The game's main weapon, the M4 carbine, has a reflex sight that can be aimed through for zooming in on distant targets. 
The game also features several vehicle sections, where the player must drive a civilian van or military Humvee cross-country to reach a location, while dealing with enemy attacks. 
The player can exit the vehicle at any time to collect items, investigate buildings, or man the humvee's mounted machinegun.....
