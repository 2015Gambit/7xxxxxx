The Full length second album from Electronic Psy artist Illusion of Self, Illusion Of Choice

Illusion of Self (I.O.S) has been producing Psytrance since 1998, when he started fooling around on his pc and got infected quickly. After getting good feedback from slipping in a few of his oqn tracks into some DJ sets, and seeing the dancers enjoying his interpretation of psy, it gave him the confidence to pursue his vision. Influenced by Pink Floyd in early life Jame studied music and the guitar from 10 years onld to the present, now at 27 he finds more flexibility with syntheizers.
