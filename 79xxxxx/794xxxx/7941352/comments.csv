,comixscholar,2012-12-20T19:01Z,"I have a request, that could, I suppose, also be a challenge. I was wondering if you had any of the early 90s Malibu series? Specifically, I am talking about Protectors, Arrow, Airman, Man of War, Dinosaurs for Hire, Gravestone, Genesis, and ExMutants. In other words Malibu that was NOT ultraverse and NOT Bravura. These are impossible to find online, but if you think you can..."
,LyokoMx,2012-12-22T16:13Z,"Hi BlackCanary I also have a request (if it's possible), could you post the ""Freedom Fighters (1976-1987)"" because the torrent here is fallen from a long time ago :(

Thanks!"
