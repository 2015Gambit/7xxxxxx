1.select the usb flash drive which u want 2 create bootable.

2.select the bootloader option or the option for which u  want to create bootable usb for e.g if u want 2 create a bootable usb for windows 8 , 7 or vista select the first option or if u want to create a bootable usb for DOS select the second one, if u want 2 create a bootable XP USB then select the third one and so on.

3.Select the Filesystem type, means format ur USB drive using NTFS, FAT32 or FAT option.

4.tick the 5.option and choose the location of the ISO file.

that's all wait for sometime till software makes ur drive bootable.

It will take around 5-15 min depending on the size of ISO image file"
