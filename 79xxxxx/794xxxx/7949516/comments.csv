,emoraven,2012-12-29T11:05Z,no this is not a online version of minecraft. teamextreame has a online updated version. I believe their servers are down at the moment though. i prefer this version though as im not much of a online player.

This is fully an online version, it's just not mentioned in the title. Anilem's releases are always the best. From the main menu, click the multiplayer button, then 'Add Server' and enter any cracked server's address, such as these:

mc.niflheimcraft.com        --Niflheimcraft Server, it has Hunger Games and stuff ;) all the official places are floating high up in the sky and are huge and well designed

Mc.TeamExtremeMC.com        --TeamExtreme Server, gigantic statue to the PvP nether and the city covered by a giant shield with a neat layout, you should head here first but read the entire library"
