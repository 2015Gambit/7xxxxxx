Unreported World reporter Evan Williams and director Wael Dabbous meet the Burmese villagers fighting for their ancestral lands as foreign investors flood in to a nation rich in undeveloped resources.

After 50 years of military dictatorship, Burma is finally re-emerging from isolation as a pariah state.

The release of political dissident Aung San Suu Kyi and the moves towards a more open society are the end of the story for some. 

However, economic development is leading to new social unrest as tensions build between big business and local people. Activists claim that there are thousands of land grab conflicts throughout the country as powerful interests try to cash in on foreign investor interest in the new Burma.

Is optimism that Myanmar will be a fully-democratic state misplaced?
