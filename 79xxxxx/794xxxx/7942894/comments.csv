,reneshakil,2012-12-21T07:54Z,"don't worry, there's nothing wrong about this. u can check and then comments. that'll help others."
,Ogurek4,2012-12-21T11:23Z,"I downloaded this torrent and checked to see what the problem is. There is an error on page 13 (nm02-012.jpg). A third of the page is missing (it's greyed out). 

Fawkes-Empire has released ""Nowhere Men 002 (2012) (fixed) (Digital) (Fawkes-Empire)"" to fix this problem."
,reneshakil,2012-12-21T18:45Z,sorry to missed that. actually i've a job that is 6 days  14 hours. im doing these upload thing when i'm free. so can't check every files. sorry downloaders.
,Ogurek4,2012-12-21T23:17Z,"It isn't your fault so there's no need to apologize reneshakil... You can't check every book AND upload them in a timely fashion. Besides, Empire scanners are usually perfect 999 times out of 1000. I was just trying to warn people of the problem with this one comic... 

Thanks for your uploads and keep up the awesome work!"
