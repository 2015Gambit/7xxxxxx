This is the sequel of Parkan Iron Strategy game in Russian. It hasn't been officially released,
because the producer left Iron Strategy project and started making Parkan 2 (which was a failure). That's why it is only in Russian.
It took me a long time to find this ... Have fun!

Instructions:
1. Launch the game using file IRON_3D_P2.exe
2. Have fun!

Notes:
1. It is BETA version (so it's a bit buggy)
2. You can have "??????" in menu. That's because You don't have russian fonts.

The version I found on the Internet was "messy" so I cleaned it a bit...

Changes:

version 1.1
- restored training missions because without them you couldn't save game in first chapter

version 1.0
- removed saves
- removed training missions (They are the same in Iron Strategy 1)
- removed cheats
- removed unlocked missions
- removed other unnecessary files



Especially for fans of the game :)
