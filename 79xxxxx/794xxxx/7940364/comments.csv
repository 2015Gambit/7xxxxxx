[T],STFmaryville,2012-12-20T18:59Z,Thanks SerialKilla12! BleedingCool is reporting that this is the last issue of Haunt for now. McFarlane's putting the series on hiatus and 29 + 30 are cancelled; might relaunch as a Volume 2 with McFarlane writing it.
,SerialKilla12,2012-12-24T21:37Z,Image comics is the best I share them because nobody else does the end of this comic was cool not as many people download Image comics compared to Marvel and others people don't know what their missing.
