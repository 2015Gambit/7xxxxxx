,WafflesOverWomen,2012-12-21T22:39Z,"I know you must be bombarded with this, but I haven't seen you mention anything lately here or on KAT... Do you have an update on Steins;Gate part 2? I'm not rushing you, I'm just dying inside to see the rest!"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-22T08:12Z,"WafflesOverWomen, most likely next week. 

Daman said this when I asked last week: ''ill probably have it next week,
then it will take me another 2-5days to encode and OCR,
its really a hassle working with anime over 13 episodes. ''

So, assuming nothing conflicts with his schedule too much, hopefully next week. "
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-22T09:07Z,"Lost leaf, i would have had it up already but, the blu rays are full of banding and it requires a pretty good script to remove most of it and actually make it watchable, 
You guys can download DHD Version but that thing is full of banding."
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-22T09:09Z,"Daman, I didn't know you were into Dead by April and A Day To Remember. Respect right there.

Did you hear ADTR's latest single, Violence (Enough is Enough) ?"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-22T09:13Z,"I honestly don't mind the wait. I'm presuming the banding must be noticeable enough for it to be distracting, if you mention it. "
,AquaPigmyNinja,2012-12-22T09:18Z,"The Part 1 looked so fantastic, I'm willing to wait longer for you to upload part 2. Thanks again, Daman. Can't freaking wait, though..."
,WafflesOverWomen,2012-12-22T14:16Z,"Thank you, Lost. Yeah I'm totally fine waiting for Daman's up, I just can't stop thinking about it. I might watch the first 12 again, it's been about a week."
,mooserocka,2012-12-23T01:04Z,lol aqua pig o thats fantastic wow yea you talk manly lol. WOW all i have to say. Stiens gate 2 would be nice i just really want to see SHANGRI LA and 006. They were released in september and daman forgot them. He has got everything else which is AMAZINg just there is no bluray for those two anime and thats prob why he missed them. Please put them up when you can.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-23T02:10Z,"Moose, there is a reason why i skiped Shangrila, As i said before i dont do animes that features a Girl as Main lead, I dont like Animes with girl main characters there horrible and totally kill shounen.

,roundnut,2012-12-23T05:58Z,I would like to make a request for Lupin the III: The Castle of Cagliostro
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-23T09:33Z,"Are Mooserocka and AnimeLife the same person? They're the only people on here who intentionally go out of their way to poke the bear.

Waffles, if you need something to watch in the meantime, may I suggest, Phantom no Requiem? Really enjoyable series. "
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-23T09:35Z,"Sorry, I mean Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom. "
,AquaPigmyNinja,2012-12-23T10:43Z,"@mooserocka

ok"
,WafflesOverWomen,2012-12-23T18:05Z,"Lost, I keep hearing that being tossed around here and there. I'll definitely check it out, I'm currently in the middle of Clannad After Story (just finished the first series the other day) because I've been watching too many darker animes lately, haha."
,mooserocka,2012-12-23T23:41Z,"Daman i never heard you say that. I for one think females are better as the lead as long as there is no fanservice i love it.  You also put up el caszador de le bruja  and that has 2 main lead females. Daman i wouldnt have kept asking if i knew you said that but i never got a responce.  Your choice i would love shangri la it is a GREAT anime which is actualy 26 episodes and not 11 like standard shows. Also 006 i heard is pretty good.  O well if you dont want to put it up your choice you do us a favor every day i just never got an awnswer for you before so i didnt know, i would have stopped awnswerin if you did. "
,mooserocka,2012-12-23T23:44Z,I mean ask not awnser for the last one sorry. Lost leaf no we are not at all the same person. I dunno what you mean by go out of my way do you not SEE what happend. This aqua pig said trash to me and my dead mother SO now because he said stuff UNPROVOKED i am going to trash him on EVERY post he makes so who poked what bear maybe he shoulda just kept his mouth shut.

[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-24T00:14Z,"Females are lame for Shounen Animes, They dont give the wow factor, they dont really look badass when fighting or powering up, or when they die."
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-24T03:15Z,"Clannad: After Story is one of the better series' of its genre. I think you'll enjoy Phantom. The only series I've strongly disliked was Paranoia Agent.


"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-24T03:25Z,"And Mooserocka, from memory, it was AnimeLife who you were in a heated debate with last time, as to why he was using profanity on your mother. You and AnimeLife are both always getting into arguments with people. I don't see why you should feed the fire, Moose. Aqua clearly isn't hurling insults at you now."
,mooserocka,2012-12-24T04:38Z,UM lost leaf HE just did in teh POKEMON the movie mew vs mewtwo chatrooom. DO YOU HAVE EYES. THIS gOON also said something about my dead mom and said other horrible stuff. I will continue to say stuff too him now BECASUE he did. CHECK the other comments you will CLEARLY see it. He should have kept his mouth shut end of story now every time he even talks im going to say something to that idiot. Daman I dont agree at all the female lead is great. Especially THAT anime. I was so into it. Female lead or male lead if you can please just put it up weather you like it or not it would be great and much apreciated. Like i said you put up el cazador la bruja and there is 2 female leads in that so I dont get it. O well it comes down to your choice sir your the one who does it. if you do it will be greatly apreciated. If you dont then you dont you have your reasons. I dont agree with them at all but thier your reasons. All i can do is plead that you just do it for the fans. 
,mooserocka,2012-12-24T04:48Z,daman one more thing sir. You say females dont look bad ass. All i have to say is BLACK LAGOON. If revy or remy however they say her name in english isnt bad ass i dunno what the definition of bad ass is in your book. : ) 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-24T05:54Z,"Moose, Black lagoon is not shounen but Seinen, and Revy and rock are both main leads. 
So it really does not fall into the Category of Female Only leads.

as i said i hate animes that feature only female leads, like Strike wiches, Shangrila, magica modoka.
"
,mike1478,2012-12-24T06:45Z,Are you planning on doing Sword Art Online? If so that would be great. :D
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-24T08:29Z,"Moose, my point was, you're always getting into arguments with people, whether it be Aqua, AnimeLife, or xenoFLASH. You need to learn not to take things people on the internet say so personally, they don't even know you or your mother. The more you react, the worse they will get. Food for thought. 

And I'm not against you, moose, I just happen to notice that you're always involved within the conflict. "
,mooserocka,2012-12-24T17:30Z,I know your not lost leaf. Sorry if i made it seem that way. You are totaly right. I shouldnt take things so seriously. Sorry i just dont like when you give an opinion and people go nuts. Like just dont say anything the comment section is for opinions not for fighting which i myself am at fault for i just dont start it. Daman well i for one dont like strike witches either but you still put parts 1-2 up for people to see. I think shangri la has a male co lead as long as a transexual also. Which is weird but the tranny is kinda bad ass and beats people up wow cant beleive tranny and bad ass came out my mouth lmao. Since you put up strike witches can u make an exception for shangri la. If you cant thats your call. Also 006 i keep asking for and that isnt a female lead. Any way if you say no i wont ask again but its your call. Thanks you for what you do sir. 
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-25T07:52Z,"Okay oh mighty Lost_leaf WE ALL CLEARLY KNOW THAT YOU ARE THE  MOST GREAT AMONG THE OF ALL but can,t you see that i said im sorry to moose and what i said in the last comment at the pokemon 1st movie is because i want to prove that im not aqua or xeno here this is what i said to moose ........ ANIMELIFE at 2012-12-19 05:14 CET:  
hey mooserocka im not making 100s of account and ask them for your self you cant see the diffrents do you .and i said sorry so beat it kay and i swear to god that xeno and pig is not my accounts were not mine .


im guessing your misunderstand me moose i admit the comment its the fun niest comment you ever made so stop saying midfing all the time i said im sorry and im not making more accountss !! .Whatever i should have ingnored you with a question mark to get your treatment .And pig and xeno probably look at our old old old fights and knew bout the mom business and etc 

So dont go arround and saiying stuff that you dont know MOOSE                                                                                        There heres the real answer dude"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-25T07:54Z,"Mooserocka dont misunderstood me im just giving an example to Lost_Leaf









































"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-25T09:11Z,"Well Clannad features a Main Lead boy not Girl, 
It does have a heroine but she is not the main lead."
,mooserocka,2012-12-27T00:36Z,Daman you said why you wont put up shangri la but what about 006. You never put that anime up. It looked pretty good. I still want shangri la its really good. And you did put up strike witches and you said you hate that. Just confused why one n not the other. O yea 006 i heard it was good. 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-12-27T02:37Z,i put up strike witches because i already had the blu ray 
,mooserocka,2012-12-28T03:49Z,K got ya well if you can put shangri la up i will be FOREVER greatful. Also whoever the other person asking for shangri la up in your other thing isnt me i dont make other names just letting you know.
,rmekdaschi,2012-12-28T23:16Z,"can you please please post pokemon 4 ever i cant find a dual audio copy anywhere, thanks so much for your hard work daman"
,mooserocka,2012-12-30T20:53Z,I cant beleive there is people requesting pokemon. I think ALL the requests Should be BRAND NEW ANIME. All the old stuff is EASY to find. 
,Lost_Leaf,2012-12-31T01:51Z,"Well there will always be a demand for new and old things. 420p AVI's of the Pokemon movies are the only ones mostly around, so I would say Daman is one of the first to provide the untempered Blu-Rays with English audio muxed in with it. "
,ANIMELIFE,2012-12-31T19:53Z,pokemon still sucks guys .yeah new is the best
