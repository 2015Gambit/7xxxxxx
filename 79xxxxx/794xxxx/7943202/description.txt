POtHS Comment: His BLOOD is the only thing that Redeems us.

Description:

Church Growth by Voddie Baucham:
Most people in churches today have a false understanding of the Gospel. We associate it with things that are really the law. In this Sermon, Dr. Baucham discusses what the Gospel is "not" and what the Gospel "is".
------------------------------------------------------------------

Beware False Prophets:
This is an excellent sermon and exposition done by Pastor Vodie Baucham.  Do not think it is the obvious that we can now who is a false teacher/prophet, it is those who profess to be believers who can lead you astray. Mat_7:15 ΓÇ£Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheepΓÇÖs clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves."
------------------------------------------------------------------

A House Call for a Sin-Sick church:
A soul stirring message.  The charge against the church at Laodicea was that they were lukewarm. Dr. Baucham provides the historical context necessary for understanding what that statement means. He then makes the case that of all the letters to the seven churches, this one has the most direct relevance to the church in America today.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Polishing the Outside of the cup:
The charge against the church at Sardis was that, in spite of their good reputation, they were dead. Unfortunately, if we are honest, this is what we usually wish for our culture, our churches, and our kids. How do we approach these things without simply polishing the outside of the cup?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Tolerating the Intolerable:
The charge against the church at Thyatira was that some of them tolerated the idolatry and immorality that their culture practiced. But couldn't they have compromised just a little in order to be a witness for Christ?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Sanctification is of Grace:
"Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace?" This is one of the most common questions from people who don't understand God's sovereignty. Do we still have to keep the law? What does "once saved, always saved" mean? Listen to Pastor Baucham unwrap this passage as the Apostle Paul answers many of these questions.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Why I Choose to Believe the Bible:
Most Christians can be backed into a corner with two or three questions. Ask them what they believe about any subject, then ask them why they believe what they believe. By this point you'll have them where you want them since they would likely have said they believe what they believe because the Bible says so. Now comes the third and final question... Why do you choose to believe the Bible? At this point you will either get stammering and stuttering, or something worse.  This message answers this most pivotal of questions in a winsome, cogent, memorable way

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
