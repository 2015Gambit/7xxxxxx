$O$ is the debut album by South African rap-rave group, Die Antwoord. The album was initially a widely-circulated internet-only release, and made available to stream for free on the band's website prior to Interscope Records signing the band. The song "Wat Pomp?" had a music video released on June 6, 2009, followed by "Enter the Ninja" (a track with previous exposure as a viral video on YouTube and other video-hosting services), which received an official release on August 9, 2010. 'Fish Paste' and 'Beat Boy' have also been released as promotional singles. "Enter The Ninja" debuted at #37 in the UK Music Charts on September 19, 2010.

Following the group's signing to Interscope in the US, it was announced that $O$ would be rereleased in physical format with a different tracklisting.[9][10] Diplo produced one of the new tracks on the re-release, "Evil Boy", for which a promotional video was made available on 6 October 2010. The US iTunes digital release includes bonus track "Wat Pomp?" and an alternate version of "Evil Boy" not present on US physical release.[11]
