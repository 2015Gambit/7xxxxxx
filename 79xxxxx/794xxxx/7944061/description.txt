Tenor saxophonist Odean Pope is a Philadelphia institution: a practice buddy of
ColtraneΓÇÖs in his youth, a sideman with Max Roach for 22 years, now a mentor to
PhillyΓÇÖs up-and-comers and leader of a nine-horn saxophone choir, along with
various small groups. Thanks to a steady flow of recent releases, weΓÇÖre able to
assess not only PopeΓÇÖs busy present career, but also areas of his overlooked
past...

... Fresh Breeze features Pope fronting an all Philly quartet with alto
saxophonist Bobby Zankel, bassist Lee Smith, and drummer Craig McIver that
patrols the outer edges of post bop and modal jazz. The open expanses of
pianoless groups have always been a good fit for PopeΓÇÖs concept. Some of his
best work on record comes from his long tenure in Max RoachΓÇÖs pianoless
quartet. HeΓÇÖs also led his own trios ΓÇô an early one with Cornell Rochester and
Gerald Veasley comes immediately to mind, along with others that included
either bassist Smith or Tyrone Brown and drummer McIver. Although heΓÇÖs worked
with pianists like Dave Burrell and Hassan Ibn Ali, Pope doesnΓÇÖt necessarily
need one, since he generally will fill in all the harmonic cracks anyway as he
steamrolls through his solo. They give him the space he needs to work out his
harmonic ideas at length...
