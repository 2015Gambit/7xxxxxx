This is a Rar file of an exe (??!!), 14.2mb as a rar file, 13.7mb extracted as an exe, make sense? neither does the file size for this game, this uploader is a loser, don't trust him."
[T],prodallasosoft,2012-12-21T08:23Z,"Losers are people who have no torrents cause they dont know anything about them. Yes, this was a mistake torrent, cant take them back once you put them out there. As for losers, buy your own games, make your own torrents, or just shut up if you dont have a viable comment."
,PseudoPositive,2012-12-21T09:10Z,"Why did you rar an exe where the rar was bigger than the output file?? these always seem sus, as your a new uploader, you come under the microscope more those who have been around for a while, no-one wants their PC infected, so understand the flak you get when you make mistakes with torrents."
,GoodGravy,2012-12-21T12:33Z,"@prodallasosoft, do you have seesdbox? what is ur upload speed?"
,GoodGravy,2012-12-21T12:34Z,"@prodallasosoft, I meant seedbox? sorry."
[T],prodallasosoft,2012-12-21T16:42Z,"No I preseed only from utorrent, I have checked my own dld speed and they are slow but do go. I again apoligize for this bad torrent. Any tips on seeding my torrents are appreciated."
[T],prodallasosoft,2012-12-21T16:47Z,"Only seeding I have is when I make a torrent through utorrent. Any positive help with seeding will help. None of my torrents have malware or virus, all my stuff comes with easy to install and play iso."
