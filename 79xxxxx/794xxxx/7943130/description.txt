But while McQueen makes his way to the big race, he finds himself stuck in Radiator Springs, a small desert town that time has forgotten?and which Lightning would also like to forget. As Lightning gets to know the many quirky cars in this town--including the grumpy Doc with a mysterious past and the sleek, sporty Sally--he finds that his former priorities might be shifting. When race day arrives at last, millions of fans across the globe will see the Piston Cup end in a really unexpected way?
