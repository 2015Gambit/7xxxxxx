,SanDaiFez,2012-12-22T23:56Z,"There was another BrRip floating around, a couple of days ago, which had some audio in russian, korean subtitles, really bad audio in general and no ending.

Is this one better?"

In this release there are russian hardcoded subtitles in couple parts of the movie - including the title. But that doesn't changes much. Very nice release.
Thanks Extreme!"

Download subtitles from link in @GoodFilms comment - english subtitles for russian subs part.

A - Who Cares

M - 0 [ Or in the negatives ]

If you can watch this movie completely from start to finish you need to be in an assisted living facility with a bunch of retards being fed by a really large fat women. I will be glad to sponsor you via Tax Dollars. I can't believe movies like this still exist."
,Merkarov91,2012-12-24T09:28Z,"@TekDekker 

A review coming from someone who uses the phrase 'terra bad' doesn't hold much credit with me.

If you're unable to watch a movie that is longer than 90 minutes, and deals with themes other than explosions and aliens, then go watch the transformers or something you dribbling, vacant minded twat."

Ignore the moron. Just re-read and pick apart his post and his opinion becomes invalid. ""Hi, I'm complaining about a free blue ray movie. I also can't use these word things properly. I'm a winner!"""
,_frosty,2012-12-25T21:17Z,"This movie is a gem among the trash Hollywood puts out these days.  to tell the story properly, it extends into the almost 3 hour mark.  Unfortunately this is TOO long for most of the twitter population. I seriously feel as if the populations have all adopted the A.D.H.D attitude/viewpoint.  If something doesn't arouse or stimulate their need for action, sex, blood, gore and fear then interst is lost...or more accurately no cerebral commitment is created.  These comments only serve to prove the attention span of most people.  Anyone who can truely keep up with this movie (I understand that it can be to confusing for some as it involves THINKING) and isn't in it for the eye candy, will certainly enjoy it.  Infact most of those who did understand it, liked it so much that they watched it twice to pick up on anything missed the first time around.  Point being: it is not TOO long and boring if you ""HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY"" to grasp the plot and those who do understand enjoyed it enough to invest the time again; which many movies today can't inspire the same commitment.
BTW, All the above comments trying to invalidate the movie ONLY serve to prove and highlight your own Ignorance and inability to grasp any thought provoking material.  HAVE A NICE DAY ;) 
Thx for the U/L extremezone...appreciated! :)"
,schnitzelburger,2012-12-25T22:50Z,Almost as bad as Inception.
,LuxiusDK,2012-12-26T00:48Z,"And, again, extremezone delivers where everyone else fails (read the comments on missing quality sound in other torrents) - you my only true hero on the scene, extremezone!
It's not like there aren't other good uploads out there, but when is the last time extremezone upped a bad copy?!"
,hxxq,2012-12-26T15:02Z,"@schnitzelburger: inception is bad ??

,SirAlan,2012-12-28T00:40Z,"Great film. Great quality but avi indexing was broken. Had to repair in VLC in order to see last 30 mins. Gave me new respect for Tom Hanks.
Those who don't like this film are those who couldn't understand it. Poor fuckers. Recommend reading a bit of spoiler info on wikipedia first to clarify where its going etc.
thanks uploader"

Best Independent movie ever, 6 stories told in a different way, brilliant score by 3 composers, & a Super direction by Directors of Matrix Any Wachowski & Lana Wachowski including tom tykwer(perfume murderer)

The  movie requires ur constant attention, at 1st movie is bit slow, its after an hour picks up speed,its better if u read spoilers or wiki b4 u watch this film rather than watching it with desperate mood & throwing obscene comments on uploader  & filmmakers. ppl who hate this film shud watch a B-movie. 
The Wachowskis join forces with Tom Tykwer and overhaul the meaning of the word Epic!

 I didn't find it to be a mess at all, and it was certainly the best thing the Wachowskis have ever done. I'm not sure how the directing duties were distributed, so I'll uniformly praise Tom Tykwer as well.truly a marvel of multitasking on so many levels. Great stuff. 

Thank u extremezone.

,Realalist,2012-12-28T20:19Z,Video is prefect but when I played on my PlayStation absolutely no audio.
,Chek520,2012-12-28T23:33Z,"Great movie. Was able to grasp it all the first time I watched it. Figure the only people that hate it are those who can't remember what happened to them 5 minutes ago! Very intriguing movie, I love a movie that makes you think. It's like reading a book, you almost forget about reality!"
,Hit73110,2012-12-29T00:45Z,All text and titles in the movie are in Cyrillic.

M/10(to the sixth power)+Infinity! 

To those reading this, 
If there is any depth to you at all, then you may feel like I do: this is, hands down, the best film ever made. Despite what impudent dullards, who lack the capacity to appreciate such a remarkable masterpiece, say...this should be put side by side with Citizen Kane, if not above it. It is, quite literally, everything awesome I've longed for and imagined a film could be, and then some! 

Anyone that disagrees with me: good for you. I think time will vindicate my opinion, and yours will fade somewhere in the wasteland of unsearchable internet archives. 

Thanks again extremezone!!!"
,X-Bit2011,2013-01-03T04:00Z,"qaplwsok: Full ACK!

This film really got me... 100%!

I.am.speachless.

thank you EZ for this upload of perfect sound and picture."
,dispo1,2013-01-03T15:02Z,"This is the only one I've found so far with good sound, but why is the video so shitty in this one?  The video flickers and is worse than even the YIFY release.  Why the fuck did you make this such low resolution?  The YIFY rip is 200mb larger and has noticeably better video.  Why did you skimp on 200mb?  

All of the other rips that have better quality video than this, use the shitty surround sound that was made from Russian audio, and you can hear Russian echos throughout the movie even though the audio is in English.  Fucking idiotic!  This one managed to do the sound right, but the guy who made this one fucked up the video.  Are there any torrents that have both really good video, and the audio without the Russian echo?  I can't believe how much some of you guys have fucked up these rips."

,ThatGuyWayOverThere,2013-01-06T11:32Z,"@torrentjimmy & Realalist that is because this is a Blu-Ray rip and PS3 has this cinavia bullshit. There is a kind of digital watermark in the audio that will activate the cinavia protection when playing certain Blu-rays(Most big name releases) that have the audio track compressed.

They could get around this by leaving the audio uncompressed when converting, The only reason I can think of why they dont do this is because of size, I'm not sure how much bigger that would make the files...

Make sure you DL DVD RIPS if you want to watch them on PS3. I am in the same boat as you guys :("
,Militance,2013-01-08T15:26Z,"Those who didnt like this or didnt understand it, i recommend you go what that new american propaganda action packed garbage that i dont even remmember the name, this is a beautifull film, i honestly dont remmember the last time i shead a tear during a film, this shit deserves Oscars!! and lots of them, i have new foud respect for hale berry & tom hanks a rare diamond! Thanks xtreme for this Epic film!"
