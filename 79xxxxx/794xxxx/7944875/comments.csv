Transporter The Series S01E01 BRRiP XViD-PSiG"
,craddle,2012-12-22T18:15Z,"@zomzom90 The real name of the torrent can't be ""Transporter The Series S01E01 BRRiP XViD-PSiG"" since this episode has not been released to Bluray yet."
[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-25T22:41Z,"To weigh in on the ""...BRRiP XViD-PSiG"" this is just passing along what was originally posted to UseNet. BeechyBoy did himself a disservice by not keeping as much pedigree intact as possible. One would think a single RAR file on UseNet would be something less than savory, but it's the real deal. I've viewed it and it seems just as high quality as the extant German and French versions, but with English speaking actors actually speaking English. Haven't downloaded BeechyBoy's post, but I'd say it's likely direct from UseNet and as good quality as I'm able to discern. heh.

Would really like to know the source, but the result is worth the download.

Don't know about anyone else, but I tried going to the HBOcanada web site and it didn't like my US IP address at all - had to use another browser even after I set my VPN to Canada just to see the schedule (five episodes scheduled, first two on January fourth and 105 on the 25th). Should be a fun month.
