Copy this new map inside tomtom/files so you have 2 maps, then delete currentmap.dat in tomtom/files.
Install the new provided modded tomtom apk.
Run TomTom.... and you can choose between the 2 maps (currentmap.dat) come back again.
Every time you delete currentmap.dat you have have to choose what map you want to use.

Have fun :)"
