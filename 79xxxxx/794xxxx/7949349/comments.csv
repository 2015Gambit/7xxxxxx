This is  cool movie that was financed by the filmmakers.  The dudes in the video are the ones who made the film because it is an ""Autobiography"". If you dig this movie try to support them in some way.    This is very DIY and it has an integrity and a perspective that is unique.  They have a ton of cool merch.
