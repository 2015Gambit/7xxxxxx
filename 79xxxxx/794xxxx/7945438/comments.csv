[T],Hyperdrive25,2012-12-22T13:07Z,"Install Setup.exe.  Crack is preinstalled, launch the game from  the shortcut and when serial number window pops up use ANY serial number you'd like and click OK (if you only click OK it will ask again next launch).

NOTE:  Multiplayer CO-OP works ONLY with direct IP connection.  Play on Public servers will not work unless you purchase the game.
Zones.cfg can be modified to show your server in game and other cracked servers, just make sure people use your Zones.cfg or direct IP to connect."
[T],Hyperdrive25,2012-12-22T13:12Z,"The future looks rosy for Indie game Developers. Space Pirates And Zombies And Drox Operative are the best games in the market right now.

I can just begin to see that if EA GAMES can't BEAT-EM they just BUY THEM.

Face the facts folks, its just us DUMBASSES that PUT MONEY INTO EA'S POCKETS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

If Heath Ledger was still alive, I'd pay him to reprise his role as the JOKER and BLOW UP EA GAMES HEADQUARTERS for good."
,weedo357,2012-12-22T15:59Z,"Less EA ranting and more seeding for fraks sake.

Seriously just how long can it take you to upload pissy 150mbs?"
,jikavak,2012-12-22T17:41Z,As if EA games are the only publisher out there trying to get money.
,weedo357,2012-12-22T18:26Z,"EA/UBI/BLIZZ or McDonalds - who even cares, can you please just seed your bleedin' torrent?

Have been at 99.02% for three hours now."
,Atrei,2012-12-22T18:32Z,Started this when I got home from work at 2pm yesterday. 1pm the next day and it's still only at 51%. For a 150mb file. Just insane. Downloaded this an hour after it was uploaded... uploader has never actually been on to seed.
[T],Hyperdrive25,2012-12-22T18:57Z,"Currenly I am living in a part of the world where there is no fibre optic  internet connection. I was going to upgrade from 256kbps to  2mbps but the guys were sold out of broadband modems.

Please bear with me. I will soon upgrade my internet by end of January."
,weedo357,2012-12-22T19:20Z,"As long as we don't have to wait until then to get that ~1%...

Seriously though, thanks for the dl."
,Ququ2012,2012-12-22T20:37Z,"Oh man, turn superseed or initial seed on already, please (500 leeches with 99,3% is something wrong)"
,Caveman327,2012-12-22T22:50Z,"Finally finished! Thank jeebus. Except for the sub-dial-up speed, works peachy"
,Power.D,2012-12-24T18:54Z,"Can't get game to launch properly. I open the .exe and it shows the serial tab alright, but after I type in any password the game just doesn't start. I checked Task Manager, the process starts and just shuts down soon after. Got any ideas ?"
,gengleong,2012-12-26T03:16Z,Thanks for this torrent! :)
,gengleong,2012-12-26T03:17Z,o.O Wow thank to everyone for seeding. My download finished in under 4 minutes X_X
,gengleong,2012-12-26T03:25Z,Is it possible to download updates?
,Power.D,2012-12-27T14:41Z,The game spontaneously started working. Had it on the computer for couple more days and decided to try it again. It launched. Maybe it just needed a restart...
[T],Hyperdrive25,2013-01-03T09:21Z,"If you think about it.... this game is WAY BETTER than SINS OF A SOLAR EMPIRE 2.

Of course if you didn't know it, Sins was copied from that excellent game Conquest: Frontier Wars."
