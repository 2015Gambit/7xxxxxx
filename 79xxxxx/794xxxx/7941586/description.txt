
This is release number one of the MediumRarities series.
These are for archival purposes only, as I have seen too many
CDs from this era deteriorate already. Some are rare, some not
so much. Many are great, some.... well... opinions vary. But they
deserve to survive outside of the machine that chooses what to
preserve and what not to preserve. 

(The track record so far aint so great)

Save these, keep them, back them up. Treasure some... but maybe 
not all of them. Certainly keep them anyway. No seriously.....
you're going to love some of this, and others will make your head
itch and a big question mark will appear above you.

I will not be including full albums. The focus is on single and
EP releases. Remember to support the artists however you can and
give the albums a try. The album is not and cannot BE dead.
