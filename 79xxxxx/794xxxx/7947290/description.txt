REVIEW

I bet some Santana fans were wondering why other great classics from the band like "Se Acabo," "Guajira" and "Incident At Neshabur" were not in the first "The Best Of Santana" collection. Now here is their answer with "The Best Of Santana Vol. 2." 
This is a more jazzy, deep album than the first one and the songs are all good and incredibly well-performed, especially on the percussion angle. "Guajira" is my favorite track because it's all Latin flavor but also with touches of jazz. The album has two treats which are live performances of "Black Magic Woman" and "Europa." 
The songs that have some sort of jazz/blues touch to them like "Persuasion" and "You just Don't Care" are memorable and what makes this a great album is the exhilarating, stylish flavor of it all, showing why the Santana sound is so unique. This CD comes fresh off the heels of the success of "Supernatural" where Carlos Santana left his mark in music history once again with hits like "Smooth" and "Maria Maria." Here is a slice of more stuff for those who are new to Santana and want some quick lessons in the music. 
This album has everything from jazz to blues to Cuban sounds. You'll want to listen more than once to catch every detail, every note and sound. A great collection of great songs. (Customer from Amazon)
