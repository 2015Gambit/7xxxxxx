,EdyK9,2012-12-21T15:02Z,any 100% seeder?  i get 495 seeders and all stuck at 55.6%
,swine666,2012-12-21T21:26Z,Am i understanding this correctly? Does the title explain that the audio the proper good audio from the dvd and not the crappy cam audio the previous torrents had?
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-21T21:57Z,"WTF is ""Studio audio""?? 

Don't make up terms.

It's either cam, line, or DVD/BR."
,ag_orange,2012-12-21T23:57Z,Agree with michaelrwatson....i mean WTF?
,crumrugin,2012-12-22T00:06Z,studio means no bedrooms duh.. anyway its not cam its not 5.1 either
,crumrugin,2012-12-22T00:10Z,"The term studio audio has been around for years ..read ""line"" ..ok?"
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-22T05:24Z,"BAD NEWS... this has subs in Russian (like all other releases out right now). 

That wrecks the movie because (as you may know) it's a sci-fi thing where they jump around in time, and those subs tell you where/when they are, etc. It's basically worthless w/o them.

Picture quality is great otherwise, but you will ruin the movie if you don't wait. Just sayin."
,crumrugin,2012-12-22T07:32Z,"Well it is possible to understand the captions cut and paste info from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Atlas_%28film%29
 it tells the various story lines concisely"
,stlctan,2012-12-22T23:32Z,"Ok then, i watched entire movie with no problem and i dont speek russian

A 7
V 10
M 7

I give audio a 7 because i had to turn it up all the way through most of the movie to hear it.  There are some subs in Russian, but such a small amount that it doesnt affect the movie at all in my opinion."

,KuBiSCaNn,2012-12-24T14:45Z,"Audio is stereo (2 channel), read things carefully and avoid useless doubts. Thanks for the up mates!"
,Phatfish,2012-12-24T23:47Z,"So...

A -  Good, just very very low but at least the voice and effects are balanced and its synced ENGLISH!.

V - Fine, Not perfect like a normal screener. HOWEVER its fucking epic if you consider the file is only 700mb and the movie is almost 3 h long. Fantastic work!


M -  Haven't watched yet."
,michaelrwatson,2013-01-01T23:19Z,"@crumrugin: So you suggest having a browser open to consult wikipedia *while* watching the movie, to try to figure out what's going on..? That might be the stupidest, most pathetic comment i've ever seen. 

@Goodfilms: You may have solved the prob however... BiDA release is same length so they should work. Thx."
