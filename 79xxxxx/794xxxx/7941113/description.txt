TownshendΓÇöprincipal songwriter and guitarist for boundary-pushing, hard-living British rock band The WhoΓÇölays his life bare in this candid and entertaining autobiography, reflecting on both his personal life and his career as the brains behind one of rockΓÇÖs most successful and influential groups. Townshend details the bandΓÇÖs early years as a trendy 1960s Mod outfit, the creative and commercial peaks of the 1970s, and the changes forced by the sudden deaths of drummer Keith Moon (in 1978) and bassist John Entwistle (in 2002). But he also gets personal, tracing his troubled youth, a difficult and affair-ridden marriage, relationships with family members and bandmates, various scandals and legal troubles, and decades-long struggles with alcohol and overwork. Townshend covers a lot of ground and is admirably forthcoming in addressing controversies and personal mistakes, but there is frustratingly little insight into his creative process or songwriting and recording methods. Verdict The lack of perspective into the influential musicianΓÇÖs blending of experimental artistry and raw rock ΓÇÖnΓÇÖ roll power will frustrate some readers, but TownshendΓÇÖs long-awaited memoir is easily recommended to anyone interested in this true rock iconΓÇÖs amazing journey
