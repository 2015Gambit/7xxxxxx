Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, December 19 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex blasts through the liberals' ludicrous calls for Obama to use executive orders to repeal the Second Amendment in the wake of the Sandy Hook travesty, and analyzes the mainstream media's all-out attack on the Constitution by attempting to demonize lawful gun owners. He'll also elucidate the history of gun confiscation and spell out the wider, sinister agenda behind it. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes attorney and founder of Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, to discuss the red alert that has firearms flying off the shelf.
