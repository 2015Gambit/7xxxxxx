Prism (or PRiSM) is a Canadian rock band originally from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. They were active from 1977 to 1984 and are active again from 1988 to present. The band's sound is a mix of Album-Oriented Rock (AOR) and pop rock. They have released a total of 13 albums to date. Their success has been primarily in Canada where they won the Canadian music industry Juno Award for Group of the Year in 1981. Prism is noteworthy for launching the careers of international record producer Bruce Fairbairn and songwriter Jim Vallance.

On Sunday, March 6, 2011, Prism's Spaceship Superstar was chosen as the wakeup song for the Space Shuttle Discovery crew members. This was a significant point in history as it was the last day that the crews of the Space Shuttle Discovery and the International Space Station were together before Discovery returned to earth in the last mission of the shuttle Discovery.

It achieved platinum status in Canada (in excess of 100,000 units sold.)

"Spaceship Superstar" became the band's signature song and a staple of Canadian rock radio. Record producer Bruce Fairbairn and songwriter Jim Vallance both went on to achieve huge international success.
