 The DVD is a live DVD with various footage from the his 1993 tour. You notice the use different vootage during a song as Zakk Wylde's guitar changes half way through the song a few times. The songs setlist is basically all their hits from previous years and a few Black Sabbath covers (e.g. Crazy Train, No More Tears, Goodbye To Romance, Iron Man, Paranoid, Mr Crowley etc.) The original Black Sabbath does come on stage for one song titled "Black Sabbath." Although it is a live DVD, there is a skit going throughout the set list (starting and stopping), where Ozzy is in his hotel complaining. But the length of the DVD itself makes up for it as it is a 2DVD set.
