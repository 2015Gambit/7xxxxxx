How to Develop the Ultimate in Wrought-Iron Muscle, Mid-Section
Body Armor and Core Generation of Explosive Power

The sole goal of Hardstyle Abs is to achieve an extraordinarily strong mid-section. But not simply to swivel heads with your rippling ΓÇ£six-packΓÇ¥. For, according to Pavel, your abs should be simultaneously weapon, armor and force generator. The six-pack is just a side effect of the coiled power with which you now operate.

Hardstyle Abs will give you impenetrable body armorΓÇöto withstand a direct hit of the greatest magnitude. Hardstyle Abs will give you the generative force to retaliate with a devastating backlash. And Hardstyle Abs will help you lift more weight than ever beforeΓÇömore safely.

After years of dedicated research and experimentation, Pavel has identified three "killer" drills, as all you need to achieve this level of mid-section mastery. Follow PavelΓÇÖs battle plan to the T and the results are guaranteedΓÇönoticeable within weeks, extraordinary within months. Pavel provides the laser focus. You? Simply obey the commands.
