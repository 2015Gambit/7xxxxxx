Or is this all his designs of military weapons ?  Or all the drawings he made of birds in flight ?  102 MBytes might seem small, but that takes 3 hours on a cr@ppy 384 kbit adsl line !   Again, I apologize for appearing ungrateful, but giving limited info on an upload is such a bad habit.  Again, samples would have been appreciated.  Better yet, why even zip the thing at all ?  You realise that in order for me to both view the data AND seed it, I would need to use DOUBLE the file space.  If you simply left the files as-is, we could first check a few files ourselves, and then if happy, download the rest and seed happily."

,szore,2012-12-20T20:33Z,"But seriously, its only 100 M why panic? If you pay for BW then you should'nt be here. "
,pythonista99,2012-12-21T13:45Z,"Er - now sure what you mean by ""BW"" ?   Seriously tho', there are still people who have low speeds and caps on downloads.  Looking for quality stuff becomes an art.  It's really great that there are people like you who offer uploads and initial seeding.  I still think if you just uploaded the contents as individual files, then you solve ALL problems.  I can take a sample.  I can pick and choose.  And not waste precious download time and bandwidth.  Cheers."

,pythonista99,2012-12-21T20:04Z,"I see you re-posted this in another torrent, as separate files.  Well done !  Thank you for taking the well-intended criticism so well :-)"
