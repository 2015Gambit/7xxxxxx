,ptv83,2012-12-22T09:14Z,"what a terrible game .. god i remember waiting and waiting for this to come out.. all those years... i quit playing the game for weeks because the game was so stupid.. it ignored, changed, modified and made up all new story for the last 8 games.. the damn avatar knew nothing. the cookie cutter response was (surfer dude accent) ""what's a ""blank""?"" .. an entire game dealing with gargoyles: sure .. what's a gargoyle?  .. your best friend through many games who jump alive into a cremation furnace was a palidin: ""what's a palidin?"" ..

the game starts as you leave your house, past your front gate is a street? NOPE . a public PARK .. what's inside this city park you ask?? A PIRATE who pulls a cutlass on you, a GIANT SPIDER the size of a doverman beside where the kiddies play, and a MASSIVE WOLF!  after speaking with the fortune teller who explains the game a bit and says when you go to britannia you'll have vast knowledge of everthing in it/to do with it/that ever was with it ...and you choose your class (dont pick mage, magic doesn't work in britannia) you go through a PURPLE moongate(without your moonstone?? WTF) and then get BEAMED down instead of stepping through(WTF?) it takes your weapons for some reason(that you just ran arond collecting beforehand), a dragon incinerates you.. but you survive and end up in your underwear .. the sky WAS red . but now is blue.. you kill a big bad dude with a crappy dagger who guards a teleporter that goes STRAIGHT to lord britains caslte court yard from the evil guardians HQ.. WTF, the guardian could just sneak in during the night and murder everone.. but hasn't done it dispite 20 years having passed by!

i haven't played the game in 13 years but that's the first 10 minutes ... and i'm sure i forgot a ton.

the codex is now read by using lenses instead of the lenses to see into the zone where the book was sent but now is back magically.. but magic isn't supposed to work like back in U7.. but lord brit could still do magic then but can't now. every panel in the museum is wrong.. king says take what you want in the castle but there's crap all and the trainer wants 300 gold for useless sword leasons.. you dont need them because the enemies are dumb as fuck.. you can walk past them completely if you like or mash the left click endlessly to fight... so stupid.

this entire game .. ugg.. soo stupid!!  fucking hell!

bad memories... bad memories... gonna need therapy or some shit now ..."
