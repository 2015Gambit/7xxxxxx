Extract using 7-zip or winrar. (www.7-zip.org)
run "epsxe.exe"
go through the config manager (i recommend the "petes plugs" for both video an audio)
when selecting the video plugin select the configure button on that page
at the bottom of the video configure page there are 2 buttons you want "fast" and "nice"
press nice, apply, ok, then continue.
for audio select petes plugin too. and continue, no need to configure the audio one.
every other option/area to config doesnt matter what u select just press next (only do video and audio the way i said)

NOTE: to run a game go to file/run iso (locate iso/bin/img/wtfe file and open it)

NOTE2: if it's a psx for psp game converted to emc then you must unconvert it, you need a prog called "unecm"
