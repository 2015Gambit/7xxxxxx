,russianhornybear,2012-12-22T15:12Z,release after 4 years :) not bad :)
,OmniNegro,2012-12-22T16:16Z,"The real benefit of this is that it has all the plugins and BIOS and everything else you would need.

I would usually bitch about this being off topic, but this is the PC build of the program. It works very well.

Thank you FuCtUpPuNk for this. This coming from you means it is legitimate unlike the hundreds of fakes out there to make you think it does not work.

I will seed. Tracker scumming copyright trolls be damned."
,sbseed,2012-12-22T18:40Z,"they finally finished 1.8, well bought dang time.
they do some great work, hope its mostly glitch free :P

thanks for the torrent."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-12-23T06:18Z,"this isnt in the wrong place. if you put some thought into it. ok, yes... this is a psx emulator, but what does it do? it makes psx games playable on pc. so it could go under either category... psx games or pc games. if you think really hard about it though you're playing games on this through pc, not psx. therefore to me, it made more since to upload this under pc games, as im not playing them on psx. though i get where you are coming from. my psx game torrents though i prolly shoulda put under psx games but i never knew the site to have a psx option, never noticed it b4 (until this upload). actually i dont think it was always there. i could be wrong though.

anyhow, you are welcome. more to come in the future."

There is a good guide for connecting a PS3 controller to the pc at http://www.gamefront.com/how-to-use-a-ps3-controller-on-a-pc/

Good luck"
,Moogles1,2012-12-28T09:24Z,so the gameshark is that the original like 2.2 or higher codes wont work? and also i cant seem to be able to add codes onto gameshark 5 how i do that?
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2013-01-05T07:24Z,"@Moogles1 the ""gameshark.iso"" is actually newer than the others the v5. to add cheats ur best off using pec psx emulation cheater. it's located in the plugins folder. you open pec.exe. it's pretty easy to use, just look up a tutorial on how to use it and how to add cheats to it (google). id type one now but i gotta hit the sack."
