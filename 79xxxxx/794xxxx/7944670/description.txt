 Sudeep is a high profile industrialist who    
 gets whatever he wants and he has a special   
 eye for beautiful women. To get them, he will 
 not hesitate to do anything. That desire gets 
 triggered when Sudeep sees Bindu, a micro     
 artist who runs a non-profit organization.    
 However, Bindu is loved by Nani who keeps     
 following her everywhere. Though Bindu loves  
 him, she doesn't express it to him and enjoys 
 the attention. The story takes a turn when    
 Sudeep discovers the feelings of Bindu for    
 Nani and is unable to digest his defeat. He   
 kills Nani. But Nani is born again as         
 'Eega'(fly) and he wants to take vengeance    
 on Sudeep.
