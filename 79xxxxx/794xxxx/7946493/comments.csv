Long.  Unrealistic flying scenes.  They took a real airline crash (Alaska Airlines 261) and even with all the data, managed to screw it up.  The jackscrew controls the entire tailplane.  Not the elevators.

If you feel like watching a movie about a drunk who's life just gets worse and worse, then finally after 2 hours he finds god and decides to sober up, then this movie is for you.  If you're looking for realism with the flying, then look elsewhere.

Also, they push god in this movie throughout the entire thing.  They do show some hot latina gash at the beginning though, which sort of redeems it."
