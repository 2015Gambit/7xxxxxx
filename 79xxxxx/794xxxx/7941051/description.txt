Voila! The elusive second volume of Harlan Ellison's The Voice From the Edge is finally available for easy, accessible download (provided I haven't boned my first upload). 

Content: I have parsed the files from each CD (5 in toto) and placed them in their own folder; basically, I have divided the short stories into their own folders. I merely illuminate this point so any prospective Pirates aren't confused by the track numbers of the individual files. It's in the right order, folks!

Included: 

*In lonely Lands.
*S.R.O.
*Midnight in the Sunken Cathedral.
*The End of the Time of Leinard.
*Soft Monkey.
*Go Toward the Light. 
*Pennies, Off a Dead Man's Eyes.
*Jeffty is Five.
*Rat Hater.
*Prine Myshkin, and Hold the Relish.
*The Function of Dream Sleep. 

Quality: The format is, of course, MP3. The quality is of the highest available to me from the program Microsoft Media Player's rip function... In other words, I lack the knowledge of techno-jargon to offer the actual quality. 

Anyway, be sure to give voice to any--I would hope constructive--grievances.
