I spend a lot of time in PP and shall try and make some enquiries into these recordings as I know a few Cambodian musicians who would certainly have been around at this time or know people who were.

I would say (guess) that the musicians would have probably have been certainly middle class Cambodians (or above) therefore some may well have escaped the country before the KR came to power. 

It is a wonderful insight into how Cambodia was evolving before the KR took control. "

By the way, maybe you have noticed that at the end of the description I actually meant ""songs"" instead of ""sons"". A little finger error."
