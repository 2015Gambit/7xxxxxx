Japan's top professional go toe to toe in this next-gen wrestling game from the makers of SmackDown. Wrestle Kingdom favors a "work the body" style of gameplay, where you can focus on various body parts to wear out your opponent and make him more vulnerable. There's also a "voltage" meter that builds as you perform more impressive moves. Once your meter is filled, you can perform your wrestler's finishing move.
