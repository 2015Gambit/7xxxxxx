,bokehjoe,2012-12-23T08:49Z,"azizex666:  Another heartfelt Thank You for your Christmas presents that you give all of us complete strangers- that I am sure is the fruit of countless hours of work for you- just to make a bunch of strangers extremely happy. You are like Robin Hood. I am disabled and on an extremely fixed income that does not leave me enough disposable cash to buy even one bestseller, and reading books on my e-reader is one of the very few things that keep me sane. I know the publishers would probably string you up if they could- but you are not doing them the dis-service they think you are. I do write reviews on the bestsellers and send out only to friends and immediate friends of friends- and only upon their request to be added to my listserv. The list is just a little over 200, and between them- and those that they forward to or pass on by work of mouth. So if there are any publishers reading this- there is some positive here for you as well. Thanks AZIZEX666!"

It would be great if you could put the series books that are not currently on the bestseller list in a separate folder so I don't have to weed them out every time. Also, if you could do a second torrent of just What's New since your last list, that would also be a real help. But in any case, you have my gratitude.
