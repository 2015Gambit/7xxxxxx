ΓÇ£My personal feeling is that citizens of the democratic societies should undertake a course of intellectual self-defense to protect themselves from manipulation and control, and to lay the basis for more meaningful democracy.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöNoam Chomsky 

ΓÇ£Exercising intellectual self-defense is an act of citizenship. It is what has motivated me to write this little book, which offers exactly this: an introduction to critical thinking.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöNormand Baillargeon 

What is the relationship between democracy and critical thinking? What must a citizen in a democracy know to make the word democracy meaningful? In A Short Course in Intellectual Self-Defense, radical pedagogue Normand Baillargeon trains readers to think, deconstruct, and ask the necessary questions to protect themselves from the manipulations of government, ΓÇ£authorities,ΓÇ¥ and other elites. Whether the issue be the call to what weΓÇÖre told will be a bloodless war, the ΓÇ£debateΓÇ¥ around Intelligent Design, understanding a government military expenditure, or simply reading the news, Baillargeon teaches readers to evaluate information and sort fact from official and media spin. In the spirit of advocates of critical thinking from every age, and including the famed late scientist Carl SaganΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Baloney Detection KitΓÇ¥ and George OrwellΓÇÖs views on the political uses and abuses of language, this vivid, accessible primer empowers readers to take their education as citizens into their own hands.
