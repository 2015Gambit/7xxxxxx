At least this torrent has all the episodes."

You are kidding right?  Not only are you missing an episode, but you have none of the PROPER Episodes done by EVOLVE when ASAP messed up.  You also do not have edited and synced subtitles, which I personally edited and synced myself, and you also do not have any NFO or Samples, which I also do.  How could you possibly say that your torrent is better?"
