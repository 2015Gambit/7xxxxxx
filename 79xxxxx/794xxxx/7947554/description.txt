SelfImage 1.2.1.92 - [cooldude187]


This is a great backup tool to create image files of any mounted or unmounted hard disk partition. SelfImage is the little hard drive utility with big aspirations. In its current incarnation, SelfImage is capable of making an image of a hard disk partition and writing it to another - useful for making backups. Use SelfImage to create a disk image of any partition and even partitions that Windows does not recognize (Linux partitions, etc). Additionally, when run on Windows 2 or XP, SelfImage can create images of partitions that Windows doesn't have mounted on a drive letter. Perfect for the dual-boot system, you can create an image backup of a Linux partition directly from Windows.
