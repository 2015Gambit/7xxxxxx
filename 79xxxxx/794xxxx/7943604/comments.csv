But movie is complete emo Tim Burton horse shit. I don't know what his parents did to him when he was a child to fuck him up so badly, but Burton is some seriously damaged goods. "

,Phatfish,2012-12-24T02:22Z,"A - Good

V - Good

M - I normally like Tim Burton's movies but there is several factors why this doesn't work. One being that it is back and white all the way true.
I have no problem with B&W movies but here it has no purpose or any esthetical gainings. It just becomes very annoying especially as Tim doesn't seem to have any experience working with B&W film. You cant just desaturated the color you need spend extra attention to contrast between objects otherwise it becomes very tiring to watch.

Any what. You fucked up on this one Mr. Burton but thanks for the upload anyhow!"

,joker2000,2012-12-24T10:11Z,I hoped I will enjoy this movie. I completely agree with Phatfish (see above). This film didn't offer almost anything. Really disappointed. I don't recommend it at all. Bad move from Tim Burton. Thanks for the upload. Cheers!

Anyone know a way around this?"
,scuzz08,2012-12-26T19:36Z,"""CINAVIA PROTECTED

Play it on an Xbox 360.  Sony PS3 also disallows playing Cinavia stuff.  SMD, Sony."
,Darring,2012-12-26T21:23Z,Thanks as always Bro
,MayaReset,2012-12-26T23:42Z,"RE: ""CINAVIA PROTECTED""
Thanks scuzz, but....
it won't play on my Samsung bluray/multi-media player either.
I'm not going to buy a xbox 360 any time soon so...can anyone else help?"
,MayaReset,2012-12-26T23:43Z,...and no. I don't just want to watch it on my PC or laptop. Kind of defeats the purpose of owning a big screen tv.

If your big screen tv is worth more than 20 dollars, it will have a hdmi input. Plug your pc into your tv and stop whining"
,dr_rock,2012-12-31T14:29Z,"Shit, I feel like a fool, one hour in (or there abouts) cinavia (or whatever it is called) kicks in.
Sorry for the misinformation.
About to hook up the laptop to the TV..."
,HeretikST,2013-01-01T17:29Z,"@MayaReset
Do you own a laptop with an HDMI out?  When I find movies with that Cinavia protection, I just put it on my laptop and then hook my laptop up to my TV and Voila, crisis averted."
,wild_dragon,2013-01-07T22:43Z,"cant find a way around the cinivia BS, only way to downgrade your ps3, or watch it direct on your computer if you dont have the HDMI ports, then why do you even exist."
,Phatfish,2013-01-08T20:53Z,"@MayaReset:

Well it depends how you look at it. At first it might well leave everyone clueless but as a experienced sound engineer I have trouble seeing how it could work as they claim long term . It's just not physically plausible/possible, but it's very interesting and I can be wrong."
