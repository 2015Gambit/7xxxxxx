@Jethro - It sure does buddy!"
,lkadar,2012-12-23T02:45Z,"Hi Both,
It is 64bit only
Yes it works on Windows 8 (as you can see I tested it on Windows 8)."
,vze2mp9g,2012-12-24T05:56Z,"Any chance of coming out with an exact 32bit version? Much appreciated, and Merry Christmas..."

OnlyByTheRain has a 32/bit version too:
Microsoft Office Select Edition 2013 15.0.4420.1017 VL(RU-EN) (3 
just below this one. Although I didn't try it, but this 64/bit one was of a very high quality, so I would trust the guy."

The very first folder of this upload does have an excellent crack (KMS 4.0). It will activate both Windows 7 & 8 and Office 2010 & 2013, including both Visio and Project."
,Mendes588,2012-12-29T13:26Z,"Just tested it, Works like a charm. It's a weird way to crack something (and I yet don't know what the activationhelper is good for) but it's not that hard and works 100% - I just wonder if I'm able to update without problem"

Can you please explain what was the original problem with Visio Pro in OnlyByThe Rain's version of the Select Edition and what you changed to fix it.

I've already downloaded his Select Edition and would like to apply the same fix to his files. I'm not going to download 5GB again just to fix this issue with VisioPro.

Cheers"
