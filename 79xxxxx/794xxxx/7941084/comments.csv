,SugerHigh,2012-12-21T09:12Z,"Another Cropped Copy..
Could someone just release it un-cropped. can look past the subtitles, but playing 720 Ă&#x2014; 272 video on a 50"" looks like shit"
,Creyz1,2012-12-21T16:45Z,"@cs01ws

How can you say this is not cropped? Just look at the screenshots and its clearly cropped.."
,pxpierre,2012-12-22T05:29Z,"V/A/9.

Thank you sC0rp-ET and seeders."
,Tomcat08,2012-12-24T07:44Z,"Thank you very much.
V-8 Some glitchiness and jaggies in a few spot, but nothing too bad
A-6 really staticy is alot of spots, usually when the volume of the movie amped up. Gunshots or the music. Really distracting to me. May not bother other people

Best copy by far that I have seen. 2 others where unwatchable due to the sound"
,lerijiso,2012-12-24T15:06Z,"U guys dont have to crop it you know. Why people willing to sacrifice the screen space just to crop out the korean sub i can never understand. Just keep the sub, show the movie in full frame just like how the filmmaker intended it to be. cropping films and messing with the aspect ratio is the worst crime."
