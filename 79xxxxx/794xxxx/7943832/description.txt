*  JB- "We've been playin' this tune so long, we played it 
before Traffic even played it."

Some of the trippy jams at the show make me wonder if a Native
American gave them some mescaline.  (just a theory)

*[There were 28 major board static pops found and deleted.
 I would say about 25 of them are inaudible.There are still
 some minor crackle ones]*
