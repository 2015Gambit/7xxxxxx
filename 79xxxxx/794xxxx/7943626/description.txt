When he goes to Istanbul on a job, he invites Kim and her mother, Leonor, whose marriage is on the rocks to join him. When the Albanians learn of this they try to grab them. They get Bryan and Leonor, he warns Kim and she evades them. Later he calls Kim to tell her to go to the Embassy but she insists that he let her help them.
