Though like most film adaptations, it only covers part of the book, I found it surprisingly good, especially for an American-International Picture. Michel Legrand's moody score sets the stage. Made in the late 1960s and filmed on locaton, it recasts Heathcliff and Cathy as something of the flower children of their day. But all in all, worth one's time to watch. Are children still forced to read this in school? If so, I'd be shocked - it's a romance with a decidedly s and m streak."
