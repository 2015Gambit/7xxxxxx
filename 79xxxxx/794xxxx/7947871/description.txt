Description:
The year is 2066. You, as biochemical engineer Lilah Kerlin and your partner Max Powers, an environmental engineer, have created the Ceres Project, an orbiting satellite that releases nanobots into Earth's atmosphere in order to counteract air pollution and the depletion of the ozone layer. After successfully engineering and launching Ceres, the project is left to operate under its own control. With the job complete, Lilah and Max decide to go on a long overdue vacation. Danger looms when the satellite unexpectedly develops a mind of its own, then builds a strange structure near the couple's vacation campsite and lures Max into it. Hearing his scream, Lilah runs to the place and is sucked into a vortex that leads her into her own nightmare.
