Originally released only in Holland, this is the first CD reissue of the superb 1970 solo LP from the lead guitarist of legendary Dutch blues / psych-rockers Q65. A moody blend of folk, pop and psychedelia, with some blazing guitar leads, the album also features his Q65 bandmate Jay Baar, as well as Dick Beekman (Cuby & the Blizzards), Francois Content (Swinging Soul Machine) and other leading Dutch musicians on flute, vibes, congas and other instruments.
