[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-12-21T17:46Z,"""The Ultimate Speed Pack will introduce the Pagani Zonda R, McLaren F1LM, Lamborghini Aventador J and Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse along with 25 new events and 70 speed-themed milestones spread throughout Most Wanted’s city. Once you’ve mastered the new vehicles, you’ll be able to battle a new Most Wanted rival, the Hennessey Venom GT Spyder, which would make an absolute killing in online multiplayer.""

Enjoy! And Merry Christmas! :)"

,ggabriel96,2012-12-21T20:40Z,"Thank you very very much man!
But I downloaded, installed and done everything and the content of the DLC is locked. It said ""Thanks for donwloading the DLC..."" and etc but I can't run against the Venom GT and even drive the new cars: I found the Pagani Zonda R on the world map and it says to me to buy the DLC to drive it... what should I do?? T_T"

,Machine4578,2012-12-23T13:27Z,there is a save fix floating around that unlocks the DLC.. the only downside is you have to start your game over..
