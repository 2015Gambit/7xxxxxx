,wetbeak,2012-12-31T06:06Z,thank you. have been searching for this for months. do you know of a comic called 'broz' ?
[T],Translation_pirate,2013-01-01T11:53Z,"Ehhmmm... can't say I heard of it.

Which language is it? Is it a webcomic or hardcover comic? Can you perhaps give me a link to a description?"
,wetbeak,2013-01-02T15:29Z,"thanks a million  for your work. i live in aus , so comics can be hard to find, love 2000 ad, all euro comics really -. i bought many graphic novels when i travelled o.s.... and would never have known that chevalier requiem was a proper series(got a quick look through sporadic  heavy metal purchases.)  ledroit is awesome... BROZ i believe is art by adrian smith, maybe published in french. not sure... thanks again, you are a wonderful creature. heh."
,wetbeak,2013-01-03T01:00Z,translation pirate i dont know how to make links sorry. i think its also nickel editions there is a page here                                   http://www.comicartfans.com/GalleryPiece.asp?Piece=660727&GSub=101606
[T],Translation_pirate,2013-01-03T12:46Z,"I found it! It's French indeed.
No scanlations available as far as I can see :/

I have the French version as CBZ if you just want to look at the pretty artwork?.."
