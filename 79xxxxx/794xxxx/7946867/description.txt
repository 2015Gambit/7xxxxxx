Hey guys!

In honor of the upcoming Christmas and in celebration for the world's survival of the proclaim apocalypse of 2012, i took the liberty of getting the 1080p music video for Christmas Swag by Ryan Higa (Nigahiga) and D-Trix (Dominic). There's also a 320kbps mp3 file of Christmas Swag as well the YTF Christmas Album Art. I hope you enjoy the video and may your christmas be filled with swag!
