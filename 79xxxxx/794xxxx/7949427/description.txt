William "Sonny" Criss (1927-77) was more than just another BIRD imitator.

As far as I can tell this "record" hasn't been uploaded before.


Although I generally prefer TENOR and BARI timbres to ALTO and SOPRANO, there

are a few players like Phil Woods, Julian Adderley and of course BIRD who

make me wonder why I have that opinion.
