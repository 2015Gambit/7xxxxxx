Making Stuff: Stronger

What is the strongest material in the world? Is it steel,
Kevlar, carbon nanotubes, or something entirely new? NOVA
kicks off the four-part series "Making Stuff" with a quest
for the world's strongest substances. Host David Pogue takes
a look at what defines strength, examining everything from
steel cables to mollusk shells to a toucan's beak. Pogue
travels from the deck of a U.S. naval aircraft carrier to a
demolition derby to the country's top research labs to check
in with experts who are re-engineering what nature has given
us to create the next generation of strong stuff.

Making Stuff: Smaller

How small can we go? Could we one day have robots taking
"fantastic voyages" in our bodies to kill rogue cells? The
triumphs of tiny are seen all around us in the Information
Age: transistors, microchips, laptops, cell phones.
Now, David Pogue takes NOVA viewers to an even smaller world
in "Making Stuff: Smaller," examining the latest in high-powered
nano-circuits and micro-robots that may one day hold the key
to saving lives.

Making Stuff: Cleaner

Can innovations in materials science help clean up our
world? In "Making Stuff: Cleaner," David Pogue explores the
rapidly developing science and business of clean energy and
examines alternative ways to generate it, store it, and
distribute it. Is hydrogen the way to go? What about lithium
batteries? Does this solve an energy problem or create a new
dependency? Pogue investigates the latest developments in
bio-based fuels and in harnessing solar energy for our cars,
homes, and industry in a program full of the stuff of a
sustainable future.

Making Stuff: Smarter

"Making Stuff: Smarter" looks at materials that respond to
their environments and even learn, such as an airplane wing
that changes shape as it flies. Scientists are turning to
nature in developing such "smart" stuff. Sharkskin, for
instance, has inspired a substance that, when sprayed in
hospitals, could eliminate antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
David Pogue visits a scientist who has even created a material
that can render objects invisible. "Smarter" concludes with a
vision of the ultimate in "life-like" stuff: programmable matter
that could create a duplicate of a human being.
