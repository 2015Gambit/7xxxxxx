This is a sort of Repack from a torrent I found on KAT by Aechmea.

I updated it with a few songs that i had that weren't in Aechmea's torrent.

I take his word that all the songs are 320kbps.

I added in the orchestral November Morning to the torrent, which isn't good quality but its still beautiful.

I am not impressed with the lack of information about Martin Stimming, The fact that he doesn't even have a Wikipedia Page.


Please acknowledge that this is most probably not a true discography, as i couldn't find a source to reference all his releases.

if I missed any songs tell me, then go find them yourself.
