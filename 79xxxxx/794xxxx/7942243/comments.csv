,NoRender,2012-12-20T21:37Z,Just wanted to say thanks for the upload. I'll end up buying the game once it's out of beta thanks to you :). And happy holidays as well.

No wonder the price is so low, it was made half assed, as a money sceme. I seriously am grateful that I tried it on pirate bay, first. Piece-of-shit, hands down."
