      "Sitting on Top of the World" is a folk-blues song written by Walter Vinson and Lonnie Chatmon, core members of the Mississippi Sheiks, a popular country blues band of the 1930s. Walter Vinson claimed to have composed ΓÇ£Sitting on Top of the WorldΓÇ¥ one morning after playing a white dance in Greenwood, Mississippi. The song was first recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks in 1930, became a popular crossover hit for the band, and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.The numerous versions of ΓÇ£Sitting Top of the WorldΓÇ¥ recorded since 1930 have been characterized by variations to the original lyrics, as recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks in 1930. ΓÇ£SittinΓÇÖ on Top of the WorldΓÇ¥, recorded by HowlinΓÇÖ Wolf in 1957  is a well-known and widely-used version of this song. This was the version recorded by Cream in 1968. 
      "Five to One" is a song by The Doors, from their 1968 album "Waiting for the Sun"."Five to one" is rumored to be the approximate ratio of whites to blacks, young to old, or pot smokers to non-pot smokers in the US in 1967, depending on whom you ask. A further urban legend has it as the ratio of Viet Cong to American troops in Vietnam. However, when asked, Jim Morrison said the lyrics were not political.The song's most famous performance was at the 1969 Miami concert at the Dinner Key Auditorium. Towards the end of the performance, a drunken Morrison declared the audience "idiots" and "slaves". The concert would end with Morrison being accused of "attempting to incite a riot" among the concert goers, resulting in his arrest, and later conviction, for indecent exposure.
