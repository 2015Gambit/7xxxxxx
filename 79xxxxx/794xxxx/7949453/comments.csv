-----------------------
Hi guys,
Merry Christmas to you and a happy new year too.
I don't seem to have dehou's e-mail address.
Perhaps one on you could post in the last History of Pop and Rock that said hello.
I can still download the music but can't leave any comments. I'm downloading 447 at the moments.
Keep up the good work.
Phil. ( Jumpingphil ).

@Tom2Phil: Thanks for your friendship, too."
,pupovaczlatko,2012-12-24T20:21Z,"send a message to our friend Phil 
You are a part of this family 
It's just not the same without you 
We hope you'll be back soon!
We Wish You a Merry Christmas, and Have a Happy New Year"
