Native Instruments Solid Mix Series Mk2 v1.0.0







The new SOLID MIX SERIES emulates the distinctive EQ and dynamics sections of one of the most revered mixing consoles of all time, while TRANSIENT MASTER recreates a popular hardware processor that provides highly efficient transient processing. All products can used be used with the free GUITAR RIG PLAYER software, or expand the arsenal of the upcoming new GUITAR RIG 5.

Based on sophisticated component modeling, the SOLID MIX SERIES recreates the essential components of a classic mixing desk whose sonic signature has shaped popular music. The series consists of three individual modules that provide the tools to create a polished and professional-sounding mix. ΓÇ£Solid EQΓÇ¥ emulates the legendary equalizer section of the console with its 4 parametric bands as well as the adjustable low-cut and high-cut filters, which allows for especially musical and transparent sound shaping of all signal types. Switchable EQ types also offer the selection between two distinctive generations of the original hardware with their specific sound characteristics.

ΓÇ£Solid Bus CompΓÇ¥ is an authentic emulation of the sought-after bus compressor, renowned for the way that it ΓÇ£gluesΓÇ¥ mixes together and singlehandedly creates a ΓÇ£finishedΓÇ¥ studio production sound. Taking advantage of the new features of the GUITAR RIG 5 generation, it also provides a sidechain input as well as a dry/wet control for parallel compression. As the third component, ΓÇ£Solid DynamicsΓÇ¥ provides a combined dynamics section with stereo compressor, expander and gate that lends itself to the precise dynamics processing of individual tracks.

TRANSIENT MASTER is inspired by a highly popular modern studio processor, and provides a unique and especially efficient method to treat drums and percussive instrument sounds by directly reshaping the envelope of the signal. Through the ΓÇ£AttackΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£SustainΓÇ¥ parameters of the software, TRANSIENT MASTER can both add natural punch and definition, or blend individual instruments further back into the mix, without any of the sonic artifacts associated with regular compression methods.
