"Supremo," the historical picture centering on the life of Philippine hero Andres Bonifacio, is such a risky endeavor for an independent project shot on a shoestring budget. Considering the challenge of living up to its epic values as a period piece, its production limitations hamper its cinematic facets from really soaring high. But on the brighter side, its appreciable effort and genuine intention to craft a dramatic origin story about this revolutionary man still works in certain levels.

This retelling of Bonifacio's life and his reign as the Supremo, the leader of the Katipuneros, acknowledges its weak points by focusing on the use of practical production equipment, art direction, and dramatic encounters among its characters. However, this doesn't always work with what the material really needs. Given the fact that the people behind the project only had two weeks to shoot everything, the film's lack of resources often leads to monotonous scenes -- most of which are reliant on long speeches and conversations with awkward cuts.
