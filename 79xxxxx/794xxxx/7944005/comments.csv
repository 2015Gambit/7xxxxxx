There you go phase700b "
,phase700b,2012-12-21T16:39Z,"I knew you'd have an awesome system!
I use some older Paradigm monitor 11's, a sub with a couple 15's built to fit under a coffee table and a Sunfire sub. It's a small cube that moves a lot of air. http://www.sunfire.com/productdetail.asp?id=8"
,marcus100868,2012-12-21T21:05Z,"That sunfire sub specs sounds like it does some serious bass. My  Bowers & Wilkins sound good but  i miss my  Miller & Kreisel subs!!!!
When i first left Australia in 1973 to live in Switzerland my uncle  had  a music shop i got hooked straightaway into audio never looked back that's my drug of dependence."
,phase700b,2012-12-21T22:25Z,"Yeah. I know what you mean. What I really miss is all the independent audio shops that used to be around. If I was looking for a turntable or whatever, I would spend the whole day driving around checking all the shops. That was half the fun. Those days are gone. At least around here."
,marcus100868,2012-12-21T23:31Z,"Yep, everything is done online now same here a lot the shops i use to go to have closed down! 
not only that my wife has banned me from going to anymore shops!!!!"
,phase700b,2012-12-22T00:27Z,"Yeah, audio equipment isn't really at the top of my wife's list either. "
