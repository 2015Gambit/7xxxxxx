This week, Joel McHale brings you a special "End of the World" episode looking back at everything that has led to our world's demise. We begin by peering back at "The Bachelor" and "The Bachelorette" which has brought us two marriages, 16 proposals, 8 restraining orders and over 134 prescriptions over the past 24 seasons! But first, if you've been watching "Wife Swap," the end of the world will come as no surprise to you, and we're happy to help breakdown why. Then, we take a look at warning signs we should have learned from Lindsay Lohan and the Kardashians. Lastly, we share with you how we plan on surviving the Mayan Apocalypse with Mankini and a few other props!
