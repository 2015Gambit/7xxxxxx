I wish Erl Stanley Gardner's A.A. Fair Lam & Cool novels were that available.

I'd exclaim ""fry me for an oyster!"" if a bunch of the many showed up. [That's Bertha Cool.]

When Gardner's Masons had the market flooded (due to his novel factory) he needed a pen name and new characters to keep busy, so out came his most enjoyable stuff, I'd say."
