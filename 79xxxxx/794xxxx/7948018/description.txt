Hallmark-The Three Gifts (2009) 

Air Date: 21 Dec 2012

Summary: Jack Green inherited a southern Californian horse ranch and an all-natural toy factory in the barn. With his wife Cherie, he accepts taking in the three 'holy terrors' from his bossy aunt Rita's orphanage during renovations, until the holidays. Resourceful Mike and his buddies, Henry and Ray, prove handfuls, but Jack proves father-potential. The trio even goes on best behavior after overhearing the couple considers adopting, but that also means rivaling, resulting in trouble for everyone.
