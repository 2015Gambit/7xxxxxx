Riverdale High's basketball team is on the verge of winning a division title but with Archie benched due to injury, they're going to need all the support they can get! Veronica will do what it takes to get the crowd pumped enough to propel the boys to victory, even if it means pulling off a death defying stunt!

After that, Chuck envisions what the gang's life would be life with robot assistants and it's not what you might expect!
