An album titled Wildly Inappropriate arouses some expectations. Mostly, it prepares the listener for nonstop offensive humor or an otherwise edgy act that will draw out laughs from highly uncomfortable topics. Daryl WrightΓÇÖs debut album, however funny, may be ever-so-slightly mistitled.

The Los Angeles-based comedian has a strong start when the live portion of the album begins. The actual opening features his closing joke remixed into a house music track. (The album also ends with music). Confusing, to say the least. When the music is over, Wright tackles race, class and sexuality. In fact, early on he pleads with the audience to not allow ΓÇ£white guiltΓÇ¥ to mess up the show, reassuring them, ΓÇ£Do any of yaΓÇÖll still own slaves? Then what are you guilty about?ΓÇ¥

Quick to include everybody, he throws in a brilliant race question to the Mexicans in the audience: ΓÇ£Why canΓÇÖt yaΓÇÖll just do the paperwork and just be legal? It comes in Spanish. What the fuck donΓÇÖt?ΓÇ¥ Everyone in the audience is his ΓÇ£dogΓÇ¥ as he creates a vibe similar to that of hanging with friends in your basement.

His jokes are posed to us in simple, yet hilarious, questions that make the strange familiar and the familiar strange. But just when weΓÇÖre getting into the socio-political commentary, the album takes a misleading (or maybe brave?) trajectory. An act usually begins with personal musings that lead up to headier topics. Wright begins with race and class and then suddenly steps back into a story about getting kicked off BET (which like him, I thought, ΓÇ£I didnΓÇÖt know black guys could get kicked off BETΓÇ¥) and another story about him being high during a police chase. Once youΓÇÖre set-up for social issues youΓÇÖre blindsided by seemingly misplaced stories. Once you realign yourself for the change, though, Wright provides his own skillful spin on played-out premises. Ever hear the one that starts with, ΓÇ£Men and women are different?ΓÇ¥
