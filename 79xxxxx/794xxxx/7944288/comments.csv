,Expedio,2012-12-21T20:57Z,I have no problem with you uploading the 1080p in addition to what you would normally upload if you have access to that for episode 8! : )
,dante107,2012-12-21T23:47Z,@ShoReleases if you have access to episode 8 in any quality than upload it or give the source.
,clock3r,2012-12-22T01:28Z,E08 please. Any quality is good for me. 
[T],ShoReleases,2012-12-22T09:30Z,"@Expedio: i do have the 1080 copy of geordie shore but i won't upload it bcz it's 4.40GB and it will be very hard to seed. 
@dante107: nope, don't have access to any rips of ep8. :/"
,Jaq-sparrow,2012-12-22T11:26Z,ShoReleases - You had already said you were uploading it in 2 different formats. Just admit you do not have episode 8 ? you could convert it to a smaller size and format and upload it.. obviously don't have it or your waiting until everyone is licking your arse and then put it on so you look mint or something ha ha ha.. ill upload it when i get it !!
[T],ShoReleases,2012-12-22T12:48Z,"@Jaq-sparrow: When did i say that i have the ep8 ?
I have told a lot of times that to get a SD copy i need a 1080 source which i can't find. 
& btw the 1080 copy that i was talking abt was for ep7 not 8.
All these SHO releases that u see are my work not yours so shut the f*ck up."
[T],ShoReleases,2012-12-22T16:45Z,"Finally got the 1080p copy of ep8, now i just have to convert it into SD. :)"
