This activation patch was made possible because of the information 
provided by means of Beast_iND's activator/patcher and based on the
information provided by microbolt.

All thanks therefore go to them.

This patch should only be a temporary solution until Beast_iND
releases a newer version of his patcher that includes support for
Quickbooks 2013, I personally still prefer his patcher, as his patcher
is comprehensive, as it also supports older versions of Quickbooks.

Changes since the previous version:
v0.11
Added the possibility to automatically close any open Quickbooks or Intuit programs that may interfere with the backing up, replacing and restoring of the patched file, provided a certain Windows program exists.
