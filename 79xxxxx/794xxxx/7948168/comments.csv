,love404,2012-12-23T02:20Z,"Any idea if this works with QuickBooks UK 2013 or QuickBook UK Enterprise 13?

And can it activate the ""Advanced Inventory add-on subscription""?

Thanks"
,ebudget,2012-12-23T14:31Z,"Hi all... everything seems to be working flawlessly...

but the problem is with multi user environment...
when setting multi user environment it asks for the license number of headquarter Server... and we only have one license number so far for installing POS basic and Multi User. POS at remote sides and at the HQ Server needs to be different from each other to connect them.... 

so @wakbokaya we need more license numbers for POS to work sucessfully in Multi Store mode... other wise it is of no USE.

thanks for your work...."

A few things that you can try.
1. Make sure to Run as administrator (right click the shortcut and click Run as administrator)
2. Try loading the practice company file. If that doesn't work try the sample company file. Sometimes it works with one and not the other (random?)
3. If trying that doesn't work, close the program and repeat steps 1 and 2 until it (magically) does what it is supposed to do."
