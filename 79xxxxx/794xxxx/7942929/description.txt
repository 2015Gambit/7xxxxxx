Summary:

MirandaΓÇÖs disbelief turns to fear in a split second when a meteor knocks the moon closer to the earth. How should her family prepare for the future when worldwide tsunamis wipe out the coasts, earthquakes rock the continents, and volcanic ash blocks out the sun? As summer turns to Arctic winter, Miranda, her two brothers, and their mother retreat to the unexpected safe haven of their sunroom, where they subsist on stockpiled food and limited water in the warmth of a wood-burning stove.

Told in journal entries, this is the heart-pounding story of MirandaΓÇÖs struggle to hold on to the most important resource of all--hope--in an increasingly desperate and unfamiliar world. - Goodreads Summary of Life As We Knew It


Tip: This book deals with many internal and emotional struggles between values, and adjusting to a new life and other serious topics. So not the best book for everybody.
