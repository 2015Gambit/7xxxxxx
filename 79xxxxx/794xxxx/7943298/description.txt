A simple and tested system to reduce or eliminate procrastination, meet your goals and live the life and lifestyle you choose. A radical departure from self help books, this book is grounded in research about individual productivity, time management and goal achievement. The author explains in detail why past goal attainment efforts have failed. What follows is a step by step system to experiencing a better life. 

The book presents a formula in both metaphor and steps for experiencing measurable results in income, personal competence, self confidence and core traits required for getting off the hamster wheel of life. Devoid completely of metaphysical thinking, this is an approach for real people in the real world that want to have a better life.
