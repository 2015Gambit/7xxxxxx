Christmas always has been and always will be an important holiday, but during the ΓÇÖ40s it took on a special meaning. For some, it meant the cessation of hostilities and a chance for a good meal; for others, it was the time of the year when the pangs for a missing loved one were particularly acute. And as always, Christmas meant a celebration of spirit, family andΓÇömost importantly during that momentous decadeΓÇöhope. WeΓÇÖve collected 25 of the most beloved holiday-themed recordings from the ΓÇÖ40s for your listening enjoymentΓÇöwe daresay theyΓÇÖll make your 21st-century Christmas celebrations a little brighter.
