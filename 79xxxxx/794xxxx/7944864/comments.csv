,Bagelking37,2012-12-21T22:35Z,"CHANGELOG:

blank out attacks on spiders just after den spawn
disable pighouse exhaustion (for now)
warrior spider have somewhat random attack periods (so that they don't pounce you at the same time)
fewer spiders are released when hitting a nest, and fewer of them are warriors
warrior spider attacks less frequently, and does less damage
seeds grow time and drop rates are a bit less nerfed
fix gold getting stuck on pig king's head
fix exploding beemine-in-backpack
treeguards shouldn't spawn invisibly any more"
