When Frank Zappa teamed up with renowned conductor Kent Nagano and the
London Symphony Orchestra for three days in January 1983, he was expecting
to walk away with a set of stellar performances of some of his most
challenging contemporary classical pieces, as done by one of the world's top
symphonic ensembles.

What he got instead were bad attitudes, terrible work habits, unforgiving
union stipulations and a hard lesson in preconceived notions - showing him that
working with unschooled but enthusiastic rock musicians also had its advantages,
and giving rise to his well-documented love/hate (mostly hate) relationship with
symphony orchestras thereafter.

According to Zappa, the LSO crew were hardly expecting a hard day's toil from
the works of a 'rocker', resulting in so many screw-ups that much of the
material had to be heavily edited after the fact in the studio.

This 1995 edition combines the two London Symphony Orchestra volumes released
on vinyl in the mid-80's into a single 2-CD set, even re-sequencing the
material to reflect Frank Zappa's original, idealized performance order.

For fans of Zappa's so called 'serious' music (i.e. not rock-based),
London Symphony Orchestra Vol. I & II offers both premier and re-arranged
compositions taken from his massive past oeuvre.
