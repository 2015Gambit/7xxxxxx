HATRED does not condone in selling warez of any kind

HATRED does not respect any p2p networks, NFOrce or
anything to make the scene more public

HATRED does not believe in using a lesser protected
executables whether it be a steam exe, unprot exe
demo exe, activemark exe, direct2drive exe or any
other weaker protected exe to make a cheap copy/paste
code exe and then label it as a crack. Nor do we
believe in any other sorts of cheap workarounds

We greet the respectable groups like:

DEVIANCE - HOODLUM - RELOADED - GENESIS - BACKLASH
DELIGHT - FAIRLIGHT - RAZOR1911 - IMMERSION - POSTMORTEM
