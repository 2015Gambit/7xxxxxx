From Wiki:

Joe Jackson (born David Ian Jackson, 11 August 1954[1]) is an English musician and singer-songwriter now living in Berlin, whose five Grammy Award nominations span from 1979 to 2001.[2] He is probably best known for the 1979 hit song and first single "Is She Really Going Out with Him?", which still gets extensive US FM radio airplay; for his 1982 hit, "Steppin' Out"; and for his 1984 success with "You Can't Get What You Want (Till You Know What You Want)". He was popular for his pop/rock and New Wave music early on before moving to more eclectic, though less commercially successful, pop/jazz/classical hybrids.

This Is It! (The A&M Years 1979ΓÇô1989), released in February 1997, is a Joe Jackson compilation double album, covering his period with A&M Records between 1979 and 1989.

Allmusic journalist, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, states, "... is a double-disc, 37-track collection covering Joe Jackson's commercial and creative heyday. Over the course of two discs, This Is It! runs through all of his biggest hits ΓÇö "Is She Really Going Out with Him?", "It's Different for Girls," "Steppin' Out", "Breaking Us in Two", "You Can't Get What Want (Till You Know What You Want)" ΓÇö plus a number of significant album tracks and lesser-known singles, making it a comprehensive retrospective of Jackson's pop-oriented work. While it's unfortunate that the compilation stops just short of his last pop album, 1991's Laughter & Lust, because it was released on Virgin Records, the great majority of his best work is here, making it a perfect choice for fans who want something more ΓÇö and better assembled ΓÇö than Greatest Hits, and those who don't want to dig as deep as the actual albums".[3]

In his book, The Great Rock Discography, journalist Martin C. Strong awards the album 8 out of 10.
