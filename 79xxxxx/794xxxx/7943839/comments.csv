,WasAtWoodstock,2012-12-21T19:40Z,Could you please tell us more about this. I have a 23 CD assembled version that is supposed to be as complete as possible. Is this a commercial release? By whom?
,Bjellesau,2012-12-30T18:12Z,"There is a 37 cd, more or less complete (I can't jugde this) festival. And it is seeded, this is not seeded. Been at 23% for a week.
