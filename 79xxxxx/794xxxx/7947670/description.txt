
Episodes 16-32 of Naruto Shippuuden cut together so that it more accurately follows the manga.  

Some parts might seem odd because they are "out of anime" order, where a scene in the manga may follow all at one time, that same scene could be broken up and otherwise presented in the anime timeline.  Some stuff isn't in the manga.  I tried to keep all the fun fight scenes cut in, even if they weren't detailed in the manga.  

In the same sense I tried to remove any extraneous back-story or flashbacks, because we've all seen the show and know the back-story...besides the fact that its already 4hrs long.  Some parts flow better in the anime presentation or there is too much missing to put together a decent manga version exactly.  

So while it does follow the manga more closely, MUCH MORE CLOSELY, than the original anime, sometimes its a mixed bag.  

Make sure and watch after the credits for a "secret scene" hehe
