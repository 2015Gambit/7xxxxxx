Version 15.1 did not have this problem."

,rabid_parrots,2013-01-03T00:59Z,"""Rebuild"" means adding the ""non-free"" or paid software to the BootCD, which the original author, ie, Hiren, has stopped providing (due to legal/personal issues).

This is done to ensure that no one will be able to blame Hiren, if the FBI comes up and tries to accuse him of piracy."
