Sam AdamΓÇÖs Commercial
Tim McMorris - Overwhelmed


From the first time I saw you

I knew that youΓÇÖd be mine

And from the first glance you gave

My world it slowed, you stopped the time

 

And in that moment I could see all of the things that we would be

You were the girl I was waiting for, thatΓÇÖd IΓÇÖd ask to marry me

 

Like the beauty of the sun you light my life so I can see

You make me laugh and show me how, just how good this life can be

And in our moments filled with joy, is where I live, where I am free

Lay in my arms, IΓÇÖll hold you tight, just like you like, continually

 

And I am, over-whelmed, by you

Am, over come with joy

YouΓÇÖve, taken me higher, and shown me what love can do

Where would I go, or be, without you

 

ThereΓÇÖs something in your smile that gives me strength to carry on

And there something in your words that lingers even when your gone

Oh IΓÇÖve dreamt, that a time like this would come, fulfill my life

Who could of known the one whoΓÇÖd bring it here would be my lovely wife

 

I could sing a thousand songs about you still that would not do

ThereΓÇÖs a million tiny things that make the things that you do, you

I wouldnΓÇÖt trade our time together, wouldnΓÇÖt trade for anything

Cause nothing else here in the world can bring the happiness you bring

 

And I am, over-whelmed, by you

Am, over come with joy

YouΓÇÖve, taken me higher, and shown me what love can do

Where would I go, or be, without you
