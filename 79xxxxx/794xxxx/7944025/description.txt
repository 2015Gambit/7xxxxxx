
Two young men begin their final year of secondary school sporting a new look. Romain (Victor Chambon) appears on his first day after summer holidays decked out in a punk rock leather/razorblade/spike-coloured hair ensemble that startles his new classmates (abandoning the restrictive dress code of private school for the far more ΓÇ£libreΓÇ¥ public), causing the matron to nearly swallow her herding whistle. Much further down the economic food chain, Eric (Valentin Ducommun who rewards the camera from every angle), tries not to smile and reveal his just-installed braces. Then, before you can say ΓÇ£find a new best friend,ΓÇ¥ EricΓÇÖs previous bud has been transferred to another form, leaving the orthodontically improved teen seated beside the make-up enhanced Goth.

In what can only be described as love at first fright, Eric is soon showing his sudden soul mate the secret passageways of the school basement only to be ensnarled in a two-way game of oxygen deprivation and the tantalizing appearance of a crotch grab.
