I Looked everywhere for one of these and it was a pain in the ass.  So I am putting it here for you guys to enjoy.

This is a Blizzard Like Server which you can run on your home computer and can be used to play offline and single player World of Warcraft mode.  This repack is for client Version 3.3.5 which you can find here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5897534/World_of_Warcraft_-_3.3.5a_(12340)_-_enUS_(No_Install)

Just open it up and go to the WTF Folder, and edit file realm.wtf to say 127.0.0.1 instead of the IP that is there.  

1.) Extract to C: 
2.) Go to Server Folder and open MySQL.bat
3.) Go to Trinity Folder and open authserver.exe and worldserver.exe
4.) Start Wow.exe from your game client version 3.3.5a required. 
5.) Login your offline/private server using login: admin password: admin 
6.) Optional:  Give your friends your IP and tell them to edit the realms.wtf file to your IP (If you want people to play with you, or you can list your server and make it public)
