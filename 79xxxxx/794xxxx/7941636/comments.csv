,Khalid7,2012-12-25T11:31Z,"tommysukamto

it depends upon your Processor!"
,cold25th,2012-12-25T18:35Z,"if you want the fastest computing use the 32bit/x86 system if you want the most crisp display and normal speed on a cpu that can run 64 bit then run the 64bit system.  but even if you got a 64 bit system and you want the fastest computing speed always chose 32/x86 bit system, it may seam like a slight downgrade from 64 bit but its faster. if you got a 32bit cpu and you install a 64bit system onto it it will be really really slow. and i think faster is better don't you?"
,subbu123,2012-12-26T06:52Z,How can i unlock personalization.I cant change my profile pictures and colours.please help me...!!!!

,marwin1234,2012-12-27T13:10Z,"@cold25th: You don't really know what you're talking about. x64 is _always_ preferable if you can run it on your system. 

The talk about x86 being faster and crisp screen is confusing..

,TheReal9,2012-12-27T15:52Z,"This ""activator"" is crap. All it does is corrupt some system files to remove the water mark. KMS is the only true activation method. Search google ""Windows 8 KMS activation"" and the first result should help anyone using this torrent."
