The lineup of this jam session is quite remarkable with trumpeters Clifford Brown, Clark Terry, and Maynard Ferguson, altoist Herb Geller, tenor saxophonist Harold Land, Richie Powell, or Junior Mance on piano, Keeter Betts or George Morrow on bass, and drummer Max Roach. A nearly 15-minute "What Is This Thing Called Love" gives one the opportunity to compare the three very different trumpeters, "Darn That Dream" is a ballad feature for singer Dinah Washington, "Move" is taken at an incredible tempo which holds up for 14-and-a-half minutes and this set concludes with a four-song ballad medley; Brownie's playing on "It Might as Well Be Spring" is classic. A brilliant set that is highly recommended.
