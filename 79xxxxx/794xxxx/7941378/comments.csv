He told me he was going to be on this season so I'm excited to see him in this episode.When I told him I upload the show he was like ""You do what now?"" - he's a creative person so he's forgiven."
,Sweep09,2012-12-20T11:25Z,thanks
,vleonc,2012-12-20T15:39Z,I was shocked with who won... really didnt expect it!
,chernye,2012-12-21T06:21Z,Dylan Cooper is an amazing designer and i was so fucking happy he won :D cheers mate
,UglyDucklingxyz,2012-12-21T09:40Z,Could you cut it out with the spoilers? Even if they are about last season?
[T],rkstr,2012-12-21T10:25Z,"@UglyDucklingxyz - no,I won't!!!.These are MY uploads and if I want to share a bit of inside gossip I'm more than entitled to.Its not my problem you haven't watched last years season.Don't read the comments if you need to but don't be dictating to ME what I can or can't write on my own uploads."
[T],rkstr,2012-12-21T11:24Z,"that previous comment was way harsh but seriously? being told not to discuss the outcome of a show from over a year ago?? If you're a fan you would have watched it and if you watch this episode they tell you who won last year so whats the difference??
So i can't even share some inside info on here? whats the joy of doing this?I really don't know why I bother sometimes. Yeah I sound like a whiner but i don't see anyone else do what I do"
,AaarMatey,2012-12-26T15:55Z,"Hey rkstr, do you happen to have season 3 of PRAU sitting on a hard drive somewhere?  I haven't seen that season and I don't care about spoilers.  Someone else has most of S03 up (but low seeds and prob not quality files as yours) but if you had at least episodes 3, 5, and the finale of season 3 I'd sure appreciate it!"
,AaarMatey,2012-12-26T15:56Z,Oh my...  I just realized the person who's kvetching about you posting spoilers is the one who posted what episodes of season 3 are available!  What's THAT all about?!
