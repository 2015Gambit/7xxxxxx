Publication Date: January 30, 2013 | Series: The Unplug Series

A humorous gift book that takes a tongue-in-cheek look at our love of social media through a series of 50 hilarious cartoons that complete the question "You Know You're a Facebook Addict When...?" by identifying the more idiotic, embarrassing and cringe-worthy behaviors of our social networking excess.


With over 1 billion people now on Facebook (that's 1 in every 7 people on the planet) and 34% of all users checking their account before brushing their teeth or hair in the mornings, it seems most can confess to an addictive Facebook habit; whether it's stalking an ex, faking bathroom breaks to read news, checking-in wherever they go, or art-directing photo's for the perfect profile pic.


Many get frustrated with the screen-centric behaviors of their Facebook junkie friends, partners, colleagues or family members. Yet telling others to break the habit--or at least tame it--isn't easy.


Author and illustrator, Gemini Adams, inspires them to examine the health of their high-tech habits and possibly consider taking The Facebook Diet by following the funny tech-detox tips that encourage readers to unplug once in a while.


An entertaining gift book for the Facebook junkie in every family.
