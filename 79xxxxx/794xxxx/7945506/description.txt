About the Game:

Blur is an arcade racing video game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Activision in North America and Europe. 
It features a racing style that incorporates real world cars and locales with arcade style handling and vehicular combat.
In Blur's career mode, the player will encounter numerous characters and many licensed cars ranging from Dodge Vipers to Lotus Exiges to Ford Transit vans fitted with F1 engines, 
all of which have full damage modeling and separate traits such as Acceleration, Speed, Drift, Grip and Stability. 
Some special car models have been designed by Bizarre Creations themselves. 
There are also some heavily altered versions of familiar urban environments, such as the Los Angeles river halfpipe and several parts of London. 
These areas were altered to make the races more enjoyable instead of the developers having to strictly abide by each twist and turn. 
The game can be played with up to 4 players via splitscreen (even on the PC version, by the use of at least one Xbox controller and the keyboard) and the game can be taken online with a maximum of 20.
During the career, challenges will take place midrace when the player drives through a fan icon.......
