Besides the tasty West coast Bop this album contains - it is remarkable in

at least 2 other ways.



1)  The quasi-salacious album cover pic (included)



2)  The engineering of the audio where the rhythm section is in one channel
    
    and the soloists are in the other.  This arrangement is fine for a CD

    but it would punish a "record player"
