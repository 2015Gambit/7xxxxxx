Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Friday December 21 edition of the show, Alex continues his coverage of the unfolding drama behind the exploitation of the Sandy Hook shooting and the full-court press by the government to disarm the American people by hook or by crook and the continued brazen manipulation of the story by the establishment media. 

Alex also talks about Obama's impending cybersecurity executive order and he covers other important news items. He also tracks the 2012 doomsday hoax. 

On today's show, Alex talks with British writer and public speaker David Icke. David is the author of numerous books, including Love Changes Everything and Remember Who You Are: Remember 'Where' You Are and Where You 'Come' From.
