,Whitebb,2012-12-21T17:34Z,"It is HD (HD is not 720p or more, a little lower what called HD)"
,xclamation,2012-12-28T18:28Z,"sorry Whitebb, but SoNicJensen is correct, your vid is not HD. HD minimum is 720p"
,Knightmare,2013-01-05T12:39Z,"Definitely not High Definition.
Quality isn't that great.  But it is watchable.

According to current media quality standards, for a video to be classified as ""HD""...it has to be a MINIMUM of 720p. (Yes, I did look it up)

In otherwords, SoNicJesen and xclamation are correct..."
