Well, here's the final part of Pirate This Book.  Enjoy.  As always, seed it if you like it, or print out individual essays and do what you like with those.  Information was meant to be free, just like people.

Unfortunately, as some of you have surely noticed, U.S. ISPs have begun to block the Pirate Bay.  I'll just assume (since you're here) that you know how to use a proxy, and hope it doesn't affect my readership too much.  Peace!
