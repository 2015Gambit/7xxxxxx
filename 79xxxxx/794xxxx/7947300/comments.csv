,wharfrat22,2013-01-01T20:32Z,Is this torrent even working? Thanks.
,mdbrim,2013-01-01T20:55Z,wharfrat22... we are all still trying to download it to see if it works... need more seeds!
,izzypirate,2013-01-02T03:30Z,"everyone who downloaded this, please seed until it gets stable, I will seed the next two months.. it looks it s working."
,bob2939,2013-01-03T08:49Z,"I can't seem to get it to download properly. The download is blazingly fast at over 1.5 mB/s for the first 300 mB and then it quickly slows and stops at around 304 mB for no apparent reason. It also stops uploading, can't seem to figure out why but for the time being, I can't get this torrent downloaded."
,izzypirate,2013-01-03T11:15Z,"Genius Bob, there are 1 seed and 200 leechers, the first 300 meg has been downloaded from all these 200 people, so there's 200 seed for the first 300Mb, but the rest 800Mb is from the 1 seed which gives it to all 200 persons, please if you finished the downloading, seed until it get stable."
,wharfrat22,2013-01-04T00:21Z,2 seeders now...yayyy :)
,dark3vin,2013-01-08T05:20Z,Seed pls!! D:
,izzypirate,2013-01-09T13:16Z,"hey guys, if you already have CS6 installed and cracked, you can easily update to latest version of 13.0.3 retina support, just go to this link and download from adobe, http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/thankyou.jsp?ftpID=5448&fileID=5527
, it s safe, I did it and it works perfectly."
,bob2939,2013-01-10T00:20Z,"izzypirate that does not work for me unfortunately. When I go to install the update it tells me that this version is not for me, no idea why. Although I get the exact same ""error"" message if I try to update an Adobe program I don't even have, say Illustrator. So it's almost as if it doesn't see my copy of Photoshop installed, albeit cracked. Nonetheless, update doesn't work, so it's come down to torrenting the latest version."
