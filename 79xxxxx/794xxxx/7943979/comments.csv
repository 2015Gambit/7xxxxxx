,9Tenths,2012-12-21T13:53Z,"It's worth noting that the surround channels (rear left & right) still have the Russian audio - or at least they do in the sample. So you get English audio from the front channels and a Russian ""echo"" from the rear channels. Very distracting."
,piratebuddha,2012-12-21T16:45Z,"Yes, there is a very faint Russian audio echo and some might find it distracting but it is very faint. Overall I think this version will def hold me over until a better rip is available so thank you @protoyu for sharing with us."

,Tleilaxu_Ghola,2012-12-22T17:34Z,"RE: rear channel russian audio>

if you are using PodPlayer or VLC you can disable or mute the specific rear audio/surround channels in the advanced audio settings and it sounds perfect. No faint russian audio at all. "
,PetaFlux,2012-12-22T21:00Z,"I turned it off after the first explicit homosexual scene. 
It is disgusting, how the cultural marxist communist are hammering in how great and desirable it is to be a faggot.
Crawl the fuck back in to your closets!"

Thanks a lot, I didn't expect to see a high res version of this movie so soon :)"
,kjsma,2012-12-23T02:32Z,"PetaFlux - How was the audio/video? Oh of course, you were too busy letting your pitifully backward and pathetic homophobia get in the way of you giving us any useful comment about the movie. You are the one in the closet... Trapped. Come and see for yourself, there's nothing to be afraid of little fella..."

,Fuzi0719,2012-12-23T13:57Z,"Sorry PetaFlux, not going back into a closet, we're out and proud and nothing you can do about it. So, when are YOU coming out, finally?"
,Spankinator94,2012-12-23T14:08Z,"Using VLC and g35 surround headset. I removed the ""Dolby surround"" setting in VLC and turned off surround completly in the task menu sound options.

After that and before tbh, the audio+video worked perfectly, like any other bluray 720p rip!

There are some scenes where you can hear the feint russian voices, but that's only scenes inside some ""echoey"" rooms. Nothing that annoys me really.

All in all everyday bluray quality, just like a 100% clean bluray-rip imo"
,stalker277,2012-12-23T19:03Z,"I always run ffdshow with Center at 300%, my setup seems to not like 5.1 very much and the music is way too loud, didn't notice the surround sounds.

The native English bits are a bit puzzling... can't make out the scope of the conversation, just some words."
,hetsig111,2012-12-23T21:46Z,Would be nice if someone could be a little more specific on how to turn off that russian audio
,Toker_Wolf,2012-12-23T22:01Z,"started to download this last night before bed. tried to watch it just now. really pissed that I can't read the russian parts and the audio is really bad.

 deleted my download, gonna wait for a better release. dont waste your time with this unless you can read russian

hey Goodfilms, they took down the subs! can't download it anymore"

,jagr_200,2012-12-24T05:54Z,Fag sex ruined a potentially decent movie. Same thing was said about Broke Back Mountain.
,nbmatt,2012-12-24T10:33Z,"@jagr_200: If you're the piece of shit homophobe you appear to be, why the fuck did you even watch Brokeback Mountain? At no point did they market that film as not being about two gay cowboys. It makes absolutely no sense for you to even bother watching it if you're that uncomfortable with your own sexuality.

Two dude's fuckin' or two chicks fuckin' -- if you're not one of them, how is it a problem?"
,moshster,2012-12-25T00:42Z,"Center channel is far too low volume.  Yeah sure, ffdshow, VLC or even the AV processor controls can boost it but then it sounds out of mix with the rest of the soundtrack.  It's a bit too odd sounding to endure for nearly 3 hours.  Good movie, worth waiting for a proper rip."
,seednope,2012-12-25T01:11Z,"Downloading now, and thanks to protoyu for the up AND your painstaking unfucking of the audio track. I hope a million dicks get sucked by dudes in this movie. So excited to see this, I even thought about seeding...but nope. "
,adelice,2012-12-25T17:30Z,"PetaFlux, this movie is not for you. You really don't get the ideias this movie is depcting."
,COBRAE86,2012-12-25T18:17Z,"PetaFlux is right. They want everyone to think its cool and ok to be gay. Its not. Why do the gays have to do their parades everywhere, where they walk to streets kissing each other in skimpy outfits. Straight people dont do that. We're straight, we know it, and we don't go 'advertising' that we're straight. If your gay, thats ok, stay gay, but dont brag about it."
,revlar351,2012-12-25T23:08Z,"There's only two gay characters in the whole movie, and that they have sex is only implied once.

One of the messages of the movie is that boundaries like sexuality and race are just illusions.

If you really have such a problem with it, skip those scenes. This is a great movie and the quality of this version is more than watchable."
,ams30gts,2012-12-26T01:52Z,Are there any non-English parts that require the subtitles?  Or are they hard coded like some.
,kolozz,2012-12-26T03:04Z,PetaFlux is a homophobe.
,slaneesh,2012-12-26T03:20Z,"A/V/M 9/9/7

The movie stays interesting through most of the 3 hours which is quite a feat, in spite of that the conclussion falls flat unable to tie the different stories together with nothing but the idea that they all underwent the same ""Natural Order"". 

Interesting, but if youÂ´ve played Mass Effect 3 you will understand what i mean by the ending"
,][V][,2012-12-26T05:18Z,"Hi protoyu,

thanks for your hard work, am i the only one who can not play this on my PBO standalone player? i mean i never have problem playing anything on that player, i can play your file on my PC, no problem but when i send it to player, there is audio but not video and the player is saying 0fps and cant play, then i tried playing it with UMS from PC, still no luck, tried using mkvmerge to remux it with and also with out header compression, still no luck, i even tried the same thing with MeGUI, no luck either , then i tried to change the container from mkv to mp4 using MeGUI, no luck either, so i gave up and opened MeGUI and start encoding the movie all over again, it just finished the first pass and started the second pass an hour ago and is telling me another 14 hours to go, so i just have to wait to see if its going to solve the problem but i like to know what could be wrong?, is it my system or maybe your encoding? , no one else seems to having the same problem but i guss that's because maybe they just watching it using the PC which i don't have problem playing it there either, any way, i would appreciated if you could give me some kind of hint and anyone ells also if you guys have an idea why this is happening, it would be grate to shear it with me please, thank you all

by the way just in case if you are thinking, my player firmware is up to date, that player is been playing 2 - 3 movies every day for the past 3 years, and it can play almost any format its running a custom firmware with a full and most codecpack exists out there.

thank you all again and have wonderful holiday.

,LEXX911,2012-12-29T05:05Z,Video is playing nicely on the PC but trying to play it through both my media players on my tv it doesn't work. One media player you can hear the audio but no picture the the other one just not playing it. 
,coykoi,2012-12-29T08:30Z,Best quality on tpb.
,The_Tech_Guy,2012-12-30T02:43Z,"The reason this movie won't play on media players is because the H264 level profile is set too high. It is at 5.2 when it should be 4.0.

A 5 minute fix is to load the file into tsMuxer, change the level to 4.0, remux as a M2TS file and play on your media player. You could also select demux and then use MKVMerge to remux a MKV afer you have changed the level."

,dispo1,2013-01-03T15:01Z,"This torrent probably has the best quality video for the size, but the sound is completely fucked.  The idiot who's really proud of himself for making the surround sound mix out of the Russian audio completely fucked up.  You can hear an annoying echo of Russia voices in many random scenes.

This is the only one I found that has quality audio without the Russian echo, but the video quality of that one is shit, even though everyone in the comments are saying that it's good.  The vid actually flickers, it's so low resolution.  The vid quality of that one is worse than the YIFY release.  Is there a torrent with quality as good as this BIDA release, but with the same sound as that G3noc1d3 release?"

,icepilots,2013-01-05T12:22Z,"I agree. The video is good (except for Russian writing), however the audio has many issues when played back on a 5.1 surround system.

The audio is *very* difficult to understand a lot of the time. This leads to really not getting the whole plot as entire sections of the movie are not understandable.

I really wish a decent copy of both video and audio existed - as this seems like a really good movie - but the audio spoils it."
