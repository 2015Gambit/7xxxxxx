You all know that video is superb. But audio WAS NOT.
Copying from HQ Hive-CM8's NFO

"The russian Bluray had great quality, just didnt have english audio on it.
Got that nice Stereo Studio audio cpl hrs before and decided to make a really nice
version out of it. Just muxing it to any avi around would have done the trick and
could have been first with it, but that would be lame. So, i went the extra mile
on it to get you a perfect copy. I cleaned the russian audio track from russian
voice which was a pita, loads of talking in the channels. finally after 5h all
was done, and i entered the studio audio back into the russian track.
Sounds now really nice and almost retailish,
will do me till retail around march 2013"


This seemed good enough to be uploaded. I've left a video sample and an audio sample, so CHECK THAT before downloading the whole thing.
