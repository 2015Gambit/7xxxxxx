Gabe, a photographer, his assistant, Annie, and his boss hire a ship to take them out to sea on a modeling shoot. What Gabe doesn't know is that an old friend-turned-enemy of his has indirectly lured him into the situation, and the models that were hired locally are skilled weapons handlers and dealers. The ship is on its way to meet a South African submarine to whom Dean means to sell a piece of high-tech and illegal cargo. Everything goes horribly wrong when Dean, the captain, the models and Gabe all start killing each other and they spend the rest of the film trying to survive
