The Airport Zurich (formerly Zurich-Kloten) is the main airport of Switzerland. Situated approx. 13 km from the city center it has three runways with two of them crossing each other. The airport has three Docks (A, B and E) whereas Dock B, being the oldest, was put out of service for aviation purposes in 2003. Until 2008 Dock B was available for events and exhibitions. Since then it has been knocked down and replaced with a completely new building which will be taken into service in 2011.
