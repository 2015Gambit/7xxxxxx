An activator for Quickbooks 2013 products for Windows which should include Quickbooks POS 2013 and Quickbooks Enterprise 13.0.

It is simply a batch file (so anyone can see the code) and a patched dll file.
This was based solely on information from Beast_iND's activator and information provided by microbolt. So all thanks go to them.

The activator needs to be run as an administrator. If you don't run it as such you will be prompted to do so.

Both files need to be in the same directory.
