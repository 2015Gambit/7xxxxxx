I couldn't get QB POS 2013 to accept either one of the keys. I was not using the Trial installer, I was using the official one. When I tired dechronic's patcher when I got to the step to reopen it, it would not load up to the point where I could hit help. It would just try to sign into a company profile and loop there."
