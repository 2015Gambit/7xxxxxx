,mikegeraghty,2012-12-23T21:32Z,"Hi MsFenmore
Would it be a big ask of you to put in description
Dec 21st 2012 US-Show = Dec 20th 2012 Canadian Or is it
Dec 20th 2012 Canadian = Dec 21st 2012 US show or whatever way it is 
as I get confused
Thanks for all hard work providing Y&R for us all"

[T],MsFenmore,2012-12-23T22:35Z,"Yes, I guess some of you have to edit the date if you want them files to have the US-Date...! But I safe my files with the CAN Date and put them up with the US-Date...so I guess it is confusing for some of you! Sorry about that..but thatÂ´s why I always put the US-Date into the description..! "
