,treedude,2012-12-21T20:36Z,"What exactly is the difference?

You can't download apps for free.

The market icon changes from an android folder to a happy face folder.

The internet gets noticeably slower.

I would not recommend downloading this."

this is only for rooted phones. it allows you to install/use apps protected with google license verification without cracking. it replaces the need for lucky patcher on many apps."

Thanks! But will my Google Play Store app still be updated?"
,cinistur,2012-12-26T05:23Z,"Hobbit, You've given us a terrific app.  This works better than all previous Lucky Patchers out there bar none.  Finally got Screenshot UX and Meatballs HD Live wallpaper to work without license issues popping up.  Thanks for your upload."
