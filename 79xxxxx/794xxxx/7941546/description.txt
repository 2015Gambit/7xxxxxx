In an empty, abandoned linoleum factory, west of London, some of the legends of rock, blues and jazz were brought together for an historic and amazing session. Who was there? Eric Clapton was, and Jack Bruce and Buddy Guy, meeting Eric for the first time in what was to be a long relationship of the two greatest blues guitarists of a generation. Great drummers Buddy Miles and John Hiseman and the enigmatic superstar Stephen Stills. The extraordinary jazz legend Roland Kirk plays with his Quartet and then jams with the rockers. The Modern Jazz quartet, one of the greatest ensembles in the history of modern music, add an ethereal, spacey calm to the proceedings. Only to have it shattered by Buddy, Jack, Buddy, Dick Heckstall-Smith, jumping on Mary Had A Little Lamb! A powerful, haunting recording of one of the last great sixties musical events.
