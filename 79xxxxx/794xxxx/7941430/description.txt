My first uploaded torrent so be nice people!! I'll seed for a long while until I know the album will be seeded by many others besides me.  However, I thought since this was missing from Piratebay, I would go and add it.

Although the file names will be a tad different, I altered the album for much easier incorporation into iTunes - sorry apple-haters!  The quality is based off of apple, this is the iTunes Store version that I'm uploading.

Disclaimer: I own none of Disney's music, movies, or names associated with such.  I fully support buying the soundtracks and support the artists.  Please buy the album on CD at least if you like this album, folks!!! :D
