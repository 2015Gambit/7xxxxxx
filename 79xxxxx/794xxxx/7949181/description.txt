
.357 String Band - Lighting From The North (2010) mp3


Lightning From the North, The .357s third full length album is indeed that bluegrass album with a punk heart that so many other records wish they could be when they grow up and are old enough to not only buy lottery tickets, but to also rob the store theyll buy those tickets from. Crisp but grimey, the authority with which these pickers ply their craft is remarkable. The authentic, boozy and brawling vocals of Derrick Dunn are often augmented by the hillbilly harmonies that are yelped in a backwoods style call and response with the rest of the band. These 14 songs simply tear it up. Take notes, wannabees.
