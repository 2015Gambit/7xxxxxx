,techranjit,2012-12-22T13:50Z,"I am an Indian,I feel Indian movies are not taking india anywhere.
It is just spoiling the peoples mind with all these fantasy and masala movies where there is no head,neck and tail.
I blame bollywood and the government of india ,which make and give licences to these kind of movies and spoil indian citizens mind.
india will never develop because of these unrealistic movies,which is nothing to with our life or anybodies life.
Indian people are leading a masala life!!young people are not living in a realistic world !"
