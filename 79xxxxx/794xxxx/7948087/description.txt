FabFilter AiO Pack 12-2012


FabFilter.Micro.v1.11
FabFilter Micro's single filter is smooth and creamy, yet easily turns into raw saturation and self-oscillation when tweaked using the interactive filter display. It features low-pass and high-pass shapes and an envelope follower to modulate the cut-off frequency.



FabFilter.One.v3.21
For FabFilter One, we have put tremendous effort in creating the best cut-off filter ever. Our new design approach has resulted in the fattest and smoothest self-oscillating digital filter you have ever heard. It has been tuned carefully to achieve the character and warmth of a classic analog synthesizer. FabFilter Oneâ™s filter sounds raw but never cheap or ‘digitalâ™, even at full resonance.



FabFilter.Pro-C.v1.21-R2R

FabFilter.Pro-DS.v1.02
