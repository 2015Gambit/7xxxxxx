hey if you could perhaps record the unsealed conspiracy files and unsealed ufo files as scene have missed those for us i believe they are still re-airing over dec/jan?"
,k3nd00d,2012-12-21T05:25Z,"Never heard of them. I don't tend to be into ufos, but I'll look into unsealed conspiracy files."
,scooter1944,2012-12-21T08:18Z,"I'm really enjoying this series, but there seems to be a slight error. According to TV sources, This should be Episode #8, your episode #6 should be #7, your episode #5 should be #6, so ""Episode #5 Doomsday: book of revelation: the end is near"" is missing from your collection - Any Chance that you can get it?"
,pjones452,2012-12-21T09:16Z,thank you!

Some TV listing guides say that, and they are wrong. Just ask yourself: Does that title even make sense when compared to other episode titles? It is a completely different one off ""special"". Here is a link to it: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7923659/National.Geographic.Doomsday.Book.of.Revelation.The.End.is.Near."

[V],psspss,2012-12-22T09:32Z,"well you may like ufo stuff too if ever watch it
jus thave to watch a decent docu first then your be hooked
also I add some conspiracy stuff and doomsday stuff like planet -x to my ufo bundles

which I recommend to watch as

mayb e doomsday is when meteor or ufos comes

but planet-x is really our suns twin.. as we are the only solar system with one sun.. ODD huh
so its the other sun on a 2600 year orbit and
about to pass by us and cause meteors to go of course to us.. e..g maybe how the dinos died?

all interesting theories.. dont mean it happen on 21st dec 2012... but then some say its 2013 cos year 0 wasnt counted.. so be prepared :)"
,scooter1944,2012-12-22T22:40Z,Thanks for straightening this out for me - very much appreciated.

[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2013-01-09T12:11Z,"I thought after Mayan prophesy failed a lot of these nutters would stop . 
Alas they don't  , too many idiots with too much time and money to waste . They spend more time worrying and prepping instead of just enjoying life . What's even more amusing when it's some old cunt in their 70's  spending their last on more food to store away . The food is gonna outlast these lunatics easily . lol"
,k3nd00d,2013-01-09T18:17Z,"@steevo .. shut up stupid, why are you spamming this shit on all of these torrents of this show? If you ever watch the show, none of it was ever about 2012 or Mayan bullshit. Retard."
