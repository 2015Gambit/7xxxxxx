,rooock,2012-12-21T09:10Z,"in other words, we dont need this update since we cant do shit online"
,JerombaCZ,2012-12-21T11:46Z,"rooock: right, thats why I always ask uploader to copy changelog not typing that phrase ""read changes in changelog"" etc. This one is completely useless coz as you say you need original game for online play and why would someone dload this while Origin updates games automatically."
,pirateGRC,2012-12-21T16:11Z,"""Note: This release will update v1.5 of the game to v1.6.""

Can you please also upload the ""FIFA 13 Update 1.5-RELOADED"" required before this 1.6 update for RELOADED release?"
