This has 56,420 files in one single zip file (no folders). It took me approx 110 hours to download. Could not open using latest Winzip on my XP Home computer. Had to transfer the file to Win 7. Some 200+ filenames are in Russian or Japanese. There are 1,700 dupes in this file. After removing duplicates from a previous fantasy torrent (sept/oct) you'll end up with 35,280 files (11GB). Lots of vintage pin-ups & Boris Vallejo. All Luis Royo stuff are duplicates. There are 2 BMP files that total 44MB!"

So sorry about the size, i will do exactly that with a new post. I used 7zip to archive the file, set to .zip setting. Don't know why you had a problem. The way i got this collection was in the search of inspiration for my writing. I used google to search for as many websites devoted to images i cam find using the best keywords. Once i got an optimal number of quality hits, i used a program called neo-downloader. you point it to a website and it will download every image connected to that site, including all connecting levels, etc. Then I pointed it at the Google page, with oh, say 100 of the best links, and let it analyze each site, and download every image that was bigger than a thumbnail. I ended up with several hundred thousand images. I viewed them in picasa, and spent a few days in spare time going through and trimming it down. The initial trim of junk was easy (photo's of fairy dolls, and such),  but once it got down to about 100,000 it was slower. Then I used Directory Opus to analyze for duplicates using identical file name and size, and also MD5 checksum. In any event, this 55,000 image collection is that larger collection trimmed down. The other smaller image postings i have are further reductions of this collection. The point is, i am writing a story, and all the images in the small collection are representative of that 'world'. Not every image WILL happen in my story, but every image COULD happen, if you know what I mean. But its still not finished. And also there must be new stuff since the initial download I did with neodownloader. That was about 4 years ago, I should go back and do it all again. "
,haggis_masher,2012-12-27T13:00Z,"After your comment I downloaded 7-Zip and tested the file (on Win XP!). It has 3 errors: 1) ""Lieutenant.gif"" - file is broken  2) ""Lifesmith.jpg"" - unsupported compression method 3) ""life_and_death.jpg"" - unsupported compression method. This may explain why Winzip & Winrar didn't work. I use the ""Check Identical Files v2.11"" program to find duplicate files - it works on any type of file from mp3's to jpg's, or from dll's to exe's. It can be a real hassle sorting thousands of pics. I often use ""Thumbs Plus"" that sorts pictures by similarity. Some of the Boris Vallejo pics had up to 8 similar pictures varying by dimensions or file size."
