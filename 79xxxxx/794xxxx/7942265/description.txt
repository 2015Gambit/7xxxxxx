From original info:

This is a compilation of Valve singleplayer-only games in the Half-Life universe, including:

    HALF-LIFE
    HALF-LIFE: BLUE SHIFT
    HALF-LIFE: OPPOSING FORCE
    HALF-LIFE 2
    HALF-LIFE 2: EPISODE ONE
    HALF-LIFE 2: EPISODE TWO
    HALF-LIFE 2: LOST COAST
    PORTAL

The Idea behind this was to create an easy to handle "all-in-one" package and at the same time keep the filesize as small as possible. To achieve this I made use of the Source-Engine's shared GCF files. More information about this can be found in the README file.

Multiplayer games were left out on purpose, mainly because they're updated too often and there are already about a million releases of them. They don't fit the idea behind this package.

+ Amazingly small installer filesize compared to common Standalone releases.
+ Uses unmodified files directly from STEAM, nothing was changed from the original content.
+ Incorporates newest updates to the SOURCE engine for all games, including achievements.
+ International (English) release, can be expanded with other languages.
+ Precracked, no need for STEAM or internet connection.
+ Custom installer/uninstaller with the option to select only the games you want to install, each game can be installed as a standalone.

Enjoy!
