POtHS - Christmas Special 2012 - The Christmas Story - Chuck Missler


POtHS comment. Excellent, Missler tells it all on what Christmas really is.


Description

Dr. Chuck Missler, a widely recognized Biblical authority, updates his classic study of Christmas for 2007. He explores the background, and myths, surrounding our favorite holiday.

   * What really happened in Bethlehem two thousand years ago?
   * Who were the "Magi?"
   * Why a virgin birth?
   * What does a Christmas Tree have to do with it?

Each year at Christmas we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.

After the New Year, we struggle to remember to add a year as we date our checks, which should remind us that the entire Western World reckons its calendar from the birth of the One who changed the world more than any other before or since.

It is disturbing to discover that much of what we have been taught about the Christmas season seems to be more tradition than truth. Santa Claus isn't the only myth or legend that has arisen out of this season.

On what "loophole" does the Messianic hope rest? Who were the Maji? And why a "virgin birth?" What does a Christmas Tree have to do with it?

This study contains 2 hours of teachings

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
