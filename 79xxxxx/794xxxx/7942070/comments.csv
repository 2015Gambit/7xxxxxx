[H],Wanderer,2012-12-20T19:16Z,"http://www.gog.com/
Its an online marketplace for PC Mac or even linux games.Their name stands for good old games that had been remade to play with modern systems but nowadays it works like steam adding new released games in their library.The best thing about them games is that they are DRM free, that means that they do not need any crack to play.
Their games are really cheap also so if anyone likes a game from them and can afford it, then he should buy it."
