Once again, Slit Jockey Records returns with a monstrous compilation of grime antics and bass meditations. After meticulously hand picking a slew of international talent to showcase Slit JockeyΓÇÖs signature sound, weΓÇÖve funneled it down to a select 15 tracks that will leave your mouth agape in awe while sweating puddles on the dance floor.

Previously available only as a white vinyl 12ΓÇ¥, finally available to the clamoring digital masses. Before you have time to catch your breath, SheffieldΓÇÖs DS1 follows with the audible airstrike of his furious ΓÇ£AddictedΓÇ¥ featuring the rapid-fire mic fury of Goon SquadΓÇÖs MC Coco.
