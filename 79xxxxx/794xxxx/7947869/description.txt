ADVANCED RESONANCE

DRIVER is an inspiring creative tool from the creator of MASSIVE featuring the rare pairing of a high-quality filter with a punishing distortion unit. The smooth filter section delivers a wide range of effects, from ultra-subtle to incredibly rich, while two modulation sources produce dramatic textural shifts.

The distortion section is capable of everything from light saturation to complete sonic destruction. Running as a stand-alone effect in any DAW, or as an effect in MASCHINE, DRIVER is perfect for any track needing fresh musical color, total annihilation, or a smooth sweep from one to the other.


JAM THE FREQUENCY

Behind DRIVERΓÇÖs intuitive user interface is a powerful set of highly tweakable features. The resonant filter offers both low pass and notch settings. Discover a world of wild new textures by modulating the filter with the envelope follower or audio modulation sections.

Fine-tune the envelope follower with the Smooth and Release controls for precise control of the filterΓÇÖs responsiveness, or trigger DRIVER via an incoming signal to give any track a shot of dynamic motion.


SONIC FURY

DRIVERΓÇÖs distortion section is a sonic beast ready to scratch, abuse, and tear your tracks to shreds. Increase resonance and distortion levels to travel from light, crunchy overtones to thick fuzzed-out bliss ΓÇô and the sound reacts dynamically in response to the audio input.

When using the AM section in Audio Mode, the Clip Cut control allows you to take your tracks deep into a dungeon of audio devastation.
