ADDiTiONAL :

1.AAX is cracked. You need cracked AAX host to use.
2.Resave does not work on some computer/convertion. If you get PANIC message: (1) Set SaveMode to "patch + samples" with "compress samples", then Convert. (2) Convert the patch which you saved on step1. (3) Done! -- It seems that this problem depends on your OS and language settings.

ΓÇó That's it! Done.
