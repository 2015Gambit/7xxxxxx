,suiteo,2012-12-20T05:13Z,Plot? IMDB Link??? Without either of these two items (not to mention the technical specs of the video itself) it's a complete waste of time.  If you can't be bothered to be informative then I just can't be bothered with any of your downloads.
,flyguy1725,2012-12-20T06:30Z,Thank you.
,SpaZaA,2012-12-20T06:34Z,Look it up yourself you lazy fuck.

,phisher1631,2012-12-20T12:37Z,"WOW I usually just stay outta the fighting fussing cussing stuff here, but pseudo, or is it suedo? frodo? anyways he goes to #1, w/ a bullet mind you, on the petulent ingrate ""mommy breast fed me a lil too long"" bratty child tool of all time list. Right on pseudo!!! Pseudo whenever u hit puberty and learn a lot more bout life u got some rude awakenings lmao. Hey TvTeam could you download it for me too, burn to dvd (I prefer verbatim DVD-R plz)and hand deliver it to me?? with a pizza and six pack in hand? Im sure ur crushed knowing that lil simp wont be downloading ur gracious torrents. Hed be a funny character in a movie but its sad knowing some folks are actually that messed up. Well VERY sincere thanks from me to you Tv..........geez some peoples kids huh?"
,rsl87,2012-12-20T20:21Z,You people are retarded. Asking the uploader to put the info you need to know before you waste your bandwidth on something is not asking alot. It's part of the uploading process and if they're gonna bother putting up how many different versions of the movie then they should probably put some info as to what the friggin difference is. Makes no sense. Why even upload different ones if you don't bother to say what the difference is. I appreciate the uploaders effort but it really doesn't take alot to put the info you need to know in the description. It's just lazy and rude.
