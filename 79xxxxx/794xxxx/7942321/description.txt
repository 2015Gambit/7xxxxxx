Storyline

The US Army is under pressure from the desperate relatives of white prisoners of the Comanches to secure their rescue. A cynical and corrupt marshal, Guthrie McCabe, is persuaded by an army lieutenant to assist in the negotiations with the Comanches. However, just two captives are released; and their reintegration into white society proves highly problematic. 

Users Review

Get ready to see an unexpected side of Jimmy Stewart. He is cynical, unethical, cowardly, and ruthless. Richard Widmark gets the thankless role of his by-the-book sidekick. Willis Bouchey, John Qualen, Shirley Jones, Woody Strode, and Ken Curtis are all excellent in unforgettable supporting roles. And, Linda Cristal nearly steals the film with a dynamic performance. This is a character study of the highest order.
