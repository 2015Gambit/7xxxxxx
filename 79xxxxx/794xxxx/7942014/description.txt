The Research Center of Supernatural Phenomena is a discrete institution whose mission is to fight against the occult phenomena that occur everywhere on our planet.

The day the young Alexia arrives in CRPS, her life will be turned upside down. She's a inexperienced Exorcist but very gifted, and she has bested evil powers that are yet to become her main tool ... Surrounded by the best specialists in the occult sciences, our heroine will properly investigate like the police ... where criminals are replaced by the conventional forces of evil!

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).
Then, you can use ".cbr files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!
