,briebee72,2012-12-22T19:28Z,Perfect picture 10/ perfect sound 10..only problem IT IS CINIVA PROTECTED.. I really wish uploaders would start saying if thier uploads were ciniva protected.  it plays fine on a pc but if you try to play on other devices either the audio wont play says its not supported or after 20 mins into the movie that damn ciniva protection shit pops up and mutes you audio outputs. so unless your gonna sit hunched over your little computer monitor and watch a 1 and ahalf hour movie then i would pass on this upload.
,eNigma333,2012-12-22T21:47Z,Agree with comment above. Does not work on my PS3...
,QborT,2012-12-22T22:01Z,"People should just assume that all movies have Cinavia protection and stop using their PS3 to watch them.  

Sony isn't your friend, go buy a media player to hook up to your tv they only cost like 100 bucks."
,honkeyman,2012-12-22T23:08Z,"seriously....I bought a WD HD Live for less than 60 bucks well over 2 years ago since ps3 didn't support mkv playback at that time.  Still works like a charm (multiple usb inputs, hdmi and optical output)"
,JDT1976,2012-12-22T23:55Z,You shouldn't be complaining about something you're getting for free. Thank the kind man/woman and get a decent setup. WD tv or HTPC. Or download any multitude of conversion programs and do the work yourself so you can play it on your current setup.
,rupert3k,2012-12-23T11:20Z,"Hehe, hunched over the computer? Don't you mean lying on the couch in front of your 60"" hooked up to the HTPC you downloaded this torrent on? Or streaming it over the network or playing it straight from USB? The notion of PS3 pouters pleases me *cheering!*"
,Toker_Wolf,2012-12-24T02:20Z,stop playing movies on your ps3s and hook up your PCs to your flat screen tvs like i have. so much simpler
,KingDoyleBeaverEater,2012-12-25T02:52Z,"And after you hook your tv up to your computer (like a man) download ""Media Player Classic"" it has played every single torrent file perfectly. Sometimes you have to tinker with the aspect ratio and this is how hard it is to do. Numbers 8 and 2 are up and down. 4 and 6 for width. Real tough and this only happens with 10% of my dl. I use to do the playstation thing till my balls dropped."
,Powerslave0,2012-12-25T05:52Z,"Not all movies are Cinavia protected, so do not ASSUME it.  The asshole uploader should state it. You should assume any SONY produced movie will have it, because it WILL.  Not everyone is using it yet, it is not mandatory.

IF you can use the DTS audio over HDMI, there is no Cinavia warnings with DTS audio.  If you convert to AC3, or other, then it will if it has it.

Stop playing movies in on PS3?  Fuck you, what do you know?  It works just fine for me, but I use DTS 321.  If your hacked, there is a home brew player that will work with anything that has Cinavia. "
,oldbreadbutt,2012-12-25T09:53Z,"fantastic!
I'll either watch this on my 24"" PC monitor in my super comfortable desk chair, or throw it on my media player and run it through my projector on my wall.

I'm surprised anyone still plays this stuff through consoles. I mean, to each their own, but I can sell you my old WD tv media player for $50 and you can hook it up to whatever viewing option you want."
,oldbreadbutt,2012-12-25T10:02Z,"FYI the flagship model of Roku is being sold for $80 (down from $100) right now and has free shipping. I might finally ditch my WD players...

not to derail, just trying to help anyone who's having trouble with cinavia protection

,briebee72,2012-12-26T15:31Z,"well after all the name calling and talking about real setups and all let me tell you I dont even own a ps3 and I was the one who started complaining about the ciniva. This upoad does have ciniva as i downloaded it and i got the warning. also I have a real setup I have an aquas 7o inch 3d tv I also have a 700 dollars reciever also top of the line and a 300 dollar top of the line 3d bleray player.   and that is the problem  the Nice top of the line stuff that connects with wifi all have ciniva protection not just ps3's  so all of you can shut the hell up. the only stuff without ciniva protection built in is is cheap ass sorry media players and wal mart blu ray players.  so all of you can stop going on about when men you are with your walmart audio and video setups.  because just about  alll new equipment other then cheap walmart and tiger direct media players has  ciniva chips in them and it would be nice if uploaders would say if thier uploads have the protection so people dont waste 2 hours downloading thier  stuff.  I have an 11 thousand dollar theater set up and I will be damned if im gonna download and watch a movie through a cheap ass chinese media player. that all you ""MEN with dropped balls "" use yeah you know that real equipment.   and yes im still cheap and pirate my movies so blow me. but that mostly because the nearest movie theather is a fucking hour away and why i dropped the money on my setup."
,c00ltun3s,2012-12-28T23:30Z,"Seriously people, why not just buy an hd tv and connect your computer to your tv?

Thats what I did. I play all my movies on my computer thru VLC media player and the computer is connected to the tv with an hdmi cord. Solves the whole cinavia problem."
,el_emeno,2012-12-30T20:57Z,"$11,000 theater system? You should be able to afford a fucking movie instead of downloading shit and bitching about protection. Dumbass.Try selling your $300 BluRay player and picking up a Wal-Mart $50 model that can actually play your illegal content you pretentious bitch."
,bigboxes1,2013-01-08T22:34Z,"@ briebee72

$700 is not top of the line.  I don't know how all that cheap stuff adds up to $11k.  LOL.  Sounds like you're technically literate and are just bitching for all the wrong reasons.  If you are not running this through your PS3 then just spend more of all that $$ that you have and build a HTPC and use VLC or MPC.  I would assume your top of the line equipment has a lot of HDMI inputs for you to connect it all.  "
