Heres the latest few DLC's

the 3 song Nickelback pack and the 5 song Foo Fighters pack

I also included my self custom-made Paranoid from Megadeth, It's still a work in progress, Just wanted your opinions about how it is now.. And yes I know it's currently missing the solo, Didnt have time for it yet
