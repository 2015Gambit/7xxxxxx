Hope you can find or fix them soon, with adding Nickelback & Foo Fighters Packs :)

It's my comment for your previous pack. Please fix these issues in next.

anybody else have problems with the game crashing sometimes 2 out of 3 start ups? sometimes starts up fine first try. you know I would have bought the game if they hadn't been greedy and insisted that you had to have the cable. glad this community fixed that."
,Phil2003,2012-12-23T12:21Z,"Weird, cant find them ingame on my legit Steam version (not updated)."
,Phil2003,2012-12-23T12:21Z,Skair: Had the same problem with random crashes at the start with the Tinyiso release. Problem solved with my legit Steam version though.
,Phil2003,2012-12-24T10:25Z,"I love the edit function here... :P 
If the songs dont show up in your game, then its because they need to be repacked with your unique app-ID."
