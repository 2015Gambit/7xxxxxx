Emil Hamilton first asks Lex Luthor to publicize his machine that can capture Superman. Lex threatens to sue if blueprints aren't handed in. After Emil is forced to leave, Henry Wyatt visits him home and makes an agreement to fund him. The perfected prototype that Emil presents is hacked by cut wires from an unknown person. The magnetic force protected the man in it from bullets, but the man died from the magnetic field disappearing. Meanwhile, Superman is against a machine run by terrorists. Superman fights the machine until Emil, desperate for publicity, makes a magnetic box around Superman and the machine. Superman is pressed against the box with plasma, but the effect of not causing more damage worked. Superman breaks into the machine to find members of the Freedom League; he begs them not to give their lives to the machine. After superman takes all the credit, Emil traps them in a box loaded with weaponry Superman must pass through to get to Emil, who is holding an innocent woman hostage. The cops arrive and arrest Emil.
