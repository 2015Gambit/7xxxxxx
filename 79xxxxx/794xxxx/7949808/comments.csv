,herejasonnero,2012-12-30T17:20Z,avast scan bv malware
,punksterhd,2013-01-02T17:27Z,"Tested, it works. All antivirus engines are going to detect it has an Mad-ware or like any security threat. Be sure to stop your antivirus engine or uninstall it. 


This activator has been tested with full installation on different computers and Vmware virtual installations.

Once again, yes, every activator is an mad-ware, obviously it is going to be an illegal stuff to activate the operating system."

,demessiah,2013-01-08T06:48Z,Not work for me. I got Win 8 enterprise 6 months activation will expire 5/11/2013 and did not change perma activation. will try in new install win 8 in vm and post comment again
,demessiah,2013-01-08T08:51Z,Ok tested in VMware win 8 enterprise and it is working. perma actevated and personalazation is ok not tested yet in win pro but am sure this will work. For those who got a blue screen and do not auto restart dis able any other activation and your anti virus. if still not work make a clean install.
,demessiah,2013-01-08T11:00Z,"ok got it working also in my machine that has only 6 months activation, win 8 enterprise. 
for those who have problem with this and does not work just press control-alt-delete then
click task manager. @ task manager click file open explorer to bring back your desktop 
again in normal way. 
to make this activator work your wind0ws 8 must have the following:
1. BUILD 9200 ONLY!!! to check if it contains build 9200 open command prompt in admin 
(just to make sure) copy and paste this 
    reg QUERY ""HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersion"" /v ""BuildLab""
if the value has no 9200  then this will not work
2. check your locaname if it contains one of the following: by pasting this one in 
the command prompt
   reg QUERY ""HKEY_CURRENT_USERControl PanelInternational"" /v ""LocaleName""
ar-SA

if your local name is not included in the aove list change it to us(en-US) by changing 
the value in the registry or do it in control panel (region) click region and in format 
tab change format ot English (United States) click apply and retype 
reg QUERY ""HKEY_CURRENT_USERControl PanelInternational"" /v ""LocaleName""
should now be en-US
