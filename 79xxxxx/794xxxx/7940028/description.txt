Hi guys

I am aware that there are other versions of this film on TPB but they are from my understanding and reading all in pal format, this one however is in NTSC. It is not in very high quality as the movie is old and this is about the best that you are going to find. 

Thank for reading and please enjoy the movie, take it from me it is very good.

:)
