In the 17th century, twelve poetic books were compiled to form the masterfully written and acclaimed work ΓÇÿParadise lostΓÇÖ.

This is NOT that book.

Unlike MiltonΓÇÖs work, in ΓÇÿparadise LostΓÇÖ by Shiloh Callaghan, the original sin has already occurred; the protagonist jailed; And those whom survived the worlds apocalypse are now stranded on the remaining peace of earth which makes up their home.

Although the underline theme of this tale is stitched together with the essence of the original ΓÇÿparadise lostΓÇÖ, it greatly differs from MiltonΓÇÖs approach and style of story telling.

This is a book of fantasy, science fiction and humor.

There is no Adam, Eve, Satan or the like. there are instead Atheist, Believers, Agnostics and Deceivers (which rhymes with believers).

I make no attempts to compare myself to the great English Poet, however I do feel strongly compelled to retell the biblical tale to an audience of the 21 centuryΓÇÖs consciousness. Which is why YOU as the reader have also been given a roll to play in this Dramody. Yes, YOU are a character in the tale of ΓÇÿParadise LostΓÇÖ, the story that connects humanityΓÇÖs beginning, to its End.
