Nexus was one of the first well written comics of the new 80s independents that offered an alternative to Marvel or DC.

Back in the day, Capital Comics experimented with Nexus issue #3, adding an extra "flexi-disc". Basically, a short floppy vinyl record that was essentially a radio drama of the issue it was saddle stitched into.

I've included MP3s of both sides of that record to go with the recently ripped omnibus edition of Nexus Vol. 1. All hail the original editors.
