I stared at it for 10 or 15 minutes debating if I should buy it and kicking myself for months (ok, years) because I didn't.  I met Mike Baron at a convention once and talked to him about making a Nexus planetarium/laser show.  Sadly, my planetarium days are over, and Mike Baron probably remembers none of this.  Ok, enough of my ravings.  Thanks again."
