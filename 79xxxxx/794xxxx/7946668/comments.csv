,XtraZoom,2012-12-22T08:32Z,This is going to sound stupid but why is the setup showing 8.0.10.7 instead of 8.1.1.3?

,brianxxx,2012-12-23T19:53Z,"@xtrazoom - 
Same for me. Either wrong version and description is accurate or description inaccurate and correct version. lol TorDigger will clear it up."
,brianxxx,2012-12-23T19:57Z,"I found the release notes on website - 
The description 8.1.1.3 IS the newest version BUT the exe file is the older previous release 8.0.10.7.

Probably what happened is Nitro did not update their downloadable file and so we have the older version for now.

OK..TorDigger...you have some work to do...lol"
