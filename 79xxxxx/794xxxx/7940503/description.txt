Britsh TV series which will interest those of you who are into geneolgy.

I have already uploaded Series One of this program and episodes 1 & 2 of Series Two.

I am now uploading episodes 3 to 5 of Series Two and will add to these as they become available. 

Episode 6 is not aired untill 6th Jan.

Please note I have a very low upload speed.

So Please be patient as I will seed this for as long as it takes.

If you complete this please keep seeding for the benefit of others.

These single episodes do not appear when you enter "Find My Past" into the Pirate Bay search. Only the complete Series One appears.

However when you click on the "yohnivek" link into my upload page they appear there.

Can anyone tell me why this happens?
