,CubicIce,2012-12-23T02:31Z,"I personally have 1TB of download that my mother complains about because we never use it all. I'm going to download all of this, except FMA because I already have FMA.

By the way, are these all in Japanese with subs?"
,zomickwik,2012-12-23T02:38Z,Of course they don't have to download all of it. That's the whole reason I didn't RAR the folders. :P
,zomickwik,2012-12-23T02:39Z,And yes they are all Japanese with subs or have the option of jap audio with subs or the dubbed audio. :)
,CubicIce,2012-12-23T03:40Z,"Okay, sounds good. I'm at 0.8% of part 1 and looking forward to the rest. :D"
,CubicIce,2012-12-27T19:28Z,"I just noticed my computer is due for a re-image (restoration to factory settings). If I were to copy the parts I have already downloaded to a USB, re-imaged, then put them in the downloads folder, would they continue downloading from that point?"
,zomickwik,2012-12-30T03:35Z,"Yes, if you are using Utorrent, you can right click on the part you are downloading and go to advanced and set the download location to your new directory where the files you saved are. Then do a force recheck. It should resume afterwards. :P"
