All Music Guide - Stephen Thomas Erlewine
Music Is Better Than Words is a traditional big-band album from Seth 
MacFarlane, the wise-ass behind Family Guy. MacFarlane plays it straight 
throughout Music Is Better Than Words, hiring American Dad composer Joel 
McNeely to create approximations of Nelson Riddle, Gordon Jenkins, and Billy 
May's arrangements for Frank Sinatra's deathless, mid-century records for 
Capitol. These classic concept albums are clearly the blueprint for Music Is 
Better Than Words which was, after all, recorded at Capitol Records' 
legendary studio with MacFarlane singing into the very same microphone 
Sinatra used all those years ago, and there is a bit of a concept to this 2011 
LP, too, with the cartoonist selecting songs never recorded by any member 
of the Rat Pack -- along with a couple recent tunes like "She's Wonderful 
Too," which McNeely originally wrote for The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles 
-- for his tribute to that ring-a-ding-ding swing. MacFarlane and McNeely 
don't attempt to ape the pizzazz of Frank's Reprise years, nor do they spend 
much time with May's snazzy snap, they stick with Riddle and Jenkins, 
keeping things sentimental and lush even when the words crackle with wit.
