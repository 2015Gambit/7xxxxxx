The first album of original music from
Neil Young and Crazy Horse in almost a decade
including over 85 minutes of music

Psychedelic Pill pokes down pathways that
have been hinted at before in this teaming
but never fully explored

New textures emerge in the music
new landscapes in the lyrics

In many ways, Psychedelic Pill rounds out an
array of probing works with prominent
autobiographical threads
