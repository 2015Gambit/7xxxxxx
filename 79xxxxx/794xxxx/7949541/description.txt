If thereΓÇÖs a new age Christmas group that many people should know, that group would either be Transiberian Orchestra, or its older delinquent, Mannheim Steamroller. Mannheim Steamroller was a new age music group first founded in 1975, but wouldnΓÇÖt be well known until 1984, when they released their first holiday album, Christmas. It helped them make their holiday spirit breakthrough. While it was great, they wouldnΓÇÖt reach the apex of their career until the year 1995, when they came out with their third winter spectacular, Christmas in the Aire. This is when Mannheim Steamroller would reach its finest point in their music.
