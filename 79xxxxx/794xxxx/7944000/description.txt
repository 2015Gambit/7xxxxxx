The Physics of Superheroesapplies the reality of physics to the fantasy of comic books. James Kakalios explores the scientific plausibility of the powers and feats of the most famous superheroesΓÇöand discovers that in many cases the comic writers got their science surprisingly right. Along the way he provides an engaging and witty commentary while introducing the lay reader to both classic and cutting-edge concepts in physics, including:

ΓÇó What SupermanΓÇÖs strength can tell us about the Newtonian physics of force, mass, and acceleration
ΓÇó How IcemanΓÇÖs and StormΓÇÖs powers illustrate the principles of thermal dynamics
ΓÇó The physics behind the death of Spider-ManΓÇÖs girlfriend Gwen Stacy
ΓÇó Why physics professors gone bad are the most dangerous evil geniuses! 

"Surprisingly enough, according to Kakalios, comic books get their physics right more often than youΓÇÖd think."
ΓÇöThe Boston Globe 

"Writing with tongue firmly planted in cheek, Kakalios looks at classic comics with a physicistΓÇÖs eye. . . . Outstanding."
ΓÇöThe Orlando Sentinel 

"Kakalios, a University of Minnesota physicist and unrepentant comics nerd, offers up jovial, largely equation-free deconstructions of Ant-ManΓÇÖs shrinking ability, the centripetal acceleration of Spider-ManΓÇÖs swing, and the strength of his silk web."
ΓÇöDiscover 

"Wildly entertaining, yet scientifically accurateΓÇª Comprises a fairly solid introductory education in physics, sweetened with a history lesson in classic comic book superheroes."
ΓÇöMetro 

"Offers a droll but sincere look at what Superman and Spider-Man can teach about physics. . . . Entertaining. . . . His explanations are lucid and smooth."
