,Baleur,2012-12-21T10:58Z,"Thanks, ridiculous to having to resort to fucking pirate websites to download a game every single patch, a game you fucking paid for several months ago.

So sad to see an indie dev use DRM to abuse honest customers while pirates obviously have no issue with it, since they circumvent it anyway.

What's next, Starforce for KSP version 1.0?
Almost makes me wish i saved my money, since it didn't give me any benefit (didn't give me the game i paid for from their official servers...)"
,Akoiz,2012-12-21T11:19Z,"Yeah, the patcher can be a pain in the ass. I feel ya. 

Just, for the love of all that is great, you have an internet connection and a computer - you can afford a $20 game! "
,antiprotector,2012-12-21T23:56Z,"As far as i understand, they putting all the programing force to the game play, not to the servers, copy protection...
i have buyed the game, only cause i wana to support them.. they are puting realy alot of work. it is wery hard to do those thinks like Squad team do. I hope later they will fix and improve updates...

and i wana be shure that this game wont be like that f*cking Minecraft Mojang.... mojang have all the money, and he just puting all core code from opensource mods... he puts all the money for himself, not for game... F*ck Minecraft... minecraft is Jew game, it is not fair to use other money only for idea..... so fak Minecraft again, not for idea but for Fu*king DEVELOPERS!!! Mojang Fuuck u!! 

if someone thinks that minecraft is wery hard work and worth all the 20mill dolars of work... if that so... fu*ck u to!! "
,antiprotector,2012-12-22T00:10Z,"I hope all who have money are supporting the Squad... Cause the idea is legendary, and this game can become the Original, cause developers not sleeping in money like others...!!
We must help them to grow... 
Dont be pesimistic, cause this gameplay is wery rare and super unique...!! "
,Aztin,2012-12-22T11:31Z,"Please guys, don't hack this game, it's a very nice independant game, please !


S'il vous plait les mecs, ne crackez pas ce jeu ! Les développeurs de ce jeu sont formidables, il faut encourager les gars comme eux à créer des jeux originaux, 20 euros c'est euros, et franchement pour ce jeu qui est pour moi ""la révélation de l'année"" c'est juste cruel de le cracker. Si vous télécharger illégalement ce jeu, ne vous étonnez pas qu'il n'y ait plus de bon jeux, que tout ressemble à du COD/BF/Uncharted ... "
,WiiMaster,2012-12-24T20:56Z,Aztin: This is one of the few games that I would actually pay for but I refuse to pay for software which does not support Linux. The problems I have to go through to make it work is not something I will pay for.
,Dorfff,2012-12-26T19:12Z,"WiiMaster: you cant blame the game and download it just because you have the most useless OS ever.
seriously, cant you get a normal cracked win7?"
,Asmodinas,2013-01-02T04:32Z,"You can say all you want against Steam...but atleast it works and does the job.

This is the main reason I'm not getting KSP. I played it since I heard about it on RockPaperShotgun the first time, back when it was free.

I'm ready to buy this game and support the developers, if they would move their ass to Steam. They should alteast try to get it green-lighted."
