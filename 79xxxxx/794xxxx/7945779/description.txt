VANGUARD PARTY IS A ROCK BAND FROM DURHAM, NC.

Taking inspiration from many genres over the past few decades, they've collaborated to create a sound that is unique for this moment in music. With a combination of Rock, Blues, Jazz, and Electronica, Vanguard Party creates music that is both emotive and approachable.

Vanguard Party formed in late 2011 when Alex Jergensen (Guitars - previously of the Florida band, ComaVera) found Matt Lawless (Bass - The Tell) and Vid Maye (Drums - Phase Zero). The trio began writing and soon convinced Derek Alan Rowe (also of the Florida band, ComaVera) to move to Durham and provide vocals and piano stylings.

After spending months writing and amassing a catalog of songs, the band recently recorded their EP in Alex's home studio. They're now actively writing and performing in the greater triangle area.
