[T],blackcanary,2013-01-02T15:18Z,"There is no password.  CBR is a comic book archive file.  You can use an application such as CDisplayEx (Windows), Comic Zeal (Mac), or Evince (Linux) to view it or unRAR it using an application like 7Zip/WinRAR (Windows) or p7zip (Mac/Linux) and view the images in your favorite viewer."
