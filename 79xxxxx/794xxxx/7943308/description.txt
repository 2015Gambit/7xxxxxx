For XVID AVI with AC3 audio, in the still dark lateness of it all:
V=9
A=10
.
From Craig.Ferguson.2012.11.28, only the guest interviews
Testing two things - don't like most opening crap in late night, how about you?
Testing my new toy that lets me put the AC3 from original TS into AVI - tada!
Thanx to an anonymous benefactor who is not anonymous to me.
The video bitrate is due to AGK usage - you pick file size, it calculates bitrate.
