[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-26T00:18Z,"Been debating doing a whole ""Interview Only"" genre, but where to start and where to stop?
Letterman
Leno
Ferguson
Those other late night guys.
Colbert
Like The Daily show, so not in consideration.
I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of others.
Letterman is the only one I can watch the first half of.

But here's been my sticking point:

All someone has to do is ask ""Hey, I'd sure like to see THAT interview, please"".

So far, no takers. Did the whole Diana Krall show as she was fully half of it. Love her to pieces.

Any requests considered, even interviews of people I don't like. As usual, no promises, but ...

ANYONE ... anyone ... ______ ... echo echo echo
