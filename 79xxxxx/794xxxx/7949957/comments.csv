Movie: Very boring and melodramatic. It starts off so well too which is a shame. Once the plane ride is over it's pretty much all downhill from there, a hokey and contrived Lifetime movie about alcoholism. It was a chore to sit through despite a brilliant Oscar-caliber performance from Denzel Washington.

The only other remarkable thing about this movie is Nadine Valazquez's impossibly HOT nude scene in the first two minutes of the film. 

Her proportions are out of this world amazing, there should be a movie law where she's required to stroll nude through the opening scenes of at least 10 films a year. "
