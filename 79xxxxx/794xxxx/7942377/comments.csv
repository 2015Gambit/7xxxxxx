Now I'm not saying it's PMDG quality, but its the only 100-200 thats available out there, so I'll give this a shot.  Thanks Snakeye!"
[T],_SnakEye,2012-12-20T18:19Z,keep us posted on how it went.
,skouras555,2012-12-20T18:52Z,"i'm not here to download this as i'm a PMDG pilot
but im posted just to say thanks to SNAKE MAN to keep alive this great sim.... thanks man"
,kili555,2012-12-20T18:54Z,"Thanks.
Req: Aerosoft MyTraffic 2013"
,Metthos,2012-12-20T19:36Z,"What happend to the torrent for Frankfurt-Hahn, Bari and Toulouse?"
,BigFatAlpha,2012-12-20T21:01Z,Perhaps the torrents were removed at the uploader's request!!!
,skouras555,2012-12-20T21:12Z,"the torrents worked great
why he wanted to be removed"
,namco-nexgen,2012-12-21T00:59Z,"Anyone who prefers this... ""thing"" to the ""Aerosoft crap"" has absolutely no idea on how an Airbus behaves.

Have fun with it.

On other hand, thank you _SnakEye, as usual a great new release."
,potvinsuks,2012-12-21T02:10Z,"You know what Namco, youre right!  I take what I said about Aerosoft crap back, because it definitely is a GREAT product.  Its just that  in my opinion anything compared to PMDG, NGX in particular is tough."
,potvinsuks,2012-12-21T06:31Z,"Installed like a champ!  Did a cpl touch n go's at Cancun in partly cloudy to rainy weather so I was able to get some various lighting in the VC and to my surprise its much nicer then I thought.  Nice glaring and shadowing.  Systems wise it's obviously not that complex but for a mid level aircraft its great.  I may purchase this, just havent tried the AP yet.  Thanks Snakeye."
,aarque,2012-12-21T08:51Z,"Hello, please. You commented ""we are in telephone contact daily."" Then all his torrents and some of yours, are gone. He left entirely, you pulled Toulouse...so frikkin lucky I snatched Antarctica when I did. What happened? You could PM me or open comment, if you wanted, that is.

I have all his titles, if I had a list of the torrents he was flying, I'd likely post the exact same ones to find out if anyone tried to shut me down..."
,Mikii0804,2012-12-21T11:55Z,"Thank you again snake for sharing these aicrafts!!

It works for me.

Keep working like that you're great!"
[T],_SnakEye,2012-12-21T12:23Z,"@aarque, I sent you a PM in the Forum (assuming your forum's user name is the same as TPB account name).

for the rest of you that are wondering what happened with those torrents, it has to do with some legal issues.
that is all I can say at this point. "
,aarque,2012-12-21T14:18Z,"We are always grateful for whatever you can share. Perhaps this is only opinion, but I think any issues with sharing knowledge are only ever technical. Knowledge flows like water, it is nature's way. To try to prevent that flow is as absurd is trying to outlaw the rain."
,ek1,2012-12-21T23:56Z,You just don't stop do ya :) happy holidays Snakey!!!!
,udidwht,2012-12-22T05:38Z,"@aarque

I managed to down all the AntarcticaX and I assume I just need to place the folders into the appropriate area/s within the FSX root directory...is this correct? There was no crack folder within."
,snake4445,2012-12-22T15:43Z,"@ udidwht

That's what I did for Antarctica X, just placed everything individually in their appropriate folders since there was no installer.  All is good and it's some pretty neat scenery"
,FSXAirbus,2012-12-24T19:49Z,"Thanks _SnakEye! V0.6 is released, could you upload that too?"
,anymore2,2012-12-24T20:36Z,Upload the new update 0.6!
,game_over_,2012-12-31T02:31Z,"seriously, 0.6 is a must! Only positive reviews!"
,Mikii0804,2013-01-04T19:20Z,"Would be very nice if you could upload v0.60.

Thanks Snake"
