BlackBox - AIRBUS X'treme "Prologue" Aims to give you a taste of things to come. 

AIRBUS X'TREME!  

 
We can now offer you the Prologue version so you can see and feel what to expect from the Full AIRBUS X'TREME release later this year.

BlackBox Quality and attention to detail will be second to none, with every system modelled to the fullest possible levels. The smallest of items will be given our full attention and you wont find a switch, knob or button that doesn't do something. 
 
In the Prologue Package you will still have a very useable Airbus simulation with Highly detailled MFD Screens and ECAMS. These are all switchable and have independant dimmer controls! Some systems and functionality may be limited initially but The MCDU Will allow you to program a FlightPlan from start to finish, including climbs, Sids, Stars, Speed and Altitude Constraints as well as holding patterns Airways and Alternate Airports. You'll see your performance figures with Vspeeds and Fuel predictions.
