setupcomplete.cmd phase
dotnetfx35.exe (NetFx 3.5 SP1)
Net3.5.1 security updates:
NDP35SP1-KB958484
NDP35SP1-KB963707
NDP35SP1-KB2604111
NDP35SP1-KB2657424

NETFX 4.5 could not be installed as it requires an online MSU
hotfix, and you cannot install those during setup in Vista.

I have, however, included a folder in the ISO called Net45
Inside is the net45 redistributable and the 2 hotfixes.
I have included a script command to install all 3 without
needing any input. The net45 installer will automatically
install the missing msu file.
