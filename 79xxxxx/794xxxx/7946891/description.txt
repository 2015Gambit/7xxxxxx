"Stunt Guitarist*" Steve Vai released this solo album prior to his widely acclaimed

PASSION AND WARFARE and FIRE GARDEN albums.


I've deleted track #5 (YO YO GAKK) because it diminishes the otherwise awesome

musicianship of the album.


If you must hear (YO YO GAKK)...buy the CD...you will be sorry..... Thank me later.


YO YO GAKK features vocals by an infant.




ZAPPA was right..STEVE VAI is a "Stunt Guitarist*" with few, if any, peers.
