RELEASE NOTES

Ever had that itching desire to break out of hell and into the highest
reaches of heaven? In Party of Sin, you take control of the Seven
Deadly Sins in a coopetitive puzzle-platformer for 1-4 players on PC

Master a large, dynamic team of anti-heroes -- the Seven Deadly Sins
as you forge your destiny on a quest to troll humanity. Envy, Greed
Sloth, Pride, Wrath, Lust, Gluttony are all multi-dimensional with
special powers useful in many situations

Swap characters on the fly as you change tactics based on the
situation: ALL the Sins are useful in combat, ALL the Sins aid in
puzzle solving, and ALL the Sins have coop interactions, both Good and
Evil

Play alone or with up to 3 of your friends and combine the sin powers
in new and sinister ways. You will discover that all your powers that
work on enemies also work on other sins. Use them to help the team or
punish bad behaviour

Explore four biblical worlds as you make your way from the depths of
Hell to the vaults of Heaven, one angel at a time. Fight enemies based
in Christian mythology like demons, angels, cherubs and templars. Take
the final fight to Saint-Michael himself!
