320 kbps VBR with peaks at 444 kbps retains about 90 % of the original quality. So using 448 kbps AAC is simply a waste of file size. 384 kbps is an optimal choice though, but I try to keep my encodes under 2 GB when possible, so I've settled for 320 kbps AAC.

But I somehow agree with you and hear your criticism--I've even considered releasing it with DTS at 768 kbps. But then someone would have complained about its incompatibility with PS3 and other portable devices. 

Long story short, encoding settings are just options and we can never please everyone. :)

Oh well...time will tell I guess..."
