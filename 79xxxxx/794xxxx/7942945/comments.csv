,w55,2012-12-21T12:55Z,"dohduhdah, I'm dying to find A Day's Read (http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=2161) and the Everyday Guide to the Wines of France (http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=9176).  Any ideas?  Thanks for all your effort on posting TTC stuff."
,citizendonny,2012-12-21T17:03Z,"Hi dohduhdah . First of all, thank you for your hard work in giving us these great TTC video courses. Is it possible to repost some of the older ones? I have been trying to dl a course on the Great Masters and it is taking me 4 days. The problem is that they are old and no seeders. Any help would be appreciated."

,w55,2012-12-22T03:45Z,"Thanks doh.  I'v searched for these over and over with no luck...otherwise I am only missing 35 lectures from the entire history of TTC, so basically I have a 12 page list and only one of those is of lectures I'm missing.  I only have video for those which really require it...math, physics, astronomy, and art.  Most of those I'm missing are math related as I'm not fond of math and don't care to take up the space.  I'm unavailable till the new year, but maybe you might want to hook up and send me a terabyte external drive (I have about 700 gigs).  I've also corrected, nay perfected, all the properties for every lecture series, something that took me lots and lots of hours.  See you in the new year."
