Culture In Decline - Season 1 Episodes 1 to 3
---------------------------------------------

FROM THE CREATOR OF THE ZEITGEIST FILM SERIES COMES THE WORST REALITY SHOW OF ALL TIME: THE REAL ONE 

"Peter Joseph is asking the questions and proposing the possible solutions that we should be demanding from the elected leaders of this crazy world.
 His brilliant analysis of this ridiculous system we're operating under is one of the most important voices for change in this generation."
-Joe Rogan 

"Maybe it's while you're shopping. Maybe it's while you're watching television. Maybe it's while you're applying spray-on tanner to your fake breasts.
 We all have those moments each and every day when we feel, even if just for a second, that we're living in an illusion, that we have bought in to a paradigm that
 doesn't fit and can't sustain. "Culture in Decline" abuses your illusions and molests your thoughts in all the right ways. Peter Joseph brilliantly and cleverly
 pulls back the shower curtain to reveal a species circling the drain. Love it or hate it, I promise you'll never be quite the same after watching it." 
-Lee Camp
