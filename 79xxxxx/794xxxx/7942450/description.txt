Ok you get the just ofs here, This is a old VHS tape I dug out of box that I ordered from a magazine add back in '96... lol, I pop it in the Vhs player for shits & grins and it still played, Well after a few good laughs I decided to rip it and throw it up here. I also added a short preview clip (20mb)

I remember a friend told me that the Internet will never take off and I wasted my money ect. anyway I hope you get a few laughs out of it as well....
