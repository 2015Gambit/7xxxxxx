In case you missed it, YOUNG JUSTICE has jumped five years ahead to mirror the hit Cartoon Network animated series, Young Justice: Invasion. Today, the teamΓÇÖs adventures continue in YOUNG JUSTICE #23.

Kylstar has imprisoned Superboy and four of the most powerful members of the Justice League on the moon! After he refuses to let them go, our heroes have no choice but to fight Kylestar for their freedom. Will they be strong enough to defeat him? Meanwhile, Martian Manhunter, The Flash and The Atom travel to Brainiac's spaceship to convince him to release Metropolis from his force field. Can they change his mind or are the city and the heroes trapped within it doomed?

YOUNG JUSTICE #23, in stores today, is written by Greg Weisman and illustrated by Christopher Jones.
