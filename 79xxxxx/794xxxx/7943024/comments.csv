,legoman12345,2012-12-21T04:28Z,it gets stuck on updating...
,Seedyougreedyfucks,2012-12-21T04:56Z,"I'm getting ""Server can't be found"" I click refresh, and I get ""Scanning for land worlds"" and it scans and scans and scans. Won't get passed scanning for land worlds."
[T],TeamExtreme,2012-12-21T05:50Z,"@batman legoman
We found and fixed that issue, just reinstall the game and it should work just fine now."
,Tushar007,2012-12-21T10:21Z,"@TeamExtreme
Thanks for this quick release. Singleplayer works perfectly but I am not able to join your sever because it says your sever is out of date.(v1.4.5).
So please update your server."
,MCMan223,2012-12-21T11:08Z,"@Seedyougreedyfucks

First it's LAN(local area network) worlds,not land worlds,then of course it would not be found,there's no Local servers near you.And to join one server enter the IP and Direct Connect you stupid bum"
[T],TeamExtreme,2012-12-21T22:10Z,"@Tushar007

In time my friend. Servers don't just update right away, we need to wait for the new server software to come out and then update all our components.

Once this is done, our server will be updated :)"
,mwpeck,2012-12-22T01:30Z,Anyone else missing the quit button on the main menu? Makes it annoying to close out the game from full screen mode.
[T],TeamExtreme,2012-12-22T02:40Z,"@mwpeck

Minecraft was not originally made to run in full screen mode, it was introduced update. 

Just Press F11 to leave full screen and click close or just Alt+F4."
,Richterx8,2012-12-22T06:10Z,"I get an error that says~ Could not find main class: com.teamextreme.fyre.UpdaterFrame.

Whats wrong with it and how do I fix it?"
,ArchPhaeton,2012-12-22T06:53Z,"Awesome work, BUT YOUR SPLASH LOGO IS HORRIBLE! 
I'll stay away from using this, cant bear that cheap skateboard art -.-"
[T],TeamExtreme,2012-12-22T08:17Z,"@Richterx8

As the description says, install or update your java."
[T],TeamExtreme,2012-12-22T08:18Z,"@ArchPhaeton

You are the first person I have every met who didn't like our Icon.

Each to there own."
,wigglyy,2012-12-22T08:26Z,"Thanks, it works perfectly. Will seed for a few hours."
,ArchPhaeton,2012-12-22T09:00Z,"@TeamExtreme
Sorry if I was mean, but I couldn't keep it anymore...

I know you guys must think it's awesome and stuff, but honestly (not to boast, but I've had some hardcore art teachers) I would tell you it's not, you don't need to be offensive/gross/gore etc etc to look strong and great!

I really liked your stuff but had to look for another solution, couldn't bear it... and as you said, to each their own. Good luck, and keep going :)"
,Richterx8,2012-12-22T19:00Z,"@TeamExtreme, .///. my bad"
,batman79,2012-12-23T02:20Z,"@TeamExtreme

Thanks man, works great now. Been playing the Uncharted Territory II map. :D"
,batman79,2012-12-23T02:22Z,"@ArchPhaeton

Seriously you're staying 'away from this' because of the splash screen art? How petty can you get?"
,DownDown12,2012-12-23T03:17Z,"@TeamExtreme 
I keep on getting a ""Bad Login"" error, could you help me out with that?"
[T],TeamExtreme,2012-12-23T03:29Z,"@DownDown12

It means the server you are connecting to do not allow cracked uses."
,X-III,2012-12-23T03:57Z,"Nothing against you TeamExtream but I hate how you add stuff.
Like in one version in the main menu instead of it saying Minecraft it said TeamExtream, or in this one How TeamExtream pops up and loads something before the launcher comes up."
[T],TeamExtreme,2012-12-23T04:30Z,"@X-III

The TeamExtreme at the start is just a loading screen for the launcher, The other thing I think you're talking about is the updater...?

Unlike other launchers we keep ours up to date and We don't need to wait for new torrents to fix issues that people have.

Once we find a bug or if we find a way to make the launcher quicker and more efficient, we release a patch and your clients auto update next time you start the launcher, this takes about 2-5 sec. If this is the first time running our launcher you will see the update screen because we always find a bug or improvement. The auto update only takes about 2-5 sec because the update is less the 1mb.

instead of complaining about that 2sec update that appears once in a full moon, maybe you should thank us for keeping this updated and bug free. I notice you didn't complain about the memory allocation feature..."
,DanielTurtleface,2012-12-23T10:42Z,Thanks for the new update! Will seed
,QmarcesQ,2012-12-23T21:29Z,The destination folder option is greyed out for me when i download this regardless of what computer i use. it wont let me change it and it defaults to a .minecraft folder meaning it will error out and not install.
,darkpala,2012-12-23T21:44Z,"Well i have one problem i want to host a minecraft server but no one of the ""hosting"" services allow cracked servers ;v what can i do

(without buying minecraft for me and my friends)"
,darkpala,2012-12-23T21:46Z,Did... you just deleted my question?
[T],TeamExtreme,2012-12-23T22:28Z,"@darkpala

Sometimes once you refresh the page your comment disappears for a short time.

Now with your question: If you want to get professional hosting that allows cracked servers at a low price, I would recommend MPServ.

Link: http://clients.mpserv.net/aff.php?aff=209

Just remember to change Online mode to false, in the server properties file. This will disable Mojangs authentication system and let anyone one join the server."
,darkpala,2012-12-23T23:18Z,"Thank you for the response, sorry for being too hasty about the comment :P, and a very very good work keep going and thank you"
,I-Like-Onions,2012-12-24T03:02Z,"I like the torrent but, the fingering skeleton is kind of offensive to me and isn't Minecraft for all age groups?

Can you remove the skeleton guys, that would be nice?"
[T],TeamExtreme,2012-12-24T03:57Z,"@I-Like-Onions

I have already planned to have the splash changed to a Minecraft logo

There Will also be an option screen added to turn it off. The next patch will also change the UI a little."
,I-Like-Onions,2012-12-24T05:13Z,"Thank you, Team Extreme."
,okbyethen,2012-12-25T02:26Z,I agree.  Thanks for the work but I cannot use it as my children do not need to see this offensive stuff.
,Asulen,2012-12-26T06:20Z,"Game downloaded quickly, seemed to work fine. 

Swapped to other torrent, the image flashing on my screen; distasteful."
,nickinator2011,2012-12-26T07:38Z,Where are is the server properties?
,I-Like-Onions,2012-12-26T08:59Z,"Anyone know of a server or, servers, with Terra Firma Craft, mod? I wanna play that mod, with others. Minecraft, alone, is boring."
,gomezjr432,2012-12-27T06:05Z,"@ team extreme
the link u provided in the description is the java update for 64bit system. do you have a link for the java update fot 32 bit systems"
,derp72,2012-12-27T07:13Z,"when running the installer, when you choose the folder to install in, it won't let me choose where to install. Any help?"
,OmarKH,2012-12-28T20:07Z,"How can I host a Minecraft server just for me and my friends?
I want to host it locally (on my PC) and without paying anything, hopefully my PC and internet connection can handle it"
[T],TeamExtreme,2012-12-29T09:40Z,"@gomezjr432 32bit windows will run 64bit java just fine, 32bit java is limited to 1gb of ram.

@derp72 This is how the game was programmed to run...

@OmarKH YouTube and Google."
,Malakore,2012-12-29T20:40Z,"Thank you, TeamExtreme. This time not a single problem for me ;)"
,Malakore,2012-12-29T20:50Z,"For derp72 and others having trouble changing install location -  it is normal and only supported way. However, I tested following startup.bat file on WinXP, WinVista and Win7 and it was working flawlessly, so you may wanna give it a try. Here is example from my RamDisk setup:

@echo off
Vanilla 1.4.6
set APPDATA=M:Minecraft
start """" ""M:Minecraft.minecraftminecraft launcherMinecraft Launcher.exe""

Put this into the .txt file, change paths to your configuration, rename it to .bat (need to have known extensions set to show) and then use it to run Minecraft."
,Mig8400,2012-12-30T02:55Z,"I was having the com.teamextreme.fyre.UpdaterFrame. error, I just updated java, uninstalled older versions of it, re-installed minecraft 1.4.6 and it worked!"
,Mig8400,2012-12-30T08:24Z,"@TeamExtreme Okay so I bought an MPServ server and it's online and everything. But when I try to connect on multiplayer it says polling then ""Can't reach server"" what the heck should I do??"
,Mig8400,2012-12-30T09:58Z,"Nvm, I got it. thanks for the torrent"
,SirReaper,2012-12-30T17:19Z,"Does it have mobs on single player? 
Multiplayer online doesnt right?"
,jameslane,2012-12-31T02:06Z,Can I use This play on tunngle ? If can Teach Me how ?cause i want play Lan Please Anyone Answer me ASAP ! Thank~
,ArtepSkywork,2013-01-01T23:01Z,"Really? Offended by a middle finger? You don't want your child to see this? Buy them the actual game and be responsible. I'm sorry but that's just bad parenting if you ask me. Why am I pirating the game? Because it don't run well on my computer and I already own it on Xbox, If a friend want's to hop on in the PC world then I'll join him for awhile.

Getting offended over petty stuff is ignorant. "
,modestos739,2013-01-04T13:06Z,The installation was really fast!!!I didn't meet any problems at all but it is a bit laggy...Can you fix it?
