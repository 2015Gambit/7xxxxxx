Jessica Drew is finally in control of her own life. She's managed to escape both the High Evolutionary and Hydra and now finds herself attempting to build a life in London, England. The only problem isΓÇªshe has no idea how to do so. Systematically turned down from every job she applies for and despised for reasons unknown by just about everyone she meets, Jessica Drew quickly begins to wonder if sheΓÇÖs really better off on her own. Being half-spider and raised away from society, she doesnΓÇÖt fit in with regular people. Her nightlife as Spider-Woman is just as problem-filled. S.H.I.E.L.D agent Jerry Hunt has taken a special interest in Spider-WomanΓÇöhe's convinced that he knows her, but she is quite certain theyΓÇÖve never met. Still, she feels inexplicably drawn to agent Hunt and proceeds to save his life during a gunfight. She hopes this act of kindness will deter Hunt from pursuing her further, but Jerry has other ideas. HeΓÇÖs more determined than ever to track her downΓÇªthough heΓÇÖs not sure if itΓÇÖs to tell her she's under arrest or that he loves her.
