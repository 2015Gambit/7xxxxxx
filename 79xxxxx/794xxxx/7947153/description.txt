FS2Crew: Leonardo Maddog Edition

Description from fs2crew.com :

           Voice controlled Multi-Crew Coordination for your "Dog"!!!

           The Leonardo Maddog 2008 is without a doubt the most advanced MD-80
           simulation available for FSX/FS9; indeed, from a systems modeling 
           perspective, it ranks right up there with the PMDG and LDS aircraft.
           
           But now's your chance to take your Maddog to a higher, more realistic 
           level by adding FS2Crew's custom airline crew expansion pack to the 
           simulation.

           Designed in close consultation with a current, real-world MD-80 First 
           Officer, this new edition of FS2Crew is one of FS2Crew's best - and most 
           realistic!

           Note: This version of FS2Crew supports both the FS9 and FSX versions of 
           the Leonardo Maddog 2008.
