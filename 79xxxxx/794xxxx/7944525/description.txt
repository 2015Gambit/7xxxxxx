The Game is the scene of the crime

Shadow of the Game is a multiple award-winning roleplaying title with a
strong focus on interactive storytelling. One of the strongest guilds in
a fictive MMORPG is embarking on the last expansion's final raid to
become the highest ranking guild in game. The event is so tremendous
that even the MMO's lead developers at Gizzard are watching the raid on
live-stream. Things start to slowly fall apart when the guild's outcast
"Cookie" makes his return sporting an illegal race and bringing
power-grinded companions. Friendships are put to the test, internships
are on the line, and the gamers are forced to take action in the "real
world"
