,Paull2,2012-12-23T01:02Z,"I think he just means he's going to test this upload since it's from an untrusted source.  It's likely okay though, since file size is correct and they've uploaded dozens of other releases."
,SoulForEver,2012-12-23T09:58Z,"I test it and I played it and i finish this game, but really this is fucking game
because there is no fighting nothing to do , only speak and watch the video. it's looks like anime.
in the end , they says "" you are the game it self and you watch the video , and there unclear story, Missunderstand. ""
I think they should use Gammercial English.
anyway , from my Rate , it's horrible to play and very bad :(
PS : I love Hide-Seek games , I love adventure game. so I know how the game should be done ;)

Thanks all ;)

Played the demo on Desura, fun to watch. 
I say watch because there is not much gameplay … this game is more like an interactive story than a game, but quite entertaining. “Downloading”"
,BitchMaster99,2012-12-23T15:30Z,"Hmm. I’m having some issues installing the game. It seems that the setup is corrupt, the progress stops when trying to extract some mp3 files. Any suggestions?"
,Dunge,2013-01-06T01:27Z,Just finished the game (took around 6-7h) and I can say this is the most fucked up story I ever tried to follow. You have to be very stoned to appreciate any of it because most make no sense at all.
,BitchMaster99,2013-01-08T18:23Z,"Had a hard time with the installment, and it definitely got weirder and weirder. Not a game for everyone. The story is way more complicated than traditional games, but quite entertaining!"
