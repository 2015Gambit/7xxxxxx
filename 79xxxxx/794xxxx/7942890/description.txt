Actor and writer Mark Gatiss embarks on a chilling voyage through European 
horror cinema. From the silent nightmares of German Expressionism in the wake 
of World War I to lesbian vampires in 1970s Belgium, from the black-gloved 
killers of Italy's bloody Giallo thrillers to the ghosts of the Spanish Civil 
War, Mark reveals how Europe's turbulent 20th century forged its ground-
breaking horror tradition. On a journey that spans the continent from Ostend to 
Slovakia, Mark explores classic filming locations and talks to the genre's 
leading talents, including directors Dario Argento and Guillermo del Toro.
