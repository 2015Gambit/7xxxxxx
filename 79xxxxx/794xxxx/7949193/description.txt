This is a great little audiobook/ebook combo for people with no attention span and ANYONE that wants more motivation. Whether you want to study harder, lose weight or quit smoking.

All of this was created by a very talented hypnotherapist who uses psychology and hypnosis to help motivate you.

The book is written in point form and contains only ideas that you can start using the second you read it. No fluff talk.

Can you be hypnotized? There are a few mp3's with hypnosis recordings geared toward teaching you self hypnosis, with a few more which talk more about the ideas in the book.
