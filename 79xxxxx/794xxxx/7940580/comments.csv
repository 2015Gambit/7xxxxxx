btw, i dont know why you all upload in mobi/epub format. pdf is much more flexible and universal."
,maru19961996,2013-01-06T00:49Z,"Because mobi/epub is more usefull to read on your mobile. PDF is great only if you have a big screen because you cannot make the front larger, you can only make the whole pdf page larger."
