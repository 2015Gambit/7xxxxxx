[MARATHI] Bhagya Rekha | 1948 | Pu.La.Deshpande Debut Film | Phantom

Pu. La. Deshpande played the male lead in the movie 'Bhagyarekha'. Not many know that legendary Marathi writer and playwright P L Deshpande did playback for the first time in Bhagyarekha. Set in pre-Independent India, the film also marked Deshpande's acting debut. It dealt with subjects such as poverty in songs like 'Paahije potaala Bakhri' (Need bread for the stomach) turning into an anthem for the downtrodden. Directed by Shantaram Aathavle, 'Bhagyarekha' was also considered ahead of its time, since it brought into focus issues such as pre-marital sex.

The movie is the story of Manik, a young Ganadhian freedom fighter who has a child out of wedlock. Condemned by all the members of her family expect her mother, she battles on steadfastly, refusing to reveal the name of her lover who has gone underground during the freedom struggle. The film was far ahead of its times, harking back to an era when Marathi cinema tackled unconventional subjects quite frequently.
