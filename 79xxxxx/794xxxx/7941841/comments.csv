[V],HighCode,2012-12-20T17:45Z,"Very disappointing sound.
""This Blu-ray release of Midnight Express features both lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and lossy Dolby Digital mono soundtracks. The Lossless track improves upon the mono offering by delivering increased clarity and resolution, but the additional channels don't necessarily mean an abundance of extra sonic activity. The lossless track remains centered straight up the middle with little information sent to the adjoining speakers. Ambient sound effects, for example the hustle and bustle of the Turkish airport at the beginning of the film, features all of the environmental effects up front and playing mostly through the center speaker. Music often plays with little in the way of volume at reference levels, a chase scene in chapter 3 playing as a rather cut-and-dry experience that delivers the sound but doesn't do all that much with it. Dialogue is reproduced efficiently throughout. Like the picture quality, Midnight Express' lossless soundtrack impresses in context. It doesn't create a phony atmosphere or otherwise add to the original track. It's mostly a clearer, more precise rendition of the mono track, just the way it should be. "" - blu-ray.com

 It certainly is one of the poorest 5.1 sound I've ever experienced in a HD movie."
