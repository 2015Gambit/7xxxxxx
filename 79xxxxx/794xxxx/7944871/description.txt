Poster Printer 3.01.27

RonyaSoft Poster Printer is a software program for large format poster and banner printing, big size sign and wall photo mural making.

No special poster size plotters are required to make a poster; a standard home or office printer will suit perfectly. Pictures, digital photos, Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, CAD drawings and electric schemes are easily converted into huge multipage posters and personalised photo gifts. A poster can be printed from a TWAIN-scanner or camera, too.

With proper knowledge and skills, you might use professional graphic design software for cost-efficient custom poster printing. But why all the unpleasant routine and large format challenges when youâ™ve got Poster Printer, a convenient, easy-to-use poster maker software program? You select an image, and the poster creator enlarges it automatically, slices and dices it into a proper number of pages and prints them. To create a large format poster, you will also need some glue (or tape), scissors and a bit of skill.

Print a great poster yourself! It could be your favourite family picture or digital photo, your artwork or painting, a colour banner or advertisement, a large table or sheet, a giant map or graphics, and what not. Express yourself and design your own photo poster or banner for your living room for everyone to see. Just use your imagination and prepare for poster creation.
