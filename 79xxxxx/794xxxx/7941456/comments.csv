,cldrain,2012-12-26T23:03Z,"News seems to indicate that this version of Angry Birds has not been released on Playbook yet.  So, whatever this is, it's a fake!!!

Do not waste your time!!!!"
,walk_the_plank,2012-12-28T16:29Z,any one get this to work?  please reply!
,SSJASON,2013-01-01T15:30Z,@cldrain you sir are an idiot. this is ported over from the android apk
,cldrain,2013-01-08T01:17Z,"okay genius, can you please explain:

1) why it is always stuck on 99.7%??  Just tried again.
2) how come this is not available anywhere else on the Internet?
3) why latest news seems to indicate that there is NO ported version for this Angry Birds for PB.

Like I said before, this is a waste of time and most likely a fake.    If it's real, how come no one thanked you yet??  I guess no one can get pass 99.7% download.
