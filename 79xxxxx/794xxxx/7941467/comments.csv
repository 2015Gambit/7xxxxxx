Nothing new in four days and SnakEye's extended doesn't show up unless I search his name. Apologies for the poor spelling, but Rotro, or however you spell his name, has completely disappeared. Can somebody please comment his name properly spelled so I can at least keep track of his uploads until the search function returns?"
,aarque,2012-12-20T11:09Z,found it in the Toulouse torrent readme: rotro10 so thanks anyway!
,snake4445,2012-12-20T15:08Z,"Thanks a bunch aarque.  I'm not sure what happened with rotro10 as he requested all his torrents be deleted from here and his account deleted from suprbay, but I hope all is well in his world"
,aarque,2012-12-20T15:43Z,"I see. I suppose we could hope he was threatened with financial remuneration rather than financial ruination. Perhaps SnakEye or somebody could contact my SuprBay profile and fill me in..

His nickname was rotro10"
,Golem26,2012-12-21T02:30Z,"Sorry, you have already found one. Could have been better to read."
,hitchup,2012-12-21T07:46Z,"@ aarque

,Hatiloou,2012-12-21T12:32Z,"We all stuck at 0.0%...
Any problems with your internet connection, aarque? I don't hope so."
,aarque,2012-12-21T16:29Z,"The connection is fine, the client was open all night. If it continues to not seed, tell me and I will make a new torrent."
,poutoufjouhe,2012-12-21T17:39Z,Thanks aarque ! but no seed !!!
,Hatiloou,2012-12-21T18:42Z,"@aarque
Nope, still no seeders... all leechers I have are at 0.0% and it seems like nothing is happening...
I don't use proxies so far, so everything should be okay..."
,aarque,2012-12-22T01:19Z,"Ok, that should take care of it. Swapped a few things around, did a ""force re-check"" and my upload rate jumped to what I would expect, so let me know if it is still slow."
,captray,2012-12-22T02:13Z,"@hitchup 
Where did you find the B55???? SHARE!"
,udidwht,2012-12-22T05:51Z,"Is this the expansion pack or the following?:

,Hatiloou,2012-12-22T07:51Z,"OK works fine now, I'm downloading this thing ;)
Thanks aarque!"
