this looks interesting. can we choose the language right before installation starts? or do we have to switch over after installation? can you tell the ""installed size"" of the english 64-bit version?

thanks."
,ke3ch,2012-12-22T07:54Z,can this be used with other languages that use unicode such as thai and chinese? 
,soulking77,2012-12-22T15:32Z,"There Are 2 Languages Before Installation 1-->English 2-->Russian, Choose Whatever You Want.
And 64-bit ""installed size"" Is 3.gb

ke3ch: You Can Select The Keyboard Or Input Method To Thai Or Chinese Before Installation.  "

But not supported language packages :(
I wanted to install Czech language pack, but could not."
,mareonCz,2012-12-22T22:51Z,Please... add czech language pack.
,banwat,2012-12-24T11:58Z,"Thank you very much! Works OK but not perfect.
Unable to unintall Russing language.
Unable to install additional language. Tried with both existing language file and through update.
You disabled Restore no problem but you also deleted VSS (Windows Shadow Copy). Not so good."

Use Acronis True Image for Backup and no problem with Restore point (Windows Shadow Copy).But unable to unintall Russing language pack that is a problem but not so big....
@soulking77

If you really like to limit the size of installation adding 250mb of Acronis True Image is kind of counter productive. Have been using Macrium which is a tenth of the Acronis size. Macrium works with errors but if VSS could be reinstalled so much better."

Man not adding 250mb of Acronis True Image  if you use Acronis True Image Boot Cd and the problem is resolved.Say if the Acronis True Image boot cd it work or not; i'm not test
