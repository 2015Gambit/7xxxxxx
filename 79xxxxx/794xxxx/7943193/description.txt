Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, December 20 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex continues his coverage of the push to harm the Second Amendment following the Sandy Hook massacre. He also talks about the orchestrated effort by the establishment media to propagandize the American public into believing firearms are a grave and serious national security threat. 

On today's show, Alex talks with former federal prosecutor and a former member of the United States House of Representatives for Georgia's 7th congressional district, Bob Barr. He was the Libertarian Party nominee for president in the 2008 election. Mr. Barr sits on the NRA board and will talk with Alex about the effort to disarm the American people.
