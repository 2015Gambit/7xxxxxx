An action plan regarding Occupy Atlanta from the Atlanta Police Department is now available. On Monday, November 17th, 2011 a team of around 10 defense attorneys went to trial with 28 defendants who were arrested in the early morning of October 26th, 2012 for (allegedly) being in Troy Davis (Woodruff) Park after park closing hours.

As part of the preparation for the trials of Occupy Atlanta members who were arrested while engaging in this peaceful protest, the defense team requested relevant documents.  This involved a pre-trial process where the prosecution turned over documents that can be used at trial, as well as a subpoena to the Atlanta Police Department for police materials that could be used at trial.

During the course of the trial, Deputy Chief Moss testified about a document called the "Occupy Atlanta Plan of Action".  This document had not been turned over to the defense prior to the start of trial.  The prosecutor claimed that he turned over all the materials that he had received and that it was the police who failed to turn over this document.  The judge ordered the police to produce this document to determine if it fell under the purview of the previous subpoena to the police and should have been included.  She determined that the document was relevant to the case and that the police had acted improperly by not turning over the document.  

This document has information that might be relevant to activists and others in Atlanta regarding police procedures.  It can now be shared widely to anyone in Atlanta and other areas who might be interested in its contents.
