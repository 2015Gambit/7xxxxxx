Set on the eve of the election of Chile’s first female president, Muñeca gives us a brief window into the friendship between Pedro (portrayed brilliantly by Benjamín Vicuña), a painfully introverted gay man, and his best friend Manuel (Marcial Tagle), a hedonistic, buffoonish straight man who lives with Pedro in Pedro’s mother’s house.
In a classic Guess-Who’s-Coming-To-Dinner turn to the plot, Manuel sets up Pedro on a blind dinner date. When Pedro’s date arrives in the form of a mature woman in search of a sperm donor, Manuel and Pedro’s relationship begins to unravel. The addition of one of Manuel’s former college students to the dinner party doesn’t help matters either.
