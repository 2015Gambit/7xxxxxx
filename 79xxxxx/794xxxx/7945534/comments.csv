Source is 1080p RUS BluRay-HDCLUB 
http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Cloud-Atlas-Blu-ray/60558/
And DTS is homemade.
And I have added HQ-Hive CM-8's audio just in case.

Enjoy a great movie, and in our book, #1 on Oscar's prises."""
,MisterE2108,2012-12-21T19:51Z,Possible to get this in the 4g range? Would be greatly appreciated. 
,victor.brazil.qwerty,2012-12-21T20:07Z,"@protoyu can you explain better what is ""Own studio stream"" was you original audio source 2.0 or 5.1? By the way, thanks a lot"
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-21T22:02Z,"WOW... an 18 (eighteen) GIGAbyte MKV file. 

I didn't think such a thing was possible.

That's like a horse-sized piece of feces or something.

,RaW-D-Coy,2012-12-21T23:48Z,i saw a 32gb just a second ago for the new tim burton movie
,Joe33345,2012-12-22T01:32Z,You guys do realize @michaelrwatson that there are plenty of Blu-Ray movies that are either straight rips or encodes of the actual 50gb blu-ray disk that are 30gb or even bigger? They're the perfect quality blu-ray for those who don't want those 8 - 10gb files ;-)

,greasyHampster,2012-12-22T22:17Z,"Man you guys all think you know better than the next guy and take this shit WAY to serious. EVERY fucking torrent mother fuckers, bitch, troll, pretend to know something about quality, even pretend to know something about life that the other guy doesn't. THIS  A FUCKING TORRENT SIGHT FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW BETTER THAN TO SEND THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY TO EVEN BIGGER PIECES OF SHIT USUALLY IN HOLLYWOOD.  Please just give an A/V and FUCK OFF cause NO-ONE and I mean NO-ONE is EVER gonna give a shit about your hate filled point of view on something that matters about as much as how little you get laid. Cause we know you don't! I also bet you check back in on the comments just to see if what you said had any affect or to defend your pathetic selves. Because-Hey! What else does your worthless life have to offer?- 
   Now i know none of you R-Tards give a fuck about what I'm telling you cause I cant belive I've even taken this time out. But it feels good to finally vent out my hatred for all you petty nobodies. 
   So have fun responding with long hate filled speeches that I(or any other person of average or higher intelligence) will only skim through to get to THE FUCKING A/V RATINGS. That should have been all you had to say in the first place.

,Murderpolice,2012-12-22T23:36Z,Anyone know where I can find eng subs? Subscene doesn't have any up yet. 
,jeremias666,2012-12-23T12:35Z,great  movie : )
[V],GoodFilms,2012-12-23T13:24Z,Subtitles for foreign bits (mainly captions): http://subscene.com/subtitles/cloud-atlas/english/666831
,Fuzi0719,2012-12-23T13:57Z,Does this have the Russian audio on the rear surround channels like the DD5.1 version?
,sgcb,2012-12-24T06:27Z,"Listened to this on headphones and it seemed like the russian audio was present in a few scenes. It's decent and if you can put up with it along with some russian text and no (full) subtitles, this can be an early x-mas present. However if you want a quality rip, you should probably wait until closer to blu-ray release (february 5)"
,FeLeTr0n,2012-12-25T00:59Z,"Skipped to a few scenes and it all seems great. Will watch tonight and get back if any changes.

Thank You Good Copy"
,dududus,2012-12-26T22:12Z,"i am having trouble playing this with the latest VLC

anyone else?"
,backups93,2012-12-27T04:19Z,tried to play on VLC it stopped after 2 seconds and I've also downloaded the HDclub version which is supposed to be true bluray and the first 7 seconds scene goes with no problem then some weird russian message with red background shows up. Any clue on how to fix either one of them?
,schnitzelburger,2012-12-29T04:02Z,What's the audio like?
,FeLeTr0n,2012-12-30T01:29Z,A10 / V10. Watched the whole movie just fine. Only thing was the text that shows throughout the movie is Russian. But I think we already knew that. I also think it doesnt matter. Just tells you what year i think.
,BlueMule,2012-12-30T21:16Z,"18GB jesus haha
I'm still trying to find a version thats not annoying too watch"
,jamiedr,2013-01-02T11:47Z,Bad audio
