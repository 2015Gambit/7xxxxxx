Native Instruments Reflektor v1.2.0








REFLEKTOR represents the pinnacle of digital signal processing - a definitive convolution reverb based on the groundbreaking Zero Latency Convolution technology developed by Native Instruments. This high-performance effect provides reverb ranging from super-realistic physical rooms to fully virtual acoustics, offering in-depth modeling parameters for creating unique spaces. It can perfectly emulate the sound of high-end, expensive digital reverb units and includes specially designed content for creative sound design. Combined with some highly usable and musical innovations such as the Sync and Reverse feature, this is the ultimate reverb for every production need, from classic to creative.


MUSICAL REFLEKTION

A highly flexible musical tool, REFLEKTOR adds a twist for producers with a sense for advanced techniques, producing anything from aspirated reverbs to far-out effects. The reverse mode offers an adjustable position for leaving early reflections in place. Combined with the dead-easy sync feature, which allows for syncing the pre-delay and decay both of original and reversed IRs. This unique feature is great for creating superb pumping beats or rhythmic effects. In addition, REFLEKTOR gives you full control over depth and pan, as well as stereo width, making this reverb a cut above the competition.


FOLLOW YOUR IMPULSE
