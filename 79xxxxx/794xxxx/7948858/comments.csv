,crwildman,2012-12-23T20:59Z,@tajammata Why even bother to comment?  If you want a real virus scanner use KasperSky. Everything else will give false positives.  You need to learn about tools like this.  When you download them they are going to give you a false positive.  Trend is the worste one.  It will say everything is a virus.   If you think this is a virus then this program isn't for you cuz your a noober and don't know how to read or research what the virus is telling you.  The only virus scanner that matters is Kaspersky results.  It is the best.  This is an advanced tool.  Not noober friendly at all.  
,AppRipper,2013-01-06T02:31Z,Thanks man! I hate when people post things about viruses. It obviously isn't a virus when it has multiple dedicated seeders. Not to mention most anti-virus scans are total bullshit when it comes to keygens. Appreciate the upload man!
