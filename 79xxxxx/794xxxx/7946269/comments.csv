And as for the fun, what is the thrill of sinning if you don't believe in sin? It's these little cognitive contradictions that spice up an activity."

Actually you're the one who is wrong. While it is correct that the word holiday originally referred to days which were considered holy, and more so explicitly religious in nature, in modern parlance it means any special day of rest or relaxation, as opposed to normal days away from work or school. Since this book is written in the 21st century and the society in which the author is living has altered the original meaning of the word, there is no contradiction in being an atheist and having a holiday, and thus the premise of the title is not wrong."
