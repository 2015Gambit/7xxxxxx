Walter White - chemistry teacher in high school. His life certainly had no luck, as there is never enough money, his son - invalid, the wife of Walter holds him under the heel, the final blow - he became ill with cancer. What would do an ordinary person in this situation? Perhaps humility waiting to death, but not like that, Walter - he decides to illegally manufacture synthetic drugs, and provide the family with money, while he was still alive. For sales of goods, he attracts an assistant of his former student - small drug dealer Jesse Pinkman. Dreaming to become rich and powerful drug traffickers, Jesse eagerly takes on the case ...
