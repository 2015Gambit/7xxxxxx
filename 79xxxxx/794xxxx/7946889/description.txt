ThunderCats (2011) - Season 1 - Complete (WEB-DL - 1080p)
---------------------------------------------------------

ThunderCats, ho! ThunderCats presents the grand origin story of Prince Lion-O's
ascension to the throne- and those who would thwart his destiny at any cost -
and takes on epic dimensions in this sharp new telling of the 1980s classic.
This all-new animated series combines swords and science, as the forces of
good and evil battle each other in the quest for the fabled Stones of Power,
and Lion-O and his champions learn valuable lessons of loyalty, honor and
mortality in each episode. This reimagining marks a creative collaboration
between Warner Bros. Animation and Studio 4o C., one of the most vibrant animation
studios in Japan, giving the characters a new cutting-edge look while remaining
true to the compelling storylines and mythology of the series. Roaring to life
through the Japanese animated artistry of anime, the characters of Lion-O,
Mumm-Ra, Panthro, Cheetara and others spring off the screen with realistic
catlike characteristics inconceivable in previous incarnations.

Produced by Warner Bros. Animation and Studio 4o C.
