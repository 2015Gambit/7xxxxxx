,pythonista99,2012-12-20T15:40Z,A few samples would've been nice.  Would hate to use 1/20 of my entire months cap just to find it's junk.  Will wait for other peoples comments to see if worthwhile.
,szore,2012-12-20T17:20Z,"Hmmm Fair enough. Sorry for the lack of sample. It's all vintage stuff, various collections of battles, portraits, aftermath, headlines, etc."
,pythonista99,2012-12-20T19:01Z,"I apologize if I'm appearing unappreciative.  But there are way too many people around who try to derail the bittorrent experience.  Of course, once one has experience with a particular uploader, confidence can be expressed.  But I'm afraid I've never seen any of your stuff and your upload history is just too short to make a call yet.  Cheers."

,szore,2012-12-30T14:06Z,"OK. This is a casual collection of photos. They are not categorized, or anything. Download it, point Picassa at it, and enjoy the pictures of a time gone by. If you are looking for some kind of ""collector edition"" type thing, then this isnt' for you. Thanx."
