,StonedYoda,2012-12-22T00:12Z,Does anyone know if the Icon/Marvel books Brilliant and Secret Service came out this week? They were solicited but I haven't found them and I know Marvel has pushed these back at least once already.  Thanks to you and everyone elsefor their uploads ! 
[T],STFmaryville,2012-12-22T03:16Z,i don't know but i looked at diamond distribution's release list and didn't see those 2. so i'll say 90% sure they didn't come out.
