REVIEW

"The Best of Santana" greatly expands on the band's original Greatest Hits package, which only covered the late 60s and early 70s. Filled to capacity with 16 songs, this collection is about as complete as one can hope for in a single volume. 

It starts out with early classic rock radio staples like "Black Magic Woman," "Evil Ways," "Oye Como Va," and the cover of the Zombies "She's not There." The disc then moves on to more recent Santana hits like the new wave-ish "Winning," and "Hold On" before returning to the early days for some excellent lengthy jams like "Dance Sister Dance" and "Soul Scrifice." 
The only thing missing is any material from Santana's recent commercial comeback. The disc gets extra credit for not adding on any inferior "new" material like a lot of such packages do.

Overall, an excellent one volume anthology from one of classic rock's brighter stars. (Customer from Amazon)
