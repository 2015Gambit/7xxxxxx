From the wild mountain town of Missoula, Mont., deep in an industrial complex of warehouses and garages, three buddies and sword-fighting aficionados are on a quest. They’re dedicated to surviving a future world dominated by the living dead… zombies. “Zorro,” Joey and Chris own and operate a blade-making business, Zombie Tools, crafting hard-core swords, machetes and throwing knives for ultimate flesh-slashing, living dead destruction. If you’re prepared for the zombie apocalypse, you’re prepared for anything.
