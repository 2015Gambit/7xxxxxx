Los Angeles gossip columnist Catherine "Cat" Grant moves to Metropolis and begins working on the Daily Planet's Sunday supplemental. She instantly becomes enamored with her co-worker, Clark Kent.

Meanwhile, Quraci nationalists acquire a high-tech battle tank and use it to stage several terrorist attacks throughout Metropolis including, bombing City Hall. Superman flies in and makes quick work of the tank. The identities of the nationalists are unknown as is the means by which they came upon the technology.

Lois Lane's mother, Elinore, is dying from radiation sickness that she acquired during a chemical explosion at her employers, Lexchem. Lex Luthor offers Lois a serum that Elinore must take monthly to survive in exchange for Lois going to dinner with him. What Lois doesn't know is that Luthor in fact staged the chemical accident and is using Lois's dying mother as a bartering tool by which to control her.

Trivia:  The cover features Superman standing before a Metropolis skyline, however two of the skyscrapers shown are obviously meant to represent the World Trade Center towers, another clear indicator that Metropolis is meant to reflect New York City.
