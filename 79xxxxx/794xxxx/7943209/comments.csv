,mattm2047,2012-12-21T21:02Z,Am my the only guy asking wtf are these guys doing? This shit cracks me up. Has nobody told these guys that they can buy alcohol from safeway??? With all this effort they put in in being secretive they should be growing weed or something. How fucking stupid can a person be? Watch moonshiners... Watch these weirdos buying sugar with there weird little dog. It puts the lotion in the basket!
,acapainter,2012-12-23T23:03Z,"Idiot, its not the ease of purchasing liquor at the local safeway. The entire thing is these guys make a hell of a lot of money producing high content alcohol, and the crime is that there avoiding the tax on the liquor which is a federal offense. not going through all this trouble to make a gallon of alcohol to sit back and drink themselves.
Do you realize that moonshiners started NASCAR, the Kennedys made there fortune running liquor during the depression, among dozens of other major things have come from the mking and distributing of illegal alcohol. It is as american as baseball and apple pie.

Now thw guys that make the liquor are so imbred they cant see straight, and there family tree cris crosses like a money tree, but dont discont them as idiots, they are pretty ingenious you have to admit.

its still pretty entertaining as well.

dont knock it though , these guys go back generation after generation with 100+ year old recipes, for alot of them its all they know."

,mattm2047,2012-12-27T09:35Z,"Fair points, but it is still a display of complete stupidity. I have had real moonshin, not a fan of any alcohol though. If these guys are making so much money than why are they living in shambles? Although anyone who can one up the government scores points with me..."
