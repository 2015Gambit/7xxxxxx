An early 1980s precondom gay sex classic. The tag line was "Where More than the Surf Is Pounding"...and is it ever! Michael Christopher plays an openly gay lifeguard and Johnny Dawes plays a "straight" one who's starting to question is sexuality. Christopher and Dawes were allegedly lovers when this film and Skin Deep, which I put on line a couple years ago, were made, and this seem to add something "extra" to their love scenes. Or maybe they were both just great actors or super horny, who knows? I found this one line a while back and not in great shape. I've improved the primitive sound some ... but sound isn't what you're interested in, is it?
