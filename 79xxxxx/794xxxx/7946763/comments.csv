,Svorax,2012-12-22T05:34Z,"Wow. You guys are awesome. I had a lot of respect for you before, but uploading your own production for torrent is just a new level. Just because of this, I will buy it. Well done on all your hard work; you deserve every penny no matter how good or bad this movie is."
,imnekolol,2012-12-22T06:40Z,"You guys are really awesome for taking the initiative and doing this. 

I might actually give you money for this. I already bought the game for me and a friend a few years ago."
,Dartillus,2012-12-22T14:14Z,You might want to edit in/post a link to your website for the lazy?
,mr.Kaasa,2012-12-22T17:58Z,I'm going to buy it tomorrow but it's not out yet so I'm here pirating it (sorry xD)
,0167,2012-12-22T21:07Z,Awesome guys!! This is what everyone should be doing instead sending DMCA notices. Can any mod make the websites addresses hyperlink please? 
,0167,2012-12-22T21:11Z,"Guys please support the makers and buy this

,dnyank1,2012-12-22T21:22Z,"Thanks, guys!

Major Minecraft fan - Mojang is just so awesome, on every level.

From Notch saying to people that it was okay to pirate Minecraft to try it, to uploading the story of Mojang for all to see. Thanks guys. 

(You don't sell 8 MILLION copies of an INDIE game by being assholes!!)

PS - I'm seeding for as long as I can so everyone can download it!"
,dnyank1,2012-12-22T21:25Z,"PS - if anyone wants to play minecraft while this downloads, join my server at minecraftpiratebay.dyndns.org

(it's cracked, of course)"
,grabmyrooster,2012-12-22T23:27Z,This will most likely be the first thing I've ever torrented and then purchased.

,kornspell,2012-12-23T01:12Z,"Greeting to you for this. I wasn't going to buy this (hell, I wasn't probably even going to watch it either, since I didn't even know this existed), but after reading about you doing this, it's the first thing I will buy after christmas. I did the same thing with Tom Lowe's ""TimeScapes"", and will keep spending the little money I manage to save on supporting anyone who's sympathetic and understands that they shouldn't deny access to art, culture and entertainment to people who can't afford it. I hope the rest of the torrent community helps you out as well. I believe they will. Come on people, let's show them what we're all about!"
,VulpisA,2012-12-23T02:10Z,"Respect, gentlemen. Christmas comes in a few days, and with it money I could use to buy this film. And I just might."
,BrandonMXB,2012-12-23T02:27Z,"I can't wait to watch it. To upload it as a torrent for free, for everyone to watch, deserves a lot of respect. Other artists could seriously learn from these guys.

Great job and I'm sure your well deserved profits will increase because of this.

Dear other game companies please take a note.
and stop acting stupid.

,KillerSpecialK,2012-12-23T06:31Z,"Big fan of Minecraft here. I watched the movie on Xbox and it was damn good. Very well done and completely blew me away. And now that I know a DVD is coming I will be buying one to support these awesome guys.

Download this now, watch, and enjoy. Then go buy a digital copy, or better yet, snag a copy of the DVD when it comes out. They deserve every penny.

There need to be more groups like 2PlayerProductions."
,AirheadOz,2012-12-23T06:41Z,Brilliant. Well done 2 Player Productions!
,imacool,2012-12-23T06:48Z,maybe you guys could get in touch with piratebay about giving you a chunk of the ad revenue based on the amount of view from this page. It might start a trend.

I will buy it as soon as it's available for purchase to support the producers, and what they do.

,Charlie117,2012-12-23T08:57Z,You know? I might actually buy this since I appreciate that you guys having an open mind about this.
,TheEndOf,2012-12-23T09:42Z,"Thanks a lot for doing this. I'm a huge advocate for 'try before you buy', so this just makes me want to buy the physical DVD more. "
,criminalskit,2012-12-23T15:03Z,"I pledge that I will fully purchase this when I can. It's just I am broke for my short holiday and pay isn't coming in for another two weeks. I literally have 3 bucks in my account and no time to watch it any time after.

Really wanted to see it. Thank you for the opportunity for making my Christmas break all the more better."
,fireconvoy,2012-12-23T15:03Z,Proof that piracy doesn't always equate to the negative side of things.
,ufromasmalltown,2012-12-23T15:18Z,The reason I sometimes pirate is simply because of pricing. I think even a digital copy of this is a bit steep its not too bad though since it's sub $10 but when its a retail game its hard. Since you are being open minded and not trying to punish those who do just wanna enjoy art without making us choose between eating a homemade dinner or frozen foods then I'll scrape whatever cash I got to actually buy this.
,whoresman1,2012-12-23T16:02Z,"Thanks, many people don't have an international credit card, and many others don't really have any money, so in behalf of these people, who would otherwise NOT have to opportunity do buy and watch this I thank you very much."
,SuspectZero,2012-12-23T17:10Z,"To be honest, there is nothing wrong with sharing.... I downloaded Minecraft AND played it for the better part of six months after hearing about it and being curious. I couldnt stop playing it. lol. I liked it so much that I thought I would show some love and BOUGHT TWO COPIES. One for me and one for my kid"

,ali3nx,2012-12-23T21:12Z,Thanks for sharing this! I watched the whole movie from here before buying and it's very well produced. Happy Holidays and you earned a sale!
,jonjonjonj,2012-12-23T23:26Z,i love how everyone says sharing art for free blah blah blah. you do realize that if they didn't charge and make money they wouldn't be able to make the movie or make the next one.

Not the world where I live at.  Fighting a very sick illness every day of existence.  Not able to work.  Not able to buy my family things they need.  Just waiting to die...   I guess.  Thank you for the torrent and everyone who supports TPB.  It is the only things that I can afford to give the ones I love.   Hope you all have a merry christmas."

,Bahash,2012-12-25T10:19Z,Thank you for uploading this here. I believe content creators deserve to be paid for their work but right now I am very poor and barely make enough to pay rent on the room I rent and put gas in my car. After the holidays I plan to give up my Netflix for one month and use that money to pay for a copy of your film. Thanks for understanding why some people pirate and meeting us half way.

,BIBIbx,2012-12-26T00:12Z,"Forget about it, I just bought it and downloaded the subtitles from the website. But guys it could be nice to put the subtitles here before someone else do it.
And the scrolly thing was really necessary ? It's a bit strange to come here share your movie and then put a scrolling thing to remind us that we are nasty pirates. It's a bit annoying, especially for people who bought the movie but downloaded it from here because the ""Redux Make more money from your content"" platform should have some problems to keep up with the charge. The download from the official website was not finished while I had the time to download it and watch it from here. "

,Rominiust,2013-01-07T07:14Z,"I find it pretty horrible that you decided to upload it to TPB, but you have to point out the fact that we're all pirates, we know we are, we're doing it.  I'm not going to buy this, why pay $8 for something when I can read pretty much all about it on Wikipedia or online for free.

You've obviously done this so you can just put the stupid scrolling text at the bottom before someone else uploaded a proper version without it.

A - 9
V - 9
M - 2, solely for the fact I can just look up most of these facts.

No, I won't buy it and I'm going to give this a negative quality rating just for the fact that you've put the scrolling text on it."

I'm 18 minutes in and it's full of clips from other peoples playthroughs of Minecraft (with consent, I'm sure) and also clips of other peoples real life videos (creeper costume, etc).

I'm not paying a cent to see what I could get freely online."
