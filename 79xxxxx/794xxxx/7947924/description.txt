Inear Display R Mem v1.0 R2







R_Mem is a granulator effect plug-in with additional ring-modulator, multimode filter and delay. It lets you deconstruct the input signal and turn it into a totally different sound, from windy soundscapes to noisy clicks. What makes it special is the addition of a modulation matrix driven by 4 LFOs and of a morphing system that lets you store two states and crossfade between them. For even more radical sound mangling, both state slots can be filled with random values.

The full version also comes with 50 royalty-free samples (24 Bit / 44.1 kHz) : a selection of dark soundscapes and sound effects carefully crafted from a mix of field recordings and digital experiments.
