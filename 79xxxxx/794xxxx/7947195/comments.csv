PgcEdit complains about nav errors and aborts. CloneDVD detects discrepancies and finishes a re-code but doesn't correct the errors. DVDShrink's FixVTS appears to be solving the problems but the end result is the same.

I don't know about the ~65 others who are seeding, but unfortunately this is completely unwatchable which is a first for me coming from NLUPPER. I have never had any issues with previous uploads, not sure where this one went wrong but I guess I'll have to convert my own.

I'm curious about others experience. My set-top player, PS3 and Xbox360 all will not play this without constant stuttering & pausing.

Thanks for the effort NLUPPER, as I said this is the first of your uploads that I have encountered such problems with so please don't think that I'm bashing you or your work."
