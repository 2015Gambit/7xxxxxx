EZdrummer┬« is a multi-microphone drum sampler designed for musicians and producers in need of a compact, affordable, easy to handle plug-in without compromising sound quality or control. The visualized drums in the interface combine auditioning of sounds and drumkit construction. The extensive drag and drop MIDI library (featuring 8000+ MIDI files) enables users to create a great drum track in just a few clicks. For more advanced handling, users can control microphone bleeding and levels between drums using the internal mixer.



New:

-authorizing the program and expansions online is now possible without having to use an internet browser to access the Toontrack website.



Fixed:

-improved syncing to the host timeline in Pro Tools.
-fixed a bug that could cause a crash if the Homepath was not set instead of showing the intended notice to reinstall.
-when a preset can not be saved to disk due to permission issues a simple pop-up will now warn the user that their preset wasn't saved.
-EZX-s that seems to be non functional (left over from incomplete uninstall process) no longer appear as valid Sound library selections.
-authorization should now be more resilient to hardware changes, particularly when removable LAN cards are used.
