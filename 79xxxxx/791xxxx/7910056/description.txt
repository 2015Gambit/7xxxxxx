Ruschlikon is a village in Switzerland with a very low tax rate and very 
wealthy residents. There is so much money in the public coffers that mayor 
can't spend it all, largely thanks to the contribution from one resident - Ivan 
Glasenberg, CEO of commodities giant Glencore. However, Glencore's copper mines 
in Zambia don't generate similar tax windfalls for Zambians. The country has 
the third largest copper reserves in the world, but 60 per cent of the 
population live on less than $1 a day and 80 per cent are unemployed. 
Christoffer Guldbrandsen investigates the dark heart of the tax system employed 
by multi-nationals and asks how much profit is fair.

A BBC Storyville film, produced in partnership with the Open University, 
Stealing Africa screens as part of Why Poverty? - when the BBC, in conjunction 
with more than 70 broadcasters around the world, hosts a debate about 
contemporary poverty. The global cross-media event sees the same eight films 
screened in 180 countries to explore why, in the 21st Century, a billion people 
still live in poverty.
