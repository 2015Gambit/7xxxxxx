Why don't you ""bug out"" (by which I mean ""Fuck Off"") to the hills right now and give the rest of us a break?
And your mum knows nothing. She's just dead."

Dude needs to get a life.  Christian, Muslim, Buddhist or Jewish just keep it to yourself and quit making others think your entire religions followers are batshit crazy.

Conspiracies and thanking god for fly farts is crazy no matter how right you may be.  

I bet he pees in mason jars.

And POTHS sounds so damn stupid, it doesn't even make sense when you explain it.  "
,PC101,2012-12-28T13:27Z,"Those are THE most close minded remarks I've ever heard. And I know you feel safe behind a keyboard typing whatever comes to your simple minds, just know people that think like this get complacent, and your time for punishment will come. I'm glad the poster understands your idiocy and doesn't take any of this to heart."

You people worry so much about the future, you can't even enjoy the present!
Thank God I'm an atheist :) "
