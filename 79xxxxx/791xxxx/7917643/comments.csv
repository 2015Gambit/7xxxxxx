,almostD,2012-12-15T23:19Z,"Demo tested and working on CFW 4.21.1 rex in dex mode. Just rename the file extension in lower cases PKG to pkg , install it, play it.

Metal Gear Solid fans could be very disappointed about this, don't expect Metal Gear, it's more like a Devil may cry or God of war..."
,Cirstal,2012-12-16T04:29Z,Is this playable with Move controller?
,Cirstal,2012-12-16T05:50Z,"Ok so i renamed the extension to lower case, i installed the game but we i try tu run it it gives me an error, it tells me to insert the disk to play the game.

,almostD,2012-12-16T16:39Z,"Try deleting the demo and all files installed and reinstall. I'm on 4.21 in dex mode.

Don't think it uses move, didn't see the ususal screen about move when loading the demo."
