I uploaded a torrent (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7895655/The_Walking_Dead_Season_3_Mid_Season_Complete_HDTV) and I suspect that this User (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7910127/The_walking_Dead_Season_3_1-8) copied my torrent as it has the same size and number of files than mine. Please help me taking this providences plagiarist! Thanks, YahSoft."

,Frank525,2012-12-13T03:44Z,They should really do something to prevent others from stealing your torrents and posting them online as their own. Maybe some sort of digital lock or perhaps attaching a warning by the FBI explaining the legality of stealing other people's torrents. Dumbass. 
[T],YahSoft,2012-12-13T03:49Z,"You are not a umploader then do not know how difficult it is to create and maintain a torrent, occupies space in HD, the network covers and gets an ass and simply copies. Even though torrent, there are rules to avoid spam and equal contents"

""Moderator, I have a problem.""

Yes, you do--you're a dumbass.  Unfortunately we can't help you with that.

You think you own the copyright on a torrent?  You think the Pirate Bay is going to protect your copyright?  Gimme a break.

I'm only replying here, rather than simply ignoring you, because the user in question happens to have been banned for an unrelated reason and I do not want you or anyone thinking it was because of your stupid comment. 

Spam moderators torrents with bullshit accusations again and you will be the one getting banned."
