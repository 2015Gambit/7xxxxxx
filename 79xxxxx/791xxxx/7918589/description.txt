READNFO reason!!
We`ve got 3 minutes missing english audio [around 1:21], we put russian audio in that place. So feel informed that THIS RELEASE HAS 3 MINUTES OF RUSSiAN AUDiO due to fact that there was no eng audio. It`s just that simple. Maybe there will be better release with full cam audio. Maybe LiNE. We don`t know. So get it - or leave it
