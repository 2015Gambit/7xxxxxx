!!TESTED ON WINDOWS ONLY!!


This screensaver shows the suit-up scene from IronMan where Tony assembles his armor for the first time.

I've used this myself for some time, and I love it.

This was re-encoded from a DvdRip into a Bink Video file, and then made executable as a screensaver.  No voodoo.

To install:
Move the screensaver to somewhere it won't be disturbed
right-click on the screensaver, and click install.
The screensaver dialog will open, and the option will appear as "Bink Video Player"


I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!
