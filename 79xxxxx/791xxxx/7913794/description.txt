The stunning maxiseries tracing the history of Batman's and Superman's relationship through the years continues as the heroes trade identities! The result of some mischief by Mr. Mxyzptlk, the contrast between Batman's efforts to be superhuman with Superman's efforts to be human reveals interesting aspects of the two heroes' costumed identities, as well as their relationships with Robin and Lois Lane. And what does Bat-Mite have to do with all this?
