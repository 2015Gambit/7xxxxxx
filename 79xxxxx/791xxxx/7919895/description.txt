"O Come, All Ye Faithful"

As a Winter Wonderland-themed party fills the 
streets of Mystic Falls, Stefan and Caroline find 
themselves at odds with Tyler over his plans for 
Klaus and his hybrids. When Caroline proposes a 
solution to their problem, Hayley finds a dramatic 
way to make it clear that she is not on board. 
Later, Klaus makes a discovery that leads to chaos 
and violence. Meanwhile, Elena and Damon retreat to 
the Gilbert Lake House to help Jeremy conquer some 
dangerous inner demons with the help of Bonnie and 
Professor Shane, who reveals a piece of ancient 
history that leaves them all speechless.
