My first upload. It's big, but that's because it is completely uncompressed!  This is a dvd rip with full 5.1 DD surround.  It is encoded in MKV format. So if it doesn't play on your pc, get the codec!  I keep all my blu rays and dvd's uncompressed on my servers, and they look fantastic in XBMC!  Enjoy and feel free to make requests!
