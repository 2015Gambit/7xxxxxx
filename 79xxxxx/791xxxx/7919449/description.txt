Fresh outta Maccie D's, William Emmanuel Bevan aka Burial drops his 2nd solo EP of 2012 'pon Hyperdub. Much like his 'Kindred EP', he focuses on long-form composition with two tracks hovering around the 12 minute and 14 minute mark respectively, taking license to really stretch out into fragmented, impressionistic and cinematic scapes strafed with elements of vintage hardcore, heartbreaking vocal samples and murkiest atmospheres. Of course, you already know that, but it's great to hear him really running about as far from the club as he's ever done, leaving us with something to dance to in our bedrooms over the festive season, 'cause f*ck knows you'll want to escape inevitable repeats on the telling box.
