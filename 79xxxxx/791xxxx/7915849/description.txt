I've tried to reconstruct this episode from differents parts founded in the internet. 1st part is entire, the 2nd, 4th-8th are almost entires and the 3rd part is missing. This part is reffered to the no. 6 of this top: 2002 NFC Wild Card Giants - 49ers game (pass interference, illegal man downfield).

Sorry for all that, but I made all that I could! I hope you'll enjoy it how it is!
