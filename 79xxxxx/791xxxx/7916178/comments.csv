[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-13T10:35Z,"Just to be clear. I've carefully thought out what I'm doing here.

Everybody knocks the ""fast food restaurant"" and nobody knocks ""fine quisine"".

But you get nowhere just listening to people. You have to watch what they do.

I'll bet a good 97% of the people here have eaten at a ""fast food restaurant""
100 times as often as they've gone out for ""fine dining"".

There are people who show up here insisting that I'm getting my ""fine quisine""
all wrong and they are oh-so-helpful about how I can improve my recipe.
And then there are those like you who think they've ratted out a cheat to the rubes.

Two of my favorite movies are ""To Have and Have Not""
(famous ""put your lips together and blow"" scene)
and ""The Valley Obscured by Clouds"" (Pink Floyd did the soundtrack)
I want to watch them ***BèàùTîFüL***, saw the second as a brand new 35mm print.
I'm an ex-projectionist and I KNOW QUALITY (it aint here).

But last night's sitcom is on over there while I'm fixing myself dinner and half
the time I'm not looking at the screen. Again, QUALITY (it aint here).

It should look and sound reasonably ""OK"" and not have any annoying defects,
glitches or sync problems. If you're looking close for QUALITY, (it aint here).

Serving burgers as fast as one man can. If you don't like the fare, that's ok.
If you think you can do batter, then by all means, I encourage you to do it so
well that you put me to shame and run me out of the business. I need a break.

The exit fee is exactly the same as the entrance fee.

Please see the Concierge at the main exit to get your hovercraft validated.
