The Simpsons - Season 24 - Episode 7 (WEB-DL - 1080p)
-----------------------------------------------------

The Simpsons record-annihilating 24th season starts September 30, with Bart going
through his little black book and finding more young starlets than Warren Beatty
at his prime. October 7, the Treehouse of Horror returns, with Springfield menaced
by a black hole, a demon from Hell, and Marge's old boyfriend Artie Ziff. As the
season continues, the stars of Portlandia, Steve Carrell, Tom Waits, and many,
many surprises help Lisa fend off a terrifying substitute teacher, the Simpsons
repel invaders from Portland and Homer prep for the end of the world - all
climaxed with the first-ever visit to the home planet of Kang and Kodos.

Portland comes to Springfield in the form of Homer's new
hipster neighbors. While Homer loves the designer donuts,
Marge is none too crazy about the breast-feeding mafia.
