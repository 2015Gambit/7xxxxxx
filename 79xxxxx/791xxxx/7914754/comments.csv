,ca1981,2012-12-12T23:39Z,it is all 5 episodes on 1 disc
,unholychild,2012-12-13T00:07Z,"Hell yeah, thank you. Will seed for 2 weeks. bought the first 2 episodes but decided to wait for this once I found out is was coming out. "
,super1313,2012-12-13T01:49Z,will this work on xkey? is it in iso format?
[V],thenoobish,2012-12-13T12:54Z,Nice! Thx man! :)
,Exiled_Xbot,2012-12-13T13:05Z,"Damn, will have to wait for a PAL torrent. Hopefully wont be a long wait."
,un3gr0,2012-12-13T14:06Z,"@super1313:
Yes an .iso, and XGD2, works perfectly on xk3y...

=>I have xk3y too! :)"
,Assassinprofessor,2012-12-13T14:16Z,how long do we have to wait for PAL?
,zero423,2012-12-13T16:59Z,"lol, fuck pal..."
,dunit80,2012-12-13T20:00Z,What the fuck? I got the game loaded but its asking me to connect to XBOX Live in order to unlock the games.
,intellq,2012-12-14T00:05Z,Anyone tested if this works?
,dunit80,2012-12-14T02:15Z,"Dont know whats going on but when you load the game it acts like its the trial version of the game. So you can only play the first couple of minutes. Then it asked me to connect to xbox live to purchase individual episodes of the game. So Ive got it to run, but its definitely not the retail version of the game. The retail version doesnt make you connect to xbox live in order to unlock the individual episodes"
,zero423,2012-12-14T02:58Z,"once you put in the game, go to your dl'ed game tab on the dash then select the episode you wanna play"
,ericnkristy,2012-12-14T03:03Z,"Is anyone else having the same trouble?  This was ripped from the original game disc that was just released this past Tuesday 12/11/12.  How do I know this, I'm the ripper.

Thank you to the un3gro for uploading the files."
,dunit80,2012-12-14T07:48Z,"@zero423 i can select episodes but it says they arent unlocked. It asks me to connect to XBOX Live to purchase the episode. 

and @un3gr0 I believe you ripped it from the original disc. Im just trying to figure out why its playing like its the trial version of the game. I dont let this XBOX connect to Live at all. Its for playing offline only. Not taking the risk of connecting it for this game."
,Smallz94,2012-12-14T08:12Z,Idk guys but you are pretty dumb i say. Its sooooo obvious that you have to play the FIRST!!!!!! episode to unlock the 2 and so on. Think guys. I just beat the first and now im playing the second one. Hopefully still works after this episode without buying.. 
,dunit80,2012-12-14T09:55Z,"UHHH NO @smallz94 like I said. It only lets me play the first couple mins of the first episode. As soon as you get in the car with the 2 guys, it ends and asks you to purchase the game via Xbox Live. It plays it as a TRIAL GAME not full version."
,zero423,2012-12-14T14:28Z,did you d/l the trial version when it first came oout? try going to your hdd and deleting it from the demos if so...or maybe clearing cache after that and try again
,un3gr0,2012-12-14T17:07Z,"@ericnkristy the game is working propely, tested in xk3y, JTAG and LT+, thanks for the rip.

@dunit80 and others, the game worked fine for me. asked for an XLBA game upgade (4kb i think), started playing episody 1, and tested all episodies. Brazilian teams tested JTAG and LT and it is working fine. So first run first episodies and then the other ones. This game cant be instaled, and yes it has the same achievemtes."
,dunit80,2012-12-14T19:46Z,"Nope. I dont have the game on my hard drive. Im looking at the start screen for the game right now. It says PLAY, UNLOCK EPISODE 1, ACHIEVEMENTS, HELP & OPTIONS, & EXIT GAME. If you click on Unlock Episode 1 it tells me that my console can't connect to Xbox Live. Please connect to access this feature. If I click PLAY, it only lets me play the trial version of episode one. I really cant figure this out. Never had this happen before. been downloading Xbox games for over 3 years now"
,dunit80,2012-12-14T19:52Z,"I dont know if you guys have your consoles connected to XBOX Live. But this console that I used for downloaded games DOES NOT ever get connected to Xbox Live. So whoever else has it working, are you connected to Xbox Live?"
,zero423,2012-12-14T21:21Z,you must connect to xbl for a small update to play it..
,un3gr0,2012-12-14T21:33Z,"I cant say how to do on JTAG.

But with LT and Xk3y, you need to be online to this game work!"
,dunit80,2012-12-14T23:10Z,I have an RGH console and it IS NOT going online. This is the first time Ive ever heard of a retail game having to go online in order for someone to have to play it. It doesnt make sense because there are plenty of people that dont have XBOX Live and dont have their Xbox connected to internet at all. So how would someone who just bought the game at the store play it if they dont go online. I doubt they would make a game like that.
,dunit80,2012-12-14T23:37Z,and any updates that are needed to play a game are ALWAYS supplied on the disc and automatically update the first time the game is loaded.
,zero423,2012-12-15T00:17Z,why ask people for help when you seem to have all the answers? as stated...YOU MUST GO ONLINE FOR UPDATE OR FIND IT ONLINE SOMEWHERE! stop flooding the comments with the same question over and over. you have been told what to do.

,K9Rage,2012-12-15T03:44Z,Sorry about all the posts LAGGING BAD
,Smallz94,2012-12-15T04:04Z,"Well. I burned the game with truncate method ran through abgx360. Put the game in and i was OFFLINE!!!!!!!! then started it. Everything was fine. I was afraid after 10min, something will tell me you have to buy the episodes. But it didn't. I downloaded the trial when it came out and something pop to let me know you have buy it after i went in the truck with those two guys. Well i deleted that long time ago. Maybe you have to delete it before you play the actual full game. No updates for me. And i played the game on a offline account. Not for my online account. Xbox live will find out if you have a lot of achievements with less years with xbox live. I hope you guys understand that. "
,super1313,2012-12-15T16:07Z,un3gr0  Thanks I look forward to trying it
,super1313,2012-12-15T16:13Z,un3gr0  You say you HAVE to be online? Is that sfe with xkey? Dont want to lose all my work.
,WeeFu,2012-12-16T20:56Z,Fully verified by abgx today. Have fun backing up your Walking Dead (kinda lol)
,joechai88,2012-12-17T13:45Z,wonderful upload!~ bro. un3gr0 keep it up man!~ thanks!~ 
,_whoa_,2012-12-19T14:21Z,Would someone please seed a torrent with all of the  rars from the actual release?
,hankdizzle15,2012-12-20T03:20Z,I wish my xk3y had a vagina. Or at least one tit.
,Smallz94,2012-12-22T14:14Z,Finished the game. Awesome story. This why they chose this game the game of the year for best story. Rate 10/10 thx for the up
