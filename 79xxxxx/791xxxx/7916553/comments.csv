Appreciate your sentiment, but have I got some BAD news for you ...

""Hot In Cleveland"" is a production of TVLand (you know, old sitcom re-runs).

They are a cable company and never switched over to the new HD format.

If you can find an HDTV version of this, you must let me travel through your inter-dimensional portal sometime."
