Covering accounting, management, marketing, law, finance, and economics, this set aims "to summarize the body of knowledge that we know as business in a single place and in language accessible to the layperson." Special emphasis is placed on careers and ethics in various areas of business, such as "Careers in Finance" and "Ethics in Finance." The 300-plus alphabetically arranged entries do more than simply define a term; for example, the entry for accounting also describes its history, principles, and agencies, shows how students can enter the profession, and provides cross references to related topics such as "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles." All the entries are in fact cross-referenced and include bibliographies offering print resources and web sites. In addition to business terms, legislation such as "Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977" and agencies, including the "General Accounting Office," have featured entries. An alphabetical index is included, with numbers in bold face indicating main entries. Many of the entries are illustrated with photographs, tables, and figures. Designed for a wide audience ranging from high school students to lay readers to practitioners, this work is highly recommended for school, academic, and public libraries.
