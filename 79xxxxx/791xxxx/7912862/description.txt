This is part 1 of the Energies Trilogy, Starpilot's 3-part mega-album.

The entire trilogy plays around with the theme of energies. The concept that everything is energy. Every thought, every intent, every feeling, every element, every particle, everything. All these waves bouncing around everywhere at different frequencies. 

The same frequencies attract and other frequencies harmonize. Some frequencies move so fast they zoom right out of our dimensional space, others vibrate so slowly that they drag everything else down. No energies die. They only change. And echo. All these frequencies make up everything we can and cannot perceive. All these frequencies move to the whims of consciousness. In a clear clean frequency there is more peace and harmony while in noisy staticy frequencies there is more chaos and disharmony. Noisy frequencies are needed in order for clear frequencies to be perceived, and vice versa, all through contrast.

All frequencies are equally important and unimportant, big and small, useful and useless, light and dark, etc. All frequencies are whatever you choose to them to be.

This trilogy is a journey through the many energies around us all.
