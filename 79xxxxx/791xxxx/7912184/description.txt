Danielle O'Hara (n√©e Lloyd; born 16 December 1983)[citation needed] is an English glamour model. The former Miss England (2004) and Miss Great Britain (2006), she first rose to prominence when she was stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after posing nude in the December 2006 edition of Playboy magazine and her alleged affair with one of the pageant's judges, her then-boyfriend, footballer Teddy Sheringham. Her title was reinstated in 2010.

As a participant in the fifth series of Celebrity Big Brother, Lloyd was accused of using bullying tactics and making racist comments directed against the Indian actress Shilpa Shetty.[1] She won the celebrity edition of The Weakest Link in 2008 and Total Wipeout in 2010. Danielle married footballer Jamie O'Hara in May 2012.
