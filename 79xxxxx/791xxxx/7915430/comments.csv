,3htthe,2012-12-13T02:17Z,"It would be nice if when you posted screenshots, they were real screenshots.

Screenshots of 1280x544 don't really represent a 1080p image."
,3htthe,2012-12-13T02:22Z,"Oh, but nonetheless, thanks a bunch YIFY."
,XxSTICH666xX,2012-12-13T02:46Z,it still looks like a screener. 1080p my ass.
,XxSTICH666xX,2012-12-13T02:48Z,Disregard my last comment. I had two downloads going and I opened the wrong one. I'll post again when it finishes.

,iamnick96,2012-12-13T14:24Z,"Thank you very much YIFY. Can some one explain to me why this 1080p rip is significantly smaller than a 720p rip (specifically the one BOZX uploaded) close to 1/6th the size... Anyway, thanks!"
,geoffoirecharlier,2012-12-13T14:38Z,"i also registered because of YIFY, merci monsieur!"
,leelee421,2012-12-13T16:57Z,YIFY.. dude u seriously need to do Skyfall 007 
,Mr_Heisenberg,2012-12-13T21:23Z,"@iamnick67 its because yify has aboslute shit for audio. You literally have to change the volume every ten seconds and thats no exaggeration. Plus its not true 1080p but its pretty close, i never have anything bad to say about the picture. It's the terrible mp3 audio he uses, it ruins the experience for movies like this and batman. I would get it from someone else but if you have low bandwith then yify is your guy. Audio is a 5 and Video is a 8"
,tyson93,2012-12-13T22:55Z,YIFY ..I love you man..you rock....

,chicken84,2012-12-15T03:41Z,why is this one very slow..never had any trouble with speed in yify torrents..
,hygenist_feelgood,2012-12-15T04:09Z,Surely I'm not the only PS3 user who wishes cinev1a protection would be included in the info. It's such an annoying surprise.
,hygenist_feelgood,2012-12-15T04:11Z,Apparently you're not even allowed to write that word here. Haha. 
,jocamero,2012-12-15T06:36Z,"Poor audio quality.  Loud parts are extra loud, quiet parts are barely audible."
,Jizocom,2012-12-15T21:16Z,"Thank you again YIFY, by uploading another torrent in 1080p quality, and such a small file."
,HKCannibal,2012-12-16T05:29Z,"Nor is there much to comment, great to film with an incredible video quality, and a small size, many thanks for your YIFY magic formula!"
,HKCannibal,2012-12-16T05:40Z,"Also do not understand what some people complain so much, this is what disincentive who does this kind of work, no one alloy the time that the person devotes to such a procedure if they think bad, has a simple solution, buy the BluRay, and their problems end, or will not, it's quite likely they begin to complain of producing, for example, the proportion who are using, there are things that will never change."

,Amafule10,2012-12-20T00:12Z,"Just watched the movie. Great Quality and great movie too :)
The audio is very good and I think YIFY has gotten better at that part.
 Also be careful with the spoilers in the comments."
,SugerHigh,2012-12-20T14:02Z,"WILL NOT WORK ON PS3.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. THIS HAS CINAVIA SCUM SHIT ALL OVER IT

(if you have modern blu-ray or ps3)"
,biggggdan,2012-12-23T20:19Z,YIFY YOUR MOVIES ROCK.  keep up amazing work.  Im not saying they are bad qaulity or anything but lately/often when you say 1080p on a movie its not really 1080p.  1080p is 1920x1080.  most of the movies u have labeled as 1080p are actually 1920x800-900 somewhere.  while not a huge deal those movies are almost closer to 720p than 1080p.  just throwing it out there.   i would love if u did these at full 1080p yes they would be a little bit bigger but qaulity would be better too.  (not that i could do better)
,biggggdan,2012-12-23T20:29Z,"please dont take my comment as a complaint either i really appreciate all your work!   i was just making possible suggestion, totally your call if u want to listen to it."
,ToneZone,2012-12-24T02:43Z,"It is Cinavia protected.
Just a heads up."
,vamss,2012-12-27T18:10Z,"YIFY am a biggest fan of you...

you are the king of Torrents....

please....!!!

,Rampage77,2012-12-28T01:31Z,"YIFY I am a huge fan of your work. I wait for your releases to download a file.

This Cinavia business, is there any way to get around it on the PS3? I watch the files on my Mac Mini (hooked up to my TV) which works great, but a lot of the time when I give movies to my brother, he has to watch it on a PS3 and the sound cuts out. Is there anything I can do?"
,hiro613,2012-12-28T02:59Z,thanks!

,radfear,2012-12-31T19:51Z,"Everyone wants to complain about cinavia but no one wants to do anything about it. 

Well here's what to do. Find the email address for your local Sony customer service office. Write them an email that essentially says this:

""I was trying to play a movie Looper (or your favorite movie you actually own) that I bought from Wal-mart (or your favorite video store) located in Cambridge (or your local town) on my PS3 (or your favorite device) but the Cinavia message kept popping up and I couldn't watch it. What gives? This is a legit movie I bought. Please tell me how to fix it so I can watch my movie. Thank you.""

If you really want to spice it up, add something like, ""It was my daughter's 8th birthday party and we had a dozen of her friends over all ready to watch Shrek on the PS3 but unfortunately you ruined her party...""

Send the same message to Verance (makers of Cinavia) customer service. In fact, why not send emails directly to their management team: 

Mario Petrocco (CFO): mpetrocco@verance.com
Nil Shah (CEO): nshah@verance.com
Joe Winograd (EVP, CTO): jwinograd@verance.com
Dean Angelico (SVP): dangelico@verance.com

If enough people complain that they can't watch legit movies, they'll have no choice but to disable it. 

This only works if we get tens of thousands of people sending them messages making them think their product is screwing up, so copy/paste this post and we'll and get everyone to do it. 

Hopefully we'll get rid of cinavia together."
,codeir,2013-01-01T01:51Z,Thank you! I love All of YIFY's releases! Very resourceful! God bless your team :D
