Only three dancers remain for the grueling final round of this life changing competition. With $100,000 and a scholarship to the Joffrey School of Ballet in New York on the line, the three remaining girls must dance for their lives. But they re not alone. Former contestants and their moms make a surprise return for one last performance. It all comes down to the two hour finale when Abby will reveal her first Ultimate Dancer.

I realise this is a huge file (one of the biggest I've uploaded) however its a 2 hour show and I didn't want to compress the file too much and lose the detail. Please be patient when downloading as my up speed is very slow and enjoy the show.
