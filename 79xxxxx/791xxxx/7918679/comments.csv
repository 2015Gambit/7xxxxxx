,Miranda79,2012-12-13T19:03Z,Sorry guys I can't figure out how to put it all in one torrent... it just keeps opening the folder and it only lets me put one file at a time... I've never done it before and was trying to get it one here cause there isn't one yet any advice on how to put all the files on one torrent?

You need to select ""make torrent from folder"", rather than ""make torrent from file"", in your bit torrent client."
