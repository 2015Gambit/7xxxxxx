,vazto,2012-12-14T02:37Z,Can someone help i downloaded this 2 times and cannot start or find the DLC missions. pleasee...
,JDFan,2012-12-14T04:20Z,"@vazto -- launch the game - go to the Missions tab - will take you to a screen that says Choose Mission to play From - select the Downloadable content tab (next to Campaign) and it will bring up another page with Dunwall City Trials - click it and it brings up the various choices (challenge Selection, Leaderboards, Gallery, etc.) - Select Challenge selection and it brings up another screen with the 10 challenges to select from - select one and play !

@ others -- download was very fast and it works as designed  - just remember to rechange your account name in the steam_rld.ini file - or it will not find your save games properly (and you do need to replace the old one or add the DLC ids manually !)"
