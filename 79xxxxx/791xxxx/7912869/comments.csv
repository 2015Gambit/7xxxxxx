,rwk71,2012-12-17T10:43Z,"Just wanted to add MY way around needing a kms server to activate Windows 8 Pro MCE.
all steps with NO internet connection

1. Get a legit MCE add feature key [free from Microsoft]
2. Install Win8 Pro w/MCE [use install key]
3. Use slmgr.vbs -ipk [Legit MCE add feature key from Microsoft] to change to Legit MCE key
4. Reboot PC
5. Click ""Activate by Phone""
6. Call number for automated service
7. Enter installation ID [as long as your MCE add feature key is legit installation id will verify]
8. Enter ID you get back in boxes A-H [Write them down also, you CAN reinstall with this same method :) only no need to call next time ]
and click ""Activate"". Now your Windows 8 Pro w/MCE is activated and LEGIT !!!
9. Reboot, connect to internet and all is good.... :)

no kms server needed

I just used this method on 2 computers and it worked great [also did a reinstall with exact method only no phone call needed when u write down ALL numbers
you get during call the first time] Install ID will always be the same on same hardware [maybe with minor changes ??] after the Legit MCE add feature key is inserted

If you repost this give me my Credit lol :) "

I tried to restart it any times, no USE.
