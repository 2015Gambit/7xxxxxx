Though Kyle surprises her daughter with a present every 16-year-old would want, the happy times in Beverly Hills won't last for long. Lisa has a food tasting at one of her restaurants, but Brandi fears she'll run into the waitress who had an affair with her ex-husband. At the tasting, when asked about her issues with Adrienne, Brandi reveals very personal information that Adrienne has always kept private.
