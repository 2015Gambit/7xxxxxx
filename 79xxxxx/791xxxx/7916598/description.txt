Autopano Giga 3

The best image stitching technology in the world Behind Autopano Giga's simplicity and ease of use lurks a stitching engine based on advanced algorithms. The image stitching technology (SIFT) included in Autopano Giga was developed as part of a research project at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver (Canada). It has been mathematically proven to be the best technology in the world at recognizing similarities between images.

Version 3.0 integrates impressive new features that will definitely make you adopt Autopano Pro or Autopano Giga:

-Choose between 9 projection modes the one that best suits your image, including Little-Planet, Panini, Hammer, Mirror Ball, Orthographic and more.
-Edit your panoramas with an exceptional efficiency: The panorama editor is now real-time and pixel accurate. The ergonomics have been totally revamped, so that all tools take advantage of the real-time editor.
-Use the Preview mode to get an instant visualization of your final panorama, before even rendering it. You can keep this mode on when you use all the tools of the panorama editor.
-Manually remove the ghosts in the overlapping areas in an instant thanks to the Mask tool. Also very useful to remove the tripod, or get rid of anything in your panorama (Autopano Giga only).

Little-Planet or Spherical? Choose between 9 projections the one that best suits your image Autopano Pro and Autopano Giga 3.0 offer new projections for your panoramas, including Little-Planet, Panini, Hammer, Mirror Ball, Orthographic and more. Choose the projection in a single clic, adjust your image with the Panorama Move option and have a real-time preview of the final result. Choose the best projection for your panorama and create original images.

A brand new experience with the pixel-accurate & real-time panorama editor It's becoming a real joy using the panorama editor of Autopano. All the tools can be applied in real-time at a pixel-accurate precision. Zoom in and check the minor details of your panorama. Add control points and see right away the stitching quality at 100%. Move the panorama, move the individual photos, make any adjustment... everything is now straightforward and surprisingly quick.

Preview mode: your rendering, before even rendering it You enjoy the many settings and adjustments you can make in Autopano's panorama editor. As you are meticulous, you like to render your panorama after each operation just to check if everything is right. The new Preview mode is made for you: activate it and get an exact preview of your final rendered panorama, either entirely or for a smaller zone. All algorithms are applied, including the exposure fusion, the automatic anti-ghost and the new, incredible Mask tool that we invite you to discover just below.

Simple and efficient Mask tool: just place green targets on what to keep or red targets on what to discard (Autopano Giga only)

Take control over the automatic anti-ghost tool of Autopano Giga: the brand new Mask tool lets you choose, in the overlapping areas, what you want to keep or discard in your panorama. No need to paint over the entire person or object: just place one or two targets on it and Autopano Giga will recognize the whole shape. And with the Preview mode described above, get an instant result of what your panorama will look like after the rendering depending on the different constraints you added.

Other great enhancements have also been made: 

-An increased general speed in all parts of the application.
-The support of RAW files of the latest cameras on the market.
-The layer editor (in the panorama editor) has new features that ease the manipulation of images within the layers, including the selection of multiple images.
-Seitz Roundshot VR Drive II motorized head is now fully supported thanks to a dedicated module, besides the GigaPan, Papywizard and Clauss Rodeon modules (read the Seitz-Kolor partnership announcement) (Autopano Giga only).
-The import plugins for Bridge and Lightroom are now compatible with the latest CS6 version (Autopano Giga only).
-A better Linux support: Kolor is engaged in providing Linux-compatible versions of its software applications and believes all major photo applications should have a Linux version.
