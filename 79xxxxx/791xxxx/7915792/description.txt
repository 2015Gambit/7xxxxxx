"Twenty Years"

As their 20th anniversary approaches, 
Frankie begins to think that Mike may be 
tiring of her company and is purposely 
trying to avoid her. Meanwhile, Sue 
frantically tries to coax Axl and Brick 
into helping her set up an anniversary 
party for their parents, and Brick falls 
into a non-responsive state when Axl tells 
him the ending of a book he's been waiting 
years to read.
