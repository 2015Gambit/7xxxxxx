Most torrents that are HD are mkv, which doesn't mean we shouldn't be upset it just means we shouldn't reasonably or probabilistically expect any different.
Also what's the problem with rars, other than wasting a minute unraring it.

Also a big thank you to sceneline who uploads all of these Daily Show episodes in HD, and only some of the thanks because the other uploads are in a really shitty resolution. "
