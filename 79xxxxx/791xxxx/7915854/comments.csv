,SirAlan,2012-12-14T09:48Z,"Thanks 2010kaiser, can this be verified as genuine so I can use MSE on it? "
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-14T11:44Z,Yes it passes the Microsoft validation test.
,Se7enAte,2012-12-15T02:02Z,Is this the fully functional one? So im able to customize windows?
,Emerath,2012-12-15T11:16Z,"Worked perfectly fine for me, installed off of my external hard drive. Thanks!

PS: Used the Windows 7 Ultimate Edition. Passed validation and no annoying ""Your Windows is fake"" messages so far, and downloads updates just fine."
,Boredguy121,2012-12-17T01:27Z,Does this still work? I recently downloaded one but the activator has stopped working. If i knew that i had to buy an OS (Friend was originally gonna do it for me) i would have saved cash out of my PC Build. 
,Boredguy121,2012-12-17T01:41Z,Ohh added on from my recent comment. The one i downloaded is giving people errors and such and warnings that it isn't genuine. I am freaked out by that stuff and i do not want my brand new PC build to fail. 
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-17T04:19Z,It works. Don't worry.
,Boredguy121,2012-12-18T01:30Z,Are there specific instructions on installing this? The other ones require me to install and run the activator stuff like that. I want specifically 64 bit so how would i install this from the start? 
,hothunter782,2012-12-18T04:08Z,stuck at 69% please seed :(
,fsxking08,2012-12-18T05:12Z,"@Hothunter, there is over 500 seeders, how many more do you need?"
,fsxking08,2012-12-18T05:13Z,"Also, @2010Kaiser, does the 64 bit part work with a current 32 bit OS? I have 32 bit installed legally with my legally bought CD, but my activations ran out so my current OS was installed with a legal CD, but I used WAT remover for the genuine stuff, and my computer can run 64 bit, but I dont have a 64 bit CD, so would the 64 bit succesfully upgrade my OS?"
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-18T17:29Z,"Boredguy121

1) Burn the image to a dual layer DVD or put it onto a bootable USB drive.
2) Then go into your BIOS and select ""Boot from USB drive"".
3) Re-boot and install will begin.
4) Select which version and architecture you want to install when you get the O/S options window.
5) When you get the 10 second countdown bar, take the USB out as close to 0 seconds as you can or the install will begin all over again.
That's it.
6) The loader incorporated in the upload does the activation for you.

fsxking08

You'll have to check if your processor supports a 64bit O/S and make sure you have 3 - 4GB or more of RAM for it to run smoothly."
,charley0,2012-12-19T23:39Z,thanks *S
,Tactix198,2012-12-23T05:49Z,Does the Windows Ultimate or Premium get all the updates that a non crack version would get? Also can Microsoft detect that the OS is not legit and stop it?
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-23T16:32Z,"Tactix198

Yes it gets all updates just like a legit copy and no it's not detected by MS as not being legit. It passes all tests i.e. genuine/legitimacy"
,Tactix198,2012-12-24T02:06Z,Well thank you 2010kaiser for a phenomenal torrent. Will be putting this on my new HDD as soon as I get it.
,rjfrech,2012-12-25T07:21Z,"BEST COPY AVAILABLE ! ! !

After install it tells you ""This copy of Windows is not genuine. If you paid for it get a refund"".

WORKS PERFECT ! ! !

Kaiser , You ARE the BEST ! ! !"

,namor666,2012-12-26T17:07Z,Thanks!
,trdt39,2012-12-27T02:06Z,why i can't download it?
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-27T04:09Z,Probably because it's a magnet link. Associate your torrent client with Magnet links and you'll be fine ;-)
,666Gott,2012-12-27T14:17Z,"2010kaiser, thnx for all of your hard work & thorough instructions, for all the whiny ass, scaredy ho, idiots, out there that never even had the decency to thank you, in their 
mealy-mouthed comments.

This refers to U, Boredgayguy121 !!!

Look at 2010kaiser' skull color & that of other uploaders too , B4 spamming a torrent with your sissy ass, unfounded concerns, BYATCH !!!"
,stnolly,2012-12-27T19:24Z,"hey 2010kaiser! i just had a quick question, im going to run this in RAID 0 and was just making sure that this will work with that. this will correct?"
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-27T20:18Z,"@stnolly

Yes, that's correct."
,bbender70,2012-12-28T22:38Z,"Hi Kaiser,

I am a bit confused. I installed Ultimate edition (64bit) and when checking the activation status, it mentions that i have 30 days to activate it.

Changing the date from BIOS and moving forward for about 35 days, i noticed that on the low right corner of the desktop it mentions:

""This copy of Windows is not genuine""

My question is:
1, Will i be blocked?
2. May i proceed and download windows updates?
3. Did i miss any installation step?

Thank you for your work!"
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-29T00:09Z,"@bbender70

It could be a number of reasons why your getting the ""Not Genuine"" message. But to save yours and my time. Download and run ""DAZ Loader v2.1.9"" from the link below and you'll be fine:

,bbender70,2012-12-29T01:19Z,"Thank you Kaiser.

I just resolved it using the loader from:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6719806/Windows_7_Ultimate_Fully_Activated_Genuine_x86_x64_-_Team___M-J-

:-)"
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-29T03:50Z,"@bbender70

  I just re-ran my torrent on 2 different machines and the install was flawless. I think the loader may have been ""flagged"" when you 1st downloaded it. Therefore giving your an install with no ""loader"" to validate the install.

Once you got the O/S installed validated and ""genuine"" than all's good.

Enjoy Win7 (As it beats the SHIT out of VISTAS' older brother..... Windows 8)

Another crock of shit from M$."
,rodcarp,2012-12-29T18:45Z,Ty Kaiser!!
,Tactix198,2012-12-30T09:51Z,Another question I have is when I mount it on Daemon Tools I dont install it do it? Do I just copy the folder to view files and copy all of that on to my usb right?
,ZendaOzzy,2012-12-30T15:29Z,"@Tactix198 
Here you have a guide too copy your windows iso file too a usb memory.
""Unfortounally""  it's in swedish but, here you go :)

[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-30T17:24Z,"@tactix198

Go to the link below and download and install Win Usb Maker from Josh Cell Softwares. It'll put the .iso onto a USB for you and make it bootable. 
While it's transfering the ISO to the USB it will ""hang"" for about 5mins. This is normal as it takes alittle time to transfer the ""install.wim"" file across to the USB.

,bluesnake2468,2012-12-31T05:17Z,does it come with windows 7 professional? i really need this

,jaywestgb,2012-12-31T15:22Z,Not bootable on my PC says Code Error 5...
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-31T15:55Z,"@jaywestgb

""code error 5"" suggests you didn't burn the .ISO to disk properly. This .ISO needs to be burned to disk at the slowest speed possible."
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-31T15:57Z,"@bluesnake2468

Yes it comes with professional."
,csarebel,2012-12-31T18:23Z,the greatest windows OS of all time.  Thanks :)
,TNTPostal,2013-01-03T01:07Z,Can i install this on a new Custom Build pc ? (blank SSD etc) ?  So no Dell or Toshiba code stuff on the system ? 
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-03T02:00Z,"@TNTPostal

Yes you can. This AIO was not created from an OEM so it'll have no conflicts with any Non-branded build.

It is simply an AIO created by the removal of the ""ei.cfg"" and the addition of a loader with service pack 1 slip-streamed into it for good measure."
,TNTPostal,2013-01-03T12:35Z,@2010kaiser Should I disable all the updates aswell? or is this updatable ?
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-03T14:27Z,"@TNTPostal

No need to disable updates. It's fully updateable and passes the Microsoft validation test :-)"
,Gumipichu,2013-01-03T16:50Z,Can someone help me. I download the torrent and mounted from the poweriso. i pressed install it went to a blue screen and said it was copying something. it was taking a really long time so i closed it. 
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-03T19:09Z,"@Gumipichu

How can you install a new operating system off a virtual drive which is a piece of software on your current operating system.
Burn the image to a dual layer DVD at slow speed and create a bootable disk.
Or transfer it to a flash drive of 5GB or more and boot off that."
,Gumipichu,2013-01-04T08:19Z,@2010kaiser Oh alright i didn't know that. it's my first time doing this and i really don't have a guide to help me out if i need it.
,Twixter888,2013-01-04T08:23Z,When I click the install button it loads for a bit then it tells me that a cd/dvd driver can't be found and I have to locate it? I'm installing it from an external hard drive.
,SaturnVO,2013-01-04T08:32Z,had to make an account to thank you for the excellent torrent. much appreciated.
,Twixter888,2013-01-05T03:21Z,So the windows 7 dvd/usb tool was the solution.
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-05T04:18Z,"@Twixter888

  Solution to what ?. Common sense says if the .ISO exceeds 4.7GB  (in reality it's 4.5GB  )

Either use a dual layer DVD or write it to a USB."
,ribrahim,2013-01-05T06:28Z,DOWNLOADING SPEED NOT GOOD
,Twixter888,2013-01-06T02:35Z,@2010kaiser I was getting an error while trying to install it with a bootable usb. It said it was missing a driver. Only when I used the windows 7 dvd/usb tool did it work perfectly.
