America's Lost Treasures
Across America there are forgotten links to our history. Family heirlooms and found objects with unexpected value and amazing stories just waiting to be discovered. Each episode of America's Lost Treasures will follow our team of two cast members on their quest to find these treasures, uncover their stories, and choose one item that deserves to take its place in a museum. The chosen object each episode will be on loan to the National Geographic Society's special exhibition of America's Lost Treasures, and the object owner will receive a $10,000 award.
