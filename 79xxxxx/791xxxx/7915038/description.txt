Indecent Noise (Aleksander Stawierej) is a 26 years old DJ, producer, engineer and promoter hailing from Warsaw in Poland. His sound is completely rapt in energetic and melodic trance sounds which can often use etcher sounds to deliver devastating impact. Playing live Indecent Noise fully uses the benefits of technology by using laptop and midi controllers with Ableton Live making his sets special and unique. His fascination of electronic music started at a very young age and at age 7 he was already listening to compilations from Jan Michelle Jarre and Kraftwerk. It was in 2004 he decided to learn how to become a producer himself.
 
His first releases in 2006 where remixes of Viscid's tracks that were released on "J00F Deep" and "Inaspace". Over the next year he improved his ability and skills gaining experience in production and signing contracts with Neuroscience Recordings and Kerf Music and certainly a turning point in his career was winning a remix competition which was organised by Communicate Recordings in 2008......
