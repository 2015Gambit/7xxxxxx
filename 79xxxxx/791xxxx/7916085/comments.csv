,jay1987,2012-12-13T20:04Z,Terrible audio. Some times it cuts out but video is clear as dvd 
,Souldiver333,2012-12-14T00:03Z,audio turns to Russian at 1:18
,nairobi19,2012-12-14T03:31Z,"If audio is russian what's the point in downloading this? Is this only for russian people? 

why does it say language: english?
"
,crumrugin,2012-12-14T07:43Z,Its only Russian for 3 minutes as pointed out in the above comment by the uploader 
,jashur35,2012-12-15T02:58Z,"10/v
7/a audio is good but 2 parts goes to other language and a few times it goes out 
8/m"
,charley0,2012-12-15T13:22Z,"Excellent, V {prolly from Russian download} = 10, A - prolly from a cam echoey, brilliant combining the two, lol, thank you, finally a watchable film *S"
,blowout1977,2012-12-16T01:56Z,"Too good for a cam. 
The movie is loaded with cool stuff, but its just too hard to follow. I turned it off after about an hour. The movie is 2h and 45min.
I ll could watch this some time in the future perhaps when I have the time and patience to put my mind to it. After awhile youll be thinking ""what is this movie about anyways?"""
,blowout1977,2012-12-16T02:00Z,"SHut up about ""the quality sucked""
The quality of the picture is great actually. This fucker just wants to spam you to another site with bullshit and viruses."
,AznAssassin,2012-12-17T10:22Z,"V: 8/10 (FOR A CAM!!! In Blu-Ray/DVD-Rip standards, this'll be a 6/10)
A: 5/10 - Barely audible with too much echoing.  Watched the first 20 mins of it - just couldn't hear half the lines properly and decided to quit.

Pity the crappy audio, ultimately this is a decent version. Good work Acesn8s! 

Get this version if u r REALLY desperate. For me, I am gonna hold out and see if someone can upload decent audio with the V of this version. "
,KinggFear,2012-12-17T10:51Z,okay i get that theres 3 min. of russian audio. so i need some opinions...does anybody know if im going to miss anything important that they are saying? or if anybody understands russian could you possibly post the missing english content in a comment?? i would be very grateful for anyones help
,meagain01,2012-12-17T13:15Z,this film is 172 minutes long! why worry about missing 3 minutes? :-) 
,cathy0o,2012-12-17T15:26Z,"If you are absolutely desperate to watch this film then go ahead and download it... 
The audio slips into Russian twice and cuts out to silence several times during the film. Probably don't miss significant info but it does get annoying...
Great picture though.
BUT THIS IS A FILM THAT SHOULD BE WATCHED AT THE CINEMA!!! It is simply beautiful."
,entez987,2012-12-17T21:25Z,"Great film and cast, use audio effects on VLC to get a better sound, I used Techno filter to get rid of the tinny sound.

V-8
A-6 cuts out small parts and turns to russian audio at times
M-9"
,din0axis,2012-12-17T23:46Z,Eng Subs please?
,swine666,2012-12-18T21:18Z,whats the point of having a flawless video if audio is from a cam? Still if video is dvdrip audio won't be too late to follow! Im waiting myself!
,sumon777,2012-12-19T00:50Z,"This movie is a serious mind-fkc! It lets you think all the time, it's really complex. I loved it and will watch it again.
Quality sucked but a better copy is available at cloud.kioschip.com worked good for me.
Enjoy this as i did! "
,Iwatcheverything,2012-12-19T16:43Z,"Video is great for what it is. Audio isnt perfect, but its like my grand dad used to say; ""If it's free, I'll take 2."" "
,chanfs,2012-12-19T22:52Z,"V:10
A:5

Video quality is perfect but audio is too echoey... "
,YardBoy,2012-12-20T08:06Z,"+1 to a quality ULer and those who seed.
