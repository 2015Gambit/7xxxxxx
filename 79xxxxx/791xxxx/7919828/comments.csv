This show is a horrible copy of SHERLOCK

Benedict Cumberbatch puts this new guy to shame. They said fuck  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle we know how to do it better....John Watsons a women, Im not sexist but come on you just want more women to watch! And sherlock is a recovered junky? they took his occasion use of drugs way to far. This is nothing but a PC knockoff trying there best not to offend anyone.
Do yourself a favor and watch Sherlock now that's what a modern SH  should be."
,Practics,2013-01-01T04:37Z,"Man, forget people like Timelessssage who can't enjoy a decent fucking show without deciding they have to rail on another decent one that's a spinoff of the same goddamn material. This also encompasses people who say that they don't mean to be sexist, but Watson simply can't be a woman? Fuck off, and go enjoy BBC Sherlock without deciding there can't be more than one decent ongoing Sherlock Holmes spinoff. That's been a business for decades, you can't stop that. Cuddle with your slash fics, tea, and a jumper elsewhere.

Thank you so much for consistently great torrents, eztv!"
,madtanky,2013-01-09T07:28Z,"@Timelesssage - I fully agree that the BBC show is of much better quality. the script is done beautifully and Benedict Cumberbatch is unrivalled as Sherlock... nonetheless, Elementary is an enjoyable show as well! Watch it with an open mind"
