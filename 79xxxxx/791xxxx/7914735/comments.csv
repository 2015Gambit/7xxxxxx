Obviously this isn't a BRRip, SaM, so not sure why you have it classified as such. Looks more like a screener, given the low bitrate amd glitches. 

That said, it is very watchable, and is the best version available at the moment. It's going to look like complete ass on anything larger than a 24"" monitor, and I wouldn't recommend playing it through a 7.1 surround system, however. 

Thanks for the Up, SaM, but you really should relist this as a Screener or R5, which it most likely is. "

This is a DVD Screener, or a possible high quality R5.  

Gave a -1 for the false and misleading title."
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-17T07:36Z,"@topeak, nazgull2k10: You're both morons. I can rip a BR disc at a resolution of 512x224 if i want, or how about 320x128 for your cel phone..? And i can compress it into 200 MB. It's still a BRrip, just not a very good one. Now, maybe there's no *point* in ripping a BR disc at less than about 720x304, but you can do whatever resolution you want. You will get *slightly* better quality ripping from a higher res, i.e. Blueray or HD as opposed DVD native of 720x400. Personally, i think VERY few movies need more than 700MB. Thanks, ETRG!"
,michaelrwatson,2012-12-17T07:42Z,"Meant to say, maybe there's no point in ripping a BR disc (or DVD for that matter) to less than 640xYYY. This is 624, which is okay. I do pity terribly you poor saps who downloaded this to watch on your 48 inch HD screen. (NOT) Again, thanks SaM/ETRG!"
,TPBGurl,2012-12-25T02:06Z,+1 Thanks Sam and Merry Christmas! :)
,Chiitah,2012-12-28T07:36Z,"No offense newbies but don't come making fools of yourself without knowing what you're talking about.  BRRip means it's ripped from a Blue Ray, it has nothing to do with what they decide to format it into after.  It's not a lie, morons.  It's how things are always labeled."
,danieloc,2012-12-29T04:54Z,"haha, who thinks a rip is a screener, LMAO"
,bigvladi,2013-01-02T06:08Z,it's a good copy
,ghenghis1,2013-01-02T11:09Z,"Thanks Sam, the video is superb, a full 10. The audio is a little dodgy at the high end, dialogue and most audio is OK, sort of unusual actually. "
