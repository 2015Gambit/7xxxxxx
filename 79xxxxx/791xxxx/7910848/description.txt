In these days of watered down comedy Nick Di Paolo's brutally honest 
performances remind us of what great stand-up should be funny, socially 
relevant and a little bit reckless. Nick began his career in his hometown of 
Boston and two-years later, made the jump to New York, where he found his 
seething, sarcastic style was welcomed with open arms by New York 
audiences at such clubs as Catch a Rising Star, CarolineÆs and The Comedy 
Cellar. It was at clubs like these were he honed his uncompromising point of 
view, which makes him not only a club favorite, but a true "comic's comic."

His range has allowed him to perform on shows as tame as æThe Tonight 
Show,Æ yet as edgy as HBO's æYoung Comedians SpecialÆ, æLate Night with 
David LettermanÆ and Conan OÆ Brien. He was twice nominated for an Emmy 
for his writing on æThe Chris Rock Show.Æ He has also had three half hour 
stand up specials of his own on Comedy Central and was one of the stars on 
æTough Crowd with Colin QuinnÆ and a stand out on many C.Central Roasts. 
Not limited to stand-up and writing, he has had guest starring roles on ôLucky 
Louie,Æ æThe SopranosÆand many sitcoms as well as in films including Artie 
LangeÆs æBeer League.ÆA critic for the Winnipeg Press said it best when he 
described Nick as "Gentle as a starved wolverine and as predictable as a 
tipsy-hop through a minefield, Nick Di Paolo is an experience constrained only 
slightly by the demands of stand up comedy."

His strong political opinions and razor wit make him a perfect fit for talk radio 
as well. He is a favorite on both Howard Stern and Opie and Anthony and 
hosted his own show on New YorkÆs 92.3 Free FM. Hide the women and 
childrenà here comes Nick Di Paolo.
