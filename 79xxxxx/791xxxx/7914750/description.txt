 Veteran Austin, TX-based experimental rock outfit My Education's feedback-drenched post-rock/space rock falls somewhere between the dark sonic drone of Sunn 0))), the desert vistas of Calexico, and the noisy atmospherics of Explosions in the Sky. Formed in 1999 and boasting a dozen players throughout its history, the band has released five full-length albums (5 Popes, Italian, Moody Dipper, Bad Vibrations, and Sunrise), numerous singles and compilation appearances, as well as a 12" vinyl collaboration with left-field hip-hop duo Dalek.
