,ThePranger,2012-12-13T16:11Z,"Kingman_Arizona - you'll have a while to wait.  The current shows (on US cable channel TVLand) are always DSR releases.  There isn't a higher quality source available.

Most of the real HDTV releases are from when it's shown on Canada's CTV (a HDTV source).  It looks like the last episode they've shown is in Season 2.

All of the Season 3 episodes labeled 'HDTV' are either mistakes (a couple of S2 episodes labeled as S3) or are from 'Spastikus'.  All of the 'Spastikus' torrents are either the DSR xvid mistakenly relabeled as HDTV or (worse) are conversion of the .264 DSR to .xvid and then relabeled as HDTV."

,Kingman_Arizona,2012-12-13T22:14Z,"To MP4sux - from Kingman,Arizona -Sorry about my post , your right .. Too bad that they did it that way .. like watching an old 19in screen .
Appreciate your sentiment, but have I got some BAD news for you ...

""Hot In Cleveland"" is a production of TVLand (you know, old sitcom re-runs).

They are a cable company and never switched over to the new HD format.

If you can find an HDTV version of this, you must let me travel through your inter-dimensional portal sometime."
