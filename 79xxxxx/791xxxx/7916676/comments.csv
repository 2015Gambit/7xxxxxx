[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-13T15:19Z,"Appreciate your sentiment, but have I got some BAD news for you ...

""Hot In Cleveland"" is a production of TVLand (you know, old sitcom re-runs).

They are a cable company and never switched over to the new HD format.

If you can find an HDTV version of this, you must let me travel through your inter-dimensional portal sometime.

The ONLY source of this ep is EVOLVE and they clearly label it DSR, which I assume is TLA for ""not HDTV"". (TLA is a TLA for ""ThreeLetterAcronym"" ).

Cheers,

[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-13T15:29Z,"P.S. eztv, VTV, TvTeam are not the encoder, they are just the distribution network. They got theirs from a really cool high-speed connection, which is how they inevitably appear first every night.

See the codec named in each file? Well it connects by a ""-"" to the actual encoder, such as ""x264-LMAO"" or ""XVID-AVIGUY"".

Brought to you by the letters ""T"", ""P"" & ""B"".

,ThePranger,2012-12-13T16:12Z,"Kingman_Arizona - you'll have a while to wait.  The current shows (on US cable channel TVLand) are always DSR releases.  There isn't a higher quality source available.

Most of the real HDTV releases are from when it's shown on Canada's CTV (a HDTV source).  It looks like the last episode they've shown is in Season 2.

All of the Season 3 episodes labeled 'HDTV' are either mistakes (a couple of S2 episodes labeled as S3) or are from 'Spastikus'.  All of the 'Spastikus' torrents are either the DSR xvid mistakenly relabeled as HDTV or (worse) are conversion of the .264 DSR to .xvid and then relabeled as HDTV."
,ThePranger,2012-12-13T17:26Z,"DSR is Digital Stream Rip. It means that it's a 480i (SD) digital stream capture (not analog).

Although it hasn't been updated too much recently, scenelingo wordpress com is a good source of info about the acronyms used by 'the scene'"
