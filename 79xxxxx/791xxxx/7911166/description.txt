About the game:

Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a cyberpunk-themed action role-playing video game developed by Eidos Montreal and published by Square Enix, which also produced the game's CGI sequences.
The game is set in 2027, 25 years before the first game in the series, at a time when multinational corporations have grown in power beyond the control of national governments. 
The game follows Adam Jensen, the newly hired security director at Sarif Industries, a growing biotechnology firm. 
After terrorists brutally attack Sarif's Detroit-based headquarters, the mortally wounded Jensen is forced to undergo radical life-saving surgeries that replace large areas of his body with advanced prostheses. 
Returning to work, he becomes embroiled in the global politics of the human enhancement movement in the search for those responsible for the attack. 
A central theme to the game is the rise of corporations in globalization, espionage, human survival, poverty and the ethics of advancing humans with artificial replacements for body parts.......
