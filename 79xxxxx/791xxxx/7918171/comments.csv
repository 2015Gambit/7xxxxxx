,SmilyCat,2012-12-13T17:15Z,thanks :D
,kusiklar,2012-12-13T17:30Z,no problem dude everything for my fans :DD
,LordDD,2012-12-13T17:48Z,yeah... i knew about the swiftshaders thing long ago. but i want the real fix patch. this way works too but its very laggy so.... thanks for trying but no...
,maJor954,2012-12-13T17:51Z,"To be honest man, you didn't make this file, this file is actually called Swiftshader and is used by old/new PCs which their video card does not support shaders.

It lags the game a lot, I tried it way before someone posted it and it's unplayable. So unless you don't want to play with lags or annoying screen wait for a real new patch guys.

Thanks anyway though, it might help others."
,xDim,2012-12-13T18:02Z,Thanks for uploading dude but we need the real one patch. By the way a tip for everyone who want to escape from that solution's brightness. While you are at starting menu go to options and change AntiAliasing option to 1MSAA
,kusiklar,2012-12-13T18:19Z,i think i never said that i maked this file and i thought that is the real patch well anyway i think some guys will help it :))
,zhakulas,2012-12-13T19:51Z,"game lags as hell, so this is not very helpful. I hope so the REAL patch will come soon"
,robis97,2012-12-13T19:51Z,"FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I already thought someone uploaded the real thing :( "
,zhakulas,2012-12-13T20:04Z,"Game Lags as hell, really hope so that new REAL patch will come soon"
,kusiklar,2012-12-13T20:42Z,I SAID it lags you have to read what i describe!
,Alopcs,2012-12-14T00:40Z,Man.. you r such a troll..
,xhizors,2012-12-14T08:01Z,"This is not a patch, or a fix, and is NOT the official patch people are looking for, even though you represent it as such."
,patthor420,2012-12-14T18:21Z,this did not fix shit for me !
,danielol,2012-12-14T21:34Z,I really hope I don't have to wait for too much time for the real patch... I want to play that game!
,Dmoll14,2012-12-16T03:58Z,"To get rid of the lag and brightness, just set the AA to 1x MSAA, turn off fullscreen and set the resolution to 800x600. it will stop lagging, but the SwiftShader overlay won't go away, unfortunately."
,pradanarta,2013-01-03T04:35Z,"SO FU*Kin LAG, is there any other way?"
,colubrid,2013-01-05T11:24Z,"Okay, mates.
What you all need to do is make sure that you have directX end_user runtime web installer, 'kay? It's a free program that will take care of that ""d3dx9_43.dll missing"" thing.
After that, follow Dmoll14's instructions in the comments. It will work a lot better but it's still laggy on windows 7 64bits so...yeah. 
We need to find a solution to this lagging thing."
,SwordSoul,2013-01-09T05:32Z,I'm beginning to wonder if anybody will ever release the actual patch for this game.
