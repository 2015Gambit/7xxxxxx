Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, December 11 transmission of the Alex Jones Show, Alex continues to break down the spurious threat of a Syrian chemical weapon attack as a means to justify military intervention and the fact that the CIA is deliberately funding and arming Jihadist terrorists to destabilize Syria. 

He'll also run down the latest fiscal cliff news and report on the underprivileged receiving Obama phones in California.
