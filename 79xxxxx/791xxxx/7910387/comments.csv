As the popular duo Mary Mary, Erica and Tina Campbell are busy career women touring the country, promoting their sixth album, “Something Big” and walking Hollywood red carpets. Music is a family business for the Campbell Sisters: Erica’s husband, Warryn, is the group’s producer and Tina’s husband, Teddy, is the drummer in Jay Leno’s band. Outside of the recording studio, Erica and Tina struggle to balance family life—Erica and Warryn are expecting their third child in February, and Tina and Teddy are raising a blended family of four. The Sisters also deal with their large, extended family of seven siblings, one of which is the group’s stylist, and their parents who have been married and divorced three times, to each other, and are currently separated.
