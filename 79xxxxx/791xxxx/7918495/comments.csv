,bsg4you,2012-12-14T06:44Z,"You're real welcome helder1965! I see you did a nice, smaller 720p season1 edit, very cool. Please tell me what you think of this 1080p edit."
,ResidentNice,2012-12-14T10:48Z,"People don't say it often enough: if you like it, buy it!

This could prove to be a very good series."
[T],helder1965,2012-12-14T11:58Z,"BSG4YOU, I just checked that is the best release of all! Congratulations by professional edition! It would be interesting if you could issue a release 720p, around 1,4~1,5GB, also! :-)"
,Crimsonian,2012-12-14T20:26Z,Is there English subtitles for this one yet?
,bsg4you,2012-12-14T21:05Z,"Crimsonian:
I just looked at the YouTube subtitles and they were all wrong ... I think YouTube scans the sound and creates the subtitles automatically that's why they're terrible.

I think we have to wait for the Blu-Ray release to get good subtitles.  Another good reason to buy the Blu-Ray and support Blood and Chrome. :)"
,bsg4you,2012-12-14T21:09Z,"helder1965: Ask and ye shall receive ... 

Here is a 720p RF21.5 encode of the master MPEG-2 Blood and Chrome complete edit:
thepiratebay.se/torrent/7923237/

It is just a little bigger than your requested 1.4-1.5GB at 1.52GB but the quality still looks good. Tell me what you think."
[T],helder1965,2012-12-15T01:57Z,"BSG4YOU, thank you very much for your job! :-) All people, I issued Portuguese-Brazilian subtiltes at Addicted site. Maybe someone else issue english version for these awesome releases. :-) Check here:

,Bean-Bandit,2012-12-20T17:05Z,Thanks bro. I myself don't like my HD stuff too compressed as it starts to look more like SD.
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2013-01-05T06:30Z,"This was a good idea, but poorly executed.  Something is wrong in the encoding that makes panning shots jump.  It is very distracting and made it look like frames were missing."
,bsg4you,2013-01-08T19:41Z,"In the quality assurance reviews there were no ""jumps"" plus all the encodings went fine according to the programs: source to raw MPEG2 to edited MPEG2 to x.264/ac3 final mkv all finished with no errors.

Does anyone else see jumps during panning shots or any other video/audio issues? Please speak up if it's wrong or right.

Nearsighted_Scrappile , what operating system and media player are you using? 

All testing of edits was done on Windows 7 with PotPlayer multimedia player, both 32-bit and 64-bit can be downloaded at:

If you have Windows, please try PotPlayer and see if the jumps issue still happens."
