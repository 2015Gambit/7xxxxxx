This is the complete Blood and Chrome pilot movie using the 1080p webisodes as the source. Blood and Chrome is the second prequel for the new Battlestar Galactica 2003-3009. From Wikipedia: "The story follows William Adama, a young pilot with the call sign "Husker". Adama, a recent Academy graduate, is assigned to the newest battlestar in the Colonial fleet: the Galactica."

Blood and Chrome heavily used CGI not only for space scenes but for outdoor (e.g. a snowy planet) and indoor scenes. The BSG sets were scanned before being auctioned off so they could be digitally recreated and Blood and Chrome uses this extensively.

All the approximate edit points are listed below. The video and audio are demuxed so the audio edit might be a few frames different from the video edit but it'll be close. All the video edits are hard cuts with no fades but the audio edits include fades and overlaps. A custom credit edit is at the end as the music plays out.
