For an XVID AVI with MP3 audio, I'm going to be bold:
V=10
A=10
.
For this (I hope) special occasion, I've doubled my bit rate.
.
Truly sorry this has slowed down - the subtitle thing is killin me.

The text on the screen is in French - the dialog is in English
.
For the few lines in the show that need translating,
I've included a very small .srt file if you know how to use it.
It works for me (XP / MPC), your mileage may vary.
It can be opened as a text file if all else fails
Tells you what was said when.
