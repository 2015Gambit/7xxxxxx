"Love the Way You Lie" is the second single from American rapper Eminem's seventh studio album Recovery. Singer Skylar Grey was inspired to write and record the demo with Alex da Kid when she felt that she was in an abusive romantic relationship with the music industry. Eminem wrote verses to the track and chose Barbadian singer Rihanna to sing the chorus; the collaboration was influenced by their past experiences of domestic violence. Recording sessions were held in Ferndale, Michigan, and Dublin, Ireland. The song is a midtempo hip hop ballad with a pop refrain. Backed by guitar, piano and violin, it describes two lovers who refuse to separate despite being in a loveΓÇôhate abusive relationship.
