,RTT2,2012-12-30T11:07Z,"I'm sure the rip is great (2-pass ensures quality), but the film is largely hype, sadly. Too many unoriginal ideas from other films, and one absolutely inexcusable scene lifted straight from Alien 3, which doesn't even make sense here, 'organically'. I won't say any more to avoid spoilers, but you'll know what I mean when you see it. Worth a watch, though."
