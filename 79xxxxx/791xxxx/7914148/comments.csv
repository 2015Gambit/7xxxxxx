[H],Cerberuss,2012-12-12T09:07Z,NO legit this is the TV series based on the original film and aired on cartoon network. :)
,madroxDupe,2012-12-12T23:16Z,this is name of tv series but what is this big file ? saeson one marged into one file ? dvd edition of half of season ? i cant figure that out from nfo
,arslanistic,2012-12-12T23:41Z,"from the screenshots it looks like the complete tv series [full 1st season, all 13 episodes merged into one big file] but im not sure..."
,ScottyD7421,2012-12-13T01:32Z,Very disappointed in the fact that there is absolutely no information pertaining to the upload. The fact that they are making a sequel to How to Train Your Dragon called Dragon: The Riders of Berk makes the uninitiated think this could be that movie. It would take 30 seconds to add a bit of info about the file. Disappointed indeed.
,jayrockskee,2012-12-13T01:56Z,"@SCOTTYD7421:

Fucking leave one then! Nobody gives a shit about your disappointment. Just stop whining and leave a rating yourself. Crybaby. Come out of the closet already..."
,Oinkness,2012-12-13T06:12Z,"@jayrockskee

Eat a dick, you cockjuggling jew. Scotty has the right to be disappointed as much as he has the right to share his opinion. I don't give a fuck what backwater country you live in but in America, this stuff comes standard. "
,BrentacoN,2012-12-13T07:08Z,"@Oinkness What does (here in america) have to do with anything?

you do know this is a swedish website dont you?"
,TPBfanatic,2012-12-13T07:32Z,"^^^
Truth.
Suck a dick SCOTTYD7421"
,RiceAndDice321,2012-12-13T09:18Z,"7000 seeders, and still no comments on quality?"
,dishto,2012-12-13T10:24Z,The 2nd link in the description contains upload information.
,gekfoot,2012-12-13T10:48Z,"A - 10
V- 10
M - 6

Honestly, it didn't come close to the first How To Train Your Dragon but that movie was fantastic so it had a lot to live up to.

Also fuck you LegendET for not providing any info on this and fuck you even more jayrock for keeping the whole ""you are never allowed to complain about poor effort on TPB"" circlejerk going."
[V],Acesn8s,2012-12-13T11:58Z,"@ gekfoot click the 2nd link it says very fuckin CLEARLY (nformation.net) and then insulting the uploader for your own mistake, Are you daft??? Its simple u don't like it go to the cinemas or wait some months and rent. 12 other comments and no one bothered to rate Legend on his effort for quality, u guys are some real cases. A/10 V/9 thanks Legend/UnKnOwN.   "

,olimpas83,2012-12-13T13:06Z,"Yea it clearly not first movie of it, but some chapters are really funny. :) A/V - about 8, Movie - about give 7(to me its little dissapointed about that movies graphic), cause its some continuing, and i dont blame legendET, hes only share to us this, he dont made that movie."

,SgtGoldy,2012-12-13T14:50Z,"@SCOTTYD7421:

You make us (Americans) look bad. No wonder all the other countries hate us. I apologize guys, were not all fat and stupid and *insert stereotype*."
,ScottyD7421,2012-12-13T15:06Z,"Yes yes yes ScottyD7421 suck a dick...well it wouldn't be the first time!!

The second link clearly provides the information on the upload. 

Mucho apologies to LegendET for any offence caused."
,ScottyD7421,2012-12-13T15:08Z,@SgtGoldy ummm I think you have me confused with someone else? I'm not American nor did i make any comment about America or Sweden or any other country. 
,vatel88,2012-12-13T16:17Z,"Just FYI, The NFO Link provides ZERO INFORMATION as to WHAT THIS ACTUALLY IS! 

 Standard video/audio codec NFO nothing in the NFO tells you that this file is NOT THE SEQUEL and that it is just all the episodes from the TV SHOW mashed into one file. 
"
[T],helder1965,2012-12-13T17:46Z,"Calm down, guys. :-) I got only this as information in other sites, but there is any list of episodes included; as each episode has 20m and this release has 1h26m, only a few episodes were compilated, not all!

Plot: After Hiccup and his Night Fury companion, Toothless, saved the people of Berk by defeating the Red Death, they inspired the Vikings of Berk to make peace with the dragons. However, Hiccup learns that the co-habitation is far from harmonious with Viking ignorance and the Dragons’ instincts threatening to destroy the alliance. To solve the problem, Hiccup’s father, Stoick the Vast, organizes the Berk Dragon Academy where his son and friends can learn all about Dragons. Even as grumpy doubters like Mildew and villains like Alvin the Treacherous oppose them, the Viking teens of Berk and their dragons dedicate themselves to achieving a vital understanding.

,MVC78,2012-12-13T21:22Z,"I wish uploaders had the option to boot off some of these ingrate commenters, it never fails to astound me what whiney little entitled fuckers some of these leechers can be when it comes to the FREE things that are being shared with them. "
,Gimpman83,2012-12-13T21:42Z,"Thank you LegendET, I will enjoy watching this with my daughter. Quality looks good from what ive skipped through.
Shame on you ungrateful turds. Grow the frack up and comment appropriately!"

,Jasperiovich,2012-12-14T02:24Z,"Thanks LegendET

Now a message to all those who pollute the comments!!!!

GROW UP GUYS!!!! nobody wants to read that.
By reading the comments, I wanted to know more about the file........not your frustrations!"

,minasat,2012-12-14T06:35Z,These are the four first episodes compiled & you can download the rest from yt or here... 13 in all & next year there'll be a season 2 which is a prequel to the 2014 movie.
,aradiel,2012-12-14T23:50Z,"Firstly, this isn't a movie, so it's been uploaded to the wrong section. A simple IMDB number paste when you upload is always helpful, rather than an image link to a text NFO buried among various other image links.

Anyway, the TV series just finished airing, so you can get the whole first season, rather than just the four episodes here. The series is in keeping with the feel of the original."
,araysoloartist,2012-12-19T06:47Z,I want to thank you and ALL the others for providing entertainment for us...you ROCK!
,shifun,2012-12-19T13:19Z,"http://www.foxconnect.com/dragons-riders-of-berk-exclusive-premiere.html

It's not that difficult to figure it out, if not completely retarded, it's a rip of that dvd. it includes:

**Viking For Hire
**How to Start a Dragon Academy
**The Terrible Twos
**Animal House"
,spankdaddy,2012-12-21T01:36Z,"Holy shit .... hahahahahaha back and forth we go this is funny shit, hell im only posting because ... well frankly it appeared every other dumbass wanted in on the show.
