,diamond-optic,2012-12-13T10:49Z,changelog just says 'no idea whats updated' ?? is this legit?
,Taix4,2012-12-13T17:28Z,"duh...
thanks for the up"
,hitmaneid,2012-12-13T17:50Z,"Yup, its legit alright. Same thing is also available on the exclusive private trackers. And it seems you don't need the other updates if you download this one, just the original game."
,shotmaniac,2012-12-13T18:07Z,Downloaded the 11 parts and is working
,Eizzo,2012-12-13T20:32Z,"So, does this contain the whole game or I need to install it separately?"
,diamond-optic,2012-12-14T00:04Z,"@ Eizzo

pretty sure whole game, as with the patches due to the way the steam updates are done...

-------

anyone know if all the dlc is still working after the patch? or is it like some of the other patches where it stopped working till a seperate dlc crack was released"
,kelvinkeh,2012-12-14T10:02Z,"for safety concern, it's better dun update or install this update first.. for me it's stil an unknown update tho.. >"
,shotmaniac,2012-12-14T17:23Z,You need the game before install update
,iRrraPirate,2012-12-15T22:41Z,is anyone else getting a binkw32.dll problem when you try to start the game? I think the torrent is missing a file. I installed the game and copied the cracked files as instructed an the game is no go.
,Sameh458,2012-12-17T07:16Z,Thanks ;) but this update have with (Nightmare in North Point DLC)?
,Sameh458,2012-12-17T23:41Z,"No idea what is updated sorry i didn't see this xD
thanks man ;)"
,LCFer,2012-12-19T15:37Z,this comes with all dlcs so far?
,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2012-12-20T09:54Z,"binkw32.dll error is easy enough to solve unless you're an idiot

look for the dll in another game you have"
,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2012-12-20T10:04Z,"oh and this is the full game version 1.8 so just ignore the noobs that said otherwise

because of the protection this game uses, they need to replace all files

so no.. you dont need to install anything else

and to answer another question.. no dlc. look elsewhere.. not hard to find

not gonna bother with this.. no real changelog no download

and yes, im an asshole"
,varso2012,2012-12-20T21:38Z,Mr_Ceiling_Cat....yes you are and asshole and you have the faggest nick name i ever see you fucking dickless motherfucker...
,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2012-12-21T21:18Z,you break my heart with those words
,Skrotorian,2012-12-22T20:11Z,"Could someone please confirm that this is the full game, not just the update, like CeilingCat said earlier."
,kunaulia,2012-12-22T21:00Z,Seed please! :)
,Skrotorian,2012-12-22T22:24Z,is this the FULL stand alone patched game or just an update?
,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2012-12-23T14:15Z,"its the full game...

10GB update? i think not"
,Skrotorian,2012-12-23T19:32Z,"The previous update (1.7) was around 9 GB and it wasn't the full game, just the update. That is why I want to be sure."
,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2012-12-23T22:06Z,"1.7 was the full game too.. im playing it

like i said they have to replace all files which is why its 10GB"
,Skrotorian,2012-12-23T23:39Z,"Thanks Cat, confirmed here also."
,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2012-12-24T00:16Z,np
,chasden1,2012-12-25T08:36Z,"Can someone other than ceiling scat confirn that you don't need the original game installed? If i need the original, which release should i find on TPB?"

,tiboka,2012-12-27T12:24Z,"This is just an update. Because of scene rules shitrow cant use xdelta patcher, that's why they have to repack the updated files, which in this case nearly the full game..."
,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2012-12-27T12:33Z,uhh no.. its the full game
,RealVisk,2012-12-29T15:00Z,"Guys, it's the full game. You don't have to mount any image, just run 'Sleeping.Dogs.v1.8.Update' and then copy the cracked files."
,RealVisk,2012-12-29T15:05Z,If you are getting the binkw32.dll error just google and download the file and place it in your game folder. Works for Vista 64 SP2

,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2012-12-31T21:30Z,^ typical lame mom joke. be more original
,BrandTheBiggie,2013-01-02T10:50Z,"I ran into a copy of Sleeping Dogs 1.8 by SKIDROW. However, I am having problems with installing the game with .bin files that came without a .cue file.

Sleeping.Dogs.v1.8.Update-1a.bin, Sleeping.Dogs.v1.8.Update-1b.bin, Sleeping.Dogs.v1.8.Update-1c.bin, Sleeping.Dogs.v1.8.Update-1d.bin, Sleeping.Dogs.v1.8.Update-1e.bin, Sleeping.Dogs.v1.8.Update-2a.bin, Sleeping.Dogs.v1.8.Update-2b.bin.

Tried creating an individual .cue file for each but mounting was unsuccessful. Wanted to create .cue that incorporates all the .bins but did not know how to. Programs like Alcohol, Daemon, etc werenâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t able to mount them.

I even tried combining the .bins so that creating a .cue would be easier and then converting the single .bin file to a ISO file but couldnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t find a reliable program that does that.

Perhaps you guys could give me a hand here ?

Cheers"
,kadorna1,2013-01-03T16:07Z,"BrandTheBiggie you don't know how to read right? these are not disc images, read the NFO and figure out how to update..."
,ranneyceth,2013-01-05T21:07Z,"Installed the game no problem. Fixed the binkw32.dll error, and got the game to launch fine. After I click on New Game it goes to the first loading screen, sits there for a couple seconds, then crashes. Tried 3 times and same result. Any suggestions? Much appreciated."
,pirateadlawan,2013-01-07T07:32Z,"fixed the binkw32.dll error but the game still wont launch. the only working crack version for me is the (v1.4 3DM Crack Only)

anyone having the same problem? "
