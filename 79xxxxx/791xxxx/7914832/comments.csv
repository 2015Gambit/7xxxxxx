,MisterE2108,2012-12-12T23:58Z,"Bozx, possible to get this in the 4g range? Thanks in advance. "
,LamarSmith,2012-12-13T00:44Z,"If you have uTorrent,

Right click on the file and open Preferences and check the Initial seeding box. 

The more people that do this the faster it will go."
,adfe1008,2012-12-13T01:00Z,"@MisterE2108

why 4g?"
,Rzi,2012-12-13T01:16Z,Don't use the initial seeding it will only do harm 
,STFU_Nazi,2012-12-14T20:25Z,Don't know why is this coming out only now. In Estonia this movie was in television already.
,Dreadlokz,2012-12-17T02:39Z,"Tyvm!
Is there a fullscreen version?
Why most 1080p movies are not fullscreen these days?"
,LFGD1978,2012-12-18T19:44Z,"1266 and no comment on the A/V? WTF..... at 11.19 GiB it better be a good RIP. 

to @Dreadlokz This title will be released on December 31, 2012 so because the movie has no official release yet you can only get 1920 x 812, if you want 1920 x 1080p wait a little more."
,kdallas2010,2012-12-19T04:47Z,@LFGD1978 -- release date has jack to do with it...  the rip is from a blu-ray source.  There's always at least one person that complains or asks about this on every single HD torrent:  The video portion of the 1080 vertical pixels is seldom 1080.  This is the actual video frame with 134px cropped from the top and bottom (the so-called black bars).

,kdallas2010,2012-12-19T04:55Z,sorry about the dupe posts... would remove if I could
,Skram0,2012-12-30T06:37Z,"@kdallas2010, I hear ya. Noobs just don't understand how aspect ratios work.

Full screen 1080p would be 16:9, which most movies are not filmed in. The main stream 16:9 TVs sold now was a compromise between 4:3 and the widescreen movie format. I think to own a wide screen movie format TV would look way too vertically short and rectangular for home use. Then when you watch HD Television, like CSI, then you'd complain about the black bars on the left and right sides."

Bad pixelation"
,lotus14,2013-01-06T02:42Z,"Not as good as most BOXZ rips. Some pixelation, but not as bad the 720p BOXZ. Best version I've seen.

,balanced,2013-01-07T02:13Z,"This copy is cinavia-infected so if you're using a cinavia-enabled blu-ray player your sound will be muted after a short period of playback time.

It's fine though on non-cinavia infected equipment."
