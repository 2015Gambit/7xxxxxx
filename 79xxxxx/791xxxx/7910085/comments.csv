,vangefinn,2012-12-13T02:04Z,"Some scenes were cool. But this was a terrible movie, just bla bla drama and NOTHING happening. I just came back from the movies, I almost fell asleep even though i drank shitloads of coffe before i went. Very cool cinema photography though. And good acting but a drama crap. "
