"Diamond in the Rough"

Manny and Luke's little league team 
unexpectedly makes it into a playoff game, so 
Claire and Cameron scramble to find a 
location and decide to do a makeover on a 
rundown field. Inspired, Claire and Cam want 
to try their hand at flipping a house while 
they're at it, and Phil and Mitchell fight 
over who will be the bad guy to tell them no. 
Meanwhile, Gloria tries a bonding technique 
by using a microphone to sing to the baby in 
utero, which definitely incites a reaction 
from Jay.
