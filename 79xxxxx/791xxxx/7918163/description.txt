What starts as a miserable day in a dead end job turns into a fight for survival as Aaron is bit by a scorpion, attacked by a rattlesnake, kidnapped, chased by gun-toting maniacs, mesmerized by a hot new co-worker and tortured by a bus load of heavily perfumed old ladies. Albeit the odds are against him, Aaron rises to the challenge to conquer his fears and vanquish his enemies.
