2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

With only 19 more days left in 2012, my most recent ambition of reaching 1,500 titles by the end of the year seems a little out of reach now.  But with today's 30 new titles, we're now up to 1,410 on the year.  And, Lord willing, I might be able to still squeeze in one or two bundles in the time remaining.

This 53rd bundle includes the following 30 releases...
