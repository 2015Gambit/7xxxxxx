Two really good collections, the first volume features some cool old issues that are rarely seen in trades (Cat #1, Shanna #1) and the second volume has the women's lib issue of Avengers that is so "dated" it'll have you laughing -- still a great story though! About 10 comics and 225 pages each volume! All credit to ILoveReprints of DCP!
