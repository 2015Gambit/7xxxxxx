Miniature Britain
Biologist George McGavin goes on a journey around the British Isles to show us the extraordinary little things that are vital to our land. With a revolutionary new microscope camera seven thousand times more powerful than the human eye, George reveals the surprising beauty of Britain close-up. Caterpillars' feet have hooks that anchor them to leaves even upside down, the wings of butterflies and moths are a kaleidoscope of colourful scales that keep them safe from predators, bee stings have barbs that make them stick deep in your skin, and feathers have thousands of hooks that zip together keeping birds airborne. Our cities are full of invisible miniature life too: millions of cute 'water bears' graze pavement mosses and our homes have legions of dust mites scavenging for food in our carpets.
This is Britain as you've never seen it before.
