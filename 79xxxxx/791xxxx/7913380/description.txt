Story 1: Revelations

I/O leader, John Lynch, investigates the explosion that occurred near Washington, D.C. and finds Void teleporting in with the team of WildC.A.T.s. They then immediately teleported away, back to Emp's headquarters at the Halo company. Once there, they inform Voodoo about what's going on, how two alien forces, the Daemonites and the Kherubium, have been at war and have spread it, in secret, to the planet Earth. The Deamonites have the ability to possess other beings while the Kherubium have bred with Earthlings, granting people with superhuman powers. Before too long, John Lynch sends the Black Razors to infiltrate the WildC.A.T.s. and Lynch asks for their assistance. They soon learn, thanks to Voodoo, that the Vice President of the United States is actually a Daemonite and have to stop him. Unfortunately, the Vice President is being protected by members of Youngblood, a superhero force team. In the shadows, Gnome is pleased that he has planned all this to his benefit.
