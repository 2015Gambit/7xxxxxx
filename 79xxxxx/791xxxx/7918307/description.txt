Bloodties is a 1993 Avengers/X-Men crossover story, and a direct sequel to the X-Men Fatal Attractions story line.

It details the fallout from Charles Xavier's infamous mindwipe of Magneto, which ultimately led to Magneto's defeat. The story details a civil war between the human and mutant populations of Genosha, incited by Magneto's former protog√©, Fabian Cortez. Unaware of Magneto's incapacitation, Cortez attempts to shield himself from his former master's wrath by kidnapping Magneto's granddaughter, Luna. However, as Luna's father, Quicksilver, had strong ties to the X-Men, and her mother, Crystal, was a member of the Avengers, both teams became involved in the Genoshan conflict. The situation was further complicated by Magneto's lieutenant and self-proclaimed heir, Exodus, who sought to kill both Cortez (for his betrayal) and Luna (for disgracing Magneto's bloodline by being merely human.)
