[S],soda,2012-12-12T10:57Z,You're going a little overboard with your comments on other uploaders torrents--it's looking a little spammy.  You might want to stop now rather than wait until we feel obliged to step in.

Don't know if you listen back in, but message received. I only wanted to alert people when damaged goods were being presented as ""Quality Merchandise"", that my efforts are so numerous as to border on spam, well maybe you did me a favor by warning me off my ""lost cause"".

Well, that quashes my ""raison d'ĂŞtre"", my ""mission from god"".

Local supermind overrules the god in my head. It happens.

Bummer.

Well, it's not like LOL / DIMENSION were going to stop their evil pixelating ways, right?

So, from now on I'm a convert, this'll be my last mention of LOL / DIM - doesn't the Emperor's new clothes look just stunning?

Gonna re-think, gonna slow down, gonna finish XIII: the series season 2.

May be time for a break (the hours are great, the wages non).

AVI XVID is still needed, so how about some kind soul(s) start stepping up?

UseNet's somewhat shot for sourcefiles. Maybe waiting to see how that shakes out is part of what's becoming a clearer ""message from the universe"".

Like Ali Baba once said - ""There's always tomorrow"".

On the understanding that you will continue focusing on your own impressive set of uploads rather than on critiquing the efforts of others, I've bumped you up to VIP."
[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-15T14:20Z,"I noticed and it took me a couple hours to think to look here - thank you very much.

It's a shame to give up what started me on all this in the first place,
But I suppose my point's been made (overboard, obviously).

I just think somewhere would be some sense of quality control.
I guess my statements will be best made by setting a good example.

I hope mentioning WHY I've waited for a ""WEB-DL"" in my own description is permitted?
If not, please let me know.

For the record, I'm having the time of my life here (and there and UseNet too!).

Thanx for such a rich and diverse corner of cyberspace for me to play.

[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-17T07:04Z,"For the record - on the rare occasion that one of my files is defective
I want anybody and everybody to tell me as soon as possible.
I then make great efforts to solve or rectify the problem.
It truly bothers me when I put out damaged goods - no matter the excuse.

I just think it's a shame that others don't share this view.
They used to. They used to rush right out with a repack, proper or whatever.
Now they pretend that big black blotches are no big deal.
Just read in an EZTV forum how people with streaming devices have
their video aborted by these pixelation errors every time.
These errors are caused by the more CPU intensive x264 encoding on-the-fly
A rational person would just save the recording and encode it properly after.
It would waste a whole half or full hour. But speed now trumps quality.

Jes' sayin'
