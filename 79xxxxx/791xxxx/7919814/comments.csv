[T],TalmudTimmy,2012-12-14T08:58Z,"I feel sorry for you, AAARK. You have lost the objectivity you had that once led you away from the mainstream media and to people like Alex Jones. Unfortunately now, you blindly follow Alex Jones the way you used to follow the mainstream media. You are making the same mistakes. When will you learn?"
,t0ast512,2012-12-14T18:17Z,lol talmudtimmy... next you'll blame me for being jewish and causing 9/11....
[T],TalmudTimmy,2012-12-14T19:43Z,"t0ast512, how is it that you fail to see the hypocrisy here? You people condemn the mainstream media for being lies and CIA controlled, yet you won't ever consider that Jones could be telling lies and being CIA controlled too. Why is Alex Jones immune from criticism? Is that objective or logical?"
