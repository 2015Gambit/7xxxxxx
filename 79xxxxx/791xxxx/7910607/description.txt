We went with 'Medium Compressibility' CRFs. 

Michael Bubl returns to NBC with another star-studded 
holiday Christmas special, "Michael Bubl: Home for the 
Holidays." The multi-Grammy Award winning singer is joined 
by guest stars Rod Stewart, Blake Shelton, and fellow 
Canadian Carly Rae Jepsen, as well as Elmo, on songs 
including "Jingle Bell Rock," "Let It Snow," "All I Want 
for Christmas Is You" and "Winter Wonderland." With a 
little magic, Michael performs a special duet with Bing 
Crosby of the classic "White Christmas."
