[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-12-18T22:38Z,"@BOZX:
Fine for playing!
Nothing ... for re-coding.
[I think ...this is the point....][for now?]
Thanks."
,mattbadke,2012-12-22T06:25Z,"""cinavia is not a virus lol, it is a Sony law. Just stop playing movies on any Sony product and it will work like a charm. thanks BOZX"" That's not accurate, cinavia is on many blu ray players not just sony. Nobody's answered my question, does this file have cinavia encoded on it??"
,ps7825,2012-12-22T14:58Z,"Great movie, thanks so much :)"
,ToneZone,2012-12-24T02:41Z,"@mattbadke  YES, it is Cinavia protected.  I have a Samsung BluRay player and the audio gets cockblocked by Cinavia protection."
,KCAtBat2012,2012-12-24T04:48Z,I have never done this before but can you please upload Armed and Innocent (1994) if at all possible.  This movie has no torrents and I cannot find it anywhere around me to even  legitimately rent or purchase.  Thank you.
,Mingin,2012-12-24T16:37Z,Thanks Bozx - great quality download
,acsmith1972,2012-12-27T07:05Z,This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. 
,Ryall,2012-12-27T19:08Z,"Thanks BOZX you rock!

FYI: Cinavia is a form of copy protection encoded within the sound of the film. It is hard coded during production, at frequencies we can't hear. This means cams/rips will not play on devices listening for the cinavia watermark. As soon as your PS3 detects it, it will shut down playback. There is no work around other than to use a computer or an xbox instead.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinavia

Originally, ps3s did not have cinavia installed, it was an update which added it. (Similar to the ps3 update which killed linux.) This was a stupid move by sony, as ps3s are now only games machines. 

Get a cheap PC/Macmini with an hdmi port, then you can play anything. There is no way in hell that apple or microsoft will add cinavia, so it's a safe investment.  Additionally, once you get vlc installed, there is no audio/video torrent you won't be able to play."
,scrubs1818,2012-12-28T09:14Z,I gotta question: Everything I've ever burned has worked out just fine. For some reason when I burn this movie it has serious video issues. I've tried this 720p version and the other 1080p version on TPB. I use Nero to convert it to DVD and then burn. It's coming out pixelated and choppy with the video feed. Would this be a bad burner or Nero screwing up? Any idea?
,scrubs1818,2012-12-28T09:15Z,BTW: plays awesome on my computer and quality is great if anyone is wondering
,FentonSpadrig,2012-12-28T23:53Z,Wow. This movie was REALLY GOOD! Well above my expectations!
,radfear,2012-12-31T19:43Z,"Everyone wants to complain about cinavia but no one wants to do anything about it. 

Well here's what to do. Find the email address for your local Sony customer service office. Write them an email that essentially says this:

""I was trying to play a movie Looper (or your favorite movie you actually own) that I bought from Wal-mart (or your favorite video store) located in Cambridge (or your local town) on my PS3 (or your favorite device) but the Cinavia message kept popping up and I couldn't watch it. What gives? This is a legit movie I bought. Please tell me how to fix it so I can watch my movie. Thank you.""

If you really want to spice it up, add something like, ""It was my daughter's 8th birthday party and we had a dozen of her friends over all ready to watch Shrek on the PS3 but unfortunately you ruined her party...""

Send the same message to Verance (makers of Cinavia) customer service. In fact, why not send emails directly to their management team: 

Mario Petrocco (CFO): mpetrocco@verance.com
Nil Shah (CEO): nshah@verance.com
Joe Winograd (EVP, CTO): jwinograd@verance.com
Dean Angelico (SVP): dangelico@verance.com

If enough people complain that they can't watch legit movies, they'll have no choice but to disable it. 

This only works if we get tens of thousands of people sending them messages making them think their product is screwing up, so copy/paste this post and we'll and get everyone to do it. 

Hopefully we'll get rid of cinavia together."
,tbpgrow,2013-01-01T23:20Z,Perfect 720p BluRay!
,lotus14,2013-01-05T07:07Z,"Not the usual great quality from BOZX - a lot of pixelation. Maybe the 11.19GB one...
A:9
V:7
M:10"
,EnragedPlatypus,2013-01-07T12:31Z,"Maybe there's a reasonable explanation but the audio in this was shit. It wasn't so much the quality as it was variation in the audio. Dialogue is super quiet, action sequences are ear shattering. Super irritating."
