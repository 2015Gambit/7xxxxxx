"Year's End"

Oliver discovers that after he and 
his father went missing, Moira and 
Thea stopped celebrating Christmas. 
Determined to make up for lost time 
and restore a sense of normalcy to 
the Queen household, Oliver decides 
to throw the family a Christmas 
party. Meanwhile, Tommy asks Laurel 
to spend Christmas with him but she 
points out that Christmas was also 
her sisters Saras birthday and she 
needs to be with her father. Tommy 
suggests changing things up might be 
the best way for everyone to heal but 
Laurel isnt sure her father is ready 
for that.
