,nezzan66,2012-12-20T21:54Z,"Thank you very much.

I really hope this is going to be seeded the whole way through eventually....."
,iPlunder,2012-12-29T05:39Z,"Don't hold your breath, it hasn't moved in a week and everyone is stuck at 51.6%.

Another deadbeat uploader - it's their only torrent."
,ziggyff,2013-01-01T10:28Z,Update:  week 3 and not one seeder with more than 51%...looks like a waste of time
