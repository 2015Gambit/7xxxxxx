,tarball8,2012-12-12T06:45Z,Corrupt or something.   Not watchable.
[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-12T06:48Z,"'Tis true.

Horrible glitch at 01:50

If nothing shows up to replace, I can fix the ""out of sync"" part, cool thing about AVI that.

[V],MP4SUX,2012-12-12T07:06Z,"Spoke prematurely. Can't subject people to a whole three seconds of silence (and then back .4) just to put it in sync. Just not worth the effort.

,Lardzor,2012-12-12T07:47Z,"If you skip past the glitch, and your media player allows you to (like MPC Media Player Classic), you can shift the audio 2500 milliseconds to correct the sync issue."
,trivkt,2012-12-12T08:01Z,"completely out of sync, could not watch"
,pragmato,2012-12-12T08:43Z,"thank you VTV!
if one uses KMP-Player do this after the glitch occured:
1. right click on the screen
2. go to playback | audio resync
3. hit +0,5s five times and +50ms twice
4. enjoy ;-)"
