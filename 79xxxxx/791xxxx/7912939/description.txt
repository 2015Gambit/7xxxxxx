Any album with Bill Evans I've gotta hear.  If pressed to pick a favorite


decade for jazz it would be the 50's, but who needs to.....we can have it all.


What's in short supply is the huge amount of time needed for listening.


To save some time, this is the LP configuration.  I've never had the time 


to compare alternate takes....I hope nobody minds.....but certainly somebody


does. 




Miles Davis wrote the tune NARDIS specifically for this recording date.

Using backwards names was trendy for a while...maybe Miles knew BEN SIDRAN.
