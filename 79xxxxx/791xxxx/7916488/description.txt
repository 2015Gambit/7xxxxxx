So, I frequently get pissed at publishers for not disseminating digital copies of the books held to the same standards as their physical copies, and, compelled by my OCD, I've started to fight back. 

Essentially I used the copy on TPB, which was substandard, ran it through Calibre, and fixed the results with Sigil. Here are the results. I can't guarantee spell check is going to be any better than the original, but at least the formatting errors have been fixed. Enjoy!
