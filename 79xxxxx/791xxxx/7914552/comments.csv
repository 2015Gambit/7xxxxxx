,RivertePireous,2012-12-13T02:50Z,"How do I reset my stats from this application? (Researched Items, Unlocked Characters, ETC.)

I've researched how to do it if Don't Starve plays from Chrome/Steam but this .exe doesn't. 

Any ideas anyone of how to reset the stats?
I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling it to no avail."
,donut1975,2012-12-13T03:45Z,THANK YOU!
,Delete_Repeat,2012-12-13T05:21Z,How do you transfer saves/xp from Nov to Dec update? or do you have to start from scratch?
,Havedog01,2012-12-13T05:41Z,it says error during initialization
,RivertePireous,2012-12-13T06:33Z,@Delete_Repeat Uninstalling then reinstalling this Dont_Starve_Beta_11Dec_setup.exe doesn't affect the in game stats at all. All profile/status information are saved else where. I do not know where exactly but I do know its not in the same folder as your installation's destination folder.
,yesterdays_pirate,2012-12-13T07:33Z,"@RivertePireous, here's how to do it. Got to:

C:UsersusernameAppDataLocalFLTSteam211670remote

I delete everything inside the ""remote"" folder. You'll be ok.

,yesterdays_pirate,2012-12-13T07:41Z,"@RivertePireous, I don't know what happed in my post above. Somehow the back slashes didn't register. Here's again:

C:UsersusernameAppDataLocalFLTSteam211670remote


If the back slashes don't register again, here's the structure, and you replaced them with the slashes:

C:*Users*username*AppData*Local*FLT*Steam*211670*remote"

,Kondemn,2012-12-14T05:59Z,"I can't change the display and my game colours are all messy.. I can't play the game..
Did anybody get the same problem?"
,groggery,2012-12-14T22:26Z,"Can someone finally explain why i can't play this in fullscreen? It goes black, i can click the menus and the music keeps going, but i can't play. This should be written on the torrent itself as it's a major issue."
,RivertePireous,2012-12-15T10:17Z,"@groggery 
I play on windowed and just maximize the window as much as possible.

No idea as to how to make that work. Suggestion, go into klei's forums (Don't Starve forums) and search there if you're irritated at being able to play a game that can't be fullscreened for FREE.

Goodluck."
