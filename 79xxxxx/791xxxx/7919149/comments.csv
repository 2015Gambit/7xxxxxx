,danwat1234,2012-12-14T04:36Z,is it the full ~6 hour concert?
,captainkerk,2012-12-14T16:33Z,What player will play this AVCHD-SC-SDH file? And do I have to decompress the MKV file first. I'm having trouble finding a converter that will handle this file.
,captainkerk,2012-12-14T17:31Z,"Nevermind. For those that don't know, like I didn't, get media player classic: http://download.cnet.com/Media-Player-Classic/3000-2139_4-10518778.html
and the codecs: http://www.free-codecs.com/K_Lite_Codec_Pack_download.htm and the codec update: http://www.codecguide.com/klcp_update.htm
and enjoy the concert.

Thanx TVTeam"
