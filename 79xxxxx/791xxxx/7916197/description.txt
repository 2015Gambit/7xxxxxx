James O'Barr returns to The Crow! In this special three-part tale, O'Barr and artist Jim Terry craft a harrowing tale set at a death camp in 1940s Germany, where a simple game of chess turns deadly, leading to the creation of a new Crow, giving new meaning to the term Gotterdammerung ('Death of the Gods')!
