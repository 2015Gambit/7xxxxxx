ReleaseNotes:

Though lambasted in some quarters as cynical clones of the then-vaunted "Seattle
sound" (in particular, Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam) STP's 1992 debut nonetheless
found a considerable following for its potent crunch and sly hooks. While some tracks do seem to ape the era's grunge ethos a bit too slavishly, there's also a sense that perhaps Weiland and company were merely sharing some of the same influences as their contemporaries--and on standouts like the riff-savvy "Sex Type Thing" and the moody acoustics of "Creep", accomplishing it with a bit more ambitious range. Indeed, the radio anthem "Crush" belies a devotion to songcraft disdained by many of their peers, one that served as an effective bridge between the stadium rock of the '70s and '80s and the more introspective alt-rock just then coming into vogue--even if the album's triple-platinum sales showed just how ironic and misplaced the "alternative" label could ultimately be. --Jerry McCulley
