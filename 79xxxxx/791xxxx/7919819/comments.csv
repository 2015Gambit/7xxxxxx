,crumrugin,2012-12-15T08:23Z,Well done doc (around WWII) not like the moronic shit on the history channel . It has a bias toward the status quo for America only litely touching on the corruption that was and is  rampant in the US ..also he seems to like Stalin considering how evil that turd really was and there is no mention of recent revelations of Hitler and Stalin's plans to carve up the world.. so basically nothing really shocking or new  ..too bad
,AlexLibman,2012-12-24T02:18Z,"Oliver Stone isn't a rational historian by any stretch of imagination.

 He completely fails to understand the context of the Cold War, and only reports on USA's violent and covert responses, which in reality constituted reasonable acts of self-defense against a far, FAR more violent and deceitful enemy.

 The Cold War was not merely a scuffle over geopolitical influence between USSR (the country of my birth) and USA (the country of my current citizenship)... It was an epic ideological struggle between a civilization that recognizes Individual Rights to a greater degree than any other -vs- a vile parasite (socialism, in all its forms) that cares nothing for Rights and would have subjugated humanity to a new dark age of backwardness and tyranny!

 This struggle continues today, as socialists perpetually collapse under the weight of their own dysfunctional ideas and contradictions, but, in their lust for power, continue inventing newer and newer schemes.

 Hitler and Stalin are long dead, but their torches have been passed to the likes of Mugabe, Chavez, and Jong-un. And, with a more Fabian / gradualist / inside-the-system approach, we have the likes of Hollande, Obama, and Al Gore...

 Goebbels and Bukharin are long dead, but their torch has been passed to a whole chorus of idiots in the socialist-dominated media, among them Oliver Stone."

I respect your background, but it does not make you objective."
,AlexLibman,2013-01-02T21:02Z,"I'm no ""disaffected Russian"", not by a long shot.  I came to USA when I was 10, without really understanding anything.  I was a left-wing idiot like everybody else after graduating high school.  Liked Clinton in the 90s, voted for Al Gore in 2000, and the Green Party in 2004.  Only in my mid-20s, gradually, my intellectual awakening had started..."

That taken into consideration Oliver's done a great job unwriting quite a bit of rewritten history in this series definitely worth watching, be it with the always required critical eye.."
