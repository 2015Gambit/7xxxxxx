,rugburn11,2012-12-23T17:24Z,"Users are advised to pay attention while installing this ad-supported application:

iLivid is safe, both Softpedia and Download com offer this program for download, so it doesn't contain malware but as Softpedia states... 

 Offers to change the homepage for web browsers installed in the system
 Offers to change the default search engine for web browsers installed in the system
 Offers to download or install software or components (iLivid Toolbar, Bandoo) that the program does not require to fully function

Still, there are better ways than installing iLivid for what you're trying to do."
