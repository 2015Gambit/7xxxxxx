What am I missing?
If I get this the whole thing dl'd I'll make it available for a very long time so ""c'mon, let's work together"" ;-)"

I'm sharing the 93.5% that I've got but we've got  0(17) seeds as of 18:00 AEST and it's been that way for a long time.
C'mon seeds help us out!
Thnx in advance."
