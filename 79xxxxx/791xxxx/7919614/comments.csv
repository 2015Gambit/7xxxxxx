Evil twin escaped that locked cage at the back of your mind and run rampant?

Something's wrong, but it's not the file. It's the version I watched for quality control and had no problem, else I would've seen it and fixed it before releasing.

Also, I'd like to think you'd have mentioned what the problem was that you're having.

Also also wik - I'd think someone else might have chimed in. Normally I require two similar complaints before investigating, but you're usually a trustworthy if a bit repititious.

I'm currently going back in time and your comments on later episodes mention nothing amiss. But since you got better, I'll assume a scratch in your mental record caused the ... ahem ... rant, rinse, repeat ...

Nevertheless, first bad review with your usual stellar review and I confess to being somewhat dashed and perplexed. I'm usually on medication, maybe you should try some too?

Glad you got better, a ""feedback loop"" can be devastating.
