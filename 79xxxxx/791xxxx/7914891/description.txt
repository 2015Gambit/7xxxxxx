Welcome To The 1980s

From the decade of big hair, excess and pastel suits comes the story of one man's rise to the top of the criminal pile. Building on the success of the groundbreaking Grand Theft Auto III in 2001, the release of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City one year later pushed the open world game series deeper into popular culture with a vibrant over-the-top take on Miami, a stunning celebrity voice cast and a loving, satirical look at the cultural excesses of the '80s.
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City expanded upon the open world gameplay of Grand Theft Auto III, combined with nostalgia for the 1980s to create one of the true high points in the marriage of interactive entertainment and mainstream popular culture, loved equally by hardcore gamers and casual players alike. The upcoming mobile version of Grand Theft Auto Vice City brings the full experience to mobile devices, featuring native high-resolution graphics and several enhancements unique to the iOS and Android platforms.

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City 10th Anniversary Edition HD is now available for PC from the torrent.
