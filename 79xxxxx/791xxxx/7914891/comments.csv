,ItsmeAJ,2012-12-13T05:47Z,"This is a real GTA Vice City installation file. But I'm not sure it's HD Edition

Just installed any play this for awhile, resolution settings is fine, no key, nothing else required,  just install then play.

PS : I haven't installed this game on my pc before so I'm not sure it's HD edition or not"

Dunno if it's really related to GTA SA but it's for 16:9 screen, and lots of cars are different, such as the infernus with scissor doors, so with my lacking knowledge I feel that it's legit.
Thanks man."
