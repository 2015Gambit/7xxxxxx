The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo 2012
The full 95-minute 2012 show from the Edinburgh Castle Esplanade on DVD, featuring incredible performances by international artists. The 2012 Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo draws together a host of creative talent from four continents to pay a sparkling tribute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee and Creative Scotland. The line-up of nearly 1000 performers includes hundreds of musicians, pipers, drummers, singers and dancers, as well as one of the most sensational percussion groups: Switzerland's Top Secret Drum Corps.
A strong Commonwealth contribution includes pipe bands and performers from Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand. Her Majesty The Queen's accession to the throne is the principal theme of this 62nd Tattoo and the climax of the evening is an orchestral re-enactment of Queen Elizabeth's Coronation of 1953.
The show concludes with an emotive haunting lament from the Lone Piper, high on the castle ramparts.
