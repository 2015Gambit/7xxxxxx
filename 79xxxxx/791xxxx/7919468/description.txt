About the Game

Wrap your way to bliss in Zen Bound 2, the unique down-tempo indie game! This is a different gaming experience: an opportunity to slow down, zone out and focus on a task that's challenging but not stressful, a set of gentle puzzles for the mind and fingers to solve.

The goal of the game is to paint wooden sculptures by wrapping them in rope - a task that may sound simple but has surprising complexity. Each of the levels presents a spatial puzzle that becomes obvious through inspection. Some levels feature paint bombs that are helpful in covering complex areas of the object.

Zen Bound 2 is a calm and meditative gameplay experience, with tactile, dusty visuals and a sublime, enveloping soundtrack by the sensational electronic artist 'Ghost Monkey'.
