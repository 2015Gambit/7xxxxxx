Dreams Come True is an all-star session by vocalists Marcia Ball, Lou Ann Barton and Angela Strehli. The three women sing with a band led by Dr. John and the session features guest appearances by such luminaries as David "Fathead" Newman and Jimmie Vaughan. The music is straight out of the Texas school of roadhouse R&B and blues boogie but it's delivered with a gritty, hearfelt edge, particularly on the part of the three vocalists. Dreams Come True may follow formula, but it's followed with style and affection, which makes it a very enjoyable listen.
