Atlantis - once a prosperous island nation, is now an undersea kingdom. The people however, face impending doom once again. The shield that protects them underwater is dangerously low on power, so the benevolent Queen has enlisted the help of beautiful mermaids. They are to search for Power Crystals, hidden in ancient underwater ruins, so that the shield continues to hold.
