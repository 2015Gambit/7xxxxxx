,BACK_KCAB,2012-12-13T21:56Z,isثَِ?
,Music_Is_My_Life,2012-12-13T23:08Z,"There is no swesub or any other international sub except for norsub.

The film is already out on DVD in Norway, but since it's coming out internationally worldwide in 2013, I'm guessing the directors didn't take the chance of other people from other countries getting to see the film before hand with subs. 
Kind of silly really, but that's just how it is."

,Music_Is_My_Life,2012-12-15T02:02Z,"I just searched online for english subs. There is english subs online, but they are just google translated. But mistakes are edited and corrected the uploader states. 
Not sure if the subs are good or not, but here it is: http://subtitlesbank.com/kon-tiki-english-srt-2328824/"

- Norska är iofs bland de värsta språk för en svenne till att haja ngt av.
Har själv hört värre i en källartrapp i Högdalen.
- Som en liten bonus ,är dessutom den engelskspråkiga dialogen översatt i ovanstående.
