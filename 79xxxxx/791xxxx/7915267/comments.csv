perfect sound quality! 10/10
the movie was really good!
I really liked the movie
it gets 8/10
but that's just my opinion of the film / movie
others may not like the film / movie
but it must at least be seen!
Thanks to the uploader many times!
and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
to me all along! :)
