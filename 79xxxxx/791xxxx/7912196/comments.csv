,BostonAl2012,2012-12-13T16:10Z,"What converter or encoder program do you use to make the files this small but still have so much Quality? Please help me! :) I would like to take allot of the Movies I have that are 700mb or higher, and especially my NFL and other sports who's files are 2-4.5gigs and reduce them, so that I can save more?

Once I learn to do this I will be able to seed more too~~~also I will upload what I make for others too~if I can figure out how to do that next~LOL. Please Anybody?

Grt UL TY!"
