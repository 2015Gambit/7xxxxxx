,Mikhel,2012-12-13T11:10Z,"Thanks a lot SCSA420. A question: will you upload the upcoming Rolling Stones concert of next saturday? the one with their 50th aniversary.

Thank you!!"
,Mikhel,2012-12-13T11:20Z,=) thanks
,gendrith,2012-12-13T12:25Z,"Wow that was fast!, Thanks a lot"
,a3ghost,2012-12-13T13:37Z,Please seed. THX.
,fuckyou579,2012-12-13T14:55Z,rump ranger SCSA got one right. Good work
,jfhjr,2012-12-13T14:59Z,"Thanks so much for upping this! Hopefully some more seeders will make it go faster, but at least I will have a chance to see it! It sucks to work nights sometimes. Thanks a million, again!"
,JakesterX,2012-12-13T19:13Z,"As of now, nobody even has a complete copy to seed... Be patient in the early going. It's 8.48 GB!! If any early DLer gets on here screaming for everyone to ""PLEASE SEED!!!"" they should be beaten.

Thanks for this UL, I missed it when it ran and forgot to set the DVR."
,nabillia,2012-12-13T21:25Z,why do i see over 350 available seeds but i  cant connect to a single one?
,couxxChronkilla420xx,2012-12-13T22:27Z,Thanks for the upload SCSA420. I will stay connected with my 50mbit service. I had set my dvr and the show went like an hour over so I missed last hour lol
,River-Rat,2012-12-13T22:33Z,same here no seeds
,Mikhel,2012-12-13T23:40Z,"everything fine here with me, i am halfway through and i began to download it as soon as SCSA420 uploaded it last night, though i am only connected to 8 seeds."
,pastevens,2012-12-14T00:09Z,"It's all green playing in VLC, there's no picture! The satellite box had a filter or something on it to keep it from being recorded. "
[T],SCSA420,2012-12-14T02:08Z,"WRONG!!! There is NOTHING wrong with it do you really think I would go to all the trouble of recording and capturing and uploading almost a 6 hour show that is 8.48 GB if there was something wrong with it? HELL NO!!! That would be a waste of my bandwidth to do that!!!

PLEASE READ BELOW:

To ensure that you can get proper playback be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below: 

http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm 

Once installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:

Media Player Classic, Power DVD, or Windows Media Player. 

VLC player doesn't play the MKV video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to 2 DVD -R  discs or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player and LG BP620 3D BluRay player does."
,jammerking,2012-12-14T10:16Z,"SCSA420 Thank you for the upload.
I was able to get this mkv to play in VLC  ver 2.0.4 Windows 7 ultimate 64bit

http://wiki.videolan.org/WindowsFAQ-2.0.x#H.264.2FMPEG-4_AVC_playback_is_too_slow_.28or_laggy.29

You can speed up the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC playback by disabling loop filter for H.264 decoding. To do this go to Tools -> Preferences and Input / Codecs and in the drop-down box for Skip H.264 in-loop deblocking filter change it to All. Remember to press Save to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.
Also if you have multicore CPU (or one with Intel Hyper-Threading), you can lower the FFMPEG thread count. To do this go to Tools -> Preferences (Show settings: All), then Input / Codecs -> Video codecs -> FFmpeg, then locate Threads, and set it to 4 (or to 2, or to 1). Remember to press Save to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

Maybe SCSA420 can include this in future upload descriptions depending successful comments.

Please comment if this works for you "
,fuckyou579,2012-12-14T14:58Z,Hey - lighten up folks. It is true that SCSA fucks up most of his torrents but he did not this time. He must have had a fight with his boyfriend because usually he is getting fucked up the ass and messing up his torrents.
,MakamotoES,2012-12-14T18:06Z,"With Quicktime Player 7  (https://support.apple.com/kb/dl923) and Perian (http://perian.org/) works fine in Mac.
There's no problem with the video or audio.

Thanks so much, this concert is great!"
,couxxChronkilla420xx,2012-12-14T20:16Z,Excellent! Playback thru usb on my Blu ray is perfect!
,dixie_normas,2012-12-15T03:03Z,A10-V10.....Good work.
,dixie_normas,2012-12-15T03:04Z,Kmplayer is the bomb....and free.  Plays everything
,pastevens,2012-12-15T06:25Z,"@SCSA420 -

my apologies; had I read your description more completely I would have seen that you already stated the problem w/VLC - after a few adjustments, I too am watching this great show as well. Thanks for all your efforts and I hope my previous comment didn't discourage anybody from d/l, the capture is great 10/10!"
,nawitch,2012-12-15T12:13Z,"thanks for download, will continue to seed high speed for the next few ...."
,john1974,2012-12-15T14:33Z,Video and sound in part 1 seems to be out of sync.
[T],SCSA420,2012-12-15T17:11Z,"NO its not outta sync here it plays perfectly here from either 2 DVD -R discs or you can copy both mkv files onto a 16 GB USB 3.0 flash drive and connect to the USB port on a LG, Samsung, or Panasonic, or Philips BluRay players and playback on your HDTV."
,mosesk,2012-12-16T03:07Z,mplayerx 1.0.17 works fine on mac for this
,Oblivilot,2012-12-16T22:31Z,"So, what settings can be adjusted to play this with VLC?"
,Ahsoka420,2012-12-17T12:57Z,Thanks SCSA420 for a great concert HD video :)
,gig1029,2012-12-26T13:51Z,"thank you for your time effort and bandwidth in getting this to us all 
"
