There is a war raging in India. A war whose     
end can't be seen.A war that isn't being waged  
by outsiders. The enemy is our own! The youth   
of the country are rebelling.. Against injustice
against tyranny, against exploitation.Inequality
will not be tolerated forever. There is anger,  
and there is deep social unrest. Our own        
countrymen are locked in the bloodiest          
armed mutiny this country has ever seen.        
Chakravyuh is the story of six extraordinary    
characters, each with an all-consuming dream..  
A promise.. A promise they will uphold above    
everything else.
