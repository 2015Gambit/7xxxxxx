PROLOGUE 
 
      
 
           For  the  last  few  years, this  life  IΓÇÖve  been  
living  has  been  a  constant   trial  after  trial. It  
seems  as  if  every time  I  get  past  one  obstacle, IΓÇÖm  
right  back  in  the  mist  of  another. I  guess  you  
could  say  that  I  was  just  another  youngster  on  a  
mission  striving  to  find  his  place  in  this  cruel  
world. 
          
During  the  mist  of  my  quest  I  was  
introduced  to  so  much  negativity, that  eventually, I  
was  pushed  in  the  vicious  hands  of  BabylonΓÇÖs  
modern  day  servants. Within  hours  I  went  from  
hearing  the  constant  irritable  sounds  of  gun  shots  
and  sirens  to  hearing  these  steel  doors  open  and  
close  every  hour  or  so. But  on  this  cold  day  in  
February, all  that  has  had  my  full  attention  will  be  
completely  out  of  my  sight.
