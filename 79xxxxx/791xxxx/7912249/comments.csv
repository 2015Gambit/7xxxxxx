,BostonAl2012,2012-12-11T18:51Z,"I'm still looking for wk #3 Pats/Ravens and wk #13 Pats/Fins in 540P, if you find it Nepotu.  TY for all u do!  What program would I use to convert it myself?  Preferably to make one of those small MB files I see some movies, but still have pretty good quality?  I like to save every game.  Right now I have them all on my PLEX server and can watch them on any PC in the house or TV w/Roku, it's pretty cool! But the High Rez, football don't play very well~old pc's but I play Madden 08 fine!  :)"
,BostonAl2012,2012-12-11T18:58Z,"Actually it now says 5 comments but I'm only seeing mine 1st one still?  Guess there's a lag in the Comments oops!  :)

So how do I convert? "

[V],Nepotu,2012-12-12T01:36Z,"Thank you all, my friends and you're welcome! My friend BostonAl2012 I'll help you with Pats-Dolphins in 540p in a couple of days. To convert the other file you have to google the net for a video coverter that will work on your PC and then you have to DL it from TPB."
