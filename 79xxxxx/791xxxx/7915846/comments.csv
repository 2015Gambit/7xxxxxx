,mooserocka,2012-12-16T23:24Z,This series has some good comedy in it. Im NOT a fan of anime comedy at all sometimes i just do NOT get jap humour. This is a littly funny though. So for a normal anime watcher it might be VERY funny. So i highly recommend it.

,mooserocka,2012-12-31T05:56Z,Im sure there will be more fairy tale it sold VERY well. Still no more CONAN very upset that there will NEVER be conan in us again. Which i want so bad. I refuse to watch subs so it sucks. I dunno if this anime has a season 2 but it makes us all want to be magical gumdrop girls.
