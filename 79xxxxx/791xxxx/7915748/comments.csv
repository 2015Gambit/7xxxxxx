,gotfw,2012-12-16T18:14Z,I'm sorry but the ones asking for a password are fucking stupid mp4 doesn't have a password 
,Mortenero,2012-12-16T20:45Z,"it's a zipped up file. 

the mp4 file is obviously within the zip

zip files can have a password.

for those who actually read the comments, which I obviously did not, which is why I found out it was a password protected ZIP file, just grab the one I linked to above, That works perfectly."
,AppGenius,2012-12-19T17:22Z,"Thank you for the download. The torrent works fine, I didn't encounter any password protected files, the episode is good quality with good audio quality as well. This is a good download of which I do recommend to anyone who likes this show. The next episode which is episode ten will be airing on the 16th of January 2013 next year."
,anemist,2012-12-28T01:46Z,"Well this is a mp4 file so no password ... not necessary  to get another torrent ...

I had two friend who had the same problem (taking any torrent that is not what they were asking for [zip, .exe files etc ...],whereas I could get it) same torrent, not same computer ...
they cleaned their internet browser completely and no more problem ... they could get the right torrent 

To good readers !!! you're welcome !!!"

,Realalist,2012-12-31T02:42Z,I love how convincing the trolls are nowadays. There is no password just the video file universally playable.
