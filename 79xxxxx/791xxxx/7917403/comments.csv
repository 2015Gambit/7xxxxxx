,SplhcbPrime,2012-12-17T14:24Z,"since u asked for comments...

I give u a, ""meh.""

there R some decent pix here, but only suitable for wallpaper AFTER resizing each and every pix u want to use; also, there r too many duplicates for my taste; and u r waayyy too heavy on the fantasy. (I saw very few sci-fi.)

I appreciate the ul, though."

Feel free to edit the collection further, this was trimmed down from an initial 16,000 pic collection. Also, I have no problems with wall paper, just point windows to the folder, shuffle, set to CENTER and you're good to go. As to the lack of sci/fi; that is not a reflection of my taste, but a reflection of whats out there. I was surprised to find a dearth of decent sci pic collections on the web. Fantasy pics are far more abundant. I guess there are only so many ways you can paint a spaceship on fire."
