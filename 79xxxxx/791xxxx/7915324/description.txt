"TRUTHS & DESTINIES," PART 2
Tom Judge's training as a priest did not prepare him for the horrors he's seen as a special investigator for the FBI. But Tom's current case - an unholy combination of the supernatural and murder most foul - is beyond anything he's ever experienced, and even the powerful Artifact he wields, the Rapture, won't be enough to save him.
