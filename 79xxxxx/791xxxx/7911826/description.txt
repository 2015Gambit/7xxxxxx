It took me 3 days to find this game and figure out how to play it
and for those of you who loved playing it as well, here it is! on a silver platter! ;)
RA1

Instructions:
1-Run 'Jambo Safari-Shortcut'
(if it dosent work try demul.exe)

2-agree (press 'OK') to everything

3-the game should start automatically in a few seconds

4-now configure the controller (check below) and enjoy


FAQ:
-Important: how to configure controllers?
1-go to 'Config' from top menu
2-choose 1st choice 'Game Pad'
3-@ 'Jamma' press on 'Joy 1':
assign the keys to: (and only to)
'Analog 1' (these r the movment buttons)
'coin'
'start'
4-press 'OK'
5-again @ 'Jamma' this time choose 'Joy 2':
@ 'Digital'
assign the keys to:
'Digital': 'up' (the cool key that pulls the robe)
           'Down' (throws the robe)

-how to increase the resloution? (bigger screen)
1-go to 'Config'
2-'Video'
3- change windowed resloution (1280x1024 should be fine)
(u wouldnt bielive how clear and crisp the game will look) ^^

-game is slow?
1-run demule.exe
2-'Config'
3-'Plugins'
4-change 'video plugin' to 'gpuOglv3'
(tried that on my laptop and the game became smooth)
