  Game information:
  =================

  XCOM: Enemy Unknown will place you in  control  of  a  secret  paramilitary
  organization called XCOM. As the XCOM commander, you will defend against  a
  terrifying  global  alien  invasion  by   managing   resources,   advancing
  technologies,  and  overseeing  combat  strategies  and   individual   unit
  tactics.


  The original XCOM is widely regarded as one of the  best  games  ever  made
  and has now been re-imagined by the  strategy  experts  at  Firaxis  Games.
  XCOM: Enemy Unknown will  expand  on  that  legacy  with  an  entirely  new
  invasion story, enemies and technologies to fight aliens and defend Earth.


  You will control the fate of  the  human  race  through  researching  alien
  technologies, creating and managing  a  fully  operational  base,  planning
  combat missions and controlling soldier movement in battle.
