'Cinema 4D' enables everyone from professionals to hobbyists to create stunning 3D animations. This book will walk you through all the steps of creating an interior flythrough of an office: creating a 3D structure, adding materials and lighting, animating, and rendering.

 Then, youll explore additional features through a series of mini projects: creating motion graphics, exporting a stylized non-realistic image, adding hair and creating cloth. Youll learn how to connect pieces that all work together by exploring node-based programming in Xpresso, then wrap everything up with an introduction to compositing in Adobe After Effects.
