[T],dhjudasx,2012-12-13T00:49Z,if anyone is wondering why there isn't like 30 screenshots like i've been doing... i've decided to try and keep the screenshots under 10 for each movie... It's incredibly time consuming to upload 15-20-40 images per movie....

This movie is disappointing, but thanks anyway !"

Echoing is a common problem for anyone that has a laptop/computer/stereo that attempts to ""simulate"" surround sound when playing back 5.1 ... If your using a stereo system that ""claims"" to be 5.1... but really is just stereo.... make certain to disable 5.1 audio mode when playing the 2nd stream.

I guarantee you that there is no echoing with either stream."
