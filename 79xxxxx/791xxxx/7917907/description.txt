Artist: BT
Title: If the Stars are Eternal So Are You & I/Morceau Subrosa (SPEC DTS 5.1 DVD by DKA) (SBU)
Release Date: 2012

This is a DTS 5.1 conversion created from the original Redbook CD source utilizing the SPEC method (ArcTan mode) as found on www.surroundbyus.com.

Only playable on home theater equipment and PC software capable of decoding a DTS signal. Otherwise, you will hear static.

Notes and disclaimers:

It is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.

If you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.

Two of BT's three 2012 releases converted with SPEC on one DVD here. The first is a bit more in line with his excellent "This Binary Universe" while the other crosses into deep ambient, almost even contemporary classical, territory. I've been quite BT-obsessed as of late and, while these aren't his biggest releases, I hope they find some homes.
