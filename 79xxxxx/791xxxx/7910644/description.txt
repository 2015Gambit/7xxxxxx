VideoMate Video & DVD Rental Software
VideoMate is an inexpensive but versatile software package for video and DVD rental stores. Used in more than 1,200 locations it is the most popular rental software on the market.

The program features an enhanced WebLink module which allows customers to browse your Web site and reserve movies online. (Please note that if you do not intend to use this module your store does not require an Internet connection.)

VideoMate has all the features of more expensive software packages, yet its user-friendliness ensures that your staff need little or no training to use it. A basic understanding of Windows is all that is required.

If you are currently using a spreadsheet or database program (such as Excel) we can probably convert your existing data files to VideoMate format.
