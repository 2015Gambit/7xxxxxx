After the passing away of her parents,         
Anita Kumar now lives with her paternal        
uncle, Kumar; his wife, Seema; and Seema's     
brother, Vikram. The family's business         
is taken over by Kumar, who uses some          
money to buy an old mansion deep in the        
countryside of Rana. Seema would like          
Anita to marry her brother, but Anita          
has already given her heart to Sunil,          
who runs a photo studio and is poor.           
This does not go over well with the Kumars,    
and they forbid her to see Sunil anymore.      
Then, when Kumar goes to take possession of    
the mansion, Anita's friends Shobha and Anand  
ask her if they can visit the mansion and also 
invite Sunil secretly. What the group does not 
know that is the mansion holds an evil secret.
