Usually EVOLVE steps in with a repack (fingers crossed).

AFG, Like MSD and myself are re-encoders. Damage at the source is an embarrassing problem. That's why I pre-screen certain troublesome eps by you-know-who.

Had re-encoded this, but a spot check turned up the problem immediately BEFORE uploading. I take pride in my work. Others should as well. C'mon, it's been weeks since my last rant ...
