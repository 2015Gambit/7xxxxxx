The brain triggers how one deals with sense.  It does not prove humans are animals, it proves science was in a stupor and human and animals are intelligent.  The obvious."

Scientist can be so stupid.  Frankenstein's maker comes to mind regarding experiments of these type.  Kinsey another freak paedophile raping babies to so called report if they are sexual by the noise they make.  And modern fraternity-science accredits this criminal."

Thought someone should actually comment on the torrent.

It's not for conspiracy believers like ewwwhiff though, who seem to think it's an 'everyday story of science folk'. In fact it's about rare exceptions, people who are madly driven, often by unscientific keenness, and are allowed or encouraged by government, which of course is the real problem.

Of course associations made and extinguished by food are 'obvious', that's easily re-discovered by our scientist here, without even acknowledging Pavlov! Our brain's implicit science - doing statistical calculations with the correlation - is arrogantly taken for granted, like medical science generally, and all the advances that make us safer and healthier, even if only by 'herd immunity'.

Needless to say the first commenter falls for every conspiracy theory going, including 'global warming is a hoax'. Never mind that similar theories about vaccines or cancer treatment have literally killed scores of people by unnecessarily deterring them from treatment they need. Let's hope the blog anti-scientist and his ilk watched the excellent episodes in this series that covered 'mesmerism' and 'N-rays'. 

Who knows? They may yet learn something..."
