I had reservations about such a small size for a drama, but I surprise myself.
I dedicate this to neeru, ostensibly of India for reminding me of small values.
.
Apologies if my "translation of a translation" is off - it's difficult to do.
Asian (Chinese?) speech, French subs and now my English ones.
Sorry for the delay, wouldn't want me to burn out completely, would we?

The text on the screen is in French - the dialog is in English

For the few lines in the show that need translating,
I've included a very small .srt file if you know how to use it.
It works for me (XP / MPC), your mileage may vary.
It can be opened as a text file if all else fails
Tells you what was said when.
