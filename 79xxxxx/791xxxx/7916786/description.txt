Brian Bendis is a funny writer and he has a great handle on the "little X-Men," especially their relationships with one another and as a contrast between who they have become as characters, friends, enemies, lovers and more in the future (er, present). Seeing them transported to the present has a high enjoyment factor, even beyond the "fish out of water" aspect, because you also have the secondary layer of their relationships with their future selves. It really all comes back to the chemistry that Bendis has found for these characters -- it's a remarkably innocent, undamaged, na√Øve and optimistic mix that's just good reading.

There are some minor things that don't work so well -- like how easily young Jean seems to accept and even joke about the fact that she's dead in the future. The panels in which the "little X-Men" learn (via television) what Cyclops has been up to lacks in the punch it deserves -- especially when it comes to young Scott's reaction. It's one thing for Beast to tell you you're a mass murderer, but it's a whole other thing to actually witness it. However, these are small complaints; on the whole the issue is beautiful and funny, heartfelt and intriguing.
