[T],GIANNIS511,2012-12-13T00:15Z,"Well It's a different story with different characters, so I think you won't have any problem. Before you start it though I think you should read the Avengers vs X-Men event."
,dwm015,2012-12-13T00:29Z,"Garbage. Worst scans Ive seen in a long time. GIANNIS511 is the MAN though, These scans just suck."
,angrychango,2012-12-13T00:44Z,What the hell with this scans? Tnhks but what the hell
,Silvak,2012-12-13T00:52Z,"Thanks GIANNIS511.  I have already read A vs X stuff.  

Uncanny X-Force run was before I had any interest in any X-Men books and only started reading it due to how great it's reviews were."
[T],GIANNIS511,2012-12-13T01:43Z,The scans were made by a group or a guy named Scanbro and to tell you the truth I didn't like them either. Unfortunately though I haven't seen any empire or digital scan. If I find any in the next few days maybe I'll upload it.
