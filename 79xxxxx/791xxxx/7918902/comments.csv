I'm uploading a fairly good clip to over twenty other leaches though. Don't treat this as a hit and run torrent! I don't get The Hub on my cable system. I was hoping just once to actually watch an episode on it's proper broadcast time Saturday!"
,cuteycindyhoney,2012-12-14T02:24Z,"Come on now! Fair is fair. Keep seeding! We're down to two seeds, with eighty-four leechers trying to get in on it. The torrent has been up for over 24 hours. We should have a dozen or more seeds by now! Don't bail out when it completes! Give the other guys a chance! "
,cuteycindyhoney,2012-12-14T10:39Z,"Now that's more like it! I guess the initial seeder's internet was slow or something! Every leecher seems to have completed at once, and things completely turned around! Now we have 85 seeds for everypony's convenience! Thanks Loltpily! Keep seeding though, guys! ""Yay"" (in Fluttershy's voice) I'll finally get to watch an episode on it's actual broadcast day and time! I usually have to wait until Sunday to grab a download. "
