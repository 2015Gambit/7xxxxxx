Dave Brubeck('s)(1920-2012)early musical endeavors included an OCTET-

several members of which recorded this reunion album in 1957.


Like the Octet recordings, there is little mention of THIS very interesting

record in the discography.  Similarly overlooked is Tenorist/Arranger

Dave Van Kriedt who contributed in no small way to the future success

of both Brubeck and Desmond. 


Brubeck endured a type of racism and ongoing critical analysis of his unusual

(sometimes termed "third stream") music.  "Experts," even other musicians

wasted much time deciding whether Dave's music was legitimate "jazz," or

some other more established EURO form or a freakish hybrid of both.


The time would have been better spent actually LISTENING to the music.
