,thriftstoretalent,2012-12-13T05:52Z,"in VLC, click ""Tools"" tab, click ""Track syncronization"". adjust the audio track accordingly. if you dont use VLC, get it. its the only media player worth having."
,penfold22,2012-12-13T16:10Z,"You can do the same thing in Media Player Classic - Home Cinema, another fantastic player that I prefer to VLC. Just use the + and - keys. A delay of +1700ms did it for me."

,penfold22,2012-12-14T02:56Z,"""imdb says
Language:
English | Georgian | Spanish so do we need english subs then to understand georgian and spanish bits ?????""

I believe the only Spanish was when the main characters were conjugating verbs for practice, no useful dialogue. And I don't think the viewer is meant to understand the Georgian since the main characters don't understand it. You get the gist of what's being said from the tone and body language."

,72194123,2012-12-14T16:33Z,this needs subs. most of the movie is not in english.
,theshape31,2012-12-14T17:29Z,"Have confidence when downloading this.  In order to fix the audio and video...

-Use VLC Player.
-Set Audio Delay to: 1750ms
-Set Aspect Ratio to: 16:10

The Georgian language parts are meant for the main characters (and audience) not to understand what's being said.  There is very few lines of Spanish, but nothing integral to any plot points.  Most of the movie is in English, and everything that happens is easy to understand.

Don't listen to the people complaining.  They were either too lazy to fix the simple audio/video issue, or did not bother trying to watch more than the first couple of minutes."
,jh31415,2012-12-15T01:24Z,"Thanks for the suggestions to use VLC, but until a version is released that runs on my TV, I think I'll pass."
,IndigoAK,2012-12-15T21:44Z,"VLC's decoding and UI sucks.  Sure, it can read every file in existence, but it does so with piss poor quality.  And the UI is atrocious.  It's ugly, poorly laid out, and poorly explains pretty much every option available.  There are much better alternatives."
