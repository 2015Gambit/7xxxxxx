Afghanistan: A Military History From Alexander The Great To The Fall Of The Taliban
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The only complete single-volume military history of Afghanistan, from ancient times to the war waged by the United States after September 11.Following the events of September 11, 2001, the world was riveted as American military power contested the legendary warrior culture of Afghanistan.
By spring 2002, America began to draw down its forces, its mission accomplished: The Afghan Taliban regime has been overthrown and the terrorists it harbored were on the run. Was America's easy victory proof of its military superiority, or were the Afghans merely eyeing the newcomers as they have watched foreign armies in centuries past, knowing time is on their side.
For over 2,500 years, the forbidding territory of Afghanistan has served as a vital crossroads - not just for armies but for clashes between civilizations--the Greeks, Arabs, Mongols, and Tartars, and in more recent times, Britain and Russia.
