And the ARES software, created exclusively for the development of printed circuit boards.
The Proteus is a powerful low-cost EDA package offering facilities for schematic drawing, SPICE simulation, and PCB layout. The simulation module includes cossimulaĂ§ĂŁo PIC16F84 microcontroller and a range of interactive models peripherals including LCD screens, keyboards and matrix RS232 terminals.
Developed for design of printed circuit boards and electronic design, the Proteus consists of the ISIS (for schematic capture, SPICE simulation and simulation PIC microcontroller family, with voltmeter, oscilloscope and function generator) and ARES (which serves to create layouts of printed circuit boards)."
