Denny Doherty - Watcha Gonna Do (1971) mp3 v0 {MCA Japan 2002}

The first of two solo albums from The Mamas and The Papas' lead vocalist.
The album's original title was to be 'Alone At Last' and the cover image of
Doherty sat in a rusty bathtub in the middle of a field is a clever nod to
the Mamas and Papas' debut album sleeve. It's a similarly laid-back album,
with a rambling pace and low-key delivery. Some of the tracks sound like
studio jams but it all adds to the overall charm. This Japanese issue is
the only official CD release for this album.

Review from AMG:
Denny Doherty, the voice of numerous Mamas & Papas hits was one of the greatest 
and most underrated lead vocalists of the rock era. This, his fist solo album, 
has numerous charms. The record has a loose, party-in -the-studio feel, and much 
of that adds to the overall effect of this slightly country-oriented platter. 
Tracks such as "Gathering of the Words" and "Don't You Be Fooled" are quite 
remarkable, and show Doherty to be a sensitive artist in the singer-songwriter 
vein. A remake of ""Got a Feelin'" features Doherty's world class talent as a 
vocalist as well. The album's closer, a medley of "Here Comes the Sun" and "Two 
of Us" ends the record in grand style, with Jimmy Haskall's exquisite string 
arrangement taking the listener into a wonderful and warm place.
