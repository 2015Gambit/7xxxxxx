For those too young to remember, "The Adventures Of Buckaroo Banzai Across The Eighth Dimension!" was one of the leading cult hit sci-fi genre B-movies of the 1980's.  The film starred Peter Weller as good scientist/Renaissance Man Buckeroo Banzai, who led his merry band of eclectic sidekicks called "The Hong Kong Cavaliers" in a movie adventure to save the world from the alien reptile race the Red Lectroids.  The movie featured several well-known 1980's-era actors including John Lithgow, Jeff Goldblum and Ellen Barkin.

The man, the marvel, the human achievement, is back! From the cult movie starring Peter Weller, John Lithgow, Ellen Barkin, and Jeff Goldblum!  Your favorite neurosurgeon/rock star/adventurer returns, along with his Hong Kong Cavaliers, in: TEARS of a CLONE!...where a DeathΓÇÖs Head tank squad lurks in suburbia, talking bouncer-robots attack, expensive love wants to erupt, and Lectroids run with scissors, and thenΓÇª shotguns! The world may never be the same.
