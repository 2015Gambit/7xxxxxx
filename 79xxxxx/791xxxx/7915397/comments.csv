,Mr_Heisenberg,2012-12-13T21:20Z,"Wow audio is complete shit once again, you will be changing the volume level every ten seconds. Deleting this torrent, thanks for your work anyways."

,dragonballz,2012-12-14T07:34Z,"So, is the audio really corrupted?"
,Mindblown,2012-12-14T19:24Z,"The thing with YIFY torrent is that they are portable. Perfect for the iPad / iPhone whatever. The image is good, however the audio is 2 ch. So you should know what you are getting."
,thankyo,2012-12-15T00:13Z,Thank you YIFY. Audio sound level for me has been consistent the entire movie. Nice job.
,punx_roxer,2012-12-15T09:01Z,Thanks again YIFY! for another fantastic HD Rip!
,tetnem,2012-12-16T19:47Z,thanks!
,Chrono.d,2012-12-17T05:34Z,is it possible to play this movie with subtitles on my PS3? i tried to transfer a movie to a USB key and play it on PS3 but it doesn't see the subtitles like on VLC. Thank you for your help.
,smabir,2012-12-17T09:00Z,Great Movue man!!!
,Ekomaira,2012-12-17T10:40Z,"@Chrono.d you will need to burn this movie, i recommend ConvertXtoDVD. add the movie and the .srt file and burn

this is a pain to watch on the PS3 though because it is cinavia protected"
,Chrono.d,2012-12-18T04:37Z,"Ekomaira, thanks for your answer. Without burning, with USB key would it be possible on Xbox 360 then?"
,Ekomaira,2012-12-18T08:52Z,"@Chrono.d no don't think so, i don't own a 360 so i could be wrong though, not sure :/ sorry mate, burning is probably your best bet to watch with subs on PS3/XBox"
,pirateYoho,2012-12-19T02:23Z,"When are one of these super smart and fantastic rippers like YIFY or someone going to find out how to get rid of this cinivia crap!!!! ??  PLEASE

P.S. YifY - you are amazing!"

,Ekomaira,2012-12-24T03:44Z,"you're trippin' nelofa29 mate, there has been no bagging of YIFY on this torrent? you crazy man"
,rshkhsee,2012-12-24T04:08Z,"Oh, thanks ""Mindblown"". I thought these were all still mkv files, i dont even look anymore WD boxes play about anything but now i know i can just throw these .mp4 shows raw onto my ipod too! YIFY: Gold to > Platinum!"
,Slobodancovek,2012-12-25T12:54Z,"YIFY, like in probably all your movie uploads, the audio is terrible. It fluctuates between insanely loud to barely hearable."

,jwwdubb,2012-12-27T11:38Z,YIFY first one I have seen with Cinavia. I have a lot of your stuff. Watch in multiple rooms so yes one room is sometimes watched on PS3.
,marceloif,2012-12-27T15:14Z,"Why upload something that has a shity audio? damn! Created my account here on PB just to say it... dont download this shit, its impossible to hear the movie!

A=10, V=10, M=8."
,MiMi_D,2013-01-01T06:55Z,DAMN YOU CINAVIA!!
,ShaveIce,2013-01-06T09:32Z,Not sure what the audio complaints are except maybe the Cinavia thing just makes it quiet on some players?  I have to change the date on my ps3 and then its fine *shrugs*
,donkrieg,2013-01-07T14:39Z,thanks YIFY!
,quickrush,2013-01-07T15:42Z,"CINAVIA is annoying but can't complain when the movie cost nothing.
