This is my 169th official 720p H264 AVCHD-SC-SDH release. Enjoy the show music fans. 

This 720p release is in MKV format with Dolby Digital Stereo audio and is playable with Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player, and any other devices capable of playing 720p HD .mkv video files.

To ensure that you can get proper playback be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below:

Once installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:

Media Player Classic, Power DVD, or Windows Media Player. 

VLC player doesnt play the MKV video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to a DVD +R DL  disc or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player and LG BP620 3D BluRay player does.

Enjoy Roger Waters 12-12-12 The Concert For Sandy Relief music fans and thanks for downloading my Roger Waters 12-12-12 The Concert For Sandy Relief 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH release.
