An excellent and nostalgic trip though Avengers past, with stories by Eaglehart and beautiful artwork by Sal Buscema.

While centering around the enigmatic character of Mantis, there are numerous pearls in this collection such as the origin of the Vision (and his relationship to a certain fiery android from the Golden Age,) as well as origin tales of Moondragon and Mantis. The collection also includes the death of a certain sword-wielding Avenger.

The story lines wander and converge, yet in the end all come together in an issue including the weddings of not one, but two Avenger's couples. Numerous villains appear, the central being Kang which of course means lots of cosmic time travelling tales.

All in all, an excellent and enjoyable collection for and Avengers' fan.

NOTE:  These are not my scans.  All praise and glory to the original scanners (and authors/artists/publishers,) please.
	
Enjoy, and please seed.
