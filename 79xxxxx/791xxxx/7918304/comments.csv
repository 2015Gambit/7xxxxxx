On a side note, I always thought that since Kang came from a future timeline, he would be more mellow to backfires and setbacks, not mouthing off like he did in one of the earlier issues of this pack!"

I've noticed that most comic authors will usually depict the villain (from any timeline) as not just a little bit insane.  methinks its their insatiable appetite to rule the world/universe/microverse that warps their judgment."
