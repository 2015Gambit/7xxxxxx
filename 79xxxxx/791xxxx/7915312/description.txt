There's a revolution underway in South America, but most of the world 
doesn't know it. Oliver Stone sets out on a road trip across five countries 
to explore the social and political movements as well as the mainstream 
media's misperception of South America while interviewing seven of its 
elected presidents. In casual conversations with Presidents Hugo Chavez 
(Venezuela), Evo Morales (Bolivia), Lula da Silva (Brazil), Cristina 
Kirchner (Argentina), as well as her husband and ex-President Nestor 
Kirchner, Fernando Lugo (Paraguay), Rafael Correa (Ecuador), and Raul 
Castro (Cuba), Stone gains unprecedented access and sheds new light upon 
the exciting transformations in the region.
