Abnormal Psychology, 11th Edition Ebook

Thirty years after its original publication, Abnormal Psychology enters its 11th edition, continuing the tradition of giving students the opportunity to explore the latest theories and research in the field.  The authors, distinguished scholars and leaders in the field of Psychology, continue to emphasize recent and comprehensive research coverage that has been the hallmark of the text.  While the writing across all the chapters has been streamlined to increase the clarity of presentation and to highlight the key issues in the field, several chapters have been expounded upon to provide greater understanding of the material provided. Abnormal Psychology 11th Edition emphasizes an integrated approach, showing how psychopathology is best understood by considering multiple perspectives, and how these varying perspectives can provide us with the clearest accounting of the causes of these disorders as well as the best possible treatments.  A new, powerful videos series for your Abnormal Psychology course:  Created for this 11th edition, John Wiley & Sons offers a series of 7-10 minute video clips to show in class or for student to review outside of class to help understand the patients experience. Unlike other videos, these feature patients and their families, in the context of their lives, describing symptoms from their own perspective. Each video provides concise infomation about the available treatment options.
