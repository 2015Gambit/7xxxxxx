Zendee Rose Tenerefe, who became famous as the "random girl" who was recorded on video belting out in a mall, launches her first single "Runaway" under Warner Music Philippines.

The video, which became viral on YouTube and was shared many times in social networking sites, caught the attention of TV host Ellen DeGeneres and invited her to "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" last October, making her U.S. television debut.
