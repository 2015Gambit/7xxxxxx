PetManager

PetManager is an inexpensive Windows based software package for pet salons. It is very simple to use; your staff will require no special training, just a basic understanding of Windows.

Fundamental to the program is an appointments diary for each of your staff members. Simply click on an empty slot to make an appointment for a client. Or click on existing appointments to modify their details or read the appointment notes. 

Although PetManager is PC based you can integrate it with your Web site so that clients can make appointments online. If you do not intend to use this feature you do not need Internet access at your salon.
