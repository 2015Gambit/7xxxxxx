"The Last Christmas"

Like the Mayans, Virginia is convinced that 
the world is going to end on December 21, 
2012, so she uses her extreme couponing 
skills to stock up on supplies and forces 
the family to train for the apocalypse. 
Meanwhile, Jimmy is determined to give Hope 
the best Christmas he can, since it will 
likely be the first one she remembers and 
Maw Maw tries to knock a few more items off 
her bucket list before the end of the 
world.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
