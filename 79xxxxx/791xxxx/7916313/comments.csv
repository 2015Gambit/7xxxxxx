,tarball8,2012-12-13T07:13Z,"Video freaks out 1 or 2 minutes in, two days in a row?

That's not a codec problem, that is somebody intentionally tampering somewhere."

,Dannation,2012-12-13T08:12Z,"@gb4idie Good call, except I think 2650 is the sweet spot. This is disappointing for the second day in a row, but still, VTV is da best!"
,tarball8,2012-12-13T08:15Z,"+1 for the VLC tip.   Hit ""K"" until you're around 2700ms delay."

,wizzhop,2012-12-14T04:24Z,"TERRIBLE QUALITY!!!! I EXPECT BETTER FROM YOU VTV....

Audio goes out of sync around 2:30, audio is also mixed VERY low, i had to max out my volume to be able to hear anything."
,freddy213809,2012-12-15T00:12Z,VTV has 2 bad uploads in 2 days. Why don't you spend 30 seconds ensuring you're uploading a quality product? You're wasting everyone's time...
,gotbrains69,2012-12-15T04:06Z,"thanks for the VTV tag:
now i'll know to avoid your daily show uploads.
seriously, let the big boys do it if you don't
understand how."
