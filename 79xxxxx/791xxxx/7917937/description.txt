Nigella Lawson enjoys the run-up to Christmas and prepares her Christmas
 larder in advance. Cooking at Christmas is a wonderful piece of slow-down
 therapy but that doesn't mean that you have to be tied to the stove the entire
 time. Getting ahead and filling the freezer can be the answer to a Christmas prayer.

  After mixing a lychee martini, Nigella cooks roast pumpkin and sweet potato 
soup with a Stilton swirl, mincemeat pies and her Star from the East, plus a
lamb and date tagine - all wonderful to eat straight away or to store in the 
freezer for the arrival of last-minute guests. And if they have any room left,
Nigella's 'girdle buster' pie more than lives up to its reputation.
