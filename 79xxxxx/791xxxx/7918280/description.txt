Call Of Duty Black OPS II BLES01717 update 1.04 with trophies working.
Only tested on 3.55 but it should be ok on 3.41.


INSTALL NOTES :
* install my new fix 1.04
* Launch the game with multiman (bd mirror)
* When you have the menu to choose the game mode ("online" or "offline"), you can press PS3 button to return to XMB and go to trophy section to see the COD Black OPS II trophies installed. Press PS3 button to return to the game.
* Then play game to see that trophies are 100% working
