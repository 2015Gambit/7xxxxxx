The first choice for ultra-hard Complextro and Dub Styles is back! Once again, this Sample Pack delivers 40 dancefloor destroying construction kits that will hammer the dust out of your membranes! As usual, all 40 kits consist of numerous single loops for drum and synthesizer tracks, including Kicks, Hihats, Percussions, Bassline, and Melody, (often in 2 versions, with and without sidechain), for more flexibility when mixing. BPM and pitch information, clear folder structures and sample accurate cut files are all included. Characteristic for "Dirty Electro" and "Complextro" are the many different hard bassline fragments which can be played consecutively. This style is rocking clubs worldwide! This is fresh ammunition that will put you right at the forefront. A "must have" for every serious electro producer!
