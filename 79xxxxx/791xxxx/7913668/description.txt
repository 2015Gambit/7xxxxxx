For whatever reason the audio stream for this iTunes episode had parts that were completely missing, which threw everything out of sync. A ninja Pony has spliced in audio with a TV rip to fill in the gaps.
it's good enough until an episode with proper audio is ever released.
There is only one audio track 

These are direct rips from I tunes, that means no ad's. They are not colour corrected.
