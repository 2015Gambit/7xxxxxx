3x06 -- Manimal (Dec/10/2012)

Science has made major breakthroughs in drug research and transplant technology by experimenting on “chimeras” – human/animal embryo hybrids. But these seemingly noble goals may be covering up a much more nefarious purpose – to create half human, half ape super soldiers, paving the way for a real life Planet of the Apes showdown. Jesse and his team storm the Yerkes Primate Research Center, hidden in the backwoods of Georgia, to find out the truth about “humanzees” – who may already be walking the earth!"

I think hes great.. and his views espc in that C2Cam interview was spot on :) (see the ufo bundle I did months back I added it in it)"
