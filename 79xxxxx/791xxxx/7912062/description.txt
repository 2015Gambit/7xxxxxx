 
 
'One is not born, but rather becomes, woman'. 
 
 
First published in Paris in 1949, "The Second Sex" by Simone de Beavoir was a groundbreaking, risque book that became a 

runaway success. 
 
 
 
Selling 20,000 copies in its first week, the book earned its author both notoriety and admiration. 
 
 
Since then, "The Second Sex" has been translated into forty languages and has become a landmark in the history of feminism. 

Required reading for anyone who believes in the equality of the sexes, the central messages of "The Second Sex" are as 

important today as they were for the housewives of the forties. 
 
Newly translated and unabridged in English for the first time, Simone de BeauvoirΓÇÖs masterwork is a powerful analysis of 

the Western notion of ΓÇ£woman,ΓÇ¥ and a groundbreaking exploration of inequality and otherness.  
 
 
 
This long-awaited new edition reinstates significant portions of the original French text that were cut in the first 

English translation. Vital and groundbreaking, BeauvoirΓÇÖs pioneering and impressive text remains as pertinent today as it 

was sixty years ago, and will continue to provoke and inspire generations of men and women to come.
