I suggest you to make new google account for this tool..If you Dont want to take any chance with your main gmail account.
Once you create new gmail account add that account in to your device and select that account in google play in your phone.and download any free app..By doing this your device will be added to your new gmail account and now you can switch back to your old account in your phone..
