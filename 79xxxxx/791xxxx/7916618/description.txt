Do we know what poverty is? Throughout human existence, the poor have always 
been with us. Beginning with the Neolithic age, Ben Lewis's funny and sinister 
animated odyssey takes us through the changing image of poverty - helping us 
define what poverty looks like today and question whether it is inevitable. 

A BBC Storyville film, produced in partnership with the Open University, Poor 
Us screens as part of Why Poverty? - when the BBC, in conjunction with more 
than 70 broadcasters around the world, hosts a debate about contemporary 
poverty. The global cross-media event sees the same eight films screened in 180 
countries to explore why, in the 21st Century, a billion people still live in 
poverty.
