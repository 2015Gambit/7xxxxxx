I SEED EVERY MOVIE I DOWNLOAD BUT THIS ONE IS NOT WORTHY.

Dont waste your time on this one folks...worst movie of the year literally. Whoever plays the daughter in this is a horrific actress, she ruined the whole movie and made Elizabeth Shue look terrible. Bad plot and worse script. "
,hackermafia,2012-12-13T21:28Z,"what a crap movie, this is why people pirate movies because i would be furious if i wasted a dime on this one. yes the daughter is a poor quality actress i feel bad for elisabeth shue if i ever see that girl who played her daughter in another movie i will refuse to watch it 8 people in my house are furious about this crap film we had to delete it off the computer before we even seen the ending. just simply wow someone could make a plot this bad 2 thumbs down
