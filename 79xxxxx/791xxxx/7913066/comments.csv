,evilkumquat,2012-12-16T18:05Z,"No huge defects like the last one. No blurring. No weird angles. All text and images are clear. It's obvious the scanner sacrificed his book (you can see a few tears at the edges) to make sure each page was flat when scanned.

A few minor ghost images from the back side on a few pages. Overall, the whole thing could have benefited from some Photoshop enhancements.

Overall, I'd give it a 7/10 for what's probably the scanner's first attempt at anything like this.

The usual guys haven't given us anything, so it's likely this will be the best copy we're ever going to see.

Anyone else want to give their take?"
