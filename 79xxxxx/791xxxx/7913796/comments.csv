,cityboy609,2012-12-14T03:34Z,"Hopefully someone has the time to answer. I've used cracks,etc before but this one has me retarded. copy the file to android/data? Where is that? I have Nexus 7, should i connect via usb and search the tablet for that directory? Thats what i am gonna try but any advice will be appreciated."
,DeanMasta,2012-12-14T11:43Z,"Cant play this on My Android :(
Need a high end device to play this game :D"
,DeanMasta,2012-12-14T11:45Z,cityboy609 I think it means copy the folder to your sd card in Android/data folder...
,Zivkr,2012-12-14T13:35Z,Works on Galaxy S III ICS but with lags... but that probably is a problem with the game...
,Decker-Bens,2012-12-15T03:52Z,"Hm-m, I havent any detailed shadows on my SGS2 like in trailers, cant believe that this phone doesnt support it. Another developer's idiotic way to force people buy the newest devices.
But very qualitatively and smooth release, thanx a lot to you, HobbitGamez."
,geoff777,2012-12-15T09:25Z,"Hi, I've tried to install a few larger Android games on my tablet.
With no luck.

I just get a loading arrow and an apkmedia.com message.

The tablet is new running jellybean.

Any ideas I've followed instruction exactly.

Thanks."
