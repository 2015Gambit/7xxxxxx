https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7900559/"
,operator0,2012-12-13T05:36Z,"""XAPK file validation failed"" on launch.

SD data from 1.0 is in place in sdcardAndroidobbcom.rockstargames.gtavc

The APK from 1.0 from the mentioned torrent plays fine.

Any ideas?"

[H],shirepirate,2012-12-13T15:41Z,"even though it is exactly the same file, try renaming main.7.com.rockstargames.gtavc.obb
to main.11.com.rockstargames.gtavc.obb
the folder name does not change"
,operator0,2012-12-13T18:27Z,"Awesome, thanks! Will try it when I get home.

How did you determine the correct folder name? I'm brand new to Android and trying to learn. Thanks!"
,operator0,2012-12-13T19:55Z,".obb file name, not folder name :J"
,operator0,2012-12-14T02:59Z,Renaming the resource file did the trick. Thank you!

,operator0,2012-12-14T20:59Z,Freezing when getting into a car on SII's is a widely reported issue on google play. I see they have already put up version 1.02 to address this.
,entityown,2012-12-14T21:18Z,"yeah, i saw the new version and downloaded the apk, its still freezing. thanks for your reply. "
