  The award-winning action RPG is back, bigger and better than ever! 
  Torchlight II takes you back into the quirky, fast-paced world of 
  bloodthirsty monsters, bountiful treasures, and sinister secrets - and, once
  again, the fate of the world is in your hands!

  Torchlight II captures all the flavor and excitement of the original game -
  while expanding the world and adding the features players wanted most, 
  including online and LAN co-op multiplayer. Torchlight II is fast, fun, 
  and filled to the brim with action and loot. Adventure solo or online with 
  your friends!

  Key Features:
  Multiplayer - Play co-op with your friends via LAN or over the Internet for
  free. No subscriptions, no item sales. Our new matchmaking service lets you 
  find friends, start new games, and join existing games. And, as always, you 
  can play single-player offline as well.

  Customizable Characters - Players will create and customize a character from
  one of four brand new classes. Each class can be played as either male or 
  female, with customized cosmetic features and looks to make each individual 
  character stand out. All new skills and loot give loads of opportunity for 
  unique character builds.

  Moddability - TorchED, the Torchlight II editor, will give players the 
  ability to create their own mods, adding even more content to the world. 
  Have your friends download the same mod and play together. TorchED will be 
  available as a separate download very shortly after launch.

  New User Interface - Torchlight II boasts a new and improved user interface, 
  designed to be easier than ever for new players to pick up and play. This 
  intuitive interface ensures you can focus on playing the game the way you 
  want to.

  Open World - We're not only in the town of Torchlight anymore! Explore vast 
  overland areas and multiple hub towns, fight through rain, snow, day and 
  night. Our level randomization ensures new layouts, paths, loot, and 
  monsters every time you play.

  New Game Plus - In New Game Plus, the game's not over until you say it is. 
  Once you've beaten Torchlight II's primary campaign, you can start again 
  with the same character for a significantly greater challenge. You'll keep 
  all of the skills, gold, and gear you worked so hard for!
  Pets & Fishing - These popular features make their return in Torchlight II 
  in improved form. More choices, better effects, and your pet will still 
  make the run to town to sell your loot so you don't have to.

,Lobuno,2012-12-13T19:34Z,"    Patch 1.20.2.3

    Released December 12, 2012
    Stability

        Fixed a crash related to removing gems from items in multiplayer if they had been equipped.
        Fixed a separate multiplayer socketing related crash. Both of these fixes should resolve most of the 'in-town' crashes some players have experienced, as the events triggered can crash other clients.

    Gameplay

        Fist weapons (and a few other innately enhanced items) can no longer make your attacks so fast that they are invisible with max attack-speed bonuses.

    Languages

        German is now available to all users.
        Polish translation updates.
        Russian translation updates. "
