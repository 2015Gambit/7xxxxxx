Some ambitious fellow somewhere out there, as I write, wants $700.00 for an

original issue of this LP.  It's a good LP.  It's Fruscella's best recorded

work but that's not saying much because the poor guy self destructed before

doing much else.


After I heard track #6 His Master's Voice...I bought the "COMPLETE WORKS"

(see pic) thinking that I was in for a real treat.  SURPRISE!!    Apart from

this album the rest is mediocre at best IMO.  To make matters even worse

(I hate wasting money) the sound quality of the "COMPLETE WORKS" is truly

awful.  


It was so bad that by comparison my vinyl rip is HI-FI



Don't buy the rest....this is as good as it gets Fruscella-wise
