Hi! This is a port of the Suave Icons for Go Launcher Ex. So, beside many applications icons created by me, all credits should go to Thyraz and pat974! (http://macthemes.net/forum/viewtopic...d=16804800&p=1)
This package contains more than 750 application icon replacement and it's in continuous development!
To use this theme you'll need Go Launcher Ex or Apex Launcher installed.
This is a twin project of the LauncherPro/ADW one but since activities structure are different from Go Launcher not all icons may work. So, if you find some problem feel free to report and I'll be happy to fix them. Enjoy!
If you find bugs or have suggestions, DO NOT post them as comments. I can't reply to those.
So, if you have problem, request etc please email me or use the XDA thread (http://forum.xda-developers.com/show...0#post16756270).
Using comments is useless and low rating doesn't help.
Note 2: This pack includes many icons (more than 500)...so if you are trying to select your own icon please wait a while and if it force close retry one more time...
