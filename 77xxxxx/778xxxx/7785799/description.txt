.........when one locked horns with Sonny Stitt (1924-82), one had to be armed

to the teeth with licks.  Booker Ervin (1930-70), whose tenor cry was among the

most urgent sounds of the post-to-free-bop era, was, solely on the basis of that

sound, more than equal to the task of jamming with Stitt. (not my words)


The common denominator of the (3) sessions revisited herein is Hammond player

Don Patterson who has the unfortunate habit of "pumping" his right foot on the

expression/volume pedal.  This produces volume fluctuations of the organ sound

(including all the Bass lines) which I find annoying.  Nonetheless, this album

is worth your time to check out, if you enjoy saxophone "battles." (my words)



Stitt was probably over-recorded (exploited with his permission) but these sets  

are good IMO
