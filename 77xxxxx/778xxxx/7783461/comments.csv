,Dakota85,2012-11-03T05:38Z,"YAY glad i'm not losing my mind lol. Btw i'm in QLD so its pretty awesome to know you're in SA. Is there any way you can upload on a different site or webpage in the meantime? Also, thank you for uploading the version with the opening credits etc, I know it's only a small thing, but it really adds to the effect - makes me feel like i'm watching it for real properly and not just a download :) so cheers for that!
