For centuries, parents have captivated their children with enchanting tales of faraway, magical lands. In one famous story, a wolf uses cunning and deception to try to eat the innocent Red Riding Hood. In the end, he did not live happily ever after... Now the wolf has returned and Red Riding Hood is once again in danger - but this is no fairytale! Instead, a modern day maniac has kidnapped a woman's fiance and cast her in the role of Red Riding Hood in his twisted fantasy. Guide the resourceful young lady as she tracks the wolf through a cemetery, a shabby motel and a dilapidated casino, searching for clues and solving the puzzles that lie between her and her beloved. Will she reach the madman in time, or will the wolf have his revenge? Their fate is in your hands!
