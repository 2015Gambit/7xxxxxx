If it's not much trouble, could you post a x264 in MP4 video extension, please?

Thank you."
,edvinasb,2012-11-03T16:19Z,I was not able to find English subtitles but I found Dutch. I used Google Translate to translate it and it seems to be quite good :) Contact me on twitter @edvinasbartkus and I will send it to you.

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 238 seed,(im never having a go at the uploader ! ) if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent /bittorent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please gogle it then copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out , ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc also copy & paste this comment onto a Word document or Openoffice (which is free) & spread the message we must get more people to help out , theres too many hit & runners who never comment or add links etc"
