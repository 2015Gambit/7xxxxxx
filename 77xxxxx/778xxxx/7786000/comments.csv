,htlywho,2012-11-03T06:31Z,can u upload star wars - clone wars 1080p
,dhjudasx,2012-11-03T16:07Z,Isn't clone wars specifically a Series? I'm still waiting on casino Royale for someone here at TPB and numerous others from other websites that have made movie requests.
,dhjudasx,2012-11-03T16:09Z,"I would also LIKE TO let people know that my uploading will be potentially sevearly hindered as my home internet connection went down last night, (this is why it took much much longer to upload/seed than usual). Sorry boys and girls, i'm just one person with 2 extremely slow 58KB/s internet connections..."

,Upman,2012-11-20T11:13Z,Is this the original version or the digitally remastered one? I'm thinking the latter from that Jabba screenshot I saw.
,dhjudasx,2012-11-20T17:13Z,"being that it is the bluray..... far as i know there are no ""Original"" versions in bluray format... they are all the same."
,Upman,2012-11-20T23:33Z,"Ah, that's right, I forgot - I looked for it a few years ago and came to that answer. We're stuck with crappy quality originals; a giant middle-finger to the fans.
Thank you for answering and reminding me! And now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go drown my sorrows in some Twi'lek liquor."
