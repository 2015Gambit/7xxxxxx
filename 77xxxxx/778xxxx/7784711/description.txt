The Autobrake system controls the deceleration in dependence of 
different conditions at the braking phase. The braking phase itself 
starts by touchdown of the A/C.  
A corresponding important factor is the weather condition and the 
RWY quality that follows,  
e.g. Rain or Snow, which will prolong the braking distance extremely. 
But not only braking distance, as well is the ΓÇ£feelingΓÇ¥ of a slippery 
RWY important for a realistic simulation at landing.
Up to now this important system doesnΓÇÖt have enough attention and 
didnΓÇÖt realize nearly a bit realistic. 
But this missing system we now give our attention and putting into 
action as realistic as needed.
ΓÇ£Down they come allΓÇ£ is not enough in our thoughts.
