Ironic how they are depending on so many of the 47% they despise to get them elected.  Sad how many of those 47% think that the two of them are on their side.  Mostly it's because they don't want a Negro in the White House. "

If you were to actually READ the reporting you would see that what was suppressed by the GOP were gov't reports about terrorism, charter schools and tax cuts not helping the economy of generating more revenue.

But then expecting a right-winger to read and/or understand anything is a wasted effort to begin with.

Good upload......"
