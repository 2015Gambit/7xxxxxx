Updated edition to include the release of their fifth studio album "The Resistance" and their 2009/2010 world tour. The author interviewed the band about their childhood for this book. It features thousands of words of exclusive, previously unprinted interview transcripts taken between 1998 and 2007. From a Battle of the Bands contest in Teignmouth to the first band ever to sell out the new Wembley Stadium, the story of Muse's stratospheric rise is one of UK rock's most fascinating and incendiary tales. It includes detailed accounts of all five of their studio albums from "Showbiz" to "The Resistance". This biography follows their every step from 16 year old punk kids to Wembley Stadium, all their albums and their wild nights, theories and falsettos they experienced along the way.
