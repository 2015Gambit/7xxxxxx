Gold.Rush.S03E02.Enhanced.MQTVRip.xvid-][ The Wrong Claim ][ 03-Nov-2012 ] avi


I converted unpopulars mp4 tvrip to xvid 360p mp3 cbr 128 1000BR

its no HD but I did some tweaks on it.. I tweaked the colors and sharpness

you can improve the sharpness even more by using vlc real time sharpener
filter and slide the knob to find the sweet spot
its turns vhs and tv videosfrom blur to clear pixels but vlcs sharpen boosts
the brightness of whites which can see in the eyes of faces of people


sadly the source ripper slightly over cropped it.. trimmed the top and bottom
logos too much by 4 pixels but just makes the logos look a little silly
I dont think the main picture has lost pixels

take it or leave it.. but i suspect a hstv ver will show up in 6 to 12 hours


Enjoy and HELP to seed will be slow until other torrents seed out
so lets hope no hit and runs


Cheers
