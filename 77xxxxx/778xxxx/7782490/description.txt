Description:

End Times Scenario - 2012

Many people are becoming increasingly conscious that we are entering a unique phase of human history. Some are terrified. Some are predicting cosmic doom on the near horizon. Others are making astonishing predictions. What does the Bible really say?

Eschatology (the Study of ΓÇ£Last ThingsΓÇ¥) is among the most challenging avenues of study, even for the most sophisticated.

   -What are the ΓÇ£realΓÇ¥ End Time events?
   -What is the most preposterous doctrine in Christianity?
   -Does the Church go through the Great Tribulation?
   -Which Kingdom do we pray for in the LordΓÇÖs Prayer?
   -Is there really a ΓÇ£Battle of ArmageddonΓÇ¥? Why?
   -What Scripture did Jesus deliberately leave out in Nazareth?
   -Who is the ΓÇ£AntiChristΓÇ¥? Is he alive today?
   -Should we expect a literal Babylon on the horizon?



Seed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long.

This is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.


JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
