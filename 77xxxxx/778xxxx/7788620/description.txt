The penguins must save the world from Dr. Blowhole, the game's villain, and imminent dolphin domination. Dr. Blowhole and his lobster minions have come up with a new plan to take over the world, and it's up to Team Penguin to stop him. The game requires players to solve puzzles, build contraptions, navigate hazards, and rescue others from the zoo including Maurice, Mort, and Marlene. For example, players use Skipper to help assemble the team, while Kowalski builds devices like the Picture Bridge, Trampoline Shirt, Rocket Jet, Drill Barrel & Invulnerable Penguin Suit and Private squeezes through tight spaces. Designed as a single-player game for all ages, players can use the Wii uDraw GameTablet and stylus pen to draw and color characters, as well as to solve strategy games and do other things like walk slide & activate switches to fool their robo villains and Dr. Blowhole himself.
