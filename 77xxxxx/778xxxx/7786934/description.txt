Here area all the Metagaming Microgames, most of the Meta-History games, and some extra content that I made myself. I've included a lot of Ogre specials: the Battlesuit rulebook, some GEV/Shockwave and Ogre meta-maps, counters, miniature rulebooks, plus more. I've also included an icosahedral projection of the earth that I made into an Air Eaters mapboard (much more geographically accurate than the original), and a Player Sheet I created for Rivets (just laminated it and use dry erase markers to keep track of your information.)

For more fun, there's the The Air Eaters Strike Back metagame.
