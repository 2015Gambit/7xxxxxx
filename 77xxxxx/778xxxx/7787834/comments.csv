,anonwood,2012-11-03T21:19Z,hey yify!! why don't you ever mention the information about audio? there's nothing to feel ashamed of it!!!!!!!!!!
[V],YIFY,2012-11-04T16:01Z,"ashamed ? umm we dont mentioned audio because it doesnt vary what so ever (unlike the rest of the video details which do vary)
all our encodes are AAC 2CH. 
and no we do not plan on doing 5.1 :)"
,indiaman,2012-11-07T17:41Z,When I play the movie.I see two screens or should I say a single screen but in two parts and playing the same movie side by side on both parts.Could you please tell me why this is so and how do I correct it.
,StellarGirl77,2012-11-08T02:31Z,Split video. Very annoying.
,phat_71,2012-11-08T08:14Z,"Wow..so apparently nobody knows how to read. Do yourselves a favor and look at the torrent name...I mean seriously people, basic reading comprehension was covered in grade 1, this shouldn't be a problem anymore."
,rajputbay,2012-11-09T14:51Z,"This is SBS i.e. side by side version,  only meant for 3D TVs or 3D ready monitors....Don't download SBS versions if u do not have 3D compatible monitors/TVs.."
,ponzumomo,2012-11-15T07:17Z,"Hi Yify,

After  i combined SBS screen with my 3d tv, seems the subtitle not in the right position, i don't know if i do it wrong tho, and i use VLC to watch it. any suggestion ?

Thank you"
