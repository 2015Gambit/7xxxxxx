THIS ISN'T THE GAME, THIS IS AN INSTALLER THAT YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE 5 STEPS INCLUDING A SURVEY AND DOWNLOADING ANOTHER GAME AND YOU MUST RATE 5 STARS TO EVEN GET YOUR GAME. DON'T WASTE YOU TIME PEOPLE. AND I ONLY WISH THAT SOMEONE HAD PUT A WARNING ON IT BEFORE I PUT IT ON MY PHONE AND GOT SPAM ALL OVER IT. I say FUCK you sir"
