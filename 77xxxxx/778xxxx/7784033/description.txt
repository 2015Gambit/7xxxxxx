A Scandinavian supergroup of sorts, The Godforgottens met for this recording
session in 2006 and pianist Sten Sandell happened to spot a Hammond B3 organ in
the corner. Having never played one before, he instantly shaped the direction
and feel of this performance out of this spontaneous decision to have a go at
it. The three musicians joining SandellΓÇötrumpeter Magnus Broo, bassist Johan
Berthling and drummer Paal Nilssen-LoveΓÇöhave all collaborated on various
projects in the past. This combination might be the first, hopefully, of many
for The Godforgottens.

The three lengthy tracksΓÇöbetween ten and twenty minutesΓÇöcrystallize from the B3,
but not as the work of an American jazz/blues organ band. The sound might best
be described as the imaginary meeting of Sun Ra and Miles Davis, circa
1974. The opening "Always Forgotten," begins with a placid organ wash,
providing an equable current of energy under the unwrinkled tone of Broo's
trumpet. With the entrance of Berthling's bowed bass and Nilssen-Love's
percussion wash, The Godforgottens create a soundscape in which some very
intimate improvisations can be built...
