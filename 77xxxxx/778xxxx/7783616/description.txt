'The Fairly Incomplete and Rather Badly Illustrated Monty Python Songbook'

Harper Perennial, 1995, 96 pages

Designed by Gary Marsh

Illustrated by Terry Gilliam, Gary Marsh, John Hurst

Music edited by John Du Prez

Written by The Pythons, one would imagine

It's Monty Python songs, with "sheet music", "illustrations" (that look like they're from 1995 - early computer stuff) and "playing instructions".
