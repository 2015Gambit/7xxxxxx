Hi All,

This is an upload of links to software which is widely used

Have you ever formatted a PC and have to look for software which is used all the time or frequently?

This torrent is your solution then.

I included the links to the official sites of some freeware software.

Software:

Adobe Downloads (All of Adobe Downloads)

Antivirus - AVG & Microsoft Security Essentials

Browsers - Apple Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer

DVDs & CDs Virtualizers - Daemon Tools & SlySoft Virtual Clone Drive

Java

Media Players - Apple iTunes, Microsoft Zune, VLC

Winrar

Open Office

Microsoft SilverLight

Skype for Windows

Windows Essentials (Windows Live)

Astra - Drivers Identifier Software)

All the software is Freeware (there are Pro Versions of some which are shareware)


The reason I included Links only is that in this way, the latest versions of the software is always included, and if there are 32bit & 64 bit versions of a software, one can download the most compatible, efficient  and/or compatible version. The only Software which is included in this torrent is Astra, which identifies the Drivers of a computer (if the Network/WiFi Driver isn't installed, there's no access to the internet).

Of course there are other software solutions on the Web, but these are the ones which I use the most, it's not my intention to offend others with my opinion.

Thanks, and keep seeding, Sharing is Caring.
