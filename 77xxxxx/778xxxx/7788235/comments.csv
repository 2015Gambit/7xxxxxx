___________________________________________
ERROR in
action number 1
of Create Event
for object objDevolver:

Error defining an external function.

Any idea why? 

I'm running Windows 8, and I want to pull the trigger and buy this game already, but I can't unless I know that it works well on Windows 8 Pro first. 

Thanks in advance."
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-11-03T16:04Z,Dont know but it works well on win 7 64bit.
,Captain_Planet,2012-11-12T16:28Z,"Of course it will work on Windows 8... If it doesn't then you just run it under compatibility mode for any other windows ever made (almost). That only takes a second.

Haven't downloaded yet, but thanks in advance."
,Captain_Planet,2012-11-13T00:04Z,"Just a note of confirmation for you oneneo: it works perfectly on Windows 8 without having to run it with compatibility mode. 

I ran the original installer then copied these files over. Quick and easy.

Fun game! Will buy it later on."
