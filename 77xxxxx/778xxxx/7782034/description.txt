Full Hyper-V VHD image, I started with "hack's" empty VHD image and filled it in.


The OS in this VHD image comes pre-charged (25), It's fully setup and ready to Host.


VHD image was taken from Windows Server 2012 Standard


Hyper-V VHD image OS: Windows 8 Enterprise x86 (VOLUME_KMS_W8 channel)


Setup:

1. Import VHD (restore image using existing ID)

2. Choose Network adapter for KMS_Host VHD under "Settings"

3. Start KMS_Host VHD set Time Zone inside OS.


Thank's goes to "hack" for making this possible.
