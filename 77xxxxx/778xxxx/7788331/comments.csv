[T],esharoth,2012-11-04T10:42Z,It doesn't even show any error messages? For me it's working fine on Windows 7 x64 Home Premium.

,Leignheart,2012-11-05T12:17Z,"its strange, its completely the hd part, because regular version works just fine, but if I install this or download the hd patch and install that to the regular it just crashes, I cant solve it."
,Leignheart,2012-11-18T17:47Z,"I got a fix for people, if it crashes at startup, lower your resolution. I had to lower the resolution from x1600 to 1200. hope it helps anyone."
