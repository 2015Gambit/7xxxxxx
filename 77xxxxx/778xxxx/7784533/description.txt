Argentinean Miguel Cantilo joined a hippie commune in the fall of 1972. There he wrote many songs together with Kubero Diaz (La Cofradia de la Flor Solar), incredible hard- psychedelia and a slight folk flavour at times. This is an absolute must for any psychedelic rock fan with overwhelming dual guitar, and no doubt it's one of the best Argentinian records of the 70's. This is its first vinyl reissue ever and the sound has been taken from original Mastertapes resulting a much better sound than the original!!! It's limited to 500 copies and comes with the gorgeous original gatefold cover.
