,brianxxx,2012-11-02T17:47Z,"I have wondered about this program too. I have noticed that when the nitro_pro8_x64.exe is scanned by a few different antivirus programs it shows 2 files were scanned. Normally, when an .exe file is scanned it will be seen as just 1 file. When scanned, this file is quarantined. Also, if install is attempted it gets a positive hit. Same for the x86 version of this program. 

A clean trial downloaded directly from NITRO scans as 1 file and is not flagged under my tests. 

This is not a flame or slam against iahq76 - this is just meant for info purposes. Make of it as you will. Also, I have had these same results from other upload from other P2P sites. Last time, with version 8.0.4.6 this occurred as well and the ones that scanned as 1 file were clean."
