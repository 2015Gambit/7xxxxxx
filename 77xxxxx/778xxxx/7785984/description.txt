Sometimes The Best Advice Is Your Own!

Natasha Nice and  Giovanni Francisco star in this romantic comedy that is as charming as  it is unpredictable. Jack (Giovanni), a somewhat jaded advice columnist,  has absolutely no problem dishing out words of wisdom for his  romantically challenged readers; while Abby (Natasha), his  ex-girlfriend, still lives with him. But when this awkward living  arrangement turns into a complicated relationship crisis, will Jack be  able to follow his own words of wisdom or will he ultimately lose Abby  to another guy?
