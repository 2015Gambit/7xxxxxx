,adam1bay,2012-11-02T11:57Z,"hi ettv, 
thanks for the great work, i have not watched this download yet, but your previous uploads are great!, I am sure this will be the same, 
i am new to here, can someone please clarify to me the seed/ leechers in more detail, I know that seeding is keeping my system open for people to dowload too, but how does that help the process etc.... I am not technical in computers but would like some explanation in english terms (not too technical!) thanks a lot..."

I use bit torrent, and I see the download speed/upload speed vary from 10kps to 250kps (I understand my connection speed has an effect) but how is the torrent speed is affected by the number of seeders/leechers etc...
I am not technical in computers but would like some explanation in english terms (not too technical!) thanks a lot..."
,adam1bay,2012-11-02T12:04Z,"hi, Other question I have: does the size also affect the download speed? I download two Law and Order seasons 7 & 8 and each took aprox 2 days to download as the speed reached around 30kps? Any pointers on how to max the download speed?  I appreciate if anyone can answer...."
