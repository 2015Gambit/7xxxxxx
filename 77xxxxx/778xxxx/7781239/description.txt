This is an extensive compilation of background music to be played during RPG sessions. They were taken from movies, console/PC games and TV series soundtracks. All of them are separated in different file folders by mood; mood definitions in brazilian portuguese first (since Im from Brazil), english definitions in parentesis. All files are in MP3 format with variable quality. 

I started downloading and sorting out soundtracks back in 2005 following a suggestion I saw in a website to help DMing and creating a ambience for the scenes. It was called "The RPG Sound Project", but the website is no longer online. 

I hope you all like it! :)



P.S.: I do not have any legal property over the files. This is for personal use only, they are not to be broadcasted and/or selled. All rigths over the sound files reserved belong to its composers and publishers.
