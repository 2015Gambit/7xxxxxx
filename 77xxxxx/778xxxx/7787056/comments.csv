,papayrus1,2012-11-03T10:48Z,LOL Yeah Legens where is the bluray rip wtf and why did we have to wait so long for this movie gosh. LOL Just kidding I am making fun of the cry baby and the noob. Hey we should make a movie called The Cry Baby and the Noob.
,Gros_Shadok,2012-11-03T10:50Z,"I've started to download and, according to what I can see :
- this is really skyfall
- the quality is watchable (although blurry)
BUT
The video is only 1 hour long... SO IT'S NOT THE FULL MOVIE, only 1/2 of it !"
,papayrus1,2012-11-03T10:50Z,Hey LowOrbit I see you got some uploads where's your 720P skyfall? I don't see it there why?
,Gros_Shadok,2012-11-03T11:51Z,"Ok I must correct what I've said... my preview was saying 1 hour long but now it says 1h36 so that was because the download was not finished.
So, this is the real thing !"
,hotslized,2012-11-03T21:17Z,tsk tsk... moviehackers desperately seeking attention.here's one!
,pitvok,2012-11-04T02:28Z,V3 S6 hardly watchable
,musclestud1,2012-11-04T02:42Z,"damn, it's the shits!"
,hispeed86,2012-11-04T14:49Z,people have been doing CAMs for years but it seems like no one has ever remembered to turn off auto-focus...
,smokie_tonto_420,2012-11-06T01:29Z,"I wish people would stop putting that spam bullshit... ""I found a better version here..."". STFU with that shit... If its better, then put it up. Other then that...those sites are total bullshit. Makes you sign up for shit. I wish we could kick them off if we see those stupid ass comments"
,soletar,2012-11-07T05:04Z,"First film I would ever dream  of downloading a CAM copy. Am such a 007 addict…
Eon productions, Sony pictures..i solemnly pledge to buy a bluray of this film, the rest of the pirates, I can not vouch for… can someone tell me when the BluRay is likely to be released? July? Hope I would be alive till then..Thanks uploader!! "
,kapikapi,2012-11-08T15:26Z,"What a great 007 movie! A lot of shocking scenes!
Video 3
Audio 4
Quality sucked but i have found a better copy on film.offibackup.com worked well for me! "
,devnakshi,2012-11-09T08:19Z,Gets black at 1:19:10 and resumes at 1:24:00 where there is a crucial scene.
,Johnnydingo,2012-11-09T09:11Z,"hey LowOrbit .....they're not dumps you've been looking at mate, it's a bloody mirror you're looking into ass-clown...... LegendET is a good uploader, you're just what you squat down to do....."
,miko777,2012-11-09T17:56Z,"Audio 2-6 (sometimes inaudible sometimes very clear)
Video 0-5 (sometimes blurred out, some entire black sequences no visual at all) sometimes half decent.
I would wait for a better copy, it ruins the fun."
,roufsau,2012-11-11T17:40Z,I heard that this is a really great movie..i was searching for better quality and i found it at film.hifihd.com so i will watch it tonight. can't wait :)
,svalley,2012-11-13T18:37Z,"@roufsau

Ooops roufsau:-): seems that the site you are recommending wants your credit card details...

TPB never does that, and never will... It will always be FREE...:-) "
,aronno789,2012-11-13T20:42Z,"i loved it, full of action scenes which will blow your mind. quality kinda sucked so i found out about seedfilm.rebelgarage.com which has much better one. enjoy!"
