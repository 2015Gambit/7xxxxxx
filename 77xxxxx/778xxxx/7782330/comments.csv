[T],Gh0stNet,2012-11-01T21:53Z,Scene group FANiSO released the indie action game “Cargo Commander” which was released today on Steam. I’d suggest visiting the game’s homepage and check out the trailers because it looks like that there’s some fun to have here with this.
,SithisXVII,2012-11-01T22:27Z,I looked at a few videos of the game play and it looked like one of them games you just hit up and go with when you feel like doing something. Definitely going to give it a go. Thanks for the upload.

,silentrob421,2012-11-03T02:16Z,"Cool game and it seems to work... I noticed I can't really find a way to change my name in the game, and any progress I make is not saved. Anybody else having saving issues?"
,BuliwyfZRage,2012-11-05T12:04Z,"Its actually not worth downloading the Game, since you cant play it online, you only can play the same Sector over and over again.
Or anyone got a fix for that?"
,silentrob421,2012-11-05T21:34Z,"I'm pretty sure I was able to play online. As far as playing to same sector over and over, just get a sector pass (green cargo container) and head to your navigator after you end the day. I do like this game, but it's not worth playing unless you buy it, or someone comes out with a crack that lets you save the game."
,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2012-11-27T10:32Z,"my game does save. i just played again after a few weeks and i was rank 4. also connects online but i cant change my name

anyone know how to change name?
or where the saves are located?

also..any update? steam version is now at 1.7 i think"
,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2012-11-27T10:57Z,svaes are definitely somewhere outside of the installation folder. i reinstalled the game and i was rank 4
