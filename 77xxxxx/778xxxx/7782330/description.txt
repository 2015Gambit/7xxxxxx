Alone in space, light years away from your family, armed with only your
Fistcannon, Platform Drill and the meanest cup of coffee in the sector;
you are Cargo Corps' latest recruit, a Cargo Commander

Your responsibilities are simple: travel through the vast reaches of
wormhole-filled space salvaging priceless cargo from alien infested
containers. The work, however, is hard, honest, and hairy:punch and shoot
deadly mutants in the face, while traveling between your ship and
containers. Jockey for promotions with thousands of other Cargo Commanders
in the galaxy, collect over 80 different cargo types, all the while
earning your way back home
