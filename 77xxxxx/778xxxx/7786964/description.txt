Sweet Poison - David Gillespie.pdf
Why sugar makes us fat?

David Gillespie has worked a storm up with this book. An interesting read indeed...
He states that fat doesn't make us fat but sugar makes us fat.
Fructose a type of sugar is bad for us....
I knew artificial sugar was bad, but fructose is in normal fruit right?
