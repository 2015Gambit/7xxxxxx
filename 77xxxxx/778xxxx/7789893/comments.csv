[T],bill_214,2012-11-04T02:35Z,"Well, twwtwwtww, if you had sense enough to be able to find your own ass with both hands you'd know that according to Minor vs Happersett (1875 US Supreme court) Obama's birth certificate doesn't mean diddly (even though it is valid and he was certainly born in Hawaii).

According to the ruling (the case was actually about women's suffrage):

Men that are US citizens that have children born off US soil confer US citizenship to their children by virtue of themselves being US citizens,

and

Women have the same rights of US citizenship as men, and thus confer US citizenship to their children wherever they may be born just as men that are US citizens do,

SO

Even IF President Obama wasn't born on US Soil (although he was) he would still be a ""natural born US citizen"" simply because his mother was a US citizen from Kansas... just the same as John McCain is a US citizen even though he was born in Panama.

The rest of you comment is idiotic too, which probably has something to do with why the GOP is celebrating stupidity, lack of education, and a lack of critical thinking skills. "

[T],bill_214,2012-11-04T02:55Z,"Here's another link to the same ruling:

http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=88&invol=162

I should also point out for you dumbasses that can't read that the decision does NOT say that both parents have to be citizens to confer citizenship, but rather that a man's children are US citizens wherever they may be born and that a woman has the same rights as a man in pretty much everything except voting (which was overruled in a later case in that woman gained the right to vote which one can argue they always had although it was denied them)...


...and furthermore that if a man had simply DECLARED his INTENTION to become a US citizen and died before he could finalize it his (or by extension, her) children were automatically US citizens at birth.

The plethora of links saying otherwise proves that most right-wing dumbasses simply can't understand what they try to read."
[T],bill_214,2012-11-04T03:09Z,"Yeah Kalusa, because it's not like Mitt ""Chickenshit"" Romney didn't dodge the draft while supporting dumb wars, or that Bush wasn't AWOL for-fuckin- ever.

You guys never have an argument which is why you have to make up bullshit and then try to steal elections when that doesn't work."
,drdoodoo,2012-11-04T09:03Z,"This is all irrelevant. In 2 days, the worst president in the history of the USA will be voted out of office. We're talking about a man, so bad at being a president, he makes GW Bush look like Einstein. Everything he touched turned to shit leading America to fall lower than it ever has. 2012 = ABO = ANYBODY But obummer and his opalogies."
,twwtwwtww,2012-11-04T15:04Z,"Oh. must have hit too close for Dill, er I mean Bill. Keep drinking the Kool Aid while America is destroyed. Typical Lib asshole, great at spending everyone else's money. Obama's a loser and you a bigger one. And if I want to find my ass, I just feel for your head, please shave, your whiskers are scratching my anus."
