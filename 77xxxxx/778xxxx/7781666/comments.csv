,gnufella,2012-11-01T19:26Z,"hi nilesh,

i'd like to use this on a new laptop that has win7 home basic pre-installed.

1. can i choose the partition to install, so that dual-boot is achieved without losing orginal bundled os?

2. till when has this been updated?

many thanks in advance."
,gnufella,2012-11-01T19:37Z,"> only language on winsxs removal is done
does this mean this is english only? en-us?"
,nileshtambe,2012-11-01T20:26Z,"@gnufella

iso made from msdn refresh media 7 sp1
no update are integrated"

,nileshtambe,2012-11-02T00:53Z,"@gnufella
yeah sure "

thanks, pal."
,Addryann,2012-11-02T13:13Z,Thanks for the new release. Windows update works on this? (Not for the updates as much as for drivers). Can we expect a x86 release? Thanks.
,nileshtambe,2012-11-02T14:20Z,"@gnufella 
u r welcome

@Addryann
if u want i will make 32 bit, this i made 1 month back
tested for 1 month and released
use this and let me know anything u want to add modify in x86

updates r not possible because it requires  winsxs full folder of 4-5 gb which we generally remove"
,Addryann,2012-11-02T16:10Z,"nileshtambe, I am unable to test this release, maybe on some friend's pc or something, my laptop is pretty old with 1 GB of RAM. Maybe when I'l make an upgrade, that's 4,5,6 years from now lol."
,ohmatthew,2012-11-05T03:37Z,"hey nil, would i be able to use a repair cd to install a more complete windows 7 over this? so i could keep my data if i wanted to upgrade to a complete windows 7. thanks so much for your uploads, it's helped me out a lot"
,cabrapst786,2012-11-05T06:15Z,"Nil I could say that you nailed it, but you are still perfecting it.
THANK YOU!!
I was using the older ie9 version, and it was kinda rough at some points.
I think that that is what windows should be like, just the enough amount, ahahhaha.
Tell me something, last time when I put portuguesebrazil language in vistalizator, it worked, but somehow, I couldnt acces any proporties in the files, region and language, and other contexts menus, I clicked but I got nothing all the time.
Do you think it`ll be the same with this one?
I have already installed anyway, used the other for more than a week."
,Addryann,2012-11-05T08:18Z,"@cabrapst786

That's a trick, I know it, I've been there. Aply what language you want with Vistalizator, then do a restart, not just a logoff, after that go to control panel and regional settings, under admnistrative tab change to your desired language and restart again. After that, you'll be able to acces your settings normaly."
,nEducado2323,2012-11-05T15:00Z,How old are u 20-25 right? YOUR WINDOWS are the best dude you rock !!
,run3,2012-11-05T18:01Z,"Thanks! But can't you make a version like v9, but without the reg tweaks? Removing the clutter like firewell, IE, games, UAC et.c. That would be great!"
,yet1016,2012-11-06T08:42Z,"nileshtambe, pls. make 32 bit. tnx in advance.."
,cabrapst786,2012-11-06T23:13Z,"@Addryann

That didn't worked, because I can't acces the region panel, I click but nothing happens.
I even tried going back to english, and doing everything by the region panel, assigned everything as portugues-brazilian, in the administrator too, even in the copy settings link above, and restarted it, but I got the same problem as before, so it didn't change a thing."
,RinTosaka,2012-11-07T00:04Z,"If this is vanilla Win7 minus the languages, then it's not really a ""lite"" version no?  If anything wouldn't this be more like your ""full"" versions, just without the languages?

Either way, I still would really like to have one of your performance ""lite"" x64 versions but with Japanese language support included."
,Addryann,2012-11-07T07:52Z,"@cabrapst786

Sorry, man, that really worked for me, otherwise I would'nt be telling you that. Are you sure you are using the latest version of Vistalizator? (2.51)"
,lemonkeyman,2012-11-11T16:58Z,"I was happy with the earlier version, I only needed
Remote Desktop to control my little box remotely on a LAN without internet (what depends on Windows Firewall service) and
Windows Installer service to to install some nasty applications that require that.

Now it's full of useless features again that takes memory and HDD space, running services and scheduled tasks that keep the HDD busy.

Still better than the factory version, though - your work is appreciated!

Other than those two missing services your tweaked Windows editions would be just the thing I need, badly...

I know it's a big thing to ask, but couldn't you make a usual tweaked version that support those two services?"
,emil50,2012-11-11T17:45Z,"thanks man,very fast,but how can i add another
lamguage?"
,cabrapst786,2012-11-12T19:48Z,"@Addryann

I wouldn't know, maybe that was the problem, but my HD wasn't good either, kept crash dumping all the time, so now I have a ssd and decided to put normal windows 7, cause it already runs really fast, and I wouldn't have any problems with the language.
Thanks for trying to help, and I'll keep that in mind for the next time I install it in any pc, because it worked for you anyways."
,Ahmad_se,2012-11-18T06:19Z,"Can you making New Excellent work like 
Win 7 Ultimate sp1 x32 lite with Windows Media Center (698mb)
without Media Center
But please

Thank you"
,ibitha,2012-11-20T08:34Z,"Thanks nilesh. Installed great on a new MacBook Air w/ Bootcamp. 

After installing the Bootcamp support files, the total space used by the Windows partition is: 18.9GB (20,357,210,112 bytes), or 17.6GB (18,962,051,072 bytes) before the added drivers. This leaves 4.76GB free on a 25GB partition."
,ibitha,2012-11-20T09:11Z,"Also if you turn off hibernation that saves 5GB instantly, and reducing the page file from 8GB to 2GB means the entire Win7 footprint can be easily reduced to 8GB."
,krhthkos,2012-11-27T19:17Z,"Dear Niles
