And not DVD upscales but from Original Blu Ray Discs sources?

Who Knows maybe someone is doing a rip of all the movies and we will see them in the near future, (24 Blu-Ray Rips aren't a joke)

Less compression means better quality & audio.

To HighCode:
I don't mean any disrespect to any of your uploads!! THanks."
,Namek911,2012-11-03T15:42Z,"@BondClint +1 :)

And of course many thanks to HighCode!"
[V],HighCode,2012-11-03T15:45Z,"If you found what you want, 260-390 GB pack (LOL), please prove us with some snap shots (mention the frames and time) not just claim that ""The bigger the better). It's like saying ""A bigger car is faster and more expensive"", so a Ford Mondeo is better then a Porche lol). 
I wouldn't compress them this much if there would be noticeable difference between source vs encode. I made hundreds of samples until I found the right encoding settings to compress as much as possible while keeping as identical as possible picture quality. Secondly one should first test  switching between the audio tracks (a 600 MB DTS @ 768 KB/s vs 2.5 GB DTS-HD ) before keeping shouting all over again and again  ""HD audio only please...blah-blah"".
Very few people have the right system, settings, and the ears to notice any difference between DTS 768 & DTS-HD @~2500 KB/s. Good luck with your  260-390 GB pack. 
Even this small 130 GB pack people don't seem to share generously, unless you're lucky and some nice people put the torrent on seed-box, what do you expect then from a 2 times bigger pack on open tracker? 
I don't mean to disrespect you either BondClint."

They are all synched, errors removed and timing improved where needed."
,karimbaraka,2012-11-05T12:35Z,Thanks
,agent667,2012-11-12T12:53Z,Would love to watch these but sadly been stuck at max 2.6kbps for the last 24 hours.
,godo12345,2012-11-12T22:12Z,what is the video bitrate of this sir highcode?
,AwesomeDuck,2012-11-15T01:12Z,Amazing! Norwegian subtitles would be much appreciated! :)
,kostasxkk,2012-11-16T01:49Z,"Can you please explain to me why the resolution and the bitrate differs from movie to movie? I mean others have 1808x1800 resolutionand 5800 bitrate like Dr. No, while some others have 1920x816 resolution and 5500 bitrate like Casino Royale."
[V],HighCode,2012-11-18T18:28Z,"Why some movies were filmed in 1,67 AR (1808/1080)? I don't know.
http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Dr-No-Blu-ray/971/

After I made many tests a while ago I found that 6000 KB/s is ideal for 16/9 (1080/1080) movies with my settings.
1808/1080 has obviously less pixels to encode then 1920/1080 that's why there are @ 5800.
1920/816 is again much less,  so 5300-5500 KB/s is all they need.
Shortly more pixels more bit-rates, less pixels less bit-rates..you don't need to be Einstein to get the point.

,AwesomeDuck,2012-11-19T00:48Z,"Oh god, the ETA on this is over two years... Please seed! I will seed at least 200% when done."
,scurvypirate1234,2012-11-22T04:57Z,Anyone have English subs for the foreign language parts?
[V],HighCode,2012-11-23T11:54Z,"@scurvypirate1234
English subs for the foreign language parts?
You don't need them because they are hard-coded.
You're welcome."
,daonebomb,2012-11-24T16:04Z,"You HighCode sir, are a legend :)"
,kostasxkk,2012-11-24T21:58Z,"Ok, thanks for the detailed answer. Your encodes are the BEST on the entire tpb. But tell me, margelaturau and FatFreddy69 are your former accounts?"
[V],HighCode,2012-11-25T00:37Z,"margelaturau is a mate of mine, the other is a fantasy name given by staff. I got pissed and asked to delete my mkvonly account and instead of deleting it they renamed it. TPB's policy is to not delete torrents, the large data base -larger number of visitors."
