Windows 8 USB Installer Maker formats your USB drive in NTFS format, extracts all files from the ISO file to the USB, and then writes the boot MBR on to the USB to make it bootable. As always, you need to have a USB flash drive with 4GB or more disk space to use the drive for this operation.
 
Please note that the tool should be launched as administrator. To do this, right-click on Windows 8 USB Installer Maker and then click Run as administrator. DonΓÇÖt forget to backup data from the USB drive before using to make bootable media.
