Long OOP John Williams score for the 1969 film, "The Reivers," based on the novel by William Faulkner. Aspiring filmmaker Steven Spielberg was so taken with this score he vowed John Williams would be his composer. A few years later came "Jaws." Since, Williams has scored all but two Spielberg pictures.
