BTW, congrats on your purple skull!"
,BoonesFerry,2012-11-03T11:44Z,"Thanks. Really enjoy not having to stream the OT, and appreciate the extras. "
,BoonesFerry,2012-11-03T11:46Z,Thanks. I Appreciate not having to stream the OT and I really enjoy the extras. 
,yurune,2012-11-03T13:59Z,"Are you gonna upload the xvid (mini) versions?  x264 doesn't play on my standalone dvd player.  
*munches eggroll*"
,dbranson17,2012-11-03T14:07Z,"great, but where's the actual show?"
,Barthanol,2012-11-03T14:56Z,"Too bad everything but the actual show is included, must have been uploaded by a republican, no logic or common sense for MP4SUX to exclude the show. Don't waste your time."
,Revrant,2012-11-03T15:48Z,"Yep, no FUCKING show here people."
,vi37n0w,2012-11-03T15:48Z,MP4SUX U just got a pink skull and do us like this?
,jfhjr,2012-11-03T18:42Z,MP4SUX on my shit list 4 sure - no more idiots please.
,ziggyff,2012-11-03T22:40Z,the wording makes it appear the regular show is included..it isn't ...a disappointment
,tunamoon,2012-11-03T23:11Z,"I read the whole description and no where does it say the main show is included. He lists three seperate sections. Overtime, Downtime and Backstage pass. Many people don't read the full description. In hindsite I'm sure he would have put at the top in bold letters JUST OVERTIME and DOWNTIME. But the pirate bay doesn't allow you to edit your decription. Don't be too hard on the guy, he is just uploading what he has. For those of us outside the U.S, the little extras that people upload are a nice addtition"
,Frosty_Winnipeg,2012-11-03T23:31Z,MP4SUX does not do the show(as far as I know) but his efforts with Overtime are well appreciated. It's the best RTWBM Overtime out there.
,robert342,2012-11-04T00:45Z,"WTF, it's not not like I am not unappreciative. But can some uploaders PLEASE, upload a bigger file so we can see this properly on big tvs? I mean, our retinal displays and ect...Thank you"
,sin-cos-tan,2012-11-04T00:52Z,"MP4SUX ROX.  This is an excellent torrent, but like everyone else I'm gnashing my teeth trying to find the actual episode.  Thanks for your work though mate."

p.s. - My shiny new pink skull was NOT asked for (but very much appreciated), however if any of you think it should be withdrawn - just go into the forums and tell them I didn't bend to your every demand and show me who's really in charge around here. For the record, management said it was because of what I'd already posted ...

... and for being polite ...

It's really easy to be polite. The first six things you write - throw them away and then think carefully about what you really want enshrined here as a testament to your temperament. In case you haven't noticed, it's nearly impossible to take anything back once you've clicked on ""submit""."
,tunamoon,2012-11-04T03:03Z,"He put up the show and didn't have room to put  Bill Maher in the title, just real time. So it won't show up if you search just Bill Maher. Here is the link.

,yurune,2012-11-04T06:42Z,"Thanks Tunamoon, I always search for ""Bill Maher"", so I wouldn't have found it otherwise.  And thanks Aviguy!  :)"
,acsmith1972,2012-11-04T07:38Z,"Maybe he just managed to catch everything before and after the show, but not the show itself, or didn't know how to upload the actual show itself...

They need to re-color his skull to bright yellow for inept. "
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-04T08:04Z,"Sorry about the naming thing - Didn't think it through too well, but my mind was boggled by technical aspects of that ""project"".

AVIGUY"
,aaronlavsky,2012-11-05T10:10Z,Thank you for the upload. Much appreciated. Cheers!
,Barthanol,2012-11-10T06:58Z,"Look the mistake was obviously MP4SUX's, don't title the download Real Time with Bill Maher if it does not include real time. So... NO SOUP FOR YOU either!!"
