,bktheman,2012-11-03T03:04Z,"^ LOL

,demonee,2012-11-03T17:55Z,"@r4heel @bktheman I know just fine what I'm talking about. You should be the ones getting educated. Go to YouTube, download a 480p video, tell me what the dimensions are. According to you, 720x302. If the uploader is going to write 480p in the title, I expect 480 lines of pixels on the horizontal.

Read this:
""Your camera records 720x480 for 4:3 or 16:9 (both non-square pixel). For display, 4:3 is resized to 640x480 (square pixel) or ~853x480 (square pixel) for 16:9.""

Emphasis on non-square pixels. This is also how movies are burnt on dvds and blurays. Now tell me I'm stupid.

480p in the title suggests the screen is bigger than your average DVD rip, which is what the issue is here. The author of the torrent is misrepresenting its contents."

Nevermind the actual frame ration, if the uploader is going to write 480p in the title, I expect 480 lines of pixels on the horizontal.
