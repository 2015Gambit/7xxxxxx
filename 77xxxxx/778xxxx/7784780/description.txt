[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

On this week's show, we debate myths.

Myths like...

The federal government must lead disaster relief.

Congressman Ron Paul will tell us why we don't need FEMA to save us.

Private companies like Wal-Mart do a better job, says economist Steve Horwitz but Tara McGuinness of the Center for American Progress says we need FEMA.

It's wrong to take advantage of people by raising prices after disasters!

Art Carden will explain why price controls set by government do more harm than price "gouging."

Natural disasters can help the economy

this myth is often repeated by media pundits. Economists David Henderson and Sallie James explain why it's wrong.

Super-Pacs are evil. Undecided voters are idiots.

Ira Stoll from the Future of Capitalism blog and Reason Magazine editor-in-chief Matt Welch defend outside money in politics and undecided voters.

Polls aren't accurate.

I will challenge Scott Rasmussen about the accuracy and fairness of his polls.

Finally, I'll explain how I ripped you off to pay for my beach house.
