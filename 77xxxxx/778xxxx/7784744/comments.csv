,capiel89,2012-11-17T13:28Z,"dear mr SnakEye,
thank u very much for this nice torrent. i am looking forward to your VVTS and VDSR release soon. the current scenery of those scenery aren't really compatible with FSX.
And if you can also convert the current freeware fs9 scenery of WMKK to FSX version. that would be awesome as well. Anyway, thanks a bunch for all your uploads. cheers =)"
