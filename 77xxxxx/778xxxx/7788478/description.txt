As promised, since the super group Sceneline is only interested in how many torrents they can upload and not whether they can continue to seed what they post for more than 24 hours, here is a file that will be seeded for longer than a few days.																							                                 It is no excuse that you have more torrents to upload so that you can not continue to seed what you already posted, then get a larger hard drive like everyone else if you want to post everything under the sun.																					If I can seed longer, then they should also be able to continue seeding what they post. 													Also this is not rared, as in this day and age nothing should be, this is not newsgroups anymore.																							Am I the only one tired of their lack of seeding ???																																																																													Enjoy and please share.
