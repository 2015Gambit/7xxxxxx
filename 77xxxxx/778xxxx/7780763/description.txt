Japanese and vegetarian food expert Miyoko Nishimoto Schinner presents traditional Japanese dishes and regional specialties from Kyusju in the south to Hokkaido in the north. She draws from a long tradition of vegetarian cooking in Buddhist temples, as well as an abundance of vegetable- and legume-based dishes that can be found in traditional Japanese cuisine. For those dishes that are usually prepared with meat, fish or fowl, Miyoko has created innovative substitutes utilizing tofu, seitan, and other vegetarian foods to create what is truly a unique vegan cookbook.
