Chinese shit."
,harvengure,2012-11-03T20:40Z,"Arzaniite's review is rubbish.

A/V is 6/6 (VHS quality)

the sound is in English but it seems to have Chinese subtitles.

It is a watchable quality though, especially if you're looking to view it on a laptop or mobile device."
,harvengure,2012-11-03T20:48Z,"AV: 6.5/6

English audio

Watchable on laptop or mobile device"
,TheCrowdGoesWild,2012-11-03T22:31Z,"For God sake people, of course it has Chinese subs it's a bloody R6 rip, it even says it in the title

People need to educate themselves before complaining about things, or else they'll just look stupid.

R6 means 'region 6', which is China. So if it's a R6 cam or hdrip then 99.999% of the time there will be subtitles (or they may be removed by cropping the picture)"
,ptrappers,2012-11-03T23:08Z,"Watchable on laptop or mobile device .......




Just sit further away from the big screen...it is the same as watching a small screen closer up...........  lol ? "
,Arzaniite,2012-11-03T23:53Z,Heed my warning!
,Autocrorect,2012-11-04T10:45Z,"If you're watching Ted and complaining about the A/V, you're clearly not stoned enough.

But seriously, a DVDRip would be nice... it's been out of cinemas for AGES now."
,hawkesk57,2012-11-04T16:28Z,"Yeah, not great, I had to adjust the audio to match the video, and the watermark is annoying.
A/V = 6"
,Annonymuspirate,2012-11-04T18:01Z,"I agree with the others here who says it's watchable on laptop or mobile device.
I tried to watch it on a 40 inch tv yesterday and that sucks!
