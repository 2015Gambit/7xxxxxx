 Notes: (READNFO) Slightly lower quality than some of my other releases. Cropped the
 first line of hardcoded subtitles leaving the one small line which only pops up
 a few times throughout the movie. There is a hardcoded watermark that pops up and
 goes away again also. Take it or leave it it's your choice, just don't complain.
