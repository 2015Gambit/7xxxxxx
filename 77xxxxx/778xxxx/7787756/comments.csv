,soletar,2012-11-07T05:02Z,"First film I would ever dream  of downloading a CAM copy. Am such a 007 addict…

Eon productions, Sony pictures..i solemnly pledge to buy a bluray of this film, the rest of the pirates, I can not vouch for… can someone tell me when the BluRay is likely to be released? July? Hope I would be alive till then..Thanks uploader!! "
,crazyoliv,2012-11-10T05:48Z,"The screen is fuckin' tilted and people are talking in the theater or whatsoever.

I left that superb movie @ 12min, will stop to seed, and will wait further for descent CamJob.

Don't spread this shame, 'cause that will encourage morrons to share lousy and crapy CamJob. The CamJob of Dredd is awfull also. What The Fuck is going on? We're in 21th century. Show some proud and blame HeroMaster to take us DownLoader look like morron wathchin such crap. 

Yes it's free. I would be paid to watch such butchery of a nice movie. I wan't a refund!!!!"
