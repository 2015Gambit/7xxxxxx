,Up_Yours_,2012-11-04T17:04Z,"Thanks BOZX. Always appreciated. I have a question for whoever can answer it. Why are BOZX's torrents always much slower than other uploaders?? For example Yify's are always fast no matter what the size is of the torrent. I'm not complaining, I'm just curious why."

,dimebags,2012-11-24T03:32Z,What is the difference between this and http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7788648/Savages.2012.UNRATED.1080p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS_[PublicHD] besides file size?
,djchongo69,2012-11-24T22:52Z,"Thanks for the up. I have a problem with your torrents, maybe you can help? I playback on a smp-n200. I downloaded 720p and 1080p and both skip. It seems to do with the AVC mbps. When it goes over 30mbps it skips. Every thing I have is connected to Ethernet and rated to 100mbps. I have other videos that play over 30mbps fine. My other comment is, why are all your uploads stretched vertically? I have to fix the aspect ratio every time. Im not complaining, just curious. Thanks again, Keep it up!"
