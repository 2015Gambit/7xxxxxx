============================================

Critter Crunch is fueled by an original and award-winning "food chain" puzzle mechanic, which is all about feeding critters into each other until they burst. It's exactly as cute as it is horrible and sad, just like nature itself! The game features a bunch of single player modes like adventure & puzzle, as well as online and local multiplayer in versus & co-op flavors, with a plethora of fancy trophies to collect. It also has lots of really pretty 1080p art that should make your HDTV happy.
