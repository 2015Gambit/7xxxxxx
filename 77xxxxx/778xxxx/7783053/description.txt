Eshon spent 5 years making a name for himself in PhiladelphiaΓÇÖs underground hip-hop scene. He performed at talent shows, open micΓÇÖs, house parties and local events. In 1999 he signed a record deal with a city-known drug dealer and childhood friend, and again with another big time drug dealer the following year. Because of EshonΓÇÖs Godly convictions neither venture ever progressed into anything.
