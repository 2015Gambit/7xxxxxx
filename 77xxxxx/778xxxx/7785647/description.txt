Directed and Written by Herschell Gordon Lewis
Starring Bill Kerwin, Allison Louise Downe, Mal Arnold and Lawrence J. Aberman as "Mr. Lang"

A very stupid high school girl who needs money to attend college is recruited to model shoes and swimwear by a seedy photographer who is an agent for smut kingpin Mr. Lang. The girl is blackmailed and forced to pose for more provocative photographs. "Only an alert society can rid itself of those who prey upon human weakness -- the SCUM OF THE EARTH."

A classic of its kind, similar to Ed Wood's THE SINISTER URGE only much better, certainly more coherent.  Many of the same actors would appear in BLOOD FEAST, later that year.
