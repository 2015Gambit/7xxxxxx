Ion-exchange Technology II: Applications presents an overview of the      
   numerous industrial applications of ion-exchange materials.In             
   particular, this volume focuses on the use of ion-exchange materials in   
   various fields including chemical and biochemical separations, water      
   purification, biomedical science, toxic metal recovery and                
   concentration, waste water treatment, catalysis, alcohol beverage,        
   sugar and milk technologies, pharmaceuticals industry and metallurgical   
   industries.This title is a highly valuable source not only to             
   postgraduate students and researchers but also to industrial R&D          
   specialists in chemistry, chemical, and biochemical technology as well    
   as to engineers and industrialists.
