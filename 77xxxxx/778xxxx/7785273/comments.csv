I have only one question for everyone:
do I need any of the previous patches or I simply can use only this here over clear install?
Thanks!"

,fragsnipa,2012-11-11T03:31Z,Creation Kit needs to be update.  Why nobody release the update for the CK when Skyrim gets updated.  
,fragsnipa,2012-11-11T03:38Z,Creation Kit also needs a update.
