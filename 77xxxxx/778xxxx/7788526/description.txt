Who does not like free stuff! I know, so I gave it a great eBook for programming series that teaches the hackers in mislih.EBook is called "batch programming". I know who would have thought.

But before I give you access to the eBook, you must first know what the packet Programming.

Package files are essentially a sequence of DOS commands saved to a text file with the extension "BAT". When work is a lot out every line in a batch file, as if typed into the console. So basically, a file containing DOS commands that you normally type at the command prompt.

Batch file is used mainly for repeat tasks. Instead of typing commands over and over again to do a certain task, you can create a batch file that does all this automatically with the implementation of a bulk set of commands.

So why would hackers know the batch programming? Well I'll give you some ideas and you can decide for yourself:
