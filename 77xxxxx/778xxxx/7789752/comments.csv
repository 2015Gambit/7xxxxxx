EVERY FRIGGEN activator says this....WHY
please help me"
,Chixlegs,2012-11-04T23:54Z,"Norton has scanned this file and determined it as a virus. I really don't want to turn my Antivirus, because that's just inviting things to blow up in my face....."
,nitrojunkie007,2012-11-05T06:35Z,@424ac You might have installed the windows pro with windows media center edition....just install windows pro...it works...later get a free key via email for wmc... Microsoft is distributing it for free as of now...

,zaeb,2012-11-05T15:20Z,just remove the fucking time bomb u fucking mallrats. stop spaming us with this pos software.
,vrocks94,2012-11-05T19:26Z,this won't exactly activate ur windows cuz in computer's properties it still shows that the windows is not activated but after using this software u'll still be able to personalize ur settings as well as download the fuckin updates........I still don't know why after installing this it says that the windows is permanently activated but it is not reflected in the computer's properties..........any help would be much appreciated regarding this issue.......but still my windows is working properly...... 
,lavir74,2012-11-05T20:35Z,"@vrocks94:

That's simple: because THIS IS NOT AN ACTIVATOR, IT IS JUST A  CRACK.  Using this you will not activate W8, you can just go without the problems that activations comport, but you are not still activated at all.

IN SHORT: ALL THESE ""PERMANENT"" ACTIVATORS YOU SEE TILL NOW ARE ALL FAKES. There's no permanent activator as of now. The only way to REALLY activate is via a KMS server, and the only way to permanently activate is (after activating 180 days) to get a key for Media Center and apply the upgrade.

All people that use these shit ""activators"" as this are only wasting time and they will have a lot of problems in the future."
,bhutu,2012-11-06T22:33Z,"I have made a fresh install of Win8 Pro WMC (x64) and tried to Activate it by ACTIVATOR_KJ.120829 but it crashed everytime I tried to run it. I also tried the FIX_P8.25 in hope that it will Activate and unlock the 'Personalise' feature. But this was too of no avail. 
Then I tried the K.J_120929 but that didn't worked too. On every try the cmd window crashes (it happened exactly the same with Activator_KJ.120829).
Finally the Windows.8.Activator.K.J.v1.11_Tam saved my day. 
Although the my Win8 Pro WMC (x64) still says it is not activated I can personalise and download updates (including the KB2756872)  and Apps from Windows Store. 

I will again give a try with the past Activators which has failed me. But for now K.J.v1.11 works."

The activator that you said is not working for windows 8 ENT"
,not.me,2012-11-11T01:27Z,"works like a charm with 8Pro, thanks"
,tpbl,2012-11-23T06:03Z,"ACtually this works well. 
U have to change the product key and then install the pirate activator

@lavir74 you activated with the only released MAK key ..JCQ4 which only activates windows only for 180  days. you can use this very well for permanent activation and download updates."
