Anthrology: No Hit Wonders (1985ΓÇô1991) is a greatest hits compilation of songs by the band Anthrax, which is centered around the 2005 Among the Living line-up reunion (see also Alive 2) which includes current vocalist Joey Belladonna and former guitarist Dan Spitz. This release features only songs from the band's Joey Belladonna-era studio output, which began with Armed and Dangerous and ended with Attack of the Killer B's.
This release was issued in separate CD and DVD versions. The CD version comprises two discs. All of the tracks featured on the CD version of this release have been remastered.
