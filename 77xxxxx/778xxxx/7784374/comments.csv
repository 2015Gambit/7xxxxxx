,XHaloXX,2012-11-02T18:07Z,"WTF, do we have to redownload the repack, or just this one do?"
,rap2pac,2012-11-02T19:40Z,"@divesh8_4  yes its working with the fix. 
Change EUROSOUND_USA_STR.BIN to EUROSOUND_ENG_STR1.BIN

,rap2pac,2012-11-02T20:20Z,But no voice sound
,Ghostin012,2012-11-03T11:08Z,"It does work. You need to change ALL USA. to ENG1 even the 000 files. So the Eurosound_USA_str.000 >> Eurosound_ENG_STR1.000 

after that everything worked perfectly voice and all."
,myers97,2012-11-03T18:45Z,"@rap2pac 

It worked perfectly following your instructions."
,ViolentReaper,2012-11-04T05:39Z,"So, I have tried what has been suggested pertaining to those EUROSOUND.BIN files in the DATA folder, but I still cannot get the voice to work in the game. Everything else works except for the voices.

Right now I have these 4 lines as:

EUROSOUND_ENG_STR1.000
EUROSOUND_ENG_STR1.BIN
EUROSOUND_ENG1.000
EUROSOUND_ENG1.BIN

Is there something here I am not doing right ?"
