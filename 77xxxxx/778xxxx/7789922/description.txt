We believe that a great sounding main synth is key to great sounding productions but for too long these type of products have been priced out of reach for most aspiring producers. With ANA we aim to change that!
ANA has been designed from the ground up to create all the sounds you hear in modern and classic electronic music.

It is designed to be extremely user friendly and intuitive. Everything is set out clearly and with a logical flow. In the coming weeks we will continue to support the plugin with tutorials to help you really understand the fundamentals of good sound design and enable you to create sounds you never before thought possible.
