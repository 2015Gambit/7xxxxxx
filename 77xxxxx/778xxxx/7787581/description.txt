DEAR DRACULA, a graphic novel for kids published by the Image Comics imprint Shadowline, has been adapted into an animated feature for Cartoon Network. The hour-long feature was aired on October 16 at 7 p.m. (ET, PT) as part of Cartoon Network┬Æs ┬ôSpooky Specials┬ö Halloween programming. A scarily sweet story of a young boy named Sam who loves horror films and vampires so much that he writes to Dracula for Christmas instead of Santa Claus, DEAR DRACULA was written by Joshua Williamson and drawn by Vicente ┬ôVinny┬ö Navarrete. Sam gets an unexpected reply to his letter, when Dracula himself shows up on his doorstep, ready to make Sam┬Æs dream of being a vampire come true.
