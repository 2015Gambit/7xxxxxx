29 3 "The Most Dangerous Po" Michael Mullen Gene Grillo October 13, 2012 

Invited to a famed and retired General Tsin, Po joins the paranoid General on a hunt for Hundun the Rhino, who was lured there with the promise 
of a free pie. Although Po tries to warn currently innocent Hundun to run away, Hundun misinterprets the warnings, and Po defeats him after a 
short fight. The General then takes Hundun in a room full of famous criminals, including Temutai, Scorpion, Fung, Gar-hi, Taotie, Bao, and Jing Mei, 
all of whom have been put in a deep sleep. Realizing that the General has lost his mind, Po challenges the General, but blinded by a spray, he flees away. 
After a brief preach by his conscience, Po returns to the General's place, where he is taken as a prisoner and put in a sleeping chamber. But when the 
general releases the sleeping gas, the hoses, which have been switched by Po, starts pumping the wakening gas, unfreezing all villains. Defeated by 
the prisoners, Po sends the General to Chorh-Gom Prison.

Villians: General Tsin, Hundun, Temutai, Scorpion, Fung, Gar-hi, Taotie, Bao, & Jing Mei
