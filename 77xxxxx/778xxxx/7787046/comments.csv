,jarichp,2012-11-03T07:10Z,I'm not quite sure if I want to say thanks.
,BruceWayneJr,2012-11-03T07:40Z,Tanks?
[V],Acesn8s,2012-11-03T07:56Z,@jarichp well don't say thanks pay and go watch it TPB don't give skulls to ppl that upload fake torrents moron:( 
,azzek,2012-11-03T08:11Z,Thank you for your efforts...can you please give more info on A / V for a cam?
,octiny,2012-11-03T08:14Z,Real and in english. Thanks! :)
,phillymike32,2012-11-03T08:41Z,very watchable and from what i seen audio is even in sync
,HRDual,2012-11-03T09:25Z,Skyfall download has been a nuisance and piece of shit on The Pirate Bay
,jarichp,2012-11-03T09:30Z,Its reel
,jarichp,2012-11-03T10:11Z,"@acesn8s & @opensociety
I'm grateful, I was making a comment about how every 10 minutes a fake Skyfall is uploaded. Finally something real."
,Gros_Shadok,2012-11-03T10:46Z,"I haven't finished to download it yet but it seems :
- that it's really skyfall
- that the quality is a bit blurry but watchable
BUT it also seems that it's only 1 hour long !
So, the movie doesn't seems to be complete !"
,phillymike32,2012-11-03T11:11Z,why do people bother writing nonsense without knowing what the fuck their talking about. the movies over 2 hours and yes its complete.
,Gros_Shadok,2012-11-03T11:50Z,"Ok I must correct what I've said... my preview was saying 1 hour long but now it says 1h36 so that was because the download was not finished.
So, this is the real thing !"

,BruceWayneJr,2012-11-03T13:33Z,"The damn thing goes dark at the 1:90:00 mark. Thanks for the effort, but let's hope for a better copy."
,BruceWayneJr,2012-11-03T13:35Z,"opensociety, I've never spammed to a scam site in my life. I discourage the cunts who put up fake torrents. Get your facts straight or go fuck yourself."
,BruceWayneJr,2012-11-03T13:40Z,"To clarify, it blacks out at 1:19:10 mark, and the picture returns at 1:24:33. 

And again, opensociety, don't talk shit about things you know nothing about."
,BruceWayneJr,2012-11-03T13:55Z,"I posted this once and it disappeared, so I'm posting it again.

To clarify, the picture goes dark at 1:19:10, and returns at 1:24:33. 

And once again to opensociety, don't talk shit about things you know nothing about. "
,stanbyh,2012-11-03T13:57Z,You are all acting like a bunch of kids. 
,BruceWayneJr,2012-11-03T21:19Z,"Wow... I make a sarcastic remark after two other people post links to real spam sites, and you're probably the one moron who believed that TUBGIRL.COM is a real thing. You're either humorless or a complete moron. Probably both."
,BruceWayneJr,2012-11-03T21:39Z,"Hey detective opensociety, this ndncblrf guy looks legit. What do you think???"
,vidange,2012-11-04T01:24Z,"If this is the same cam going around...
Parts a very watchable... some, not so much.
Quiet dialogue is tough to hear as well.
And, it goes completely black at one point for a few minutes.
I think I heard someone in the audience burp, too.
But... it's free so no biggie.
Can't really knock free stuff, right?
But, yeah... very real."

,Caeden,2012-11-04T04:40Z,"Whatever this was encoded with is beyond me. It says I need a codec I already have, then tries to take me to a website to install a ""codec"" that won't get past my antivirus programme."
,Xenirina,2012-11-04T05:35Z,"Well, not the greatest quality, but beggers can't be choosers.
Thanks a lot."
,Fritz.,2012-11-04T07:47Z,"
4 video.  its not really watchable. there are many scenes, including the last 20 minutes or so, that are just so blurry you have no idea whats really going on at all.

6 audio. its decent enough, but there are still sections where you can hear the audience and other crackles and things.



its hard to honestly give a review of the movie when the copy is this bad. its obviously supposed to be an action movie, but all of the action scenes were so blurry i could not tell what was happening at all. i nearly fell asleep watching it."
,Eagle_Networks,2012-11-04T09:15Z,I watched It yesterday in my cinema but they didn't allowed me to use camera... damn!
,detr1k,2012-11-04T10:17Z,"Good movie, but the quality of this cam is quite poor.  In fact, it becomes unwatchable at times, which would be tolerable if it didn't do so at the LAST MAJOR SCENE.  Thanks for the upload, but I just can't recommend this.  If you wanna watch it, go to the theater.  

A-8 - a few interruptions from people watching but not a problem
V-3 - becomes blurry, dark, and unwatchable numerous times."
,nobodynever,2012-11-04T10:43Z,Why bother?  Unwatchable.
,taistoi,2012-11-04T22:53Z,"oooh, i wonder what's in the NFO that's so fucking important that you have to write it in the damn title. is it the number to your mom's hotline?
this release sucks horse dicks btw"
,dejidare_143,2012-11-04T23:35Z,"I appreciate this, but always add video file type"

,atsay714,2012-11-05T09:21Z,Why is this trash out but not Wreck-it Ralph?
,patolya,2012-11-05T10:51Z,"Lots of blurry moments and even several minutes with black screen, so many unfocussed scenes as well. I really regretted to watch this great movie under such bad conditions, non talking about the sound which is at time terrible and non audible...
Wait for the real thing or maybe when someone upload a better version, filmed by a good cam!

,rogerebertonacid,2012-11-05T20:26Z,"spent 2 days downloading this
trust me: only download this cam if you qualify for both of the following 2 conditions
1) you don't have enough money to go watch this in the movie theater, and 
2) you are absolutely certain that you will die before a better cam/rip/whatever is uploaded

btw, does anyone ever actually order one of the 'real russian women'? are there different delivery options? courier? express? surface mail?"
,rogerebertonacid,2012-11-05T20:37Z,"i mean, really...this was recorded on my grandma's cellphone - the one that got stolen 3 years ago - and you can hear the dude scratching his balls every few minutes, that's when he's not coughin"
,rogerebertonacid,2012-11-05T21:43Z,"one final comment/hypothesis
it's like the guy filming this cam purposely puts the camera out of focus
maybe he's an agent provocateur acting on behalf of the film studio, trying to drive us lot into the cinemas out of sheer frustration
maybe he's simply a twisted fuck"
,wandamay,2012-11-06T08:48Z,"sorry, this is un-watchable.  i understand cam-rips arent dvd quality, but this is so blurry and dark that faces aren't even recognizable.  not worth the time "
,soletar,2012-11-07T05:03Z,"First film I would ever dream  of downloading a CAM cop.Am such a 007 addictâ&#x20AC;Ś

Eon productions, Sony pictures..i solemnly pledge to buy a bluray of this film, the rest of the pirates, I can not vouch forâ&#x20AC;Ś can someone tell me when the BluRay is likely to be released? July? Hope I would be alive till then..Thanks uploader!! ;-)"
,stinkyKuntz,2012-11-07T20:09Z,"this movie is so perfect you can smell the shit stains in the cellphone persons underware,smells like too much cheese.......a4

,bubbanuggzz,2012-11-08T10:41Z,"@Acesn8s jarichp never said it was fake,he said he wasn't sure if he should thank you.would you thank some one that handed you a pile of shit?I thank you for the work you put in to upload the torrent & the risk you took in doing so....but after looking at the finished product I have to say niether was worth it :)"
,Kevs1,2012-11-08T11:06Z,"All you Fuckheads that complain about the cam and expect HD DVD Quality why don't you take the risk of going to the theater instead of insulting the work of some one who is out there, Don't like cams the don't down load and Fuckoff to the toilet and play with your self,, thanks uploader for your effort"
,saint84,2012-11-08T13:05Z,blurry . quality sucks
,icey701,2012-11-09T01:43Z,This movie is not even out until 11/9/2012 so id say this being here early is a blessing even if the quality isn't the greatest don't complain about a pre-release  
,koltbolt,2012-11-09T11:57Z,"Harakiri_ said at 2012-11-04 04:12 CET: 
""I rather watch my dogs asshole for an hour and a half."" 
Will you be making a cam of that and uploading it? I want to complain when you get up halfway through the show to use the bathroom. (or the dog does) Please label it ""my dogs asshole 2012 cam"" so we can all find it, rate the quality and weave in some Zionist Obama trolling. Also add an imdb link please, I want to know what 12 year olds think of the acting. Thanks :)   "

But this isn't watchable ill w8 for better"
,npalumbo1089,2012-11-10T05:57Z,"im not at all complaining about anything uploaded to this site, i do appreciate the risk that you guys take filming these for some of us out there that cant afford 15 dollar movie tickets. again thank you, but my only question is that why do people not use high quality cameras? you would think that if a high definition camera is used the quality would be better. if i could afford a camera that is over 500$ i would be in the theaters filming for everyone. just a question ive always had about the uploads."
,bobbytheninja1,2012-11-10T15:30Z,so... hows the movie ?
,RDogg,2012-11-10T23:31Z,"The movie itself is amazing, I recommend watching it in theaters."
,passwordu,2012-11-11T12:09Z,"Thanks for the upload V=0 to 6, A 2 to 6 M -8
I endured thru the movie, I got the drift and plot. As the V & A above varies thru out the movie. There is one place for a minute or more te screen is pitch black with Audio. Thanks again for your efforts"
[V],Acesn8s,2012-11-11T19:13Z,@ roufsau no more spam comments in any of my torrents ever again you will be reported and deleted every time:( u ppl are a disease to TPB and its uploaders choose another site asshole!
,svalley,2012-11-13T18:33Z,"@saucu

Ooops saucu:-): seems that the site you are recommending wants your credit card details...

TPB never does that, and never will... It will always be FREE...:-) "
