Fish Police started in 1985 as a self-published black-and-white title by Moncuse through his own Fishwrap Productions. After 12 issues the title was picked up by Comico in 1987, which reprinted issues 1-4 in a trade titled Hairballs, followed by color reprints of the other 8 Fishwrap issues. After issue 17, Comico went bankrupt, but Fish Police was then acquired by Apple Press, which continued the numbering begun by Comico. Apple published the title until early 1991, stopping at number 26. In 1992ΓÇô1993, Marvel Comics reprinted the first six issues of the original self-published series, this time in full color.

Apple also printed a six-issue spin-off, Fish Shticks, between 1992 and 1993. Written by Moncuse and drawn by Steve Hauk, this series was more gag-based than the original.
