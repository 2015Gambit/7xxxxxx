,Feenixx,2012-11-04T01:50Z,"Heads up to downloaders, this is full screen with the left and right sides cut off. 

Thank you for the effort of encoding/uploading, seriously. But I think I'll wait for a full wide screen copy to be available. "
,ECCHiDUCKi,2012-11-04T15:31Z,over-cropped huh? thx for the head up
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-04T17:09Z,"No, it is not overcropped. The raw recording has a few pixels of black bars on the left and right which we cut out. Nothing from the actual show was cropped out."
,HelloMynameisV,2012-11-05T00:48Z,Thank you so much! :D 
,Feenixx,2012-11-11T15:27Z,"It's not over-cropped. I think in some places they just air it at a 4:3 ratio when in Standard Definition, instead of airing in widescreen. So it's actually the network that's cropping their own show. Not the uploader's fault, but I still prefer to wait a couple extra days for a wide screen copy to appear. 

Thanks for the effort in encoding and uploading (it really does look great for standard def!) but I'm too OCD to watch knowing it's been cropped from it's original intended format. "
