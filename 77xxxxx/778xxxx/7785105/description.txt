Based on reporter Herve Chabalier's autobiography about his battle with alcoholism, the story takes place in a French Alps retreat where Herve (Cluzet) confronts his dangerous addiction. He's introduced to a quirky cast of characters -- including a loudmouthed lush (Michel Vuillermoz) and a vodka-sipping vixen (Melanie Thierry) -- who reveal the hazards of falling off the wagon too many times. Godeau (who founded Gallic shingle Pan-Europeenne) tackles the action all too safely, showcasing fine production values.
