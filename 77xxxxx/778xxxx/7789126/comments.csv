,gnufella,2012-11-03T20:04Z,is this updateable? any updates slipstreamed? any tweaks incorporated? some more info would be nice.
[V],2010kaiser,2012-11-03T21:37Z,"No tweaks or alterations done. 2 original Win7 .ISO's incorporated into 1 AIO.

I didn't slipstream SP1 into the AIO as it brings it over the 4.7GB size for normal disk burning.

I have an AIO pre-activated both architectures with SP1 slipstreamed into it if you would like it uploaded.
You'll need to burn it to a dual layer disk or a USB that is 5GB+ because of its size ;-) "

is that fully updated as well? if so, do upload. many people use usb boot media.

personally, i prefer some amount of tweaking - at least to remove the uac prompts (which is very annoying), shortcut link arrow etc. btw, what is the best software to achive all that post-install?"
[V],2010kaiser,2012-11-04T04:03Z,"The tweaks you'd like to make post install are a pain in the ass to do and time consuming.
Personally if i was going to tweak a win O/S i'd do it while creating the .ISO with software like RT7lite.

It can be a little complicated if you haven't used it before but there are Tut's out there which explain the process fairly well.

creating and uploading a Win7 ""LITE"" isfairly hit and miss as far as it getting downloaded and seeded by users.

Two uploaders who i would recommend if your looking for a Win7 LITE .ISO are Tom_Da_Man and thethingy. Both of whom have 7 LITE uploads both of which i've used and both of which are 100% working flawelessly.

Hope this helps you out."
[V],2010kaiser,2012-11-04T04:05Z,"Sorry to answer your first question. Yes the torrent which i have of Win7 x86(32bit) and 64bit, ALL Editions with SP1 slipstreamed is fully up to date.
I'll upload it tomorrow when i have time to let it seed fully."
[V],2010kaiser,2012-11-04T04:17Z,"Here's the upload of the AIO Pre-activated with SP1 SlipStreamed into both architectures.
