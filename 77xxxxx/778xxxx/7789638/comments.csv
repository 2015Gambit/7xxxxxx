These might be nice,,,,, Date, language, ntsc or pal,     it would make downloaders much more comfortable considering the size of the files.

Regards"

If there are menus, extras etc. I will leave them. If anyone is a fan like me and have any requests, just ask. I'm new at this, so keep that in mind."
