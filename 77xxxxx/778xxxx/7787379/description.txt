There can only be one allegiance.
Its her time to choose.

Some humans can see the fae. McKenzie Lewis can track them, reading the shadows they leave behind. But some shadows lead to danger. Others lead to lies.

A Houston college student trying to finish her degree, McKenzie has been working for the fae king for years, tracking vicious rebels who would claim the Realm. Her job isnΓÇÖt her only secret. For just as long, sheΓÇÖs been in love with Kyol, the kingΓÇÖs sword-masterΓÇöand relationships between humans and fae are forbidden.

But any hope for a normal life is shattered when sheΓÇÖs captured by Aren, the fierce and uncompromising rebel leader. He teaches her the forbidden fae language and tells her dark truths about the Court, all to persuade her to turn against the king. Time is running out, and as the fight starts to claim human lives, McKenzie has no choice but to decide once and for all whom to trust and where she ultimately stands in the face of a cataclysmic civil war.
