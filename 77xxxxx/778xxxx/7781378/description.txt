This film is prophetic of Smita Patil's death. In the film, Smita goes into labour and is rushed to hospital. Moushami exhorts Babbar to do his duty for his lover. There is news that she has developed a high fever. Babbar is running around on the streets when someone accosts and informs him of her death. He turns to the side of the street and bursts into tears. Lying on the ground is Smita's bedecked body, her newborn son wailing besides her.
The same sequence would play out in Smita's life two years later when she developed post-pregnancy complications and a high fever, was rushed to hospital and died, leaving behind her newborn son.
