,djchongo69,2012-11-24T23:02Z,"Thanks for the up. I have a problem with your torrents, maybe you can help? I playback on a smp-n200. I downloaded 720p and 1080p and both skip. It seems to do with the AVC mbps. When it goes over 30mbps it skips. Every thing I have is connected to Ethernet and rated to 100mbps. I have other videos that play over 30mbps fine. My other comment is, why are all your uploads stretched vertically? I have to fix the aspect ratio every time. Im not complaining, just curious. Thanks again, Keep it up!"
