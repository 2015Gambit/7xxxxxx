Despite the dubious horns added to some of these live tracks this is an excellent 

album...arguably Carlton's best recorded work.

The last track EMOTIONS WOUND US SO is a tearjerking ballad done with some 

guitar "tricks" you can observe online.

After hearing this I bought other albums by Larry and none of them came close to this

one here IMO

I repeat..the horns are overdubbed..even the Mark Russo alto solo on track #2
