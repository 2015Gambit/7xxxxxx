Bizarre Foods America is an American television series, and a spin-off of Bizarre Foods, this time focusing on the United States rather than international travel. Andrew Zimmern travels to various cities throughout the country and samples local cuisines and ways of life. The format is similar to Bizarre Foods.

Much like the popular Bizarre Foods, Andrew heads to some of the most unique food hubs in the country. Once there he meets with locals and local chefs to gain a better understanding of American cuisine and to see how America has developed its reputation as a melting pot of cultures and foods and what sort of unusual foods people in America might have in their own cities and not realize.


having hard time getting this, it's scattered in rapidshare, extabit, depositfiles and megashares, like hunting treasure with wizzard google, but is' worth it. if you love andrew zimmern from bizarre foods, this is something that I have to do. thanks guys.
