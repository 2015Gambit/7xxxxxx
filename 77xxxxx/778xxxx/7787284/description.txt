In the year 1206, Genghis Khan and his Golden Horde dominated an immense territory from the Pacific Ocean to the Caspian Sea with only 150,000 men. In the year 2040, the newest Russian dictator has a unique vision: to invoke the spirit of Genghis Khan and his Golden Horde to create an empire reaching from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic. To do this, his secret service must find the corpse of the latest reincarnation of Genghis Khan. Their path will cross with the last Chechen, the survivor of a nuclear holocaust on a mystical quest. He has nothing to lose and fears nothing, especially not the Russian army and secret service.
