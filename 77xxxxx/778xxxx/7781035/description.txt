Pinball Arcade features exact recreations of the all-time greatest pinball tables from Williams┬«, Bally┬«, Stern Pinball┬«, and Gottlieb┬« together in one game. Every flipper, bumper, sound effect, and display pixel has been painstakingly emulated in astonishing detail.

Tales of the Arabian NightsΓäó is fully unlocked.

This update features Table Pack 7, including the Bally Halloween classic Scared StiffΓäó featuring Elvira and our first true electrectro-mechanical pin, GottliebΓÇÖs classic Big ShotΓäó. 

There is a new Pro Version of the Tales of the Arabian Nights table which gives you access to the Operators Menu, Ball Control, and other cool bonus features. 

Each month, regular updates will add on classics like Twilight Zone┬«, Attack from MarsΓäó, Dr. DudeΓäó, VictoryΓäó, Space Shuttle┬«, PinΓÇóBotΓäó, (and many others for years to come!) along with online tournaments and additional modes to challenge yourself and compete against your friends.

Game Center is now supported and an optional FarSight login allows players to connect to cross-platform leaderboards. 

Our goal is for the Pinball Arcade to become the most realistic and comprehensive pinball game ever created. Please support us in our efforts to preserve these tables and join the indelible part of Americana that is pinball!
