2. Installation process 

- Insert the DVD into the drive. Press 'Install' in the "AutoRun window
  appeared on your screen. Then, follow the installer instructions. If
  you have "AutoRun" off on your computer, open the root folder on the
  disk and run "autorun.exe".  
- Once you've installed the game, press the "Required Software" button 
  in the "AutoRun" Menu and make sure you have the required software 
  installed on your computer. If you have the required software installed
  on your computer, the appropriate menu item will be grayed.   

Note! If the "AutoRun" menu does not work properly on your computer, 
enter the "Liquidator" folder on the disk and run "installer.exe"
