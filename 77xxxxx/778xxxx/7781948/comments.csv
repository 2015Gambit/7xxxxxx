Also, This is my first upload, so someone please let me know if I did everything correctly."
,Kaien213,2012-11-01T20:15Z,"Dunno guys.... Gonna try it, ill let you know"
,zombird,2012-11-02T21:18Z,Is it working okay for everyone? I stopped seeding for a while because my computer is a pile of lava now pretty much... it needs a break.
,XmarcX92,2012-11-03T03:11Z,"It works without any lag, only problem are some graphical glitches such as the world looking all dark. I am still having a blast playing this though :P"
,XmarcX92,2012-11-03T07:30Z,"To fix the shadow problem, just turn shadow off and all your problems are gone :), this torrent get 9/10!"
,zombird,2012-11-04T09:32Z,"Yeah guys, like I said be sure to disable Shadows and Bloom.

Glad people are enjoying it. "
,XmarcX92,2012-11-05T02:48Z,Any other games you plan on porting also?
,Yamcha67,2012-11-05T05:09Z,"Works fine, but I would highly recommend playing this game on Windows through BootCamp..

I say that because I've just finished the game today, and while I loved it, just tried the Windows version and the graphics are amazing, sadly with the shadows turned off everything looks like crap..

When I tried it on Windows with the shadows enabled I'm already regretting not having played it on Windows..

Just thought I'd point that out.. But yes thanks for share it works perfectly fine with the shadows disabled.."
,XmarcX92,2012-11-05T16:07Z,"So people should play this in bootcamp just for some nice shadow effects? Nah I'll pass. If they had bootcamp in the first place, do you think they would be download a mac version also?"
,Yamcha67,2012-11-05T18:45Z,"@ XmarcX92, Generally in most games shadows don't really make such a profound difference, but I'd say this game is different..

Hey I know I can't convince or force any of you guys to play it on Windows, but If you have the bandwidth try the Windows version, and compare, then If you really believe that the difference is not worth using Bootcamp, play the Mac version..

Thats just how I feel, the Mac Native version would obviously be just as awesome as the Windows counterpart, but It's not released yet..

Anyway, I'm playing the game on Windows, this time using a different class..
"
,XmarcX92,2012-11-05T21:52Z,"I don't think you understand my point. If people had windows or bootcamp, they wouldn't be downloading this in the first place =/"
,Letyme,2012-11-06T06:27Z,"I changed the game to open in (Windowed-fullscreen) mode instead of fullscreen, and now it will not get past the first loading screen. Any help?"
,zombird,2012-11-07T10:06Z,"@XmarcX92 As far as porting goes, I want to try and get Retro City Rampage and Hotline Miami ported... just because they look fun. Also, possibly Bully. 

@Yamcha67, I think this completely goes against the concept of a native Mac game. I personally hate having to boot into a separate OS just to play a basic game. The whole point of this wrapper is to prevent people from having to do that. I agree this port is not the prettiest thing in the world, but I'm just hoping it will work until an official Mac version is released. 

@Letyme I actually didn't test it in fullscreen. Sorry. You might want to try reseting your settings by going to Documents/My Games/Runic Games/Torchlight 2 and deleting everything in there EXCEPT your game save folder. That hopefully will get it back to the original window settings it had to start with, and you can go from there."
