This is the first episode of season one, there is another torrent out there it says episode 1 to 4 plus extras but it was missing episode 4 and it had a part of another episode saying it was episode one which is different than this one that I uploaded. This one came from Comcast On-Demand and it says "Not easy making Monsters".
From what I saw on the Internet Episode one was the gang preparing for a trade show named "Transworld" and that is what this episode is about. If anyone has different information please leave a comment.

Thanks
