,Green.Lantern,2012-11-01T22:51Z,"Are the subs hardcoded?
or can I turn them off?"
,Redante,2012-11-02T00:19Z,"Yep, looks like not true 720p but still petty good.
I'd better wait for the proper Bluray rip.
Hardcoded subs - you can't turn them off."
,ZoolooCH,2012-11-02T15:58Z,"If this is the Asian version, then there are some scenes that were cut from the Western version (including stuff in Shanghai)."

Even some Koreans might want to watch it without KorSubs.
We'll have to patient for a decent torrent because we have high standards ;-)"

,42000,2012-11-17T04:50Z,This is bull shit for 2.4 gigs. A: Generous 7 V: 7.5 (Good quality but really grainy) 
[T],SecTPB,2012-11-22T09:20Z,"Good for an earlier release. 

Korean subs aren't that distracting at all.

Video quality is very watchable and better than a typical standard definition DVD rip.

Audio is a bit muffled and you can tell the source isn't as good for it, but the volume is consistent and you get used to it. I've listened to worse MP3's before.

I quite enjoyed it even with how it was. I am not spoiled like some and was on the internet in the age where we'd have to wait 9 hours for a 175MB Xvid file via 56k Dial-Up using shit like Napster. This looked good on my 1080p 42"" Plasma.

I do have to say... whoever uploads hardsubbed files in this day and age should be lynched to a tree and beaten like a pinata. If you're going to add subs, at least use softsubs with the Matroska container so we can disable them or demux them.

Video: 8/10.
Audio: 6/10.
Movie: 9/10.
Best copy out as of right now."
