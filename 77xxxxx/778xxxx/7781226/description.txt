A teenage boy is hired along with the music group of his father by a Zamidar (landlord) for entertaining him until the annual flood is over in the Haor region of East Bengal. But the boy finds out that he has to do something more than the rest of the members of the group are required- he has to satisfy the landlord sensually as well. The wife of the landlord cannot stand this new 'rival' of hers and conspires to kill the boy.
