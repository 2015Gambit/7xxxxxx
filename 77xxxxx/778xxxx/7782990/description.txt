Recorded in Denmark.....expressive, poignant trio recordings


EAC did not like this CD.  I had to reburn it to CDR with a standalone burner


and then type in the titles.


EAC had no problem with the resulting CDR


If I didn't love this album I wouldn't have done all of that work to share it with 


you, fellow music lovers.......froogAL
