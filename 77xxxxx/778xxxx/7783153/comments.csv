Thanks for the effort though!"
,Hanne70,2012-11-02T14:01Z,"As pinkku tells... The audio is OUT of sync. You have to use VLC and adjust the audio sync to watch this  one... :-(

I prefer to have xvid files in my series collection, and I was happy when I saw this AVI was out... but as it is Friday and ""Crime time"" on my tv... I have to download the MP4 version, as I wait for a in-sync version of this in AVI..."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-03T00:22Z,"I don't know what to say - watched it and noticed nothing.
But went back and sure enough, it audio is late by about 150ms.
MPC also allows for such adjustment.

I doubt most people will notice anything, but since you did - here's the fix.
Get a copy of VirtualDub, set the video to direct stream copy.
The audio needs to be re-encoded CBR (Vdub hates VBR).
audio-compression-mp3-160/44.

Depending on version, it should be under Audio-interleave.
Set the delay to -150 (or maybe -200 - some of this is subjectvie).

Sorry to all, don't know how it happened, source was fine.
Since it's such a slight error, I don't think reposting is warranted (unless there's a clamoring).
