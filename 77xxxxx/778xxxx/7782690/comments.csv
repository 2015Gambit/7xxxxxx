,fishboy11,2012-11-01T23:58Z,"wtf, why would a 100 meg download matter anyway, anyone who is going to use steam is going to have to download gigs of data anyway to get their games so why the fuck would they care about an offline installer"
,brega10,2012-11-02T01:55Z,I'd like to find a way to play my steam powered games without having to connect to the steam client. 
,ricco_pr,2012-11-02T02:08Z,if this is just to have steam and doesnt have any other use then this is kinda of a waste tbh

,nick555,2012-11-02T22:29Z,"I tried this torrent; it totally works, as said by the uploader. The .rar archive contains a folder named steam and a .txt file for instructions. So it is not a trick.
By the way, this was a great solution for me, given that I got F1 2012 from my friend and had it installed on my computer without steam, and given my limited internet monthly quota -which I have to share with my 2 brothers, I did not want to install the steam client, which in turn will consume much of my monthly quota. 
For that, I only wanted steam to add my f1 game and not to use it for downloading large games and consume my quota.
My advice is that this is not necessary for those who will use steam for large downloads, but it is a good idea to have a copy of it, so you will not need to wait for it to download and install by the regular method each time you want to install it on a certain computer."

,SadEntity,2012-11-19T23:05Z,"Just logged in to say thank you Mr. Anonymous. Worked so fine for me with COD Black ops II in addition to this crack
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7838845/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_II_crack_fix_v2.0_
I want to add that i had a problem with running this steam program from program files (x86) as the instructions say. But i just copied the steam folder to the root of drive C and it worked fine.
Thanks again for the uploader and seeders."
