,seveneyes333,2012-11-03T07:42Z,Thanx so much. I often wonder how shows that are on free TV sometimes take longer to post than premium channel shows. I wait and wait for this and another show every Friday.... YOU ROCK!

,anli09ab,2012-11-03T07:55Z,uploading at 600kbs and downloading at 3kbs - doing good deeds is not quite as rewarding online...
,jibbajabbax,2012-11-03T08:02Z,"yah?  try 15.5GB uploaded and 243MB downloaded, although in this case the majority is caused by Strajow's slow upstream, I believe"

This man just renaming files and put his name to these files like the capper.Pathetic.

and the file 200ms oos, if using VLC just hit the ""K"" key 4 times and that will sync it.
I'm 100% sure this noob didn't even knew it."

,jibbajabbax,2012-11-03T08:09Z,"(and uploading to the wrong peers, like the australian peer that has 1.5% more than anyone else)"
,jibbajabbax,2012-11-03T08:11Z,renaming files rescued from the cesspit of the pay-for-download or 'free download at 10 kb/s' sites?  works for me.  i don't give a flying shit.
,plockness,2012-11-03T08:19Z,seed fuckers!!!!
,ChronicPirate04,2012-11-03T08:21Z,"thanks... and @Nimh  The pink haired guy is the same as the other seasons... they put a retard in the house to piss everybody off.. he's way worse then Chris Leben even. And there's no excuse except for just shitty genetics. No bad upbringing could make a kid that dumb. He claims to have ""had it hard"" but no doubt you would have it hard if you're a attention craving, pink haired, gomer pile. Fuck him."
,Hoirc88,2012-11-03T08:35Z,Extremely slow download but hopefully the quality will be worthy.
,mbonaci,2012-11-03T08:51Z,"Skull for Strajow.
I love you man!"
,mbonaci,2012-11-03T08:55Z,"Of course it's slow when 3k leechers suck a couple of seeders. No surprise there.

,mibmib007,2012-11-03T11:04Z,skip this one so out of sync
,You_Muppet,2012-11-04T11:34Z,"Playing on VLC the sound was out of sync, but it was OK on windows media player. Ta"
,Strajow,2012-11-04T23:29Z,"@jibbajabbax first of all you never uploaded any where close to 15 gig you liar, and how about you upload some files people actually want before running off at your mouth like some keyboard warrior. I will continue to upload whatever I please before other uploaders do it for the people whom appreciate getting things just a bit earlier :)
It's funny how much you whinge and bitch yet you still downloaded the file? You never seeded once you were done, so therefor you added to the slow speeds but still had the audacity to complain? haha IMBOCILE! Im not here for skulls, im here to upload for the people, I dont claim to have encoded any files I upload, and pmsl at your 10 kb/s' sites remark. Im pretty damn sure i get faster download speeds than that, you little lost soul.. 

anyway thanks to all who seeded and enjoyed the ep. Haters gonna hate,  Peace :)"
