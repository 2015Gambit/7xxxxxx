For one we aren't allowed to have so many extra trailers.  Probably because our roads are so clogged as it is.  And the turning radius must be damnd crazy.  

Another difference I have noticed is that our trucks usually have high-speed internet through 3g or 4g lte and some of them have Satellite TV.  Doesn't look like you guys have them much.  Or at least they don't show them on the show.  I would go insane without Something to get me through the day when your on a layover.

The one poor bastard that took 45 days to get to his drop off, I really feel for him.  2 weeks out and I get pissy."
