The Martial Art Of Ancient Greeks
ISBN : 960-7931-72-6          published by eleftheri skepsis (free thinking) 
    If you like that e-book buy the original one.
This book from Mr. L. Savvidis is about the research he made which proves that pagration was the first martial art, and the fact that all martial arts coming in one way or another from pagration. Also he was responsible for the scientific research for the renew of pagratio athlima, the modern version of ancient Greek pagration.
 I have to point out in the original pagratio athlima the athletes are wearing a white-blue overall (not the black ones that at FILAΓÇÖs bad copy are used) and all rules and orders are in ancient Greek language, not in English or any other language.
 I did not scan the hole book in purpose, there are much more information in the original one, I just scanned the main body. This book is the second publish and I know that a third one with much more information and material is on the way.
