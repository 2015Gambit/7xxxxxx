@chris, if you want to use your gamepad, use xpadder, worked ok for me, but using splitfish mode (Gamepad + mouse) is better."

,levin123,2012-11-15T09:58Z,"vaibhav12345, maybe this is related about windows 8. i am using windows 7 and so far there is no issue.
i believe that windows 8 might be prevent it to play the 007 game due to some security update from the windows 8. the reason why i'm unable to play shadow run game on windows vista sp1 + 2 and window 7 but the game is playable on windows sp2 or the earlier version.

hope this information is useful for u."
,levin123,2012-11-15T11:38Z,vaibhav12345: i mean windows xp sp2
