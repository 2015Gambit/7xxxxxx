Shades (ITV 2000) 6 part series DVD Rip aac x264 mp4


starring Dervla Kirwan & Stephen Tompkinson

A Drama/Romance of life after death. Produced by ITV in 2000.
(according to wikipedia it has not been broadcast in Britain, and 

the DVD case notes says "seen on public television" with no mention 

of beeing on ITV. So I assume it has not been seen in Britain. 

According to IMDB, it had an alternate working title in Britain of 

"Hereafter", and its USA broadcast 1st dates were in autumn 2001.
