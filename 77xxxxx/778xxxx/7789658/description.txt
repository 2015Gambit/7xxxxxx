Heatwave was an international funk/disco musical band featuring Americans Johnnie Wilder, Jr. and Keith Wilder (vocals) of Dayton, Ohio, Englishman Rod Temperton (keyboards), Swiss Mario Mantese (bass), Czechoslovak Ernest "Bilbo" Berger (drums), Jamaican Eric Johns (guitar) and Briton Roy Carter (guitar).

They were known for their successful songs "Boogie Nights", "Always and Forever", and "The Groove Line".

While I was a bit too young to be into HEATWAVE, as I came into adulthood I remember all too well my older siblings listening to HEATWAVE and now have quite and appreciation for their songs/music.

Here I have compiled all of their albums for you all to enjoy.

As always keep the music alive by continuing to seed FOREVER...or at least as long as you can
