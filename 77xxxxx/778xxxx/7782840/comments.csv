,gandles,2012-11-02T00:26Z,why is this update almost 10g?
,Kuttlu,2012-11-02T00:54Z,"For fuck sakes,give us the fucking update only you god damn bastardo.do we have to download all this slow shit,then reinstall all game just for update?Fucking nonsene in the earth..."
,russianhornybear,2012-11-02T01:00Z,"must be 2gb or so ,why 10 ?O_O
update with game?"
,OmniNegro,2012-11-02T01:04Z,"9.4GB for an update?!? How big was it officially if you bought the game? That would be beyond unreasonable in my never humble opinion.

I hope someone can find a way to either shrink this mess to a patch instead of replacement files, or that someone makes a new release of the game prepatched.

Either way, thank you T.F.K."
,sixor,2012-11-02T01:45Z,"stop whining fuckers

sleeping dogs updates have weird protection, so they must replace all files

buy original on steam fuckers"
,Kuttlu,2012-11-02T01:47Z,"This not only the patch,thats a fucking whole game to download...useless years longs torrent"
,Shidopie,2012-11-02T02:18Z,I believe this includes the new DLC.
,Militance,2012-11-02T04:19Z,"@sixor
 Your vocabulary shows large about your inteligenge... you talk to everyone like that? you kiss your mother with that mouth? what a nice human being you must be, I for one dont enjoy being called a fucker do you?"
,Militance,2012-11-02T04:23Z,"and for the rest... I mean all you products of incest who enjoy insulting people for free over the internet, i doubt you act like that on the street...but i admit it must be exilarating to insult someone without getting your ass kicked."
,MacPain_,2012-11-02T05:27Z,"FINALLY this game works for me! So if you have had problems getting it started like me. Download this!
And guys. This includes ALL updates. And the reason for why it's so big is because the update need to rewrite all old files. You cant just add some new files, you need to ""rewrite"" the entire game."

,ArchieA,2012-11-03T04:55Z,Anyone please Confirm if this really has the DLC's? i just want the Nightmare in Northpoint... and Does it have the previous updates?
,OmniNegro,2012-11-03T06:27Z,"Sleeping Dogs v1.7 Update info:

This update closely mirrors that of the recent console update and adds support for the Nightmare in North Point DLC in addition to several bug fixes and a few new features.

Feature Updates

- Aim-assist Option - A new option exists in the Game & Controls menu to enable/disable the auto-aim feature that assists the player in locking onto enemies while using guns.
- .40Cal Gun Unlock - Upon completing the main story missions and returning to any safehouse, the Golden .40Cal pistol will be available.
- Increased Daytime - Daytime should now last noticeably longer, but night time duration should remain the same (increasingly the real-time duration of the in-game 24hr cycle).
- Disable GPS Arrows Option - A new option exists in the Game & Controls menu to disable the in-world GPS arrows that indicate where to turn when navigating to a destination.
- In-game DLC Store Access - Wherever the user can see the infoticker while in-game (wardrobe, clothing & vehicle stores, garage, pause menu) there will be a button callout to open the Steam DLC store in-game.
- New Super-SWAT Outfit and Supercharged Police Cruiser unlocks â&#x20AC;&#x201C; For owners of the Police Protection Pack, the Super-SWAT outfit and the supercharged police cruiser vehicle will become available. Owners of the Dragon Master Pack will receive this as well. "
,OmniNegro,2012-11-03T09:15Z,"The actual NFO contains this too. It answers your question ArchieA. But you probably still want the newer patch too just to help it since not all the DLC works as this is.

""Use Launcher.exe, included with the cracked content, for setting the language of your choice. 
You don't need to have any of the previous updates installed, as this update is featuring all previous updated content. ""

And here is the link to the tiny patch that fixes this to have working DLC. It is half a megabyte.

,Tercian,2012-11-08T18:34Z,"Well I followed every step of the installation.

First start I got binkw32.dll error.

Google and downloaded from a site put the .dll into the game dir.

That fix the binkw32.dll error and I was able to start the game.

After missing around in the option menu I was ready to start playing.

When I chose to start a new game the game just freeze a the loading nothing happening.

So i came back here to see if some one else got the same issue as me.

,vatel88,2012-11-10T16:43Z,"@Rosloyoy5 and any other moron who cant open a bin file and call this torrent broken because you're too stupid to learn what a bin file is gtfo you waste of space and air. I have no idea what a .bin is and in the first 5 seconds of google'ing i find the answer and you claim to have spent 2 hours and not find anything ?! are you retarded or just impatient like a 12yo child? 

5 seconds of searching and i found this http://voices.yahoo.com/how-open-bin-file-710387.html?cat=15 

If you can t learn from this basic info stop using downloading things and just buy it you lazy morons!"

Download game, extract last rar/zipped file in game folder to a folder of choice. than double click the exe setup file, wait till it completes.

Download BINKW32.dll from link in comment: go to uTub3 and link is in comment of vid

paste in game directory eg: C:/prog files/Squar enix/ sleeping dogs/ paste inside here..

copy all contents of skidrow folder from extracted content, and paste same location as BinkW32.dll (game directory).

From control panel go to firewall, advance settings, inbound rule, new rule, select program, browse to game directory eg C:/prog files/Squar enix/ sleeping dogs/ and select HKship.exe, then select BLOCK. If while playing Antivirus asks, select block also.

Run game by clicking Launcher.exe, always choose language and click play. 

Officially this worked for me, therefore torrent is purely functional.....! thanks uploader.."
