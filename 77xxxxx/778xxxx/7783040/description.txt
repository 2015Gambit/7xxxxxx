A documentary that captures the greatest world record Tetris players as they prepare for the Classic Tetris World Championship. From the days of Thor Aackerlund and his historic victory at the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, right up to the present and Harry Hong's perfect "Max-Out" score, this documentary expertly chronicles over two decades of Tetris Mastery.

I couldn't find an HD copy of this documentary anywhere but on a streaming site, so I decided id share it via torrent as its better than nothing...

Really awesome movie! excuse the quality and format. (.flv)

Open with VLC if you have any trouble seeing it.
