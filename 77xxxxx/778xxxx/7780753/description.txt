Video2Brain - Dynamic Dreamweaver Websites - Creating Login Areas

An important but little-understood concept in dynamic web development is that of role-based logins. This allows different types of users to access different parts of the site; for example, basic users can access customer areas of the site, while administrators can access administrative areas. In this course from Adobe Certified Expert Candyce Mairs, youΓÇÖll learn to use DreamweaverΓÇÖs features to create role-based logins, restrict page access, build an administrator area, and test everything to make sure it works. YouΓÇÖll also see how to set up a development environment and work with a database from within Dreamweaver. Along the way youΓÇÖll build your skills in areas like working with PHP, adding form validation, using server behaviors, and much more.
