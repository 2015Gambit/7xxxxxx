                         DESCRiPTiON  

  Britains much-loved car show Wheeler Dealers returns to your screens as turbo 
  marvels Mike Brewer and Edd China show viewers how to buy the right car at the 
  right price, fix it up on a budget, and make a nice profit. This time around 
  there will be even more action as each hour-long episode focuses on the 
  renovation of one vehicle. Discovery Real Time is also stepping things up a 
  notch and shooting the series in HD for the very first time!

 Still armed with 5,000 cash, the used car dealing duo will be searching the 
 country for the best bargains to be had. Whilst Mike checks out local ads and 
 internet auctions negotiating top deals, Edd will be in the workshop  
 transforming the vehicles with crafty second-hand parts. (Source: Discovery
