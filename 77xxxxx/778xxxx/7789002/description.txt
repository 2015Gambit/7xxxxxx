Assume the Position with Mr. Wuhl is a 2 part comedy and documentary show on HBO. It stars actor Robert Wuhl. The show looks at the facts and myths of American history in a comedic view.

The first part of the series debuted in 2006. In this edition Wuhl "Assumes the Position" that History is Pop Culture. He discusses topics such as the real story behind Paul Revere's Midnight Ride, first sentence of the U.S. Constitution being a "grammatical fuck-up", and how he believes that "star fucking," or the phenomenon of the U.S. public becoming infatuated with celebrity figures, and "gay battle cries" are "as American as apple pie."

In part two, which debuted in July 2007, Wuhl "Assumes the Position" that History is Based on a True Story. This time he talks about the lack of diversity among the U.S. Presidents, how lousy leaders are as American as apple pie, and his class plays "Real or No Real" determining whether various food icons, such as Chef Boyardee and Aunt Jemima, were real people.
