But can you do it in 480p format"
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-02T12:03Z,"orrazib:

I tend towards the smaller - I've dabbled with 272p - 480x272 is right for some small devices and looks surprisingly good on my 32"" 1080 monitor.

MSD does wonderfully small 480p (MKV).

I personally don't think 480p is any more rational than 400 or 352. HBO (which can safely be deemed ""professional"") likes 544. Likewise, one might assume ABC had their resons for choosing 432. Curious to note that both choose their x264/AAC in an FLV package instead of MP4. There has to be a reason why professionals toyed with MP4 for awhile and then dumped it.

Take a look at the ""description"" for my post of Dexter.S07E03 (or any of my fare for that night). After the particulars, I do a little math. From that, I see that 720 turns a square of four pixels into 1 360 pixel. And 1080 turns a square of nine pixels into 1 360 pixel.

Going halfway between sizes simply does not interest me.

But thanks for asking!
