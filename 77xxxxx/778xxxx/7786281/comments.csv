pretty good for a cam, it's watchable. some scenes a little too dark but overall a very good cam copy.

Thanks again!!"

when i put to download

,jleonard71,2012-11-05T19:00Z,@caine123 - That's cuz it was a FAKE. 
,qdjallah,2012-11-08T06:27Z,that DVDRIP was a fake. I will check this out. looking to be frightened for once.
,wtfguydotnet,2012-11-09T01:14Z,"The video quality is an abomination...
the worse iv ever seen. not woth the 1+ gig download. Iv seen dvd rips that where 580 megs with better quality than this... :("
,Seritath,2012-11-13T02:45Z,"In relation to wtfguydotnet:

Video quality of this torrent (for a cam) is insanely high quality for what I have seen. There is very little pixelation, and the only problem with the image I find is the lighting. This however seems to be shared with cams, and until the DVDrip comes out will remain an issue.

Audio quality is fair, though the headphones I am using are not of high caliber, so I would not know the acute quality.

Over all the torrent, for a cam, is very good. It is clear what is going on, it is easy to hear, and there's very little, not any that I could really notice, camera movement. All in all, the torrent is good, and in no way a fake.

Well worth the download for a cam movie. If you're going to download, disregard wtfguydotnets comment, as apparently he has some magical device that turns cams into perfect quality videos, to be complaining about the quality of this."
,nadith,2012-11-13T20:34Z,sick horror movie! this quality is watchable but if you want a better one check filmseed.rdsok.com worked better for me.
