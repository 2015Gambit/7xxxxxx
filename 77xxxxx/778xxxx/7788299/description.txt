Since the advent of synthetic drugs, the use of natural products has diminished. However, the diversity of natural molecules still surpasses those from synthetic compounds, and this ensures that natural products will continue to be important for drug discovery. Besides, many of the currently used synthetic drugs have side-effects and often expensive. While there are several books on natural drugs, this volume covers multiple curative aspects of natural chemicals. It is a complete review of medicinally active metabolites produced by nature and looked at from different approaches. The book describes the effects of natural extracts and/or their isolated compounds and also gives an update of their modes of action, production and commercialisation.
