Unfortunately, I only do encodes for shows that I watch. I also just don't have the space and bandwidth to do many shows like the scene groups do, sorry. :(

I do watch Dexter, but I don't encode that one since I've been happy enough with the oddly oversized 550mb rips. I say oversized because if you do the math vs a shorter length, 350mb show, Dexter is around 87mb bigger than what is needed. :P So that extra bit of quality is why I don't do encodes for that one. Anywho... :)

Cheers!"
