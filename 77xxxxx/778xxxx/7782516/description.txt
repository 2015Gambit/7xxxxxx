After a tremendous succeess with our 1st SAS program we return to the Scandinavian carrier of a transatlantic crossing on the widebody Airbus A330! The 2 pilots on this program which runs more than 4 hours long! give you all the information you want about the aircraft, the route, oceanic crossings and much much more!

This is a wonderful occasion to follow a flight to the US as we fly into busy Newark International Airport. You will see some of the traffic as we taxi for takeoff including a go-around and more presentations by the pilots on the overnight return crossing to Stockholm.

Also included is a detailed cabin presentation by the flight attendants and a look at the superb inflight service of SAS!

Enjoy!
