Peter Tosh with Word Sound & Power
Jaap Eden Hal
Amsterdam Holland
July 4, 1979

Master audience stereo recording by Hans "Madtaper" de Vente*.
(Recorded on top of the sounddesk)
Original transfer by Madtaper: Cassette > Nakamichi Dragon > Audacity > WAV > FLAC.

(Downloaded as two flac files: side one and side two)
Slightly re-EQed, volume levels smoothed, pitch correction: 'side one' +2.5%, 'side two' +3.2%; 
Burial still has some very noticeable tape fluctuations;
volume level at the start is quite full: some bass distortion--but you will feel the bass!)
