Ekkehard Holzbecher - Environmental Modeling: Using MATLAB (2nd edition)
Published: 2012-01-10 | ISBN: 364222041X | PDF | 429 pages

The book has two aims: to introduce basic concepts of environmental modelling and to faciliate the application of the concepts using modern numerical tools such as MATLAB. It is targeted at all natural scientists dealing with the environment: process and chemical engineers, physicists, chemists, biologists, biochemists, hydrogeologists, geochemists and ecologists. MATLAB was chosen as the major computer tool for modeling, firstly because it is unique in it's capabilities, and secondly because it is available in most academic institutions, in all universities and in the research departments of many companies. In the 2nd edition many chapters will include updated and extended material. In addition the MATLAB command index will be updated and a new chapter on numerical methods will be added.
