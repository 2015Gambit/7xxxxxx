,clicktemp,2012-11-03T15:49Z,"can it be any slower? im downloading at 0.1kb/s wtf...
thank you asaharaya though :)"
,asaharaya,2012-11-03T19:02Z,"@clicktemp: This is the 1st torrent I uploaded, so I have no idea how slow or fast the connection might be. However I uploaded it at the highest bit rate available, according to my torrent client setting (I use utorrent); but maybe something was not right with the setting.

Does anybody know how to make better upload and faster download out of it?"
,clicktemp,2012-11-03T20:17Z,"no clue... its been downloading for the past 9 hrs and i just reached 50%
I'm uploading at 100kb/s... yet downloading between 0.1 and 0.6 on average kb/s"
,ZSHAKAZ,2012-11-03T22:54Z,"That's because noone has completed it yet and whoever you seeded it for on the begining, is not seeding back"
,Kails88,2012-11-04T21:32Z,Can someone please seed this? It won't even start! :( But thank you so much for uploading!
