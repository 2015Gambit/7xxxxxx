,Raiyan14,2012-11-04T13:01Z,It's obviously true that you have done a very good job. And you are doing but you are really missing best artists. Do u take any suggestions?
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-11-04T15:08Z,"Raiyan14, it's always nice to know someone is available to tell me I'm doing something wrong. And someone who obviously doesn't follow my posts otherwise you would know that I do indeed take requests. I encourage them actually."
,Raiyan14,2012-11-04T16:41Z,@TorrentTracts I didn't tell that  you are doing something wrong. I myself downloaded at least 50 torrents of yours and seeded them. I also told about you to my friends.
,Raiyan14,2012-11-04T16:50Z,"If you don't mind, can you upload The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Lostprophets, Trapt, Seether and Hey Monday Discography. Am I asking too much?"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-11-09T16:21Z,"Raiyan14, I've never heard of any of those bands. Are they Christian?"
