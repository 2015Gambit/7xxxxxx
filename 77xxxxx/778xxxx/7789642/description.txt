- Insert the DVD into the drive. Press 'Install' in the "AutoRun window
  appeared on your screen. Then, follow the installer instructions. If you
  have "AutoRun" off on your computer, open the root folder on the disk and
  run "autorun.exe".
- Once you've installed the game, press the "Required Software" button in
  the "AutoRun" Menu and make sure you have the required software installed
  on your computer. If you have the required software installed on your
  computer, the appropriate menu item will be grayed.

Note! If the "AutoRun" menu does not work properly on your computer, enter
the "Utopia" folder on the disk and run "installer.exe"
