                           DESCRiPTiON 
                          
 We travelled deep into the heart of South Wales, to the quiet and picturesque 
 rolling countryside known as The Valleys to find nine youngsters are currently 
 dreaming of escaping their boring lives.

 "The Valleys: A septic tank of brainless smut that makes The Only Way Is Essex 
 look like Shakespeare (Mirror)"
 
 "It makes Mark Wright's Hollywood Nights look like Downton Abbey! Viewers 
 outraged as The Valleys premieres with nudity, beach romps and peeing in 
 public (Dailymail)"
 
 p.s there is subtitles they maybe or maybe not be fully in sync, like it or
 lump it! 
      
                                 Enjoy!
