,general_monash,2012-11-12T14:25Z,"unopoleco, you are the best. A thousand thanks."
,M1991M,2012-11-12T15:22Z,"Hej unopoleco

Kommer afsnit 7 snart p책?
Begynder lidt at frygte at der ikke kommer flere afsnit fra din side"
,lewek2001,2012-11-12T20:58Z,"Episodes 7 and 8 are on youtube. Why not here? :( Watching it without subs is a torture...Please, people, have mercy..."
,gnawzguz,2012-11-13T13:49Z,"I couldn't help commenting it.
Any problem with the episode 7?
"
,flamesong,2012-11-13T15:00Z,Episodes 7 and 8 are on TV Torrents but there are no English subtitles.
,Pinky_,2012-11-13T17:41Z,"You can dl the S03E07 on kickasstorrent.fr Although, it says 0 seeders, it works perfectly. "
,Pinky_,2012-11-13T17:52Z,"Sorry, for the link, it's k...torrents.com
I can't write it entirely, it won't be publish, i don't understand why. i'm a nooby :/"
,clubsoundz,2012-11-13T18:58Z,"English subs please for episode 7 and 8!!! 
What's the point of uploading episodes 1 to 6 if you are not uploading the rest of the series????
Come on Unopoleco,we really appreciate your uploads,please continue with the rest of season 3."
,Lucas2121,2012-11-13T19:32Z,"Some of you guys have to realize that unopoleco isn't the one compiling the subs. At the moment, the guy who's been making the subs - IceHunter - hasn't made subs for e07 never mind e08.
As soon as subs are available, unopoleco puts the episode up within an hour or two normally."
,neds333,2012-11-13T19:35Z,theres no episode 7 because theres no english subtitles for ep 7 anywhere! thats why theres no more episodes yet & the kickass torrent is danish only
,clubsoundz,2012-11-13T22:28Z,Thanks for the info Lucas2121
,bambihust,2012-11-14T02:57Z,"And so, IceHunter we are waiting for you! English subtitles, please!"
,icek00l,2012-11-14T14:18Z,"yes indeed, really hope to see ep 7 + soon, thanks very much"
,edroonieoffice,2012-11-14T16:47Z,"Isn't the problem that people do not realize, that it is a user that in his own time (for free), manually is translating all speech in the episode in order to compile the subtitles. As far as I am aware, they are not even available in danish, so a quick and dirty Google Translate is not even possible. Instead of waiting for Icehunter, somebody else could offer to do this job instead of complaining."
,clubsoundz,2012-11-14T18:05Z,"edroonieoffice i was not complaining, but basically stating a point which i think everyone including yourself are free to make. I even acknowledged my appreciation for the last 6 uploads!"
,airlocked,2012-11-14T18:47Z,"I don't know if this works for shows in other languages, but with all YouTube videos with English dialogue, a rough computer-generated transcript is automatically generated (with timecodes, I believe), and you can download it from your video manager. If it works for Danish, maybe someone who knows both languages can get a copy and make a quick, dirty version for those of us who are super desperate...? 
/So, so desperate..."
,edroonieoffice,2012-11-14T23:05Z,"clubsoundz: I was not targeting anyone in particular, but I see all to often in comments that some users do not appreciate the work of the release group."
,edroonieoffice,2012-11-14T23:12Z,airlocked: How does that work? When I watch edisode 7 on YouTube there are no subtitles.
,airlocked,2012-11-15T02:00Z,"edroonieoffice: sorry, I'm probably not explaining this very well... okay, so when I login to my YouTube account and click on one of our videos, there's an option to manage captions, and by default, there's always an automatically generated English transcript in there, which I can download or delete or whatever. So when the user clicks on the video, there's a CC icon, and even though we didn't put it there ourselves, viewers always have the option to see captions in English. The speech recognition can be kind of terrible, but with an actual human reviewing it so they can translate it into another language, they should be able to figure out whatever the actual line was, based on context and so forth. So, if this happened on the back end of Danish video uploads too, I thought it might help save a step..."
,edroonieoffice,2012-11-15T11:05Z,"airlocked: Ok, I have just never seen this, but I also do not have a YouTube account, so I guess that is a requirement."
,bambihust,2012-11-15T16:24Z,"Hey guys,

What about a fundraising for having the subtitles for the rest of the serie? What do you think IceHunter and Unopoleco?"
,sinabro,2012-11-17T00:39Z,aoeu
