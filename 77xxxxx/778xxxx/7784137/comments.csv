,Camo_Killer8,2012-11-02T13:43Z,how do u change to english
,chrisroberts2,2012-11-03T01:33Z,This game totally sucks. NO PC WINDOWS GAMEPAD SUPPORT!!!!! HELLO???? ITS 2012!!! FIX IT PLEASE. 
,JJames187,2012-11-03T14:09Z,"hey guy, mouse and keyboard are the shit and always will be. It's 2012, get your shit together."
,Rafal83,2012-11-03T17:45Z,"I agree with JJ its a PC game what do you expect, if you need to use a gamepad like a noob then stick to consoles."
,chunkylover69,2012-11-03T17:59Z,The game is only in Russian :(
,a.azcaban,2012-11-03T19:16Z,"To enable English text, type ""regedit"" and search ""007 legends"".  Change the language field to ""1"" English from ""6"" Russian.  I still haven't figured out how to enable the English voice dialogue.  Perhaps that is why this torrent is much smaller than the others."
,ilco92,2012-11-04T15:24Z,Work work woek... Yes Thanks :)
,The_stuntmanAZ,2012-11-05T04:28Z,Anyone figured out how to change the language? Regedit was too vague to figure out
,DeathNimrod,2012-11-05T11:03Z,"@chrisroberts2 @JJames187

Go back to xbox."
,poopertown,2012-11-06T22:34Z,"changing the regedit value from 6 to 1 works and changes the text to english. If you speak Russian you are in luck. Makes no sense, i know, but go to the DATA folder and replace every RUS in the files with USA then start the game you will now have RUssian dialogue....but how to get english i dont know"
