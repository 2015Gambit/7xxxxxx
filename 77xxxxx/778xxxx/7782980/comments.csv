,Siefer21,2012-11-02T03:35Z,can we get iphone 5??
,Siefer21,2012-11-02T03:36Z,and a good site to register a UDID... as to many ones i have used in the past have been shut down.
,lmftmf,2012-11-02T03:41Z,"http://imzdl.com/

Ive registered there myself but theres a trick to use it without the activation http://www.jailbreaknation.com/install-ios-6-beta-4-without-a-developer-account-or-udid"
,Siefer21,2012-11-02T04:14Z,"cool thanks. I think IMZDL might not be doing anything anymore due to the ""trouble"" they are in. Im guessing apple got ahold of them. Anyways will you be able to upload iphone 5's 6.1 beta? and if so ETA? thanks in advance."
