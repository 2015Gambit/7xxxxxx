,Dimmis80,2012-11-01T11:27Z,Gondy if u see yesterdays games 31/10 i swear that there is a game Lakers vs Portland there.I know about Lakers-Mavericks i watch it in my tv and stuff taking it from u.Anyways it might be with Clipers but i don't think so.In this site i did not look a lot because in the games i watch i hate to know the final score and stuff.??

LOL, now i got your point now. You are right!
Lakers vs trailblazers is on 31.10.2012
I've always confused on the date coz i live in +4 gmt (it means only 31st night in the US and it's already nov 1 here in our country). 
Actually, i'm still searching for lakers vs traiblazers & mavs vs jazz.
cheerss... :D"
