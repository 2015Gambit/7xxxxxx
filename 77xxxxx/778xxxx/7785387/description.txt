 Ion-exchange Technology I: Theory and Materials describes the             
   theoretical principles of ion-exchange processes. More specifically,      
   this volume focuses on the synthesis, characterization, and modelling     
   of ion-exchange materials and their associated kinetics and               
   equilibria.This title is a highly valuable source not only to             
   postgraduate students and researchers but also to industrial R&D          
   specialists in chemistry, chemical, and biochemical technology as well    
   as to engineers and industrialists.
