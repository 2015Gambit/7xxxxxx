,tomcruz,2012-11-04T19:00Z,"Mate, could you upload Rust and bone (2012) a french movie of Marion Cotillard. Pls. I've been waiting for a blue ray copy of this for a long time. Blue ray is just out. It is available at tpb, it is of 5.46 GB. I have low bandwidth, can't afford to download such a huge file. "
