KREATOR, just announced to release another 7ΓÇ£ single off the most recent, chart-breaking album, ΓÇ₧Phantom AntichristΓÇ£.

ΓÇ₧Civilization CollapseΓÇ£ will be released on 7ΓÇ£ vinyl (retail version: black ΓÇô cover1 // Nuclear Blast Mailorder only: red, yellow, white ΓÇô cover2) and as digital download on November 9, 2012 and will contain the super rare non-album track, ΓÇ₧WolfchildΓÇ£, which was released earlier this year on the JOHN SINCLAIR tribute sampler, ΓÇ₧Dark SymphoniesΓÇ£.

The band also made a video clip for ΓÇ₧Civilization CollapseΓÇ£ which is mainly about the riots that took place in Greece most recently.

While researching about said riots the KREATOR art direction team became aware of Marios Lolos, president of the Greek union of journalistic photographers. In the past Greek photographers have become victims to police brutality quite often, and Marios himself barely got out alive out of one these extreme and undemocratical attacks. When KREATOR showed Marios both song and lyrics, he immediately agreed participate by offering parts of his huge photographic archives.
