,Fozzibab,2012-11-02T17:15Z,"Thanks for the upload. It's frustrating, though. There are 1856 seeds on the torrent, and I'm connected to only 7 of them...and 30 peers of 13353. Why the fuck does this keep happening?

The download is going at a whole...1.6 kBps. What the hell?"

,insolentfool,2012-11-04T03:31Z,Did anyone else have problems running this in VLC? I have the latest version and can run everything else no worries. It crashes VLC after random amounts of time playing even if i skip bits. 
,insolentfool,2012-11-04T03:47Z,nevermind my client had an issue writing to my HDD so i only had 80% of the file downloaded. Restarted the torrent and its finishing off now. I am and idiot :)

Amazing quality, thank you BOZX"
,mikosci,2012-11-09T10:48Z,"Yea, seems like the commentary plays along with the movie audio on MPC. No way to change it thru Navigate>Audio Language cause its greyed out."
,SkeelZ91,2012-11-10T23:06Z,"just wanted to say, thanks for the upload. The movie was great, it's a must watch :) "
,saudsadiq,2012-11-16T18:38Z,"A question I am going to ask I hope no one minds ... Is this the swedish version or pure english version, I have downloaded many copys of this but until now I haven't been able to find the full english version of this film ... Please Reply ...."
,Inhabbit,2012-11-18T01:13Z,"V-10/10
A-10/10 (only used headphones.)
M-9/10 form a subjective point of view this is a children`s movie, but at some parts it's still pretty good even if you're an adult."
,SweetResilience,2012-11-24T08:36Z,18 thumbs up!! Great quality!
