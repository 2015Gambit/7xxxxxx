NVIDIA's nForce drivers have certainly come a long way since I took a look at the preproduction ASUS board that AMD used to launch their 333MHz CPUs some while back. As expected MSI have wrapped the drivers and utilities in their usual, friendly front end and driver installation went without a hitch I'm pleased to say.

There was a nice assortment of utilities available off the installation CD including apps for hardware monitoring, freeing memory, speeding cable modems and XDSL, viewing and configuring system settings and of course MSI's famed Live Update software. Also Trend PC-cilin antivirus software and assortment of other useful bits and bobs.

The "Website" tab contains links to a few of sites that you might need to get to including one that offers a free personal Firewall app.

While the "Manual" tab does as its name would suggest and links to the users manuals for Live Update 2 and GoodMem memory management software. There are also a couple of other useful little apps on the CD that don't appear here.

The Hardware monitoring software I mentioned is MSI's PC Alert 4 which does a nice job of displaying all the main info in a simple, easy to understand way.
