If you like this torrent, please, seed as much as you can, at least a ratio of 1 or better more. That will guarantee that this stuff will be available many years, 24 hours a day, for people to enjoy it. In addition, you will be able to redownload it in case you lose it, and I will be able to seed other newer torrents as well.
Sharing is caring! Enjoy and seed!
