Mega Mario is a Free Portable Super Mario Brothers clone. Upon review, Mega Mario looks and functions just like the original old school Super Mario Brothers. However it utilizes more levels, better graphics and can be played smoothly at a much higher resolution than the original game. Mega Mario worked well when launched and played directly from a portable USB Flash Drive.
