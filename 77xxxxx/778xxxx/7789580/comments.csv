,Taosinky,2012-11-04T05:34Z,"@russianhornybear : Exactly.

My PC is on my TV (104cm) and of course, i prefer mouse & keyboard combo for Multiplayer FPS (like Battlefield 3), but for other games or solo experience, i prefer to play with a pad. So much confortable. That's all.

For Mass effect 2, I didnt Try sorry, but the command was not exactly the same, so i guess you need to rebind some buttons of my profile. (;"
