Each available region is RAR compressed in the Torrent so that it is easier to pick and choose what you want to download. You can choose/not choose to download any or all that you like.

Every one of the regional installs included in the Torrent has been fully tested and found to be working completely at the time of publication.

Currently it is not possible to add your own maps...each regional installation provides for only the maps and data for that region....they cannot be 'mixed'.
You can add your own POIs by using the TomTom *.ovl/*.bmp files available at places like POI Plaza. Put any custom POI files on the SD Card in tomtomcom.tomtom.{region name}files{region map name}*.*
