,McSatama,2012-11-02T22:25Z,Skyfall where the sky is dead?
,michaelrwatson,2012-11-03T04:13Z,"A 'deadfall' is a pit with spikes in the bottom, to catch bears. See ""The Edge"" w/ Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins (that's a kickass flick). Not sure what ""deadfall"" has to do with this movie, but i' expect to find out shortly..!"
,Hitchslap79,2012-11-03T05:34Z,"@Michael, no it isn't. It's a large object that's triggered by a tripwire that falls on something."

,DodgeNeonRT,2012-11-03T23:23Z,You can tell from the screenshots the video quality is crap and it isn't a DVD rip. Wait for the real thing unless you're desperate.
,rightool,2012-11-04T01:39Z,"Fucking tired of all this wrong labeling! Wait for real scene release, boys and girls!"
,JarjarTwink,2012-11-04T03:51Z,"A8 V7. Great quality overall. 

shut the fuck up all you complainers. go have disgusting hetrosexual sex instead of complaining. 

it's watchable, wanna jerk off to the 1080p rip then wait, but don't fucking whine like a pig that has PMS."
,JimiCobain,2012-11-04T04:26Z,"Only in the last decade have people become so picky about how ""crisp"" the film looks on their screen, they expect everything to meet a blu-ray standard and be absolutely, astonishingly perfect. GET THE FUCK OVER IT.

Sure, Olivia's face in 1080p is worth it, they don't get much foxier, but this isn't The Avengers, this isn't some epic blockbuster where explosions and special effects take up half the film. The highest quality is not necessary, and not worth whinging over when there's a lack thereof, unless you have a massive stick up your ass. 

Eric Bana is worth watching this for, in any quality.
I've been waiting for this film, and I'm going to watch it in this quality, because films like this aren't for prissy perfectionists, they're for people who want a conveniently early viewing of this film to sit back and enjoy, as long as the video and audio is comprehensible, it's worth it.


You wanna wait months for a BluRay rip, go for it, but just remember, we saw this awesome film way before you because you were too busy being prudish, snobbish, spoiled little brats crying about your film quality.

Suck a sack, ya whining maggots."
,titus227,2012-11-04T04:32Z,"@ the trap guys-

Actually you are both correct and incorrect.  Both traps you described are deadfalls, but a deadfall is not so specific or limited.  A deadfall is any trap in which a weight is used, free falling or 'deadfalling' and the momentum created from the weight of the 'bear falling on spikes' or the 'big object falling' is what generates the force for the kill, whether it be impalement or simple blunt force trauma.  Additionally, the writer may not be referencing the trap at all, but suggesting that the character(s) life or lives in this story are in a state of 'deadfall', which suggests that their lives are moving quickly, inevitably and uncontrollably, probably toward some sort of dangerous event or person(s)."
,Fritz.,2012-11-04T07:54Z,"""go have disgusting hetrosexual sex""


lol, funniest comment ever."
,Shadeux,2012-11-04T10:41Z,"I'm with JimiCobain on this one. Who cares if it's DVD or even VHS quality. While you sit and watch your BluRay rip, don't mind us; we'll be watching the next great thing in ""poor"" quality. Great upload scene4all and PlayNow"
,JarjarTwink,2012-11-04T14:22Z,"@fritz

,creative_expansion,2012-11-04T14:29Z,"y do you people even bother to comment if you couldn't waste your time getting ""crappy"" quality movies! You should go wait months for the dvd and go buy it you whiny ass cunts! seriously who the fuck are you? either shut he fuck up and say thank you or go jerk off and wait for the dvd release."
