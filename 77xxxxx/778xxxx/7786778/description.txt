"The Hour of Death"

When a brutal vigilante homicide is 
made public, it sends Portlands 
Wesen community into a frenzy. As 
Nick investigates further, he 
discovers a pattern similar to that 
of a particularly brutal line of past 
Grimms. Is there another Grimm in 
town, or is Nick dealing with a 
sadistic copycat? Meanwhile, Captain 
Renard takes it upon himself to offer 
Juliette comfort in handling her 
ongoing dilemma with Nick.
