A cross-country tour of prisons and detention centers that are said to be haunted brings the team to West Virginia, Idaho, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. In short, this is nothing new; more like a "looking back on" episode. Might even be considered a special to some even though there's nothing special about this episode.

I just recaps myself.. espc if nothing new added.. just a waste of time and data

help to seed if grabbing else it will take much longer
