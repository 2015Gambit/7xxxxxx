,Mr.Quipster,2012-11-03T00:22Z,First. lol BRB for official review or torrent!
,dumbson,2012-11-03T02:19Z,your screenshots don't work
,Mr.Quipster,2012-11-03T02:59Z,"Well. AVG safe. 

Not exactly HD. When you have vlc restored down its fine. but when maximized and full screened. no. It becomes pixelated. 

A/V= 10/7 (video gets 7 because it isn't what the tittle claims it to be)

Thank you for your work nonetheless. "
,Mr.Quipster,2012-11-03T04:21Z,"Ignore my previous comment ^^

The video is just garbage. I'm thinking it's because of the person who did the ripping, his machine is inadequate for the job. There is a shiit load of lag and moments of audio not being synced with video.

Again, nonetheless, thank you for your work. But try again."
,jwilla09,2012-11-03T06:37Z,does this one have the day61 or whatever going through the screen in the beginning for about the first 20 minutes?
,Mr.Quipster,2012-11-03T07:36Z,Yes. It has a series of watermarks (Korean if I'm not mistaken) coming and going throughout the movie.
,jwilla09,2012-11-03T08:21Z,thanks mr.quipster i've been tryin to find one without the watermarks it doesnt ruin the movie but it is a little annoying..thanks again and thanks for the upload chris-aksel
,GambitWallstar,2012-11-03T09:14Z,Can't get past the stupid watermarks and the annoying lag... Don't bother downloading it'll just annoy you.
