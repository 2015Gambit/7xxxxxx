,rosumparat,2012-11-01T19:21Z,"I don't know what they did but the show is so unwatchable due to the god damn crowd cheering and screaming... you barely hear the judges comments and or singing. Are the sound editing guys sleeping? With so much noise going on, the show should be called ""Crowd Factor"". Seriously."

,superbass1919,2012-11-02T06:40Z,Great upload! I was wondering. Why are all the release of x factor episodes delayed? The other shows that are in its timeslot are uploaded yet x factor us episodes are always delayed. Thanks.
