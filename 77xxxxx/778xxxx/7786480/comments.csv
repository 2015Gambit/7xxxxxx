,keeganzo,2012-11-03T15:47Z,Hey scenebalance...luv the JJ ups...my dl speed is 50 kbps so it takes quite a while to get a single ep...is there any chance you can create smaller sized files for JJ? - that'd be awesome...hope so...thnx
,TWEETY2455,2012-11-03T17:09Z,why it is not streaming ?
,theo23rd,2012-11-04T15:26Z,"The torrents won't seed because scenebalance is cashing in on Pirate Bay and is now a PPV ""community."" Sickening."
,starburst9791,2012-11-04T21:48Z,What's that mean?
,RossPat,2012-11-05T01:08Z,"That means you got to go to a website, join up and pay money to get his torrents to download

NEVER, NEVER, NEVER going to happen"
,keeganzo,2012-11-05T01:56Z,go to scenebalance page...most of his vids are 0 seeders...I miss azy
,TWEETY2455,2012-11-05T02:09Z,"Anyone knows another way to get this up if not from scene?

It may be a little more trouble than PB but it's a whole lot better than paying a greedy loser like scenebalance, who really should be banned from PB and probably will be, once the moderators pick up on what's going on. The very spirit of open exchange that is the essence of PB is contaminated by this creep."
