This appears to be ripped Caballero's 2004 DVD release.
This movie was pretty much a vehicle for Juliet Anderson's "Aunt Peg" character. There's really not much of a plot here, just an excuse for massive sex. In this one, she's the producer of the next big adult movie and all the actresses want to star in it. They get plenty of opportunities to practice their "scenes" with two lucky friends who "happen" to be everywhere the girls are. The best scene is probably at the end when two movie critics (one being Linda Shaw) decide to create a new ending to the film. Worth a few laughs, but this is for "Aunt Peg" fans.
