This app installs bullshit AirPush adware that sends you spammy notifications every hour to ""SPEED UP YOUR ANDROID PHONE, CLICK ME CLICK ME NOW!!"" or ""Improve your battery life! Get BATTERY BASTARD PLUS for only $9.99 per second!!"". It too me a while to figure out which app was the culprit. Solution, uninstall it."

just go to About->Check the ""remove ads"" and that's it. no ads at all... "
