,Halloweenpsycho,2012-11-02T14:54Z,"Let make this as easy as possible..You know that thing you use to look at the web with..Callled a browser, the exact thing you are using to view this content right now...Yeah thats it...you see these nice shinny blue colored things below that start of with http: yep your getting warmer..Take that microphone looking thing in your hand, we call it a mouse..There is a left button a middle knob ""looks like a wheel for a volume control button from a walkman in the 80's"" and a right button..Now these press down and the middle one scrolls..o wait...forget that middle one exists..just take your hand and move that mouse and look at your screen on the tv..That little pointie thing..Yeah thats a pointer...Now you see how it moves..Ok now lets move it to those blue shinny letters down below..Remember the ones that start with http:..
Hold down that left button we talked about and move that pointer across those links and it will be pretty and shinny..now use that right button and press it down and you will see something that says copy..yep..thats it..use that left button and click it..now in your browser..this is called a tab..you will notice that there is something on this browser that say open a new tab...Now go to those wierd looking things up toward the very top of your screen..You will see some crazy writing up there..I know it look wiered but trust me..now use that pointer and lets open that new tab..so you have a blank window..you know with nothing on it..now that thing uptop that had those scarry demonic looking slang words...and then point that pointer to that space and then right click now and you will see paste..just left click on it now..and woah..thats some funky demon slang..now that thing in front of you with all those out of order letters and wild looking numbers..thats a key board..look for the buttong that has Enter written on it and press it..What what what!!! Were did thos magic pictures come from?"
