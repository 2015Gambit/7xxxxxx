IN THE GAME OF CRIME

A new trainee at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Lucy Kincaid has already seen more than her share of murder and mayhem. Still reeling from the sex-crime case that sealed her reputation, sheΓÇÖs found a true friend and mentor in Agent Tony Presidio. No matter what goes down at the Bureau, TonyΓÇÖs got her backΓÇöuntil heΓÇÖs called to New York to help investigate the murder of a reporter with ties to Lucy.

NEVER PLAY THE VICTIM

But the reporter may not be the first victim of a patient killer with a penchant for revenge, and sheΓÇÖs definitely not the last. Connections between closed cases, a missing person, and Tony himself lead Lucy to fear for those she cares for most.

But the harder she pushes for answers, the clearer the truth becomes: ThereΓÇÖs a killer inside Quantico. Watching her every move. Waiting to kill againΓÇª
