Po volunteers to train the Emperor's insecure and clumsy grandson Lu the skills of manhood to become a worthy member of the 
imperial family. After many failed attempts to train Lu, and under the threat of being executed for breaking promise, 
Po gives Lu a "magic" bean pod, which gives Lu a confidence. But when Po successfully trains Lu, Meng Tao who is the Emperor's servant, 
assigns Hundun to make sure Lu does not get trained, so he can take Lu's place. When challenged by Hungun and Meng Tao, Tao crushes the beans, 
and Po reveals that there is no secret behind them. Aware of his skills, encouraged Lu defeats Hungun and Tao, and becomes a worthy member 
of the imperial family.
