For some reason firefox won't let me download it from youtube as fast as I can get it from a torrent. Much thanks! This is an awesome series. Can't wait till tuesday for the midnight release of Halo 4.

Thanks again for putting them up here. "

[V],thetorrentlord,2012-11-03T21:42Z,Thanks for the entire series. Maybe this will be motivation for them to actually get around to making the movie that was proposed long ago. I can't imagine that it would not be a SUPER success.
