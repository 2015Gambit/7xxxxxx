The Shadow of the Torturer is a science fantasy novel by Gene Wolfe, published by Simon & Schuster in 1980. It is the first of four volumes in The Book of the New Sun, which Wolfe had completed in draft before The Shadow of the Torturer was published. It relates the story of Severian, an apprentice Seeker for Truth and Penitence (the guild of torturers), from his youth through his expulsion from the guild and subsequent journey out of his home city of Nessus.

In 1987, Locus magazine ranked The Shadow of the Torturer number four among the 33 "All-Time Best Fantasy Novels", based on a poll of subscribers
