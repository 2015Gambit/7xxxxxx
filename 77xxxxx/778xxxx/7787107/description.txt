Storyline

MR. BECHERA (Anil Kapoor) is a shy printer and, since the passing of his wife, a single father to his infant son--but his quiet life is shattered by the schemes of Dr. Dayanand (the one-and-only Anupam Kher), a medical man with techniques so unorthodox they border on complete lunacy. Dr. Dayanand has a beautiful amnesiac patient named "Asha" (Sridevi), and he wants Bechera to pretend to be her husband and the father of her child. The two couldn't be more mismatched, yet as time passes, they begin to rely on each other. The lies of the doctor, however, begin spiraling out of control, with both humorous and poignant results.
