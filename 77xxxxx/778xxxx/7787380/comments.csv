V/9 (Maybe a 10 but I can't tell if it's not perfect because of the fact it's kind of like a ""Cloverfield"" or ""Paranormal Activity"" movie)

M/8

Very entertaining movie. The plot looked decent, but the movie was a lot better than I expected. No, this movie is not based on a true story, though that would be pretty cool. The first 10 to 15 minutes are kind of bland so don't give up when first watching the movie. It's just an introduction to get you familiar with what's going on. Not your typical b-rated movie, for sure. IMDB gives it a 5.7 rating, but I would have given it at least a 6.7 rating for IMDB. Maybe up to 7.5. TY scene4all! Very much enjoyed this film!"

movie is a piece of shit though. "
,dlarrym1111,2012-11-09T16:53Z,"@xShadyImagex:
This truly isn't a criticism, but if you read about the producers and the directors, it was made by the same people that made the films, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY (which you compared it to), and INCEDIOUS.
I haven't watched it yet but with reviews of plot being from crap to a liitle above average, I'll give it a watch."

How was the movie?"
,Nil0liN,2012-11-10T23:15Z,Though its not base on a true story.. it is based on a REAL PARASITE...CYMOTHOA....so maybe it is based on a real life (fish life) occurence Let the google search commence
