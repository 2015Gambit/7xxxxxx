Dear Dave

Lister has women trouble when he gets himself in a love triangle with Snack 
Dispensers 23 and 34; then, to make matter worse, gets a letter from an old 
girlfriend telling him she's pregnant and it might be his. Lister and Rimmer 
hunt through the mountain of letters from the mail pod to discover if Lister 
is finally a dad.
