Meden Agan was formed in November 2005 in Paris, France by guitarist Diman Koutsogiannopoulos. Their first demo was released in April 2006 and received very good reviews and feedback. Their first full-length album, Illusions, was released in November 2007, and contained progressive metal songs with male vocals. During that period, the band shared the stage with bands like Pain Salvation, Skyclad
, Within Temptation, After All, Bloodtales, ETHS, and The Old Dead Tree.

After a one-year hiatus as Diman returned to Greece, Meden Agan started working on new songs featuring lyric leggero soprano vocalist Iliana Tsakiraki and a new keyboardist. Soon, they released their first EP, which was called Nemesis ΓÇô Promo 2010. This promo contained five progressive/symphonic metal songs with operatic vocals. The new line up was: Iliana Tsakiraki (vocals), Diman Koutsogiannopoulos (guitars), Tolis Mikroulis (keyboards), Aris Nikoleris (bass), and Panos Paplomatas (drums).

Meanwhile, Iliana was honored by participating in the recordings of the 2011 album The Great Mass by the Greek demons Septicflesh. She handled the operatic vocals on the song "Oceans of Grey" and also in the orchestral limited edition of The Great Mass for the songs "Pyramid God," "Oceans of Grey," "The Undead Keep Dreaming," and "Apocalypse".

Soon after, the band entered the studio in order to record their album Erevos Aenaon. The album will be released in September 2011. It was recorded at ARTemis Studios, and was produced and mixed by Mark Adrian (Elysion, Bare Infinity, Bob Katsionis). Before the release of the album, Panos was replaced on drums by Ploutarchos Tsouris. The album artwork and photo shoot were made by Seth Siro Anton (Septicflesh, Paradise Lost, Kamelot).
