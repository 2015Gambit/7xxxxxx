LaTeX is a document preparation system, that is used a lot in sciences and is generally considered the fastest and most professional way to write documents containing lots of mathematical equations or different languages"

,qskenzer,2012-11-04T02:18Z,"For the retards:

LaTeX is a document preparation system, that is used a lot in sciences and is generally considered the fastest and most professional way to write documents containing lots of mathematical equations or different languages. It is also very robust (handling very large documents easily). In LaTeX, input and output are split into different files."

,ClubQBall,2012-11-04T12:24Z,"Still ... common fucking courtesy on behalf of the individual who UPLOADED the torrent would usually prompt one to include a description.

Sheer laziness and apathy, in my opinion ... which is why I seldom download from those who can't be bothered to explain what they're uploading or sharing."
,ClubQBall,2012-11-04T13:58Z,"Um, GSPT?  You wrote this, correct?

""Yeah, google it if it's not here. How hard is that?""

And NOW you are asking this, yes? 

""Seeing as though there may be some academic-types here, anyone got Hyperresearch 3, pls?""

LMGDFAO.  You DO know what's coming next, right?

I got it at least. Thanks very very much to Kaktus66.
Well you want to know what it is...
Let me first told you an important story.
A very long time ago a man whose name is Knuth, the pope of computer science,  was looking for a soft who can help him to print awfully computer and mathematical formulas. He wrote the famous books named ""the art of computer science"".
As he didn't find, he conceive a marvelous program to print every thing you can want.
He call the program Tex.
AND he gives the program to every one who need it!
So today all print use his program. Chapeau bas!
As the soft is very hard you have now LaTex who help you.
I bought his books around 1970, wonderful books! And I was very pleased to use his program Tex with the Apple II I had!
Around the same time an other man create a soft of the same importance, but for mathematic, name Mathematica, he didn't share it and know he made a lot of money with it.
I think Knuth is the first of all of us! He makes me think. 
Perhaps you don't know, but he first show us the Way.
Share and cheers!

Sheeesh"
,kaktus66,2012-11-08T11:40Z,"Yes midorasan, you work 4 free and instead of getting a ""thx"" you get that "

,GSPT,2012-11-14T00:03Z,"Quess what ClubQBall, I did search and found nothing, which is why I asked. Now who's the moron?"
