,starkster,2012-11-07T02:46Z,STUCK AT 99%! what the hell. it was going fine and as soon as I hit 99% it stopped. What's going on here?
,ronnie.twist,2012-11-07T07:39Z,any1 finish this? mine just stuck at 99%
,starkster,2012-11-08T00:48Z,yeah seems like everyone has gotten stuck at 99.5%. I've been this way for 3 days now. A torrent that was DL'ing absolutely smoothly and fast but as soon as I hit 99% it stopped... and seems like all peers are in the same boat... something's not right here. I'm giving up on it. deleting it and deleting the file downloaded. 
,TechnoSam,2012-11-11T22:26Z,"No one has the full file! The most anyone has is 99.6% of the file. The original uploader needs to seed the file, at least for a little bit, or no one will be able to get it."
,welderch,2012-11-18T02:51Z,this torrent will not finish unless Crossboe allows us to seed the last .5 % I've been seeding for about a week and stuck at 99.5% along with 50 others :( kinda sux was looking forward to playing this game.
,Crossboe,2012-11-23T19:44Z,Ok I will re-upload it
,Crossboe,2012-11-23T19:59Z,"RE UPLOADED VERSION http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7854354
