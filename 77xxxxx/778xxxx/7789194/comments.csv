,anznation,2012-11-03T21:11Z,My first Torrent! Sorry for not ripping but since its the first nordic version available I thought it best not to. Enjoy!
,sven_svengali2,2012-11-04T16:23Z,"Good try and thanks for the effort bur there seems to be something wrong.
All I get is the intro sound and the occasional odd frozen picture.
Tried downloading twice with same result.
DVD-shrink finds nothing structurally wrong but presents only 5.9 gig size.
Anyone else got problems?"
,Cris69,2012-11-04T22:38Z,"Same thing, does not work???"
,anznation,2012-11-05T12:37Z,"Mount iso, right click the Video_TS folder and play with VLC. Hope that helps =)"
,sven_svengali2,2012-11-05T17:13Z,"Now well how´s ´bout I wanna burn it?
No can do! ´cause no burner can fix the problem.

Have you tried dowloading it yourself, dear uploader?

Your original on your hdd might be OK, but the gigabites that went through cyberspace aren´t!"

Using Virtual CloneDrive and CloneDVD."
,sven_svengali2,2012-11-06T20:46Z,"Well, CloneDvd 2.9.3.0 stopped after about 30 seconds and said ""can´t copy css-protected material"".
AnyDvd didn´t do shite to unprotect!!
Just black or green screen and a mix of random pixels is all I get."
,anznation,2012-11-10T16:11Z,"Sorry, Im of no help when burning the image, I have no experience with that. Good Luck Sven =)"
