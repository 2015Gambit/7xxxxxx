I'd rather stick broken glass up my japs eye than waste bandwith and brain cells watching such cuntshite. "

Perhaps if you watched the doc you would see it isn't just spouting a conspiracy, it's presenting factual evidence. If a man shot another man, and left blood and fingerprints everywhere, would you consider it evidence that he'd committed the crime? Of course you would. The same principal applies here. If you're a regular person I'd encourage you to at least give it a chance to show you the proof. If you're just another shill, I hope they pay you well. It's hard to put a price on Karma. Either way, your opinion won't count for much at all without considering any and all evidence. This doc is full of the stuff. This is my only response, I hope life treats you well BKKJack, and I mean that sincerely. Namaste"

Seriously...

Sort your head out and return to the human race...

It's obvious that 911 was an inside job entirely done by the bush and Cheney and their cronies."
,BKKJack,2012-11-04T09:30Z,"Sorry Stu. 

I also forgot about all that overwhelming evidence which also implicates Ronald McDonald...

Can you upload some of that wideawake?"
