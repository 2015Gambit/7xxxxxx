,dcrock32,2012-11-04T18:49Z,This isn't working for me. I am running lt 2.0 and did the topology patch. 
,Super-E,2012-11-05T16:14Z,Why dont u just upgrade to 3.0? Be alot easier to play new stuff
,dcrock32,2012-11-06T03:59Z,It's not really easier. Everything i have patched has worked untill this. I even upgraded to 3.0 once and not all games even run in 3.0 so i switched back. Been doing this for years.

,rajtalreja,2012-11-07T20:55Z,"hey I am going to buy another xbox360.
I would like to know wether i should make it jTag or LT3.0? what do you recommend, I dont play online and I never will.

Whats diff between jTag abd LT ?

I am buying new one because my current xbox is not loading it gets stuck on xbox logo and if i get hard drive out it shows nothing only black screen. so I am not sure what is wrong with it. anyone have any idea? please advise"
,jakenator,2012-11-08T07:01Z,@rajtalreja: If you dont play online then definitely Jtag/RGH your console. All a Jtag/RGH does is let you run games/XBLA from internal/external hard drive as were LT only lets you play from discs. You can also customized the shit out of your system. I got mine RGH and it cost me like $65 but trust me it was well worth it.
