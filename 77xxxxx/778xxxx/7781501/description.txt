The Come Up's creator and producer, Fendi, spent a year and some change on the low. Some thought the DVD game was dead and that The Come Up DVD had been buried. But it turns out five DVDs later, The Come UP DVD was only loading up the artillery and waiting patiently.

Back with an exclusive DVD from the hardest working trapper in the game, The Come Up DVD returns with this official 2 Chainz presentation to bring the people what they want: that T.R.U. to Life sh*t.

Working with 2 Chainz to bang out a DVD that Tity himself would feel proud to bring you, Fendi and 2 Chainz went back and forth to come up with the perfect COME UP and really serve the streets the way 2 Chainz has always wanted. Never before releasing an official DVD, 2 Chainz finally touches the TV screens with something official and worth the wait.

(This is the OFFICIAL Based On A T.R.U. Story DVD)
