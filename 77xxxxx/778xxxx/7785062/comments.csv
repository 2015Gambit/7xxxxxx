,IndigoAK,2012-11-02T18:55Z,Does the high res texture pack work with this crack?
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-11-02T19:19Z,yes
,chrisroberts2,2012-11-02T20:16Z,"Thanks for listening but its still a no go. Would it be too much to ask for:

Full final Sleeping Dogs 1.7 (Full game + All DLC:s Included and opened at start with North Point included  so everyone could share all the fun for once?  Cant someone create a click and play desktop icon for once? Or is that too much to ask for?"
,saidinho,2012-11-02T21:35Z,"works for me....,already finished it....,"
,EvilAsh34,2012-11-02T22:11Z,"This seems to be working fine for me. Actually this is the first set of DLC that actually works. Here's what game version i used and how i got it all working.

1. installed Sleeping Dogs 1.4 - Vansik Repack
2. Installed latest 1.7 update (including hotfix) by Skidrow.
3. Installed this DLC set and crack over what was included in update 1.7.

After i installed your crack every DLC now works (fucking finally!) and all seems well. Also, i have had zero crashes and no game start-up problems either. Thank you so very much for offering this because i thought it was a lost cause to ever get the DLC's running."
,chrisroberts2,2012-11-03T01:27Z,"Already that comment from EVILASH34 is enough evidence that something isnt right with this release. Either DLC is missing or the game wont start, take your pick! I wish somebody could do a repack with everything opened from the start. Fucking great game too that easily beats the shit out of the GTA games and funny! 
If someone have it fully opened, please make a click and play folder out of this awesome game, rar the shit if that helps just make it working/confirmed."
,OmniNegro,2012-11-03T04:07Z,"Sigh...

I am not convinced you read EvilAsh34's statement correctly. Let me sum it up. This works.

Read it again if you think I am being a jerk. I just think you read it a way that is not correct. Enjoy it or not. Your call."
,EvilAsh34,2012-11-03T06:30Z,"@OmniNegro

You are correct in your summation. This does indeed work. Very well in fact.

The only thing i can think of that he may be talking about is that maybe the initial ""full game"" releases of this game are screwed up and/or have non-working DLC. I've never had a problem with the Vansik Repack version i use but only one of the DLC's ever worked, even after the 1.7 update. It was only after i installed this DLC set that i finally got the other DLC's to work *at all* other than the Just Cause outfit. IDK though, all i can say is that this DLC set and crack does indeed work."
,OmniNegro,2012-11-03T09:10Z,"Coolness. It would be nice to have only one install rather than the full game and then the update that is the same size, followed by this patch to get it all working. But either way I certainly appreciate it."
,Spackfighter86,2012-11-03T11:19Z,Thx man. After downloading 20GB of shitty updates this little friend here got it working ^^
,yakirvo,2012-11-03T15:27Z,PROBLEM WITH THE SAVE :( !
,TestSmith,2012-11-04T00:19Z,"Will this work with this which is the full game.

,justoned420,2012-11-06T01:06Z,Installed this on Skidrow game + 1.7 update.  Works like a fucking charm!  Thank you!
,EvilAsh34,2012-11-06T14:00Z,"Slight Update.

I was rummaging through my antivirus quarantine and i noticed that the ""BUDDHA.DLL"" from this torrent was in there. I quickly restored it and noticed that it was 11k larger than the non-quarantined ""BUDDHA.DLL"" from SD Update 7 from SKIDROW. 

If any of you have any concern over the larger DLL (as i did) you can replace it with the ""BUDDHA.DLL"" from Update 7 with no problem. I'm not sure if there's a virus in there or not but it's better to be safe than sorry. I know sometimes it can be falsely flagged but i'm not taking any chances.

The BUDDHA.DLL that got quarantined was 69k in size and i couldn't inspect it (Access Denied) to see what was taking up the extra space. The BUDDHA.DLL from update 7 was only 58k in size and i could inspect it and nothing was out of place. 

Do yourself a favor and use the smaller one from update 7."
,RaTheGreat,2012-11-08T12:36Z,"I seem to be having some problems...

I downloaded and installed Skidrow's repack, followed by Skidrow's 1.6 and, when it was launched, 1.7 updates. All fine up to this point, the game was playable without any trouble except for the DLC's which, apart from Just Cause 2, did not work. So I came here downloaded this torrent and did everything as per the instructions. Unfortunately now I can't play the game anymore. Has anyone had the same problem?"
,biteme1011,2012-11-09T02:40Z,"Yeah!!!! Beautiful! Works like a charm although you better turn off your antivirus because my Norton quarantined both the steamclient.dll and the buddha,dll and I had to restore them. Other than that the dlcs work like a charm. The saves were all still there and when I loaded my game I got a ton of rewards such as money, outfits, and vehicles and mission unlocks. I did think that the Nightmare in Northpoint would just be point on the map to go to and start the mission but instead it's an entirely different game with it's own saves. You get the option to start it at the main menu. Life is good and I thank Skidrow and GhostNet for their time and effort."
,Secretz.R.Us,2012-11-09T05:14Z,"Well, got all the DLC to work except the Nightmare one. Ah well, better than nothing...thanks, Ghost!"
,Secretz.R.Us,2012-11-09T05:44Z,"Anyone know what $DLC_GHOST_TITLE is? It's listed on the downloadables list at the main menu, but didn't pop up when everything was being unlocked. Is this the Nightmare DLC? And if so, how do I get to it?"
,sheesh10,2012-11-10T15:59Z,awh..i click on hkship.exe and nothing happens..help! this is the third downlod..
,Aoishiro,2012-11-12T11:58Z,"i started with 8 bonus triad, face and cop point after installing this? is this normal? These point is not part of the DLC right?"
,hubbahowz,2012-11-19T00:54Z,"got it to load for the first time, now going to see if i can play it. props to you, Steam 006 and Gh0stNet!"
