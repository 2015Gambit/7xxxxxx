I can only assume that different people did the translations on these books. Or maybe some of them have been officially translated and some were done by "us", the comic book scanning, translating and sharing community. I mention this because sometimes you won't notice the text at all, it will be just like reading any other English language comic book. Other times, particularly book three, it's like Yoda wrote the story, with syntax backwards, yeeees. And mistakes like, 'lost your conscious', instead of 'lost consciousness'. I mean really, Vol 3 is sometimes laughably bad. But Vol 1, 2 and 4 are pretty solid, and the series as a whole is too beautiful to look at to not share it with y'all. 


Volumes 1-4 of 'Korrigans'

Not sure who was the original publisher or what years they were released. The French versions were published by Delcourt, from 2006-2008 (I think)

Written by Thomas Mosdi

Illustrated by Emmanual Civiello 

Ireland, province of Ulster. In the year 1100, during the first night of the month November. It is the night of Samain; the night when mysterious passages are opening and connecting our world to the world of magical creatures and Gods from heroic times long ago. This night will change the destiny of Luaine, the little girl the Korrigans have accepted and taken to the Other World. For love of her Mother, she involves her clan in a war...

See, even the blurb is funky (and I worked on making it sound better, too). 


There is a torrent with Vol 1-3 in Dutch here at TPB, but it shows only one seed, so I'm not sure if it's live or not.
