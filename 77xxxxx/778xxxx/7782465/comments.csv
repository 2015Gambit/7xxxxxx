,solutioN-Ghost,2012-11-02T15:16Z,"It does not work. I already tried running the game from csgo.exe without running Steam, it gives me a black screen then exits itself with a message ""ERROR:This game requires Steam!"" but it works when I log-in Steam of course.

I will try again when CSGO Free Weekend is over to make sure that this works."
