Kenyan Songs And Strings 1950 & 1952 (SWP) [FLAC] {MKOP}

From his home in South Africa, Hugh Tracey ΓÇö son of a Devonshire doctor ΓÇö travelled throughout southern, central and eastern Africa every year between 1948 and 1963, amassing his pioneering field recordings. 

The selection of music here is comprised of a capella choirs and songs accompanied by string instruments. Except for two guitar tracks and one oud track, the string instruments are all lyres ΓÇô chepkongo, kipukandet, thum, litungu. The strummed lyres sound very guitar-like, at times positively post-punk, and then the wonderful buzzing bass sound of the plucked thum, with strings made of cow tendons. And an array of beautiful traditional vocal styles. And yes, this is the original recording of the famous song 'Chemirocha' - lovingly remastered, like all the other tracks.

As always with this series, the remastering is excellent. And the music itself is stunning, unearthly and beautiful as a matter of routine.
