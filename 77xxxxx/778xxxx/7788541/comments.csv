[V],footy,2012-11-03T18:46Z,news: NBC becomes exclusive US F1 broadcaster from 2013 (http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2012/10/13935.html )
,neingott,2012-11-03T18:54Z,ยกGracias!
,rc90029,2012-11-03T19:10Z,"NBC will only host 2 races on national TV, the rest are going to be on NBC's cable channel.  

Nonetheless, I doubt NBC will be able to present Formula 1 in the same caliber as Skysports.

Plus Martin Brundle is irreplaceable.  "
,EdoSensei,2012-11-04T17:08Z,"SkySports might be good but BBC do it better! Martin was a loss, but a bigger loss will be Jake Humphrey leaving BBC at the end of this season."
,Longhorn93,2012-11-04T18:57Z,is this bbc? or sky?
,Longhorn93,2012-11-04T19:01Z,just saw it is sky. Thanks!!!
