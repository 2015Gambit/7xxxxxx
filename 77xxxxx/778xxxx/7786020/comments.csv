,hamsn,2012-11-05T20:03Z,"Thanks to the uploader. I was able to successfully upgrade windows 7 to windows 8 pro (32bit). Only needed the activator, personalization is working without the fix. So this thing works, it is the 9200 build, last modified date 26/10. 
Before downloading this torrent, I was reading all the comments, but no one had shared any info about this, that's why I created an account to let you all leechers know, that this torrent works. I think it's the same as what Thumper has uploaded, but this one has extra screens and activation tutorial video, everything else the same. But Thumpers torrent has less seeds so I downloaded this, took some time, but was done finally. If you have anymore questions, do ask me, I will be happy to give you any info you like.
All the best!"

People don't blame the horse if You don't know how to ride, all You have to do is to follow the instructions. This torrent is worth of praise! "
,murphy78,2012-11-06T05:07Z,"The idea of a permanent activator might sound appealing to you guys, but it does not function as a real activated copy does.  They call these things hacktivators and nobody has gotten them right yet.  The iso seems good, but I'd beware of the ""Permanent Activator"".  But, what do I know? I only do this stuff all day every day.

The ""Fix"" is actually a dll-mui-exe hack ran by a batch file.

It also hacks the windows 8 activation and the slmgr.vbs(KMS activation) file.

,Bmuzammil,2012-11-12T11:49Z,"Feedback Alerts and Advice......

hi everyone, 
(1)there is a virus in the Activators so avoid using antivirus as it will delete the files and windows will crash.
(2) In Windows updates, change settings to check but don't install automatically and by installing (KB2756872 update) you have to run the activator again but not fix.
(3) Buy Windows 8 if affordable for you!!!!!!!!!!~
(4) If you are not an advance user and that also means if you don't know what restore points are then disable windows update.
(5) Every single time you guy install any software or update please create Windows Restore Points, only if you think windows is out of bad luck.

Enjoy New OS as I am :)"
,guling1,2012-11-12T13:57Z,"I confirm this is working.

1.Deactivate ur fucking antivirus it will delete perm activator.

2.Install in eng-british language don't change anything, but u can change the keyboard layout.

3.When finishing installation right-click admin on perm activator and Y enter.

4. For personalize options just run FIX_P8.25 on the same folder as perm activator.

All credits to saif_khan, thanks and cheers!"
,guling1,2012-11-12T14:32Z,"I had a serious problem with newer laptop with UEFI shit. I made it through after visitting hell.

http://blog.laptopmag.com/how-to-dual-boot-windows-8-while-keeping-windows-7-as-your-default-os
or u can simply do a clean install or something.

2.If ur usb doesn't show it's in boot HDD settings activate usb boot and deactivate HDD.

,JasonDJ,2012-11-13T18:38Z,AutoRun doesn't work on x64 machines.  If you are planning on doing an upgrade (not a fresh install) you need to navigate to CDROM:Sourcessetup.exe on an x64 computer.  If you want to do a fresh install you can just restart and boot off the CD.
,kkory,2012-11-13T21:02Z,polish language is well guys !!!!!!
,yoBro87,2012-11-13T23:44Z,"Ok this is how I got this working and activated... I installed Windows 8 Pro with Media Center x86 (I'm sure you can do the x64 version the same). After installing I noticed it wasn't activated. (I didn't use any of the activators that came with the torrent) So I went to this site. 
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs

Windows is giving away serial keys for free for the Media Center add-on. No joke. Just type in an email and they send you one.

So for shits and giggles I tried it and got a serial and added it through this process.

Once you obtain your key, go to the search tool (looks like a magnifying glass on the right side of the screen) and under ""Apps"" type in SLUI 3

This will pull up an activation window where you can paste or type in your key. Now my copy is activated. I don't know if this is some sort of loophole but it worked for me. 

Note that you can only use one serial per computer and Microsoft is giving these keys away for a limited time. 

Let me know if this works for any of you as well.

Also, THANKS FOR THE TORRENT :)"

btw, thanks "
,dets1993,2012-11-16T17:40Z,"checked, the activator doesn't work with x64 version, otherwise everything works perfectly, with the x86 goes perfectly, thanks saif_khan for the torrent"
,Bmuzammil,2012-11-16T17:54Z,"If anyone installed (Anti-Virus) and you are seeing a black screen after you log-in. Here is what you need to do to fix that problem:
0: Go to Processes and select one (any) and right click and select Open file location to open explorer and go to control panel and uninstall your anti-virus.
1: Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete 
2: Run Task Manager
3: Select File from top menu and open (Run New Task)
4: Click Browse and Find the crack (Activator) and select and (Right-Click) and Run as Administrator. Y = yes.

After updates are installed you're OS will be deactivated so Run the Activator if so.
===========
If you have better way if fixing this problem,
let us all know. I do want to use anti-virus but I can't :( .
Also Disable!~ Windows Defender.
