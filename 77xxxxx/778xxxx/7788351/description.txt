About the Game

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction is an action-adventure stealth video game, developed by Ubisoft Montreal. 
The game is part of the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series. 
Splinter Cell: Conviction introduces a number of new gameplay features to the Splinter Cell series, one of which is the "Mark & Execute" feature, 
which allows the player to mark specific targets, such as enemies or objects, and shoot them in rapid succession without manually targeting each. 
The player can choose to prioritize these targets, so that, for example, he can distract one guard by shooting out a light in his vicinity and then take out another guard. 
Another new feature is the "Last Known Position", which occurs when the player breaks the line of sight of an alerted guard. 
This creates a visual silhouette where the guard thinks Sam is, allowing the player to flank his enemies.......
