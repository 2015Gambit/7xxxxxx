Password Depot

Password Depot 6 protects your important and confidential passwords from external access while offering maximum user-friendliness! According to Computerbild 01/08 Password Depot was ΓÇ£the only password management software that made a good impression during the comprehensive security testΓÇ¥.

Password Security:
ΓÇó Best protection of your data due to double encryption with Rijndael 256! Your password list is protected twice: with the master password and with an internal key.
ΓÇó Protection from keylogging (intercepting of keystrokes) ΓÇô All password fields are internally protected from keylogging.
ΓÇó Password Depot leaves no trace of your passwords in the RAM. So even an attempt by a hacker to use your computer and try to browse the cryptic memory dumps for passwords - a theoretical option - would be defeated.
ΓÇó Clipboard protection ΓÇô Password Depot automatically detects any active clipboard viewers and masks its changes to the keyboard; after performing auto-complete, all sensitive data is automatically cleared from the clipboard.
ΓÇó The integrated password generator creates virtually uncrackable passwords: instead of passwords like "sweetheart" or "John", which can both be cracked in a few minutes, you now use passwords like "g/:1bmV5T$x_sb}8T4@CN?A:y:Cwe-k)mUpHiJu:0md7p@

Password Management:
ΓÇó Friendly and easy-to-use interface, similar to the Windows Explorer, that allows you to navigate the password lists.
ΓÇó Top bar window for faster and more efficient navigation. Now available in classic design or as application desktop toolbar
ΓÇó Auto-complete action that allows you to automatically complete fields on a web page with user name and password.

Additional Features:
ΓÇó Custom fields: Create as many fields as you like in the database. That way you can adjust Password Depot to your personal needs.
ΓÇó Recognition of correct passwords: The program recognizes automatically the password that is used for a website and suggests it automatically!
ΓÇó New wizards: Add web passwords using the wizards. Or install Password Depot on a USB flash drive with the help of the wizards.
