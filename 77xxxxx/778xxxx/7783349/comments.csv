,alzen69,2012-11-03T02:31Z,Please can somebody tell us if any of this is a permanent activation?
,lavir74,2012-11-03T17:35Z,"After having done this, get the product key for Windows Media Center, to turn the 180 days activation to a permanent one.

IT'S FREE UNTIL JANUARY 2013, SO HURRY UP.

After you have activated PERMANENTLY using the WMC key then I suggest to backup the activation using Advanced Tokens Manager.

FOR NOW THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO PERMANENTLY ACTIVATE, SO DO IT AND BACKUP THE ACTIVATION."

,lavir74,2012-11-04T10:43Z,"@ruffryder007

You have probably an N version of W8 (Pro N, the european one), use the according serial, (XCVCF etc.) that you find on the description here."
