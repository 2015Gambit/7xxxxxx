,razorwindmo46,2012-11-13T13:53Z,"@levin123=Those having issues with mouse acceleration kindly
 open the nvidia control panel and change the max prerendered frames settings to 0

Just exactly where is this setting in the control panel. I can't find it in mine."
,razorwindmo46,2012-11-13T14:03Z,"@levin123=Those having issues with mouse acceleration kindly
 open the nvidia control panel and change the max prerendered frames settings to 0

Mine doesn't have a 0. Mine only has 3d settings and 1,2,3,4"
,levin123,2012-11-14T02:38Z,"razorwindmo46: then set to lowest settings which is 1. first of all, open the nvidia control panel, and then click on manage 3d settings. therefore, you can see the tab of program settings. From here, you 
need to add the 007 game executable file. after that, you need have a look from specify settings programs. so, kindly change the prerendered frame to the lowest settings."
