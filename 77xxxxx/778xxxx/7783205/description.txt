Overview
Prisoner of the State is the story of Premier Zhao Ziyang, the man who brought liberal change to China and who was dethroned at the height of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 for trying to stop the massacre. Zhao spent the last years of his life under house arrest. An occasional detail about his life would slip out, but scholars and citizens lamented that Zhao never had his final say.But Zhao did produce a memoir, secretly recording on audio tapes the real story of what happened during modern ChinaΓÇÖs most critical moments. He provides intimate details about the Tiananmen crackdown, describes the ploys and double crosses used by ChinaΓÇÖs leaders, and exhorts China to adopt democracy in order to achieve long-term stability. His riveting, behind-the-scenes recollections form the basis of Prisoner of the State.The China that Zhao portrays is not some long-lost dynasty. It is todayΓÇÖs China, where its leaders accept economic freedom but resist political change. Zhao might have steered ChinaΓÇÖs political system toward openness and tolerance had he survived. Although Zhao now speaks from the grave, his voice still has the moral power to make China sit up and listen.

Editorial Reviews
Perry Link
The material is largely consistent with what is already known from the The Tiananmen Papers, an unauthorized compilation of government documents published in 2001, and from Captive Conversations, a Chinese-language record of conversations between Zhao and his friend Zong Fengming, published in 2007. But the up-close-and-personal tone of the present book stands out.
