Add your heart and your energy to this day of transformation
'You can dam a stream and you can dam a river, but you can't dam a tidal wave.'
- David Icke

David's nine-hour presentation will be massively updated with new information beyond anything
that has gone before and he will seriously move the cutting edge of who we are, where we are,
how we are controlled, and how we can - and shall - be free.
