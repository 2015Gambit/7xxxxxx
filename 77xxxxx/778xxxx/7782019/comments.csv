This is my first attempt at uploading anything to piratebay and its now cooperating. 

Please bare with me while I figure this out.

Thank you."

It is NOT cooperating.  Please bare with me while I figure this out."

Newbie in uploading.  All looks great but have a yellow status on Utorrent.  It just won't allow me to seed, as it appears to me.
