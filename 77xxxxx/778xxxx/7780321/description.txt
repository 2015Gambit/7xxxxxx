Opeth - Still Life

Peaceville VILELP78 2010 Reissue. Original album released in 1999.

The first song "The Moor" has panning channel distortion or dropouts if you'd like to call them around the 5-6 minute mark. Mikael commented about it on a forum and said it was due to a DAT error. This problem is on the cd and unfortunately it's on the record as well. It sounds really bad, especially on headphones. These dropouts occur very briefly in a few other songs but they're barely noticeable. The Special Edition CD+DVD has the album in DTS surround and the channel dropouts aren't present on this version. Track 1 is the downmix of the DTS track at 16-bit 48 kHz. The rest of the tracks are at 24-bit 96 kHz from the record.
