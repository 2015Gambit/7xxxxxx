Pieced together from a variety of sessions and soundtracks, My Kind of Broadway is an uneven record, featuring a handful of gems among a bunch of competent, but undistinguished performances. My Kind of Broadway music CDs Most of the songs -- from "Luck Be a Lady" and "Hello, Dolly!" to "I'll Only Miss Her When I THink of Her," "They Can't Take That Away From Me," "Yesterdays," and "Nice Work If You Can Get It" -- are classics, but the arrangements and performances frequently are nothing more than competent. My Kind of Broadway songs When Sinatra delivers, as he does on the show-stopper "Luck Be a Lady," the results are pretty spectacular, but the majority of the album is merely pleasant.
