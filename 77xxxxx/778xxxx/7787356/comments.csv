,Inpuris,2012-11-04T03:12Z,"Are you f-ing kidding me??? azaq318 has NEVER posted a virus!

Is it because when you got to the install portion there were ???. If so, it's because your computer does not have the language needed to install.

The game will still install if you click the bottom left button and the game will run fine.

Best,

,Inpuris,2012-11-04T03:21Z,"Above, when I said ""If so, it's because your computer does not have the language needed to install.""  ---- I DID NOT mean that your computer did not have the language needed to install the game.  What I mean to say was that your computer may not have the language installed needed to read what the ????? marks stood for.

However, if you go through the install process as usual and choose the button on the bottom left (the same button you would choose that would say ""install"" if the words were all there in English) the games aza318 will install without issue and work problem and virus-free.

Sorry for the confusion in my earlier post."

,Inpuris,2012-11-07T03:29Z,"I can attest that the game is clean.  It was an awesome game and I literally played in almost non-stop until I finished it (took about 10 hours total - not all in one sitting). 

 Not only was it virus-free, but it uninstalled perfectly.

My thanks go out again to azaq318 for keeping me busy with all these great VIRUS FREE games while I'm home on medical leave with cancer.  

Thanks so much...and I look forward to more great games from you."
