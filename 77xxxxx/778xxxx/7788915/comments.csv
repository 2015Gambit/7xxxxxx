,Themperror,2012-11-03T18:31Z,"For the ones that don't know, To install these you NEED a cracked Rocksmith..(This does not work on the legit/retail one)

The Content folder goes in your Rocksmith folder

(or all the .dat files in your Content folder IN the rocksmith folder)"
,godfitzham7,2012-11-03T19:54Z,"Themperror, there was a guy called DCrack who was a Champion with making available flightsimulator downloads on TPB, but YOU are The KING in my opinion with these RS DLCs !!! THANK YOU, thank you very much."
,foggy231,2012-11-03T20:23Z,Where is the PC save profile saved in? does anyone know? i want to transfer my save from my PC to my laptop.
,rafamore,2012-11-03T20:56Z,"To make the DLC work with the legit game, I used the TiNYiSO crack only and copied those files to my steamappscommonrocksmith folder.
Hope this helps!"
,rafamore,2012-11-03T20:57Z,steamapps  common  rocksmith
,godfitzham7,2012-11-03T21:48Z,"Themperror I have a question, can you re-download the Avenged Sevenfold song pack from Steam ?  This is because the songs you uploaded do not have the Bass content, and this has happened before on Steam, where they uploaded songs without the bass, which was Ubisofts fault. Thanks."
,lunatic123,2012-11-03T21:52Z,anyone getting random crashes with this game in running windows 8?
,Thrasher-90,2012-11-03T22:16Z,"@lunatic123 I have Windows 8, start the game at Admin."
,Michaelcr13,2012-11-04T05:29Z,This includes the time saver pack right? do i put it in a different folder or something..i put every file in this torrent in the content folder but all the amps arent unlocked.
,korosiv,2012-11-04T11:36Z,"@themperror  thank u so much :)   only one more thing dude like godfitzham7 said can u re-upload the avenged sevenfold pack please ? there is no bass content (ubi 's fault wrong file realeased on steam 1st now its fixed but u need to re-download it ) so if u know who gifted u this avenged sevenfold songs tell him to redownload it so u can re up them here for all of those who play bass , thank you for all of ur work u n anyone who help in this, take care!"
,ChocoboDreams,2012-11-04T14:12Z,"So my game has been messing up ever since replacing my old ""Content"" folder with this one (the old one was pretty much your 40 pack released before this one, which worked fine). Ever since downloading this, my game has crashed, gotten stuck on the loading screen, and when I do manage to make it into the game, it doesn't detect my cable (a problem I haven't had at all since the game was released here on Pirate Bay). "
,bobomsin,2012-11-04T15:36Z,"@ChocoboDreams    

Sam here, I got the songs little by little from the Thread on CS_RIN_RU and I have the same bugs since two days. One of the songs (at least) seems to be corrupted in some way and messing the game up sometimes."
,korosiv,2012-11-04T16:04Z,"@ChocoboDreams   or other who experienced trouble with that   , delete the file called      RS001TSPK0000004.dat      in your content folder propably a mess with the "" time cheater (saver) Pack""  delete this file and it will work "
,Bair_morritt,2012-11-04T18:18Z,Too bad they are in an RAR file. Be easier to pick and choose the files that aren't included in the 40 pack.
,veky12,2012-11-04T19:51Z,"Thanks Themperror, and every one that helped make this happen, keep up the good work.           61 songs, wow, this is crazy."
,Makkeletor88,2012-11-05T00:16Z,"hey, any1 can tell me pls how to identify each song? 'cause there are some of them that i dont like...and some of them that i hate, i'd like to erase them. And thx for the effort Themperror"

,kdobbs74,2012-11-06T02:07Z,I made the list so I know what I have. I think you can rename the .dat files to whatever you want like artist - song title and make sub folders and Rocksmith will still find them so you don't have to look at a bunch of RS001SONG0000XX.dat files.

The only way i can imagine is erasing one by one and entering the game to see which one has been deleted, hope there is an easier way."

,kdobbs74,2012-11-06T17:21Z,@Makkeletor88  When new songs came out I added one at a time to see what it was and made this list that way.  It took me a little time to make but at least I know what file goes with each song.
,dallasdave22,2012-11-06T22:16Z,"Thanks again!  This is awesome.

We will get the updated DLC soon so please don't bug him about it. He is the one who has put in a lot of his time to make sure we get all the songs and keep up with the torrents and stuff.
