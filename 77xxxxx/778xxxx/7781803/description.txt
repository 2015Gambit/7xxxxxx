SymantecΓÇÖs Norton Utilities provides the essential tools you need to optimize the performance of your PC. The application suite cleans up, tunes up and speeds up your PC to help it run like new again. Norton Utilities finds and fixes broken registry links and damaged files, frees up disk space, reclaims system memory, accelerates startup time, and boosts application and system performance. It opens the programs faster and you can work on multiple open programs simultaneously. Unlike other PC tune-up software, Norton Utilities focuses 100 percent on performance and provides easy-to-use tools that make a real difference. Make your computer boot faster by prioritizing the startup programs with Startup Manager. Instead of letting Microsoft Windows load programs you donΓÇÖt need, Startup Manager loads only the programs you choose.


Boost the overall performance of your PC by optimizing the hard disk with the disk defragmenter and cleaner. It removes hard drive clutter, temporary files, and Internet cookies. It allows you to permanently and delete unwanted sensitive data from your PC so hackers cannot access it. The Service Manager works in a similar way to accelerate the PCΓÇÖs startup time. The registry defragmenter and cleaner free up and reclaim memory by fixing registry errors, organizing registry files, and repairing broken links.
Management tools let you view and manage the memory usage of running applications so you can make adjustments that improve PC performance. You can also evaluate the performance of your PC by benchmarking it against other PCs.
