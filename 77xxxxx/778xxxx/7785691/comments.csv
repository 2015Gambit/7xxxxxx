If YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME, FEEL FREE BY DOWNLOADING! I I THINK THE UPLOADER DID THIS ON PURPOSE...2 of my FAVORITE SONGS:STELLA BY STARLIGHT (SKIPPED 30 SECS into the SONG) as did ETERNAL LOVE! WHAT S WASTE! WOULD'VE BEEN NICE 2 ADD 2 MY JAZZ COLLECTION! 2 MANY TRACKS SKIP...I'LL LOOK ELSEWHERE...SERIOUSLY, Don't DOWNLOAD THIS...MAYBE HE WAS EXPERINCING AN EARTHQUAKE WHILE UPLOADING THIS..AND TO THINK< I THANK GOD WHEN I SAW THIS TORRENT...I STILL LOVE GOD>.."
