,hine2009,2012-11-04T15:00Z,16 hrs 0%
,johnmorrisson,2012-11-04T15:24Z,17 hours now and still 0.0%... it would be nice to get some seeding. I really wanna watch this but it seems like we'll have to wait for someone to upload it to Youtube instead.
,rickety,2012-11-04T16:17Z,"I don't understand why this is not seeding!!!! Surely if 9 people are seeders and 100's of people are leechers some of those leechers somewhere must have at least .01 percent but everyone is on 0, wtf."
,hine2009,2012-11-04T17:21Z,"must be some mistake from scenebalance, the torrent is obviously not seeded"
,johnmorrisson,2012-11-04T20:18Z,Would be great if someone could make scenebalance aware there is something wrong with the torrent. He seem to be a very busy uploader so not likely he'll notice.
,johnmorrisson,2012-11-05T08:25Z,It's all on Youtube now!
,Apt411,2012-11-05T14:31Z,Thanks for mentioning where to find.....on YouTube.
,johnmorrisson,2012-11-05T16:47Z,"Yea how do I find it on Youtube.... hmmm... Oh wait I got it I'll use the search function!! Oh no I forgot how to turn on my computer, damn so close. 
Dumbass!!"

,makuk,2012-11-14T22:35Z,.mkv format is a complete waste of time and of no use to anyone.
