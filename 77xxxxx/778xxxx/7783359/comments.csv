,vivatpb5776,2012-11-02T14:22Z,Karlzbad is spot on. I normally QC the first 5-10 minutes of a movie before I add it to my collection. I couldn't even get past 3 minutes on this one. The opening scene skipped about every 2-3 seconds. This appears to be one of the first uploads of this movie. I would recommend waiting for a better version.
