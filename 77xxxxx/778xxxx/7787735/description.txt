I hope most of you already know this one, it is one of Milo Manaras most famous books, Butterscotch.
If you do not know Milo Manara, shame on you. He is one of the worlds most renowned artist of erotic comics, and everyone should really be able to recognize his style from just looking at a page, his drawings of women are amazing.

This version is the new french colour edition, with an amazing new colour scheme, so I of course had to scanlate it, to bring you this gorgeous comic in english :).

Butterscotch is about a professor who invents an ointment that makes items and people painted by it, invisible. The tradeoff is that it has to be mixed with butterscotch, thus giving off a distinctive smell. He of course want to use this to get close to his secret crush, the ballerina Beatrice...but instead end up meeting her secretary, the gorgeous Honey.

In Butterscotch 2, a new girl discovers the professors ointment, and want to use it to enrich herself...but other criminals also see the use for this amazing ointment.

These books contains a lot of sexual acts, but Manaras art is more of a soft core style, so you will not see anything you can't spot watching the average HBO series like Spartacus or True Blood :)
But just remember to not hand this book to your kids :)
