This is a new project Im starting to work on, a collection of different clips Ive found related to video games. I like to make mixtapes of things I watch all the time and can just condense them into some of my favorite parts. Im sorry I couldnt compress the file sizes smaller, technically I dont have a program to do so :/ Ill be able to when I made the second volume. The extras are all sorts of my favorite AVGN stuff, but I dont want the rest of the mixtapes to have so much of his stuff so I put them in with some other clips from things. 

Thanks for downloading and I hope people will be able to spread them around to friends. Ill make the next files compressed well.
