Anjali DeshpandeΓÇÖs (Padmini Kolhapure) is an educated woman who has balanced views yet strong convictions. She is married to Bharat (Milind Gunaji) and has a young daughter. Her placid life is turned upside down by a shocking incident of domestic violence, forcing her to re-evaluate her ideas about traditional family roles and the status of women in society.

India, a country well known for its rich and diverse culture where every state exhibits its own story, way of life and mores yet a common happening among these states, like anywhere in the world is ΓÇÿdomestic violenceΓÇÖ.
Domestic Violence isn't just hitting, or fighting, or an occasional argument. It's an abuse of power. The abuser tortures and controls the victim by calculated threats, intimidation, and physical violence. . Although both men and women can be abused, in most cases, the victims are women. Children in homes where there is domestic violence are also abused or neglected. Although the woman is usually the primary target, violence is sometimes directed toward children, and sometimes toward family members and friends.
Many women in India are the victims of domestic abuse. Domestic violence is a CRIME and the victims must seek help.
