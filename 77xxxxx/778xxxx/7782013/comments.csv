,catren1,2012-11-01T20:29Z,subject coordinated and very very beautiful thanks
,BalisongBrad,2012-11-01T23:50Z,"Question here, so the audio is English but it has korean subs, correct? Thanks for the up!"
,DiabloXxX2000,2012-11-01T23:56Z,Can i remove the kor subs ??? a put others ?
,snowbirds,2012-11-02T00:42Z,"Yes, the audio is English, and there are Korean subs that are hard-coded, so you cannot remove them.

Screens look good so I'm going to grab this.  My mind learns to ignore the subs after about 10 minutes anyway..."
,spankdaddy,2012-11-02T00:45Z,Yeah Hero or anyone are these hard coded? I guess I could download and see for myself but i wanted to say hola and be chatty. Its winter time here I dont get out much :)
,pyroarch,2012-11-02T00:53Z,I never really understood hardcoded subs unless they are put there for dvd-burning to street shops I guess.

,BillyBold,2012-11-02T05:26Z,"Cheers mate. My wife is Korean, so I appreciate the subs version."
,jackson5more,2012-11-02T05:41Z,"Good movie A:8/V:8 = looks as close to DVD quality as I can tell on a 23"" monitor. The hardcoded asian subs are tolerable. TOP upload HM thanks ~"

,runnaky,2012-11-02T12:49Z,can hardcoded subs somehow be removed with a piece of software?
,vafler86,2012-11-02T14:07Z,"Anybody tried other hardcoded subs version, which version has the best A/V? Unique, Jyk or RemixHD?

The subs arent that big of a deal honestly, better with subs then a cropped version imo."
,SwingingDick10,2012-11-02T14:40Z,Sample looks good but Audio Definitely low...Korean subs hardcoded but not distracting. A8/V5
,SwingingDick10,2012-11-02T14:42Z,Sample looks good but Audio is very low...Korean subs hard coded but not distracting. V8/A5
,P1wel,2012-11-02T18:50Z,"Well like everybody said. Video is OK, audio is quite silent- I used my headphones. So to sum up V:8 A:6"
,StealthDragoon,2012-11-02T18:55Z,"Audio : 7/10
Video : 9.5/10
Movie : 10/10

Dear god this is a great movie. Korean sub... yeah maybe. Sound's a bit muffled... yeah maybe. But this movie is a such a thrill ride you forget about these 2 minor details."
,Contirio,2012-11-02T19:06Z,"The audio is ok, not that low. You probably do not have AC3Filter installed.

,browncow2,2012-11-03T20:22Z,"Awesome copy. Other than the Korean subtitles. It's not really that distracting though because the writing doesn't take up very much space. Audio seems fine to me.

,GateKeeper13,2012-11-04T22:16Z,Very bad cam audio. Not worth downloading.
,salmankings1,2012-11-04T22:56Z,Nice
,NZownsUSA,2012-11-05T03:54Z,"Anyone hesitant to download this, DON'T BE. Stop listening to these fuck heads calling it a cam with shit audio, it's a great copy, go rent a dvd and the quality is the same. All these 10 year olds on here expecting a 900,0000p HD Blu-Ray rip less than a month after the release should do us all a favour and hang themselves.. fucking idiots"
,skyvillage,2012-11-05T04:16Z,"Amazing copy--audio is just fine.  Completely enjoyable if you're prepared to ignore the subs.

And what a movie.  Very, very good."
