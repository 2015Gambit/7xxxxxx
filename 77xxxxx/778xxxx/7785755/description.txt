The film is built on the memories of the bride (Erica Bella), who rides in a limousine with the Hungarian numbers, along with her godfather (Christoph Clark). The road to the church is very long and dreary, and so she begins to remember her many sexual adventures. Her excitement grows to such an extent that she tries to have sex with her godfather in a limousine. But her church is getting too close, if she has time?
