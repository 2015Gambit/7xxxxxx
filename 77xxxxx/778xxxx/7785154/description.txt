This is a torrent I found elsewhere, and I'm just passing it along as I didn't see this album represented on PB, and trying to add to the seeders by connecting multiple website communities.  The original trackers should still be included, I think.  This is the first time I've tried to upload a torrent this way.





It is Macklemore & Ryan Lewis's "The VS. Redux" from 2010.  It is a rerelease of the 2009 "The VS. EP".  "The VS. Redux" is all of the "The VS. EP" tracks plus extra remixes.

The files are in FLAC format, how I found them.  You'll have to convert them for iTunes.

The album art is not included, again, how I found it.

Hope this finds its way to whoever wants it.

Cheers.
