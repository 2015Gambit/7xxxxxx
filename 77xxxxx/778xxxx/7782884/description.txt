Aerosmith is the American hard rock band fronted by the charismatic frontman Steven Tyler who, following a self-induced implosion in the early 1980s, went on to stage one of the most successful comebacks in rock history. Over the course of their long career they have released fourteen albums, many of which are platinum certified.
