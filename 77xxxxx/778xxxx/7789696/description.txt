Documentary 2 of 3 by Ben and Dan Stewart

"Evolution is a term to define only one organism and thatΓÇÖs the self. The self is the universe, the self is the alpha and omega, god, and infinity, and thatΓÇÖs the only thing that evolves because we are all part of the self. Nothing goes through an evolutionary process alone or without direct benefit to the whole. So when you begin to think that thereΓÇÖs this controlling elite, this controlling hand behind the curtains leading the planet to destructionΓÇª

When you think the end is near, the apocalypse, Armageddon, and when you think we as a species are doomed, it is not they, it is you that brought this about, and for a very good reason. You are evolving. Stop blaming everybody and everything else. Quit panicking about global tyranny and natural disaster and pay attention, because the world is telling you something; itΓÇÖs tell you exactly what is wrong with you and how to fix it."
