[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-03T16:53Z,"It wasn't actually, this was uploaded to KAT an hour after the premiere since TPB torrent uploading was done. So it got a lot of seeds from that site overnight."
,livens01,2012-11-03T21:25Z,Does anyone have the 720?
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-03T22:00Z,Nobody has uploaded a 720p (or scaled down hdtv version) as of yet.
,paul3256,2012-11-03T23:00Z,"Thanks so much.

Is there any plan to share National Geographic Channels new series Bid & Destroy? Really want to see it and cannot find it anywhere...

Thanks"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-03T23:55Z,"Yes actually, we have that and about 200 other miscellaneous television episodes lined up to release! Stay tuned. It might be slow but we definitely have them. :)"
,otis1978,2012-11-04T00:35Z,"thanks so much for this, i live on the far side of the world and we dont get to see saeson 3 till next year, far to long to wait, thanks again."
[V],psspss,2012-11-04T01:47Z,"thanks for some source.. scene really are slow

amazes me how many moan at tvrips thinking they hdtv lol 

keep them coming.. however dont crop it so much
leave the bottom D on logo and top of TV PG if can"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-04T02:07Z,"@psspss Yeah, I'm surprised absolutely nobody from the scene has released it - usually DHD, KILLERS, CRiMSON, or even 2HD (since they did Jungle Gold) are on top of things.

Let people learn, they should really read NFO files, they're there for a reason.

And actually, the cropping is correct - SD channels like Discovery usually do 16:9 letterbox, thus putting black bars around it. Stuff like the show rating and channel logo are half on the actual show and the other half are on the black bars that contain nothing - so we cut the black out, as nobody wants it (reference that Gold Rush special we released at 640x480 to see how it's half on half not) HD channels have it completely on, which we haven't got.

Long story short, we will continue cropping part of the logo off as long as it's on the 16:9 letterbox bars rather than the video. All of the video remains intact."
[V],psspss,2012-11-04T08:35Z,"its only slight black bars.. it makes it look better
if leave the 4 lines out side the tv area even if they
leak the logo there..

else it looks over cropped and the extra 8 lines all up wont take away from it.. just my preference

scene crims etc finally released hd 8 hours ago"
