30 4 "The Po Who Cried Ghost" Michael Mullen Gene Grillo October 27, 2012 

Po tells the Five the story of the Jiang Shi (hopping ghosts), but the team don't believe him. Shifu then informs Po there have been 
acclaimed sightings of the ghosts at the valley cemetery. Upon arrival, the sightings turned out to be pranksters wearing masks. 
When they spend the night however, Po encounters a real Jiang Shi, but it vanishes before Shifu can see it. But once they get back to 
the palace, the ghosts follow them and kidnap Shifu. Po, Tigress and Monkey then return to the cemetery, where they discover the 
mastermind behind the Jiang Shi: the Undertaker (the cemetery caretaker), who then reveals a zombified Shifu. After an intense and 
difficult struggle, Po manages to get the ghosts to turn on the Undertaker, except Shifu. Po then turns himself into a Jiang Shi to 
fight and defeat Shifu, and Tigress and Monkey manage to cure both of them by exposing them to the morning sunrise.
