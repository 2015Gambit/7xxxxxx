Lemme spell it out for the moron. I rip and torrent historical audiobooks. I do not write them, or necessarily condone or agree with any of them.

I DO, however, find it funny that (in his haste to write nasty shit on anything I torrent) the mouse has decided to shit all over a scholarly work offered by the Larry Miller Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. Surly, mouse know best."
