Here's another incredibly rare piece of vinyl from my archives.  If you listen closely to this disc, you'll hear what I think might be a sound influenced by "Styx".  

From allmusic.com: "The progressive rock group Cinema Face formed in Ontario, Canada. The singing foursome consisted of guitarist Frank LaMagna, bassist Darryl Peterson, drummer Randy Infuso, and keyboardist Armin Hart. The band performed at clubs throughout Ontario, building a small fan base over the years, but not having a lot of major success -- nor drawing much attention to themselves or their music. In 1983, Cinema Face recorded a self-titled album, which was released under the Red Sun Records label. Where the group failed in Canada, they finally succeeded in Japan and Europe. In 1994, though the band had already called it quits, their debut was reissued on the Pacemaker Records label. The album did well enough to bring Cinema Face back to life in 1996 to complete a sophomore offering, Face Card."

Like my other offerings, this album is long out of print and almost impossible to find.  A truly under-rated and rare piece of cancon.  For some reason, the album art will not attach to this page but it is included in the download.

Please feedback and seed!

Enjoy!
