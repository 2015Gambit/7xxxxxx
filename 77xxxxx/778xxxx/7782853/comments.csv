[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-02T07:04Z,"Yes, genocide44, I scrutinized it closely after last week's debacle on my part.

I saw no pixelation (or any other type) errors in this file.

Enjoy,

,genocide44,2012-11-02T07:37Z,can you upload the web-dl of supernatural please
,genocide44,2012-11-02T08:36Z,"good episode no pixelation error, pdtv version better quality than the web-dl version."

I think the quality for this is down to the data rate (1549 is twice my normal and 50% better than the norm).

Don't take this the wrong way, but you're requests tend to lack specifics and are not the best thought out.

Find an NZB search engine you can navigate and find the WEB-DL you're interested in, then tell me the name including episode number and I'll squeeze it in.

I do owe you one for catching the Red Dwarf error that I missed, but choose wisely.

It's a one-off as I'm not up to taking on a whole new series.

You do the research and I'll do the encoding on this.

If you had done your part, you'd know there is not a WEB-DL available yet. Sometimes the next day, but I'm still waiting for Mike & Molly 304 to show up and that was weeks ago.

Let me know,

AVIGUY"
