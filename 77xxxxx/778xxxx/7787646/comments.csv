,Jazzdancer,2012-11-03T13:36Z,thank you Anon!  I've been looking forward to this pkg each weekend..
,moonerman100,2012-11-03T14:44Z,Thank you Anon!
,cipherpunks,2012-11-03T14:54Z,"Please be more accurate in your descriptions. This is inaccurate, just like last time. It should say something like:

Real Time with Bill Maher + OT + Some irrelevant bullshit clip I threw in for no reason - 2012.22.2

I'm downloading and watching this because Bill Maher has produced a show with content worth watching. I'm not downloading this to see what irrelevant crap you want to force me to watch."
,kornspell,2012-11-03T15:34Z,"@cipherpunks You're a fucking idiot. Nobody is forcing you to watch anything. If you don't want it, go search for other torrent. I look forward to Anon's torrent every week and that ""bullshit clip"" is a big part of why I do. It's usually related to the theme of Real Time and a nice little extra for half the size of other torrents. So quit being an idiot and enjoy the work others do for you, or fuck off and make your own perfect torrent. If you had a brain you would know how to download this torrent without downloading the unwanted file...

Thanks, Anon!"
,Drizzle99,2012-11-03T15:48Z,Any chance of uploading the full HD version? Or aany suggestion where I could find it would be much appreciated.
,cipherpunks,2012-11-03T16:17Z,"Yes, after last week's inclusion of the moronic, juvenile hand puppets, I am deleting the off-topic clip without downloading it.

This is a case of someone trying to piggyback their personal opinions onto Bill Maher's work. Maher has spent his whole career fighting censorship and finally getting into a position where he can present his political work without commercials or other off-topic materials shoved in against his will. He has achieved independence, at considerable sacrifice to his career, at times. Have some respect for the guy and stop trying to shovel your bullshit in with his work. "
,Caf1000,2012-11-03T17:00Z,"You rant about respect would be a lot more believable cipherpunks if you were not on TPB trying to download RT without paying for it!
IF there is something on a torrent you don't want to waste bandwidth on, deselect it and move the fuck on. 
And learn what ""censorship"" means in the meantime."
,upx3,2012-11-03T17:22Z,"142 MB download. 5 MB is an interesting, ""unrelated"" video. OMG -- don't download it or don't watch it if you don't want to !  There's no need to be rude about it.

OTOH, the poster has a great description. A little more info about the third video would be nice. Like this:

(3)
Chris Christie on Fox News
32 sec . 608 x 256 (Fox Bubble BS removed)

Thanks !"
,Sid_of_Id,2012-11-03T17:58Z,"@cipherpunks -- Fuck you you greasy, unappreciative bag of dog vomit.  Gargle my balls, loser.  Any uploader can upload any fucking thing they want.  If the uploader wants to attach 20 gigs of bloat to the package...good for him.  Nobody is holding a gun to your head, you vacuous cunt!
And finally, don't try to evoke Bill Maher's ""material"" as some defense to your pussy-ass bitching....Maher rails against online piracy.  If you respect Maher's POV so much, then pay for an HBO account and watch it the way Bill Maher wants you to.  You fucking shit smear.

Respectfully,

Sid"
,angelmartin,2012-11-03T21:42Z,TUVM for the uled
,trivkt,2012-11-03T22:08Z,Thanks for uploading.
,jyanendra,2012-11-03T22:38Z,"Great coding - thanks very much.
The ""off-topic"" piece was actually one of the very best I've seen recently! Had me in stitches!!!
Thanks again.
And don't listen to those who complain about free stuff.
We know where they came from."
,Mishmow,2012-11-04T00:12Z,Audio codec not supported on my television. Samsung LED. Any guesses?
,J3rryKo42O,2012-11-04T01:43Z,"Thanks for uploading this, downloaded in 30 seconds and those bitching about an extra 5mb clip need to calm down. Who gives a fuck if its not labeled get over it. "
,ItsASpork,2012-11-04T03:10Z,"How do you get such high quality in this small size?

Ignore cipher, he's an asshole. I enjoy the extra videos you add in. If you don't like them, it's as simple as only downloading the first two videos."
,Bobf24,2012-11-05T00:56Z,"Thanks- and dont let morons stop you from doing your thing, i like the extra clips. How is not relevant? Its about the hurricane and the election? Some people are just retarded."
