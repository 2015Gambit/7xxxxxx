A note: This ebook is bad. Not for the reason you think. I'll write more below.

Anyway, thanks for being interested in Fake Science 101! 

You can find more about the book here:

Anyway, you may have noticed there's not an official eBook release of Fake Science 101 (right now). I know that's a drag, but the reason is that this is a heavily designed, picture-filled book. A PDF would probably be good, but Ebook and MOBI files (like this torrent) just can't convey the layout. I'm not aware of any plans to PDFify or iBook the book, though that may change. Ebook and Mobi are bad though, that's certain.

Check out the free preview pages on Amazon, Barnes, etc, or find the book in a store to see why. The publisher and I spent a ton of time designing over 200 full color images, laying out the book incredibly carefully, and putting in tons of jokes that simply didn't make it into this auto-ebook conversion.

So if you have downloaded the ebook torrent, you can get a sense of the humor, but just so you know, we designed it to be a print book. And the print book is not crappy, like this robo-converted ebook.

The point is: this is like a crappy bootleg filmed in the back of a movie theatre with the lenscap still on. If you have downloaded it, just know that the real book is better.

Email me if you have questions!

Those who download ePUB/MOBI are always encouraged to by the printed version. I myself am not a big fan of these formats. I prefer PDFs any time!"

I certanly would buy it."
