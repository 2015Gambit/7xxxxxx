Here's another rare Canadian Gem, released in 1968.

As with my other uploads, this album is long out of print and is otherwise not available online.  As it is out of print, the artist cannot lose any royalties from sales of this album due to sharing.

Oshawa Ontario's Mars Bonfire was a member of Steppenwolf, responsible for writing Born to be Wild.  The version on this LP is quite different from the Steppenwolf version.

Mars Bonfire - Mars Bonfire - Original Pressing - 1968
