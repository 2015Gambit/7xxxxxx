Retrospective is a collection of L.A.O.S production works 2005-2012. It contains tracks we had almost completely forgotten during the years buried deep in the jungle.

Some of these tracks are old and certainly have a vibe-of-an-era. It also contains some tracks which were originally intended for our Finally-album but didn┬┤t fit the overall sound.

So we decided to give all of these for you as a gift - simply because of your positive feedback and staying with us during these years. L.A.O.S is all about you, and you are the reason we still are so driven making music.

These songs are free for you to share and care, all we┬┤re asking is that you spread the love.

Thank you.
