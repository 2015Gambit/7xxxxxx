NOTES: Subtitles and audio comes from retail BluRay source. We used
CCE to convert movie @ 6 passes, the sound is untouched and contains
four languages: Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish. There were
several errors in retail subtitles which we corrected. To our Nordic
friends, hope you like our release!

PLOT/SUMMARY: Manny, Diego, and Sid embark upon another adventure
after their continent is set adrift. Using an iceberg as a ship,
they encounter sea creatures and battle pirates as they explore a
new world.
