Carefully culled from my eclectic collection; SWING YOU SINNERS may compel you

to leave the couch and do some rug cutting.  It makes me wish I'd bothered to learn 

how to dance.


These tracks are all over 70 years old (old even by my standards)....will the shape


you're in at 70 be as good?



Meticulously burned with 2 second fades, titled and dated and volume balanced with 

the HHB CDR830......the continuity is surprisingly good.


Fight the trap of having your musical taste pigeon-holed by your birthdate.  


You may recognize track#17 as the opening music from the movie SWING KIDS
