[T],Gh0stNet,2012-11-02T16:45Z,This release has been nuked for [language.localisation.misconfigued_get.repack]. wait for the repack!!
,nyder2,2012-11-02T17:16Z,mouse control on this game feels wrong.  plus you can totally tell it's a console port.   Hopefully it's fixable.

,JoaoPauloBR,2012-11-02T21:35Z,Game is total shit. Played it for 5 mins. Not worth the download. Thanks for providing it though!

,JJames187,2012-11-03T14:14Z,"@ 1nter1908...

hey guy, go to the folder DVD1 and right click one of the files and open with winRAR or something like that. Then extract the .ISO's to somewhere else and then mount."
,kahchi,2012-11-03T15:16Z,wtf i downloaded 9 gb for nothiing cant mount on seamon tools only on this asshole
,ViolentReaper,2012-11-03T19:11Z,"The description on how to install this is very vague. Usually I have little trouble mounting and successfully installing a torrent, but with this one I am just confused...

I have 2 folders, DVD1 + DVD2, and I opened DVD1 and opened with winRAR the 1st file at the top of the list of files in that folder, and I then extracted an .iso of that file into the 007 legends folder on my desktop.

But when I try to mount the .iso in daemon tools, nothing happens. 

Can anyone clarify the instructions for me here ?"
,ViolentReaper,2012-11-03T21:38Z,"I figured it out. I just ran the setup.exe from inside the DVD1 folder, and changed the two lines in the DATA folder pertaining to the sound."
,Richy2012,2012-11-04T01:07Z,"Does not work, stop uploading rubish files. Should of waited for reloaded or skidrow like always. I guess its my fault for not waiting"
,hitoshiwar,2012-11-04T03:56Z,works for me no gampad support ???
,mariuszmeu,2012-11-04T13:19Z,"it doesn`t work for me . ""send error report"" "
,RobRockly,2012-11-04T15:19Z,"Works great, but I can't change the video settings...plays in 640x480 no matter what resolution i have set. Anyone else have this problem?"
,elasar.bt,2012-11-04T22:21Z,"My God, this is the shit game of the decade. I have not seen something like that in the last 5 years. "
,FieroGT,2012-11-06T00:25Z,"Welp, 1st off, it don't work. it crashes as soon as u try to run it... BAH   

ok, so then i try anthonyjjj's  fix to rename the files, and yes it works, the game now starts, but when i started to play, it seems the voices are missing. - like when you answer the fone, (hmm i wonder why?;) ).

and to the guy that said the mouse feels wrong. ya   yer right, its sluggish as hell, i found that if u turn up the sensitivity in the game to around half, it helps alot, but still feels 'strange'. 

so, there you guys go. the in's and out's of it all...

,Megabon,2012-11-06T23:57Z,"Torrent works great, no problems, but the game is just not worth the time, you can give it a try but some of you will just uninstall it anyways. By the way, thank you Lyrical :D"
,Noobita,2012-11-07T20:16Z,"this game really sucks, the company which made this game sucks at making shooter games i guess"
,zirozarko,2012-11-10T22:18Z,Wont install on Windows 8 x64
