This download contains all the paid plugins I was able to get.
Some plugins when uploading says it inst capable with your version of mybb so to fix this issue do the following.

Navigate to the plugin you would like to activate and open it with notepad.

Find

" "compatibility" => "14*" "

Change to

" "compatibility" => "16*" "
