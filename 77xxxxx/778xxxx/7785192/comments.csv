,darqsido2,2012-11-16T00:34Z,"BE CAREFUL!

I have recently received a letter from Comcast.
""Notice of Action under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act""

It has this torrent listed as the copyright infringement.

Comcast has threatened to discontinue my service if i keep downloading torrents.

This means Bethesda is trying to prevent all downloading of this content.
They are tracking this.

I suggest you take measures to prevent these fuckers from telling you what you can and can't download.

It is the internet. If you don't want people to download it, DON'T FUCKING PUT IT ON THE INTERNET YOU STUPID FUCKS.

They want a win-win. Put it on the web, amke more money, but make people lose their internet service if they download it. I don't give a fuck what some act says. I have my rights.

Also to comcast, if you discontinue my service, I will just get a different ISP. No biggie, so fuck off.

Hotspot shield might help prevent tracking."

,Goldfire1986,2012-11-23T04:52Z,"@darqsido2

I think you need to stop using a computer all together."
,ThevirussxD,2012-11-24T04:32Z,"If I downloaded Razor's skyrim, is it possible to go straight from release version to update 11? Or will I need to go in order progressively? (Ex, update 5,6,7,8,9,10, then 11)"
,ThevirussxD,2012-11-24T04:33Z,Disregard my last comment. I think I am reading that I can just download this straight away.
,Goldfire1986,2012-11-24T07:33Z,"@ThevirussxD

Yes, you can jump to any update that you want to. No need to progressively work your way up."
,TechAngel85,2012-11-25T00:17Z,"Just want to make sure this is fully compatible with Dawnguard? Also, wanted to mention for you modders out there; this update is required for the Unofficial Skyrim Patch and 	
Unofficial Dawnguard Patch mods. That's the reason I'm here."
,Pepenews,2012-11-26T22:24Z,Made a backup of my unpatched game but looks like it was not necessary. Gonna store it arround for a while just in case.
,BobDylan101,2012-11-27T00:21Z,"Every time I open my game (and this has been happening almost EVERY time), it crashes. Not the base game, that's fine, but as soon as I install an update, ANY update, it crashes after I try to load a game. It'll show a screen for a few seconds, and then poof! It crashes. I'm currently using Razor's base game, and this update. PLEASE HELP!"
