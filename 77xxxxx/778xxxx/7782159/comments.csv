,MsMuffet,2012-11-03T09:06Z,"@swangpo ... Ridge's last performance was aired on the 14th September. He was written out quickly and bundled off without a tribute befitting a long term actor, one of the Core Four who was in the show from day one. I have a feeling it was sour grapes on Bell's part. Spoilers have leaked that Ridge will be returning, but whether the part will be re-cast or played by Ronn Moss, is not yet known. There are lots of rumours around! Cheers!"
