Tal(madge) Farlow (1921-98); nicknamed "the Octopus," was well known for his

reluctance to perform/record.  That is unfortunate for us.

The first (7) tracks are from the only album he recorded during a 16 year period

he spent as a sign painter, while maintaining his chops in local performance.


I've added (5) warhorses; tracks 8-12 to showcase his blinding speed.  Tracks 10-12

may be vinyl rips...it's been a while since I put this together.  Track #10

doesn't sound physically possible.


Track #6; MY ROMANCE is unique.  Tal employs some sort of light touch technique on 

the fretboard to produce ethereal harmonic tones appx. half way through the tune.

Track #6 gives me chills each time I hear it.
