Could you please upload Charles Dickens bibliography as complete as possible? You may say what's that a big deal about it, and rightfully so, but trust me, it's really that big a deal. The net is practically overload with the texts but sometimes plenty is not enough. The texts I've run into were not that good of either quality nor proofreading. And, what's even more crucial there's no illustration there (or, if there're, those are very poor ones of exact plates.)

Thank you very much for all you've done. Amazing collection. :)"
