"Eric Young, an avid yet novice outdoorsman and professional wrestler, is getting out of the ring and turning in his tights for some tackle. He's on the adventure of a lifetime to hear, smell and taste big and small stories of the one that got away. All across America, some fisherman go to extremes to haul in their catch - from using pantyhose on a rod and reel to catch sharks in the Atlantic Ocean to launching live bait with fire extinguishers on Lake Michigan - and Young will try his hand at all of them. Using all sorts of unique bait, tackle, poles and transportation (and a little SPF), he is aiming to be the makeshift MacGyver of fishing while learning the best and most unique techniques this country has to offer!"
 

I decided to make a torrent for the first season, due to the fact there is low seeding rates for the rest of the individual episodes, and there is not yet a complete season download. All 10 files are in .avi format. Enjoy!!
