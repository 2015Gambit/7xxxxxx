[T],rkstr,2012-11-09T07:48Z,"I will have someone filling in for me while I have a break - he must be insane and I'm so grateful.He will be uploading using the same accounts as me so it'll be pretty much business as usual.
He might not be as fast as me to get things up on here but I'm sure we'll all be patient and lovely to him and not scare him away as he's doing me/us a big favour"
