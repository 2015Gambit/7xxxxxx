Grant's Dissector walks students step by step through dissection procedures in the anatomy lab. Each chapter is consistently organized beginning with a brief study of surface anatomy followed by concise coverage of osteology, presenting important foundational structures that will aid in localization of soft tissue structures. Each dissection unit begins with a "Dissection Overview" providing a guide of what is to be accomplished during the dissection session. This is followed by "Dissection Instructions," with a logical sequence and numbered steps for the dissection. Each dissection concludes with a "Dissection Review" that presents a numbered lists of tasks illustrating the important features of the dissection and encouraging the synthesis of information.
