,geoffp,2012-11-05T09:51Z,"Anyone know what's going on with the recent sync issues? It seems the problem is affecting several (UK)  shows. Have the the broadcasters introduced a delay that gradually progresses throughout the playback? Hmmmm, I wonder."
,geoffp,2012-11-05T16:12Z,"Having watched this copy, the sound goes out of sync from 24 minutes until almost the end. Sync fixed my ass. Only the start and end are okay.  "
[V],psspss,2012-11-07T14:10Z,"just bad rippers in UK they arent using the same tools as the usa people

its all in sync.. might be a few sections where I spliced the sync-ed parts back together

I dont know what you using to watch but considering 200 seeding it still for a week
and no one else complaining.. seems its
what your using to watch it cant handle
the audio

and the uk shows the sound doesnt drift out of sync its just certain segments like the last ad section

watch it using VLC before you complain about sync if it plays ok in that then its your codecs or setup"
[V],psspss,2012-11-07T14:19Z,"ok I rechecked it as I havent had time to watch it myself yet

and yes theres still a slight sync issue at 24min but it comes right at the last ad break. about 10minn segment you cant really notice it though as they running about only when derren speaks intro

just +200ms should fix it if worries you on the player

its still way better then the source as at the end of orginal it was 500-600ms out"
