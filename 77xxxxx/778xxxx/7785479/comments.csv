[V],TorrentTracts,2012-11-02T23:33Z,"Jailroll, I'm a little concerned about torrenting that Avalon discography for you today for fear of it not working ... just as this Al Denson discography doesn't seem to want to work.  I can't seem to make it active.  Although TPB accepted it, and my own dot torrent tests out fine, TPB's dot torrent tells me it's not a torrent file. And I fear the same problem with any new torrent today."
