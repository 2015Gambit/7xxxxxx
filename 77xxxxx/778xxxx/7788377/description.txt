Pinel clearly presents the fundamentals Biopsychology and makes the topics personally and socially relevant to the reader.
The defining feature of Biopsychology is its unique combination of biopsychological science and personal, reader-oriented discourse. Rather than introducing biopsychology in the usual textbook fashion, it interweaves the fundamentals of the field with clinical case studies, social issues, personal implications, and humorous anecdotes. It tries to be a friendly mentor that speaks directly to the reader, enthusiastically relating recent advances in biopsychological science.
