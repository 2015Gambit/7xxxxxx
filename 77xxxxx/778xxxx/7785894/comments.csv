,danroberto,2012-11-03T14:38Z,Thanks YIFY but I think it's a bit dark... much more than your usually great quality HD videos.
,requestor,2012-11-03T21:43Z,"Could you rip 'Rust and Bone', please? It's a french movie. Thank you."
,che3to,2012-11-03T22:01Z,"Nice Quality.
V:8.4
A:8.6
M:5.7
Okay movie but not Pixar's greatest one. A pretty weak story with not much to tell nor get excited about. I agree with @danroberto for night scenes being a bit too dark. Besides the darks scenes, (where it was hard to tell what was happening) a good upload. 

Thanks YIFI for upload."

,Trance183,2012-11-04T03:46Z,"If you want a fast download from a trusted popular source, then YIFY is your man. His files are about half the size of everyone else. But if you want really high image quality then look elsewhere cause I noticed on all his rips they look grainy on my 55inch LCD."

,cldrain,2012-11-04T21:34Z,Must agree with che3to that the story is very weak and somewhat has little to do with the title Brave which is the whole point of this movie.  But  as usual the Video and Audio are awesome.

,martinlunaz,2012-11-25T03:01Z,"the quality is amazing.
i highly suggest you download this file !
and the best of all. its only 1.4gb "
,TugBot,2012-11-28T02:29Z,"Its not full HD, a full HD rip should be 7-8g, this should be listed as standard rips.

24 fps? Did you rip it from the cimema? Only cinema plays 24fps, pal 25, ntsc 30 fps.

It still may look good, but this aint HD."
