Quick questions tho..I've been looking for the new patches beyond 7.41 can I just use the patch from this? If not..is there a way I could transfer my player data etc to this release from the old?"
,kingofsa,2012-11-02T17:00Z,Awwww i dont want to download/install it again! what about a patch? (7.42b --> 7.44b)?
,Manicka,2012-11-04T13:30Z,"To CrimSin:
If you want play this game with your old game data, just go to game folder (e. g. C:/Program Files/Dungeon Defenders), open Binaries/Win32 and find DunDefHeroes.dun file. this is your save file. Copy it into this new game. You can do this for every new patch."
,NanoEntity,2012-11-05T15:10Z,any patch 42 to 44b?
,CrimSin,2012-11-07T23:18Z,"@Manicka Thanks, I got my data switched over..appreciate the help. 

Torrent works perfectly."
,jameslane,2012-11-10T03:02Z,"Excuse me is this include the""quest for the lost eternia shards"" ? cause i don't see any map for that if have can anyone tell me how to get it the quest and can anyone tell me how to get ""Crystalline Dimension"" for this version ? Please NEED PRO HELP ! REPLY ME ASAP!!"
,CrimSin,2012-11-10T08:50Z,"@Jameslane  Yes all of the Eternia Shards maps/quests are included. Look above your campaign level selection, you will see Eternia Shards above those levels -click it. After you beat the Eternia Shards quests you will then be able to access the Chrystalline Dimension."
,jameslane,2012-11-12T09:14Z,OK thx CrimSin !
