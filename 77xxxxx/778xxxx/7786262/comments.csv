THIS IS A MUST HAVE! DO NOT DOWNLOAD BUILD 367, it has fatal errors and this fixes them.

,100bugs,2012-11-24T20:19Z,"This software is truly professional and it is worth its very high cost.

I had no problem installing it (vista 64 sp2) and it seems much easier to use as i first thought.

Here is a 1 hour sony video that explains how to use its extensive masking and compositing capabilities.
After viewing it, you will consider all other video editing softwares as crap and will concentrate on it to become expert.

,100bugs,2012-11-24T20:29Z,"Oh yeah, i forgot to tell that i had to install 64 bits codecs because this 64 bits software needs it (it won't accept uncompressed files without it).

I took FDDShow 64 bits from here:
http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/download.php

If you like, you can install both 32 bits and 64 bits versions together so your 32 bits and 64 bits softwares will be able to use it."
