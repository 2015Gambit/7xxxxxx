,fall1en,2012-11-02T21:51Z,"Thanks BOZX!

Would it hurt some of you, if you said thanks to the up-loader, instead of asking questions, or requesting people to seed?"

,canopener,2012-11-04T01:17Z,I don't think this movie was released with dts... unfortunately.
,kelleytoons,2012-11-09T20:37Z,"Yeah, this movie did not have DTS-HD so either the sound here isn't DTS-HD or someone tried to convert the True-HD to DTS-HD (and I doubt that's possible).

I'd stay away from this."
,ericepp,2012-11-17T17:21Z,"@ Seeeganga, canopener, Kellytoons, etc

The Blu-ray does include both DD-5.1 and DTS-HD High Res Audio. The description says Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital Stereo Commentary.  I would bet that the source info is a typo, but I guess we'll have to download it to find out."
,ericepp,2012-11-17T17:45Z,"Mediainfo says its Dolby AC-3 5.1 @640 kbps.  I checked the file with barely 1% downloaded and with a .!ut file extension.  I don't know if this is accurate info.  I would think if Mediainfo could not read the actual file info, it would return no info at all.  I will update when the torrent is finished."
