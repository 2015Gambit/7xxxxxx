2 AVI (Xvid) files, ripped from DVD then edited with Ulead DVD MovieFactory 4.

FIXED Trailers for "White Slaves of Chinatown" and "Olga's House of Shame" - the first and third of the "Olga" films (1964).

Trailers included with torrents for Olga 1 and Olga 3 are about a minute too long . . . can't explain why except perhaps the DVD was imperfectly authored. No big deal, but I'm a perfectionist, though not enough of one it seems. Ciao.
