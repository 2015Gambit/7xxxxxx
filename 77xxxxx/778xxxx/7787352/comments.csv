Thanks for the time you took to do this and I talk also in behalf of the other dushbags that downloaded this without even giving thanks. It works perfectly on my SGS3. You are the best."

,l.moudni,2012-11-06T19:44Z,"Hi @jonnyblue8 Thanks for your upload , i just don't want to have surprises  after trying to root my S3 , so here's my question , will it be rooted , specifications are : 
GT-I9300
Android version : 4.0.4
base band version : I9300XXLEF
Kernel version : 3.0.15-611326-user
se.infra@SEP-71#1

What scares me is ""base band version : I9300XXLEF"" because in some forums they even add this information as a prerequisite for the rooting. Im waiting for your answer , Thanks in advance."
