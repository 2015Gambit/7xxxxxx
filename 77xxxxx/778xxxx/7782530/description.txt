Balnarring Rammed Earth - Claire and Lisa are building their dream home on 10 acres of Victoria's Mornington Peninsular. Armed with an environmental conscience, they plan a modernist house which is sophisticated but also playful.Eco conscious entertainers Claire and Lisa adore their hobby farming lifestyle on Victoria's Mornington peninsula, but the cute 1930s beach shack they've long shared with two pugs has lost its once savoured charm. They're upgrading and building a sustainable, modernist, entertainers' home that blends sophisticated design elements with rammed earth, recycled materials and raw finishes. It all sounds glamorous and straight - forward, but with a zero contingency budget, what happens when a wet winter meets an insidious clay soil?
