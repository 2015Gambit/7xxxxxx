Incubus - Wish You Were Here [Original Version promo].VOB


HQ very rare promo music video from a promo DVD. "Wish You Were Here" is a song by American alternative rock band Incubus and the lead single from their fourth studio album album, Morning View. Released in late summer 2001, it peaked at #2 on the Modern Rock and #4 on the Mainstream Rock Charts that year. "Wish You Were Here" would become one of the band's most well known songs and be included on the 2009 greatest hits compilation Monuments and Melodies.

A video for "Wish You Were Here" was scheduled for an August 2001 shooting with director Phil Harder. Einziger anticipated finishing everything within a single day like previous Incubus videos had been made. Although it could be streamed from the band's website, in light of the recent September 11 attacks where victims leapt from the Twin Towers, the original "Wish You Were Here" video would be rejected. Boyd remarked on the video's controversy:

"We spent a lot of money, a lot of days, blood, sweat, tears, and then it was deemed inappropriate by our people and MTV. . . In the original video, we were emulating a scene from the movie Head by The Monkees. [In the movie] there were thousands of screaming women and Army people, cops, clowns and photographers chasing the Monkees off this bridge. The only [thing they can do] is jump. We [shot a scene where we're] running away from these people. That part was [deemed] inappropriate ΓÇö screaming girls, screaming people. Then, our only place to go is to leap off this bridge, and it shows us descending and smacking into the water. Which, before the whole thing happened, we had a great laugh with."

Incubus is an American rock band from Calabasas, California. The band was formed in 1991 by vocalist Brandon Boyd, lead guitarist Mike Einziger, and drummer Jose Pasillas while enrolled in Calabasas High School and later expanded to include bassist Alex "Dirk Lance" Katunich, and Gavin "DJ Lyfe" Koppell; both of whom were eventually replaced by bassist Ben Kenney and DJ Kilmore respectively.
