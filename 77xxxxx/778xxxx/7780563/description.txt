About this game:

The game's basic gameplay stays truthful to that of the original Painkiller. 
The player has to get through each level, from start to finish, by slaughtering countless monsters. 
The game is divided into several chapters, each with several levels. One of the game's most important aspects is its diversity. 
Each level presents a new location with various themes and art styles. 
The levels include castles, monasteries, an opera house, Venice, graveyards, and more. 
Monsters are also very different, with new ones almost every level. 
Several classic weapons will be returning including the Painkiller, the stakethrower, the shotgun, and the electrodriver, however, 
new guns will also be available such as the Soulcatcher, a.k.a. the Small Sucking Gun, 
which shoots saw blades in primary firing mode and sucks the souls out of the countless enemy types with its secondary firing.....
