This file has a significant artifacting problem from 26:45 to 29:26

Downloaded enough of the 1080p version and it is just the same.

It pains me to say this, but ""The Scene"" versions are far superior to this,
Even with its GPE @ 24:05, nothing better is likely to show up any time soon.

And sadly, I'm not prepared to release a damaged XVID of either.

When all WEB-DL releases have ""Significant Artifacting"" from 26:45 to 29:26

What would you do?
You could try returning to XVID AVI where the solution has been all along.
I am proud to announce the posting of the ONLY undamaged version of this ep.

There are NO artifacts in this file.

There was a dying video card in my computer that made ""blackest black"" go rainbow.

When it was one file, suspect the file - when it's files from the same network,
suspect the network. When it crosses over to other networks ... time to swap
video cards and Oh My God, did I screw up.

Apologies all around,

AVIGUY"
