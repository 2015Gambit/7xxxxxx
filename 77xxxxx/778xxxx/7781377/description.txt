America's Fearless Showman, Kroger Babb, presents KARAMOJA and HALF-WAY TO HELL

2 AVI (Xvid) files - digitally mastered from VHS sources, then ripped from DVD-R.

Language: English


1) KARAMOJA (60 minutes) - A dentist, bitten by the film-making bug, travels to Uganda and documents the rites and rituals of the Karamojans, a tribe that continued to live a stone-age existence under British "protection." See how the other half lives (unless you're a Karamojan).

2) HALF-WAY TO HELL (61 minutes) - Documentary of mankind's frantic effort to annihilate itself in the 20th century, focusing on European wars, war crimes and atrocities, all seeming to lead up to the Red Menace threatening Europe in the 1950s. A more humanist documentary than it might seem in summary.

Kroger Babb actually sent out these two films as a "roadshow" double feature and I hope they turned a nice profit.  Educational and fun, these films are warmly recommended as an alternative to cable TV.
