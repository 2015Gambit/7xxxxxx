,FriendlySpidey,2012-11-03T00:03Z,Ditko?!?! I'm all over this. Thanks.

Great comment Monkey. Might be the deepest comment in the last amount of words I've had on any of my ups. : )

Yeah, I was pretty surprised to see Ditko's involvement myself. Unfortunately, I think it's only one issue. Shooter made a lot of friends during his time at Valiant, more of whom show up in some of the other Defiant titles. I'm trying to put complete runs together for those books as well. If I ever get there I'll up them, too."
