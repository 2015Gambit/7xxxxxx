Dark Dominion is a comic book series that was published monthly by DEFIANT from October of 1993 until July of 1994.

It spanned a total of 10 issues until DEFIANT ceased publication.

There was one #0 issue published as a trading card set and binder.

Dark Dominion was created by Jim Shooter and Steve Ditko, the co-creator of Spider-Man.

The concept was based on Shooter's idea that, "fear is the root of all evil," and dealt with Shooter's fascination with quantum mechanics.

The comic was based in Manhattan and featured the main character Michael Alexander.

Alexander was the author of a book entitled, "Dark Dominion," in which he explored the idea that another world occupied the same spacetime as our own. In this alternate world, housed in the sub-stratum of our world, demons arose from the fears of human beings. The only way to see this hidden world was to put aside one's fears.

The main villain, Chasm, chose Manhattan to be his headquarters on Earth because of the vast population on whose fears he could draw from.
