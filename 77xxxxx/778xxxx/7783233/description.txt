Note: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may take several days.  In fact, I could not have Internet for many hours at a time, so please be patient!  You are getting this for free, and it takes quite some time to download the large original BluRay rips, then encode them, then edit and sync the subtitles, and then write up the info and create the upload.  Be appreciative and patient please!
