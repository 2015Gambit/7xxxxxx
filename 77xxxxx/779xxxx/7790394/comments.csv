When all WEB-DL releases have ""Significant Artifacting"" from 26:45 to 29:26

What would you do?
You could try returning to XVID AVI where the solution has been all along.
I am proud to announce the posting of the ONLY undamaged version of this ep.

Nice try, AVIGUY"

There are NO artifacts in this file.

There was a dying video card in my computer that made ""blackest black"" go rainbow.

When it was one file, suspect the file - when it's files from the same network,
suspect the network. When it crosses over to other networks ... time to swap
video cards and Oh My God, did I screw up.

Apologies all around,

AVIGUY"
