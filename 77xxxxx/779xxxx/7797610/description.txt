John Thompson is one of my favorite underground comix artists. His meticulously clean pencil and ink line work, along with his mix of the erotic, symbolic and mysticism of the time always make for an interesting, enjoyable read. 

I've been holding off uploading these comics in hopes of finding the other Sphinx books first. Unfortunately, that's not looking very likely, so I'm going to go ahead and share them. If anybody has a scan of Sphinx No 1 or 3, or anything else by John Thompson, please drop me a private message at the SuprBay, rather than uploading directly, so I can 'Restore' them first. 

Also, I'd always meant to include the book below in this torrent, but sometimes I just forget everything I have planned and upload things out of order, or in the wrong collection, or on their own, which was the case with this one...
