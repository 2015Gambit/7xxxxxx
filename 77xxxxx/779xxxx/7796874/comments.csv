There's some shimmering in the orange tones, I used to see this a lot in old composite and svid cables within a couple months before they got bad enough to make the picture fuzzy. Could just be an encoding artifact given the contrasting colors behind the text and the codec used, but might want to swap out the video cable if you have a spare around."
