American Dad! - Season 8 - Episode 3 (WEB-DL - 1080p)
-----------------------------------------------------

In the upcoming eighth season, the Smiths are back with more mischief and mayhem.
Roger recruits Hayley as the lounge singer for the new high-class bar he's
installing in the attic, and Stan and Roger have an entrepreneurial "eureka"
moment when they think of the worldΓÇÖs next game-changing business opportunity.
This screwball family full of radically different personalities is just trying
to figure out how to love and trust one another in a bi-partisan world. And with
a guy like Stan in charge of national security, itΓÇÖs guaranteed to be one whacky ride.

Produced by Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Century Fox Television.
