,shadowkillaa,2012-11-10T06:26Z,"Wow awesome quality!

V = 10
A = 10

This is the quality I expect from a 6GB file. Great job seriously"
,LiarOfAngmar,2012-11-11T15:16Z,"Thanks for this .. dunno how some of you could possibly end up saying the vid quality ain't good enough or sumthing. it's 1920*816 .. any HR ready screen would offer pretty decent rendering on that one trust me. Thanks for the upload i had a pretty good time watching this!

A : 8/10
V : 8/10

M:7/10"
