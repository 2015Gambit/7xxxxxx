Travel Documentary hosted by Henry Cole, published by Travel Channel UK in 2008 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Where in the world can you experience the ultimate motorcycle adventure against the backdrop of the most thrilling yet unforgiving landscape and at the same time with every mile that passes soak up a culture and a terrain that has become famous the world over in pop culture? There's no place on earth like the American Desert aboard an all American custom chopper. The Deserts are a vast playground to explore. Steeped in history they are a place to reflect and ponder on your past, present and future. A place that restores your humility as your daily quest is for water and fuel rather than designer restaurants and a broadband internet connection. If you've ever wanted to stop the world and pull over for a while this is the place to do it.
