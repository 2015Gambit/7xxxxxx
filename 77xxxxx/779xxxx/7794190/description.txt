Life's tough when you're a teenager - homework, boy trouble, and meddling parents. So when you throw in imaginary friends turned real, monster attacks, and faerie magic - well, that's just not fair, is it? Suburban Glamour follows Astrid Johnson as she and her best friend Dave get caught in a faerie family battle that stretches back through the centuries. Modern teenage life meets age-old magic in this story from the co-creator of Phonogram!
