,poopp00p,2012-11-05T18:57Z,"AWESOME UP - THANX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

------------------------------

@mrblaze94 - STFU you lame whiner! Convert it yourself if you don't like the format. Remind me again why the fuck Nepotu should do additional work 4 your lazy, ingrate, ass??? I DESPISE lame fucking whiners and complainers. "
,XYippie,2012-11-05T19:14Z,"Um, wow, @poopp00p, who took a big ol' shit in your oatmeal? Eat a fucking Valium; no need to be an anti-social dickwad. Maybe @mrblaze94 is (a) like 13 years old (likely) and/or (b) isn't using a PC to access this? This is a COMMUNITY-supported cloud-based society -- learn how to play well with others or get the fuck out.

@mrblaze94, give me the specs you require and I'LL convert it for you (pixels, frames per second, audio requirements).

Nepotu provides an excellent service to the community. This is the least I can do to contribute back."
[V],Nepotu,2012-11-05T19:23Z,"You're all welcome, guyz! 
The 540p version it's already up. 
Sorry, I can't convert the file in any possible video format. Many times when I search something rare I'd be very happy to find it in any video format, no matter what."
,vonwisdom,2012-11-05T23:11Z,"I lost money cause of this game.
I would never watch it again."
,mrblaze94,2012-11-06T02:25Z,"@poopp00p @XYippie Haha well sorry, I know how to covert it now. Sorry^^

Thank you so much Nepotu for uploading these games. I think you're the only one who uploads games in piratebay. Thanks!!!!"
,poopp00p,2012-11-06T03:41Z,"@XYippie - spoken like a true leech.

Judging by your UL history, you probably don't realize the hassle, work and lost time involved with ULing files for P2P, people you don't even know, and then having some asshole complain about it and.or ""expect"" you to do additional hassle/work because they're too lazy, stupid or stoned to Google it. Let me assure you, it's fucking infuriating. As a former VIP ULer at demonoid and a prolific ULer here (I have 3 different accounts) it's pissant complainers and whiners who burn you out and make one decide to just ""fuck it"" and stop ULing.

As someone who truly appreciates the work involved in ULing rare files like these NFL games, I see it as my duty to tear a new asshole into people who I see as potentially irritating or imposing on the Uler by hopefully teaching them some manners and not screwing things up for the rest of us.

Nepotu not only goes through this hassle for all of us, but he even credits other sources when applicable. He's a class ULer and is what this community is all about... or supposed to be, anyway.

So FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

....and thanks again, Nepotu!

,poopp00p,2012-11-06T03:44Z,@mrblaze94 _ god job manning up and learning to do it yourself. Now consider going one step further and learn how to UL your converted file here for others and credit your source (Nepotu.)
[V],Nepotu,2012-11-06T07:58Z,"You, guys, you're all my friends and thank you for your words. I think is time to us to make it peace. Like the friends do."
,MTLGENTLEMAN,2012-11-06T09:22Z,"Well said Nepotu ! Real touch of class !!

All the best to you & all who follow your Uploads !"
