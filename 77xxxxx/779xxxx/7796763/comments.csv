,idkidd1,2012-11-06T03:34Z,Blackcanary you are posting a lot of great stuff -- keep up the good work!
,BearTrapHarold,2012-11-06T06:01Z,does anyone have the rest of this series
[T],blackcanary,2012-11-06T07:00Z,"When Youngblood was revived in 2012, the series reverted back to its original legacy numbering, hence #71.

Between v3 came (I'm pretty sure) just 1 issue each of Youngblood: Imperial, Youngblood: Bloodsport, and Youngblood: Genesis.  Then came Youngblood v4 #1-9.  I have 1, 7, and 8 and am looking for the others in English (I have them in Spanish)."
,BearTrapHarold,2012-11-06T23:44Z,so how the hell did it get to issue 71 theres notthat many issues put together ever counting team young blood. im confused 
[T],blackcanary,2012-11-07T03:40Z,"Youngblood v1 (11 issues, but starts with #0, so we count 10 issues), Team Youngblood (22 issues), Youngblood Strikefile (11 issues), Youngblood Battlezone (2 issues), Youngblood Genesis (2 issues), Youngblood v2 (11 issues), Youngblood v3 (3 issues), and Youngblood v4 (9 issues) are up to #70.  That doesn't include Youngblood Yearbook, Youngblood v2 Super Special, Extremely Youngblood, Awesome Adventures Youngblood, Awesome Holiday Special Youngblood, Youngblood Bloodsport (2 issues), and Youngblood Imperial (1 issue)."
,BearTrapHarold,2012-11-07T07:02Z,guess that clears that up didnt know about a few of those. hope to see the rest on here at some point and thanks for all the stuff you have been putting up.
