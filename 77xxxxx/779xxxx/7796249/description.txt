A video "marriage manual" explains differences between the sexes and what to expect after you've tied the knot.  Or does it?  Very strange.  Really cool old-fashioned "soap opera" organ soundtrack.  The print itself is in sorry shape, spliced, diced and edited with a hacksaw, but that adds to the fun since the film is incoherent anyhow.  From Something Weird Video.
