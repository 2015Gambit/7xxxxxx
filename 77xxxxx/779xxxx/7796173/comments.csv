,Nachorz,2012-11-06T19:39Z,"Awesome you're the best man! Been looking forward to having this work for pirated copies for so long.

Will you be also doing future possible updates for it? Or instruct people on how to do it themselves on the .upk files of future updates? Thanks again! :) "
,Serenifly,2012-11-06T21:13Z,Oh thank you. I hoped someone may do this
,Cipollino78,2012-11-06T21:30Z,"@Nachorz The torrent is packed with all the stuff i used to fix the upk files,i've also added a readme with a mini-tutorial,so people can do it on their own."
,Nachorz,2012-11-06T22:25Z,"@Cipollino78

Oh didn't notice that, sorry :p

Thanks again though, XCOM just got 10x more fun and balanced thanks to this mod!"
,Cipollino78,2012-11-07T09:05Z,"@Serenifly Thanks for your comment.

@Nachorz Thanks again,but keep in mind that all the credit goes to the creator of WSE,I did a simple fix. Don't wanna steal other people work and efforts."
,Nachorz,2012-11-08T14:21Z,"@Cipollino78

Yeah, really wanted to thank you though for making this compatible with us poor players who can't shell out fifty bucks for this yet :)

But yeah really big kudos to the creator on the Nexus himself, once I save up some spare cash I'll go ahead and buy the game to support the devs as well for this brilliant remake"
,pieps32,2012-11-11T01:35Z,When I run the patcher.bat; I get a .Net framework error which say that he can't find the log.txt. What should I do to resolve that ?
