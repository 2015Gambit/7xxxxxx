Pulled a couple words from here and there about this one...

Pagfeek was a quirky underground comic. It wasn't about sex or drugs or violence or social relevance. It was a thinking hippie's comic, full of clever if obscure wordplay and subtlety. Not surprisingly, one of its earliest endorsements came from Art Spiegelman (eons before Maus).

The main character, mustachioed Great Uncle P. Bosco Wad ("Doc"), whose speech (we always imagined) was delivered with the rhythm and cadence of W. C. Fields. He often speaks to a small frog and scene stealer named Hank.

Creator Mark Morrison's strength is in his deft scripting and character development. His art is on the crude side in this first published effort, and though it gets much better in subsequent "Pagfeek" stories (such as in Snarf #4), he never again had a solo book.
