Hellsing, a secret organization of the British government, have long been battling supernatural threats to keep the people safe from the creatures of the night.

Along with Integra's mysterious butler and Alucard's new vampire minion, Seras Victoria, The Hellsing Organization must face not only regular ghouls and vampires, but a rivalling secret organization from the Vatican, and Millennium, an enigmatic group of madmen spawned by a certain war over 50 years ago...

A bloody battle between monsters is about to begin, the dead are dancing, and all hell is singing...
