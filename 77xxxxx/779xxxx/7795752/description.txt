Football Manager is the best-selling, most realistic football management series ever made. Football Manager 2013 celebrates 20 years of games from the people at Sports Interactive by introducing an array of new features.


NEW TO CAREER MODE
------------------
Match Engine
The 3D match engine has seen huge improvements this year. Everything on the pitch looks more realistic; from the stadiums, the playersΓÇÖ movement, intelligence, and the way the ball moves through the air.

WeΓÇÖve also introduced hundreds of new animations to make the game feel more realistic and weΓÇÖve made the whole experience more televisual by introducing new camera angles and showing the kick-off and final whistle.

Manager Roles
Another notable difference is the significant restructure of the managerΓÇÖs staff and a revamp of their roles. The most obvious is that weΓÇÖve introduced the position of Director of Football into the game for the first time, which will allow managers to pass on some of their workload, such as contract negotiations, if they choose to.

In addition to this, weΓÇÖve also increased the number of specialist coaching roles within the game and given the manager greater flexibility to choose which coaches offer advice and when. The manager can also choose to complain about boardroom interference ΓÇô although that particular option should probably be used sparingly.

And much moreΓÇª
A brand new training system, improved international management, tones in press
conferences & a new user interface.
