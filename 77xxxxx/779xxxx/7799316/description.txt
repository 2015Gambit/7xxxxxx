Pippa Wright - Unsuitable Men - AZW3, ePub, MOBI - Barbie1710


After eleven years of coupled-up domesticity, Rory Carmichael is single for the first time in her adult life. Even she would admit that her ex-boyfriend Martin wasn't the most exciting man in the world -- let's face it, his idea of a rocking night was one spent updating his Excel spreadsheets -- but Rory could rely on him and, having watched her mother rack up four turbulent marriages, that's what matters.

In an effort to reinvigorate both her love life and her lacklustre career at posh magazine Country House, she sets herself a mission to date as many unsuitable men as possible. Toyboys.

But if Mr Right can turn out to be so wrong, maybe one of her Mr Wrongs will turn out to be just right ...
