NOTES:

Ok took the 720p file that was pretty nice but had hardcoded korsubs :(....so opted to crop the bottom line and
blur the top line of subs.Noticed alot of releases did one or the other,so thought i'd give another option for ya.
Also tweaked the contrast levels as i thought the video was lacking some aswell as tweaking the rgb colours as it
was too pink for me.
Also messed with a smoother and sharpen filter aswell....

Audio i had to re-encode as it would open in vdub for some reason ,as when i opened it in xpress,it came up as 5 channels
but only the left and right channels had any audio hmmm
Anyway just encoded to AC3 2 channel and then remuxed to my rip.

Retail will be soon anyway,but what the hell ....here ya go.
