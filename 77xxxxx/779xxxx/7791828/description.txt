100% working. 

Simply;

1. Mount and install the 2 DVDs.

2. Install the 1.7 patch in the second directory. (In the Windows folder)

3. Install the 1.9.5 patch in the third directory.


Launch the VST from your DAW. Use Keygen. Follow instructions on the VST. (Remove it, and open it again - voila)


I do not take credit for this release, I simply put everything together with simple instructions that actually work.
