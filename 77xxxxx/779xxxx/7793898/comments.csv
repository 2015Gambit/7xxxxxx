,yarnek,2012-11-05T20:12Z,It is scary how many dummies and haters there are out there. Thanks VTV.
,angelabeagle,2012-11-06T03:22Z,I can't watch it. You have to go to a site to get a password to be able to watch it. In this site they ask you to answer a questionnaire! What's happening here?
,firexninja,2012-11-06T07:01Z,thank you!
,swoodruff,2012-11-06T07:07Z,"@angelabeagle - Don't be a bitch.

Thanks VTV!"
,moxnox,2012-11-06T20:49Z,The people complaining about a password or a questionnaire are obviously clicking on the big green fake DOWNLOAD button ad instead of clicking on the Get this torrent link. And they are too dumb to realize it and also to install adblock ;)
,RiverRaidII,2012-11-07T11:20Z,"Holy Pop-Up Batman! There are still people out there who don't use adblock(ing)?
And I was wondering what you mean with that big green fake button. 

The Torrent is of course top notch.
A10/V10"
