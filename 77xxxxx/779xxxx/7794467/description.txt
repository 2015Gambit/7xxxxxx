This vinyl rip is based off the remastered 2011 re-issue vinyl and comes from a vinyl disc which has been kept in great quality, only having been played a handful of times prior. After being ripped, the files were run through Pro Tools and very slightly tweaked to fix a few audio flaws. There are still occasional nasty noises mid song, but for the most part, the exceptions being where the record is extremely quiet, the sound is extremely clean.

The tracks are all presented to you in 44.1 khz 16 bit lossless FLAC files with level 0 encoding.
