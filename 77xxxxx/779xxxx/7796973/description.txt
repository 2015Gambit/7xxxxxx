 Richard La Ruina used to be the guy who couldnΓÇÖt get the girl. Shy, painfully awkward, and still living at home with his mother, at twenty-five he decided to finally take control of his life and become the kind of man men admire and women desire. Today, La Ruina is one of the worldΓÇÖs best-known pickup artists, someone who can confidently approach and attract any woman.
 La Ruina, as founder of PUA Training (Pickup Artist Training), has personally coached thousands of men through their own dramatic transformations. 

 In The Natural, he brings that experience to you, delivering field-tested methods and easy-to-use tools for attracting the women you want. Just like riding a bike or driving a car, meeting women and making them fall for you is a learned skill that, with enough practice, becomes effortless. ThereΓÇÖs no need for tricks, gimmicks, or lies. Instead, these methods make you more confident and therefore more attractive to women. Using the tools in The Natural, youΓÇÖll finally feel comfortable in your own skin and have the ability to attract women just by being yourself. From body language to conversation starters, eye contact to the first touch, The Natural is a step-by-step blueprint for being the guy women canΓÇÖt resist.
