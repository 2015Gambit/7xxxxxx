From beyond the farthest frontiers of any solar system explored by man, a destructive force is sweeping through the universe wiping Callystes, Dakoi, Lilith and Planet Earth from the stellar map. A rocket full of refugees hurtles through space with the letter "K" emblazoned on its side. On board the unlikely crew of seven children, several adults, an ancient wizard-knight and the ghost of a cyborg travel with a mysterious cargo that will alter their fates forever.
