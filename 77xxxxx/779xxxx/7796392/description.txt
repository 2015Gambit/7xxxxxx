The third album by Polish bard Jacek Kaczmarski. As the author himself said about it: "Krzyk is composed of songs made in 1974-1980. It's a diagnosis of a man in a hopeless situation, incapacitated with history, politicians and his own weakness; his only weapons is an irony or a scream of despair". "Ob┼éawa" is one of his most famous songs, very often covered by the later Polish artists.
