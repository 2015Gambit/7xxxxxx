Zach Mullins, Casey Philips, Jessica Santiago, and Mark Wexler are four typical high school students confronting all the usual problems kids face - peer pressure, self doubt, and getting a date for the prom. But life takes a most unexpected turn when these four teens are thrown together by a highly unlikely bond: each has the nearly-unique ability to see and hear a vast army of demons that have secretly infested their town. Can our young quartet stem this devilish tide? Or will El Dorado City - and the world - fall beneath cloven hooves?
