You're sitting in your hotel lounge sipping Elijah Craig, wondering where to go first when a tiny oriental gal walks in and sits at the bar.  She's very petite and big eyes, nice little legs and these fantastic ocelot platform pumps.  Obviously she is not a happy lady.  But you hear her order a bourbon in perfect English so you decide to speak to her.  She says she's from Beijing but her boyfriend didn't show to come with her, so she's all alone in Taiwan.

What on earth could you do but offer to spend time with her?

Here's Tina, the ten of your dreams.  Make her smile please.
