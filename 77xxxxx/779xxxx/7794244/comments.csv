bone ur the best"
,FictionRyu,2012-11-05T19:39Z,"What does it mean by ""Web Rip"" ?

I'd like a few more comments about how the quality is of this movie. IE: If the audio is out of sync or something like that. The screen captures seem to show pretty good quality, but you can't always trust them. "
,BreezeTDK,2012-11-05T21:49Z,"@bronsongotn
could you update your rating system, if you are going to have blu ray and dvd next to each other then you can shorten the list to:
1 blu ray
2 dvd
3 okay
4 unwatchable
otherwise you need to add a few between blu ray and dvd, you know like blu ray, 1080p, 1080i, 720p, 720i, 480p, 480i, dvd.  I probably have that wrong and please believe me, I am not trying to be an asshole.  I see your ratings a lot and would appreciate them even more if they were more accurate.  Thanks!"

Yes, I plagiarized from ""The Candidate"", but it's spot on."
,epicfrog,2012-11-06T05:37Z,"hey, people with useless comments. you're murdering our internet society. if someone is trolling and writes something that is offensive and obviously malicious, don't bother writing back. it's just as pointless to do."
,djxeroic,2012-11-06T07:25Z,when i drop a load in GoMiG's washing machine it doesn't follow me around for three weeks.

,trace535,2012-11-06T19:16Z,"Meh, I'll wait for a non-cropped version, you should have left the subs in instead (the resolution should be 720x388, not 720x320)."
,Kalerov,2012-11-06T19:29Z,Anyone have found any eng or swesub for this?

Good effort 'tho bone, thanks."
,Thracky,2012-11-06T23:52Z,angelpunem: With a player like UMPlayer you can easily adjust the audio/video synch with the + and - buttons...

,Phatfish,2012-11-07T18:52Z,"A/V - Comparable with a average dvdscreener. No watermarks.

M - The jokes are fukkin great. You will laugh. But the movie concept as a whole is a stereotypical Hollywood cheese formula. Seen 1000+ b4. Very boring. And I cant think of a unfunnier person then Mark Fuckberg, obviously ruins half the movie."
