When Thor, The God Of Thunder, is driven mad by the machinations of the evil Valkyrie, he sets out to destroy The Nine Worlds.  The most powerful heroes in the universe may not be able to stop him.  See Thor tear through the ranks of:  Beta Ray Bill; the Silver Surfer; Adam Warlock; Dr. Strange; Drax, The Destroyer; and Thanos.  And when the mad Thor gets his hands on the Infinity Gem Of Power, even Odin may be powerless to stop him.
