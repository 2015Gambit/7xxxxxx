One more day guys. We have to get out tomorrow and vote for the lesser of the two liberals. Romney is going to be a Bush type disaster, but it is still a smaller disaster than the Obama type disaster. Get up and vote, but don't get your hopes up. Get your friends to vote, but don't promise them any change. If we know one thing about the Republican leadership, it is that they have a lot more in common with the Democrat base than the Conservative base. Their first order of business is appeasing the New York Times, and not doing the right thing. It looks like Romney will win in a landslide, but that is going to be the beginning of the headaches for us.
