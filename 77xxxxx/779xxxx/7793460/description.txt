Wine flavor chemistry is a complex and diverse field that ranges from the potently aromatic pyrazines to the complex polymeric tannins. Modern chemistry is now opening some doors to the mysteries of wine flavor, and this unique monograph is dedicated to current research developments. The book starts with the Riesling terpenes, which responsible for floral aroma when new and the kerosene-like aroma that appears in old age, and with the chemically related norisprenoids found in Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. It includes three reports on flavors of microbial origin, particularly the effects of different yeast strains, and it looks at important factors in aging, including acetalhyde, the contribution of oak, and problems with cork taint. It also explores in detail the relationship between winemaking techniques and the chemistry and taste attributes of phenolic compounds.
