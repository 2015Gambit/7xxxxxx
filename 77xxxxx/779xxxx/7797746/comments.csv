,ThatTunechi,2012-11-06T19:22Z,i agree he should put the vid bit rate up a little but his torrents are not crap.kys if u think the only good uploader is rudos.
,P.B.R.,2012-11-06T21:19Z,"Thank you scene4all and HBcrew for the upload. Mann, i can't believe that some ingrate people will complain for FREE stuff, all they have to do is click to download and watch and it costs NONE, if you don't like it DON'T download it , that simple  !!!!!"
,SonnyPLG,2012-11-07T03:31Z,"I agree with BAshKd, wirke, wirke .. it just feel weird after see this rip.. shadowing @_@"
,BAshKd,2012-11-07T06:19Z,"@P.B.R free or not I simply want scene4all to upload rudos works not hb. There is something better out there thats also free.
I hate it when people, know something isn't a good rip and there are others who can do better, say stuff like don't complain... Its not the only rip available and quality counts free or not "
,SMOAK-inc,2012-11-08T05:00Z,"I gotta agree. I come to scene4all's uploads for all my WWE needs. And this one is just terrible. Dark ugliness, fuzzy, and incredibly long blank screens for commercial breaks. I don't blame scene4all though. Thanks for the upload scene but I'd just suggest taking a thorough look through any more that are done by HBCrew."
