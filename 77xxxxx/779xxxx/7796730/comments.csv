,ChillReb,2012-11-08T04:46Z,"BTW, if your looking for loops here on TPB, a good choice is Artytorrent ... They're mostly listed for Windows, but will work for MAC too ... Just search Artytorrent ..."
,grn8,2012-11-08T15:41Z,"@psydeep Hey man, I remember you dude, I got many synths and fx from you on demonoid. Its good to know that it was you. Well Thank you so much man. You are really doing a great service for poor and wannabe musicians, like me. But im sorry man, most of rich and successful musicians in INDIA use these stuff, Its a shame.  "
