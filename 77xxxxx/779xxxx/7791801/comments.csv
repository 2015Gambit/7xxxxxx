[T],FatFreddy271,2012-11-05T00:14Z,"Those are subtitles from a movie from 2006 called ""holly"" this is holy motors "
,JarjarTwink,2012-11-05T00:22Z,FUCK YOU. no subs. 
,JarjarTwink,2012-11-05T01:58Z,"well i watched it without subtitles they don't say much anyways. i'm angry at you BOZX, not that you care, but thx anyways. "
[V],GoodFilms,2012-11-06T01:52Z,"Personally, I think it's better to wait for a subtitled version before uploading, but it's pretty ridiculous to be ""angry"" at someone who's giving you quality shit for free, especially since he never claimed that there were subtitles in the first place."
,PSotero,2012-11-06T04:43Z,"Great quality, thanks!"
,boognigg,2012-11-07T03:03Z,if someone can translate I can sub

here are french subs they can be translated with subtitle edit"
,thankyoutoall,2012-11-07T23:26Z,"frmanolo, I dont mean to be rude.  I translated those subs (google translate worked perfect) and they are 10%.  I guess whats why Its titled ""Rough""  Just so you guys know, those subs above, those subs are only 70 long. A normal foreign film (like untouchables) was 1600 lines of words.  We need a better one. :("
,boognigg,2012-11-08T00:33Z,I'm pretty sure those subs are for the English parts only so their not gonna help much.
,boognigg,2012-11-08T00:38Z,I think those subs are for french people who don't speak english.
,JarjarTwink,2012-11-09T03:23Z,"@goodfilms i agree with you but if we don't nag, complain and behave like 9 year olds how will they know they have to keep a quality standard =)"
