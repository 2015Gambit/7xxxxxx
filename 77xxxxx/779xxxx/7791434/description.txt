Altium Designer v10.1271.26245 (Update 22, 1 Nov 2012)

** NOTE:
** Altium Designer 10.x.x Toolkit is SEPARATE torrent
** Why? Its normaly the only content on DVD2 for ALL 10.x.x
** releases so it saves you bandwidth... Makes the software
** less footprint to update instead of downloading the whole
** schmuck of unessecary stuff a zillion times.... //Longword

En/Ru

For more installation instructions, READ the threads on the other (older)
Altium torrents from me. Contains lots of important and "nice to know"
things that will save you from grey hairs...
