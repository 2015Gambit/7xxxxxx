Hallmark-Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade [2012]

Air Date: 4 Nov 2012

Summary: Two former arch enemies, each desperate to put on the best Thanksgiving Day Parade in the history of Chicago, will throw caution to the wind (and, directly into the path of marching bands, horses and riders) and fall in love before the last brightly festooned float rounds the corner in "Love At the Thanksgiving Day Parade," a Hallmark Channel Original Movie starring Autumn Reeser ("No Ordinary Family") and Antonio Cupo ("Bomb Girls"), premiering Holiday 2012. Ben Cotton ("Hellcats") also stars in the film. Hallmark Channel's "Countdown to Christmas" is the biggest holiday destination on television, premiering more original holiday programs than any other network. 

Chicago native Emily Jones (Reeser) loves her city, and has dedicated her career to coordinating its beloved Thanksgiving Day parade every year. This year, Emily is hoping for a memorable holiday and anticipating a long-awaited proposal from her long-distance boyfriend Brian (Cotton). Then, the parade director hires a wealthy development consultant, Henry Williams (Cupo), to analyze the finances of the parade and increase profits. Immediately writing Henry off as a privileged playboy, Emily worries he will ruin the joyful spirit of the parade, not knowing how much it means to the city like she does. As the two are forced to work together to pull off a successful production, Emily is determined to show Henry she's in charge. But when Emily suffers a sudden setback, she starts to rely on Henry to help her through it, and suddenly realizes she might be falling for him. As Thanksgiving draws nearer, can Emily confess her true feelings and end the feud, while still putting on the parade of her dreams?
