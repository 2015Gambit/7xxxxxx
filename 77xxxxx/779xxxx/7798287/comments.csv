,Banghal,2012-11-06T23:56Z,"So what's the point of such torrent, if you couldn't wait until you upload 42 mb; before you leave the torrent being dead..."
,DK77,2012-11-07T01:12Z,uploader seed you fuck! why upload and not seed?? how people can be so dumb...
,larukuhyde,2012-11-07T01:27Z,"I wasn't able to download here, but I got the editor from somewhere else.  I ran into the same error with fonts.  After 1 hour of research and playing around I finally figure out the problem.

let's say your fm folder is c:programsegafm, you have to put the editor under the same folder as your fm folder, in this case, c:programsega.  So your game would be in c:programsegafm and your editor would be in c:programsegafm editor.  Do not put the editor directly into the game folder.

Hope this helps.  Have fun."
,LongHorn12,2012-11-07T09:38Z,"If anybody got lucky and downloaded the file will he please share it with us. CreepySpook why did you upload the file if you are not willing to seed?

,jfc_campos,2012-11-07T12:31Z,working?
,pirconan,2012-11-07T16:07Z,"Not working- @larukuhyde is right FM2012 editor had it's own folder (let's say d:FM12editor)

but i've tried that -NOT working, and i've tried puting editor files directly into game folder -again NOT working.. i even tried to edit specialfolders.xml and again NOT working.

fuckin lazy SKIDROW.. and fuuuuuckin SEGA i'm not going to buy any of ur shitty games EVER on general principle"
,pirconan,2012-11-07T17:06Z,"Ok after 2 hours of experimenting it finally working!!! fuckin lazy skidrow and fuckin sega-y

First you have to unpack files into EDITOR folder, for example d: FM13editor

then edit special folder.xml (located there) replacing every line '..football manager 2013  data' with your game location (for example 'd: fm13data'

finally start the game, go to preferances and disable/untick cache option there.

that's it. "
