How is it possible that such an impressive album remained unknown for decades, when a similar (though less important) titles appeared on CD several times? Without a doubt Hate (with their only LP) are one of the most underrated UK progressive bands from early 70's! This dark, sinister and sometimes psychedelic music resembled a combination of early Procol Harum/Atomic Rooster-like Hammond organ sounds; tasty guitar leads and emotional, Spooky Tooth-like vocals. The session was engineered by Tom Allom who 10 years later gained fame by producting albums for Judas Priest and Def Leppard. Carefully remastered Hate Kills LP is simply a lost, progressive gem!
