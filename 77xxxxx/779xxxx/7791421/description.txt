Gary Lineker introduces highlights from the Premier League. Arsenal visit Old Trafford to face a Manchester United that now features Robin van Persie, who was a Gunners hero before making a big-money switch to United over the summer.

Champions Manchester City are at West Ham, while early-season pace-setters Chelsea make the journey across the Welsh border to tackle Swansea. Wigan travel down to White Hart Lane to play Tottenham, almost exactly three years after they were famously thrashed 9-1 there.

Martin O'Neill's Sunderland host his former club Aston Villa, while the day's other two games see Everton face Fulham at Craven Cottage, and Norwich and Stoke meet at Carrow Road.
