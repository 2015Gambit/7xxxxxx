What's on my mind ?? On my mind is a better world.. On my mind is revolution.. Just imagine you are sitting in front of your doctor and you realize that a lot is at stake at the tip of his pen. And then you have this beautiful dream, when all the healers all over the world become one and a million ears listen for your heart, a million hands feel for your pain.. Make this dream come true... No matter who you 
are, just share this post and ask your doctor to join
 

Am i doing this for my selfish motives ? No, just because I don't exist...

Continuing Medical Education is a facebook group which has saved hundreds of lives by now..Just by uniting the brains of doctors around the world, why cant we create a global clinical masterbrain so that even a doctor in the remotest village can get opinions from expert doctors all over the world ?
