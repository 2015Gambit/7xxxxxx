And yes, thanks for all the work Nepotu & to all the cappers too, for without them Nepotu couldn't provide us with the games."

You sound like a good person, but Lechuck is right, please don't post spoilers---that is, comments that might give away the result or scores of any particular game.

Nepotu, as always, a big THANKS.

SF 49ers game coming up soon?"
