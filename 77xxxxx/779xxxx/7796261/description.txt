Please verify the PGP signature against my attached public key before extracting.
Discard the archive if verification fails.

Please note: Because of the MPAA/RIAA's pathetic new campaign to make ISPs their 
flunkies, I am now *requiring* full stream encryption for all BitTorrent connections.
If you aren't encrypted, I can't upload to you; upgrade to a modern client!
