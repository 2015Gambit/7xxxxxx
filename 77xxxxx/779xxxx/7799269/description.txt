Hetman FAT Recovery

Supporting all versions and revisions of the FAT file system, Hetman FAT Recovery can recover files from USB flash drives, all types of memory cards, hard disks and other types of storage media as long as they bear FAT, FAT16 or FAT32. Hetman FAT Recovery can recover files and folders from formatted, repartitioned, corrupted and inaccessible drives ΓÇô or perform a quick and simple undelete on photos, music and videos kept on a hard disk, flash drive, or stored in your digital camera or MP3 player.

Supporting all versions of the FAT file system, Hetman FAT Recovery can recover disks and flash drives formatted with all versions of Windows up to the latest Windows 7, restore information from memory cards used in compact and SLR digital cameras, and recover data from MP3 players connected to your computer via a USB cable.

Hetman FAT Recovery features a number of convenience tools making the recovery as easy as one-two-three. The fully guided step-by-step wizard takes you through the whole recovery process with no sweat. The available pre-recovery preview instantly displays the content of recoverable files in ΓÇÿliveΓÇÖ mode ΓÇô before you even save them.

At the same time, Hetman FAT Recovery features the most comprehensive file recovery algorithms, sharing its data recovery engine with one used in the much more expensive, top-of-the-line product. The proprietary signature-search algorithm analyzes the entire content of the drove being recovered in order to locate all recoverable files and folders. By reading the entire drive instead of just the file system, Hetman FAT Recovery can reliably locate and extract more files than competing undelete tools.

Thanks to its highly sophisticated file recovery engine, Hetman FAT Recovery can easily recover files from formatted and repartitioned hard disks, undelete files and folders from healthy and damaged media, and extract pictures, videos, music, documents and many other types of files from corrupted, damaged and inaccessible USB flash drives and memory cards such as SD, microSD, SDHC/SDXC, Compact Flash, SONY Memory Stick and many others. You can store files being recovered on another (healthy) disk, burn to CD/DVD or use FTP upload to store them to a remote location.

Hetman FAT Recovery can reliably recover information from hard drives with missing or altered partition structures, restore data from drives with damaged master boot record (MBR), reconstructing the original file and folder structure. If you need a complete solution to recover lost data from flash media, Hetman FAT Recovery represents the best value.
