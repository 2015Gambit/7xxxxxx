"Hard Sell" tells you things about the American pharmaceutical industry you'd rather not know and about practices you'd rather weren't happening. But once you pick it up, you won't want to put this book down.Jamie Reidy is to the pharmaceutical business what Jerry Maguire was to professional sports and Frank Abagnale ("Catch Me If You Can") was to bank fraud. He's the guy who's been there, done that, and walked away with the insider stories. You'll find yourself rooting for Reidy and at the same time, you'll be shocked by the realities of the world that paid his salary.

"Hard Sell" is a witty expose; of an industry that touches nearly everyone in contemporary America. It reveals the questionable practices of drug reps, nurses, and even physicians. Reidy traces his ups and downs as a rep for giant drug manufacturer Pfizer, maker of some of the most widely prescribed and used drugs in existence, including Viagra.

With equal parts self-confidence and self-mockery, Reidy tells it like it is in the drug-selling trenches that are our local doctors' offices. The result is a funny and fascinating book.
