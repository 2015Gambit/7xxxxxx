[V],footy,2012-11-04T18:22Z,"News - Vettel excluded from qualifying results for fuel infringement - after the stewards found his car did not have sufficient fuel (1 Litre) onboard to comply with the rules on its return to parc ferme. He will start from the pit lane.

I think makes the championship much more exciting!"

,bmcghie,2012-11-04T18:55Z,"I had to check the F1 site after quali... yes, very exciting now! I don't think Alonso's car is fast enough for qualifying, but he seems to have good race pace.

I dunno if Hamilton was a fluke in quali... but he has a shot if he keeps that up! 

Thanks ever so much for your uploads, footy. We all appreciate them greatly!"

But I was somewhat confused by the posted comments (I take them to be old News) at first because they sounded like this was the Qualifying not the Race, but then I remembered you always deliver them in one package. Cheers mate!!"

,Cock_Pushup,2012-11-07T04:26Z,"Thanks as always, footy!!I've been able to watch every race this season thanks to you. Finally starting to warm up to the Sky Sports crew..

IMO, the mention of Vettel's penalty wasn't much of a spoiler, as they start talking about it immediately into the broadcast. It should be assumed anyone about to watch the race already knows about qualifying. Great race!"
,D05HU,2012-11-07T14:10Z,"Thanks for the great upload.. and ruining qualy for me as I hadnt watched it yet.. :)

With the amount of uploads though you have earned that right.. "
