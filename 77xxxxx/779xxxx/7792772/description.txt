Axis: Bold as Love, the second album released by The Jimi Hendrix Experience and released in 1967 as a follow up to their remarkable debut "Are You Experienced", has since gone down as one of the most outstanding classics of 60's rock music. Aside from Hendrix's noted influential guitar work, combining drugged-out experimentation and sheer madman-esque genious, the album's music soaks with his infectious and groovy guitar licks, riffing away in such an acute and precise matter as if the strings were made of butter. 


With classics such as "Spanish Castle Magic", "Little Wing", "Castles Made of Sand", and "One Rainy Wish", this album is absolutely unmissable, if for no other reason than its notoriety as one of the most influential pieces of music in the last century.
