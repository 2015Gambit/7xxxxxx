|There are no well established activation bypass as of yet, so I have not  |
|included them.                                                            |

|No Windows 8 Settings were harmed in the making of this ISO.              |
|No Programs are added.                                                    |
|No Unattended Settings were added to the installation.                    |
|No Registry Settings were modified.                                       |

|Either burn the included .iso file to a dvdr or use a usb flash drive.    |
|I have included diskpart instructions and the win7usb tool.               |
|I personally use diskpart and winrar, but the tool may be easier.         |

|Installations included:                                                   |
|Windows 8 32-bit, Windows 8 N 32-bit, Windows 8 Pro 32-bit,               |
|Windows 8 Pro N 32-bit, Windows 8 Pro VL 32-bit,                          |
|Windows 8 PRO N VL 32-bit, Windows 8 Pro with Media Center 32-bit,        |
|Windows 8 Enterprise 32-bit, Windows 8 Enterprise N 32-bit                |

|NOTE: The only known method of being able to activate the Pro with Media  |
|Center editions is to first install with Pro; Activate that pro online or |
|Using the phone method (Turn off your internet and try to activate).      |
|After Activating Pro, BACKUP YOUR activation with Advanced Tokens Manager |
|3.5 beta 3 or later.  Then disable your internet and attempt to activate a|
|Windows 8 Media Pack key via Phone Method. To start adding the Media Pack |
|Key press windows+f and type "add fe", click on settings, then click on   |
|the Add Features program.  The rest is self explanatory. If you manage to |
|get Pro with Media Center activated, make sure to BACKUP the activation.  |
|Attempt this at your own risk.                                            |
|----------------------------------murphy78--------------------------------|
|To restore a backed up key with Advanced Tokens Manager you need to first |
|open an Admin Command Prompt (winkey+x, click admin prompt)               |
|Then, in the command prompt type "slmgr /upk" without the quotes. Press   |
|enter and you should get a popup window saying key removed.  Run the      |
|Advanced Tokens Manager as admin (right click, select run as admin)       |
|If the backup directory is found, you should be able to click restore.    |
|To restore a Pro WMC install, repeat the process twice. It's just a quirk.|

|I have personally tested every install on this ISO.  It should not        |
|require a setup key as there is a skip button, but if it does, I have     |
|included some default install keys.  I have not verified them as working. |
|Use them at your own risk.                                                |

|These MSDN iso sources have pre-release EULA on some of the installations.|
|All reports indicate that the binaries are exactly the same as the ones   |
|in the retail dvds.  If you don't like it, don't use it. If you want to   |
|use a retail version, you need a retail key. The programs are the same.   |
