,solutioN-Ghost,2012-11-07T18:39Z,"this is the real deal, finally! tested, working fine against bots, not sure if Online though but it's awesome, thanks! I lost all my achievements though, haha!"
,solutioN-Ghost,2012-11-07T19:50Z,"I have a problem though. When I play against bots, the game lags from time to time and making it difficult for me to play. This doesn't happen when I play it during the Free Weekend CSGO. Did you or the crack provider change any settings? Cause I just found out that my rate is 7500 when I check in console when it is suppose to be 35000 during when I play the Free Weekend CSGO. I changed back my rate to 35000 but the lag still occur from time to time and I'm afraid there are still that has not been changed. I want my untouched original settings back when I download the free CSGO "
,shahril,2012-11-07T23:20Z,"Ok @umer111, I try with all your solution, but new error occur, it's say that ""this game require steam"" but I already open the steam, I also try to open it with administrator but same problem happen  :(  see this picture -> http://i.imgur.com/cU4a4.png"
,Luis_Figo,2012-11-08T01:12Z,"shahril, i think you don't need to do anything that umer111 said, just open from ""start_go.exe"", not from ""csgo.exe"". that's the problem."
,shahril,2012-11-08T02:54Z,"Ok, here is what i'm doing to install this game :-

1. Download this game
2. Extract ""CS_GO Cracked by umer111.rar"" and move folder into ""C:Program FilesSteamsteamappscommonCounter-Strike Global Offensive""
3. Download crack, and extract crack into directory of CS GO.
4. Edit ""steam.inf"" value from 480 into 730.
5. Edit ""video.txt"" inside ""/csgo/cfg"".
6. Open steam and login with my account.
7. Open CS GO ""start_go.exe"".

But problem was not solved, CS GO always close after dark screen appear. :("
,Edward_PTM,2012-11-08T04:38Z,"lol. DO NOT OPEN STEAM ACCOUNT.. it`s only non-steam version. which means..  works ,only on non-steam servers   . Steam servers after gametracker  or steam account , will never work on a pirated version aka non-steam.. you get the idea?"
,skatrpro1987,2012-11-08T07:25Z,"There is a version that works that i've tested myself without the free weekend version. I've been playing this game for a few months now from nicoo7t crack with his game files.
http://www.nicoo7t.com/2012/07/counter-strike-global-offensive.html
The only problem is for those whove already downloaded the game from TPB will have to redownload nicoo7ts CSGO files. I've tested his crack on all other versions and it only works on nicoo7ts CSGO files. 
It Does Really Work Just Alot To Download Over."
,Luis_Figo,2012-11-08T12:19Z,"i have the weekend free files, so i don't know if in this torrent are the same game files... but that's what i've done and got my game working:
-simply downloaded the crack from torrent description (http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/6/24/2487605/csgo_crack.zip)
-paste the content of the zip arhive in my global offensive folder. 
-i didn't change anything, ""steam_appid.txt"" already was 730. 
-after i've pasted the crack archive content in my go folder, i simply started the game from ""start_go.exe"" ... i repeat: ""START_GO.EXE"". 
-i didn't change anything else, i didn't start Steam. OF COURSE I DIDN'T START STEAM, isn't like i've buyed the game, no ? "

,solutioN-Ghost,2012-11-10T04:57Z,"I don't know whether this CSGO torrent is from the Free Weekend but I don't download it. I only download the crack provided because I still have my CSGO from the Free Weekend deal. Here's what I do :-

1. Extract all the files from the crack folder to Counter-Strike Global Offensive main folder.

2. Go to csgo folder and find Steam.inf. open it, change ""appID=730"" to 480 and save.

3. It's done, now run ""revLoader"" to change Player Name and finally run ""start_go"" to Play! Don't run Steam while playing :|

Simple as that. Didn't know why some of you encounter problems. Try running ""start_go"" as Administrator, see if it helps :)"

Well it is already over, sorry. It is on Steam last 01st Nov-5th Nov, now the Free Weekend is over. It's unfortunate that you guys don't have it. Just download this torrent perhaps?"
,solutioN-Ghost,2012-11-16T10:45Z,"@umer111

CSGO has just been updated, in regard with molotov and inc grenade. Is it possible for you to update those files? Thanks"
