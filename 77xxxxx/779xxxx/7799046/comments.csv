,kewkluder,2012-11-06T20:01Z,Does this work good or does it crash like skidrow's release?
,cbcruz,2012-11-06T20:14Z,"Installing now. Will let you know ASAP. Will start with as many leagues as I did on the Skidrow one, and will see if I can do what I couldn't do on that one. 

Give me 5 minutes"
,cbcruz,2012-11-06T20:15Z,Make that 10. Installing looks like it will take a bit longer than I thought.
,tiwliwlaZZ,2012-11-06T20:28Z,How is this different than SKIDROW version? Is it up-to-date? Are the crashes fixed?
,cbcruz,2012-11-06T20:28Z,"STILL CRASHING.

NOT WORKING."
,D5K6,2012-11-06T20:31Z,work?
,cbcruz,2012-11-06T20:32Z,"comments not showing, so I'm making another comment to view the comments lol"
,rotciveg,2012-11-06T20:33Z,"fake, it's NFS MW crack"
,kewkluder,2012-11-06T20:49Z,"Crash at the same places as SKIDROW's release.
Dont download!"
,AndUp,2012-11-06T20:52Z,tnx cbcruz for information
,cbcruz,2012-11-06T20:53Z,.
,cbcruz,2012-11-06T20:54Z,"^No problem

To the user who said it was fake: Well it's not fake. It IS FM 2013. It's just it has the same problem as the skidrow one."
[T],Sunblock.,2012-11-06T21:05Z,same crash issues like the rest
,tiwliwlaZZ,2012-11-06T21:05Z,So Catalyst did actually nothing. Took the same files and put them on an intaller. This is pointless.
,helicon84,2012-11-06T23:05Z,"Whoever is giving this release a minus is just stupid. It's FM2013, a smaller release than SKIDROW's, and it works. You only have to wait for a fix to solve the crashing issues. If you're not satisfied with a 'free game' then go and buy it and actually repay the fantastic work the people behind FM have done. "
,Silvak,2012-11-07T02:36Z,Could you upload Colour Bind and/or Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten please?
,JoeKKer,2012-11-07T05:08Z,Guyz Its The Cracks Problem Not The Game's Problem
,przelotem,2012-11-07T12:02Z,"Do NOT download, pointless. Still crashing."
,nox234558,2012-11-08T11:56Z,tnx for this do you know when you will upload cod black ops 2 ;)
