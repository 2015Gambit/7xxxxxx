Time runs smoothly due to the efforts of extraordinary individuals known as Chrono Mechanics. This first issue begins as a gang of vicious Chronomites attack Team 9.2 of Sector 7 on their daily work commute through the time stream. Things only get worse when they suffer the loss of a team member during the battle and are assigned a new, accident-prone recruit who is so inept that he is unable to hold a wrench or power up his own work suit! The Foreman arrives on the scene to find their ship abandoned, the rookie missing, and a dark entity hiding in the disabled ship. With no way to reach the Mechanics, Chrono, Inc. might be forced to 'reboot' time itself!
