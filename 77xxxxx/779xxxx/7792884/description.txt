FaceNiff 2.1b Cracked

FaceNiff is an Android app that allows you to sniff and intercept web session profiles over the WiFi that your mobile is connected to.
It is possible to hijack sessions only when WiFi is not using EAP, but it should work over any private networks (Open/WEP/WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK)
It's kind of like Firesheep for android. Maybe a bit easier to use (and it works on WPA2!). More info here: http://faceniff.ponury.net/

Instruction:

1. Run .apk with your WiFi on

2. Install it, then close it.

3. Open Unlock.apk

4. Unlock the app

5. Feel free to uninstall the unlocker and run FaceNiff

6. That's it
