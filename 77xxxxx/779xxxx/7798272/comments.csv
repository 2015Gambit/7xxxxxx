,jchen9999,2012-11-07T02:38Z,please upload the avi version
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-11-07T04:54Z,"There is no avi version. You will have to either convert it, or watch it on your PC using VLC Media player. I'm sorry but I don't have the time to convert it and re-up it :("
,djt067,2012-11-07T09:29Z,"thx Gary.  Is there any chance at all you will do 'I'm a celebrity get me out of here'? or will you leave that to tv team etc.  Just that as we follow you all the time and you are so reliable I wondered if you would be intersted at all in this one.  Prob is I think its on everyday, which is alot for you given what you already do... anyway thx mate."
,bexwey,2012-11-07T14:18Z,"Gaz, help!!!  No one is doing Geordie shore, the new season started last night!!  I already have to wait 5 days for someone to upload The Valleys, i cant wait that long for my Geordie Fix!!!!! PLEASE xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
,bexwey,2012-11-07T15:23Z,"Oh, Dont worry, you can watch it on the MTV site, crisis averted, lol ;) "
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-11-07T22:48Z,"Sorry mate, I won't be doing I'm a celebrity. It is too much for me. I might have to have another operation, so I will only be uploading MIC from now on (That is considering I find it to upload!!). If I do have to go for the op, it will be in January, so I will still be around til then :)"
,djt067,2012-11-08T09:20Z,hope everything goes ok Gary. We appreciate your efforts greatly.
