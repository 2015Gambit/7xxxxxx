Same as other Asphalt 7 game, only the latest version. This is version 1.0.2
Installed on my JB'd 32Gb iPad 3, works flawlessly...

TO INSTALL:
Download file to computer and add file to iTunes. You must have App Sync installed on your idevice for this proceedure to work. Connect your idevice to the computer making sure to check the app in the pre-sync section as normal and sync with itunes. DONE!!

Will seed as long as possible so as to get it out there...

Happy Racing
