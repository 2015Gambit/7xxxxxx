,Enoxx86,2012-11-06T22:31Z,"When in dashlaunch press LB and you will be in the setting mode of dashlaunch. 
Next go to Unload Dashlaunch, and unload it. 
Then go up to the launch folder and bring up the .xex file you want to load and the game will no longer freeze on the 0 second mark. "
,dunit80,2012-11-07T04:19Z,Anyone know how to get the first mission to load on an RGH console. I get to the part where you select the weapons and when I tell it to start game. The screen just goes black and stays black. I use XEXMenu to load the games.
,_whoa_,2012-11-07T18:06Z,Is there any chance of uploading the actual rar files rather than the .dvd and .iso files?
,rajtalreja,2012-11-07T20:54Z,"hey I am going to buy another xbox360.
I would like to know wether i should make it jTag or LT3.0? what do you recommend, I dont play online and I never will.

Whats diff between jTag abd LT ?

I am buying new one because my current xbox is not loading it gets stuck on xbox logo and if i get hard drive out it shows nothing only black screen. so I am not sure what is wrong with it. anyone have any idea?"
,racedude62,2012-11-09T10:24Z,can someone send me the .dvd file - i dont have it
,racedude62,2012-11-09T10:30Z,I downloaded a different version without a .dvd file and i really wanna play this game
,softkille05,2012-11-09T14:10Z,"i dont know how to burn the game, can someone help ?"
,chrome50ae,2012-11-09T14:37Z,u just need dashlaunch 3.04 if you got RGH or JTAG
,soundscape,2012-11-11T17:53Z,"I have a fat 360 that you flashed LT+ 3.0 in order to play my backups.  Since probably last Febuary it hasn't been able to play any XDG3 backups at all.  This includes older discs that had the topology data removed as well as newer ones that were burned with iextreme burner max.  The newer ones that were burned with iextreme burner max and validated with abgx360 always work fine in my black slim xbox.  The difference between the two consoles is that the white fat was banned and no longer connected to the internet whereas the slim is unbanned and everything works fine.  Both consoles have the latest dashboard as well.
So I'm wondering if I need to get the fat one reflashed with LT+ 3.0 or if maybe the issue is with the laser?  This game isn't working either ""unsupported disc""   Any ideas?"
