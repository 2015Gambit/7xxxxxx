100% No Modern Talking is the first EP by the Australian electro house duo Knife Party. It was released December 12, 2011 as a free download on their website, Facebook and Soundcloud as well as being available for purchase on Beatport and iTunes. The EP originally was to feature 'Back to the Z-List' but was replaced with 'Destroy Them With Lazers' as Knife Party no longer liked that track. The album titles refers to a preset in the software synthesiser 'Native Instruments: Massive', which creates the 'talking' sound featured in latest dubstep tracks.
