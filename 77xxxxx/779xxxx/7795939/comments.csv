,shawnygats,2012-11-14T21:40Z,"Guys, if u wanna play the game:
1 – Download & Install FM2013 Demo from steam or wherever.
 2 – Download & Install FM 13 complete version (can be from this site)
 3 – Open FM 13 (full version)
 4 – Start a new game
 5 – On screen where you are adding new manager save the game. Don't add the manager, just save it.
 6 – Go to : “Documents/Sports Interactive/Football Manager 2013/games/” and change the extension of your save from “.fm” to “.qfm”
 7 – Open FM 13 DEMO
 8 – New Career – Quick start (very impt. don't load the game yet.)
 9 – Find your save-file(“Documents/Sports Interactive/Football Manager 2013/games/***.qfm”
 10 – Open and play

It works, surprisingly. No crash dumps. Can finish the season. No problems. Just follow the instructions exactly. Only you cannot play the classics, or online game or add new leagues. the leagues that you originally saved with will be the ones that you can play. Maybe this will enough while you wait for the updated crack, have fun."

P.S if you(readers;) agree with this post copy it to all forums related about fm so that people from scene can read it."
,dolphin9,2012-11-21T18:44Z,Apparently the 13.1.3 update was released today which fixes a lot of the crashes in the game. Perhaps soon skidrow will release an update crack.

""you guys are last stand and defence from imperialist Empires, you keep fighting for freedom""

Mind the difference between 'freedom' and 'piracy', bro, for what we're doing here, on TPB, is nothing more than piracy, and it's a fact.
Downloading a cracked copy of FM has nothing to do with 'fighting for freedom', neither does cracking the game as such.

As for SEGA, it's a quite simple thing. You make the game, you sell it for any price you want. In worst case less people will actually buy the game, ergo you'll earn less money. There's nothing imperialistic in it. 
Moreover, I see no connection between what SKIDROW is doing and, as you said, 'imperialistic Empires'.
No offense, I'm saying it with all the respect for them of course.

Get real, dude. We're all nothing but pirates here, not freedom fighters.

On the other hand though, I agree with you, that it would be nice to hear something about the crack from SKIDROW, 'cause I myself am waiting for it since November 3rd. ;)"

I am original author of post above and here is my answer :
Let me explain you why i said imperialist Empires , when artist make some art they put it in gallery and make money from visitors tickets or the people that bought the art , but their main goal is that his art work is seen by large amount of people via internet magazines or anyway possible, when musician makes a song he is selling his album but he likes that his music is heard all over the world no matter if people have bought his album , when a writer writes a book he hopes to sale many copies of it , but he also wants that his book goes to as much hands as its possible.
On the other hand when  gamemakers (in this case SEGA) make a game their goal isnt a good product and pleasing people (but they must do that if they want to sell the game) their main goal is that you and only you can play the game (because you bought it and no one alse shuold have access to it) so gamemakers main goal is 100% maximum profit and nothing else ,i can name you bunch of examples when gamemakers had made a game that has flaws and it doesnt work as it should,  but they put it to sale not for sake of the game, because they now its flawed,  but in the name of profit and reaping people of their money , that is in my opinion imperialistic.
And dont get me started with FM which is ultimate example of IMPERIALISM because they did something that no other game making studio did (correct me if i am wrong) they paid top scene group SKIDROW not to crack FM. You should know that there is some truth about this because skidrowgames and some other skidrow related sites wont alow my previous post , just try copy paste my previous post on their site and they wont publish it .
P.S if you(readers;) agree with this post copy it to all forums related to fm  or related to any other forums you think fit description . "
,LennoxTo,2012-11-25T16:44Z,I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE CRACK FIX IS COMING BUT I'AM SURE THAT WE WILL PLAY THIS GAME AT LEAST AFTER 15 OF DECEMBER 2012
,dieFK,2012-11-27T18:01Z,"@NOCNI1st

You completely mistake the meaning of ""imperialism"". It is not a will to earn as much as possible without paying attention to what you actually sell to people - imperialism applies to nations and/or countries only.
[For a more or less appropriate definition look here: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/imperialism]

Concerning SEGA, what they do, is no imperialism, it's just plain business.
They have all the right to disagree with your alike definition of creating stuff for people, and they have the right to protect their intellectual property at all cost, even though I don't like the fact that they're succeeding either.

Therefore, no offense to ya, I don't believe you have the right to offend them, because it's their choice what they do with their game. They could even not publish it at all, if there was any point in it.

The closest thing you could call ""imperialism"" are the platforms like Steam. For using Steam you're not only buying the game, practically, in one place only (any shop, any internet store - there's always a STEAM KEY), but you also can't play WITHOUT Steam, which leaves you with no choice but to use it.
Still, a more suitable word would be ""monopolism"".

Lastly, what concerns SEGA paying SKIDROW not to crack FM'13... that smells like a conspiracy theory to me. Won't believe until I see proof, other than refusals to post your comment on their sites, because that doesn't really convince me.
Once again, no offense.

Regards, bro."
,KilroyDK,2012-11-27T19:10Z,"Just for the record: the page skidrowteam.com does NOT have ANYTHING to do with the famous ""Skidrow - .the leading force."". - They are just a bunch of inbreeds who uploads skidrow games found through communities and other sites. - They simply just know where to look.
- They are not even ""the prefered site of Skidrow"" .. as I have been informed from their own admins. - Skidrow does NOT upload to that URL.

- And for ""TurkishToonFan01"" - he is NOT a part of the cracking team of SKIDROW in ANYWAY!. Truth is that he is a 19 yo Turkish boy - living in London, and working as a sales person in a clothing store ! (that is the REAL truth :D)

.. Just a pathetic little kid who tried to get glory on others achievements.

Fact is that NO ONE knows if SKIDROW have given up on the crack.. TurkishToonFan01 just started getting frustrated that more and more people were starting to realize that he has NO association with SKIDROW.

Another fact is that SKIDROW does NOT have a homepage, email or any other from of public way of communication. - So NO comments will EVER come from SKIDROW themselves.. their work speaks for themselves..

Just felt I needed to shed a little light on the bastards who glorify themselves in SKIDROW's good name."
