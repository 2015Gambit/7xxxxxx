After a health scare, Brighton-based Lou is forced to confront the fact that her time to have a baby is running out. She canΓÇÖt imagine a future without children, but her partner doesnΓÇÖt seem to feel the same way, and sheΓÇÖs not sure whether she could go it alone. Meanwhile, up in Yorkshire, Cath is longing to start a family with her husband, Rich. No one would be happier to have a child than Rich, but Cath is infertile. Could these strangers help one another out? Combining Sarah RaynerΓÇÖs deft exploration of raw emotions with the joy and resilience of friendship, The Two Week Wait is a memorable, moving page-turner about two very different women, each yearning to create a family of her own.
