[V],thenoobish,2012-11-06T11:29Z,Nice man! Do you have any other new games? Thanks for this game!
,fisiologhik,2012-11-06T16:23Z,Thanks bro. Can u upload Okami HD?
,nova12,2012-11-09T12:12Z,Thanks
,BerserkLeon,2012-11-13T23:26Z,Thanks. Wouldn't have been able to get it otherwise. Most of the uploaded copies have a missing part.. or they get me a CRC fail.
