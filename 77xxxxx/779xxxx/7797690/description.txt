This is Zone of the Enders HD for PS3, as downloaded from ps3iso.com, uploaded by Vimto.

This also contains the Metal Gear Rising Demo

This is confirmed working on CFW 4.30 Rogero

Side Note: I haven't seen an option to play Z.O.E. on disk start up. As far as I can tell, I can only play the Rising Demo. I could be wrong, I have not yet checked in depth to start up Z.O.E.

First Proper Torrent Upload
Enjoy!
