Ummm.... Can you please calm down? I did say what version it is.... It is version 6, which CAN also be known as 6.0.0.0. This is the latest version. If you still dont get it, search it up on google. :/"

,helldemonfiend,2012-11-10T03:50Z,Well thats great!  Thanks for the clarification.  6.0.8.170 has been available on the site for a month.  Thanks anyway
