,KingFisheR222,2012-11-04T08:07Z,"Jeez, guys, you can't possibly imagine how i loath this guy. He's not a comedian. "
,Exodus666,2012-11-04T10:40Z,"Well Kingfisher, that makes u a fucking moron.

Louis CK is the best current stand up comedian in the world, and if u don't like him, the ONLY option must be that you where raped as a child. "
,KingFisheR222,2012-11-04T14:08Z,"Exodus666, you're and idiot, and now everybody knows it. Look how many mistakes have you done having written the only sentence of yours. And what can i say to an idiot? Not really that much. Watch more  Loui, you'll get even more idiotic. "
,i_like_torrents,2012-11-04T18:44Z,"@KingFisheR222 Nobody cares if you don't like Louie, the people downloading the torrent obviously do"
,KingFisheR222,2012-11-04T20:09Z,"@i_like_torrents, where on earth did you see that i'd said to people not to watch it? I didn't. Anybody can watch anything one would like to. Do it if you care.
I for one have watched this episode too. The first one in many-many years. And Louis.C.K. is still the same as he'd been the last time i'd watched him out: lame, boring and offensive.
Name me one joke of his from this very  particular episode you'd consider as being funny? The one about the old lady's panties made in the20's he had occasionally seen in the airport, huh ? Haha. Very funny.
For me any joke could be considered as such and only when and if it doesnt offends  - or has not anything to do with - people' personal life, disabilities, sexuality,  skin colors, or orientation. How many of such does Louis C. K  has on him? Pretty much none. I don't care about his Emmys. I don't care if there's no better person in the whole world to give them to anybody but him. I don't care if people watch him for crying out loud and have fun. Once again, what i do care about is that that i don't."
