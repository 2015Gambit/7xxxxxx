Notes:
I used the FLAC fileset for the audio because it just sounds better than what I was getting off the VHS.  
The audio's lineage is a little suspect, I believe it not to be off DAT as labeled but rather a LaserDisc rip. 
Either way it is superior to anything that would come off my tape.
Ideally one day a LaserDisc rip will surface or this will be once again officially released.
