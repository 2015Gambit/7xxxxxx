Three years after the birth of the buddha-bar Nature concept,
Allain Bougrain Dubourg and the George V Records team form an
alliance, for our listening pleasure.
More specialized, more worked, but still magic and dreamy;
buddha-bar Ocean takes you in an aquatic travel around
the world; from the unique marine depths of Brittany┬Æs
coasts to the impressive breaking Australian waves.
On the video side, more than 500 hours of footage were
edited to keep only the best: 12 video clips
(of approximately 3minutes 30) from the of
Nature Productions team.
On the music side, different artists from the four
corners of the world have collaborated to form a bunch
of thousand aromas: Amanaska (Australia) signs 6 titles
more appealing one than the other. Daniel Masson also
worked hard to make two new gems.
This prestigious alliance offers us a wonderful DVD,
with incredible images ringing the alarm to save our planet.
Let us react and act!
