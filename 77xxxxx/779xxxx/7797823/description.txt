The Black Well (2012) (Digital GN)
Publication Date:  2012

by Jamie Tanner

A dog-faced man, a disappearing woman, a headless vampire, a mysterious clinic on a remote island, offering treatment for "unusual ailments"...

The Black Well is a kind of horror / comedy / mystery hybrid in comics form. But the mystery has no real solution, it's not necessarily "scary", and there aren't really any jokes. It's a strange variation on some classic horror themes and archetypes, like werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. But in a, let's just say, idiosyncratic way.
