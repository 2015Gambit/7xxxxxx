Germany's Helloween are undeniably one of the most influential heavy metal bands to emerge from Europe during the 1980s. By taking the harmonies and structure of classic bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest and infusing them with the urgency and energy of the growing thrash metal movement, Helloween created something unique and truly embody the essence of 'power metal'. The band remains a strong force today, as proven on this new double DVD, Keeper Of The Seven Keys: The Legacy World Tour 2005-2006 Live on 3 Continents. Captured live in Sao Paulo, March 25th, 2006, along with alternate takes from Sofia and Tokyo shows from the same tour, this release is a must for any fan of fantastic Heavy Metal.
