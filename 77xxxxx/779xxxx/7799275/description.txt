Dear Diary,

I had to go down to the hotel lobby this morning to check my mail and there was a girl there texting; probably a girl who had just finished with a customer or something like that. She had red-colored hair and a nice face, but she walked away too fast so I filmed her in secret from a distance. I stayed here in my hotel room most of the day. I was feeling a little ill, maybe homesick? Haha, IΓÇÖm joking!

Later this evening, I took my bike and went to a 7/11 to buy some food and drinks. There were two cute girls in the store. One was very cute, and very much my type of girl. So I made a move and told them to put their things in my basket; always a winner with Filipinas. So of course they did.

My favoriteΓÇÖs name was Ella. Then I proposed to give them a lift. They wanted to be dropped at some kind of Petron station. My second move: pretend not to be interested any more. So I left them after giving my phone number and asking Ella about a photo-shoot for tomorrow. She said yes! She texted me like 15 minutes later already, now saying that it will be the day after tomorrow, so weΓÇÖll see!
