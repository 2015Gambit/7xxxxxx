I understand if you can't as I said not usually one to ask for other stuff, but figured I'd try 

thanks"

,AlyH,2012-11-08T01:09Z,"so the Iron Chef I was talking about was the US one as is ""The Next Iron Chef""

I didn't realize this was a UK version of the show, should have forgot it was there first - even as an American I watch the Aussie ones, but this will be good

thanks again for the upload"
