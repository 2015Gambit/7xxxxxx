Please consider uploading any horror titles you consider worth a read; especially those that may not have been discovered by others.

I've only recently become reacquainted with comics, after stumbling upon my old longboxes.  I collected pretty heavily as a kid, from ~1985-1990 (long runs of Daredevil, including #2, and all the Frank Miller issues; first prints of the Dark Knight Returns issues , The Killing Joke and Year One just to name a few).  All appear as I left them, bagged, boarded and redolent with nostalgia.

Anyway, since I've begun reading comics again (not collecting yet), the resurgence of horror has really captivated me.  Although the bulk of the genre (as with any) is largely unengaging, a number of series have really a joy.

So thanks again for providing so much great stuff.

BTW, I assume you've read Scott Snyder's series, Severed (Image/2011-12).  IMO, his narratives are definitely among the industry's finest."

Honestly, I don't really ""collect"" horror. I do have a good amount of it mixed in with all my other stuff (which is like, a lot of books). I tried to focus on it around Halloween, so I pulled together a nice ""pile"" of horror themed books to upload. But for the most part, I'm constantly buying, reading, scanning, downloading, sorting, restoring and uploading, so I don't really focus too much on any one particular genre or style. Obviously, I dig creator owned and independent, small press properties, but I don't focus on those all the time, either (as my uploads show).

I'm digressing a bit, but what I'm trying to get across is that I'll always upload some horror now and again, but it will never be a constant. 

The Killing Joke is the Batman book that got me interested in the Caped Crusader. To this day Batman is still the only superhero I've ever collected. 

Severed and Scott Snyder are great. Snyder has done a lot of great Batman work.

Thanks again. And keep an eye out for the horror uploads. "
