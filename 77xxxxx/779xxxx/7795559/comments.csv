I wasn't aware that this version wouldn't do Exchange 2007/2010 - it does support Exchange 2003 which is the environment I was recovering from.  

In the near future I intend on buying a license, and based on the community of people I poured over in thousands of forums a licensed copy on torrent would help many.

What kind of message did you get when you tried to mount 2007/2010?  I'll generate one myself next week and see where I can get with this version.
