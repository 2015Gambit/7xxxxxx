Why did I make this torrent?  If you spent as much time as I did searching the net for a tool that will let
you extract data from an EDB file you will know why.  There are a lot of tools available to do it, but you will
NOT find one for free.  However, the torrent you see here took some work.  I combo'd this CYGNUS release which 
will cap you at 100 mailbox limit in using the software.  With the patch, you can break that limit and it is
now a Godsend.  The software extracts all mailboxes to MSG files - which is perfectly convenient for anything
from outlook 2003 import to 2010.  

I hope your data recovery goes well, and I will keep this torrent seeded for many years.  This .rar does not have a password, and there are no viruses of any kind in this torrent.
