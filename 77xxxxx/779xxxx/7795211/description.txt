Summary: Having never left the United States, Sandra Chase (Hershey) bravely agrees to accompany a friend to Ecuador for a much needed vacation; but paradise quickly turns to misery when she is accosted at the airport in Quito and is unjustly imprisoned for drug trafficking. With no trial or any recourse, Sandra is sent to a womenΓÇÖs prison with subpar living conditions and is terrorized by the other inmates. Meanwhile, SandraΓÇÖs daughter Tammi (Cook) is vigilantly working on getting her mother released from prison with limited knowledge of the laws and legal processes of Ecuador. Unwavering in her belief of her motherΓÇÖs innocence, Tammi is forced to drain her life savings while fighting with embassies and governments as she races against time to save her mother. In TammiΓÇÖs determined fight for justice, she recruits a U.S. Congresswoman, Rep. Corinne Brown, and together they prevail in securing Sandra ChaseΓÇÖs release.
