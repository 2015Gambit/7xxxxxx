In 1997, DC Comics launched a new Justice League series entitled JLA, written by Grant Morrison, with art by Howard Porter, and inker John Dell.

This series, in an attempt at a back-to-basics approach, used as its core the original seven members (or their successors):  Superman; Batman; Wonder Woman; Aquaman; Flash (Wally West;) Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner; ) and the Martian Manhunter.  Additionally, the team received a new headquarters, The Watchtower, which was based on the Moon.  JLA quickly became the best-selling title at DC, a position it enjoyed off and on for several years. 

Morrison introduced the idea of the JLA allegorically representing a pantheon of gods (with their different powers and personalities) incorporating such characters as:  Zauriel; Big Barda; Orion; Huntress; Barbara Gordon (Oracle;) Steel (John Henry Irons;) and Plastic Man.  He also had as temporaries:  Aztek; Tomorrow Woman; and Green Arrow (Connor Hawke.)

Under Morrison, the series pitted The League against a variety of enemies.  These included White Martians, renegade angels, a new incarnation of the Injustice Gang led by Lex Luthor, and The Key.  Other foes were the new villain Prometheus; the existing JLA villain Starro, The Conqueror; The Ultra-Marines; and a futuristic Darkseid.  Morrison departed after issue 41, in an arc titled World War III, which involves The New Gods preparing the Earth for battle against a creature known as Maggedon, a super-sentient weapon of mass destruction.

This torrent, created to honor a most excellent request, contains ALL Grant Morrison issues of JLA Volume 3.

Enjoy, and please seed.
