Diabolic

The aftermath of the Dorans' Halloween party
leaves everyone with an emotional and
psychological hangover. Jane, traumatized by
the terror she experienced, is even more
devastated by the lack of support not only from
the detectives investigating the case, but from
Henry, leading to repercussions in their
relationship. Meanwhile, Dr. Evans, who suffers
from a gambling addiction, becomes beholden to
Gavin in order to pay off a large debt.
Finally, Gavin tracks down the person
responsible for endangering Olivia and stealing
his property, and is determined to end the
trouble or risk losing The Drake and everything
he owns. And in one horrifying moment, Jane
pieces together how is she is connected to the
history of the building
