,trigah,2012-11-06T03:55Z,"hey Memorypsp,
Why is it that i cannot download this thing? it stops until 428mb only. it won't resume since then. kindly check on it? thanks."
,MemoryPSP,2012-11-06T12:01Z,@KFpcGAMER  Sorry sir to hear that but OFW games no longer work on the current 6.60 firmware. They only worked in the 6.39 firmware. Games had to be removed since users were being provided content for the 6.60 firmware. And a lot of users have 6.60 . You can play any games if you have 6.60 PRO-C  update. You can find the update right here on this pirate bay page of MemoryPSP. Its very easy to install and you'll have a hacked psp. Instructions are given in the file. Please try that out so you can play your iso games. And its safe to do on any psp
,MemoryPSP,2012-11-06T12:05Z,@trigah Lately every new game added is seeded. I apologize if your download is going too slow. Try seeding too and maybe your download will go faster
