,DarkKlown77,2012-11-09T17:21Z,"So Avira is giving me a virus hit on this file. It is called TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen

Anyone wanna comment on this for me, not looking for a virus."
,DarkKlown77,2012-11-09T17:27Z,"Alright my previous comment about Avira giving me a hit about a virus got deleted I guess, can anyone tell me if they've gotten any hits from a virus scan please?!"
,DarkKlown77,2012-11-09T17:29Z,"It is TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen2 to be specific, here's a link to what Avira has to say: http://www.avira.com/en/support-threats-description/tid/4691/tlang/en"
,solutioN-Ghost,2012-11-10T05:03Z,"@DarkKlown77

It's a false positive dude. Anti-virus-es like NOD32, Avast and any other anti-virus that already existed when you bought your computer/laptop sucks so bad, fact #1. Just add the file in your Exceptions tab"

,hmir,2012-11-17T09:02Z,"After installing the game, adding outbound firewall block rules, and copying the crack files over into the game directory, I start the game, it shows me the title screen, than the language selection screen, and when I press enter, the program crashes and creates the following dump file in the game directory.

FIFACrashDump_CL1193581_2012.11.17_07.59.31.dmp

Anyone else have this problem? Solutions? Don't think this torrent is quite right. I guess we need to wait for a 2.0 release."
