FIFA 13 captures all the drama and unpredictability of real-world soccer,
and is driven by five game-changing innovations which revolutionize
artificial intelligence, dribbling, ball control and physical play. It is
the largest and deepest feature set in the history of the franchise. These
innovations create a true battle for possession across the entire pitch,
deliver freedom and creativity in attack, and capture all the drama and
unpredictability of the real-world game.

FEATURES:
Attacking Intelligence - Players have the ability to analyse space, work
harder and smarter to break down the defense, and think two plays ahead.
Plus, players make runs that pull defenders out of position and open passing
channels for teammates.

Complete Dribbling - Face your opponent and use precise dribble touches
combined with true 360-degree mobility with the ball. Be more creative and
dangerous in 1v1 opportunities.

1st Touch Control - A new system transforms the way players control the
ball, eliminating near-perfect touch for every player, and creating more
opportunities for defenders to capitalise on errant balls and poor touches
to win back possession.
