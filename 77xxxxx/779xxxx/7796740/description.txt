JRR Tolkien: The True Lord of the Rings gives readers a brief, 28-page glimpse into his life. The writers, Brian McCarthy and Michael Lent, manage to cover the major points in TolkienΓÇÖs life story. The comic book is a quick read, but the narrative never feels rushed. ItΓÇÖs like skimming a beautifully illustrated version of TolkienΓÇÖs Wikipedia page.
