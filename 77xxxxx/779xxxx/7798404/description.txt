Consumers demand quality milk with a reasonable shelf-life, a requirement that can be met by the milk industry through use of improved processes and technologies. Guaranteeing the production of safe milk also remains of paramount importance. Improving the Safety and Quality of Milk provides a comprehensive and timely reference to best practices and research advances in these areas. Volume 1 focuses on milk production and processing. Volume 2 covers the sensory and nutritional quality of cow's milk and addresses quality improvement of a range of other milk-based products.

The health aspects of milk, its role in the diet and milk-based functional foods are the focus of the opening section of Volume 2. Part two reviews essential aspects of milk quality, including milk microbial spoilage and chemical deterioration, sensory evaluation, factors affecting milk vitamin and mineral content and the impact of packaging on quality. Chapters in Part three look at improving particular products, such as organic milk, goat milk, and sheep milk. The impact of milk on the quality of yoghurt and cheese is also covered.
