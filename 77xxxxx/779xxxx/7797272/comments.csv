,crcfail,2012-11-07T03:20Z,"why is this fucking rar'd, retard uploader"
,beno,2012-11-11T13:28Z,If you have any interest and knowledge whatsoever about Devgru (Seal Team 6) this movie is clusterfuck! It is so bad I can't believe I wasted time watching this shit!!! They could at least spent one day researching anything about Devgru and the raid! Everything is so inaccurate! From the gear they use to tactics and even the raid is just unbelivably bad. The only thing that amazingly made it in there is the pointman calling Kahlids name to get him to look out. Aaaaaahhhhh! So fucking horrible!!!
,tehhell1,2012-11-19T23:05Z,"crcfail, its in case a chunk of the movie is bad you can re download that part of the movie instead of the entire rar file. its an old way labelling volumes. do some research before being an idiot to the uploader. "
