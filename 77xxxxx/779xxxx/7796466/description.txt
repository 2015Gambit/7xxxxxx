Marina (Dihovichnaya) is a gorgeous upper-crust Muscovite with an opulent wardrobe and good-looking husband to match. SheΓÇÖs employed as a social worker, a profession offering meager financial rewards. Thankfully her affluent father provides the supplementary income her job ΓÇö and her hapless husband ΓÇö cannot. Yet instead of finding contentment in her win-win situa┬¡tion, Marina carries on an affair with her best friendΓÇÖs husband, and also initiates a bizarre series of erotic encounters with a deadbeat cop who previously raped her.

Sharing writing credits with leading lady and co-producer Olga Dihovichnaya, rookie director Angelina Nikonova delivers a movie stripped of whatever ostentatious displays of sensitivity you might expect from its unsavoury premise. What you get with Twilight Portrait is chilling subject matter handled with a cool sobriety that none of NikonovaΓÇÖs dazed characters seem to share.
