Summary: Based on a true story, Fatal Honeymoon tells the shocking story and controversy surrounding a newlywed who tragically dies on her dream honeymoon and the subsequent investigation as to whether or not her husband was guilty of killing her. In the film, Alabama couple Gabe Watson and his new bride, 26 year-old Tina Watson, married just 11 days, go on their dream honeymoon to scuba dive near Australia's Great Barrier Reef, where Tina drowns in what appears to be a freak accident. With authorities puzzled over Gabe's inconsistent statements about Tina's death, her father Tommy Thomas begins to suspect Gabe may have murdered his daughter. When an underwater photo of Tina lying motionless on the ocean floor emerges, Australian authorities begin to suspect foul play, charge Gabe with his wife's death and extradite him to their country, where he eventually pleads guilty to manslaughter and serves 18 months in prison...
