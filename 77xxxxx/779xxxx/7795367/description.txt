Hotspot Shield creates a virtual private network (VPN) between your laptop and the wireless router. This impenetrable tunnel prevents snoopers and hackers from viewing your email, instant messages, credit card information or anything else you send over a wireless network. Which means you remain anonymous and protect your privacy. Sure, public Wi-Fi hotspots are great. After all, what would life be without checking your email each morning at your favorite café? But while you’re enjoying your latte and a bagel, some hacker might be accessing your passwords, credit card numbers, sensitive company data and much more. And standard antivirus software won’t protect you. That’s why AnchorFree is pleased to offer Hotspot Shield. This free security software keeps your Internet connection secure at public hotspots, home or work. Hotspot Shield security software is free to download, employs the latest VPN technology, and is easy to install and use.
