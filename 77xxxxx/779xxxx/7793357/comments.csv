Please don't keep us again. Don't mean to sound disrespectful of the work that you put in but the chinese say that when you save somebody's life you are actually responsible for him. thank you for saving our sunday night life and please, please keep it going.thanks"

How would you cope with a capper that just stops for no apparent reason right in the middle of a series, not once, not twice but many times per month?  The Xtra Factor UK stopped at Episode 2 and many many other series stop right in the middle so be thankful for at least getting ALL the episodes here!

Thanks Verovenlo - your work is appreciated and if we have to wait until Wednesday, so be it."

I may have a sarcastic tone nut I really appreciate all your hard effort. My sense of humour is a bit strange.Thank you very much and keep up the good work :)"
