Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, November 5 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the election in the wake of Katrina 2.0, Hurricane Sandy. 

On the day before the election, Obama supporters and leftwing media figures are stoking violent rhetoric while bookies back Obama to beat Romney despite poll results showing a dead heat race. 

Alex also talks about the all-too predictable response by FEMA and the federal government to Sandy as millions of people on the East Coast continue to suffer in the wake of the epic storm. 

Guest Bev Harris of Black Box Voting will break down vote fraud during this year's contest.
