,kiwij,2012-11-05T12:55Z,Thank you :D I wish there was a way to tell immediately if there was a 1080p version coming out as well.
,fluffus,2012-11-06T00:42Z,Me too. Also any chance when you upload 1080p you could make it DD5.1? The AAC2.0 is mediocre and isn't really a great match with the excellent video quality.
,ioulianos,2012-11-08T14:19Z,Still no 1080p version?
,zallow,2012-11-09T23:30Z,1080p is impossible until it gets out on bluray. AMC-HD broadcasts in 1080i. Good luck finding 1080i releases of tv shows though. Maybe on private torrent sites.
