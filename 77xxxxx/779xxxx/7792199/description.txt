The Great Zapruder Film Hoax:
The assassination of John F. Kennedy has produced a wealth of dubious evidence and bizarre disappearances, from faked photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald to the missing brain of the president. Until now, Abraham ZapruderΓÇÖs 27-second home movie capturing the murder of JFK has been considered sacrosanct. This book, bringing together all the leading authorities in the assassination research community, challenges that notion. These experts examined the film from every imaginable perspective, including the technical processes of video production, the laws of physics, contradictions by eyewitnesses, and medical evidence. Their conclusion is chilling but thoroughly documented: that the Zapruder film has been doctored, pointing to a meticulously planned, high-tech falsification of evidence of this momentous, still unsolved, event. Published to coincide with the 40th anniversary of Kennedy's death, contributors include David W. Mantick, the foremost expert on JFK assassination medical evidence, and David Healy, an authority on film processing. Black-and-white photographs are included.
