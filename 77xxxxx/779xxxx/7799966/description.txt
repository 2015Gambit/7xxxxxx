Warning:
This is not a perfect copy
I'm only uploading it because it is special episode and so far I haven't seen it online.
I thought the scene would upload a version.
Maybe they had trouble with their cable like I did.

There is a bit missing during the opening commercial and intro music.
There is also a glitch at 1:03 and 33:54
You miss very little of the main show and it is still very watchable.
