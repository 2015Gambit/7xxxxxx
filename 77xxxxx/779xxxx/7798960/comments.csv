,vcdman17,2012-11-07T02:57Z,"kinives555, I also have trouble streaming most of his stuff, but I convert it all to another format and edit the titles of each episode. It takes some time, but it's worth it. Daman, you're the best source for good quality anime on here!"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-11-07T03:34Z,"Animelife, just drop it. What matters is that you know you're right. If you care so much about what others online think about you, maybe it's you you're trying to convince? 

But let's just enjoy the Anime here, mooserocka is likely just trolling you anyway."
,mooserocka,2012-11-07T03:51Z,anime life are you joking with me. You said shit about my dead mother what am i suposed to say o hes a great guy no im going to say stuff too you end of story. you did this unprovoked. 
,mooserocka,2012-11-07T04:05Z,anime life you have wrote in like 8 differnt dvds now its hard to keep track of what your saying but i have NO IDEA how everyone thinks your right either. I  was talked shit on by u UNPROVOKED!!!!!! OVER AND OVER it did not stop at first i said stop talking to me leave me alone it did not stop then i say fu u lil piss ant and im the bad guy?!?!?! Whatever dude all i want to do is compliment how great daman is and the service he is doing ALL of us. I could care less what you say but when u talked shit on my mom it crossed a line. 
,Crimson-tear,2012-11-07T07:12Z,Thanks ^^
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-07T12:51Z,get me some evidence that i said bad stuff of your dead mother i didn't say anything dude gosh 
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-07T13:14Z,@ vcdman17 and @ knives 555 i had trouble streaming on my tv but i got the idea connect your laptop to a projector
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-07T13:20Z,well mooserocka please look the first three comments which i have post on daman's torrents it says that your the one who started the dead mom business dude 
,mooserocka,2012-11-08T05:13Z,Anime life is something wrong with you man? What did you go back and delete what you said lol. O well its fine i know what you said and it was so inmature . It was something about having sex with her and pig faces which was so out of the blue. I once again NEVER mentioned your name or ANYTHING you just started talkin crap all crazy without BEING PROVOKED!!!!
,mooserocka,2012-11-08T05:33Z,"O wait you didnt delete it you said prove to you well here THIS IS WHAT STARTED EVERYHINg you wrote this without me EVER SAYING ANYTHING to you ANIMELIFE at 2012-11-01 01:31 CET: 

@mooserocka speak for your self (idiot)
 and i bet your face is like a pig and your moms face is like the queen of faggots"
,CCONTROL,2012-11-08T06:32Z,"well you started it here at 2012-10-26 you said this to me

anime life you can just shut up with all the fucking comments you bitch well daman im impressed with all your work and anime life is a shit"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-08T06:45Z,"well @mooserocka at 2012-10-26 you specificly said this to me
animelife your such a bitch and a faggot so shut  up and dont talk to me pig face life

so yeah that starting of the mom business  
and you started more of the fights"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-08T06:58Z,"and again@ mooserocka im a one person standing and your saying im making new name and accounts what a bad info you got there dude you suck it has  

the mother thing has nothing to do with sexs by the way
and my follower from bakabt are the ones who are supporting me dumbass

+ i'm the one who created their name and there are 45 diffrent people you are suppoting me in 23 states"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-08T07:16Z,"@ mooserocka what now your saying im the  one who stated the   
 fight from the start ok whatever i started the mom business but doesn't mean i started the fights before the mom business so you lose"
,mooserocka,2012-11-08T08:01Z,c control that was MADE UP i never wrote that nor would i lol. and anime life which one is it you said you didnt start the mom business then you ask for proof now your retracting. This is not about winning or loosing just own up to talking shit non stop. I caught you using other names to try and prove a point you asked for proof and i gave it. The proof you and c control provided was made up and did not have a name next to it. you totaly fabricated that. You can go back and look NONE OF that was EVER said. Our fights go from the deadman wonderland dvd on up. WEll you talked crap on some other guy vlc something also. He didnt defend himself i guess hes smarter then i am. Look all im askin is you and your made up names leave me alone. What a clown and of story.  
,Lost_Leaf,2012-11-08T11:24Z,"Ok, the problem lies in the fact that neither of you have a basic grasp of the English language, so you're constantly misinterpreting each other.

Mooserocka, AnimeLife is trying to tell you that he admits to the offenses he directed at your mother, but claims that it was merely a response carried out from you insulting him inexplicably beforehand. He doesn't understand why you insulted him, as he had not insulted your mother at this moment in time.

Now --both of you-- please stop fighting on here. It's troublesome for me to have to sift through your spam. "
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-08T11:33Z,@mooserocka so what you only found out my new made fake accounts but 1 thing you never found out my bakabt supporters dude
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-08T11:38Z,"@ mooserocka you still don't have proof for the first fight we had it's just because your afraid to lose ain't that right .

you might just take your own medicine 

and for the mom business i started it but you started the whole fight"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-08T11:42Z,@ mooserocka our fight lies further  back then but the mom business was at deadman wonderland 
,omgtpb,2012-11-08T14:33Z,"Daman, what's the source for this? Did Funimation release 5-8 in 720p somewhere, or is this fancy editing?"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-08T18:49Z,"@mooserocka just as im requesting and questioning from daman how bout you requesting this many at
at 2012-10-22 00:21 CET

DAman hey sorry for posting so much but once again your awesome. Im just going to list a bunch of requests and i hope u can make them happen if you cant its all good. Majikoi: Oh! Samurai Girl / UN GO please i REALLy want ungo/ horizon in the middle of nowhere/ okami san and her seven companions/ Fafner they re did it even though its old/ One peice anything new/ Tales of Vesperia/ legend of heros complete collection/ baka and test season 2/ level e / blood c thank you. Sorry i listed so many buy i hope you can upload all of these since your awesome. 


SO mooserocka do you like people saying bad stuff just for commenting"
,mooserocka,2012-11-08T19:47Z,Anime life what you just listed WAS NOT directed to you AT ALL all it says is my opinion on certian anime? what does that have to do with ANYTHINg. you asked for proof i provided it. No you are totaly wrong our fight STARTED at deadman wonderland it does not go BEFORE that because that is when i first found out about daman and started dling his stuff was at deadman wonderland. Look dude just get over it you started a fight with me all the proof points to it. I shouldnt have even responded to you imature stuff but when u said something about my mother i lost it. Anyway once again im asking to PLEASE stop hitting me up or directing stuff torward me. And stop making new names and having them say stuff also its VERY immature. Just STOP 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-08T23:05Z,SOURCE IS Blu ray as stated in the tittle
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-09T02:31Z,"@mooserocka well that't what i was pointing for i only requested 
an anime but your the one who started the fight i think its somewhere around yuyu-hakusho or something it to far to keep track lol  so yeah we fought around that part and i'm not making new name anymore so get more info before you want to proof me wrong

and yeah fyi i started the mom part happy ?
doensn't mean i started all of the fights


NOW THEN GET NEW INFORMATION THEN STOP TROLLING ME DUDE "
,mooserocka,2012-11-09T18:17Z,anime If you havent noticed After everything i write i say please leave me alone. SHut up stop talking to me please stop trying to act like the victim. You are not you started everything. And when i was saying something about naruto it wasnt torward you it was saying there is SO MANY naruto releases other then daman. I felt he shouldnt have wasted his time on something that will be released like 8 times by differnt people. Although its his time and for him to choose what he wants to do. So no i did not start anything with you. Please stop. you make yourself sound worse and worse. 
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-10T01:32Z,well mooserocka if we both say sorry then ill be fine and you and i can be like normal you go first
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-10T02:09Z,"well i'm not using any mores name not making any anymore dude you stop then i will. First about gurren laggan you said i was an idiot

SECOND i said 
hey mooserocka whats your problem


Third you said
Animelife can you shut up


so what was suppost to do.So i said 

thing bout you face and your mom

yeah i started the mom business but i did not start the first fight so admit 

done end of story we fought till hellsing ultimate
and now lets just don't fight beyond hellsing ultimate

i admit i started the mom business but i i didn't 
started the first fight so can we let fights turn to ""bygones be bygones"""
,mooserocka,2012-11-10T03:34Z,yea i kno i did say all that once again this was ALL after you REPEATEDLY berated me for a week. THE first time i said ANYTHING to you was when i called you a piss ant. And no im not going to appoligize i didnt do anything your a weirdo who has problems. Not my fault how about you just stop and stop clogging up the page and have respect for OTHER people. 
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-10T18:13Z,"@ mooserocka you say i don't respect to people .Hey i had most respect for you and everyone in this website but you made me mad and i did what i had to do FIGHT BACK .
SO okay your not apologizing is fine to me well as long as we don't make fights anymore .
WELL ANYWAY MORE i wont make any sorry's too. So okay can we let bygones be bygones

IF we don't well be fighting till the end of our lives

CAN WE BOTH ADMIT THAT BOTH OF OUR DOING ARE INAPPROPRIATE "
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-10T18:54Z,@mooserocka were both wrong and just let bigone's be bygone's because i have more important things to do
,mooserocka,2012-11-10T22:36Z,UMM thats what i been sayin leave me the hell alone END OF STORY
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-11T02:36Z,ive been saying that to you like at deadman wonderland so ok 
,indi711,2012-11-11T10:07Z,"Lost_Leaf really hit the nail on the head with this one. Really funny comment. I do enjoy reading some of the fights that happen on here but please keep them short and sweet. It gets boring when they're long...

Always nice downloads Daman. I don't give a shit how big the files are to be honest. You're the only good dubbed anime DLder I've found. Love the new stuff."
,mooserocka,2012-11-11T20:13Z,Indi i TOTALLY agree with you. You are so right. I dunno what to do other then ignore him so thats the next move maybe he will stop cause oviously begging and pleading with this idiot does not work. Im going to ignore him so lets hope that works. 
,deyruu,2012-11-16T01:28Z,"Okay, so I saw NOBODY actually bothered to say anything about A/V quality in these comments yet. 

I downloaded this torrent today, and for some reason the quality seems horrible. The picture is all blocky and there is roughly 2 inches of black space on the sides of the videos. WMP can't even play the files, I had to use MPC. 

Is anyone else experiencing this, or is it just me? 

Btw, I'm not saying Daman is a bad uploader. I don't know, as this is the first release from him that I've ever tried. I just want to know if it's a problem on my end, or within the torrent itself."
,deyruu,2012-11-16T01:42Z,"UPDATE: 

I just re-downloaded the first episode to test if maybe something went wrong downloading, and it's still the same.

@Daman4Iife, what could be the reason for this? I've been really looking forward to this english release for about 2 years, and I REALLY hope this is just something I'm doing wrong."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-16T02:54Z,Denryuu download the latest VLC.
,deyruu,2012-11-16T05:32Z,"Ah! The latest VLC works perfectly, thank you Daman! 

The quality is amazing! You are definitely my go-to source for anime from now on! Keep up the good work, and I'm sorry if I caused any inconvenience! 
^_^"
