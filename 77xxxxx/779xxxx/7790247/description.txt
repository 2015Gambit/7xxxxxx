Title: Origin of Symmetry (SPEC DTS 5.1 CD by DKA) (SBU)

This is a DTS 5.1 conversion created from a lossless FLAC source utilizing the SPEC method (ArcTan mode) as found on www.surroundbyus.com.

Only playable on home theater equipment and PC software capable of decoding a DTS signal. Otherwise, you will hear static.

Notes and disclaimers:

It is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.

If you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.

By request - I guess not many of you like the new Muse album, since I got a ton of "conversion great, album sucks" feedback on it. Well, let's go back to the early days, then. Separation is great. Maaaaybe I left the rears a bit high here? I don't seem to mind.

Track listing:

New Born
Bliss
Space Dementia
Hyper Music
Plug In Baby
Citizen Erased
Micro Cuts

Enjoy.
