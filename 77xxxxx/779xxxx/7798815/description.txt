 Have you ever walked into a room and couldn't remember what you went there for?

* Have you ever grasped the hand of a potential client and then when the handshake broke, the name seemed to disappear from your memory?

* Or have you ever left a prospect or an important meeting and as you drove away remembered a key point that you should have shared with them?

The problem is NOT with your memory. The problem is with the "Filing System" your brain currently uses to store and retrieve memory items. Change the filing system and you'll double and even triple your memory comprehension.

Two-time USA Memory Champion Ron White will teach you the same 2,000-year-old memory method that he has already taught thousands to:

* Routinely memorize 100 digit numbers after hearing them only onceΓÇª

* And lots more!
