,joegreg13,2012-11-06T10:43Z,watchable but the sound is weird. Either too low or dude was too far away from any speakers . 5 across the board
,joegreg13,2012-11-06T11:31Z,"After further review 

The little girl is the best part of the movie. You take her out you got yourself a G old school Disney movie for sure. Ok the main problems with the video is simple. The sound is really bad. I will go against what I said earlier about it. The guy had to be sitting next to speaker and light. You see a flashing light through out the whole movie. You had to increase and decrease the sound the whole time too. I turned it off after 45 mins because I thought I was going to have seizure watching it. The flashing light is really bad mixed with white clouds. It is watchable if you really really want to see it and can put up with all this stuff "

,Uxmen12,2012-11-28T14:41Z,Movie it's really great I enjoyed a lot but since quality of this torrent is really bad i went to searched for better version and found pretty nice one at lookatthis.jploh.com
