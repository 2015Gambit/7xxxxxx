The Ed Show; Sunday, November 5, 2012.

 Hours until election day, and Ed was out at Democracy Plaza for a special live edition of "The Ed Show"!

 Mitt Romney continued to campaign in Ohio, where President Obama still holds an almost 3 point lead. His running mate Paul Ryan tried for a Hail Mary in his home state of Wisconsin. Vice President Joe Biden also spoke to voters in Ohio, while President Obama and former President Bill Clinton rallied supporters in New Hampshire. Ben LaBolt (national press secretary for the Obama campaign), had an update from their headquarters in Chicago. Richard Wolffe (Vice President and Executive Editor of MSNBC.com), and Jonathan Alter (Bloomberg View) joined Ed for analysis.

Then, Florida Gov. Rick Scott tried to block the vote by refusing to extend early voting hours, but voters aren't giving up without a fight. Mitch Ceasar of the Broward County Democratic Party joined Ed with the latest on voting in the Sunshine State.

The Romney team continued to push its lie about Jeep jobs moving to China. Teamsters General President James Hoffa weighed in on one of Mitt Romney's biggest lies about the economy, and how it's playing in Ohio.

The Republican spin continues. Former Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour and Karl Rove think Hurricane Sandy gave President Obama an advantage in the polls. And Dick Morris predicts a landslide for Mitt Romney... or maybe not. Karen Finney ( MSNBC political analyst) and E.J. Dionne (the Washington Post) discussed the latest spin from the GOP talking heads.

And Monday is a final push for both candidates, and they're pulling out all the stops.  Howard Fineman of the Huffington Post joined Ed with an update from the campaign trail.
