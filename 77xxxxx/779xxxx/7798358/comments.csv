We noticed that you are using a pirate copy of Ace Translator.
 We have logged down the IP addresses and other solid proof.

Software theft is a serious crime. If you are caught with illegal software, you may be fined and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. In fact, you may be liable under both civil and criminal law. Software copyright violators in Brazil are fined up to R$ 200.000, or sentenced to jail for up to two years.

We hope you will take this matter seriously. You can acquire valid licenses now from the webpage below:

If you don't acquire a license within 7 days, we will turn over all evidence and documentation to a law enforcement agency for investigation.

Thank you for your immediate attention.

Best Regards,
