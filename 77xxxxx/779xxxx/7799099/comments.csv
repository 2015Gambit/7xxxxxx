Overview:

After the events in Deponia, Rufus came to his senses. He's grown prudent, amicable, kind and caring, without any intention to cause major mayhem just to further his own selfish ends. It seems he is far from chaining himself to flaming saw blades, training torpedo-dolphins or plundering platypus nests. Or is he? Eventually, it's a flaming saw blade that �persuades� Goal to stay on Deponia once more, splitting her personality into three parts in the process, each aspect of her consciousness stored to a different cartridge.So it's up to Rufus and his remarkable charm to persuade Goal's personalities to fuse into one again, make his way to Elysium with her and save Deponia from certain Chaos while he's at it. Join Rufus on his way through the vast area of the Floating Black Market, meet new, bizarre characters and reunite with familiar faces.

The second adventure on Deponia tells a unique, self contained story playable without further knowledge of the first installment. Challenging puzzles, elaborate dialogues and unique wacky humor ensure a truly hilarious gaming experience. Fans of the first game will discover new aspects of familiar characters' backgrounds and have many questions answered.
