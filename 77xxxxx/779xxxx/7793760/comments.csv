[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-05T06:28Z,"From now on, Every Anime that is 1-13 episodes will always have FLAC regardless of Resolution/Quality."
,vashterbation,2012-11-05T07:51Z,"@Daman IMO you should stick to smaller files, after all good quality for a reasonable file size & dual audio is what your notorious for.
The difference in FLAC audio is almost unnoticeable & 2 FLAC audio tracks bloats the hell out of this torrent.
BakaBT is where people go to get top quality anime (anyone who doesn't know what BakaBT is your going to want to google this)

As a last effort to persuade you, if you remember when you offered Darker than Black people were downloading another English only torrent rather than your own, and it was purely because it was of smaller size, I wish I could provide more examples to show you that smaller files are preferred but i cannot

People who want to keep the anime want smaller files, this is why I and many others love your torrents, so I hope you reconsider always using FLAC audio."
,Shidoki,2012-11-05T08:45Z,Hey could u please upload the 1st season of Heaven's lost property cause i can only find one thats 20gigs thx
,qingdy,2012-11-05T12:09Z,thanks
,cmryan821,2012-11-05T14:21Z,Thanks again Daman.
,mooserocka,2012-11-06T00:31Z,Honestly keep doing what your doing DAMAN. I dont care if thier 20 gigs cause when im done watching i can just delete when im out of space or put them into the cloud i have like 20 gigs of online space. Also the audio is just fine as long as the ENGLISH file is always file 1. I dont have ANY problems with what your doing just keep the anime flowing cause no one else is putting dubs out.
,mooserocka,2012-11-07T05:18Z,just read your post about un go in 48 hours cant wait. Thank you daman the service you do for us is amazing. I am in your debt thank you so much. 
,mooserocka,2012-11-07T05:24Z,for some reason the sound isnt in sync with the anime. I can still watch it its only like a second or 2 delay i dunno if its cause i loaded it to the ps3 or what and its only in epidode 1 so far but not a big promlem. Anyone else having this issue?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-07T05:58Z,Ps3 does not support 10bit video so that may be the issue.
,mooserocka,2012-11-08T05:23Z,It works with EVERYTHING else on my ps3. Just episode 1 doesnt work right. All your other dvds work just fine on my ps3. daman keep it up i love your dvds your amazing .
,Neoretic,2012-11-18T21:22Z,thanks a lot :)
