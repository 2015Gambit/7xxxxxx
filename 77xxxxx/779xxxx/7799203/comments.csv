,ty_uppers,2012-11-06T21:27Z,You are one of the few competent people who upload the Bravo shows. I will be sad to lose you. Thank you for all of the shows you have provided us. I've always loved your work!
,hotslized,2012-11-06T21:31Z,Finally! Thanks.
[T],rkstr,2012-11-06T21:56Z,"@ty_uppers - thats really kind of you, thank you. I'm a perfectionist so it translates into my zeal for uploading but its also really hard work (on top of a paid job).I really need a break from the uploading and the torrent sites for a while.I hope and pray someone will step up to fill my shoes."
,dimitchell,2012-11-06T22:05Z,Don't go...please! You're our old reliable uploader.

,lalasmooch,2012-11-06T22:34Z,so sad to see your leaving rkstr. thankyou anyway for all the housewives and teen mom you've uploaded this year :)
,pulpintro,2012-11-06T23:20Z,Thank you for all you do!
,thankingrkstr,2012-11-06T23:24Z,"Having just graduated from college this May I don't have cable yet. Your torrents have kept me up to date on all my favorite Bravo shows, and I thank you for that!!

There is also an unsaid 'thank you' behind every downloaded torrent of yours. It is sort of a thankless position as most do not have account (I did not before 2 minutes ago), but we are all grateful for allowing us a 45 minute break from our stressful lives to indulge in RHOBH and the other shows you upload. Thank you!"
,lalapoo,2012-11-07T02:25Z,"Excellent quality Torrent . 
(sobbing) Everybody really appreciates and loves you Rocki-poo so once you've had your break PLEASE come back to your loyal FANS, yes fans. =)
Very much appreciate and value all the torrents you provide us. You're a gem and I'll miss you while you're gone. 
We love you Rockster!!!! 
Be safe and have fun!

,tpbsucksballs,2012-11-07T03:11Z,DONT YOU WALK AWAY NOW RKSTR HOW WILL YOU FILL THE VOID IF YOU ABANDON YOUR CALLING YOU WILL FILL IT WITH DRUGS
,passionpit,2012-11-07T05:10Z,"Rkstr, I'm not big on leaving too many comments on tpb, so I apologise for not thanking you sooner than this.
Thank-you for uploading and sharing all of the shows you do, that no-one else here does. Without you, I would not ever have seen or experienced some of them at all. I don't think they're shown in the country I live in - I have not seen them.
So thank-you greatly and I truly hope you enjoy your break, whether it be temporary or permanent."
,lucielou1,2012-11-07T09:36Z,RKSTR you have given a whole bunch of shows a lifeline on here.  Your uploads have always been of impeccable quality - thank you so much for all the work you've put into this.  You shall be sorely missed.
,iluvrkstr,2012-11-07T11:07Z,thanks! you'll be missed!
[T],rkstr,2012-11-07T11:17Z,"I think I've found someone to fill in for me so I can have a break.We're fleshing out the details but it sounds promising.I'm very relieved as I was feeling quite bad about stopping so abruptly (even though I really need the time off).
I'm sure we'll all be on our best behavior for the new RKSTR :-)"
,tomlord40,2012-11-07T14:11Z,"Gah!  Those of us out of the US need you, man.  I doubt anyone could fill your shoes, but I promise to be on my best behaviour!"
,Kimberlay,2012-11-07T15:13Z,"rkstr I don't leave comments often on TPB but I had to with the news of you taking a break.  I have been at home recovering from back surgery for the past two months and your downloads have kept me sane and given me something to look forward to.  Thank you so much for taking the time to upload all of ""The Housewives"" shows.  You will be missed!  Come back soon!"
,csma12,2012-11-07T18:09Z,Thank you for all of your work rkstr!  We will miss you and your quality uploads!  Happy relaxing!

THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR UPLOADS! "
,EnemyDrone,2012-11-09T17:13Z,Too bad none of your U/L are PS3 compatible 
[T],rkstr,2012-11-12T07:32Z,"If I have to hear about those effin PS3s one more time!!!!
I don't own one so I can't test with it and I don't guarantee the files will work on every single device out there. If you're smart enough to work out how to torrent surely you're smart enough to acquire a converter and spend 15 minutes of your oh-so precious time converting the file.Alternatively find another source that will work on a *&&^^% PS3"
,crunksy,2012-11-13T00:08Z,"Thanks for all your primo torrents, and apologies on behalf of any bozos crying about PS3 compatibility, or anything else.  Your torrents have been appreciated by many and they'll be missed in your absence.  Thanks for sharing!"
