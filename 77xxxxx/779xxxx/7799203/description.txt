The brassy, bold beauties of Beverly Hills are back for a third season of wealth, luxury. . .and lots of problems. In the first episode, Lisa and AdrienneΓÇÖs friendship has soured, with both expecting apologies for accusations and barbs made previously. When Lisa doesn't invite Adrienne to the exclusive anniversary party for her restaurant, Adrienne is more than miffed. And theirs is not the only friendship that will be tested in this season of wild outbursts, vehement backbiting, and unrivaled glamour.
