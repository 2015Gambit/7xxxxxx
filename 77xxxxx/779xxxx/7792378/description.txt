Plano, Texas attorney Vale Krenik is an alleged serial rapist and an avid Scientologist, but a recent dump of information by Anonymous members potentially destroys what little credibility Krenik may have had.



According to sources, Krenik has been generous in executing subpoenas on others in order to cease the public from gathering information on his actions.

One example..

From Occupy Collin County:

We received notice of a subpoena served by Vale Krenik, pro se which references his divorce case in Dallas County ΓÇô an issue about which we have written nothing and which we are not at all related.  Speculation is that this is due to us having reported on a case by Vale Krenik against his former legal client which we called a ΓÇ£hushΓÇ¥ suit and have attempted to expose that along with other court processes that we, in our free opinion, have determined are abusive to vulnerable classes of people.  This case is not related to his divorce case that we know of.

Anonymous has a message, ΓÇ£Subpoena this!ΓÇ¥

Anonymous has taken offense, releasing damning evidence in numerous places on the Internet, mirrored again and again so that it cannot be removed.



 

this was released a long time ago and vale krenik had all of the uploads removed so  just putting it where it cant be removed :D
