,BadBreaker,2012-11-05T04:45Z,How about an .avi? I don't see why you guys rush out 1+gb files for a single episode when an .avi is about 1/3rd that in file size.

,watermelonseeds,2012-11-05T05:05Z,thanks friend
,hmathews8,2012-11-05T06:30Z,"@BadBreaker: I'm guessing you're new to this whole thing. Notice how the file type says ""highres""? That's why it's 1.18GB. If you want a .avi that's 1/3 of the size download a regular non-highres upload. "
,Cys1ek,2012-11-05T13:01Z,"@BadBreaker, if u want 1/3 size, download episode resolution 720x300 or something -,- .avi is old-fashioned"
