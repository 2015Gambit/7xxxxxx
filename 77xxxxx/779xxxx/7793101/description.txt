This was one of my mother's favourites, I dedicate it to her memory. This Welsh comedy is set in a small town that has seen better days, and the much-loved cinema has had to shut down. It was a dank, humid sort of place, but people liked it anyway.

[Spoiler] This dank, humid place gets a new lease on life when the caretakers start growing mushrooms - the legal sort - and things get more complicated...

In Welsh with English subtitles. People lined up for Hedd Wyn, so there may be an audience for this!
