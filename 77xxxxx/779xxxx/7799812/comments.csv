,Grizzly Adams,2012-11-14T09:21Z,"And then there's the utter stupidity of the requests. Do you really think someone's sitting on 'The Dark Knight Rises' and is just waiting for someone to say they want it? If it's a new movie, and it's a blockbuster, it's absolutely going to be uploaded here the first moment that's possible. To think it's all depending on you asking is just exceedingly stupid."
,Buccaneer650,2012-11-15T02:01Z,"I know what's going to happen - my long message is going to appear ten times - I swear it hasn't shown up yet, no matter how many times I submit it. If this doesn't show up then I give in!"
,Buccaneer650,2012-11-15T02:02Z,"Ah, that did show up... must have been too long.

Spoiler coming up so beware!"
,Buccaneer650,2012-11-15T02:03Z,WTF? Gone again!

Although the whole movie is in English, it looks like this is maybe from a German disc as the on screen captions at the end are in German (but not the rest of the credits). Just in case you would like to know what it says then here is a translation, using google translate and common sense:
The Maynard ghost is considered the most violent in European history
Mrs. Maynard still lives in the house
Sally still does not dare go into her former bedroom
THIS FILM IS DEDICATED TO IRENE HOLDEN
