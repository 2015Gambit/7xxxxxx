Aoki Karin has always wanted to be a bartender because of an American movie she watched when she was a child. On her 20th birthday, her friends take her out to a bar to celebrate. There she meets Shiino Takumi, who is much cooler and more handsome than the bartender from the film. Alas! Karin believes she has found the one... until she finds out that maybe she jumped into this a bit too fast.
