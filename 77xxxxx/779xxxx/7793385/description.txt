 The Work Experience is a comedy series that features sitcom, mock documentary 
 and prank show formats to create an original and hilarious series. The series 
 is set in the fashion PR agency Grade PR and each week two ambitious interns 
 embark on a week of tasks, tantrums and tears. However, unknown to them, the 
 entire agency is fictional and the employees are a mixture of talented actors.
                                          
                                 Enjoy!
