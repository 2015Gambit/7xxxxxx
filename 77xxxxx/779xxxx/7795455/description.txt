from the website: "In 2002 Katalyst released his debut album Manipulating Agent which received critical acclaim - receiving an ARIA nomination, also winning "Best Producer" and "Best Album" at the 2002 Australian DMA's. The album is predominantly an instrumental producer record, featuring guest vocalists such as Gift of Gab."

less goddamn rapping than later work by the same artist, more funk/soul music and instrumental stuff/breaks. the pops and whistles and so forth are from the original vinyl or whatever - rip report included

if you like it, buy it!
