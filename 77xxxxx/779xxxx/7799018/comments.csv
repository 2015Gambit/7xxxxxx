I did the following and it says I'm activated...

1) I went to the link provided and got the upgrade key.

2) On installation I entered the key from the above link. 

3) I then went to Computer > Properties  and clicked on the ""Activate Now"" button and it seems to have done the trick.

4) Restart and the watermark vanishes.

Many thanks Mdcdesign! Yours seems to be the only truly working method thus far.

Kudos to you sir (or madam) "

,BKKJack,2012-11-10T19:43Z,This doesn't need an activator and I wouldn't touch that one with a ten foot pole.
,ayush55,2012-11-12T12:57Z,"Will installing this iso delete all my files?

I mean will it perform a fresh install???
Someone pls reply"
,BKKJack,2012-11-14T08:58Z,"Ayush, 

it installs with a folder called ""windows old"" which will contain all of the files from your previous windows installation so you can save any files from there and then delete it if you wish."

,johnplayerson,2012-11-17T20:56Z,"This works perfectly, just as the 64 bit version does. I got one pc on 32 bit still and everything works like a charm. Very good work on this persons part, as he actually had to do some work rather than just upload a file.

,asaharaya,2012-11-19T15:54Z,"I recently switched from Windows 7 to Windows 8 using the file you uploaded. It works like a charm and increases the speed of my torrents download/upload too (I dunno how come, but it just does). So thank you very much, @mdcdesign! ;)"
