This is what I've been working on for the past couple of days; an ISO which allows installation and activation of Windows 8 using the free Windows Media Center keys offered on Microsoft's Add Features page.

The Technical Stuff

This was created by using dism to upgrade Windows 8 Professional x64 to ProfessionalWMC, and then integrating a data.dat file produced by using the method developed over at mydigitallife.info.

This will install either without a key at all, or using the trial ProfessionalWMC key from MSDN, or - more importantly - using YOUR WMC upgrade key. If you do the latter, and have an active network connection, you'll end up at a fully activated desktop ready for use :)

This method is good until 31st of January, 2013, so get going!
