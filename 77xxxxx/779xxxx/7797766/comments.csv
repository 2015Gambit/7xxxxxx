,dhjudasx,2012-11-09T07:07Z,"stoatbanter666, Thanks for the feedback, I was concerned about the image quality quite a bit, I really didn't know if I should even upload this version... I was tempted to go all out and do a 5gb encode but I doubt I would have been satisfied with that either. I'm a bit OCD in that regard, which makes encoding and reviewing the material difficult."

So I tried it on Windows Media Player and the video was beautiful but the subtitles didn't work! So I tried downloading VobSub and also Shark Codecs.... nothing has worked. Is it just impossible for an MP4 and SRT file to run at the same time on WMP? Please help. Thanks"
,dhjudasx,2012-11-14T08:38Z,"Slimylimes... typically playback issues in vlc is caused by having additional conflicting codecs installs... remove codec packs you have.. and make sure you have the latest vlc player...  im certain vlc isnt the only one capable of reading srt..

Vlc should playback smooth...try reseting it.. or rekove the other unnecessary codecs..."

Happy viewing."
