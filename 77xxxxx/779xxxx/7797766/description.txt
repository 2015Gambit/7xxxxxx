Compliant with Xbox360/PS3/iPads/Mobile Devices/etc. devices that require the primary Audio stream to be AAC Stereo (many do not accept/work with AAC 5.1 format). Audio Stream 2 available to those that also wish to experience great 5.1 sound that goes right alongside great picture quality.


For those experiencing LOW VOLUME issues, try to playback the 2nd Audio stream in stereo mode, this should improve audio quality and increase the volume substantially.

Judas's Note 1:

First off, while most will notice that so far all of my 1080p uploads are 2,250kbps Video Bitrate, this one however is 2,500kbps. The reason for this is in regards to how demanding this movie is at 1080p and the sheer amount of detail in the movie. While it's nowhere near perfect, after doing literally dozens of encodes with various settings and bitrates to find the most economic size without sacrificing quality the best I could, raising the bitrate any further would show no noticeable improvement without making a massive jump to about 3,500kbps which would increase the file size to well over 4gb which obviously isn't exactly ideal either. Now many may scoff at the size and go for something smaller, which is fair, but, I didn't want to make a blocky mess of a movie, where most of the motion is totally a wash of pixelated blocks fluttering across the screen.

Second, I think this movie DESERVES to have a bit more bitrate for video... Beautiful movie screams better quality encode.

					
Judas's Note 2:

This is yet another rare movie that includes both a properly mixed and flawless 2 channel Stereo audio track along with 5.1 Surround. Therefore your primary audio stream should be relatively FLAWLESS and without any audio anomalies that usually can occur when down mixing from surround sound to 2 channel stereo.
