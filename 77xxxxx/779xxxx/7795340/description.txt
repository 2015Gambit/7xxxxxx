Gold Digger #141
Dreadwing's invasion of Jade-Realm proceeds apace, starting with the ruin of Jag's Lair by an enforced alliance with the were-cat leader, Xercie. As otherworldly horrors batter at the walls of Jag's Lair's dimensional pocket, were-jaguar Gar calls in the big guns for help: his friend Gina Diggers and her giant robot!

Gold Digger #142
With the were-cat leader Xercie first co-opted and then captured, Dreadwing has freed the Orkrist tyrant Serpentus and left ethereal "bait" to lure all manner of beasts from other dimensions to destroy Xercie's home of Jag's Lair. Gina and Britanny fight the onslaught bravely, but Dreadwing's left evidence meant to break the fragile trust within Jade's ruling council, so the Diggers sisters will be left without backup!

Gold Digger #143
As Princess Debra ascends to her mother's throne, she rewards Gina and Britanny for their help in fending off Dreadwing. Meanwhile, Dreadwing has arranged for a spy among the wild magi of the Astral Rifts to plot an assault on Jade. And we see what a few other family members and friends have been up to while all this is going on...
