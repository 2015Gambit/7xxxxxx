,YarzRevenge,2012-11-06T03:53Z,"Just to clear up any confusion, this episode is also considered part of season 7, the final season, and is listed as episode 6 in Wiki episode list (S07E06), but could also be listed as S07E05 since wiki counts iShock America as 2 episodes, 1 & 2.

Thanks for sharing :)"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-06T04:50Z,Why are you marking these as the LOL release group? They didn't pre these...
,pirateguy122,2012-11-06T13:01Z,"@MrUnpopular

sorry about that. the source i get them from has it named like that. sorry. i'll make sure my next upload doesn't have it. thanks for telling me :)"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-09T04:38Z,"Ahh gotcha. Weird. http://predb.me/?search=icarly+group%3Alol

As you can see, LOL has never released anything iCarly related. Someone might think this is fake as a result. Just tag it with NoGRP (no group), your own thing, or nothing. :P

Thanks for the up. :)"
