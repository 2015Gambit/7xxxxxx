Description:

Yamada Momoka is your average 16 year old girl. Her family consists of herself, her dad who works at a TV station, and her mom. Apparently she also has a strict prune of a grandma, but who doesnΓÇÖt? Except that the grandma, Yamada Tamaki, had an accident at the TV station where she got electrocuted and now looks like a 16 year old Yamato Nadeshiko. It isnΓÇÖt easy for Momoka when her grandma arbitrarily decides to attend MomokaΓÇÖs high school as a student as well. Tamaki isnΓÇÖt just pretty, sheΓÇÖs also very cultured, well-mannered, and still maintains her old-fashioned streak from her 65 years of wisdom. ItΓÇÖs bad enough when Momoka starts being referred to as ΓÇ£Old YamadaΓÇ¥ and her grandma (Tamaki) referred to as ΓÇ£New YamadaΓÇ¥, but itΓÇÖs even worse when MomokaΓÇÖs crush on a dashing young man starts to take an interest in Tamaki as well. Fight-o, Momoka! Protect your beloved grandma, Momoka! And donΓÇÖt let her walk off with your boytoy, Momoka!
