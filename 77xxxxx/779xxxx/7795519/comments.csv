ERROR TEXT: The Software Licensing Service reported that the license is not installed.


what to do?"
,treehumper83,2012-11-06T19:54Z,"You may have to manually add a license key. That's something I should've mentioned. I did that first, went into Office and added the key 2MNJP-QY9KX-MKBKM-9VFJ2-CJ9KK

That might be the difference you're looking for."

,makerim,2012-11-07T04:33Z,It doesn't work on Win 7 x64 get this message ERROR TEXT: The Software Licensing Service reported that the license is not installed. I remove Office 13 and reinstall Office 2010 back and did not work on that either I have to use V 2.4 to install licensing file and it did work.  Install Licensing file is missing on this rev?
,RedAutumn,2012-11-07T06:45Z,A copy of Microsoft Office 2013 Volume Licensing Edition should work with this KMS activator. By the time MS Office 2013 is properly released there should also be a proper toolkit.
,RedAutumn,2012-11-13T03:40Z,"A proper KMS activator for MS Office was released yesterday.

No need to download this toolkit."
