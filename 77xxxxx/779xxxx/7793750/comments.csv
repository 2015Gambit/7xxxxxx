,hmathews8,2012-11-05T05:23Z,Sceneline only uploads rars. If you want something else DibyaTPB uploads .mkv : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7793809/Dexter.S07E06.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE_[PublicHD]
,festisio,2012-11-05T09:25Z,"The funny thing is sceneline is always SECOND to dibyatpb - so it's not even as if he leaves it rar'd to save a few seconds off the torrent creation so he can get 1st spot.  Dibya always beats him.

So retarded.  Worthlesss."
,doe9975,2012-11-05T18:07Z,How about some goddamn gratitude for the awesome uploaders who bring us these timely releases? Many thanks!!!
