It could be I'm missing some codec though.
Does anyone have an idea how to get both audio and video in one player?"
,UA-07,2012-11-06T19:32Z,"Update VLC to the latest stable edition , also check if you have the latest codecs for the other video players as VLC codecs are for its sole usage ."
[V],2010kaiser,2012-11-06T20:03Z,Cheers and thanks for that UA-07 ;-)
,antignor,2012-11-13T00:46Z,"Thanks for the advice UA-07. I have the mediabuntu repo in my sources and have ""restricted-extras"" and ""bad"" codec packages installed and quite a few other. Everything is up-to-date.
Is there any package in particular I should install?"
