Publication Date:  February 2006

The little Iliane witnesses with horror the fury of the men of a local lord who killed her mother, accused of witchraft. She is then brought to Southern Cross, the lordΓÇÖs castle, where she is forced into tough child labour. Another child, Dominique, suffers the same torment and must bear with the fits of the lordΓÇÖs son, a violent and unpredictable child. Day after day, the woods around Southern Cross seem to animate and have a life of their own. Has Iliane inherited the powers of her mother? And where does this eerie wind blowing in the region come from...?  This fantastic tale of the middle ages is set apart by its troubling story and the splendid art of Raquel Alzate, great hope of comic artists.
