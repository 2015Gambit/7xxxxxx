,Enoxx86,2012-11-06T22:29Z,"First of all this only works with dashlaunch 3.03, and 3.02 on the 16 for 3.03 and 3.02 on the 149/155 versions of the dashboard. 
You do not need to unistall dashlaunch at all either. 
When in dashlaunch press LB and you will be in the setting mode of dashlaunch. 
Next go to Unload Dashlaunch, and unload it. 
Then go up to the launch folder and bring up the .xex file you want to load and the game will no longer freeze on the 0 second mark. "
