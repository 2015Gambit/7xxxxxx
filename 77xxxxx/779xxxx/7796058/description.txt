Crossed - Badlands 16
Publisher:  Avatar Press
Publication Date:  October 24, 2012

Writer:  David Hine
Artist:  Georges Duarte

David Hine and artist George Duarte have created a story that takes all of our fears about interpersonal relationships and throws them in a bloody blender. It's no longer an exercise in self-discovery for our group of egotistical young writers. Now it's a lesson in survival and sheer horror as they see their hidden inner desires and excesses turned real as the Crossed virus lets them look at the monsters within.

There is no hope.

There is no help.

There is only the Crossed.
