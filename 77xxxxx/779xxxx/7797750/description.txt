Dirty Tricks pts 1+2 (ITV 2000) DVD Rip aac x264 mp4


starring Martin Clunes, Julie Graham, James Bolam, Lindsay Duncan & 

Neil Dudgeon

bases on the book by Michael Dibdin

from the DVD notes:

Part bawdy bedroom farce, part zany crime caper... Martin Clunes is 

a charming underachiever on the run from the law. After befriending 

an accountant,, he beds the man's randy wife, Karen, before a 

wealthy widow next catches his eye. When Karen meets an untimely 

demise, a plodding police detective gets involved, and things take a 

decidedly dicey turn.


It was originally in 2 parts, which I have merged into 1 (by 

removing the 'spoilers' at the end of part 1 and the résumé during 

the start of part 2). Thus the original 146 minutes total is only 

2:22:45.
