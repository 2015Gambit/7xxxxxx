,firexninja,2012-11-06T07:02Z,thank you!
,Stock3rz,2012-11-06T10:37Z,Cheers great torrent as always. For the new comers; this is survey free. just a clean rip that is just a video file nothing else. Always reliable eztv. Walking Dead and revolution are my two favourite shows at this moment.
,Sknmissle,2012-11-06T14:09Z,lol i just downloaded episodes 1 - 7 and noticed the comment section getting smaller and smaller with each new episode. Does it really suck that bad???????????
,PinoyVampire,2012-11-06T17:48Z,"It's good but people rather watch than comment.
Unless there's bad comments, i assume it's pretty good."
,tflagger997,2012-11-06T18:07Z,"Yes, the show is proving to just be another Lost/Flash Forward.  Teasers of development, but no delivery.  Lots of backstory, and they by episode 6 they have destroyed all respect for the Uncle.  I am sure they were trying to make him into an anti-hero, but they overshot by a light year.

I had hope Kripke was going somewhere, but after episode 6 I realized that is unlikely.  Just giving it one more episode before writing this series off."
,sutil1,2012-11-06T19:09Z,Thanks eztv for your amazing work!!! 100% Trustful!!!!

,recup,2012-11-07T04:12Z,"This show really sucks. How come the center of the story is a stupid girl, spoilled girl, who decides to save anybody and everybody who passes in front of her in every episod."
,recup,2012-11-07T04:15Z,"unfortunelly everyones comments wont being seen by whoever should really see,like the ones who writes the story."
