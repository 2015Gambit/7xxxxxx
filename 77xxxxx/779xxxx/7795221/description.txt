So... I've been looking for this movie in watchable quality but I found only small 700MB version in cut-widescreen. It looked like this:

I found another version ripped from HDTV, but... it was Russian version and I like to watch movies in original language with subtitles. On addition this versions have 5 minute difference (cut scenes etc).
Finally I used english audio and HDTV video, with some magic stuff I have synchronized it almost ideal and it have a lot better quality than previous version.
The Bonaducci's Remastered version looks like this:
