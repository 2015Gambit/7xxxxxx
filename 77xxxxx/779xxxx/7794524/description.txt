Three years ago, FBI agent Erica Reed lost her brother to a serial killer
 who was never caught. During this desperate investigation, she developed
 the strange and unpredictable power of post-cognition: by touching an
 object, she can see its past and the events that happened on, to, or around
 it. Though undeniably useful in her line of work, this skill makes her
 uneasy and has caused her problems professionally and personally. Now a new
 serial killer is on the move one who leaves behind clues perfectly suited
 to Agent Reed's unique abilities. Has someone learned her secret? What do
 they want from her? More importantly: by working this case, will Erica
 finally uncover enough evidence to bring her brother's killer to justice?
