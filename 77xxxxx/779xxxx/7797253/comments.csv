,bleek23,2012-11-25T03:28Z,"I THINK STYLISHSALH IS DOWNLOADING YIFY TEAMS UPLOADS N CONVERTING THEM 2 A SMALLER SIZE! SMALLER = SUCK ON LARGER SCREENS...WHAT A THEIF! YEAH, I KNOW, I'M A HATER RIGHT? NO...BUT, 4 STYLISHSALH 2 COPY & CONVERT YIFY TEAMS UPLOADS & PAWN THEM OFF AS HIS OWN IS PATHETIC...SMH@THIS WANNABE YIFY WANNABE...NO 1 UPLOADS LIKE YIFY...IF YOUR SMART, WATCH YIFY RECENT UPLOADS AND HOW STYLISHSALH UPLOADS THEM A DAY LATER...YOU PEOPLE CAN'T BE THAT DUMB...OR ARE YOU? I KNOW THESE MOVIES ARE FREE, BUT DAMN! LOL..."
,NIT158,2012-11-26T13:44Z,"@bleek23 : 2 things - 
                 1)I know Stylishsalh sources .. and he definitely doesn't take yify as source
                    he only takes bluray sources ... coz if yify sources were taken then the output 
                    would n't be as awesome as this

                 2)IF YOU HAVE SUCH A LARGE SCREEN, THEN WHY DO YOU DOWNLOAD 480p
                    VIDEOS ?? 
I'm just assuming u r just a dumbass & a newbie to torrents ...
if u dont like it .. dont come here
AND ..  IF U ARE AN OBSESSED YIFY FAN DOESN'T MEAN U HAVE TO HATE OTHER UPLOADERS
maaan why do I even care"
