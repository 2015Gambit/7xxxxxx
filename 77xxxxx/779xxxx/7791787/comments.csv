Thanks cracker!"
,Andrezado,2012-11-04T16:28Z,Thanks a lot man :DDD it works guys
,kewlin,2012-11-04T16:31Z,"The concept is interesting but UI and control is bad and hard to understand. They need to fix it, make it more user friendly."
,Andrezado,2012-11-04T16:59Z,"Dude it's just a prototype, still pre-alpha man, what the fuck do you expected?"
,Andrezado,2012-11-05T13:03Z,"It still is bugged, but now the problem is with the cracked version you uploaded, we can't freaking save "
,Andrezado,2012-11-05T19:10Z,"Fix this please :) When we click ""Save Game"" or ""Load Game"" doesn't matters where or what things you're doing, basicly all options of the game disappears and only the New Game option is there, even tho we can't even exit the menu anymore ner start a new game ner exit the own game. Please fix this man, it would be so cool!"
