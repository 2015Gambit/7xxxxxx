I did not know if it was coincidence but the theme is identical to one of Wishman's films made in the late 50's (IIRC) called ""Diary of a Nudist"" in which a reporter is sent to investigate a nudist camp..

Other Doris Wishman titles from this period are ""Nude On The Moon"" which I found in a science fiction collection at Demonoid and ""Hideout In The Sun"":  a caper plot line in which a mildly bad guy hides out in a nudist camp. 

What is interesting about this to me is that films like the Wishman ones show certificates as ok to show in public theaters without the onus of being shown only in sex districts and the like.

The production is by Something Weird Video.  One of these specialty video houses has some other Doris Wishman shows-- one of which has not been torrented.
