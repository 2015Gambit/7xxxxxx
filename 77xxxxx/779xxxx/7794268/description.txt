This harrowing new miniseries follows Duncan, a desperate man at a drug rehabilitation center who becomes the reluctant participant in a harebrained scheme involving himself, three of his roommates from rehab, and a drug-sniffing dog. The dog sniffs out drug-filled storage units that the team can then rip off. Everything goes as planned until a deranged drug trafficker finds his storage unit empty and goes looking for his merchandise... and the men who took it.
