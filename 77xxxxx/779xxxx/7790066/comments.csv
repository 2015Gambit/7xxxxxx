The new 1.31 release broke the iAP Free, so you can no longer get free money in the game. Hopefully the plugin for iAP Free gets updated to the new 1.31 release.

What I did was use 1.30 and iAP Free; when I put in $2,000,000,000 and upgraded to v1.31, the game started with -$583,000. So I re-installed 1.30 on the phone (using iFunbox), and used iAP Free again to put in $5,000,000, and upgrade to 1.31 on the phone again (again using iFunbox instead of iTunes), and it stayed.

I kept the 1.30 .IPA file, and figured that when I run out of money, I can try re-installing 1.30 on the phone using iFunbox, and then use iAP Free to ramp up the money. Several items are not compatible with 1.30 (they don't exist), so not sure if I'd lose them or not. : "
