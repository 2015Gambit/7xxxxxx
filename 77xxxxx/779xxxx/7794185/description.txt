The series focuses on the franchise's heroine, Fujiko Mine, as she undergoes various missions and encounters other characters in the Lupin universe. Sayo Yamamoto is the director of the series, making it the first Lupin title to be directed by a woman. It is darker, more serious and sexually oriented, which is more inline with the original Lupin manga, and is the first series in which Lupin is not the main protagonist.
