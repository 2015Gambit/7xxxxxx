,TARZ3N,2012-11-06T08:04Z,Fuck my internet is slow...arhhhh
,Valagard,2012-11-06T10:41Z,"Confirmed legit

Though first 1-2 minutes is in russian, and last 1-2 minutes of the game is missing its audio

Quality of the cam and audio is -REALLY- low, but its a incredibly fantastic movie, so its up to you if you want to grab it now vs later

Movie 9,000,0000,000,000 out of 10

Audio 3 out of 10

Video 2 out of 10 (Some scenes there is so much glare its impossible to see things)"
,joegreg13,2012-11-06T11:33Z,The little girl is the best part of the movie. You take her out you got yourself a G old school Disney movie for sure. Ok the main problems with the video is simple. The sound is really bad. The guy had to be sitting next to speaker and light. You see a flashing light through out the whole movie. You had to increase and decrease the sound the whole time too. I turned it off after 45 mins because I thought I was going to have seizure watching it. The flashing light is really bad mixed with white clouds. It is watchable if you really really want to see it and can put up with all this stuff 
,Avamansu,2012-11-06T15:34Z,"well give it 2 days and a new copy will be out, i already know someone whos got a copy and uploading soon i hope"
,MrMontag,2012-11-06T16:16Z,"I'm a bit late for this little review, but: 

A: It's a bit quiet and cuts of at the last 5 minutes of the movie. 4/10 (given it's a first release)

V: The video is a bit too glare-y and during the big race scene you can't see anything.  It also seems to have been recorded at a weird cropped Resolution. 3/10

As for how steady the video was, You MUST of been using a tripod. I swear, you have the most steady hand in the world. 10/10

Overall: for a First release this upload is pretty damned good. Thank you for it! 17/30 - 56%"
,Sonikuu,2012-11-06T23:01Z,I could of filmed a better copy with my potato.

,brownnotesuicide,2012-11-07T07:30Z,"A- Cut bottoms off of styrofoam cups and put around your ears while wearing earplug

M- haven't seen it yet, just watched the sample clips and threw up in my mouth a little

,lebron30,2012-11-07T16:34Z,wtf blured movie
,auracool,2012-11-08T00:13Z,s blurry and the camera had a lighting issue....bright/not/bright/not/bright like watching a strobe-light on its slowest speed....thanx anyway...if i could afford to pay someone to watch my kids i could afford to buy a hi-def cam and record these things myself...
,auracool,2012-11-08T00:15Z,"p.s. popnetic must be on acid or something.....even on a 95"" smart t.v. this would still be blurry....kids just say no to popnetic"
,ZombieTurtlePro,2012-11-08T22:22Z,"A: 2/10
V: 2/10

It's not even worth downloading."
,brownnotesuicide,2012-11-09T02:49Z,@LeeSinLee lol nope
,xsadx,2012-11-09T14:52Z,"this copy is complete trash , its better to wait it out . "
,Valagard,2012-11-09T14:59Z,"Why is there so many bots in these pages telling you to goto other websites?

I went to one on my Sandboxed test PC I use to clean clients computers, thing went apeshit"
,brownnotesuicide,2012-11-09T23:47Z,the bots...THEY ARE EVERYWHERE!!!
,str8upjuggalette69,2012-11-11T08:01Z,made it 5 minutes in and couldn't see much or hear much of anything is legit but is very low  quality  thanxz though ^_^
,rae47,2012-11-12T04:19Z,"So much glare, the audio is barely audible, and it's in a different language for a while. 
V: 3
A:3
It makes sense though, since this is a very new release."
,wyattspoppa,2012-11-13T02:16Z,"I'd never criticize something for free, I especially wouldn't impune one of the best uploaders anywhere, but this is a waste of a Gig. It's completely, totally inaudible. It doesn't matter how poor video is, it's always ""watchable"", only the quality can be improved, but when you literally can't hear the words, it may as well be uploaded in ancient Cherokee for only the ""Windtalkers"" could make out words. Tykoon is awesome but this is unusable. V-3 A 0.5"
,Pokemon445,2012-11-17T16:45Z,THANK YOU! !!!!
,Uxmen12,2012-11-28T14:41Z,Movie it's really great I enjoyed a lot but since quality of this torrent is really bad i went to searched for better version and found pretty nice one at lookatthis.jploh.com
