There was once XOR that put out continuous damaged goods. It tool a year for ""The Scene"" to get rid of them and restor quality.

Now LOL has been putting out continuously damaged goods for close to a year now - here's hoping and end to their evil reign is at hand.

When bad drops out - good ALWAYS fills the gap.
