,creative3,2012-11-06T10:49Z,"There is no difference between RTM and Retail Channel release. in fact, the retail channel build was compiled a day before the RTM build.

this is the update (Windows8-RT-KB2756872) which was released on 10th Oct 2012 makes it GDR release.

Further, MS has no plan in future to integrate these updates/patches to the windows 8 ISO to make it one like it was done in Windows 7. all patches and updates will be always available on online.
the current version of windows 8 Pro x64 bits after updateds and patches is 9200.16424.amd64fre.win8_gdr.120926-1855
but yes, people are making it one after integrating these updates and patches (customized ISO) using MS Assessment and Deployment Tools.

so either you use RTM or so called retail, makes it no difference."

could you please tell me how to check the build string along with compilation date in win7 & win8 as you mentioned in your comment? I'll be grateful "
,creative3,2012-11-06T12:58Z,"@SM-003 ,
please open Registry Editor (to open it please type in search 

REGEDIT

works well in both win7 and win8 os.

now just expand the following key in sequence:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersion
and click the last key CurrentVersion.

now in the right pane please look for the following two ValueName:
BuildLab
BuildLabEx

these two valueName tell you the build and version of your current OS.

dear,

9200.16424.amd64fre.win8_gdr.120926-1855

in the above value the last 10 digits denotes date and time of the build. in the above value 
120926-1855
yymmdd-hhmm
means: 
12 = year 2012
09=  Month September
26= date 26
18= Hours
55= minutes
so this build is compiled on
26th September 2012 at 18 hours 55 minutes.

please remember that this is the date when windows was released for public (you can say it for retail)

but please note that I have installed RTM build which was compiled on 120725-1247 means on 25th July 2012 at 12 hours 47 minutes. but I have installed updates Windows8-RT-KB2756872-x64 and after this the build becomes gdr and shows compiled on 26th September 2012 at 18 hours 55 minutes.

is it clear this time dear?"

,SM-003,2012-11-06T18:25Z,"@creative3

Thank you so much for replying ..Yes I got that.

but I have some more queries in this case. Hope you 'll clear that too.

1. Is gdr stands for Retail copy while rtm stands for RTM copy? If I see gdr in buildlab string then it's assuming a retail copy of my win7 (yes, current I'm using Win7) right??

2. Next in the BuildLabEx string everyone (including you & me) got the common parameter that is 'amd64fre'. what's that? could you pls explain??

3. What are the main differences between RTM & Retail copy 

4. If I use RTM vr of win8 instead of retail then what 'll be the pros & cons and vice-versa?

5. You wrote in your last comment that ';please remember that this is the date when windows was released for public (you can say it for retail)' but as we all know Win8 publicly released on 26th oct for general availability. then??

,creative3,2012-11-07T02:37Z,"@SM-003,

GDR = General Distribution Release
amd64fre = x64 bits 
RTM = Release to Manufacturer. this copy is released to manufacturer to build their system for sale. 
Retail : this copy is available for general users which is General Distribution Release (GDR)

if you use rtm copy of windows 8 instead of retail copy then it makes no difference as after all online updates it will become retail builds (gdr).
Please note that microsoft did not release any different build of retail copy than RTM. both copies have same build. it just after updates which makes different.

few users have slipstreamed  the updates with RTM copy and uploaded with the name retail copy.

26th Oct 2012 is the date when windows 8 was made available to General users but 26th Sep 2012 (120926-1855) is the date when it was finally compiled and signed off for general public. it is called GDR build date and time and not release time.
do not bother to download so called retail copy. no difference between rtm and retail compiled by MS.
RTM which is also available at MSDN and TEchnet account which is as follows:
File Name: en_windows_8_x64_dvd_915440.iso
Languages: English
SHA1: 1CE53AD5F60419CF04A715CF3233F247E48BEEC4

the above iso includes two windows 8 namely 1. windows 8 core and 2. windows 8 Pro, therefore its size is 4.3 GB for 64 bits if you exclude windows 8 core edition from this ISO to make it only windows 8 pro then its size will become 2.76 GB approx. which is available via MS download on and after 26th Oct 2012 but no difference in build of windows 8 pro for RTM and Retail so far."
,creative3,2012-11-07T02:45Z,"I am sorry as I wrongly mentioned the size of windows 8 msdn copy 64 bits 4.3 GB which is not correct. its size is 3.33 GB.
so please read it 3.44 GB.
thanks."
,SM-003,2012-11-07T07:30Z,"Thanks again creative3 ..I really appreciate it. 

Can you tell me one more thing that I've see a N edition in MSDN site when I was looking for the Win8 Enterprise x64 iso. What's that actually?

And can you provide me the direct dl link of Windows 8 Enterprise Edition x64 via MS download site (preferred) or via MSDN or something else? 

I wanna to use Wib8 Ent to test the Windo to go features in my Seagate goflex external hdd. Have you or anyone over here tried this feature? then plz give us the feedback. 

And one more thing creative3...if i use a x86 os then what 'd be the sting for that instead of amd64fre??"
,SM-003,2012-11-07T08:27Z,Also another thing I forgot to ask....is there any official new retail ISO that MS launched /released  for win8 after 26th oct (for public availability) that includes those KB2756872 updates officially

,gab_themagic,2012-11-07T19:50Z,"guys, I've downloaded the windows 8 all versions AIO and tried to activate windows. I'm confused because the windows message after restarting the host pc, says she was permanently disabled and also the personalization option is unlocked ... but when I give the shortcut windows + pause break to go pro system, it appears that the windows is not activated. Being that when I type slmgr / dli appears that enabled forever. Is this a bug or is not activated? Thanks people."
,murphy78,2012-11-07T22:05Z,"There is no such thing as an Enterprise retail copy.  They are simply not sold in retail stores.  You are confusing MSDN with Retail stores like most people.

GDR just stands for General Development Release.
LDR stands for Limited Development Release.

Honestly, I've never even seen a LDR release.  GDR controls the kind of hotfixes you download. It does not show any sort of validity of retail.

From the eula I can tell that someone added an ei.cfg, but it also shows that it is an RTM with the RM in the file name.

Anyhow, nice try but Enterprise is not available in retail stores."
,JBiz1,2012-11-07T22:57Z,"Why use a activator? You can use KMS Server method and get activated 180 days then it will reactivate every 180 days!!! Then you dont have to worry about updates and M$ blocking you on future updates!!!! Sounds alot better than using a activator and safer to me....DO NOT RUN THE ACTIVATOR IF YOU WANT TO USE KMS SERVER METHOD!!!!

Email me for the KMS Server info:

Again email me for the server! Cheers!"
,murphy78,2012-11-08T00:29Z,"sorry, forgot you don't need ei.cfg for enterprise to show that eula.  Still, it's RTM.  In fact, it's the same iso file name as the WZT RTM release.  I'm sure the hashes probably match too."

hi everyone, 
(1)there is a virus in the Activators so avoid using antivirus as it will delete the files and windows will crash.
(2) In Windows updates, change settings to check but don't install automatically and by installing (KB2756872 update) you have to run the activator again but not fix.
(3) Buy Windows 8 if affordable for you!!!!!!!!!!~
(4) If you are not an advance user and that also means if you don't know what restore points are then disable windows update.
(5) Every single time you guy install any software or update please create Windows Restore Points, only if you think windows is out of bad luck.

Works!~ Enjoy New OS as I am :) x32 & x64"

If anyone installed (Anti-Virus) and you are seeing a black screen after you log-in. Here is what you need to do to fix that problem:
0: Go to Processes and select one (any) and right click and select Open file location to open explorer and go to control panel and uninstall your anti-virus.
1: Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete 
2: Run Task Manager
3: Select File from top menu and open (Run New Task)
4: Click Browse and Find the crack (Activator) and select and (Right-Click) and Run as Administrator. Y = yes.

After updates are installed you're OS will be deactivated so Run the Activator if so.
