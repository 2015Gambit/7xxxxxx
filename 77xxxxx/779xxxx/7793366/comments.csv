The bible never changes because they want to peddle the same old lies to all and sundry.

If Darwin was wrong, at least he had evidence to support his claims, something religion has failed to provide. 

IF you can provide one shred - one single shred - of evidence that there's a God then I'll give your wacky theories some consideration.  

Until then, scientifically PROVEN Darwinism it is...."
,Zencarna,2012-11-05T03:02Z,First of all Darwin never said there was no Christ. Lie number 1. Second the Bible has changed all throughout history from the original language biased translations from Greek to Latin to English. Lie number 2. Books keep changing because we keep gaining knowledge. If we kept the same science books that were written at the time of the bible we'd still be shitting in the streets.
,Zencarna,2012-11-05T03:13Z,Well my comment was deleted. Guess including facts is Anti Christian as well as Science.
,BKKJack,2012-11-05T20:15Z,"Well said!

I don't even class crap like this as ""Christianity"" as it is so far removed from rational thought - something most Christians I know are more than capable of.

This sort of dribble is just an embarrassment to true, sensible Christians and does more harm than good to Christianity than Darwinism ever could..."

WOW ! I didn't know dinosaurs and humans lived together, that evolution never happened and that all people find in neat layers showing a series of species appearing evolving and disappearing forever is a clever plot of atheistic evolutionists who put all that there to deceive us (or maybe it was the Devil who did that). From now on I'll be an enlightened redneck believing in god creator, jesus and all those legends !!!!
Halleluyah !!!!
