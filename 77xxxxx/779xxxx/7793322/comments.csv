,Super-E,2012-11-05T16:50Z,How is it Pal and region free Im confused
,un3gr0,2012-11-05T21:09Z,"@Super-E this game is RF, but was released only in europe and marked as PAL, but it is Region Free. Some Games, are region locked but work on all regions. Look only a few games have this feature. Enjoy, it will work on your NTSC console.

Look at this. (its in portuguese, so use google translator).

,GSergeant,2012-11-06T22:29Z,This is only in Italian language. I didn't find a way to change it. Perhaps un3gr0 could tell us how?

PAL isnt a region, neither is NTSC.
those are video signal types
both PAL and NTSC have mutiple regions.
EUROPE and JAP for example are 2 different PAL regions
AUSTRALIA and NORTHA AMERICA being 2 different NTSC regions."
