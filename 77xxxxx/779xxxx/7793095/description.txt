Mountains exist in almost every country in the world and almost every war has included some type of mountain
operations. This pattern will not change; therefore, Soldiers will fight in mountainous terrain in future conflicts.
Although mountain operations have not changed, several advancements in equipment and transportation have
increased the SoldiersΓÇÖ capabilities. The helicopter now allows access to terrain that was once unreachable, or
that was only reachable by slow, methodical climbing. Inclement weather, however, may place various
restrictions on the capabilities of air assets available to a commander. The unit must then possess the necessary
mountaineering skills to overcome adverse terrain to reach an objective.
This training circular details techniques Soldiers and leaders must know to cope with mountainous terrain.
These techniques are the foundation upon which the mountaineer must build. They must be applied to the
various situations encountered to include river crossings, glaciers, snow-covered mountains, ice climbing, rock
climbing, and urban vertical environments. The degree to which this training is applied must be varied to
conform to known enemy doctrine, tactics, and actions. This TC also discusses basic and advanced techniques
to include acclimatization, illness and injury, equipment, anchors, evacuation, movement on glaciers, and
training.
