Compilation of performances from the BBC archive spanning 35 years of Paul Weller,
from the Jam to the Style Council to his solo career.

From the heady days of mod-punk trio the Jam there's In The City on TOTP,
The Eton Rifles on teen pop culture show Something Else and more, up to
their final single Beat Surrender.

Jazz-funk-soul collective the Style Council take over with first single
Speak Like a Child on Sight & Sound and a storming Walls Come
Tumbling Down on the Whistle Test.

Weller's persistently successful solo career is chronicled on Later with Jools
where he's the most frequently featured artist in the show's history - with Sunflower
to the Attic (from 2012's Sonik Kicks album), plus an acoustic rendition of the Jam
classic That's Entertainment with Noel Gallagher.

Amongst other treats are a rarely-seen performance from the Electric Proms of Etta
James's Don't Go to Strangers, where the changingman is joined onstage at the
Roundhouse by Amy Winehouse.
