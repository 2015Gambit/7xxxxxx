FLEETWOOD MAC

May 21, 1977
Nashville Municipal Auditorium
Nashville, TN

(Soundboard)

This is a recent cassette transfer and the sound on it is outstanding. 
I think it's the best sounding soundboard of the Rumours tour - and an 
upgrade from what I've previously heard of this recording. It's a seemless 
recording meaning there are no cuts or edits between tracks. 

There is a very slight cut at the end of disc one, but it's right at the 
end of Gold Dust Woman,no vocals are cut. There is also a slight cut in at 
the beginning of disc two, but again no vocals are sliced off.

I have no info on who taped the show, but a big thanks to everyone responsible 
for getting this tape transferred - it's a really great sounding show.
