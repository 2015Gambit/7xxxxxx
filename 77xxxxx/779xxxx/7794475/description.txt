Description:
All the way, all directions are open to you. In Need for Speed: Most Wanted rider moves freely around the city and can easily fall in industrial and in sleeping areas.
The city lives its life. Dense traffic, and even traffic jams - a common occurrence, but when the tail of the police, "kettles" and narrow alleys - are your best allies.
Brand new gameplay. Previously required of us a response to slip between cars at breakneck speed. Now you need skill. Shake off the chase from the tail can only be a virtuoso stunt of the discharge of aerobatics.
Chrome, shiny and perfect. The car is still a means of expression and in the hands of craftsmen into a work of art. Need for Speed: Most Wanted also offers tremendous opportunities tuning engines.
"Black list beckons and frightens." Winning competitors, you pave the way into the racing elite of the city. Having won the local "kings", the rookie will be on top of the "Black List", for which he honored, respected, but also increased attention to the enforcers.
