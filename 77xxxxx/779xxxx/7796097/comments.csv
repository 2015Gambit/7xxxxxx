,s1raz1,2012-11-08T05:56Z,WTF... this update changed the iniative of runic mages to 2... and it doesnt fix the ice dragon bug not gettinga minion charge after scoring a kill :/ back to the old bugged  version.
,s1raz1,2012-11-08T17:06Z,"i was mistaken, the ice dragon bug was fixed, it was bugged on the quicksave, a normal load of a savegame made it available, the rune mages tho had their initiative lowered to 2 :/
 who knows what else changed?"
,handel1,2012-11-11T14:09Z,The rune mages are pretty powerful. If they go first with their phantom spell they would finish almost every combat before even starting it.
