|-This will NOT fit on a 4.7GiB DVDR.  You need a Multi-Layer DVDR or USB -|

|There are no well established activation bypass as of yet, so I have not  |
|included them.                                                            |

|No Windows 8 Settings were harmed in the making of this ISO.              |
|No Programs are added.                                                    |
|No Unattended Settings were added to the installation.                    |
|No Registry Settings were modified.                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Either burn the included .iso file to a dvdr or use a usb flash drive.    |
|I have included diskpart instructions and the win7usb tool.               |
|I personally use diskpart and winrar, but the tool may be easier.         |

|I have personally tested every install on this ISO.  It should not        |
|require a setup key as there is a skip button, but if it does, I have     |
|included some default install keys.  I have not verified them as working. |
|Use them at your own risk. I tested a different language for each install.|
