After a swordfight, Amane, a young samurai with a haunted past, is left for dead-only to be saved by a mysterious tattooist who imbues Amane with the immortal spirit of an oni demon. From that day on, Amane ages no more. Amane learns of another with a similar oni-one that requires its host to kill-which leads Amane to the realization that the 'other' is the man who murdered his sister years ago. But when his decades-long quest for the murderer causes him to cross paths with a maniacal serial killer intent on murdering the woman Amane loves, the only one who can help him is the man who killed his sister.
