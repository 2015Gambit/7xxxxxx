Here in Europe, when the Mentalist gets broadcast, it's already early morning; and I am waiting to get here the file like the children wait for Santa at Christmas morning!"

,Inpuris,2012-11-06T03:21Z,"@Aoishiro - How would you tell they are fake?  

I think I have about 80-ish connected peers that I see right now.

I'm not really sure what you're talking about but if you give me more info I'll be happy to tell you what I can.  

Of course mine is blazing downloading and will be completed in less than 2 mins"
