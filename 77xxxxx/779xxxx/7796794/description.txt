The second volume in the Seven Brothers series. First, they were strangers. Individuals from all across the globe linked by an unlikely destiny and an unknown blood tie. Now, they're a family. And like all families, they've got their issues. So when a mysterious figure from a past Rachel Kai thought she put behind her comes gunning for all their blood, the 7 Brothers must join forces once again to save the life of one of their own! Written by Benjamin Raab and Deric A. Hughes (writers on the television show, Warehouse 13), and with pencils by Edison George (Silver Scorpion, Eternity Kill), this next chapter in the saga of an unlikely band of brothers charts a bold new course for these heroes that promises to thrill fans both old and new!
