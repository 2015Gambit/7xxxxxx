R.E.D.
Target Deluxe Edition (2012)





R.E.D. (as in "realizing every dream") is Ne-Yo's fifth album and first for Motown -- a revitalized label that, earlier in the year, named the artist its Senior Vice President of A&R. It also follows Ne-Yo's featured appearances on two of the year's biggest radio hits, Pitbull's "Give Me Everything" and Young Jeezy's "Leave You Alone." The album's "Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)" features songwriting input from Sia Furler, while Ne-Yo's Compound Entertainment associates Phatboiz, fresh from their work on Miguel's Kaleidoscope Dream, chip in with some productions. Ne-Yo continues to embrace dance-pop while maintaining his connection to R&B.
