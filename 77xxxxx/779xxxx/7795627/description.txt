Description:
Dragon's Lore has several game modes. "Story" tells a tale about a quest of the dragon Kirin. You'll gradually pass through levels with different tasks, compete with bosses and upgrade your hero. "Classic" and "Arcade" games give you a pack of levels in which you must remove a number of cubes in a very short time, or play without time limits. "Puzzle" mode forces you to think hard about the best solution for different riddles in this mode. "Infinity" mode allows you to play as long as you wish, set outstanding high-scores until there are no possible moves.
