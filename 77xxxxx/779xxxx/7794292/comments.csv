[V],AUDI-A4,2012-11-05T17:52Z,you must try this version http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7795162/Cut_the_Rope_Online_Installer___Crack_Full[A4] i will try to upload installer version as my possible 
,furice26,2012-11-06T05:46Z,the game is in fast forward
,AirWaysMan,2012-11-10T10:49Z,AUDI-A4.. This version is not working for me. I think this installer wont work like this. Then I tried the online installer with your crack and worked but when I copied that working installed game from Desktop to pc its not working so looks like every time I want to install it somewhere I have to use the online installer it will be great if someone can upload the standalone installer.
