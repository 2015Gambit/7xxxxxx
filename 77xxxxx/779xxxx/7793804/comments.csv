,roadtrooper,2012-11-07T19:45Z,"I just had to comment on the ""Horse Power"" advert bellow..it's fucking crazy! I laughed my ass off..but really? It's a bit much,no? I'd like to hear peoples' opinions. I'm no prude,far from it..but this? Not that i could ever imagine being on this page whilst showing my grandmother some computer stuff,but the thought crossed my mind..what if? It would be horrible. I'm not a computer guy,i don't know this stuff,but there must be some kind of rules,no? Anyway,enough ranting,i have to go now..got to complete my order form for ""Horse Power+ XXXL Formula""! :)"
,roadtrooper,2012-11-07T19:56Z,Horse Power + XXXL Formula! That advert bellow makes me laugh and shocks me that it's allowed. Wow! Thank God my sweet granny hasn't progressed to downloading!
