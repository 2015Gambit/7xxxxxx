|There are no well established activation bypass as of yet, so I have not  |
|included them.                                                            |

|Either burn the included .iso file to a dvdr or use a usb flash drive.    |
|I have included diskpart instructions and the win7usb tool.               |

|I have personally tested every install on this ISO.  It should not        |
|require a setup key as there is a skip button, but if it does, I have     |
|included some default install keys.  I have not verified them as working. |
|Use them at your own risk. I tested a different language for each install.|
