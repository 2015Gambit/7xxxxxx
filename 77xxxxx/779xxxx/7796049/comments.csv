Comment on the show!

God damn, the last 3 episodes have just been BULLSHIT. We got howard talking shit on people for not being ""dependable"" during the storm, and then he defends himself for 3 hours over two episodes..... SO FUCKING BORING

And now we have him talking about his parents for OVER AN HOUR doing their voices, repeating same jokes, oh my fucking god its horrible I am sorry but its SO BAD LOL The last four shows have been the most boring I have ever heard.. >."
,Phillyjustice11,2012-11-06T15:03Z,Juice* I agree and then you have Robin freaking out because Doug Goodstein gives him a little shit OMG i couldnt take Robin. But thanks WUSH your the man
