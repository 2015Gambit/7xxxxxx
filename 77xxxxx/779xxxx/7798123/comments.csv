Considering your previous F1 releases, it seems that the 50fps versions are not of the live skysport broadcast i.e. replay. Which is approx 10mins shorter compared to the standard 720p 25fps live release. Isn't there any way to have a live 50fps record? I mean, size wise it aint a huge difference (quality is wayyy better and worth the xtra +GB). Just a suggestion - if its technically possible.

Btw - is this torrent a live or a replay record (I m only talking about the Race bit)

Cheers!"

,astigmatism,2012-11-06T20:09Z,footy you rock. I noticed others posting F1 coverage but I still wait for yours. It's always the best!
[V],footy,2012-11-07T02:07Z,"@x87: the original source is 1980*1080i, 25 fps, that is the way Sky broadcast it, it is deinterlaced to 50 fps

football fans - NO UCL matches of today, as i am at Veltins Arena, Schalke v Arsenal, it was a good match, fabulous atmosphere in the stadium"
,Bali2011,2012-11-07T12:48Z,Best quality. Thanks!
,JustAnotherApprentice,2012-11-07T16:10Z,"Hey Footy,
I was wondering if you would be able to upload the Chelsea match today.Also,if you could do it on avi or mp4,due to my tv  and videogame media center limitations.My Sony tv doesn't support mkv (which makes me very sad),even though it displays high definition mp4 files just fine ,and my old xbox cannot render some mkv 720p files (hardware limitation).Anyway,the way you do it,when you do it,no matter the match,I'll still be thankful the same way.You really rock!"
,frostbite88,2012-11-07T16:17Z,seed peeps
,keif8,2012-11-07T16:26Z,Pre-race and race are glitching for me. :(  Haven't checked the others.
