About a year ago, someone had started making desktop and folder icons based on all of DC's New 52 comics.  I never really saw an update since then, but I did find a few more floating around the net.

Well, I decided to update the file of icons for everyone!  The originals (included herein) were 512x512 to keep Mac users happy, but as a PC guy myself, I only created files in the updates that are 256x256.  Sorry, Mac guys!

Anyway, I've included all the original files and what updates I found and added icons from Waves 2 and 3, the miniseries since the launch of the New 52, the Digital First titles, new DC logos, and even a couple of the DC Nation titles.

Enjoy!
