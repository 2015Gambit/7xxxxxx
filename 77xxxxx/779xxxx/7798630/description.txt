"The Buggles were a British New Wave duo consisting of Trevor Horn (vocals, bass guitar, guitar) and Geoff Downes (keyboards). They are best known for their 1979 debut single "Video Killed the Radio Star" that was No. 1 on the singles charts of sixteen countries. Its music video was the first to be shown on MTV in the U.S. at 12:01 on 1 August 1981. It was the lead single of the Buggles' first album, The Age of Plastic, whose title song became the group's second hit single, reaching No. 16 in the UK. Shortly after Downes' move to the band Asia and the failure of their second album, Adventures in Modern Recording, the group came to an end in 1981. However, Downes and Horn have been performing Buggles' songs together since 1998."
