Robot Chicken - Season 6 - Episode 8 (WEB-DL - MP4)
---------------------------------------------------

Robot Chicken is back for its Sixth Season of hilariously insane, wackadoodle,
totally off the wall stop-motion animation! This season's 20 brand spankin' new
episodes will flash images across your retinas and flood your brains with an
overabundance of mind-melting pop culture spoofery that will most likely cause
your head to explode and leave a stain on the couch that will never come out (sorry Mom)!

Produced by Williams Street, ShadowMachine, Sony Pictures and Stoopid Monkey.

Robot Chicken dreams up a TV theme song that just keeps going and going;
The Robot Chicken Nerd joins Team Fortress; She-Ra knows what it feels
like to be her horse, Swift Wind; We show you Skeletor's new plan
to take over Eternia.
