      After surviving the COBRA factory explosion, the team must track a Bio-Viper that    
      escaped the blast before it destroys the nearby town of Springfield. However, the    
      team are framed for the explosion and are now known as the "Renegades" by the media, 
      but when asked who they really are by residents, Duke responds "We're just ordinary  
      Joes sir."
