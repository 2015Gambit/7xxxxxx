Another $60,000 dollar education. Here's the Bachelors of Game Art and Design. Why such a small footprint? They're all text files. You read that right. Students who attend the art institute online are not trained or mentored. They must read "Online lectures" and books freely available from the local bookstore to learn very technical concepts. Is it any wonder why no company will hire someone who attended this "school"?

If you know anyone who's ever wanted to attend, give them this file and save them the pain and anguish of getting into unmanageable debt for a rip-off "education".
