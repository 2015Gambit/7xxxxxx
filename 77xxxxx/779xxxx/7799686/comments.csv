,AiSucks,2012-11-07T01:05Z,"I encourage anyone who has the other classes to compile them with this collection and redistribute into a new torrent. Let's work together in helping protect others from these greedy bastards who are more interested in the bottom line than to truly prepare students into the highly competitive field of art, design, and animation."

I don't have access to the later classes, that's why I'm depending on others to 'complete' this torrent. Fortunately, I think it's only 2 or 3 classes."

However I love artificial intelligence =)

In any case I welcome the openness of learning which I believe it is the best way for progress :)"
