The ocarina is an ancient instrument, dating back over 12,000 years. This one, nicknamed "Amaya" (meaning "light rain"), has a pure tone that will bring you straight to the mountains of Hyrule. Amaya is a true legato instrument, the first of its kind, and it was obsessively crafted. We're talking Round Robin legato performances baby! 2X RR legato plus 2X RR portamentos, with an additional option to bump up the variation with RR neighbor borrowing. That means more variation for you!
