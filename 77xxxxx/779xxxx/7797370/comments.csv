,Cataclysmiae,2012-11-06T12:36Z,"Dude, I made a TPB account literally just to write you this message. You are an absolute legend. Please never ever stop what you're doing. Not only have you had every single new EDM track that I've ever wanted on the day of its release, you've also introduced me to so much amazing new music as well.

I do not have a bookmark to TPB on my shortcut bar, I have a bookmark to your profile so I can straight up see what sick ass fuckin torrents you've uploaded. 

Thanks dude, this is definitely going to be my EP of the year and it's all because of you! Much love "
