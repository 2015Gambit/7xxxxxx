Filters are used in many industries, especially the water,sewage,oil, gas, food and beverage, and pharmaceutical industries. This new edition of a well-established title retains the aim of being a practical account of filtration equipment and its applications. The previous edition is badly out of date, and Ken Sutherland has completely revised and re-written it, changing emphasis and content wherever necessary. It remains an essential book for the engineer working in a plant situation, who requires guidance and information on what is available and whether it is suitable for the job in hand.
