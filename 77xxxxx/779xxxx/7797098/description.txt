Chuck's continued investigation into his

so they aren't surprised by anything, but
neither was prepared for what they
uncovered. With The Spectator in jeopardy
after Dan decided to publish elsewhere,
Nate must make a difficult decision to keep
it in business. Meanwhile, Georgina pushes
Dan to choose a worthy person to date to
boost his image, but he finds himself drawn
in a different direction
