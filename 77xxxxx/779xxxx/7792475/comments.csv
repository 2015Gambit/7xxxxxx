,studog123,2012-11-05T00:52Z,"Another great collection. Any chance of getting the new David Phelps - Classic at some point, I have been waiting for that one."
,Phaedron,2012-11-05T07:55Z,Thanks again and as always keep up the good work!
,studog123,2012-11-05T14:32Z,i found some older torrents you did that do not appear to have seeders any longer. any chance to reseed them. They are 3 for 1 & Kirk Talley. I would really appreciate them.
,transkaro,2012-11-07T17:03Z,"Hey TT, First would like to thank you for your input in these torrents, much appreciated. . . I do longdistance trucking for a life so for me to attend a church service or just fellowship is almost a zero, but thanks to your input i can atleast listern to these ""audio sermons"" as i like to call it. It makes the road so much better. . Do you have anything on Geoff Bullock and Lindell Cooley perhaps, two of the greatest praise and worship pioneers . . ."
,roro1979,2012-11-09T07:21Z,Do you have any Melissa Otto?
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-11-09T16:18Z,"Transkaro, although obviously not on the same level as you do professionally, I too do a lot of driving. So I can appreciate that alone time with the Lord. I didn't have any Geoff Bullock, but I had four Lindell Cooley albums I put up for you yesterday."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-11-09T16:18Z,"Roro1979, I'm afraid I don't have any Melissa Otto in my collection.  Sorry about that."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-11-09T16:20Z,"Studog123, I'm not a big fan of going back and breathing new life into my old torrents. It defeats the very purpose of a torrent in the first place. But if you can't get any seeders on those two discographies after a week or so, please let me know."
