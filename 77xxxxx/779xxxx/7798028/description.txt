Along Came A Spider is an upcoming Metalcore from Cleveland, Ohio. "If We Were Normal Men" is their debut album released on October 30th, 2012.

I had a listen to this album and it's actually pretty good, definitely takes a new take on the Metalcore genre unlike a lot of these upcoming metalcore bands these days who just seem to copy Asking Alexandria etc. etc.

Don't get me wrong they still have some generic metalcore tracks with some heavy breakdowns and some sick riffs.

Tracklist:

1.	Inside the Kill Room
2.	Those Were the Droids
3.	Vampire Robot Barbie Dolls
4.	Blood, Sweat and Member Changes
5.	The Ballad of Danny Greene
6.	F.A.A.D.
7.	Everyone Gets One
8.	Relapse on Tylenol
9.	I'm Your Huckleberry
10	A Day in the Life of a Ginger
11.	I'm the Best There Is At What I Do
12.	Captain Clumsy Pants and the Epic Fail Brigade

So this is a 320 kbps CD quality download, but if you like what you hear go like the band on facebook, twitter etc. and buy the album on iTunes, 

Enjoy :)
