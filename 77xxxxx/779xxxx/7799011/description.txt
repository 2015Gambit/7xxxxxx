Slhoka is a fighter pilot with a special mission in life that gradually becomes clear as he and his comrade crash on a forgotten island on the world of Link-Archoïde, where man and nature live in harmonious balance.  There, among other things, he meets Leidjill, a beautiful girl of The Golden People who possess exceptional gifts and ideas.  It's a chance meeting that will change Slhoka's life dramatically and for the better...

Slhoka discovers that there is more between heaven and Earth than he ever suspected when Leidjill summons Shani, the Spirit of Vengeance, through a sacred Opal stone.  Shortly thereafter Slhoka finds unsuspected forces at his disposal and it's clear that there's no way back for him.  Not that he realises it yet; that he, Slhoka, is the Chosen One, the peacemaker who'll play a decisive role in the outcome of the perpetual struggle between Okrane and Zeïde.
