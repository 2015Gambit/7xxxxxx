Sounds like I'm listening to this through a hollow pipe.  Thanks though."
,Polymathj,2012-11-06T05:47Z,"Yeah, I've downloaded this and another with bad audio.  Tinny and hollow."
,jdoe666,2012-11-06T06:06Z,Freaking password protected -.- made me loose 1 freaking hour downloading to then go get the freaking PASSWORD. NOT WORTH THE TIME!
,trace535,2012-11-06T06:07Z,"Audio is shit! How did this get uploaded to TPB?

Get the PROPER release!"
,firexninja,2012-11-06T07:01Z,thank  you!
,calvinso,2012-11-06T07:39Z,woah! robot voice....not cool
,fejop,2012-11-06T08:12Z,"Absolutely nothing wrong with the sound, just yet another awesome upload!

It's also obviously not password protected, it's just a single mp4 file. Wow why do all these trolls even bother posting?

Thanks again!"
,ta2jean,2012-11-06T09:31Z,Not password locked but I have the same tinny audio. :/
,PhoenixShadow,2012-11-06T15:04Z,"Yep, bad audio."
,moonerman100,2012-11-06T16:04Z,Very bad audio!
,steaz55,2012-11-06T16:59Z,"What a rip off from Friends:

Victoria to Ted: ""You are not allowed to see Robin anymore""

Emily to Ross (Friends, season 5): ""You are not allowed to see Rachel anymore""

You realize its the same producer right?"
,Herxzo,2012-11-06T19:44Z,The sound is very bad for some reason.
,endofline-kingmax,2012-11-07T13:06Z,@jdoe666  stfu troller .VTV always give passwordless and torjanless torrents.
,kka401,2012-11-08T09:12Z,"Ok, so the audio isn't the best it could be but it is no where near as bad as people are making it out to be...barely even noticable"
,Xxii-AMD-iixX,2012-11-08T11:46Z,"wow i was actually worried when i saw the comments but as kka401 the difference is barely even noticable...
thnx vtv another great release"
,94beve63,2012-11-10T23:05Z,"Thank you!

Why did CBS have such long break between episode 4 and 5?"
,sabre0121,2012-11-13T19:26Z,"@steaz55 Fuck you, you fucking spoiling piece of shit, I hope your mother dies in fire..."
,blugoo,2012-11-14T00:34Z,Thx for the comments about file quality.
,Imnomonster,2012-11-15T22:57Z,"I downloaded the ""PROPER"" release first. It required me to be connected to the internet to watch it. Now that I've seen all of these troll comments, I'm really suspicious of it. I've already watched the rest of this season's episodes released by VTV, so I know what to expect quality wise.
