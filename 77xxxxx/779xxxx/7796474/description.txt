        ============================
        What's New in TRAKTOR 2.6.0
        ============================
          
          KEY FEATURES :
      - Integration of TRAKTOR KONTROL Z2
      - Macro FX: 11 new "combination effects" which are controllable
        from a single knob. When using the update installer of TRAKTOR
        2.6.0, new Macro FX can be added to the list of available FX
        by importing the following TSI:
        [USER]/Documents/Native Instruments/Traktor 2.6.0/Settings/
        Default Settings/Effects/Macro FX.tsi
      - Flux Mode: allows various transport actions (jumping to HotCues,
        performing Beatjumps, and creating Loops) to be used while
        preserving the original progression of the track
      
         CONTROLLER MANAGER :
      - Factory Map Override: It's now possible to change the behavior
        of only specific controls in a hard-coded mapping (such as the
        KONTROL S4/S2 or Z2) by overriding their default behaviors. The
        option shows up in the "Mapping Details" section of Controller
        Manager only when it's available.
      
         EFFECTS :
      - FX Units can now be configured for Post-Fader operation in
        Internal Mixing mode. For External Mixing mode, the Post-Fader
        option will put the FX Unit last in the signal chain before
        being output from the audio interface
      
         LIVE INPUT DECK :
      - Minor gain-staging adjustments for Live Input Deck 
	  
         MIXER :
		
      - New "Z ISO" EQ type which is full kill at the left end of knobs
        path 
      - New "Z" filter type
      - "QuickSnap" behavior for the EQ and Filter controls: Hold the
        SHIFT button on your hardware controller and move the EQ/Filter
        knobs. The positions of the knobs in the software will not be 
        updated until the SHIFT button is released. This allows for 
        instantaneous EQ and Filter cuts.
      - New gain system with independent Channel Gain and Auto-Gain
        knobs. The button next to the Gain knob is used to switch the
        view of the knob between Gain and the Auto-Gain value for the
        track. When the button is blue, you're viewing the gain for the
        channel. Clicking the button to turn it orange makes the knob
        display the track's Auto-Gain level. Changes made to the
        Auto-Gain amount can be heard immediately and are automatically
        saved to the track. Channel Gain can now be mapped to an
        absolute knob without worry of takeover issues. NOTE: if you've
        disabled the "Set Autogain when Loading Track" preference, then
        do not use the Auto-Gain view. Adjusting this knob while the
        preference is off will end up overwriting the track's Auto-Gain
        value.
      
         SYNC :
      - A new Transport Preference preventing Remix Decks from becoming
        Tempo Master
      - New Transport Preference allowing only On-Air Decks to become
        Tempo Master. Turning preference off will no longer cause the
        Tempo Master to switch when manipulating mixer controls.
      
         TRAKTOR KONTROL Z2 :
      - The Deck Focus Select buttons (buttons C and A on the left side
        and buttons B and D on the right side, just above the HotCue
        Pads) no longer require the use of the SHIFT key to enter the
        Secondary Mode. If a button is already on and lit solid, this
        indicates Primary Mode for the HotCue pads. Pressing the same
        button again will engage Secondary Mode for the pad, which can
        be seen by the button's backlight fading on and off. Pressing
        the same button again will revert the pads back to Primary Mode.
      
         THIRD PARTY CONTROLLERS :
      - Advanced HID support for the Pioneer CDJ-2000nexus (SLIP button
        being mapped to Flux mode)
