Higher Earth #6
Publisher:  Boom Studios
Publication Date:  October 31, 2012

You Are Illegal On This Earth. Space is dead. Why conquer other planets when there's a perfectly good Earth in the universe next door? Heidi, a girl born in garbage. Rex, a soldier gone rogue. The only thing between them and their destiny is an empire of a hundred different Earths, across a hundred alternate timelines. One majestic planet dominates them all: Higher Earth. Created and written by Sam Humphries (Fanboys Vs. Zombies) Higher Earth is his sci-fi follow up to indie hit Our Love Is Real, a fast-paced epic of infinite possibilities. 

With no one to trust, not even each other, Rex and Heidi must find a way to work together as the agents of Higher Earth come ever closer...
