I have these with outline and audio (unless otherwise designated):
Flemings Civil Procedure I
Flemings Civil Procedure II
Flemings Constitutional Law I
Flemings Contracts I (Outline Only)
Flemings Contracts II
Flemings Corporations
Flemings Criminal Law
Flemings Evidence
Flemings Torts I
Flemings Torts II

I need:
Flemings Agency and Partnership
Flemings Constitutional Law II

That's it.. If you guys got one of these, post it on torrents. Alternatively, if you buy one of the above and upload it. In either case, I'll upload 4 Flemings of your choice for each one. Lets get this stuff on the web guys!"
,doe9975,2012-11-05T19:27Z,"Thank you! These are great contributions, if I come across any that you requested, will upload"
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-07T00:03Z,"No prob, if anyone has:
Flemings Constitutional Law II

Hook it up. I don't really want agency anymore. I'll upload everything for Con Law II so if your going to buy something buy Con Law II and upload and I'll upload the rest of the 1L material I got."
,will409,2012-11-18T03:40Z,"a sample of con law 2 is over on kick ass 
have a nice day. "
,RilesObrien,2012-11-18T06:16Z,"hi there, i believe there's a sample over on kick ass under ""con law 2"". you should check it out."
,will409,2012-11-20T03:52Z,"I'll give you one last opportunity to even respond. If you want constitutional law 2 by flemings please leave a message here. Otherwise I will move on. All I ask for is civil procedure 2. My torrents or over at kick ass. Please respond by this week.
Have a nice day. "
,torrentb,2012-11-25T00:37Z,"Ms.HaL, do you still need Con 2? I am willing to upload it (as well as will409, apparently). Please let me know if you still need it."
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-25T22:49Z,"Yeah, I'm still here. Upload it and link and I'll post the entire rest of the series (minus property and K1 audio, just have outline for that)"
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-25T22:52Z,"I responded buddy its just I'm not on here every day. Finals, ya know? But now that I know your uploading I'll leave this tab and the other upload for civ pro open and upload the rest once you get me con law ii."
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-25T22:59Z,"I just saw the kickass sample, no seeders. And why post sample? I already posted these 2 torrents, I'm obviously good for it -- I swear to be sure to upload civ pro ii before anything else. See what I listed? I legit have all those. I don't have property cuz my prof for property taught it weird. K1, I only have outline, no audio because someones tutor gave it to him who gave it to me and I scanned it to have backup."
,will409,2012-11-26T00:04Z,"The whole thing is up now. 

Piratebay won't allow a link from kick ass so look up Constitutional Law 2

This will only be up temporarily-- Ms.H9
I now wait for Civil Procedure 2.
I hope you are a person of your word. "
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-26T05:39Z,I dled it but it won't unzip. I think its missing a volume or something. I see folder.zip.001-017 but I think there needs to be folder.zip as well. Why did you break it into 17 volumes anyways? Let me know how to extract because I get error.
,will409,2012-11-26T09:53Z,"Do you have 7zip?
I use 7zip all the time.
Just right click any volume and open archive.
Then you should be able to extract the folder within.
Try 7zip it is that simple."

,will409,2012-11-26T20:16Z,"I understand you are busy and everything but please let me know what's going on?
Were you able to extract the file?
When will civil pro 2 be up?
Please let me know."
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-27T05:04Z,"Never used that before but it worked. Thanks. I will upload tomorrow and post link here. Thanks again Will, check back here tomorrow it will be up before 7 PM PST."
,torrentb,2012-11-27T13:47Z,"Ms.HaL, if you could also upload Torts II, I would be greatly appreciative. Thank you."
,will409,2012-11-28T06:12Z,Well it's 9:10 PM. What happened?
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-28T08:19Z,"My bad, tomorrow, by 7, serious dude. I broke a promise but I'll get it up. Do you have a civ pro 2 final or something? In any case, tomorrow for sure."
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-28T08:26Z,"7pm, you know finals crazy"
