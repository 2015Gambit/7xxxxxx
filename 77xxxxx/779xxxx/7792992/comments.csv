,Uploadm1n,2012-11-05T07:54Z,"@karina602

Guessing you live in phx XD 

First, you need a modded xbox, craigslist it have it done for 40$ Then go to frys electrnoics, get a iHas series Liteon DVD burner, if your using PC you will not need a sata to USB connector, if your using a laptop you will to hook it up to the laptop. This will not burn right on any other burner, they are 30$ and the sata connection cable is 20-30$

Download it torrent, Download imgburn, put in a DL dvdr not just a regular DVD R, it has to be Dual  Layer, then burn as trinucate, then wait. put in xbox and anjoy. Without it being modded, you can't DL this and play the game. "
,Uploadm1n,2012-11-05T09:30Z,"I hope all of you have some type of IP blocker on, or a proxy because this DL is not pretty, but its a great DL. Thank you Noob"
,tech402,2012-11-05T10:41Z,"here is how to burn everyone!!!

obviously you need a modded xbox.

Buy a Lite-On iHas burner (its an external drive) look it up online, it must, MUST be a ""b"" model. if you dont know then call customer service of whichever website has it and ask them.
You must connect that external drive to your pc, laptop or mac so you need a ""Sata to Usb cables"" these cable power the external drive and connect it your pc, laptop or mac.
Then you need to download ABGX and Imgburner.
Then download the torrent game.... Once downloaded open the folder and take out the .iso file and put it into a new folder. (to avoid confusion)
open abgx set a few settings on it (go to youtube and look up Best abgx setting for xgd3) once you run the game through it, itll create a .dvd file. open IMGburn and select the .dvd file.
and also select you ihas burner to burn it.
YOU NEED TO USE VERBATIM 2.4X DUAL LAYER DVD+R BLANKS. NO IFS ANDS OR BUTS BITCHES! if you need help comment me here, if i somehow come to this post again ill answer"

Just keep in mind that doing so disables all settings that dashlaunch has set. So that means no ping patch and not live block. Make sure you either take your console offline or w/e you need to do otherwise you'll be instabanned. Microsoft isn't playing around after the leaking of Halo 4 and a couple other games."

In xexmenu press right button RB untill you see ""Freestyle"" folder and on the top youll see Dashlaunch folder.Enter it and run default.xex (this will start dashlaunch GUI where you can unload it.

In Dashlaunch press twice right button RN untill you see ""unload Dashlaunc in the menu.After that press ""B"" (red button or just go to quit.

This will bring you to the METRO dash and its possible youll be prompted for an update..DONT update.

Run the game here and it will work.

What do I need to do to my xbox? Anything?  I will not be connecting it to the internet while I'm playing it.  But this is the xbox I'm on LIVE with all the time.
,dunit80,2012-11-07T22:03Z,"@drey4184 If it was as simple as just downloading a file and putting it on a flash drive dont you think everyone would be downloading games. It doesnt work like that. And if you are trying to mod your console on your own, you have to be pretty damn good at pulling it apart and hooking it up to a computer and flashing the firmware. Its not as simple as it sounds. Your best option is to get on Craigslist and find someone in your area that will either flash your firmware or do an RGH mod on it which will allow you to play games right off of a hard drive. But you still have to know how to either burn the games properly, or extract the games using Xbox Image Browser. This is not the place to learn. Just google it and there are plenty of guides out there. But go to a professional and have them do it. Most will only charge you $20 to flash, and $40-50 to do a RGH hack on it."
,dunit80,2012-11-07T22:05Z,"@wakymaky it took me almost 3 full days to download the game. Im always generous and set my upload speed to unlimited to seed.

,dunit80,2012-11-08T03:11Z,"@smallz94 Im going to have to say this is probably one of the worst COD games I have ever played. And Ive been playing them ever since the original ones that were set in WW2.  I dont like how theyve changed up the game. Its kind of like a cross between COD and Ghost Recon. While I love the missions that are set in the past like Afghanistan and the one with Noriega. I hate almost every mission set in the future. And those stupid strikeforce missions where you have to command 2 squads, the turret and the walking armored robot and defend 4 different areas at one time are ridiculous. Luckily the game gives you the option to play them or not. You only have to play the first one and if you lose it you can keep going on with the game. From what Ive been told though, that not playing the strikeforce missions can affect the outcome of the game. They are almost impossible on Veteran difficulty, though i have not tried them on any of the lesser difficulties. I have been waiting months for this release and have to say that I am quite disappointed with the outcome of it.  Oh well. I hope they do a better job when Rainbow Six Patriots comes out, because that is still my favorite FPS of all time. Used to love playing Rainbow Six 3 on the original Xbox on Live. Had some of the best maps on that game. And I hope COD goes back to its roots some time and sets another game during the WWII period. Nothing like killing some fucking Nazis!!"

and

@rsd0630  are you playing the game on a burned disc or an RGH console. If an RGH console read the previous replies. You need to open up Dashlaunch, then go to the misc. menu. click uninstall which just removes the dashlaunch from the flash on your system. Then click on launch and open the game. I had same problem you did, and after I did that Ive been playing the game ever since."

,Uploadm1n,2012-11-14T20:21Z,"DISK AUTHORIZATION FAILED FIX

HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO!

1. Burn a Truncated disc of the copy BO2
2. Install the Truncated disc on the 360
3. Throw the Truncated disc away or erase it
4.Now burn a disk with Burnmax firmware on the iHas ASUS Drive.
5. Play disc that burnt was with burnmax firmware. ENJOY

The reason we are burning the truncated disk on the 360 is because with the burnmax disk sometimes the disk wont install on Xbox, stops, many reasons. Truncate is easy to read on the Xbox's. I know that is retarded but it just works. The reason you can't play on the truncated disk is because CIV security checks thus what gives you authorized disc error.

I am sure you ran abgx before hand but do it again on level 3. If it is asking you to overburn or truncate then you did not flash your drive with burnmax. Google burnmax it will show first thing. 

I think this is the first time my fix has been posted so please shout it out if you see someone getting the error as well.

IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT DISK YOU USE. I PREFER SONY'S DVD+R DL,  WITH ACCUCORE SO IF THEY MESS UP I CAN ERASE IT AND REDO IT. THEY ARE RANKED HIGHER THEN VERB'S.

I've been gaming for 15 years on Consoles and PC and i'm pretty confident that i know rubbish when i see it.

I have not played any of the COD games and saw all of the hype about this, so i downloaded it to give it a good play and a chance to impress me.

The graphics in this game take me back to the days of the PlayStation 1 and the Original Xbox.

Very bland and generic FPS game and really glad i didn't pay a cent for it !!!

Don't believe the marketing hype about games - thank goodness we have the opportunity to try before we buy ( if that is your Modus Operandi )

If you are looking for a great game try Dead Space 2 if you haven't played it yet :) the most fun iv'e had being scared !!

Have fun guys and save your bandwidth and consider before downloading this Crap !!! Also Google some of the COD forums for feedback from other players that feel the same way about this game.

Peace !

,77yakuza77,2012-11-17T14:35Z,"Sorry Uploadmin, this method did not work for me either :( 
Burned the 2 discs (truncated and full) with IHas, LT3... But no, impossible to play...
Waiting for a ""fully DVD working""solution without xKey..."
,roryrudy,2012-11-17T15:09Z,"Initially, I installed it to my hard drive 100% success before my first play..after doing so, I get the unrecognized error and the xbox resets, very frequent. 

Then I deleted it from my hard drive and I have never seen the error again...idk y..I play it online everyday since and currently halfway through the campaign. 

Btw FYI: Verbatim (truncated)...no ihas drive whatsoever"

,mke_tze,2012-11-18T15:54Z,"I dont see why the hell so many dumbass'es are commenting on this torrent and saying its a bad upload. If you have a modded xbox and use verbatim disc, and actaully know what you are doing. then the game works perfectly! all you cheap fucks complaining that it doesnt work, stop bitching if you are using cheap media like memorex, or ANYTHING other then verbatim dvd+r dl Disc. end of story. i repeat again. THIS TORRENT WORKS PERFCECT IF YOU BURN WITH VERBATIM DISC. dont read into all the other dumbass'es saying its a bad torrent."
,MA1D3N666,2012-11-18T19:11Z,All I use are verbatims and still no go. I burned this for a friend and he had the same problem. Works for a bit then game unreadable error. Apparently the fix is to just install the game to drive which is what I read on some forums too.
,VisciusK,2012-11-18T19:40Z,"I have my console glitched, I'm using freestyle 3 and the CoDBO 2 freeze when I tried to play, freeze in Campayn or Multiplayer or Zombie mode, but y check updates and there are 2 of them, I apply the update 2 and now is working, I don't know how the users LT can apply updates but for me now is working."

,77yakuza77,2012-11-19T11:01Z,"@french people : prenez cette version qui est en anglais, si vous avez des ""disques illisibles"" en gravant la version FR qui est sur t411.me

J'ai perdu 4 DVD Verbatim sur la FR, sur cet iso une gravure, installé sur HD, jouable !

Mais bon il faut parler anglais, ou aimer tirer sur des méchants sans comprendre l'histoire ^_^
(c'est pas dur : les méchants, c'est ceux qui vous attaquent !)"
