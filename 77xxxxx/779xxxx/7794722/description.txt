Dexter, Season 07, Episode 06 - "Do the Wrong Thing" (11/4/2012)




Enjoy, guys. Also, if you can take the time to help out victims of Hurricane Sandy, please do so. We really need your help, especially in New York state. We are devastated and most of us still do not have power, food, shelter, or water. I'm lucky to have had my power return earlier today after losing it Sunday night/Monday morning. Some releases may be slow as I am going to help a lot with the recovery. Whatever it is you can do, please do. 

We're aiming to help the communities in New Jersey, New York, and other places horribly affected by this catastrophe nearby. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is doing a fantastic job for his state though, so New York needs your help, especially from imbeciles like New York's Mayor Bloomberg.
