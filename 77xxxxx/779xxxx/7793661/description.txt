The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 04 Nov 2012

[sebaygo1]

The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On this Sunday, November 4th edition, Alex Jones breaks down the latest news leading into a hot election cycle, as well as the latest developments on Hurricane Sandy, which has left millions of people without electricity and FEMA a new excuse to grab power. With the 2012 election just two days away, the polls are too close to call, but various politicos are arguing why they think Barack Obama or Mitt Romney will pull ahead. Either outcome is guaranteed to be continued business as usual, for the pro-war, pro-bailout, pro-GMO candidates, even as fresh signs indicate a possible strike on Iran and other geopolitical conflict in the Middle East. Alex welcomes your calls as he cuts through the rhetoric of an election with plenty of room for error, fraud and surprise.
