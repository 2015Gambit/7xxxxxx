,sigge68,2012-11-09T20:21Z,Anyone else having problem to unpack this? Have about 30 i cant unpack :(
,gravaxfun,2012-11-10T17:44Z,"Actually @sigge68, if you told us which files you can't uncompress... I had no problems with the ones I tried to decompress... but I didn't do them all. Give us a name of file that you can't uncompress and I'll try."
,sigge68,2012-11-11T08:50Z,"ok it is nr 6010,6035,6037,6038,6039,6044,6045,6050,6052,6053,6058,6069,6070,6074,6078,6079,6080,6081 and 6083-6100"
,toddy_adt,2012-11-11T14:47Z,"@sigge68

All Roms were previously tested and uncompressed and compressed in 7z even before I launch the torrent
And after your comment refills again all tests I mentioned above and nothing was found errors.
Use the program http://www.7-zip.org/download.html
Make sure your torrent has been 100% completed"
,gravaxfun,2012-11-11T17:13Z,"@sigge68 I had no problem decompressing 6010, 6080 and 6081. Didn't test them all... but I use 7Zip...

@toddy_adt there is a bug. Diamond trust is in an archive called ""6080 - Diamond..."" it should be ""6082 - Diamond..."" since Diamond Trust is number 6082. Nothing bad, but just confusing."
,toddy_adt,2012-11-11T19:18Z,"@sigge68

This is not a mistake when he had been compacted compression number 6080, plus it is numbered in 6082, to solve this is only
Rename it to 6080 - Diamond Trust of London (U) (iND).7z To 6082 - Diamond Trust of London (U) (iND).7z
And Thank you for not realizing just Alert me when compaction before the release torrent"
,toddy_adt,2012-11-11T19:50Z,"@gravaxfun

Thanks for the warning, I'm here if you need."
,toddy_adt,2012-11-11T20:04Z,"Hello guys, there was an error in the numbering of ROMs

(Error) 6080 - Diamond Trust of London (U) (iND).7z

(Correction) 6082 - Diamond Trust of London (U) (iND).7z


This error is only in compression Within the files is correct numbering with 6082.


Rename it to

6080 - Diamond Trust of London (U) (iND).7z

to

6082 - Diamond Trust of London (U) (iND).7z


@gravaxfun

Thanks for the warning"
,sigge68,2012-11-11T20:15Z,ok tried 7 zip now instead of winrar and everyone worked :) thanks for the tip!!
,gravaxfun,2012-11-13T21:05Z,"Now we want 6101 - 6200. :D

Kidding. Thanks! We'll be patient."
