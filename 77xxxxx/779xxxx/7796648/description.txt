Youngblood v3
Publisher:  Awesome Entertainment
Publication Date:  February - March 1998

Eclectic author Alan Moore works with the remenants of the short-lived Awesome comics/ Image comics series Youngblood with its latter characters to create a more sophisticated and surreal teen hero series in two incompleted issues in the city of Omegopolis. Scrapping most teen angst for metafictional adventures, the Youngblood crew are as perplexed with their reality as the company they keep and fight.
