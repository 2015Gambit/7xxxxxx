This application allows you to create game channels for your Wii to boot games via USB mass storage device. So you can run games directly from Wii's main menu without additional homebrew. Actually you don't need SD card to play games, you need it only to install channels. It's not my idea, there is already another software for it, but my one is very simple, easy to use and configurable. You don't need to search for opening.bnr, etc. It's fully automatic, actually it just runs another tools,
