I tested this, and the quality is good

what converter do u use?  I tried to convert the mp4 release myself, but the size I ended up with was huge.  

please convert other UK and Canada, AFG forgets these a lot"
[T],ajaxen94,2012-11-06T16:30Z,thank you as cindy25 said good quality@cindy25 try WINX Converter there is a free version and it's very good i set mine at 1000 video quality format Xvid and i also set the aspect ratio to 624x352 and use the high quality engine i get very good results and quite small files
,hello2006,2012-11-06T17:40Z,"Thanx a bunch, MP4SUX for your ULs!  This proves that avi-format still rules, why change a good thing?  :D  Keep it up and tallyhoo!"
,Feetback,2012-11-06T18:28Z,"Excellent job ""MP4SUX"" Thank you! Really love this T.V.Series, Appreciate Small files. keep eem coming :) "
,cindy25,2012-11-07T07:16Z,"I have used winx deluxe, and if the file is MP4 nonsense is 250-300 then the avi convert I get is ok, 300-350

but when the MP4 is too big, over 400 as with this one, I end up with 500 or larger.  "
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-07T12:28Z,"First, I start with a high quality source (720 or 1080) mkv or ts.
My theory is - encode a four pixel (720) box or a nine pixel box (1080) into 1 (360).
I use AVC (it's free) and fairly quick.
The trick is getting the frame rate right. 25 is always 25 (sensible Brits).
But 24 comes in several shades as does 30.
Officially 23.976 & 24 - unofficially 23.998 & 24.040
Officially 29.970 & 30 - unofficially 29.916-8

If you don't want to cope with anything but finished size - AGK or AutoGK is great.
Has to be TS, VOB or AVI.

You can turn an MP4 into avi via CC2AVI (check out MP4cam2AVI at sourceforge).

Honestly, I need all the competition I can muster.

[T],ajaxen94,2012-11-07T14:13Z,"@cindy25 my WINX is the version before the HD Deluxe 5.7.0.0. i bought that one online but cant get anymore updates because i changed my isp and have a different e-mail address,so being very annoyed i downloaded the deluxe version from here on TPB but it always converts with the sound out of sinc could be that i am in the UK and the converter uploader is not from the UK anyway i went back to using my older version so thank you to AVIGUY i will try your way to see if it's any better than mine3"
,mwalsher,2012-11-11T16:25Z,"Thanks a lot!

I missed last weeks episode (I forgot all about the show because it’s not listed in my FutonCritic listing since it won’t start in the US until next year). Worse, I’m almost out of bandwidth for this billing cycle, so I cannot afford to download a 350-400MB copy (and “legitimate” online viewing uses orders of magnitude more bandwidth than rips even on the lowest quality).

Cheers.

(Now I have to remember to tape the next episode tomorrow night.)"
