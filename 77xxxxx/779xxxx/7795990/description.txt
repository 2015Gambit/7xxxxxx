THis series, produced by Cisco expert Keith Barker, helps prepare you for the new 640-554 Cisco exam, and also prepares you to address many of the real world vulnerabilities you come across today.

Keith dives into the Cisco Configuration Professional (CCP), the latest GUI (Graphical User Interface) software which will help you manage your Cisco routers. Not only does this training focus on switch security and router security, it also explains and demonstrates how to configure the ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) firewall. Keith, author of the CCNA Security Cert guide, covers the material in a way that is thorough, fun and engaging.

Whether you're fairly new to the network security world, or you've been in it for a while and simply want to fill in the gaps and see how all the pieces can be integrated together to build a fortress of security using a defense in depth approach, this series is for you.
