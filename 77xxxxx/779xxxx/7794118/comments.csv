[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-11-06T19:11Z,"whaletail935, I enjoyed these quite a bit. For one, they're official translations, which really makes a big difference most of the time (and that's no slight to anybody doing unofficial translation, because those are very much appreciated, too - it's just that the official translations are done by professionals and often include consulting from the original author, which makes a different). Also, the style of art on the cover doesn't exactly match the interior. The interior art, to me, looks a lot like Kyle Baker's stuff, but with a good bit more realism in the mix. Great looking stuff."

[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-11-09T01:27Z,"You're most welcome, panbam. Glad you dig the ups. Turning some people on to books they wouldn't normally see everyday is exactly why I started doing this. And to be honest, I don't have the time. I'll probably be slowing down quite a bit in the very near future. There's still some things I want to get uploaded before then, though. So, back to it..."
