,AiSucks,2012-11-06T17:13Z,"I will be uploading what I have of the Game Art and Design Bachelors degree program soon. I wasn't able to finish the course but I invite anyone who has attended and does have these to fill in the gaps and share, share, share! The art institute fraudulently charges exhorbitant fees for their information that can easily be aquired online and presents it in an inferior manner. I am making these dox available for informational purposes as well as to provide proof of what would normally be considered a criminal act if we had any semblance of justice in the United States."
