,area4689,2012-11-05T08:31Z,"reaching 70% it'll say ""data is corrupted"" upon installing downgrader. im getting a feeling this is a fake"

,WinterGale,2012-11-05T12:11Z,"If I remember correctly, the original upgrade kit was more than 200mb. Are those simply download links?"
,dududus,2012-11-05T14:03Z,"This is for consoles 3.55 or below, or for those upgraded to CFW 4.21 or above. Not for OFW 3.56 or above.

Links all in package, working and tested. If they go down I will reupload."
,area4689,2012-11-05T22:27Z,now im on OFW 4.30. can i go to CFW 4.30 from here? then can i do any of this method? i have PS3 slim btw...
,fauzan18,2012-11-06T09:29Z,@area4689 you need ofw 3.55 or below to install any kind of custom firmware if you are above 3.55 then you need to downgrade by various hardware methods available but not all ps3's can be downgraded you will have to check if yours can be downgraded.
,dududus,2012-11-06T09:37Z,"If you are on OFW 4.30 you need to pay a modder to downgrade your console to 3.55. Then you can install this CFW.

Modding costs between $30-$80 depending where you live. The price of a game or two... damn well worth it. 

Reliable modders with good references can easily be found on ps3hax psx-scene ps3iso and other forums."
,dududus,2012-11-06T09:48Z,US$60 tops or 35 GBP or 50 EUR
,svenur83,2012-11-06T17:49Z,"hi. im on versjon 4.25 but when i try to install 
1 ROGERO 4.25 to 3.55 DOWNGRADER i get a error (data is corrupt). why please help"
,dududus,2012-11-06T21:38Z,"svenur83

you are on an OFW higher than 3.55

you need to get your ps3 modded"
,WinterGale,2012-11-07T14:12Z,"these are links to download sites for the actual downgrader, cfw, and multiman installers...why not upload the actual files not just links?"
,dududus,2012-11-07T18:10Z,"WinterGale

because i dont have a VPN"
,ECLIPSOX,2012-11-07T22:20Z,"the links in folders ""2 ROGERO 3.55 3.7"" and ""1 ROGERO 4.25 to 3.55 DOWNGRADER"" are the same. The file downloaded is ""4.25to3.55.rar"", please upload the link for the Rogero CFW3.55 v3.7"
