The Org superseded even the Nazi SS… In fact, Gehlen’s organization is largely credited for giving rise to the CIA…to shield Gehlen and the entire German Intelligence network from harm’s way. Gehlen was a ranking official in the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), which maintained inconceivable financial support and political influence… Somehow I wasn’t surprised to learn that financial motives…were at the heart of the SMOM and the Nazi-American alliance… Soon after the war, OSS [i.e., Office of Strategic Services – the forerunner to the CIA] found the extensive documentation of a meeting...between representatives of the [Nazi] SS…and firms like…I.G.

The ‘pirates of Wall Street’, Allen and John Foster Dulles, of the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, had secretly negotiated the alliance. It was not known to allied airmen, flying bombing missions over Germany, why the I.G. Farben plants, where Hitler’s munitions were made, were exempted from attack. Likewise, when the I.G. Farben – Rockefeller Consortium used concentration camp victims as slaves to build and run their factories it never made the news… Nor was it heralded that this same TEAM patented and sold the gas that the Nazis used in the concentration camps to send millions to their graves.

“The Jesuit Order at last reached the pinnacle of its power and prestige in the early eighteenth century [i.e., the early 1700s]. It had become more influential and more wealthy than any other organization in the world. It held a position in world affairs that no oath-bound group of men has ever held before or since… ‘Nearly all the Kings and Sovereigns of Europe had only Jesuits as directors of their consciences [i.e., as confessor-priests], so that the whole of Europe appeared to be governed by Jesuits only.’” (1927; using a short quote by Jesuit Cordara)

- James Parton (American historian)

“In Roman Catholic circles it is well known that the Black Pope is the term used for the [Superior] General of the Jesuits. As the Pope is always robed in white, and the [Jesuit Superior] General in black, the contrast is obvious. But those Romanists who do not greatly love the Jesuits, and their number is not limited, use the term as indicating that the Black Pope rules the White Pope…even while the former [i.e., the Black Pope] is obligated to make, at least, a show of submission to the latter.” (1896)
- M.F. Cusack (Ex-nun of Kenmore; author of the book The Black Pope)

“…The Jesuits are the only religious order in the Church of Rome…which has lain under the ban of the [‘White’] Pope, or which has been expelled from any country because of its interference in politics.

“The Jesuits…are simply the Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future, with the Pontiff of Rome for emperor…that’s their ideal. …It is simple lust of power, of filthy earthly gain, of domination – something like a universal serfdom with them [i.e., the Jesuits] as masters – that’s all they stand for.

This Jesuit war on the Vatican was terminated by the Congress of Vienna and by the secret, 1822 Treaty of Verona.”

- Emanuel M. Josephson (American physician and historian)

“Why would the Jesuits use their implacable enemy, the Jews, to further their designs for world dominion? The Jesuits never do anything out in the open where they can be exposed. If they are recognized as the culprits, they will be blamed and suffer the consequences, but if they can use someone else as the ‘cause of the world’s problems’, especially an enemy they can destroy in the process, then they have simultaneously accomplished two of their objectives. The Jewish people are the perfect scapegoat. Since the Rothschilds are Jesuit agents operating under a Jewish cover, using them [i.e., the Rothschilds] in forming the Illuminati back in 1776 effectively throws the onus of this conspiracy on the Jews. The Rothschilds are certainly not the only Jesuit agents that operate under a Jewish front.

“History books will tell us that the French Revolution first began in 1787 or 1789, depending on which book you read. However, it was actually planned by [Jesuit] Dr. Adam Weishaupt and the House of Rothschild almost 20 years before the Revolution took place.”

“[Jesuit Adam] Weishaupt established the [modern version of the] Illuminati specifically to be a front organization behind which the Jesuits could hide.

…The Monroe Doctrine challenged any advance on America by Europe. However, [President] Monroe did not really understand that the crafty Jesuits would not initially use the force of arms to gain their objectives. They [i.e., the Jesuits] would use cunning, craftiness, and utmost secrecy. They would appeal to men’s basest points. They would plant their agents in positions of wealth and power [Ed.

Their services unto the royalty were urged as a ‘need’, as they became assigned to hear the confessions of the aristocrats, emperors, kings, queens, princes, princesses, [‘royal’] mistresses, those in every level of government – they all revealed their secret plans, their intimate sins, their inner-most thoughts, as their lives became virtually an open book to the Jesuits.

…Through various means of diplomacy, Jesuits worked their way into offices of State, climbing up to be the counselors of kings, and shaping the policy of nations. But it was ‘religion’ and its sacred duties of hearing the confessions of their penitents, and being their religious ‘wise’ guides, that was the key to their success. Without the ‘need’ of a religious confessor, the history of the Jesuits may have been quite different. And the Jesuits made very sure that it was they who filled that need as confessors [Ed.

By using different disguises, aliases, and secret codes, to illegally slip in and out of England, Jesuit Robert Parson, in 1580, had led and then later organized a mission to bring other Jesuits into England to engage in a work of subversion.

When the [attempted] invasion [by the Spanish Armada] failed, these masters of intrigue [i.e., the Jesuits] turned to another bizarre scheme. Known in your encyclopedia under the subject, ‘The Gunpowder Plot’ – thirteen Catholic noblemen and five Jesuits formed a conspiracy devising a plan to explode 36 barrels of gunpowder in the cellar of the House of Lords and kill King James I, and members of the [House of] Commons as they assembled for the opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605. Their plan was to blow up the Parliament building and out of the chaos incite the people into a full insurrection.

“The Thirty Years’ War, 1618-1648, was a series of conflicts that became the last great struggle of religious wars in Europe. It was fought almost exclusively on German soil…but before the war ended, it involved most of the nations of Europe.

…Again the plot is instigated by the Jesuits, priests, and friars, who excite the ignorant Irish Catholic people to a frenzy to commit the most unheard of cruelties. In far away France, Cardinal Richelieu, the French minister, had promised the [Irish Catholic] conspirators a considerable supply of men and money. In one stroke, Catholics rose up against their peaceful and unsuspecting Protestant neighbors, and spared no age, no sex, nor condition. Led on and declared by their fanatical priestly leaders, that no Protestant should be suffered to live any longer among them, adding that it was no more sin to kill a Protestant than to kill a dog, and that the relieving or protecting them was a crime of the most unpardonable nature.
The onslaught raged on, and when it had run its course, one hundred and fifty thousand Protestants lay mutilated, butchered, and dead.

…For the unbiased researcher, history reeks of the butchery of Romanism, where whole cities and populations were unmercifully wiped out, just because they worshipped God in a manner that was different from Roman Catholicism.”

He held that position until 1929, with an interregnum of two years, and, during those decisive years, he led the Austrian interior politics on to the reactionary and clerical road; his successors followed him on that road which led to the absorption of that country into the German block.

Note: the founder of the Jesuit Order] constituted a model which [Heinrich] Himmler strove carefully to copy. Absolute obedience was the supreme rule; every order had to be executed without comment.”
- Walter Shellenberg ((Chief of the Nazi Sicherheitdienst (SD))

“The German author Walter Hagen gives also this discreet information: ‘The Jesuits’ [Superior] General, Count Halke von Ledochowski, was ready to organize, on the common basis of anti-communism, some collaboration between the German Secret Service and the Jesuit Order.’

As a result, within the SS Central Security Service, an organization was created, and most of its main posts were held by Catholic priests wearing the black uniform of the [Nazi] SS. The Jesuit [priest] ‘father’ Himmler [uncle of Heinrich Himmler] was one of its superior officers.”
- Edmond Paris (Author of the book The Secret History of the Jesuits)"
,WideAwake87,2012-11-12T22:52Z,"“…Kurt Heinrich Himmler [was] chief of the Gestapo [i.e., the secret police force of the German Nazi state], which meant he held in his hand the essential reins of power of the [Nazi] regime. Was it his personal merits which earned him such a high position? Did Hitler see in him a superior genius when he compared him [i.e., Heinrich Himmler] to the creator of the Jesuit Order [i.e., Ignatius of Loyola]? It is certainly not what the testimonies of those who knew him imply, as they saw in him nothing more than mediocrity.

Was that ‘star’ [of Heinrich Himmler] shining with a borrowed ‘brightness’? Was it really Kurt Heinrich Himmler, the ostensible [i.e., apparent] chief, who actually reigned over the Gestapo and the secret services? Who was sending millions of people, deported for political reasons, and Jews to their death? Was it the flat-faced nephew or [was it] the [Jesuit priest] uncle, the former Canon at the Court of Bavaria, one of [Jesuit Superior General] Ledochowski’s favorites, a Jesuit ‘father’ and superior officer of the [Nazi] SS?”

“The Jesuits, in control of [Adolph] Hitler’s occultic and homosexual Third Reich…, installed puppet dictators throughout Europe. They were:

· Bavarian Germany and the Third Reich – [Adolph] Hitler [born-died: 1889-1945]
· Italy – [Benito] Mussolini [born-died: 1883-1945]
· ‘Vichy’ France – [Henri Philippe] Petain [born-died: 1856-1951]
· Spain – [Francisco] Franco
· Austria – Seyss-Inquart
· Poland – Frank
· Slovakia – [Jesuit] Priest Tiso
· Croatia – [Ante] Pavelitch ((Ed. Note: alternate spelling: Pavelic))
· Belgium – Degrelle.

All these Roman Catholic, Jesuit-controlled, Jew-hating dictators were loyal to the greatest war criminal of all, Papal Caesar Pius XII and his master, Jesuit [Superior] General Wlodimir Ledochowski.”
- Eric Jon Phelps (Author of the book Vatican Assassins)

“The term ‘Jesuit’ has become synonymous with terms like deceit, chicanery, infiltration, intrigue, subversion…many organized Jesuits have been justly described as treacherous, traitorous workers, seducing many in the service of the Roman Pontiff away from national allegiance…” (1987)
- J. E. C. Shepherd (Canadian historian)

“The presence of the Jesuits in any country, Romanist [i.e., Catholic] or Protestant, is likely to breed social disturbance.”

- Lord Palmerston"
,WideAwake87,2012-11-12T22:53Z,"“There was no disguise they (the Jesuits) could not assume, and therefore, there was no place into which they could not penetrate. They could enter unheard the closet of the Monarch, or the Cabinet of the Statesman. They could sit unseen in convocation or General Assembly, and mingle unsuspected in the deliberations and debates.

There was no tongue they could not speak, and no creed they could not profess, and thus there was no people among whom they might not sojourn, and no church whose membership they might not enter and whose functions they might not discharge. The could execrate [i.e., sharply denounce] the Pope with the Lutheran, and swear the Solemn League with the Covenanter.”
- J.A. Wylie (Rev.; Author of the book The History of Protestantism)

“The assassins of St. Bartholomew [i.e., the Catholics who slaughtered the French Protestant Huguenots in 1572, starting with the St. Bartholomew massacre on August 24th], the inquisitors and the Jesuits are monsters produced by malignant imaginations; they are the natural allies of the spirit of darkness and of death…” (1883)

“The sad facts of the matter are that the Vatican has been THE major player in the geopolitical arena for many centuries. And, for the past four centuries, the Jesuit Order (operating from within the Vatican) has been THE major player in both the geopolitical arena and the theological arena – and a very big player (through its Knights of Malta) in the financial arena and in the international intelligence community! The more I study history and the more ‘I turn over stones’, the more I find the ‘footsteps and fingerprints’ of the Vatican – and, again, more specifically, its Jesuit Order – involved in the most sinister and evil activities!

Indeed, the Jesuit Order (i.e., The Society of Jesus, ‘The Company’), headed by the Jesuit Superior General (i.e., the ‘Black Pope’), is the most formidable enemy to religious and civil liberty that the world has probably ever seen. The Jesuits became so infamous in Europe for fomenting wars and revolutions, and for assassinating heads of State, that they were expelled from 83 countries, city-states, and cities by 1931 – quite often by Roman Catholic monarchs!

The Jesuit Superior General, the Black Pope, not only controls his powerful Jesuit Order, but also controls the powerful Knights of Malta, top-level Knights of Columbus, and the top-levels of Freemasonry. Through his control of the top levels of Secret Societies (especially Knights of Malta and high-level Freemasons), he controls the top intelligence agencies of the world. A good example of this occurred in World War II: the top intelligence man in the OSS (later CIA) was Knight of Malta William “Wild Bill” Donovan; the top intelligence man in Nazi Germany on the eastern front was German Knight of Malta General Reinhard Gehlen; and the top intelligence man in the Soviet Union was Knight of Malta Prince Anton Turkul (who used Jesuit priests for his couriers). Thus, the Jesuit Order was in control of the major combatants, and able to ‘steer’ the war in the directions they wanted – and in the process to slaughter millions of their favorite targets (Jews, Protestants, and Orthodox Christians).

Additionally, because of his control of the Vatican hierarchy (through his Jesuit Order and P-2 Masonry), the Jesuit Superior General also has control and use of the ‘Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith’ (i.e., the Office of Inquisition), the Roman Curia, and Vatican finances (which are substantial)! If all this does not make the ‘Black Pope’ the most powerful man on the face of the earth, I do not know what would.
Secret societies – most particularly the Jesuit Order with its Knights of Malta and top-level Freemasons – must be exposed and removed from our shores, or America will not survive!” – Darryl Eberhart (2005; Editor of “Tackling the Tough Topics” and “Examining the Tough Issues” newsletters – Please see web site: www"
,WideAwake87,2012-11-12T22:54Z,"((Note: Here is the full quote of Lincoln from which the excerpt on page one was taken.)):

“This [American Civil] war [of 1861-1865] would never have been possible without the sinister influence of the Jesuits. We owe it to popery that we now see our land reddened with the blood of her noblest sons. Though there were great differences of opinion between the South and the North on the question of slavery, neither Jeff Davis [President of the Confederacy] nor anyone of the leading men of the Confederacy would have dared to attack the North, had they not relied on the promises of the Jesuits, that under the mask of Democracy, the money and arms of the Roman Catholic, even the arms of France, were at their disposal if they would attack us. I pity the priests, the bishops and monks of Rome in the United States, when the people realize that they are, in great part, responsible for the tears and the blood shed in this war. I conceal what I know on that subject from the knowledge of the nation, for if the people knew the whole truth, this war would turn into a religious war, and it would at once take a tenfold more savage and bloody character. It would become merciless as all religious wars are. It would become a war of extermination on both sides.

The Protestants of both the North and the South would surely unite to exterminate the priests and the Jesuits, if they could hear what Professor [Samuel B.] Morse [Ed. Note: U.S. inventor of the telegraph] has said to me of the plots made in the very city of Rome [i.e., at the Vatican] to destroy this Republic, and if they could learn how the [Roman Catholic] priests, the nuns, and the monks, which daily land on our shores, under the pretext of preaching their religion, instructing the people in their schools, taking care of the sick in the hospitals, are nothing else but the emissaries of the Pope, of Napoleon, and the other despots of Europe, to undermine our institutions, alienate the hearts of our people from our Constitution, and our laws, destroy our schools, and prepare a reign of anarchy here as they have done in Ireland, in Mexico, in Spain, and wherever there are any people who want to be free.”

((Note: What follows is the full quotation of Samuel Morse from which the short excerpt given on the first page of this document was taken.)):

“Let us examine the operations of this Austrian Society [the St. Leopold Foundation], for it is hard at work all around us, yes, here in this country [i.e., the USA]… With its headquarters in Vienna [Austria], under the immediate direction and inspection of [Austrian Prince] Metternich, …it makes itself already felt through the [American] Republic. Its emissaries are here. And who are these emissaries? They are Jesuits. This [Roman Catholic] society of men, after exerting their tyranny for upwards of two hundred years, at length became so formidable to the world, threatening the entire subversion to all social order, that even the Pope [i.e., Clement XIV], whose devoted subjects they [i.e., the Jesuits] are, and must be, by the vow of their society, was compelled to dissolve them [in 1773].

They had not been suppressed, however, for fifty years, before the waning influence of Popery and Despotism required their useful labors to resist the light of Democratic liberty, and the Pope (Pius VII) simultaneously with the formation of the Holy Alliance [in Europe], revived the order of the Jesuits in all their power. ((Ed. Comment: Pope Pius VII restored the Jesuit Order in 1814 in exchange for his release from prison, where he had spent five years under Jesuit “persuasion”.))

And do Americans need to be told what Jesuits are? If any are ignorant, let them inform themselves of their history without delay; no time is to be lost; their workings are before you in every day’s events; they are a secret society, a sort of Masonic order with super added features of revolting odiousness, and a thousand times more dangerous. They are not merely priests, or priests of one religious creed; they are merchants, and lawyers, and editors, and "
