Stranded in the Sierra Mountains with a blizzard on the way, seven plane crash survivors think things are about as bad as they could get … until alien beasts begin devouring them one by one in this gore fest written and directed by Paul Gagné. Facing barbed-tongued creatures that shred human flesh with their razor-sharp teeth, the survivors devise an explosive plan to obliterate their rapidly multiplying foes.
