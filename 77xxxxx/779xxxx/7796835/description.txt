This is a premodded Halo CE Trial version that contains a bunch of tweaks, fixes, mods to weapons and Blood Gulch itself dubbed "Battle Base Mod".

My opinion on it:
 Love this mod, makes Halo Demo turn into a Quake Arena kinda feel where the campers ain't successful and "Shee Noobs" aren't getting an advantage over anyone else. The portals are sick, once you figure where they go and how to actually use em, this game gets FAST. When others join your games, i suggest giving them a few seconds to look around and get used to it, a tonne of stuff is different and chances are they are gonna blow their own legs off with the guns and get pissed off at it if you just come in an rape em.
This particular mod looks like 3 different mods added together. I'm pretty sure i uploaded the original version that just had the weapons mod added in up here before. Then the base mods themselves were another mod, then the paint jobs were another one. The Paint Jobs are all tagged "Warren" I honestly have no idea who it is and that paint mods been around for a while to. Had it a few years ago myself.

Creators notes:
Battle Base Mod

This mod creates an extra two levels on top of the already existing bases. It also includes a wall base for each team. The wall bases are platforms made high on the cliff face and are great for snipering from. Also an armory is located in the sky and is accessed through a teleporter located somewhere in the map. This armory includes almost every weapon and normally multiples of the same weapon. The 'Super Weapon' is located in the armory. It is a needler that shoots rockets that travel just faster that running speed. These rockets trace the target. And finally a hidden teleporter allows access to a snipering base from the sky.

This mod still has some miner glitches but the mod is still completly functional (there is so much extra in the map that, on some computers, things far away sometimes become invisible, but it is worth it to be able to play wit the mod). It may still be edited as this is the first release (version 1.0).

Now the next part of this that has a mod is the Gametypes menu. I've added one into the core itself, Gametypes are now lit up, mouse hover and click doesn't select it, you'll need to use the down arrow and enter (small price to pay considering demo limits this)

Also theres an additional Gametype Selection setup included here, the HaloCGT.EXE file is another way of doing this via alt+tab while in game. Apparently only the person hosting the game needs to have this running for them. 

Creators Notes:

Instructions on "how to use" are included in this program.

Any questions can be left in guest book. Also any comments on the program would be great.

The whole thing works in multiplayer as well, color mods aren't seen im not sure how much of the base mod works unless they have a copy of this as well. If you got a copy and wanna play, "Free Tits" is always my game :P
