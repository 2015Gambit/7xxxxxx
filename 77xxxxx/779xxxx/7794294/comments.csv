You posting REX E+ OD here while it hasn't been released on REX forums yet!

This ain't a hoax, right?"
[T],_SnakEye,2012-11-05T09:40Z,"it's been released on the 29th of October to the distributors, the distributors just did not release it on their web page yet.
but that doesn't mean it was not released and/or RTMed.
this is the real deal, I installed it myself to test it out. "
,flobro1,2012-11-05T10:44Z,"Thanks Captain SnakEye. i'm keeping loading and seeding it and we'll see.
By chance would you hold latest FRANCE VFR ""ALSACE"" & ""LANGUEDOC"" pleaaaaaase."
,eefieboy,2012-11-05T11:14Z,Thanks! this is indeed the real deal. The download is not that fast but ill seed when fininsed downloading. Youre very fast with this release.Do you maybe have the ground environment europe 2.3 update unwrapped? Ive download it but it needs to be unwrapped just like the previous version. Hope you know someone who can upload it. Thanks

ThankÂ´s"
[T],_SnakEye,2012-11-05T18:16Z,you can just go head directly and install REX Essential+ Overdrive. you don't need to go through Rex Essential+ 1st. the OD version contains also the regular version in it

,gr82bagator,2012-11-06T18:48Z,"Great upload! Works just fine for me. I was wondering if this has the FlightAware addition, or would anyone be willing to share? It's a subscription service, so may not be worth it!"
,joshdu25,2012-11-06T19:56Z,"@gr82bagator 
Yes FlightAware seems to be included if you read the documentation coming with this package :)"
,world1p,2012-11-06T21:06Z,Thanks bro.. Great Job..
,420_rowe,2012-11-06T21:48Z,"Does this come with a crack pre-installed? Im asking because I already own REX Essentials, I just want the download. "
[T],_SnakEye,2012-11-06T23:31Z,"No crack in it, it's the full normal FSS version
we just circumvented the Activation process during the Setup.
meaning you will bypass it already as you have the Original MSI installer by REX and not using FSS Warper.
there shouldn't be any issues with this. think about this release like the Source Install REX game studios gave to Simmarket and FSS to distribute.
Simmarket/FSS then add their subscription to the Install. we by passed it."
[T],_SnakEye,2012-11-06T23:41Z,"BTW - I Installed this on my machine for testing as this is the original release by REX and I Loved it so much that I ditched AS2012 for the time being.
as I am going to use it from now on, I purchased REXE+OD 2 days ago.
I advise you guys to do the same.
if you like it , buy it. be fair with the developers.
Whatever I use in FSX, I buy it."
,420_rowe,2012-11-07T01:22Z,awesome! thanks! 
,anchit02,2012-11-07T04:30Z,"So, what would be the procedure to update to this release from REX 2.0 OD? Should I completely uninstall REX 2.0 OD first?"
[T],_SnakEye,2012-11-07T07:32Z,"once you Download this, in the Documentation Folder there is an Upgrade path chart PDF file. that will tell you."
,MiGKiller29,2012-11-07T22:31Z,Thanks _SnakEye!
,rainy200,2012-11-08T00:58Z,"

,anchit02,2012-11-10T09:55Z,"Hey SnakeEye, any idea on how to get this running in a networked system? I cant access their forum for obvious reasons. Any help will be appreciated."
,anchit02,2012-11-10T09:59Z,Does anyone know how to get this working on a networked setup? I cant go to the forums for help.
[T],_SnakEye,2012-11-10T15:11Z,"is there any reference for this in the User manual?
I haven't registered onto their forum yet, even though I am entitled as I purchased REXE+ few days ago :) "
,anchit02,2012-11-10T18:38Z,"SnakEye, there is no mention about a networked setup at all. I checked on their forum, and there is a topic that has all the detailed instruction but you need to be a registered user have  the REX number. Here is the site: http://www.realenvironmentxtreme.com/forums/index.php?/topic/17872-how-to-set-up-a-network-for-fsx-rexe/

Could you please share the knowledge since you have the REX number! Thanks, really appreciate it."
,zuooo,2012-11-11T18:04Z,There is a new king of fsx weather software - OpusFSX.
[T],_SnakEye,2012-11-11T18:48Z,"I got the procedure for operating it in a network configuration.
