Cinematique Instruments The Bowl KONTAKT | 59 MB
TEAM MAGNETRiXX 05 NOVEMBER 2012

Cinematique Instruments hit the bowl with a couple of different kinds of mallets such as felt mallets, a plastic mallet, a leather mallet and a wool mallet. Finally they knocked on the bowl with their knuckles.

All these variations are playable via key switches which will be displayed on the GUI to maintain the overview.

In order to provide a natural feeling Cinematique Instruments recorded five Round Robin variations each and added several options to shape the sound to your own requirements. They included distortion, EQs and a rotary simulation. Furthermore you can add a vibrato by moving the modulation wheel and they also provide reverb and delay. You can easily adjust the length and the attack of The Bowl in order to achieve textures or pad sounds. Cinematique Instruments included the default arpeggiator of Kontakt with some presets.
