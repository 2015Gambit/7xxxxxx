Richard S. Quimby, "Photonics and Lasers: An Introduction"
English | ISBN: 0471719749 | 2006 | PDF | 536 pages 

This book evolved from a series of courses developed by the author and taught in the areas of lasers and photonics. This thoroughly classroom-tested work fills a unique need for students, instructors, and industry professionals in search of an introductory-level book that covers a wide range of topics in these areas. Comparable books tend to be aimed either too high or too low, or they cover only a portion of the topics that are needed for a comprehensive treatment.
