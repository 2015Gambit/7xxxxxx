Glassheart is the third studio album from Leona Lewis. A collection of timeless songs, each one potentially a single, the album was recorded over two years between London, Denver and Los Angeles and sees Leona working with an executive producer for the first time: Fraser T Smith. The pair first met ten years previously when Leona was unknown and recording demos, working hard for that first big break. A decade later and Leona stepped back into the vocal booth in front of Fraser as a global superstar.
