Bob Fires the Kids

Bob worries he's depriving his children of
their summer vacation by making them work at
the restaurant, so he fires them. However,
the kids become so bored with their newfound
freedom that they secretly get hired by a
pair of married hippie farmers, who hire the
Belcher kids as "weed pickers." Meanwhile,
Bob hires Mickey the bank robber to help out
at the restaurant, but soon regrets his
decision
