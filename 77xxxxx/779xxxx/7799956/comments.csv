Hi:

Why don't you make your upcoming movie brrip releases in mp4 format? Thanks for all your small size rips which also includes English subs. Is there possible can u make upcoming brrip release to 480p or 720p resolutions in same small size rips. Can u upload the new movie Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days (2012)."
