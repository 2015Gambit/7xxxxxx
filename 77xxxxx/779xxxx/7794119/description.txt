Smokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King - Have Blues, Will Travel [2010] [Album]
Original Release / Alligator Records / CD

In 1989, Kubek met guitarist/vocalist Bnois King at a Monday night Dallas jam session. The two became fast friends, and melded their seemingly divergent stylesΓÇöKubek a rocking and fierce picker and slider, King a jazz-inflected chorder (who could also solo with flaming electricity)ΓÇöinto one of the most potent guitar combinations the Southwest had ever produced. Kubek explains the relationship succinctly: ΓÇ£I pull the blues out of him, and he pulls the jazz out of me. Bnois knows so much about jazz itΓÇÖs amazing.ΓÇ¥ The bandΓÇÖs Alligator Records debut, 2008ΓÇÖs Blood Brothers, brought the long-time musicians to their largest audience yet and earned the band accolades all across the country. The Chicago Sun-Times declared, ΓÇ£Genuine houserockinΓÇÖ bluesΓÇªthey boogie till the break of day.ΓÇ¥ Allmusic described the album as ΓÇ£tough, robust, soul-blues that is as hot as theyΓÇÖve ever gotten in the studio. Impressive.ΓÇ¥

With "Have Blues, Will Travel", they take another giant step forward. Kubek and King wrote or co-wrote all twelve songs, and, along with their road-tested rhythm section, they ignite a blues fire with enough heat to fuel an all-night party. The chemistry between KubekΓÇÖs blistering fretwork and KingΓÇÖs savvy vocals and unpredictable, multifaceted guitar work creates a roadhouse blend of muscular blues-rock, hip-shaking shuffles and slow-burning blues that is simply impossible to resist. Each song is infused with deep, from-the-heart musicianship, carefully crafted, true-to-life lyrics and delivered with the occasional wry smile. King calls Have Blues, Will Travel the best record the band has ever made.
