,blue.dot,2012-11-06T12:46Z,How does this contains an update? Its only main exe file with RLD dll...
,blue.dot,2012-11-06T12:52Z,"Nvm, still doesn't work. Game crashes to desktop before choose language menu"
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-11-06T13:04Z,because the main exe is only updated and it this torrent is for those people who have downloaded internal release of this game
,blue.dot,2012-11-06T13:57Z,"Thanks for info. I have that internal release, but it still doens't work.. At first origin always popped up with nothing, so I uninstalled it, changed settings in fifasetup, run the game, and it runs in 800*600 and crashes before the language change menu..."

,sagar.19,2012-11-07T07:04Z,This isnt a proper crack..it removes the team names and there is a problem with menus...Any solutions..
,jeffboon97,2012-11-07T08:35Z,Team names missing in Career mode.Fix it please! :( 
,mammouth2000,2012-11-08T18:29Z,Teams names are missing too. But my game has stopped crashing randomly so thanks and I hope you will find a fix for the teams names. Keep up the good work!
,narutozk,2012-11-10T19:50Z,it is not for KaOs rip?
,omgwtfnoob,2012-11-11T06:54Z,"THANK YOU!!!

looks like i can buy players now in manager mode without it crashing... indeed the team names do not appear in the league table, and the dates seem to be missing the month, but it's at least playable now... who gives a fuck about team names!!!

i wish i hadnt played the last 3 seasons without buying players now..."
,omgwtfnoob,2012-11-11T07:01Z,"lol bought 1 player in manager mode no problems, second player crashed like usual.... hopefully it wasnt just a one off me signing that first player..."
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-11-16T14:57Z,sorry guys from where i downloaded this it said it contained update 1.5 but it doesnt and it is only a crack only for it so download that update by googling
