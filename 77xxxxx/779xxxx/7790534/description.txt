      Summary   
                                                                                           
      When Scarlett and Snake Eyes sneak into Cobra Commander's secret facility, they find 
      out that Cobra Commander is hiding in the facility after a ninja attack in his own   
      home. The threat of the ninja causes Baroness to call in Storm Shadow to protect     
      Cobra Commander. It is soon discovered that the ninja is actually Jinx in a          
      high-tech suit made by Destro's M.A.R.S. Industries and she learns what really       
      happened the day the Hard Master was killed. Storm Shadow also confesses the truth   
      to her as well and is now masterless when he leaves Jinx to be the rightful leader   
      to the Arashikage clan. She swears from now on the clan will go down the path her    
      father intended--abandon the old ways and embrace the new--using technology.
