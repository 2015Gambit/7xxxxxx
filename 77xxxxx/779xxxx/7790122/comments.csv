,fuctyou,2012-11-04T22:14Z,Thanks for sharing this. We shall see if this is yet another disaster for Microsoft. They cant seem to get anything right these days. 
,murphy78,2012-11-05T06:00Z,"Microsoft does not make hybrid x86/x64 dvds, so this cannot be retail.  It can, however, use retail sources.  I will test the install.wim files from this and see if it appears to use retail eulas or MSDN rtm eulas.  Most people who post MSDN iso files don't realize they are not retail."
,murphy78,2012-11-05T07:19Z,"Done testing.  This is RTM.  Someone has exported a prox86 and a prox64 image into a single install.wim.  The eula is RTM and the files all have july dates like the rtm.

So basically the claim that it is Retail is false. That is a lie."

,murphy78,2012-11-05T23:43Z,"swede, that is because it is not a 64 bit disc. It is a 32 bit disc that someone has removed the 8core and slapped on a 8prox64 to.  I'm not even sure you can install the x64 version as it has no ei.cfg

This torrent is bad"

hi everyone, 
(1)there is a virus in the Activators so avoid using antivirus as it will delete the files and windows will crash.
(2) In Windows updates, change settings to check but don't install automatically and by installing (KB2756872 update) you have to run the activator again but not fix.
(3) Buy Windows 8 if affordable for you!!!!!!!!!!~
(4) If you are not an advance user and that also means if you don't know what restore points are then disable windows update.
(5) Every single time you guy install any software or update please create Windows Restore Points, only if you think windows is out of bad luck.

Works!~ Enjoy New OS as I am :) x32 & x64"
