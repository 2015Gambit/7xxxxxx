Moron? Really, thanks for the reply. Some advice if a question upsets you don't reply to it, ignore it. Its not worth getting so worked up over. You sound like a person this world needs more of. :) "

,Mefayor,2012-11-05T11:47Z,"@snaz27

yeah i agree and quite honestly i think this is pretty shitty video quality-screw the "" its for free so shut up and enjoy"" because this does not feel like 720p at all i feel like watching upscaled dvdrip.Or is it that the video quality broadcasted on HDTV channells is basically this shitty?"
,HighDefinition,2012-11-05T14:23Z,@FFx69: If that is a spoiler I hope you get raped by Nigerians.
