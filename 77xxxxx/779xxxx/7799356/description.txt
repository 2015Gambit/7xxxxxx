Sarah Rayner - One Moment, One Morning - ePub, MOBI - Barbie1710

The Brighton to London line. The 7:44 am train. Cars packed with commuters. One woman occupies her time observing the people around her. Opposite, a girl puts on her make-up. Across the aisle, a husband strokes his wifeΓÇÖs hand. Further along, another woman flicks through a glossy magazine. Then, abruptly, everything changes: a man collapses, the train is stopped, and an ambulance is called.
For at least three passengers on the 7:44 on that particular morning, life will never be the same again. ThereΓÇÖs Lou, in an adjacent seat, who witnesses events first hand. Anna, whoΓÇÖs sitting further up the train, impatient to get to work. And Karen, the manΓÇÖs wife.
Telling the story of the week following that fateful train journey, One Moment, One Morning is a stunning novel about love and loss, about family and ΓÇô above allΓÇô friendship. A stark reminder that, sometimes, one moment is all it takes to shatter everything. Yet it also reminds us that somehow, despite it all, life can and does go on.
