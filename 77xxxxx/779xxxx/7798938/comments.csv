I wish you had put this on the same scale as your ""The Avengers"" rip (at around 8 GB) cause that was nothing short of mind-blowing!

But even at 3800 kbps encoding for this one, this still looks superb! 

Thanks 3Li! :) :) :)"
,openhouse,2012-11-07T05:20Z,"1080p @ 4.7 GB please.. come on 3Li... 5 GB is not worth a 720p, 720 only at around 2 GB file size only plz... Make 1080p at 4.7 GB file size plz :(("
[V],3Li,2012-11-07T07:44Z,"sorry man, this it's final encode."
,openhouse,2012-11-07T13:19Z,"3li, can you please make 1080p @ 5gb from now onwards please ?
Before you used to make 720p @ 3gb which were as good as these... So Please make 1080p @ 5 GB plz.. from now onwards please :D"
