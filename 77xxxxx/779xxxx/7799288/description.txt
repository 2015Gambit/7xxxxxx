The Shirelles were an African American girl group that achieved popularity in
the early 1960s. They consisted of schoolmates Shirley Owens (later Shirley
Alston-Reeves), Doris Coley (later Doris Kenner-Jackson), Addie "Micki" Harris
(later Addie Harris McPherson), and Beverly Lee. They have been described as
either the first African-American girl group to top the Billboard Hot 100, or
the first girl group overall, with the song "Will You Love Me Tomorrow".
