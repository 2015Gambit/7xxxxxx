The music is the instrumental ""Solace"" by Scott Joplin.
The words are new and give the song a new title, ""The Wanderer""
by ""The Swingle Singers""

And here are the lyrics so you can sing right along ...

===========================

Long ago in the wilderness lived a man, whose journey was endless.
 The Wanderer came upon a village in Mexico.
 His vision was blurred, he couldn't see quite which way to go.
 The blaze of the Sun in the cloudless keep
 threw shadows on men under brims asleep.

The Wanderer drank, then rested under a shady tree,
 all eyes upon him. Who could this golden-haired stranger be?
 The children came and gathered close,
 watching his (while) watching his every move.

He began to play on a little bamboo piccolo
 insect and bird songs,calls of the wild.
 Then the children saw many little creatures, tiny things,
 flocking around, entranced by the sound of the music.
 He then made the creatures disappear.
 The people stood back in sudden fear.
 A saint! Or a magician! Who was he and from where? 

Strolling, the Wanderer passed along the alleys and peeling walls.
 A crowd followed him, bewildered, on by the market stalls.
 He came to a place where a beggar sat
 with his wooden bowl on a threadbare mat.
 The Wanderer gave his piccolo to the beggar,
 and he spoke in a tongue that no one knew or could understand.
 The beggar blew upon the flute,
 then he smiled (and) then he smiled like a child.

Calm days in the village, and the people called him ""strange one"",
 The prince (from nowhere) with golden hair
 (like the Sun), The strange one,
 (who would care) for all men"".
 And soon they were showing without rhythm, without knowing,
 a change, very small to each other: something like his way.

Then the carnival came and the colors like flame in the purple night sky.    And there was dancing and song, candles moving along,
 and he watched them go by.
 Then the beggar man's flute led the band on its route
 by the small village square.
 And with the coming of dawning, with no one to see,
 yes, the Wanderer went silently.

 [la la fa la las ad nearly infinitum]

 And with the coming of dawning, with no one to see,
 yes, the Wanderer went silently."
