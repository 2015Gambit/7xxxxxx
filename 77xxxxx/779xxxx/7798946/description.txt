I must advertise a serious issue: Bannerwar and Darkthule are two of the most famous NSBM scene bands worldwide. I have to remember all people, this blog is not a political blog. Consequently, these bands are in the compilation exclusively for musical reasons, never political. I not support in any form this kind of bands!!

Enjoy!!!
