Issues 1-33 of Volume Two are 'Restorations'. In order to get the best image quality it's likely many of you (depending on what you're viewing the comic book on) will need to click the size down a couple notches to something resembling a regular comic book page. They look pretty good if you do that. Unfortunately the source scans were very small, all of them had been scanned outside of the image area without being cropped, and the quality was very grey and dirty (no disrespect to the original scanner, or any scanners for that matter - I couldn't do what I do if you didn't scan them first). I cropped, enlarged and cleaned them all up (somewhere around 700 images) so they look as close to the rest of the run as possible (but honestly, not quite as good). Issues 34-79 looked great as they were, so no changes were made to those issues. I wish I could have found better scans of issues 1-33, but, no such luck. I'm going to keep looking, though, and if I come across a full run of those issues I'll upload them as an add-on.

For those who have never read Poison Elves, Drew Hayes taught himself how to create comics and then how to self-publish. As such, the earliest issues of The Mulehide Years were a little rough. Don't let that throw you, though, because he found his style and groove pretty quickly and maintained that look through the next 90 issues or so. 

What ISN'T in this torrent...

The four Portfolios. Personally, I don't think they were very good as far as art portfolios go, and the scan size was small on all of them, as well.

Issue 80 of Volume Two. The series officially ended with issue 79 in 2004. In 2007 Sirius published a commemorative issue number 80 with sketches and story ideas Drew had created before his death. It was a nice gesture for the fans, but kind of pointless.

Poison Elves Fan Edition. A rare one-shot containing the first appearance of the full-color Riders story. But that story also appears in the Poison Elves Color Special, so there was no reason to include it twice.

The TPB Extras. There out there, but they add nothing essential to the stories, but add another 60 mb to the torrent.

Poison Elves Trading Cards. Again, they add nothing to the story, so I left them out.

Poison Elves presents - Songs in the Key of Satan. A non-essential ash can style mini-comic.

Poison Elves V1 and V2 Novelization.

Otherwise, everything is here... I think...

[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-11-04T07:31Z,"Poison Elves is a black-and-white comic book by the late artist/writer Drew Hayes concerning the life and times of an elf named Lusiphur. Hayes originally self-published the series during the early 90s on his own Mulehide Graphics under the title of I, Lusiphur. After the first seven issues the title of the book was changed to Poison Elves. Amrahly'nn, the world of Poison Elves, is one where magic and technology meet. An example of this is Lusiphur's magical semi-automatic handgun that never runs out of bullets.

Drew Hayes' work was influenced by Dungeons & Dragons, Elfquest, and Cerebus. Lusiphur was originally one of Hayes' Dungeons & Dragons characters. The book version of the character was based on Lux Interior of The Cramps, Glenn Danzig of The Misfits, and Nivek Ogre of Skinny Puppy. Hayes had described the world as ""a mix of Tolkien's Middle Earth and the Neo-Romantic world seen in the Adam and the Ants video for 'Stand and Deliver'"".

Hayes said...

""the first Elfquest series is one of the most amazing comic book runs ever. Period. You can blame the length of my Elves' ears on Wendy Pini.""

""Dave Sim and Cerebus influenced me in every other way.""

Since it definitely wasn't here at TPB, and because I know a few people are just grabbing my uploads to see what they're about, I thought I go ahead and add this one to the pile.   "

The TPB Extras. They're out there, they add nothing essential to the stories, but they added another 60 mb to the torrent, so I left them out.

There. I feel better now."
