Belly fat: Either you have it, or you are doing everything you can to keep it off.
 Despite what the headlines on the newsstands claim, achieving a flat stomach is not a ten-minute transformation; it's a lifestyle transformation.


 In his latest work, bestselling author John Chatham blasts the myths surrounding belly fat. The groundbreaking research in The Belly Fat Diet reveals a science based approach to healthy eating and looking good, and it doesn't involve starving yourself.

 Achieving a flat stomach is not about doing hundreds of crunches or worrying about how much you eat; it's about what you eat. The Belly Fat Diet teaches you how to eat more and weigh less, so there's no need to ever go hungry.
 It's common knowledge that obesity is dangerous to your health, but did you know that belly fat is the deadliest fat on your body? Belly fat increases your risks of heart disease, diabetes and other chronic illnesses.
