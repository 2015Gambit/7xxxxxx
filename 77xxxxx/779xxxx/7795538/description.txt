               Exploring C++ The Programmers Introduction - 2010kaiser




Exploring C++ uses a series of selfΓÇôdirected lessons to divide C++ into biteΓÇôsized chunks that you can digest as rapidly as you can swallow them. The book assumes only a basic understanding of fundamental programming concepts (variables, functions, expressions, statements) and requires no prior knowledge of C or any other particular language. It reduces the usually considerable complexity of C++.

The included lessons allow you to learn by doing, as a participant of an interactive education session. YouΓÇÖll master each step in a one sitting before you proceed to the next. Author Ray Lischner has designed questions to promote learning new material. And by responding to questions throughout the text, youll be engaged every step of the way.
