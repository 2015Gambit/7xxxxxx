Aadmi Aur Insaan|1969|Musical Family Drama|x264|MP3|Phantom

A wealthy and independent industrialist, JK alias Jai Kishan befriends a young man from a middle-class background by the name of Munish Mehra, assists him financially to go abroad and get necessary qualifications as an engineer, and then hires him on one of his construction projects. Jai meets with and falls in love with Meena Khanna, who is the daughter of a government official. Shortly after this, Jai finds out that Munish is also attracted to Meena, and is enraged. He subsequently fires Munish, and ensures that he will not get hired anywhere else. After several vain attempts to obtain employment, Munish gets hired by the government, and is assigned to investigate the collapse of a railway bridge. Munish finds out that Jai was directly responsible for this mishap as he used sub-standard materials. Munish now has the tools to avenge his humiliation at the hands of Jai, and accordingly informs his employer. But when the time comes for Munish to make a full report, he declines, and the government has no alternative but to prosecute him in a court of law for taking bribes and destroying his report. And the main witness appearing against him is none other than Jai.
