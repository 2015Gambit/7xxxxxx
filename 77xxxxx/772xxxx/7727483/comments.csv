[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-14T22:30Z,"Don't have a clue, sorry, these weren't my videos, simply trying to take some of the stress off the video websites cuz a LOT of people on my list just couldn't get a chance to see it. And of course, simply cuz i know how to use a search engine, they came flooding with requests of alternative means to watch the videos. The live feed still has SEVERAL million people backed up still waiting to see this. So I am just lending a hand to get it out there cuz it is pretty sweet what he did"
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-14T22:58Z,"sorry bout the vid quality, it was all i could find at the time, now they are starting to release better looking across the sites."
,kraftseeder,2012-10-15T00:10Z,"Will anyone be able too upload the WHOLE THING (about 8h) in HD? 720p or 1080p? 

Would be amazing.

It was live on youtube like 15 seconds after they closed the stream but I forgot to start download it from the source so now I can't get a hold of it...yet."
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-15T02:28Z,"HERES SOME GOOD NEWS ON THAT! RIGHT NOW, Currently downloading, in 720p, the full 10 video of the jump (sorry that discovery channel feed has YET to show a replay), and a 720p documentary on the fella himself. So YES soon as i have the entire copy pulled i will cater to the 720p crew on here, which is something I NEVER do lol, can't promise I'll get it out as fast as this one was, the one im getting is 2.0 Gig in size and im gonna have to see if a codec compression will fix that as well."
