White Buffalo opened

It's a nice vintage show where the band is still figuring out things.  Youcan hear the guys before 'Hatfield' discussing what to play.  One of them mentions "Do You Know Mr. Soul?" to JoJo I'd guess, but they jump into 'Hatfield' first. Lots of comments in between tunes if you listen closely (they don't speak that stuff into the mics of course).
