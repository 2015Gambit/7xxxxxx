So, no high quality source just yet, so I encode medium quality to create ...
Frankencode! ... Tiny version (1/3 the calories)

This is a test, this is only a test, if this had been an actual ...

The purpose is to provide really tiny videos (resolution and filesize)
... for tiny screens and tiny storage devices
... and just maybe for those still on dial-up.
Thought about 320x176 for ultimate compatibility, but bad visions
...of long ago formats made me not want to do this.
So, I settled on 480x272 as a compromise.
Long shots suffer the worst, but close-ups look fairly good.
I have a 32" 1080p monitor two feet in front of my face
...and these look surprising well, considering.

This test has two parts:
Part one - how many download it.
Part two - hopefully some will comment, if just to encourage me to do more.
... or especially to report problems and make suggestions.

Your Favorite Episode suggestions (no promises) are now being considered.
