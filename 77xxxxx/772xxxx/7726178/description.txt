Pop star Justin Bieber and Rap star Nicki Minaj join forces on "Beauty And A Beat", a cut from the Canadian singer's third studio album "Believe" - Produced by hit-maker Max Martin, the oh-so-catchy "Beauty And A Beat" sees JB singing about the only two things he truly needs in life over a superb synth-pop beat, with dubstep-ish breaks. Onika comes out in the bridge snatching wigs with an electrifying verse. Sick! How 'til "Beauty And A Beat" becomes a single!?

 Justin..

 Show you off
 Tonight I wanna show you off (aye,aye,aye)
 What you got
 A billion could've never bought (aye,aye,aye)

 We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
 I wanna show you all the finer things in life
 So just forget about the world, we're young tonight
 I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

 Cause all..
 I need, is a Beauty and a Beat
 Who can make my life complete
 It's all..
 Bout you, when the music makes you move
 Baby do it like you do
 Cause..

 [Beat break]

 Body rock,
 Girl, I can feel your body rock (aye,aye,aye)
 Take a bow, you on the hottest ticket now (aye,aye,aye)

 We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
 I wanna show you all the finer things in life
 So just forget about the world, we're young tonight
 I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

 Cause all..
 I need, is a Beauty and a Beat
 Who can make my life complete
 It's all..
 Bout you, when the music makes you move
 Baby do it like you do

 [Nicki Minaj]
 Uh, Uh
 In time, ink lines, b-bitches couldn't get on my incline
 World tour, it's mine, ten little letters, on a big sign
 Justin.. Bieber, you know Imma hit 'em with the ether
 Buns out, weiner, but I gotta keep an eye out for Selena
 Beauty, Beauty and the Beast
 Beauty from the east, beautiful confessions of the priest
 Beast, beauty from the streets, we don't get deceased
 Every time a beauty on the beats
 (Body rock, girl, I wanna feel your body rock)
 (Yeah, Yeah, yeah, Let's go, Let's go!)

 Cause all..
 I need, is a Beauty and a Beat
 Who can make my life complete
 It's all..
 Bout you, when the music makes you move
 Baby do it like you do
 Cause...

 [Beat break]
