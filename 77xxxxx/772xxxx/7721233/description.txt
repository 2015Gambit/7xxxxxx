welcome. this game has been patched and is ready to burn and be played on a xbox360 with f/w:3.0 installed onto it. it would probably also work on fw:2.0 if you dont plan to use your system for online use, but if you plan to play online with this game you will need F/W: 3.0 anything less then 3.0 you will be risking a ban. this iso copy of the game also includes the AP 2.5 extracted from the main disk for added protection. and is already in the ISO you are downloading so like i said download burn and play on F/W:3.0





FORMAT: xbox360

xbox live safe? = only on F/w: 3.0


this game should also work on phat xbox360s that have the Samsung drive that does not do ap/2.5 protection checks, and is using fw:2.01. and also be safe with online play.
