,ScarletteSpider,2012-10-14T01:46Z,"thnx for the upload, A9 V8
any chance of getting another family movie that came out same day as this did called ""Pitch Perfect"" purdy plz?"
,iThankful,2012-10-14T04:30Z,"Thank you so much for this upload! Really appreciate it and enjoyed it! 

So others are not disappointed though people have been rating the quality pretty high. I think a more fair rating is

7 Video (It's watchable it's ok... slightly distorted a bit fuzzy. )
9 Audio 

Just no that going into watching it and you won't be disappointed! Believe it's an 8 or higher on video though and you're gonna be sad."

Not worth watching on PS3. I dont know how a couple people rated the quality of this video above a 2. Also, sound is turned off via PS3."
,nvmyrx,2012-10-21T01:43Z,blackhunter23 & sumijsr27 found better copies at suckeachothersdicks.com - this is the pirate bay you dumb fucks your spam shit dont work its like going to facebook and trying to convince them that there is more people on myspace - its just not logical 
,missworld,2012-10-21T13:44Z,1.38gib for this shit! A/V/4/4 and that's the actual rating. Not these fuckheads with 8 out of 10. What to you watch on VHS normally? piss off

,k9dog.dk,2012-11-03T16:02Z,"To the PS3 users. In general if you have trouble watching movie it's usually a wrong streamer or the Cinavia protection in the audio track. Cinavia protection can be removed from the content, but not all people know how."

Because it is not a ""Legal"" digital copy of the movie. 

Any of the 'Smart' players you have or use, especially the ones that are connected to the internet, like Samsung's SMART Blu-Ray and SMART Television's, PS3, etc., are connected with the latest copy protection hardware and software.

Your best bet is to just watch it on an old DVD player or on your PC..."
,Jugg141,2012-11-07T22:53Z,Do not go to the links above me... incase you arent smart enough to understand it yourselfs
,joaf01,2012-11-10T23:32Z,"These clowns that come in here and claim to have found better copies of this movie make me laugh. If you have seen better or downloaded better, why come in here if you have seen better ? DUH, freak'n spam bots."
,moomilk4,2012-11-15T00:50Z,To anyone that ever has trouble getting movies to work just get a audio/video format converter it has nothing to do with the system for the most part. here is the torrent location : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6906233/Xilisoft_Video_Converter_Ultimate_v7.0.1___Crack-Serials_%5BCC_RG%5D
,LkwdSpider,2012-11-18T17:33Z,PS3 USERS...GET AN XBOX..LOL...OR TVERSITY WORX TOO!
,Knuckles13,2012-11-22T10:24Z,"SNEAKY B ~ your talking out your ass dude everything you have mentioned is NOT TRUE AT ALL ! ( & THAT'S A FACT )

,Vulcan219,2012-11-24T12:26Z,"Yeah, what Knuckles13 said, I have these devices and no problems with them on anything I have downloaded to play on them, I will check this video out, and if I have an issue I will let you know, but I don't expect to have an issue.

Sneaky_B, you need to get more informed before posting things like that."
