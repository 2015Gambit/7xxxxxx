Thanks."
,whymichael,2012-10-15T04:07Z,"Much thanks!!  

So far so good (plays fully on DivX) after trying two other offerings from others that just ended up being shite.

What the hell with there being so much junk out there on this??  Usually I've got to choose between multiple quality offerings but yours is the only one that works this time around. 

THANKS AGAIN!!"
