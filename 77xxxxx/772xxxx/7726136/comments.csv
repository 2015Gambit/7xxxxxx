,Richtnaucher,2012-10-15T17:37Z,the second key does not work on 10.8.2
,folke__filbyter,2012-10-15T18:43Z,"It works just fine.
Did you copy the keygen to your HD before running it. It cannot run from within a read-only dmg file.
If that's what you mean?"
,grimani,2012-10-16T03:35Z,"Hey mate, for the 3 that i'm supposed to place on the patch and wait, I did that for 5 min for each one then opened up photoshop, its still keeps asking for activation code, I looked for the app files under application support and found the alien skin ones, although there is no app files there for any of the 3, could they be some where else, I got the others that worked with the keygen to work fine.....

What am I doing wrong?"
,folke__filbyter,2012-10-16T23:18Z,"grimani,
try this (one more time):
1. Install Blow up, Exposure and Snap Art.
2. Open up folder: ""MacIntosh HD/Library/Application Support/Alien Skin/Blow Up 3""
3. Start ""Alien Skin BU-E-SA [azr+ patcher]"".
4. Drag the application file ""Alien Skin Blow up 3"" (72,3 MB) onto the patcher's (broken) window.
5. Wait for the progress bar. It will only take a few seconds.
6. You will get a message: ""Alien Skin Blow Up 3.app has been successfully patched!""
7. Do the same with:
""MacIntosh HD/Library/Application Support/Alien Skin/Exposure 4/Alien Skin Exposure 4"" (72,4 MB)
and
""MacIntosh HD/Library/Application Support/Alien Skin/Snap Art 3/Alien Skin Snap Art 3"" (35,1 MB)."
,grimani,2012-10-17T00:19Z,"odd, the only folders I'm getting under application support for those 3 are all    AST.dat   files, regardless, big thanks for the other 4 bud, i've been after them for a while."
,gui_mp34,2012-10-17T16:24Z,"Works Like a Charm! just follow de instructions wiches are inside the INFOS.dmg file!! And dont forget to copy the keygen to your computer before running it, it will be necessary for BOKEH, EYECANDY, IMAGE DOCTOR and XENOFEX activation."
,Jrmcdeath,2012-11-02T22:01Z,"I think I am doing...no, I know I am doing something wrong.  In the INFO it says to replace the Config.ini files in the plugin folder.  There are no Congif.ini files.  Then when I went to ""Register"".  I used the install key from the keygen.  Clicked ""Other form of registration""  Copied the Code back into the key gen.  Copied and pasted back into the ""Registration"" and I keep getting a Red X and I am not able to click ""Next"".  I have tried it 4 times. LOL.  What in the world am I doing wrong?  Any help is most appreciated."
,enakajah1,2012-11-10T06:41Z,I get the same problem in OSX 10.8.2 keygen on the hard disk  follow instructions copy the details. Key is a huge string of letters and numbers and when copied into the registration block only a few come out and the red X.  Tried too many times. The patch works for the other stuff but this is not working on my computer.
