An Overview of the course:



Traditional old style piano lessons require you to play the melody in the right hand and chords in the left. As a result, the right hand is forever obligated to "plunk out" the melody while the left hand must carry the bulk of the chords. Using these old techniques, there is a limit to how full your arrangements will sound as you play, because your primary hand is taken up with the duty of always playing the melody.



Professional keyboard players learn to play complimentary PATTERNS "around" the melody and let a 2nd instrument (or voice) take the melody, staying out of it's way. This is where creative, full arrangements come from. This is what it will teach you.
