,EU_User,2012-10-14T22:22Z,"Is this giant RAR file PASSWORD PROTECTED? Probably.

In the past large RAR files posted by ANONYMOUS have always been password protected prompting the downloader to click thru his ads and NEVER get the password.

This asshole posts password protected RAR files.

This worm is posting RAR files inside RAR files, and a password is required to unrar the inner one. The password can be obtained by visiting a site that this anonymous asshole specifies, and then jump through many hoops that will probably install all sorts of crap into your Windows PC. "
