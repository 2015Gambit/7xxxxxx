,Z-Byte,2012-10-13T10:52Z,"Tried it and nothing popped up.  Then my computer started not loading windows.  Had to restart in safe mode and run a virus scan to fix it up.  I don't know if this happens with everyone, but I would go somewhere else, as I didn't see a single game file in this torrent anywhere."
[V],Shroo,2012-10-13T11:37Z,"There are no freakin' viruses in our releases. Otherwise, we wouldn't be VIPs."

The procedure entry point InitOnceExecuteOnce cannot be located in dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll

,warmonger3,2012-10-14T15:13Z,Anyone installed this on W7 64bit? I got a black screen possible lock up but I will work on it some more later.

Very good job TPTB!"

I hear the music only from the left audio channel..(the voice is ok.. problem with background music)"

,burhanjp,2012-10-17T12:20Z,"how to fix the files??
why are they not in rar??
help someone"
,LoganTD,2012-10-18T22:38Z,"sorry, won't seed this as i have already seeded another copy. would seed it if it included the PATCH, but no one will answer that question, so i have to assume it is not included. thanks anyway though guys (no sarcasm, sincere thanks)"
,LoganTD,2012-10-18T22:49Z,@burhanjp - use 7zip to unpack the files
,beermotoraxe,2012-10-22T23:47Z,"Screw you for making me install 7-zip just for this. WinRAR refused to open the multipart 7-zip file that this is. Got it extracted finally. Ugh.

Can't for TPTB to release the update 1. It's utterly obnoxious that the update is 3+ GB in size, just because of the fucking bloated cutscenes. Who gives a flying fuck about the cutscenes. 720p is more than enough.

Fucking PC games these days... bloated pieces of turds, the opposite of what one would expect from modern games. Judging by this trend, I guess 20 years from now we'll all be watching a 500GB still image from our monitors, pretending it's a game, instead of actually playing anything. And we'll receive 600GB patches to that image because one or two pixels are not quite the right color.

I may sound cranky but I am grateful deep down. Thank you for this release."
,beermotoraxe,2012-10-22T23:53Z,Disregard. I suck donkey cocks. The cutscene files are not to blame for the update size.
,MJD2008,2012-10-24T19:54Z,I hope this works... That damn KAOS version had me wanting to give up on torrents. Every time I try to get this game via torrents I run into so many issues. Will respond after I test this torrent out.
,MJD2008,2012-10-24T21:43Z,"I love you Shroo!!!!!!! Works very well, Also the installation process is fast and easy"
,RagzZZ007,2012-11-05T04:41Z,Hi...Im new to all this...but I downloaded your torrent and tried to follow the instructions...result: black screen comes up with TPTB cmd prmpt window etc...but still no game is available to me...what am I possibly doing wrong here?
,RagzZZ007,2012-11-05T04:51Z,Oh I should say Im on w7 with 64 bit
,nolf.rock,2012-11-11T09:23Z,"Hi Shroo

what happend to teamtptb is down since a week ...pls update what haapened"
,dt7ll5op,2012-11-18T01:50Z,"bad video reencoding: cutscene sounds are only in the left channel, looks like someone forgot to set audio as mono. voiceovers *during* cutscenes are in both channel which is an odd feeling."
