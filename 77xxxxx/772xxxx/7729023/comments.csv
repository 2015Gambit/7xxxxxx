[V],twentyforty,2012-10-15T21:52Z,"@critic89: When you asked for Entourage first time I told you how I have only last season and uploaded it - and explained how all other seasons are gone in HDD crashes. I promised to encode season 1 - and I did... Now you ask for season two....what is next? Redoing ALL seasons I already have lost once?
I cannot do that.

@xDEADx: I am quite sure how you are on my daily e-mail. If account you gave me before is dead (LOL) give me alive one.

@hardik860: It usually means nothing to me. I cannot order one. I am on mercy of others, who can. And what I have - I share. So...."
,critic89,2012-10-15T22:30Z,"sorry sir..i know but i asked u because all torrents present have size above 3 gigs for each season ..and it is only u ,who encodes in 1.5 gigs with hats off quality..
