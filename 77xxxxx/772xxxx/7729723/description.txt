This collection includes the cities and countryside in places such as; Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Greece, and many Great Cities in the rest of Europe. The filming was done on helicopter mounted high-definition cameras. The result is some of the most beautiful looks at Europe that can be seen without leaving your home. The aerial views are amazing, giving you glimpses of the popular destinations that cannot be seen from the ground. Whether highlighting the vast untouched natural destinations, such as mountain ranges, lakes, and rivers, or the cities that are mixtures of old and new architecture, the episodes give breathtaking views. Even if you have been to some of the destinations, you will love to see them from the air. It gives the landscape a whole new look.
