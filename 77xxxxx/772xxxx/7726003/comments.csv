,AmpolGold,2012-10-14T13:04Z,Thanks Footy - Legend.
,DeeinSouthAfrica,2012-10-14T13:05Z,Thank you. I have been waiting for the Skysports version as I so enjoy seeing them scurrying like rats around the place trying desperately to get any comment from the usually taciturn drivers. :-)
,NordicF1,2012-10-14T13:05Z,Thanks Footy
,digimike50,2012-10-14T13:09Z,"Many, many thanks!"
,leodj29,2012-10-14T13:16Z,Seeding for 24 hours
,drew1972,2012-10-14T13:21Z,"How are there 264 seeders in the swarm, and I'm not connected to any of them?"
,fxdwgtj,2012-10-14T13:22Z,"Hell yeah, footy has the best F1 torrents!!"
,Mixs,2012-10-14T13:27Z,"I don't want to connect my pc to the tv to be able to watch this, I also definitly don't want to watch this on my pc, all I want is to download the file to a usb stick or portable hd and plug it in to my tv or dvd or hdd box. My problem is that none of the above support mkv format only avi and mp4 so I would be greatful if there will be another file format that I can watch."
,.Leto.,2012-10-14T14:01Z,Mixs instead of asking them to use another file format maybe you could convert the file yourself?
,GhostRec0n,2012-10-14T14:05Z,BBC is just as good as SkySports but the bad thing is that Jake Humphery is leaving the team next year. i don't think there'll be anyone that'll be as good as him presenting the formula 1 on BBC. Don't even know if F1 will be on BBC next year since they only have 10 live races this year.
,nursemorph,2012-10-14T14:07Z,"@Mixs: You could always download the file and then use a convertor to change it to AVI or MP4!

Thanks for the download footy!"
,drew1972,2012-10-14T14:23Z,"Now up to 535 seeders in the swarm, still not connected to a single one!  WTF?"
,Mixs,2012-10-14T14:31Z,"478 seeders, yeah right!!??
Where are they?"
,jb4thewin,2012-10-14T14:35Z,Thanks a million footy! You keep making us happy :)
,pitonho,2012-10-14T15:21Z,Obrigado pelo post!
,novsan,2012-10-14T17:31Z,Thank you Footy
,deim0n,2012-10-14T17:40Z,"@Mixs: Try downloading tsMuxer or mkv2vob, .mkv is just a container so you should be able to change the file to a format compatible with your TV with one of those apps.

As usual footy your uploads save me from enduring the horrible SPEED broadcasts here in the states. Thx!"
,oldcarman,2012-10-14T17:41Z,thanks a lot buddy the effort is much appreciated..thanks
,GetTubed,2012-10-14T18:06Z,"Many thanks footy.

Please hang around and seed to the rest of the community. You can watch the DL and seed at the same time people."
,SerSpec-V,2012-10-14T18:13Z,I use mkv2vob so my friend can play this on his PS3. Takes 3 min to convert the whole race. Thanks Footy!
,rediffpiratebay4ever,2012-10-14T18:23Z,"tx, i really really hope that the warm up lap isnt cut out this time, like the last race completely threw me off suddenly seing those light go off"
[V],footy,2012-10-14T18:29Z,@rediffpiratebay4ever : The warm up lap is there.
,neingott,2012-10-14T20:58Z,"Gracias @footy

,Pakosan,2012-10-15T08:16Z,"As always, thank you very very much."
,rws_7_r,2012-10-16T00:08Z,"Footy, thank you from myself and I'm sure many, many more.  I created an account just to say thanks for these race videos.  You're awesome.  I think there are many others who would thank you but have no TPB login to do so."
