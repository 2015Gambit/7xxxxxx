,EseLiTTLe,2012-10-16T08:13Z,@mik3y07 I'm not sure man to tell you the truth but i think that was just another lost episode just like Mile High Killers which they featured on Season 7 instead of 6 like originally posted but i'll try to get back at you on that one.
,EseLiTTLe,2012-10-16T08:17Z,@mik3y07 Actually on the link that you posted look right under each season and it tells you which ones they left out on the DVD release
