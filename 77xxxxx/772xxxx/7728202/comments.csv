,garfiel,2012-10-15T06:39Z,"Hey feartruth are you trying to put in a submission on the quality of this submission by yify, if so a submission should have a rating or it's a submission that has very little submissive quality and may be an invalid submission.  Anyway all submissions on submissions by up loaders is welcome and remember to submit a + if you like the upload."

""you are my absolute favorite uploader!

Team YIFY seems to have earned ""trusted"" uploader status; A Blue skull for YIFY!"
