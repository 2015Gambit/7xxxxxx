,anthony0224,2012-10-14T15:16Z,"I never got an error, the game does run terribly slow though. Completely unplayable, and I'm on a quad-core i5 with 12gb RAM and 512mb GPU. I guess you would need at least a gig of vram to run this smoothly. FIFA 12 works great on my computer though.

Following benny86's instructions does work also for adjust resolution."

,blackochestra,2012-10-21T00:52Z,"Alright guys, this worked for me after reading what's been posted.

1. move fifa 13 to application folder

2. right click, show package contents

3. go to Drive_c/Games/Fifa 13/Game/fifasetup  and change the fifasetup_default.ini file so that the resolution matches your own (found in system profiler, graphics/displays) 

4. open the fifa 13 wineskin (found in the first folder you open when you show package contents)  and click advanced, then, using browse, go to Drive_c/Games/Fifa 13/Game and choose the fifa13.exe file

5. click test run and be patient, as start up is kind of slow

6. enjoy

i am having no performance issues. i am running snow leopard on an external hard drive connected to a 2010 macbook pro

if anyone can figure out how to run a ps3 controller WITH a working right analog, an explanation would be greatly appreciated"

,mister_pirate,2012-10-25T03:48Z,"The career mode crash is EA's fault. Nothing we can do with our systems to fix it. 

Best bet is to wait for EA to patch the PC version, then someone can update the Fifa Wineskin torrent with the updated game files. 

EA really fucked this game up mang. What a shite company."
,mbs42,2012-10-26T06:07Z,"I'm having the same random crashes in career mode as other people are.
 Anyone know if theres a way to fix this?"
,mister_pirate,2012-10-26T07:11Z,"@mbs42  - Read my post. It's EA's fault that career mode crashes. We, as the ""users"", cannot fix the issue.  The game is BROKEN - The programming is totally fucked, making it impossible to get past a few games or explore all the features without freezing/crashing. So be patient..once EA takes their sweet fucking time to come out with a fix, someone (or even I, myself) will create a patched version so we can play FIFA 13 on our Macs :)"
,blackochestra,2012-10-26T15:42Z,"I've found that mine crashes after about 3-4 games.

The start up errors, I'm pretty sure, have a lot to do with the resolution.  I tried running it on a mirrored second monitor without changing my original resolution (1440 x 900), and I got the error e0001 or whatever. Without changing anything,  I unplugged my second monitor and the game worked fine.

So if you're having a start up issue, make sure your resolution is correct

it really shouldnt make a difference, but it's touchy, especially without being able to access the fifasetup.exe file"
,123kid456,2012-10-27T18:55Z,I downloaded this (mac air) and fixed my resolution as per Slankee and my game runs ok but i can't see players or the audience in any mode ! pls. Help me!
