,sylver_shadow,2012-10-13T08:38Z,"Sorry, i meant top right of the torrent page"
,FastSLob,2012-10-13T08:44Z,"1. Choose a preview image (must not be bigger than 400pixels by 400pixels)

2. Go to bayimg.com

3. Upload the preview picture

4. Once you upload the picture you'll get a picture link like ""bayimg.com/m3xop3

5. Come back here and where it says ""Image tag from Bayimg"" paste the ""mexop3"" code "
[V],thegreenfrog,2012-10-13T08:46Z,"Go to http://bayimg.com

Upload the one picture you want, make sure you tag it correctly, adjust settings to 300 X 300 resolution and mark it offensive.

Upload it

Take the last digits ONLY of the resulting URL (what is after the slash) and paste it into the field that says:

image tag from bayimg

The URL should look like this: http://bayimg.com/aadopAAep

so you take only 

aadopAAep

and paste that.


Please make sure your picture shows what the model really looks like."
