The Living End is the self-titled debut studio album by Australian punk, 

rockabilly band The Living End, which was released on 12 October 1998. It 

was recorded at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne with Lindsay Gravina 

producing for Modular Recordings. The cover art, as described by front man 

Chris Cheney, is based on a photograph of a World War I all-female bomb 

factory. The album reached No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart and remained in 

the top 50 for 63 weeks.


The Living End had achieved mainstream success with the extended play, 

Second Solution / Prisoner of Society released in September 1997. It peaked 

at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. In early 1998 the related single, 

"Prisoner of Society", was released in the United Kingdom and, the 

following year, in the United States. Other charting Australian singles are 

"Save the Day" (September 1998) and "All Torn Down" (December). The sixth 

album track, "Monday", is The Living End's epitaph to the 1996 Dunblane 

massacre. In December 1999 The Living End was certified 4Ã— Platinum by 

Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 280,000 

units. In October 2010 it was listed in the book, 100 Best Australian 

Albums. As of July 2012 it is the band's most successful album.
