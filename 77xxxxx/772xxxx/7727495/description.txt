This is regular LOK: Defiance game with new "enhanced" autoplay menu.
Not REALLY "Collectors Edition", there is no such thing in LOK series.
Since regular (old) autorun/autoplay menu won't work within Windows Vista and Windows 7, I've created new one and add some "sugar".



Within autoplay menu, you have:
-complete soundtrack (3 cds/mp3);
-walkthorugh (PDF doc);
-biographies (PDF doc);
-wallpapers;
-cd/dvd covers;
-promo covers;
-patch v1.1;
-no CD/DVD crack.
