,2dimples,2012-11-14T06:57Z,"A9,V9,V9 I'm hooked on your downloads. StylishHal used to do Mkvs but now mostly Mp4s.  Mkvs take have as long to burn using DirectX-a big savings in time. Hope you upload ""Sleepwalk With Me""--been looking 4 it with no success. Thanks!"
,michaelrwatson,2012-11-17T03:23Z,But MP4 is a superior format.  MKV sucks balls. No ones cares if it takes you a few extra minutes to burn a movie. VYTO: Please create MP4 instead of mkv. Thanx.
