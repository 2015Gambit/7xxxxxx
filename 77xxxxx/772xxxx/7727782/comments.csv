[T],Ching_Liu,2012-11-07T20:01Z,"@lechampion - Thank you for your comment. Did you read these steps before install?

  1. Close internet connection. IMPORTANT

  2. Install application by running ""smartdraw_11E_TMJZG_setup.exe"" (Be sure you have admin rights on your system)

  3. Copy ""Keygen SmartDraw 2012-2013.exe"" from ""Keygen-Patch REPT"" folder and paste it in to the installation folder. It is generally ;
     C:Program Files (x86)SmartDraw 2013
      OR
     C:Program FilesSmartDraw 2013

  4. Run ""Keygen SmartDraw 2012-2013.exe""
    a.Enter a name
    b.Click on ""Add to list"" button.
    c.Click on ""Generate"" button and browse and select installation folder.

  5. Open internet connection - Open program and download all extra material that you need.

  6. For safety, use your firewall to stop internet connection of the  application and uncheck automatic updates. Don't update it. 

  7. Some security programs may give warning. It is false positive."

,ziffel323,2012-11-14T19:47Z,"I followed instructions very carefully, and blocked every .exe in the app folder in my firewall, and upon running the app, it shutdown and opened a webpage with a ""pirated version detected"". "
,ziffel323,2012-11-14T19:52Z,"update: apparently i missed an exe or two. i blocked those and all seems fine now. 

be sure to block all 11 exe's"
