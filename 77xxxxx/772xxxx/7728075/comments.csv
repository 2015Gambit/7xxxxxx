when you upload it, I think to myself 'this is love, man' :D"
,denys55,2012-10-15T03:54Z,These sceneline torrents are all fakes. They come out each week just before the real ones. Do not download them or you'll be sorry.
,anonynon6969,2012-10-15T04:43Z,"Hey, 
I got a partial dl before I saw your comment. I'm not behind a proxy/vpn or anything. how fucked am I? what should I do now? 

I've deleted it from my hdd, nothing more. "
,Furious_Child,2012-10-15T08:25Z,"Pretty sure denys55 is full of shit. Never had a problem with sceneline dl's before. 

What I want to know is, is the damned audio out of sync on this one?"
[V],sceneline,2012-10-15T09:21Z,don't read spmammers comment download and enjoy
,DngnRdr,2012-10-15T09:47Z,"see the green skull... it indicates a VIP, who are very unlikely to upload fakes.

I'm more inclined to believe these are real and that denys55 is a troll or just doesn't know how to work a un-rar the files.

But I'm waiting for 480p... though they seem to be pretty scarce these days."
,Rabbbi,2012-10-16T06:59Z,"sceneline rocks, always can count on them for high quality HD DLs, eff da spamfag"
