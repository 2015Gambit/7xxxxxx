,tracy09,2012-10-20T22:43Z,great quality  but movie has sound but there is no sound  for their voices 
,pranayama,2012-10-21T02:40Z,"Of course their voices has sound.
As usual, whenever something seems wrong with any file: Try it in VLC. 
(Works fine. Beautiful HD and crisp sound, thanks!)

If there still really seems to be a real problem playing it, get a new file. If you cannot find a new version, try XBMC as player.
VLC works for 999/1000 files and never ever needs any smelly external codec packs that krash into each other and turn the screen green. It just works. "
