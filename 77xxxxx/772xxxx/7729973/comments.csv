Thank you for all!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-10-15T20:57Z,"I haven't. I have a shitty internet connection. It's the ripper's bandwidth. You're welcome, bud!"
[V],rr-ne,2012-10-16T00:14Z,"my connection isnt very good. it takes me an average 2 hours to download a well seeded NFL torrent from you. and it takes me almost an entire day to upload 2 Gb. Very very slow. but cheap.

Btw, I am a Patriots fan, they lost again :/"

Thanks!!!

I am trying very hard to stay away from the sports news (results) today. When can you upload game 2 of the NLCS (Giants - Cardinals)?
"

,nikita566,2012-10-16T16:09Z,"THANKS

Trying to download the second game now (in both the 540 and 720 formats). No movement yet. 0 connections.
