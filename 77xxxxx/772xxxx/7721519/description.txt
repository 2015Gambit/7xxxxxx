'Mister O'

NBM, 2004, 32 pages

Written and Illustrated by Lewis Trondheim

Goofy silent one page gags crammed with little frames showing Mr. O, a round doodle of a man, desperately trying to get over to the other side, and just never quite making it. Everyone else can do it, why canΓÇÖt he? Will keep you in stitches for pages. More of Trondheim's genius at work!
