Summary
Release Date: September 18, 2012
Renaissance is a word with hope infused in every letter.

Since she was a child, Meg has dreamed of taking a promised trip to Florence, Italy, and being able to finally step into the place captured in a picture at her grandmotherΓÇÖs house. But after her grandmother passes away and it falls to her less-than-reliable father to take her instead, MegΓÇÖs long-anticipated travel plans seem permanently on hold.

When her dad finally tells Meg to book the trip, she prays that the experience will heal the fissures left on her life by her parentsΓÇÖ divorce. But when Meg arrives in Florence, her father is nowhere to be found, leaving aspiring memoir-writer Sophia Borelli to introduce Meg to the rich beauty of the ancient city. Sofia claims to be one of the last surviving members of the Medici family and that a long-ago Medici princess, Nora Orsini, communicates with her from within the great masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance.

When Sophia, Meg, and NoraΓÇÖs stories intersect, their lives will be indelibly changed as they each answer the question: What if renaissance isnΓÇÖt just a word? What if thatΓÇÖs what happens when you dare to believe that what is isnΓÇÖt what has to be?
