,beardcaps,2012-10-15T08:01Z,Is the last 10 mins or so messed up audio wise for anyone else or is it just me?
,beardcaps,2012-10-15T08:03Z,nvm I guess it's just about a minute or so around 42 mins in.
,djino123,2012-10-15T13:43Z,"thanks even if the last two episodes are shitty.
maybe the hole season is shit, of course it is 'cause the first story was over at the end of the first season, now they're trying to make a new story, bbut it's not so attractive."

,Jack0ff,2012-10-15T19:12Z,"i agree with djino123. i was way into the 1 season, but this one is just... so many eye rolling moments, now its just a joke"
,bryk,2012-10-15T19:19Z,"I used -0.2 delay on the audi at around 42:00, works well.

What a waste of an episode, BTW, it's like they're trying to kill time before they get to the juicy part and focussing on trivial crap; this one adds nothing of substance to the plot, the next one should be awesome."
,firexninja,2012-10-15T21:36Z,thank you!
