,tropicalcontacthigh,2012-10-16T03:27Z,Thank you for your patience good sir.
,coykoi,2012-10-23T04:28Z,"There's one seeder. If I can get it, I'll seed forever. Is there any way you can get their other work up in FLAC? I ripped On Letting Go into my own FLAC since it's what I have, but the Juturna FLAC torrent on here has 0 seeders."
,tropicalcontacthigh,2012-10-23T05:43Z,"I'll try to get most of cc's work by the end of the week.

And upload it mate, I'd love to get my hands on that album in FLAC. "
,coykoi,2012-10-23T16:03Z,I've never done it but I have a buddy who'd help me and then I'll link you to it here.
,Raiders757,2012-11-01T15:41Z,"Sadly still haven't been able to get this one.  People show up, but anyone seeding just can't seem to get through. Oh well, I'll keep on trying, as I really want to hear this album and my local music store has had some difficulty in ordering it for me for some odd reason."
,tropicalcontacthigh,2012-11-02T02:23Z,I'm just going to try to reseed it.
