aka: Spirits of the Dead (1968)
aka: Histoires extraordinaires (original title)

The three loosely adapted Edgar Allan Poe  stories in Spirits of the Dead
- "Metzengerstein," "William Wilson," and "Never Bet the Devil your Head"
- are about exactly that. Though they are each helmed by a different director,
the continuity and quality that flow through them are perfectly consistent,
creating an experience that is well-told, layered, and haunting.
