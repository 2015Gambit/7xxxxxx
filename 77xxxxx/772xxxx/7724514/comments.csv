,myeviltwin,2012-10-14T15:49Z,Hello Hello!!!! Return of the mac :) Welcome back bro.. had bookmarked you and out of the blue thought to check if you are back and voila here you are.. You have an excellent taste in movies and then you do them in small sizes.. Good to see you back.
,culo_mahogany,2012-10-16T22:40Z,"I'm having the hardest time of my life trying to sync subtitles to this shit.  Not to mention, all the subtitles are BULLSHIT!  Why the fuck is this distributed without GOOD, SYNCED English subtitles?  It is utterly useless because half the goddamn fucking movie is ITALIAN!  I'm so fucking sick of this shit.  VLC is fucking me over syncing the subtitles.  I've wasted half a day trying to get it right!"

I tried to clean them up but decided to wait...got to turn up eventually.
I even downloaded a cam copy thinking there would be subs on a cinema release that I could copy off, but there were none...really weird."
