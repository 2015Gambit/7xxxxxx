DJ Calvin Harris releases the collaboration with Florence Welch entitled "Sweet Nothing" as the fifth single from his third studio album "18 Months", due for release in the UK on October 29th via Fly Eye Records! This sounds like another monster hit for Mr Harris. Florence's almost-divine vocals, and Calvin's uplifting electro-dance beats make an exceptional combination.

[i][b]Lyrics:[/b][/i] 

You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
 And, with a word all my love came rushing out
 And, every whisper, it's the worst, emptied out by a single word
 There is a hollow in me now

 So I put my faith in something unknown
 I'm living on such sweet nothing
 But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
 I'm living on such sweet nothing
 And it's hard to learn
 And it's hard to love
 When you're giving me such sweet nothing
 Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
 You're giving me such sweet nothing

 [Beat break]

 It isn't easy for me to let it go
 Cause
 I've swallow every single word
 And
 Every whisper, every sigh
 Eats away at this heart of mine
 And there is a hollow in me now

 So I put my faith in something unknown
 I'm living on such sweet nothing
 But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
 I'm living on such sweet nothing
 And it's hard to learn
 And it's hard to love
 When you're giving me such sweet nothing
 Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
 You're giving me such sweet nothing

 [Beat break]

 And it's not enough
 To tell me that you care
 When, we both know the words are empty air
 You give me nothing

 Uoooh
 Uoooh
 Uoooh
 Nothing

 [Beat break]

 Uoooh
 Uoooh
 Uoooh

 Sweet Nothing

 Uoooh
 Uoooh
 Uoooh
 Sweet Nothing

Thanks
