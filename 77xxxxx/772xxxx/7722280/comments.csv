,crabgrass08,2012-10-13T08:22Z,"keep 'em coming... they sound very nice, although I will say I'm a little disappointed that they didn't use the original analog masters for all of them... it would have been nice to have them all be exactly the way the original vinyl wa mixed.  It would have been the first time on CD for some of them in their original mix... Gail says “None of the new releases are ‘sourced’ from the Ryko releases and although many represent the digital masters mostly as you have come to understand them, many do not!,"" so why not just restore them all to the original analog? and they shouldn't have inserted the 'Big Leg Emma' single on this one."
,WasAtWoodstock,2012-10-13T14:30Z,"I find: ""...distribution deal with Universal Music Enterprises to release 60 of Zappa's recordings. The roll-out kicks off July 31 with 12 albums, with another dozen recordings to be released monthly through the end of 2012.""

60!! That's a long wish list."
