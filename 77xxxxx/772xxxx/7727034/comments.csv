[T],micron66,2012-10-14T19:26Z,"thanks for this,hoping for Ryanne next.

Also,if i may make a suggestion,it's usually better to break up such large uploads into smaller torrents,the simple reason being that such torrents will be well seeded,secondly ,lot of people usually don't download such large torrents that are all zipped/rared inti 1 single file."
,old-dominion,2012-10-16T22:42Z,"Yeah, that.  But please, more of this great material. Thanks."
,mad3963,2012-10-18T12:05Z,Please seed. Stuck at 62.4%. Really want to see the contents of this torrent.
[T],micron66,2012-10-20T13:58Z,"after 1 week,no one has yet been able to download this 100% yet,breaking such large torrents into smaller one's makes sense."
,babycarrots,2012-10-20T18:40Z,"No one is seeding. I've uploaded 19.84GB of the torrent so far... 
No matter how small the torrent, some people are givers, and some are takers... "
[T],micron66,2012-10-22T09:27Z,"@babycarrots 

true,some people never seed back but anecdotal evidence shows that if this torrent was broken into say 1-2 GB sized torrents more people would be seeding,look at your Roxy (Shakinit) Site Rip torrents,smaller size,more seeds."

Ryanne's first upload is up on ""KAT""

I've been having issues with trying to upload on TPB so I uploaded hers there. And the rest of her rip will also be there soon... "
,babycarrots,2012-10-26T18:53Z,"I think I'm going to be uploading with ""KAT"" for now on, TPB makes it to difficult to upload anymore..."
,babycarrots,2012-11-01T07:51Z,Ryanne is finally uploaded...
,war76,2012-11-10T18:02Z,do u judith or brynn by the way thanks
