Really appreciate your work just 30GB is a lot for the kids when I'll probably have to convert it bitesize anyway to fit on tablets.

Just to clarify ""I'm only asking"""

I'll wait for a smaller version to come out."
,Efreak15,2012-10-12T17:36Z,"This release is incorrectly titled.  It should be: 
Ice.Age.Continental.Drift.2012.1080p.BluRay.AVC.DTS-HD.MA.5.1-PublicHD.  "
