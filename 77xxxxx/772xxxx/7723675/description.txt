The legacy of the critically acclaimed Giant games
already continued by the successful "Train Giant"
highlights now the popular theme Agriculture up to a new
level in "Farming Giant", presented by UIG. In the best
tradition of the giants-series the player will get a
first-class business simulation crafted with a lot of
details. The player will build farms, maintain and
upgrade his properties

Whether farming or ranching, the experience covers all
parts of agriculture. With the right strategy and the
courage for expansion, international success is
guaranteed. A huge game world, a variety of production
processes and trade opportunities and various game modes
as well as achievements provide long-lasting fun
Furthermore the agricultural giant impresses with wide
range of management options (from seed to distribution
the players takes decisions by himself) and an extensive
fleet of vehicles. A detailed skill tree provides RPG
elements and offers the opportunity to specialize more
and more!
