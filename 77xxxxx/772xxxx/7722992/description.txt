These are all free from the owners. I know that some areas around the world restrict access to downloading in english and only in their language, such as skype for asia. I have been told that you can not download skype in english over there. So incase of anything like that, i threw up a great collection of free setups for the softwares. There are security scanners and other great things to download :D enjoy !
