Notes: 
Bill B.'s 1st gen reels. These reels were his safety copies made from a root tape source (the one that can be attributed to the very first Destroyer Vinyl release). Bill had at least 2 sets of reels, one a listening copy he also dubbed copies off of for other people and this safety copy that sat unplayed for close to 30 years before they were finally digitized here. This is a high resolution 24/96 copy of the transfer with some minor volume corrections not applied to the original posting of a lower resolution copy of this transfer.
