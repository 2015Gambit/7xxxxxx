,Hackerpcs,2012-10-13T20:29Z,Hi my friend and thank you very much. I'm on RGH 15574 and as you know I don't do anything online. Does disc 2 contain anything that I can do offline or is it does LIVE stuff?
,leonsolary,2012-10-13T21:34Z,Written and spoken language in Portuguese?
,Tegra3,2012-10-13T22:11Z,Thank You. I'll DL both discs just to make sure the single player doesn't ask me to pop in disc 2. This happens rarely but I am not taking a chance.
,najwan,2012-10-13T23:08Z,thank you
,farr3ll,2012-10-13T23:51Z,"@Hackerpcs.. This is the multiplayer disc which includes multiplayer installation, forge (map designer), spartan ops (co-op DLC) and theatre mode (gameplay video showcase of sorts, live only). Unless you plan to system link or wait until/if xlink kai builds a Halo 4 server then this is not much good to you!"

,DiNozzaur,2012-10-14T01:06Z,"Anyone who downloads this should be ashamed. Over 300 people have worked hard putting this game together for over 3 years, and people like you come along, with no shame, and upload/download this game, not worrying about paying $1. I hope anyone who downloads this gets banned, as you have disappointed the whole of the halo community."

,ghjkfd,2012-10-14T04:25Z,"It's the real thing. There are two discs, Disc 1 is only campaign while Disc 2 is only Multiplayer. For those of you with Jtags, you can't make it into a GOD file, you have to extract everything. There is a ""Content"" folder which has the downloadable content needed to play multiplayer. Without it Multiplayer will not work. So all you have to do is move the contents of the folder to the appropriate place ""HDD1/Content/0000000000000000/"""

,dunit80,2012-10-14T11:41Z,@unknown I always have the same problem everytime I try downloading a game that hasnt hit store shelves yet. And I have a 15 MB connection and they usually only download at 1-100kb. Doesnt matter how many people are seeding it either. And while this game is 2 discs. If you decide to download it. I wouldnt mess with disc 2. Disc 1 is the campaign and disc 2 is all the multiplayer stuff.
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-10-14T11:46Z,"Also at you all complaining about seed...

,agonn111,2012-10-14T13:39Z,do I need an Ihas burner to burn this game or truncate in imgburn and play? 
,crumfret,2012-10-14T13:41Z,"How do I get it to stop looping from the Prologue to the main menu? I tried click the Mission ""Dawn"" rally point alpha but It say I need to get the downloadable content?"
,MeTaLhEaD79,2012-10-14T13:42Z, You only need disc 1 . You can download all content from disc 2 from the marketplace for free if you have disc 1. It's much faster to get it from xbox live. 
,crumfret,2012-10-14T13:43Z,So I need to download stuff from disc 2 to play the campaign on disc 1?
,MeTaLhEaD79,2012-10-14T13:54Z,"@crumfret No. Disc 1 is the campaign
disc 2 contains Multiplayer installation, Forge, Spartan Ops and Theater Mode which can be downloaded for free if you have disc 1. "
,crumfret,2012-10-14T13:56Z,Ok then why can I start the first campaign mission? It tells me I need the downloadable content when I try to load the mission after the prologue
,crumfret,2012-10-14T14:00Z,Is it a bad burn mabye? It says I failed to load content.
,humza100,2012-10-14T14:55Z,"Hi, can someone please post a simple guide on how to play this on an xbox, will it need to be modded? or can it simply be burned to a DVD? or can i plug a USB into the xbox and play it on that. I really want to play this but dont want to mod or open my xbox. Thanks"
,admiralwindowlicker,2012-10-14T15:32Z,"I was thinking the exact same thing as humza100:

Do we need a JTAG Xbox 360 for this to work?

Can play it off a USB pen?

What disc type to we burn it to?

Is there a decent guide we can refer to?"
,TatShi,2012-10-14T17:06Z,"If you haven't done the research to find out how to play backup Xbox games, then don't bother downloading the game, you're wasting your time."
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-14T18:10Z,"BEST looking Halo game to date, and best sounding halo game as well. Finally the weapon sounds are great, I have always thought the weapons sounds been weak in halo games, not in this one. 343 are to me better developers already. So far this game gets 4.5 of 5 from me. Loving it."
,bthanhawk022,2012-10-14T18:14Z,The game is real. Dont believe folk talking about its fake cause they cant get it to work. Finished the first 2 missions on the campaign with no problems. Probably will finish it by the end of the day. Using xkey with firmware !.26. Not dumb enough to test it online though. I can wait for Nov. 6 for all that. Thanks for the upload Mr. Anonymous.
,P_Greezy,2012-10-14T18:44Z,"Ive heard that even if you play offline you will still get flagged for a ban, because once you log in xbox live there is a log that shows the date you first played the game and microsoft will know and ban you, so im warning all xbox live users, if you wanna play this game online on Nov 6 dont play at all till verified in abgx, but for ppl that always play offline can play as much as they want, hope this helps."
,admiralwindowlicker,2012-10-14T18:52Z,"TatShi - assuming you were responding to my request, asking questions was my research.

confirmed working on xk3y running firmware 1.26

and next, to all those trying to put the shivers up everyone, if you claim to have ""heard"" or been told that playing online will lead to a ban etc, then post a source to back up what you are saying....

secondly to all those people claiming it;s slow, then i suggest you need the upgrade,it's being seeded like crazy at the moment, and i downloaded it between 6-8 MB p/s because i actually have good internet."

,heckseth9,2012-10-15T07:40Z,"idk if this question was already addressed, but I dont want to look through the comments considering ive already seen some spoilers.

I am trying to burn this game to a verbatim DL DVD+R disc 8.5GB. 
I am using IMGBURN and apparently the file size is 8,334 MB and the disc is 8,152 MB

Gives 2 options, to overburn - write until end of Image
or
Truncate - Write until end of disc.

Should I do either of these? pretty sure they would have the same outcome (game wont work)
or do I need to buy a bigger disc, am I doing something wrong?

BTW thanks so much for the upload. Bought the game already but I really want to forge early so I wanna get this working!!! Thanks and hope you can help!"

,xtalviper,2012-10-16T21:34Z,"@Assassinprofessor - no, didn't make it work.  To be clear, no I did not truncate, because I use the IHAS burner.

I think maybe a bad burn might be the issue tho. I was curious if that's what was causing the ""downloaded content"" error because I noticed the drive was accessing when it was doing so, so I tried installing to the HDD, and sure enough, it died with ""clean disk"" at some point. So I will try and burn again."
,The_Human,2012-10-16T22:13Z,@Shinobro If you have daemon tools then I've found that it gives an I/O error while burning. I found that out after experiencing your problem and after uninstalling daemon tools and system reboot everything worked.

,powerofthemonk,2012-10-17T03:42Z,"Alright these are the settings I used to burn with.

ABGX360: Go to Options, Tick (check the boxes) the following: check/create .dvd file, check stealth verify stealth passes, check/fix video padding, use colors, check for anydvd style game data corruption, check for updates, include the CSV Check game partition CRC when needed. And, because a patch (DMI and SS) have not been released yet, Tick disable all online functions so you don't accidentally play online and get banned.

Now go to manually patch or extract file, tick Patch even if stealth passes, this is so when the game is released and the DMI and SS are in the data base, you can just re-patch, re-burn and can play online. Now continue to Auto Fix

Tick Trust 22 v2 angles, untick Adjust 22 v1 angles 359... Tick Fix C/R Table if data is invalid, tick Adjust angles that deviate more than 3 degrees from their CCRT targets, now continue to rebuilding.

Tick Default Method, and for Misc, go to SplitVid, and select add it if it doesn't exist or isn't valid. Select Language to your language, And I prefer to leave y console's region code to the default, but you can add yours if you want.

IMGburn settings: I have an iHas liteon C drive and have burned many XGD3 games with success. I basically just changed nothing, whenever i mess around with buffer and everything I don't burn good games. The only thing I did change however was to always burn at 2.4x

This is a great game, always unplug your Ethernet cable or wireless adapter while playing just incase. 

I am running this on a LT 3.0 Console with an Ihas C revision drive. If you love this game as much as i do, buy it!"

,turntable83,2012-10-27T14:08Z,Fuck! Reading through all you faggots problems trying to play this game wasting money on DVDs and special burners. Quit being penny wise pound foolish and get a damn X360key. Copy ISO to usb hard drive or flash drive and plug in and play.

,Syn253,2012-11-02T21:42Z,Which disc is 4 player versus split screen?
,Smallz94,2012-11-04T00:34Z,"Hey guys, I am afraid to play online on the day of the release because what if Microsoft starts finding people who has this game for free and who has a modded xbox. You think it is really SAFE to play online patched with ABGX Stuff on the releasing day? I know it is a stupid question but i need to know if Microsoft is still finding people who is getting this game for free when it is release. Thanks :) "
,xTDAxTmAc135,2012-11-04T04:01Z,@smallz94 ayy I usually play the day it comes out but this game they are really going to be checking for ppl so maybe the day it releases if I was you I would patch it one more time to get that last download from abgx to make sure its safe then you should be good hope this helped 
,aliceisbi,2012-11-04T22:08Z,I don't think I'll download this at all. I did fully pay off my preorder for Halo 4 the other day and it just comes out in like 2 days. It's well worth the wait. :)

,RastaBay,2012-11-06T03:31Z,im all out of disks :( gotta get a new pack just for playing halo 
,Quake591,2012-11-06T08:09Z,Ran it through agbx and burned it with an iHas and all that like everyone says. Running fine online so far. Just posting in.
,SinSnoop,2012-11-06T13:38Z,It'd be nice if some of these leeching asshats would seed already -. - my DL speed has been flat-lining at 30kbps while my upspeed is 10x that. I don't mind spreading the love but it'd be nice if I actually had a copy myself ;)
,fanfasnight,2012-11-06T14:25Z,"Game works great on Xkey...but its still not verified on abgx. My brother started playing online yesterday with halo and today he was banned, so be carefull.....later "

haven't had a single problem with this"
,Sergeant_Fox,2012-11-09T00:31Z,"Glad that abgx verified this version of the game right away because this game on its own didnt pass any of the stealth checks, hope you waited for verify before burning. 

@acid-rage 
ya that seems really cool spending $100 when discs are under $1 a piece lol xD"
,rjs10,2012-11-09T21:02Z,just :) downloaded seeding at 1.2mb/s
,Muff1911,2012-11-09T21:42Z,"Good upload, its slow but it works."
,Zoink540,2012-11-10T04:33Z,"@Sergeant_Fox

Good point derp! And your console mod and hardware was done for free? No? Hmm so you paid probably somewhere around $100 for a mod, and now all those CDs and sometimes the burns dont work whereas XKey = $100, easy install, and no disks. Dookie."
,eugenybak,2012-11-10T13:43Z,"This torrent needs more seeders.
People please."
,Linard,2012-11-13T01:16Z,"TO:acid-rage 

I agree Xkey is the best no more wasting money on
dvd's and every game work 100%

I just wonder when I play online do I have to run Isos via abgx and what options I have to pay attention to?"
,kxyr,2012-11-14T23:48Z,Works great even turnicated! Thank you!
