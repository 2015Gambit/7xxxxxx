"When the door between the spirit world and ours is opened, the stuff of nightmares becomes reality". That's according to the introduction of this series which dramatizes the "true" stories of people who have been haunted or experienced a haunting. In this docu-drama, the actual people involved recount their stories on-camera, as the frightening events of their stories are re-enacted....

First quote in opening of show
"Between the world we see and the things we fear, there are doors. When they are opened, nightmares become reality."
