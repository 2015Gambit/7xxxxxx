An ingeniously simple and fully-illustrated book for crafting toys from objects found around the house.


This clever guide focuses on fun, homemade projects using materials anyone can find around the house or that can be purchased for a fraction of what a commercially-produced toy can cost. Using everyday objects from cardboard tubing to paper to clothespins, readers will discover how to make such projects as:

ΓÇó A milk carton balloon boat
  ΓÇó A rubber band banjo
   ΓÇó A cardboard tube kaleidoscope
     ΓÇó An embroidery hoop tambourine
       ΓÇó And more ........

Perfect for parents and teachers, these projects enable families to spend less while keeping entertained. Because fun doesn't always have to come in a box-sometimes, it's the box itself.
