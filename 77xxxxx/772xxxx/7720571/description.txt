engine trouble, it lands on Earth. It happens to
be Halloween and it happens the invaders are only
about 4 feet tall. As the bumbling aliens wander
around the countryside, they are taken to be children
and they make friends with two children, one of whom
is the daughter of the sheriff. As their troubles mount
(it's difficult for five aliens to conquer a world),
they begin to give up their plans of conquest, but then
there is that nasty killer robot. (from IMDb)
