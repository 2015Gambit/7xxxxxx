Once upon a time a bad queen was pretending to be the most beautiful woman of the kingdom. But her young step-daughter, Snow White, was really better...
The rage of the bad queen became very very hard, so she decided to eliminate the sweet Snow White for ever! She sent a man-hunter to kill the girl, but he did not execute the misfit, because the beauty and the innocence of Snow White, touched the heart of the man, so he let her escape. Running in the woods, she was lucky to find refuge in the house of seven adorable little dwarfs.

Oh well, you know the story... but you've never seen the luscious Snow White get THIS friendly with her 7 little friends!
