Tear Gas (Rare original 1971 UK stereo vinyl LP on the red Regal Zonophone label designed by Storm Thorgesons Hipgnosis.
Awesome the second album in the discography of the band without a doubt belongs to the leading edge of the heavy British play This Scottish band had a very heavy, dark, but clear sound. Catchy, specific compositions; paramount guitars (Zal Cleminson - after years of such Nazareth), a few modifications (Love Story - Jethro Tull, Jailhouse Rock - Elvis) and the occasional organs Hammonda in the background ... Soon after, the group adopted a proposal for Alex Harvey and became the "Sensational Alex Harvey Band".
Additionally, a live bonus - now with a new leader on vocals!
