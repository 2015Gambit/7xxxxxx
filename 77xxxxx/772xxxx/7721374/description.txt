Tommy and his wife have hosted a picnic at their place. Most of the guests drank way too much, including Rachel's boyfriend. Tommy's wife has driven all the drunk people home, which leaves Tommy alone with Rachel. She is helping to clean up, but when she gets Tommy alone in the kitchen, she wants to get in Tommy's pants and she doesn't care if he is married or not.
