The Tramp struggles to help a blind flower girl he has fallen in love with.

City Lights is a 1931 American silent film and romantic comedy-drama written by,
directed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin. It also has the leads Virginia
Cherrill and Harry Myers. Although "talking" pictures were on the rise since
1928, City Lights was immediately popular. Today, it is thought of as one of
the highest accomplishments of Chaplin's prolific career. Although classified
as a comedy, City Lights has an ending widely regarded as one of the most
moving in cinema history.
