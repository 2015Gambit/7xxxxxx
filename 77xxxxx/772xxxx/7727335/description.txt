Synopsis:
Indiana, 1818. The Moonlight falls through the dense woods that surround a cabin, where a nine-year-old Abraham Lincoln kneels at the bedside of his mother suffering. She has been attacked by something that the locals call "Milk Sickness." My child ... whispers before dying. Later, the child realizes that his mother's fatal illness was actually the work of a vampire. From that moment, the child begins a diary, and aims to become a master of mind and body, with one objective: To undertake a path of vengeance that will lead him to the White House.

While Abraham Lincoln is wide winner of the election, due in large part to its defense of the Union and the liberation of millions of slaves, his valiant fight against the forces of evil has remained in the shadows for years. Until Seth Grahame-Smith stumbles upon the secret diary of Lincoln.
