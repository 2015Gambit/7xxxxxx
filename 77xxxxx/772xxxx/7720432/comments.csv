Great Movie, real good picture & audio. BUT - pretty crap subs that need to be turned off, they're so annoying. (They translate (badly) everything - English AND Italian!) Who needs the distraction? So, this link will take you to another AbSurdiTy supplied sub just for the Italian. 
Thanks again, hiest.
