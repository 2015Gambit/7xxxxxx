The great talent behind the new generation in Europe, the Dungeon series, A.L.I.E.E.E.N. and Mr. O, pours his heart out in funny snippets of everyday life. His paranoia, little annoyances, big annoyances, chase of rainbows, love of comics, travel impressions from around the world, dealing with kids, being a kid: itΓÇÖs all about life as we know it. A collection from his comics blog that expands his palette with full color painting, one can only be awed at TrondheimΓÇÖs uncanny sense of observation and relate to all his experiences closely. Another touch of genius by one of today's best and most influential comic artists.
