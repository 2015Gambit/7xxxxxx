,Demonsniperhd,2012-10-16T22:39Z,does anybody know when the week 23 is coming out?
,snahfu,2012-10-17T20:07Z,"iono but after the videos come out, it takes a little less then a week for it to appear on here"
,fiddydent,2012-10-22T10:11Z,"week 23 was released last week, anyone upload it please"
,Demonsniperhd,2012-10-23T20:42Z,cant find week 23 anywhere?  no more project go???
,fiddydent,2012-10-24T01:08Z,im willing to donate a few coins to someone if it means that we can continue getting project go...
,T4,2012-10-26T00:53Z,week 23 is abducted by ufo
,dubzar,2012-10-26T03:07Z,lol. Week 24 is out by now. This dude was getting them via tinydl and they haven't posted the new episodes.. If anyone has a subscription and wants to rip the videos then download DownloadHelper plugin for Firefox.. Pretty easy. 
,Demonsniperhd,2012-10-26T20:49Z,so sad no more pirating project go. missing all the fun  
,fiddydent,2012-10-27T03:00Z,we need to setup a fund - someone to trust - setup a way to shoot them like $1.00 each person or something small and liberate it! most likely wont happen but it doesn't look like we are getting it anyway...
,cata_simi69,2012-10-27T12:06Z,"yeah man let's make it happen, if you know how to upload a torrent on tpb, seed and have a resonable bandwidth, I would gladly contribute 1$/ month "
,DavidYub,2012-10-27T15:28Z,"Thank you very much for this video! Helped a ton. 
Looking forward for the next video!"
,DavidYub,2012-10-29T17:11Z,When does the next video come up?
,dubzar,2012-10-29T23:07Z,@DavidYub Whenever someone with a subscription decides to upload it. 
,fiddydent,2012-10-30T07:42Z,Project Go...ne lol
,DavidYub,2012-10-30T21:05Z,Which is never it seems :(
,cata_simi69,2012-10-31T13:12Z,"Come on someone!  Who knows how to upload a torrent on tpb, seed and have a resonable bandwidth!"
,snahfu,2012-11-01T09:07Z,what project go week are they at right now?
,nickcorona,2012-11-01T20:54Z,24
,Demonsniperhd,2012-11-02T00:59Z,i have really great bandwidth and i know how to upload too.  but i dont have subscription to project go.  also it is expensive because $10/month.  even netflix is $8/month.  so if anybody else is ready plz upload it.
,Baidaix,2012-11-02T15:31Z,"It's funny how you guys say ""it's too expensive for me, so someone else please upload it"". It's only 10/month, and it costs the same for you, me, or anybody else. This is not pokemon, so why trying to have all the videos? stop being so OCD, go out there and apply what you've learned from past videos.
Also, Project GO must be one of the lamest PUA products out there in a quality/hype proportion."
,cata_simi69,2012-11-04T23:32Z,"Is not lame, @Demonsniperhd make a bank account and i will donate 1$/month ( if you don't get it read above )"
,DavidYub,2012-11-05T20:26Z,Any news on project go?
,snahfu,2012-11-06T19:12Z,dead
,DavidYub,2012-11-07T00:01Z,Shame.
,btsobo,2012-11-07T12:02Z,"No it is not dead, you're wrong. Just no one to rip the videos and upload them here. Anyone?!? Would be lovely :)"
,fiddydent,2012-11-10T00:21Z,"if newer videos aren't uploaded within the next 2 weeks or so, i'll purchase a subscription and start doing it. gotta keep this thing alive"
,theemfan,2012-11-10T09:37Z,Here's a direct link to their videos. You need to set the referer to http://www.simplepickup.com. Use Tamper Data + Firefox for that.
,btsobo,2012-11-10T12:13Z,"@theemfan: Can you explain how to do that more clearly, I mean - step by step?"
,btsobo,2012-11-10T12:21Z,"@theemfan Can you explain how to do that, step by step?"
,snahfu,2012-11-11T00:28Z,"i check back on this everyday... haha

man im desperate"
,DavidYub,2012-11-11T02:27Z,"Snahfu, you are not the only one :)
Fiddydent, we are looking forward for that! Thank you my good man."
,poptart1,2012-11-11T08:16Z,"Tamper Data
NOTE: You need to set the Referer to http://www.simplepickup.com or the videos won't load. You can use Tamper Data to do that.
"
,fiddydent,2012-11-11T10:56Z,"tamper data isn't working for me...

,moonstar14,2012-11-11T16:41Z,Thanks poptart1.
,Surovirusov,2012-11-11T17:07Z,"For you All who dont know how to use temper data HERE is the tutorial.
just google it to download it,install,restart firefox and ur done.
That was easy part,here is the job that needs to be done:
here are the links of videos:"
,themismatch,2012-11-11T19:42Z,"For some reason, it won't let me post the Pastebin link. Sorry about that. You can google up for the direct Vimeo links they use on Project Go. 

1. Get Firefox
2. Install Tamper Data
3. Open Tamper Data
4. Copy the Vimeo link you'd like to watch
5. Click ""Start Tamper""
6. Paste the Vimeo link in the bar and hit enter.
7. It will ask you if you want to edit, you hit edit/yes. (I don't remember the exact phrasing)
8. Change the Referer field to ""http://www.simplepickup.com""
9. Enjoy.

Once again, it's Pastebin slash 7SWCgcwm1"
,btsobo,2012-11-11T20:35Z,What to type in google browser to find that vimeo links?
,btsobo,2012-11-11T20:42Z,"haha ok I can see now, you must type in pastebin + 7SWCgcwm1 without the ""1"" in the end :)"
,snahfu,2012-11-12T02:54Z,"does anyone else not see the ' Referer field'?

it says connect... cookie. but no referer"
,snahfu,2012-11-12T02:56Z,"http://i.imgur.com/yX8Ev.jpg

this is what i see."
,themismatch,2012-11-12T03:40Z,"Okay, so I decided to make a script to automatically download these. @snahfu, add the Vimeo links you want to download to a text file (one per line).

Here's a link to the script:
https://github.com/themismatch/Project-GO-Video-Downloader

If it doesn't show above, just Google ""github project go video downloader"".

That spoofs the referer. Looks like Tamper Data's being stupid."
,dubzar,2012-11-13T00:50Z,"Why are you guys complicating it so much? Easier way to do it.. lol. 

1. Go the SimplePickup forum and sign in.
2. Go to any open topic.
3. Go under the quick response and click ""Go Advanced""
4. Paste the link to the body as if your going to reply to the topic.
5. Click ""Preview Post"". http://i.imgur.com/pfy0c.png
6. Press link now and you should have access to the video on Vimeo. http://i.imgur.com/ocM0O.png

No worries though.. I'm sure if no finds the Vimeo links then they will be uploaded here either way.. "
