,LuxiusDK,2012-10-16T18:22Z,Does SmartSteam work side-by-side with Steam or do I have to say goodbye to my bought games? ^^
,Infi2,2012-11-18T14:31Z,"It doesn't work anymore. ""Steam needs to convert the game content for ""Magicka"" to a new, more efficient format. This willďťż require an internet connection and a few minutes time"". "
,vingadorjr,2012-11-18T14:59Z,"WARNING! This is not the cracked version of the game. This version installs Steam and to run the game you need to log with your account to verify if the game was originaly aquired on Steam. It doesnt have a crack inside, only original walktroughs for the the game itself. In the end, its a scan to buy the game. You are all warned."
,Infi2,2012-11-18T15:02Z,"LOL, nope. It installs SmartSteam, which is cracked version of Steam."
,Infi2,2012-11-18T15:20Z,"LOL, nope. It installs SmartSteam, which is ""cracked"" version of Steam. It will not ask for anything. And... only DLC this package don't have is recent ""Grimnir's Lab"". Also, there's 1.4.10.0 patch out, so it's a bit outdated. However, it's still possible to play via Tunngle or Hamachi."
