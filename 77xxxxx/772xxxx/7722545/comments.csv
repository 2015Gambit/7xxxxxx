,Nimh,2012-10-13T08:08Z,"Hey, thanks for this!   Question though - why is it 60 FPS?  Shouldnt it be 30 FPS and therfore half the file size?   

1.45gb seems huge for 720p"
,Prabath1234,2012-10-13T08:35Z,"@Nimh

Are you kidding me bro, Have ya ever seen on 60fps,no one cares about 29fps anymore,That's why I come here everyday for this cap.
The real life motions.
If you care about the size there are lot of crappy caps everywhere.but if you watching a fight you might not want to miss a single details."

I also provide this: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7722733
A 480p xbox/ps3 compatible mp4 release.

My broadcast company uses 60FPS to air any resolution not interlaced. Plus, the fluidity and transitions are beautiful at this rate, specifically for fast-paced scenes like MMA, Boxing, etc."

No haven't seen 60FPS yet - still downloading. 
I imagine that the motion is more fluid. Which would be great for a fight. Didnt know it was that much of a difference.  

I have seen short 10sec clips of 60 FPS but the motion looked strange in some way.   Like it was speed up but slow.


ALSO - why are comments delayed?   It says comments: 7   but Prabath is post 4 and thats the latest i see.  "
,Rexeus,2012-10-13T10:36Z,"Bad rip, the fight scenes are useless, no sound and lagging. Get another rip."
,Rexeus,2012-10-13T10:39Z,"My bad, rip is GOOD, I needed an upgrade on the ceodecs."
,rs3rooster,2012-10-16T01:27Z,do not download. gives you the bluescreen of death around the 7:00-8:00 mark. which causes your computer to lock and freeze. which made me lose my poker game. running windows 7 64-bit home premium . you have been warned.
