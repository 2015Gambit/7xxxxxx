,dahaka47,2012-10-13T18:42Z,"nosTEAM, PLEASE DON'T PACK YOUR SHIT. I already have DLCs, I only need an update and crack, and because you have a bright idea to pack it all together, I need to download ~550 megabytes again?

Next time think with your brain, not your ass. Cheers."
,Marikhen,2012-10-13T18:55Z,"Does this version require Steam like all of the (crippled) ""Skidrow"" updates/releases for Borderlands 2?"
,diamondhead880,2012-10-13T19:06Z,bioshock gets out more 2 days dont forget to upload him
,OmniNegro,2012-10-13T19:08Z,"For any of you with doubts, cast them aside. This works perfectly. The only thing you will need to edit is the Skidrow.ini in your B2 > Binaries > Win32 directory. And the only thing to change there is the name it uses. And that probably does not matter if you are only playing single player and have no existing saves when you install. (Remember to put your name in quotes like the language is.)

I too hate when things are made into a executable. I greatly prefer simple archives and manual installation. But it is this way so even morons can figure it out. (Fuck those morons. They can either pull their heads from their asses or buy the game and the DLC.)

Nonetheless, I thank you for this nosTEAM."

Any1 knows why?"
,qrty5,2012-10-14T00:50Z,"This works perfect for me. However has anyone figured out how to get unlimited Golden Keys again? Editing the .ini file no longer works with the updates and results in corrupted saves. 

Would it be possible to memory edit it with cheat engine?"
,ZombieSix,2012-10-14T01:09Z,works good.
,vargth,2012-10-14T01:34Z,Not working for me on windows 8 x64.Same thing like skidrow's releases.Nothing happens when i click on launcher or the game exe
,OmniNegro,2012-10-14T02:09Z,"@suslaiks2 
You can apply this on a clean Skidrow install, or any update thereof.

@qrty5
The easiest way by far is to install the game *WITHOUT* any patches, start any character with the original keys set to 255 and get to the first save location you can after pressing i to pull up your inventory at least once to see the message confirming your keys.

Then just close the game, apply this patch and start your new character with 255 keys.

If you want more than 255, then I will quote Hammerlock: ""You are sad and I have no desire to speak to you.""

I may even call you a Bonerfart."
,paperboy666,2012-10-14T03:56Z,"same problem as vargth, game not launching"
,1Wisher1,2012-10-14T03:58Z,"I seem to be having a problem. My character, the newly created mechromancer, isn't getting her ability opened, that is to say she's leveling but it isn't registering any skill points accumulating. Did that happen to anyone else?"
,paperboy666,2012-10-14T05:35Z,"okay i reinstalled everything and now it works flawless, thank you!"
,Zachkey,2012-10-14T07:04Z,"*sigh* I don't know if I can trust this torrent, but the comments and seeders made me try it out. Hopefully I can trust you guys and the uploader enough to my computer! I'm not trying to insult you, so I'll be back with results."
,Zachkey,2012-10-14T07:10Z,"Okay, I installed it. I was skeptical at first when a .reg notification came out; but it was fine. Then I booted the game up and seems well from here! Thanks a lot. Will comment later to let anyone know of anything."

,Lakender,2012-10-14T13:01Z,Can anyone play with tunngle with this patch? I can't
,dannyboi18,2012-10-14T14:41Z,"When i applied the update, i got the same problem as when i first downloaded the game (the game closes) so I applied the windows 7&8 fix which worked before. Now when i open the game, it closes at the 2k video and says filename 0x0 not found or something :O"
,residentwitcher,2012-10-14T14:51Z,this torrent works great aslong as your game isnt modded saves or using the golden key glitch.thankyou
,residentwitcher,2012-10-14T14:53Z,as for it saying dlc is corrupted its because you probably modded the game
,Kingsanx,2012-10-14T16:02Z,worked perfectly on skidrow's borderlands 2. Lv15 mechromancer... i must say. this class is pretty OP. lol loving it
,OmniNegro,2012-10-14T16:45Z,"Hmmm. This or the Skidrow version with a few extra nonsense DLCs added?

I am on the fence. This version works. I have yet to test the Skidrow version."
,dannyboi18,2012-10-14T16:54Z,am using the Skidrow version!
,OmniNegro,2012-10-14T20:38Z,"Alright, I tried the Skidrow version of the same patch. It works equally well. In fact there is no noticeable difference for myself. 

My advice is that if you are already using this, wait until the Skidrow version is needed for something before you bother to download it.

The only noticeable change is the memory ranges are different. So if you made a list of memory locations for money and Eridium and such, you will have to remake the list after patching to the Skidrow release.

And yes, any corrupt messages are because you did not backup your WillowDLC.ini before you cheated. It flags *EVERYTHING* as corrupt when you mess with that after the very first patch.

Backup the file before you edit it. Then when it is time to apply a patch and crack, you can restore it and you will not lose anything. (I.E. if you edited it to give you 255 Golden Keys and then changed it right back to the default it would not take any of those keys away from you.)"

ah, sorry lol didnt know you were running diff version, i had skidrow 1.0.3 and used the tunngle forums update 5 with mechro and then copy and pasted the pirate booty dlc, if you already have 1.1.1 from mechro DLC you can just copy and paste the new Orchid(Pirate Booty) into the DLC folder and dont need a crack since my game version was already 1.1.1"
