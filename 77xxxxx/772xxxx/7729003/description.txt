This is a zip-file with 815 very old Macintosh games.
All games are considered abandonware, freeware or shareware.

Each game has been separately compressed inside Mac OS.
So you can unzip the file in Windows/Linux without harming the file format of the games.

Each game is located in a separate folder with description, screenshot and manuals if available.

There is a txt-file in the torrent with a complete list of the games.

Enjoy!
