[V],footy,2012-10-14T12:59Z,"@gosensgo : try another player like media player classic or GOM player, there is no problem with the file"
,gosensgo,2012-10-14T17:20Z,"thanks footy. it's very strange that vlc could do one file just fine then mess up another. tried with Windows Media Player (I know right?) and it works! wonder what happens in vlc that freezes the video portion of the file... thanks again, and always appreciate your uploads!"
