The title is unfortunate as it seems to be a concoction from the Marketing Dept  convinced  that tags such as 'Secrets' and 'Empires' will make the documentary a best-seller. In fact, this is a literate and  well researched production with incisive and expert commentary from scholars such as Colin Renfrew, Ronald Hutton etc. Each programme at the very least is interesting while that on early religion  is fascinating.

A DVD rip with excellent sound and vision.(Kindly seed as I am running out of  space)
