,hardbit,2012-10-15T21:43Z,"1 - download winrar, install and extract the files
2 - download daemon tools, install, then double click the file u extracted before
3 - install the game
4 - there will be a virtual drive created next to your C: drive and such. search it. it has the name and icon of the game on it. right click and select explore/open. then search for a folder named SKIDROW. open it, and copy every file into the folder where u installed the game. it will pop up some windows asking if u want to overwrite the files. say yes to all of them.
5, 6 and finally 7, if u enjoyed playing the game, buy it ;)

that should do it ;)"
