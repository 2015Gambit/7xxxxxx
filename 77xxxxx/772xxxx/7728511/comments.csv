,Deathrock_Sean,2012-10-15T12:49Z,"Hey, snorsic, why don't you abate your attitude, sew up your mouth and desist? I'm tired of you noobs running around whining like little bitches. Have some respect for release groups."

,AVC-33,2012-10-16T17:25Z,"Little bit higher bitrate would be nice ""customer service"". Why not target ""release group industry standard"" ~1,5 GB file size? That leads typical ~50 minutes episode lenght approximately little bit below 4000 Kbps video bitrate, which yields certified 720p@23.976 -HD-results.

Under 3000 Kbps bitrate, like this, is too low for 720p@23.976 AVC-packed video. Lego block effects, unsharp digital grittynes and general shittynes is getting started to show its hairy bit-saving -ass too much on any reasonable sized screen size. CanÂ´t be talking about general HD-class -picture quality no more."
,wflatts057,2012-10-16T19:03Z,"A big THANK YOU to protoyu for the upload.  My wife and I love this show!  Excellent quality on my modest A/V equipment.

I'm kind of a n00b at this, but I've got to say something to all the haters that post negative shit on here all of the time.  Maybe if you're constantly having issues, the problem may be on YOUR end.  Check your shit out first before flaming somebody else just for being nice enough to share shit with you.  What a bunch of unappreciative, selfish fucktards you are!  If you think you can do better, then let's see it!"
