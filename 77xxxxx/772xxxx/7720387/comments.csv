and i see a few have 30 percent now
so I leave it run

by -200ms can fix this in minutes using avidemux.org
time shift and leave video and audio set to copy or vlc track sync
pays to learn this vid editor tool can fix audio problems quickly without recodes

i would of fixed it but didnt notice busy doign other stuff anyhow"

,SLAiN121,2012-10-13T02:06Z,"LoL thanks psspss, love your work... I use virtual dub to sync up avi's... it only takes a minute or so...

If anyone can seed s02e04 it would be much appreciated I'm stuck at 40%...

Regards, slain."
[V],psspss,2012-10-13T03:13Z,"I wrongly called a few weeks back s02E06 which is episode 4 that did have seeders back then

not sure which one your using

and yes avidemux.org is the more windows version of
virtualdub.. both have their pros and cos
but avidemux is simpler to use

IN the end I used avimux-gui (freeware) to fix audio sync
its also a  header fixer (can fix aspect) but also makes sure to
align on interleaves when avidemux etc dont do it or fail to do it grab it and have a play

start it.. right click in top field say add
browse to avi.. click on it and hit the massive big
button directly under it..

then click audio and on far side click -200
then click save and click the avi name you loaded
and what I do is just temp add A in front
to change the name and save it..
then check it and if good delete orig and
rename new one by removing A again

BUT I LET SOMEONE RESHARE THEIR FIX VERSION
TO THOSE TO SCARED TO LEARN SOME BASIC
VIDEO TOOLS"
[V],psspss,2012-10-13T08:36Z,"looks like its closer to -300ms

im amazing why peiple still upload out of sync and bad aspect files before fixing them..

but at least someone is doing some source as scene
arent doing it well"
[V],psspss,2012-10-13T08:37Z,"i think it drifts more
as it plays though... prob where the ad breaks were"
