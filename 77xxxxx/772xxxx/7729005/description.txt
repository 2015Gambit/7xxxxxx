Filming for the BBCΓÇÖs Wartime Farm series started in September 2011 and continued until the first airdate in September 2012.

The programme focuses on the Second World War and all aspects of domestic and farming life of the period, using the farmhouse, farmyard and fields at Manor Farm as their setting.

The BBCΓÇÖs historic farming series started with Victorian Farm which aired on BBC 2 during 2009. It was filmed at Acton Scott in Shropshire.

The second BBC 2 series. Edwardian Farm, was filmed at Morwellham Quay in Devon and was broadcast in 2011.

These two programmes proved so popular that the third in the series, Wartime Farm, will be on air for eight weeks from September.

There is a book about the series available from the Manor Farm shop.
