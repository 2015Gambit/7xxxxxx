Days after his village is destroyed in a bombing raid, Dastaguir and his five-year-old grandson Yacine jump from a pickup truck and take their seats at a desert crossroads, where they wait and wait for a ride to a nearby mine. Dastaguir is charged with the horrifying task of notifying his son that the young man's wife and mother are dead and that his son, Yacine, is now deaf.
