,murtaza786,2012-10-14T06:21Z,can someone please comment how good was the movie? i ve been downloading many movies lately and deleting them after watching the starting and finding it boring. Please dont advise me to watch the trailer as most of the trailers these days give the entire movie in a summary which is pathetic...
,namvc1,2012-10-14T07:39Z,"So murtaza ... you trusts some strange persons judgement on how good a movie is ?? download and check yourself. 

Cheers for the Up :)"
,murtaza786,2012-10-14T10:12Z,"@namvc1: no man, but the view of few people can give a general idea whether the movie sucks or it is worth watching"
,TokinBC420,2012-10-15T08:43Z,"why does it seem that all scene4all movies have an imbd link for some garbage nick cage movie called stolen, you guys need to fix that.
otherwise great up as always"
,TokinBC420,2012-10-15T08:44Z,"And yes for the people who like to troll i did see B.Torrents post with the proper imbd link, but its just annoying"
