fyi, while i did my best to retain image quality, the 2 stargate sg-1 movies are recorded using pretty ""poor"" cameras in comparison to high end productions, numerous scenes have such as thick layer of grain and look mostly like they were originally filmed with a poor quality 1080p camera or a midrange 720p one. Leaves a lot to be desired, but there are numerous ""clean"" scenes that shine.

Again thanks to all the seeders willing to bare the load while I do my best to continue provide... Enjoy as always."
