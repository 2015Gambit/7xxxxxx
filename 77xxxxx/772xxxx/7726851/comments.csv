This will be the TOP vista 32 bit torrent because you will completely freak after you update to NOW , with no crack at all. SEED SEED SEED "
,johnplayerson,2012-10-14T19:26Z,"This OEM vanished a few years ago when the bay was offline and others took heed of takedown notices. Its the only fully activated OEM available. If it gets blacklisted so do hundreds of thousands of innocent users, so its good forever!!"
,johnplayerson,2012-10-15T04:15Z,"Please!! No reason to not help seed. You can always right click on the torrent file and go to bandwidth option, to set upload limit on this file so you can download lots of other stuff. Every little bit helps!!."
,johnplayerson,2012-10-15T10:48Z,"To those that still don't know. After updating you get everything. Service pack one, service pack two. The whole nine yards updateable to Today. Next year its updateable to 2013. Download windows activation kernal is no problem. You get 100 percent authentic license with this iso:))))"
,johnplayerson,2012-10-16T17:11Z,"Hey look it's NEO, and i think he's starting to believe!! The best torrents come from anonymous folk lost in the MATRIX:)), not from hackers, looking for status credit!. "

This torrent by someone else appears to be a windows 7 preactivated oem iso. that requires no crack or loader. Note one person enquiring why it was activated without him using a loader!!! You need dual layer dvd to use it but its worth a look. im downloading now.

,repayfriendship,2012-10-30T01:02Z,"Dear God, you created Adam & Eve so you can do anything.  Please bless me with a good life to the highest extent possible where there is no better life!  It seems Microsoft Windows 8 Professional is out officially on disc.  I ask that I purchase it in full when my mom gets the chance to come back from her break.  Could you make it so that I do not want from her all the time?  She works so hard and I already have the official Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium (french 32-bit edition).  Whatever as long as it is a good life for me.  You know best because you created all that is and ever will be#!!  Thank you Jesus Christ."
,Humpie,2012-10-30T02:59Z,Who gives a shit about Vista?
,johnplayerson,2012-10-30T14:44Z,"Apple is giving away its operating system LION for twenty bucks. Windows 8 is a renamed windows 7 with little benefit. It is released solely to try and stop apple from stealing a lot of microsofts customers, hence they too will have windows 8 available cheap. 

Lots of people like vista, most use it to triple boot and dual boot their pcs. This issue is a pure fully licenced version requireing no crack. making it easier to dual boot without invalidating the first install of windows. 

I was wondering how long it was going to take for lameass trolls with nothing to offer , and nothing to say to stop by and leech a few comments, like they leach everything else, offering nothing to the community.

,johnplayerson,2012-11-05T15:26Z,"If your not aware please note, that yes, you can add languages to vista, and you can have multiple users set up, each using a different display language. Just need to do a search for adding languages to windows vista. The windows 7 iso referred to previously contains all the languages on the disc as well. Use trial version of ultra iso or power iso to extract the languages , Can be found on the pirate site. Plus its an excellent copy of windows 7 64 bit for future use. IF you remove all the language files, that iso can be burned on a regular dvd. "

,sedgepac,2012-11-08T04:10Z,Been looking for this. Thank you!
,pystol3,2012-11-08T06:29Z,What have I done wrong. I installed it and it still requires activation. Says the OEM product key is invalid and won't open windows.
,pystol3,2012-11-08T06:35Z,Forgot to mention that I changed the date - over a month in advance to test it.
,johnplayerson,2012-11-10T18:17Z,After 2000 downloads we have someone that cant install vista. Obviously you done something wrong as this is the only torrent with preactivated OEM vista. You dont need a key. You can even use this version to upgrade to windows 8 on the cheap. 
,johnplayerson,2012-11-12T22:40Z,"After downloading and installing you can go to Microsoft and by windows 8 for 40 dollars and get media centre free as an add on. 

Just click on buy windows 8 with your vista, and download the file from Microsoft and get your key. Make an .iso file of the download and then install now. You will be up on windows 8 legit. 

If you want to dual boot vista and windows 8, do not install from iso you downloaded. Download msdn copy rtm. Intall to different partition using your key and you will be up on legit vista and legit windows 8 pro with media centre. 

Even Microsoft can never tell as you are 100 percent legit. "
,marknightro,2012-11-14T01:13Z,How can you set this disk up to make boot disk? I tried using same codes as XP and Vista but when i restart it it says you cant find NTDRL.exe or something like that?
,johnplayerson,2012-11-14T10:38Z,"This disc itself is bootable. If you want to install from a restart boot, and install to a partition you need to go into your bios and set your dvd rom to boot first , before your hard disk. If you need to set up partitions to install to first i recommend partition wizard from mintool, as you can create partitions from inside windows, or from a bootable disc which it allows you to create.

Another great torrent. Get the limited time offer free media centre key from Microsoft, and fully activate this iso of windows 8 with media centre. Nice big whole which gives you legit install with no cracks "

32 bit windows 8 with media centre. Get your key at Microsoft quick "
,RaddekRaptor,2012-11-18T16:29Z,I also cannot get this to boot. Even with multiple computers and the DVD-ROM set first. Bad burn ?
,TEDZ,2012-11-21T10:33Z,Aw man.. Don't tell me that I spent 7 hous stealing my neighbors Wi-Fi to steal this vista and it won't boot for me either! I gotta get a job!
,Superusr,2012-11-23T13:42Z,Where are the drivers for this build?
,johnplayerson,2012-11-24T06:03Z,"Where are we at now, if your a total dumbhead you shouldn't be downloading this stuff. Drivers are not always automatic, and you must sometimes get your own loaded from the manufacturer web site. This is true for windows 7 ultimate as well. |You should have a copy of your lan driver first, this will allow you to get all your other drivers via the operating system. Are people total dumbasses, do you really think that every driver for every application for every brand of pc is going to be on the install disc? 

Either we got more total lamers that just want to drop doe head comments to scare people away from torrents, or total idiots who shouldn't be downloading what they don't know how to install. "
,johnplayerson,2012-11-24T06:20Z,"Yes, asshole, you must of had a bad burn, so you rushed here to make a comment and ask, before even trying to redownload and burn again to see. 

A lot of times a simple redownload and reburn fixes issues. Windows 8 downloaders were getting a lot of driver missing messages, not allowing install, which were correctable by a redownload and or reburn. 

If you got uefi, almost everyone gets a cant install to this disc error. Under uefi you don't need to install from a boot, but can dual boot and install from within the previous operating system. This corrects that issue. Sometimes you just need to get down and do searches and try and learn something before, trying to bash torrents for you inability and frustration. That's at least what I do. 

I didn't run to the windows 8 torrent and bash it, nor did I run to windows 7 torrent and bash it. I put a little effort in and solved it on my own. "
,johnplayerson,2012-11-24T19:58Z,"Most of us remember the leak of windows ultimate Lenovo oem that happened immediately after release to manufacturing. Because the leak was released so soon, Microsoft and Lenovo had time to correct the leak as models were not shipped out yet. If the smart ass the made the Lenovo leak, waited a year before releasing it. Everyone could have had legit activated windows seven ultimate without need for loaders. 

If you never heard of the vista leak from dell. It was the big dell leak of oem vista. This oem leak from dell disappeared from torrent sites everywhere as the pirate bay was down for a while and everyone else complied with notices of infringement and did takedowns. 

Many a year later I noticed it was missing and thought seeing as I had it, why not reintroduce it to the world. This is what you are downloading here. IN the case of this leak, Microsoft and dell were unable to blacklist the oem right away as they did with Lenovo. The leak was too late and too many legit users had bought machines with the dell oem. 

Again this is the oem you are downloading now. I had it up on another site and they are still taking it down through notices. Anyway FYI. "
