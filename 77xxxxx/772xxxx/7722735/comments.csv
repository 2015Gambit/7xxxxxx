,Mixs,2012-10-13T11:35Z,How am I supposed to watch this? Stop using this file format.
,runealdo4,2012-10-13T13:15Z,"It's a 720p format, stop complaining about stuff you don't know anything about."
,dirty_big_bjelke,2012-10-13T13:15Z,Seed you lousy no good freeloaders!
,Rubyconn,2012-10-13T13:31Z,"This is excellent, albiondean! You're piercing the heavens!

@noclu
The build-up is a separate torrent. Please check albiondean's uploads.

@Mixs 
Get with the times. If you're using Windows try mpc-hc.

,Bali2011,2012-10-13T14:10Z,Thank you!
,leodj29,2012-10-13T14:12Z,Will seed until the race comes out
,minhthai911,2012-10-13T15:06Z,"FAKE 60fps, the real frame rate is 25, converted to 60fps by duplicating frames.

Waiting for 50fps version from footy"
,frostbite88,2012-10-13T15:40Z,thx alot
,bubanj,2012-10-13T17:30Z,thanks a lot! 
,rc90029,2012-10-13T18:06Z,"+1 minhthai911 thanks for the heads up
And BBC coverage sucks anyways compared to Sky.
BBC's Eddied Jordan just spews out BS 3/4 of the time and Coulthard is just a bloody cyborg.  "

[V],albiondean,2012-10-13T19:26Z,Your right the real frame rate is 25fps but so are 50fps caps fake. F1 is broadcast at 25fps whether on $ky or BBC. if i decide to cap the race i'll post it as 25fps.
[V],albiondean,2012-10-13T20:53Z,"Eddied Jordan is a funny bloke, makes me smile every time i watch him, those that don't find him funny have got no sense of humor. 

BBC still better than those greedy $ky shits, who want people to pay for premium channels but still load their content with ads."
[V],albiondean,2012-10-14T00:51Z,"I  hate most of you arsoles on this site, so tomoz for the full race you will only get half."

[V],albiondean,2012-10-14T01:20Z,I cant wait to piss most of you off tomoz. lol
,jswalski,2012-10-14T07:19Z,Please post the korean race after its done!

??????????????????????????

REALLY?! No way is it! The only loss was Brundle. Jake is much better than the Sky front man. Considerably! It's a shame he's leaving at the end of this year."
,tomskull,2012-10-14T12:15Z,"Great quality, 720p at last :)"
