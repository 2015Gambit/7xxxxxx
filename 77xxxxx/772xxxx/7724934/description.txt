In October 2002, 41 Chechen terrorists took more than 700 people 
hostage in a Moscow theater, demanding an end to Russia's war 
against their homeland. This gut-wrenching documentary takes you 
through the endless hours of waiting, a seemingly miraculous 
rescue operation, and the ultimate tragedy, that could have been 
avoided had adequate medical personnel been on the scene after 
the stalemate ended.
