I mean I'm really interested in the underground rock, punk or metal side of Korea's music, because we can never hear about it. As always you are the best source for a thing like that. So I ask you most sincerely that upload an edition with Korean rock/punk/metal or the mixture of these. Thanks in advance!"
,Atlasy,2012-10-19T21:04Z,"Also I really appreciate you hard work and I really love your compilations, they are all awesome! 감사합니다 for that, and I really hope that you'll be able to do what I've requested. 

Sincerely, 

An avid fan of your work"

A rock edition is already in my plans, but it may take a while. It's not very easy to find k-rock, but there are some really good korean rock bands. Some of them are presented in Vol. 9, so I recommend searching the songs and albums of the bands of your choice.
But definitely we will have an edition in the future with a lot more rock."
