,extinguerim,2012-10-14T21:36Z,"We need to set up a paypal account or something for Jari. 
Actually, Blast deserves something as well for investing and believing so much. 

Shit I'll buy it anyway in five days :D"

Jari is the most greedy metal artist in the world already. He has milked a single album for 8 years? Then he comes up with a 40 minute album because he split a 80 minute album in two, aiming to make double the money. What a greedy bum. 8 years for 1 album and he wants to make double money from it after touring for 8 years on 1 album.

There is a 1-man band called Sorg Uten T책rer with 12 free albums released in 5 years. Doesn't even accept donations."
,JeffMiller1984,2012-10-17T20:43Z,"Time II better be a lot better, there are 3 songs on this and 2 intros, Darkness and Frost is essentially an intro to Time. I really enjoy the 3 full length songs, but I'm not sure I'll fork out the money right away for what is really an EP or long single. I might wait til it drops to like $5. I expected more after waiting 8 years."
,QuaintBelial,2012-10-17T22:02Z,"Unfortunately, this fucking sucks. Thanks for uploading it, but god damn I am disappointed. "
,nomansky,2012-10-18T15:56Z,"I didnt really like the album at first. But it has grown on me and after the 30th listen today I love it. 

The reason he waited so long was because he had writers block. Jari doesn't release anything unless he is completely satisfied with the quality. 

Thanks for the upload Knazi, I bought the album as well, just the release date is later in the US :(. "
,Dr.Caplan,2012-10-18T16:52Z,"Waiting 8 years doesn't make you greedy...he wasn't even touring or anything most of the time. It's a little hard to make money when you're not releasing or touring. They ran out of money a couple times, either way thanks Knazi."
,Dr.Caplan,2012-10-18T18:18Z,"Oh yeah and he split it into 2 albums so we won't have to wait until next year to listen.

Also wtf are you complaining about, you're pirating it not buying it."
,BlutfleckKind8976,2012-10-19T07:54Z,"Vielen dank Knazi. Ihre torrents sind immer wieder erstaunlich, und laden Sie sehr schnell."
,ghostrx,2012-10-19T16:41Z,Thanks!
,Hawkehearteater,2012-10-19T22:34Z,"I have been waiting for this for far too long. I can't wait to actually purchase this, but it isn't released here for a couple more days yet. It's going to be fucking amazing."

,sensuallettuce,2012-10-22T07:19Z,"Album rocks, everyone who keeps talking shit about it doesn't know the amount of effort and talent needed to create an album like this. 

I bought the album, do yourself a favor and do the same! "
,Danitar_scjs,2012-10-30T09:12Z,Why are all of your uploads of this CD so damn quiet?
,Thulcandra,2012-11-07T16:47Z,Thanks for upload =)
