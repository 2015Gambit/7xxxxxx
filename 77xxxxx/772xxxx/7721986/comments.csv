,shane3900,2012-10-13T06:24Z,resolution is 1920x 800. black bars at top and bottom would have been removed. so please don't complain that its not 1080p. it would be 1080 if bars were left in.

It's amazing how much attention ""stupid"" gets in any sort of online forum.

I'm a big fan of removing the bars."
