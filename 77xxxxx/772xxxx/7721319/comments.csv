Bolt 2008.

I have a 3 year old grandson who saw this movie once and is now driving me crazy asking to watch it.

I have downloaded 2 different encodes already and neither will work on my WD media player. 1 of them was a 450mb 720p -no pic or audio. The other - audio is so far out of sync even on my pc it's unwatchable. 

Every encode of yours has always worked beautifully so it won't hurt to ask. If you have your reasons I'll understand, as there doesn't seem to be much of a demand for it. 
Thanks"

@janedoe50: I did 272p back in the days, but I will encode 720p today and your grandson will watch it."
