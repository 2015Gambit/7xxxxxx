Btw, from his self-critic:
""My own work does not make sense. A mess ... my writing, stupidity and ignorance all the way through ... the intention was bad, anything I’ve done has been an accident, in spite of my spoiled intentions the preoccupation with stupid and irrelevant matters ... but my worst mistake was the stupid suburban anti-Semitic prejudice, all along that spoiled everything. ... I found after 70 years that I was not a lunatic but a moron. I should have been able to do better. ... It’s all doubletalk ... it’s all tags and patches ... a mess"" !!!..."
,indoeuro,2012-10-15T01:26Z,"Thanks for your gratitude, but the quotation which you attribute to Pound is highly dubious.  He never published anything to that effect, and the words you cite were attributed to him by Allen Ginsberg, a jew.

In short, the words you cite are hearsay from a biased source, and are contradicted by the documentary record.  Pound may indeed have made some self critical remark, but it is highly doubtful that it corresponds to the words Ginsberg put into his mouth.  

Pound was an outspoken man.  If there was anything important about his views he wanted to correct, he would have put it in writing."
,gaudier,2012-10-15T16:40Z,Thanks a lot. I agree: Allen Ginsberg was a liar.
