Ezra Pound is one of America's best known and least read men of letters. His poetry - universally acknowledged as a high point of modernist verse - has sometimes been overshadowed by his political speech, which was so controversial that it caused him to be thrown in an iron cage and later an insane asylum.  Ever since, Pound's political views have drawn more condemnation than comprehension, but they are vital reading for those who care about America's fate, and hope for it a better future than to serve as the military wing of... well, let us say, of interest groups whose interests are not those of the American people.
