NOTES: Swesub was made by Klemens with some tips and help from BkX.
In this release, we used CCE to convert the movie which is
completely new to us. But after some ifs and buts, we got it
all working. We can not promise that the text is great but we
have made an effort to follow the swesub rules. The film has
quite fast dialogues and since we are pretty much beginners
we hope you understand if we missed something. Enjoy!


PLOT: Set on an island off the coast of New England in the summer of 1965,
Moonrise Kingdom tells the story of two twelve-year-olds who fall in
love, make a secret pact, and run away together into the wilderness.
As various authorities try to hunt them down, a violent storm is
brewing off-shore -- and the peaceful island community is turned
upside down in more ways than anyone can handle. Bruce Willis plays
the local sheriff. Edward Norton is a Khaki Scout troop leader. Bill
Murray and Frances McDormand portray the young girl's parents.


BIG thanks to BkX for all the help!
