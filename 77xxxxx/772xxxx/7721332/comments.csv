,Chupacabra321,2012-10-14T18:17Z,"Ok Im DL your torrent cay多use Its the fastest one right now, but, could you be more specific on how to Install since Its a repack, I mean do we need some special program to unrar? does Include the saving game FIX?

Instructions for the Noobs would be good.

Thanks dude."
,host92,2012-10-14T18:42Z,@Chupacabra321- no there is no need for special program like winrar. just run setup.exe and install the game and it has latest crack fix of reloaded so there will be no problem about saving the game.
,ECworld,2012-10-14T21:47Z,"so far the fastest download. other skidrows running at about .3kbs currently, this one averages about 3Mbs....will post again on content when installed"
,Chupacabra321,2012-10-15T01:14Z,Thanks for the advice. Im already seeding. I will check this as soon as I burn some files on my HD.

,ECworld,2012-10-15T02:50Z,"Game works great for me. Clean install, ""no viruses"" meaning dont believe everything your AV says. Remember its a cracked game. 
Win7 Ultimate, 64bit

@Skuffz  -  Try the usual, running as admin, compatibility mode, etc. Worst case try a clean install. "
,Chupacabra321,2012-10-15T03:50Z,"Ok, this works great, I dont know why is people having issues with this. If you have Nvidia GPU theres already an update. 

Thanks again."

,TheJabler,2012-10-20T14:46Z,Downloaded in like half an hour and installed in less than 20 minutes. Worked great last night but now the game is glitching at the Boyle party. It says it cannot save and then freezes when I pause. Anyone else have this issue? Will continue to seed.
,hawkeye-mihawk,2012-10-28T03:29Z,"how do i get it to stop say ""There was an issue saving the game""..its really frustrating me.. :/"
