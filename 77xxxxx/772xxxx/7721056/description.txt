
Dragon Age Origins Mods Pack [FEarBG]


::: What Is This ? :::

This is my own Dragon Age Origins Mods package. To use it you must have the DAO game installed and updated to v1.05. I will also recommend to install the Awakening expansion and all official DLC's.

This package contains unofficial DLC's a.k.a mods, mostly downloaded from Dragon Age Nexus website.


::: Important :::

This torrent contains only game mods, but not the game itself. If you don't have the game installed, I recommend downloading this : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6241032/

If you can't see the link, just search for "Dragon.Age.Origins.True.Ultimate.Edition-Reece56364".

::: Installation :::

I guess everyone already have installed Dragon Age Origins with all DLC's, Awakening expansion and Patch 1.05

01. To install the "DAZIPs" mods, just add them with "daupdater.exe" like you do with usual DLC.

02. To install the "Override" mods, just extract every one of them in your override folder : Documents - BioWare - Dragon Age - packages - core - override. Someone will ask to overwrite existing files. Give them "yes to all". When you're done you should have about 20 new folders and some files there.

03. Some of the mods use on specific file for settings "chargenmorphcfg.xml". I made one that is compatible with all. He is located inside the "02. Override" and then "chargenmorphcfg.xml" folder. You need to copy that "chargenmorphcfg.xml" file and place in inside "Documents - BioWare - Dragon Age - packages - core - override".

04. And finally, you have to use the "DAO-Modmanager" ("03. Managers" folder) to install the last 3 mods. Just drag the "*.dazip" files inside the "Installed DAzips" box. Then drag the "*.override" inside the "Installed Overrides" box.
