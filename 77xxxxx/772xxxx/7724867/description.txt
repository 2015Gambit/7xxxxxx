Announcing netBloc Volume 4: Soundtrack for the Coming Revolution. Another gem packed collection of net audio culled from all over the world. One from ccMixter, a couple from Jamendo, others from various netlabels... all equally terrific.

About the blocSonic.com netBloc series:

Many things are currently happening which are allowing for netlabels increased importance in the world of recorded music. The mainstream music industry's reluctance to trust music fans to the music they purchase. Their belief that music should be licensed for each use. Their dependence on Digital Rights Management scams to police their music. The explosion of the number of netlabels. The increase in variety and quality of the music offered by netlabels.

With this mountain of netlabel music available, the problem arises that one doesn't have the time to filter through it all and find the gems. blocSonic exists for this purpose. blocSonic is beginning it's existence as a simple blog at which I will post monthly compilations called netBlocs. Each of these compilations feature:
ΓÇó	10 of the best netlabel tracks available in three formats ΓÇô FLAC, 320kbs MP3 and 192kbs MP3

ΓÇó	30+ page PDF booklet with full track information, bios and more.

ΓÇó	Complete package art in three formats ΓÇô tif, eps and pdf
