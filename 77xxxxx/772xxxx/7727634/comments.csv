,ender9889,2012-10-15T01:37Z,"Excellent torrent, thank you very much! 

Completely ridiculous that Americans like myself won't be able to watch this season on TV until the new year. Cheers!"
,kerplookie,2012-10-15T04:04Z,"Thanks EZTV!!

@ender9889:
Yes, Americans should definitely get every show as soon as it airs, regardless of its origin country.
Never mind the fact that people outside the US have to wait several weeks or months to see American shows, if they air at all."
,TonyTheTiger1969,2012-10-15T04:43Z,"I agree with you kerplookie, and I'm an American. Sometimes the arrogance of people from my country drives me over the edge: ""Me! Me! Me! Me! Me""

Thanks eztv, as always!"

,WoundedWolfgirl,2012-10-15T07:41Z,"Wow, kerplookie, touchy much? I think ender is expressing his/her irritation that s/he has to wait till 2013 to see an American coproduced show.  Because yes, Downton Abbey is a British/American coproduction. Settle down.
Thank you, ez!"
,MissTeen,2012-10-15T16:35Z,"As an American, we do have the right to see all the shows available on earth first, because we are superpower, the richest country on earth!

tee hee"
,ChuChullain,2012-10-15T18:56Z,"Miss Teen, I have news for you... America is NOT the richest country on Earth anymore... China is... ALSO, CHina is actually more of a superpower now than America can hope to dream.  Unfortunate I know... since I do not support either country really. But over here in SOuth Africa we tend to see the rest of the world as it is... and not through coloured glasses.  Downton Abbey is British show made in the UK for a TV station there called ITV. Thyats why you have to wait a year to see it. Its got to tour the British commonwealth first... 
LOL   
Thanks EZTV... 
Sorry about all the crap those ignorant americans are writing on this upload... lol  Makes me think they should've stayed a British colony... lol"
