Video files are not compressible, so there is no point in ZIPing them up."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-10-13T20:14Z,"ALSO WHY IS IT CALLED ojy_kh_yg_gab_jg ?  IS IT TOO HARD FOR YOU TO NAME THE TORRENT PROPERLY , LOOKS LIKE A DRUNK CHIMP TYPED IT ."
,darknesssacred,2012-10-13T20:17Z,Not really for the sake of compressing but more of compiling the numerous files into a zip file.
,darknesssacred,2012-10-13T20:17Z,it's called that for a reason. they are initials
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-10-13T20:31Z,"WELL MATE , PEOPLE NAME THEIR FILES PROPERLY FOR A REASON , IT'S SO THAT WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR THEM THEY CAN BE EASILY FOUND . 

IN A COUPLE OF HOURS TIME NO ONE WILL EVER FIND THIS APART FROM YOU . SO IF YOU ARE HERE TO HELP WITH THE COMMUNITY NAME THE TORRENT WHAT IT IS ."
,darknesssacred,2012-10-13T21:02Z,": well, this file was supposed to be transferred via private torrent, but i couldn't enable embedded tracker on mac os x, hence had to resort to public torrent. thus explaining why i chose to name it in such a way that ""in a couple of hours time, no one will ever find this apart from myself"", (which is good), in a sense that i only want to share with a small group of people since this is a school project. I hope this clears things up. Cheers. "
,darknesssacred,2012-10-13T21:03Z,Though i got to agree that i should have made things more clear in the description next time:)
