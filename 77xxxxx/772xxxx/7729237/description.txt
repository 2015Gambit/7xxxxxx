RELEASE NOTES: CGI graphics and man-made tests recreate destruction of earthquakes, 
			   such as the 2010 Haiti quake that claimed 300,000 lives. But just as 
			   poorly built structures stand no chance against Mother Nature; see 
			   how skyscrapers in Tokyo are designed to withstand earthquakes with 
			   little or no damage incurred.
