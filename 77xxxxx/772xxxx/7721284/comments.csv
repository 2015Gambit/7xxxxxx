Requesting a good cracker for DXTory!

The only working version of DXtory is 114, and there's already a 120! 

It makes me sad that people don't realize DXTory is far superior than Fraps, and yet, fraps is cracked the day after release.

tl;dr - We would all love you if you could find a working copy for dxtory 2.0.120"

,donjulius,2012-10-13T08:44Z,"There is a scene where Kristen Steward smiles and even shows emotion, so it must be one hell of a director, gotta give this one a shot :)"

,kornspell,2012-10-13T15:59Z,"@GhostofMackisGod In a perfect world you would be banned from TPB. If you don't share, you don't deserve that people share things with you.
 I have terrible upload speed (60kB/s at max...) and I always make sure that I seed until at least a 2.0 ratio for popular torrents, and at least 5.0 to rare torrents with few seeds, that took me a long time to download. It's douchebags like you that make me wish that a ratio lower than 1.0 would get people banned from downloading stuff for life..."

This movie sucks!  All this just to see Kristen Stewart's ""tittles"" and to moan?  PATHETIC.  Shes no better naked than with her clothes on!"

bits and bytes not the same thing, assclown. 

torrent speeds are measured in bytes [MB] speed tests are measured in bits [mb]

Oh yeah, you're banned too, asshole

Post back here and we'll troll your ass till you beg for mercy. "

let me enlighten you  a little. 
this is a community , where we all share . you know give and take ? if 95% of the members of TPB acted or thought  like you then TPB wouldnt Exist. 

I hope some day in the future your mind can expand , sou you can become a decent human being. what you said is just wrong man , and i just felt i had to say something. don't be mean this world doesn't need more hate . it feels better to give to others than to deny things to others.TRY IT !"

Very good upload, Hero, and well ahead of the USA release. Bravo."
,wendelj,2012-10-15T19:04Z,This movie totally sucks. You get to get a glimpse of K.Stew's tits but that's the only positive thing about it. Wast of time. 
,Dr.Gonzo1982,2012-10-15T21:52Z,"Thanks for the upload. I've been waiting for this movie. If you liked this film, definitely read the book."
,shagwagon,2012-10-15T23:16Z,"ok, after watching this thoroughly, I give the movie a 5/10. I'm a purist when it comes to books turned into movies, and this one is complete shit. 

It misses out the one thing that makes Jack Kerouac's book worth reading, his voice. The movie has no insights into sex, drugs, music or beatniks and it doesn't really have the flow or the suspense that the book carried with it. That being said, it's a decent movie if you separate it from being involved with the book.

Also, if you downloaded this just to see Kristen Stewarts tits, go fuck yourself. "
,Phatfish,2012-10-17T12:29Z,"V - Good


A - Ok


M - Although well made, well acted and got attetion for detail, unbelievably boring and unnecessarily homoerotic and extremely ignorant about the situations it is trying to portray. 

Basically started to fast forward after 20-30 minutes and didn't even bother with the last 45min or so. "
