,ZeroAccend,2012-10-15T06:49Z,"Thanks for the upload ettv! We appreciate it!

@cyberj0be - Cry more, build a bridge, and get over it.

@Loksfox - Uploading at 250k helps a ton man. Hell that's higher than me. Don't sell yourself short just b/c you can't up at 10meg/sec. As long as you're seeding, you're helping the cause! :D

@Silverado97 - Stop trolling. Ass.

I'll be upping this till I have a 5:1 ratio. Hope everyone else seeds it up, too."
,ZeroAccend,2012-10-15T06:52Z,"Funny side note: Why is it that almost every fucking person who cries and pisses and moans about not being able to download fast enough hasn't uploaded shit? When I hopped on there were 3 whiny little bitches complaining they couldn't download something for *FREE* fast enough, and yet when I checked their profiles not a single one has an original upload of their own.

Interesting, huh?"
,thirzak,2012-10-15T06:52Z,"Seed, motherfuckers"
,ZeroAccend,2012-10-15T07:00Z,"Just finished downloading.

This is legit. Just verified it.

A=9
V=8

Very very good encode, especially considering it has only been out for two or three hours.

Kudos to ettv and vtv for the uploads.

He's a link to the exact same video file that was re-upped by VTV. Try them both and go with the faster one.

,Whitegard,2012-10-15T07:37Z,"How come all your Walking Dead rips have such terrible sound, while all your other rips don't?

The ambient sound is fucked up somehow, not exactly sure how to explain it, it gets really uncomfortable to listen to it for to long."
,maebe,2012-10-15T07:51Z,"Great quality for the size. If you think 412.84MB is HD your a tard. 

Episode is great but once again playing to safe and to close to what the comic storyline is. If they keep it up I can tell you what happens in season 3 without watching."
