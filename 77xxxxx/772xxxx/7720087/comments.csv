,janderkin,2012-10-20T16:15Z,"Azaq!!! Your torrents are fucking awesome...with that said, this one is only in Russian for me (and others it seems). I'm no wizard at figuring these things out (your stuff usually works with little need for intellect). I don't see any options for a language change and the uploading package is in crazy characters (like many of your uploads) so if an option is available, do you know what box and vicinity of the box i.e. bottom right corner button one or two.???? The only Russian I understand is Vodka!"
