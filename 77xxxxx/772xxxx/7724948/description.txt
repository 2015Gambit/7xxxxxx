Hello again everyone. After a month off, I was eager to unleash volume 9 to the world. As the title suggests, it's focused on "lo-fi" offerings that the world of net audio has to offer. Lo-fi as a description for music is kind of vague and can include many genres. Personally, I define lo-fi as any music without slick production ΓÇô music that can contain distorted samples or distortion itself applied to any number of song elements. In fact, distortion becomes an advantage in the wonderful world of lo-fi. Lo-fi can also mean nothing more than merely a home recording on cheap equipment. Here I present 10 lo-fi gems for you to chew on for the next month. Enjoy them and don't miss the accompanying 55 page PDF booklet. If you enjoy, please take a moment to leave a review.

Thanks again to everyone enjoying the releases and participating!

Be sure to check out every one of our netBloc series!

Peace
