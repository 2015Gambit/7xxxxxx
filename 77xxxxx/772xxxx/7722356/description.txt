Today weΓÇÖre breaking from the norm just a bit to surprise you with this special fortyFive release by C-Doc. Enjoy clean versions of Drumm Machine and Far Gone from the forthcoming album ΓÇ£Divided We StandΓÇ¥, which both feature the vocal dexterity of DJ Def Chad along with C-Doc The Warhammer.
Hopefully this will tide you over until the release of the album next Tuesday!
Warning: This music is for true heads. If youΓÇÖre into weak beats and non-rapping rappers, then this is probably not for you.
Thanks to you once again for listening! RememberΓÇª everything we release is cool to share! Always keep the music movingΓÇª share itΓÇª blog itΓÇª podcast it! If youΓÇÖre in radioΓÇª support independent music and broadcast it! With these clean versions, thereΓÇÖs no reason not too! Word.
