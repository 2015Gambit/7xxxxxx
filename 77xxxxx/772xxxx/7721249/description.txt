USE F3 on your KEYBOARD to Search for a Certain APP so you can test if it's here.Enjoy!

It took me more than a month (actually one month and 11 days) to collect this impressive DVD Size packet of applications , sort what is good and what is bad , scan it for your protection with 42 Known antiviruses , make the .iso image so you can easily burn it onto a DVD (at 4x Recommended speed) , adapt it so it can fit in exactly one single DVD/DVD9.

The main question is why all this?

Well . Just because I know how frustrating is after installing a new operating system to look for apps in different CD's DVD's etc or Surf the net countless hours in finding the right , working application that suits your needs .

Solution:

I have organized this DVD (8,5 GB) in such a way that is very user friendly.
In the Root Folder [right after you open the image] you will find the main base folders that will contain all other (specific) data . Every folder has it's own type of applications .

For instance in "Audio Utilities" you will find only audio related applications for example : "Winamp"

Why this DVD ?

Mainly because it's well organized , safe to use and easy to operate with . It contains the direct app's, this means they are not in archives so you will need to do extra work when installing one product , the installation executables are waiting for you to open them right in the respecive folder of the respected (named) application.

Another Reason would be the 'updates' , in a larger sense , the new applications , they are always recommended because they have solved earlier builts bugs and newer apps are always more stable than older ones . Of course new is not always better but I have carefully selected for you the best of the best applications so you can enjoy a full multimedia experience and not just install bloatware (unneeded software) .

What does the DVD Contain ?

It does contain all necessary software for a PC to run more than smoothly and safe .
