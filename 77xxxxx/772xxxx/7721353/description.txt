My second attempt at a megamix, created in 2006.
Starting with an into created by Charly Lownoise and Mental Theo this megamix features a plethora of tracks from labels such as: Dwarf Records, Edge Records, Rotterdam Records, Terror Traxx, Ruffneck Records and artists like Scott Brown, DJ Paul Elstak, and many more 

Just like the first megamix, the intention was to squeeze as many samples and tracks into the entire mix, I think that has well and truly been achieved!!
A number of popular movie quotes have been slid in at regular intervals....I can't help myself, huge movie buff!! hahah.
WARNING: This megamix contains A LOT of offensive language, you have been warned.
Runtime: 58 minutes

All comments, either positive or negative, would be appreciated.  

If you want a track, sample or movie quote identified, please PM me, there are far too many to list in a track listing!!
