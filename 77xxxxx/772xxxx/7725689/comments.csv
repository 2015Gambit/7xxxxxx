[V],NLUPPER002,2012-10-14T12:02Z,"@o2cui2i2

Thanks"
,oikjgbvguiugfc,2012-10-15T12:44Z,"shit dude, you gotta convert/compress these to a smaller format! 40gb for one movie? forget that! it should be about 0.8gb per movie."
,Skram0,2012-10-17T08:37Z,"@oikjgbvguiugfc
820MB a movie!? You really like shit, don't you?"
,TARDISMan2008,2012-10-18T15:32Z,I don't think this is one movie. I think it's all of them on an ISO fit for a double-layer Blu-Ray.
,AndreasC81,2012-10-20T23:14Z,Ppl doesn't seem to get the thing with Bluray or 1080p. Do you really think that 850 Mb for a movie would represent the degree of quality equal to that of a bluray? Have you watched a bluray so you know what it is? Doesn't seem like it. What would the point of bluray disks be if the size of the movie didn't matter?
,SketVald,2012-10-21T07:57Z,ISO image of BluRay. One film per torrent.
,jasagen,2012-10-22T09:16Z,"Looking forward to the rest of this Collection
thank you very much"
,away001,2012-10-22T18:07Z,"Wat een commentaar weer...

Helemaal top dat je dit doet NLUPPER! 
Komt de rest van de serie ook?"
,Vikingman1111,2012-10-23T17:57Z,"Don't waste your time. 40G for one movie? Blue Ray or not, NLUPPER is saddling us with a horrendous download time for this one, let alone the others. "
,Vikingman1111,2012-10-23T17:59Z,To go to such lengths for a BR James Bond movie is like going to the moon for a hamburger.
,indmys,2012-10-30T01:47Z,"@Vikingman1111. There are a lot of us who would kill for these ISOs and appreciate the effort by the up-loader. There are plenty of compressed files available of the same movies here in TPB. I guess you shouldn't waste your time commenting here and go get what you want. Rest of us are happy with what we get.
Keep it coming NLUPPER002, Can't wait for the rest of the collection. Thank you very much."
