Starting 2012, the Mojos band project was shelved so that Avidan would concentrate on a solo career. 
In 2012, he released Avidan in a Box, an acoustic album which covers older songs by him, digital copies only and is launching Different Pulses in Israel, to be made available internationally in 2013.
