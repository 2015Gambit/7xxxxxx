This release includes the complete Red Bull Stratos mission (1 hours and 45 minutes) and it has the audio in Romanian language.

Felix.Baumgartner managed to successfully jump from the capsule with the help of a helium gas baloon from a little over 39 km, an area located in the stratosphere.

Enjoy and seed romanian guys especially, since it's a romanian audio release.
