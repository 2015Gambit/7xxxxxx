[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-14T22:29Z,"Generally I only encode that which I personally watch.

However, if you'd provide me with a list, I might try one or two.

Looked at Ben 10 once and wasn't impressed. I'll have another look.

,vatel88,2012-11-10T17:44Z,steam lantern is episode 15 as scene here http://www.amazon.com/Beware-Power-Green-Lanterns-Light-Part/dp/B0066TNG6E/ref=sr_1_12?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1352565847&sr=1-12&keywords=green+lantern
,vitae666,2012-11-19T02:14Z,"@vatel88: If you read:	
1. Beware My Power...Green Lantern's Light (Part One and Part Two) [HD]
That's the 1st 2 episodes in one. So yes, it would throw the count off.
Look things up on tv.com instead. Looking at something that is a compilation of episodes doesn't help in the least."
