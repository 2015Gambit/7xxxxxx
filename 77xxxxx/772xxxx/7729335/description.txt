TutsPlus - JavaScript Fundamentals 101

Without a doubt, JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. While the web development industry is chock full of frameworks and libraries that simplify some aspects of JavaScript development, thereΓÇÖs something to be said about having the skills to write pure JavaScript. Frameworks, libraries, and transpilers may come and go, but JavaScript is forever.
This course focuses on the basics of the two fundamental aspects of client-side development: the JavaScript language and DOM scripting. The first half of this course teaches you the basics and best practices of the JavaScript language; the second focuses on DOM scripting and events. So, if youΓÇÖre a complete beginner, or a coder who has exclusively used frameworks but wants to delve into the guts of pure JavaScript development, this is the course for you.
