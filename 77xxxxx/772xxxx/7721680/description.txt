OK GUYS THIS IS JUST A R.I.P DONT KNOW IF IT WILL WORK. YOU CANT UPLOAD A .EXE A THE SERVER INSTALLS THE FILES DIRECT TO YOUR PC, 
ALSO YOU CANNT INSTALL T A DIFFERENT FOLDER AS IT LOOKS FOR THE FSX.CFG.

GUYS IV PULLED ALL THE FILES I COULD SEE AND PUT THEM IN THIS FOLDER. I HAD TROUBLE FINDING THE EFFECTS FOR THE AIRCRAFT SO NO EFFECTS.

INSTALL.

Justflight, (Folder) in to main fsx directory.
Gauges, copy folder contents to gauges folder.
CLS_BAe146_200 copy whole folder to sim objects aircraft folder.
CLS_BAe146 copy whole folder to the sound folder.

F.B.I

it may or may not work,
