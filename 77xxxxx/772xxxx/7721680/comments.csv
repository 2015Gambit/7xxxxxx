,rokket_1990,2012-10-13T23:37Z,"@ FBI

The effects files` names are described in the [effects] section of the aircraft.cfg.
In this case they are:

1. fx_wake
2. fx_spray
3. CLS_sparks
4. fx_tchdwn, 1


Search for these files into your effects folder.

If you don`t find them there, try the whole fsx folder.

I hope, that hepls..."
