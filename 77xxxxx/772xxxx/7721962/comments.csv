lol, i wonder where you well informed fellow might originate from. i guess it is a continent which's northern part consists of not more than two nations, and my next guess is you are not from the one of the two nations that enjoys acorn syrup and general literacy. 

what about numbers, do you don't use them as well because of their arabic origin? oh, and btw, those letters aren't even arabic, they are cyrillic. that means russian. as in Russia, where the movie starts at."

The subtitles were in Cyrillic instead of English.

@supkids

""...i wonder where you well informed fellow...""
""...is a continent which's northern part..."" 

What were you saying about general literacy?

A...corn...syrup. You have an interesting taste in food. For a squirrel. I'm Canadian and I am proud to like regular syrup. Like maple syrup. Like the symbol of my flag? Maple leaf? Ringing a bell? No?

Before I go ANY further, ""one of the two nations that enjoys acorn syrup and general literacy.""

Where do I begin? 

1) This is the interwebs. 

2) This is the Pirate Bay. The God damn Pirate Bay. PIRATE. NOT GRAMMAR NAZI FAIL BAY, THE PIRATE BAY. 

3) WHO the FUCK enjoys GENERAL LITERACY on the PIRATE BAY? Or anywhere else that does so many (illegal) things? (Not that I'm saying I don't enjoy the "
,vichteck,2012-10-15T04:17Z,"Pirate Bay. I love you, Pirate Bay.) So, you're to tell me that if I walked out into my neighborhood, and talked to every single one of my neighbors, they'll not mess up once with their ""literacy""?

What I'm trying to say is, if I'm going to drop a comment it's for the betterment of other people. If they look at my comment they would see that I didn't like the movie therefore changing their mind a bit. It doesn't matter that I messed up on what kind it was, for how many people besides you know that those were Cyrillic characters? (not everyone) 

But the fact that I found something wrong at the beginning of the movie is what really matters.

And what do you mean ""what about numbers, do I not use numbers because they have an Arabic origin""?

,supkids,2012-10-15T11:00Z,"lol, yeah, i fucked up a bit. english isn't my native language, that's how the acorn - maple thing happened (maple = ahorn in german, ahorn became acorn because i didn't think much)

as far as grammar nazi goes, i never commented on anyone's grammar, my ""literacy"" comment was aimed at people who don't seem to be able to understand what the writing in front of their eyes means (like confusing arabic letters with cyrillic). generally i just commented on vichteck's comment because it's a blatant display of ignorance and racism. using racial clichés about canadians (maple syrup, ability to understand what they read) and americans (illiterate) was an attempt at irony. looks like it failed.

whatever, i'll just keep it simple from now on. vichteck, you are an ignorant cunt for disliking a movie because of what you thought were arabic letters. and for the numbers... google for ""arabic numerals"". then cry. and probably never use numbers again."

,katlee26,2012-10-15T15:55Z,"Thanks scene4all love all your downloads. I hardly ever sign in to write comments but this one really pissed me off the same as all the spammers do. 
Judonom76 comment with the link to get the subs - I downloaded from the site and once file unzipped just said to go to blogspot to get the subs - go there and as usual fill out 1000 pages of crappy win this and that, cannot be bothered with that kind of crap. Really need to find a way to get rid of people like that. I don't know just because I had a problem doesn't mean others will, just thought would put it out there, so you are all aware. I probably like everyone has the one they get subs from etc, so really if it's not there then I should know its not available just yet, I'm sure in the next few days, weeks whatever that there will be good subs. 
There had my little bitch. Now watching the movie - sub free. Anyway for scene4all just incase you haven't heard lately you (and a few other regulars) are brilliant, what you put out there  is great, and really for what, half the time people bitch and whinge and forget that it is your time spent giving it to all of us. We should all make the most of it, as who knows when it may all end.

"" Opened up the movie, saw the Arabic letters... (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Fuck this shit! ""

Okay, I'm an ignorant cunt but maybe you didn't see my next comment RIGHT AFTER that one that says 

"" But maybe when I'm bored as fuck I'll give it a try... 'Till then I'll just let it idly seed for a few years. ""

So how does that mean that I dislike the movie? I'm fucking seeding this movie right fucking now! At maybe 50KB a sec but still, it's something! 

""generally i just commented on vichteck's comment because it's a blatant display of ignorance and racism""

So because I didn't know the language it's racist. Because of my display of ignorance, you commented. And that all somehow made you feel like the gayest piece of pink cotton candy so much that you just had to, JUST HAD TO!, comment. 

That's like saying a Black person doesn't know the Vietnamese language so he says fuck this shit, and a White person says that's racist. He doesn't know the language so why the hell is the White person mad for? The Asian kid isn't mad, as a matter of fact he could care less. Because for all anyone knows, he could have put something bad about the Black person. Or maybe it's because he cursed that made the White person mad. Oh fuck I just trapped my self. 

I kinda see where you're coming from supkids. I think perhaps if I said it in a nicer way with more of a White person's accent, then you wouldn't have commented. And then this chain wouldn't have started. And then the world turned once again. 

MORAL: Do your homework and Google your shit or supkids here will get on your ass for being an ignorant cunt."
