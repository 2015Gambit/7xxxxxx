,disneydreams,2012-10-14T19:54Z,I have no problem with them recasting Ridge. He choose to leave they didn't fire him. 
,MsMuffet,2012-10-15T05:28Z,Thanks MsFenmore ... sad episode! I'm going to miss Queen Stephanie when she leaves.
,bleslie1,2012-10-15T17:15Z,"I cant believe Stephanie won't be on B&B anymore come 2013... it's too sad :(

I think that recasting Ron Moss would be a HUGE mistake. As of right now there's still a chance he might come back. If they recast him, that's it... no going back.

Ron Moss is too much of a fan favorite... it would be very risky to try recasting such a major role"
