Description
TomTom Navigation for iPhone/iPad. World-class TomTom navigation, on your iPhone or iPad

ΓÇ£Bottom Line: Still the most car-like of the iPhone navigation apps, TomTom always gets the job done, and its adaptive routing and HD traffic plug-in are the best in the business.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇôPC Magazine

ΓÇ£For Apple devices, I found TomTom most useful. To my eye, the interface was more refined and simpler than the others. The software routed me around traffic more intelligently, too, and it showed more relevant traffic data.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇô New York Times

ΓÇ£If a traffic jam has occurred on your route, TomTom HD Traffic will not only inform you how far out it is and how big of an impact it will have on your travel time, but it will also give you the best possible alternative routes. And since traffic data is provided every two minutes, you wonΓÇÖt have to worry about trying to get around a traffic jam only to run into another.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇôApp Advice
