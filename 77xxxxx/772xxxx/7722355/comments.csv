,bidawi,2012-10-14T04:00Z,Thanks but file is only installer. No txt file or serial included.
,GSPT,2012-10-14T04:10Z,Thanks. I got everything.
,bidawi,2012-10-14T04:27Z,"Sorry, there was a txt file, it just was not labeled properly and was lost within the folder. All good now. Thanks for the up."
,Swegin8r,2012-10-14T07:47Z,"You are both very welcome.

@bidawi: Not sure what you mean by 'not labeled properly' or 'lost within the folder'. My description states ""a text file containing instructions AND registration details"" therefore you can assume they are in the same file. Also that file 'Instructions.txt', should have extracted to the same location as the rest of the files. Nevertheless, I'm glad you were able find it and I hope you enjoy."

Thanks Swegin8r. "
,setnaps,2012-11-05T11:13Z,"@Swegin8r I think the serials included are not working anymore...is it possible to get new ones?
Thanks for all."
,Swegin8r,2012-11-05T18:22Z,"@setnaps: The serials work mate. Remember to read the instructions completely. Excerpt from the instructions: ""!!NOTE!!: Be sure to block the application's internet access with
Little Snitch! Otherwise the provided details may be flagged as 'pirated'
and you will not be able to register the program."" This is right above the registration details, and is also stated on this page at the top of the description."
