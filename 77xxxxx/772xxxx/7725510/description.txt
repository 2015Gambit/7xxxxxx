Futuristic Dragon (2002 remastered 2CD digipak)

Ripped with EAC to FLAC - No Errors



Futuristic Dragon is the eleventh studio album and a UK-only release by T. 

Rex, released in 1976. Preceded by two UK Top 40 hits, "New York City" 

(#15) and "Dreamy Lady" (#30), Futuristic Dragon was released in January, 

reaching #50. It was T. Rex's first album to register in the charts since 

Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow in 1974. The album features 

some unusually dense production from Bolan, with hints that he had been 

listening to old Phil Spector records, especially "Chrome Sitar" and 

"Calling All Destroyers", which contained unusual musical embellishements 

such as sitar and other sonic sound effects.


Futuristic Dragon was remastered for CD by Edsel Records in 1994 as part of 

their extensive T. Rex reissue campaign. A number of bonus tracks were 

added. A companion release, entitled Dazzling Raiment (The 

Alternate Futuristic Dragon), was released in 1997 which contained 

alternative versions, studio rough mixes and solo recordings of the main 

album and bonus tracks. A combined album digipak (MEDCD719) was released in 

2002.
