The Walking Dead: Torn Apart is a six-part web series based on the television series The Walking Dead, that aired in its entirety on October 3, 2011, on AMC's official website. The web series tells the origin story of Hannah, also known as "Bicycle Girl", the walker that Rick Grimes killed in the first episode. Rick risks a Walker encounter to go back and find Hannah before he sets out for Atlanta. After telling her that he is "sorry that this happened to you," Rick shoots in what is clearly a humanitarian gesture, which reveals much about Rick's own character and sets a tone for the rest of season one
