,rtotic,2012-10-20T14:01Z,"fast download, works perfectly; the instructions are detailed and articulate, thank you very much!"
,notapirate,2012-10-21T23:32Z,"I hate to nag the uploader, since this is already so great, but it would be so amazingly awesome if you could make one with all the Intel, AMD, AND nVidia SATA AND RAID drivers, and absolutely nothing else changed. I have attempted this, but apparently you are more talented than I, as one of mine complained of missing files, and the other gave me a BSOD. Any assistance you could provide would be amazing. I would need both Home and Pro to really make my life awesome. I'm sure that to someone who is more familiar with nLite than I, this is easy stuff, but I haven't yet gotten it to work.

This would be the most AWESOME XP installer ever, and it could be you that makes it!"
