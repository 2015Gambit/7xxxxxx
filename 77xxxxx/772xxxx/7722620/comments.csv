,chulex_67,2012-10-14T01:42Z,"Yify always bring good quality to piratebay, the sad part is that you have to wait like 10 days to start downloading a movie. Look at seeders and look at leechers. "

,baker66,2012-10-18T06:10Z,I have no idea why every one complains about YIFY I have been downloading his stuff and playing them on my LG Blu-ray player with a flash drive and all of his stuff has always been 10/10 so if you guys don't like his stuff that bad then why do you still get from him/her??

,theRealKarmine,2012-11-05T08:22Z,if its stereo and mp3 GOOD.  fuck you assholes who want to burn ac3.  go rent the damn thing and copy it.
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-11-08T20:27Z,"@ theRealKarmine 
Does ac3 prevent the file from playing directly to a tv monitor through the USB plug? 

I'm trying to figure out why some play directly from a flash drive and others require an HDMI connection. I personally find it a very minor irritant, but some complain that playing a file through an HDMI connection prevents the automatic recognition of 5.1 surround sound on those movies that have it. It would be nice to know so I can avoid any problems on those few movies which are actually improved by surround sound. For the rest stereo is just fine."
,FureeTutawk,2012-11-19T04:33Z,@fakeidmuhammad if people have all that gear and bych about quality for playing with all that gear then maybe they should spend a few bucks and buy the damn movie and stop whining like a bunch of spoiled brats. Besides .. MOST OF THEM ARE RESELLING THEM and want highest quality so their burns will sell. Screw them.
