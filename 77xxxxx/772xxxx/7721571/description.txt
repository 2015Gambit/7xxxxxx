Set 800 years after a catastrophic event called the "Great Fear" the stories feature Lone Sloane, who is caught by an entity called He Who Seeks, after his space ship is destroyed. He is thrown into a different dimension, where he becomes a space rogue and freebooter with strange powers. He finds himself caught in an inter-galactic struggle between space pirates, gigantic robots, dark gods and other-dimensional entities. Very similar to Silver Surfer and Galactus, or Ulysses and the Greek Gods, he is compelled to wander in a universe that is alien to him. It is also known for the quasi-Baroque style of Druillet's artwork, which features Lovecraft's space nightmares mixed with M.C. Escher's influences.
