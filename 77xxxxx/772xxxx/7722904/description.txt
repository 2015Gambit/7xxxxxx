The Ed Show; October 12, 2012.

 Vice President Joe Biden kept the hits coming after his knockout debate last night. Ed welcomed Richard Wolffe (Vice President and Executive Editor of MSNBC.com and MSNBC Political Analyst), on the education of Congressman Paul Ryan.

The war on women was alive and well at the VP debate, with revealing answers to a question about abortion.  Terry O'Neill (President of the National Organization for Women), joined Ed.

Paul Ryan defends his tax plan but not very convincingly. David Cay Johnston (Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, and author of "The Fine Print: How Big Companies Use 'Plain English' To Rob You Blind") took a crack at Ryan's "six study" lie.

Then, Republicans freaked out over Vice President Joe Biden's big win.  Karen Finney (Former DNC Communications Director and MSNBC Political Analyst) joined Ed for that.

And in the Big Finish, Bain Capital is sending American jobs overseas and Mitt Romney is refusing to step in. 

Ed asked Leo Gerard (President of the United Steelworkers), about a massive protest in Freeport, Illinois, where they are warning the country about Mitt Romney's vision for America.
