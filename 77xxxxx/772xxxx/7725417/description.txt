Release highlights:

Disk I/O system completely rewritten. Now multi-threaded and high performance. It will take advantage of multiple disks, perform better with even just one, and no one disk job can block everything (e.g slow network blocking local I/O, or allocating files)
Auto-labeling and per-label download directories (Preferences -> Label)
Search items in Advanced preferences
Paired device removal
