Don't care what the other guy says. Even if it's an up scaled version of the 720p, it's still great quality.

Cheers!"
[T],SCSA420,2012-10-14T11:18Z,@Green.Lantern You're FAKE and it was captured from the 1920x1080i source so it is 1920x1080 resolution you MORON..............................

[T],SCSA420,2012-10-19T17:57Z,"IF you can do a better job then do it Apophis otherwise STFU and there is NOTHING wrong with the quality it is fine. Its not my fault you have INFERIOR equipment to play the show back on compared to my 55 inch LG 3D LED Smart TV, 2 BluRay players, Playstation 3, Samsung Galaxy SIII Smartphone, 2 Core I7 desktop PC's, and a Core I7 laptop. Which all play the shows I release fine with NO problems at all. 

UNLIKE you I actually upload stuff here instead of being a leecher. I should have already had VIP or Trusted status on this website at this point."
