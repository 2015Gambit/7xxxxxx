It's so EASY you don't need this book...


1) Mix some jewish and christian religion and some simple camel driver beliefs in djinns and the like.

2) Find a crowd of ignorant towel-heads gullible enough to swallow all this.

3) Decree that all who fall out of your new religion WILL BE KILLED, the recipe for ever growing numbers... or else...

And that's that.

But so stupid that as mankind gets more educated, they will drop out in droves, no matter the threats to the contrary...

Repeating over and over your answer won't make it more believable... Those were Goebbels' tactics...   Islam at the beginning created a brutal conquering expansion overwhelming and converting forcibly whole populations that were living OK before they arrived. It's just that muslims can't face the ugly truth about their evil pseudo-prophet and religion...

What hurts muslims the most is the FACT that they are THE ONLY RELIGION that kills those who try to leave it. More barbaric than that, nothing.

What people like you don't understand is that when anything only survives through FEAR, like dictatorships, Saddam, Gaddafi, Hitler and so many others in history, like bloody evil islam, suppressing human personal freedom, sooner or later people get fed up and destroy that evil. Human patience has limits. With islam the same will happen, it's just a matter of time, because humans were not born to be slaves forever...

,toptenz,2012-10-14T08:38Z,"



If you are waiting to see the fall of Islam I hope you will live 1000 years or more. Islam is the religion of mercy and sympathy for all humanity and not dictatorships. Muslims in Egypt removed Mubarak and in Lybia and Tunisia removed their dictators, while millions of people were killed to remove Hitler. After the cold war ended, the west invented this picture of Islam. Islam is not responsible for all behaviors of those who claim they follow it. AlQaida is not Islam. Why do not you take sometime to read about real facts about Islam NOT your own false facts.

....and you keep lying as if anybody would believe what you say.... If I go to Egypt what I'll see is the hatred against christian copts, they forbid them building new churches or even expand their current buildings, crowds form and attack and kill copts at the slightest excuse, like lies that copts are trying to convert muslims or that the copts are preventing a girl to become muslim, any excuse is good enough for a riot. 

That's the truth and the reality, the rest is lies to try to fool the ignorant and gullible that islam is not an evil religion that hates personal freedom and teaches stupidities (quran=sun sets at night into a murky pond !!).......

This is Islam: Islam means ""submission to God"". Islam is the belief that there is only One God, whose proper name is Allah, which means "" the God"". Islam is the same message given to all the prophets, from Adam, Noah, Moses, Abraham, Jesus, and finally to the Prophet Muhammad, the last messenger (peace and blessings be upon them). They all brought the same message: worship only God, and stop worshipping human beings and their ideas.

If you believe there is only One God who should be worshiped, and no one/nothing else has that right but Him, and you believe Muhammad, peace be upon him, was a messenger who brought the same message as all the prophets before him, then you are basically a Muslim."

Continue to lie if you wish, but it is useless...

About the murder of copts in Egypt, just read the Egyptian press and find out the TRUTH, not muslim lies to sweep it under the carpet.

All you say about your evil religion, islam, avoids the key point that they don't let you leave it, if you wish, death is the penalty.
islam is hatred of personal liberty.

Do you know onething, the first word in Quran is READ. 

Read man not hate or kill or insulting others and not respecting their believes. About you can not leave it because it is not a game and if you know Islam really you will never leave it. and if you do not like do not accept from the beginning. If you are talking about few numbers of those who want to leave it, believe me they are worthless and they do not know their religion and doing it for some money from here or there.
