You have no idea how much we appreciate your time and energy. Your the only uploader that I find quality, consistent sports(GO SEAHAWKS!) I would have to buy cable if it was not for you. Thanks Nepotu!!!!

Side Note
What happen to the comment section? Some of the most profane, vulgar, disgusting language I honestly have ever seen. Step up and edit that nonsense out PB. Please.
