The FreakyFlicks collection is limited to those films that have played
an exceptional role in the history of cinema and its progression in
becoming a great art. Films that are usually described as classic,
cult, arthouse and avant-garde.

If you have films that fit this description feel free to share them
and participate in our community. All you need do is include this tag
in your upload and join us at the forum to announce your release.

[T],Distanasia,2012-10-20T15:53Z,"This rip is better:

""The first part (about 5 minutes) of Kino version has looks pretty poor. But overall it is sharper, has better contrast and is less cropped. On the Image Entertainment version ""some scenes"" display a translucent line near the top of the frame. This is a defect carried over from original film copy."" This line is not present on Kino version."" @ DVDBeaver."
