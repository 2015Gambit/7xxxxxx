2)  Power Struggles 
In this edition, Huw spans seven centuries - from the building of a great frontier to Owain Glyndwr's epic struggle for independence. He recounts how the lust for power and land by some medieval kings forged Wales into nation. Amidst battles with Vikings, Saxons and Normans, Welsh culture flourished, but the death of the last native Prince was followed by a century of plague and famine, until the charismatic Glyndwr led a rebellion against the English Crown.
