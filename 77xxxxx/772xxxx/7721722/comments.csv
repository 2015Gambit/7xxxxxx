,FringeRea,2012-10-15T15:48Z,"Lebada3,

a good fagmerican is a slave for a kike one!"
,FringeRea,2012-10-15T15:49Z,Ching_Liu thx for briefly explaining.
,Man_no9,2012-10-18T19:23Z,"I actually logged in to my PB account just so I could ask you, FringeRea: ""What the fuck are you smoking?""

Where does he say this is 1080p? How can a piece of software even be HD? And how slow is your broadband, exactly, if 300MB is ""rediculous""? Just in the time it took me to write this, I've finished the download, and I've only got a 1MB/s line.

I hope you're a troll, because that's actually less sad than if you're genuine."
,Bryceicle,2012-10-20T10:55Z,This upload does not work at all. Better luck next time Ching_Liu. 0 out of 10 :-(
,topdrizzle,2012-10-23T19:24Z,CHing Liu. Can you somehow disable Cinavia in future releases? This has become a major problem and since v1905 I am unable to play a bunch of 3d back up titles. 
,chop007,2012-10-30T18:48Z,"Ching Liu your are a legend, thanks for this bro, works perfect but the background processes for poweredvd 12 are a pain in the rear. I can't believe cyberlink is destroying this awesome app like this. Anyways, back to 11 for me. Thanks again Ching you got great clean torrents."
