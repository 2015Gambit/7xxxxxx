Gordon Lightfoot - Did she Mention My name

I have been trying to replicate my record collection on my hard drive so that I can play my music without worrying about wearing out the analogue recordings and so that I can take my collection with me whenever I go to work out of town.

This is one album that I have never been able to find online.  It is long out of print and since you cannot buy it anymore, I decided to share it with Lightfoot fans who are trying to find a copy.  This copy is a little crackly so, I apoligise in advance....

I would not share the music if it was otherwise available.

Stats:  Original Pressing

        Dual CS16-1214 Turntable

Please give me your Feedback and Seed.

Enjoy!
