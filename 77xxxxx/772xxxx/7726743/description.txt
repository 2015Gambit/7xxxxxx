This is the unquestionably B-quality but still vastly underrated sequel to 'To Die For', a vampire film from the mid-80s. It's hopelessly corny but still an oddly great film.

For vampire fans, it's worth seeing at least for the charming performance of Michael Praed, who rises above the rest of the movie with aplomb and delivers a surprisingly great performance as main vampire Dr. Max Schreck. Watch him make Hamlet out of Troll 2, and marvel. 

The sex scene alone is worth watching this movie for. Trust me.

I'm sharing this out of sheer enjoyment of the film and a desire not to see it disappear into VHS limbo. If you enjoy vampire movies, don't miss this one.

This is a DVD-Rip of standard quality, not HD but definitely watchable, in .AVI format.
