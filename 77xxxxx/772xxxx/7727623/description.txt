Lifetime announced Wednesday that the sixth season of its hit drama Army Wives will return on Sunday, March 4 at 9/8c, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
 
Susan Lucci lands first post-All My Children role on Army Wives
 
In November, the network ordered an additional 10 episodes of the drama, which brings the season total to 23 episodes. In the upcoming season, All My Children vet Susan Lucci will star as Audrey, the wife of a retired Brigadier General.
 
The premiere will also serve as the lead-in to the docuseries Coming Home at 10/9c, which follows the reunions that U.S. armed forces service members have with their families.
