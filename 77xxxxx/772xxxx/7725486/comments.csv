I will note Imperfect in the file name to remind me to look for a better one."

,gSpotTornado,2012-11-21T20:41Z,Anybody able to grab it from the link provided? Does someone have an uncorrupted version? I'm glad the reissue fixes the problems that were present on the Ryco/BP versions - they were horrible!
