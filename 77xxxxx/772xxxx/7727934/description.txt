Developing his reputation originally as a hot Texas sideman for both local Houston/Galveston bands & the likes of the Upsetters, Bobby "Blue" Bland & Al "TNT" Braggs. Joe is both an accomplished axeman & vocalist in his own right, with a huge following in Europe. This CD shows his return, a powerhouse performance recorded live in San Francisco with an all-star band featuring Tony Coleman, the man behind the battery for B.B. King & Ike Turner. Features all originals seasoned with Joe's searing Telecaster licks.
