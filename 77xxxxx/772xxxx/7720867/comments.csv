,Efreak15,2012-10-12T20:09Z,@EXR  The movie directors choose which aspect ratio/resolution the movie is filmed in.  Not the encoders.  
,EXR,2012-10-13T11:48Z,"@Efreak15 : Thanks Man,I didn't know that.do u know any good encoder program using which I can make it into 1280x720 without loosing quality?"

,Efreak15,2012-10-13T16:56Z,@EXR You can't make a 2:35:1 aspect ratio film into a 16:9 ratio film.  You can however fill the screen by using the crop function of your media player.  You just won't see the entire view.
,PauloFran,2012-10-14T03:09Z,"Video quality is better than DVDRip, but not as good as a true Bluray rip.
Anyway, thanks for sharing."
,trombonier,2012-10-16T17:56Z,"@EXR try using VLC player, and in the Video setting you can change Aspect Ratio to 16:9, 16:10, 3:4, 4:3 and a bunch others. "
