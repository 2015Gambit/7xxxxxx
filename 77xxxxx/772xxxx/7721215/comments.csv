I do! And for the people who have home theatres with AV recivers difference between ac3 and DTS is massive!  "
,Xitz,2012-10-13T18:13Z,DTS is the ultimate thing guys...5.1 dts and 5.1 ac3 or 5.1 aac cannot be compared and should not be compared...
,PauloFran,2012-10-13T23:04Z,"Extraordinary video quality.
True 720p!
Thank you a lot!"
,canopener,2012-10-13T23:26Z,"Thx for the up BOZX.

I'm a VERY big fan of dts! A Couple of years ago I converted and remuxed a lot of my movies from dts to AC3 because my Samsung LED tv didn't support dts pass-through. Instead of keeping both the dts and AC3 audio file, I deleted the dts and I regret it so much!

Difference is night and day and I'm not even an audiophile."
,SpotDiablo,2012-10-14T07:41Z,"@JeTTTo
I play all my files with my media player connected to my A/V amp hence DTS is an absolute must. In fact if possible DTS-ES (6.1) is even better. "
,voey789,2012-10-14T10:36Z,Very good movie i've seen it in cinema .

Great quality rip. Decent movie too. Looked and sounded good on my 42"" flat screen

 My GF didn't like it but I thought it was great. Solid story, historically accurate (minus the vampires), great acting and writing. Excellent action scenes. Similar to 300.

Enjoy! Will be seeding for awhile."
,southak,2012-10-20T20:54Z,@ jeTTo - I ALWAYS use DTS. It is far superior to Dolby Digital or *shudders* aac. The sole use of AAC is for non-home cinema applications ie ipads and phones and macs and for apple tv (although why anyone would want apple tv is beyond me). Anyone who has a home cinema sound quality would say the same.

Movie is average at best.  Worth a watch if your really bored I suppose."

Great quality rip, silly movie though :p"
,rajusahrauniyar,2012-10-24T18:18Z,will this bluray rip play on my windows 7 pc? Plz reply
,FireIsHot,2012-10-26T08:11Z,"@rajussa - Yes of course, just use VLC PLayer, (google it) and then when it is downloaded completely, right click on the file, scroll over or click ""open with"" and click VLC Player. 

Or Do As It's recommended to make VLC the default player for all video/music files during setup. 

If you do this, just double click on the movie file and VLC will open and begin playing it. 

VLC Is Completely Free, and regularly updated btw."

,fin2,2012-10-30T00:37Z,"DTS is da bomb?
Oh please...

If an AC3 or AAC track is encoded with the same volume level as a (usually louder) DTS track, then you can't hear the difference. The main reason people think the DTS track sounds better is that its volume level is higher than other track types, and all you need to do is turn up your volume knob to make an AC3 track sound the same.

Also, the DTS codec is not as good at compression as AC3 or AAC, which is why the DTS tracks are so much larger. Please save the space, use AC3 instead of DTS.

,fin2,2012-10-31T10:11Z,"Also, AAC is a very good codec. If my home theater supported AAC 5.1 then I would be happy to use this format for all my content, as it uses VBR encoding, unlike AC3 or DTS which both use CBR encoding, which wastes space and bitrate on the parts that don't need it. AAC is not just for ""non-home cinema applications"". Its a next gen codec designed for top quality sound, as well as low bitrate applications, which gives it great flexibility."
