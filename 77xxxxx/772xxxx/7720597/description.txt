Setup Factory is the result of over a decade of experience in creating software installation tools. Unlike other installer builders that require week-long training courses in order to get up to speed, Setup Factory was designed to be fast and easy to use. By pairing a visual layout of your software's files and folders with a point-and-click interface, the entire process becomes completely logical and absolutely painless. What's more, Setup Factory creates a compact, single-file setup.exe that runs on any version of Windows from 95 to Vista and is perfect for distribution by web download, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM and LAN.

With Setup Factory, you simply drag and drop your files onto the project window, and click on the publish button. That's it. It's really that simple. You'll be up and running in minutes. The Project Wizard can even walk you through it. Whether you want to create shortcut icons on the desktop and start menu, or configure an uninstaller in the control panel's Add/Remove Programs panel, it's all just a few clicks away. The same thing goes for adding in third-party runtime modules, with support for Visual Basic, .NET and more.
