,whaletail935,2012-10-15T02:31Z,Is this the same content as the Epic book?
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-15T06:15Z,"whaletail935, actaully, this IS the Epic book. I usually do a cross-check between whatever website(s) (in this case I think it was comicbookdb, could have been a wiki or Amazon, though) I'm working with and the book, but in this case I appear to have skipped that process. Apologies."
