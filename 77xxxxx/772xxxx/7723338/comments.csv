,squid_rocks,2012-10-22T05:23Z,"I'm getting an error when installing. Somewhere about 60%. It pops up a small box which says some memory is out of range or something. Please suggest some remedy.

I've tried installing the game two times now. Thanks in advance."
,squid_rocks,2012-10-23T05:56Z,"Nevermind my previous comment. I could install the game the third time. What I had to do was keep the installer and the game directory to install into on the same hard drive. Earlier I'd tried with installer on USB drive. The second time the installer was on other partition of the HDD.
Finally, it has all worked out. The game is a little tough though..."
,MatheusFausto,2012-10-24T02:33Z,"probably a lot of people will miss the step ""press soft and components button-select English language"" (I just did). Normally you just choose the location on your hard drive and hit install. xD"
,paragatol123,2012-10-27T14:28Z,"I opened this game and an error comes out. 

""Need for Speed The Run.exe - Entry Point Not Found

,calin1975,2012-10-28T16:03Z,"I cannot find any ""press soft and components button-select English language"" option in the install. 
After selecting the path to install, next screen is selecting just 2 options: DirectX and Visual C++... Am I missing something?"
,Kodiak161,2012-10-31T03:51Z,"I have the same problem as paragatol123, does this game work on xp?"
,lehshara,2012-11-11T14:47Z,"What crack does this repack use?
I installed game and it crashed after first mission...so i switched crack to reloaded and now game won't even fucking launch -.-"
,RafVne2,2012-11-22T16:03Z,"Thanks for the up.
I didn't check it yet but I'm quite sure that since it's TFK's up, it'll work just fine.

So again... In advance.. thank you."
,RafVne2,2012-11-22T20:44Z,"@Kodiak161

As you can see in post made TFK . Game requires DirectX 10. So no, I don't think it will work on XP."
