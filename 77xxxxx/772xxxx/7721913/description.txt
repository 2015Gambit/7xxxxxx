The 2001 Velvet Underground box set "Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes".

This box set contains a collection of some of the recordings from Robert Quine, a huge fan of The Velvet Underground who recorded many of their shows. Though the quality isn't anything to brag about (then again, really none of the V.U. bootlegs aren't that good quality wise), it's a great collection of some of their performances, possibly the best official Live release from the band so far (I hope they continue the "Bootleg Series" again sometime), even better than "1969 Live".

Enjoy, and be sure to seed.
