V.A. - Piccadilly Sunshine Part 1 (1968-70/2009)

Genre: UK, Pop Psychedelic

The Piccadilly Suns series sets foot into the deep and wondrous valleys of British Pop music culture. Daring to bring forth the once overlooked and sadly neglected songs that were laid to waste in a saturated wonderland of suburban teenage pop. Join us as we tiptoe barefoot and trip through the late 1965 and early yos in Great Britain's vast and glorious, cultural dustbin. Stepping amongst the twenty flower-powered trippers presented here, together we shall lovingly restore them their former glory.
