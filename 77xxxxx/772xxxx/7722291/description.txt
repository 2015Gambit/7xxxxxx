Another port on Wineskin. This time of RedLynx's Trials 2 Second Edition. It has been running on the latest wrapper and engine since updates last week, and this is the best config for running the game properly on my Mac's config.

My Mac's Config:

Early 2011 MacBook Pro
10.8.2 Mountain Lion.

The best way to unzip and run the game properly:
1. Unzip File.
2. Drag game to Desktop or Applications or wherever you want.
3. Open Game, should take a few minutes to figure out itself.

Happy Pirating :)

REMEMBER: IF YOU ARE ONLY NEW TO PORTING OR WINESKINNING, DO NOT TOUCH CHANGING THE SETTINGS IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO. IF YOU AN EXPERT AT WINESKIN GO FOR IT BUT IF IT DOESN'T WORK THE WAY YOU CHOSE IT, GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SETTINGS WHEN YOU GOT IT!
