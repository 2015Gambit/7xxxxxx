,chalotn,2012-10-14T07:15Z,"Thanks man you are awesome, i was thinking about you while watching the card, so excited to get the card in your quality (60fps), just a little dissapointed (not with you) that you dont have the main card that wouldve been epic.

Thanks again mate, cheers."

Hey, if someone wants to pay me $60 every PPV, I'll cap it! Lol! Not serious. It's too expensive for me though. "
,saffronsghost,2012-10-14T09:38Z,"Some of the worst seeds I've ever seen, but still thanks Sec."
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-14T14:14Z,Yeah I just noticed all seeds are dropping fast and no one is staying. I'll continue uploading again at 6MB/s for a few hours.
