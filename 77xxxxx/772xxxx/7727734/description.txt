Visions of Europe
Visions of Europe is a collection of sixteen episodes of Visions series, originally aired on Public Television and previously released in a ten disc boxed set in October of 2010. This collection includes the cities and countryside in places such as; Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Greece, and many Great Cities in the rest of Europe. The filming was done on helicopter mounted high-definition cameras. The result is some of the most beautiful looks at Europe that can be seen without leaving your home. The aerial views are amazing, giving you glimpses of the popular destinations that cannot be seen from the ground. Whether highlighting the vast untouched natural destinations, such as mountain ranges, lakes, and rivers, or the cities that are mixtures of old and new architecture, the episodes give breathtaking views. Even if you have been to some of the destinations, you will love to see them from the air. It gives the landscape a whole new look.



14)  Scotland 
See bonny Scotland as you never could, even on the most lavish tour. Thanks to a high-definition, helicopter-mounted camera, you soar effortlessly over Scotland's historic cities, tranquil villages, rugged highlands, and steel-blue lakes. See the country's legendary landmarks-the dizzying heights of Edinburgh's Castle Rock, immaculate greens of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, mysterious glacial waters of Loch Ness, and many more-from a unique aerial perspective. Chase wild deer across green hills splashed with yellow gorse. Swoop down on coastal villages so close that you can almost taste the sweet, smoky salmon. With a poetic narration and a soundtrack of authentic regional music, Visions of Scotland opens your eyes, ears, and heart to this legendary land.
