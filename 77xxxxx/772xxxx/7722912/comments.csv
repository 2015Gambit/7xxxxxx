,EnemyDrone,2012-10-13T11:28Z,Thanks for this. Will this work on PS3?
,DubCheezy,2012-10-13T18:44Z,"It won't work on Xbox360 cus 360 only plays .avi files.  Thats why I support releases in the .avi format.  Its a superior format in it's wide compatibility.  Check out SANTi's release, it's in .avi format and will work on all players including Ps3"
,oTipz,2012-10-13T18:53Z,God damn leechers -__- Does it kill you to leave Utorrent open?
,ben7530,2012-10-13T19:35Z,"@DubCheezy

I hope your wrong about x360 only playing .avi (I am a PS3 person)

Even the WII plays:AVI, MPEG, WMV, VOB, MOV!!!

So, really you should be campaigning for better video support from MS rather than advocating everyone use a *decades* old file format!"
,ben7530,2012-10-13T19:43Z,"@EnemyDrone

Yes. It should work fine."

,DubCheezy,2012-10-13T21:42Z,"Xbox 360 media plays does play AVI, MPEG, WMV, VOB, MOV.  But it doesn't play MKV or MP4 (you can trick it into playing some Mp4's by changing the filename extension to "".avi"")  I wish MS would upgrade the codec support for it's media player, but I have a better chance of advocating for .avi movies here on PB then I would advocating for a media player update on MS.  Plus other than file size, there nothing wrong with avi."
,maxwellsm,2012-10-13T21:56Z,Thanks!

Actually it does work on a 360 if you have the latest optional media update. It can be downloaded through xbox live. I have it on my RGH and the YIFY movies work fine. with the new update it plays pretty much all the video files except for mkv files. Thanks for all the quality uploads YIFY!"
,ippiki,2012-10-14T03:19Z,Been downloading for the past 5 hours and it's topped out at 1.7 kb/s. what gives?
,knobz2,2012-10-14T04:01Z,I dont understand how the quality can be that good if this is supposed to be 1080p but only 1.5gb and a BRrip ...this must be the worst 1080p ever
,vampi11,2012-10-14T17:13Z,you guys are awesome! Read the book people!!!

,Powerslave0,2012-10-16T07:18Z,"The Xbox360 plays MP4 files, but it has to be the right CODEC!  I have plenty MP4s that play on my Xbox360, without transcoding.  PS3 has a wider variety of codecs...  For Xbox360, they are mostly .AVI, but even they must be a codec it plays.  FOr example? Speed Racer H264.mp4 plays just fine, and any other MP4 that has the same codec, plays JUST FINE.  SO many wrong answers people give, is sickening. "
,toxicstone,2012-10-17T10:11Z,"People are getting dumber for each day, this isnt HD so why + it.FUCK."
,rupert3k,2012-10-17T12:37Z,"YIFY always offers the ultimate quality in files sized to suit everyone. Regardless of whether one chooses his 720p 750mb, 1080p 1.5gb or lossless MKV with DTS offerings you always know the quality will be second to none. YIFY FTW!"
,leelee421,2012-10-18T03:57Z,"YIFY.. PLEASE UPLOAD..

,Lebada3,2012-10-18T13:39Z,"God I hate these IFI torrents popping up when I search 1080p in torrentz dot eu

Do us all favor and ditch the 1080p. Perhaps put DVD or something like that.."

,LedBull,2012-10-24T20:34Z,"I asked this couple of time but no luck with a answer, maybe this time :-), when I download 720p movies I have problem with sound, picture and sound are not in sync, but when I download 1080p movie all is fine. I am talking about Yify's uploads. Does anyone have answer.
Thank you in advance! "
,preparationh,2012-10-26T12:23Z,YIFY!!! xD
,Dulla1,2012-10-27T05:39Z,you just one of the awesome people that upload great movies! thanks to you dear YIFY
,H2Kzero,2012-10-29T07:34Z,"If you want it to play on phone, xbox, or ps3 you need a converter. I recommend Freemake. It is free as FUCK! So uhh, yeah. Type in Freemake on Facebook the link. I use it to convert everything. Oh and it downloads videos from Youtube and other sites. "
,azulu,2012-11-05T23:25Z,"brilliant quality, really fast downloaded

,demmat,2012-11-10T21:03Z,Anyone have polish sub for this version? TIA
