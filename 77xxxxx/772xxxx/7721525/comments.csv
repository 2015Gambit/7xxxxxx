The digital signature checks but if you notice when you click details on the digital signature tab in properties it hangs for about 10 to 15 seconds (sometimes says it's not responding) and then say's it's ok. During the install (about half way through) I received a warning about an unrecognized file trying to run. It was named Ikernal.exe installer. Not in a hundred years would I have let it run, but I said to myself the digital signature is intact. So I let it run . . . Damn . Damn . Damn. Anyway take my word for it or not. If you have this installed on your system you are infected. Run Comodo Cleaning Essentials and see for yourself. Before anyone posts back and says it's a false positive it's not based on a signature but on the hidden registry keys. I double checked it with Sophos Anti-rootkit and it identified the hidden keys also. I don't know how the digital signature was faked, but my hats off to you. Also the keygen is fine in this torrent but the core keygen in the PaintShop pro X5 is trojan graybird."
