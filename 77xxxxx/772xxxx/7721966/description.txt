Unrepentant bebopper Sonny Stitt (1924-82) spent most of his life being compared 


unfavorably to BIRD.  This 1990 remaster of a 1958 Chicago session begs to differ.


The accompanying rhythm section is unknown/undocumented.


Stitt was equally adept at both alto and tenor as demonstrated herein.


Track #2 and #7 are my picks but #1 is close behind


No audible flaws in this remaster that I've noticed.
