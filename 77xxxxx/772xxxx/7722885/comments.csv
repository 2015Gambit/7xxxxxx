Great size for my 2nd tier shows (which I watch on my 32"" NTSC (old school) CRT from 12' away in my bedroom).
Because of the quality, it will not be my first choice for my favorite shows (which I watch on my 60"" LED LCD from 15' away in my living room).
But I truly appreciate the option !
Keep up the great Xvid work.
PS - Thanks for the descriptive titles.
PPS - I vote for stereo over mono audio."

Thank you for the feedback.

It does seem that comedies in the smaller format are much preferred over dramas. Don't know why.
