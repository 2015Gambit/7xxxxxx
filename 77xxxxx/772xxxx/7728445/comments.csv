Colors worse, the lack of precision"
,ChBukow,2012-11-20T12:58Z,"This is from an interlaced 60 FPS broadcast, and hasn't been properly brought back to its actual 24 FPS progressive source format. I.e., you have effectively 24 FPS played back at 60 FPS showing all the 3:2 pulldown's duplicate frames (creating stuttering (3 frames, 2 frames, 3 frames, 2 frames, etc.)) at effectively 540p (the resolution of each 1080i half-frame here encoded as progressive frames).

So, it's basically 540p at 24 BFPS (Broken Frames Per Second)

Surround audio is also badly downmixed to two channels.

A:1/10
V:1/10"
