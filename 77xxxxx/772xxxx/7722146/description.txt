This was a transitional album for Canadian jazz pianist Oscar Peterson (1925-2007)


Personnel changes had challenged him to evolve and he did so marvelously.


With drummer Louis Hayes and 2 different bassists he cut these classic tracks for 


the Limelight label in 1965 and 1966.


Track #1 and #8 (both Oscar originals) are standouts
