This already has a crazy number of leeches, and I can imagine its going to be pretty hard to keep this alive since apparently everyone and their dog learned how to use google.

Since your bandwidth is going to be split evenly between the 99% of people who are going to immediately disconnect when done, and the 1% of people who will seed an appropriate amount... just longer YOU need to keep yourself registered till the file is a gets to enough regs that it doesn't need your ocs. (I've got, eh, ""resources"" that would def assist in making that process faster.)


P.S. Been awhile since I've logged in, couldn't get my original account's password lol"

[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-15T18:29Z,"K heres what happened, severe outage here dropped me offline for almost 7 hours, its back up, fully uploading, i aint taking it down. Now for those wanting to help seed, how can you help seed via email? I already have the people on the list that will hold connection for me, its why theres still 3 seeders showing even cuz of the inet drop out."
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-15T19:32Z,"Sorry kids no 720..........but i got 1080 LOL, taking forever to get a copy pulled  cuz of the size difference, but you HD lovers will have your fix here soon enough"
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-15T19:45Z,"Correction! 720p is being posted in like 5 mins, 1080 is still coming, fiercely huge. Didnt know i had ripped 720 when i did the 1080."
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-15T21:02Z,"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7730820/Red_Bull_Stratos_Jump_Replay_-_720p_-_N2KMaster_Webripz 720 p version, 1080's coming taking forever for the conversion, the 720 has a 34 min clip instead of the 14 mins clip here."
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-17T00:18Z,"And another negative due to speeds, K people those +1 -1 votes arent for speeds, thats for reporting a fake. This isnt a god damn fake, i dont do fakes, notice the pink skull? Admins take note of who is doing that, these are legit rips, im working my ass off to get it out faster and they voting negatively cuz they aint getting the speed they desired. Thats pretty fucked up quite frankly. Ive been a member around here since like 2007, Not about to blow that cuz you wanna bitch about speed via utorrent and whine flagging it as a fake. Its not a fake. Need screenshots do you? I can certainly post them."
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-17T04:49Z,"Look at all you complainers now on this torrent, like do you realize now how complaining doesn't make it better especially when there's nothing that can be really done? 62 Seeders now on this. Patience young grasshoppers...."
