A hands-on guide to assist in the planning and execution of synthetic reactions in the laboratory
Despite the maturity of organic chemistry, it can still be very challenging to identify optimal methods for synthetic transformations that perform as well in real-world manufacturing processes as they do in the laboratory. This detailed and accessible guide attempts to address this vexing issue and deliver proven methodologies practicing synthetic chemists will find valuable for identifying reaction conditions that work reliably over the broadest possible range of substrates.

Practical Synthetic Organic Chemistry:
- Provides a practical guide to strategically planning and executing chemical syntheses for the bench chemist in industry
- Discusses information that is not common knowledge beyond the boundaries of process chemistry groups, such as the synthetic routes of selected contemporary pharmaceutical drugs and practical solvents, as well as green chemistry concepts
- Highlights key reactions, including substitutions, additions, eliminations, rearrangements, oxidations, and reductions
- Addresses basic principles, mechanisms, advantages and disadvantages of the methodology, and techniques for achieving laboratory success

Incorporating such an extraordinary wealth of information on organic chemistry and its related fields into one complete volume distinguishes Practical Synthetic Organic Chemistry as an incomparable desktop reference for professionals—and an invaluable study aid for students.
