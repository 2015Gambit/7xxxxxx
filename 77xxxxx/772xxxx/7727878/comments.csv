Nah its still rectangular in shape on the screen, but if you read the details you might find out that it has more pixels"
,bfc2012,2012-10-15T07:21Z,"To garfiel, to save yify answering:

this version:
RESOLUTION...................: 1200*720
FRAME RATE...................: 23.976 fps

last year's version:
[RESOLUTION]:...................[ 1200*720 
[FRAME RATE]:...................[ 23.976 fps

if you had read the details before posting, you might have found that the pixel display resolution and frame rate are the same for both versions."

,hobbesgg,2012-10-22T01:49Z,Video quality is not 10 as others mentioned.  Clearly visible artifacts from the beginning. 
,CosmAvngr,2012-10-23T03:21Z,"It's absurd someone gave this a 10 for Video quality. He must have watched it on a phone.

If watching on a TV, the quality of this is about a 2. Noise reduction + Sharpening + noisy source, means horrendous artifacts all the way through. I deleted this and kept an old DVD rip. "
