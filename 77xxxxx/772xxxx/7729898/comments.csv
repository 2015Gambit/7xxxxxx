,RR92,2012-11-19T08:08Z,">:O What? ""Great quality""? Are you serious? ""320kbps"" means nothing without frequency content. Open the file in an audio editor's spectrogram view and see that the frequency content is cut above 16kHz, when ""great quality"" is all the way up to 20kHz and above. Shit quality. Thanks for nothing. Downvoted."
