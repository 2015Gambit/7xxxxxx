,Ripclaw187,2012-10-13T19:45Z,Download may stop at 99.8%. This is fine. Game will extract and work. It's the Dishonored modded xex file I accidentally put in folder when I made the torrent that's missing. 
,inherited,2012-10-13T19:59Z,I'm downloading now i'll be playing offline [obviously] but thanks for the download and do you mind me asking what the dishonored xex is?
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-13T20:10Z,Fixed torrent Will download 100% now.
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-13T20:18Z,"If you replaced your Dishonored xex file with that modded one it would give you Infinite health, ammo, low gravity for ai, and Super Jump for player. However the low gravity caused freezing in my game whenever too many people got blow into the air. "
,sonic360rocks,2012-10-14T01:33Z,any assassin creed 3  up anywhere yet?
,humza100,2012-10-14T14:55Z,"Hi, can someone please post a simple guide on how to play this on an xbox, will it need to be modded? or can it simply be burned to a DVD? or can i plug a USB into the xbox and play it on that. I really want to play this but dont want to mod or open my xbox. Thanks"
,WasAtWoodstock,2012-10-16T00:27Z,"I don't have an Xbox. Nor do I play games. But anyone that connects online with this game will be permanently banned!

,locks04,2012-10-17T23:38Z,yup they are perma banning people i wouldnt even use it offline probably could still track it 
,gyhser,2012-10-20T08:05Z,Warning: Even when using this offline make sure you do a complete wipe before going back online. This is because the data saved from playing Halo 4 will still be on your Xbox and (potentially) perma ban you once you log back onto Xbox Live. Not trying to scare anyone or be a troll just looking out for everyone. Thanks for the up. 
,vasu16,2012-10-20T11:59Z,thanks for the good upload but the game is not working after 8th chapter forgot the chapter name but the level name is rally point alpha.the level doesn't load.please fix this.

,vhunterv,2012-10-27T05:14Z,"Can someone please tell me how to make it work? I have a xbox with rgh. After I extract the game, a folder named ""Halo 4 jtag-rgh rip"" containing maps and other things comes up, but I don't know what to do to transform it to GOD. Thanks for your help"
,Sp4rr0w,2012-10-27T14:48Z,vhunterv: Can u read? MISSION 7 unplayable! Why u still want to play this release?
,vhunterv,2012-10-28T02:16Z,"OK., sorry, of course I know how to read. But it seems to me that some users said they were able to fix the problem. "
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-28T03:06Z,"I'm sorry but the game is in fact corrupted. I downloaded it from nicoo7t . com and one of the rar files was corrupted. I didn't notice the first time because winrar extracted it anyway. When I tried extracting it in 7zip it told me it's corrupted. They no longer have links for the game anymore. I won't be re-uploading a fixed version because my brother received a letter from his cable company(Media-Com) stating he has been reported for downloading halo 4 online. Which he did from this site.
Sorry for the inconvenience."
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-28T03:36Z,"Here is a link for direct download links 1-3mbps however you will have register (it's free) to see them. Since I'm not re-uploading I found this instead.Sorry pirate-bay won't let you post outside links just delete the spaces and the link will work.
