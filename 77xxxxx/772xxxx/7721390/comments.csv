,Chronomical,2012-10-12T23:03Z,^ Holy crap that's a huge book.
,MonkeyMindUSB,2012-10-12T23:31Z,That is an astounding image.  Paul Levitz looks like he's going to have a hernia if he lifts the book overhead.  Thanks as always for posting!
,mrudgiantgodofhellfire,2012-10-14T03:29Z,I can only appreciate the effort that goes into an upload like this. Thanks very much. How in the world did u fit that thing on a scanner?
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-14T05:40Z,"mrudgiantgodofhellfire, full disclosure; I did not scan this book. In fact, unless I mention that I scanned something in the description, I haven't scanned most of the things I upload (a few - 40 or so - and more in the future, but not many at the moment). Just passing books along that are in my digital collection, or 'out there', that haven't hit TPB yet.

Also, truth be told, most of the time, I don't really care about scanner tag pages. I don't always remove them, but I definitely will if I'm making any changes to the file. I've done literally hundreds of restorations at this point and other than putting (Restored) in the name of the file (so people can compare and know which version is which) I make no note of the fact that ""I"" did anything to the book. I don't do it when I compile loose files into a Compendium, either. Nor do I include a scanner tag on the books that I do scan myself. 

I won't get into my reasoning, as I believe it's been discussed to death at this point. There are literally THOUSANDS of scanners around the globe at this point and they all do good work. ALL of their work is greatly appreciated and for as long as we read and share these files we'll always marvel at how cool it is that they took the time to make them available. And I'm just going to leave that right there.

In regards to THIS book, the original scan was actually four parts that totaled out right around 2 GB! They were BEAUTIFUL high resolution scans and the page dimensions were massive. Awesome for a private, personal collection, not so good for sharing. I pulled the images out of those original files (which were numbered in order, thankfully), changed the page dimensions to a size that is smaller, but not so small that you can't enlarge the images to read the any of the smaller text, and put them all back together as one volume.

However! In this particular case, I too wondered how the hell somebody got these beautiful scans?! I know some large (professional office type) printers have scanning functions (that's essentially what they are), and I'm guessing that's how it was done. There are also large (sometimes even upright) scanners that are used to scan artwork and other large pieces. Could have been done that way, as well. However it was done, a heartfelt thank you to the scanner who went to the effort to make this one available. I had intended to leave their tag at the end of the book and I simply forgot to do so."
