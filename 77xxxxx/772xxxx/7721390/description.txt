'75 Years Of DC Comics - The Art of Modern Mythmaking'

Taschen, 2010, 724 pages

Written by Paul Levitz


In 1935, DC Comics founder Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson published New Fun No. 1, the first comic book with all-new, original material, at a time when comic books were mere repositories for the castoffs of the newspaper strips. What was initially considered to be disposable media for children was well on its way to becoming the mythology of our time ΓÇö the 20th centuryΓÇÖs answer to Atlas or Zorro. More than 40,000 comic books later, in honor of the publisherΓÇÖs 75th anniversary, TASCHEN has produced the single most comprehensive book on DC Comics, in an XL edition even Superman might have trouble lifting (the actual book weighs 16 lbs, the file is much lighter). More than 2,000 images, covers and interiors, original illustrations, photographs, film stills, and collectibles, are reproduced using the latest technology to bring the story lines, the characters, and their creators to vibrant life as theyΓÇÖve never been seen before. Telling the tales behind the tomes is 38-year DC veteran Paul Levitz, whose in-depth essays trace the companyΓÇÖs history, from its pulp origins through to the future of digital publishing.

Year-by-year timelines that fold out to nearly four feet and biographies of the legends who built DC make this an invaluable reference for any comic book fan.
