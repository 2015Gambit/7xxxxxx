,helicon84,2012-10-12T12:04Z,Fantastic stuff. I'm just reading Locas having already read Palomar and other stuff by Gilbert. Thanks.

,sevenarts,2012-10-13T05:04Z,Thanks for all the great uploads lately. Jaime's my favorite. Any chance you have a bigger collection of L&R issue-by-issue scans than the incomplete set already uploaded here? 
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-15T22:16Z,"Hey sevenarts, I was positive I had responded to this before! Must not have hit submit.

I have a pretty (like 99%) complete run of all the single issue Love & Rockets and related releases. When I did the big run of Hernandez stuff before I tired to only upload books that weren't in the large L&R torrent already available at TPB. I could probably upload whatever it is you're looking for, but I don't like to double up on existing torrents. Let me know what you were thinking and I'll see what I can do."
,sevenarts,2012-10-16T23:57Z,"Thanks for responding! This is all the stuff I'm missing digital copies of:

v1 #1 (the other torrent's copy is actually a mislabled v2)
v1 #35-50
v2 #17-20
New Love #6
Luba's Comics and Stories #6-8
Measles #1, 4

I'd love to see any of this stuff get uploaded. I have most of this in book collections but would love to have all the issues digitally as well. Thanks!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-17T04:48Z,"OK sevenarts, good news and bad news.

Good news, yes, I have L&RV1 No 1 and 35-50. I also have L&RV2 17-20. Are those not in the big L&R torrent that's already up? (I don't seem to be able to look at torrent contents on TPB at the moment, otherwise I would have checked myself.)

Bad news, the other stuff you're looking for is the 1% that I don't have. Been looking for some of that stuff for years. It seems unlikely that it was never scanned, but nobody, ANYPLACE, is ever sharing it. "
,sevenarts,2012-10-17T05:26Z,"Yeah, the v1 and v2 issues I mentioned aren't in the other torrent for some reason - that torrent has a file labeled v1 #1 but it is actually just a dupe of v2 #1 instead. 

I figured some of that other stuff is just not out there. I appreciate you uploading what you have though. :)"
