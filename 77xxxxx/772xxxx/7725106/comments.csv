Is it possible for you to upload the newest episodes ASAP after they air? for some reason no one uploads them fast enough for this show!"
[T],duranie,2012-10-15T00:31Z,"Nope.. I do not have episode 8. 
If the scene missed it, I will try and catch it on an upcoming repeat. 
Sorry, I have too much going on in life to rush the episodes out.  They get posted whenever I have spare time.
Plus ANTM is extremely LOW priority for me.. as I completely hate the new format this season.
Hate it!"
[T],duranie,2012-10-15T02:46Z,Update.. a little googling revealed episode 8 airs Oct 19.
