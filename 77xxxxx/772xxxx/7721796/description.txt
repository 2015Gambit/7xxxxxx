From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, October 12 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the debate last night between the two establishment vice presidential candidates, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. 

He also talks about a disabled veteran who was labeled a terrorist for trying to investigate the cost of surveillance cameras. 

Alex covers the faltering economy Democrats insist on portraying as a rebound and the inexorable drift toward war. 

On today's broadcast, Alex welcomes back pastor Lindsey Williams.
