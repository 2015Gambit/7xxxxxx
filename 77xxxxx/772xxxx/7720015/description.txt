Worldwar is a series of novels by Harry Turtledove whose premise is an alien invasion of Earth in the middle of World War II. The military invasion begins on or around May 30, 1942, but the aliens, who call themselves the Race, reached Earth orbit in December 1941.

Although the Race, a reptilian species, has the advantage of superior technology, their last information on humans was collected by a robotic probe during the 12th century. The Race invaders are surprised to find that humanity has progressed far more rapidly any other species they had previously studied. Contrary to the Race's expectations, at the time of the invasion the Race's technology is only marginally more advanced than current 20th century Earth technology. As a result, the commander of the alien fleet considers turning back to the homeworld as opposed to initiating the invasion as originally instructed.

The narrative follows the intersecting fortunes of a large number of human and alien characters. Most notably the series depicts how the Axis and Allied powers must cooperate to fight the alien menace.
