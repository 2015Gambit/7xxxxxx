Twelve contestants arrive in Melbourne and meet each other and Alex in a graffiti-filled laneway where they are given their first challenge - they must create a garment that is the ultimate expression of who they are as designers. This year there is no immunity, but there are other advantages to winning! There are more shocks in store as Megan announces a twist that is a first for the show. 

A big thank you to all original cappers and posters
