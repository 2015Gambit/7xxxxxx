The one that got away?  Seattle a tough team!  But Shame on the Pats for letting them hang in there.  Almost 400yds but a poor game for TB~rarity!"

Do you ever consider the fact that most people would like to to download the game and watch it without knowing the outcome in advance?  Telling us the outcome is called a spoiler, and you're spoiling it for others."
