Full retail. ePub, Mobi, AZW3. To me personally by far one of the worst authors I've TRIED to read. Couldn't even get past the first 3 chapters of Twilight. Right up there with E. L. James and the Shades of Grey Trilogy (Which is funny cause it was originally a Twilight Fan - Fiction). Yes, this isn't my USUAL fiction reading which is why I say "TRIED". Harry Potter is better than this stuff.
