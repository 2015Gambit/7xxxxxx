,EXPERIMENTONGOD,2012-10-13T16:16Z,"I can confirm the ""Grossly Pixelated Error @ 18:01""

If you just want to watch the episode then it's not that bad but if you want to keep/burn the file then wait for the WEB-DL as MP4SUX suggested"

Thanks a lot DibyaTPB."
,.Leto.,2012-10-14T01:07Z,"Yes, it's almost unnoticeable. It's really not a problem. BTW I don't know if it's just me but season 5 has been quite boring so far. It's a good thing the end is near, it's time to stop this."
