,digitalmonster8928,2012-10-15T19:56Z,"Very great upload! Download was a little slow, 500kb/sec but nothing to cry about due to everyone downloading at once. Great show, super cool 1st esp, loved it. Quality was good and what I expected for a 720p. A lot of dark scenes at end of show it looked really great. Thanks for a great upload Protoyu, I'll be looking for you next Sunday.

,RiverRaidII,2012-10-16T23:05Z,"I grew up on 56k modem, so everything over 3kb/s is well alive. 100kb/s is warp speed. 1mb/s... Is this reality? Is this just fantasy? Of course I would curse too if I don't get my paid content on piratebay in an acceptable time span. "
