,GigoloAunt111,2012-10-15T15:50Z,"Was having the crash on day 2 (like most others) even with the update v1.0.0.2. For me, I got around the problem by dropping my graphics settings all to minimum, no AA, no AF, no bloom etc. Once I got past the 'crash spot' I changed graphics back up to maximum ...all good :)
Try it, it may work 4 u 2! "
