If your having trouble with your install, use the volume license edition which you'll find at the link below. No key is required during install. Activate after install with the tool provided in the torrent. It doesn't have SP1 included but i'll upload a version with the SP1 ""slipstreamed"" into it as soon as i get the time. Hope this helps you guys out ;-)

,Tanlic,2012-10-24T07:58Z,Why all this crap about phoning people? I'm in a condo where everyone goes through the same system for their internet so I don't have a land line phone so I couldn't reply to the Bitch or hear her so I got stuck with a pop up asking me tor activate it. Then I read you don't have to use the phone just trun off you virus protection run the tool kit and run ez activator and your done.....working for me so far.
