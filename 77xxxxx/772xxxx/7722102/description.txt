Not to be confused with the '50s vocal group featuring Andy Williams, these Williams Brothers are the guitarists Andrew and David. Before recording on their own, they played in T-Bone Burnett's band and also backed up Brian Setzer. This was their biggest hit, it's a moving song about missing someone who has passed away and the helplessness that comes from never being able to see that person again. It has since been covered by several other artists, including Smokie and Christine Collister. (thanks, Mike - Santa Barbara, CA)
