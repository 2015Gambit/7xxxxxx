Teddy Wilson (1912-86) was perhaps the definitive "swing" pianist.


This is #548 in the chronological classics series.  It includes what are arguably


Billie Holiday's finest recordings..trks# 5,6,7,8,15,16,17,18    Lester Young and 


Chu Berry contribute very lyrical tenor solos.  Teddy solos on trks# 9,10


I've compressed this upload with FLAC because the recordings are at least 70 years 


old and a little processing isn't going to hurt the sound at this point.
