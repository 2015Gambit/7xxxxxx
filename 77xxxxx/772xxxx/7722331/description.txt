Let me introduce to you our fortyFive series of releases. fortyFives are our take on the classic 7" single format. An A side, a B side and tracks no longer than 6 minutes in length. Because of this, itΓÇÖs the perfect format to allow us the freedom to quickly surprise you with new music any day of the week by any current or future artists. They send us the music, we quickly get it to you.

For this premiere fortyFive, weΓÇÖve got a little something by blocSonicΓÇÖs founder and creator Mike Gregoire aka mGee. Later this year heΓÇÖs serving as a guinea pig to test out a new hybrid release model with a two part album release, ΓÇ£Tourist Trap, Parts 1 & 2ΓÇ¥ (more details to come later this year). Until then, he plans on releasing the occasional fortyFive for you to enjoy.

On this one youΓÇÖll find a brand new track called ΓÇ£StandΓÇ¥ which samples the great Josh Woodward song ΓÇ£Let It InΓÇ¥ and a remastered and updated version of the first track he released via mgee.blocsonic.com back in 2010, ΓÇ£Kick It Along The Transit Line (fortyFive Version)ΓÇ¥.

We hope you enjoy the fortyFive series and all the goodies that itΓÇÖs sure to bring. RememberΓÇª everything we release is cool to share! Always keep the music movingΓÇª share itΓÇª blog itΓÇª podcast it! If youΓÇÖre in radioΓÇª support independent music and broadcast it!
