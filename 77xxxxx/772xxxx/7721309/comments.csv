and you were right about ridge's exit... im still trying to wrap my head around how ridiculous this is. Ridge would never leave brooke over something this stupid.

I hear that Bell is going to be bringing him back in December for Stephanie's funeral though, so he's not gone for good. I think he's planning on recasting him though... if thats the case, I'd rather he stay gone.

Ronn Moss has been Ridge for too long now... a recast is out of the question"
