,sbm_from_la,2012-10-14T19:20Z,800 MB for a 20 min. cartoon is a bit much... I'm sure the quality is great (maybe) but the size is still too large.  200 MB would be a much better size limit.

Whytf do people bitch about the size of files? Who gives a shit unless you're on one of those shittastic ISP that cap your bandwidth, in which case get a clue its 2012 go get Charter or Comcast ffs. Otherwise STFU OR GTFO .

Thanks Loadstone, for the UP. good quality and with a modern internet connection only took a few mins. "
