Talked to some friends in the UK that said it was the BBC that had signal problems. So regardless of the programming provider, all versions of this will still have the same missing segment of video since it was the broadcaster itself that had the problem. Do not blame the uploader or the programming/cable providers since they have no control over when the BBC has tech issues."
,1OddBall,2012-10-14T04:13Z,This proper seems to have some audio issues.  Is anyone else experiencing them?  I am using vlc player.
,drakeluvr,2012-10-14T09:20Z,"@scarletteSpider Thanks for the info, I was wondering. It probably won't bother me too much, and then when it comes out in the US I might be able to find a decent version, but I'm one of those impatient people and want to see the new season now, LOL."
,dibbledibes,2012-10-14T09:25Z,Had no problems with media player except of course for the blank video section. Thanks for the explanation.
[T],ajaxen94,2012-10-14T10:50Z,i am writing this comment to clear up the picture and audio problems there seems to be with this episode i watched it while it was being broadcast and there was no blank picture with only audio anywhere that i saw and i have also checked my own recording which i did from my computer card and there was no problem there so i can only say that the encoding was in error if it was recorded from the BBC

,CosmAvngr,2012-10-14T15:44Z,"I haven't watched it through. By I checked 7:11 to 8:30, and scanned around. 

I see no blank section in this one. "
