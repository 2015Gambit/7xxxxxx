,DyO152,2012-10-14T15:16Z,"This is a VHD file with Windows 95 on it
This is type of file is used with Virtual PC to EMULATE (not simulate)  an Operating System
This VHD file has Windows 95 on it,as i said.
And no,it can't damage your computer or your Windows"
,KillerG4,2012-10-15T02:19Z,lol...and why to do it; 
,DyO152,2012-10-15T19:55Z,"For fun, I backup the VHD file up because I like breaking it....download viruses,deleting system files...after that, when it's all damaged and it can't start,restore the VHD i've backed up and do the same again...different viruses and different files deleted,you don't know how fun it is to mess with the drivers :D

This can be useful if there is some kind of program that can ONLY run on Windows 95.
I hope you understand."
