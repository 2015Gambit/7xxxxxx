NOTE: I do not have constant normal Internet access like all of you, as I am a poor college student.  I steal it from a random neighbor, whose data is capped due to their ISP, Charter, so they do not have it on for more than a few hours a day.  Some days, their Internet is not on at all, so, this upload may take a week, if not more.  Please be patient!

NOTE:  There are NO English Subtitles, as I was unable to find any that worked with my source.  The only subtitles I was able to find were HDTV rips that even when ΓÇ£synchedΓÇ¥ up with my encodes got off a good amount at times.  So, I decided to not include them.

All files are .mp4, ranging from 632mb-803mb, with an average size of ~691mb.
