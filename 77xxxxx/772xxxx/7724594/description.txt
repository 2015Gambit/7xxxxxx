                            Season 3 Webisodes


For the second consecutive year, AMCTV.com is launching The Walking Dead original webisodes. Titled "Cold Storage," the web series is developed, produced and directed by Emmy Award winning special effects guru Greg Nicotero. The four, five-minute shorts were produced by Generate for AMC and are now live on AMCTV.com.

"Cold Storage" tells the story of a young man, Chase (played by Josh Stewart), trying to reach his sister in the early days of the zombie apocalypse. He finds temporary shelter in a storage facility run by a former employee named BJ (played Daniel Roebuck); however, things are not what they appear.

In addition to Stewart (The Dark Knight Rises) and Roebuck (Lost), the cast of "Cold Storage" includes Cerina Vincent (Cabin Fever) as Kelly and Chris Nelson (Kill Bill) as Harris.


"It's such a thrill to revisit the The Walking Dead world from a new perspective and tell a bit of a darker story this time around with the webisodes," said Nicotero. We had a terrific cast, and once again the crew came up with some killer walker gags and visual effects. This year there's a clear nod to the 'show' but our story could definitely exist on it's own as the 'what if' story of The Walking Dead."
