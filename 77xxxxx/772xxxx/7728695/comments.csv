any chance you can upload the latest episode of Revenge, Homeland, and 666Park Avenue?
If I had the power I would award you a skull.
Thanks again"
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-15T07:53Z,"666 just posted - slight delay to manage bandwidth.

I'll see about the other two. Don't watch them personally, but maybe overnight."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-15T07:58Z,"OK, keep forgetting about Homeland - I actually meant to do that.

As for Revenge, it's a LOL / DIMENSION cap, which means I won't post it until I verify it has no ""Gross Pixelation Errors"". But I don't watch it, so I'll keep my eyes open for a WEB-DL and try to fit it in then. May be tomorrow, but I'm still waiting on a decent copy of the latest SVU.

So, no promises.

Is there some problem with the AFG encodes?

Hate to go to the effort without a good reason.

Let me know.

,genocide44,2012-10-15T16:06Z,first few of the avg encodes of supernatural  have had the annoying pixelation glitch looking for another source glitch free
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-15T22:02Z,"""pixelation"" is the MAGIC word!

I'll see what I can do.

LOL / DIMENSION is known for this kind of damaged encode since they began MP4 earlier this year.

It's the whole reason I'm here doing this.

Thanks for the info!

AVIGUY"
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-15T22:35Z,"As I am documenting all of this, it would be helpful if you could tell me where in what episode you experienced the ""Gross pixelation Errors"".

,genocide44,2012-10-16T00:14Z,episode 1 and 3 had pixelation errors 
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-16T02:12Z,"I presume you mean 1 & 2 as 3 won't broadcast until the 17th.
