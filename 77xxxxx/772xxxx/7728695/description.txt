OK, ready for a math lesson?
Or maybe you just want to know why I use 640x360 instead of 624x352 or 720x400?

Well, there's this odd reason for 1920x1080 (1080p) & 1280x720 (720p) & mine.
1920+1080=3000
1280+720=2000
640+360=1000

I don't know that there's any real significance to round thousands, but the industry
seems to like them, so who am I to complain. Plus, when re-encoding from 1080p or
720p, it strikes me as an easy conversion as 360+360=720 & 720+360=1080.

The calculation is easy - H+W=X*1000. You do X=5, here's X=1-4:

Aspect ratio is 16:9 | 16+9=25
1000/25=40 | 16*40=640 | 9*40=360
2000/25=80 | 16*80=1280 | 9*80=720
3000/25=120 | 16*120=1920 | 9*120=1080
4000/25=160 | 16*160=2560 | 9*160=1440

Yes?
