I've been looking everywhere for a torrent for this, but couldn't find any.  When I finally got it, I decided to upload it to TPB so everyone else can use it too.

This is a modified version of the popular game Minecraft that makes griefing a lot easier.  Griefing is basically razing your enemy's buildings and towns.  However, it can be pretty difficult when you're bound to the normal rules of Minecaft.  In this torrent, I have included the modified Minecraft client, a batch file that automates it's installation in Windows (sorry Mac and Linux users, but you'll have to follow the instructions manually), a list of accounts, most of which usable, and 6 Spamfiles, and instructions on how to install.  To use the accounts, simply go to "Account settings" under "Multiplayer". 

Here's a few of the abilities this client gives you:
- Customizable X-ray vision that lets you see through everything but what you choose.
- Creative Nuker will allow automatically delete all blocks around you.
- FullBright which removes all darkness for you.
- Customizable High Jump abilities allow you to choose how high to jump.
- NoFall makes you immune to damage inflicted from falling a large distance.
- Build modes allow you to automatically build either a pole, floor, wall, or swastika.
- And many, many more.

I included a full guide, along with keybinds in the README as well.  Anyways, here's how to install Nodus Griefing Client:

I hope everyone has had as much with this as I have!
If you have any questions, feel free to PM me.
Special thanks to Stonecold1995 for making the quick installation program for Windows (yeah, I know it's simple but I can't into even batch files) and of course, Scetch for making the client itself.

If you would like to download Nodus from it's original site, you can visit Sceth's website.
