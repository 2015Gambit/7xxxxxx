Alex Perry, set out to create a XXX Victorian melodrama and went over-the-top with REBECCA, touted as the most beautiful porn film ever made.
Christoph Clark is perfectly cast as the villain of the piece, a decadent womanizer who repeatedly degrades and humiliates his lovely wife, Rebecca (played by Euro superstar Anita Rinaldi). His behavior is so outlandishly reprehensible that the viewer may take it to be nearly satirical, but via a final reel reveal it all makes perfect sense in retrospect.

Clark flaunts his mistress Jolanda (delightfully played in uninhibited fashion by Simona Valli). The beautiful Pussy Kat is a sexy maid, also getting down on occasion.
The principal plot line concerns Clark's seeming jealousy about his wife's clinging to memories of an old flame, a riding instructor long since dead. Gerry Pike, quite good in a dual role, plays not only the instructor in flashback but the family's young groom, who we finally find out is the instructor's son.
The key twist is that Clark has been behaving badly all along to drive Rinaldi away from him. He turns out to be amazingly selfless -- knowing he's to die soon from a wasting condition (his coughing is the key hint throughout) -- he doesn't want his wife to be heartbroken.
