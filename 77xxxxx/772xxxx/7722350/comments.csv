4.) You will be automatically prompted to update with a USB stick, with a CD / DVD it should say Mixed Media Disc, power down the 360 and power it on again. You should be ask to update before the 360 boots to the dashboard.
5.) Once the update is complete your Xbox 360 will restart then boot up to the new dashboard. Enjoy!

,notdone23,2012-10-16T10:06Z,If you dont use a Liteon IHAS burner you wont be able to burn the entire disc. LT 3.0 discs are 8.7 gb Whatever DVD burner you have will only burn to max 8.5gb. I burned it at 2.4x It verified the disc popped it into xbox360 it needed to install an update which was already on disc. Its an awesome game. 
,dadicer,2012-10-16T14:32Z,"LOL you guys that say it must be a bad copy that had a scratch are killing me!  It fails because you burned it on the wrong type of media and/or don't have the write type of burner.

Not going to help you guys either because there are tons of guides available out there.  Quit being lazy and go read one!!"

,Smallz94,2012-10-18T04:46Z,you need a modded xbox to play this^
,punkfreak123,2012-10-18T13:08Z,"Well, I ended up getting console banned after only playing the game for about 5 minutes. Even if you aren't using multiplayer do not connect online with a system that has played the game until launch or you will get banned."
,wakymaky666,2012-10-18T14:32Z,its been 16 h 27 m downloading and its only done 1.80 GB its uploaded triple the amount iv downloaded.. stop beeing stindgy and upload the game normaly people..

Wow man.. Make another offline account so you can play the campaign safe and offline. You are stupid. XBOX LIVE TEAM can still see you what you are playing even though are not connected to multiplayer mode. SMFH!!!!!!!!!! "

,Powerslave0,2012-10-19T06:47Z,"Works with Wasabi, must have Dashboard Version 2.0.15572.0 to run.  You do not need to be on 2.0.16197.0 version for Halo 4. 

Microsoft is actively banning consoles and accounts if you sign in to live with the title early.  Your profile/account  will also be banned till 30/12/9999. 

IF you want to play, and keep your achievements, pull your LAN cable or shut off WiFi.  Then, set your console's date to 11/8/2012 (two days after release), then DO NOT go on-line until that day. "
,punkfreak123,2012-10-19T15:00Z,I don't give a shit that this console got banned. I knew it was a possibility before I even put in the game. Have a couple other consoles that are unbanned so I will be back come launch.
,koooor,2012-10-19T21:21Z,just to let you all know my dad played this game offline then took the game out the drive n signed in to xbox live with a totally legit game in the drive and his console got banned so if u do play it id wait till the release date b4 u sign in 2 xbox live

,Smallz94,2012-10-21T04:37Z,"@Recon118

Look up on youtube!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Guys, this game is really good. I am sooo going to buy this to support the developers. This goes with Black ops 2. Here is a tip for you guys. If you know the game is going to be really good for online and you know that you are going to spend time with it alot such as black ops 2 and halo 4, buy it! If you dont, good luck :) I rather be safe and buy the games. But assassin creed 3 i will definitely download it because it is mostly story mode than online. :)  "
