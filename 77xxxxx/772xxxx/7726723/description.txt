Sketch is a designersΓÇÖ dream toolbox. Specifically created for designers, it powers a beautiful interface and powerful tools. Tools every designer will appreciate. HereΓÇÖs one feature ΓÇö multiple shadows per layer. Making beautiful graphics isnΓÇÖt challenging anymore. We set out to build a better app for graphic designers. Not to copy ΓÇö rather to improve.

The vector tools and basic shapes are a fantastic starting point for any drawing, whether you design for web, icons, and more. Sketch has more advanced layer style options than you can dream of: multiple shadows, multiple fills, gradients, noise, blending, blur, and more. To top it off, Sketch has boolean operations to combine multiple shapes into much more complex ones ΓÇö all of this is non- destructive. Forever.

Coming from the developers of Fontcase, text rendering is as good as it can get. Sketch also supports OS XΓÇÖs built-in versions and auto-saving. To ensure youΓÇÖll never lose any files.

All this power is deliciously baked into SketchΓÇÖs single-window interface. Everything is there, but only visible when you need it. A simple interface with seriously powerful tools.

Now everything is possible.

Take a look at the screenshots to see creations made with Sketch.
