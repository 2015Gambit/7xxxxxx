,shamanist,2012-10-16T07:56Z,"Matthew Bracken is a wingnut from the Free Republic forums and former Navy SEAL who has written several self published novels.
Enemies Foreign and Domestic
Domestic Enemies: The Reconquista
Foreign Enemies and Traitors
Bracken's novels are part of a recent glut of self published apocalypse fiction incorporating libertarian, populist, survivalist, xenophobic and ultra-conservative themes and rhetoric. Bracken is strictly a conservative, although due to the genre he is writing in his books are unfortunately read by the same people who eagerly devour the obscure novels by John Ross, Neo Andersen, Boston T. Party, David Crawford and James Wesley Rawles. The typical reader of this sort of fiction is someone with libertarian leanings who doesn't entirely ""get"" libertarianism (especially its non-violent aspects and its wonky roots in Austrian economic theory), and conflates it on several points with militarism, nationalism and nativism.
In short, Mr. Bracken knows his audience and knows how to push all their patriotic, flag waving, paranoid, anti-Mexican, anti-Muslim, nationalist, violence-fetishist buttons. A key piece of evidence is in those dumb book titles. ""Enemies"", ""foreign"" and ""traitors"" are spat out as epithets and the order simply rearranged for each new book.
On the positive side, at least Bracken's novels give these people something to read other than The Turner Diaries, and giving someone one less reason to read The Turner Diaries is probably doing society a favor, however small.~~~from rationalwiki"
