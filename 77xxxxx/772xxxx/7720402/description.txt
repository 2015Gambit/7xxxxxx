It was brought to my attention that my torrent for this mini-series was no longer effective. I confirmed that fact. I then examined my torrent catalogue and found, to my amazement, that there were in fact three such torrents listed. I then deleted tham all and created a new one. It is now seeding. I attempted to delete my previous PirateBay upload of Love for Lydia (1977). In the past I have had difficulty doing that. So, in order to succeed, I am naming my new upload of the very same information and "update" in hopes of by-passing PirateBay's efforts to call this new upload an attempt to upload a torrent already uploaded.

Anyway, we will see. The information is the same as the original. The name is different.

I apologize for the confustion. After all, I'm an 87-year-old fighter pilot from both World War II and The Korean War. One can't expect too much from such a man!
