,HarleyVRodRed,2012-10-15T13:39Z,This particular version has some playback issues. My WD dropped it 3 times while watching. Had to start over and fast forward past stop locations/time.

,sndman148,2012-10-15T19:20Z,I second @HarleyVRodRed on the playback issue. Tried it on both of my WD boxes and it dropped three or four times. Only works if you start it again and then fast forward through those parts.

This is unacceptable. If you cannot upload a playable torrent, don;t upload at all. A waste of  my precious time."
