Plot: A nameless fallen angel descends to Earth seeking redemption for the death of a young innocent who perished while under his protection in this supernatural thriller from writer/producer/director Jamil Dehlavi. Sixteen years ago, the angel appeared on Earth. His mission was to protect a child, but he failed. Now the angel is back. He’s taken human form, but the wounds on his back betray his appearance. As Lucille prepares to confess to a priest, it soon becomes apparent that the angel may be nothing more than a personification of a grieving mother’s all-consuming madness.
