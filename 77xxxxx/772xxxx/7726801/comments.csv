,DipShiz,2012-10-15T05:29Z,Anyone know if this works with the modded WillowFile?
,kingcover,2012-10-15T06:26Z,"Broke my original Borderlands 2 KaOs install so this one might need a repack and re-up.  I'm reinstalling just the update again to see if it'll work.  If not, I'll try fresh install of both with no created chars and report back the results.  Windows 8 CP 64bit.

Thanks for the ups! :D"
,Pink_Taco,2012-10-15T06:59Z,same here game just crashes saying fatal error
,kingcover,2012-10-15T07:18Z,"Nope, still no dice.  This update needs to be nuked and remastered gansuk.  I tried everything and believe me, I'm a vet at this stuff, have been doing it since Warez back in the early 90's, so when I say it doesn't work, it doesn't work! :P  However, I AM using Windows 8 CP 64bit, but that's never been an issue before and your original BL2 install works a treat so...."
,Bean-Bandit,2012-10-15T07:28Z,If you had check Skidrows web site you would have already known that people are having issues with this. If you don't want to have to reinstall your game then wait for the fix.
,kingcover,2012-10-15T07:47Z,"It doesn't delete your save games so wtf are you ragging about?  Just re-install, play without update and wait for repack, simple as that.  Sheesh, take a chill pill Bean-Bandit.    "
,thegreatwent,2012-10-15T10:40Z,"hey king, can you tell me what file stores all my saves, i impatiently installed this hehe...would like to keep my game so far"
,rguy,2012-10-15T12:01Z,to help u man lol if u havent figured it out or gooogled it in my docs under user whatever user u r in windows my games borderlands save data ans its something like 7126... blah blah idk iam sure u get it there is a profile and then theres ur sav. files all u need is the sav. files not profile grab them put them somethwere else ur desktop perhaps and reinstall put them back when ur done u might think about deleteing that borderlands folder under my games it gets generated after the first launch of borderlands just to make sure ur fresh installing it dont worry itll make a new and put ur sav. files back where they belong 
,hopedeny,2012-10-15T15:12Z,"rguy
the occasional period or comma would do wonders for you. youre speaking utter gibberish."
,kingcover,2012-10-15T15:15Z,"rguy is correct but english not so good lol :P  but still right. :D  Even easier is this:  Go to Libraries/Documents/My Games/Borderlands 2/WillowGame/SavaData/765611.....(bunch of numbers).   Here you will find all your savegames for it.  KoAs ripps usually have to be manually removed rather than using a uninstaller program, which in my opinion is great!  No remnents that are unwanted left behind when you delete the folder, just use ccleaner to pick up the mess in the registry when you delete the game or you are tired of it. ;)  Hope that helps!"
,kingcover,2012-10-15T15:21Z,"NOTE:  I also tried Skidrows update with this KoAs BL2 release and it also does not work so don't bother trying it.  Both versions need to be nuked and redone, which I'm sure the scene will have out either sometime today or within the week.  Let's be patient and thank them for their epicness! :D"
,thegreatwent,2012-10-15T17:29Z,"ah thanks for the reply guys, foolishly i just deleted it all, nm lol.....wasn't that far in, i'l reinstall and play sometime soon, theres alot to play at the moment!"
,thegreatwent,2012-10-15T17:31Z,"errr games i meaning lol......and yes KaOs/BlackBox are becoming my faves, many thanks to them"
,kingcover,2012-10-15T19:27Z,"I did the same thing lol.  Then I realized, ""shit, they may just need to put out a fix file instead of re-upping the whole shubam"".  Thankfully remembered to restore the update from recycle bin before ccleaner did it's business. xD"
,Bean-Bandit,2012-10-15T20:08Z,"@kingcover
Who said anything about about deleting your saved games? Learn to read jack ass.

All I said is that this new crack is not working and it's breaking the game."
,osano,2012-10-16T00:53Z,"thanks for this upload, I finally get to mine to work with this, however, it only worked when I renamed the folder to the one KaOs suggested the folder is meant to be named. ""BorderLands.2-KaOs"""
,doritoman,2012-10-17T02:34Z,"@KaOs and Gansuk, thank you for all of your uploads, as always it works just fine.

Windows 7 64bit.

if anyone is having issues its either a windows 8 problem or something you've done to mess up your files, if untouched this update works fine."
,fluster84,2012-10-17T15:04Z,"How I got it to work on WinXP 32
======================

1. Backup your savedata, it's in -- My Documents/My Games/Borderlands 2/WillowGame/SavaData/765611

2. Install this DLC package manually (unrar to game directory and then run unpack.bat)

3. Download and install STEAM (google it)

4. Play the game

You do not need to have steam running, just make sure that you have it installed on your system"
,Adriano171717,2012-10-27T14:53Z,Notes say includes dlc season pass...does this mean i can download future dlc and it will work on my game without need to download any future cracked dlcs?
