Get Ready is the seventh studio album by the English rock band New Order. Released in August 2001 by London Records, this was the group's first album in eight years, following 1993's Republic.

Peter Hook said of the album's title, "The title of the album is 'Get Ready' so it could mean anything or nothing. I thought it was just nice, New Order, 'Get Ready', 'cos we are, we're getting ready for the next phase of our musical lives both physically and mentally so it's quite a simple thing but it's very pertinent."

The album was dedicated to Rob Gretton, the manager of Joy Division and New Order, who died in 1999.

The album features a cover art directed by Peter Saville and designed by Howard Wakefield who have also designed covers for New Order and Joy Division albums. The cover model is German actress Nicolette Krebitz.
