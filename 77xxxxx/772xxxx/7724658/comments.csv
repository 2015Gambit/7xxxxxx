Chaykin - accept no substitutes!
The original recipe - made with seven herbs and Chaykin!
No fillers or preservatives - just 100% Chaykin!

Thanks again, lol!"

You're most welcome, keviner. I'm all chayked up by your gratitude and kind words. I've uploaded all the Chaykin I have now, but if I run into any more I'll be sure to pass it along."
