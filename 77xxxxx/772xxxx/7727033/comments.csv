Your other upload of this has been deleted."

,jlgagne,2012-10-23T10:17Z,Loads into Kontakt fine but it appears some of the samples are missing. The multis don't load and show up with the error message that asks you to manually find the samples. Also some of the instruments' samples cannot be found either.

,kaffekopp1243,2012-11-14T14:28Z,"Cannot add the instruments in Kontakt (5). Error message; ""This patch is encrypted and cannot be loaded unless
the respective Library is registered properly""
Any suggestions?"
,hxc1234,2012-11-14T16:52Z,"everything works perfectly . loads into kontakt and unzips great. all metal kits load thats all i really wanted to use so thank you for this torrent. only problem is how do we register it? 

please someone figure it out! and post it on here thanks "
,hxc1234,2012-11-14T17:07Z,i found the problem its just there is no serial attached to the files so on native instrument service center you are required to enter serial 
,johnnyjclark,2012-11-23T12:58Z,"I just unziped it and place the whole folder into the destination for my Kontakt instruments.  Then open Kontatk, and add library and Boom!  All there!  You must have a working instance of Kontakt to use this."
,hxc1234,2012-11-24T22:33Z,"are u sure you dont get the demo thing after using it even though you added it to kontakt 4 folder?
