,DngnRdr,2012-10-13T23:47Z,Apparently this release is missing about a minute and a half of video (around the 7min mark) where audio continues but no picture - not sure if this was encoding or broadcast issue.
,Srsbznz,2012-10-13T23:54Z,07:11 - 08:30 is just a beige image with sound.
,WoundedWolfgirl,2012-10-13T23:57Z,"Corrupted from 7:11 to 8:30. The video is gone, but the audio remains."
[T],ajaxen94,2012-10-14T10:57Z,i am writing this comment to clear up the picture and audio problems there seems to be with this episode i watched it while it was being broadcast and there was no blank picture with only audio anywhere that i saw and i have also checked my own recording which i did from my computer card and there was no problem there so i can only say that the encoding was in error if it was recorded from the BBC
