Unusual, late opus from musical genius Bill Evans.  I must confess that I thought 


the whole concept too "commercial" at first.... but this really deserves a good 


listen.....it's no more dubious than jazz albums with strings.  


On these later albums Bill Evans used Fender RHODES electric piano quite often.


Besides Toots' harmonica, Larry Schneider plays saxes and flute to complete the 


quintet on some tracks.


My goal is to not bore you.
