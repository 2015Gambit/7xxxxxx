Plot:


At the age of 9, Abraham Lincoln witnesses his

mother being killed by a vampire, Jack Barts. So 10

years later, he unsuccessfully tries to eliminate

Barts but in the process makes the acquaintance of

Henry Sturgess who teaches him how to fight and what

is required to kill a vampire. 

The quid pro quo is that Abe will kill only those

vampires that Henry directs him to. Abe relocates to

Springfield where he gets a job as a store clerk

while he studies the law and kills vampires by

night. 

He also meets and eventually marries the pretty Mary

Todd. 

Many years later as President of the United States,

he comes to realize that vampires are fighting with

the Confederate forces. 

As a result he mounts his own campaign to defeat

them.
