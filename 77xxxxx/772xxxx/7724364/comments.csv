Because it was owned by United Artist, it wasn't first made available on CD until Ryko got ahold of it in 1997. If Ryko's only had a one-shot deal, the ZFT/UMe may have to renegotiate it's release all over again. In any event, these shares are a thing of beauty for those of us who already own the vinyl and both sets of Ryko/BP CDs, thanks Cy!"
