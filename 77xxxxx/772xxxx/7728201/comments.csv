,Mk3Cyrax,2012-10-15T04:54Z,awesome upload
,thee3p,2012-10-15T04:58Z,"Let me rephrase that last comment of mine his pink skull doesn't mean shit to me. If you guy(s) can put your trust in him, I will too by downloading but I will still run it through my virus scanners before I open the file. I like not paying for movies, and TV. I thank you for your work, but I'm sure people still abuse this pink skull bullshit."

,WilfiePooh,2012-10-15T05:33Z,"That's legit but in my opinion the quality is not worth 1.1gb, looks like regular SD upscaled to 720p.  A:9 / V:6"
,stratftw,2012-10-15T06:02Z,"guys be careful. I'm not making an accusation as I have not examined this torrent. 
If I were trying to ""remote exploit ya I'd start with 
http://1337day.com/exploits/19480  -- generates an .mp4 that causes a buffer overflow on MediaplayerClassic
VLC? libpng has problems. upgrade after 2.00(if they patched it yet)
http://1337day.com/exploits/19539
and this one is cute
http://1337day.com/exploits/18184 -no vlc to run my malcrafted mp4? no problem i'll d/l it for you.

None of the above PoC's were written by me.  "
,Charlie117,2012-10-15T06:16Z,"Well, just downloaded and it's the real deal.
Quality A/9 V/7

,gusfring,2012-10-15T13:36Z,"Can my 360 play this file type? I know h264 can, but it has to be an mp4 - 2 channel audio though. I would appreciate any response. thanks."
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-15T13:40Z,"@gusfring
Should play on Xbox 360/PS3 if you change the file extension to .mpg or .mpeg. It's possible it may also just work as-is. Haven't tested. Reports from other users have said this method works."
,gusfring,2012-10-15T14:01Z,"Thanks, dude. I'll let you know how it goes. "
,gulranek,2012-10-15T14:07Z,"It's legit, but video quality is nowhere near 720p standards. It just looks like a 480p upscaled to 720p. :/"
,PSotero,2012-10-15T14:35Z,Poor quality.
,betataster,2012-10-15T18:56Z,Agree. Poor 480p quality. Waste of time if you are looking for HD.
,gulranek,2012-10-15T20:25Z,"Btw, it's 60 fps for some reason... Pure bullshit."
,Fapguy,2012-10-16T03:19Z,"SecTPB

You will be a true hero if you can get the latest DXTory!

Please for the love of everything!
Lots of people are looking for it, and the latest working version is over 5 months old and very outdated.. :(

http://dxtory.com/v2-history-en.html

Please, please, for your fans!

I've posted this comment on many other uploaders' uploads in the hopes of someone doing something, since I don't know where else to ask for anything like this :)"
