First of all, nice name! Second, you are absolutely correct.

Let me say the effort is appreciated on this torrent Meriados, but I think I'll be holding out until a scan comes (if at all, it is a fairly expensive book). Until then I will be drooling over my friend's when we're at our Local Game Store together. :D"
