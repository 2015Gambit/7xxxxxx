At that time, I will proceed to the SD version."
,psx_warrior,2012-10-15T06:41Z,"First time commenting here, so a BIG thank you.  You are the reason I've been able to keep up with this show until I can get my hd satellite going in my new home."
,fartboytpb,2012-10-15T18:32Z,Thanks man. You're awesome.
[T],burgundyranger,2012-10-16T14:41Z,"I HAVE to give you this caveat. Saban Brands just had Rangercrew -- one of the more popular Power Rangers message boards -- remove all links to encodes of episodes. I get mine from elsewhere but the possibility exists that the same thing could happen there as well.

If it does happen, my torrents are done."
[T],burgundyranger,2012-10-20T19:59Z,"FYI, Nickelodeon made a late schedule change on Thursday and removed ""Stroke of Fate"" from the schedule of Oct. 20.

As of right now, the Halloween-themed episode is still scheduled for Oct. 27. After that, who knows?"
,psx_warrior,2012-10-21T14:22Z,"That's weird.  They removed Stroke of Fate, but are still playing the Halloween episode.  I wonder how that's gonna work out."
,fartboytpb,2012-10-22T04:24Z,So that's why RangerBoard made the Multimedia section need 200 posts to view! They are afraid Saban will see it.
,Sheldon131,2012-10-27T04:46Z,"@fartboytpb, what happened?!"
,ibbb100,2012-10-28T10:23Z,Where is 15 episode?
