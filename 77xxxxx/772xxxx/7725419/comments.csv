,Metantei,2012-10-14T11:23Z,Can you upload episodes 132 and above for fairytail
,cmryan821,2012-10-15T04:46Z,Thank you for the great up. 
,vashterbation,2012-10-18T04:53Z,any chance you'll up this one in 720p?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-10-18T06:27Z,"animes are coming out so fast this month, gives me no time for 720p for this.
Since this is a good anime i went with the FUll Quality Audio and Video"
,xzxero,2012-10-18T08:04Z,"Daman4Iife just want to give you the thanks you deserve.
I respect the fact that your uploads are of superb quality.
It's nice to have the option to convert or compress these high quality files to fit everyone's needs!
In my case, I converted this 720p using handbrake.
Keep up the work thanks again bro"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-10-19T12:25Z,"I KNOW RIGHT Daman4Iife
THERES LIKE 
X MEN
C CONTROL AND MORE
ANIMES COMING THIS MONTH"
,vashterbation,2012-10-19T12:43Z,"@ xzxero
what could you reduce the overall file size too with handbrake?"
,cmryan821,2012-10-19T16:24Z,"Well, it really depends what settings you use, but a quick encode of the first episode shrunk(shrank?) it from 816mb to 243mb. I used cq22 and encoded the eng audio to 6ch aac @448kbps and left out the jap audio. I'm certain you can shrink it down even further if you feel the need. "
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-10-19T20:24Z,"As Cmryan said, if the files are to big for you, Re-encode them using Handbrake, But you will lose Quality on the video.

Setting appropriate for Monitor Size/Resolutioon

Monitors 24+/1080p leave it as it is.
monitors 22-23/1080  Leave it as  it is.
Monitors 19-21/720p resize to 720p using a  CRF of 20-23.

Monitors 15-18/ Guess these are SD monitors
You can use CRF of 24-26 for Mini Encodes which will look just as great on a SD monitor."
,bowgunnerkuroi,2012-10-20T01:21Z,"DAMNAN ,I was hoping you could help me.  I have an 11inch 1366x768 netbook, but i use hdmi out for obvious reasons.. Could you give me the pre-set info so i could re-encode these in 720p and lose the LEAST amount of quality as possible? video bit rate ,  audio if i need ect.   with all due respect, i cant handle your qualtiy. lol.  GREAT UPLOAD :)"
,bowgunnerkuroi,2012-10-20T01:33Z,Bitrate for 720p highest quality re-encode?
,strangelander,2012-10-20T19:46Z,"This is the uncensored and uncut one, correct?"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-10-20T23:46Z,Yes this is as uncensored as it will evet get.
,mooserocka,2012-10-21T00:01Z,awesome job daaman keep it up seriously DONT STOP. cant wait for c control certian magical index and persona 4 the animation. I did not like this one casue my player doesnt let me change the audio and jap is first on this one so i was stuck in jap. other then that LOVE your uploads
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-10-21T00:16Z,"mooserocka'

use VLC/MPC they all let you change the audio tracks"
,xzxero,2012-10-21T20:14Z,"@ vashterbation 
i compressed the first episode from its original 778.58 MB to 199 MB

In my opinion the quality it still amazing since it's original source were these high quality files here!

If i get enough requests I'll upload my converted version.

They are in MP4 format, audio is in english, and the subtitles are  in separate files so they are not hardcoded.

It totals to around 2.46 GB for the whole series.

Comment here if you would like a 720p version of this series.

It's the least I could to help Daman out!"
,mooserocka,2012-10-22T00:05Z,yea i did but i like to load them on to my ps3 and from there unless its the number 1 audio i cant change it. but thanks i did get vlc just my computer screen is so small i like watching on the 60 inch o well. Still daman is awesome every other thing has english first.
,cmryan821,2012-10-22T00:19Z,"Moose, not sure how you're getting the mkv files to your ps3(transcoding or what), but you can try remuxing them without the japanese audio. Mp4/MKV tools works fine but I'm sure there are other ways as well."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-10-22T02:34Z,"Options for Streaming Videos to the ps3/Xbox

1. Download Ps3 Mediaserver, Allows the xbox and ps3 to play Mkv files.
2. Use Mp4Box and Mkvtollnix to remove Stream and Audio then remux using Mp4box.
3. Re-encode files using HAndbrake M4V which works on the xbox and ps3."
,mooserocka,2012-10-23T03:42Z,I put them on the ps3 by clicking and dragging the files. Yea i dunno how to do any of that stuff since im computer illiterate. I like clicking and draging from one box to another. I use azures Vuse and it is the best program i ever used. 
,DiegoAAL,2012-10-24T00:02Z,"Great work with all these awesome animes. I just have a problem. I cant get this one to play on my laptop. I have a mac and am trying to play this on VLC. Im able to play other animes like King of Thorn, Towa No Quon, and Shiki. Do you have any suggestions? Please help"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-10-24T01:00Z,"Diego, Try updating VLC. Or download k-lite codecs."
,DiegoAAL,2012-10-24T04:35Z,There is no k-lite for mac but Perian is an equivalent. I've updated my perian and i'll try to watch it again. I'll update with my results. Thank you for ur input Daman 
,bigwhiteguy88,2012-10-25T14:40Z,Great stuff. Can you get the new eng dub naruto shippudden movie? Call will of fire I think.
,mooserocka,2012-10-26T22:49Z,LOL once again people keep wasting thier requests. Naruto in dub is all there is on torrent networks. Daman is the only one putting out the AMAZING anime there is so many others putting out naruto stuff I think he should stick to the new series not stuff that 100 others put out. All in all it comes down to what daman wants to do . His work is amazing.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-10-26T23:54Z,"the Naruto Dub was release about 2 days ago in blu ray, i should have it up soon.
480p=1GB
720p= with DTS/Flac Audio 2.5-3GB"
,ANIMELIFE,2012-11-01T01:31Z,"@mooserocka speak for your self (idiot)

,mooserocka,2012-11-01T22:05Z,anime whatever yea wow your so right. cant put one past you. WOw what a nerd. On a real note this anime is really good i like it. Daman keep up the work.

,mooserocka,2012-11-04T20:55Z,I just finished great anime. Dont like how it left off though there has to be MORE. This is not it i can tell. Ne one know when season 2 is being released?

,indi711,2012-11-11T10:13Z,Love this one. Even tho the main guys voice is a little irritating.
,JuniiFlow,2012-11-12T07:02Z,"This is wonderfull, but the dub audio does't work with MPC-HP"
,JuniiFlow,2012-11-12T09:16Z,"so i said fuck it to the Dub version, since i did't really like the MC voice. and now LOL 

THE JAPANASE AUDIO IS CENSORED. MEANING HE WONT SAY FUCK PUSSY or other stuff without a beep."
