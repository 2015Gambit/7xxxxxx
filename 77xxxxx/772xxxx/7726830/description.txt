Special Others is a Japanese band that blends improvised jazz with post-rock influences. Their lyrics, on non-instrumental songs, mix English and Japanese worlds, oftentimes extraordinarily exemplify: difficult to decipher. The members of the band met in high school and formed the group in 1995. They began performing in earnest in 2000, and their first major release, Indy-Ann, remained in the CRJ-tokyo charts for seven weeks.
