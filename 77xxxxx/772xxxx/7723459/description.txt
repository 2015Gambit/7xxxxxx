Notes:
One of my favorite recordings of the Devotional Tour. Also recorded on a non common recorder, which in my opinion rivaled DAT sound on such a small device. If anyone has information on the taper/mic used it would be greatly appreciated. The 2nd encore was not played on this date. Dave is struggling during this show. Sad to see, but musically and production wise I think this was the best songs the Mode put out live.
