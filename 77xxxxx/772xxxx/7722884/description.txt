the real book of real estate  robert kiyosaki

There are four reasons why I think a real book of real estate is important at
this time.
First, there will always be a real estate market. In a civilized world, a roof
over your head is as essential as food, clothing, energy, and water. Real estate
investors are essential to keeping this vital human need available at a reasonable
price. In countries where investing in real estate is limited or excessively controlled
by the government, such as it was in former Communist Bloc countries,
people suffer, and real estate deteriorates.
Second, there are many different ways a person can participate and prosper
with real estate. For most people, their only real estate investment is where they
live. Their home is their biggest investment. During the real estate boom from
2000 to 2007, many amateurs got involved with flipping housesΓÇöbuying low
and hoping to sell higher. As you know, many flippers flopped and lost everything.
In true investor vocabulary, flipping is known as speculating or trading.
Some people call it gambling. While flipping is one method of investing, there
are many, more sophisticated, less risky ways to do well with real estate. This
book is filled with the knowledge and experiences of real, real estate investorsΓÇö
real estate professionals who invest rather than flip, speculate, trade, or gamble.
