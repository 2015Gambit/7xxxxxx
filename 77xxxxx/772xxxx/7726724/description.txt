TotalFinder 1.4.2 + Crack.

Description : 

Tabbed Browsing
Add tabs on top of Finder. The same tabs as seen in Google Chrome.
Dual Mode
Display two Finder windows side-by-side in dual mode.
Folders on Top
Don't make me think. Folders should always go first in list view.
Show System Files
Show me all files on the disk. I'm not afraid to see the cruft.
Visor
Convenient system-wide Finder always one key-press away.
Cut & Paste
Use keyboard shortcuts to move files around. Faster than drag & drop.
