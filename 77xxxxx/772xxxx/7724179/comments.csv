,Abaris777,2012-10-14T18:41Z,"Yes, and it may seem a noob one lol
Are the graphics of the main releases/mods improved compared to the original ?"
,dontpKaniC,2012-10-14T20:04Z,"Well, the original game is the same as it was, so are the expansions, but, the mod ROMA SURRECTUM II, which is by FAR my favorite mod, has upgraded graphics, which make it look a lot like Medieval II Total War, the trees are far more realistic, the unit models are FAR more detailed and so on...
Also the Rome Total Realism VII mod, which includes a few sub mods, has upgraded graphics that look really sweet."
,Abaris777,2012-10-16T18:27Z,"Thanks bro, u rock!"
,dontpKaniC,2012-10-16T21:49Z,You're welcome!
,Ramil245,2012-10-19T21:39Z,"I am sorry to bother but i seem to be having trouble starting the game up, it says that i need to put in the right disk, i have tried 2 mounting programs and well i have to ask. i am sorry if it is an odd question. "
,dontpKaniC,2012-10-20T00:24Z,"You need to crack the game! :)

It depends on what you have installed:
If you installed Rome Total War ONLY, without expansions or updates, you need to mount CD-1, open it (go to my computer, right click on the Disk, and click Open) then navigate to ""Crack"" folder, copy the exe file and paste it in the main Rome Total War folder (example: C:Program FilesActivisionRome - Total War)

If you HAVE installed the Barbarian Invasion expansion ONLY, then in the folder called BI which you downloaded, there is a folder called ""crack"", navigate to it, copy the two exe files and paste them in you'r main RTW folder just like in the step above.

If you installed patch 1.6, there is a crack in the folder of the IMPERATOT II mod called ""IMPERATOR II ALL FILES"". In this folder you will find a rar file called ""dev-bi16.rar"". Extract the contents of that archive using WinRar or WinZip or 7zip (or any other archive extractor program) into the main RTW folder.

In all cases Copy and replace all files!

To install the Alexander expansion you need version 1.6, so install the 1.6 patch, install Alexander, crack the 1.6 patch the way i explained above, and crack Alexander by copying the exe from the folder called ""crack"" that is located in the ""rtwalexanderrtwaRome Total War Alexander"" folder that you have downloaded with this torrent.

Also, if for example you installed RTW and then Barbarian Invasion you don't need to crack RTW before installing BI. Just apply the correct crack after you install everything."
,dontpKaniC,2012-10-20T00:27Z,"Oh, and if you want to install any of the mods, they all should work fine if installed on RTW:BI 1.6."
,Ramil245,2012-10-20T18:00Z,"Thanks man, by the way thanks for the upload."
,dontpKaniC,2012-10-20T18:32Z,My pleasure.
,Kmiyc,2012-10-20T20:14Z,"Hey i tried installing the patch but it tells me i have to install 1.3 first i found and installed it from ""http://games.softpedia.com/get/Patch/Rome-Total-War-13-English-Patch.shtml"" but it still tells me the same thing. can u help me i have no idea what am doing wrong.... And thanks for the game i love it"
,dontpKaniC,2012-10-20T21:15Z,"You probably didn't install Barbarian Invasion expansion, because, as far as I know, when you install Barbarian Invasion over Rome Total War, it patches RTW to 1.4. After that you need to install patch 1.6.

It is possible that you do need to patch RTW to 1.3 first before you patch it to 1.6 IF you didn't install Barbarian Invasion. The last time I installed RTW without BI was so long ago that I don't remember what you need to do... So my suggestion is, simply install a clean install of RTW and then install BI and THEN patch to 1.6! It will work for sure!

Besides, there is no reason not to install BI! The game will have two different exe's so that you can play BI or the original RTW whenever you want!

And if you DID install BI and this error shows up, try re-installing the game."
,Kmiyc,2012-10-21T18:07Z,I figured it out!!! I know only a noob might do it but i was putting the cracks in before installing the patch that's way it wouldn't work.. Thanks again dontpKaniC the game's great :)
,dontpKaniC,2012-10-21T19:44Z,Glad it worked out!
,call14,2012-10-22T11:55Z,Thank you for this great torrent i got a question i have just instaled and cracked rome total war if i instal barbarian invasion i need to crack it to
,dontpKaniC,2012-10-22T17:16Z,"Yes, but this time with the crack that is in the BI folder."
,Gan45,2012-10-22T22:41Z,"Hello, for some reason i keep on getting this pop up when ever i try to run the game ""mss32.dll is missing from your computer"", well i can see that mss32 is in the folder, so i click on it and drag it down to the exe and it says, ""The procedure entry point _AIL_init_3D_sample_handle@12 could not be located in the dynamic link library mss32.dll. 
Any tips on how to solve this problem?"
,dontpKaniC,2012-10-22T23:24Z,"Not really, sorry... You could try reinstalling the game, or google mss32.dll, download it, and try to replace the one in the folder."
,dontpKaniC,2012-10-22T23:26Z,"Also, try running as administrator (if you have Vista or Win 7) or in compatibility mode."
,Zaiga,2012-10-23T14:57Z,"Hey, this is my first time downloading torrents and I'm slightly stuck at what to do. I've downloaded the torrent and I have all the files. But I don't know how to install the original Rome Total War, I have the file folders ""CD1, CD2 and CD3"" but I don't know how to install the game from these files. I'd appreciate the help you can give! Thanks"
,dontpKaniC,2012-10-23T18:51Z,"Download a program called Daemon Tools for free (just google it), and mount those files (in the folders CD1, Cd2, CD3...) onto a virtual drive.
This program creates a virtual DVD-ROM and the files that you downloaded with this torrent act like virtual disks."
,Zaiga,2012-10-23T22:19Z,"Thanks a lot, will do! Appreciate it"
,ApplSucks,2012-10-26T05:35Z,"First thank you this game is amazing. Second I actually own it twice already but the CD version i have doesn't read the CD anymore and the steam version crashes once i hit a certain year(it's more complicated than that but the bug sucks and there's no fix's.) When i try to install alexander it installs it to my steam version, also if i try to install the patch it also goes to my steam version. Does anyone know a better way of doing this? If not im just going to uninstall the steam rome and install this one which come to think of it ill just do tomorrow since the steam one is broke i hope this one works. But still if you have any advice that would be awesome. Thanks."
,dontpKaniC,2012-10-26T10:51Z,"No, sorry. The setup of the patch and of the expansions, automatically finds Rome Total War and installs to that directory, and you can't change that... You could probably do some thing in the registry, but I don't know much about it and can't help you, sorry."
,ApplSucks,2012-10-26T19:47Z,no worries thanks
,ApplSucks,2012-10-29T00:17Z,"Hi again, I'v been trying to install darthmod on this. Has anyone had any luck with it? The first install it gave me something about not being on the list error whenever I would choose a battle or campaign. So i uninstalled it a few times same thing. On my latest re-install it crashes the second i click on rome. Screen turns black and exits. I have never moded a total war game before and followed the instruction for installing darthmod to the T. Thanks."
,TheStriker100,2012-10-29T00:46Z,"Forget Darthmod, use Roma Surrectum II, it is by far the most superior mod for this game."
,ApplSucks,2012-10-29T02:47Z,"I was planning on trying that one to. 

Also when I go into rome before i try to mod the version is 1.3 even after i update."
,srki997,2012-10-31T18:37Z,I can't update 1.6!! HELP
,bobos926,2012-11-02T14:46Z,hey man when i download realism mod IIV and install it and run it he asks me to patch the game into version 1.6 even so i did what in the instructions by installing rome total war and bi and the 1.6 patch so what is the problem can you help me note the mode that i have downloaded was the last update of the realism mod IIV
,lollakas,2012-11-03T08:54Z,Someone please seed!!! I'm only downloading from 2 peers!!
