It seems the job of downloading my entire collection of Love for Lydia videos along 

with associated subtitles in English turns out to be too tedious and time-consuming 

for many people. Here is a shortcut, but it may require a little extra learning for

people who do not have my video files. Perhaps my subtitles do exactly fit the other 

video-only download available. I hopt so. If these subtitles do not fit those videos

you have try using Subtitle Workshop to adjust them. That's what I use. Good luck.
