[T],T.F.K,2012-10-14T13:02Z,Nice up friend +1 :)
,Mike_Bottigheimer,2012-10-14T13:12Z,"it doesnt work, do not download."
,baelferuz,2012-10-14T14:25Z,is this the one with the mechromancer?
,darkgamerX,2012-10-14T14:42Z,does this one finally work with windows 8?
,Kastelator,2012-10-14T14:53Z,"Downloading now with my girlfriend, we'll both try this with hamachi and say if it works :)

Thanks for the upload!"
,Sn0bb,2012-10-14T14:56Z,"Works fine for me. Haven't tried LAN yet but I presume that it works too.
Great share +1"

,In_Da_Club,2012-10-14T16:19Z,"it does work, thanks."
,Crimsondrake1138,2012-10-14T16:24Z,"There is a slight problem with it... it worked on the initial run but when I logged out and started again it said that my DLC was corrupt and it would not load any of the DLC, and yes, my firewall is blocking it and I've tried to uninstall and reinstall but it does not want to work.

Thanks for the Upload +1

I just hope someone can figure out how to fix the problem or if there's a workaround for it."
,baelferuz,2012-10-14T17:13Z,thanks it works :D
,Crimsondrake1138,2012-10-14T17:15Z,"Ok found out my problem... So if you use this patch what ever you do, 

DO NOT MOD YOUR WillowDLC.ini file.

So with this patch you can't give yourself max GoldenKeys by modding the:

[GoldenKeys]
+SourceId=254
+NumKeys=1

Otherwise it triggers something to make this DLC invalid.

If that happens and you modded the WillowDLC file write it back to default and back up your save file:
""D:\DocumentsMy GamesBorderlands 2WillowGameSaveData76561198773229528""
Just save that folder with your save files, movie it some place else and then delete the whole Borderlands 2 folder from ""documentsMy Games""

Restart Borderlands 2 so that it makes a new folder, and then copy back your save files and the DLC should work again, but no more giving yourself keys... unless someone has figured out how to do that with this patch w/out triggering that ""event"""

"
,OmniNegro,2012-10-14T20:29Z,"Some people have missed a post I made on the other torrent of this before Skidrow made the same basic stuff with their own crack. So I will repeat it here.

Install the Skidrow 1.0 version of the game with NO UPDATES. Backup your WillowDLC.ini and use the 255 golden key cheat you all know of. Start the game and make a character. Get only far enough to save the character. (Be sure to press i to pull up your inventory for the Golden Key tooltip before you save.) Exit the game and apply this patch. (You do not need the other patches. Only the latest is required.)

Now edit the WillowDLC.ini golden key cheat back to default so it is *NOT* a cheat anymore.

Start the game and make your new character. You golden keys remain. But you are not cheating now.

You are all welcomed. :)"
,OmniNegro,2012-10-14T20:31Z,"@Green.Lantern
There is no point in that. You have everything leveled to *YOU* in the second playthrough, so it would not be harder at all."

Go back to windows 7 if you want to play games yoy tit."

can anyone confirm of same issues?"

,NioLight,2012-10-15T16:54Z,worked 100% for me no problems at all 
,Stefanovics,2012-10-15T17:44Z,"now it works but i cant see the
Creature Slaughter Dome DLC
Moxxi's Rocket Launcher DLC
but if it doesn't start it means that the previous update fucked up the registry, so if you reinstall it it wont start anymore.
so first download this:

than you can install this, and it works"
,Desric,2012-10-15T18:19Z,"Works 100% with no problems. Everyone who says its not working.....99% of the time its a user error and not on the game/crack side. Download orginal game, install, crack, download this, install, crack. Done"

,SteaminWillieBeamen,2012-10-16T18:51Z,"@baelferuz You don't need to use a third-party program to play LAN. I'm able to play LAN using the games built in LAN feature. It's easy everyone switches to LAN in network options, someone starts a game, then go to Find Games to join their game."

,fluster84,2012-10-17T15:36Z,"@kevoo_11

There are 2 ways to hack the number of GOLDEN KEYS,

1. Edit the WillowDLC.ini file in \DLCPOPremierClubLic and change the number of keys to 255

** Make sure you do this BEFORE you install any update(s) **

2. easier way is to simply go to gamecopyworld.com and download the +26 trainer by Fling (for v1.1.1) -> now run trainer and press F11 ingame to get 99 keys.. it will give you 99 keys and also freeze the number so effectively you get infinite keys as long as trainer is running"

,prof.a,2012-10-30T12:36Z,"For those with the AMD FX-Series CPUs, you need to update your BIOS to the latest version in order to play this.
Otherwise the game just crashed at startup and causes BSOD.
Borderlands 2 is not the only game affected by this also. I also had problems with Deus-X and Crysis.
It's due to the mobos not being factory set to handle the FX series."
