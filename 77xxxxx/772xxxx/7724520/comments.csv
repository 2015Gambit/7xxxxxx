,crabgrass08,2012-10-14T00:35Z,"a bit of a disappointment that they used the digital remix with the Barrow/Wackerman bass/drum overdubs.  I understand that they didn't want to issue the original while the same thing, as ""Greasey Love Songs"", is still in print... but I'd have thought the idea of having all the original analog mixes done properly would have outweighed that.  Oh well, thanks again cyber... feel absolutely free to keep 'em coming."
