Splash Pro freezes and crashes

,JoePlum,2012-10-16T00:34Z,"This rump ranger fucked up another torrent. Just like always.

When I have the time, I will go to your mother's house, go down to the basement, drag you out of your hiding place under the bed and bitch slap you."
[T],SCSA420,2012-10-16T07:05Z,"You know what gets me? People who complain when they are getting a $50 HD pay per view for FREE................. and Also people who complain that the video and audio doesn't play right. It sure is funny how the video and audio always plays fine here on my equipment which is 3 PC's, 2 BluRay players, Playstation 3, and a Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone. If you're having problems playing the files maybe you don't have a good enough or fast enough PC to playback the HD files or your equipment is not good enough. Otherwise I don't know what to tell you other then to download and install Klite codec pack and properly configure it for mp4 and mkv playback."
,wrestlingnut2012,2012-10-16T07:21Z,this is my 1st time downloading a torrent from you as i have been looking everywhere for this. you are the man. please upload every monthly wwe and tna ppv from now on as you will be my #1 source for them :) the files in this torrent work great. your work is appreciated
,boyznacne,2012-10-16T13:02Z,"It's unwatchable it completely locked up window media player, vlc player and k-lite's media player classic just kept closing like the file was corrupted or something.

And I think an  intel i7 3960x, GTX 690 Dual GPU, 20 GB RAM will play any HD video file with no problems."
[T],SCSA420,2012-10-16T18:27Z,"It sure is funny how the video and audio always plays fine here on my equipment which is 3 PC's, 2 BluRay players, Playstation 3, Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone and a 55 inch LG 3D LED 240 Hz SmartTv.   Oh and it plays fine with  VLC,  media player classic, power dvd,  Windows media player, etc. I think you should pay TNA $50 to watch it live like I did. But your cheap ass is too cheap to pay for it unlike me who paid $50 just so I could give it away for free                                                                                                                                                                                                 here to wrestling fans who appreciate my time and effort I put in each week. If you can do a better job then I do then do it otherwise STFU.          "
,boyznacne,2012-10-16T19:11Z,"Just give it up. Admit that you fucked up with this release. You are now trying to cover it up and pretend everything works but in reality it doesn't.

Numerous people on other websites already complained about your release being completely unwatchable.

Also, nobody gives a rusty fuck about what equipment you own so you can quit boasting about your 3D LED TV and Samsung SGS3, etc.

And if this release wasn't complete crap then I wouldn't be complaining here.

I'll stick with NWCHD's release because those guys at least now what the hell they are doing unlike you. "
[T],SCSA420,2012-10-16T19:54Z,boyznacne Just go ahead and ADMIT that you are a fucking moron because I have NO reason to cover up anything and its not my fault if you cannot play the files. I just got done watching it on my 2 BluRay players from a USB 3.0 32 GB flash drive and it plays PERFECTLY. Oh and my LG 3D LED SmartTv plays the files from the USB 3.0 flash drive as well. Also I think you're full of shit and just talking shit cause that's all you can do you whiney bitch.
,pottermouth,2012-10-16T23:52Z,"i'm with SCSA420 on this one!

my laptop,my desktop,my dvd player(burned to disc) and my tv via 32gb usb drive all play perfect so the boy with the acne i'm afraid the problems your suffering seem to be with you dude!
"
,regulater,2012-10-19T22:12Z,"I had problems with the main event, there is a segment during the match that it seemed to skipped.  Otherwise, everything played great, and GREAT PPV.  If you aren't turned off by inferior production and budget, TNA is definitely the better product right now. Thanks"
