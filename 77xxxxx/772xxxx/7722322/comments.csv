Requesting a good cracker for DXTory!

The only working version of DXtory is 114, and there's already a 120! 

It makes me sad that people don't realize DXTory is far superior than Fraps, and yet, fraps is cracked the day after release.

tl;dr - We would all love you if you could find a working copy for dxtory 2.0.120"
