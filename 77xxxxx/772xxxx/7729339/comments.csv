,edmtunes,2012-10-16T10:21Z,"Gaz, love this show!
My medicine until Geordie Shore starts again!
Didn't MIC start last night?
Love your uploads of TOWIE :)"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-10-16T10:57Z,"MIC did start last night, but, I am not able to do a webrip of it as Channel 4 have gone to a new system to prevent people doing that. I am still on the look out for it, but I might not get it up in the next few hours :( It might take a day or so :( :("
,edmtunes,2012-10-16T12:47Z,"no worries, ill be waiting :)
do you watch Geordie Shore?
you from Australia right?"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-10-16T13:40Z,"Yep, I am from Australia. This will shock a few people, but, I don't really watch any of the shows I upload! My favourites are Survivor and Curb Your Enthusiasm and South Park. I started uploading these shows because a friend of mine asked if I could get her TOWIE and MIC. I couldn't find it on Pirate Bay, so when I did elsewhere, I uploaded it here. People started to thank me and I wanted to continue making them happy! The cat is out of the bag!! :)"
,bexwey,2012-10-16T20:31Z,"Awww Gary, you are an Angel, we all love you!!!  Waiting patiently for MIC xxxxx"
