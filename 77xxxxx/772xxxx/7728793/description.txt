Ladies and gents, allow me to introduce to you the latest member of the blocSonic family, Formula. A producer extraordinaire hailing from London. This here is his premiere solo release and our second original. If youΓÇÖve been following our netBloc series for a while, youΓÇÖve most-likely heard ΓÇ£Is It Too Late For Us All?ΓÇ¥ from the collaborative project that he was part of (along with BostonΓÇÖs own Tha Silent Partner), MUTE. It was featured on ΓÇ£netBloc Vol. 15: this album wonΓÇÖt eat your gas moneyΓÇ¥. Welcome him back with what IΓÇÖm quite confident youΓÇÖll think is one fantastic release. Hip-Hop on another plainΓÇª from another perspectiveΓÇª but real boom bap hip-hop none-the-less. From the introduction ΓÇ£Ebony ShardsΓÇ¥ΓÇª to ΓÇ£X ManΓÇ¥, thereΓÇÖs not a boring or weak moment to be found.

To me ΓÇ£The Overcast ProjectΓÇ¥ feels like the perfect follow-up to Just Plain AntΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Dig DeepΓÇ¥. Formula seems to share a similar desire to expand the definition of ΓÇ£hip-hopΓÇ¥. With Formula at itΓÇÖs core and a talented group of musicians and emcees, Overcast gels into a superbly cohesive unit (much like AntΓÇÖs release before it). There IS a ΓÇ£Formula soundΓÇ¥ and each of the guest musicians and emcees lend their distinctive touches in such a way as to make the unit stronger.

Sit back and get ready for the journeyΓÇª the sky may be overcast, but no rain is in the forecastΓÇª so enjoy the journey!

Thanks to Formula for allowing blocSonic to handle the release of this gem!

As always, thanks to you for visiting blocSonic and listening to our releasesΓÇª rememberΓÇª share this with friends, enemies, parents, siblings, politicians, zombies and aliensΓÇª ohΓÇª and the rain godsΓÇª

Peace
