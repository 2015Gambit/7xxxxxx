Here is my collection of various Dungeons and Dragons tabletop RPG gameplay videos and podcasts I have amassed over the last few months. All of the videos and most of the podcasts feature Wizards of the Coast Senior Producer Chris Perkins as Dungeon Master using 4e or Next rules. This compilation is by no means complete, just a collection of games that I found compelling. I am always looking for more videos of this variety, especially from other editions and game systems, so if you know of any, please let me know in the comments.

All Videos ripped from youtube using keepvid and joined/converted using Freemake. I used the highest resolution available on youtube and converted to mp4. Most of the videos came in parts and had to be joined. Please forgive me for being too lazy to remove the bumpers and for the varied video resolutions. Audio Podcasts and related images downloaded directly from Wizards of the Coast (http://www.wizards.com/dnd/podcasts.aspx).
