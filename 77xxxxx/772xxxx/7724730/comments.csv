[T],_SnakEye,2012-10-14T01:27Z,how come? you not into Austria flying?
,virtualanarchy,2012-10-14T02:02Z,More of a US kinda guy :) 
,pumpernickel,2012-10-14T11:20Z,"The SP1 does not accept the serial number.

What is the ""Enable Button"" for?"
,eg.mo3taz,2012-10-14T16:10Z,"""next' not active in setup .. help!"
,2asterix,2012-10-14T16:41Z,Run all as ADMIN... :)
,pumpernickel,2012-10-14T17:57Z,"Run as admin, started also the enablebutton.exe (after googling ;-). The ""next"" button now works and the programme says it installed correctly. Unfortunately not a singe file is added or changed to the existing ones. The log-file also confirms that no files have been copied.
So SP1 with enablebutton.exe certainly does not work, at least not for me.

Any hints?"
[T],_SnakEye,2012-10-14T21:25Z,"yeah, I had noticed the same. it could be the Install
already with SP1 in it.
did it designate the reason why it skipped the files?"
,Brrr1955,2012-10-14T22:03Z,"I have Austria Professional X v1.0 installed few years ago. Today, I installed only SP1 and there are no change since the previous version (v1.0).    "
[T],_SnakEye,2012-10-15T01:18Z,it appears the SP1 is not working.
,pumpernickel,2012-10-15T08:14Z,"No, the reason is not given. Error 76 I ignore since the installer does not find the scenery.cfg and one has to enter the data by hand.

I'd like to pay for this kind of software, imo they deserve it more than douches like EA or Activision... but unfortunately i can not afford it for now.
So ye, thanks man! I love your uploads!"
