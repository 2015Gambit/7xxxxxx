This was a release that I hoped to have ready in time for the holidays and was to be a holiday gift. Things didnΓÇÖt fall into place as quickly as I had originally hoped, so here you have it now, a couple months late. What youΓÇÖll find with this one is a ΓÇ£conceptΓÇ¥ album. At least a concept in as much as a compilation can be a concept. ThereΓÇÖs an overlying theme... that of the Moon. ThereΓÇÖs a loosely tied narrative that is held together through the use of public domain texts, video and Creative Commons licensed music. ThereΓÇÖs also a purpose... to explore the need for a Public Domain and the importance of Creative Commons licensing. We also have a guest artist providing the terrific illustrations for this release. My good friend Rob Pitt (twenty3x.com), who I attended Maine College of Art with, has been gracious enough to donate his time and talent. He provided some wonderful illustrations that captured exactly what I was visually shooting for with the release. He also agreed to license his illustrations under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share alike license which allows for derivative works. YouΓÇÖll find these source illustrations in a separate zip file on the release page. Be sure to read the included text file specific license information. Also check the first blocSonic netBloc video for FortyoneΓÇÖs They're on the Moon Right Now.
