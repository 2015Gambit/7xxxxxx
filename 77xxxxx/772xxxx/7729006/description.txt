SUMMARY......: See how snow and ice can also cripple cities and regions in the blink 
			   of an eye. How can simple variations in the structure of ice crystals 
			   turn fresh snow fit for a ski run in to deadly ammunition for an 
			   avalanche? Take a look into survivor accounts of storms, like the 
			   story of Daryl Jane, who never realized getting his SUV stuck in the 
			   snow would nearly cost him his life as he endured a blizzard for nearly 
			   two weeks with little food and water before rescuers find his vehicle.
