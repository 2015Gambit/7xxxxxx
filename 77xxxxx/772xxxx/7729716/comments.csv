,walkingdead9,2012-10-15T19:27Z,this is great! upload more complete series please and thanks = )
,SplhcbPrime,2012-10-15T23:53Z,"@ proteus11:  Warren Ellis recently updated the status on newuniversal, stating, ""Had a conversation with David Bogart at Marvel about the future of the NEWUNIVERSAL: STORMFRONT project there that got stalled when my computer and backups were destroyed.  Should be sorted in a few months."""
,SplhcbPrime,2012-10-16T01:52Z,"@ proteus11:  after more research, i find that leonardtspock has uploaded ellis' stormfront (ie:  v1 37 and on) here:  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7553249/StormWatch_(Complete_Warren_Ellis_StormWatch)"
,Proteus11,2012-10-16T08:34Z,"Thanks for the clarification AND the news, SplhcbPrime; I had no idea that NU:SF would actually see a chance of resurrection! ItÂ´d be good to be able to complete the TPB collection."
,jacobthezombie,2012-10-19T02:38Z,does shockfront only have two issues released? what happened to the others?
,SplhcbPrime,2012-10-20T03:53Z,"@ jacobthezombie:  In 2009, Warren Ellis lost his story files in a computer accident; he subsequently announced that the [newuniversal] project is ""basically dead""."
