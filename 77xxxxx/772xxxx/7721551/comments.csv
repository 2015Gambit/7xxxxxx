,Chronomical,2012-10-13T22:44Z,"Yup. No Superman or Action is included, for it's simply not in my collection because i'm not really a superman fan.. Although if requested I can gather and compile the issues in a torrent."
,mrudgiantgodofhellfire,2012-10-13T23:53Z,Understood and many thx for the upload. You Rock
,Doc_T,2012-10-14T02:11Z,This is an EXCELLENT upload.  Thank you so much...
,Dickwing,2012-10-18T01:47Z,"Wow. This is great. I'm current on pretty much all these titles, but, I just had to commend you for this. I hear people rave about Animal Man and Swamp Thing. Should I give them a shot??"
,Chronomical,2012-10-18T03:30Z,"If you're an advocate of comics I would for sure recommend at least looking into them. In my personal opinion Animal Man is nothing short of epic, and is one of my personal favorites out of the New 52. Swamp Man is also enjoyable and hold it's place against some of the more well known titles. Check them out, you should enjoy them."
,avih,2012-10-20T23:56Z,"I get no superman, but why no catwoman or batwoman or batwing (or whatever) ?  I am not the biggest fan of those titles but there are crossovers sometimes!"
,bobbo_nut,2012-10-30T06:54Z,"Seriously? No Wonder Woman (or Demon Knights)? You are REALLY missing out, buddy"
