,ScarletteSpider,2012-10-13T22:05Z,"ty lonefunman, u are the only one that includes the overtime online segments with the show and I deeply appreciate that u do. the quality is always top notch too. And this week that reprehensible woman ann coulter sat in on overtime and i want to see just how deep her delusions with replucian lies because the RNC said ""our campaign won't be run by fact checkers"""

,journey1956,2012-10-14T07:53Z,"Yep. This overtime runs 14:16 the longest internet version I've seen yet and this one is pumped up with intensity. It was better than the regular one hour show, I thought."
