,zyron666,2012-10-15T04:26Z,"oh come on, everyone is at 99,9 %"
,zyron666,2012-10-15T04:31Z,"this is so frustrating, come on!
still at 99,9%"
,superbass1919,2012-10-15T06:23Z,I feel like we've been scammed. Even if it's 99.9% I think it would still play on VLC but this time it doesn't. Bad uploader. Didn't even check with our comments.
,superbass1919,2012-10-15T06:25Z,"""Seed back for speed"".... I'm definitely not seeding back after this. "
,zyron666,2012-10-15T06:52Z,"download from verovenlo
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7727637/The.X.Factor.Uk.S09E15.VeroVenlo

he never disappoints, only scenebalance has better quality, but this upload from verovenlo quality is totally fine. and also he uploads the xtra factor
cheers"
,superbass1919,2012-10-15T07:37Z,I just can't believe that scene balance let us down. Yeah. I may have to download from vero venlo from now on. Problem is it isnt the same quality.
,SheffGraph,2012-10-15T08:38Z,"Just to confirm what everyone else has said. Stuck on 99% since yesterday evening, now abandoned and went with VeroVenlo instead. I wouldn't waste your time with this one..."
,superbass1919,2012-10-15T13:45Z,I agree with SheffGraph. The uploader didn't even bother to check if there were any problems. 
,calvoce,2012-10-15T13:46Z,"Stuck at 99% like everyone else, why would you upload a file when you're not actually willing to share? Funny joke ""scenebalance"", I'll never trust you again."
,calvoce,2012-10-15T14:00Z,"So now you're deleting negative comments?

This specific upload is basically spam, don't bother trying to get it guys."
