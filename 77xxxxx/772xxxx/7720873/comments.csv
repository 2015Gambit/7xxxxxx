,ericthehammer,2012-10-14T22:55Z,This game hasn't come out yet. It comes out on 10/16. Be careful playing this game before hand.

,dunit80,2012-10-17T06:15Z,"This game is absolutely terrible. I made it probably halfway thru the 1st mission and turned it off. Terrible gameplay, terrible graphics. Dont even bother with this game."
,droid05,2012-10-17T07:19Z,"ok so i finally burned it using truncate method, on my memorex dvd+r dl disks using clone cd burned at 8x(i know seems kinda high speed, but trust me with these disks and clone cd never had a bad burn yet and works flawlessly). This game isnt that bad, much better than the goldeneye reloaded game. ive been playing for afew hours now with no issues or the dvd drive making weird noises like it does on some games. thanks again noobish ur the best man. keep up the good work."
,Smallz94,2012-10-19T01:56Z,"Agree that this game is pretty terrible.. @dunit80

Hopefully the multiplayer online is fun :)"
,golaniexpress,2012-10-19T18:05Z,nismo thanks for the information
,Maltor2378,2012-10-20T05:05Z,Does anyone know where I can get Superman Returns for NTSC. That game is almost impossible to find. 
,Faisalish,2012-10-20T08:58Z,"I thought this was a movie, never mind. "
,Faisalish,2012-10-20T09:01Z,"I got the email from SONY suggesting  I should buy this, I saw a picture of  the hottie in the massage, so I'm here to download it but sadly it is a game. D:

In the meantime,
There is no verified rip of Xex CRC 8A0913CD in the online database
 Failed to find a verified ini file for this Xex
 AutoFix Failed, Stealth is still unverified"
,Smallz94,2012-10-22T04:06Z,"@abdul86

abgx360 still didnt verify it stupid"
,Powerslave0,2012-10-27T22:28Z,"If you want to play the game before release day, you must set your console's DATE to the day of, or after the release of the game to keep your achievements, and to nod have your profile possibly banned.   IF you do this, you cannot take your profile on-line till the date you set it to.  

With playing any game before release day, you risk a profile ban till 9999.  Microsoft is banning profiles for playing Halo 4 early."
,FireKnight70,2012-11-04T06:31Z,"ABOUT THE GAME: This game totally sucks!  Activision should sell the rights back to EA Games.  The story is ridiculous, blending all James Bonds together, also taking the stories from the movies and totally butchering them...you actually play the game thinking...""Uhmmm...that's not how the story goes..."" Even the controls in the game are messed up...hard to read instructions while playing and sometimes they only show you once even if you restart the game.  Graphics are also like from 1995...with no real development (I.E. chasing a car part of the video game and when you hit the side of the mountain the car flips over 6 times and not in a good way)...seems like they rushed this game out because of SKYFALL coming out...I'm a die-hard bond fan and this game was such a waste...I feel bad for anyone who actually buys it.  No bad intentions to the uploader...I think it's cool you did this for everyone, just the game itself is not worth the disc you burn it on.  Hope this review helps :-/"
,DaProblem,2012-11-04T16:19Z,what program should i use 2 download gms vuze won't do it???
