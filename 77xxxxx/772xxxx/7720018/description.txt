Release Date: July 3, 2012 | Series: Renegade Angels Novel
Elijah Reynolds is the most dominant of lycans, a rare Alpha whose skill on the hunt is surpassed only by his primal sexuality. Vashti is the second most powerful vampire in the world, a lethal beauty with a path of devastation in her wake. They are enemies consumed with a fierce desire. But as war looms, each must decide where their loyalty lies--with their own kind or with the enemy lover they can no longer live without.
