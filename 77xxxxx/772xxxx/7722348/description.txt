ItΓÇÖs been a few weeks that IΓÇÖve been sitting on this, waiting for the perfect time to drop it on youΓÇª well here it is, the latest hotness by Tha Silent Partner, ΓÇ£SIX ONNA 7ΓÇ¥. A perfect example of all thatΓÇÖs great about independently released musicΓÇª with SO7 TSP challenges exactly what it means to be a 7" aka 45 aka fortyFive. Six brief gems clocking in at under 12 minutes altogetherΓÇª or just under 6 minutes per ΓÇ£sideΓÇ¥. Brief, though they are, donΓÇÖt sleep on them, theyΓÇÖre THAT STUFF!

RememberΓÇª everything we release is cool to share! Always keep the music movingΓÇª share itΓÇª blog itΓÇª podcast it! If youΓÇÖre in radioΓÇª support independent music and broadcast it!
