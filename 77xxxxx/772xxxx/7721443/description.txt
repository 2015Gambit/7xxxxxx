SweetFX:

SweetFX Shader Suite (or just SweetFX) is a mod built on the InjectSMAA shader injector, that allows you to apply a suite of 

post processing shader effects to your games.

You can add SMAA anti-aliasing , sharpening and tweak the color, gamma , exposure and more.
It's meant to allow you to improve the look of your games and change the look and mood of it to your liking.
If you use SMAA antialiasing instead of MSAA or an even more expensive antialaliasing technique you can also make the game 

run faster (than with MSAA)

It can currently add:

* SMAA (anti-aliases the image using the SMAA technique )
* LumaSharpen (Sharpens the image, making details easier to see)
* Bloom (Makes strong lights bleed their light into their surroundings)
* HDR (mimics an HDR look)
* Technicolor (Makes the image look like it was processed using a three-strip Technicolor process )
* Tonemap (Light and color adjustments)
* Vibrance (Intelligently saturates (or desaturates if you use negative values) the pixels depending on their original 

saturation)
* Sepia (Sepia tones the image )
* Vignette (Adds a vignette that darkens the borders to the image )
* Dither (Dithers the image making it look like it was displayed on a monitor with more colors than actually present )

It works with all 32bit DirectX 9 , 10 and 11 games.
It does NOT work with 64bit game executables - use the 32bit version of your game if it gives you a choice between 32 and 

64bit.
It works with all graphics cards as long as they support at least shader model 3.
