,josh1960,2012-10-14T22:33Z,"If it's like what is reported on Ars Technica, a force close is what happens in the presence of a rooted phone/tablet.  The trick is to rename the SuperUser folder apparently.  Here's the link:  http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/10/square-enix-chaos-rings-port-wont-work-on-your-rooted-android/"

,Darksteel165,2012-11-04T08:35Z,Crashes on touch with non-rooted s3. It does pass the data check. It checks 2000 files the first run after it crashes it checks 250 or so... weird 
,KillaKhronic,2012-11-04T20:35Z,"BONE I know you don't have time to get new versions of old apps, when your adding new apps all the time, but I would really appreciate it if you could upload the new version of this apk, to my knowledge it adds compatibility to many more devices including my Droid RAZR and removes the root blocker (which isn't as important as there clearly is a simple workaround). 

Regardless of whether or not you can, I really appreciate your work.  "
