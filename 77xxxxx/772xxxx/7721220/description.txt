Audio was demuxed from DVD in it's native 448 kbs AC3 format.  Using Audacity, the beginning was trimmed the match the sync of the blu-ray audio and then the end was trimmed to exactly match the blu-ray audio length.  The result was then exported as AC3 448kbs.  Quality should be 100% identical to the DVD's AC3 448kbs stream.

There was no need in my eye to include the Japanese audio.  It's an Anime that has native English speakers for their parts and then just muxed into the film just like the Japanese speakers were.  It was not dubbed.

I would rather hear Christian Bale and Billy Crystal in their roles then the Japanese actors I've never heard about.  Anyway, my two cents and my preference.  I made this for myself to enjoy.  If there are others out there, that also enjoy it the same way, then I present this to you.
