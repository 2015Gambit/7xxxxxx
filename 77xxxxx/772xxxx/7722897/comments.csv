,Hober_Mallow,2012-10-13T17:30Z,"Thank you, Super fast download too!.. ;~)"
,zygarch,2012-10-13T17:32Z,Best and smartest political commentary anywhere! Thanks.
,journey1956,2012-10-13T20:19Z,"I hope someone has the overtime part of this episode because it lasted almost 15 minutes long and it was better than the 1 hour show and the ""New Rules"" was not very funny. Bad joke writing is to blame here."
,metalkiwi,2012-10-20T13:58Z,"Any idea how far away this week's episode will be? Real Time with Bill Maher has to be one of the most repeatedly delayed torrents  I've ever come across. I'm calling you slack VTV, as you probably have to get it off someone else, but I get the feeling we'll be waiting an extra 1-2 days for this one like we did with another episode, about 4-5 episodes back."
,metalkiwi,2012-10-20T14:00Z,"SHIT I meant to say I'm NOT calling you slack VTV, sorry!!

TPB really should allow for editing our own comments within a 5 min window, either that or I should re-check my comment before hitting submit..... :"
,metalkiwi,2012-10-20T14:02Z,"Dammit I meant to say I'm NOT calling you slack VTV, sorry I should've re-checked my comment before hitting submit. Still though, it would be cool if TPB had an edit function if your comment is less than 5 mins old or something...."
,eeuropean2000,2012-10-20T14:21Z,"Likewise hoping for last night's episode to appear soon!  Many, many assholes post fake versions on torrents."
