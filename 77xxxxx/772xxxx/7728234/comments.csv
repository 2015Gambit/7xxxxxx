Very very good encode and uploaded retarded fast. Kudos to VTV and ettv for getting these up so quickly.

We really appreciate it and I'll be seeding to at least a 5:1 ratio. Probably 10:1.

When is the next one? (sing)

It takes 2 days to Fox show the episode here, TPB is faster! LOL!

V: 10
E: 10!
Thanks!"
