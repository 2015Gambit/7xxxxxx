Singers Sing Universal Songs Across Rivers Of Divine Divide
Open Your Eye And You Shall See A Glorious End Time
Spheres Of Platinum Descend To Elevate Souls Of Old
In The Book Of Life It Is Written, Names To Many To Mention
On This Plane, He Must Endureâ&#x20AC;Ś Must Endure To See The Boats Of Old

Timelines Define, Emancipating, Never Caring For The Devils Lifeline
In Golden Solar Systems Rests The Hybrid Race
Destined To Complete A Story Oh So Suppressed

Glory So Great, Light So Bright, Endless Euphoria My Main Sight
What Is Justice When Time Stands Still And Old School Players Play Their Role ?
When Is The Time When You Fall In Love ? And The Darkness Is Destroyed ? 
How The Dawns Light Signals The Ultimate Fire Fight.
Who Must Come To End These Tear Dropping From Skeletal Fears ?

Timelines Define, Emancipating, Never Caring For The Devils Lifeline
In Golden Solar Systems Rests The Hybrid Race
Destined To Complete A Story Oh So Suppressed

Requiring More Than Most Know To Balance The Equation
It Is Heavens Song That I Sing Deep Within
The Universal Score Now You Know
Burdens On Ones Back Some Times To Much To Bear
Tears Fall Down A Catalyst For Known
