This is a 3 part series on how to build a computer from Newegg

Part 1: Welcome to Newegg TV's How To Build a Computer tutorial!
This is Part 1, where we'll be covering the different components that make up a typical computer, as well as the different functions they perform. Also, we provide some advice on planning out your build and choosing the best parts to suit your needs. 


Part 2: Welcome to Part 2 of Newegg TV's How To Build a Computer tutorial: The Build!

In this episode we've gone for epic-scale length and detail. We have two complete builds to share, and step-by-step instructions for how they're put together.

To make the video even longer, the first half covers an "external build", which involves connecting your core components outside the case to do a test boot and make sure everything is working. Defective parts are rare, but they can put a damper on your build if they're not identified early in the process.

Next up is installing parts into the case, cable routing, and the moment of truth: the first boot after assembly is complete. Enjoy!


Part 3: Finally we come to Part 3 of Newegg TV's How To Build a Computer tutorial: Installing Windows & Finishing Touches. As a bonus Paul also takes some time at the end of the video for some Q&A, in response to comments from Part 1 and Part 2.


BONUS: I also added in how to install an AMD CPU for those AMD builders and everything else towards building a computer is the same for AMD and Intel.

I do not work or own Newegg I just simply thought of sharing this with people who are interested in building their own computer :)
