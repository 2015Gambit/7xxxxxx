A/10 V/10.
Many thanks from all of us with limited bandwidth."
,juanmanytacos,2012-10-14T07:19Z,yeah great nice small files but this one and a couple more are 10-bit (hi10profile) encodes which are not supported by any hardware players such as ps3 xbox or even wdtv media players.  I think even the only codec that supports 10-bit AVC is the latest CoreAVC.  Sticking to 8-bit would be nice

juanmanytacos, watch it in your computer or buy a Bluray copy of it..."

This has shit every 10min or so--for 30 secs--like ""Encoded by VYTO"" in bright pink letters, then some website addr, then some other crap--repeated throughout the movie!! 

Hey VYTO: you are a first class a-s-s-h-o-l-e."
