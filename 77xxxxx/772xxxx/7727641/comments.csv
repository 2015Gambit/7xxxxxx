,poc12345,2012-10-15T00:35Z,ARE THE SCENES IN THE CORRECT PLACES
,andrew5500,2012-10-15T07:17Z,"I don't know about this one but in your previous one, the scene between Janek and Vickers where he talks about the base is in the wrong place. Janek says that he's telling her this because she's just killed a man (referring to her burning Holloway) yet the scene is placed before Vickers kills him."
