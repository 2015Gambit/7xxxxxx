,zeuslogan,2012-10-17T15:26Z,Damn cartoon network pushed back all new episodes from Young Justice and Green Lantern back to January.  Are they trying to get this show cancelled?
,s1raz1,2012-10-22T16:39Z,"Its not that, WB and DC were on a legal dispute about who profits from DC characters.
This was also in between about the lawsuit about Superman creator grandsons. At least for Superman DC got the rights to use Superman as they fit. WB own DC but not DC comics characters its a F up loophole."
