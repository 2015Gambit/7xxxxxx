With Wynton Marsalis and Courtney Pine.

from the liner notes:

For the purist this disk was recorded with two microphones direct to two track analog, with no mixing, editing or over dubbing. For the audiophile, this disk was recorded to digital muti track tape, edited and mixed several times.  For the listener and music lover, it really doesnt matter!
