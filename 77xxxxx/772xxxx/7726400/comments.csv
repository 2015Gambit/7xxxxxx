,Sierra-117...,2012-10-14T18:55Z,"ya hi i installed it, but the hack thing wasn't needed at all. When i put the serial code in it just excepted it"
,ricksadhu,2012-10-14T19:03Z,"Ok I downloaded the latest version 6.12 from their site and followed your instructions and guess what, I am enjoying the full version,that simple trick never came into my mind thanks."
,bert16,2012-10-15T04:04Z,One thing I've noticed with IDM is that if there's a strange serial number in your registry it's almost always grandfathered in when you patch idman.exe
,aananhkr,2012-10-15T07:32Z,Will I be able to update when a new version comes? :)
,aananhkr,2012-10-15T07:38Z,Yup I can xD

You won't get lifetime anything and if like me you will get your history and bookmarks erased. I don't comment much and you can see that I don't react to false positives but I'm just warning everyone, F this guy. I haven't looked at his history yet but thats what I get for DL'ing from no skull"
,nerv666999,2012-10-16T05:23Z,"Just to add, exactly as I thought his extensive history is all of one file this one. "
,dinukad,2012-10-16T09:45Z,"@nerv666999 

Tonec Inc. is the verified publisher for IDM. If you didn't know that just see what is IDM's official site says.   http://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/support/about_us.html"
,dinukad,2012-10-16T09:55Z,"@nerv666999 

If you want to go to upper link before that just clear the lines of code we added to the hosts file. 

I think you don't even know what hosts file is doing. poor guy."

,dinukad,2012-10-17T09:55Z,"@lqwwssd

After adding my lines of code to hosts file save it. then do this to it. Right click the hosts file, go to properties, then click on security tab then select Administrators. now click on Edit button. again select Administrators and tick all check boxes under Deny. now apply it ,now ok........."

you can also try steps on up comment."
,hitman_007,2012-10-17T14:37Z,"Proper steps to install IDM for lifetime:
1. Install IDM from this torrent or download & install it from their website & install.
2. Do all the steps as mentioned in this torrent instructions. U should probably get a full version of IDM.
3. The only problem you would experience is when u try to update the program
4. On clicking ""Check for updates"" it shows something like ""File is damaged.......do you want to repair it""
5. It then shows you 2 options i.e. YES and CANCEL. Click on YES as clicking cancel will cancel the operation & u won't be able to update.
6. What happens when u click on YES is that it updates itself BUT it changes the value of ""127.0.0.1"" to ""#27.0.0.1"" in the hosts file. As a result when u restart ur pc it will again show that ""IDM is registered using a fake serial........IDM is now exiting""
7. To SOLVE this problem all u need to do is change the value back to ""127.0.0.1"" in the hosts file after updating IDM.
8. But remember you will have to do it each time after updating, which is around one time every 1-2 weeks whenever a new update is released.
9. If u follow all the steps correctly, this works 100%.
10. If anyone has a doubt regarding installation, plz post it in the comments, I will be glad to help you out. 
@UPLOADER:
TNX a lot for this nice upload/trick. Was tired of downloading & installing IDM again & again whenever a new version came up."
