Hawaiians in Paris 1916-1926 (Fremeaux & Associes) [FLAC] {MKOP}

''During the Roaring'20s, hawaiian music washed across Europe like gentle island surf. More fantasy than fashion, it brought a breath of calm between the two world wars.'' 

This is a nice set of vintage "hapa-haole" Hawaiian novelty music from the 1920s. Although it's often listed as a "various artists" collection, this is actually almost all by the same artist - Hawaiian expatriate Franck Ferrera, who lived in Europe for much of his professional life (and later headed for the United States, where he played country music as well as island music). There are two tracks by another group, but mostly this is Fererra's show... Which is fine, 'cause it's all fun stuff! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Music Guide)
