

 When you call on me 
 When I hear you breathe
 I get wings to fly
 I feel that IΓÇÖm alive

 When you look at me
 I can touch the sky
 I know that IΓÇÖm alive
 Mmmmm Ohhhhh 

 When you bless the day
 I just drift away
 All my worries die
 IΓÇÖm glad that IΓÇÖm alive

 YouΓÇÖve set my heart on fire
 Filled me with love
 Made me a woman
 On clouds above

 I couldnΓÇÖt get much higher
 My spirit takes flight
 Cause I am alive
 OHHHHH

 (When you call on me)
 When you call on me
 (When I hear you breathe)
 When I hear you breathe
 (I get wings to fly)
 Fly
 I feel that IΓÇÖm alive
 I am alive

 (When you reach for me)
 When you reach for me
 (Raising spirits high)
 God knows that

 That IΓÇÖll be the one
 Standing by

 Through good and 
 Through trying times

 And itΓÇÖs only begun
 I canΓÇÖt wait for the
 Rest of my life

 IΓÇÖm alive ...
