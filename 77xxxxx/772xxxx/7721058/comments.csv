,Super-E,2012-10-16T15:02Z,Fuck it im j taggin this bitch
,collinsrv,2012-10-17T01:35Z,"@IAmUgly
You need an Xbox flashed with LT 3.0, a program called utorrent (thatÂ´s the one i use) to download the torrent file, a dvd burner, a program called imgburn to burn the game and a dual layer disc of course.
USB HDD wonÂ´t work unless u jtag or RGH your xbox."
,xstationbr,2012-10-18T07:07Z,"This is compressed 4.92 when you download is done and before you unzip the iso shows 8.5gb.
No problem just play fun."
,Super-E,2012-10-19T03:53Z,You can execute it through wasabi 360 that thing is beasty 
,jakenator,2012-10-19T04:48Z,"Thanks thenoobish works wonderfully on my RGH xbox, one of my favorite old school scary games :)"
,cfinney5534,2012-10-20T00:40Z,"Through IMGBURN the file is reading 8.13 GB (8,738,846,720 bytes) so it wont fit on a 8.5GB disk. Any ideas I've tried using over burn and truncated like Super-E with no success "
,Super-E,2012-10-20T04:48Z,Yeah Im wonderin if its really Pal Im gonna try with my wasabi but this game and 007 legends are on the same sheet of music whats ever that may be

,abicafan4ever,2012-11-01T22:39Z,Anyone having problems with this game freezing up? I got 1/3 through the game and went to load up my game and it keeps freezing. It also froze when I started a new game :/
