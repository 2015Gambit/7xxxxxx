In a castle high on top of a hill lives an inventor&#x27;s greatest creation - Edward, a near-complete person. The creator died before he could finish Edward&#x27;s hands; instead, Edward is left with metal scissors for hands. Since then, Edward has lived alone, until a kind lady called Peg discovers Edward and welcomes him into her home. At first, everyone welcomes Edward into the community, but soon things begin to take a change for the worse.
