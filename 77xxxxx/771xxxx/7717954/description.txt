Hitman Codename 47 compilated by me with InnoSetup

.::HISTORY::.

Hitman: Codename 47 is the first game of the Hitman series. It was developed in Denmark by IO Interactive and published by Eidos Interactive, released in 2000 for Windows.
The protagonist is a human clone known only as Agent 47. He shows very little emotion, and exists to perform contract killings for the International Contract Agency, with Diana Burnwood as his handler. The story takes place in 47's adulthood, when he escaped from Asylum and started his work as a hitman.

In the game a player's main objective usually involves assassinating certain targets. Before each mission, you get Intel on your target (their appearance, videos of their daily activities, etc.). You can watch maps of the area while your mission is taking place. There is also an option to buy weapons and items the player wishes to use during the mission with money, which they get by completing missions. As long as the player doesn't kill civilians or police officers, they will not receive money penalties. There is more than one approach that can be taken by player. Even though the game features many firearms, it is easier for players to use stealth rather than going in guns blazing as this can alarm targets and possibly make them flee the area. Players can also change disguise so they can pass in restricted areas unnoticed. Also bodies can be hidden by dragging them.

Just download it and have some fun =)
