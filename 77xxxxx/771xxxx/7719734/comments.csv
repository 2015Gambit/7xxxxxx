,whaletail935,2012-10-12T20:15Z,"Wow! You've Outdone yourself with these.  Must be from your personal collection as I've never seen these scanned.  I just ordered the Mignola issue which I see on here.

Can't wait to devour these?

BTW, I feel like there's an impossible to find, although recent, Modern Masters (not even available in print from TwoMorrows).  The artist escapes me at the moment.  If you're familiar, and have the book scanned, would you consider uploading it?"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-12T20:28Z,"Wooooow! My grammar was STUPENDOUSLY bad last night. I should really try to upload sometime before two in morning. lol

whaletail935, you're most welcome, and thanks for the kind words. But, ummm...

[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-12T21:38Z,"Ah, wait. My coffee has kicked in now. You're looking for a PARTICULAR, RECENT Modern Masters. Got it. I'm on the hunt for all of the Volumes missing from those two uploads. As soon as I have another batch ready I'll add them."
,Sealurker,2012-10-14T05:53Z,"Thanks for this upload man! Appreciate all the efforts you put into these torrents.

I see you take requests, so I thought maybe, if you have the inclination, could you please upload a torrent file of Framed Ink? I've been searching for one for a long time now.

Anyway, good job bro!"
,whaletail935,2012-10-15T02:44Z,"Yeah, it was MM #24 or #26, I think.  But with all of your uploads, I'm more than sated... Unless you've got some hidden horror gems waiting for dissemination."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-15T06:01Z,"whaletail935, I have all of them except for 23 and 26 now (up to Volume 28). I'm going to hold off for just a bit in hopes I can find those two and have the next upload complete the run.

Glad you're enjoying the ups. I don't make it a point to collect horror, so I'm never exactly sure what qualifies as such to the average reader. I definitely have some more books that qualify as horror for me, and that stuff will be trickling out in the coming days and weeks."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-11-12T08:19Z,"Seeing as how this torrent is getting a bit of traffic at the moment, on the off chance that Sealurker should return, I just wanted to let them know that Framed Ink is still on my search list (I don't own it, hard copy style). If I ever run across it I will upload it for you."
