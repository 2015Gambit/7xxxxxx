,jusclem74,2012-10-11T10:27Z,i appreciate the upload but why encode to dvd? it makes for a much bigger file size and longer download. 
,cubstudios,2012-10-27T17:54Z,When I do a search for top DVDR movies I keep running into your shit cams NLUPPER002. Why don't you fuck off? Or at least remove the misleading DVDR tag from your crappy uploads. Instead name all your uploads SHIT CAM. NEVER DOWNLOAD. Thank you.

What's the point?
Why waste other people's time?
Guys, please, stop mislead people."
