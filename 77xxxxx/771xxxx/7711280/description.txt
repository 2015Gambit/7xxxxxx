Mizuumi ryu Karate is a hybrid style of martial arts formulated and taught by Owen Johnston. The style is dedicated to the development of body, mind, and spirit. The nucleus of the style is formed by Heiwado Karate, Boxing, and various grappling arts. The goal is not to promote Mizuumi as any kind of "best" or superlative style, but simply as our own unique approach to existing traditional martial arts. Please visit the style's home page if you would like to know more.
