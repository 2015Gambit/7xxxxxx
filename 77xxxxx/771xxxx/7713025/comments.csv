What's really annoying is all you fucking NOOBS whining about speed and leechers. 

You know why its like this? Because its a fucking PUBLIC tracker moron. You little shits wouldn't know jack about keeping a ratio hence why you dorks aren't on any private sites. Heck I downloaded this in 30 minutes with my speed off a private tracker and that aint all that fast either, most downs take only 5-10 mins.

Hell other than some minor and mostly legal downloads I never use public sites like this. Too fucking slow and full of 56k immature crying bitches like you, not to mention the MPAA and other anti piracy groups.

Don't bother replying as I never look back on  or even remember comments. So have fun waiting for your downloads for a week or 2 LOL!

FTMFL!"
