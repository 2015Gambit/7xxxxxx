,SR4T9US,2012-10-10T18:58Z,So showing her tits is not nudity huh?
,HugoBossUnzipped,2012-10-10T20:08Z,"""Nudity or nakedness is the state of wearing no clothing.""
I'm really making an effort here to be civil to SR4T9US.
I strongly recommend that when you do not know what you're talking about that you kindly STFU.
Nudity is also NOT porn, so GTFU.
Thanks for the up 5-click, it's appreciated."

,Glenn1963,2012-10-10T22:48Z,"And no nudity doesn't mean it's NOT porn either.  

By your definition, a large percentage of the torrents here and in Porn>Movies don't even have nudity, so I'm not sure what your point is.

Regardless, by the TPB definition, this set is ""Porn"".

By my definition, it is much appreciated, 5-click."

[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-10-11T01:02Z,"@ SR4T9US Showing her tits is NOT nudity I think that's what's  commonly known as topless .

to be nude you must be devoid of clothing , I think 99% of people understand that concept , but don't believe me ,  here is a link that states it 
http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O999-nude.html

Also being naked does NOT mean it is pornographic .
“I shall not today attempt further to define [obscenity]; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it….”

That famous statement, uttered by the late Justice Potter Stewart in 1973 when faced with a case involving obscenity, illustrates the difficulty of trying to determine what constitutes obscene or pornographic content.

So we all have different interpretations of pornography . But I think just  like the late justice Potter "" you know it when you see it "" 
And in my humble opinion THIS IS NOT pornography . 
Likewise a girl could be fully clothed and sucking some guys cock , NOW thats pornography . 

Bottom line ,  Who cares what section it gets forced into . As long as it never gets banned . 

           LONG   LIVE  THE  PIRATEBAY"
,opus20,2012-10-11T06:08Z,Thank you 5-click and of course sq and Who-He-iZ. 
,5-click,2012-10-11T06:52Z,"I love these Interwebs Discussions. My intention was it, to show the Downloaders in the porn section the difference between the Fame-Girls and other sets like Met-Art. a.s.o.

There are so many differences in all the Countrys worldwide with the definition of 'nude', so i say it with, what it is in my Country Germany. - No Nudity - or like Steevo says, 'topless'. "
,diableriecurse,2012-10-12T01:50Z,"Whatever your views or opinions are on nudity, I like seeing her prefect, firm little titties!!!"
