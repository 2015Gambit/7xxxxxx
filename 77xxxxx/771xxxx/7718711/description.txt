The Echoing Green is an electronica/synthpop band. It began as a duo between Joey Belville and Aaron Bowman in 1992, and has since released eleven major albums.

While founder Belville is a devout Christian, it is difficult to apply the same label to the band itself. While the lyrics are at times clearly infused with a strong element of faith, they are not specifically based around praise. Christian artists also make occasional appearances. For instance, Riki Michele provided vocals on "Defend Your Joy", though she was uncredited for the part.

A remix of the song "Oxygen" from Hope Springs Eternal appeared on the Sci-Fi Channel's show First Wave.
