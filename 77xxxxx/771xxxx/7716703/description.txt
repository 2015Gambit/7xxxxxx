For Android 2.3.3 above

Today we announce XBMC for Android. Not a remote, not a thin client; the real deal. No root or jailbreak required. XBMC can be launched as an application on your set-top-box, tablet, phone, or wherever else Android may be found.

 If you don't understand just what this is, think of having Wind ows Media Center running on your Android device, fully customizable, open-source, and with full Python plug-in support. Now think of it on Google TV boxes, Android-on-a-stick style devices, or the Nexus Q. Music, video, internet apps like Pandora, all running on Android device. XMBC does all this, and more. Have a look at Wikipedia if you're not familiar with the media center concept.


I've uploaded both files rather than start 2 torrents you will have to determine which file is right for you.

Take note Full-neon.APK and NO-Neon.apk at the end of the 2 files
