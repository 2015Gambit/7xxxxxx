John Singleton&#x27;s portrayal of social problems in inner-city Los Angeles takes the form of a tale of three friends growing up together &#x27;in the &#x27;hood.&#x27; Half-brothers Doughboy and Ricky Baker are foils for each other&#x27;s personality, presenting very different approaches to the tough lives they face. Ricky is the &#x27;All-American&#x27; athlete, looking to win a football scholarship to USC and seeks salvation through sports, while &#x27;Dough&#x27; succumbs to the violence, alcohol, and crime surrounding him in his environment, but maintains a strong sense of pride and code of honor. Between these two is their friend Tre, who is lucky to have a father, &#x27;Furious&#x27; Styles, to teach him to have the strength of character to do what is right and to always take responsibility for his actions.
