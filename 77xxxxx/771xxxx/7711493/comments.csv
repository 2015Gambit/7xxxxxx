So sorry I havent been able to thank you for all these episodes ive missed msfenmore!! I need to go catch up all the way from September till now... i cant wait to see how they handled Ridge's exit

Im glad to see you're still around! :)"
[T],MsFenmore,2012-10-10T13:20Z,"Honestly? I think Ridges exit was a joke...and I think they are starting now with the final story for Stephanie, and that will be a huge loss for the show..."
,MsMuffet,2012-10-13T08:32Z,"I agree with you MsFenmore. I was so upset that the writers didn't have the decency to acknowledge Ronn Moss and his 25 years of service by doing a ""highlight"" episode. Instead it was Brooke-centric and Ridge just walked off stage with Eric. The plot is an insult to Ronn, his fans and long time viewers and proof that Bell spat the dummy big time when Ronn didn't resign. Ridge will be returning down the road, rumoured to be recast."
