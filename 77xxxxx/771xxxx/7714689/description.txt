The American Dream ΓÇô Federal Reserve Scam


The AMERICAN DREAM is a 30 minute animated film that shows you how youΓÇÖve been 

scammed by the most basic elements of our government and bank system. 


This film answers on important questions:


Do you know how your money is created? 

Or how banking works? 

Why did housing prices skyrocket and then plunge? 

Do you really know what the Federal Reserve System is and how it affects you every 

single day? 


THE AMERICAN DREAM takes an entertaining but hard hitting look at how the problems 

we have today are nothing new, and why leaders throughout our history have warned us 

and fought against the current type of financial system in America and Europe today.
