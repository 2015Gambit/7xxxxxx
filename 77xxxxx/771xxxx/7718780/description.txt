"Governor Dunston"

Jack and Liz find themselves at odds 
over political satire at "TGS". Criss 
and Liz make a surprising relationship 
breakthrough. Meanwhile, Jenna, 
discouraged by the disappointing sales 
of her summer dance hit, is thrilled to 
learn that Kenneth's mother and her 
boyfriend still buy music.
