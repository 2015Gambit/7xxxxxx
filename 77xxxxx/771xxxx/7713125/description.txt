I've never been a huge fan of this series, but I've had a couple of requests for it now, and I have no problem helping somebody find something they've been looking for.

However, since I'm not real into this one, I'm not really inspired to spend the couple hours making them look the way they should look. As such, some of them aren't of the best quality and they generally look different from one another. Some look good, some are just passable. Issues 9 and 10 were so small that you couldn't read a lot of the word bubbles, so I did run those images through the photo editor and enlarge them a bit.

Lastly, neither of these series are complete. The first series is missing 11-12, the second 4-6. I'd rather not upload incomplete runs, but it's a request and this is what I have.

Issues 1-10 of Gargoyles
Issues 1-3 of Gargoyles: Bad Guys
