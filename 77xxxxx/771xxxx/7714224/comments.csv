[V],twentyforty,2012-10-10T20:50Z,"FUCK OFF Gusava-Zen_Bug-anoXmous and STOP pounding ""minuses"" and then advertise own torrents.

ALL your accounts would be deleted including ALL your torrents on ALL your accounts.

and...

I get all your IP addresses (fuck proxies, fuck VPN man - I cut my teeth on 8080 and compiled PPP.exe in 1989...).
Downside would cost sooo fucking much.

You even will have no clue What and When."
