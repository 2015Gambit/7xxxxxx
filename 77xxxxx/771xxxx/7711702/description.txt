A London lawyer, who is about to be named Britain's youngest-ever 

judge, gets involved with his attractive young secretary. This leads 

to other events which interconnect with the lives and actions of 

many people: A young punk freshly out of prison, his friend who is 

desparate for money, the lawyer's wife, her lover, the secretary's 

flat-mate, the flat-mate's lover, to name a few. Everyone is guilty 

of something, someone of murder, and justice isn't always served.


Happy Pirating,
