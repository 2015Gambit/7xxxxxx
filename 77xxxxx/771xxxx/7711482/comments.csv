,Venadan,2012-10-10T16:35Z,"I am not requesting any movies now. I am leaving you for your own waiting list. Once you are open to requests, I will post mine. Any way, a small opinion. Don't waste time uploading the same titles posted by others. A lot of down-loaders & movies are waiting for your skilled ripping. Good luck. Mate"
