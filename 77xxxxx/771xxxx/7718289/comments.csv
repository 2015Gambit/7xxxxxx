Capt,  What capture program do you use?"
[V],CAPTAIN7SS,2012-10-13T02:16Z,..i use cdex
,thefizdude,2012-10-13T12:30Z,Many thanks!!
,grider,2012-10-13T17:45Z,You use cdex to capture internet radio streams?  
[V],CAPTAIN7SS,2012-10-13T20:08Z,"...yes....under ''tools'' there is a selection for ''record from analog input''....there is also a timer built in...for 3 hour radio shows...it seems better to record to a wav file first, then convert later...."
,grider,2012-10-14T20:14Z,WoW!  You do this all manually?  I was using replay A/V where it would automatically record shows.  You just set day and time to record for a station.  But it seems harder and harder to find stations that work with it anymore...
[V],CAPTAIN7SS,2012-10-14T23:03Z,"i didn't know about the replay a/v...and it seems that it's been discontinued

,grider,2012-10-14T23:32Z,Well I'm still using it.  I record as many streams as I want at one time.  I records the streams without having to hear the sound.  I just figured out that I can use media catcher to find the url of the stream.  Now it seems to be working just fine.
