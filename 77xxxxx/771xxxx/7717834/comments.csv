You see, a track ends in the very instant when a particular song ends, so the next track contains all the crowd noise and band banter and each song actually begins between 30 seconds and a minute into the track.

For example, they actually start playing Universally Speaking at 1:58 of the track named Universally Speaking. The same track ends in the same instant when the song ends, etc."
