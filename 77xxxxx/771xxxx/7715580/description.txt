A spacecraft lands in Metropolis Harbor, and Superman and The Legion Of Super-Heroes are on hand to greet it.  Its only occupant emerges to tell them that Earth is doomed.  Her name is Dusk, and she has made it her mission to warn worlds in the path of The Sun-Eater, a mindless ravager of stars that destroyed her own world.

Properly alerted, our heroes convene to figure out the best way to save the sun from this new threat.  Their first plan is to transport The Sun-Eater to another location, using a Boom Tube created by The New Gods Scott Free (aka Mister Miracle) and Barda.  When that fails, the heroes pour their energies into creating a second Sun that will lure The Sun-Eater away from ours.  The creature easily absorbs it, and then goes on to envelop the Sun of Earth, too.

The ability of Earth to support life can now be measured in days.  As some heroes try to maintain order and keep hope alive, others discover that the actions of The Sun-Eater will cause our Sun to go Nova, and obliterate our entire solar system.  Luthor and Brainiac 5 develop a way to contain that explosion, and hopefully, reignite the Sun.  This plan also fails, and one of the greatest heroes of DC must sacrifice his life to finish the job.
