Proper Notes:

The SKIDROW release doesnt properly handle the Steam API. As a result, the
game does not show any required information when you load a saved game
So finding your wanted save game, is like fishing in the dark, because all
saved games basically look the same. We included a screenshot on our ISO

and driven by revenge, you must become an infamous assassin, known only by

As you navigate a world torn apart by plague and oppressed by a government

system allows for the mastery of deadly new abilities and
devious gadgets
