,Necroclysm,2012-10-10T16:35Z,"Well, I must say it has been awhile since I have downloaded a uselessly nested rar of a game.

Even if your intent was to reduce the number of parts, you could have changed the original archive's part size instead of forcing double disk usage and unnecessary unpacking time.  It's not like you have to keep the files the same for any reason.

And before someone claims it doesn't use double disk space because you can delete the originals... sure... and not seed the files..."

1) Why did you leave the files in RAR format?  I appreciate the upload, but would it really have taken that much time to extract them before creating a torrent?  People are less likely to seed after they are done downloading!  Because I sure as hell am not keeping both the compressed RARs and the extracted files taking up space on my HD.  

2) Why did you link two different cracks in the comments?  What is the difference between FLT's ""PROPER"" crack and RELOADED's ""Real Proper"" crack?  Which one should we use?"
,XHaloXX,2012-10-11T23:40Z,"@moeburn1,

1. why dont you go and fuck yourself?
2. You are getting this shit for free asshole, so stop whining about it and thank the uploader.
3. If you dont like it , go and buy the game and shut the fuck up.

stupid motherfuckers!!!!"

Care to leave the childish comments behind and actually say something that makes sense?  Because ""go fuck yourself"" isn't a very strong argument.  If you read what I said, the first thing I did was thank the uploader.  I'm an uploader myself.  I can handle constructive criticism to make my torrents, and TPB, a better place.  Why can't you?"
,moeburn1,2012-10-12T13:55Z,"@XHaloXX nevermind, I see you have never uploaded a single torrent onto TPB, which makes your whiny ""stupid motherfuckers"" comments even less valid.  But next time you want to vent because your daddy hits you a little to hard, take a breath, check the ego at the door, and write some valid arguments, without any anger or emotion.  

That is, unless, you never want to be taken seriously and just want to make sure people can hear you scream."
,jtjh,2012-10-13T00:12Z,It minimizes itself a few seconds after I start it up. Why is it not working? I have more than enough power to run t.
