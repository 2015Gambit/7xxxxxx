Magdalena Lazarkiewicz is the sister of Agnieszka Holland, it's a pity she isn't better known. I somehow managed to acquire this Polish TV-movie on tape, now I feel like posting it.

The story concerns a woman who has to enter hospital, and the desparate cases she encounters among the other patients. It is full of "slavic soul", the colours are dak greens and browns, and the conversations are intense and philosophical.

An intimate look into a different culture.
