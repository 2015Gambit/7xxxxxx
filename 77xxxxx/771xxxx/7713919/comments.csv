,TheMXL,2012-10-11T04:07Z,Thanks!
,TURTLE1984,2012-10-11T04:53Z,Use Cheat Engine 6.1 for faster downloads with Utorrent; in case you do not already know.
,nignug,2012-10-11T05:02Z,Damn that seemed fast. Good thing I had other shit to occupy me between episodes this time.
,TURTLE1984,2012-10-11T05:05Z,"For my last post:

If you download Cheat Engine, leave everything as it is and don't change anything. Click on the icon with a computer/magnifying glass (under File) and find the program Utorrent; click on that. Only click on ""Enable Speedhack"" type in 0.1 and click apply. I get a shit ton of more speed with this, you can also use it for other programs like Steam to download games you bought faster."
,TURTLE1984,2012-10-11T05:05Z,For Steam click 0.3
,nignug,2012-10-11T09:39Z,"@TURTLE1984
Wow I have had cheat engine and utorrent for years and never knew that. I'll give it a try."
,nignug,2012-10-11T09:42Z,Alas I have been trolled.
,Necrogigas,2012-10-11T10:36Z,"At the end of the episode, the stats are labeled with variable placeholders. Does anyone know if that's an issue with the legitimate version too, or if its just this bootleg?"
,JMit,2012-10-11T16:38Z,"@TURTLE1984 Really? Don't you realize that this ""cheat"" just increases the value shown and not the actual speed?"
,TURTLE1984,2012-10-11T22:06Z,"@Jmit: I looked this shit up on youtube so I could download games faster. I assume it allows faster downloads from what I was reading. For me it has significantly, even in Steam, you will see the speed and download time change. I have downloaded games I bought from Steam without Cheat Engine and with Cheat Engine, I can say there is a HUGE difference. I am not a fucking genius, I am basically do the same shit as everyone else who is trying to get free fucking game. I Pay for them and when I can't, I come here. Why anyone chooses to bitch about shit like you have, boggles my fucking brain. "
,Frogstar1988,2012-10-11T23:42Z,AWESOME Thank you very much 3R01 I love this game 
,Amplethoraof,2012-10-12T01:36Z,"@Jmit: Yeah... dude, I downloaded this thing at 3 mb/s with his little trick, and it actually downloaded in 5 minutes. Thanks Turtles, you rock."
,TURTLE1984,2012-10-12T05:30Z,"@Amp: No problem, I was glad myself when I came across this. "

,elDunge,2012-10-12T23:46Z,"Like last time, reloaded created a new directory for the savegames. Copy the files from C:UsersUsernameDocumentsTelltale GamesThe Walking Dead Episode 3 to C:UsersUsernameDocumentsTelltale GamesThe Walking Dead Episode 4 to continue your game. I know you can start directly the episode 4 anyway, but the choices you makes are probably shared between episodes."
,grimypolx,2012-10-13T19:41Z,thanks 3R01!!!
,extazy00,2012-10-13T19:44Z,Here it says that fmodex.dll is missing from my computer..:(
,Murolol,2012-10-14T10:58Z,"How come its episode ONE for me? I missed the fmodex.dll file so i copied it from episode 3, works good but its damn episode 1 instead of 4 ... wtf?"
,Murolol,2012-10-14T11:04Z,"My bad, actually when u press play on episode 1 the episode 4 is loading, so everything is cool."
,IWalkWithACain,2012-10-14T17:10Z,"@extazy00
you can download that and put it in the directory if I remember correctly"
,rshkhsee,2012-10-15T05:11Z,"Good shit, my fav episode so far..thanks for the up"
,YURNXT,2012-10-15T13:05Z,"Anyone else having problems making the last 2 decisions in game?  Both the left mouse click, and the numbers buttons do absolutely nothing, Lee just stands there and doesn't say a word!"
,SirFF,2012-10-16T14:06Z,"Dont download this crap, first of all, you have to play selecting episode 1, which is kinda sad.

The major thing, is that you can't continue from a save file. I played 2 hours yesterday, wanted to play now. Yeah, good luck with that. There is no ""Continue"" button, or whatever, just the ""Play"" one. Well I pressed play without actually thinking anything, selected episode 1 ( y, crap ) and it got me to the beggining of the episode 4.. wtf? "
,SN0000PY,2012-10-17T06:19Z,good game
,DPerete,2012-10-20T11:34Z,"Works perfectly.
Already beated it in one day."
,gino1965,2012-10-25T15:02Z,Thank you!
,xsynari,2012-10-28T02:46Z,"To continue from previous games, open the Walking Dead 4 folder you just downloaded and click 'Pack'. Copy the folder 'WalkingDead104'. Go to the folder where your Walking Dead 3 game is saved (most likely C:ProgramFilesx86>The Walking Dead Episode 3). Open that folder and click 'Pack'. Paste the 
'WalkgingDead104' folder there. Click the 'WalkingDead101' application two folders up (within the Walking Dead episode 3 folder) and you should be able to continue your game.

If this still doesn't work for some reason, go to Documents>Telltale Games and copy all the files from Walking Dead Episode 3 folder into Walking Dead Episode 4 folder. This should do it."
,filip989,2012-11-22T01:14Z,"@xsynari thanks dude, the first part of your info works like a charm!"
,sitnafup,2012-11-24T01:12Z,"Followed all the instructions, tried to play, got black screen for a very long time.

All other eps work for me, incl 5."
