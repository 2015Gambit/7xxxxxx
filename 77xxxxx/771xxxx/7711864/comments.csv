Note: 
If you want to play in iTunes you'll need to open it in Audacity and then convert it to Apple Lossless. iTunes can't play Flac but if you have a converter that can play Flac files in iTunes then the audio will be EXTREMELY LOUD and warped. I don't think iTunes can handle high quality files like this."

Sounds f*cking amazing."
