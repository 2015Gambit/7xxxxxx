   Image-Line SimSynth Live v1.1.15 - R2R



MiniMoog meets Oberheim

SimSynth Live captures the big multi-oscillator sound of a MiniMoog, and combines it with the warm, fat sound of Oberheim style SVF filters.

The result? Rich strings, wall to wall brass, and fat punchy basses. And we haven't forgotten techno sounds either. SimSynth Live uses a filter technique that gives the EMPH knob a sound you can crank.

3 oscillators, each with a dual (warm) mode effectively making 6 oscillators

A dual SVF filter that programs like an old Oberheim SEM, (lets you mix lowpass, bandpass, and highpass)

Two discrete envelopes and an LFO.Stereo chorus effect, (in case 6 oscillators aren't warm enough)
