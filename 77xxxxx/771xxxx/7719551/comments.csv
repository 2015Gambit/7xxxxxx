,ryan12151987,2012-10-12T20:42Z,WOW!!! Retrenched..... You really have NO EDUCATION on ANYTHING... KNOW THE FACTS BEFORE YOU FORM A BIASED OPINION...
,ryan12151987,2012-10-12T20:52Z,"Paul Ryan was interrupted 87 times. Biden acted like a child. There's one fact you can't dismiss.... and if you do, well, then I know who you are as an individual...an immature excuse making child. GROW UP in that case Retrenched and do some reading!!! Maybe a book, an article, stats, census, logistics, etc... something economical, educational, political, or historical. If you haven't and won't then you are lazy and have no right to spread your biased views. Yes, we live in a nation with free speech and press, but most of that is factual, not based on ZERO EVIDENCE. Romney and Ryan have the facts, and because you're illiterate doesn't mean you can talk shit. Again, I urge you to read, because the truth is staring you right in the face. Right before your eyes, Obama has fooled you. From 8.3% to 11.5% unemployment and people without jobs, tell me, did Obama's plan work??? Find me some evidence that says an increase in job loss is never political or economical in ties, and then I will listen to your rhetoric. Until then shut the fuck up!"
,Tyson212,2012-10-12T22:27Z,"@Ryan....

Please shut the hell up...

I can't believe you used the word ""facts"" and Romney and Ryan in the same breath. While you're at it, why not tell everyone that rush Limbaugh and Hanny aren't racists, that FoxNews actually tells the truth, and that the president really isn't an American because of his middle name?

I'd call you a dumb ass, but you do that enough on your own.

I mean, seriously....they have FACTS on their side? FACTS!!?! These are the same people who you believe when they say the president claims ""you didn't build that"" was a jab at people who own businesses...without ever playing the entire tape. These are the same people you believe when they deny their own words, even though they're ON TAPE calling the 47% and the 30% of Americans moochers. These are the same people you believe when they try to say they're on side A, even though they're on tape MULTIPLE TIMES standing on sides X, I, E, and T...

Come on now...don't make a dick of yourself trying to defend the very people who don't give two shits about you unless you're a billionaire."
,comstock8605,2012-10-14T10:23Z,"I find it very funny when I hear Romney saying that he isn't for something that he clearly in the past said he was for. Romney & Ryan have a ""plan"" that no one even knows about that supposedly will create millions of jobs. He also says that he will not raise taxes on the middle class but advisers state that with this so called ""plan"" they would have too. Sorry to say but there are jobs out there for the people who are qualified. You can't just sit on your ass all day and expect the job to come to you. That isn't going to happen. I'm an Independent and know for a fact that Romney & Ryan are full of shit. I won't forget that speech either about him not trying to convince the 47% of Americans that have already made up their minds. What a joke of candidates to choose from. I think we would be better with Obama for now. This is coming from an Independent. Oh by the way, I'm kinda glad Ryan was interrupted that many times  because I could see the bullshit rolling out of his mouth."
,AlexLibman,2012-10-17T06:01Z,"There's nothing funnier than convincing a minimally-educated idiot that he's a genius, and then watch him go around spewing nonsense.  That's how most Democrats are - completely ignorant of economics, geopolitics, history, and science.  They only thing they know is that they know everything."
,pragmato,2012-10-26T09:42Z,"Has either of you enraged folks heard the tearm by lewis black "" bowl of shit that looks into a mirror"", pertaining to the political systems of the U.S.? Just calm down and face it that the whole system is corrupt & hypocritical. have a nice day. Also: comment section is for the status of the torrent. Just sayin'... =)"
