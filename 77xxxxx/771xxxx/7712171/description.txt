Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, October 9 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex confronts the latest news, including further developments in the economy as it continues its slow-motion implosion. 

He also talks about a prediction that within 75 years the trendy among us will be walking around with smart phones implanted in our heads, an idea that is one step beyond the predictions of the futurist Ray Kurzweil and others. 

Alex talks with Pastor Lindsey Williams who has tracked the machinations of the elite as they choreograph the destruction of national economies and the sovereignty of nations. Williams is the author if The Energy Non-Crisis.

Not mentioned in the official show description, for the last half-hour of today's broadcast Alex talks in-studio with Ron Hubbard of Atlas Surviror Shelters.
Alex apparently intends to join the elite in buying one of these. Hubbard said he's extremely busy, but that since Alex is "special" he could probably get one done for him by the end of the year.
Hubbard's website -- atlassurvivorshelters.com -- is currently unreachable.
