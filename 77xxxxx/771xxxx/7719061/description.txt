W4F GROUP NEWS

W4F is one of the oldest TV Scene groups and releases a diverse mix
of quality TV programming including sports, documentaries, scripted,
reality, talk shows and other quality content that may be overlooked
by other groups. We release purely for fun and to share programming
we like with the world.

W4F is a global group interested in spreading quality programming
from around the world to the internet. If you are passionate about
your country's TV content, feel it is unrepresented and want to share
it with the world please feel free to contact us. We are interested
in all television markets with a focus on English content from the
USA, Canada, Australia and Europe. Potential recruits will preferably
have the ability to receive digital TV broadcasts and some knowledge
of digital capturing.

From time to time we are also interested in hearing from site
owners who are interested in affiliating W4F. We are looking for
private links with archives.

W4F has nothing to do with torrents/p2p so don't ask about that

Greets to all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)
