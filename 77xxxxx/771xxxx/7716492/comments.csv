[V],albiondean,2012-10-11T22:47Z,"Thanks for your honesty chap, file sharing isnt what it used to be, people used to be grateful, just as long the files was watchable. I started off doing F1 years ago when it was ITV, then i did BBC.

last year the BBC coverage was the dogs bollocks, better than speed tv what ever that is cuz i aint never watched it,


but now according to some, and its of cause their own options, $ky is the best. When ever i can i will always cap from BBC rather than $ky."
