1.-Gauguin.The.Full.Story
 
One hundred years ago, on the Island of Hiva Oa in the Marquesas, a syphilitic and alcoholic Frenchman called Paul Gauguin died of a heart attack. At that point nobody realised the incredible impact Gauguin's work was to have on modern art.

Art critic and broadcaster Waldemar Januszczak has written and directed this examination of a man who was not only a great painter but sculptor, wood carver, musician, print maker, journalist and ceramicist. As well as telling the remarkable story of Gauguin's life, Januszczak also celebrates Gauguin's achievements and examines the various accusations of sexual misconduct, familial neglect and racism that are frequently made against him.

The film contains many of Gauguin's masterpieces and includes paintings recently put on show at the Hermitage in St Petersburg which haven't been seen in public since their disappearance during World War II. 

2.-Private.Life.of.a.Xmas Masterpiece: God's child.

Art history series looks at God's Child by Paul Gauguin. This painting is a nativity and, since it is by Gauguin, it is modern and fresh like few recent nativities. The painting is intensely personal: the Madonna is Gauguin's young Polynesian mistress, who was pregnant with his child. It is a brilliant departure in other ways from traditional nativities and has a relevance for our contemporary world.
