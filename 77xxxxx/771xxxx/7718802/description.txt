Everywhere i look people are always looking for the same things.An alternative to iTunes.Something that is faster and easier for managing your iPod and maybe even lets you copy the iPod to your computer.
A good,fast audio format converter.
A cd ripper/file auto-tagger that actually works?
Winamp is all that and more.
Although it doesn't work with some newer pods and phones,it's much faster and easier for putting music on most iPods.
Rips to any format and properly labels the files.No more unknown artist.
Let's you edit the disc properties.You can change how it reads the disc.
Adding music auto-tags the files and most are given their proper names without you doing anything.Sometimes you need to manually auto-tag.
I have seen it make mistakes(rarely) but i have also seen it properly label a cd that was self released on burned cd-rs(about 200 made).
Winamp also makes it easy to change the properties of the files.You can right click as many files at a time as you want and batch change any property.

This keygen unlocks all the pro features.Just click >5,enter any name then generate.
