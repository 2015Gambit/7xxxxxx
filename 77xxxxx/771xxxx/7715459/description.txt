Read by Malcolm Hillgartner, 96 kbps, Unabridged

Widely and enthusiastically acclaimed, this is the authorized, definitive biography of one of the most fascinating but troubled figures of the twentieth century by the nation's leading Cold War historian. In the late 1940s, George F. KennanΓÇöthen a bright but, relatively obscure American diplomatΓÇöwrote the "long telegram" and the "X" article. These two documents laid out United States' strategy for "containing" the Soviet UnionΓÇöa strategy which Kennan himself questioned in later years. Based on exclusive access to Kennan and his archives, this landmark history illuminates a life that both mirrored and shaped the century it spanned.

ΓÇªJohn Lewis GaddisΓÇªhas brought again to life the dilemmas and aspirations of those pivotal decades of the mid-20th century. His magisterial work, George F. Kennan: An American Life, bids fair to be as close to the final word as possible on one of the most important, complex, moving, challenging and exasperating American public servantsΓÇªMasterfully researched, exhaustively documented, Gaddis's moving work gives us a figure with whom, however one might differ on details, it was a privilege to be a contemporary.

No one is better suited than Gaddis to write this authorized biography of George F. Kennan: the noted Yale cold war historian had total access to KennanΓÇÖs papers as well as to his family members and associatesΓÇöKennan so trusted his biographer that he remarked, ΓÇ£write , if you will, on the confident assumption that no account need be taken of my own reaction... either in this world or the next.ΓÇ¥ Through his privileged relationship with Kennan, Gaddis reveals the man behind the public persona as an agonized and fragile individual who often felt alienated from the U.S. and his fellow citizens, despite his tireless service to his country. In addition to the intimacies of the work, Gaddis offers critical analyses of KennanΓÇÖs key roles as diplomat, policy maker, and scholar of Russian history. Unsurpassed in his strategic vision during the cold war, Kennan is credited with being responsible for much of AmericaΓÇÖs eventual victory, and therein lies the impetus behind this remarkable biography. Adroitly managed (if occasionally barnacled with extraneous facts), GaddisΓÇÖs work is a major contribution to KennanΓÇÖs legacy and the history of American foreign policy.
