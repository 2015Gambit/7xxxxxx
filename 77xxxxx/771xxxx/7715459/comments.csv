Have to ask, though... any chance you will post the pdf for this volume? Come to think of it, do you have any of his volumes to post? Again, many thanks!"
[V],rambam1776,2012-10-11T05:36Z,I have no access to such. This was just a standard audiobook. I don't even know if a PDF of his stuff his available. The last I saw of any of it was in a dusty old tome back in grad school.

[V],rambam1776,2012-10-12T05:02Z,"Well, (as you clearly already know) this isn't ""history Channel"" level material. This is grad school stuff. I don't want to deter any newbies to the topic, but folks like Kennan don't get movies made about them. Studying people like him is the like the difference between passing a first aid class and becoming a doctor. History is filled with critically important people who don't get popular press because they are no titled or in an exposed position. George Kennan (such a person) had a greater effect on American foreign policy than most presidents. If you are a serious student of history, an full understanding of this man, and those like him, is crucial. However, there will not be an episode about him on the (laughably named) History Channel. 

This is grown-up stuff. I encourage all who read this to step forward into a wider world."

Thank you."
,drymoused,2012-10-13T17:33Z,How disgusting that a war criminal like Kissinger is quoted for a review on a book about one of the good guys. Typical of this neo-con poster to dredge up a self-serving review rather than an honest one.

Yeah I got it from that right-wing Nazi website, Barnes & Noble.

You're really beginning to reach, mouse. Eat some poison cheese."
