The Game here is XCOM: Enemy Unknown."
,4331a,2012-10-10T03:07Z,Pic from wrong game?
,Piratechnix,2012-10-10T03:10Z,LOL
,crn33,2012-10-10T03:11Z,"Do I have to ask which game this is, or is my question obvious?"
,krdonnell,2012-10-10T03:23Z,Install and Play? No crack?? Someone plz comment on this. The other upload has no crack yet?
,Kamadas,2012-10-10T03:30Z,seems legit
,Whobuysgames,2012-10-10T03:34Z,Downloading. will post results
,TheMadBro,2012-10-10T03:34Z,I can't be certain but odds are that the game was repacked with the crack inside.
,Brooce,2012-10-10T03:38Z,"Can you upload a crack-only, by any chance?"
,sp4rk13,2012-10-10T03:41Z,"setup.exe there isn't a ""crack only"" to upload"
,jimmymkd,2012-10-10T03:44Z,can some1 confirm if this torrent has a working crack?
,garlor,2012-10-10T03:45Z,anyone could upload just the crack?
,Stroth,2012-10-10T03:52Z,It's cracked. Fairlight released it a couple of hours ago.
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-10T04:01Z,"FLT have the habit of making these releases with the crack already pre applied, so yes it is cracked, but you dont need to do the copy crack over exe thing... :) Great fucking game as well, so this is a keeper. Both dishonored, and this game xcom enemy unkown are both really good games..."
,Deborg,2012-10-10T04:04Z,"Skidrow has done it as well , just downloading the crack only . Will not post a torrent here . So go ahead and DL it from Skidrow games"
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-10T04:05Z,"Fairlight often pre-apply the crack in their installers, so you dont need to move files from any ""crack"" folder as its already cracked...."
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-10T04:09Z,"Sorry for the doubleposting, or tripple with this one, but comments are really slow here sometimes, so I thought my first comment never got registered, so I wrote a new post... damn slow TPB are lately, anyone know why? Plus the old ""search engine overload"" has started to come back lately, just after the 2-3 day break that tpb had last week when they had those issues?:)"
,Kamadas,2012-10-10T04:20Z,yep thats what I heard Stroth :)
,Klimt_Westwood,2012-10-10T07:16Z,"Does it work on Windows XP (which are ""not supported"")?"
,Takkote,2012-10-10T07:26Z,Is it multi?
,Arcturus519,2012-10-10T07:33Z,"*WARNING* this version is *NOT* the FLT release of this game.

It may be a repack using the FLT crack, but it is not their release.

It is also 1GB smaller, and the files are all different (after unraring and mounting the DVD's). 

It could easily work and I hope it does, but it is not the full FLT release."
,r1perek,2012-10-10T07:34Z,guys how change language in game ?
,taturner,2012-10-10T07:42Z,azaq318's uploads are always awesome
,rpguy,2012-10-10T08:34Z,Can someone tell me if this version includes the DLC pack?
[V],azaq318,2012-10-10T11:44Z,"Guys, help me SEED for you! Don't leave after downloaded, please!!
