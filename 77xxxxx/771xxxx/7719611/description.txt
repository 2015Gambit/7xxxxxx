SYNOPSIS When Paulino Mungcal and his co-worker in a lahar-filled quarry unexpectedly dig up the remains of his 2-year daughter Marikit, they discover that she showed no signs of decay.  Could this be a miracle, and could she -- despite death ΓÇô cure the sick? Inspired by whatever healing power the deceased child may have, Pol asks the church to declare her a saint.  But how, when her resurgence stirs up emotions buried by time, and shores up questions about pure love, guilt, sin and salvation?
