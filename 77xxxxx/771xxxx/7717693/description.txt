Valora is a six piece hard rock band from Whittier, CA. featuring electrifying frontwoman Syd Duran. Syd's powerful vocals and stage presence have catapulted the band from obscurity to national attention.

Revolver named Syd the Hottest Chick in Hard Rock for July 2011.
AP named Valora one of the 100 bands you need to know for 2011. Breaking Benjamin's single "Blow Me Away" features Syd Duran of Valora, and is now Top 10 on Active Rock Chart.

I saw that there was no torrent on TPB for this band.  So here you go!  
PLEASE SEED!  And Enjoy!
