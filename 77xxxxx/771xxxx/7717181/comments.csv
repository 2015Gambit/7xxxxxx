,spyderx810,2012-10-14T05:16Z,"This one works, reloaded need to get their act together, never even released a fix...

This one loads past 1st level, and it's compressed so its only 1.12GB but extracts to fullsize after. 

No viruses here, runs great and now I can continue playing."
,vingadorjr,2012-10-15T20:08Z,"What the Hell! This version doesnt support 2 players and doesnt support other input then keyboard + mouse. How the heck will i play coop, if theres only one keyboard and one mouse? When i go to Settings, theres a option there to change the input type, but if grayed and i cannot changes it. Can someone confirm this? By the way... i DO have a joy connected and it doesnt recognise it. :("
