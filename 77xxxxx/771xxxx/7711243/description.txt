Problem: Midi does not represent the original game audio.

Solution:  I have creating looping music from the uncompressed
official OST. To make this pack a tradeoff between quality and
size, I have used Adobe Audition to create music with a target
bitrate of 192 in ogg Vorbis format.  The OST has superior 
audio quality to PSF and the original game.

Final Fantasy VIII came with midi only and no way to use stream
data like ogg Vorbis.  For this reason I have also created a DLL
called RaW, coded in Delphi 7, to play the music in the game 
using bass.dll.  

The DLL loads automatically on game start via Aali's driver.
The DLL supports all known languages of Final Fantasy VIII
