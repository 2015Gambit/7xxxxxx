,walrus00,2012-10-09T13:34Z,"Could you elaborate on the ""No recorded setting"" please?"
,walrus00,2012-10-09T13:50Z,"Could you please elaborate ""No recorded setting"" ?"
,shery007,2012-10-09T15:22Z,"Please any one explain wat do they mean by ""No Recorded Setting"".. thanku"
,rocky0412,2012-10-09T16:03Z,mates does the repack works??? any confirmations???
,topk,2012-10-09T16:08Z,"I recommend waiting a  couple days for a proper SKIDROW or RELOADED release, or worst case - downlaod the 3DM from user tikasukaz, because this here is shit. Rybak recoded it to LWOER quality textures and video ""for comfort"" aka to save a gig or two in size."
,SHr1KeS,2012-10-09T17:02Z,"does this do anything graphics wise? 

And wtf is the ""No Recorded Setting"""
,dietc,2012-10-09T18:18Z,this works like a charm. thank you.
,opaleg,2012-10-09T18:59Z,"saves are bugged. They do not overwrite and do not tell you the time. Other than the fact that saving is fucked up the ass, this works. Good luck playing while saving in a new slot every time. If you save in an old slot it will load the first time it was saved ever."
,an0n-0_o,2012-10-09T19:04Z,"Yup its working, saves fine but does not show time and date. I advise to get the newer v5 crack from 3DM also. 

Only been to the interrogation room so I cant say if going to be fine all the way.
Install size is 5.63 GB, the Movies folder have a lot of small loading screens and nothing big.
Not sure if there is suppose to be longer fmv or all cutscenes in the game are just pre-recorder but that is how it is on most Bethesda games."
,opaleg,2012-10-09T19:10Z,"update: I am 97% right on the saves. Autosaves seem fine but I am 97% sure overwriting saves does not work.. however after entering a new area it did overwrite the save with the new image.

Before it simply loaded the first time I saved the slot. So I am confused and maybe someone else can chime in or correct me on the problem.

Other than that THIS WORKS 100%"
,an0n-0_o,2012-10-09T19:15Z,Okay even with the newer crack saves are still bugged. Just like what opaleg said. You can see the date and time when you save but its gone(date and time) when you restart the game.
,axayd,2012-10-09T21:10Z,"thanks a lot hero :)
IT WORKS BRILLIANTLY WITH 3DM V5 CRACK uploaded by ghostnet.
thepiratebay.se/torrent/7710203/Dishonored.Crack.Only.v5.0-3DM
the default crack is normal 3dm v1 crack without any updates meaning it was game's fault. with the v5 update i can save, delete and overwrite saves, and the time and date show up fine after you save but not after you reload the game. a minor issue.
im pretty sure its meant to say ""no RECODED settings"" in description.
also there is an advert intro for some site when you run the game which can be removed by going to installation directory/DishonoredGame/Movies and removing a file called Black_266ms.bik"
,RFT2,2012-10-10T01:31Z,"Not working here.
It show a small window with strange letters when i try to install...

Windows 7 x64"
,Scarasyte,2012-10-10T01:52Z,Is the mouse supposed to be laggy in this game? They must be using a software mouse driver or something. Either way thanks for uploading this.
,jem7jam,2012-10-10T03:17Z,"works great on high setting on Nividia 240 gt ddr3
win xp
RAM : 1.5 DDR2
Pentuim D 3.4 GHZ"
,dietc,2012-10-10T11:51Z,"@RFT2: yeah, just pretend you can read what these strange letters say, and click your way through it like it was a normal installation. this is the only part that is not in english."
,tufel,2012-10-10T11:55Z,Is it just me or are the graphics crappy?
,jonjonson,2012-10-10T12:54Z,"http://www.gameinfocenter.com/pc-games/system-requirements/Dishonored.html

,jolle747,2012-10-10T13:44Z,"@tufel, The graphics may be a little tweaked since this is a repack, you see the size of it..."
,AnonymousUsernameHere,2012-10-10T14:58Z,"Works fine but I recommend using RELOADED crack before you start(or else you'll have to mess about with finding your saves like I just did).

With this crack your controls don't save, some of the options don't save and your save games aren't named correctly. The game itself works fine though, so this plus the RELOADED crack works great."
,MrTTAO,2012-10-10T19:29Z,"Removing logo designers and Titles is fine...
But the intro movie? why would you remove this?
And Compressed in Low Size for more Comfort? WTF!
Why make shitty console port graphics even shittier to save a few measily GBs?"
,walrus00,2012-10-10T21:03Z,"No recorded settings means your altered settings won't be saved when you quit.The new crack fixes this problem though,along with the saves not showing the time.I can't comment on the decrease in quality compared to the uncompressed version,but it looks good enough for me.Great game by the way.Thanks a bunch."
,jungro,2012-10-11T03:42Z,Compressed doesn't mean anything is missing. Have you ever heard of a zip file?
,jungro,2012-10-11T03:44Z,Why do you think it takes so long to install? It's uber compressed. Yeah the settings don't save. Before I knew an updated crack would fix it I just edited the baseengine.ini to settings that aren't even available in game. 16x anistropy + 8x FXAA + SSAO on.
,axayd,2012-10-12T01:53Z,Guys it works perfectly with reloaded crackfix. Save times show up even after restart of the game. I guess they win the scene battle this time lol
,firenzial,2012-10-13T04:50Z,Everything is working apart from the characters have no speech... all other sounds work but the speech is practically impossible to play... what do i do?
,firenzial,2012-10-13T06:58Z,why is it all in russian...
,anidt,2012-10-13T11:32Z,working gr8 in windows xp..thnx heromaster
,cervece41,2012-10-15T03:08Z,"The BEST torrent for this game, great dl speed, and works like a charm. (I installed it with the RELOADED crack). Cheers !"
,anidt,2012-10-17T21:14Z,i became a fan of u heromaster..gr8 torrent..1 thing ..plz use reloaded crack.coz the crack with dis torrent not working..(saving prob)..
