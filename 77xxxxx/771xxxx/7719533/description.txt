'365 Samurai and a Few Bowls of Rice'

Dark Horse Comics, 2009, 394 pages

Written and Illustrated by J. P. Kalonji

J. P. Kalonji wields a clean, street-informed style to deliver a tale that glistens with blood and drama, yet is ultimately uplifting. Nearly four-hundred pages long, this graphic novel employs full-page panels to tell the story of an Edo-era swordsman's quest for survival and enlightenment. When Ningen leaves his dojo at the request of his master - to travel the world and grow as a swordsman - he embarks on a journey that becomes a metaphor for the cycle of life and every human's spiritual growth.

Visually, this book looks VERY much like Jeff Smith's 'Bone' or 'Rasl', sometimes uncannily so. Good story, though. And it's a serious "page turner" - the 390 plus pages fly by pretty fast.
