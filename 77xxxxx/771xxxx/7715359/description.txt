Sex in the contract ΓÇô itΓÇÖs the only way super-focused, over-worked CEO, Ellison Thorne, is ever going to get laid. ThatΓÇÖs what his retiring business partner and secret match-maker, Beverly Neumann, thinks. SheΓÇÖs convinced no-strings, stress-free sex in certain employee contracts would raise productivity and minimize stress ΓÇö perfect for a busy executive like Ellis. But sheΓÇÖs joking, right?

Enter her hand-picked replacement, Dee Henning. Young, hungry, gifted, Dee is the queen of no time for sex. When negotiations on a major project break down, and Dee and Ellis end up in each otherΓÇÖs arms, the Executive Sex Clause suddenly becomes more than a joke. In fact hot executive sex just might be the ultimate secret weapon for success. But secrets seldom remain secret, and Dee and Ellis soon learn thereΓÇÖs no such thing as no-strings where the heart is concerned.
