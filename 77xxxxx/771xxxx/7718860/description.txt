"Growing Pains"

Elena awakens on the morning after the accident to 
find the thing she dreaded most has come true - she 
died with vampire blood in her system and now must 
go through the terrible transition to become a 
vampire - or face certain death. Stefan promises 
Elena that he and Bonnie will exhaust every 
possible way out of the situation, but Damon is 
furious with his brother for letting Elena die in 
the first place. Bonnie pays a terrible price for 
her attempt to change Elena's fate, while Damon 
takes out his frustration and rage on Matt. In a 
rare moment of empathy, Rebekah is deeply touched 
by Stefan and Elena's devotion to one another. 
Finally, Pastor Young and the Town Council members 
begin rounding up the vampires and their 
supporters, leading to an unexpected tragedy.
