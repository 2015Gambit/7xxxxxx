Captain Sternn is considered "part Han Solo, part James Garner from The Great Escape". The character, as written by Wrightson, is an amoral space captain whose adventures are set in the future. Sternn is sometimes considered a criminal with charges ranging from rape to piracy.

He is associated with supporting characters Hanover Fiste and Justin Tyme.

He is drawn as a caricature of Superman, although his clothing is different; he wears a pseudo-military uniform. He is always accompanied by a small, levitating one-eyed robot, named Beezer, that is his most faithful companion.
