,PapaGW,2012-10-11T18:16Z,"wzfellguard: Make sure that you have extracted the ""main.107.com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftWBHM.obb"" using 7zip. After that, transfer the files to the directory ""sdcard/Android/data/com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftWBHM/files/"".

   The symptoms you show look like you copied the directory straight over, without doing the extraction. "

Thanks you very much my friend.Your words are really appreciated.

@rhenceiphrel03

the first time you launch the game you need internet connection to verify the license.Then you are ok to play it offline too.

@valastolo

First unistall the game.Clear all data and delete obb file too.Then install the apk and then follow my instructions.

,bobiras2009,2012-10-15T15:20Z,"@valastolo

You format the cache of your phone?Format dalvic/cache files and then install the game."

,bobiras2009,2012-10-15T17:47Z,"@valastolo

Yep from recovery delete dalvic and cache.Also format system and then install the game again.

Can you please upload files for dungeon hunter 3 or  some adventure games. tnx

a connection error has occured."
,bobiras2009,2012-10-16T08:06Z,"@rhenceiphrel03

You must make something wrong in the steps in the txt.Install the apk then put the folder inside the sd data by bobiras2009 to sdcard/android/obb.
In obb folder you will put the folder that i have in sd data by bobiras2009.Then open wifi and must have an active internet connection and run the game.

About the dungeon hunter 3 i havent the sd data right now but i will try to download them in my phone and upload them here for TPB users"
