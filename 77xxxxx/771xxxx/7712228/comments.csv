,5Hour,2012-10-15T00:34Z,"Yeah, I'm having the same problem."
,Saitoshiba,2012-10-15T22:10Z,"Same problem here, guess the installscript.vdf it's a steam file extension. If I am not mistaken. However, don't know how to run. Somebody can help?"
,Saitoshiba,2012-10-15T22:11Z,Or valve data file
,Saitoshiba,2012-10-15T22:26Z,"Sorry for the spam, but if you don't have. To open the file search and install the ""Valve Source SDK"" it may take a while."
,5Hour,2012-10-16T01:16Z,I already had that installed in order to play Black Mesa. So what do I do now?
,Foolrkrum,2012-11-09T01:05Z,The pre-order content? Anyone?
