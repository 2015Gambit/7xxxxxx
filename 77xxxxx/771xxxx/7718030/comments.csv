,kaizerzero93,2012-10-12T04:36Z,"I ran Malwarebytes after I installed XCOM and Malware.Packer.Gen on the D3DRM.DLL was the only thing that popped up in the file I downloaded. 

Once deleted, no problems. Full virus-scan showed nothing. Hopefully, removing the .DLL won't cause problems for those that remove it from the download."
,Lobotomite,2012-10-12T05:19Z,OMG thanks so mich man ur top notch im playing the shit outta the dishonored rip now i got this for pure replayability

,reish,2012-10-12T07:56Z,So all the movies are removed including the english ones? Or did you guys re-encoded them to make them smaller?
,groppel,2012-10-12T08:09Z,"Hello,
i just wanted to know wether i can later apply updates to this release?! thanks!"
,nipunb,2012-10-12T08:42Z,"@reish: dude, the description clearly states that only the foreign videos are removed and the english videos are just re-coded to 720p, which is still awesome..."

,charsaur,2012-10-12T14:56Z,"could you upload just the DLC? 

I got it downloaded yesterday and I don't want to reinstall this and restart over again."
,XD22,2012-10-12T17:09Z,install.exe gives No Disk error o.o
,PHDIKOULAS,2012-10-12T17:41Z,this working or not someone confirm
,groppel,2012-10-12T19:02Z,"wow ppl please seed! i got just 15% of the game, my ratio is at 2.5 and the download is SLOW!"
,mrx5001,2012-10-12T19:20Z,Wow people seed!
,reish,2012-10-12T19:38Z,Is it just me or is this game buggy as hell? The Base U.I. is acting crazy. Can't close some windows/info.
,vonwisdom,2012-10-13T02:12Z,Works great.Just read how to install that's listed by this torrent poster on the page.
,wololox,2012-10-13T19:36Z,"PC specs: i5 2400, RAM 6GB, Radeon HD7850. On Win7 x64 launching XComGame.exe instantly crashes on kernelbase.dll.

People who dl'd skidrow's 5.45GB repack also had this error.

User bleh found out that they needed to rename some files in the install package. Not sure if this applies to KaOs' release too."
,wololox,2012-10-13T20:27Z,Welp nevermind my comment above. I installed it again manually (not through install.exe) and it works. Make sure to install the game in a short path (like on root drive backslash XCOM). Thanks for the release KaOs!
,pacbarros,2012-10-14T04:45Z,"I downloaded, installed following instructions (manually, though). Worked like a charm. Thanks a lot, Kaos"
,Zero.G,2012-10-15T04:03Z,"Is that 720p ""50%"" in the reencode, a 50% of the bitrate? Or meaning 50% of the 1080?"
,Fittler,2012-10-19T13:32Z,"My brother gets no sound from this version at al, what could be the issue? Al other games work fine. "
,MJD2008,2012-10-24T13:33Z,"This upload made me stop using torrents. Download was nice and smooth but then I hit so many brick walls. Tried the installer first(Worst installer ever made) Then I tried manual install, Both failed. Found out certain files had missing pieces so I deleted this and rechecked torrent. Tried the installer yet again it did something different so I figured it was the corrupt files. When it was done I checked the directory(Default installer directory) and the ony thing in there was movie files. So I tried manual again and the same damn thing. I've tried every X COM torrent on TPB and they all give me problems not with the game itself but the installation process. Out of my 5 years of downloading torrents I've never had such a hard time. But still ty for the effort I just can't handle torrents anymore."
,matekun,2012-10-24T14:02Z,Is the patch included?
,6667,2012-10-25T14:57Z,"Manually installed, ""xcom enemy unknown has stopped working"" error.  Oh well."
,herniator,2012-10-27T03:30Z,"Seems to work fine, installed to default directory (C:GamesXCOM.Enemy.Unknown-KaOs) using the installer, took about 7 minutes to fully unpack and install (Core i7-2600K, SATA3 SSD, Win7 64), size at end 8.82GB, 3153 files, 33 folders, no viruses.

Thanks!

Just waiting for the update-1 from kaos to finish downloading.

Love the game too :)"

,MaxRavenclaw,2012-11-04T18:22Z,"Strangely enough, both after installing with the installer and manually, I only get the extra folder. What am I doing wrong?"
,nvatix,2012-11-05T08:49Z,"Working , Thx"
,Arkane7,2012-11-12T16:07Z,"Works for me, thanks for this gansuk, great release for an amazing game."
