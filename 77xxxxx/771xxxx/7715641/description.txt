Phil and Claire have a five-year plan, and
that's to vacation and enjoy life once Luke
leaves for college. In order to keep all that
on track, Phil is going in for a vasectomy.
Meanwhile, Jay and Gloria disagree about

maternity clothes and now that Lily's in
kindergarten, Mitchell tries to gently steer
Cameron towards a part-time job to occupy all
his extra time
