,isepiq,2012-11-03T09:53Z,"I have ÂľTorrent set to upload this at 300K 7/24 on Hi Speed Cable. The cable company limits me to 2mb uploads, however, I put a Cisco3010 Docsis 3.0 modem on a couple of months ago & it is uploading at 5mb instead of just the 2, hahhahahah.  That should be helping some. Don't forget to seed after you get it, that is the only other thing that will make it faster.
IMHO
