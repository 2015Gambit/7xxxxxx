Phoenix

While on medical leave, Ducky orders
the exhumation of a Navy commanders
body from a case closed 12 years
ago. As a result, Gibbs tasks Ducky
with a slightly different role on
the investigation. Meanwhile, the
NCIS team investigates the recent
death of a Marine. As both cases
unfold, the team begins to question
whether the two are somehow
connected
