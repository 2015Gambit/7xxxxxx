Bryanzilla

Shania announces that she and her classmate
are "pretend" engaged and are going to hold an
imaginary wedding. Thrilled with the idea of
the upcoming nuptials, Bryan enlists the help
of a reluctant Rocky and dives head first into
planning the event of the season. Goldie
supports her daughter's fairy tale, but Jane
attempts to shut down the ceremony. Later,
David discovers just how important this party
is for Bryan and he makes a life-changing
decision.
