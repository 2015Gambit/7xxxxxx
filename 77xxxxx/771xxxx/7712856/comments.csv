"
[T],GlowGaze,2012-10-10T12:09Z,"Because when I upload the Episode ASAP, the Subtitles aren't ready at the time of the upload but will be in couple of hours or so...and when they are, I can't include them in the torrent by that time. But when they're ready by the time of the upload I usually do include them in the torrent itself

Why do I have to put ""+ Subtitles"" in the title? Because I can't edit it afterwards & the it's only the first couple of hours when the Subtitles aren't there anyway ;)"
[T],GlowGaze,2012-10-10T12:10Z,"I thought you got used to it already anyway ;)

Here's the direct link for them btw.....
