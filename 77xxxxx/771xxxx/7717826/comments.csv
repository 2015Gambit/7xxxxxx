,B.Torrents,2012-10-11T19:51Z,Thanks for the Update Maherz...+1 Added
,scodoo2,2012-10-11T20:25Z,"Thanks for the update Maherz, any chance for Windows 7 X64 October 2012 ?"
,Jeffa91,2012-10-11T22:14Z,"I want let everone konw this noob Windows XP has no Recovery Console and the old Windows Media Player and if you get a blue screen because of a SATA driver problem then you will be fucked.

You better of doing an updated Windows XP by yourself.

,lamportyx,2012-10-12T10:49Z,"this is great another, job well done!"
,viggen6666,2012-10-12T13:24Z,"Jeffa91, you don't know what you are talking about, this is by far the best edition of XP, no bugs, no problems, just perfect, everything very well packed and that's it, simple, straightforward"
,viggen6666,2012-10-12T15:50Z,"Maherz once again, thanks for you wonderful work, I see that you have finally made your signature on these builds of XP, on the OEM information, continue this way, my machine is running smooth and great thanks to you"
,Jeffa91,2012-10-12T20:30Z,"@viggen666
Haha kid you don't know what you are talking about, you are the one how never did an updated Windows XP wait till you get a windows boot problem then you fucked without the Recovery Console.
And there is also not point in not updating the Windows Media Player probably he didn't do it because he couldn't find the update pack for it on the msfn forum lol."
,viggen6666,2012-10-12T21:35Z,"Jeffa91 is that simple, can't boot, reinstall the OS, you don't need to format nor loose any setting, document, whatever you want to keep, on the same hard disk, I have come to the point, that I had bad sectors, and I accomplished to remove them, and reset the partition table, everyone is keen to install whatever software they want on their OS, and what version to keep, and this build simply accomplish that, simple, raw and bloatware free"
,Jeffa91,2012-10-12T22:46Z,"@viggen6666
Ohh nice idea reinstalling the OS and losing all my date only because someone couldn't do something like it should be done that's a nice solution.

I actually i would give a .... about it but if he doesn't write somthing like this in the Description than i don't want to know what eles he hides."
[V],Maherz,2012-10-13T19:19Z,"@B.Torrents
@lamportyx
Anytime guys ;)

@scodoo2
You're welcome.
Of course, will be uploaded soon, tomorrow I guess.

@Jeffa91
I've mentioned it about 100 times! When the I386 folder is edited the repair console disappears automatically!
You can't add SATA drivers without modifying that folder, got it?
Like it download it, don't like it, don't :)
Good luck.

@viggen6666
Thank you :)"
[V],Maherz,2012-10-13T19:24Z,"@viggen6666
Yes, I had to!
So many people steal my work and say it's theirs. This is the least I could do without missing with Windows."
,Neurono,2012-10-13T21:24Z,"@Jeffa91
Simply search for ""Windows XP Black Edition"" then you get SATA drivers and Recovery Console and WMP11..., i use it also now for some times and it works great."

I believe one of the best copiers/stealers is the rain, I've seen this build of xp on some forums/sites with the signature"" Only by THE RAIN"". Be carefull with him, you might get wet :P."

Thanks for making this, thanks for updating it and thanks for not junking it up with all kinds of crap progs!"
[V],Maherz,2012-10-18T22:28Z,"@brianxxx
You know how I started all this?
I was looking for what you call ""un-tweaked and un-junked"" release and couldn't find one! So I said why not make one for me and for anyone who's looking for the same thing as me.
I started November 2010, and here we go... :)"

,Tegra3,2012-10-21T03:50Z,@Maherz Can you please tell me why would I install Windows XP when Windows 7 and Windows 8 are out. What I mean to say is why did you install it and what are the benefits.
,asqw9,2012-10-21T19:47Z,Does this include integrated AHCI drivers? 
,Kryogh,2012-10-22T19:26Z,Does this install from a USB stick ?

U should also include these..."
,bobshishka,2012-10-26T00:23Z,"Which in your opinion is better between LuxLol and Maherz, and what is the difference? Not trying to start any rivalry just want to know which to get."
,krtislav11,2012-10-27T09:18Z,"@Tegra3 you idiot. There are still other people who don't have enough powered PCs, or old devices with no new drivers.
Also, XP is still one of the best windows OS
And also, if no one wants it, why is there 344 seeders?"
[T],Kurbaan,2012-10-27T12:26Z,"@Maherz

,Barrytoo,2012-10-28T02:33Z,"I love ur uploads man!
Thanx alot :)"
,TastyTeo,2012-10-30T18:07Z,Do we need to download other languages for example Greek manually after we finish the format? How do we add additional languages ?
,psyxodrama07,2012-10-30T22:10Z,I installed the version but I miss many drivers. What should I do? (This version requires validation and how can I change the input language?) Thanks for your understanding!
,triplec_killua,2012-11-01T07:31Z,Is it woking on iso only that i don't need to burn it in cd so i install it in VMWARE using iso only?
,papayrus1,2012-11-01T10:11Z,"LOL the questions people. You guys need a tech not an OS. You ask about drivers which tells me you must have never in your life installed windows before this and if that's the case use google and learn. Someone asks if all these things are included that have nothing to do with microsoft updates. If those things were included it would not be considered pure anymore it would be considered junked up or for others an added luxury. I agree it would be nice to integrate the latest media player, IE, dot net maybe, and visual c++ maybe accept that what if you never need dot net or all the visual c++ programs then you just added extra bloat. Generally if a program needs dot net or visual c++ it is going to install it anyway and it's not going to take that much time to do compared to downloading all of the updates which is the main point of this really which is why it is very useful."
,Addryann,2012-11-02T08:37Z,"Maherz, can you integrate in your next versions WMP11? Thanks in advance."
,papayrus1,2012-11-03T00:55Z,Agreed can you integrate the latest media player and IE please? Please do not integrate dot net and visual c++. Also one other thing that would be useful is to integrate the latest DX9.

,duriotic,2012-11-06T14:20Z,"@Addryann:  ""Fake?"" WTF does that even mean, fake?  You are as disrespectful as you are lazy.  Anyone with a mouse can find that Maherz has been uploading his regularly-updated, pre-activated, clean and uncluttered well-respected XP iso's for years now.

Microsoft may have given up on this serviceable workhorse, but Maherz hasn't.  It's not junked up with extras you can just dl yourselves (no limitations from MS on this one) and with its pre-activation is all ready to move into."
,Addryann,2012-11-06T16:46Z,"@duriotic

I was reffering to the fact that someone could have copied the contents of Maher's torrent, slightly modified it, and now assuming credit for something he didn't created. I've seen it many times before. Think before you write@"

I really can't realize why such a good upload has got so many negative votes?!... It's absolutely fine, clean, no bullshits added etc. At least for me works simply perfect.

Also I'm wondering why guys do you need stupid windows media player 11 since there are plenty of good (even much better) players available out there... Just try MPC-HC for instance: a very small and smooth player, also clean - no toolbars, added bulshits etc.

As for the IE - please iform yourself before asking nonsences. Latest IE which is XP comtatible is IE8 (which is already integrated in this torrent)!"

,toxicity9,2012-11-08T16:42Z,"@Maherz - how to burn this file , coz it shows as an winrar file with an .iso format but when i try to burn this with nero it gets burned as a data cd rather than a bootable cd.... plz help i am stuck.... thnx a ton ... !!!!"
,arsuzin,2012-11-08T21:12Z,"@ toxicity9

Personally I don't use Nero (or any stupid overrated comersial bloatware), so the quick solution for you is just to download BurnAware Free - very small and straigthforward burning aplication, install, run, choose ""Burn Image"", navigate to ISO file, then click ""Burn"". Wait process to finish. That's it, you are ready to go. (By the way - the procedure with your beloved Nero must be the same, or at least very similar)

Also you can go to WinRAR Options/Settings/Integration & uncheck file assosiation for ISO...

(Also in order to install you have to make sure that your BIOS settings are setup to boot from CD/DVD)"
