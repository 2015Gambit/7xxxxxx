Casey Bill Weldon~The Blues: Slide Guitar Swing 1927-1934~2CD (Fremeaux & Associes) [FLAC] {MKOP}

Among the premier Hawaiian guitarists, Will Casey Bill Weldons voicings, fluidity and tunings were creative and imaginative, as were his arrangements. He was married to Memphis Minnie in the 20s, and they made some superb recordings together in the late 20s. Weldon played in medicine shows before beginning his recording career in 1927 for Victor. There were later dates for Champion, Vocalion and Bluebird. Weldon recorded and played with The Memphis Jug Band, Charlie Burse and the Picaninny Jug Band, and the Brown Bombers of Swing. He moved to the West Coast in the 40s and purportedly recorded for several soundtracks. Weldon moved to Detroit and left the music world in the 60s.~Ron Wynn

A brilliant acoustic slide guitarist who recorded in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Casey Bill Weldon played with his guitar flat on his lap, in what was then 
called Hawaiian style, and his tone and attack differed tremendously from the bottleneck approach of the Delta players. This two-disc collection from the French label Fremeaux gives ample evidence of Weldon's slide wizardry, from the swirling sound he generates on "Flood Water Blues," to the almost contemporary sounding tone he produces on "Way Down In Louisiana." A competent songwriter in the swing blues genre of the day, Weldon's most fully realized composition, "We're Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town," is also collected here.~Steve Leggett (allmusic)
