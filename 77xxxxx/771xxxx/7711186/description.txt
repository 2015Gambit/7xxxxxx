This will be of interest only to a few, but here are some rare and unusual clips
from the production of Richard Williams' unfinished animated masterpiece
"The Thief and the Cobbler."

Nothing amazing here, but you'll see some pencil test material, including deleted
scenes like attempts at scenes between The Enchanted Ogre Prince Bubba and the Witch.

You'll see the creation of a sweeping, turning view flying into the Golden City.

There's an extended early version of the Brigands' scenes.

There's early audio elements from the "Zigzag the Grand Vizier is here" song,
including what seems to be Kenneth Williams and Stanley Baxter as the courtiers.

There's a pretty good copy of the Warner Bros. Marketing Licensing trailer for
the film.

And taking up much of the space, there's scenes that only appear in Fred Calvert's
"The Princess and the Cobbler" edit, and which don't appear in the later "Arabian
Knight" edit of the film, released by Miramax and later the Weinstein Company.
