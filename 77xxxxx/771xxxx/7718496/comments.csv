,ScottyD7421,2012-10-12T15:33Z,"I listened to the whole album and whilst i thought it was great for a debut album i found myself thinking that, with the exception of the last song, it all sounded the same. Even the lead singers pitch stayed pretty much the same right through. In saying that though, i kinda liked the songs. In my humble opinion, i thought it was pretty good.   

Cheers"

,captmorgan19,2012-10-14T03:20Z,"If you liked the late 80's, early 90's  bands like:

Tears For Fears
Duran Duran
Kitchens of Distinction
A-ha

You will like this group."
,TruStarWarsGeek,2012-10-14T03:31Z,"Amazing stuff....I totally feel the ""80's influence"". Thus far, Runaway is my fave and have listened to it several times. Will look for you guys on ITunes...Hope to purchase my favorites there!!!! Thanks guys!"
,StockholmBand,2012-10-14T04:55Z,Thanks for the love guys!! -Stockholm
,TheTaoMan,2012-10-14T09:46Z,"Let us show the greedy corporates how we, the pirates, rob money for the deprived musicians and artists!"
,scootster,2012-10-14T10:51Z,"Great Job, and a great way to get independent music out there!! I applaud both Stockholm and Pirate Bay! Keep up the good work, both of you. The money should go directly to the musicians, pure and simple. This is the future."
,piratebuddha,2012-10-14T14:50Z,"Thank you both, the Pirate Bay and Stockholm, for sharing this with us, I really enjoyed the album. You guys should do everything you can to NOT get signed, follow the Nine Inch Nails/Radiohead model and sell your own shit. The record industry are the real thieves who rob artists of their souls and their profits. Do it yourselves, guys, you're good enough to pull it off!"
,mrnimesh1234567898,2012-10-14T15:56Z,Nice! :D Keep up the good work! ;)
,stirgy1,2012-10-14T16:17Z,"guys - 1st - thanks for the free DL. Awesome of you.

2nd - You are pretty close to getting my vote. but most of this CD is just not my taste. It's Whiny 80's attempted revival that lacks substance. It's perfectly produced and sounds great, but most of the tracks sound like most of the crap that is already out there and it bores the shit out of me.

Now, Interpol did it almost perfect with their ""Bright Lights"" CD. The Ponys have a harder edge, but they got it right. Catherine Wheel - listen to their CD 'Ferment'. American Analog Set's 'Know By Heart' is one of the best revivalist CDs EVER created. The National's 'Boxer' CD, The Go-betweens, Even the Magnetic Fields. check out Yo La Tengo's 'I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One'. Most of these bands have a stand out sound and I think you need to dig a little deeper to find yours.

'Don't Stop Now' is a great song, but I just got bored with the rest of it...

Anyways, sorry for the critic and thanks for the DL!"
,Shaorune,2012-10-14T18:25Z,Awesome!
,AegeanC,2012-10-14T20:13Z,"Thank you so much for uploading your work on PirateBay!!! This is great!!!
And a really amazing cd!!!"
,Lyyki,2012-10-15T23:48Z,"Not bad but way too many songs to be truly a great album.
Well, best tpb-supported album so far!"
,DasRandom,2012-10-16T03:57Z,"I only registered here to comment on this torrent. Absolutely great album, nice lyrics and a BRILLIANT voice! I can listen to this for hours, keep it up, guys!  You are gonna go far if you already are this good. :)"
