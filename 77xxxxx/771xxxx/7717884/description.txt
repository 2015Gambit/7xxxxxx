This time Max and Stacy discuss the very civil lawsuits that are oh so amiable, benevolent, benign, clubby, cordial, courteous and cozy but available only for financial crooks. They also discuss the mysterious algorithm with an unknown motive that accounted for 4% of all quotes on the US stock markets last week. In the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to Jon Najarian of OptionMonster.com about options trading, high frequency trading and naked short selling.
