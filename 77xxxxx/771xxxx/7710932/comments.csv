,iPlunder,2012-10-10T02:37Z,Go study how to release a torrent before you waste any more of our time.
,iPlunder,2012-10-10T02:41Z,"1. Don't shout the title.

2. No version listed.

3. Not an image: No one wants to download  283 individual files!

4. It's free, so what's the point?"
,EKLOL123,2012-10-10T12:59Z,Ok stop it! i get it !  these torrents are my first torrents god damnit! 
,Ztrident,2012-10-10T13:38Z,"Common…Please seed…Everybody knows what Handbrake is…
Plees seed…"
,ClubQBall,2012-10-11T01:09Z,"EKLOL123 - dude, you seriously need to chill the fuck out.  These folks are trying to help your silly ass out ... and then you act like a fucking ass?  If you don't know how to do it ... then fucking RESEARCH it first.  Get what I'm saying?  Don't be a fucking bitch when you get criticized for posting bullshit.  It's just that simple, dude."
,iPlunder,2012-10-11T06:38Z,"Yeah, what he said. ⬆

And don't upload freeware.

As for Ztrident, why are you asking the uploader to seed a broken torrent? And I already said it's freeware, so just go get the damn thing from the developer! Here, I'll make it very simple for you since you seem to need it that way. http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php"
,EKLOL123,2012-10-11T13:00Z,"Ok Im sorry :) happy?
i am chilled its that u guys have to chill too!
plz 
P.S: im new lol"
,Ztrident,2012-10-13T14:46Z,"For iPlunder: I don't know broken or not, nobody seed it, you scared uploader with your stupid lessons. Here not an Appstore. If you need all info in details, go ahead and buy this application. 
EKLOL123, say to some ""smart guys"" f**k off, and do not pay attention...Just do seed, without any pictures etc. 
Thanks to all …"
,EKLOL123,2012-10-14T12:52Z,thanx i guess
,SystemFolder,2012-10-17T08:35Z,"I'm not sure why I would download it from here when I could download it from the developer for free.

Also, to use Handbrake to rip DVDs you'll need to have VLC installed, because Handbrake uses VLCs libraries to decode DVDs."
