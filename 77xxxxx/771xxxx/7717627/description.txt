Christian stops by his next door neighbor Jenni's place to go get a workout together. They made a new year's resolution to help each other stay in shape and when Jenni starts to complain about her day, Christian realizes she needs some motivation. Jenni is very frustrated and refuses to go to the gym......so its up to Christian to help her get a workout right there in her house!
