[T],nosTEAM,2012-10-10T19:03Z,"@ KettoxKun9  - download and install this full game and continue your game  "" Your saved data is not in game folder - if you have played previous episodes you can continue game ."""

Thank you!"

Also, btw, ramulus6, u just need to go the the next chapter, chapter 2, and start it, as long as u finished the previous one, it'll carry ur choices over"
,d_olivaw,2012-11-03T00:58Z,"Yep. I'm having the same problem as ramulus6 and stunner09. I finished Episode 1 and save Carley.
