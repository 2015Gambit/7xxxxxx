,ZoolooCH,2012-10-11T18:00Z,"I don't get why people still download these episodes here. Just watch them for free on the official website. The video quality is the same, and in doing so you support the series by bringing hits to the website."
,WobSawd,2012-10-11T18:30Z,"@ZoolooCH

Not everyone lives in the United States you fucking retard."
,srbtzrtvgsdfbetrtriihjb,2012-10-11T18:45Z,"@ZoolooCH:
the southparkstudios website is accessible only from certain countries. in other countries matt and trey have special contracts with television channels, that prohibit them from making the episodes accessible online. "

,jacobleb420,2012-10-12T03:06Z,"@ZoolooCH

I'm in Canada and the comedy central website doesn't work for me. The same thing with Hulu."
,yerk55,2012-10-12T14:44Z,"@ZoolooCH
Yea depending on what country your IP is from, they restrict the full episode viewing. WobSawd could have explained it a bit nicer."
,torque96,2012-10-12T22:10Z,"@ZoolooCH 
yeah, screw you, zooloo."
,Carlibengarli,2012-10-12T23:21Z,No flame kids! :O
,Pew_Bick,2012-10-13T04:59Z," My name is WobSawd and I live in my parent's basement and flame others on the PirateBay comments section, because I am insecure with myself. I am incapable of a real relationship, so I look at transvestite gay midget porn while I jack-off my dog. "

,mshrmjspr,2012-10-25T09:07Z,"Excellent once again:
Gerald and Sheila's attempt at sexual role-playing turns into widespread panic as every husband in town fears that UPS delivery men are after their wives. Meanwhile, Cartman gets a security system for his house. "
,tflagger997,2012-10-26T22:40Z,"The first 9 episodes this season were pure crap.  Well this one makes up for it!  One of the best episodes in years.

Typical EZTV quality 10/10 (of course)."
,Bootsand,2012-11-08T01:51Z,"@ZoolooCH some episodes are not available on the website for watching due to contractual agreements. Also, there are ads.  Some people just like having them all saved as well."
