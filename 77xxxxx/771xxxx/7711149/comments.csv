xgd3 games cant run of lt 2.0! 
u must update to lt +3.0...dashupdate dont fix the lt problem.and when u have the lt update done...some newer xgd3 games need a dashupdate to run.and u must xgd2 games fix and new burn thats work of lt +3.0...
more infos about it pls use google.and use the abgx tool for easy fixing between lt2.0 & lt+3.0 game isos.
   cheers"

i can play xgd 3 games using topology..i said that every game works, starting with gears of war, max payne, call of duty and lots of them, i said only 3 ask for update, resident evil 6 is an xgd3 game but didn ask for update..so my question again, if i update my dash will i be able to play the old games?"
,quaderquader,2012-10-10T23:36Z,"yep, and if you install the new dash youll be forced to update to 3.0 and then reburn all your cgd 3 games that you patched before with topology for 2.0... same thing happened to me, better do it now, instead of wasting more dls with topology for 2.0.

by the way thank you Alik0, game is quite cool!"
,Assassinprofessor,2012-10-11T00:09Z,"#quaderquader 
you gotta be kidding me..all xgd3 games patched with topology 2.0 wont work on LT 3.0 ? ???"
,quaderquader,2012-10-11T08:32Z,"thats what happened to me, had to trash about 20 discs and reburn them"
