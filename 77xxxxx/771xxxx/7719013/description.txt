After fleeing to Ojai, then Paris, and escaping to London, Josh and Sophie Newman are finally home. And after everything theyΓÇÖve seen and learned in the past week, theyΓÇÖre both more confused than ever about their future. Neither of them has mastered the magics theyΓÇÖll need to protect themselves from the Dark Elders, theyΓÇÖve lost Scatty, and theyΓÇÖre still being pursued by Dr. John Dee. Most disturbing of all, however, is that now they must ask themselves, can they trust Nicholas Flamel? Can they trust anyone?

Today the battle for Danu Talis will be won or lost.

But will the twins of legend stand together?

Or will they stand apartΓÇöone to save the world and one to destroy it?
