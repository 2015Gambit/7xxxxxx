[V],psspss,2012-10-12T08:33Z,"seems to me people that also complain

havent a clue about watching it with VLC

and turning on its real time sharpener.. and slide the
knob to find the sweet spot

I use it all the time .. its like going from blurred vision to eagle eyes..

if watch in media classic it will look rubbish

in fact use vlc with sharpener always on..
really makes a big difference"
