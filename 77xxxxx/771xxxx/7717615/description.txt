Kristian begins to lie, playing his own brother and uses all possible solutions to keep on living the way he lived before - cheating his wife and changing'for one evening in irresistible Don Juan. But is his love to bar lady stronger than to his wife? Is he able to move from usual and (really)boring lifestyle to high class living? How much will his meeting with this amazing woman influent his personal life?

Kristian is one of the best M. Fric's comedies from the 30's and became an icon in picturing 1st republic society in Czech republic. Very softly and sensitively written comedy, which characters are really greatly casted with all the stars of that time (O.Novy, A.Mandlova, N.Gollova etc.). Relaxing and sweet romance.
