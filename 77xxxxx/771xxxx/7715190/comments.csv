,dogoserf,2012-10-11T12:21Z,"Thankyou for another amazing release!

To fix  steam_rld.ini error simply edit that file, go to line 'Player Name' and add your name between speechmarks, do the same also for SKIDROW.ini

Worked perfect so far, actually much better than expected i'm only running an overclocked 1.9mhz (2.2) DC processor with Nvidia 6750M on my notebook, game is smooth enough at reasonable resolution, find it hard to believe min system requirements are 3ghz DC processor & 2.5X faster GPU than what i'm running wazzup with that?"
