Game information
=================

XCOM: Enemy Unknown will place you in  control  of  a  secret  paramilitary
organization called XCOM. As the XCOM commander, you will defend against  a
terrifying  global  alien  invasion  by  managing  resources,  advancing
technologies,  and  overseeing  combat  strategies  and  individual  unit

invasion story, enemies and technologies to fight aliens and defend Earth

technologies, creating and managing  a  fully  operational  base,  planning
