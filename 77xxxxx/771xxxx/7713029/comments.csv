,wabbitman,2012-10-10T11:31Z,"Probably a stupid question, but how do I ""block the game.exe"" in my firewall in Windows 7? "
,severni.pol,2012-10-10T12:33Z,MSVCR100.DLL and MSVCP100.DLL problems. Does anyone know hot to fix it? I downloaded these from web but its still not working. Thanks (3DM+FLT crack)
,severni.pol,2012-10-10T12:39Z,"-Wabbitman> go to your firewall and set the New Rule form outgoing connection, find the exe file and confirm. "
,wabbitman,2012-10-10T12:55Z,"severni> Sweet, thanks. Sorry I can't help with your problem. (Haven't actually installed the game yet, I don't know if I'll get the same error.)"
,hemiman,2012-10-10T17:17Z,"Works like a charm here , language is english here
Tnx Tikasukaz / FLT"
,Saalis87,2012-10-10T21:28Z,Works!!!
,MikeSSSK,2012-10-10T21:32Z,"It is saying to burn or mount, but there is no .iso or mountable file? How do you actually start the installation? "
,MikeSSSK,2012-10-10T21:43Z,"Ignore the above, still nothing to burn or mount but my biggest problem was I had to UPDATE my DIRECT X. After that copy the binaries file to your original game then run the XCOM file in the binaries and you should be good. "

,nazgull2k10,2012-10-11T17:04Z,Works perfectly!  Thanks Tik!
,gammaquarto,2012-10-12T01:44Z,"A bit of a noob question, and probably a FAQ for Steam-activated games but I have the retail game and am having endless hassles getting it installed with only a dialup-speed connection to Steam.

How do I install the game off the DVDs with the minimum of online grief?

,viperman5686,2012-10-12T06:24Z,All that happens when I try to run the game is Steam opens.  Even when I run as administrator.

,gammaquarto,2012-10-12T12:38Z,"Typhoon2000, read what I wrote, you ignorant snotty brat.  I did buy it, and now I want to use the crack on it, but cannot get it installed without the update starting automatically, and on my connection the update is going to take over a month."

,Typhoon2000,2012-10-12T16:13Z,gammaquarto I actually read your comment and wasn't even referring to you. You must have had a hard youth if you always think that people talk about you.
,4331a,2012-10-12T21:57Z,"Patch, anyone?"
,IQ98,2012-10-14T10:15Z,"The game still Freezes alot. 

When I installed the game fresh I could play 1 hour whit out freezes. Now it freeze alot."
,LamehTheDark,2012-10-14T11:12Z,"Hey all! Done like told. Unrar the game, then copy over original Binaries folder this one, installed the new DirectX included with the game torrent but starting the XComGame.exe or the other exec file with the same name pops up in a splitsecond this message:

""Missing MSVCR100.dll, reinstalling the program could solve this problem.""

Did anyone else get this message? I have done the Firewall blocking in Windows Firewall as well... I am not sure what the problem could be. I have refreshed my NVIDIA driver too. Any idea anyone? I would not mind buying it either if it is that good as it is said, but I am afraid I wouldn't get the original working either if this doesn't. I have Vista Ultimate 32, Geforce 9800GTX+, 3Ghz Intel, all recent games are running fine but this one.
Please help/suggest somethin if you could/would! :)"
,nogames10,2012-10-14T13:35Z,"I'm having a really odd error. The game loads fine, no errors, but when i click new game, and get into the difficulty screen, Nothing works? I can click all the buttons, change difficulty, choose tutorial or ironman, but i cant start a game. it makes the noise as if i pressed the button but it does nothing. Every other part of it works though."
,nytstalk,2012-10-15T01:39Z,"@LamehTheDark

This is easy to solve, just grab the dll here: http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr100

And the game will probably ask for MSVCP100 as well, which is in here:
http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcp100

Just put both dlls in the ""binaries/Win32"" paste, together with the main .exe file (xcomgame.exe)"

,Seltzer30,2012-11-08T18:40Z,"Hello,
I dont know if anyone else is experiencing this. During the Tutorial and when it prompts you to Mission screen, I can no longer use Escape button or click on the bottom left arrow. That means that I am stuck on that screen and can only move time forward for some event.
Any ideas why that happens?
I installed the update as mentioned."
