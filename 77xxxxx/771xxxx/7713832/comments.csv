,markofbear,2012-10-10T15:18Z,"Always trusted your ups T.F.K, but just out of curiosity, how come this one is about 5 gigs while the others are 12? Is it just super packed or is something ripped?"
[T],T.F.K,2012-10-10T15:21Z,Yes
[T],T.F.K,2012-10-10T15:24Z,"All languages are removed,only the ENG is remained,because of that is 5gigs :)"
,snajam,2012-10-10T15:27Z,Why is the size so small?
,snajam,2012-10-10T15:27Z,oh the languages!
,meller14,2012-10-10T15:36Z,"haha you guys need te read things before u ask the same question ;)

THNX T.F.K
"
,markofbear,2012-10-10T15:58Z,Thanks for the fast info T.F.K! Im sure it will work flawlessly as soon as a crack is released :)
,jankula,2012-10-10T16:06Z,"Thx a lot T.F.K team for repack,less size same pleasure,but windows xp not supported!I need w7 reinstall!"
,PHDIKOULAS,2012-10-10T16:37Z,"i came

,usogon,2012-10-10T16:56Z,doesnt work =_= 
,PHDIKOULAS,2012-10-10T17:06Z,"what crack does this use?working or not

someone confirm "
,Gilisar,2012-10-10T17:10Z,"yep not worth the hassle to D/L
crashes every time on start up on win7 64bit anyhow."
,Gilisar,2012-10-10T17:32Z,I can confirm what Usogon says... Torrent is non functional. Thank you for upload though T.F.K. But sadly it is worthless
[T],T.F.K,2012-10-10T17:50Z,"If this don't work,download crack fix only,then try.We do not know how it does not work.."
,Brooce,2012-10-10T17:59Z,"Windows7 64bit here as well, and I'm also getting the crashes. Eh."
,Nezerathian,2012-10-10T18:19Z,Where we can get the crack fix only?
,In_Da_Club,2012-10-10T18:25Z,"Same here, win7 64bit crashes when i launch the game :(
On the good side download went pretty fast."
,Dimmis80,2012-10-10T18:26Z,Yeah to bad that its crashing every time.!!I have win7/64 and the same problem with u guys.!!I used the Fairlight crack but i have the same problem.!So T.F.K any help mate.!!??
,Nezerathian,2012-10-10T18:26Z,Win 7 x64 crash. When there will be hotfix or link to it? 
,In_Da_Club,2012-10-10T18:28Z,btw i tried FLT crack only as well but still it doesnt work.
,Brooce,2012-10-10T18:41Z,"Yeah, I tried the FLT crack as well. Still crashes on startup. TFK, did you test the game after you repacked it? Also, if you tested it on your end and it worked, do you have Win7 x64 or x32? Maybe it's a x64 bit OS problem, missing some required files or something."
[T],T.F.K,2012-10-10T18:52Z,"We see now,wait for crack fix,FLT made a mistake when release crack,new crack will be uploaded to night or tomorrow. T.F.K team"
[T],T.F.K,2012-10-10T18:54Z,"@Brooce
We have win7 64x,we working now with this problem,we will try to fix it."
,r46u50r1n,2012-10-10T18:55Z,win7 x64 not working
,erapara,2012-10-10T19:29Z,"T.F.K. - I checked the error log and did some poking around with procmon. It fails with a message stating that the Core package is missing.

I checked the XComGameCookedPCConsole directory and found that only the file Core.upk.uncompressed_size is present. From a quick check in that directory, it is not the only file that is missing in the same manner. Perhaps this is the missing files?"
,Brooce,2012-10-10T19:29Z,"Wait, FLT made the mistake? How? Because people are using the 3DM, Unlocked and FLT versions of XCOM with the FLT crack and they aren't getting any startup crashes. And none of the release trackers list the crack as being nuked...

From what I can see, this is the only XCOM torrent that crashes to desktop before you can even start the game. I don't want to sound ungrateful for a free torrent that you took the time to repack, but I don't get what you're saying..."
[T],T.F.K,2012-10-10T19:37Z,"This is full version:http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7713688/_XCOM_Enemy_Unknown-FLT

We took about 6 hours to repack the game,and is very difficult,sorry for crashing.

@erapara maybe :/"
,jimmymkd,2012-10-10T20:11Z,does it work on win7 32bit? or it crashes too!!
,PastorFahlbrg,2012-10-10T20:42Z,"I've tried two torrents now and none work, my OS is Win7 64-bit... Soo I guess there ain't nuthing wrong with the torrents since it seems like most of us who encounter problem are running 64-bit. My bet is on some audio incompability, hope we get a fix soon!"
,bobthepedo,2012-10-10T20:55Z,So is their any chance that this torrent is playable or does it simply not work?
,jimmymkd,2012-10-10T21:01Z,can some1 confirm is this works on win7 32bit??
,zadukenz,2012-10-10T21:05Z,"doesn't work on win7x64, will try with the full version..."
,Warbuxx,2012-10-10T21:30Z,"Thanks for all the effort T.F.K, you do god's work.

anyway I wish I could make out the text on your installer, but overall a minor thing compared to the excellent repacks you guys do."
,darkrage14,2012-10-10T22:18Z,Has ANYONE gotten this to work?
,darkgamerX,2012-10-11T01:06Z,crashes every time i click the exe
,.k3,2012-10-11T01:26Z,"I looked around a bit and found that the uncompressed files in CoockedPCConsole are
Cure.upk
Engine.upk
GameFramework.upk
GFxUI.upk
IpDrv.upk
OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.upk
Startup.upk
Startup_LOC_INT.upk
XComGame.upk
XComGame_LOC_INT.upk
XComStrategyGame.upk

So if anybody could upload those files to a filehosting site, it might work. But I have no idea how big these files would be."
,Brooce,2012-10-11T01:46Z,"I just finished downloading and installing the full release. It works fine on Win7 x64.

@.k3

I can do that. I think most of those are only a few mb's. I'll check now."
,Brooce,2012-10-11T01:58Z,"Done. There is no ""Cure.upk"" in the full release, but all the other files you requested are there. I included both the .upk and .uncompressed_size files just in case, all up its only 8 megs compressed as well.

Go to uploading(.)com and paste this after (TPB wont let me paste the full link...) :

/files/get/88b48952/Missing_Files.rar"
,Brooce,2012-10-11T02:00Z,.
,Shandy429,2012-10-11T02:08Z,"I'm having the crash on start up, and i noticed that during the install it jumped from like ~50% to ~90% and its unpacked size is only 8.38Gb instead of proposed 13Gb... So is it just the 64bit systems that are doing this?

@.k3, i think your on to it, hopefully that is the extent of the missing files."
,.k3,2012-10-11T02:12Z,"thanks Brooce, dling now. and will report back with findings."
,.k3,2012-10-11T02:14Z,"Oh and the cure.upk was a typo. it was supposed to be Core.upk

hehe ="
,Shandy429,2012-10-11T02:17Z,is it possible the problem is in the installer? given that during my install it skipped over about 30% of the install.
,.k3,2012-10-11T02:25Z,"Yes, it's quite likely the fault is with the installer or something in the compression algorithm caused some files to screw up. 
the files that Brooce uploaded didn't make a difference, but I can't yet be sure since I don't have Core.upk."
,Kaina4th,2012-10-11T02:30Z,"just tried it with the missing files pack from brooce and the install log now says core.upk is missing.
thats a different error then before i think we are on the right way
plz upload this file too hopefully it will work then"
,.k3,2012-10-11T02:37Z,"that is very interesting Kaina4th, because I did not notice any difference in the error. I'm going to try reinstalling to see if maybe I messed up some of my files after that."
,Brooce,2012-10-11T02:42Z,"Here you go! : 

uploading(.)com

/files/get/885ee1f1/Core_Upk.rar"
,Kaina4th,2012-10-11T02:42Z,"the error is the same i believe.
take a look into: DocumentsMy GamesXCOM - Enemy UnknownXComGameLogs
there you will find the installation logs with more specific information"
,rod_ff,2012-10-11T02:52Z,I coulndÂ´t find the files in the site
,Shandy429,2012-10-11T02:55Z,"Tried a reinstall after adding the missing file DL, no change there's at least 3Gb worth of data that hasn't unpacked... Is there anyway of extracting the .bin files without the setup .exe, I'm not that tech savy."
,.k3,2012-10-11T02:58Z,"Thanks again to Brooce, but even with the Core.upk it's no dice.

This is a very peculiar error, since it acknowledges the fact that it's dealing with a 64bit system (trying to find kernelbase.dll in syswow64 not system32) yet the addresses it searches are totally wrong.

I think I'm going to leave this alone for tonight and get some sleep."
,Kaina4th,2012-10-11T03:03Z,"in the XComGame/CookedPCConsole direction has to be a file named:
GlobalShaderPatch-PC-D3D-SM3.gsm
the new error says its corrupted i looked into the folder and the ending is .bin
if you got this file with the.gsm ending can you please upload it brooce? "
,Brooce,2012-10-11T03:28Z,"There's no GlobalShaderPatch-PC-D3D-SM3.gsm file.

How many files do you guys have listed in CookedPCConsole? The working version has 2,486, total size 3.91gb. I suspect you're missing lots of them or that some are corrupted. Might be best to wait till TFK uploads a proper fix, or maybe just get the full torrent..."
,Kaina4th,2012-10-11T03:36Z,"there are 1.92gb and 875 files in CookedPCConsole...
but in the full version there are also some Localization folders inside so its logical that there are less files then in the repack.
you are right we should wait for t.f.k to fix this. 
anyway thanks for uploading the files"
,Shandy429,2012-10-11T03:42Z,"CookedPCConsole has 866 files at 1.91Gb (yeah like 4Gb missing all up)... i cant see this being fixed anytime soon, unless some one can trick the setup.exe to think its running on a 32 bit system but I'm pretty sure that's impossible."
,Shandy429,2012-10-11T03:43Z,same as Kaina4th with added files.
,Dimmis80,2012-10-11T08:11Z,"Well for me with Win 7/64 this torrent not working but i use this torrent and its working very fine with the Fairlight crack..Just unzip and copy/paste the crack to the proper folder ""Binaries"".http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7709811/XCOM__Enemy_Unknown-FULL_UNLOCKED"
,barryquest,2012-10-11T08:59Z,"I installed 32 bit Win 7 just to try this.
Doesnt work!"
,PHDIKOULAS,2012-10-11T10:38Z,good speed but torrent aint working
,PastorFahlbrg,2012-10-11T11:08Z,"Wow, way to go guys! I never thought we would resolve this, seems like we're truly on our way :3 "
,xan3mk,2012-10-11T11:54Z,"The issue with the torrent is probably the setup which is not compiled properly. During the installation it skips a huge amount of files, jumping from ~30% to 90%.

However, the .bat files are actually .arc archives when the extension is changed from .bat > .arc, but they are password protected.
If T.F.K. would be kind enough to provide us with the password, we could try to manually unpack the files and see if there are still issues."
,PastorFahlbrg,2012-10-11T18:08Z,"Fuck it, I bought the damn thing instead! Steam had a great deal, free DLC and Civ 5 ^^"
,PHDIKOULAS,2012-10-11T18:52Z,"@PastorFahlbrg 

enjoy your buggy game son

we will dl it and in case you didnt notice this does have the dlc

enjoy giving your money son"
,8orkie8,2012-10-11T19:25Z,isn' it posible repack it again with this files and upload only setup.exe?
,anonyboy,2012-10-11T19:36Z,"Why is this so well seeded if it's broken?

I just downloaded this for the DLC. FLT's version doesn't have it, and for some reason I can't find the DLC available alone."
,muff1nman,2012-10-12T12:03Z,The installer was all in weird symbols and shit. It completed but I'm missing quite a few files from the cookedpcconsole folder. Reinstalled and it skipped from 32%~ to 91%. I think this is all just a problem with the installer and we'll probably need a fix uploaded.
,xDownSetx,2012-10-13T02:07Z,"This is the best torrent I've found for XCOM:ET so far.  Others are saturated with peers but I got a solid 1MB/s from this one.  

I'm using W7 64bit with all current updates and it's working great for me.  3 hours in and zero crashes/glitches."
,rccola70,2012-10-13T05:46Z,"FIX THAT WORKED FOR ME:

Rename setup-1.bin to setup-2.bin and setup-2.bin to setup-1.bin.

To double check:
setup-1.bin should be the one that is ~506,000 KB
setup-2.bin should be the one that is ~1,427,000 KB 

Then reinstall"
,muff1nman,2012-10-13T06:38Z,Thanks rccola reinstalling now will post if it works for me. Setup 2 was the smaller file so I'm hoping it does. Install is long as shit so in the meantime going to go have a smoke.
,muff1nman,2012-10-13T06:54Z,rccola's fix worked. Thanks a lot man.
,muff1nman,2012-10-13T07:23Z,Alright well the fix did work. The game got installed and running properly but now I have a problem with lighting. Outside of cutscenes the lighting is broken. I can see light sources but they provide zero light. Everything is almost entirely pitch black.
,zomgilost,2012-10-13T07:57Z,"yeah rccola's fix worked. However, i noticed the following

1. install progress still jumps from 35% to 90%
2. and yeah. Gamma is broken. sliding gamma all the way to the right and still the left icon is still invisible"
,rccola70,2012-10-13T09:45Z,I got the lighting glitch at first too. I reinstalled and it seemed to work. Maybe also try reinstalling directX or the game again. Now my game plays fine after I install on another hard drive.
,FiXcom,2012-10-13T13:32Z,"Renamed the discs, installed it, started it - no lights.
Installed directx and others - nothing
Reinstalled game half a dozen times, still no lights."
,FiXcom,2012-10-13T14:03Z,"Tried to install on a different drive but still nothing

Win7 32bit
ati card, latest driver"
,zomgilost,2012-10-13T14:04Z,"what I'll do is i will install it in order. afterwards i will rename setup bin 2, 3, 4 and 5 to setup bin 1 so that theoretically all files will be installed. do not cancel reinstallation since it will delete the folder"
,ekefaca,2012-10-13T14:39Z,"So here is the win combination :P

setup-1 506mb
setup-2 1030 mb
setup-3 1427 mb
setup-4 2504 mb
setup-5 139 mb

This worked for me :P"
,Andrej27,2012-10-13T15:06Z,ekefaca s way works (smallest -> largest - 5->-1->2->3->4)
,zomgilost,2012-10-13T15:08Z,LOL I'll try that out. Are we playing lottery here? :-D
,muff1nman,2012-10-13T15:19Z,ekefaca did you previously have the lighting bug and that fixed it? Cause I'm trying it now. rccola reinstalled again and still getting the bug. Just moved and don't have usb for my external yet or I'd try that. FiXcom (I really hope you notice how hilarious your name is in this situation and that you didn't make it just for this) I'm using an Nvidia and Win 7 64bit so it shouldn't be a hardware or OS problem.
,zomgilost,2012-10-13T15:22Z,ZOMG looks like ekefaca's lottery fixes the lighting issues!
,Tropilm,2012-10-13T15:27Z,Anyone know how I can get the DLC to work in a legit copy of the game?
,muff1nman,2012-10-13T15:28Z,ekefaca I'll suck your dick (No homo) It worked fukyeh. Gonna play me some X Com finally.
,FiXcom,2012-10-13T15:39Z,"THANK YOU EKEFACA, it finally works!"
,ekefaca,2012-10-13T16:40Z,your welcome
,zomgilost,2012-10-13T18:50Z,thanks ekefaca! we'll all suck your balls :-p
,zadukenz,2012-10-13T19:51Z,posting to see comments
,Deermud,2012-10-14T20:13Z,Can someone upload the DLC only ? I got the FLT already and don't want to reinstall the whole game for a small dlc.
,ragepyre,2012-10-15T10:37Z,"it dont have the opening movie, skipping"
,streak007,2012-10-17T13:30Z,whats the final size after installation
,Unit3,2012-10-18T23:04Z,Thanks T.F.K! Works very nicely if you change the files as ekefaca posted. Suck u long time!
,Raigeki1091,2012-10-24T12:45Z,mine wont work T_T
,DragonCaesar,2012-10-28T06:07Z,is there any possibility that this version can be updated?
,AnuubianMonk,2012-10-31T22:22Z,"1.5 download, thanks seeders! will return the favor"
