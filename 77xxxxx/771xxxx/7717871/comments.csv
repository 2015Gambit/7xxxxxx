A/V sync problems. Has rip/encoding issues. May be correctable using VLC's manual sync controls. Very thankful anyway to get a free look at this interesting animation."

There is a slight gap between audio and video (in milliseconds) that doesn't cause any problem.
Movie played smoothly on my VLC."
