Kortney has gone through a terrible breakup and she is just now beginning to date again. Her best friend Jenni is there to console her and offer her reassurance. Kortney is very nervous and she is scared that her date might try to kiss her. Jenni laughs, and says, a kiss is a kiss. You should maybe practice just in case. Kortney smiles, and remembers the good times the girls had back in college. She leans in and they kiss passionately. The two girls are into each other hot and heavy, and just then Jenni's boyfriend Justice comes home. He wants to join in on the action, and Kortney is game for a threesome.
