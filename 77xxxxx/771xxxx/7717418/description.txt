XCOM: Enemy Unknown will place you in control of a secret paramilitary
organisation called XCOM. As the XCOM commander, you will defend against a
terrifying global alien invasion by managing resources, advancing
technologies, and overseeing combat strategies and individual unit tactics.

The original X-COM is widely regarded as one of the best games ever made
and has now been re-imagined by the strategy experts at Firaxis Games.
XCOM: Enemy Unknown will expand on that legacy with an entirely new
invasion story, enemies and technologies to fight aliens and defend Earth.
You will control the fate of the human race through researching alien
technologies, creating and managing a fully operational base, planning
combat missions and controlling soldier movement in battle.
