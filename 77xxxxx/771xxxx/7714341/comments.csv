The keygen is safe i used it on a trail copy i had installed for ages and it worked just fine"
,CrispyVictim,2012-10-11T23:20Z,It's rar'd...  WHY!?!?
,malthus,2012-10-14T19:00Z,"Seriously. Why did it take the FOURTH comment to point out that you can't install the software unless you already have the software installed? Who rar's WinRar installer??? It's so ridiculous, I'm not even annoyed, it's comical. LoL"
,thoinfocam,2012-10-16T17:08Z,"Working great. AVG considers Keygen as virus, please keep it safe. Thanks"
,Normalcy,2012-10-26T19:41Z,"Ahahaha it's a WinRAR installer in a .rar

What was he thinking? >_"
,mbsa,2012-11-04T09:14Z,Thanks!
,cernwulf,2012-11-04T17:52Z,"You can extract this with 7-Zip, which is free and personally my favourite compression software. I use WinRAR as a backup."
,kolopiratebay,2012-11-05T15:59Z,Guy.....are you fucking retarded??? Open WinRAR with WinRAR? Have mommy take you to see a professional!
,BigBillyBob,2012-11-12T05:15Z,"No viruses.

Only problem...  How were we supposed to un-rar without WinRAR, in which we're downloading this...  So we can un-rar rar's???????"
,JohnHolmesII,2012-11-15T07:40Z,"Guys, download the trial from WinRAR's website. It works without activation for quite some time. Then use the keygen. Try not to herp all over yourselves."
,RickUnnis,2012-11-23T11:29Z,All these guys do is re-up other peoples work. Like there isn't Winrar 4.20 and a keygen already posted several times???
