,solutioN-Ghost,2012-10-18T21:04Z,"Thank You so much!!

NOTE: I was browsing through your torrents and I remember downloading your Death Note torrent but it contains many glitches and freezes. You said last March, and I quote : 

""IMPORTANT NOTE: Death will be uploaded again (probably in English Subbed) in 720p quality. Not full HD because there's no HD source for it. But, it will be upscaled and videos will be kept at a better quality. And, no more FREEZES ans GLITCHES!!! Meanwhile...enjoy the other HD animes uploaded. :)""

Until now you haven't upload it and I'm still waiting for it, I'm not demanding but I'm a fan of Death Note, Naruto and One Piece :'( I do hope you will upload Death Note and Naruto, thank you."
