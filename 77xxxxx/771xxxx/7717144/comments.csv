@keeybee: I'm not tapping on your fingers... I'm just helping others to have this burned properly. There were too many NOP's in VTSM 1, PGC 8 and some more minor fixes... Hope you don't mind...

[T],keeybee,2012-10-13T02:14Z,"@ Lindoffs: To be honest, I donÂ´t have a clue what NOP's, VTSM 1 and PGC means or why they are important. But if there was a problem and your fix is the solution; Thank you very much for the help. 
I just want people to be able to burn the things I up load as easy as possible. "
