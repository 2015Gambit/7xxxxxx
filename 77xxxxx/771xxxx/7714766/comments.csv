,jasoncraig_74,2012-11-14T15:31Z,"well for 20 years theres never been a consistent run on the art, new owners to the book required a new history and a character change, had to draw it to fit the new story line, No Lady Death, means Ernie has a new creator inside the story and that changed everything

we had fun doing the book-issue 2 and 3 really speed things up and 4 pushes boundaries "
