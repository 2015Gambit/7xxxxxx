I didn't rip these discs.They were m4a's that i converted to mp3.I'm posting this as a favor for AjaO.I'm not sure if all the songs are labeled right but i am sure this isn't the entire discography,there's an album called Kicked In The Teeth Again.I found it somewhere else but I don't have it anymore.





If you don't seed,who will?!?!?!?!??!?
