Daffy coaches Gossamer's water polo team despite having no experience or
discernible skill for the job. Meanwhile, Bugs becomes addicted to Porky's
unhealthy, butter-loaded catering ΓÇª and pays the price. Plus, in the Merrie
Melodies "Laser Beam," Marvin the Martian's beloved laser cannon ceases
