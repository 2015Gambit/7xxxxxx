Visions of Europe
Visions of Europe is a collection of sixteen episodes of Visions series, originally aired on Public Television and previously released in a ten disc boxed set in October of 2010. This collection includes the cities and countryside in places such as; Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Greece, and many Great Cities in the rest of Europe. The filming was done on helicopter mounted high-definition cameras. The result is some of the most beautiful looks at Europe that can be seen without leaving your home. The aerial views are amazing, giving you glimpses of the popular destinations that cannot be seen from the ground. Whether highlighting the vast untouched natural destinations, such as mountain ranges, lakes, and rivers, or the cities that are mixtures of old and new architecture, the episodes give breathtaking views. Even if you have been to some of the destinations, you will love to see them from the air. It gives the landscape a whole new look.




8)  Sicily 
Visions of Sicily is a guided tour physically impossible by any other means, informed by a narrative as richly textured as the island's rocky crags and set to a soundtrack distinctly Sicilian in its variety. From ancient fishing ports to modern autostradas, the helicopter surveys all that Sicily was and has become. Join us for a seamless tour marked by blankets of lush green, terracotta rooftops, azure waters, and the seductive haze of volcanic craters. Striking views - from as high as 3,250 ft above sea level - showcase Cefalu, Palermo, Termini Imerse,Trapani, Marsala, Agrigento, Siracusa, Catania, Taormina, Mount Etna and more
