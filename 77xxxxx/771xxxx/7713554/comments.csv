PC on all night and still on 37%. (4.6GB) downloaded and 4.06GB uploaded. This is really not normal....
Guess you´re right DrAmac84, by this rate it should be complete only on Saturday or Sunday. :(

I ask again to everyone, dont set uploads only to 1k or 5k. 

Thanks! Hopefully the game is worth it. I played the demo and wasnt totally convinced cause the original version still rocks with its simplicity and low graphics. New games unfortunately tend to complicate things and forget the most important aspect, GAMEPLAY! Not only graphics that take 12GB on the hard drive! :D

These ones still rock!!!!

Xcom (1994)
X-COM: Terror from the Deep (1995)


Why on this new version we cant set a base wherever we want? Dont really get it!
Hopefully after 2 or 3 missions i will not get bored of it.

I agree, I play x-com 1 and xcom apoc last couple of days, and after I got used to extreme pixellesation I remembered just how deep and engaging the original games were. I hope the devs at Firaxis managed to capture some of that greatness. 

P.S. I think you can setup your base wherever you want. Among the several positions that are offered, that is. Didn't play the demo, dunno if there are multiple offered starting positions there"

,Afinfas,2012-10-11T16:43Z,"@DrAmac84

SPOILER!!!

I played demo (and read some reviews) and you only can choose the locations they give you. At beggining you have 2 choices, USA or China. For what i read on the review you cant build any other base like it used to happen with the original XCOM. :(

Probably tonight the game is fully downloaded. I left PC on once again and when i left home was on 42% and downloading at 200k but dropping to 80k sometimes raising to 400k,bla,bla..... :)

And now back to topic: :)
I know some guys who downloaded already and...
100% WORKING TORRENT!!!!

I downloaded patch and installed it and then downloaded your rar and put into right directory and now I have error:
unknown software exception(...)
is there any way to make this game work ? I would like it very much but it seems that odds are against me whenever I try"

,Dejakritz2,2012-11-01T23:58Z,"I can't get this working on XP. After installing the game, installing the patch, and then placing the XP fix files linked by stigmatix in the directory together with the exe. It either just sits there with using a reported 60-70k of memory in the task manager, or it says the game has encountered an error and needs to close. I ran the directx setup and VCRedist, no change. Steam does not start or anything like other users reported. It just doesn't run."

,2col4,2012-11-03T02:04Z,"hey i got a problem with the game and hoped some of you could help.
I first installed it and played for an hour and everything went fine. Then i saved and when i started the game again i could not move my mouse, it was stuck in the top left corner. I can not get it to work again, i'm playing on a laptop and have no joysticks or something else plugged in just a usb mouse.
I hope someone might have an answer^^
cheerio"
,spystyle,2012-11-03T08:17Z,"This worked perfectly on Win7, just install and play, block with firewall (or disable internet). Really interesting game for players of the old XCOM."
,isnogood99,2012-11-03T13:42Z,"great game, works like a charm... thanks for the upload"
,matveev.sergeev,2012-11-07T14:56Z,"Been waiting so long for that one to finally come out...

,Seltzer30,2012-11-08T18:43Z,"Hello,
I dont know if anyone else is experiencing this. During the Tutorial and when it prompts you to Mission screen, I can no longer use Escape button or click on the bottom left arrow. That means that I am stuck on that screen and can only move time forward for some event.
Any ideas why that happens?
I installed the update as mentioned."
