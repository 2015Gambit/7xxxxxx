Mondo (2012)




The witty, funky pop duo Electric Guest feature Asa Taccone (brother of Lonely Island's Jorma Taccone) and Matthew Compton. While Taccone helped his brother and fellow Lonely Islanders Andy Samberg and Akiva Schaffer produce hits like "Dick in a Box," he found his true collaborator in Compton, whom he met while they were sharing a house in Los Angeles that included Taccone's old friend Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse, as a former resident. While working on Saturday Night Live-affiliated projects such as the Lonely Island songs and the soundtracks to the films Hot Rod and MacGruber, Taccone and Compton also worked on Electric Guest's debut album with Burton, a process that took over six years. The duo's mix of funk, soul, soft rock, disco, and pop came to fruition with Mondo, which arrived in April 2012.
