I Follow Rivers is a song by Swedish recording artist Lykke Li from her second studio album, Wounded Rhymes (2011). The Belgian band Triggerfinger covered "I Follow Rivers" on the Dutch radio channel 3FM in what was called "a fragile version". Curiously they used glasses, cups and knives to create a rhythmical background section.
