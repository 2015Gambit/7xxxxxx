1.install cFosSpeed.8.03.2000.
2.go to installation dir and then right click on cfosspeed.exe and UnCkeck Read-only.
3.Stop program in Task manager. Disable anti-virus.
3.run the patch and click on crack button.

PS - When I put the mouse over the tray icon it says "" Bad Password""
Is this normal?"
