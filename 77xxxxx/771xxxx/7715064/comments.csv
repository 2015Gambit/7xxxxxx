Take a look at this one:

That's how its done. And read the comment...

Music = information
You can not make information magically appear out of a 16/44 master."

The fact remains that the Gish album he uploaded would not be here right now if I hadn't uploaded this one. I am really glad that I did it.

Does music = information? I didn't really catch that from all the times you told me. Maybe if you tell me a few more times..."
,beavis39,2012-10-12T02:38Z,"Found out he posted Siamese Dream as well. The download hasn't completely finished but 5 of the 13 tracks finished so I was able to compare those versus my own 24/96 ones.

Apart from being louder I don't think they sound at all better than mine. To each his own I guess. Mine hold up pretty well against them, they just aren't as loud."

And yeah,I uploaded siamese dream before gish.
