Information
------------------------------

It was called the political scandal of the century, threatening the very roots of our constitutional democracy. Even today, the release of files and new revelations by the original players alter the facts and the landscape. Could Deep Throat have been an FBI agent? How much did the President know? Time has not diminished the thrill and mystery that surround these extraordinary historical events. Relive history in the words of the perpetrators themselves.
