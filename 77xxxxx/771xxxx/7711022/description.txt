Plot: Rod and Katherine Wright are enjoying their retirement in Florida – or so theyâ™re telling each other. Actually, Rodâ™s been bored with nothing to do, and Katherine misses her kids back home, especially with Christmas right around the corner. At least theyâ™ve made friends with their new neighbor Lisa, whoâ™s a golden retriever fan like them – Rod and Katherineâ™s dog Jake has three new puppy playmates, Mario, Luigi and Pasquale. But when Jake and the puppies take off during a walk with Lisa and interrupt a wedding proposal, Lisa is mortified to discover the proposer is none other than her lifelong-friend-turned-boyfriend-turned-ex, David. Everyone can see that David and Lisa are meant to be together. Everyone, that is, except for David and Lisa. Now, with Davidâ™s wedding approaching, they must decide whether to leave their love in the past, or to give it another chance. With a little help from Rod and Katherine and four lovable pups, itâ™s sure to be a Christmas to remember.
