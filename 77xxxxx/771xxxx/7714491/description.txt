Tixati is a slick and fast torrent program authored by the architect of the WinMiX OpenNap program.  Definitely a sophisticated and forward-thinking client, Tixati is already embracing the shift towards trackerless torrent swarming:  magnet links, PEX, and DHT swarming works very well in Tixati.  The throttling features and wide range of priority adjustments will make any fussy P2P user quite happy, and you'll find that download speeds are at least as fast as Vuze and uTorrent.  The bitfield graphs and 'executive dashboard' display is very professional, and this product easily earns itself a spot amongst the best torrent clients today.  Definitely try Tixati for torrent P2P needs.
