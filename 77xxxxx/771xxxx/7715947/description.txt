How can you talk about something you canΓÇÖt remember?

Before the ski trip, sixteen-year-old Cassidy ΓÇ£SidΓÇ¥ Murphy was a cheerleader (at the bottom of the pyramid, but still...), a straight-A student, and a member of a solid trio of best friends. When she ends up on a ski lift next to handsome local college boy, Dax Windsor, sheΓÇÖs thrilled; but Dax takes everything from SidΓÇöincluding a lock of her perfect red curlsΓÇöand she canΓÇÖt remember any of it.

Back home and unable to relate to her old friends, Sid drops her college prep classes and takes up residence in the A/V room with only Corey ΓÇ£The Living StonerΓÇ¥ Livingston for company. But as she gets to know Corey (slacker, baker, total dreamboat), Sid finds someone who truly makes her happy. Now, if she can just shake the nightmares and those few extra pounds, everything will be perfect... or so she thinks.

Witty and poignant, Colleen ClaytonΓÇÖs stunning debut is a story about moving on after the unthinkable happens.
