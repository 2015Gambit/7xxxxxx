,pubicoption,2012-10-19T21:20Z,"Supplied keygen is completely useless. Outputs ""activation code"" that is 8 digits too long, and can't be copied from or pasted to anyway. Install instructions are out of date also.

Don't waste your time with this crap."

,beloit020,2012-11-08T19:33Z,"@JonteOabu I'm having similar issues to @pubicoption concerning the output of the activation code, it's not taking. No copy & paste either, though I'm unsure if that's supposed to be a feature anyhow.
Could you advise. Cheers for the work. "
