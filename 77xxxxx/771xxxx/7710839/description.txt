Based on award winning forensic technology,
Adroit allows for maximum photo recovery.
With an easy-to-use interface and
SmartCarving which recovers 15-20% more
photos, Adroit takes photo recovery to a
whole new level. It can recover deleted
photos from internal and external hard
drives, USB sticks, memory cards, digital
cameras, and disk images in three easy
steps. Simply point and click the drive
or memory card to recover from and Adroit
takes care of the rest. Detects
accidentally formatted drives and memory
cards automatically and tunes the recovery
engine appropriately. During recovery,
thumbnails of recovered photos stream
through the screen.


Usage: Unpack, install, copy the dll file
from Crack folder
