,traypalazax,2012-10-20T02:42Z,"hey every body. What gives with this game and windows 7 ultimate? Every version I download when I launch the game, It shows the begining black screan than a colum on the right side of the black screan disapears, so I'll see some of my desktop, than a message comes up Dishonored stopped working checking for solutions. Am i the only person having this issue?
