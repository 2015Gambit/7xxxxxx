Support small developers, if you make money with it, buy it!"
,werdna,2012-10-12T00:52Z,"Cant load patches, follow the way the manual say, but dont work, please me how...."
,dmason67,2012-10-12T01:03Z,"@ werdna
The folder called Diva inside the Preset folder should be placed in the following folder : /Library/Audio/Presets/u-he/

This is your root library, meaning the library folder placed at the beginning of your main hard drive."
,werdna,2012-10-12T01:33Z,"Yes I understand that but I don't see the folder u-he/ in the path,  /Library/Audio/Presets/u-he/, am I suppose to make that folder? "
,Towelhead,2012-10-12T06:16Z,"Thanks!
But..
Why didn't you do the latest version 1.1.1?
40% less cpu use, and multicore support, among many other improvements.
I still appreciate it. "
,Towelhead,2012-10-12T09:01Z,"Just tried it. Still noise and crackle sounds after playing patches for a few sec, just like the demo version from u-he."
,dmason67,2012-10-12T09:22Z,"@ werdna
Yes create the folder."
,werdna,2012-10-12T17:28Z,"Thanx @dmason67 got it going, works fine with LOGIC PRO running on OSX lion 10.7.5, just a little pops and clicks now and then, but I can live with that think I know how to get around that, Bless up yu self."
,dmason67,2012-10-13T19:54Z,"@ Werdna
Pops and Clicks come from the fact that your computer might not be powerful enough to run DIVA, try reducing your sample rate, augmenting your sample buffer, and reducing the accuracy setting."
,Towelhead,2012-10-14T09:09Z,"I don't think so. I have tried it on a 4 core, and 8 core machine, same problems. Pops and clicks occurs because it's not cracked properly. From reading online, it has not yet been cracked properly. It also have time bombs etc. If this is the iND release, wich it looks like it is, maybe you should mention that..
I doubt it will work 100% unless you have a proper keygen and licence.
Cheers!"
