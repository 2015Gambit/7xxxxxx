,jallen8482,2012-10-12T03:13Z,So it seems you posted this torrent but did not stick around long enough for even a single person to upload it from you. I am assuming thats how these things work. If i watch my peer activity for this torrent while it is trying to download there are dozens of people connecting but nothing for them to upload or download as the torrent never made it anywhere. If i am wrong could you please explain to me how this works ?
