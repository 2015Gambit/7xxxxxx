,magfibre,2012-10-25T09:05Z,"Awesome, thanks for the upload. I was wondering when this would show up."
,milorp,2012-11-11T13:43Z,"Thanks for upload.
It looks a bit unexpected such big file 900MB?"
,MarsDemos,2012-11-14T21:26Z,Thanks!!
,itworks22,2012-11-24T22:44Z,"It's a lengthy install with Acronis and it went through really well - I was guided along the way by the Acronis installation where my system files may have been in conflict and given the chance to correct them.

But one big disappointment was the s/n in this Torrent, only covered the general backup/restore. It doesn't cover Microsoft Exchange backup data - another serial number is required for this which is a big pity as this may be the thing most downloaders for the Server version will be eager to try out - the previous version 11 fell down on this aspect.

Is there an Exchange s/n available anywhere ?

But in any case - thanks to the uploader for this."
