I grabbed a different torrent cuz it had dlcs and the landscape editor but it's not finding my save from this one.
When I uninstalled this one it didn't ask if I wanted to delete my save it just deleted the install folder..."

,bowlinwes300,2012-10-15T14:38Z,"I'm not new to this. I DL'ed this torrent last week and seeded and just finally got around to wanting to install and everything. Only problem I got was a prompt telling me the Graphics card wasn't up to spec. what kind of graphics do I need? I've played several high res games on this laptop and never had a problem before. I don't know what to do as when I try to start it, the game won't even come on."
