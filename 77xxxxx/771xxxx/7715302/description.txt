The Dead were coming back from a lengthy layoff when they played these home-turf shows in Oakland, and their enthusiasm at being back on the boards shines through: the shows of December ΓÇÖ92 were, in the estimation of many longtime observers, among the high points of the bandΓÇÖs later years. ItΓÇÖs all captured here much as the audience heard it, beautifully mastered from the original two-track source tape.
