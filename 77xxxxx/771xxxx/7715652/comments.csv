,Bognor,2012-10-11T23:22Z,"Im looking forward to this show, it gives somewhat of a smallville kind of feel (not in being a prequel) but not too similar, which is a good thing since i did not look forward to smallville at all "

,Zeckart,2012-10-12T04:05Z,"Great A/V but is not for men, too gay"
,HelloMynameisV,2012-10-12T21:22Z,I wish I was the writer for these things! Too much emotions not enough action~! 
,BertilGM,2012-10-13T01:54Z,"enjoyed it, it can be an ""okay"" series to just relax and look at. no brains needed. perfect series to watch in bed before going to sleep :)"

If you cany stop hateing then buy a bullet, use it, stop living. ty"
,stephen6789,2012-10-13T22:32Z,"This show might be tolerable if you are a teenage boy.  The acting was pretty bad, and the story had a weak plot"
,mrudgiantgodofhellfire,2012-10-14T11:02Z,"The start of any show should grab u, make u interested in the characters and and keep u guessing.

My new Favorite show. For real 

For real?  You canÂ´t say this is your favourite show based on one episode. For real "
,ZombieLionelHutz,2012-10-17T21:53Z,"I was going to download this torrent, but then I took an arrow to the knee"
,Zeckart,2012-10-18T08:27Z,"@n3xus420 dude, 1st i don't hate anybody 2. i know it's for nerds too, BUT the guy only talks about his feelings and showing his semi naked body a 70% in the episode, so, that is my opinion. About the bullet, I already have one.

@Vdentis i was taking about men, mi wife love the serie."
