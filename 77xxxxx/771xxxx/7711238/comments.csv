,LemonJ-Lo,2012-10-10T00:32Z,Sorry for being rude; I notice that you usually *do* post screens but for some reason you didn't here.
,fowlgame666,2012-10-10T01:25Z,the main reason that i put the screens in a folder is because after a day or two the sites that i post them from go away so i put them in a folder so they will last i hope that helps any questions u may have on the screens
