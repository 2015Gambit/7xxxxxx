,.Leto.,2012-10-12T00:51Z,"really good show, one of the best pilots I've seen in a very long time. recommended."
,res19,2012-10-12T02:20Z,its Batman's twin
,reli4ble,2012-10-12T19:49Z,Green Arrow
,Opiumthoughts,2012-10-14T05:59Z,I always ridiculed Smallville for not taking the comic storyline of Clark Kent but it really grew on me. Green Arrow had a really strong pilot I really enjoyed it. And anyone comparing Batman and Green Arrow have no idea what there talking about. There back stories are completely different only thing they have in common are money. 
,Mefayor,2012-10-17T19:05Z,Video: 8.5 could be better in my opinion - Audio: 6  i dunno the fuck why but voices are pretty silent but sound effects are loud as fuck so perhaps if episode 2 could have a better audio then i'd really appreciate it
,DeExpress,2012-10-18T01:35Z,"As always, THANKS :-)"
,Maca-Ireland,2012-11-11T18:17Z,Thanks so much. you guys are awesome
,Instynction,2012-11-16T09:31Z,"I have to say this show is pretty fucking stupid. Most cliche plot ever, BTW how the hell does he get a perfect bow on a deserted island and how does he learn major parkour...? Lastly how does he learn brazilian jujitsu and how to hack a bank account and leave no trace. "
