,pmolson,2012-10-11T02:55Z,Need subs man! There are several scenes where they speak Italian!
,magneez,2012-10-11T22:38Z,subs (they suck but this is the best I could find): http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4685370/to-rome-with-love-en
,Prawps,2012-10-12T09:02Z,Can't find any correct english subs. ugh.
,duriotic,2012-10-14T04:55Z,"Same as others...about half (seriously) of this movie is in Italian and the subs online are either bad or don't even synch to anything.  

Subs N/A , my ass.  Completely ""A.""  Fix this description."
,caster66,2012-10-16T05:29Z,"@duriotic  N/A also means Not Available.
Why the heck does this file not contain subs?  If it came from a bluray, it should have hard coded subs for the Italian parts.  w/e 
Quality is excellent.

this sub is a work in progress, but best so far.  It takes the computer translated one and fixes a buch of stuff.  "
,ofpirate,2012-10-18T02:21Z,agree with everyone else - not much point to this without PROPER subs.. first to release with correct hard-coded subs for the non-english dialog will be a HERO!
