10 year old Amelia's parents think it's time for her to go to sleep permanently,
leaving her broken body in a silent shallow grave.
50 years later, Mommy and Daddy are back from hell, intent on
wreaking the same deadly discipline on anyone not in bed by nightfall.
Sisters Holly and Elizabeth are losing their minds, and their friends
are losing their heads. Something evil has crashed the party, but no-one
knows what they are fighting. When the girl's brother, Charlie, arrives,
he completes the family group and the kids start to find out what firm
parenting really means.
