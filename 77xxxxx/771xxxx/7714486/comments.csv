The digital comic tie-in to The CW's most anticipated new show is here! Written by the show's creators, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kriesberg, discover new mysteries, plotlines, and dive deeper into the world of ARROW.

DC Comics produced a 10-page preview comic for the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, written by Kreisberg, illustrated by Omar Francia, and featuring a cover by artist Mike Grell. The comic is regarded by the production crew of the TV series as sharing the same canon as the series, with Kreisberg commenting, ""[For] anyone who grabs a copy: Hold onto it and as the series progresses, you'll appreciate it more and more."""
