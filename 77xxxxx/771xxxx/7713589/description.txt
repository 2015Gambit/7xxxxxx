Telltale has a strong history of releasing episodic games but more importantly, we wanted this game to offer an experience analogous to the comic books and TV show, which are also episodic in nature. We have plans for 5 episodes, releasing once per month.

The Walking Dead is an Adventure Horror game. This game will offer a different experience compared to many other zombie-based games. You wonΓÇÖt be mowing down hordes of the undead as a super-powered killing machine with unlimited ammo; that would not be an accurate recreation of Robert KirkmanΓÇÖs world. When you do tangle with the undead, itΓÇÖs going to be harrowing. That walker could be someone you once knewΓÇªor were very close to. Also, gunfire (or loud noises in general) are not good in areas where walkers could be lurking.
