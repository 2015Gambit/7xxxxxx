From Wiki:

LMFAO are an American electropop duo consisting of Redfoo (Stefan Kendal Gordy, born September 3, 1975)[1] and SkyBlu[2][3] (Skyler Austen Gordy, born August 23, 1986).[4] Redfoo is SkyBlu's uncle, meaning that Redfoo's father, music mogul Berry Gordy, is also SkyBlu's grandfather. RedFoo and SkyBlu both grew up in the affluent Los Angeles neighborhood Pacific Palisades, where they formed the group LMFAO in 2006. The duo announced that they are on hiatus on September 21, 2012.

The duo has said its original name was Sexe Dude[not in citation given] (read as Sexy Dudes) and the two subsequently changed it at the advice of their grandmother.[5] While "LMFAO" is a common Internet slang abbreviation for "Laughing My Fucking Ass Off", in this case it stands specifically for "Laughing My Freaking Ass Off".
