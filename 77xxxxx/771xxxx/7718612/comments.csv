,cluthree,2012-10-12T02:51Z,Thanks for your efforts. 9gigs is a little large for a fan edit.

,ollie2012,2012-10-13T16:19Z,Now can someone reencode it to 700Mb thanks LOL
,Envied,2012-10-14T03:51Z,Info on what you changed from the theatrical version?
,KEWE131,2012-10-14T19:36Z,"The assembly is very crude, no opening credits with the name of the movie, a couple of scenes is not where it should be, at the end there is no long fight scene; Summary: collected very badly."
,andrew5500,2012-10-14T21:28Z,The scene between Janek and Vickers where he talks about the base is in the wrong place; Janek says that he's telling her this because she's just killed a man yet the scene is placed before Vickers burns infected Holloway.
,ronnu,2012-10-14T22:34Z,Would be really helpful if anyone (preferably the uploader himself) could list which scenes have been added. Have all the deleted scenes been added to the movie and has something been replaced? 
,KEWE131,2012-10-15T01:59Z,"Do not download this stuff, there is a much better version on another site - (RuTtracker.org), but in Russian."
,KEWE131,2012-10-29T16:44Z,The new version of fan-made version of Prometheus footage (02 hours 33 minutes) on Rutratsker.org
