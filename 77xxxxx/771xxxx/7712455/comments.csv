,krdonnell,2012-10-10T05:55Z,Can anyone confirm?
,LordWalterW,2012-10-10T07:00Z,Verifying that it works with the 3DM release……Just copy and paste the binaries folder…..all release are basically steam unpacks so the files from this release overwrites the binaries
,Mae.D,2012-10-10T07:11Z,"It does appear to work. At least, the game starts fine."
,Mae.D,2012-10-10T07:13Z,Seems to work fine here.

,LordWalterW,2012-10-10T07:47Z,"How to change language:

Go to DocumentsMy GamesXCOM – Enemy UnknownXComGameConfig

Look for the file called XComEngine.ini and under the [Engine.Engine], change the line Language=INT to your language (ESN, DEU, FRA, ITA, JPN, KOR, POL or RUS)."
,S8W7,2012-10-10T07:55Z,Confirmed working with 3DM release.
