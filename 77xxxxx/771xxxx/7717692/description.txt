One of the most mysterious albums of the late Sixties, British singer/songwriter Philamore Lincoln's US-only release The North Wind Blew South has attracted plenty of conjecture over the years, much of it concerning the alleged involvement of the Yardbirds.

This first-ever official reissue of a much counterfeited set finally sets the record straight about the elusive Mr. Lincoln and his convoluted musical history, as well as allowing the curious to hear an extremely obscure British psychedelic pop oddity that has long deserved a wider audience.
