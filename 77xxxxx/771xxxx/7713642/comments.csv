In the ""Licensee"" column it reads ""Trial User"" & in the ""Update Expire Time"" it reads ""Expired.""

These msvc.dll files don't work for A LOT of people anymore. HOWEVER, certain iterations DO still work such as 8.2.0.0 by uploader slickinator!"

Works perfectely for me here and on many other computers.
Before installing this new one,make a perfect clean uninstallation of any previous version.
Use iobit uninstaller and all registry keys will be rightly properly deleted so.
This dll is regulary updated by an ex guy from team BBB.
However no problem i still keep an huge respect about our dear Slickinator as trusted member here on TPB indeed.
So please,stop to say bullshits,thx.
I forgive you anyway.(lol)
Go in peace and get more knowledge so.
cya dude"
,kwamjack,2012-10-10T23:44Z,I am sorry to say but i made this account just to say  jetset is right. I havent had a working dvdfab  since tyrell 8.1.7.8 PA.  the next workign one was 8.2.0.0 but it freezes. ANyway  during that time there was talk of  fab not working on x64 windows. that is what I use.  anyway  a month ago i  installed x32 windows and fab worked perfectly but slow as hell.  I am sorry for not joining your side tjetset. I see the guys   abusing you but you are right.  all i can say is  install a new windows   or   a x32 version.  I  also uninstalled mine and searched my entire registry for  anything that says fab and deleted it.

thanks for the support, bro! It's hard to believe that there are such miscreants, who claim BS about me being computer illiteratate or even implying that I work for some corporation just because these dll patchs do not work on my computer anymore!

They HAVE worked for on my computer for years but after 8.1.7.8 they just say ""Trial User"" & YES I know how to use advanced program uninstallers such as Revo & ioUninstaller & even regedit!!!

It's ironic because this was a NEW sytstem with a FRESH Windows 7 64-bit installation! The only hope I have so far is that DVDFab 8.2.0.0 by slickinaor DOES work (replacing the .exe vs the .dll) ... so WHY WHY WHY won't the dll replacement method work?

I guess I'll just have to be content with 8.2.0.0 until slickinator (or someone else) comes up with another .exe method replacement OR unless someone can solve the .dll problem..."
