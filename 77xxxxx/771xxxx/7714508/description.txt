About the Game:

XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a turn-based tactics, tactical role-playing, strategy video game developed by Firaxis Games for publisher 2K Games, 
released on October 9, 2012, in North America and scheduled to be released three days later on October 12 in Europe and Australia for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. 
The game is a "reimagined" remake of the 1994 classic strategy game UFO: Enemy Unknown. 
The game returns to the roots of the X-COM series, differentiating it from the previously announced shooter XCOM by 2K Marin.
Set in the near future following an alien invasion of earth, XCOM puts the player in control of an elite multinational military organisation called XCOM, which is tasked with defending the Earth against the alien incursion.
The player commands troops in the field in a series of turn-based tactics missions ; between missions, 
the player directs the research and development of new technologies from recovered alien technology and captured prisoners, expands XCOM"s base of operations, manages XCOM"s finances, and monitors alien activity
The game is set in the near future, as a global alien invasion begins.
Prior to the start of the game, a group of countries called the Council of Nations has banded together to create XCOM, the most elite military and scientific organization in the history of mankind, and they task the organisation with defending them from the alien incursion.
The player assumes the role of the commander of XCOM, and proceeds to engage in a seemingly hopeless war against the unknown extraterrestrial enemy with overwhelming technological superiority.....
