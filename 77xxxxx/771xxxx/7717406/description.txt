The 2007 entry in EA's cricket match series, featuring fully licensed squads, groundbreaking Century Stick control system and a more natural camera perspective. Cricket 07 also features a new Quickplay cricket setting that lets players crank up the game speed, ease back the difficulty setting and join the excitement of Limited Overs or fully-licensed Twenty20 extravaganzas by playing a fast-blast match of hard-hitting sixes -- or slow the pace down, slide the difficulty up and steel yourself for a five day Test. For a sustained challenge, gamers can choose from a complete schedule of Australian State and English County tournaments or lead the charge in this year's eagerly anticipated Ashes campaign in the 3-mobile Series Down Under.
