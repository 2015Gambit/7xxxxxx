Czech B-W Comedy with Vlasta Burian.
1940



I watched this film on the understanding that it was in the genre of fantastic film, and it does have one element which I think can qualify it, that is, an actual ghost in the castle. However, that facet of the film is slight, and used more as an additional vehicle for laughs. This is a screwball comedy, and it's a doozy. There is a highly-convoluted plot which is actually quite believable, made more so by the zesty pace at which the film rolls along in a mostly non-self-conscience manner. Suffice to say, without ruining the twists and the smiles, it is the story of secret marriages, secret affairs, and secret children. This leads to every sort of situation; familiar quagmires of confusion, mistaken intentions, and lies. The viewer should have no trouble following the story, but that doesn't mean the chuckles won't erupt, as for example when the town doctor is called to the castle because of "lunatics." The scriptwriting is quite clever, and reminds one of the best American or British films from the 1930's and 1940's, the jokes delivered crisply, and the actors truly throwing themselves into the insanity. One personal favorite moment comes when, unexpectedly, the Baron imitates musical instruments with his mouth! I highly recommend this film.
