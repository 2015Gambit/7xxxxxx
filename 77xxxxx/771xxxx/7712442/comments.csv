,gazraill,2012-10-19T12:12Z,"This movie is such a cool idea and has a cool promising beginning and has parts of cool ""ha ha"" but .... buh .... Kera Knightly is annoying and Steve Carell does't ""like lamp"" ... and the lovey bits drag and the couple are just unrealistic .... 

Great QUALITY AND SOUND"
