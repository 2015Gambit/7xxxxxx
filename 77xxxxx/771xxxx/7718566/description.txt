Fathers And Suns

Every year Lister sends himself a Father's Day card to celebrate the fact that 
he is his own father; but when Rimmer points out he's been a lousy father to 
himself, Lister decides to do something about it. Meanwhile, Rimmer and Kryten 
install a new computer: the beautiful - but lethally logical - Pree.
