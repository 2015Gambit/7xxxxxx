Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Alex runs down the latest news today on the Thursday, October 11 edition of the show. Alex covers the latest developments in the unfolding war preparations against Syria as NATO member state Turkey forces down a Syrian civilian passenger plane and accuses the Russians and Syrians of collusion, a stunt that is nothing less than an act of war and a brazen violation of aviation protocol. 

Alex also covers the feeble attempt by the Obama administration and the federal government to make the faltering economy look like a bed of roses as the election approaches and Romney appears to be taking the lead in the polls. 

Paul Joseph Watson also joins Alex to speak about Bill Maher's recent bleats for population reduction through "pro-death" propaganda. 

Not included in the official show description, Dr. Jerome Corsi is a guest in the 3rd hour.
