QM 20 ΓÇô Charged Particle Physics

The equilateral charged geometry of Matter in motion ΓÇô charged particle kinetics as explained by Tetryonics [the charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

Revealing why Tetryons have remained hidden in the results obtained from accelerator particle collision debris of increasing energies since sub-atomic particles were first discovered

Tetryons ΓÇô the building blocks of all Matter - with their 1/3 elemental charges can have the same mass-charge ratios as Leptons in experimental accelerator collision debris.

An updated version of the first chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The 
Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
