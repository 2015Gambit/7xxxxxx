,BvRen5,2012-10-10T20:38Z,the only difference is that this contains only English commentary am I right? I hope nothing else has been ripped.... 
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-10-10T21:25Z,"@BvRen5, yes all commentary language except english is removed.
Also its heavily compressed so thats why the low size :)"

,akshat398,2012-10-30T06:50Z,@Mr_Bigglesworth plz tell me hw u installed d gme.. full process thnkx..
,Mr_Bigglesworth,2012-10-30T16:37Z,"@akshat398
I made sure my Nvidia drivers are up to date.
I made sure I closed my internet before installing.
I closed down NORTON anti-virus and internet security.
I mounted the image on ""daemon tools lite"", setup came up as an autorun, so I clicked ok. I set install drive to D: (NOT C: drive, sometimes C: drive has protection for windows, and keeps the path names short). 
When it got to Direct X permission screen I reconnected to internet, and said ok. Then it asked about Visual C, I clocked ok again.

After install I had no Deskstop short-cut, so had to try from start menu, and it crashed.
I opened D: and navigated to Fifa 13 folder, Game, Fifasetup, and right clicked fifaconfig.exe, ""run as administrator"".
I set the video options to suit my screen, and then started the game.

I started it after with D: Fifa 13 Game fifa13.exe

It worked everytime after that....

I created a short-cut for the fifa13.exe and dragged it to my Start menu.

The start menu things installed by the program are worthless, I deleted them."
