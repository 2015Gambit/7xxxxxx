the update is missing."
,LaxerFL,2012-10-11T00:47Z,But is the DLC legit? Is it playable without the update?
,tops.c,2012-10-11T00:47Z,That's right and this is useless if you have the DVD-ROM version.
,LaxerFL,2012-10-11T00:54Z,"Why does it say there are 3 comments but I only see 1? Where did my comment from a few minutes ago go?
Is the DLC legit? Is it playable with out the update? I just want the new class..."
,ryansyek,2012-10-11T01:05Z,"what did you exspect from a chode anonymous?
FAKE. 
doesnt work as intended."
,jmmora,2012-10-11T01:14Z,is this the Mechromancer DLC?
,gggamer,2012-10-11T01:21Z,"the files are all correct,and the game sees them properly etc but a msg appears when u get to main menu 'Some of your downloadable content requires a newer game version', so this won't work without the proper 1.1 update"
,agent17,2012-10-11T01:21Z,fake. just wait for skidrow's update here MvrtjYQ_
,gggamer,2012-10-11T01:50Z,"its 100% not fake,the problem is it doesn't include the actual 1.1 game update which is needed to run this dlc"
,butthead699,2012-10-11T02:17Z,"you guys are wasting your time getting this.
690, gezz, will ya ever learn ??"
,butthead699,2012-10-11T02:19Z,I have the v1.10 update in a separate package from another source. It still needs to be fixed.
,Bean-Bandit,2012-10-11T02:27Z,Actually they have a link to download the DLC and fixed files on Tunngle but I decided to wait for SKIDROWS release.
,dahaka47,2012-10-11T02:42Z,"It doesn't matter if it's fake or not. SKIDROW are likely to release update and DLC in a single installer, so all the idiots who have downloaded and are now seeding this will have top redownload anyway."
,metalyger,2012-10-11T03:13Z,"It's probably the right one. On the Skidrow website, they do have this same rar on several file hosting sites in the same size, the problem is they forgot patch 1.10. What that means is if you put the DLC in your DLC folder it will break the game because it needs the patch to make it work. It says 1.10 is in progress but no idea how long it will take. What happened to me was the game starts as normal but when it should go to the main menu, it crashes with a black screen. I've heard some people have gotten it to work with Greenluma but I don't trust that, plus you need Steam to be an older version and never update it."
,DeathWaitsForNobody,2012-10-11T03:54Z,"imma just hold off on this one... theres few people i trust on TPB and Skidrow, is highly reguarded in my books. "
,tops.c,2012-10-11T05:01Z,"This is the steam hack that works with Tunngle and it's very hard for most to get to work, 

This is the best version of BL2;

http://bayimg.com/DAdAnAaeo

The best crack is ""3DM"" and I would expect it any day, just chill it will be out."
,Olathural,2012-10-11T07:09Z,"this wipeface took it from skidrows site, which clearly states that its not a complete file yet.. they are stil working on the crack for 1.1, the rest of the dlc is there however.. the game MUST be updated with v1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3 and then with 1.1 in that order (using the exe from skidrows update 1, 2, 3 and soon to be 4) and then dragging the files from the bin/win 32 into your own directories.. then and only then will the DLC work "
,Olathural,2012-10-11T07:12Z,"Note that installing the DLC will NOT break the game.. it just wont allow you to use any of the dlc untill its updated to 1.1, there will be a pop up when you start if you install all the current dlc, stating the games not up to date, some dlc wont function right (this is gaige they are talking about) it was done this way to prevent people like us, from playing gaige untill we got a crack working"
,tops.c,2012-10-11T07:56Z,"I think this uploader just is trying to push things along, I know the DLC changes where the saves are located now, so there may be a small bump in getting the v1.10, may have to install a different version of the whole game."

[T],Gh0stNet,2012-10-11T16:19Z,this will not work untill you use greenluma in the back ground so its preity much with out crack only dlc and patch so wait guys for scene
,TheMadBro,2012-10-11T16:37Z,"@Olathural

Really now? I reinstalled and just put in the third update from skidrow and everything seems to be working the same. I still have one annoying bug where right click isn't acting right. But that was present before I reinstalled."
,NixeaKip,2012-10-11T20:50Z,"@TheMadBro
So you can play with Gaige just fine? All you need is skidrow's third update?"
,Olathural,2012-10-11T21:03Z,"@The Mad Bro THats becuse you dont have steam installed, the skidrow updates are NOT 3dm updates, to my knowlege theres only a 1.0.1 3dm, which does not require steam installed.. the reason for installing steam is simple, steam is smarter than you are XD the games now check for certain files, steam does not need to be running, nor do you need an account for steam, just need the 30 mb folder of files installed, and the game works flawlessly"
,tops.c,2012-10-11T22:31Z,"greenluma is what people don't get, everybody's working on Dishonored it has some bugs as soon as they get it they will code a 3dm style patch v1.1.0. "
,Olathural,2012-10-11T22:44Z,"Aight, Skidrow released the v1.1 patch, find it on his site :P"
,nignug,2012-10-12T00:49Z,I think I will pass for now. Don't really feel like downloading a file with the name 57454857452-DLC.rar
,spikeabercrombie,2012-10-12T03:33Z,need 1.1.1 now >.>;;
,ZeYaniter,2012-10-12T05:29Z,"this torrent is legit.. this DLC pack was ripped off by that skidrow fansite from a russian website that cracks steam. that ru site also released update 1.1.0 [Filename:BL2.U4.rar / Size:53.1 MB]

http://i.minus.com/juWd3UpwIy7W3.jpg

It's time to use your Googling skills. Good luck."
,tops.c,2012-10-12T15:03Z,"This is not a crack this is a steam hack v1.1.0, should be a real crack out today unless they are all on a crack smokin binge :-o"
,Panj,2012-10-12T17:03Z,"@Olathural
As far as I know, there's no need for steam to be installed. At least not upto and including the update no 3. And I am talking about the Skidrow ""crack"" rls, not the 3DM. I don't think the game needs any steam files, it just needs to ""know"" that steam is installed. It can be easily fooled by editing the registry... "
,Ryan1755,2012-10-13T03:03Z,Can someone confirm that this is working on top of SKIDROW Update 3 ?  Or are we still waiting for official crack?
,s1raz1,2012-10-13T15:35Z,"Just wait for the official first DLC , its gonna be released on the 15-20 oct, the pirate and gaige pack together."
,WayneCon,2012-10-14T00:17Z,"Fucked up my Skidrow Game thanks bitch -.-
I did everything to get it back working nothing helped because of this reg patch shit !"
,Stefanovics,2012-10-15T13:01Z,"WayneCon:
