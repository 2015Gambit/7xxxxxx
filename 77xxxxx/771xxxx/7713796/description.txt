Mohammad Bakri, a craggily handsome middle-aged Arab, who is one of the most familiar and striking presences in the Israeli cinema, has one of his best roles in "Private." He plays Mohammad B., a teacher who lives with his wife and five children in a spacious, spartan house in the countryside halfway between a Palestinian village and an Israeli settlement, which puts it right smack in the middle of potential crossfire.

An appropriately and deliberately gritty, drab-looking and edgy picture, "Private" is actually an Italian production, inspired by a real incident. It was directed and co-written by Saverio Costanzo and shot in Calabria rather than Israel because of security reasons. Perhaps inevitably bleak and grueling, "Private" is also involving and provocative ΓÇö and critical of Israeli treatment of Palestinians in an effectively understated manner.
