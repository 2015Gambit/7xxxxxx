Hello everyone I am bringing you my collection of Pokemon Roms. These roms come from some of my friends and some I have downloaded over the years. If there is any problems, post a comment and I will try to help as much as I can.


Rom List:

GBA - 


Pokemon Red

Pokemon Green

Pokemon Yellow

Pokemon Blue

Pokemon Gold

Pokemon Silver

Pokemon Ruby

Pokemon Sapphire

Pokemon Emerald

Pokemon Crystal

Pokemon Mystery Dungeon - Red Rescue Team

Pokemon Pinball - Ruby and Sapphire

Pokemon Puzzle Challenge

Pokemon Trading Card Game


DS-

Pokemon Black

Pokemon White

Pokemon Black 2 (English + AP FIX)


Do not unzip these, you need a emulator to run them such as No$GBA or Visual Boy Advanced.

The DS Roms run best with DeSmumE.

They have all been tested and are working on my Mac.


None of these are personally mine and I do not have the names of the authors of the pirated roms, so all thanks goes to them, whom every they may be.

Goodluck!
