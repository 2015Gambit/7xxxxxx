,oskar5000,2012-10-10T19:49Z,"Hawk, I'd like to know if a complete set of AvX will be uploaded or if the plan is to wait till the storyline comes to a complete end. Thank you for all you upload."
[V],GunningHawk90,2012-10-10T20:17Z,"To be honest, I wanted to wait for these 5 consequences issues to out. This is a sort of epilogue and should be included in the AvX storyline."
