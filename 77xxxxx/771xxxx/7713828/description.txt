Kilauea, on Hawaii's Big Island, is the world's most active volcano. Its latest eruption began in 1983 and hasn't stopped. Since that time, it has created 544 acres of new land and consumed 200 homes. NATURE follows filmmaker Paul Atkins as he films the moment of creation is when lava pours into the ocean creating new land.
