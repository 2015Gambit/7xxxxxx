[T],T.F.K,2012-10-12T18:21Z,"Look at our size (2.63gb),then look at murphy78's Windows 7 x86 size,his size is 2.81gb,how then this is the same.Guys don't blame around with out arguments!"

Requesting a good cracker for DXTory!

The only working version of DXtory is 114, and there's already a 120! 

It makes me sad that people don't realize DXTory is far superior than Fraps, and yet, fraps is cracked the day after release.

tl;dr - We would all love you if you could find a working copy for dxtory 2.0.120"
[V],DeGun,2012-10-13T09:03Z,"seems quite busy around here...

i ve checked Murphy's torrents and i must admit that yes it really looks similar between them both ('T.F.K' & Murphy78) so what's the matters? yea yea credit this credit that for something that anyway none of em created really ...Murphy's aint a trusted member so why give him so much trust ?( @ Addryann ) the guy is uploading since a little... 

well at last but not least the description itself is the same , yea, so yea, T.F.K make an effort on description (as we care...) many things does look the same but at least T.F.K is a trusted member so hopefully he personaly did check this torrent (and eventualy instaled it) for us to download only a clean & reliable version.

No fuss nor fight .

Greetz"
,Addryann,2012-10-13T10:03Z,"He doesn't have to be a trusted member so I cand trust his releases! I don't care for how long he is posting. Anyway, this is how you get a trusted member around here?"
[T],T.F.K,2012-10-13T10:49Z,"@Addryann
Maybe you are a friend of Murphy78,and beacuse of that you protect him and his torrents.We never upload others work,only ours. T.F.K team"
,Addryann,2012-10-13T18:03Z,"I don't even know where murphy78 is from. Anyway, murphy78 created something similar last month, with the updates until that date. So I am now convinced that murphy78 traveled through time exactly one month, found your ""work"" and decided to go back in his original time and copy it."
,SergioPlayboy,2012-10-14T10:28Z,"Very nice, works excellent, except it won't run without DVD in tray and CD-ROM set as first boot device (boot manager missing). Am I doing something wrong here?"
,murphy78,2012-10-14T20:34Z,"I don't know how much different this is than my torrent, but you definitely copied the description.

Anyway, I just make my versions to help people who want a basic updated windows without a bunch of custom stuff added and changed to windows.

You're free to use my files as a source, but I think you should probably just mention the differences in your versions so people don't feel like you are just trying to copy something for no reason.

Anyways, good luck with all that.

Friend we never see yours torrents.This has nothing to do with your work,we  release our torrents.So keep up with good work. T.F.K team"
,krlsgye,2012-10-15T00:56Z,you can upload this iso but in spanish? thanks
,murphy78,2012-10-15T22:59Z,"Yes T.F.K, I've come to the realization that you guys find stuff on the web and post them up here.  It's a little strange that someone got my torrent, posted it somewhere, then you guys downloaded it and put it up here; since it came from here.  Keep finding stuff on the internet guys, people need good new torrents. No hard feelings. :)"
,tonarpos,2012-10-16T01:37Z,murphy78 you sir are far too polite. This piece of shit fraudster should lose his pink skullnbones immediately and be banned from the bay. T.F.K GO AWAY !!!
[T],T.F.K,2012-10-16T14:39Z,Both of you will be banned if you continue with provocations! T.F.K team
,tonarpos,2012-10-16T23:48Z,"None of this would have started had you had the good grace to acknowledge murphy78 for using his torrent. Now you have been rumbled for what you really are and you seem to be in some sort of denial, obviously you desperately want all the praise and credit for all the torrents you upload (even if there not yours). Also will you please stop +1 ing your ""own""? torrents, you are clearly craving some love but giving it to yourself doesn't quite count methinks."
,anni1994,2012-10-17T22:03Z,thanks a lot
,murphy78,2012-10-20T07:00Z,"If anyone has downloaded this, don't worry; the iso is EXACTLY the same as mine, so the description is valid.  The md5 hashes on the iso files are exactly the same. I have asked moderators to remove this torrent, as it is just a duplicate of mine with a few unnecessary sprinkles.
The .iso is still good people, no need to re-download."
[T],T.F.K,2012-10-20T09:39Z,"@murphy78
Man what is your problem?All torrents in PB are yours?This is our release,we update win7,you think the you are only man in this world who can crack windows,or made windows with all updates?So please don't be jealous on ass. T.F.K team"
,murphy78,2012-10-20T14:01Z,"I didn't just slap a few files together like you T.F.K  I actually did the integration.  I have folders of scripts, oem directories, msu files.  I learned through trial and error on a lot of things that do and don't work for integration.  While most people can learn how to do this given a few weeks of trial and error; those people would not simply copy my description, and use my exact same files.  Then, finally, they would not compile the iso so that the md5 matched my file exactly, and then tack on a bunch of useless 'downloaded from' txt files, a few unnecessary office and removewat programs, and a few jpeg images.

So, please cut the act.  You did not create this iso, I did.  It's simply impossible for me to travel back in time 2 days before you uploaded this and upload the exact same iso and description.  Impossible.

I tried to be nice, but you are just lying, and your torrent is a lie.
