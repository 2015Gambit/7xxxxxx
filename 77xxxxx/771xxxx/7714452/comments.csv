,SweetBazz,2012-10-10T19:21Z,need subs!!!!!
,akosiroel,2012-10-11T01:03Z,"All I need to know is if the English subs for the parts spoken in Italian are intact on this one. That has been the biggest problem with all the other ones, more than the A/V quality. Thanks."
,pmolson,2012-10-11T02:56Z,Need subs man! There are several scenes where they speak Italian!
,browncow2,2012-10-11T06:01Z,"These subs suck, but they'll at least let you know what's going on in the Italian language scenes.
