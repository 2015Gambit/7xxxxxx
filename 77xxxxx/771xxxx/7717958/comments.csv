,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-10-12T09:39Z,"Don't bother downloading this piece of shit, either.  The music sounds like deflated bagpipes and the encoding is for shit. "
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-10-12T10:46Z,@Nearsighted_Scrappile  This is for you then..
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-10-12T15:00Z,No it's not.  The audio is fucked on this one.
,anoXmous,2012-10-12T15:40Z,"@Nearsighted_Scrappile-- 
The source for the audio is a DTS file
 I  encode it as usual with Nero-AAC  and 
I have a 2.1system on a ordinary computer
 and I cant notice  any problem.

,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-10-12T17:09Z,"Listen to the music at the 33 - 35 minute mark, after the young guy is killed."

,[qusawa],2012-10-12T21:50Z,"this is the best rip of The Expendables 2
A:9.5/10
V9.9/10
M I don't like it :("
,Mutegrill,2012-10-13T00:48Z,"The ""deflated"" bag pipe syndrom is most likely because the source file is some russian shit. That is what the comments is about on YIFY:s upload of Expendebles 2 to:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7700826/The_Expendables_2_%282012%29_720p_BrRip_x264_-_YIFY

Other than that, I can't comment om Zen_Bud:s upload, since I did YIFY:s."
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-10-13T02:35Z,Mutegrill  you are reported for the link!
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-10-13T02:49Z,"@Mutegrill this is English audio IDIOT!

,Mutegrill,2012-10-15T13:47Z,"I think you misinterpreted me. What I meant was that the ENTIRE source was russian (notice some russian text left in the video). Then someone replaced the russian audio with a bad english one, since the release was erlier in russia, thus being half correct calling it Blu-ray.

So in this case I actually came to your defence, having nothing to do with the release you encoded into your own.

But you do as you like ""reporting"" me or others, what ever use it would do. This site is suppose to be an open for discussion and critique. You may also report me for critisizing you on some of your other releases to, where in the audio is unsynced.

But what the fuck! Look at all the seeders you have, those here putting you down are in minority...

Hänger du med Zen_Bud? Skärpning! Med VÄNLIG hälsning//Mutegrill."
