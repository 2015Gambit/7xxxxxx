The size of this file is smaller compare to Reloaded release. So I guess some files are missing "
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-10-11T06:00Z,"deepfox . no files missing, this is as notes says episode 4 only, reloaded release got all episode and also the game.
So if you already got the game and earlier episodes, i recommend you to get this :)"
