Tired of the overly complicated sequencers currently available? Rimshot was designed from ground up with a simple and intuitive interface in mind to allow the creation of any kinds of drumbeats. With a wide set of features and samples from all kinds of different drums and cymbals, the user can create anything they can imagine. An interactive playmode allows for an easy to read visualization to be displayed in sync to the sound.

Intuitive controls: With full mouse controls, everything is easily done with a single click

Function and form: A sleek design, visually appealing while also showing all necessary information

Show your work: Beats exportable and importable as simple, short text allow for easy sharing with friends

3D visualizing: Play along with a 3D representation of the beat in a Rockband/Guitar Hero view
