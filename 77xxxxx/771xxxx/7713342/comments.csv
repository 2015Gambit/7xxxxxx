,SHADOWLEXX,2012-10-10T11:24Z,How do i choose what to download in Vuze?
,PaulNo2,2012-10-10T12:01Z,Thank you very much!
,PaulNo2,2012-10-10T14:12Z,"OK, this does NOT work. It may contain language files but there is NO WAY OF CHANGING THE GAME LANGUAGE.

Closest thing to select language is in DishonoredGameConfigDefaultEngine.ini

There's this line: 
Language=int

I changed it to Language=esn and it does not work. I also changed it in My DocumentsMy gamesDishonored files, and it doesn't change a thing either."

You have to change the language in crack folder steam.ini (for me Steam_rld.ini from Reloaded).

Thank you, none of the cracks I downloaded (Skidrow, FLT, 3DM) have that steam.ini file. Guess I'll have to try the Reloaded one!"
,EEEEMMMM,2012-10-11T19:57Z,How do i choose just one?
,phadeb,2012-10-15T03:02Z,"@EEEEMMMM

Go into your torrent client and ignore the ones you dont wanna download

@all

Tested with one language + changing the language in ""skidrow.ini"" and removing the ""#"" but didn't work.

Any ideas ?"

,psicopara,2012-10-21T18:20Z,"Consegui resolver  o problema. Troquei o idioma de ""English"" para ""Spanish"", no arquivo ""steam_rld_original.ini"", que esta na pasta  ""DishonoredBinariesWin32""."

SKIDROW.ini

,jschenk,2012-10-27T15:02Z,"Language = ""german""
