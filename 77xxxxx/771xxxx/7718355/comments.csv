,b0bbie,2012-10-13T02:38Z,"Decent game, but it feels like it wasnt finished 100% before release.., and the FUCKING DUBSTEP SHIT ""MUSIC"" was a big let down... Shit shit shit"
,tuhkur,2012-10-13T15:17Z,"The application has failed to start because X3DAudio1_7.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.
 It didn't. Any ideas? Plz?"
,SergioFCPorto,2012-10-13T15:17Z,thanks
,FlankerB1,2012-10-13T16:38Z,"@tuhkur

Update directx. The skidrow installer doesn't update it. The installation method feels like a repack.

Anyway the game has better graphics than wrc and wrc 2, but it's poorly optimized. Hopefully an update will be released (as for wrc 2 was)."
,godfitzham7,2012-10-13T20:17Z,"Hey guys, I've installed and reinstalled this game but, when I start it, I get a black screen with a loading icon at the bottom left, and then it crashes with a message saying that ""WRC 3 has stopped working, yada, yada, yada !!!""
Anyone else encounter this issue ? WRC 2 works fine up to present but this won't !!!"

Thanks a lot!"
,DS1997247,2012-10-14T22:17Z,"Having DirectX issues causing the game to randomly crash, what to do? :("
,jlr08,2012-10-15T09:21Z,"thanks for the game can i ask, where can i locate the save game folder?"
,snper69,2012-10-15T18:01Z,"great, works perfectly, thanks. 
but as for the game, it is like a bad remake of dirt 3, i would recommend dirt 3 over this.  "

However, the game sucks hard !"

,SSkinny,2012-11-06T01:56Z,"Downloaded and it works perfectly. Good semi arcade style game. No eyefinity that i could see. Lack of engine noise in cockpit view, otherwise good. 
Thanks Skidrow for cracking and HeroMaster for sharing"
,kadar9000,2012-11-11T11:04Z,where do i get the serial number please!
,zendrax,2012-11-11T21:21Z,"shit arcade 
 nfs 1   is better"
,sumpcracker,2012-11-13T20:28Z,"X3DAudio1_7.dll is missing.  This error is about Microsoftâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s DirectX missing a few required files. All you need is a simple update, so letâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s get straight to the fix.
