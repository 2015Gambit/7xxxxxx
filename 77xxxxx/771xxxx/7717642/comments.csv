This is not forcibly due to a bad updated dll,trust me !
I know very well this soft and like many others as well,DVDFab is not perfect at all in any case,cracked,legit or not or else for sure.
Perfection is not from this world,our world so,my friends.
Never forget that so.
Ty for understanding
best regards"

thanks for the upload. Is this file supposed to be renamed msvcr.dll? I tried that & an error said that ""msvcr.dll not supported or compatible or something like that.

Anyway, I followed your instructions, which are a little different than the instructions I had been following before. The only difference was starting DVDFab the 1st time & then copying/pasting the dll versus copying/pasting the dll file before.

In any case, it STILL says ""Trial Mode."" :-(((

YES, I used IObitUninstaller AND thoroughly checked my registry..."
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-10-20T09:19Z,"tested again myself on Win7/Win8 x64 and it still works perfectly again with both dll provided as well by me.
@JetSetJoey : i don't really understand what's wrong with you so :s
really really strange anyway...So weird...
Why does it still working fine for me in both cases and not for you...That's the damn question anyway.
Try a preactivated version instead on mine,i saw one seeded by a trusted member here with green skull who also work very fine.
anyway,sorry again dude
regards"
