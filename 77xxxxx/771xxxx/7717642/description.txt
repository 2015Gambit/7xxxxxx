Hello,for those who may get or experiencing few problems with the latest DVDFab 8.2.1.5 i seed since one day ago,
due to a possible bad updated DLL,you can still try to use this new one so and we sincerely hope it will definitively fix
your actual problem so.
Note :
this new DLL has been confirmed to working fine by many different peoples so and is still provided by the same ex guy from team BBB anyway.
both DLL work perfectly fine for me.
Make a clean uninstallation of your previous version before installing any new one and use iobit uninstaller and do an advanced perform scan and clean so.(advanced secondary new scan option).
All registry keys from DVDFab must be absolutely completely removed so.
Do it offline if necessary and remember that DVDFab uses Query server (Online Server checker)
That's why you must absolutely disable "check automaticaly new update" in general menu setting option.
How to proceed :
1)install DVDFab normaly.
2)start it as trial and go to general menu setting option and disable what i said to you just a little up more.
3)close completely DVDFab.
4)disconnect from internet and go to be offline 
5)replace your actual trial DLL by the one provided and go directly in your DVDFab folder.(copy and paste DLL we provide here for.)
you will be promptly asked to confirm it by overwriting and replace this last one (needs admin rights indeed)
Then do it and now you get full retail version so.
What about you now ?
kind regards
