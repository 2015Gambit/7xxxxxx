Always on My Mind

Zoe is trying hard to stay away from Wade,
but when Rose (guest star McKaley Miller)
enlists her help in throwing the first
BlueBellapalooza, she is forced to ask Wade
to convince his old band mate to be the
musical act on short notice. Wade convinces
George to start playing the field and agrees
to be his wingman, but when Wade stands him
up, he decides to follow the seemingly
questionable advice solo. Meanwhile, Brick
tries to trick Lemon into working for him,
but she is determined to keep her
waitressing job, that is until one of her
customers ends up needing medical attention.
