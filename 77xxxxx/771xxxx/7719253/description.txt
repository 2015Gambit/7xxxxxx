These were some old books that were starting to mold.  I cut them myself and scanned them in.  It took some time to please seed and share!

These books are intended to a Key Stage 3 Mathematics program and can be used by themselves, or as an additional text.  I tend to use them for practice questions.

Authors are: C. Oliver (Author), A. Ledsham (Author), R. Elvin (Author)
