But next time try to encode it into smaller size (reduce the bit rate).."
,toomin25,2012-10-10T18:45Z,"Don't listen to Alone.In.Da.Dark, KarMa! Please don't change a thing. Your torrents are the perfect size and resolution.

Alone.In.Da.Dark, if you want something smaller, there are tons of revolution torrents. Don't screw up the only decently sized 720p torrent there is. Seriously all the other 720p torrents are over a 1GB."

My 720ps are usually around half of DIMENSION's 720p. Not sure what more you want. Anyway I only do quality based encodings, so I don't know what the bitrate will be until it is done.

I am pushing x264 compression to the limit which is why it took 4hrs to encode this 720p video. So with x264 maxed out the only way to make the video smaller would be to lessen the quality and I don't care to do that.  Download the SD versions if you want smaller file sizes."

Would you please Export your Episodes in AVI format? the MP4 is very slow and runs as hell on Laptops like mine (Core 2 Duo)."
[T],karmax264,2012-10-26T09:43Z,AVI is just a container like MP4.  Muxing the video and audio into an AVI would not change anything.  I'm guessing you are wanting the video to be encoded with Xvid and MP3 audio.  This would triple my file size and don't care to do that.
