[V],GunningHawk90,2012-10-10T18:00Z,"Lazy artist, you say ? Stupid publication, I say."
,BeastGunz,2012-10-10T19:26Z,"Sounds interesting, definitely downloading. "
,FriendlySpidey,2012-10-10T21:01Z,"Haha the concept makes no sense. Either you paste your own face in, which is illogical since spider-man wears a mask OR you paste a picture of you wearing a spider-man mask, which is pointless since they could've just drawn the mask."

LOL, thanks !"
,DarkAntonin,2012-10-11T13:33Z,"It's simple, if you look at the issue, it was designed for a smart phone, presumable the idea is that your camera places your face in the blank spot, much like I believe the Xbox or Playstation camera does for your personal avatar.  

That having been said, this was 4 pages of complete crap that took place towards the end of the Amazing Spider-man movie while trying to make it feel like prequel material.  I recommend that anyone who likes Spider-man avoid this so as not to ruin the franchise."
