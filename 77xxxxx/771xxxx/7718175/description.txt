French filmmaker Rene Clement's international reputation was secured with Au Dela des Grilles / Le mura di Malapaga. A French-Italian production, the film sagaciously teamed the most popular stars of each nation: France's Jean Gabin and Italy's Isa Miranda. Gabin is cast as a murderer who escapes prosecution by stowing away on a ship. Suffering from a toothache, he disembarks in Italy in search of a dentist, only to have his few possessions stolen. This setback leads to an extended emotional interlude involving Gabin, a waitress (Miranda) and the waitress' daughter (Andrea Checchi). While keeping in line with the realistic nature of Clement's postwar films, Au Dela des Grilles harks back to the more lyrical style of his prewar efforts.
Au Dela des Grilles won the 1950 "Best Foreign Film" Academy Award, and also earned Clement the "Best Director" prize at the 1949 Cannes Film Festival.
