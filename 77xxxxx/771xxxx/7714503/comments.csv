To continue from previous games, open the Walking Dead 4 folder you just downloaded and click 'Pack'.  Copy the folder 'WalkingDead104'.  Go to the folder where your Walking Dead 3 game is saved (most likely C:ProgramFilesx86>The Walking Dead Episode 3).  Open that folder and click 'Pack'.  Paste the 
'WalkgingDead104' folder there.  Click the 'WalkingDead101' application two folders up (within the Walking Dead episode 3 folder) and you should be able to continue your game.

If this still doesn't work for some reason, go to Documents>Telltale Games and copy all the files from Walking Dead Episode 3 folder into Walking Dead Episode 4 folder.  This should do it."
