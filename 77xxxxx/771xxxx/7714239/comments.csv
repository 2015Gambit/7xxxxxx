,Takerisen,2012-10-22T02:09Z,Awesome upload man! Im curious to know how you were able to compress the audio to 2 channel aac stereo? I've been trying for months to compress 6 channel aac audio to 2 channel stereo. I ended up quitting because no program combinations worked. All just to be able to play a movie on the xbox 360. I'll definitely seed the movies I dl.
