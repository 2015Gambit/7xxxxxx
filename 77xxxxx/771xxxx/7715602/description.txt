Bunny Therapy

When Brick develops yet another quirky tic
that begins to overshadow his whispering,
Frankie and Mike are urged by the school
therapist, Dr. Fulton (Dave Foley), to get
him a small pet so that he can learn to
bond with it, which in turn will help him
bond with people. But when they present
Brick with an ill-tempered bunny, the tiny
animal teaches the Heck family the true
meaning of evil. Meanwhile, as the
Homecoming dance approaches, Axl finds
himself dating cheerleaders Courtney and
Debbie - but he doesn't know which one of
them is actually his girlfriend -- and Sue
tries out for school mascot
