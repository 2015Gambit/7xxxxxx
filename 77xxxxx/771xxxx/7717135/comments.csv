,beechyboy,2012-10-11T14:22Z,It's this suppose to be S02 EPISODE #10 not 20?
[V],psspss,2012-10-11T14:32Z,"no its e20

there was only 6 episodes in season 1
being a pilot

the cappers have the naming wrong"
[V],psspss,2012-10-11T14:36Z,"http://www.aetv.com/storage-wars-texas/episode-guide/season-1/

as you can see

click season 2 and it lists the list
they call it episode 27

28-6 for s01 = 21

21-(pilot)=20 for season 2"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-10-12T06:18Z,the worst part is you can check 3 differant places & get 3 differant time lines.it makes it hard on everyone.all I know is you upload the newest ep. every week & I thank you for that :)
[V],psspss,2012-10-12T06:31Z,"not sure what mean

if the parent site of the show cant
get the naming right what good is
having a guide on their site :)

tvrage has also reference the makers
of the show obviously

I think cos the show was split across
actually seasons the cappers
made it their way of winter and summer
seasons LOL

UK has it right they call it
correctly a Series
calling it seasons I think is lame
based on climate  lol typical USA
always koking it up

and time line/date I use is downunder
time not usa.. but just -1 day

downunder folks are always a day
or a step ahead of usa :)"

if you connect to the ccc de tracker you see plenrty

if you got udp disabled.. then change the ccc tracker

to http:// in front and add /announce

on end and you find the most seeders via that"
