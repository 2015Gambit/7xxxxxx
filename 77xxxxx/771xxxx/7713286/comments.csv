So if your looking for a couple projects,i got a couple in mind,that imo need to be restored.Let me know.I dont have anything to offer you really,but if you got any odd request,I have quiet a vault I've yet the unleash upon the world,so ill see what I can do."
,beavis39,2012-10-14T09:36Z,Yeah let me know what you got in mind and we will see what happens from there. 
,numnumjuice,2012-10-14T11:06Z,"I was thinking The Flaming Lips Embryonic ,if that's your thing.I love the album,but ever since the first time i heard it I was thinking how they screwed the mastering.Specially the heavier bass songs like watching the planets and worm mountain.Every time i play it I fear my speakers.The Pumpkins Oceania was also on my mind cause,well if you heard it,Im sure you know why.BTW I checked out your fragile(16 bit), nice work man.F*** the haters."
