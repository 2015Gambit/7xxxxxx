Episode: Mystery Of The Nile

Join a team of explorers on the expedition of a lifetime as they set
off to become the first to navigate the Blue Nile from source to sea.
The epic 3,260 mile descent down the world's greatest and deadliest
river has eluded humankind for centuries - until now! Ride shotgun on
the team's 16-foot rafts as they crash through the rapids in Ethiopia's
desert canyons. Battle through some of the world's most extreme whitewater
rapids with renowned kayaker, Gordon Brown. Over the arduous, four month
journey, the team faces nearly in-surmountable challenges - from crocodile
attacks to armed bandits and arrests. Through breathtaking cinematography,
Mystery of the Nile reveals a wondrous region and abundant treasures, from
Tissisat Falls and the wonders of Egypt to the forgotten black pyramids of
Meroe and 12th century churches that were carved into sheer rock.
