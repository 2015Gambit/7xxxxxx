A black-and-white silent movie made ten years ago! This is a flashback to the old style in terms of acting as well as cinematography. Some parts of it are quite goofy, but horror-comedy has lots of devotees. The pictorial composition is lovely, probably the best Dracula ever - somehow it seems better in B/W.
Guy Madden got the Royal Winnipeg ballet to perform this one, it certainly raises the quality high above his other works, most likely he was inspired by The Overcoat (Panych).
