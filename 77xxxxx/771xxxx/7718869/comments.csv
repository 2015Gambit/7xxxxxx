,terjitt,2012-10-12T21:07Z,Think I found my problem.  Forgot to download the sd files from your links.
,terjitt,2012-10-13T00:02Z,"Nope I was wrong.  When I run it it says it has to close, then market downloads a new file, after that I run it again and it gets permanently stuck on downloading.  This is even with the sd files in the obb directory."
