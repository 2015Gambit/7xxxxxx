,Playit96,2012-10-16T00:10Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!

The disc was badly ripped and/or damaged. It won't play, and none of the ripping programs I tried (DVDDecrypter, DVDFab, DVDShrink, AnyDVD) will be able to use the downloaded .iso file to produce a working secondary image or video files. 

Try again, mate, and do it properly this time, will ya? Thanks in advance."
