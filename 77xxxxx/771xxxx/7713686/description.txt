Hi,
this should be the full version of the game Skat 3000 (http://www.mobygames.com/game/skat-3000).


Unfortunately it doesn't work for me.

The install order should be.

0. Unpack with 7zip. (7zip is Open Source Software http://www.7-zip.org/)
1. Mount ISO.
2. Install game.
3. Copy Skat_3t.dat into installation directory.
4. Run the game.

Please leave comments when you was able to get this running at a 32bit machine or you have a hint or a patch or something other helpful.
