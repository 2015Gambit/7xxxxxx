Thanks eluent.  Helmut Käutner was clearly inspired by ""L'Atalante"" (1934) but he seems to have done better of it."
,eluent,2012-10-11T22:50Z,"Wait. What ?
Are you seriously considering poking a french cinephile about L'atalante ?
I have to imagine that's a game.. L'atalante might be the only french film to reach ""monument"" level. And it has Michel Simon on top of that. Watch Vigo's À propos de Nice, you'll see some experimental video done from a 25 years old in 1930 that not much experimental stuff has matched ever since."
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-10-12T01:24Z,"Je suis désolé if my snoring during ""L'atalante""  has disturbed you.

＿ﾉ乙(､ﾝ､)_zzz

I don't mean to poke a French cinephile. I guess I must have not gotten enough sleep the night before. I will make myself some extra strong coffee and re-look at it. (͡๏̯͡๏)

I will also look at ""À propos de Nice"" as you suggest.

À la prochaine."
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-10-12T08:13Z,"OK, I have looked at ""À propos de Nice"" and I think I have identified my problem with Jean Vigo. Here is his description of the film:

""In this film, by showing certain basic aspects of a city, a way of life is put on trial... the last gasps of a society so lost in its escapism that it sickens you and makes you sympathetic to a revolutionary solution.""

Here is mine:

A wistful, romantic look at the richness and fullness of the good life as exemplified in the gallic joie de vivre.

You see we are completely on a different page. If the movie is what I say it is, then I'd have to give it a 10, because it works beautifully as that. If on the other hand it's what Vigo claims it is, then I'd have to give it a 5, because it utterly fails at that.

By the way, is it just me or is there really, in Boris Kaufman's camera work, a forerunner to Leni Riefenstahl - especially in shots of the monuments?"
,eluent,2012-10-12T17:23Z,"Yes, it's actually Kaufman's brillance we see in the movie,  I still find it incredibly brillant photography for such a young guy in a quite early age of cinema, and I don't care much about the name of the guy. And I don't care much about discourses about movies either, including the discourses of the ones making them. Movies talk in pictures, and a good filmmaker discourse is his movie. So when you add the young age of Vigo.. A young guy makes a revolutionary stand ? In the early 1930's ? Not exactly a shocker. Definitly not a guidance I take for the movie. There are countless examples of that, and in every art and probably in other ventures too. I do my best to know as little as I can before I watch a flick. Sure at some point I have to listen to someone pointing me at something, like I'll look into Riefenstahl, here's someone I don't know about."
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-10-12T20:03Z,"""I do my best to know as little as I can before I watch a flick."" That is good advice. I will not give you any information about Leni Riefenstahl.

Furthermore an artist is not the best judge of his own work. It seems to be a tradition ever since Socrates asked the poets to teach him some wisdom and he learned that the poets don't understand their own lyrics.

You may already know about this but if you like ""À propos de Nice"" there's another piece of experimental film called ""The Man With a Movie Camera (Dziga Vertov, 1929)"". It is Russian and much less spontaneous (more self conscious and structured). "
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-10-13T03:30Z,"I have now re-looked at ""L'atalante"", and I must say it does not look like it was made by the same director and cinematographer as ""À propos de Nice"". 

Even after making allowances for the uneven feel caused by missing footage, ""L'atalante"" is still a forced plot with cartoonish characters, who after all are not that funny. How it could be considered a ""monument"" of French cinema, I don' know! Chacun à son goût, I suppose.

...Wait a minute, these people who consider it a ""monument"" of French cinema, they wouldn't happen to be the same French people who consider Jerry Lewis a ""genius"" of comedy, would they? Because, if that is the case, well ... hm, je t'explique pas !"
,eluent,2012-10-17T01:34Z,"Funny one!
It's basically impossible to watch Riefenstahl's movies with a fair mind, especially when you start with Triumph etc. Anyway, it makes sense that her name has been kept under a lid : embarrasing for cinema. Some dreamy stuff at the beginnings of her movies, I guess that's where you see some connections with A propos de Nice.. Dvertov was on my watch list already, thx anyway. The nightmare endured during Triumph I intend to cure watching El angel exterminator, or The general line maybe."
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-10-17T18:32Z,"I was thinking about her film of the 1936 Olympics. But her career has implications for modern feminists. One should be extremely careful before accepting an opportunity to display a woman's talent. Chances are, they have a very dirty job for you to clean up. 

Of course that is also true of men, but women are especially prone to the seduction of wanting to prove themselves in a man's world.

Thanks for mentioning the title of ""The General Line"". Is it what IMDB cslls ""Staroye i novoye"" (1929) by Grigori Aleksandrov & Sergei M. Eisenstein? I had heard of the great famines caused by Soviet mismanagement. It sounds like this film is about presenting it as a great triumph of collectivization. Now I can start looking for it. 

If it's the one I'm thinking of, then it's yet another cautionary tale about misusing one's talent for the personal cause of some politically astute Svengali. Talent is in short supply, but shorter still is the wisdom to withhold it from those who, would make a pact with the devil.

Da svidanya."
,eluent,2012-10-17T18:56Z,"Eisenstein the Great it is!
Lucky you you've never watched this classic among classic. I guess you're not a student of cinema then. Anyway, that's how a genius does propaganda.. One of my favorite filmed thing ever. But then again you don't seem to like filmed poetry (like l'Atalante is), so don't expect to much from the General line. It's just a must watch at the very least for some scenes.."
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-11-06T22:56Z,"@eluent
Sorry took so long to respond - computer in the shop.
You are right I'm not a student of cinema. I just watch films. You are right again that this is a ""must watch"" film. How I let it slip by me until now, I don't know. You are wrong, however, to assume I don't like filmed poetry just because I'm unimpressed by L'atalante. I just don't think it's particularly good. 

It may take some before I can download and watch ""Staroye i novoye / The General line"", but I will definitely let you know if propaganda done by a genius is better or even distinguishable from any other propaganda. My instincts before watching it are to say: geniuses do everything more intensely and effectively than non-geniuses, and would therefore produce much more dangerous and destructive propaganda. But let me watch the film first."
,eluent,2012-11-08T23:00Z,"Watching L'atalante again I had an idea about how subtitles could ruin it : it is done in such a way that you don't understand much of what Simon's character says, it's a lot of mumbling, it's full of color, discursively light. Now a french listener won't have any subtitle and he won't understand much of what Simon says, while with subtitle you mostly miss that important aspect of the character/movie, and you're force-fed some words that you shouldn't."
