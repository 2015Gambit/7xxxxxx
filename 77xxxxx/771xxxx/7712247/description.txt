"I picked up the DVD after this year's Berlinale, where I had seen director Christian Petzold (Yella) praise it as one of his favorites in the documentary 

Auge in Auge. Shot in the final months of World War II, Unter den Brücken feels like a movie out of time. If no one told you, there'd be no way of 

knowing that Allied forces were already occupying Aachen and flying nightly raids over Berlin, that the Red Army was advancing through Eastern 

Prussia. In the relaxed world of Unter den Brücken, there's no war and no Final Solution, just a Havel barge named Liselotte and its joint owners, 

Hendrik (Carl Raddatz) and Willy (Gustav Knuth)."

VIDEO
I have worked to find and use the "best" avisynth technology on the DVD source, and applied the strongest denoising/sharpening that wouldn't remove 

any noticable precision (and obv. thanx to high quality x264 encoding not loose anything noticeable there too).
The source is HD DVB-T, 1920p, also the TV logo wasn't broadcasted! Very few and almost unnoticable imperfections because of the reception, they 

should not be a concern.
