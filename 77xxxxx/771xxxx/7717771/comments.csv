,darkgamerX,2012-10-11T21:56Z,after the first level it just sits on the map screen with music playing and nothing happens.....
,ahoi1,2012-10-11T22:44Z,So... how good is this game?
,LedZepzKewll,2012-10-12T00:47Z,I have the same problem as DarkgamerX need new patch
,LedZepzKewll,2012-10-12T01:03Z,I could only play the first level cuz of the freeze but so far this game sucks. I am glad I did not buy it. I am chucking this shit hole right now.
,zoranjoza,2012-10-12T03:28Z,CAN THIS game play in Coop on one computer ?
,Pavlezzz,2012-10-12T04:21Z,idd DarkgamerX and I have same problems Maybe there will be a fix...
,spyderx810,2012-10-12T05:49Z,"Having the same issue as well, after going through the portal, it just sits on the loading screen with music playing. Could we get a crack fix please?"
,brutal_product,2012-10-12T06:10Z,"videos look pretty badass if you're missing the always clicking/button mashing beauty of diablo and the titan quest series dungeon crawlers, and can't afford (to wait) for diablo III to go the way of the tunngle. will test on home lan and report, although they usually work 100%. That's alotta loot!"
,silvercrus1,2012-10-12T15:37Z,im waiting for 5 minutes but the game is not loading after picking my character
,genjo,2012-10-12T19:27Z,"Upload is great, game is absolute shit. Don't even waste your time. Unless getting mobbed and dieing because there is no active defense (dodge, block) is retarded."
,Ears14U,2012-10-12T19:43Z,"You know I really do appreciate it when pirates tell you ahead of ""wasting your own damn time"", that a game really does blow hard. Although without TIKASUKAZ, others, and many crack teams we wouldn't have the opportunity to ""test"" some of these ""turds"". And I sincerely appreciate the efforts of everyone that SHARES! So thanks! I will pass on this gem (turd)? LOL..."
,RezMar,2012-10-12T20:25Z,"Game is not great. And actually more arcade then RPG. They failed :(

BTW. There is CO-OP but only at the same computer u can play with 3 players. hahaha
The worst thing they keep this secret till now and the they say there are sorry because there is no MP.
Before they tell us there was a MP and u can play with people.

I hope Legends of Dawn will soon be released. And i hope they will not fail :(

,Imp_ulse,2012-10-12T23:24Z,"Doesn't work, Freezes on load screen after first level, same as others have said."
,Piri_The_Dog,2012-10-13T03:42Z,Not loading! =/
,fearsome,2012-10-13T10:49Z,"Hmm, not able to run the game in fullscreen :) "
,fearsome,2012-10-13T10:50Z,"Oh, Realms Of Ancient War - Config.exe solved it :p"
,darkgamerX,2012-10-13T23:36Z,"the 3DM version works fine so far, i was able to past the map screen and move on with saving my level and location! i cant believe it but the 3DM version works better than the reloaded version....smh"
,spyderx810,2012-10-14T08:31Z,"What darkgamerX said, get the 3DM release, this one should be nuked."
,welhim,2012-10-15T19:58Z,virus detected in avast
,vingadorjr,2012-10-18T14:55Z,Can someone confirm if this version are playing coop in the same computer and if this version are recognising other inputs other then Keyboard + Mouse? Thats because the 3DM version arent recognising this two options. Thanks.
,Synixtrix,2012-10-22T08:56Z,confirming that game freezes after exiting through portal in first lvl.
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-10-23T22:50Z,"freezes after entering portal in grave/dungeon type area. you basically get a never ending loading screen. no matter what you press or do it will not load. the 3dm version doesnt freeze when passing through the portal though it's not mp on the same pc (from what ppl claim)

great upload but will there be a fix?"
,mushrox,2012-10-29T03:04Z,"If you guys are looking for an awesome ARPG, you should check out www.pathofexile.com ..it's free and is in closed beta right now, but will be open beta (no more wipes after that) come December."
,Pirata01,2012-10-31T05:40Z,"The playability of this game is one of the best I have seen, but the graphics are not so good. That must be why some people dislikes it. Anyways, same problem as all people with the game freezing after the first level"
,masterlql,2012-11-08T02:36Z,DON'T DOWNLOAD IT! IT HAS A VIRUS W32/Kryptik.AMZK AND Sirefef Trojan.
,Maxymo,2012-11-18T15:11Z,"SO ANY FIX?
The game freezes after the first mission."
,nunpoom,2012-11-19T02:01Z,"For people who got stuck with first portal.  Go download 3DM crack from gamecopyworld, replace the reload version and play."
