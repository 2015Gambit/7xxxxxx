,singh58,2012-10-11T12:17Z,"Thanks for the upload EZ - u da man!!!!

Works great - no crack needed, just install and play!!!!

Hey guys just a quick question - does anyone know how to make the online mulitplayer work? I just want to play some private matches online with some mates but im not sure how to get it to work since you need steam to play it and the game wont let you access the lobbies without steam.

I know you probably need to use tunngle or some cracked version of steam (green luma, smartsteam, cracked steam etc.) but i dont know exactly how to do it. If anyone knows could you please guide me in the right direction - or link me a you tube vid or something on how to do it?? Ive surfed the web looking for an answer but have come up short

Any help would be awesome!!!!!

Thanks again extremezone. I only use tpb to access your torrents!!

The pirate bay should be renamed ""THE EXTREMEZONE"""
