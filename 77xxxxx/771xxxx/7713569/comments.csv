If you already have other version of skidrow, flt installed

You just need this crack only and follow my tutorial below.

Go to C:UsersxxxxAppDataLocalSKIDROW205100Storage

Copy & overwrite all files to

C:UsersxxxxAppDataLocalRELOADEDSteam205100remote


That's all.. Play !

,Hancock79,2012-10-10T14:29Z,"you guys got thin skin, you're getting a game for free from groups who haul ass to get it to you as soon as possible.  shit happens and it's most likely never happened enough to match up to your bellyaching."
,goall,2012-10-10T16:48Z,quicksaves won't overwrite themselves unless you delete the previous save manually.
,CamilleBC,2012-10-10T16:58Z,"@elDunge :
It actually is quite understandable. He just gave you the directories in which to extract the crak if you have skidrow's crack."
,vargth,2012-10-10T18:17Z,Directions are for the save files and not the crack.You got it wrong too.......
,elDunge,2012-10-10T23:12Z,"@CamilleBC : I meant the ""have other version of skidrow, flt installed"" part."
