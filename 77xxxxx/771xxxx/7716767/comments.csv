[T],xgimpyx,2012-10-11T16:43Z,"MrUnpopular,
Is there a specific reason that you ask? Just curious."
,megodtoo,2012-10-11T22:51Z,Thanks xgimpyx :)
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-10-12T04:28Z,"Yeah, there is - we cap SBT on Thursdays (looking at our torrents, you can see this) but so does wrcr (and in higher quality) and so due to this we were just wondering if we should continue capping or not since wrcr did all of s01 and the first ep of 02.

Basically just don't wanna do what others do, even if it's uploaded a while after airing. If that makes sense?"
[T],xgimpyx,2012-10-12T06:51Z,I usually check if SBT has been put up before uploading it. I agree it doesn't need put up twice. :)
,gsdhund,2012-10-12T07:31Z,"out of interest, have you heard anything about kitchen nightmares being released xgimpyx? It's aired september 28 (or so fox claims) and I haven't seen anything up on the torrents. Thanks for your effort!"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-10-12T16:31Z,Eh well I guess we'll continue doing it even though ours is 4:3 and wrcr/yours is 16:9. Thanks. ^_^
