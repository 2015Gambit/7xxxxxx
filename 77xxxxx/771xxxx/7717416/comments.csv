,tsarus,2012-10-11T16:53Z,An iso of 1.76 MiB of a win7 bootable. You sure of that.
[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-11T17:22Z,Positive.
,keywest33,2012-10-11T20:26Z,No ISO in this just instructions for nothing
,keywest33,2012-10-11T20:27Z,Probably because its 64bit and I am 32bit
,keywest33,2012-10-11T20:28Z,Please put 64 or 32 in description at top in future

I clearly say that the .ISO was created on a Win7 64bit O/S.
When have you ever seen a 1 sentence document that is 1.76MB big. don't be misinforming users if you haven't a clue what your doing or talking about.
Burn the .ISO to a CD and boot your PC off it. Then report back on the validity of the torrent.
I'm assuming your running a 64bit O/S as again, i clearly say on what type of O/S this .ISO was created."
[T],Tom_Da_Man,2012-10-12T19:17Z,"No problem what-so-ever. Working fine! 

Confirming it works 100% good. Tested on win 7 x86, x64 and XP x86. No problem, completely good and bootable!

Burned it with the windows build-in burner.

And yes, it's only 1.76MB. Who needs more, if it does the trick! ;P"
[T],Tom_Da_Man,2012-10-12T19:20Z,"And @ keywest: An .ISO is an .ISO. Doesn't matter if you're x64 or x86. 

You can burn a copy of x64 Windows 7 on your x86 machine too, otherwise please (try to) proof me wrong!"
,zebraapple,2012-10-13T14:00Z,"Thanks 2010kaiser, this one works fine when the ISO was burnt to a cd, and bootup to run using the cd.
100% agree with Tom_Da-Man, ""An .ISO is an .ISO. Doesn't matter if you're x64 or x86."""
[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-13T15:32Z,Thanks guys. Appreciate the feedback.
