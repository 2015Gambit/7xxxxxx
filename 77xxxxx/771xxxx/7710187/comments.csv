update 1.0.0.2"
,GigoloAunt111,2012-10-15T15:51Z,"Was having the crash on day 2 (like most others) even with the update v1.0.0.2. For me, I got around the problem by dropping my graphics settings all to minimum, no AA, no AF, no bloom etc. Once I got past the 'crash spot' I changed graphics back up to maximum ...all good :)
Try it, it may work 4 u 2! "
,hd4250,2012-10-16T09:11Z,"Hey Gansuk,
Buddy, Your earlier uploads had always worked fine for me but this upload does'nt work at all. During installation...during WAV injection process, an error crops up but installation still goes to completion.
when the game is started and start new game is selected the loading screen loads forever (the mirror animation keeps on rotating) and game never loads up. Also during start no intro video plays up..I have already reinstalled the game 2 times and final setup is approx 10gb, but same error every-time. Also my physX is latest. Help will be appericiated......"
,hd4250,2012-10-17T00:02Z,"It never worked. Always freezes at loading screen.
Done everything that i could....ie..updated to v1.0.0.2. by KaOs patch, updated AMD catalyst control centre.

will download another torrent and check if it works"
,burhanjp,2012-10-17T12:30Z,"im new to kaos so i installed it and it didnt work
it said all done press any key to continue 
i did,n i saw a glimpse of something written like cannot b found
i looked at the game folder where i installed it and its size is only 3mb
help smone"
,hd4250,2012-10-26T19:40Z,"!!!.....WARNING DISCLAIMER......!!!!!!!!!.....WARNING OR U WILL REGRET LATER.......!!!!!!!????

Dear downloaders.., Don't download this piece of faulty SHIT. Its a total waste of bandwidth. The setup will always produce an ERROR at approx 98 % completion after running the installation for nearly 1.5 hours (massive decompression).
I HAVE TRIED INSTALLATION 5 TIMES ALREADY WITH DIFFERENT STRATEGIES...but it always gives same shit

The setup always gives the following error........
"" Unable to open texture_levels_normal_lm_greyscale.pak for writing""

The above error crops up during ""Data Injection process (Data Injector - KaOsKrEw)"" Data file 2 of 9.
When OK is clicked Data files 2-9 are skipped from injection process and setup proceeds to ""CHECKING EXTRAS"" step and installation completes AND this later on results in FREEZING/CRASHING of game At NEW GAME START MENU. The game never loads up.....?????????

Gansuk & KaOsCrew team are great uploaders and Gansuk's game uploads have always worked great for me BUT, SORRY TO SAY that this upload is really FUCKED UP.
Since i have already tried installation several times so this is a confirmed error.....

Although I don't blame KaOsCrew/Gansuk team for the error coz HUMANS ARE PRONE TO ERROR and when one does so many excellent RIPS, some unforced inadvertent errors are bound to occur uknowingly in some rips.

IMPORTANT.....
I downloaded the original SKIDROW RIP (approx 6GB) and it installed and worked flawlessely

NOTE...
Dont download this or You will regret later as some data files (.pak) are corrupt in this one.

Rest is up to You guys...I posted this coz I think this information might be useful for us people."
