I have a NVIDIA GeForce GT 525M, 6G RAM, Intel Core i5-2450M, Windows 7 home premium 64bits.

And when I try run the game a message appears saying that my system does not have the minimum requirements!"

[V],azaq318,2012-10-11T10:48Z,"It has 5 DLC in it. But 7 localizations. I misspoke, sorry for that."
,theq88,2012-10-11T11:51Z,"Works for me. Doesn't look like a SKIDROW release though, it's Russian and installation is all weird. But hey, it works. :)"
[V],azaq318,2012-10-11T13:12Z,"theq88
Crack inside from SKIDROW."
,rhalls28,2012-10-11T18:49Z,only russian do not download...
,rhalls28,2012-10-11T18:53Z,"Figured how to change the russian to English:
Inside the game folder edit TiNYiSO and wheres ""russian"" type ""english""."
,Zhelkus,2012-10-12T00:34Z,"I haven't seen a SKIDROW release of Worms Revolution anywhere.

I think this torrent is actually PROPHET's release because FLT's isn't multilanguage, and the other one is.

Worms Revolution MULTi7-PROPHET.

azaq318, why you rageluv SKIDROW so much?"
,juantamad00,2012-10-12T15:31Z,is this an ENG repack? 
,Darshe42,2012-10-12T17:58Z,"This can be changed to english. Just read the description.

Anyone know where the game saves are located?
I started playing this from a different torrent and then I grabbed this one and this one isn't reading the save from that one..."
,whateverthefuck,2012-10-13T15:28Z,"This is the first and only version I installed, and I have two problems with it:

Occassionally randomly crashes to desktop when loading the missions.

I played until the second chapter, customized my worms, did a bunch of puzzles, made money, hired new soldiers, unlocked stuff, etc. Turned off the PC, and now my profile is back to zero, everything gone, all the tutorials are reset like I'm running it for the first time. Arrrrgh, Hulk angry, Hulk smash!"
,Krooolimffgrmyg,2012-10-13T16:08Z,Where do I extract the DLC?
,baguvix_106,2012-10-14T00:05Z,"I can't see the worms and terrain , any help?"
,o2gulo,2012-10-16T13:36Z,"Works great! Just change the language found in TiNYiSO.ini to ""english"" and it works fine!"
,o2gulo,2012-10-16T14:03Z,Random game crashes in the middle of the game. Anybody experienced this?
,spyderx810,2012-10-22T18:22Z,this is a TiNYiSO release no SKIDROW
