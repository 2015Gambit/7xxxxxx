Inspired by the Warhammer Fantasy world, Blood Bowl is an ultra-violent
combination of strategy and sports games

The Chaos Edition features 23 playable races, including 3 that are totally
new, each offering its own game style! Make a competitive team, train it
and buy the best equipment. Brutal victory after victory, improve your
players' skills to make them into true Blood Bowl players! This is a no
holds barred bonecrunching sport! Even if tactics are your favored route
you can also choose from a large selection of incredible and vicious
moves: bribe the ref, devastating spells or illegal weapons

In the Chaos Edition, three new races are making their triumphant arrival
on the field: the malevolent Chaos Dwarfs, the outcasts of the Underworld
teams and, for the very first time in Blood Bowl, the Daemons of Khorne!
The new Lizardmen Stadium is more than ready to welcome all new teams
along with a new challenging mode, World Cup: participate in a prestigious
competition, and lead your team from the qualifications to the bloody
final tournament!

Blood Bowl can be played online. Create your team, improve it and lead it
to the top of the official rankings! Develop your own private internet
league to organize your own tournaments!
