,AdamNJ77,2012-10-13T00:34Z,anyone have any advice for the Mac version?  I have looked everywhere with no luck.  Thanks in advance 
,EvilAsh34,2012-10-13T04:08Z,"I have a really stupid question. How are you supposed to tell if the crack is working? After i installed the crack (tried auto and manual install) everything but one of the features was listed as ""Trial Version"". Is it in perma-trial mode or am i doing something wrong?"
,Lupu84,2012-10-13T10:57Z,"@EvilAsh34 , you running a 64bit OS? Try copying the CRK file to both C:Program FilesDVDFAB 8 Qt  folder as well as to the C:Program Files(X86)DVDFAB 8 Qt   folder "
,EvilAsh34,2012-10-13T15:45Z,"@Lupu84

Yes i'm running 64-bit and it installed to C:Program Files(X86)DVDFAB 8 Qt. I also tried what you suggested and still the same thing. This is the first one of ChattChitto's offerings that have had this problem. I guess i'll try reinstalling it again just to make sure i didn't do anything wrong.

oh yeah, i also disabled my internet before installing in case you were wondering. I also blocked every .exe i could find in my firewall. I'm not sure if that had an effect."
,angelgz,2012-10-15T02:42Z,What's the name of the song?
[V],ChattChitto,2012-10-17T15:02Z,"@EvilAsh34
Try cleaning your registry from DVDFab. As the release is working, so something is making it fail on your pc :)"
,EvilAsh34,2012-10-17T16:03Z,"@ChattChitto

I'll have to try a different registry cleaner then. I used CCleaner and i guess it didn't get everything? Maybe. Anyway, this is the first problem i've ever had with one of your offerings but i have no doubts about it working. That's why i specifically look for your listings.

Thanks for the reply."
,JetsetJoey,2012-10-17T17:58Z,"@ EvilAsh34~
I have been having the same problem. The dll replacement metthod does NOT work any longer!!!

If version 8.2.0.0 is good enough, uploader slickenator released a program that DOES work!!! It uses the .exe replacement method. Just be sure to clean your registry & also search for any remaining folders & files on your installation drive."
,EvilAsh34,2012-10-17T19:26Z,"@JetsetJoey

I agree about the DLL being an issue. I have just tried multiple versions of DVDFab 8.2.1.5 other that ChattChitto's and it's the same thing. I used CCleaner, IoBit Uninstaller and i've manually went through the registry to absolutely make sure absolutely nothing was left and no matter what one i install they all are stuck in ""Trial Mode"". The only thing i can do at this point besides trying v8.2.0.0 is that i'd have to reinstall it every 30 days until a newer version comes out that actually works.


@ChattChitto

I'm sorry if this is making it seem like i'm saying that your version doesn't work. I'm sure it does as does every other thing i've installed of yours. I guess i am, and JetsetJoey, are just having bad luck. Hopefully the problem can be sorted out in a future version.

Thanks again and keep up the great work."
,JetsetJoey,2012-10-18T04:44Z,"@ EvilAsh34~
what is so peculiar about the .dll suddenly not working is that it has worked for years!!! I have also tried everything from using IOuninstaller, Revo Uninstaller & hunting through my registry.

Anyway, let me know if you get slickinator's iteration working. Be sure to remove all traces of DVDFab after the uninstall including the DVDFab folder in your installation directory because neither of the aforementioned uninstaller tools delete everything!

Finally, how do you get the 30 day trial to last 30 days? As soon as I launch the program it says ""expired."" Man, I sure wish slickinator would release a more current version!!!"
,Bean-Bandit,2012-10-18T18:59Z,"I've been using ChattChitto's for a long time and the crack doesn't seem to be working anymore.

I used Revo to uninstall the old one and even did a scan after that and still only 30 day trial."
,JetsetJoey,2012-10-18T19:17Z,"@ ChattChitto~
have you considered attempting to impliment the method that slickinator utilizes because it WORKS!

To anyone having problems with the .dll method:
Use slickinator's 8.2.0.0, as it works for me & others- even though it's not the most current ver."
,Bean-Bandit,2012-10-19T02:55Z,"@JetsetJoey
Yup slicks worked fine for me. Looks like it's time to change."
,Mattaeus,2012-10-23T02:53Z,Thanks a bunch !!
,Djghost13,2012-10-27T05:10Z,@hifi447713 Avira is an incredible antivirus program and by switching to kaspersky you downgraded. Im pretty sure you just set the detection rate to high because avira never gave me any popups with chattchitto's releases.
,lizardomanson,2012-11-01T23:50Z,"When i open the program after installed, it start to load, but then it closes itself. Any fix that to the problem?"
,SerSpec-V,2012-11-04T05:45Z,"Working great, thanks!"
,quasix,2012-11-04T06:02Z,It installs fine but it just crashes some time after I start converting an mkv to avi. I leave my pc while I do this so I don't know exactly when.
,Nightbreeder,2012-11-09T01:46Z,Works great on win 7 64 bit. Thanx again ChattChitto !!!
,davesdream,2012-11-09T19:27Z,"Mine works fine until DVD tray opens asking for a blank DVD, after i insert it then I get an error with Windows looking for a solution ""DVDFab is the all-in-one software package for copying Blu-ray/DVD and converting video file.(only option is a button ""close program"") "

[V],ChattChitto,2012-11-12T23:38Z,"TUTORIAL ON HOW TO ""REALLY"" CLEAN DELETE DVDFab:
Reason for doing a clean uninstall of DVDFab is because some times programs can get files that become corrupt and when you do a normal uninstall of DVDFab there are files and folders that are left behind and when you go to re-install DVDFab and you are still having trouble with the program not running right, it may be caused by DVDFab using the files that was left behind which may be corrupt.

How to do a Clean uninstall of DVDFab Platinum/Gold
Uninstall DVDFab like you normally do, next open My Computer and go to c:Program Files (OR) where ever you installed DVDFab and delete the DVDFab folder....now close Program Files

Since you are already have your ""C"" drive open go to ""Documents and Settings  OWNER"" and open the ""HIDDEN FOLDER"" called ""Application Data""...now go all the way down the list to ""PCOUFFIN"" that was left behind when DVDFab was uninstalled and delete the pcouffin( NOTE ) there are 4 entries for the pcouffin delete ""ALL 4""....close documents and settings

Now the last thing you want to do in your ""C"" drive is to open ""c:WINDOWS  PREFETCH"" and delete the boot-up file for DVDFab (better known as the "".pf "" file
it will look something like this DVDFAB(PLATINUM or GOLD)3080.EXE- # # # # # # # #.pf (NOTE)where 3080 is the version number and where # is a number and or letter (string of 8 total ( NOTE ) delete all entries for DVDFAB.....close the ""C"" drive

Now open ""My Documents"" and delete the DVDFab Folder (AND) the ""PCSETUP"" Folder ...now close my documents

Empty the Recycle Bin and for the last two steps DO in order
1st.... Do a Registry Clean up using ""REGSEEKER"" or what ever you use
2nd... Defrag your whole system
NOW Reboot and re-install DVDFab (NOTE) DO NOT USE the old download file of DVDFab that you have had on your computer ""COULD be Corrupt RE-DOWNLOAD a new copy of the file to use"
,joktone,2012-11-16T08:12Z,Love your work!!Always the best!!Thank you.
,Shibapup,2012-11-20T08:06Z,"Recently I opened my copy of DVDfab and a ""Report Info"" error came up saying the program has to close, it encountered an error. I fully uninstalled it and downloaded this torrent. Same thing happened after installation. Is this a common problem? My internet was disconnected"
