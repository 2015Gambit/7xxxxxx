Over his 38-year recording career, with over 50 million albums sold, there has been an occasion for Chris de Burgh to want to revisit a song, to strip it back to its bare essence - either on piano or guitar - and bring it back to its roots. Now, in 2012, Chris presents 'Home' ΓÇô a 14-track acoustic album featuring some of his own personal, best-loved songs. The album was recorded over a week in Enniskerry, Ireland in Chris' own home studio, amongst some of the worst June weather ever experienced ΓÇô hurricane force winds, torrential rain and the occasional beautiful day. Home ΓÇô an acoustic album. The pure essence of Chris de Burgh, singer/songwriter.
