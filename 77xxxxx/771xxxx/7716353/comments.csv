Perhaps the alternative beginning and ending are not shown as part of the main feature on the bluray."

The director's cut does not exist and never will as per Ridley Scott. However, the deleted scenes which constitute the remainder of the director's work are released on the BluRay(in case you didn't know this already). 

Perhaps a fan-edit director's cut could be made at some point...

As for DownHD's upload here: 
The quality is second to none. This rip will melt your eyeballs with its clarity. I challenge any of you to find compression artifacts. It's just that good. Thank you for this upload.
