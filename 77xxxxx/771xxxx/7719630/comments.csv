,Catalyzer,2012-10-12T14:55Z,"Hi Ghostnet , thanx for the torrent , do we need to have the prevoius updates (1,2) installed in order for this to work , seems RLD didnt mention this newhere , so asking you "
,kingcover,2012-10-12T15:04Z,"Just to clear this up for everyone.  Update 3 includes the previous updates 1 & 2 so there is no need to download the previous updates.  Just simply copy everything as it is to your Torchlight 2 directory and play.  That's it, so no more confusion.  Remember to buy it if you like it, these guys definitely deserve to be reimbursed for their fantastic work on this epic game! :D"
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-10-12T15:05Z,By the size of this update i don't think you need previous updates.
,63Jax,2012-10-12T15:33Z,"wtf is happening, it's stuck at 92%"
,kingcover,2012-10-12T16:08Z,I just did a fresh install without previous updates and copied over the Update 3 files to the torchlight 2 directory and everything works like a charm.  All saves and characters created are still there.  Windows 8 Consumer Preview 64bit.
,Glassed,2012-10-12T18:45Z,"Why does the installation notes state to unrar when it isn't even in a rar in the first place?Just curious as this isn't the first time it says so.

Thanks for the update though!Great torrents from you ghostnet. :)"
,Beograd_011,2012-10-12T23:59Z,multiplayer works or not ?
,Derc,2012-10-13T04:26Z,"Thank you! Don't get why the redistributable's are included, they were in the initial release. "
,deama12,2012-10-13T17:17Z,"has anyone found a fix for the ""connection failed"" error when using a VPN program? I get it a lot..."
,nLike,2012-10-14T16:32Z,"Hi guys. There is a little problem thats occuring when you update torhcligh to udpate 2 and 3. 

It works fine in the singleplayer but if you play with peopel in LAN like on tunggle, the games goes desync preety fast. YOu are fine in towns you see player actions etc but as you try to play somewhere with creeps and fight then people start to lag. You see creeps standing, and you see other guys either standing or shooting something you dont see. It's like you play 2 different games while you are still in LAN. 

I've serched official forums and I don't see any copmlaint on this issue. So I guess there is something wrong in this update.

Wiht update 1 from reloaded multiplayer works jsut fine. I've tessted in half an hour ago. We played for 20 minutes fine. Then both updated to update 3 played for 3 minutes and the desync happened once again. So I don't know where seems to be th eproblem?

But as for single player everything works fine."
