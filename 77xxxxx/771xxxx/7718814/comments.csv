[V],mdprosser,2012-10-20T07:29Z,"I'm not going to be uploading on here anymore... The Soup can be downloaded from the site Magzcrib... just do a google search for Magzcrib, and it's the first website"
,maverickbleh,2012-10-20T08:21Z,"Thanks for answering, I just bookmarked it!"
,zedsfedbaby,2012-10-21T14:53Z,"Really, no more?? Sorry to harass, I know you do this out of the kindness of your heart.. the Magzcrib site seems a tad dodgy, the links are bursting with popups and forced signups... it's a bit creepy. Wish you'd reconsider ;-)"
,Stranger1303,2012-10-22T01:29Z,Very quick dl
[V],mdprosser,2012-10-22T06:11Z,"Magzcrib site is great... i promise not dodgy at all!  That's where I've always gotten all of the shows I've uploaded... you should try again... I've never had any problems with pop-ups or sign-ups, so not sure what you're talking about... "
,maverickbleh,2012-10-22T18:07Z,"Just use Adblock in Chrome, you won't get any ad or pop-up whatsoever!"
,tdreeder,2012-10-29T04:36Z,"Thanks so much for sharing!  I just wanted to request that if you upload any more episodes of The Soup, that you use the following date format in the filename:  YYYY MM DD

It may seem like a small thing, but if you don't use that format then programs like Media Center Master can't properly fetch the metadata.  Thanks!!"
