Thanks for the up"
,jesusman82,2012-10-13T16:36Z,thanks for not using al-jazeera america (foxnews)source. cant stand it when they interrupt to spin things. disrespectful

,jesusman82,2012-10-13T21:56Z,"update...the moderator for abc does seem to be interrupting ryan more often. please just post from the source of the moderator each time, makes it fair for the viewer (in theory)"

,AlexLibman,2012-10-17T05:54Z,"Fox News is not ""al-jazeera america"".  Mainstream media (MSM) is 88% for Obama on average - a little higher in some networks, a little lower at others.  All MSM is government-licensed, and must lick government ass to get VIP interviews and not get the IRS or the FCC to squeeze their balls."
