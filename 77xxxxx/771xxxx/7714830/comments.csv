,allofthepeople,2012-10-24T04:50Z,Can someone please help me get the documentation/instructions for the loook theme... I just took over running a site for a small charity as a volunteer and they had this theme unused on their directory. We would love to use it but can not get in touch with the former webmaster to get their info to the theme author's site to download the instructions and he will not help us! Thanks!

finally, unzipped and uploaded files to FTP. it seemed to be fine first. but errors..on these files(class.php, function_init.php...etc) if I delete all of sources on these pages. it shows without slides and some parts. but not all.

Can anybody help me out of it?"
,alexitosi,2012-11-10T00:15Z,Hey guys these themes have malicious code. You can go into the code and remove it to safely use the themes... you need to know what you're doing. So if you can't recognise parse errors or php/javascript I would recommend staying away from these files.
