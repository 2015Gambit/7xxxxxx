OK, so the problem crops up now and again when I use a 1080i TS source.
There's some glitch in it and the encoding just stops there.
An aborted encode causes some stuff to not be written
and that's why the seek problems.

This partial file completes the incomplete one I uploaded.
It is encoded from the original source (the glitch being elsewhere in it).

Again, apologies for any inconvenience,
