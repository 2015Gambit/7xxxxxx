,GateKeeper13,2012-10-09T23:54Z,This from the russian Cat-A-Cat games... Not the Reloaded release...
,mdx2035,2012-10-10T06:46Z,"The skulled and trusted uploader ""azaq318"" is Russian and he's been uploading really amazing stuff since a long time. so better appreciate the uploader or don't download his stuff. Simple.

By d way, great up man azaq318! thanks very much! :-)"
,GateKeeper13,2012-10-10T14:03Z,"You IDIOT, the Reloaded release is an ISO. I dont give a fuck if the version he uploaded is a working one. I thank him for his effort but since he says on the title RELOADED he must upload the RELOADED release.

And how the fuck am I supposed to know what he is uploading if I dont download it first?"
