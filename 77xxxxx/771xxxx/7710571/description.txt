This is a collection of all BTBAM albums,in FLAC complete with logs and cue sheets.Don't let this be an excuse not to buy this.If you enjoy the music,the go buy it.The new album is in stores today,go buy it.

The Parallax II: Future Sequence is not my rip(mines coming on wax). Props goes out to my buddy on SLSK for that.All albums are gapless and play as intended.
ENJOY!!!
