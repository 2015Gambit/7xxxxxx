,Dobrevski,2012-10-10T19:47Z,im downloading it but will it work with skidrow version ?
,GamingIndustryBlows,2012-10-10T22:32Z,"Yay, all my save games are gone now. Umm, so I have to start the game over now. I'm trying my best not to rage. "
,Pakundo,2012-10-11T00:26Z,"Your saves aren't gone if you switch crack, they're just a folder that is different than the one this crack uses.
All you need to do is to Google Dishonored save location or something like it, and copy all your saves to the newer folder, which is used with this crack.
This'll save you frustration not just in this game, but in just about any other."
,a_of,2012-10-11T05:14Z,"This is a mess...
proper of the proper...
fixes for the proper...

Do I need this fix if I have the reloaded real proper release?"
,ta2jean,2012-10-11T09:10Z,"If you are applying this to the 3DM version you need to copy your saves.
Old saves:  C:Usersyour usernameAppDataLocalSKIDROW205100Storage

New location: C:ProgramDataRELOADEDRLD!205100storage

Hopefully this works for you and every will be shiny."
,ta2jean,2012-10-11T09:12Z,"Damn TPB and not allowing slashes...

Old: C: -> Users  -> your username -> AppData -> Local -> SKIDROW -> 205100 -> Storage
New: C: -> ProgramData -> RELOADED -> RLD! ->  -> 205100 -> storage"
,Hugotoxx,2012-10-11T09:52Z,"they should warn you that you need to back up your saves, once you apply new fix or crack you will loose them"
,GObonzo,2012-10-11T10:27Z,"they should warn you: if you don't know how to use pirate software, DON'T! but the game if you cant figure this shit out dumbasses."
[T],swebarb,2012-10-11T10:54Z,working good.
,xenith800,2012-10-11T11:04Z,the fact that every crack changes save location doesn't have anything to do with knowing how pirated games works. pretty much every other game makes it's own save folder and you're free to use any crack from any cracker team without changing that folder.
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-11T12:55Z,"Yeah I also think its stupid that reloaded, skidrow, flt uses their own ""save spots"", as the default save place for dishonored is my documets/my games/dishonored. Why cant they just leave them at the default area, because they have some delusion of grandeur and just have to have their name everywhere and play cracker god and show that they decide where the save files should go. Just silly, just save the savefiles where they should be saved you fucking morons!"
,OmniNegro,2012-10-11T17:46Z,"I think the real danger of having a ""Reloaded"" or ""Skidrow"" save location is that they make it a trivial thing for any legitimate patch to find and delete them.

They should put saves where they would be if you bought the retail version so there is no easy way to retaliate against piracy."
,Oxycuntin,2012-10-11T20:05Z,"Tried moving the savegames from folder to folder to no avail, I can either play on the vanilla crack where all of my savegames read day/month/year or play from the start again.
Unless something better comes along I'm going to try things the guessing game way.
If only bethesda had put a first person snapshot with each save like in their elder scrolls games it would make life alot easier."
,lopaka914,2012-10-11T20:59Z,"@MEGodObeyOrDIEeee
Why don't go do it yourself instead of bitching here ? 
Have respect to their work . Or just buy the game . "
,ethanhunt888,2012-10-12T01:30Z,OMG! my SAVE FILE are GONE -_-' ..anyway i prefer save file would go to AppData instead of this 
,IndigoAK,2012-10-12T03:24Z,@Oxycuntin: Arkane developed this.  Bethesda is just the publisher.
,dreamstar2,2012-10-13T08:55Z,"@ta2jean Thanks, after moving the files i dont have to restart the game anymore."
,gvlt,2012-10-13T18:32Z,If anyone now Lithuanian language you can watch this game video preview in Youtube U-0LCihSt2w 
,ian2035,2012-10-13T20:35Z,"Downloaded fix, moved saves according to ta2jean and works great! Saves now work properly as well as autosaves which did not work before this fix! Thanks"
,alexmark33,2012-10-13T22:37Z,so does this fix the bug where when you die you restart the mission?
,KillerDiamondz,2012-10-14T06:19Z,I checked for my saves according to ta2jean and they weren't there.. and I think im using the skidrow version for this game so any idea what happen to them? will I have to start over?
,residentwitcher,2012-10-14T15:03Z,works great just remember to back up saves thanks
,ta2jean,2012-10-17T08:18Z,KillerDimondz: Try a search for a called 205100  both my sets of saves were under that folder. Best of luck to ya.
[T],L_Hammond,2012-10-18T15:12Z,"Thanks 'ta2jean'!

Followed your instructions about folders and saves and everything worked out well. Didn't lost my save files.

First I had to set folders properties to show 'hidden files' in order to see those folders/files.

I think one needs to run the game once after applying this fix, and after exiting the game copy old save games. The reason I think is that those new save games folders are created on the first run after the fix is applied.

Win 7 64 bit, everything seems to be working.

,qsaerts,2012-10-19T09:07Z,i got error when im installing the ue3 and the direct x. pls help. i want to play this game?
,XGamer95,2012-10-21T19:51Z,What does this fix exactly? I have the Skidrow release and I don't see anything wrong with the game.
,katzvens2,2012-10-22T07:25Z,"works great thnx alot!!

follow ta2jean's comment to know the old and new save locations"
,gilknut,2012-10-22T11:18Z,"Managed to copy/paste the saves, and those are now fixed -- but a new problem appeared: The controls (key bindings) and grapic settings now reset to default every time I start the game. What's up with that? I tried copying the ""options.sav"" file when the settings are right and then repasting it, to no avail. "
,gilknut,2012-10-22T11:36Z,"Sorry, disregard -- was a case of mixing too many different crack-fixes. :p Or just... too much crack."
,Xaid,2012-10-23T02:13Z,everything installed properly but i cant move the player at all .... the mouse works and i can jump  but the w a s d keys dont work.....ANY SOLUTIONS ??? 
,Kbra22,2012-10-27T04:58Z,"Nice fix, erased my save files! fucking piece of shit."
,Foolrkrum,2012-10-29T21:27Z,Does anyone know where to get the pre-order content? 
,skreemer,2012-10-31T23:42Z,"To the few complaining: learn to read the previous comments or just buy the original game and shut up, please."
,renzik1311,2012-11-02T04:18Z,The fix worked great. Now my savegames have date_time stamps. Just make sure to copy your previously saved 'sav' files to a new directory  under ProgramData. (Windows 7) like someone already mentioned before.
,mmatosin,2012-11-06T17:05Z,"ALWAYS THIS NO MATTER WHAT CRACK I USE:
result failed-- at V:dishonoredunrealengine3PatchDevelopmentSrcD3D9DrvSrcD3D9Device.cpp.701 with error

WTF DOES THIS MEAN?????????PLZZZZZ SOMEBODY?????"
,thehippie1969,2012-11-09T03:23Z,fer frig sakes.i did EXACTLY as the instructions said it and it deleted my games game files.great now i gotta start allover again
,bino-man,2012-11-09T17:06Z,"thehippie1969
Your save files are not gone. It's just that your previous crack used a diferent folder to save files.

Skidrow uses the folder  - (your win 7 user folder)AppDataLocalSKIDROW

Reloded uses - C:ProgramDataRELOADEDRLD!

Just copy the files to the new location, and your done!
If you had a diferent crack, find out what is the save folder that it uses and copy em to the Reloaded folder.

Hope it helped!"
,theaznkid92,2012-11-11T19:47Z,Oh my god lol I was panicking so bad when I thought my saves got deleted. Thanks to everyone posting the fix xD
