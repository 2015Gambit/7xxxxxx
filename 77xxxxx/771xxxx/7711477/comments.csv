,biteme1011,2012-10-09T21:57Z,"I just want to thank extremezone for all the hard work, time, and ability they put into their uploads. I got a computer about 2 years ago, before that I was strictly a console player, but in that 2 years I have probably dl'ed about 30 or more of their uploads and not once did I have a problem. I should have made an account on Piratebay a long time ago and showed my appreciation sooner, for some reason I didn't but I am doing it now. At first being new to computers it was hard to figure out how to install and play these games because of the many types of cracks used by the different uploaders but now I can install, with no hassle, any of these games by any of these uploaders. Once you figure out how to do it you kick yourself in the ass because of how easy it was in the first place! Now actually cracking them, I imagine, is alot harder and most likely takes time and patience, and a whole lot of know how! For that I am grateful to Extremezone. I confess that I do use other uploaders when extremezone isn't available, but for the most part they are my #1 choice and I always look for their work first. Now that I have made an account here on Piratebay you guys will see my comments on alot of etremezone's uploads just to show them my appreciation and also to answer any questions and offer any help to anyone that needs it if they are having problems installing a game. I don't pretend to be a genius but I do have alot of experience in the installation of these games and if I can help anyone that is new and just learning I will be happy to do so."

,ninvus,2012-10-09T22:26Z,stupid question what are leechers and why are there over 3k of them?
,SR4T9US,2012-10-09T22:35Z,"HeartOfASaint, yes you can install to another drive, but due to the nature of windows, it could end up buggin your system. Even if you do install to another drive, it will still place files on your ssd drive."
,virtualmatrix258,2012-10-09T22:40Z,"I wonder why 99% of extremezone users thank extremezone, but never the developers that create the games? As if they're owed something...just saying."
,tbonner,2012-10-09T22:46Z,I'm going to cry due to the lack of seeders.
,fatzx2,2012-10-09T22:57Z,@ninvus leechers are how many people hv downloaded this game..soo there hd been almost 4k people tht downloaded this game..but some r just to lazy to FUCKING SEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDD!!!!!!
,PeTaR_HR,2012-10-09T22:58Z,ninvus leachers are people who are downloading seeders are people who are giving you speed to download soo if there are much leechers than seeders it wont go on full speed all the time
,mettatron,2012-10-09T22:58Z,Help please!! I don't see an ISO image to mount? Where is it? 
,Kether,2012-10-09T23:00Z,"Pretty sure leechers are those who are downloading the game right now, but haven't finished."
,Torxbit,2012-10-09T23:08Z,"@ninvus, @tbonner, and @fatzx2 the number listed for Seeder and Leachers is misleading.  There is ONE Seader, the person who uploaded the torrent.  The rest are all people who are downloading the client.  They are moved to the seeder when they reach 100%.  So the number of people is those two numbers added together minus 1 (assuming the original seeder is still connected).  Neither number is better then the other.  And you often get more download bandwidth from the Leechers then the seeders.   the numbers tell you nothing about bandwidth, which is what you really want."
,poyson,2012-10-09T23:10Z,"@fatzx2 Naw man, leechers are how many are currently downloading the file. Leechers still seed, but can only seed from what they've acquired. So a ton of leechers and only a few seeders means lots of people are using those few seeders. "
,vargth,2012-10-09T23:12Z,@ virtualmatrix258 so you want to see someone IN HERE saying thanks to lets say Bethesda?That would be hilarious!

,Dingleberry098,2012-10-10T00:30Z,"Seeder = A person with 100% of the downloaded files and still uploading.

Leecher = A person downloading parts of files, not neccessarily uploading - and to those dickhads go to preferences > bandwidth and turn up your damn upload speeds so we can all play the game sooner.  Kthx

,waterbong,2012-10-10T06:50Z,"Yeah the autosaves are not working.  I'll play for an hour, through many save points, but when I quit and resume later I'm always back at the very beginning of the level.  Anyone know of a crack that works with this?"
,fredrock46,2012-10-10T06:55Z,"IndigoAK, I'm having the same problem with saving the game. I find that if after I die, instead of clicking load last save I choose Load it will load from my actual save point. Only sometimes though. Not sure if's a crack problem or a Bethesda glitch."
,fredrock46,2012-10-10T07:24Z,I should also mention that when you do save the game you must save it twice because the Autosave will overwrite the latest one. The second to last save will remain intact though.
,JBanz,2012-10-10T08:10Z,"Please Seed guys its not hard nor does its affect you from doing anything after you've fully downloaded. Be champs and seed :)

This works perfect, at least with the crack I used, just a bit of mess with the saves tho, I'd recommend anyone who plays to press F5 alot since it autosaves the game, and to be sure save it through menu now and then. I usually missed a whole mission and got tired of that so I just did the mission REALLY quick skipping all the content to get on with it.

Anyhow, recommended game! I love it."

,specialvictim,2012-10-13T09:57Z,"@onlyAgamar

As to your first question, don't worry about disabling your firewalls, and if your AV detects a virus, it is most likely a ""false positive"", which means your AV software thinks there is a virus in your system which doesnt actually exist. (remember you are downloading from the pirate bay.) This is not uncommon. I have had the same thing happen myself. Ignore the threat and continue downloading.

Your second question concerns a program called Daemon tools which you can download for free from many sites on the internet. Just google it. This program allows you to create an ""image"" of the game on your computer. Similar to how a cd  or dvd creates an image on your computer, but Daemon Tools allows you to create a ""virtual image"" without having to use your rom drive. Get it so far?
Do some research on youtube on the basics of how to download and crack games. That's how I first started out years ago. This is how your last question will be answered bro. Practice on some older games first if you're a lil paranoid. That's what I did and eventually understood how everything works. Hope this helped you out a lil man. Good luck in your ventures! :)"
,specialvictim,2012-10-13T10:03Z,"@onlyAgamer

You have to copy the crack content from the SKIDROW folder, then paste it in to your ""programs x86"" folder located in your C drive. This should fix your problem. Like I said before, do your research on how to apply cracks to your downloaded games before you attempt it. I promise it will save you tons of frustration. Go on youtube and search it. Should come easy to you after that"
,specialvictim,2012-10-13T10:19Z,"@Altrohd

I had the same prob when I first DL this game from 3DM.

After DL the game from SKIDROW the problem was fixed.
 Suggestions? YES! If you are running an intel i3-i7, try changing the graphics settings to ""quality"" or ""balance"" instead of ""performance"".

I would also suggest downloading a free program called Game Booster. I was unable to run Assassin's Creed without it, so you might give that a try as well. This program may also allow your other games to run a lil smoother too, but besides that I'm clueless, bro. Good luck man!"

1.  There is NO virus/trojan/key logger!! Get a GOOD anti virus!!!  There will also be false positives with the key gen and .exe files like in ANY torrent like this.

2. This game runs perfect under Windows 7 x64.  Don't say it doesn't work at all because it does!!  It's not the games fault you have a crappy computer or are just plain too stupid to get it to work.

3. Some of you idiot's are saying because it has ""cartoon graphics"" you are going to not even try it.  You scrubs really base a game off it's graphics?!?!?!  Wow.....kids nowadays!!

4. Learn how to handle a torrent file.  Stop crying and bitching about how they don't work or they are full of viruses.  You scrubs need to stop being so bitchy and actually learn how to use a computer and a torrent file the proper way.

5.  I recommend you scrubbies buy a console as they are pretty much idiot proof for the most part.  Stupid people do ok with consoles as they are pretty simple for the most part.  You guys should check into that.!"

Fuck off troll, no one cares about your condescending opinion. 

First off, while this is indeed a fun game, it is running on an 8 year old graphics engine. For a game that is $60 dollars retail, that is completely unacceptable. I would not expect anyone to pay more than 20 dollars for this game. 

That being said, I would still like to finish the game and as no one as responded to my problem, or any of the similar problems on this torrent, I'll post my issue again. 

Reinstalled the game, reinstalled windows, tried multiple versions of the game and crack, still having the same issue. 

Every time I try to enter the distillery on mission 3, the game crashes on the loading screen. http://i.imgur.com/4I5Ik.jpg (error message). This issue definitely appears to be client side (Obviously not a torrent or crack issue). I have an IT background and my only thought is that it is an issue with Win7 ult (since I fresh installed windows from a new source and the problem persisted). Before I run off to win7 32 bit or win8, does anyone else have any ideas? "

This game is not heavy

Easy to install:

-Mount the image with Power Iso

-Run Setup.exe

-Install normally

-Copy the ""BINARIES"" folder,  from the ""SKIDROW"" folder... and paste/overwrite into the game installation...

- Play =)

If you are getting some problem... update your directx:

http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35

Probably this will fix your problems

If you are having dll problems... just take the dll name in the error message, search in google, download, and save in game directory (DishonoredBinariesWin32)

I highly recomend do all updates in your windows with windows update (SP1 is optional, but I did this) ... if your windows is not original, WARNING HERE, don't mark/hide the file""KB971033"", because this check if your windows is fake or no


Done all, and if you got some problem, I'm sorry, but you need update your hardware"

,{me},2012-10-26T03:35Z,"This crack is 8/10
There are better alternatives than SKIDROW btw
Anywho on to the review:
Don't waste your time; this game is horrible. Using an (incredibly) outdated Graphics engine and dysfunctional 
Graphics 6/10
Gameplay 8/10
Overall 5/10. The game is NOT original in anyway. Don't download....or Do and understand the crappyness of the release. Probably better that you do download so you understand.

Thanks anyways extremezone

1; Installed the game
2; Copied everything from crack folder except the dishonored.exe file.
3; Pasted everything in the C:Program Files (x86)Bethesda SoftworksDishonoredBinariesWin32
4; Copied the dishonored.exe file from crack folder and pasted it on desktop and then renamed it to something different (like ""dishonoredo.exe"" in my case)
NOTE that this part is useful if you are not able to overwrite the cracked .exe over the original .exe)
now cut this renamed file and paste in the same folder mentioned above i.e C:Program Files (x86)Bethesda SoftworksDishonoredBinariesWin32

@thekanakattack & Blah4321

Yes, and just like countless other torrented software in the past. But who are they monitoring, exactly? The uploaders or the downloaders? I'll have you know it is much more efficient for these higher authorities to crack down on the uploaders, and I can guarantee you that almost every person in this world has downloaded something illegal either intentionally or unknowingly, whether it be software or just a single song. Let's say if all of us downloaders were caught and arrested today, that's most of the world's population right there, which would seriously impact our economies globally. I mean if so, who's actually gonna be able to go out and purchase things when they have money available, whether it just be for living expenses at the least? Hardly anyone, because they'd be imprisoned. It may seem like a rather elementary factor, but just think about it.

I'll tell you what: I'll stop pirating when the government stops stealing my tax dollars, how's that sound?"

B) @ all others complaining about seeds.
   1) Don't act like You don't kill programs like this when you go to play a game that would lag with it running
   2) Not everyone has Internet to spare. Some People actually have Data-Limits with their internet, And to literally get something like this, They have to start the download during Data-transition, so they get enough (for instance 3-5gigs data limit (over transition, essentially 6-10))
  3) Some Peoples Routers/internets/etc Can barely even break 10kb/s download due to torrenting being so... unfriendly.... For lack of better wording. and EVEN though, It still takes -all- their bandwidth to reseed it, Only upload at like .01kb/s"

It would help so much to achieve this wish of my dreams if you just simply subscribe to my youtube gamer channel: ""contentegamer"" (have just 1080p gamming footages and I earn some cents if you just subscribe to my channel). Search on youtube and help me and my child. Thank you so much and god bless you all.

P.s: I just wanted to be one day in a first world country and could buy a game. I'd be the happiest person on earth."

,MoD323,2012-11-23T11:11Z,"I've downloaded 3 different torrents of this game and the only one that worked without any problems was BLACK-BOX version. Other 2 were total shit, one has problem with entering the game and the other one with some crashes. So I recommend to all people who wants to play this game without any bullshits download BLACK-BOX version. Thanks.
P.S. Its nothing that I am against Skidrow (because I downloaded other games from Skidrow), but in this case black - box is better. "
