Book Description

If you want to experiment with radio frequency identification (RFID), this book is the perfect place to start. All you need is some experience with Arduino and Processing, the ability to connect basic circuits on a breadboard with jumper wireΓÇöand youΓÇÖre good to go. YouΓÇÖll be guided through three hands-on projects that let you experience RFID in action.

RFID is used in various applications, such as identifying store items or accessing a toll road with an EZPass system. After you build each of the bookΓÇÖs projects in succession, youΓÇÖll have the knowledge to pursue RFID applications of your own.

Use Processing to get a sense of how RFID readers behave
Connect Arduino to an RFID reader and discover how to use RFID tags as keys
Automate your office or home, using RFID to turn on systems when youΓÇÖre present, and turn them off when you leave
Get a complete list of materials you need, along with code samples and helpful illustrations
Tackle each project with easy-to-follow explanations of how the code works
