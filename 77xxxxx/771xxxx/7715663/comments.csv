,jallen8482,2012-10-14T15:20Z,You would think that if this guy up here was so excited about Gloria being Colombian he would at least know how to spell it lmao
,bigkeex,2012-10-14T21:21Z,"Well, I believe he's not from an english spoken area (same as me) but somewhere from middle/east Europe. In those languages it's ""kolumbija"" - croatian, ""columbie"" - czech, ""columbien"" -  german, ""kolumbia"" - polish.. It's ""u"" instead of the second ""o"" so that's why he probably made that innocent mistake."
