I choose it because it has many languages and versions. So the testing is interesting with such release.

WINDOWS 7 SP1 X86 MULTILANGUAGE.6X1 PRE ACTIVATED (EN-AR-NL-IT-FR-NO) 
From orignal MS Win 7 sp1 ISO no files or folders deleted  
win 7 ultimate (( EN-AR-NL-IT-FR-NO)) (now with all drivers)
win 7 professional (( EN-AR-NL-IT-FR-NO)) 
win 7 home premium (( EN-AR-NL-IT-FR-NO)) 
win 7 home basic (( EN-AR-NL-IT-FR-NO)) 
Win 7 starter(( EN-AR-NL-IT-FR-NO)) 
It contains 6 Languages: EN-AR-NL-IT-FR-NO
Choose What language and what version you want for installation, it does not need any Serial nor crack pre activated. Do not Worry about actvation. Autobios.  
Important : I suggest you choose Windows 7 Ultimate because it's where I inserted all drivers possible.
DriverPack	Version : 
+Audio     	11.11		   
+CableModem	10.01		   
+Cardreaders	11.04.1

1) After setup there's a message saying msvcr100.dll missing (just hit enter and continue it will never bug you again)

2) After you login the system will ask if you want CmCardMonitor MFC Application to start (Just choose yes or no depending on your needs) You may turn such notification off. Easy!

3) Drivers not yet inserted (for testing purposes):
-AMDFilter			   
-Gaming			   
-Miscellaneous		   
-Touchpad_Mouse			   
-TVcard	

That's all I think. Please repost any bugs because I am still working on the progress of such project.
