[T],YahSoft,2012-10-25T03:18Z,"Guys, who is appearing ""coming soon"" is because it has installed other episodes, this torrent contains only episode four. the other 3 episodes are available on my page. Who already has three episodes, so is copy the folder to the folder Walking Dead104 Teltalle / Pack and ready."
