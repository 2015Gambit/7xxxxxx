Quick help
Time passes
Time in the game only passes when you go from one room to another. Every time you change location you "use" one minute. It is a good idea to plan your tour around the castle to save time.
"Forgotten moments"

"Forgotten moments" can be found in almost every room by using the magnifying glass. When you find a forgotten moment you can put it in your inventory. If you are running out of time you can open the inventory og click on the forgotten moments you have gathered. Each click will turn back the time one minute.
Ghosts
The ghosts haunt the castle because the search for their favourite item. You can hear about that by clicking below the paintings. Once you find the right thing you have to go to the crypt and put the thing in the right sarcophagus. Before you can do that you need some light in the crypt. You will need a wick and a match. The match is produced by using the magnifying glass on the matchbox (in the inventory). put the magnifying glass away and click on the enlarged matchbox.
The sound in the game disappears?
Try to use arrow-up and arrow-down to adjust the sound. These keys can be used at any time to adjust the sound level and thus you can happen to do this unintentionally.
