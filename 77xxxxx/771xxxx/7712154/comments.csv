,nexuseven,2012-10-12T12:58Z,"Thanks buddy! I was looking for music from this game ever since came out and I started to play it ;-) Finally, I do not need to download videos from YouTube and convert them to mp3! Thanks again!"

Looking for Main Theme #4. I noticed some of the tracks are cut short, because probably the song transitions to the random radio chatter in game.

I would say some of the tracks are loud, some are not. May have to equalize with ITunes or something. It's definitely jarring on the iPod when you have earbuds in.

Awesome tracks for crusing and work out."
,Kapucho,2012-11-02T05:40Z,"sorry haven't responded to any comments, haven't been on the bay in a little way. I'm going to take a look at the tracks to see which ones need fixing.

@JinMugen thanks for letting me know, I'll look for Main Theme #4

if any other problems occur with the torrent, let me know"
