,frdario,2012-10-12T13:39Z,"this game looks awesome from what I saw, thanks a lot for upload!"
,frdario,2012-10-12T19:44Z,"ok so I downloaded game and when I try to run setup.exe I get error : dfs Error creating process C:UsersUsernameAppDataLocalTempIXP000.TMPsetup.exe , reason access denied, I tried running it with administrator options but no luck, when I first loaded iso I had my anti virus spamming there is virus so I added G (virtual drive) to exclude list of locations in anti virus, same error after doing that aswell, any help?"

00000004.@ , 000000cb.@ , 80000000.@ , 80000032.@ , 80000064.@
This is my second time getting this same malware from TPB. First one was from game Xenonauts. Torrent link was deleted because of that :/
To see the prof i will post here my report from avast forum
http://forum.avast.com/index.php?topic=106934
I didn't fix totally yet, but there are working on my problem.
PS> This is not solutions for all computers.

I will not download again from this torrent link, but i am not angry at T.F.K .It's just mistake and its all ok."
,Wolfenbane,2012-10-12T23:05Z,"Yeah, I'm getting the same virus notifications as a previous commenter, they didn't appear until I started to try to install this game. Not saying the uploader is behind it, just that somehow malware slipped into it."
[T],T.F.K,2012-10-13T10:53Z,"@RezMar,Wolfenbane
Try all others torrents of this game,and you will se that false positive virus,is there because anti viruses many cracks see as virus,or other files in game,soo see the frdario comment,and play the game. T.F.K team"
,kinroko,2012-10-13T14:16Z,"this is  a virus, remove this torrent, RELOADED setup.exe attempts to invasively modify files outside of the normal parameters assigned to a program installing. I've installed 4-5 other torrents which use this specific method of installation, I.E reloaded's custom setup, and never once encountered an error. 

So, this file is bullshit and a virus. Account is set for terminaiton dependant upon termination of this file. Thanks."
,Wolfenbane,2012-10-14T00:17Z,"TFK, it's nothing against you, but upon trying to install this torrent a zero access virus hit my computer. I'm not claiming it's you that uploaded the virus, but somehow the file seems to have been infected or something."
[T],T.F.K,2012-10-14T02:27Z,"We have NOD 32 5 ,and x64 system,no virus,we are trusted :/"
,archlegan,2012-10-14T02:39Z,"Guys, if you seriously consider for a moment that T.F.K uploaded a torrent with a virus, you don't belong on TPB. It's a FALSE POSITIVE! Any game you torrent with contain one due to the crack that is required to play any game that isn't DRM free. Thank you T.F.K, the game works flawlessly."
,Wolfenbane,2012-10-14T03:28Z,"FFS you dumbfucks. I'm not saying it was TFK or anything they had that did the virus. Just that it's best to be wary because something could have happened. To make it clear, I -don't- blame TFK, I'm just telling users to be careful."
,vingadorjr,2012-10-18T14:54Z,Can someone confirm if this version are playing coop in the same computer and if this version are recognising other inputs other then Keyboard + Mouse? Thats because the 3DM version arent recognising this two options. Thanks.

,s1raz1,2012-10-19T16:19Z,"dont mind the idiots posting flase positive, they most likely had their comp infected age ago and are blaming it on u.
I have DL at least a tera of stuff from TPB uploaders not one has had a virus.
And to wolfenbane:
idiot when u upload something it goes up read only, it cannot be modified.
Great upload, dont mind the noob haters, dey just a waste of life and should give up :D"
,thecats2011,2012-10-19T18:36Z,anyone claiming there  is a virus and blah blah blha. are you guys blind ? the uploader has skull with his name . so if you are that much scary cats .buy the game . dont make useless comments of babies crying under their mom hoods .
