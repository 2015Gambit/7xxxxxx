This torrent uses the official .exe provided by one of Microsoft's distributors, Digital River. It is an untouched exe, so you will still need to either buy a license key or use some sort of crack within 60 days to continue using the software.

The torrent uses the webseed module in most torrent clients, meaning it downloads the content from both other bittorrent peers and from a HTTP server, in this case being Digital River's servers (hosted by Akamai, so you should get maximum speeds).

The magnet links here add the webseed URL to them, so if you're not getting a fast download and are using a modern bittorrent client, try adding the webseed address manually by downloading this torrent's hash from the site called "Torrage"; that should provide you with the webseeded version of the .torrent.

I just made this since I needed Office; Microsoft's download manager is garbage (and won't even work, saying it "can not run in my country"). Yay for torrents!






TL;DR: Download torrent, run the exe, buy/crack it within 60 days, and you're safe and good to go.

Enjoy and seed please!
