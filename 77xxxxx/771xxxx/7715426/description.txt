"Phoenix"

While on medical leave, Ducky orders 
the exhumation of a Navy commanders 
body from a case closed 12 years 
ago. As a result, Gibbs tasks Ducky 
with a slightly different role on 
the investigation. Meanwhile, the 
NCIS team investigates the recent 
death of a Marine. As both cases 
unfold, the team begins to question 
whether the two are somehow 
connected.
