Notes -
Took the small res HP cam and upsclaed it and still kept it watchable.. Did alot of work
slight rotae, crop, perspecitves, smoother denoised a lil bit and then adjusted colors
added a touch of sharpener and then onto the glare did what i could with it... then just
muxed ADTRG's LiNE to it (nice LiNE and very ncie sync guys)... enjoy til better source if any..
