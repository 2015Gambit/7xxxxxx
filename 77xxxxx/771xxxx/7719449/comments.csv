,crabgrass08,2012-10-12T12:21Z,"oh for christ sakes... cybergodsig, NOW, NOW IS THE TIME to show everyone that you can be mature about this ... keep seeding this one and keep putting up good torrents (and these new FZ torrents are EXCELLENT) and just drop the petty bullshit.  You put up the WYWH Quad again when I asked and for that I say thank you.  Please don't let this petty crap spoil it."
,WasAtWoodstock,2012-10-12T16:43Z,"I have no idea what the spat between cybergodsig and the moderator is about, but this torrent has not been seeded. Unlike my beloved Demonoid I don't pay attention to comments here.

I did some searching. I found a package of Zappa 2012 UMe Remasters in two file lockers, of which this is one album of. All the torrents of this album are this torrent. And the package at the file locker sites requires a premium subscription to download.

So unless something changes, or you are willing to pay, you aren't going to get this album."

,crabgrass08,2012-10-12T20:06Z,any idea what happened to the art for Over-Nite?
,crabgrass08,2012-10-12T21:05Z,"That's weird.  I know they were releseased on a single CD when they first were put on CD by Ryko in 1986, but these new UMe remasters are definitely separate CDs for each album.  Also, you put the last track (7) of Overnite Sensation (""Montana"") in the folder with apostrophe.  Oh well... if you find the art for it feel free to put it up.  I'm a longtime FZ collector and I'd love to see it, but I just can't justify buying new CDs of albums I have already bought 3 or 4 times before."
,canadianice,2012-10-12T21:44Z,Montana is on Overnight Senasation not Apostrohe'
