,Mega_troll,2012-10-09T19:45Z," there's one thing we know about the Left, it's their consistency and dedication to principle. (Stop laughing!) And so it struck me as odd, that I have not heard any on the Left calling President Obama a ""chickenhawk"". You know, someone who didn't serve in the military but is all in favor of sending others to fight.

Now, I know the military has lawyers, but I don't think they have community organizers, so I'm pretty sure that Barry didn't serve in uniform. And to what extent has Obama favored sending others to fight? In addition to maintaining troops in Iraq and Afghanistan for the last three years, Barry O has sent troops into Pakistan, bombed Libya and sent military ""advisers"" to Uganda, and utilized fighter aircraft and drones in Yemen.

Now, realistically, if this were a Republican President with the same lack of military service, don't you think we'd be hearing the ""C"" word every day? But Obama's followers, rather than berating him as a ""chickenhawk"", are praising him for ""his"" military accomplishments. The cretins who hate the military, march in the anti-war demonstrations, and protest ""torture"" and the lack of prisoner's due process at Gitmo (which Obama promised to close and hasn't) , are bragging about Obama's ""kills"""
,RTT2,2012-11-08T10:30Z,"Equally interesting, of course, is the phenomenon of republicans who DEFENDED republican presidents accused of the 'C' word, going into great detail about how military service is not necessary, but now use the 'C' word freely, and don't seem to recognize their former qualified reasoning when they see it in their opponents.
