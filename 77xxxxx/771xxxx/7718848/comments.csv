,jammerster,2012-10-12T03:34Z,"psspss, thanks for the torrent.

However can i ask why you re-encode scene releases to Xvid/DivX, do you not understand the concept of lossy compression?

seriously dude, you are making an unwatchable mess of good HQ torrents out there.

oh it gets better 44KHZ audio from a 48KHZ source. fuck me it gets better. why not re-encode to WMV7, it will get better results!"
,jammerster,2012-10-12T03:35Z,"Good effort but 1996 wants its poorly encoded videos back!

Seriously, its like the shit you would get off Gnuttella back in the day. Thats why we moved to torrents.

Now we have n00bs messing that up too.

lets rencode everything to DivX3/RM/WMV7 and call it a release!

You are not just releasing poor quality works (because you HAVE to re-encode) you are slowing the progress of all man-kind you douche."
[V],psspss,2012-10-12T04:16Z,"ive explained why I do things a million times

1) I dont think its fair to compete with media coys at the same level.. xvid is a lower quality then
what they sell and offer
have you notice the sites under attack since uploads
went to 720p and mp4s
plus should makle me less a target cos of it
uploaders are under attack 

2) xvid is universal it plays on more devices

including older geat dvds (e.g. 3 years old!)

[V],psspss,2012-10-12T04:17Z,"scene didnt release this either.. 

i did"
[V],psspss,2012-10-12T04:25Z,"its funny idiots like this has to even speak on torrents when they dont upload anything themselves to the community

perhaps we need to do a poll.. for how many on tpb want avis over other formats

fook me I beat they cant tell the difference from a xvid vs mp4 pklaying on the laptop screen from 1 meter away

only way is to zoom the picture or scale it up
on a large screen

If people dont want this series
let me know I stop wasting my time and bandwidth sharing this show

as we all know scene just are very nice people and supply you every episode for every show
right "
,jammerster,2012-10-12T05:48Z,"- fair enough. 

i do release torrents. but not on piratebay for some of the reasons you stated.

Could i ask if you at least do a 2-Pass on your XviD encodes? - it will give you better results

.h264 is a really good codec, nice and small, practically universal (DVD/DVR/Ipod/Iphone/Android devices) out of the box

Finally we have a codec that is unified, internationally recognized and of a superior quality. 

Real Media/WMV got dumped a long time ago to make way for Xvid, lets do the same for h264.

If you and your followers are happy with this then power to you.

Is a real letdown tho, when you open your file and all your hear is squelchy over compressed audio ( you reduced frequency toofrom 48Khz to 44Khz no need for that - do your homework, i would rather an uncompressed WAV to maintain quality, despite the size) and see lossy compression with no detail

btw i can EASILY identify the smudge fest on my Samsung Galaxy Note from well over 1 meter away. -Terrible

If you want user to be able to watch xvids, how about you upload some tools to allow others to convert if the choose (even encode correcty to ensure maximum quality)

This might help you out"
[V],psspss,2012-10-12T06:26Z,"as if you can see the different from a 1 pass and 2 pass.. I bet you cant
it really derpends on the source you encoding
and if the scene has alot of water scenes or fast action

constant everything works good.. for streaming it

and the size is near enough 350mb "
,jammerster,2012-10-12T09:29Z,"i guess you may have poor eyesight.

if there is no difference in  1-Pass to 2-Pass, i would like to see that!

I have ot got time to prove it to you.

Quantinize matrix is better used with 2-Pass

Your high motion screens will have enough data rate (with 2pass VBR) to not notice fast moving/water scenes

If you cant tell the difference between 1-Pass and 2-Pass, you are gonna shit yourself when you watch a Blueray disc compared to DVD

Oops sorry, i realize you probably prefer VCD in MPEG1 - which BTW would look better than your releases on a 2-PASS (despite the resolution)

Hi res source + shitty encode = garbage.

Try a 2-Pass (if you can handle waiting a little longer - which is, i believe, the only reason you choose 1-Pass. either that or you are running a 486SX-25 as your encode rig!) - thats right, i have a dedicated rig for encoding. :-) - soon to be 2, for CPU spreading on single encodes.

1-Pass on .h264 does really well, with CQ variables to allow ""Constant Quality"" - not so with XviD.

2-Pass is equally as good with .h264, and allows you to set a file size.

Try RipBot264.  you will be suprised.

A .h264 to h246 encode will come out better than a .h264 to XviD. 

.h264 even allows internal embedding of subtitles and even cover art.

,jammerster,2012-10-12T09:36Z,"Dude i have been encoding video since the days of Indio. Graph filters are my specialty

But you dont use those to encode, do you?

Some 'point and click warrior' software crap like Xilsoft or some shit. nice and easy......

Pick up a fucking book, read the doom9 forums, you are sounding like a retard."
[V],psspss,2012-10-12T09:52Z,"i dont force anyone to download my stuff but
in fact people request stuff

and I dont ever watch blue ray I habve no call for it

and Im not encoding them either

you cant tell shit all difference when watching on the laptop device what encoding is used

as I said if you encode a mp4 to xvid 2 pass is hardly worth it"
[V],psspss,2012-10-12T10:00Z,"im kinda fed up with you hot shots telling me what to do.. its not the people watching it but other cappers who think I should adopt their ways

Im not stupid and ive read plenty.. ive even read where people state clearly 2 pass has little effect
and when to really use it..

I dont want exact sizing either
and I dont want to watch it on big screens other then laptops
or tablet"
[V],psspss,2012-10-12T10:06Z,"im not here to win a prize or pissing match

had enough of the insults from you too

go on your way now.. and stop cluntering the torrent comments 

im not stopping cappers who claim to be the best from uploading to p2p either and providing the missing content but they mostly too chicken to at it to tpb

as for sizing.. i hear all the time afg rips are like 100mb bigger most of the time and not even close to 350m people opt for mine cos of it"
,jammerster,2012-10-12T11:31Z,".h264 is a container more than a format.

It ensures you keep all the quality of the original. (the whole concept was based around this)

Not my opinion, just fact.

Do as you will, i admit i am being arrogant. But it grinds my gears when i see someone not fullfiling their potential.

Peace"
[V],psspss,2012-10-13T03:29Z,"as far as i see the advance to 2 pass is that it uses
more bitrate for fast scenes/changing more
and less bitrate for the slower scenes its aa VBR
format

however most of the tv shows.. can be encoded fine
on Constant bitrate of  800 (but we use 1000 as it works out about right for size give or take 20-30mb each way) which 800 is really the bare min without
too much quality loss

that means you really have 200bitrate more for the faster scenes if they happen in the avi anyhow 
which is why I say you wont notice much of an impriovement.. for general encodes

ive encode 1-oass and 2-pass for a few things and
watched both to see if i noticed a thing
and I didnt.

exception were water scenes with splashing then
one either has to up bitrate to like 1400-1500
or do 2 pass to keep size down for avi MBs"
,deadpoolvsdeathstroke,2012-10-13T14:45Z,"@psspss I thank you for the torrent, both my wife and I are shift workers so this is our main port of call for the shows to catch up on.

@jammerster Who the fuck are you to tell the uploader what their encoding should be? or what I should download, personally I am glad to see an avi. as it is universal for standard current tv viewing.

A9/V7/Jammerster's mum 2, but she did lick my balls, so...

Nice work and Keep em coming psspss, :)"
,DJ_APC,2012-10-18T19:59Z,"Wow!!

psspss - Thank you for the torrent, I appreciate those that create xvid for the same reasons you have specified.  I have a media player hooked up to the TV that will not play MP4 or MKV files.

And Jammerster?  Seriously???  How rude.  Upload the show yourself in MP4 format if you don't like it....don't bag others for their efforts!  Look up the word 'diplomatic' in the dictionary, there is a better way to get your point across without being a dick about it."

Please keep them coming psspss - and thanks once again!"

sorry! It didn't show up the first time, thought it hadn't gone thru properly....."
