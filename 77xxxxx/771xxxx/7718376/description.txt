Double click on eagle-win-6.2.0.exe
Install it as freeware when it asks you
If you opened Eagle, close it
Run CadSoft Eagle Professional 6.2.0.exe
  Point it to your install location (where eagle.exe is)
  hit "Next"
  Hit "Finish" (or whatever it was)
You will be able to use Eagle as if you paid for it.  But it will still say "you need a license."  Don't sweat it.  You can use the full area of the PCB board, and more than 1 schematic sheet.  I haven't looked at it further.

***********************************************************************************

YOU DONT NEED A LICENSE

After patching you Run using Freeware license & 
PROFESSIONAL features become available!!

All files saved are LEGAL

after patching no need to "legalize" old files before use!!!

NOTE.. illegal saves from older versions will still have there routes scrambled so you have to redo those 
but afterwards when you resave there legal

**********************

VISTA

Running patch under admin logon won't work, 
you need to run the patch under vista safe-mode for it to patch.
