[T],data9724,2012-10-23T07:54Z,"Np, next up is Butterscotch 1-2, then I can get back to ""regular"" Cinebook scans, and the last 4 Valhalla books :)
And the kaskus thread is still running :)"

I got Valhalla 12-15, Loisel's Peter Pan 1-6, Little Spirou 3-12 and 14-15, whenever I get time between ""normal"" scans, and RL :)"
