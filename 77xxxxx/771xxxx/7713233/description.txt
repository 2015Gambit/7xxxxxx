Story:

A city rat pursues a nearly empty bag of cheese snacks that's drifting in the breeze. His journey takes him through a vent into a highly mechanized rat lab, where one particular white female gets his attention. The attraction seems mutual. Now, is there any way out? Bar codes and coincidence figure in the resolution.
