,thegh0sts,2012-10-10T13:00Z,i wonder if i can still use this crack with the FLT iso?
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-10-10T13:24Z,yes you can only crack was faulty
,cfkpower,2012-10-10T13:34Z,thanks!
,AnonymousUsernameHere,2012-10-10T14:59Z,"Seems to be working well. Controls are saving, time/date is showing on the saves, all boots up without issue. "
,goall,2012-10-10T16:44Z,Quicksaves still won't overwrite themselves unless you delete the previous one manually.
,goall,2012-10-10T16:51Z,"Oh it's just the save time that won't update, the file itself will."
,CrossCrucial,2012-10-10T17:25Z,"Thanks. This also fixed a bug I was having where I couldn't play in full screen. 

I also made sure to reinstall the game first, instead of just overwriting skidrow's crack, I'd suggest to do the same."
,idevill,2012-10-10T17:45Z,"Geez, should I use RLD or FLT Proper? This Scene War is confusing the hell out of me! haha"
,MrTTAO,2012-10-10T19:33Z,"@goall: Not updating the time/date of save is a crucial fault since the game does not let you NAME saves.
The only way to tell them apart is by the time/date...

Reloading random saves sucks.

However, what I have taken to doing is never overwriting, instead i manually create new saves and then delete the old ones"
,The_Probe,2012-10-10T21:23Z,Anyway to replace the FLT crack with this while still keeping save games?
,zetobyx,2012-10-10T21:26Z,"i dont understand, how do i install the crack? i have the game and mounted it and installed it. what do i do with this?"
,The_Probe,2012-10-10T21:48Z,"In order to migrate saves from the skidrow/FLT crack you need to go to:
C:Users***AppDataLocalFLTSteam205100remote
and copy all the files to:
C:ProgramDataRELOADED***205100storage"
,l3fg8snj,2012-10-10T23:04Z,"This version fixed the missing date/time on saves, but it seems the actual times gets messed up after a few saves as well. It still registers as something, just that my autosave from now read the correct time, while my just now new save had a time about two hours ago.

What is the issue here?"
,reduxx,2012-10-11T06:41Z,Flawless! Thanks Gh0stNet!
,Alt-Ctrl,2012-10-11T10:52Z,Works great with 3DM.
,MrTTAO,2012-10-11T18:55Z,"@l3fg8snj: This happens because you chose to ""overwrite"" an existing save. DON'T DO THAT.

Delete the save and then create a new save to avoid that problem."
,Mopsteras,2012-10-12T09:44Z,This is fucking shit I can't delete saves manualy and I reached the limit of saves in the game so I can't delete saves cuz I have error something with 'wow64' and I can't save the game anymore because I have limit of saves! Can't someone do some fucking proper crack not this shit please!!!!
,brianxxx,2012-10-13T01:59Z,You could just stop complaining and go buy it....
,Xeixis,2012-10-14T22:11Z,"PLEASE HELP!!

As soon as I start the game it crashes.
I have tried four different cracks and none work....
I don't know what I'm doing wrong, i installed the game, copied the crack and such, but it still crashed... Am i just not blocking it on the firewall properly??"
,Surre48,2012-10-14T22:12Z,"when i run dishonored it sais its missing binkw32.dll
What should i do?"
,Sholaska18,2012-10-17T01:03Z,"@Surre48
I had the same problem, the crack and the other 2 files that are with this downlad, has to be put in the same folder as where the regular dishonored game was at. For me it was C:Program Files (x86)DishonoredBinariesWin32. But of course I have gotten the 3DM version. Hope this helps."
