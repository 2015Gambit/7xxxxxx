,Rubbebubbe,2012-10-11T08:33Z,"Thx a bunch for the english PAL-version of this awesome game.

Now I have a question that I hope someone of all you gameloving people out there can answer. When I try to play this game it wants to do an update and I wanna know if itÂ´s safe to do the update or if it will f**k up my Xbox in any way. I have an Xbox flashed with LT+3.0 and the game is burned with an Burner Max flashed iHas.

Thanks in advance!"
,OverSun,2012-10-11T08:53Z,"I've downloaded the NTSC version and accepted the update when prompted.
Console didn't fuck up, but took two reboots (first for the update and then another one by hand not shure why, but it didn't play backups after first reboot). And everything plays well except NTSC Dishonored (wrong region)."
,OverSun,2012-10-11T09:06Z,"I've tried to run NTSC version and did accept the proposed update.
Th console didn't f**k up but the update took two reboots, one by update and one by hand (backups didn't play after the first reboot).
After second reboot everything runs well, except wrong region Dishonored."
,OverSun,2012-10-11T09:10Z,what the hell is wrong with comments on this site?..
,Rubbebubbe,2012-10-11T09:25Z,"Thanks for your quick answer OverSun...
IÂ´m updating my Xbox soon and will post the result here later."
,Rubbebubbe,2012-10-11T09:32Z,"OverSun: By the way, what do you mean that you had to do the update/reboot ""by hand""?"
,OverSun,2012-10-11T09:51Z,"I mean after I've put in the disk and it prompted me for an update I chose yes.
Then it tell me about ""you need to reboot to apply the update"". I did. During the reboot there were an update progress bar. After 100% there were some message about ""you need to reboot again"", I'm not shure exactly, I've just skipped it. The console continued to boot and successfully booted up after the update and the message. That was the first reboot, I've tried to play Dishonored then and it told me ""wrong region"". I've tried another backup and it told me ""This disk cannot be played"". I thought ""thats it, I'm screwed"". Turned off the console and then on. And it helped - the disk played. I've tried to swap it for Dishonored but got ""Wrong region"" again, dumped it and continued to play my previos back ups.
System info displays dashboard 2.0.15572.0 (new)."
,Rubbebubbe,2012-10-11T10:22Z,Ok...thank you very much for clarifying that for me  :-)
,flat123456789123456789,2012-10-11T11:23Z,"@OverSun So I have a PAL Xbox with LT3.0 so I should let it update and reboot 2 times? I'm downloading this 'cause I know for sure I will get ""Wrong region"" If I download the NTSC one.
Hope this update doesn't ruin anything man, if nothing happens then what is this update for?"
,OverSun,2012-10-11T13:08Z,"Guys, I'm not a prophet. I've just described how that worked for me.
The firmware itself may contain any kind of awful shit - late checks, remote triggered wipes implied by Microsoft and all that kind of stuff.
If you want to know what exactly this firmware carries - ask c4eva (LT author).
I just tell you that I've upgraded and backups plays. This doesn't mean that the firmware is safe. "
,gumph1688,2012-10-11T15:35Z,"mine keeps stopping on utorrent, the download bar goes red and i get a error, anyone else getting this?"

for those on LT+3 they can update by game disc but i prefer usb method "
,ahm3d2000,2012-10-16T04:13Z,yes the update is ok
,ahm3d2000,2012-10-16T04:17Z,"I can confirm fankoosh's comment, that the update from the game just updates the dashboard. The game itself seems to work well after the update.  I have LT 3.0. I hope that clears things up.

,HamatoYogi,2012-10-27T12:51Z,"Got the game working on xK3y, however, played some of it and the game gets stuck somewhere around the 2nd mission... anyone else had this problem?"
,jlbf0786,2012-10-30T05:54Z,"When I try to play it it says:

 ""This disc's region code is incorrect for this console."" 

I am on LT+2.0 "
,ahm3d2000,2012-11-09T09:26Z,"@ jlbf0786 

This game is PAL only, so make sure your xbox 360 can play PAL format. If u bought ur console in the US then it's more than likely that it can only run NTSC format - which would explain the error u are getting. And I would also upgrade nthe firmware to L.T 3.0 for XGD3 games.  "
,Daky1001,2012-11-19T21:11Z,"Thx for the up.
Works great."
