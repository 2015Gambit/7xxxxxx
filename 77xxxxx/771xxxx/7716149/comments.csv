[T],teslaman,2012-10-12T07:28Z,"Heh.... yes, this weeks 720p rip from DIMENSION also suffered one 1/2 second glitch at the 36:18min mark. 

But man... it's a TV broadcast, you really can't expect perfection. Back in the day, snow, ghosting and the like was common place. Yet we all still enjoyed our shows back then. :P Lets put it this way, I haven't seen any of the 720p lovers complaining about the glitches in the scene rips that I use as source. :P

I've downloaded and watched many shows over the years and they always suffer from broadcast glitches at some point. Nature of the beast.

You want to know something that is truly annoying? Those friggin' advertisements that take up 1/3 of the screen and distract you with all the flying around animated crap. I'll take glitches any day over having to see those things! :P"
