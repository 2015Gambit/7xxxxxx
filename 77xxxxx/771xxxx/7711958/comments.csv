,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-10-10T10:49Z,"This is legit.  Aside from it being STUPIDLY split into two files, it's actually a pretty good film."
,rosiet,2012-10-10T20:45Z,Good to see you Hackulus!
,Powerslave0,2012-10-11T04:29Z,"Yep, again, STUPIDLY split into 2 files.  Why?  They know people hate it, yet they continue to do it.  Ignorance..."

,tazturkey,2012-11-11T00:46Z,@Powerslave0 quit your belly-aching.  It doesn't bother me that it is split.  Hack takes the time to upload these flicks for us so why not just be thankful?
