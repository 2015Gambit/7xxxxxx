,unscarred786,2012-10-11T03:54Z,Does this fix the auto save feature?
,IndigoAK,2012-10-11T11:21Z,"The autosave feature works now, as of Reloaded's proper.  It actually always worked - I think the problem is that the game was unable to tell which autosave was which because of the bug with the time stamps."
