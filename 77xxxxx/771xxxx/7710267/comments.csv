,vecuccio,2012-10-10T08:33Z,Can confirm it works perfectly on XP64 - there is also a Nosteam patch of 110mb that you need to DL from their site too (the installation will automatically load their homepage with the link)
,vecuccio,2012-10-10T08:37Z,Works fine with XP64. You need to download the nosteam patch from their website too.

,Octavick,2012-10-13T23:49Z,I downloaded the game no problem and it plays fine except my saved games do not work when I load them it just starts me from the beginning of the level instead of where my save is any suggestions on how to fix this
,drwills,2012-10-14T03:55Z,I've also had the saving issue and I'm aware that there is a solution for SKIDROW but i haven't seen one for nosTEAM. If someone could find one it would be greatly welcomed. Thanks.
,BebePR,2012-10-14T17:29Z,please seed. 
[T],nosTEAM,2012-10-15T09:35Z,@ drwills  - check nosteam.ro website for solution about saving issue
,drwills,2012-10-15T10:45Z,^ The save fix works but i must advise people to not download it when the problem presents mid game but to download from the start as it eliminates any current saves you have. Thanks nosTEAM.
[T],nosTEAM,2012-10-15T18:08Z,"@ drwills

Before install update patch you must rename folder 3DMGAME to RELOADED from :

Windsws XP :                   C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersApplication Data
Windows Vista - 7 :          C:ProgramData

but you must enable Show hidden files and folders from Control Panel to see  that folders.

,asap_rob,2012-10-24T05:36Z,:( why dose it look laggy an foggy???
,asap_rob,2012-10-24T05:37Z,why dose it look laggy an foggy
,asap_rob,2012-10-24T05:45Z,an slow 
,jas1111,2012-10-28T23:12Z,Pls seeed..just started dl..
,Foolrkrum,2012-11-05T00:51Z,"Is this actually the full game, or is the pre-order content missing just as in the other releases? (I'm only asking since this one specifically says ""full game""; the others doesn't pretend to be ""full"")."
,lolpirate42,2012-11-05T22:12Z,seedddddddddddddd
,azkesz,2012-11-07T02:09Z,"the 111mb update from the site needs only 3 files (the ones that are missing/changed) which are:
in BinariesWin32
steam_rld.ini
Dishonored.exe
steam_api.dll

it's kind of a big waste having to download the entire 111mb just for those

Hint: use md5 crc checksum to find out when they are the same/different"
,jmonck1,2012-11-14T03:58Z,Thanks for the virus. You dick.
,warman61,2012-11-14T08:11Z,Any chance you could just seed out the patch?  It'd be way better than using that crap site you guys go through.  Separate torrent would be okay with me.
,WTFdudeWTF,2012-11-20T12:51Z,"thanks so much nosteam. I love your hard work!
for people who has slow frame rate/ game is laggy..
try to lower gameplay settings and resolution .. may be better"
