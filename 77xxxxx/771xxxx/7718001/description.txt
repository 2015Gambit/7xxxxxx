============================================

A TV show is turning the children of Fort Nightingale into zombies - but that's not the weirdest thing going on in the city! All of the adults have fallen into a stupor, their bodies motionless like living dolls. Could these strange episodes be linked to the disappearance of a nuclear bomb? And how are the orphans with glowing eyes connected to these events? 
 Enter this mystifying maelstrom as Clarrisa, a government agent that investigates unexplained phenomenon. Through her eyes, you'll search Fort Nightingale for clues, solve cunning puzzles and talk with the townspeople to get a bearing on the case. As each action takes you closer to a shattering revelation, you'll enjoy two unique styles of hidden object gameplay, delve into journals and other background materials, and marvel at cinematic interludes that set a new standard for adventure games. Are you afraid? Or will you step bravely toward the unknown?
