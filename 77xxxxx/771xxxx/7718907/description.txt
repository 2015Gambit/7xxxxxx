Ill Manors (stylised as ill Manors) is a British crime drama film
written and directed by Ben Drew, also known as Plan B. The film,
which is set in Forest Gate, London, revolves around the lives of
eight main characters, played by Riz Ahmed, Ed Skrein, Keith Coggins,
Lee Allen, Nick Sagar, Ryan De La Cruz, Anouska Mond and Natalie Press,
and features six original songs by Plan B, which act as a narration for
the film. Ill Manors is a multi-character story, set over the course
of seven days, a scene where everyone is fighting for respect.
The film focuses on eight core characters, and their circles of violence, as
they struggle to survive on the streets. Each story weaves into one
another, painting an ultra-realistic gritty picture of the world which
is on the brink of self-destruction. Each story is also represented by
a different Rap song.
