    The SKIDROW release doesnt properly handle the Steam API. As a result, the
     game does not show any required information when you load a saved game.
     So finding your wanted save game, is like fishing in the dark, because all
     saved games basically look the same. We included a screenshot on our ISO "

,[AU]StarScream,2012-10-10T12:09Z,This still doesn't save the options.
,[AU]StarScream,2012-10-10T12:13Z,The game works fine and all; it's just the save system that is messed up all the time.
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-10-10T12:52Z,"Download another proper crack from here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7713545/Dishonored.Real.Proper-Crack_Only-RELOADED

,phize,2012-10-10T16:42Z,"I just spent hours on a level, then died and found out that nothing had been saved."
,The_Probe,2012-10-10T21:21Z,"Doesn't seem to save control changes, brightness setting etc."
,ANDS_,2012-10-10T23:47Z,This one doesn't work with Skidrow release; at least not if you want to use save files from a previous version.  
,orange7,2012-10-11T01:49Z,Is there anyway to save your save games and transfer them with this crack?
,Frank23681,2012-10-11T03:16Z,Is it possible to fix it a bit more to save the options? Thanks FLT
,Aysey,2012-10-14T16:57Z,"I'm pretty new at thiss, If it says crack only, does it mean I need something else then this file?"
,Xeixis,2012-10-14T22:01Z,"Every time I start the game the screen turns black, lights up, then turns black again and it gives me an Error saying ""Windows has encountered a problem running the program.""
I have tried three different cracks and none work. 

HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,xRawrlinx,2012-10-17T18:29Z,"YOU CAN USE YOUR OLD SAVES WITH THIS CRACK!

You just need to transfer them to the new saves storage folder.

Move them from C:Users[YOURUSRNAME]AppDataLocalSKIDROW205100Storage

to: C:Users[YOURUSRNAME]AppDataLocalFLTSteam205100remote

If you're having problems finding the folder, do a windows search for 205100, make sure you put them in the NEW saves folder, it's the one with the FLT in the path. Your welcome!"
,xRawrlinx,2012-10-17T18:33Z,"Whoops, paths didn't show up properly. Also *You're* welcome! 

It's C: -> Users -> [YOURUSRNAME] -> AppData -> Local -> SKIDROW -> 205100 -> Storage

to the NEW SPOT: C: -> Users -> [YOURUSRNAME] -> AppData -> Local -> FLT -> Steam -> 205100 -> remote"
,Sir.Smokez.Alot,2012-10-18T07:26Z,"Would anyone mind explaining how and where you put the ""Binaries"" Folder?"
