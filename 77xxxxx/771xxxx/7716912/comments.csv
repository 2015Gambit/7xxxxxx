It is very simple with a 50.00$ TV tuner device that is usb and just plugs into a usb port. as long as you have a TV source, you just run a splitter and put one end of the coax cable in the other end of the TV tuner and record directly to your HD. Then edit out commercials and compress at about 4:1 and post it. Any one can do it."
[V],TheExecutive,2012-10-12T21:13Z,"OK, I remember your question from an earlier post. 

No, I would never record a show that way, because (1) I don't have cable anymore but AT & T -- a different kind of connection to get 200 channels.

and (2) I have the DVDs of this series and the specials and movies for a later era, so I'll just convert those to MP4 instead."
