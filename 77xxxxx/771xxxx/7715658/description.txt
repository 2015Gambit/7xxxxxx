"Things Just Got Real"

Marty and Debbie decide to make plans with their 
human friends after Larry and Jackie have become 
too entangled in their daily lives. The Weavers do 
their best to un-invite the Bird-Kersees, 
explaining they're afraid their friends won't be 
accepting of the aliens. But that doesn't stop 
Larry and Jackie from crashing Marty's' poker 
night and Debbie's girls' night on the town -- 
with hilarious results.

18/Very Slow
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
