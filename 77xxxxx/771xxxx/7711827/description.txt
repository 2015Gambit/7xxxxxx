Highway Thru Hell Season 1 Episode 4

Steep hills, lethal drop-offs, killer rockslides and wicked weather. These are a trucker's worst nightmares. But with urgent delivery deadlines and millions of dollars in cargo on the line, the Coquihalla Highway - 100 treacherous kilometres cutting through the heart of British Columbia's Cascade Mountains - is the only way to get the job done. And when something goes wrong, this highway needs heroes. HIGHWAY THRU HELL follows the men of Jamie Davis Heavy Rescue as they fight to keep open some of the most economically important, most travelled - and most inhospitable - trucking routes in North America.
