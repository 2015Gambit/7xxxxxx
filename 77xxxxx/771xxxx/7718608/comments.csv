[M],Hero,2012-10-12T14:49Z,swine666: The DVD is going to be released on October 30th. This is prolly a leaked copy.

Quality was what you expect from a normal dvdrip.
Movie was great 9/10."

Cool storyline, but after 10 mins in I realized it was a love story rather than a SciFi. Very female-oriented with a few laughable parts a straight male can enjoy.

Thank you for upload."
,botcrawl,2012-10-13T23:30Z,"There will be mixed reviews about this movie. It's very enjoyable, some parts were boring but the overall product is awesome. If this had bigger names, a large budget, and more firepower this could have been a 9/10 but is somewhere around a 7/10. I sill enjoy these actors much more than I would if it we're a blockbuster."

,TokinBC420,2012-10-14T00:41Z,"Unrelated to the film;  If i have removed a torrent from my Utorrent list in order to move to a different folder, is it possible to somehow continue seeding that torrent from its new home?? I'm becoming somewhat of a leecher because i'm OCD and everything has to be in it's correct place be it in my home, my life, and even my downloads folder.  If anyone has any insight on this it would be much appreciated.
also thx for upload, movie looks kinda funny mainly because aubrey plaza is in it"

,OnlyFax,2012-10-14T05:08Z,"Rate on audio quality, video quality, and movie quality on how the movie was captured!
1- BRRIP- BR stands for Blu-Ray and means the movie was ripped from a Blu-ray disc. It is in 1080p now the p stands for plasma ( the material the sun is made out of. There is 1080ng of plasma in a Blu-ray disc and a 1080p tv) and is called Blu-Ray because everything is blue tinted.
2. DVDRIP- DVD means Digital Video Decoder and this rip is not the movie itself but it is the code, to play this move just press CRTL+R and type the code! Usually in fair-good quality
3. CAMRIP- CAM stands for Complete Audio Movie and this will only be the audio, so please dont be a jerk and type A-10 V-0 because there is no video, duh!
4. TS RIP- TS stands for Television Static and all this means is the picture is fuzzy and when you rate video quality you only rate the picture on how fuzzy it is. ( Ex: V-2 almost completely fuzzy!)
Now please stop rating videos on your own scale ! "
,gitsome2,2012-10-14T05:47Z,"@OnlyFax Ummmm.... So, 1, I'm pretty sure a CAM rip, means the data was ripped from a Camera recording.... and there IS video on those.... SECONDLY, a TS is a Telesync, Idk where the fuck you got the idea it was for ""television static"". It means there's a camera at the screen, and usually a direct feed to the audio source."
,sconlan,2012-10-14T06:43Z,@gitsome2 He's clearly just a troll. No one could be so wrong about so many things without trying. Best not to feed him. It'll just make it more likely he and people like him will continue leaving stupid comments.
,porkor,2012-10-14T09:17Z,"rofl. Come on, OnlyFax is just joking. 
don't take him too seriously. 
""its called blu ray cos it's tinted blue"". lol
although the explanation for ""DVD"" could have used some more imagination.
such a pity that irony and retardedness are so often mistaken.

Anyway, switch to 1:18 to see the time machine for the very first time in the movie, just about 5 minutes before the movie ends (at least the machine exists! but you don't get to see any time travel, you only get to see the machine to disappear with some blue light..."
