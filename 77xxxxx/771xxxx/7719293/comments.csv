,LedBull,2012-10-24T20:33Z,"I asked this couple of time but no luck with a answer, maybe this time :-), when I download 720p movies I have problem with sound, picture and sound are not in sync, but when I download 1080p movie all is fine. I am talking about Yify's uploads. Does anyone have answer.
Thank you in advance! "
