The Story

The famous ship called Mayflower is trapped amidst a huge storm. The entire story is narrated by a church-mouse called William, from his viewpoint. The tale begins with the pilgrim preachers deciding to move to America and getting aboard Mayflower. However, because of the huge storm, the ship gets on the verge of sinking. Then, William, the pilgrim mouse, comes up with an idea to save the ship. When the pilgrims land safely, they write the Mayflower Compact and start constructing their new church and colony. However, it is already autumn season and they do not have much food stored for the winters. The pilgrims then learn to plant crops during the spring season and celebrate a big feast towards the onset of the autumn season or fall. This is their first Thanksgiving celebration.
