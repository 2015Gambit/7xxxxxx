Arts Documentary hosted by Bestor Cram, published by BSkyB in 2008 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

It was January 1968, a year that would be saturated in violence and historical change. Johnny Cash's 1968 concert at Folsom State Prison in California and the ensuing album became a symbol of the late 1960s and transformed his career.

Drawing from rock photographer Jim Marshall's stark images of that day, rare archival footage, as well as exclusive interviews with Cash's band, family and former Folsom inmates, Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison traces Cash's rocky road that led to the concert and the torrent of stardom and political debate that came after it.

Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison remains one of the greatest live albums ever made, and the man himself one of America's greatest troubadours and advocates for prison reform.

The album still resonates today with a rawness and authenticity that few recordings have ever achieved. This documentary film exposes a lesser known 'Man in Black', forever defined by darkness and light.
