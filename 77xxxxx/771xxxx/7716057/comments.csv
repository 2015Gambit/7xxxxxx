I suggest downloading and installing to see if it works on your device (not working on transformer or razr). If it doesnt work just leave all the data installed and wait for updated apk file.

,Chakun,2012-10-11T19:10Z,This isn't working for me. I'm getting some kind of message in Japanese. Any fix for this? Using Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
,fowlofthor,2012-10-11T19:46Z,Use luckypatcher to remove lic.
,Chakun,2012-10-11T20:30Z,Maybe stupid question. But where do I do that? On my phone or on PC with phone connected via USB?
,Chakun,2012-10-11T20:37Z,And where is the luckypatcher located? Cannot seem to find it. Thank you!
,fowlofthor,2012-10-11T20:47Z,I fixed the apk file but im not at a computer to make a torrent. Email me clayplummer@gmail.com and i will send it to you. Or anyone else who wants. No luckyptch needed and it ignores root.
