,dhjudasx,2012-10-11T08:44Z,"Depends on what you define as blur, I'm fairly picky. One could call it an over abundance of HDR or Bloom which makes things look extra soft or ""blurry"" in comparison. Clearly it's not always like this as you can see in the screenshots i've provided.. the quality is pretty well SPOT on if compared to a raw blu-ray copy of the frame. I've personally done this to try and fine tune the encoding, but also make sure i'm not causing ""other"" issues in the rest of the movie. Balance is key, and i do not see anyone anywhere remotely close to the file size for a 1080p copy of the movie. Even most of the 720p copies are larger file size. However... this is not to say a raw blu-ray isn't better.. clearly it is.. when your dealing with a blu-ray that is 25-50gb in size vs just a little over 2gb encode.

I just know working with some relatively highend displays.. the blu-ray itself has a lack of ""crisp"" clarity.. and it can't be fixed via encoding with filters to attempt to sharpen it without screwing up other things. I just don't see a point in uploading 4gb files or larger.... plenty of those already around."
