,tapavutatete,2012-10-10T16:31Z,"Here are some install instructions that worked for me with  The_Walking_Dead_Episodes_1_2_and_3_PC_Game___nosTEAM__
- copy/paste the walking_dead_104 folder into your install Pack folder
- (re)install the game (the_walking_dead.exe in the parent directory), otherwise episode not detected
- now the episode should be playable (if the game as a whole works objviously)
Hope this helps and thx uploader (not so boobish by the look of your account)

,bladix,2012-10-10T23:10Z,"I've got a problem bros, could anybody help?

So, I just copied Walking Dead Episode 4 in right directon, but something's went wrong. When I try to launch my save with all previous episodes, it's just dont respond. Everytime is reading only 1st episode. Another intresting fact is, that when I tried to create a new game and completed the first episode, it's just haven't saved it after credits. 

Plz, help me. I've got nonsteam version. Cheers."
,bladix,2012-10-10T23:34Z,*and I'm Ubuntu user (12.04). But everything was working fine until I copied episode 4.
,Kenan97,2012-10-11T11:26Z,Does it work with noSTeam versions?
,jck94,2012-10-11T11:37Z,ay waited ages for this thanks
,SN0000PY,2012-10-17T06:04Z,"daaaaamn i love that game,one of the best the last few years for sure."
,SN0000PY,2012-10-17T06:16Z,"ps: u must look in the pack folder from this torrent,everything else is useless. now copy the walking dead 104 folder and paste where u installed the game,also in the pack folder."
,sitnafup,2012-11-23T23:55Z,Is this exactly the same set of files as reloaded?
,sitnafup,2012-11-24T01:22Z,"Tried this one, but same issue as with reloaded.

Black screen when trying to play Ep 4

No problems at all with other eps."
