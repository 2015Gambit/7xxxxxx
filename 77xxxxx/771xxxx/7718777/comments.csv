,zoggnoff,2012-10-12T04:20Z,"NO crc error for me, perhaps tommy should figure out which file is bad and re-download it however i had no problem. 100 percent good & working"
,nadavkle,2012-10-13T00:11Z,It's all rars. Couldn't open it either.
,ptv83,2012-11-10T16:57Z,"THIS TORRENT IS DIRECTLY POINTED TO FROM A LYING COMMENT ON A EZTV UPLOAD .. the comment states that EZTV's up is a non-functioning RAR file when THIS is the RAR and EZTV's is NOT.

A rash of differing fake comments have appeared on EZTV up's lately from a varying number of fake accounts claiming all EZ's ups are password protected RAR's.

with seeing comments containing links to sceneline's up (which IS a fuckin RAR) i would acuse either sceneline or speed.cd private tracker of making these false comments on long time reputable uploader EZTV.

FUCK OFF

THERE IS NOTHING EVER WRONG WITH EZTV UP'S .. and if there is a rarely occuring error, a PROPER or Re-UP is in short order with an apology"
