Requesting a good cracker for DXTory!

The only working version of DXtory is 114, and there's already a 120! 

It makes me sad that people don't realize DXTory is far superior than Fraps, and yet, fraps is cracked the day after release.

tl;dr - We would all love you if you could find a working copy for dxtory 2.0.120"
,GigoloAunt111,2012-10-15T15:50Z,"Was having the crash on day 2 (like most others) even with the update v1.0.0.2. For me, I got around the problem by dropping my graphics settings all to minimum, no AA, no AF, no bloom etc. Once I got past the 'crash spot' I changed graphics back up to maximum ...all good :)
Try it, it may work 4 u 2! "
,biteme1011,2012-10-18T00:51Z,For some reason I could not run the setup exe in this update. All it would do is allow me to choose a language then the program would close. I was desperate so I copied the content from the skidrow folder anyways and pasted it in my install folder and guess what!? NO MORE CRASHES!! I am not sure how it worked but just overwriting the game exe with this new one fixed the crashing problems. The game now runs perfectly and I am almost finished it.
,Brioli,2012-11-04T19:35Z,"Having the same problem as the others with Sherlock Holmes-The Testament. I've applied the 1.0.0.2 update and lowered all graphic settings to try and get past the Westgate Jail part to no avail. I noticed some said the patch fixed this for them, but it didn't work for me. I'm running Windows Vista 32bit and getting the following error:

Hoping you have a fix for this soon or am I missing one? Thanks for all your hard work."
,Brioli,2012-11-05T14:05Z,ok...my bad...just realized I had to copy the new crack from the v1.0.0.2 update files to the Program Files>Focus>Frogwares>The Testament of Sherlock Holmes folder. Now it works...so for those who can't get it to work after the update...be sure to copy the new SKIDROW files in the update folder and overwrite the old crack. Great game again SKIDROW..thank you
