Here is my October collection of dark wallpapers.


Mostly all of them are very dark, some are High Resolution, some are not.


I don't use the cheesy "Happy Halloween" papers you see around, some of these are pretty creepy.


Hope you enjoy the collection!


Please comment and please seed.
