,Oxmaster,2012-10-11T22:06Z,Works!
,FofinhoX,2012-10-11T23:40Z,Ok... Crack me my game stop working. Any ideas?
,XxSaigoxX,2012-10-11T23:50Z,"It's legit. I was hesitant at first since it's released by Anonymous, but it does work. "
,XxSaigoxX,2012-10-11T23:53Z,It's legit. @FofinhoX did you launch it with Borderlands2.exe or launcher.exe? You want to use Borderlands2.exe
,Code101,2012-10-12T00:19Z,I'm going to wait till more people can confirm this works.
,Evan_85,2012-10-12T00:44Z,"It works.

Keep in mind that it still needs some .dll from Steam, so you need to install it. 

It doesn't need to be updated, or even running.

And make sure to run the Borderlands2.exe, not the launcher."
,Crivil,2012-10-12T00:55Z,Borderlands2.exe crashes (not using launcher). Obvious game worked beofre applying this.
,_Eleison_,2012-10-12T02:37Z,90% sure this doesn't work. it DOES cause the Borderlands2.exe to crash.
,spikeabercrombie,2012-10-12T03:16Z,need 1.1.1 now
,XxSaigoxX,2012-10-12T03:39Z,I haven't had any crashes at all. Level 9 Mechromancer in Frostburn Canyon. 
,butthead699,2012-10-12T06:08Z,"Works for me as well, but you need the v1.10 update installed and overwrite that with this."
,muff1nman,2012-10-12T07:41Z,Yeah crashes on splash screen. I patched to 1.0.3 using the Skidrow release before this. Saigo did you patch from release or from 1.0.3 as well I feel like that might be my problem.
,ciroko,2012-10-12T08:40Z,"Borderlands.2.Mechromancer.DLC+UPDATE.V1.1.0
before using this crack, have this dlc"
,takaregal,2012-10-12T14:48Z,doesn't work for me
,Nanijirobi,2012-10-13T08:00Z,"Doesnt work for me, had the DLC installed prior to updating."
,smaulik,2012-10-14T03:02Z,please!!! Someone make the crack for Borderlands 2 v1.1.1. This is not working!!!
,i7_Dangerous,2012-10-14T10:46Z,"Im the person who uploaded this. It works, but I packed these files together intended for people who updated to 1.1.0 before a nosteam crack was available, and were running the game through steam/greenluma. If you updated any other way, odds are these files will not help you. "
,smaulik,2012-10-14T13:23Z,"to i7_dangerous

I updated my borderlands through steam. I have the original game but I hate steam so I am looking for a crack.

If you look into the steam news then you will notice that steam has released a new update v1.1.1 on 10th October. That's why your crack might not be working. So if you can find the crack for v1.1.1 then please upload it."
,i7_Dangerous,2012-10-16T01:16Z,"1.1.1 cracks are easy to find, they are all just packed into an installer alongside dlc. "
,Eimantas,2012-10-16T12:00Z,I dont how to use it :(
,Eimantas,2012-10-16T12:05Z,Please help me I dont now how to install crack
