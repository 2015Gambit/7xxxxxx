,Wolffie80,2012-10-12T11:01Z,Is it so? Can this be? Real???? any1?
,portydert,2012-10-12T11:03Z,Seems legit. A pink skull posted this...
,catpuke,2012-10-12T12:03Z,It's probably a rip of that R5 that was doing the rounds a week or so ago. I could be wrong though...
,Pvt_Sandersons,2012-10-12T12:55Z,"pfffffffff
how hard is it to put a screenshots?"
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-10-12T13:20Z,"@wolffie: Nope, not a blu-ray rip, if that's what you mean by the 'is it real' question. Blu-ray actually being released in December so don't expect to see a legit BR rip anytime before mid-November."
,sk8micke,2012-10-12T15:44Z,"pretty good for a cam but still a cam! a film like this deservs more than a cam! 
a-7
v-7"
,catpuke,2012-10-12T17:07Z,"It's not a cam, it's an R5."
,blfunser,2012-10-12T17:34Z,"NOT R5 crap quality and ts sound. if this is R5 than its the worst one ever, also sound out of sync in big nkv file.

last time i dl a movie before it comes out as dvd/brrip!!!!!!!!!!"
,Kanegasi,2012-10-12T19:02Z,It's a cam of an R5.
,catpuke,2012-10-12T19:25Z,"@blfunser

I'm sure your ISP will be grateful for that and your grammar teacher is thoroughly embarrassed."
,catpuke,2012-10-12T19:27Z,"No, it's an R5 of a cam of an R5..."
,127985,2012-10-13T00:03Z,lol

,BUTT_SEX,2012-10-14T01:09Z,I like to squeeze cats til they puke all over!
,ungraph,2012-10-14T01:21Z,Definitely a cam. Next time include screenshots or refrain from posting bullshit DarkLord2011.
,JeffCC,2012-10-14T01:51Z,its R5 of a CAM of an R5 with R5 Audio and TS Video of a CAM
,blamneng,2012-10-14T04:26Z,when will a DVDrip or BRrip will be out?
,dewy195,2012-10-14T22:27Z,DVD Release 12-04-12
,Midnight_Rider-69,2012-10-15T12:35Z,This copy is CINAVIA-PROTECTED. So don't waste any time trying too play it at your BlueRay-player. Probably the same with PS3...No problem playing it on your PC :((
[T],DarkLord2011,2012-10-15T22:30Z,Hey fuck you guys just be happy that this movie is up and in good Quality -.- its whatceble so shut fuc up retard
,JudasRein,2012-10-16T01:18Z,"Regardless of whether it's watchable or not, it's still labeled incorrectly. If you had a DVDrip and labeled it a Blu-ray rip, you would still get shit for it. Nobody is complaining about the quality, only your false label."
,Pvt_Sandersons,2012-10-16T14:58Z,"+1 to JudasRein 

DarkLord, i  think the skull is too much for you"
,skoxpress,2012-10-18T03:56Z,".......you guys are killing me. Reading this has to be better than the R5 or cam of..well, you know...LMAO"
,Orwell-84,2012-10-27T13:13Z,Dark dude.. hang loose.. ppl take it WAAAAYYY to serious... its like you get paid for this and dont make a mistake! really.. fuck off to those who dont appreciate it.. whoops... can you count the toothpicks i just dropped forest?  WOW ;) 
,Ouzotime,2012-10-29T04:59Z,@DarkLord2011 this is what u wrote...Hey fuck you guys just be happy that this movie is up and in good Quality -.- its whatceble so shut fuc up retard...u are the retard for mislabeling an upload make up yr mind is it good quality or is it watchable(u misspelled it any how...spell check dipstick so fuck u...put the pink skull up yr arse...enough said..
,Bapman,2012-10-29T20:34Z,"Mislabelled.
NOT an R5
NOT true 720p.
Increasing video's resolution during encode doesn't turn something into higher quality.
As TS ... good quality.
As r5 ... crap quality.
As 720p ... dogsh|t quality."
,negativeions,2012-11-01T09:24Z,"obviously, DarkLord is a PR guy who works for the studio. That explains why he sounds like a stupid sack of shit who can't spell. Eat your mom's dick asshole."
,negativeions,2012-11-01T09:26Z,This loser still rips with xvid when everyone is using the far superior avc and aac. Suck your mom's dick.
,JoonBoy,2012-11-02T11:05Z,"Oh for gods sake, stop asking if it is real! Just download and find out for yourself... -_-"
,MrPigface,2012-11-03T05:31Z,"@Ouzotime - For someone who can't spell the simplest of words yourself, I don't think 'you' not 'u' should be giving out advice on spelling or grammar for that matter. So DarkLord2011 may have labeled this torrent incorrectly, we all make mistakes right buttercup? ('your' is not spelt 'yr' by the way and you also forgot your ending bracket ---->)."
,spex420,2012-11-04T06:05Z,I fell like everybody thinks they're professionals like just give a a/v quality feedback rating and move the fuck on nobody cares if its r5 r3 b2 911 if your rating a 2a1v obviously its a shitty quality PLUS ITS FREE so stop your fucking whining Dark_Lord didnt have to put this up and you didnt have to watch it  
,DJeez91,2012-11-06T06:24Z,"It is fucked up to try and pass this off as a good copy with your ""720p"" bullshit. 
You are better than that I hope. Reword it to say ""shitty version"""
,ch3y3zze,2012-11-07T08:27Z,"dark lord u r a fucking faggot get this shit outta here, do pirate bay admins even exist????"
,ch3y3zze,2012-11-07T08:28Z,where is the minus sign so i can vote this the fuck down
,mrtorrentdan,2012-11-08T06:05Z,"Hey negativeions,.....when was the last time you uploaded something?!? Why don't you give the guy a break?!? Better yet...why don't you just go kill yourself you sad little piece of shit?!?"
,DJeez91,2012-11-08T06:32Z,"He doesn't get a break for uploading this shit.
Why do it? Who wants to see this?
We are doing the right thing and making sure he knows what he's doing is wrong and nobody wastes their time and downloads this terrible, terrible copy.
If I uploaded something, I wouldn't do a shitty upload."
,pjones452,2012-11-11T11:06Z,dont worry this movie should be released in HD on november 20-21st so I would just wait a week 
,accordinglydone,2012-11-11T14:13Z,im with mrtorrentdan when is the last time any of you uploaded anything?  and are we seriously complaining about the quality of the free movies we are watching before they are even released if you dont like this dont watch it its that simple.  the uploader obviously doesnt have a problem with it and apparently about 1655 other people currently dont either. leave your a/v rating and go the fuck on.  if you dont like it download something else or wait with your thumb in your ass for it to come out on BR
