,genocide44,2012-10-09T16:54Z,MP4SUS@ is there no pixelation glitches in this episode?
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-09T17:05Z,"Glitch free (not perfect, but I'm 99% sure)

I've taken a stance - no posting of LOL / DIMENSION sources unless I've viewed it to be glitch free.

When I find a glitch I post it on the first instance of LOL & EIMENSION (i.e. - 666.Park.Avenue.S01E02)

I trust the rest of the gang (EVOLVE is great), so I don't prescreen anyone but LOL / DIMENSION

[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-09T17:48Z,"That seemed a bit wishy-washy of me.

Let me be clear - I certify this episode as glitch / pixelation free.

I took the time to watch it before posting and that gave me the time to do a proper XVID encode.

If it's a LOL / DIMENSION episode and I've encoded an XVID - I certify it glitch / pixelation free.

Unlike 2.Broke.Girls.S02E03 - Glitch @ 00:24
Which I'll encode when the WEB-DL shows up.

Thank you for your patronage - if a mistake is found, i'll happily refund every cyber cent I can find."
,genocide44,2012-10-09T17:56Z,"thanks mp4sux ,I have had issues with LOL and FOV and agree  they arent good quality ,but internal AVG and evolve have been good with no problems."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-10T02:57Z,"Don't recall much of a problem with FOV.

2HD, ASAP, LMAO & a couple of others have a bad entry once in a blue moon.

The LOL / DIMENSION problem is twofold.

1) on eps they damage, there is usually NOT an alternative until a WEB-DL shows up.

2) The whole reason I got into this is due to their current MP4 fiasco - I documented 77 glitches and they would not stop putting out damaged product - and they still continue. From a third to half of all thier postings are ""pixelated"" as you put it.

Complaining did no good - ""The Scene"" used to correct their mistakes, but rarely do now.

The sick thing is the guiding document that mandated MP4 since about February claimed ""quality"" as the reason.

Perfect XVID AVI is ALWAYS better than damaged MP4 any day ofthe week.

Don't forget LOL used to put out flawless AVI for near a decade (XOR was the problem way back when).

Oh, and one more thing - NOBODY (5% at most) uses MP4 on purpose - movie & DVD rips ALWAYS come out in XVID. If MP4 were truly superior, it would have slowly taken over the field and except for this one mandate - nobody switches voluntarily.
