,jdandy,2012-10-11T02:54Z,"This is a great torrent! Many thanks for the upload!!

We need some SEEDERS PLEASE!!!"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-10-11T19:24Z,"Ty bro :)
A second seed is present now with me and a third seed should start tonight if all is ok anyway.
Quality of this BD25's movie as reconversion made by us is sincerely very good.
Source comes from seed from ""NUPPLE"" from here to TPB concerning the Full BD's movie 2D/3D for a 47 GB size.
Due to huge size of this first one,we will seed 2 different separated versions,as 2D and 3D version so.
Many thanks to ""NUPPLE"" for his great upload anyway.
Btw,our third seed should normaly be started directly from one of our two quad bi-xeon servers asap.
We have to upgrade few little stuff concerning its hardware before that.
Afterwards if all is ok,our third seed will immediatley start then.
Be patient and stay tuned so...
Ty for understand
best regards"
,MikeyMetal,2012-10-19T12:04Z,2006? WTF?!
