,Sinma,2012-10-09T22:19Z,Is it just me or does the game fail to save no matter what?
,redchampagne,2012-10-09T23:39Z,"Unzipped the file, game runs perfect, but does not save :( Tried running as administrator, files aren't ""Read-Only""... Ideas?"
,Tokage420,2012-10-10T00:35Z,"Same issue, Save failure 

Going to try some things and ill post if i figure it out!!

Great Game Btw 
Thnx Uploader :)"
,qanwyler,2012-10-10T01:40Z,"Here's what I can contribute as to why it's not letting you save:

- The game appears to enable the read-only attribute on whatever folder it's located in.  It does this constantly; the second the user manually changes it, it sets it back.

A proper crack will probably involve some modded EXE that removes this minor little copy-protection scheme.  (I wonder how the game operates normally?  Somehow it's able to determine it's pirated, maybe by accessing the internet?  Maybe someone who's just downloaded it can try disabling their internet access before they run it for the first time -- a long shot, but who knows... might help.)

So I guess we'll be waiting a little longer before we're playing Story Mode.  Such is the life of a pirate."
,Green.Banana,2012-10-10T01:54Z,"Such is the life with hasty uploads.  ""DOOD I GOT IT, I'LL TOTALLY GET VIP STATUS FOR UPLOADING!""  Is that really how it's gonna work?  "
,Kenji99,2012-10-10T02:13Z,Why is this version only 1/3 the size of the THETA one?
,Green.Banana,2012-10-10T02:29Z,That's a good question.  Why is that?  
,clipsh0w,2012-10-10T03:52Z,"Just tried DLed it and installed/played with internet connection off, the read-only issue still remains."
,qanwyler,2012-10-10T05:14Z,"@Kenji99 Assuming because the THETA version both includes an installer, and actually saves.

I'd advise everyone to let this torrent die, and then just seed the THETA."
,girtas_123,2012-10-10T16:24Z,"Sorry for hastily uploading the game, I was not aware this copy had a save issue :( But the game works fine otherwise, so while this torrent lives, consider this a sort of demo if you're planning to buy it :)"

,jaime_lex,2012-10-20T20:36Z,¿Does anyone have the link to the latest version available (v1.03)?
,jaime_lex,2012-10-21T06:24Z,What is the latest version that is in the Humble Store?
,whatthefuckpassword,2012-10-27T19:22Z,"You're getting it for free, but you're still whining for the latest version.  If you want the latest version so bad, why not buy it yourself and share the link with us?

v1.04: http://torrents.humblebundle.com/retro_city_rampage-1.04-setup.exe.torrent

The GOG version apparently has extra content - that's some bullshit right there, I bought it from the official website, but still got screwed.  Can someone please post a link (or upload) the GOG version?"
