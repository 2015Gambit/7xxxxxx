[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-11T00:16Z,"Hey riverchase. I responded to you on the last request you made for this.

I don't normally do any kind of superhero books, or if I do they tend to be the weird, alternative sort. I checked on this one, and I can probably get it for you fairly easy, but I want to be sure I'm grabbing the right thing. If you could take a look at the comicbookdb and let me know for sure which run you need I'll do my best to provide it."

Thank you for being you for us. "
