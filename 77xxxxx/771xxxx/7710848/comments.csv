Yes this for Railworks 2013 the performance in 2012 is Horrible is a Slowmotion with 16 fps! When you use only the Coach Cars without the F40 Loco the Performance is much more better.

A Greatful Thank to Mr. TBP_For _Ever!!"

,kolbasz25,2012-10-19T12:20Z,i cant see the train in the game any ideas why? (i copied everything into the right place)
,tpb_4_ever,2012-10-24T04:55Z,"The routes folder is slighty wrong.

It should be like this please correct it:

Content/Routes/0032xxxxxxx

And do a search of all .out files in the zip before installing this and change the extension to .lua
Tat should gix up the probelm"
,monsmeg,2012-11-20T14:28Z,"Thanks for the download guys but a question - when I use 7zip on this file, I get one error per file and a file structure full of empty files??  Should I be using another zip program?  Keep up the good work!"
