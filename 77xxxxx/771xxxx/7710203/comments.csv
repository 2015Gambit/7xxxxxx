,ludachriz,2012-10-09T15:35Z,I have never downloaded a crack only before but how do i use it? I already downloaded the 3DM version but i wanted this v5 version
,Silvak,2012-10-09T16:02Z,"exactly where it tells you to in the Installation Notes: 

COPY CRACK 5.0 file components in your game directly."
,Klimt_Westwood,2012-10-09T19:14Z,Can someone confirm this works on win XP?
,ZDay34,2012-10-09T21:34Z,Works great!
,Kindergaten,2012-10-09T21:37Z,"I upload a video in you tube, just search for my channel, gligar2tennyson "
,MrTTAO,2012-10-10T00:53Z,"Game works, ovwriting saves (including the quicksave) does NOT update the time/date on the save which results in saves being out of order if using overwrites. As well as trouble accessing the quicksave file.

Anyone knows if this is a bug in the crack or a bug in the game itself?"
,sirwootalot,2012-10-10T06:23Z,"This crack barely works - the game starts, but for some reason it's *insanely* laggy. I'm running Windows 7 64 bit, and this is the first game I have seen lag in on my system whatsoever. Anyone else getting this or know how to fix it?"
,AliStarr,2012-10-10T14:45Z,"Great up! Will seed.

Working on win7 SP1 64bit"
,sirwootalot,2012-10-10T15:02Z,"Nevermind my previous comment - i'm dumb and my graphics card was just overheated from the several days of leaving my computer on for downloads, with fans at a low setting so it wouldn't keep me up overnight. Now that everything's cooled off it works fantastic so far."
,mrholmes,2012-10-10T21:34Z,"thanks mang, works great."
,lytheman,2012-10-11T07:04Z,The autosave wont work. What do I do?
,oryan749,2012-10-11T09:15Z,"i have downloaded the normal 3DM and have progressed quite a bit through the game, i can't find the save directory? because i want to backup my saves before using the new crack."
,oryan749,2012-10-11T09:19Z,nvm found the save directory. its in C:Program Data3DMGAME3DMGAME205100Storage 
,Fleck99,2012-10-11T11:19Z,"Works 100%, Win7 x64"
,MrTTAO,2012-10-11T18:54Z,"lytheman said: ""The autosave wont work. What do I do?""
@lytheman: Save manually"
,ivory_soul,2012-10-12T11:35Z,"For people complaining about auto save, F5 is your best friend."
,Jahuty,2012-10-12T13:00Z,"Be careful I was about 5 hours into the game.  I saved via Esc save game.  Loaded the game up this morning, and all my saved games are gone comepletely.  I dont know where the save files are to check if they are still there but it no longer allows me to load or continue my game.  This probably just turned me off the game completely."
,Jahuty,2012-10-12T13:15Z,"Also, Crash within 5 minutes of the fucking game this is getting ridiculous "
,ivory_soul,2012-10-15T13:28Z,"@Jahuty I had the same problem, but found out this new crack puts saves in a different spot. I found the old save folder, moved the files, and the saves loaded up. The original location was C:Program Data3DMGame205100

I moved it to DocumentsMy GamesDishonoredDishonoredGameStorage and it loaded up. This new crack moves the save games for some reason.

To all the people complaining about crashes try running malware scans. I haven't had a single crash yet and I'm 3/4 through the game running at 60FPS."
,kkeenn123,2012-10-29T05:14Z,"Fuck me man
You haven't fixed the month/day/year glitch?
It's ok, everything else works fine."
,Foolrkrum,2012-10-29T21:17Z,Anyone know where to get the pre-order content?
,altsi,2012-10-31T16:08Z,"Still no fix for the save month/day/year? 
Also, if I installed skidrow's release, would I be able to load my 3DM version savefiles on it?

I've finished the game.. only the save month/day/year problem. Never crashed. Just remember the name of you mission. 

(Note: If the savefile starts with MISSION - ""mission name"" that save loads the beginning of the mission.)"
,DarkPilgr1m,2012-11-02T20:46Z,I instal to my game czech language and problem with save month/day/year are fixed...
