,gsd103,2012-10-14T00:29Z,Than You Nepotu! Time Warner has us hostage here in Los Angeles so keep them coming.
,gsd103,2012-10-14T00:35Z,"Would be cool if we could somehow get this with only an hour delay :0 

If this Time Warner crisis goes into the regular season, I believe a market will be open for nzb/torrents of laker games. "
