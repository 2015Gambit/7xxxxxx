Got a few 'add-ons' in this batch. I hate 'em, but sometimes they're necessary. 

I previously uploaded issues 1-18.5, here we have...


Issues 19-20 of 'The Acme Novelty Library'

Self-Published, Distributed by Drawn & Quarterly, 2008 & 2010

Written and Illustrated by Chris Ware

Issue 19 continues the Rusty Brown story and contains a few short stories as well

Issue 20 is one full-length Jordan Lint story, and it's a good one. Powerful storytelling. I just sat quietly when I was done, thinking back over what I had just read, and how wondering how much of it had actually happened to the author (if any.. or all?).
