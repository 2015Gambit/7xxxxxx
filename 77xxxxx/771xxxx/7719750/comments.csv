I was wondering if you plan on uploading or if you even have the Hellboy spinoffs like Abe Sapien or Lobster Johnson or Sir Edward Grey, Witchfinder. I used to get it from Demonoid but since that's not an option it'd be great if someone could upload the new issues here. "

As far as the Mignola series go, if you change the drop down menu to comics and search for Hellboy (or whatever it is you're looking for), I think those first two torrents have pretty close to everything (or you'll find them under the name of the book you're searching for). Otherwise, for the more recent stuff, search for 0-day, find what you're looking for in the file lists and tell everything else not to download once the torrent has opened.

I do have complete runs on all that stuff, but one of my major goals is to not upload files that are already available. But if you can't get everything you're looking for put together, let me know and I'll do what I can to help."
