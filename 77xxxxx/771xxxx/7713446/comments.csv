,my3angels,2012-10-10T14:31Z,thank you so much i love these movies :)
,kebentoy23,2012-10-10T15:52Z,"thank you so much for this upload ez! two thumbs up! :) by the way, when are you going to upload the dark night rises? :)"
,obliveron,2012-10-10T22:27Z,3.5 out of 10 on imdb lol. thanks for uploading it but i don't know why ppl would be asking for such a bad movie. well anyway the dark knight rises isn't out on dvd til dec 4 2012 so ask for it all you want. but even as good as the uploaders are they cant upload a dvd quality movie when the dvd quality doesn't exists yet. i mean sometimes you get lucky and they get released in other English speaking country's before they do here so they can nab a copy and upload it here but its not very common.
,rv0206,2012-10-11T16:29Z,A/V please
,omegareds,2012-10-11T17:39Z,"1 FUCKING FILE PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!! WHO THE HELL STILL USES CD'S & IF THEY DO FUCK'EM!!! IT TAKES TOO LONG TO JOIN THEM & QUAILITY DEGRADES!!!!!!!!! STILL THANKS FOR UP LOAD! BUT CATER TO THE MAJORITY NOT THE BACKWARDS IDOTS, STILL ON CD"
,mywhitenobody,2012-10-11T20:49Z,ok this is broken into 2 CDs instead of 1 whole file. My problem is the scenes start over lapping and replaying then skipping about 35 mins into the film. Thought it was VLC media player but it was also doing it in windows media player as well. Thanks for the upload but i think ill wait for another file
,jfhjr,2012-10-13T11:25Z,"Piece of crap up - skips whole segments then skips back - somebody must hate Madea cause this is a crappy rip, if it's even a rip. "
,HamoDude,2012-10-13T23:54Z,"**ERROR SPECIFICATIONS DO NOT DOWNLOAD**

~From the halfway mark to the end of CD1, repeated scenes and also it skipped through like 30 minutes in~

Please EXTREMEZONE upload a proper rip. I can only imagine the hard work and patience you put in for TPB. We really appreciate your dedication and efforts."

If you want a 1 file avi rip then download another. Don't give extremezone shit for it. They do all that hard work to upload these files for us to use for free. So basically your bitching over something you didn't even pay for. None of us want to hear it. Just leave a comment noting that this upload has a few errors. You can't get every upload perfect, but extremezone does one hell up a job. Overall 99.9% perfection on all uploads. Thanks extremezone!"
