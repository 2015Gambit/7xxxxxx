The day has arrived for Phil and Claire to
drop Haley off at college, which is a
difficult moment for any parent, but it's
made worse when they manage to really
embarrass Haley. Meanwhile, Manny forces Jay
and Gloria to take a baby class: they humor
him and go, but end up being a bit of a
disruption and Mitch and Cam drop Lily off
for the first day of kindergarten, but when
she gets into a tussle with another little
boy, they end up having a meeting with the
boy's confrontational lesbian parents
