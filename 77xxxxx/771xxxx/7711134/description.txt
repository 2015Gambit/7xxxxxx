Of Orcs and Men first puts you into the role of an elite Orc soldier from
the legendary legion of Bloodjaws, a league of warriors deeply involved in
the war opposing the Orcs and Goblins on one side to their persecutors,
Humankind. As a veteran warrior who has seen the most brutal of battles, you
are appointed by the Orc commander to complete a mission that could change
the course of the war: kill the one man responsible for all of this bloodshed,
the one who has, for years, exhorted the human masses to loathe and fight
the green-skinned people: the Emperor himself.
