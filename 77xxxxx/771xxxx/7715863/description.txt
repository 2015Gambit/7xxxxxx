In search of a future that may not exist and faced with the decision of who to share it with, Cassia journeys to the Outer Provinces in pursuit of Ky ΓÇö taken by the Society to his certain death ΓÇö only to find that he has escaped, leaving a series of clues in his wake.

CassiaΓÇÖs quest leads her to question much of what she holds dear, even as she finds glimmers of a different life across the border. But as Cassia nears resolve and certainty about her future with Ky, an invitation for rebellion, an unexpected betrayal, and a surprise visit from Xander ΓÇö who may hold the key to the uprising and, still, to CassiaΓÇÖs heart ΓÇö change the game once again. Nothing is as expected on the edge of Society, where crosses and double crosses make the path more twisted than ever.
