 Are you a triathlete, runner, cyclist, swimmer, cross-country skier, or other athlete seeking greater endurance? The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing teaches athletes how to stay healthy, achieve optimal athletic potential, and be injury-free for many productive years. 

 Dr. Philip MaffetoneΓÇÖs approach to endurance offers a truly ΓÇ£individualizedΓÇ¥ outlook and unique system that emphasizes building a strong aerobic base for increased fat burning, weight loss, sustained energy, and a healthy immune system. Good nutrition and stress reduction are also key to this commonsense, big-picture approach.

 In addition, Dr. Maffetone dispels many of the commonly held myths that linger in participatory sportsΓÇöand which adversely impact performanceΓÇöand explains the ΓÇ£truthsΓÇ¥ about endurance, such as:
 * The need to train slower to race faster will enable your aerobic system to improve endurance
 * Why expensive running shoes can actually cause foot and leg injuries
 * The fact that refined carbohydrates actually reduce endurance energy and disrupt hormone balance
 * And more.

 If you are looking to increase your endurance and maximize your athletic potential, The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing is your one-stop guide to training and racing effectively.
