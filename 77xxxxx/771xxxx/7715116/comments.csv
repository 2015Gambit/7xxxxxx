ffmpeg -i ./4x24 Reign of Gunthers.ogx -vcodec copy -acodec copy ~/4x24 - Reign of Gunthers.mkv
to convert the .ogx. After that, mkvinfo outputs:

,Artfail,2012-10-16T02:06Z,"Thank you The9mm and 23545427 for the upload, and thank you neptoess for the ffmpeg reminder! I'd forgotten I ever downloaded that. Not that you need to be giving tech advice, but I wonder if you might have an idea why terminal returns an ""unknown format"" error when taking your advice. It also throws up ""[matroska @ 0x5597b8]Matroska demuxer version 1 too old for file version 2"" ... I know the ffmpeg binaries are old, but I'm not sure why it's having trouble. Penny for your thoughts?"
,Artfail,2012-10-16T02:17Z,"Why is it that simply posting a comment always solves my problem? Please ignore my last, forgot to redirect the terminal window to updated ffmpeg in /usr/local/bin. Durr."
