The story goes that Mikolaj Trzaska, a longtime fan of McPhee, sought out Trio
X at a performance in Krakow in 2006 to ask if he could play with the
group. With that meeting, a plan evolved for a 2007 tour with the support of
Not Two Records owner, Marek Winiarski. Trzaska and Trio X together became the
group Magic. The two-disc set, Magic, documents the 2007 tour in Poland.

Given the improvisational expertise of McPhee on alto sax, clarinet and pocket
trumpet, of Trzaska on alto sax and bass clarinet, Duval on bass, and Jay Rosen
on drums, this recording imparts more than anyone could expect. The musicians
inspire and interact with one another in exceptionally intricate and subtle
ways. The smallest details of the playing fill volumes of space with
intelligent musical conversation, no matter whether one, two, three or all four
are involved in the improvisation. The instrumental layering is so clear and
unique that listening is an extraordinarily fulfilling challenge. There is
bubbling and boiling, but absolutely no mayhem...
