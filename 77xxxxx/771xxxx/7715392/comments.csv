,jessfranc,2012-10-11T04:12Z,"I would like to request restored versions of all the underground and alternative horror comics such as Taboo (TPB anthology series),
Fly in my Eye (TPB anthology series), etc.
Also, I would love to see Hypnotic Tales (TPB) by Richard Sala and any other work by him and Charles Burns which hasn't been previously uploaded.  Thank you in advance."
