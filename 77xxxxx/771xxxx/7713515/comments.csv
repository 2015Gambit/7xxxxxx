,oneneo,2012-10-10T12:30Z,"Does this also ""overwrite"" saves? I can't seem to find a save game folder, tikasukaz. Do you have any idea where it might be? Thanks in advance."
[T],tikasukaz,2012-10-10T13:26Z,"@oneone

If you already have game, why not get Crack only Reloaded ? 

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7713569/Dishonored.Real.Proper-Crack_Only-RELOADED

No one has reported overwrite of save game. But for safety better to take backup, takes only 1min :)

Save game location:

C:UsersMyNameDocumentsMy GamesXCOM - Enemy UnknownXComGameSaveData


Enjoy !

,vargth,2012-10-10T13:27Z,Saves are stored in the appdata local folder.It's hidden by default
,vargth,2012-10-10T13:38Z,Does anyone know why reloaded version is about 500mb bigger?
,susulock,2012-10-10T16:24Z,Why is this 500MiB bigger than the SKIDROW version? Does this have something that the SKIDROW version doesn't??
,qbertprime,2012-10-10T21:33Z,It's bigger because it's not RARed.
,bambam299,2012-10-11T01:30Z,"Is anyone else having a problem with Crashing?

I get to the first loading screen and the game just shuts down every time."
,susulock,2012-10-11T01:50Z,"@qbertprime Incorrect. SKIDROW's version is also not RARed. Once again, ""Why is this 500MiB bigger than the SKIDROW version? Does this have something that the SKIDROW version doesn't??"""
,qbertprime,2012-10-11T02:07Z,"@susulock - Oh, sorry. I thought it was! I remember now though, I still wonder why they bother with the RARing, since it doesn't really compress the already compressed ISO (or whatever) format, and just makes your hard drive and cpu crunch more. Of course .torrent makes the convenience of the many parts irrelevant...
@bambam299 There is a fix to the crack here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7714650/Dishonored.Fix-RELOADED SORRY if it's not cool to post links!"
,zashloop,2012-10-11T02:23Z,@susulock yes reload has big DlcK that skid doesnt have or their just isnt big enough :)
,IJtrippin,2012-10-11T12:13Z,"Gosh, the download speed is zero."
,IJtrippin,2012-10-11T12:15Z,"Should have known, had to update the torrent client."
,alexmark33,2012-10-11T21:55Z,"so this version of he game is compleltey fixed no  bugs with the saves cause ive been reading that a lot And anyone wanna explain this (Copy over the cracked content from the Crack dir on the disc to your
installBinariesWin32 dir) cause im used to just copying the cracked content in to the game folder is this just a more complicated way of saying that or do i have to look for something called installbinarieswin32... "
,tofumunch,2012-10-12T03:19Z,@alexmark33: i haven't installed it yet but i think it's just the usual binaries folder inside the game's folder.
,Sellian,2012-10-12T04:13Z,"i have the 3dm version with the last crack of reloaded and i still cant get my mouse work in game, so i will try this one from 0"
,Mimis_8,2012-10-12T13:50Z,"the game works great i've installed it and downloaded the crack also. its pretty good, a bit slow downloading but its still new i suppose. I'll seed  at least 1/1. "
,fobio,2012-10-12T18:14Z,app crash lots of filenames not found. could it be due to my video card geforce 7950 gx2
,fobio,2012-10-12T18:16Z,"@bambam299 

Same here is your video card shitty like mines?"
,weldsmoke,2012-10-12T21:10Z,worked like a charm...........killer graphics.easy instructions........thanks alot
,OmarKH,2012-10-12T22:53Z,"I downloaded 3DM, do I need to download Reloaded or are they the same? if I don't need to download it, my understanding is that I should use Reloaded crack fix on 3DM right?"
,alexmark33,2012-10-13T04:23Z,dint this say that the save bug was fixed? when ever i die it starts the whole mission over again..
,Sellian,2012-10-13T05:22Z,"Now with this version works really nice :D thx

if someone have problems starting the game maybe is your language configuration. some versions have only english if u put another the game crash after intro. look inside your gamefolder if your language folder is empty"
,thebjo0122,2012-10-13T11:24Z,I installd the game with deamon and  i couldent find any af the fils dikribd that I had to copy. the shortcuts take me to the steam buy page and I cant seem to find any lunsher  that  works or any louncher at al

,gvlt,2012-10-13T18:32Z,If anyone now Lithuanian language you can watch this game video preview in Youtube U-0LCihSt2w 
,alexmark33,2012-10-13T22:24Z,"@thebjo i did the same the same thing too when you click install game the autoplay thing comes up and says start set up or open folder to vew iled
 go to the second and open the folder called crack and copy everything inside it then go to computer 
local disk
find your game ( probably in program files(86))
click it then find the folder called binaries and in that folder is another folder called win32 paste everything in there then it should work fine 
hope it works
BTW This crack doesnt have the save bug fixed so when you die you restart the mission can some one link me a proper crack of this game or tell me if this crack is gonna be updated?"
,AnonMask,2012-10-14T17:45Z,Does this fix the issue where you save the game at some point in a level but then if you die it just takes you to the begining?
,Devil_jinn,2012-10-17T16:14Z,Awesome...Upload..:)
,RenderOne,2012-10-19T02:41Z,This version DOES fix the game save issue!
,Xaid,2012-10-23T02:14Z,everything installed properly but i cant move the player at all .... the mouse works and i can jump  but the w a s d keys dont work.....ANY SOLUTIONS ???
