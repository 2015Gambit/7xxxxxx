There will be no more torrents from shipJ, due to unavailability of scans."
,LCSINpatria,2012-10-10T10:38Z,"the end, thx for everything"
,shipjrock,2012-10-10T10:40Z,"Dear shipJ, I've been downloading your 0-Day compilation since a long time ago. I'm fuckinly and damnly sad when you said that you've decided to stop uploading 0-Day torrent. I made this new account just to write this comment. I named this account ""shipjrock"" which mean that you're the greatest uploader. I don't know why would you decided to stop uploading your awesome 0-Day compilation. ""Unavailability of scans"" is not an acceptable reason for me. I mean, there are many sources plus your own private source of getting all of these scans. So, please don't stop compiling and uploading your complete compilation. I'm pretty sure that there'll be available scans in the near future - it can be tomorrow, it can be the day after tomorrow, it can be next week and so on; you'll never know. So, please buddy, please don't stop! I'm begging you till the bottom of my feet, please don't stop your 0-Day torrent. I'm willing to do anything so that you'll not stop. There is no other compilation out there that are as complete as yours. I'm pretty sure that everyone is agreed with me. Please tell me that you won't stop! I'M BEGGING YOU!!! :("

,Sinthyses,2012-10-10T11:45Z,"Thanks for all the comics shipJ, you're the man!"
,animehunt,2012-10-10T13:06Z,"PLEASE don't stop uploading ShipJ. 

I rely to find those scans that I miss.

Again PLEASE with a cherry on top don't stop uploading."
,KevMovieMan,2012-10-10T14:43Z,"Thanks bro, every effort made is more then what u ever needed to do for us.... thank u 4 everything...

And guys/gals.... 0 Day releases shouldn't stop... others do upload them onto other sites and i'm sure someone might pick up after this one ends.... so dont worry ur pretty little heads, they're always be new comics available

And if u r stuck... do what i do.... take a title i.e. Avengers Vs X-Men 12 and google it along with the high quality uploader that would normally upload the scans i.e. Minutemen-Meganubis etc"

,lokisdmf,2012-10-14T22:18Z,"Dear shipJ , you've been the highlight of my weeks for months now and it's a shame to see you go. I wish you well on further endeavors and will continue to check in from time to time, just in case. Thanks so much."
,Ralokone,2012-10-15T03:18Z,"last release of new comics ever . . . and still no dejah thoris . . . 

well thanks anyways :)"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-17T22:33Z,"Seriously hope this doesn't turn out to be true. I was certainly glad to see you this week. After having become an uploader, though, I can tell you from experience that most people don't really realize how much time it takes to put together something like what you 0-day releases. Even without scanning yourself, it's still a HUGE undertaking, so thank you very much for all the many hours of great reading material you've provided."
