In three Chinese folk tales, an old woman, a young boy and a wild spirit are all bound by a passion to create, changing the world around them forever. In The Silk Tapestry, an impoverished elderly woman's only hope against a life of hardship lies in the completion of a magical tapestry. It is said to be the key to a paradise. Already living in squalor, how much more of herself is she willing sacrifice to see her dream come to fruition? In Sausage-Boy and his Magic Brush, a young boy's remarkable talent for paintings that come to life attracts a greedy woman. In The Creation Myth of Pan Gu a lonely but wild spirit sculpts the Earth from a cosmic egg in hopes it brings others like him to keep him company.
