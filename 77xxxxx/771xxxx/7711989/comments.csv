the different stations are because most of them are sloppy...in that they step all over the show with commercials...cut rush off before his last sentence or return from a commercial and he's already been talking for a while...next the i-heart radio stations network is about 3/4's of the stations and they are constantly dropping off...''streaming problems''...and some are cutting you off after an hour of listening...my favorite station KNZZ ...started cutting out after an hour....and even if you are sitting there to catch it go silent...you will still lose a few sentences...and you've got a big hiccup in your recording...so i search for stations that have a strong signal and don't overlap the commercials...and don't drop off unexpectedly...2 or 3 overlaps is ok...but not 3 or 4 every hour...i've got about 4 or 5 now that have held up...there are about 10 more i'd like to try...and i'm running with the idea that the station is better if it is closer...i don't know if that is true...if the station really chops it up...then i have to wait till the hawaii station goes on...or the late night rebroadcast from ohio....i listen to different stations over the weekend but this isn't a good test because the weekend program engineer is probably a different person...or intern....in today's show out of cheyenne there wasn't even one error overlap...that's pretty good....!!!...that makes it very easy to trim it...people seem to like it without commercials....i could upload it in 10 minutes after the show ends if i left the commercials in ...taking them out takes over an hour...and if it's a butchered recording it sounds really bad and it's better to do it again later...plus if you leave the commercials in you get some local flavor from that city..and local news too...i don't mind the commercials as much"
