Shehnai is a love story that reaches it crescendo when mothers of both the hero and heroine meet after a long time unknown to each other that their children are in love with each other and intend to marry, but heroine's mother does not want them to marry as the hero wants to continue working as an air force pilot being his late Father's dream, who was also a pilot himself but was killed in a war. Incidentally heroine's mother also happened to be wife of an air force pilot who also lost her first husband in the same war and both the pilots happened to be friends.
