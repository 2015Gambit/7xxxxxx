National Geographic Channel gained rare access to this elite law enforcement agency for the new series Alaska State Troopers. Filmed over 10 months, the series captures a mixture of raw nature and criminal activity throughout the Alaskan wilderness and its remote villages. Follow state troopers from two divisions within the storied organization: the “blue shirt” Alaska State Troopers, who police the towns and villages, as well as the “brown shirt” Alaska Wildlife Troopers, who enforce fish and game regulations for both commercial and sport activities.
