,slymuse,2012-10-11T04:10Z,"Found english subs here:  http://subscene.com/subtitles/to-rome-with-love/english/637207
I have not had a chance to see if the file is any good yet so if somebody wants to check it out and let us know that would be great."
,culo_mahogany,2012-10-11T05:13Z,"Auto translated? :(

No me gusta..."
,slymuse,2012-10-11T05:36Z,"Yeah, sorry those subs are terrible, but they can at least let you understand what is going on in the Italian scenes if you can't wait for something better."
,browncow2,2012-10-11T05:53Z,"The subs at least translate the Italian scenes. I doubt it's with the humor, but works to get through those scenes."

,browncow2,2012-10-11T23:30Z,"Hey TBDarko, I thought that was hilarious! I'd be saying the same thing if didn't need the subs. Funny stuff."

,sammyboblammy,2012-10-18T21:10Z,They are not amazing hut they work well enough. Option 2 is to learn Italian. 
,pragmato,2012-10-28T21:07Z,"Nice torrent.  A/V: 10 .Thank you for sharing subs also. |Spoiler| But why does ""John"" in the movie look exactly like the incumbent mayor of berlin, Mr. 'Wowi' Wowereit?! Shocking! A coincidence? "
