,OmniNegro,2012-10-09T19:30Z,"I see there may be three comments, but only one is showing currently. So please ignore me if this has already been answered or if another has already asked.

Will there be a crack separate from the release for those who downloaded the 3DM version? And can anyone tell us what is different with this version?"
,rammer231,2012-10-09T19:31Z,Downloading. Gonna be seeding 20/30 :D

,blackmorth,2012-10-09T19:43Z,"Does it have FULL audio and text support for spanish, german, etc? or it only has english?"
[V],HeroMaster,2012-10-09T19:45Z,"Too Late SKIDROW, but will give credit to Scene for giving us a Proper One Cheers Guys."

,PaulNo2,2012-10-09T20:05Z,"Same question as @blackmorth , can anybody confirm this release contains multilanguage audio files?"
,Nemecis123,2012-10-09T20:07Z,can someone tell me whats the difference between skidrow and 3DM? why is skidrow more popular?

,FWolf,2012-10-09T20:13Z,"Crack is a little borked compared to v5 of 3DM...save files are displayed really strangely because they aren't being saved with proper time/date info.
"
[T],tikasukaz,2012-10-09T20:36Z,"@Nemecis123

SKIDROW Group is  ""Scene""

3DM is  ""p2p""


Ofcourse SCENE is more quality.

"
,OmniNegro,2012-10-09T20:55Z,"What arbitrary ruler do you use to measure Skidrow as a Scene group and 3DM as a non scene group? You may as well call them bitches too. Please stop trowing mud.

3DM has released quite a lot, and they deserve equal credit for the things they have done.

So far, no-one has answered what if any benefits the Skidrow release has over the 3DM release. So this name calling is just plainly disrespectful.

Scene is more quality because you say so? Good enough for you. But do not throw stones lest you discover you live in a glass house.

I hope it is better. But I just want to know what is different. I will reserve judgment until the details are revealed."
,Nemecis123,2012-10-09T21:08Z,"@tikasukaz

Okay thanks for the answer, but i have almost downloaded dishonored 3DM version.. Should i get skidrow's version or just the 3DM?"
,Kindergaten,2012-10-09T21:36Z,"If any of you are having trouble installing this game, then I uploaded a vid on you tube, just look at my channel, gligar2tennyson "
,AgentClaret,2012-10-09T21:38Z,"Nemecis, not sure if this crack works with the 3DM version, but if you want my advice I always wait on a new release until SKIDROWs version hits. They may take a tiny bit longer and not be the first to upload but their stuff pretty much always works.

Not knocking 3DM, I'm just more familiar with SKIDROW stuff..."
,Inc0gnit007,2012-10-09T22:06Z,"OmniNegro P2P dogshit does not hold a candle to a Scene release period, know your shit before you beak off.
Most P2P is ripped off scene releases and repackaged to make some faggotass loser look good.
As a Racer that supplies Scene releases the instant it is released I know the difference, been a courier for 12 years.
Scene rules anything else is a copy of a scene release."
,Inc0gnit007,2012-10-09T22:10Z,"Bottom line a Scene release is almost 100% the first release, p2p is usally a copy repacked to make the take it in the ass loser fucktard look good.
Been a courier moving all the major groups shit for 12 years Scene release are the best as they get nuked if there is a virus/trojan ect or a bad crack.
Scene gets it the instant it is released and all the sites get it at almost the same time as gigabit servers rock.
P2P release are just some racer trying to repack and look good."
[T],tikasukaz,2012-10-09T22:27Z,"I recommend getting this version. As it's SKIDROW.

Though 3DM version is also working.
"
,Inc0gnit007,2012-10-09T22:27Z,"Scene releases rule, always first, p2p is 99% repackaged scene releases period.
I have been a scene courier for 12 years and we are the p2p suppliers, scene always get their shit first as soon as it is released its on giga and mb topsites worldwide in minutes.
When we find a fuckin fucktard repacking our releases we ban them from all racing sites."
,ninvus,2012-10-09T22:35Z,"@incognit007
i highly doubt you were anything special for 12 years, just because you say it over and over does not mean it is true, my guess is you have no idea what you are saying, your nothing special and we dont care you were some asswhipe courier we all know when you mean courier you mean pizza dilivery boy who get's paid 2 bucks an hour. or do i need to make 5 posts saying your shit to make it true? no? i guess 1 is good enough"
,xjun1or3,2012-10-09T22:54Z,"# tikasukaz 
3DM is best, i bet that the skidrow's version dont work in windows 8 like the previous but 3DM works like a charm."
,bigmikeyz,2012-10-09T23:36Z,No one likes windows 8 so it serves you right.
,OmniNegro,2012-10-09T23:37Z,"Relax everyone. I did not mean to start a war in the comments.

I meant no offense to tikasukaz. He is a trusted and respected poster. I just thought his message sounded demeaning to 3DM.

However, In0gnit007 is a fucking moron. If he *Is* what he claims to be, he just broke the cardinal rule of such a trade. He declared it to the public. Foolish is an inadequate word for that.

Incomprehensible, if you understand this post, then understand you just ended your ""Courier"" job forever.

Hell, 12 years ago when this was *ALL* handled on Usenet, your made up courier job was unneeded.

And Usenet is *STILL* the first place most major ""Scene"" releases go to.

But keep patting yourself on the back. And keep talking about how great you think you are."
,Deresmus,2012-10-10T00:17Z,Can someone tell me what the difference is between the Skidrow version and the 3DM version that just finished downloading for me? Should I download this one instead? Or is the 3DM version fine?
[T],tikasukaz,2012-10-10T00:20Z,"
No doubt 3DM is excellent cracking group and yes their v5.0 Crack works on windows 8 too. 

I recommended SKIDROW because this is ISO, and many of the people over here prefer ISO.

*Peace*"
,Dylkoss,2012-10-10T01:51Z,it work ?
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-10T04:12Z," Dishonored_PROPER-FLT??? what is this proper for, both skidrow/3dm versions are working just fine. What is different with Fairlights dishonored release?? anyone know?"
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-10T04:19Z,"MY FAVORITE SCENEGROUP IS SKIDROW, not because i think they crack better or anything, but because they keep their and others releases up to date. They release patches/cracks for their own releases and even release patches for games they havent released. I dont know who are the best ""crackers"", I dont care, tbh I think this scene group fighting is just silly, they are all good at what they do. Who cares who does it best? Typical nerd behaviour.... :)"
,Hobson_82,2012-10-10T04:43Z,"The big difference is that scene releases follow a set or rules and have tamper proofing with checksums.
3DM may have a fully working crack and yes, they were pretty quick but there is no tamper proofing in their torrent at all.

In short: Scene releases are safer."
,LaxerFL,2012-10-10T04:58Z,"Thanks for the upload!

What do you guys consider an appropriate share ratio? I'm all for doing my part but I can't just seed forever. So I'm wondering what ratio I should aim for to be ""fair"".
Thanks for any input,
Lax"

Anyone know why the FLT release is a ""proper""? Couldnt find any info on that, orldydb doesnt say yet?"
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-10T07:26Z,"Found the reason for ""proper"", FLT say that Skidrow version has ""saved.games.not.handled.properly_get.FLT.proper""...."
,Alberto2k3,2012-10-10T07:35Z,"How to change the language in this game? 

I tried the next but didnt work

1. Open SKIDROW.ini

2.Where it is # Change the language only if the game uses steam_api/steamclient to decide it.
 i write# Language ""spanish""

3. i think this method works in the 3dm torrent, but not here...any other way to change language?

thanks in advance"

,chobitscrazy,2012-10-12T04:52Z,"For those having the autosaves not working, your best bet is after dying you can exit to the menu and hit continue and it should pick up your last auto save instead of your last actual save."
