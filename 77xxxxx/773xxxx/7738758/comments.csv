Hey, I'm on Chapter 13 and I'm stuck. I broke the washer and talked to the maid, turned the cross and found the hole. But the maid just keeps walking around the house. She eventually gets to the bathroom but then just walks around for a minute and leaves to walk around the house again. I tried watching through the hole when she goes in, tried standing in the hall, I even tried closing the door behind her but nothing works, its very frustrating please help"
