This upload is an 'Add-On' to the following torrent...

In case anybody is wondering, an 'Addendum' relates to a torrent somebody else uploaded, an 'Add-On' is in conjunction with a torrent I previously uploaded myself. In hindsight, I probably should have done them in reverse, but it's really just a naming convention to keep them straight on my pc (and in my head), anyway.
