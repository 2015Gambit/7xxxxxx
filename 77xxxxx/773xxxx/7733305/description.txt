Nazi Collaborators 
This series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. "How could they have done it?" How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. At the heart of this 13 part series lies one uneasy question. If you had faced what these people had faced, might you have done the same thing - and danced with the devil? 



3)  The Arajs Kommando 
LÃ©on Degrelle , was a Walloon Belgian politician, who founded Rexism and later joined the Waffen SS which were front-line troops in the fight against the Soviet Union. After World War II, he was a prominent figure in neo-nazi movements. In any other age, Leon Degrelle would have been a hero. He was rich, young, charismatic. He ended up however a resolute Nazi Collaborator and soon became embroiled in murder. At the end of the war, he fled to Spain. His legacy still divides Belgium and leaves those who knew him to reflect on the choices they made and the "Belgian Collaborator" they followed.
