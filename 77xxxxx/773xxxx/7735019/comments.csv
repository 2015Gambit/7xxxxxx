I actually managed to finish downloading the previous one but then it wouldn't play cause my PC can't run 1080p (yesh I know it sucks, and yesh to anyone else it was 1080p, check the size of the thing when it opens) Also thanks Tanis for being the first to bring it up... 
Last episode of the season next.. I hope they don't go on hold before season 5"
