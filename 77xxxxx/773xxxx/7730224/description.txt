Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho! (Summons for Mohan Joshi ) is a 1984 Hindi art film, made by Saeed Akhtar Mirza, based on his own story, during the Parallel Cinema period of Indian cinema.

The film is a comic satire on a judicial system, where cases drag on for decades, where plaintives either die or lose hope and money, while the corrupt run scot free, thanks to their nexus with corrupt lawyers.

The film won the 1984 National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare.
