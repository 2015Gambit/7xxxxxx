Company: Liar-soft
Release date: Nov 22, 2007

Summary: Inganock, a city isolated from the outside, a city where everything is distorted, even the sun. It all started ten years ago, at a day called as 'Revival'. Then residents of the city slowly changed into beings that are partially human and partially animal. To this day, only a few still look fully human on the outside. One of these is Gii, a former medical student, now an illegal doctor that walks the city and cures the poor for free.
