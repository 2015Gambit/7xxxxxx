,vinratou,2012-10-17T23:56Z,"GeekHillbilly,

Know your history.  It was the democrats that created the KKK you moron.  If you had half a clue you'd know that.  Besides this isn't the place for your pathetic political rants.  The movie has great implications and reviews from many others of more credible resource than yourself."
,PaleoPirate,2012-10-18T23:20Z,"When it comes to long term political movements, we need to stop using words like Democrat and Republican, because there have been shifts in the parties. Use conservative and liberal. And the KKK was a conservative movement, not a liberal one. Just like this film is a piece of conservative propaganda."
,doodad69,2012-10-19T05:57Z,"@PaleoPirate: you're full of shit you libtard dipshit. The 'Rat party has always been the party of domination over blacks, be they KKK or keep them ensconced in welfare for life. They seek to wield complete control over minorities and women to shore up their power. A true racist is one who believes that other races can't survive without THEM prodding them along and ""looking out for them."" Of course it doesn't hurt that stupid white boys go along with them, does it, stupid white boy?"
,doodad69,2012-10-19T06:00Z,"@GeekLibtard: Instead of just running your sissy white boy mouth about the movie being ""pure bullshit"" watch it and point out which parts are bullshit. You Obamabot zealots hide your dumb heads in the sand, pull it out, see things are WORSE, and put them right back in the sand. You can't logically defend anything about this piece of shit Marxist that hates YOU and your country. But accept my challenge and actually watch the goddamn movie and tick off every part YOU see as bullshit. You might actually learn something, asshole. "
,petzl3000,2012-10-19T09:16Z,"""democrats started the KKK"" 

Only a complete and utter idiot would make a statement like this.  someone who did not go to school, someone who is obviously a southern, republican idiot who has no knowledge of history. Only someone who didn't graduate high school and/or listens exclusively to glenn beck would even know about this ""theory"".

Why the fuck didn't the North let you guys have your own little country down south, so you could have your theocratic shithole and leave the north alone....   lincoln was nuts to keep the union together."
,83omega,2012-10-27T07:07Z,"Geekhillbilly didn't even mention the GOP, he said the Tea Party. Asuming the Democrats ""Created"" the KKK is absurd. The Democrats were the Official Party of the KKK and the GOP was the party of the civil rights movement. Nixon pardoned MLK, that is true of HISTORY, but since Reagan there has been an utter flip on the views of the plight of the Afican American man by the GOP and instead of seeing someone who, in certain examples, could use a hand to allow them the opportunity to help themselves, to ""they just want my tax money."" Its sad but ask any white supremist who there political affiliations are and you will hear the same answers. To believe that because the Democrats had the KKK's backing in the turn of the 20th century, must mean that they have stayed with the Democrats is ceriously misguided. Looking back at history can however explain why my father was a Republican and why I can not be far enough away from any political party. This is propaghanda but not by a racist the man is an Indian. The creator believes the POTUS honestly wants to take away everything from white men and give it all to black men because he didn't agree with Brittain's occupation of Kenya. Its ridiculous but rather then attack anyone for watching this, I will simply say do your research and make your own decision. I know calling someone a dumbass isn't going to make a point, or change minds. This comment wont either but regardless of what you believe I think we should all work together. "
