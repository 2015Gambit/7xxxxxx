,tsarus,2012-10-16T18:50Z,"""None are the God of Israel"" you said. If you consider that the original book of Genesis has only phrases, then when Adam is created the men already existed. Worst the God is not the Yahweh God. So it is not God who promised the Promised Land. ""The Antichrist"", as for him why is it that none has seen that there are two sons of God. I suppose the Antichrist is the next son whose job will be to save Earth from desertification. Without him the civilization will stop, with him it is the end of the Three Religions. It is not important to believe in God or in any religion. We have our conscience, which is the eye of God in our spirit. The Antichrist is not an Hitler-like person. According to Zechariah he is son of God. I suppose if they are two sons, none is God. "
[T],POtHS11,2012-10-23T16:33Z,"Angels and Adam are considered Sons of God. There are millions of Angels but they are not our Gods. To worship them is Blasphemous. All others were created through Women. As was Jesus, the Only perfect man. God in The Flesh. He is the Perfect example of a Perfect Man."
