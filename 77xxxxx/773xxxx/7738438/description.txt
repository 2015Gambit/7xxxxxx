FOX bungled the hell out of this nationwide because of a baseball rain delay. CTV
on the otherhand managed to air it on the East Coast. And this folks is why internet
downloading is better then normal TV watching. Things get magically preempted and yet
still appear.. WINNING!

This will air on FOX on Tuesday unless baseball happens and they deem it more important
Also this only aired on the east coast CTV feed
