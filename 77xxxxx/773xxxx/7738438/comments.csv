,jedipsool,2012-10-18T10:59Z,Thanks...
,ZimonR30,2012-10-18T12:22Z,damn it this is the wrong ending it from episode 4 
,uhaaaaa,2012-10-18T12:25Z,The ending is from a different show?!
,ammory25,2012-10-18T12:26Z,"There's something wrong with the last 10 minutes!
It was taken from a very old episode!
PLEASE fix it I need to know who made it through..."
,Furious_Child,2012-10-18T13:32Z,"Winning? Try LOSING! The last few shows I've downloaded from you have all been botched. It's hilarious and ironic how you go on in the info about how downloading is better than watching TV and how awesome you are for getting us this torrent only for the torrent to be 'bungled' with the wrong ending. Well, I guess that's different from the audio out of sync shit you've been putting out lately. I'm done downloading from you and TVTeam for awhile until you can figure your shit out."
,ellakim1,2012-10-18T14:11Z,"Yep it's all gone wrong since the stoopid decision to go x264 and fuck the vast majority of people that don't want it. Out of sync audio, dodgy action scenes.....all since the adoption of this shite as the new standard."
,montej,2012-10-18T14:17Z,There was a rain delay for a baseball game in the broadcast. That's why it is cut off... you look like an ass
,Shirerose,2012-10-18T17:11Z,What the hell is wrong with you people. He used his time to upload this video for anyone to download. So if it's not prefect big deal. When you want a good download ettv is always there. So THANKS ettv!!
,DrunkPollock,2012-10-18T17:39Z,"Thanks. It's better than nothing and for the people complaining, feel free to wait until next Tuesday, you entitled whiners."
,Jokkahell,2012-10-18T18:01Z, wrong ending!
[T],burgundyranger,2012-10-18T20:02Z,"People, this is EXACTLY as the show aired on CTV. Yeah, it is the wrong ending but that decision was made by CTV and/or the X Factor producers.

There was a boatload of spoiler tweets coming from the people still watching the show in Canada (last half of young adults and first half of groups), so they decided to switch. Make sense? No."
,Pendaws,2012-10-18T23:46Z,Thank you for making this available. :)
,suzy9799,2012-10-19T00:36Z,ThankYou!
,esbornia,2012-10-19T01:10Z,"Thanks a lot, only half of the group decisions were cut. Please continue with your awesome torrents. Furious_Child, you should be called Spoiled_Child. Ellakim1 think for yourself will ya?"
,RobRam,2012-10-19T02:09Z,Thank you very much!
[V],rr-ne,2012-10-19T03:31Z,"Rain delay? Are the shows live or something?

I thought they were pre-recorded."
,jc4321234,2012-10-19T04:28Z,"@rr-ne  The baseball game was live and it got delayed because of rain, so it fucked up the rest of the regularly scheduled TV programmes.  Is it really that hard to figure out?"
,malfdawg,2012-10-19T11:38Z,lmao! i ALWAYS download from ettv and NEVER has the audio been out of sync or the image quality poor. You scrubs just dont know how to install your encoders correctly LOOOOOOOOL
,Dizzy8,2012-10-19T16:33Z,"I've downloaded a lot from ettv and audio/video had been great, unfortunatly this ending was wrong!!! I want to see the last of the groups and who made it!"
,bassposaune,2012-10-20T02:18Z,"FYI, if you haven't seen this yet...

,TNT4THEBRAIN,2012-10-20T23:03Z,can somebody tell me what song plays between 34:40 and 35:17 minutes?
,hadi_22,2012-10-21T10:51Z,"""can somebody tell me what song plays between 34:40 and 35:17 minutes? ""

I also would like to know the song plz."
,mapster26,2012-10-21T13:11Z,@haddi_22 The XX - intro
,hadi_22,2012-10-21T15:17Z,"@mapster26
thanks so much!"
,13ip0lar,2012-10-21T15:38Z,I wish people would stop lying. There is no fucking way this aired as is on National TV. They wouldn't take the whole fucking episode and then fuck it up by splicing 10 minutes of an old episode on the end. I just found out who the last two in groups were from a website. 
,kidpub32,2012-10-22T16:28Z, The song that plays between 34:40 and 35:17 minutes is called The XX - Intro 
,greatbrit,2012-10-23T05:28Z,"OMG, is this what the world has come to?  Someone takes the time and effort to upload a torrent, and then he gets slammed.  Unless he intentionally did something bad, there is only one acceptable response.  It is this:

THANK YOU!"
,fordm,2012-10-25T19:00Z,"where is 12th episode, it was aired on 23rd october...?"
,sigurtor8,2012-11-01T11:20Z,Where is the live show that was 31. october? nobody going to put it in here?
