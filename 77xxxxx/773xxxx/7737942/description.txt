Features that make ┬╡Torrent so popular.
 
Tiny
┬╡Torrent is less than 800 KB (smaller than a digital photo!). It installs ultra-fast with a light footprint on your computer, and runs super-efficiently.
 
Easy
Simple and straightforward ΓÇô that's ┬╡Torrent. With its purpose-built interface, downloading torrents is a snap.
 
Accessible

Innovative
Since ┬╡Torrent is offered by the team who invented the BitTorrent open source protocol, you know you will always have access to the latest and greatest technologies.
 
Fast
Expertly designed for fast downloads. Avoids hogging valuable system resources, runs quietly in the background, and doesn't interfere with your work, play etc.
 
Cutting Edge
Incorporating groundbreaking ┬╡TP technology, ┬╡Torrent maximizes bandwidth and reduces congestion - so you have the smoothest, quickest downloads possible and don't make your internet connection slow to a crawl.
 
Intelligent
┬╡Torrent is instinctively smart. It auto-adjusts bandwidth usage based upon your network and the Internet. Use Skype, play games, stream video etc., all without interference.

PeerBlock lets you control who your computer "talks to" on the Internet. By selecting appropriate lists of "known bad" computers, you can block communication with advertising or spyware oriented servers, computers monitoring your p2p activities, computers which have been "hacked", even entire countries! They can't get in to your computer, and your computer won't try to send them anything either.
And best of all, it's free!
