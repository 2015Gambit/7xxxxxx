Stereo was more popular, so MONO was dropped and "Mini" seems more apt..
Opening wide shot is kinda ugly, but most of it's close-ups.

The purpose is to provide really tiny videos (resolution and filesize)
... for tiny screens and tiny storage devices
... and just maybe for those still on dial-up.
Thought about 320x176 for ultimate compatibility, but bad visions
...of long ago formats made me not want to do this.
So, I settled on 480x272 as a compromise.
Long shots suffer the worst, but close-ups look fairly good.
I have a 32" 1080p monitor two feet in front of my face
...and these look surprising well, considering.
