TutsPlus - Advanced JavaScript Fundamentals

Without a doubt, JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. While the web development industry is chock full of frameworks and libraries that simplify some aspects of JavaScript development, thereΓÇÖs something to be said about having the skills to write pure JavaScript. Frameworks, libraries, and transpilers may come and go, but JavaScript is forever.
In JavaScript Fundamentals 101, we focused on the basics of the language. This follow-up course will focus on DOM scripting and events. So, if youΓÇÖre a complete beginner, or a coder who has exclusively used frameworks in the past, this is the course for you.
