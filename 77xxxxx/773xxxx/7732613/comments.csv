,wetmat1,2012-10-17T03:55Z,"Thanks, once the download is finished, I'll seed for as long as I can. Question, does the ISO include an activator, or should I look elsewhere for that?"
,ngein,2012-10-17T05:47Z,This is the Dell OEM copy so it is automatically activated if you have a Dell with SLIC 2.1 (previously had Windows 7 on the PC). Otherwise you'll have to activate with another method or spoof SLIC 2.1 on it. Google SLIC for your model and you may be able to find a BIOS with SLIC 2.1 integrated.
,ngein,2012-10-17T05:49Z,I am working on uploading the Ultimate version with integrated SP1 right now as well.
,ngein,2012-10-17T05:53Z,I'm working on Ultimate and it will be uploaded soon.
,ngein,2012-10-17T07:18Z,Dell Windows 7 Ultimate with SP1 is now uploaded here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7735062

,ngein,2012-10-27T22:49Z,Indeed it is. I just used IMGBURN to make an exact ISO copy.
