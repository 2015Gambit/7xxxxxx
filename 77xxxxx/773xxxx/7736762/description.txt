Watch out friends of ghosts! This fun and spooky puzzle game will take you to Halloween. Connect two tiles of a kind on the board. But it is not as easy as it sounds: You can only connect tiles directly next to each other or if there is a clear path between those two tiles. This pass is only allowed to bend two times!
