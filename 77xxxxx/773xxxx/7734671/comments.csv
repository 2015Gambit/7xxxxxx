,mhamer6,2012-10-17T05:24Z,I downloaded and it lost its file extension and whenever I try to load the file list it doesnt show the file so can someone tell me what type of file this is?

That's odd, but it's a matroska file, so you want to add "".mkv"" at the end of the filename. (excluding the quotation marks of course)"
