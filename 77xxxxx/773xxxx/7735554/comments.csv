Obama wouldn't want 4 more.  He's got a $35 million dollar mansion in Hawaii waiting for him now (google it if you don't believe me).

USA is a nation founded on individual freedom, not class warfare and collectivist handouts.  Romney is a competent executive and good representation of this country's philosophy, while Obama most certainly is not."
[V],twentyforty,2012-10-19T12:06Z,"I rather would stay aside - but - US was ""founded"" in - 1776.
Let me repeat - 1776...

In 18th century there was not many options to choose from and - what seemed as good two and a half centuries ago - today, it doesn't look good at least not That good now. Point being that all ideas, no matter how sacred they were - simply must be, as first, put in the context of time of their origin and, all all ideas must evolve. Or change.

Just addressing ""high horse"" position from which too many Americans really think how by letter ideas founding father have must be obeyed. But we see that in most dangerous and derrogative using of book of fairytale from small Mediterranean country - by half, most likely, same USA citizens.
Constitutional and religious fundamentalism in action.

""New Associated Press-GfK poll reveals that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe in Angels, 77 percent of adults to be exact.""

So - there shouldn't be nothing to worry about. Right?"
,RTT2,2012-11-04T17:50Z,"Quite. And with the great libertarian 'scholarship' (wonder why it's not recognized in academia? Hmmm) encompassing smoking/cancer and global warming denialism (as well as countless other disgraceful examples from history - read 'Merchants of Doubt' for more), clearly nothing to worry about there either, they've surely made the grade for self-governance..."
