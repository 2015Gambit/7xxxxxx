GI JOE Snake Eyes V2 #18 [IDW]

TARGET: SNAKE EYES starts here! Maybe SNAKE EYES should have stayed dead! The JOES are mobilized to hunt down their most dangerous quarry ever: one of their own. Has the silent Joe gone over to the other side? Is he playing his own game? Only Snake Eyes knows the answer.
