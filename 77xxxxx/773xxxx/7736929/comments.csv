Will post it as soon as I can.  If you're a WDM Network member then you obviously don't have this problem.  Just use the links on there instead.  They will still work."
,odog0341,2012-10-23T15:43Z,I was denied membership to WDM network because it said I had a proxy server? Whatever that is. Is there any other site I can get 10-22-12?
,odog0341,2012-10-23T17:04Z,Is it because I have a wireless router? The signal on that thing doesn't go outside the house.
,Fitzy727,2012-10-23T20:34Z,Hope the problem gets fixed soon!  It's torture to not have my daily dose of Howard :(
