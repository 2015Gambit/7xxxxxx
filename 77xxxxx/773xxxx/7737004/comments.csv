Bit of a ding for lack of subs for the occasional Russian parts; otherwise, a stunning rip. Thanks!!!"
,Revisionist,2012-10-20T01:31Z,"This is a Russian version so you dont get subtitles when you need them. The dialogue is about 1/2 english, 1/2 russian.  There are times when there are no subs and other times you need to know what they are saying. It was annoying trying to figure out when you were actually missing something.

Thats said, the movie isnt what you probably think it is so it wont matter.

Other than sub issues, quality is fine, just a couple of glitches but they only last a second or 2"
,daveo76,2012-10-20T03:19Z,It should had been mentioned that this film is in half English and half Russian. With no English subtitles for the Russian parts. I searched everywhere for non english subtitles but can't find any

I think you're wrong on both counts: 

1. I don't think this is a ""Russian version,"" it's the theatrical release which contains some Russian dialogue and was filmed in Russia and Bulgaria;

2. The Russian dialogue constitutes no where near 50%--I'd say it's 10% at the very most.

And yeah, there were times I wish I could understand what was being said. But I still really enjoyed the film. 

I'm sure there will be subs for this before too long. The thing that's surprising to me is that this is burned from a Blu-Ray so soon after the release date and it doesn't have any of the typical screener (SCR) copyright info flashing across the screen."

,QborT,2012-10-22T19:16Z,There are no subs because the source is a Russian Blu-Ray (Region C).

The movie itself is a total crap."
