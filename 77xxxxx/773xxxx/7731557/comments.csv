,Elchander,2012-10-16T02:04Z,"Hey TT, thanks for everything you're doing. I was wondering if you happened to have any Caedmon's Call."
,kingmema,2012-10-16T04:39Z,Thank You So Much for all of these great downloads. I was wondering if you had Tasha Cobbs Smile ALbum.
,doveofgod1,2012-10-16T09:49Z,You're doing a great job at uploading music like this! May I ask you to upload the newest CD from Gungor? Many appreciations!

Thankx again"
,super1313,2012-10-17T23:10Z,someone needs to seed this one. Thanks again torrentracts:)
,Clloud,2012-10-18T00:24Z,"Hey there TT - thanks once again.

I was just wondering, since a friend asked me, do you have or do you know of anyone who has some fairly old stuff, namely ""Rolf Harris"" and ""E.L.O.""?
I told them no, but thought I would ask in any case. "
,Clloud,2012-10-18T18:24Z,My apologies. If I just took a moment and searched I would have found the actual songs I was looking for. So please forgive me for that.
,rswarren,2012-10-26T05:13Z,"Hi TT, 

Earlier this year you unploaded a Gungor discography, which was awesome, but I'm wondering if you've got their latest live album, Creation Liturgy?  I can't find a torrent link on the interwebs anywhere, and love the new album.  Please upload if you have it.  Thanks, friend!"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-11-01T16:21Z,"Jboog3085, I think I might have a small handful of Eshon Burgundy's albums.  I'll start gathering some of them together for you, and torrent 'em when I'm able to.  :)"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-11-01T16:22Z,"Kingmema, there is no Tasha Cobbs in my collection.  Wish I had better news for you today.  Sorry about that.  Hope you're able to find it elsewhere.  :)"
