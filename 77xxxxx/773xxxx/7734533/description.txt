Nazi Collaborators 
This series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. "How could they have done it?" How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. At the heart of this 13 part series lies one uneasy question. If you had faced what these people had faced, might you have done the same thing - and danced with the devil?




4)  The Belgian Collaborator 
During World War Two, a gang of merciless Latvians rampaged throughout their country on behalf of the Nazi's. Started by a junior police officer, Viktors Arajs, the Kommando were formed of students, builders and accountants. They were attracted by excellent wages and healthy rations including endless vodka. By war's end the Arajs Kommando were directly responsible for at least 26,000 murders. In the summer of 1942 the Arajs Kommando were the chief co-ordinators of the second largest single mass murder of Jews during the War. In a forest ten kilometres from the Latvian capital Riga, three vast pits were dug. Over the course of two days thousands of Jews from the Riga Ghetto were herded to the forest by the Arajs Kommando and executed. After the war many of the Kommando escaped justice. It took until 1975 for Viktors Arajs to surface and be tried for his crimes. This documentary contains many extraordinary interviews with those at the heart of the story as well as rare film footage.
