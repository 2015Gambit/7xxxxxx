"Who's Afraid of Virginia Coleman?"

When George's overbearing mother Virginia shows 
up at the hospital with her sick cat, named 
"cat," George must heal the cat or risk the 
alternative - having to keep her company to 
fill the void. Meanwhile, Dorothy counsels Dr. 
Leiter who must face the board of directors 
before she can settle in at the hospital.
