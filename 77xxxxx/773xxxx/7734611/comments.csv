,miamisunset,2012-10-17T02:53Z,Last week was a repeat. This is uploaded just after it aired.
,beechyboy,2012-10-17T03:35Z,"TV rage listings must be wrong then. They have the Mystery Map episode seven as airing last Monday, and yesterday they list Drive to Win episode eight as aired. When I check the History Channels listing it shows your right.
