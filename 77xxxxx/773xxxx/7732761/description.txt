In this adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, Daffy Duck is the greedy proprietor of the Lucky Duck Mega-Mart and all he can think about is the money to be made during the holiday season. Disgruntled employees like Assistant Manager Porky Pig, Marvin Martian, Speedy Gonzales, and Elmer Fudd plead to Daffy Duck for small concessions like a day off on Christmas and discounted toys, but Daffy is relentless in his pursuit of the almighty dollar. It's up to last minute shopper Bugs Bunny; the ghosts of Christmases past (Tweety and Granny), present (Yosemite Sam) and future (Taz); and Porky Pig's young daughter Priscilla to make Daffy see the error of his ways and discover the true meaning of Christmas.
