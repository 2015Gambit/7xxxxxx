although i can see peers in my client. if it
continues i'll try to repost it later.

,ChuChullain,2012-10-18T01:22Z,Thank you very much for this Catflap. :) I found your Wolfbloods by accident. We here in South Africa don't get shows like these. We even get the Doctor Who's 2 years late. :) So... You have a new fan.... :)
