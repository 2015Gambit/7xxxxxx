Howl's Moving Castle 2004 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347149/

This is the Kitchen Sink Edition, as it includes multiple audio and subtitles streams.  Hopefully this should be as complete as I can make it.

For those that just want Howl's Moving Castle with just the English language, use this torrent instead (Video quality is identical):

English Audio was demuxed from DVD in it's native 448 kbs AC3 format.  Using Audacity, the beginning was trimmed the match the sync of the blu-ray audio and then the end was trimmed to exactly match the blu-ray audio length.  The result was then exported as AC3 448kbs.  Quality should be 100% identical to the DVD's AC3 448kbs stream.

This torrent are for those that must have the Japanese audio instead of just the English.  I included the Cantonese audio as well for good measure.
