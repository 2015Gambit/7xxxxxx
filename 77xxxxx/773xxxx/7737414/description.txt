Nazi Collaborators 
This series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. "How could they have done it?" How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. At the heart of this 13 part series lies one uneasy question. If you had faced what these people had faced, might you have done the same thing - and danced with the devil? 




7)  The IRA 
Just eight months before the outbreak of World War Two a series of terrerist attacks were felt all over England. Bombs exploded in power stations and substations from Northumberland to Manchester, from Liverpool to London. Seven people were killed and 96 injured. This was the work of an Irish terrorist group, The I.R.A. and as war approached, the Nazis took a keen interest in their activities. Believing they shared similiar goals, The I.R.A's leaders travelled several times to Germany to discuss collaboration. In return the Nazis sent several spies, thousands of dollars in cash and radio transmitting equipment to Ireland. On the 5th of May 1940, German Spy Hermann Gortz parachuted into Ireland with plans for the invasion of Northern Ireland. It was called plan Kathleen.With Germany's defeat in The Battle of Britain however, Hitler cancelled any plan he may have had to invade Ireland. By the end of the war almost all of the I.R.A had been locked up or executed. Nevertheless, an unprecedented level of secret co-operation between British and Irish intelligence foiled all of the I.R.A.'s plans and allowed Winston Churchill to focus on the real enemy. Had the I.R.A succeeded in their mission, it could have lost Britain the War.
