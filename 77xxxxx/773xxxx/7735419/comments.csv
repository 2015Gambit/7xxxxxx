as you can read in description you need update patch 1.1.1 to be able to play this DLC . If you have not already that patch installed you can get it from here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7723554/Borderlands_2_update_patch_1.1.1___DLCs___nosTEAM__"

As I said. its working with the current configurations... the update 4 + DLC patch (second thing i said in the order) obviously upgrades the game to 1.1.1. No need to correct me. lol"

,pirates.unlimited,2012-10-29T07:06Z,"ok kingsanx,, ill try that too.. already got skidrow playing mechromancer,, 

@nosteam,, thanks again for the wonderful upload, btw about that darksiders 2 thing,, ppl saying they cant get pass through the select difficulty thing, after choosing save slot.. u said their system dont support the game,, well actually they just need a save file, any save will do, and it will say corrupt file, so it will try to fix it then they can start playing.. although new game+ is out of the question.."
