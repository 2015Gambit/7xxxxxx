,Mingin,2012-11-06T11:08Z,"This version is only DVD Cloner Express and will only copy DVD to DVD - it's good but won't save to your hard-drive [mkv;avi;mp4 etc]
Personally I would recommend Leawo if you need all features. No criticsm intended to scuba-doo. you guys to a great job. Long may your lum reek.
Yours aye"
