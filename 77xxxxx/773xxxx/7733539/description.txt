Notes -
Enjoy this DVDSCR.. there is no imdb rls date in theaters for it.... 
Did our thing.. Turned out real nice..
Resize, denoise, slight RGB adjustment and slight sharpen.. enjoy
Does have occasional watermark that pops up at top decided not to blur as its
only onscreen for a few seconds each time and doesnt happen often.. :)
