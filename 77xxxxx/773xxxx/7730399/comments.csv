,steaz55,2012-10-16T07:11Z,Is this an iTunes rip? 1.5 GB for 1080p? 720p is 1.2 GB. 300 MB more for 1080p. Looks like an upscaled 480p. 
,steaz55,2012-10-16T07:16Z,This may be 1080p but the bit rate is low.  High bit rate 720p is way better than low bit rate 1080p. Can you upload 720p WEB-DL?
,steaz55,2012-10-16T07:22Z,iTunes 720p has a video bit rate of 3964 kbps whereas the 1080p has a video bit rate of 4921 kbps.  1080p file has a 2.25 times more pixels but only a 1.24 times increase in bit rate. 1080p encode suffers as a result.
