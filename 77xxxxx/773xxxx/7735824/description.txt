The title is taken from a song of the same name from The Beatles 1966 album Revolver. It is often considered[by whom?] one of the most influential recordings of all time due to its use of various cutting-edge studio techniques as well as the Indian-inspired musical tracks and the psychedelic theme of the lyrics.

The cover art depicts an orange-label vinyl record inside a white LP sleeve. The words "File Under: Rock" appear in the lower right corner using a font that imitates the look and feel of a rubber stamp. The words "The Beatles" appear in orange in the center of the LP sleeve.
