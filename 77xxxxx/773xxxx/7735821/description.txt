Magnum P.I.
S03E03 Ki'i's Don't Lie (Original) Ending

This is a Crossover Episode from the Magnum P.I. Season 1 Bonus Disc. 

The ending of this episode was altered for syndication, resolving the plot so that the episode could stand on its own.  This, however, is the original broadcast version which tied it in to the Simon and Simon episode S02E01 Emeralds Are Not a Girl's Best Friend (2). At the end of this episode, Morgan Fairchild is airborne, on her way to LA after having absconded with Higgins' charity money. Magnum and Higgins chase her to the airport, but her plane has already taken off. Magnum injures his shoulder in a fight with the Antique Dealer's goon and is taken away by the airport police, so Higgins flies after Morgan Fairchild alone. Rick and AJ return to LA to find Morgan Fairchild and the money, and Magnum and his two guys are en route to return the Ki'i to it's Kahuna's island.

There's an older torrent for this episode, but since no one is seeding that one I figured I'd upload my own.
