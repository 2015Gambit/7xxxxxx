You are welcome mates.

GENERAL INFORMATION
Activator ""xf-mccs6.exe"" is created by Team X-FORCE several months ago and used for other Adobe products thousands of thousands time. Team X-FORCE is well known and respected group in the scene. If your security software warns you, it is definitely false positive. I tested it myself (as all of my other torrents).

Yes, it says ""Adobe Acrobat Pro XI has successfully been activated and is ready to use"" but next time you start the program or open a .pdf file, licensing appears again, no matter which serial has been used and there are no such files Armsvc.exe and AcrobatUpdater.exe.

Is there somebody out there who could provide some more serials for testing?!

1. After downloading this torrent install Adobe Acrobat XI Pro as TRIAL version
2. Open Adobe Acrobat XI Pro for a while then close it.
3. Go to C:Windows-System32-drivers-etc then copy hosts to the DESKTOP then open it with notepad and add these lines:
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com
then SAVE.. after that CUT the new hosts and replace it with the one in the drivers-etc..
4. Go to C:Program Files-AdobeAcrobat 11.0-Acrobat and rename the amtlkib.dll to amtlkib.old
5. copy the 'cracked' amtlkib.dll to the location
6. OMG ITS WORKING!! -___- "
