The work of Blackpool's emergency services as they deal with people
suffering mental health problems. Paramedic Sue McGrath is called to
a man with a history of deliberately causing himself harm - tonight
he has run into a taxi - PC Stuart Gornall is confronted by a man
wielding a large knife, and all three services spring into action
when a body is found outside a block of flats, having fallen from
the 14th floor. Is it the result of foul play or has someone finally
lost the battle with their inner demons?
