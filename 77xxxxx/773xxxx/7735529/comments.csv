,roines1987,2012-10-18T18:20Z,"if you game crashes after restarting the game, then try this fix, it worked for me.
Google this: MARK OF THE NINJA V1.0 ALL NO-DVD [THETA]
and download it.
but remember to start the game from the inside folder game.exe and not the one named mark of the ninja laying on the desktop, well replace it ofcourse. enjoy"
