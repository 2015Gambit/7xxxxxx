Real Hide IP is a privacy software which allows you to conceal your IP address, choose IP country and surf anonymously. It can protect your privacy, prevent identity theft, and guard against hacker intrusions, all with the click of a button. Using it, you can conceal your identity online by showing these websites a fake IP which you can choose from different countries in Choose IP Country window, blocking hackers and prying eyes from knowing your true location or identity. You can easily change between fake IP and real IP. When you stop running Real Hide IP, your web browser settings will revert back to normal (without the fake IP). Real Hide IP automatically configures your web browser to use our proxy server. You can automatically change your IP address every few minutes or hide your IP address when you start your computer. Real Hide IP works with Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Maxthon, MyIE and is compatible with all types of routers, firewalls, home networks, wireless networks, and any other kind of internet connection.
