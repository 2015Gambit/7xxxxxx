,TheBadElf,2012-10-16T00:03Z,Is this downloading for anyone?  Or is my torrent client being stupid again?
,MagiciansFR,2012-10-16T01:26Z,Not working
,MagiciansFR,2012-10-16T01:27Z,"88 connected, all at 0%, no seeds connected."
,MagiciansFR,2012-10-18T00:52Z,"This is still not working for most people. I see over a hundred at 0% and it stays that way for days. At one time I saw 5 seeders listed here. but no seeders show up on BitComet and no file transfer takes place. If there really were 5 seeders at one time, what did they do to be able to download. BTW, my BitComet is the latest version."

But yeah, this one's fake."
,okalifon,2012-10-20T23:31Z,I managed to get my hands on the epub version of this book. Already made it part of my upload but it won't upload the whole without the file before it and after it.
,szeromski,2012-10-20T23:58Z,"Then make a new torrent of that epub and upload, maybe?"
,MadMcAl,2012-10-21T07:53Z,"You can get the epub here:
http://gallery.mobile9.com/f/2829231/

Just have to rename the .mpg to an .epub."
,Blueskyes,2012-10-28T20:38Z,got it in minutes from the place above me(gallery.mobile9.com) and i didn't have to rename anything................Firefox opened it ...no problem at all....half an hour and this(choking the rest) being the only torrent working but i'm still stuck at 99.4%........its ok though........the epub file within works...%)
,Blueskyes,2012-11-04T10:45Z,"days later and i'm still at 99.4%...........oh well, as i said earlier...........some of the files work and some don't.................. %) "
