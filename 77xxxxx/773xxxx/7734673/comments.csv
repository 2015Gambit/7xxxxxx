,AngeloCardesteus,2012-10-18T22:47Z,"@baroku - It says it in the description.

@smatchimo - I saw about 140 on tunngle today.

@orrzxz - it finished in an hour for me, you could be getting throttled

Tunngle works by opening the console with ""~"" key and typing ""open x.xxx.xxx.xxx"" replace the x's with the ip of the host. You will need to change your game User ID which I have not yet found out how to do."
,AngeloCardesteus,2012-10-19T03:44Z,"actually, you don't need to edit your user id, you can though change your name once you are in a server by typing ""setname xxxxx"" in the console ""~"""

,DirkGntly,2012-10-22T07:53Z,"haha. I raged pretty hard for a second before coming here to read the comments. Editing the .ini was tricky, I had to open the folder properties and disable 'read-only' and then click apply but NOT ok. after clicking 'ok' it reverted back to read-only."

,Kalawar,2012-10-23T13:35Z,How do I play through Tunngle? 
,Infirer,2012-10-23T14:59Z,"@Kalawar
I've asked people on Tunngle, and i haven't figured it all out yet but try and take a look at 'AngeloCardesteus' comments. Helped me.."
,Infirer,2012-10-23T18:29Z,"@Kalawar
Did it. Found out how to play on Tunngle.
- Open Tunngle and enter one of the 'Chivalry: Medieval Warfare' lobbys.
- Open the game through Tunngle.
- Open the console (the button opening the console varies between a couple of different buttons according to which keyboard type you use. Until now i know of ~, ½, ö. one of those should open your console.)
- When in console write 'open x.xxx.xxx.xxx' replace the x's with the ip of the host.
- You should now automatically join the server.
- BE SURE TO CHANGE YOUR NAME when logging into the server. This you do by opening the console and write 'setname xxxxx' if you try to join a server and the error 'Duplicate UID' occurs this is because someone on the server haven't changed their name and there can't exist two players with the same names on one server. (standard name should be something like 'RLD!' i believe)."
,hugoneon,2012-10-24T00:21Z,"@mzisette

Just read kid

* Open game_folder/Engine/Config/BaseEngine.ini

I un- and re-installed it 3 times, trying run as admin on the setup and leaving languange on RUS or setting it to INT. nothing seemed to work."
,irishmight,2012-10-25T20:07Z,is there a way to find servers through tunngle rather then having to wait for someone to post a working ip in the chat?
,Yiu113,2012-10-25T22:21Z,"Wish I could actually get to the language files.

Not able to find them, despite following exactly what I was told to do."
,FatMarauder,2012-10-26T23:55Z,how do i change the language people please i really want to play the game.  >:(
,Jcomliller,2012-10-27T18:06Z,I keep spining in the game uncontrollably? any ideas why?
,thamaligz,2012-10-27T21:04Z,Maybe try setting your mouse sensitivity down?? (not sure if spelled right)
,Infirer,2012-10-27T22:17Z,"@irishmight
I don't believe there is. i've been playing for about a week on tunngle, so except if you find a site on the web with a 24 hour server supporting the cracked version.
Though i don't think it's that big a problem once you get used to it. people post ip's on tunngle all the time. Therefore my advice would be that you open the tunngle chivalry lobby 5-10 minutes before playing, making you able to look in the latest chat history and won't have to camp the chat until someone posts an ip working.."
,SpaceCadet6969754,2012-10-28T04:18Z,"To change Language it might be different folder if you using x86.
C:Program Files (x86)Chivalry Medieval WarfareEngineBaseEngine - копия.ini
C:Program Files (x86)Chivalry Medieval WarfareEngineBaseEngine.ini

Open them with text editor like notepad, go to edit click find type 'language'.
Where it says, 
; The language used by the engine
Language=RUS
Change it to Language=INT, in both files, do not need to lock them.
Start game, will be in English."
,davidxdavidson,2012-10-31T16:02Z,"So I can't seem to change my name in the game. I've tried doing it via console, where I type ""setname xxxxx"" without the quotation marks, as well as via the DefaultGameUDK.ini file. I've saved the ini file, and when I open it up, it shows that I DID change my nickname, yet I can rarely play due to a dupe UID error, and when I can finally get onto a server, my name shows up as something like player270 or something similar. Tried googling, but no luck as of yet. Any suggestions?"
,OmarKH,2012-10-31T22:18Z,"I haven't tried the Tunngle thing yet, but when I enter training, and even on the lowest video setting, the game is very laggy
I can run ACR on medium-low settings without any lagging
Do I need to apply some patches or something?"
,Shatbird,2012-11-01T00:46Z,"Okay, so I followed the directions to change to English, when i click save it says i have no permission to save, SOLUTION. I dragged the ""BaseEngine"" file to my desktop and edited once more, and dragged it back to the config folder. POOF it works ;)"

,davidxdavidson,2012-11-01T14:21Z,"@BoazCStrike

Just do what everyone does when there's a dll file missing from anything; google the specific file. There's a decent chance that it'll be available for download. If it's not available, just redownload the game."

,Vallencre,2012-11-08T00:32Z,"Extremely poor torrent, you are required to edit files in order to utilize it because the original cracker was too fucking stupid to figure out how to do it himself, but managed to configure it so that every time you change the permissions, they immediately revert to a setting that will not allow you to edit files. This means no english, no unlocked weapons, and no working multiplayer about 50% of the time due to the duplicate ID error that you cannot fix because you cannot edit anything."
