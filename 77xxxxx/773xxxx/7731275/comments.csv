First, it is not necessary to download the entire Flood if you want only a few titles. Second, many of use download the entire flood in order to browse through them and do our own background research. We keep the ones that we want to read and delete the rest. It is rather idiotic to expect anyone to read an entire Flood. People have different tastes in literature and that is the whole point of a Flood!"

MarcelP i saw your upload and the TODO list and it was too inviting to let go.

I was able to process the data into the form below. Will it help ? Basically i grouped it on the author's (full) name.

I can always change the presentation and formatting. Let me know.

how:
I collated the lists, sanitized them so that each line starts with the author(s) name and ends in the book. Did a bit of data manipulation.

Thanks  Sector Vector, but I cannot  seem to get these fles on Calibre, and  it wants me to download a program  to watch them on my pc , not my e reader. :(  Thank you anyways for the effort!"
,SectorVector,2012-10-25T17:49Z,"fundycoast,
Here are the separate links to the epub files themselves. I had archived them using ""WinRAR"" program. I presumed you might know how to handle it. :)

There is also a ""Violets of March"" by Sarah Jio. Let me know if you want me to upload that as well. I had included it in the earlier link (which is still available).

once again you can browse all BBS's epub uploads here: http://bayfiles.com/file/oFyT/yGSoIj/bbs_epub_floods_1_to_29.rar

To open the above file (after downloading) you need only to install the WinRAR program.

This one looks good. (Haven't tried myself though).

Good Luck."

Go to Tools>Option>Files

Uncheck:Automatically Download to default Directory(No Prompt)

 (It's right Underneath ""Default Directory"")

Download the multifile torrent you want,when Vuze opens you will see a dialog box,give it a moment to load the files after it loads in the dialog box, you can choose the files you want by Checking/un-checking them off

This is for the latest Vuze:V4.8.0.0/4 az3

I'm pretty sure it will work on others.Let me know if you have any problems :)"
