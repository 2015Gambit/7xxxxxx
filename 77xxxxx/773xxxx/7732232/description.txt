Notes

K reason for READNFO ther are still sum occasional borders due to cam movement, it is CAM audio but nice
CAM audio and do see a few ppl get up in the beginning of movie but thats about it.. b4 anybody bitches bout
it missign stuff.. IMDB RUNTIME is 95 minutes includign credits and shit.. our encode is 88 minutes but missign the credits
but did our usual thing and turned out nice... enjoy til sumthign better comes along..
Got tired if waiting for LiNE to show up so enjoy a nice 720 CAM..

PS the movie is kinda dark since most of it takes place in a buildin but it is still watchable
