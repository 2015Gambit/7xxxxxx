,ghostrx,2012-10-16T22:02Z,Thanks!
,NeoJoe090,2012-10-17T01:54Z,The installation isn't in English and my computer doesn't even have the font package it needs. I'll post whether everything else worked alright for the actual game in just a bit.
,NeoJoe090,2012-10-17T02:34Z,"OK the good news is: the game itself is in English. The bad news is: the game kept crashing on the title screen as I was changing settings. I'm sure it has to do with the firewall or something though. But, other than that, the graphics are gorgeous, runs smooth and is pre-cracked. Enjoy!"
,.Leto.,2012-10-17T09:31Z,"A bit annoying that the installation isn't in English but you can guess where to click so it's not really a problem. The game is running fine, mine isn't crashing, and it's already cracked. About Doom 1 and 2 I was hoping that this would be new HD versions but these are the original ones. Still fun but graphics are of course completely outdated.
Thanks."
