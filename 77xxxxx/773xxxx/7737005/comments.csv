,pheonyx74,2012-10-17T22:15Z,I know that The Man in Black 5 can be found elsewhere but it is a Marvel release. Why do the Dark Tower issues get left out?
,sin__eater2,2012-10-17T23:11Z,"616 Universe or GTFO! jks

In all honesty this is my first weekly torrent I was just tired of waiting for someone else to do it so I did it myself. I don't read Dark Tower so I wouldn't have even known to include it.

Also apparently the stupid Babies issues has been delayed till next week so this is only missing the Punisher MAX issue (those usually don't show up for a few weeks anyhow for some odd reason)"
