Around 40% of all users on Steam still use Windows XP. Instead of talking shit, why don't you try giving some useful advice instead."
,Lflipper,2012-10-26T23:47Z,Mine said that it failed to initialize and to try re-installing ? 
,MYRDDiN86,2012-10-28T11:58Z,Game won't run on XP. It throws some error about mapbuffer... But under Win8 it runs flawlessly.
