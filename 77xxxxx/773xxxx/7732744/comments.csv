,pryingeyes,2012-10-16T17:16Z,"Appreciate the effort, but next time please search before you upload. There were already SEVERAL DOZEN versions of this on here with more than 1,000 combined seeders. Duplicate files spread out the seeders and slow down DLs for everyone. They also increase the clutter on the site.

You also should have indicated whether this was 14.0, 14.1, etc. Microsoft issued significant updates to its 2011 Mac product."
,Zippatuh,2012-10-16T17:58Z,"Thank you for the feedback; I'm learning, very much still new to this.  I'll do some research next time.

Do I need to take it down?  Hell, is that even possible, LOL...

Anyway; here is what the version information is:

MO11:  Version 14.1.0 ( 110310 )

I'm running the update on it now which is downloading:

MO11: Version 14.2.3 Update & MOER for Mac 2.2.8

The ""check for updates"" and installation seems to be going without any error at the moment..."
,Zippatuh,2012-10-16T18:28Z,"Okay, yeah...  Stupid about the ""take it down"" question...

The upgrades worked fine.  There were two that bring it to the current release:

MO11 Update One:  14.2.3 ( 120616 )

MO11 Update Two:  14.2.4 ( 120824 ) 
        Stable Release date of September 19th, 2012

It's also the ""Standard"" version and appears to have everything except for SharePoint.  It might be there...  I didn't see it but it's SharePoint...

Thanks again and I'll pay more attention next time."

@ Zippatuh -

Hey, thanks for your efforts and generous sharing!

Extra kudos for your response to constructive criticism - it is rare around most sites!

Very refreshing, and very welcomed!

PS- keep it up!  We Mac users appreciate it and like to see our standards be just a little higher than the immature asswipes who can make this a miserable place!  :)
