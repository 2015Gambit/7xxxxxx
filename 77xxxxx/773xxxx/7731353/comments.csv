No, TPB releases the torrent for download as soon as it's posted by the uploader.

You can't.

@Bhaskarbs
The updates I made only works on Ultimate! If you delete that file and install any other version than Ultimate you won't get any of the updates I added!
Why would you want the Professional version?"
,murphy78,2012-10-21T03:02Z,"Greetings sir, I just wanted to introduce myself.  For the last month and a half or so, I have been making similar updated windows isos.  I'm guessing that my methods and files are a bit different than yours, but I wanna say that I'm a big fan of having updated windows versions with no added programs, tweaks, or mods other than simple updates.

If you ever want to pick my brain or just yell at me, feel free to send me a message on the forum.

Take care,
murphy78"
,fpslucass,2012-10-21T12:27Z,"@Maherz
Thanks for everything, you're truly awesome :)
Also sorry for the noobness but after I install this do I have to wait for you to put up the next version / set of updates or can I download them like normal through Windows? Do I have to turn off automatic updates?"
,wyxoR,2012-10-21T13:14Z,Will download this later. Thanks.
,shabby360,2012-10-21T14:22Z,Is it really Service Pack 1?
,Heartofthorns,2012-10-22T14:42Z,"@ fpslucass
Activate your windows using Daz loader (it's in Maherz's torrent list if you want it) and then you can use Windows Update to download updates without problems.

@ shabby360
Ofcourse it is."
,Bhaskarbs,2012-10-22T19:50Z,"thanx Maherz for a quick reply :) 

i got what u wanna say so i jst reformatted a clean ultimate OS from ur iso image & really it works like a charm :)

,GingerWig,2012-10-22T21:22Z,"Is it possible to burn it to more then one cd because
i only have 700mbs cd's?"
,fpslucass,2012-10-24T00:58Z,"Ok thanks very much for the answers guys, I promise this will be my last question. I'm paranoid that if i turn on Windows Update's automatic updates there might be a security fix or something that can undue whatever Windows Loader did for me. Any chance of that? Also, is turning off automatic updates harmful to my computer?

@GingerWig
No. It has to be a DVD. However, I used a flash drive. There are instructions on how to do so around page 32-34 of the support site - http://www.nomaher.com/forum/index.php?topic=137.0"
,Heartofthorns,2012-10-24T14:26Z,"@ fpslucass
If you're really so much paranoid :P, go to Windows Update > Change Settings. There select the ""Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them"" option in the drop down list.
Now when updates are available, select which updates you want to install and which you don't want to.

If you permanently don't want to install an update, right click on that update and select ""Hide update"".
If you want to restore any updates you have hidden, click on ""Restore Hidden Updates"" and select which ones you want to."

,GamesGr,2012-10-25T13:12Z,Is this a permanent Windows 7?
,james_phil,2012-10-26T06:16Z,Anyone does this windows7 has a product key and does it pass Microsoft genuine validation.  
,Heartofthorns,2012-10-26T15:19Z,"@ GamesGr
After installing this windows you'll have to install Daz loader. Here's the link https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7463060/Windows_Loader_2.1.7_By_Daz
That makes the windows permanent. This windows is untouched. Read the torrent description.

@ james_phil
Same as above. Install Daz loader after installing windows. After that you can update windows and it passes genuine validation as well. Read the loader's description."

,dakins44,2012-11-01T20:33Z,"I created an account specifically to say Thank You Maherz! 

My 4 year old laptop harddrive was on the verge of collapse from a combination of bad sectors and corrupt drivers on Vista Home Premium. I had managed to fix the sectors but not the OS - countless error messages, slow performance, no sound etc. but somehow hanging on.

Dreading a complete reinstall I found info online about upgrading as a fix rather than full install. Still couldn't fix it from my own repair and system discs. Downloaded 3 Vista OS torrents from TPB but with these, still no option to upgrade just install.

When I found info about an upgrade from Vista Home Premium to 7 Ultimate, I decided to take a chance and naturally came across your torrent.

After a week of failed attempts because the compatibility check froze, it finally managed to take hold yesterday and performed the upgrade. Finally success! After downloading the security updates and only one driver for my modem, the upgrade was flawless, activated the daz loader and the OS as well as all drivers have been functioning perfectly. All of my programs were saved!

I like that 7 Ultimate has a create image and repair disc feature which I immediately did. 
When this harddrive does eventually fail, I'll be ready and will of course be keeping an eye on the updates in case a sneaky validation one comes through. Btw, none came up from MS Update.

So Thank You 1000x Maherz, your work is outstanding and you have helped me avoid a mental and financial headache! Long live TPB!"

,JeffTheBLUR,2012-11-04T19:32Z,Ok I am not a person who uses antivirus so I do not get false positives and such I just run cleaners everyt now and again anyways thats not why I am posting here I am posting here to let the Uploader know that I have found issues with this version Starting with the fact that every 10 minutes or so I get the You have files waiting to be written to cd and whenever I open a folder whatever the folder is named I get an application inside the folder with the name of the folder its in and it is always 45kb its very annoying having to delete them constantly every time I open a folder I also notice 3-4 strange processes that appear to be normal necessary processes but they are fakes idk what the hell they are doing but they are named in lowercase letters in the description one is 
,JeffTheBLUR,2012-11-04T19:42Z,csrss.exe normally that process has no description and another is winlogon.exe which normally has no description and also the ones that are real are there too thats how I know they are fake another reason I know they are fake is if you try to end process tree for winlogon.exe (the real one) it logs you off and when I do that to the fake one it ends it and the csrss.exe when I end process tree to the real one it won't let me end it whereas the fake one will that is just a couple examples of that problem another thing is whenever you access any antivirus and such cleaners that are harmful to viruses/rootkits/spyware etc. etc. it just restarts my computer and another issue I have is my computer randomly opes a cached webpage  called  about.Brontok.A actually that is a virus that is described to do all the things I have mentioned thus far
,Heartofthorns,2012-11-05T14:16Z,"@ JeffTheBLUR
Dude, obviously get an antivirus and remove the virus. Also get a firewall. There's free and good firewalls like Comodo. If you're so annoyed by false positives, just ignore them/ add them to exceptions. There are good free ones like avast or avg, if you want paid ones, search for torrents, kaspersky, bitdefender, eset nod32 are good, or buy them if you want, your wish. But seriously, browsing the internet without a good antivirus and firewall is like having unprotected intercourse, you get what you want plus something extra..."

,DaRkSe7eN,2012-11-09T18:00Z,Can i unlock All Editions of Windows 7 using this copy?..
,RebirthUSER,2012-11-15T02:55Z,"Suggestion to Maherz:

On your next release, please include the Windows Loader v1.9.5 on our ISO.

Some uploaders did this. They save it under Support then under Crack folder.

This way, we only need to download ISO and after installation, run the Windows Loader directly from the installer.

And last but not the least, thanks for sharing this. :)"
