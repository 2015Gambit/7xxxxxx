[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-16T22:55Z,"People screaming at me via utorrent aint gonna make it come quicker k? Heres my net situation, i havent paid a bill in 7 months and i had to crack a 25 digit alphanumerical code just to stay online, yup cracked wifi that i dont have control over the box on so my speeds are capped at like 60kbs, if i could get it out faster i would, me sending you the file thru email, not happening, why would i stop everyones ability to give you a copy you ""promise"" to seed. You just want a copy for yourself. Takes a special breed of person to hand over their bandwidth for 6 million people to suck the tits off. Remember that before you complain about speeds. I aint capping ya, my signal and isp are capping it. Nothing i can do there. Doesnt matter which os im in. So please, knock off the complaining on the torrents cuz of speed. If anything your hurting the speed sending me crap complaining about the speed."
,DistendedCapacitor,2012-10-19T13:32Z,"idk wtf is up with the commenting.. but i posted two msg on 1080, just fyi, as i cant see em come up.
but, all this stratos shit aside.... 

did you really manage to crank a damn near 28g dictlist into less than 100mB!? xD

fuckin uber brownie points on that one haha."
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-19T14:48Z,"LOL! Thats a funny story actually, there is a fella on YT trying to sell bandwidth for that download. Problem is the download can be pulled without paying at capped speeds, after waiting 2 days for them to even give me details on logging in i started a claim, got my money back and got their list. Trust me I've been trying to figure out how they actually did it with winrar as well considering im trying to pack a soundpool pack. 

For the comments on this, its a generalization of all these rips that i uploaded. Theres been constant whining, bitching, false flagging, etc all on these simply cuz people are mad they cant get a FREE file for NOTHING fast enough. They even chose to ignore that im on a capped cracked wifi connection and still decide to whine at me. "
,HelicopterBen,2012-10-21T16:53Z,i'll seed for ya

Yeah, there seems to be more and more people that just BITCH on here. Like the other day when i was downloading a program, which is freeware anyways, this guy posted like five fucking comments saying things like ""WTF, upload PAID software asshole."" and, ""Why is this taking so long to download?"" 
aprox 5 people commented in response to him saying things like ""You dont like it, dont download it fucktard."" and, ""You are seriously going to bitch about how long it takes to get something for free?""

I blame google for the retards and LeechLejun figuring out how to use this place. Back in the day, the only people here for the most part were the more ""computer & internet experienced."" 

 Oh well.. more cows to keep the bulls from slaughter.... "
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-26T15:38Z,"ROFL! Yeah my skull means a lot to me, i work hard, was a member here for years before i got it. I'm not about to say screw it on any my torrents, they are always well seeded by me, unfortunately im limited on bandwidth and only seed for a limited time (usually like a month before I pull them) but i do ensure the seed ratios up before i stop the uploading tho."
