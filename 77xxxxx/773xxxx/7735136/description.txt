-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meticulously crafted but also ponderous and predictable, James Cameron's 1989 deep-sea close-encounter epic reaffirms one of the oldest first principles of cinema: everything moves a lot more slowly underwater. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as formerly married petroleum engineers who still have some "issues" to work out, are drafted to assist a gung-ho Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) with a top-secret recovery operation: a nuclear sub has been ambushed and sunk, under mysterious circumstances, in some of the deepest waters on earth, and the petro-techies have the only submersible craft capable of diving down that far. Every image and every performance is painstakingly sharp and detailed (and the computerized water creatures are lovely) but the movie's lumbering pace is ultimately lethal. It's the audience that ends up feeling waterlogged. For a guy who likes guns as much as Cameron (his next film after all, was the body-count masterpiece Terminator 2: Judgment Day), it's interesting that the moral balance here is weighted heavily in favor of the can-do engineers; the military types are end-justifies-the-means amoralists, just like the weasely government bureaucrats in Aliens.[/color]

This is the only true widescreen anamorphic version of The Abyss ever to be released, literally all other region versions have been cropped 4.3 with black bars and due to this have very low resolution, also other region versions have had parts of the movie cut- which adds another 28 mins to the film. 
This ReEncoded Version is totally uncut and for the first time true widescreen.
 This was personally encoded by me, Carjacker from the =Uncut Special Edition= DVD.
Leave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see. Thanks!
