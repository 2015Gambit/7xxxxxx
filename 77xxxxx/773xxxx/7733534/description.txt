Arrr pirate!

Today I want to share FORD RACING 2 with you. The full version, not a trial version, like an other pirate did.
And yes, it works on Windows 7 (finally). I tried it out, and no errors occured.
Trust me.



"In name and in practice, Ford Racing 2 is designed to update and improve the stock car action while retaining the features and feel that fans appreciated in the original Ford Racing. This sequel by Razorworks, developer of Total Immersion Racing, offers over 30 Ford vehicles from a wide range of automotive styles and eras, such the Gran Torino, the Focus Rally, classic and modern Thunderbirds and Mustangs, and even an F-150 based on the 2004 model. Races take place in a variety of venues that include oval tracks, rally routes, and street courses."
