DON'T FORGET TO SEED FOR OTHER PEOPLE!"
,Hatiloou,2012-10-16T20:15Z,"After you installed it, please tell me if it worked.
It's my first torrent, so..."
,alivepl,2012-10-16T21:14Z,"It's working fine on Win7/64, but the game is in russian."
,GoodGravy,2012-10-16T21:38Z,"You could have mentioned that the menus are in Russian, apart from that, it does work with no viruses."
,Hatiloou,2012-10-16T21:59Z,"@alivepl

Try out the Game configuration. Usually under ""Language Selection"" you could choose an other language. If not, then it's crazy cuz I can play it on English, German, Spanish etc."
,Hatiloou,2012-10-16T22:05Z,"If you search it, the configurator is under:

""Ford Racing 2CONFIGsyscfg.exe"""
,alivepl,2012-10-16T22:35Z,"I've tried that too, if you choose English the game is in russian."
,Hatiloou,2012-10-16T23:56Z,"Hm. That's weirdo.

Damn and I thought this one was perfect.

Well, on my PC it works perfectly. I don't know why it doesn't works for you. I have the excactly same version.
Fck man."
,Hatiloou,2012-10-17T00:02Z,"I delete this torrent, cause it's not working correctly. Maybe I'll upload the REAL version later.
c ya"
,Hatiloou,2012-10-20T23:20Z,"Can't delete, so... who cares :P"
