,hannah899,2012-10-30T22:13Z,"What happened to episode 5 and 6? If somebody knows please answer me! 

Last week I thought it was some kind of special show airing instead of HIMYM, I couln't know since I don't live there. But this week there's no episode either, yet I see on their facebook page things like ""don't forget to tune in to this nights all new episode!"" etc - so I know it has aired over there!

What happened?"

What happened? I get that Hurricane Sandy is the reason for episode 6, but episode 5 was last week so that shouldn't have been a problem."
,Phlanck,2012-10-31T17:48Z,episode 5 was for this week not last week. (check wiki. they had a break week for some reason) so there's no episode 5 this week cause of Sandy
,Kate369,2012-11-01T05:50Z,Pls upload How I Met Your Mother-8x05-Autumn Of Breakups it has already cum.....
,tp_dubai_007,2012-11-01T07:14Z,So it look like hurricane has hit rough. Just hope VTV guy/gal is safe.
