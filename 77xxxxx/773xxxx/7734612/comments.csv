,KosmicHadj,2012-10-18T02:02Z,"I can't believe that 20th century fox would attach it's name/brand to this gobbage (in mike tyson voice). As a horror, gore, and macabre fan, I've seen many movies in fitting these categories. some good. some horrible. I have to state that this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. 

the acting was horrendous. the story line was complete trash. and the wrong turn series will never rebound from this. 
this critique is for those who haven't seen this junk yet."

,Fritz.,2012-10-18T04:44Z,the thing that confuses me is how anyone who has seen any of the previous wrong turn movies could expect to see a top quality film here.
,satakas,2012-10-18T05:16Z,Does the sudden coming of this movie have anything to do with the recent coming of Apple maps?
,encho1989,2012-10-18T08:03Z,big movie sex and horror
,Kikee_31,2012-10-18T08:50Z,Thanks again scene4all

,CrysisHawk,2012-10-18T11:51Z,Thanks a lot :)Too Early That's what i like
,andyb02,2012-10-18T21:42Z,"A/10 V/10

It's a B movie.  Effects, acting, and set are all pretty bad.  The town their in you can tell is just a hollywood back lot.  It's worth watching if you're bored.  There's plenty of gore and tits."
,marko8,2012-10-18T22:39Z,thanks
,redonix89,2012-10-18T22:56Z," thank you, this is very much appreciated!"
,end77,2012-10-18T23:02Z,wtf at 44:03 the police woman kisses the guy who's friend is locked up in the cell? isn't that inappropriate?
,Majty,2012-10-18T23:36Z,"I barely managed to make it through the previous movie that had horrible CGI and plot. I dont know why but Im going to check this out and hope I wont eat my own eyes from watching it!

The first movie was good though! :)"
,bighouse5,2012-10-19T15:02Z,Quite stupid and brutal movie. Low budget too. Those guys are killing just for the sake of killing. Dunno what kind of a sick and sadistic person wrote this stuff.
,wizh,2012-10-19T18:08Z,wrong turn 5 suck
,Jamalins,2012-10-19T21:55Z,a/v 8/8 M: Shit
,BUTT_SEX,2012-10-20T09:10Z,This movie was a lot better than what I thought it would be.. Surprised nobody here was over joyed as me to see Doug Bradley (Pinhead from Hellraiser) as one of the bad guys. Makes the movie worth watching alone! :D
,onemurdercr,2012-10-20T13:22Z,thanks for upload

,TheNemmy,2012-10-21T11:07Z,Good Movie Unlike the 3rd one... thanks for the up.
,TheNemmy,2012-10-21T11:07Z,those crying about ending probably don't know that this is a prequel / interequel
,rshkhsee,2012-10-21T18:12Z,"Quality is what youd expect from 600MB...alright enough. What the fuck was Doug Bradley's role in this?? Father, Slave Master to Retards? The movie was good, 4 was a bit better to me though...I love these insane cannibal retards!!"
,RaveHippie,2012-10-22T07:34Z,they should have stopped several movies ago but i'll watch it anyways thanks scene4all
,Amea81,2012-10-23T01:56Z,"A: V: Don't bother.

What a piece of f#%!ing crap!
It gets 1,5/10 only tx to the tits and asses and some decent gore..
But the plot and acting is so awful. I skipped through it."
