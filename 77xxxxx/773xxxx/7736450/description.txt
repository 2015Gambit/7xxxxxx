The novel begins with the arrival of Adam Blaine at the funeral of his estranged father, Ben Blaine, a famous and charismatic writer who has served as patriarch of his clan for many years and left behind him a string of secret legal and financial arrangements, not to mention an emotionally distraught widow and a strangely aloof mistress, who is a beautiful television actress who once had a drug problem. As soon as Adam arrives, he is thrust into the search for his father's killer. Using his training as a CIA operative, Blaine skillfully seeks to find the truth of his father's death, even if it means exposing one or more of his own family members as the killer and discovering secrets about himself that he was never supposed to know.
