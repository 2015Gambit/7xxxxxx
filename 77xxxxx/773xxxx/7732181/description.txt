Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, October 15 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers growing threats made by followers of Obama to riot if their leader is not re-elected in November. "The new threats continue to dominate Twitter and the vast majority make no reference to the mediaΓÇÖs coverage of the issue over the last week, illustrating the fact that they are a legitimate expression of how many Obama voters plan to respond if Romney comes out on top,"reports today. 

Alex also covers the latest news, including developments on the path to world war with the Middle East serving as a catalyst. 

On today's show, Alex talks with Raymond Frank, the 2012 Republican candidate for the sheriff of Travis County, Texas. Frank opposes out of control local government, the use of deadly Tasers by cops, and widespread government revenue enhancement through abusive ticketing.
