- "The Alex Jones Show 09.27.2011 - Jesse Ventura Talks About Death of Dr. Fred Bell.avi

Jesse Ventura tells Alex Jones about what was supposed to be Season 3 of Conspiracy Theory - and how one of their most controversial episodes included an explosive interview with Dr. Fred Bell.  Within 48 hours of that interview, Dr. Bell collapsed of a heart attack.  Ventura states that he had conference calls with his production team concerning this death, and has personal information that he feels he needs to bring to the police - as he strongly suspects foul play.  He was cautious not to reveal too much publically, until the matter can be taken care of legally first.  Rumors suggest the Conspiracy Theory show was to be about MK Ultra and Mind Control.

NOTE: Although Jesse Ventura states that Fred Bell is the brother of radio host Art Bell, this is not true and was a mistake.  Fred Bell was related to Alexander Graham Bell, however...
