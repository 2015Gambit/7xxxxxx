Who's Afraid of Virginia Coleman

When George's overbearing mother Virginia shows
up at the hospital with her sick cat, named
cat," George must heal the cat or risk the
alternative - having to keep her company to
fill the void. Meanwhile, Dorothy counsels Dr.
Leiter who must face the board of directors
before she can settle in at the hospital.
