The behaviour of those macromolecules and molecular assemblies that have vital roles in all living organisms is grounded in physical chemistry. Physical principles determine the stability of proteins and nucleic acids, the rate at which biochemical reactions proceed, the transport of molecules across biological molecules; they allow us to describe structure and reactivity in complex biological systems, and make sense of how these systems operate. Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences fills a void in the textbook market by offering a balanced presentation of the concepts of physical chemistry, and their extensive applications to biology and biochemistry.

- A Biochemical link at the start of each section explains how the physical chemistry content of the section is related to a biological concept, providing clear connections to students and acting as motivators for understanding
- Toolbox sections describe techniques, and link experimental method with physical chemistry concepts, so the student can understand how experimental techniques are used to probe and solve chemical questions
- Maths comments explain mathematical relationships and background necessary for solving problems, providing guidance and insight to bolster student understanding
- Derivations present detailed derivations of key equations, and delineate intermediate steps, showing the student the enormous power of even simple mathematics
- Worked examples illustrate the concepts being presented, empowering the student to apply the concepts for themselves
- Self tests occur throughout the chapters, to enable students to immediately test their understanding
- Checklists of key ideas at the end of each chapter provide a bulleted list of the information students should grasp from the chapter, facilitating student revision
- End of chapter exercises come in three varieties, to enable students to apply the concepts introduced and check their understanding: - Discussion questions stimulate the qualitative understanding of problems
- Exercises assess quantitative understanding - Projects stimulate more in-depth examination of questions at both a qualitative and quantitative level Online Resource Centre
- Web links for each chapter, pointing students to interesting sources of related information and data, to facilitate self-directed learning
- A list of key equations for each chapter, to help students revise and master the key mathematical concepts that underpin the subject
- Living graphs, which present graphs from the text in interactive format, and enable students to strengthen their learning
- Full colour artwork from the text in downloadable form, to facilitate lecture preparation
