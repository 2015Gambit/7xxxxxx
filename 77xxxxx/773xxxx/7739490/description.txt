Unnatural Act es un Stand up del reconocido actor y comico canadiense Jim Carrey, filmado en 1991, justo despues de haber sido contratado por la fox. En el monologo Jim toca temas como sus raices, envejecer, tener orgasmos entre otras cosas, todo visto de una manera muy graciosa y amena.


During the second season of "In Living Color", Jim Carrey began to prepare a stand-up comedy special. Before the special was telecast on Showtime, in November 1991, Jim's mother passed away. Jim dedicated "Jim Carrey's Unnatural Act" to the memory of Kathleen Carrey (aka "Mommsie"). 

The special was taped at Theatre Passe Muraille in front of a live audience. Introduced by a group of dancers, Jim did a mixture of celebrity impressions, observational humor and patter about his troubled family.
