,ReedRichardsInSpace,2012-10-18T04:48Z,Thanks for the upload.  But there are much better ways to get up to speed on the Marvel Universe.  Like wikipedia.  Or word of mouth.  Or not.  What a waste of bandwidth!

,FriendlySpidey,2012-10-18T08:41Z,"I gotta laugh at this ReedRichards fella. How is reading wikipedia a good bet? And a waste of bandwidth? At only 276 mb? What?!?!

Obviously reading the issues themselves is best, but not everyone has time for 25 years of dozens of series. Wikipedia haha. It's pretty admirable what they were attempting with this, however daunting a task it was. Whether it's good or not, I don't know yet, but I appreciate the upload! 

Thanks."
