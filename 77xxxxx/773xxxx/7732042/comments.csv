Your additional scenes really did flesh it out. I saw this one in the theater and have it on disc... I think I prefer your version.

By the way, what about the alternative beggining and ending?"
,lossered78,2012-10-25T04:53Z,can't wait to see this
,avidlivings,2012-10-25T22:45Z,AR is way off - waste of bandwith
,movie55,2012-10-29T07:38Z,"Nice attempt. There are more scenes that should have been added, like the scene where they find the worm and the alternate beginning."
