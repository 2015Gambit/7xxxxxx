,desiemmett,2012-10-17T16:33Z,"Not really a huge fan of NI's stuff- but Guitar Rig is an exception. Maybe the best of its class.
Glad to have this!
Thanks Psy! Always appreciate your efforts.
Installs are seamless.
Users don't forget: you can use these effects on anything, not just guitars."
,ohn1488i,2012-10-24T19:30Z,"This poster has succeeded where so many have failed. I've tried numerous cracks over the last few months and there was always something wrong with each one. A simple thank you by no means expressed my feelings.

This is the real deal and the installs work flawlessly. I've confirmed that:

-It can be opened as a Plug In in Ableton and appears as full version.
-Itâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s the full version in standalone.
-Presets can be loaded and saved from standalone and plugin version.

If you are using a USB interface and you have input levels and no output. It is not the cracks fault, it is the input/output setup. Do this to fix it:
1. Open Finder.
2. Go > Utilities.
3. Open Audio and MIDI.
4. On the bottom left select the + mark to add.
5. Check the USB interface and the output desired. 
6. Save.
7. Switch the Input to the newly created device in Guitar Rig.

Good luck guys and thanks again OP."
