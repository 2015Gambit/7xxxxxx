"The lost language of journalism being spoken on modern television"
Give it a shot - this small, you can afford to gamble, and besides ...
Unless a high quality source shows up, this will have to be my sole XVID offering:

========= IMDB.com/title/tt0115147/

Episode title: J.K.Rowling
Daily.Show.2012.10.15.(Mini).46MB.XVID.480x272.209Kbps.22KHz.80Kbps.AVIGUY.avi

The purpose is to provide really tiny videos (resolution and filesize)
... for tiny screens and tiny storage devices
... and just maybe for those still on dial-up.
Long shots suffer the worst, but close-ups look fairly good.
I have a 32" 1080p monitor two feet in front of my face
...and these look surprising well, considering.
I watch every one complete before I consider posting it.
