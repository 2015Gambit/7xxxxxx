After being banned in the UK, the wait is over for the most controversial movie of the year, Tom Six's follow-up to his original cult horror smash: THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 2 (FULL SEQUENCE)! The opening night selection of Fantastic Fest 2011, the film ups the ante with a brute force unparalleled in motion pictures today. The iconic Dr. Heiter has inspired a real-life protege, the sickly, disturbed security guard Martin - who takes his gory inspiration from the original film to horrific new extremes...and one-ups the doctor with his pièce de résistance, a 12-person human centipede of his own. Ashlynn Yennie, star of The Human Centipede (First Sequence), returns in this no-holds-barred assault on the senses that pushes the limits.

WARNING

Suggested MPAA rating: NC-17 for extreme aberrant content involving violence and sexuality.

Sex & Nudity: 10/10

The whole film is based around a man's sick, disgusting sexual fantasy.

========================

Profanity: 10/10

One very harsh and violent use of "cunt" towards an old woman, accompanied by violence.

The word "fuck" is constantly used throughout the first half of the movie. Though there is little dialogue, the word is used about more than 30 times.

A few uses of "shit."

"Pussy", "piss", "bastard" and "cunt" are all used a few times.

=========================
Frightening/Intense Scenes: 10/10

Take note that the whole film is in black and white so some of the disturbing things in the film you can't see very clearly.

This film is a lot more graphic and disturbing than the first film, and it should be noted it certainly isn't for anybody under 18. Even the cut version will be sickening for audiences of all ages.

The basic plot of the film is a mentally damaged and disturbed man (Martin) who is sexually aroused by a disturbing film and decides to re-enact the film for his own sexual pleasure by violently kidnapping several people and graphically stapling them anus-to-mouth in a long line. When a member of the "centipede" needs to defecate, they violently do so into the mouth of the person behind them.

Though the film lacks intensity, its shocking graphic violent and sexual content is very likely to heavily disturb all audiences.
