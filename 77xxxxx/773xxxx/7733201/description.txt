"Shredder Gods - Refuse to act your age" is the unreleased 2003 album of the band that followed the incredible "Valium 10 Survivors" (released under the name V.A.L. Survivors).
Only steady member was Willy E. Pansen (guitar, vocals), the line-up changed frequently. The album features Marco Mietner (bass, vocals) and Thomas Jansen (drums) and was engineered by Ronni Henseler at Alien Sound.
the album was (due to money-problems) finished within only three days and the band was not really satisfied with the results.
Besides these facts it is a fine piece of Punk Rock from Hamburg.
