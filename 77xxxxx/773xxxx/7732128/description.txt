Murder, He Wrote

Castle and Beckett's plans for a romantic
weekend in the Hamptons are interrupted
when a dying man stumbles into Castle's
backyard, collapsing into his pool. Unable
to escape the lure of the investigation
they join up with the small town's well
intentioned, but inexperienced sheriff to
find the killer
