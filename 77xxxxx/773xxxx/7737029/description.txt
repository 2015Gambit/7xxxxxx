His childish innocence wasn t meant to last long, oh no: When little
 Lucius was born on the meaningful date of June 6th, 1966, nobody
 expected him to be anything other than a normal little boy. His
 childhood, spent in a luxurious manor, was as normal as every kid's
 young years - well, except for the extreme wealth of his parents, as
 Lucius grew up with everything he desired, including several maids
 the family's own butcher and Lucius private teacher
