In 1975 The Sex Pistols officially formed, with their original lineup being Steve Jones (guitar), Paul Cook (drums), Glen Matlock (bass), and the newly recruited John Lydon aka Johnny Rotten (vocals).

Then in 1977, Sid Vicious replaced Glen Matlock prior to the release of the band's classic album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, which ripped through the UK and the rest of the planet like a dose of the salts.

The group's controversial image guaranteed them instant success, with this original punk band snubbing its studded nose at anything conventional: the government, fashion, society in general, and the more established bands that the Pistols regarded as being stagnant and boring.

But the Sex Pistols' controversial reputation also overshadowed the band's musical ability, which fired on all eight cylinders - particularly the original lineup.

In November, 2007, Lydon, Matlock, Cook and Jones re-formed to play one gig at the Brixton Academy in London, which due to public demand became five sold-out nights, with the resulting DVD being one of the greatest live rock DVDs of all time.

Unlike some of the groups that the Sex Pistols despised in the seventies and that have since re-formed to cash in on the booty of performing world tours, the Pistols kicked butt for the entire performance and showed they were THE band to use as a yardstick.

Paul Cook has to be one of the world's hardest working drummers, Glen Matlock lays down a solid bass that enables Steve Jones to soar with his raw but unpretentious guitar, and the enigmatic John Lydon still scowls at the Establishment, but would give a pint of his punk blood to any of the band's loyal fans in attendance.

There are no laser lights or huge inflatable dummies, no ostentatious speeches about saving the planet by musicians pretending to be philosophers. This is hard-driving, unadulterated rock at its finest, at a time when music needs a good rock enema more than ever.
