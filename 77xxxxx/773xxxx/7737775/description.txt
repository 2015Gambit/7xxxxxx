Prager 20121017     3 Debate Two, Three

Prager H3: Dennis continues to deconstruct the debate, clip by clip. He concludes with Candy CrowleyΓÇÖs 
 egregious favoring of the President on the Benghazi issue, yet another smoking gun of liberal bias.
 Callers weigh in.



Prager 20121017     2 Debate Two, Two

Prager H2: Dennis plays clips from the debate and analyzes them. Romney made many strong arguments,
 but rapped out singles when he could have hit home runs. The problem is that heΓÇÖs a ΓÇ£tree personΓÇ¥ and 
 not a ΓÇ£forest personΓÇ¥ as Dennis likes to put it; that is, Romney focuses on specific problems 
 often at the expense of the big picture.



Prager 20121017     1 Debate Two

Prager H1: Dennis was frustrated by the format which trivialized the seriousness of the occasion.
 It was overly theatrical, the questions were not interesting and the posturing by both candidates
 not dignifiedΓÇª 
 Candy Crowley injected herself into the debate in completely inappropriate ways, especially on the Benghazi
 issue.
