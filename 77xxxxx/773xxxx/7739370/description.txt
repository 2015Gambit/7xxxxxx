Nazi Collaborators 
This series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. "How could they have done it?" How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. At the heart of this 13 part series lies one uneasy question. If you had faced what these people had faced, might you have done the same thing - and danced with the devil? 

9)  Jews who Fought for Hitler 
Imagine your country strips you of all your rights, threatens you and deports you. This is what happened to the Jews in 1930s Germany, thanks to Adolf Hitler's racial policies. This terrible situation was faced not only by Germany's practising Jews but also by Germans who didn't even think they were Jewish. Most were Christians - who just happened to have distant Jewish relatives.
The Nazis had a name for them, the "Mischlinge" or half-breeds. Amazingly, many "Mischlinge" and even some Jews would still fight for Hitler. Some even joined the murderous SS. It begged the question: "Why?" This is the strange story of the Jews who fought for Hitler. Told through the amazing personal stories of those Jews or so-called "Mischlinge" caught up in Hitler's hateful policies. Some of them are still alive today and provide testimony in the first person. Now they explain in their own words what it was like to fight for the very country that wanted to kill them and their relatives.
