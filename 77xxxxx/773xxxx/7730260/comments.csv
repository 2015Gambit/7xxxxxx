,rainmaker7,2012-10-18T08:57Z,"""ePUB Book Flood"" collections are absolutely useless and I don't get it why someone would download them! You won't read those books anyway! Just a collection of random books on random topics. When you shop on Amazon, do you click on random books, buy them and then read them without doing a background check on what the book is about? Geez... 

I love reading and already built up a nice collection of well-selected books in epub format, but when I downloaded several ""ePub book flood"" collections and saw the contents, I couldn't believe what a bunch of crap those were! 

When you go shopping for food, you SELECT the items you want to eat, right?! You don't buy something just because it is eatable (unless you have mental problems). The same about reading: if you have basic intelligence, you wouldn't ready ANYTHING just because it contains text / words."
[V],bigbluesea,2012-10-18T14:29Z,"@rainmaker7

Really!?

Your going to start spamming my comment page,Your opinion is your own.Don't you have anything else better to do.

If you don't like the collection Don't download it ,don't look at it.

By making stupid comments no body cares about, it's Obvious you are mentally unstable and unhappy.Do me a favor go be unhappy somewhere else.Your opinion is yours alone.

GET A LIFE!"
[V],bigbluesea,2012-10-18T14:35Z,"@rainmaker7

One more thing,if you had basic intelligence,you would have looked at the title list then decide if your going to download or not,instead of downloading the entire collection to read the titles"
,NekodaLolita,2012-10-21T21:05Z,Um not to be a bother but but I have a tiny request...pleasepleasepleasepleaaaase make a mobi file or pdf file as i can convert them to mobi....of all the books written by Jeaniene Frost...
