Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, October 16 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers continued threats against Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Having already threatened to riot if Obama is unsuccessful in securing a second term, Obama supporters are also flooding Twitter with threats to assassinate Mitt Romney if he wins the presidential election. He also covers the Pentagon's effort to exploit the Hollywood re-boot of Superman to introduce the world to the most expensive weapons program in human history, the new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jet plane. Alex also covers the latest news on the international and home-front and takes your calls on today's worldwide broadcast.

Note: As is becoming regular practice when Alex has a guest on who is also a business partner, Peter Glidden's appearance is not mentioned in the official show description. Glidden, a naturopath, is on the Medical Advisory Board of Youngevity (as are veterinarian Joel Wallach, dentist Cory Gold and pharmacist Ben Fuchs).
