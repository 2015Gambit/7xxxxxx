,S3tekh,2012-10-16T10:29Z,"Awesome, thanks dude! We don't get the latest from  adventure time and regular show in our country. And if we get it its dubed and shit >.>"
,boyak42ha,2012-10-16T12:34Z,Thanks!
,kinglou0,2012-10-16T14:45Z,"Thanks for keeping current with Regular Show.

Any way you could post a .mkv version of this?

Smaller file size helps me carry this show on my tablet."
,gomanski,2012-10-16T18:34Z,"You are doing God's work, sir. +1000 internets.

@kinglou0 â&#x20AC;&#x201D;Â just reencode it yourself with Handbrake? You have the raw encode to do it with."
,agekindly,2012-10-16T22:28Z,"Dont really mind the format change just be thankful this man is uploading for us at all you know? He seems to be the only one with high quality Regular Show & Adventure Time at least on The Pirate Bay so thank you kind sir

AAC Stereo - Audio

Did I miss something?"
,tadchav,2012-10-17T01:09Z,Great man ty vehry maauushhhh
,kinglou0,2012-10-17T01:15Z,"@gomanski-I ended up doing that.

@dwjp90-Sorry to complain about the file format. You did all the hard work.  
It's nothing for me to re-encode your file.
Thanks for posting."
,mhamer6,2012-10-17T05:18Z,So does anyone know how to remove itunes protection from tv shows cause I have 1080i episodes from season 4 that I wanna upload on here

,mhamer6,2012-10-17T05:21Z,I'm gonna buy the season pass for this season of regular show too on itunes and I wanna upload that for you guys in case you want 1080i
,dwjp90,2012-10-17T06:23Z,"WOAH, How did my ts raw make it up here?

Sorry guys this was my raw file before conversion to MKV.  

Gimme 2 mins."
,mhamer6,2012-10-17T06:29Z,its onlys the first 11 minutes -_-
,dwjp90,2012-10-17T06:53Z,"@mhamer6

Theres no way to do it using software currently that i know of.

it would require the Hardware setup to do that (what i have) In order to circumvent the protection."
,lumpyspaceprincess,2012-10-23T00:36Z,"The quality is AMAZING, but be warned, it's only the FIRST HALF of the episode. The second half is missing. =("
