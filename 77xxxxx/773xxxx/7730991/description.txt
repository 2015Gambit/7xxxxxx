Native Instruments Skanner XT v1.1.0



SKANNER XT is a raucous and exciting synth from the creator of REAKTOR. Part sampler, part synth, SKANNER XT offers a broad range of sounds - from big and nasty basses to celestial pads and intriguing, morphing soundscapes.

Highly unpredictable, this instrument delivers an edge to your productions that no other synth can. SKANNER XT runs in REAKTOR PLAYER or the full REAKTOR 5 version, and is also optimized for easy browsing from the MASCHINE hardware.
