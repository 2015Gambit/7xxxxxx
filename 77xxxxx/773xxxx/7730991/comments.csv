When I try to install it, though, it aborts loading the installer with this error: 

""Skanner XT cannot be installed, because Skanner XT has not yet been installed on this computer. Please run Skanner XT before running the installer.""

....this is a troubling paradox indeed.
Any idea why I'm getting this? I have a cracked Reaktor 5, in fact I just installed the [deepstatus] Reaktor 5.7.1. Tried it with my old install of 5.6.0 as well. No dice.

Would really love to get this working, thanks again for all the other new releases."

They're not complete because you already need the initial VST."
