"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love 
                                    with You)"

Teddy's mayoral campaign is moving ahead and 
Rayna reluctantly endures an investigation 
that reveals some explosive family secrets. 
Meanwhile Coleman Carlisle is starting to lay 
down the groundwork for his campaign when he 
discovers Lamar is poised to go head to head 
with him, even if it means exposing his 
longtime friend; Juliette, who will stop at 
nothing when it comes to getting her hands on 
Deacon, sees him perform with Rayna at the 
Bluebird, and it's clear that not all feelings 
fade with time; and Scarlett is torn between 
pursuing her dream of songwriting with Gunnar 
and her commitment to Avery. 

18/Slow
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
