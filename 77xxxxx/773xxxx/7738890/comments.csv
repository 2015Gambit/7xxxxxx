,RezMar,2012-10-18T15:53Z,"For me is not working :(

I pass login screen but when enter in menu i got fatal error.

Did i need to put game in specific location?"
,conny_the_server,2012-10-18T16:32Z,"@RezMar I'm guessing you're missing some dependencies on your computer. (As in, the real game won't work either until you find what's wrong.) "
,RezMar,2012-10-18T17:02Z,"Ok i find the problem.
Kaspersky and Eset don't allow unity engine :/.
I have Eset and i disable him and then it works ok :)"
,jumdumjum,2012-10-18T18:30Z,I can't build anything ?
,MoldyCool,2012-10-20T22:04Z,Will you also patch the next version incase they upload a new
,Delidor,2012-11-03T05:54Z,"Hopefully you see this soon, but since they just released a patch earlier today they got rid of that ""skip this step"" button, so now it is inaccessible for those that patch the game. So hopefully you or someone else can find a loop hole around it =DD"
,Nexuro,2012-11-03T11:48Z,"Yeah,as Delidor said, I really wanna play the new patch but the skip login button doesn't work now, so we need a new cracked version :D"
,lemonblazer,2012-11-04T00:09Z,"Sauropod just uploaded a new patch. I'm not sure how to update without breaking the ""skip login"" crack. Does anyone know how?"
,lemonblazer,2012-11-04T00:19Z,"Sauropod Studios just updated Castle Story, like Nexuro said. I hope this torrent gets updated, too. If you take the ""Managed"" folder, or even the specific .dll file, it still won't recognize the game as being ""updated"". So I hope you figure out how to fix that soon, 'cause this is an awesome game. KTHXBIA! :D"
,lemonblazer,2012-11-04T01:01Z,"Oops, two comments. Silly me."
,Andrezado,2012-11-04T11:52Z,"yeah the 0.2 update is out, and it fixes so much things i'm peeing in my pants wanting to try it out, but still no torrent update"
,Andrezado,2012-11-04T12:00Z,"Yep, the new patch just came out, and I really hope you update the crack as well :)"
,Andrezado,2012-11-04T12:01Z,Comented two times again damn it -.-
