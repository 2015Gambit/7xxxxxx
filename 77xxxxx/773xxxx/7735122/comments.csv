,extracube,2012-10-17T08:43Z,I'd prefer about a 400 - 500mb format.  Oh well thanks anyway.
,YourWorstNightmare,2012-10-17T14:08Z,seed ffs. my ratio is over 3 and I'm not even half way
,YourWorstNightmare,2012-10-17T16:04Z,"Dunno about you guys, but I found this to be unwatchable on my laptop... the audio is clear (although kinda low) but the video is extremely laggy. My laptop usually runs 1080p blurays without issues so it's kinda weird. 

will seed anyways"
,muffinmatrix,2012-10-17T18:44Z,Please stop posting RARs! Its such a huge waste of time for all involved.
,AlexLibman,2012-10-18T14:45Z,"Don't post RAR's.

Don't seed RAR's.

If you ever get summoned to a jury trial for a murder of someone who RARs media files, vote ""not guilty"" on the grounds that the victim was too stupid to live anyway.  ;)"
