The modifications on that are the following two:
- For unknown reasons, the translation changed the title screen. That change
  has now been disabled by the renaming of patch/SO005.AGF to .aroduc
- Translation left the battle interface half translated, in a way that some
  incomplete work in map tile overlays is missing information the japanese
  version had. The affected tiles have been restored to the original ones. A
  copy of the translator's version is available in patch/SO009.AGF.aroduc

The tools that were used for the original translation are included.
They can be found inside KamiModTools/ in the archive.
