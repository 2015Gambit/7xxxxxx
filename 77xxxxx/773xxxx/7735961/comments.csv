,wild_dragon,2012-10-22T07:34Z,"No Problems here. use the following method:

1. Run CMD

2. enter the following exactly as follows

3. slmgr.vbs -ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4 (press enter)

4. slmgr -skms 147.134.1.42:1688  (press enter)

5. slmgr.vbs -ato (press enter)

 You then get popups after each enter indicating success once thats complete move on

6. open your file downloads where ever you save the pirate bay files 

7. then goto Windows 8 All Activator Collection 2013>Windows 8 Pro Build 9200 Activator

8. Now open the ""Server"" document 

9. to save time place the following server id 147.134.1.42:1688 at the top of the list then click save

10. now run Windows-8-9200-activation tool as admin or when prompted select yes.

11. You should then get a green success

12. restart computer, then the personalization screen should now be unlocked and windows 8 pro should now be fully activated. 

Note: I am unsure if this method is only good for 180 days or lifetime but it does work all around tho."
