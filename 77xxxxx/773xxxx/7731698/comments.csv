I won't spoil it for those who wish to give this movie a chance, but I will say that the ending rendered the entire movie pointless. You know, one of those flicks where the everything leading up to the ending is suspenseful and thought-provoking, but once you get there you're like ""What the fuck?!?"" Yup. It's one of those."
