,ThatTruth,2012-10-17T06:41Z,"Rather purposeless if nobody can actually get past initialization. Nonetheless, good upload and hopefully some help emerges."
,chano12,2012-10-17T16:27Z,"Hey bobiras! Thx for the upload on TomTom Mexico!

Unfortunately I too get ""Unable to connect to TomTom. Try again later""

Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100"
,bobiras2009,2012-10-17T16:54Z,"@All 

Right now the servers of TomTom are down.You can try later to download the map."
,ThatTruth,2012-10-17T22:55Z,Thanks for the feedback in clearing things up. I'll be sure to regularly check to see when their servers are live.
,Kaejak,2012-10-18T03:21Z,"I have done some research on the matter also and apparently if you have the nexus 7 and or the Galaxy s3 it is not compatible here is a link to cnet about the issue... http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57526045-94/tomtom-android-app-wont-support-galaxy-s3-nexus-7-yet/ 

hope this helps..."
,doritobrother,2012-10-18T04:37Z,Cheers for the updates. Guess I'll just hang on until they offer support for higher res phones.
,FlamerFTW,2012-10-18T12:21Z,Hi can you get New Zealand? Cheers
,maipal,2012-10-18T13:38Z,"damn, Tomtom servers still craps like before, It happened every now and then.
-Just be patient and try in next few day to see if we all can download Maps from their server, If NOT they may fixed problem to block crack apps.
-Tested on both S3 and HTC Sensation, S2 none of them can download MAPs, S3 has high resolution could be not support at this time as someone post above if this true and Google Nav and Sygic are only choice for S3 users."
,hilferding,2012-10-19T15:51Z,"Looks like tomtom is in a hurry - they could have waited until SGS3 compatibility available - another alternative could be Navigon, it works fine on my S3!"
,armageddonn,2012-10-20T03:00Z,would really appreciate

,daloandar,2012-10-23T07:21Z,Is INDIA included in this pack ?
,some1one,2012-10-26T12:28Z,"Tom Tom have closed the server for cracked version, somehow the cuold see that.."
,SumOzdude,2012-10-27T23:39Z,"Can you see he's the man, let me hear you applaud, he is more than a man he's a shining golden god!

Hail bobiras! haha :)
Thanks again mate. You need to setup a paypal account. The amount of time and money you have saved me, is worth a few bucks!"
,vctrt,2012-11-06T10:47Z,"For those who complain about the network connection error. 
These apk's don't have the data so they try to connect to the tomtom servers and download it. That's when you get the network connection error.
To work around this simply download the data for your country/region and put it under /mnt/sdcard/tomtom/com.tomtom.*
When you have this folder with the data then tomtom will not try to connect to the servers. 
There are a couple of torrents on TPB with the data. Just look them up.
Beware though, the application is not compatible with many devices, mainly the ones with high resolution screens such as the galaxy and transformer etc.. If you install the application and it crashes then probably it's not compatible with your device ..."
