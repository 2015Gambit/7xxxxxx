,Lowe9,2012-10-18T16:09Z,"Little example:

The ""Metro"" Apps in Windows 8 are installed in the WindowsApps folder 
located in the C:Program Files folder.
It is a Hidden folder, so in order to see it, 
you will have to first open Folder Options and check the Hidden items.
If you try to click on it to open it, you will not be allowed to.

With this tool can open it and see its contents.

! But remember:
Malware that gains access to this (or another) folder, 
could potentially modify the apps source code maliciously.

So it might be a good idea to change the permissions back to their defaults, 
after you have completed your work."
