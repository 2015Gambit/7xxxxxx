,jersson,2012-10-17T18:45Z,Great upload man. Thank You
,GravityDead,2012-10-17T19:56Z,gawd you mean to download this first I have to install winrar to extract it :/
,Lowe9,2012-10-17T20:12Z,ha ha ... WinRar is the first! 
[T],T.F.K,2012-10-17T21:18Z,"Download fre Win rar from net,wrote on google,then install it,because you will need to unpack this.Its rared because need the protection."
,friendly_tec,2012-10-18T00:38Z,"This works 100%, only if you still use XP like myself, then you will need to use the patch (sending it to the Winzip folder), then reboot, open again the winzip folder  and click on the patch. Then just add any name and one of the provided serial numbers. I have had to do this several times to make this torrent work correctly, dont know if it has the same problems in Windows 7 etc.  In any event many thanks to the T F K team."
,GravityDead,2012-10-18T09:14Z,"nah I already have winrar, it was just a comment
and what do you mean by ""rared because need the protection.""

actually I just wanted to see if this winzip things is really worth it or not?

bitdefender deleted the torrent even before it's completion :(

so I tried the trial version and really comments on filehippo were 100% correct, it's a bloatware
i mean 50 MB for a ""COMPRESSOR"" software :P

they cannot even compress their own exe man :|

P.S - nothing against you TFK, it's just my thought about the winzip "
,WINEROCKS,2012-10-23T23:37Z,"Ok, I got linux so no sweat on the rar part! :p"

,tergazzi,2012-10-30T01:23Z,"No good....  malware detected, then thee is no patch in the files, and none of the keys work....  lol"

,tflagger997,2012-11-10T18:15Z,"No malware or viruses detected with Avast.  
The crack does not work and the serials are useless too (W7 x64)."
