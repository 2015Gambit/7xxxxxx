This is an exact ISO of the Dell OEM disc for Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit with integrated SP1.

I looked for a while for this on TPB and was unable to find it, so I bought it. Here it is for your enjoyment.

This is the Dell OEM copy so it is automatically activated if you have a Dell with SLIC 2.1 (previously had Windows 7 on the PC). Otherwise you'll have to activate with another method or spoof SLIC 2.1 on it. Google SLIC for your model and you may be able to find a BIOS with SLIC 2.1 integrated.
