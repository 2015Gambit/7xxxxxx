,anikpk,2012-10-17T11:12Z,Thanks bro... you are sooo goood.... Is there any way we can convert the already downloaded professional version  to  ultimate??? please tell me I dont want to download 5.23 gb again.
,Kotslogan,2012-10-17T17:07Z,Am stacked on 10% pls seed
,zirozarko,2012-10-17T22:35Z,"Very nice but no activation ( Slic),but always you can use Daz Loader or manually add Slic and activate Windows. Thank you for sharing"
,zirozarko,2012-10-17T22:47Z,"@anikpk
Open your downloaded Win 7 Pro ISO file with power iso or similar and delete in  sources dir (folder), ei.cfg file and you will be  able to install all Windows 7 x64 editions ."
,zirozarko,2012-10-17T23:01Z,"@anikpk
Now I'm looking in Windows files and  I'm not sure what files you will must replace to make your Professional to Ultimate. I recommend you to download this Dell Ultimate,but if you want  I will give you direct link to download Windows 7 Ultimate x64 from Microsoft servers 3.09 GB without activation, you can always use Daz Loader"
,SM-003,2012-10-18T00:07Z,the actual size of win7 ultimate x64 is 3.09gb. then why's it's 5.23gb? anyone tried it on dell lap? then tell the differences 
,zirozarko,2012-10-18T00:38Z,This Dell OEM Windows has Language Packs included about 1.7 GB and other OEM stuff and its working but without full activation (no Slic). Use Daz Loader
,ngein,2012-10-18T07:07Z,"I'm guessing it's a difference in size because this is Dell OEM.

This Windows is already activated if you install it on a Dell PC with SLIC 2.1 BIOS. If you install it on something else, you'll need to find some other activation method.

It's an exact Dell OEM ISO. I just created the ISO with imgburn and uploaded to TPB."
,zirozarko,2012-10-18T10:00Z,"Thank you again for sharing your bought, @ngein

,sipan_x6,2012-10-22T02:18Z,"please i need seeders the speed is 50 k i need three days

ngein

can you tell us more about this dell windows 7"
,ngein,2012-10-22T07:25Z,"As I said previously, this a Dell OEM copy. It does not go to a specific laptop or desktop. It's the same on all dell Windows 7 ultimate computers. 

This will automatically activate on any Dell that already has Windows 7 because you'll have SLIC 2.1 in the bios. If you have Vista or lower, it won't activate until you mod the bios or use some other activation method. 

I can't explain the entire SLIC process so you'll need to google that."
,sipan_x6,2012-10-22T14:35Z,i thanx you a lot ngein for this copy >can we get update from micosoft >>hi have dell inspirion 5010 it well active automaticlly????
,ngein,2012-10-23T01:38Z,"Did your laptop come with Windows 7 preinstalled? If yes, then this should work fine.

When activated properly through SLIC 2.1 it gets Windows Updates just fine."
,sipan_x6,2012-10-23T13:14Z,o it come with ubountu os but i download another dell 7 and it automatically activated
,buls,2012-10-24T16:52Z,"@ ngein...

,ngein,2012-10-25T08:14Z,"I believe the ""hotfix"" folder is for Windows Updates so I would not recommend removing it."
,buls,2012-10-25T08:16Z,so sorry for my repeat comments
,Hr.Janno,2012-10-25T18:44Z,"works on my inspiron 5110.

,SM-003,2012-10-26T01:30Z,"@ngein & all who installed this

I installed this today in my inspiron 1464 which have SLIC 2.1 (googled & checked that before installation) bt still it's not activated. Windows genuine online activation process (WGA) passed though bt in system properties it shows a trial of 3days. Why this is happened & what to do now? 

and one thing...those who hv installed this cn u guys share what's the key that installed by default? this q is for u too @ngein 

Hope i'll get some help "
,ngein,2012-10-26T05:36Z,I honestly don't know why your inspiron didn't activate.
,SM-003,2012-10-26T08:10Z,"@ngein 

Can you tell me what's the pre-installed key for this OS?"
,SM-003,2012-10-26T19:37Z,can anybody confirm that does the free-DOS notebook have the SLIC/SLP or not? I bought my inspiron 1464 in free-dos so that's why I'm asking this as this os isn't activating in my system
,ngein,2012-10-27T22:48Z,The key installed with this disc is 342DG-6YJR8-X92GV-V7DCV-P4K27
,SM-003,2012-10-28T00:06Z,that's the key for me too ...I think free-dos laptop (those which did not come with a os) don't have SLIC/SLP. What do you say about this? @ngein
,pir8s007,2012-10-28T07:30Z,"@ngein

Can you upload windows 8 for dell inspiron laptops??"
,ngein,2012-10-28T07:40Z,I don't have Windows 8 yet. I'm also unsure of how OEM activation is going to work on Windows 8.
,khansahib007,2012-11-23T23:43Z,"i'm using vista on dell INSPIRON 1545, and want to install windows 7 on secondary partition.. so my questions are 1st, whether this version would work on my laptop, i mean will it be preactivated?? 2nd, will i get dual boot option at start up??

THanks.. :)"
,khansahib007,2012-11-24T19:30Z,Commenting from Windows 7.. Its workings.. Thanks for such a nice share.. :)
