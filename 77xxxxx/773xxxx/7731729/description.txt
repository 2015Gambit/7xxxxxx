I thought I'd upload this because there is a dodgy password protected one getting around that requires one of those stupid survey things to get the password. I found this on a file download site and it appears to be the exact same one.


This is basically a simple tutorial on what Lightroom can do with videos not photos so may not even be much help but I just hate those password rars haha.
