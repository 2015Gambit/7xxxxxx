ASAP is powered by the ASAP non-sequential ray-tracing engine ΓÇö known throughout the optics industry for its accuracy and efficiency. Rays can encounter surfaces in any order and any number of times, with automatic ray splitting. Optimized for speed, ASAP will trace millions of rays in minutes.

Use ASAP to model complex imaging systems, illumination systems, and light-concentrating devices. Create highly accurate source models using source images, point sources, ray grids, and fans. Model incandescent bulbs, LEDs, CCFLs, and HID arc lamps, or import from the BRO Light Source Library. Perform the analyses necessary to validate your designs without experimental prototyping.
