Gil é um jovem sonhador, apaixonado por música e poesia. Sentindo-se incompreendido pela família, abandona tudo e passa a noite compondo na praia. Lá, ele encontra Otávio, homem capaz de mudar os rumo.

What if life blindsided destiny? What if happiness was found in the unlikeliest of places? When do we allow ourselves to embrace the new without fear of letting go of the past? Gil is a twenty year old young man that questions himself and the world. He is an orphan, raised by his aunt Leila and his uncle César. His lifestyle is fulfilled by his guitar, poetry and alcohol, generating a family war that causes Gil to run away from home. With his guitar on his back, without a destiny, money or the support of friends, Gil meets Otávio and his life takes a big turn.
