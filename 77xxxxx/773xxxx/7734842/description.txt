On 23rd October 2012., Astralwerks is releasing “Free Dimensional” the album with which John O’Regan, the young man behind Diamond Rings, wants to revalidate the surprise he caused with “Special Affections” (Secret City, 2010). 
Since then, the Canadian has been experimenting with synthesisers more than ever (in spite of tracks like “Runaway Love”, which could perfectly easily be taken from his first), and that's why he called upon Damian Taylor (known from his work for Austra and Björk) to take turns at the helm for these ten new gems. Thanks to The Hype Machine, here we offer you the online stream of the full album.
