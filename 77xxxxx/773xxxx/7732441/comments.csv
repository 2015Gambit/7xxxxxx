""Cantafabule"" (originally released in 1975 as a double LP by the Romanian label Electrecord) is the third album of the Romanian band Phoenix (aka ""Transsylvania Phoenix""). AFAIK, there are at least four different releases on CD, by Genius CD (Romania), by Electrecord (Romania), by Fanny Records (Belgium) [as ""Cant of a Bule""], and this one, by Second Harvest (US). To my ears, it sounds better than the Genius CD and Electrecord CD issues (which were re-mastered in Germany).

For a detailed review of the album (in English), go to
