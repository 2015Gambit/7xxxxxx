This fantastic release has been in the works since ETHX first contacted blocSonic back in May. In it youΓÇÖll find a few high-profile peeps heΓÇÖs managed to connect with ΓÇô folks like Boots Riley who you may know from The Coup, Zumbi from Zion-I and Myron Glasper whoΓÇÖs sung background vocals for everyone from MC Lyte to Blackalicious to Lyrics Born. Among the names you may know, youΓÇÖll also find incredibly talented MCs and vocalists who you may not know. Once again, blocSonic brings you real hip-hop with a touch of R&BΓÇª this fresh sound comes to you straight out of Northern California.

I want to say thanks to ETHX for approaching blocSonic in the first place and his guests for being part of whatΓÇÖs become ΓÇ£Boom To BloomΓÇ¥. Welcome to the blocSonic fam!

We hope you enjoy this release and it gets heavy rotation in all your portable devices, CD players and computers. If you dig it, donΓÇÖt forget to spread the wordΓÇª share it with anyone and everyone you can.

Check out blocSonic for more quality releases!

Peace
