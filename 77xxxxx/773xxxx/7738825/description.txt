  Originally JJJ Unearthed, this is their second album.

  Australian music kicks arse. Always has, always will. We're just glad
  that you're all on board for the ride. We here at OZM will continue
  to shove Australian music right in your face proving that it's at
  least equal to and usually better than any international act.
