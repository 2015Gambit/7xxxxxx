This is my second take at the Prometheus fan cut with changes below:

-Reduced file size to make it easier to download

-David viral ad placed after credits

-Peter Weyland TED talk and Extended Opening trimmed for flow

-Vickers' talk with the captain corrected continuity

-Discovery of xenomorph skin continuity/flow corrected

-Vickers' speech with Weyland trimmed for flow

-Xeno Fitfield attack scene opening cut fixed


NOTE: Any deleted scenes you notice were left out were intentionally left out because they either messed with continuity too much or they were literally unfinished scenes. 


As usual, any problems or changes I am more than happy to correct so just let me know.
