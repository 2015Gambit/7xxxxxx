,dean2804,2012-10-17T03:36Z,"Thanks man. Was hoping for an official extended cut, but this will have to do. I'll comment when I've watched it on the quality, editing, etc."
,dean2804,2012-10-18T05:17Z,"The editing's not too bad, pretty seamless and everything seems to be in the right place. The sound is a bit off in places, but nothing too bad. The extra scenes really help to some stuff to make sense too. 

Good job. Thanks."
