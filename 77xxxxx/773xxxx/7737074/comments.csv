,XVkato15,2012-10-19T23:12Z,"Where is ""Collect Calls""?"
,faze2,2012-10-20T00:21Z,Kind of upsetting that none of the other TDE artist are on the album. Was hoping to see Ab-Soul on a song or two. 
,honkay,2012-10-20T06:39Z,"Anybody else notice that all the different torrents of this have one slow dumby track on them? Different tracks, too. One is track two or something and the other is the one with MC Eiht. Every torrent has one bad track, I have tried three."
,Deweynator777,2012-10-22T03:31Z,"great album, good quality. thnx"
,GFYellowThunder,2012-10-22T19:34Z,I agree I wish Ab Soul had been on a few tracks. That would have been amazing. But this was kendricks story. Told brilliantly

,mskeykey,2012-10-23T21:48Z,"Does anyone know why when I try and download the torrent it says that ""ERROR: WRITETODISK: ACCESS IS DENIED "
