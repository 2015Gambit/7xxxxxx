,raymond_u,2012-10-17T19:34Z,TPB seems to be having some issues and not allowing me to seed - so please be patient. Will seed as soon as this blasted thing works
,thorhammer2000,2012-10-17T20:28Z,You're right on the ball this week @raymond_u - thank you for keeping us up to date with happenings in the motor sport world!
,raymond_u,2012-10-17T20:36Z,Seems that the new cloud-based TPB system is slowing down seeds a bit? I'm only managing to seed at something like 40KB/s. Please be patient... I'm seeding as hard as I can! I'll leave it on.
