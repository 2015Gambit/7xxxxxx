Patricia Cornwell sold her first novel, Postmortem, while working as a computer analyst at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond, Virginia. At her first signing, held during a lunch break from the morgue, Patricia sold no copies of Postmortem and fielded exactly one question ΓÇô an elderly woman asked her where she could find the cookbooks. 

Postmortem would go on to win the Edgar, Creasey, Anthony, and Macavity awards as well as the French Prix du Roman dΓÇÖAventure prize ΓÇô the first book ever to claim them all these distinctions in a single year. To date, CornwellΓÇÖs books have sold some 100 million copies in thirty-six languages in over 120 countries. SheΓÇÖs authored twenty-three New York Times bestsellers.
