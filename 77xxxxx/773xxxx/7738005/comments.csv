cracking down on internet downloading, does anyone recommend a way to get past this, like a peer guardian type of software?"

Those guys from south park studios are the best."
,joegreg13,2012-10-18T21:30Z,think this might be my last season. Only one episode actually felt like the old south park. The others felt like default story epsiodes. There just no trying to be funny anymore. They hit the simpsons brickwall. One great one every season

Not everybody lives in America, only people in America can watch the free episodes online."

,JackSLO,2012-10-19T22:42Z,"@Jason310M the fuck are you talking about?.. Im from a small ass country in EU and i can watch them for free just fine.. Its just that sometimes the quality gets crappy, so i reather watch it from these downloads.."
,vwjetta0000,2012-10-19T23:04Z,@Jason310M if you dont live in the US then you dont need to worry about it lol (unless your own country is cracking down on internet downloading)

,xLucentx,2012-10-20T11:50Z,I always find it interesting how you cut the episode down to such a low MB size but still keep the quality really good.
