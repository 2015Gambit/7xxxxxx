Remember to buy if you love it. I probably will. Thanks for the upload, TFK!"

their games almost always have unofficial patches to fix game-breaking bugs"
,traypalazax,2012-10-20T02:26Z,"hey every body. What gives with this game and windows 7 ultimate? Every version I download when I launch the game, It shows the begining black screan than a colum on the right side of the black screan disapears, so I'll see some of my desktop, than a message comes up Dishonored stopped working checking for solutions. Am i the only person having this issue?

I did use crack and a direct play version, and nothing......

And when I press the start button it automatically freeze on me and I have to manually close out.  "
[V],gansuk,2012-10-22T11:43Z,i dont know if you are aware of this but you are uploading multiple stolen releases from the the rip group KaOs. whom ever put these packs together has made little attempt to even hide this fact and simply changed the name [KaOs] to [THERAIN] in the setup bat. this issue will be reported.
