,flinkfrank,2012-11-02T18:11Z,"good music is born free, thanks for the album."
,paprboy,2012-11-02T18:46Z,"Although I appreciate this album being free and all, I do not understand why the tags of the songs are not correct. I had to add album title, change the track names, add songs numbers, etc. 

Why can't you do that right before you actually share your music?, especially when you want people to enjoy it right away.
"
,julianpp,2012-11-02T19:08Z,"Thanks men nice music, really like it"

thanks for sharing! 

:-)"
,DoneDeed,2012-11-02T20:46Z,"paprboy -
Thank you and thanks for listening! Spread the word! "
,cosmosboy,2012-11-02T21:11Z,"thx man. sound's kinda derivative and boring, but it's ok as a background in some clothing store. the way i use it acually."
,Hatiloou,2012-11-02T23:03Z,"I like the music. Nothing against it. 
Because it's free and legal (I hope), I'll seed as long as I can/want ;)

Great work!"
,smthb,2012-11-02T23:22Z,vacker album! tack för hämta
,AusRon,2012-11-02T23:36Z,"@DoneDeed - Great work, enjoyed the album, thnx for the download. I'll be keeping an eye out if you guys ever get to Australia.

@paprboy - Please don't complain, it took the best part of 2 mins to write in the tags and change the track names.

@Cosmosboy - You're entitled to your opinion, but it's a tad harsh, don't you think?"
,TUNDR4,2012-11-03T00:33Z,YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES@!!!!!!!@!@!@!@!@!!!
,sov_sage,2012-11-03T00:59Z,"Loved the music, thanks for sharing this. Sending the link to my sons, who I know will enjoy it also."
,Aquaalice,2012-11-03T01:21Z,"Thank you guys so much! Free music is just free music...but *good* free music, that's exceptional. Seriously, thanks."
,Peng81828,2012-11-03T04:44Z,Can you put the album on soundcloud?I would just like to listen to it before i download.
,DoneDeed,2012-11-03T05:30Z,"@ Peng81828
Sorry but at the moment we are swamped, but check us out on youtube, we have most of the songs from our new album on there!"
,Squinkie,2012-11-03T05:39Z,Thank you for freely sharing both of these albums!
,Traumness,2012-11-03T07:34Z,"Great band, new to me. Thank you very much for uploading the album. By the way, I had to convert the files and tag them correctly but despite of that it's a great album; 100% worth downlading and listening. Can't wait to see you on stage, guys. ¡Gracias!"
,rmontoya,2012-11-03T10:28Z,"Wow!

I just checked out the video (Disco) on the Goliath + The Giant webapage...

Great music and no Autotune on the voice (raw) ... LOVE IT!

A cross between Sublime (vocal) / Fall Out Boy (catchiness) / The Temper Trap (musical depth).

These guys rock!!!"
,DoneDeed,2012-11-03T12:25Z,"@Traumness
Thx for downloading, we are aware of that problem but this is our first torrent so we hope you are understanding! 
Thank you to all of you who are downloading and sharing, it really means the world to us! "
,paprboy,2012-11-03T14:44Z,"@AusRon: Without complaining kindly, the following download, if there will be any, won't be better in quality concerning the tags. So I might just go ahead and say what I didn't like about this release accompanied by some nice words about the quality of their music. Noone gets hurt. Only because things are free, it doesn't mean they should not be of a high quality, because I downloaded enough free stuff already that was no experience at all. I have seen messed up tracks, tags, covers, etc... Without feedback/critique nothing will ever change."
,Hellfe,2012-11-03T15:53Z,Right on!
,alphaAV,2012-11-03T16:02Z,I love this album! Thank you for making it available freely. Now to convert my GF =)
,my_dixie_normous,2012-11-03T18:47Z,"Oh Yeah! Im loving the Tunes after downloading this one. Thank you so much guyz. I may be like many here, and have not been exposed to your band and the awesomely synchronized, sounds and melodies you call music( I like that line) if you had not posted your album here. Just so you know, Im listening to the album exclusively in my car on my way to the beach for a surf every morning here on the GC, Australia.....and it feels so good. Your fan numbers just grew by 1.....its a done deed.  Now when you guyz gonna come to Oz and tour down here? Esp the Gold Coast....I'd definately take ya surfing and show you around.  Peace Out guyz and thanx so much again."
,why2000k,2012-11-03T20:26Z,"Great download. Love the music.

Have you ever thought of adding a Sax player to accent some of the track?

Also this may sound corny and outside the box but would love to hear a Mashup of Disco with Chris Brown's Turn up the music and Katie Perrys Firework."
,Traumness,2012-11-04T01:14Z,"@DoneDeed
No problem at all with that. It didn't even took five minutes to do so ;)
Great job!!!"
,DoneDeed,2012-11-04T02:03Z,"@my_dixie_normous
We'd love to come down to Australia and do some shows but we need to become a little bigger as a band first, but as soon we do you WILL be the first to know, can we crash at your place? ;) 
@why2000k
Haha funny you mentioned it, actually we have thought about it! Our guitarist played the Sax before and don't be surprised if you hear some saxophone on the next album :D
@Traumness
Thanks but we should off catch'd that before we but it up anyways :)

Again thank you all so much for downloading and commenting! "
,Bubaman,2012-11-04T04:50Z,"Hi! I'm about to listen to your album, but I'm not a natural enlgish speaker, less a linstener. So I was wondering were can I get the lyrics of yours songs?
And put an album for free is really amazing dudes, thanks a lot!"
,Bubaman,2012-11-04T06:41Z,"I've already listen to it. Great songs! I like the smooth style, like, music to hear while you're doing something peacefully.
Keep on dudes, you are really good."
,DiegoGranada,2012-11-04T07:28Z,Awesome Job. It arouses the senses. 
,brunos3,2012-11-04T08:22Z,Thx for the free album! I was watching the videos on the youtube channel and they are really great as well. Cheers~
,RainbowKisser,2012-11-04T10:38Z,Never heard of it until TPB Front page. Love it! :D
,49erRider,2012-11-04T12:16Z,"Enjoyed it, where can we get your first album?"
,paprboy,2012-11-04T13:22Z,"First album is on iTunes, like the 2nd"
[H],politux,2012-11-04T14:57Z,"FLAC would have been better, but hey wav works too.  Cheers for sharing."

Hi and thanks for downloading! No current lyrics are available right now but next week when things have slowed down we will post all the lyrics from ""Done Deed"" and even our first self titled album!
@politux
Thank you so much for putting that up there! 

And to all you others, A MASIVE THANK YOU TO YOU ALL! For us it's unreal to read all these comments about our music, it means the world to us!
And as we said above, we will put our first album up for download here on TPB next week, we will announce when it's up asap on our FB and here in the comments! "
,barakz21,2012-11-05T05:30Z,"Just how good these tunes are???....

I had to log in just to say they're freakin awesome! Thank you Goliath and the Giants for making this free! Love your tunes, keep 'em coming!"
,paprboy,2012-11-05T15:35Z,"Please implement a donate button on your website. I do not have the money to buy a full album, but i'd like to give you an euro or two for being so nice.

Btw, here is the band's website: 

http://www.goliathandthegiants.com

(since they are not on the first page any longer)"
,DoneDeed,2012-11-05T15:56Z,"@paprboy
We wont put a donatebutton on our site because we belive that our music should be free, that you download and listen is payment enough, but thank you so much that you would do that! 
Keep an eye out on our FB cuz we are puting up our first album for download to this week, also there will be a t-shirt that will be for sale! :) 
Thanks again! "
