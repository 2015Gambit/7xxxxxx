'Done Deed' is the latest album from the indie/surf/rock band Goliath And The Giants.
The band released their fist album in 2011 and has been touring since then, allowing them to play with Millencolin and festivals. In the start of this year they entered the studio again in their hometown of Helsingborg to start working on their followup to their self titled debut album.
The album has already gotten great reviews and will be released on the 26:th of October 2012.
