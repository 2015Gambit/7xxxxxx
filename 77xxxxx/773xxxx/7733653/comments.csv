,dandalis,2012-10-16T20:29Z,will this work with Black box release ?
,whatthefuckpassword,2012-10-19T02:22Z,"So, instead of using a simple crack, I need to install both Steam and Greenluma?

I'll just wait until next month for The Full Package, and hopefully there will be a crack released for it."

,nyufi,2012-10-21T12:02Z,"Installed this and it saves fine if steam is running in the background, but the only DLCs that activated for me after you get your first hide out, were Cheapy D and the TF2 ones."
