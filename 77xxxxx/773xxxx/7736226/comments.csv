get it for your dog as his ears can hear frequencies yours can't.  If you don't have an audiophile dog then just buy the cd."
,WasAtWoodstock,2012-10-18T03:09Z,"I don't know anything about XRCD24. But for SACD you need a special player to get the better sound. If a SACD is ripped like a regular CD you don't get anything sounding better than a regular CD. Though a SACD may have fancier digital mastering, such is not exclusive to a SACD."
,flacdude,2012-10-18T04:56Z,Oh boy. Interestings ups then wordwar III all over again.
,]eep,2012-10-18T16:20Z,"I really appreciate your uploads. But if you advertise as audiophile, you better know what that means. 
There are a lot of very good classical recordings made in the past. But if you were to convert these to 128kbps mp3's would you still consider it 'audiophile'? I think not.
The same goes for ripping only the redbook layer of a hybrid SACD. 

I have several 24/96 recordings and you don't need dogs ears to hear the difference. Just the grey matter in between and a stereo that's worth it's money."
,Flac2496,2012-10-19T02:33Z,"For Jeep and sounds like maybe a few others here:  Although Cyber sometimes can have little patience for annoying and unappreciative leechers, I happen to be an audiophile too for a long time and my stereo can go to 12 not just 10 and blow the doors off your house, thank you very much.  I don't classify ""audiophile"" as purely 2496/192, 88/44 or whatever.  What Cyber has uploaded here to share with the appreciative community is a collection of mostly Japan XR CDs which are going to be very well made high end and dare I say it ""audiophile"" recordings.  These are not low grade material by any means and suggesting they are is completly insulting and not any less than a wee bit snobbish by some of the audiophiles posting here at TPB.  Grow up and be a little more appreciative of the great efforts Cyber and now some others on TPB have been doing to upload high grade recordings, whether the best ""master"" available to the uploader's ears in whatever format, a well done cd, or sometimes when available the higher grade 24/44, 48, 88, 96, or 192 recordings.  Cyber, while I might not take you home to meet my elderly mother, I would indeed buy you a giant beer at your favorite bar if given the opportunity and a second round to boot!  Thanks for your great efforts here, and all the others TOO!  Lord I miss Demonoid and it's community, but if we can all be a little more appreciative than negative and contribute a little, TPB can also be a great place to hang out.  Peace to all.  And for my fellow audiophiles, don't be snobs, but do enjoy the good music and contribute more than you take."

,]eep,2012-10-23T16:50Z,"@flac2496
look at my first sentence....
I am appreciative. But if I see a label 'audiophile' and SACD my heart jumps up. Only to be disappointed to see that it's only a half hearted redbook rip.

Cybergodsig has several great uploads but this one in IMHO mislabeled. If he made these himself my plea is to please make a proper 24-88 rip.

Suffice to say I am not downloading this."
