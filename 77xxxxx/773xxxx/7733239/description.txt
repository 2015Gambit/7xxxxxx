Reel Music is a compilation album featuring a selection of songs by The Beatles that were featured in their films. The album was released on 22 March 1982 in the United States and the following day in the United Kingdom - nearly simultaneously with the theatrical re-release of the film, A Hard Day's Night, which had been "cleaned" and re-edited with stereo Dolby sound. Reel Music cracked the U.S. Billboard Top 20, peaking at No. 19. The album was released by Capitol Records in the United States (catalogue number SV 12199) and Parlophone in the United Kingdom (PCS 7218). In New Zealand this LP was released on the Parlophone label (PCS 7218) and the inner sleeve and booklet were imported from the U.S. It was the first Beatles album released after John Lennon's death.
