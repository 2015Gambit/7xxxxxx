,GObonzo,2012-10-18T16:55Z,remastered? nice if any of the game sites even payed attention to these games. Gets ignored like Drakensang because there's no 1st person shooter multiplayer or cartoons involved.
[T],esharoth,2012-10-18T22:50Z,"Remastered: these versions of the games have been patched with the latest updates, they support higher, widescreen resolutions and they work on Windows 7/Vista. 

Don't expect better textures or improved character models, though."
