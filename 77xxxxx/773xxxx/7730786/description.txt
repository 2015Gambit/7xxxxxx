My album is the orange vinyl with the foiled sticker Trade Mark of Quality on the front and from what information I have been able to gather there were only 150 presses made. I did not use any noise reduction or equalization on the rip, so this is exactly how it sounds. This album has only been played 3 times since it was given to me back in the mid 70's, once by my cousin and She bought it brand new and the other by me when I copied to audio tape back when I first received it, any pops you hear are few. Its been sitting in my collection until now and ripped for CD. This is a side1 and side2 rip with no track separations keeping the live continuity going. I have included along with the Flac the MP3 and some scans of the cover and LP sides.
 
Enjoy fellow Led Zeppelin Lovers.
 
To the sunny hills of long ago!
