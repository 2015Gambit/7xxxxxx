Ok, but there are a lot of ""interesting"" shows.
And it's not a new show we need reviewed. SoA is in its 5th season.
Interesting post..."

,P_W_W,2012-10-17T08:07Z,"No subs at all, haedcoded or file, and does not play in all players!"
[T],GlowGaze,2012-10-17T15:12Z,You can find the Subtitles in the link that's in the description 
,nerdturd,2012-10-17T16:19Z,In the link? Why not include the subtitles in the torrent?

[T],GlowGaze,2012-10-17T19:34Z,"Oh god not again...I already explained that last week, let me go copy the comment :p"
[T],GlowGaze,2012-10-17T19:36Z,"Because when I upload the Episode ASAP, the Subtitles aren't ready at the time of the upload but will be in couple of hours or so...and when they are, I can't include them in the torrent by that time. But when they're ready by the time of the upload I usually do include them in the torrent itself

Why do I have to put ""+ Subtitles"" in the title? Because I can't edit it afterwards & the it's only the first couple of hours when the Subtitles aren't there anyway ;) 

Here's the link if you can't see it ;)

You Guys are a bunch of idiots bitching about what you are getting free from someone else who is doing the work of putting it up here for you. Glowgaze doesn't have to do this for you. Thanks Glowgaze
