Based on REAKTOR 5.5's new "Modal Bank" module, which utilizes the possibilities of physical modeling synthesis, the PRISM synth produces a dynamic and pristine sound that can be dramatically modified via internal or external sources. Its sister FX ensemble opens the door to fascinating sound shaping capabilities for use on any incoming audio as a lively effects processor. The result is a wide-ranging, contemporary synthesizer and effect.
