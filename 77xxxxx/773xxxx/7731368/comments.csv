This one has the October updates included. If you have the September one, just update it using Windows Update."
,torrent_xlr8r,2012-10-18T04:32Z,"@Heartofthorns 

Hey man, you seem to know your shit so maybe you can help me out.

I am using Maherz ""Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (x64) Integrated September 2012,"" and everything seems to be working fine except all Microsoft/Windows programs. 

E.g. 
1. My windows update keeps telling me to update the same updates, no matter how many times they are successfully installed 
2. Microsoft Office, and all other Microsoft/Windows software (e.g. Windows Live Mail, Windows Live Messenger, etc) start installing themselves every time I try and use them, instead of opening the program.

Any help would be appreciated; should I try another version of Windows?

Thanks"

,Heartofthorns,2012-10-18T11:19Z,"@ torrent_xlr8r
It's an issue with the Windows Update feature. 
Here's one of the fixes I found.
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/windows-update-repeatedly-prompting-to-install-the/1838bc26-19b9-4eb2-9f52-d96cf2e398e1
Try the 2nd answer, then the 1st one. Personally, I have the ""Check for Updates but let me choose whether to download and install them"" option ticked. I check which updates I have to install, then install them. See if that works for you.
Alternatively, if the problem persists, you could
a. Google for additional solutions (Search for windows update telling you to install same updates)
b. Post in Maherz's support forums (mentioned in the torrent description)
c. Post in piratebay forums ( https://forum.suprbay.org/  ) Many others will help you get help faster there."
,Heartofthorns,2012-10-18T11:46Z,"@ torrent_xlr8r
Oops, forgot about the 2nd part of your question.
I searched google for it. Do you have multiple copies of Office installed? The Windows Installer Cleanup Utility fixed the problems for many of them who had the same problem as you (i.e. Office and Live messenger installing every time you run it)
Here's the link : http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301
Again, you could google about the problem and follow their steps if you want ;)
Hope that helped."

Does your computer support 64-bit Windows? There's a 32-bit version for you if it doesn't. Also from what I searched on google it could be a Ram/Ram slot problem. Try putting your Ram into the other slot. I'm sorry I can't be of much help here. Post your problem on  https://forum.suprbay.org/

,ADhillon1,2012-10-20T13:25Z,Do i have to unzip the folder at all before burning onto a cd or do i burn it as is when its done downloading............?
,Heartofthorns,2012-10-20T15:02Z,"@ ADhillon1
It's a .iso file. So you directly burn it to a dvd. No need to unzip or anything.
It is 3.71 Gb. So it won't fit on a CD. You'll need a DVD."
[V],Maherz,2012-10-20T20:39Z,"@Accolon9
That was intended.

thanks for you help and uploads Maherz"
,Heartofthorns,2012-10-21T14:29Z,"@ leozdad
Are you trying to upgrade? You have a 32 bit operating system and want to install a 64 bit one, so you'll have to do a clean install instead. This torrent is 64-bit Windows 7. You really don't expect a 64 bit software to open in 32 bit operating system now do you? :P 

In short, if you want to install the 64 bit windows 7, you'll have to do a CLEAN install.  Search google/youtube, there's information and videos on how to do it if you don't know. And NO, you don't click on setup.exe to install it because that's what I'm thinking you did. You will have to burn this to a DVD and install it from there at boot."

Read the instructions in the torrent description mate. It says burn the iso file to a DVD with minimal speed (the lowest speed, so that all tracks on the dvd are written without errors).
1. If you're using ImgBurn to burn the DVD,
(i) Open ImgBurn
(ii) Click on ""Write image file to disc""
(iii) Select the source where you have downloaded the .iso file (In short select the place where you have downloaded the file)
(iv) Click on Write (the big icon at bottom)
OR
2. If you're using Nero Burning ROM
(i) Open Nero Burning ROM
(ii) Click on New
(iii) Select ""DVD"" in the drop down menu (top left corner)
(iv) Select DVD-ROM (UDF)
(v) Click New and then drag the iso file there.
(vi) It will ask to burn the compilation, select yes. Then Burn it.
Note : Remember, burn at the lowest speed."

AFTER activating you can set it to 'Download and Install updates automatically'.

You can then choose which updates you want and so on and so forth."

2. Is your bios set so that your first boot device is USB drive or Pen drive or Removable drive? If not, set it as first, then the computer will boot through the USB. First go into BIOS, then it should be somewhere under Boot > Boot Priority Options.

hi everyone, 
(1)there is a virus in the Activators so avoid using antivirus as it will delete the files and windows will crash.
(2) In Windows updates, change settings to check but don't install automatically and by installing (KB2756872 update) you have to run the activator again but not fix.
(3) Buy Windows 8 if affordable for you!!!!!!!!!!~
(4) If you are not an advance user and that also means if you don't know what restore points are then disable windows update.
(5) Every single time you guy install any software or update please create Windows Restore Points, only if you think windows is out of bad luck.

Works!~ Enjoy New OS as I am :) x32 & x64"

Dude, to install you have to boot the disk at boot i.e. when you start the comp.

Sorry I may have misread your comment as I think you already tried that.

For burning the DVD, I hope you burned it at minimum speed. Sometimes if you burn at high speeds, some sectors may not get written and you may get an error. Also to burn, here's something I posted few comments ago : 
Burn the iso file to a DVD with minimal speed (the lowest speed, so that all tracks on the dvd are written without errors).
1. If you're using ImgBurn to burn the DVD,
(i) Open ImgBurn
(ii) Click on ""Write image file to disc""
(iii) Select the source where you have downloaded the .iso file (In short select the place where you have downloaded the file)
(iv) Click on Write (the big icon at bottom)
OR
2. If you're using Nero Burning ROM
(i) Open Nero Burning ROM
(ii) Click on New
(iii) Select ""DVD"" in the drop down menu (top left corner)
(iv) Select DVD-ROM (UDF)
(v) Click New and then drag the iso file there.
(vi) It will ask to burn the compilation, select yes. Then Burn it.
Note : Remember, burn at the lowest speed. 

If the problem persists, ask on Maherz's forums (the link is in the torrent description) or in the piratebay forums (  https://forum.suprbay.org ). More qualified people might be able to help there."
