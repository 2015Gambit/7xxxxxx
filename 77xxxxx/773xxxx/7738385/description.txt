ok, in my humble opinion, this is probably THE best mystery story that may have ever been written. period. imagine you are a cop and investigating a murder and somewhere down the line, you realise that it is YOU who may have actually commited the crime...or was it just ONE murder? maybe you have killed more than once? but, WAS it you? or was it not. haha! it doesnt get any better than that!
