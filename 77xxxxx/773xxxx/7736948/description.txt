Book Description
ΓÇ£The book itself is a diagram of clarification, containing hundreds of examples of work by those who favor the communication of information over style and academic postulationΓÇöand those who donΓÇÖt. Many blurbs such as this are written without a thorough reading of the book. Not so in this case. I read it and love it. I suggest you do the same.ΓÇ£
ΓÇöRichard Saul Wurman

ΓÇ£It is a dream book, we were waiting forΓÇªon the field of information. On top of the incredible amount of presented knowledge this is also a beautifully designed piece, very easy to followΓÇªΓÇ¥
