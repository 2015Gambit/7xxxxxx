VariCAD is a computer program for 3D/2D CAD and mechanical engineering which has been developed since 1988. VariCAD runs on Windows and Linux. It features many tools for 3D modeling and 2D drafting. VariCAD provides support for parameters and geometric constraints, tools for shells, pipelines, sheet metal unbending and crash tests, assembly support, mechanical part and symbol libraries, calculations, bills of materials, and more.

The program includes a standard part library with screws, nuts, bearings etc. Additionally, it offers many calculation modules for, e.g., springs, beam torsion and of course volume, mass and center of gravity.

VariCAD allows editing of DWG files without conversion using the Open Design Alliance DWGdirect libraries. VariCAD support the ISO industrial product data exchange format STEP/STP. A list of notable supported file formats is listed in the Comparison of CAD software article.
