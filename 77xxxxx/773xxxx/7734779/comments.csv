The file handling is not working as it should, and it will occasionally try and follow itself, or someone with protected tweets that you are already following. So be careful!"

Unable to find ""body.user-style-"". Maybe twitter is throwing a captcha?"
,apsololab,2012-11-16T11:13Z,"That happens because the bot was unable to locate ""body.user-style-"" in the HTML after logging in. Can happen if you login to many times, and twitter throws a captcha image verification thing. It can also happen if twitter changed something, and i have not used the bot for some time, so i don't know if thats the case."
