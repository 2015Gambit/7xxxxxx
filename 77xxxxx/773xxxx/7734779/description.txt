 Secret MD5 hash: f864a0a29795e8e6b0ef2afe1675bda9
 
   Whoever knows the original string used to generate the above MD5 hash,
   is likely the maker of this software.
   The string consists of a single line written in plain English.

  Changes in V2:
   1. Re-wrote the GUI to easily allow for more features to be added.
   2. The "follow" feature was added to the bot.
   3. Added a login Button.
   4. Improved the login. The bot should now only login if required.
   5. Moved certain code to their own include files, this should make it easier to
      develop the bot further! "This is simplifying the code..."

 Script Function:
	The Best Twitter Bot
	 Unfollow Your Non-Followers
	 Follow Following/Followers of User

The source code for the bot is included for those interested. If your security/antivirus flags the .exe, then it is a false posetive. Compiled AutoIt scripts often get flagged without reason, even the source files can sometimes get flagged.
