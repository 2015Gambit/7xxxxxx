Your most welcome:)"
,SectorVector,2012-10-17T15:11Z,"Nice upload bbs. Just finished running through a couple of books. They are well written and have practical advice too. Take for instance pg 61 in 'The Handbook of Autism'. So true.

(All): Do share with people who have autistic children. Am sure they will appreciate it."

F%#@%K OTHER BOOK REQUESTS FOR A WHILE, PLZZZ...."
,SectorVector,2012-10-17T19:51Z,"rmome, DK books are certainly well illustrated. Curious to know if any particular book(s) sparked your interest in the series.
Plus i think you would agree with me, it is impolite to instruct people what they should do. Phrase your request in simple terms and am sure you stand a decent chance of being served. But again, it is possible he doesn't have these books you request for. :)
Here's wishing you will be born in the western world in your next birth and the other condition you mention !"
,rmome,2012-10-18T11:17Z,"@ SectorVector : - Yes, I also hope that I be born in any of the western countries in my next birth OR in this birth I hope that the entire World becomes like the Western World.

I like DK books very much, and all the 11 books that I suggested above are highly anticipated by me. 

I am not telling anyone what they should do.

I wrote my request in a rude language, just to increase BBS - bigbluesea's curiosity in my request, so that he will upload my books before any other.

U can see how much competition we have here on TPB..."
,Enolena,2012-10-23T02:29Z,"I, personally, won't be downloading this book pack because I don't have anyone in my life that needs these books.  However, I applaud you for gathering these books together to serve the community of parents, teachers and individuals who are touched by Autism.  

Thank you so very much for your Social Conscience and thank you for all of the books that you supply."
,chid,2012-10-24T16:17Z,"Thanks for uploading BBS, I was wondering whether you could please upload The Journal of Best Practices A Memoir of Marriage, Asperger Syndrome, and One Manâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Quest to Be a Better Husband by David Finch"
,chid,2012-10-24T16:18Z,"Also I agree with what Enolena, you're doing a great job sharing knowledge!"
,Chitrapathi,2012-11-03T12:46Z,"thanks, I just uploaded 2 other books on autism"
