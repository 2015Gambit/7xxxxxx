Since first deciding to release original albums here, I intended blocSonic to release an eclectic range of music and with each new original, I think weΓÇÖre reinforcing that intention. Since the beginning IΓÇÖve been amazed at the caliber of artists that have either approached us or agreed to release through us. Liam Stewart is yet another in an amazing roster of artists that are showing listeners that the world of netaudio is not something to ignore. With his incredible ΓÇ£Sixteen WordsΓÇ¥, youΓÇÖre presented another album that will make some wonder how on Earth is it that it wasnΓÇÖt released by a traditional label. ThatΓÇÖs the state of the music industryΓÇª labels are only releasing "marketable" products that they can shove into a pre-packaged formulaic box. If artists want to create ART and speak THEIR voice, then thereΓÇÖs no room for them. So artists are forced (I feel, for the better of music and artistry in general) to forge their own paths. LiamΓÇÖs path has led him to blocSonic and I am grateful for the opportunity.

LiamΓÇÖs sound is one that is pop of a British flavorΓÇª you may call it Britpop or leftfield pop or some other quick and neat genre label, but the reality of it is more complex than that. ΓÇ£Sixteen WordsΓÇ¥ contains many characteristicsΓÇª pop, rock, electronic & synth-pop. At times it may remind you of Pink Floyd or Roger Waters, Tears For Fears or some current indie-artist that you may dig. Whatever it sounds like to you, what IΓÇÖm quite sure youΓÇÖll find is that this is memorable music thatΓÇÖs going to stick with you for years to come. It isnΓÇÖt plastic music made for the masses, itΓÇÖs contemplative music crafted for music lovers who crave albums that arenΓÇÖt trying to fit in.

I hope that with the help of this engaging album, youΓÇÖll regard Liam Stewart as an artist youΓÇÖll be eager to hear more from.

Thanks for downloading and for listening. Spread the wordΓÇª share itΓÇª blog itΓÇª podcast itΓÇª oh and if youΓÇÖre in radioΓÇª support Creative Commons artistryΓÇª broadcast it!
