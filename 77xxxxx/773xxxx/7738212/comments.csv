,elleadnih,2012-10-20T03:44Z,"yeah, how do you play? on LION?"
,nocturnal73,2012-10-20T10:17Z,"Nop, doesn't work on Lion."
,JON39179,2012-10-20T17:17Z,man....We have this cxz issue on mac pro osx lion....plz if there any way to solve that problem man I would appreciate it a lot :D
,hurukh,2012-10-21T03:19Z,"1) You need the ""CXZ12Ebony.bundle"" to make the game work.

2) The game is only in Russian, German, French, Spanish & Italian.

3) You can't change the controls, so unless you have a controller you'll have to settle with what the game gives you."
,hurukh,2012-10-21T03:19Z,Sorry forgot to say that I made it work under Snow Leopard and not Lion.
,JON39179,2012-10-22T12:13Z,ok man plz can you make it work for lion too :P
,Rico1989,2012-10-24T05:48Z,"it does work on Snow Leopard! took a while to do it but it works great. 

i created an account just to see if i could help ppl with this torrent, be aware though, as hurukh said its only in Russian, German, French, Spanish & Italian, so if you dont speak either of these, best to get a PC version and use VMware Fusion or another Crossover program and then play through there (the other torrents i found are in english but are PC only).

*IMPORTANT* if you try to play the game and your on LION, and you try to download the CXZ12Ebony file/bundle, it will not work!! FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS AND IT SHOULD WORK!"
