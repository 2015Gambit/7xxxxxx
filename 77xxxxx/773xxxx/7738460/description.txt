UltraSnap PRO

UltraSnap PRO is a windows clipboard graphic processor and a slick screen capture program with a complete WYSIWYG editor.

You no longer have to open your image editing software to add captions or annotations, cursors, arrows or combine multiple images or screen shots into one image. In fact UltraSnap PRO often produces better and easier results than your image editing program.

UltraSnap PRO, our graphic clipboard processor and a screen capture, has full non-destructive WYSIWYG editor, with multiple anti-aliasing for perfect output, with many effects like shadows, bevels, objects and more.

Just spin it for a test drive and you will love it. We build it for ourselves and It took almost 10 years to perfect the workflow.
