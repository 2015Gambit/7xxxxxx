,ben7530,2012-10-17T17:10Z,"Thanks Lyrical1986 (Please tell me you are actually Kool Mo Dee!)

*anyone know if this has a Win8 compatible crack*?

Come on release groups: Win8 is officially out now. Time to stop ignoring it."
,spikeabercrombie,2012-10-17T18:34Z,anyone else getting random skipping/lag in Oasis areas when shooting a weapon? smooth if not firing but lags when shooting at the ground or enemies?
,Violentos,2012-10-17T18:47Z,Not many comments on this file... does it work?
,spikeabercrombie,2012-10-17T18:55Z,"nvm, setting physx to low fixes prob until they release a patch, physx High setting is buggy in Oasis DLC areas."
,xxela,2012-10-17T21:33Z,Works only with SKIDROW release ??

,OmniNegro,2012-10-17T23:50Z,"@ChaosZeus
Use any Fast Travel station in the game and go to Oasis."
,PWNTFACE,2012-10-18T00:52Z,I have a legit copy of the game.. can I get banned using this? likelihood?

Thanks :D"
,scoots_,2012-10-18T04:56Z,"After installing this and cracking, the game fails to launch.  It did this same thing with the update #4.

The original skidrow release works fine with the fixed crack, but these updates/DLC packs fail to launch for me (yes i used the cracks that came with them).

Anyone else have this issue?"
,scoots_,2012-10-18T05:09Z,I'm on win7 x64 btw.
,nignug,2012-10-18T05:20Z,Works great. The new vehicle is a badass addition.
,dannyboi18,2012-10-18T06:02Z,"got same issue as scoots. actually the crack didnt work for my ununpdated borderlands, i had to use a windows 7 fix crack. then when i dont use it on the update it wont open, if i do it says filename 0x0 not found!"
,HikariXSora,2012-10-18T06:10Z,Having the same issue as scoots.
,PWNTFACE,2012-10-18T08:43Z,hey guys anyone know if i'll get pwnt using this? i have a legit copy...
,Food2doog,2012-10-18T12:39Z,"aa yeah i download the DLC but the setup doesnt even start WTF?
and @PWNTFACE you do get ban if you download it"
,Food2doog,2012-10-18T13:33Z,The Setup allways crash
,PWNTFACE,2012-10-19T01:34Z,well poop.. that sucks
,scoots_,2012-10-19T06:04Z,"Ok, I was able to get it to work after uninstalling and reinstalling all the vc++ and dx10 redistributables.

Don't know why, they worked for many other games, including the vanilla borderlands 2.

So if your game isn't launching or maybe getting the error 0x0 file not found thing, try reinstalling all the redistributables."
,Hemix,2012-10-19T11:07Z,@scoots_ I just did that and it still fails to work. 
,psycotoniik,2012-10-19T18:10Z,"fatal error!
adresse=0x0 not found
please help?"
,VitorCz,2012-10-20T02:04Z,"thank you, my borderlands 2 doesnt works anymore you son of a bitch"
,GamingIndustryBlows,2012-10-20T03:59Z,"Works fine.

If you install update 5 first, make sure you copy the crack from this torrent over that one."
,braziliansingle,2012-10-20T13:45Z,Use the original borderlands exe  or the update will hang... just sayin..
,xKezzax,2012-10-21T02:23Z,"I have the legit Steam version of Borderlands 2,
if I download and install this will my game still be the Steam version, not a cracked version?
Cheers"
,Romin101,2012-10-21T12:44Z,The game doesn't  lunch anymore
,Ciechan,2012-10-21T13:52Z,GUYS IF YOUR GAME DOESN'T LAUNCH - INSTALL STEAM. IT WILL FIX THIS PROBLEM!!!
,3P1CSL4Y3R,2012-10-21T21:52Z,"Confirmed working fine on WIN7 Pro (x64), installed this on top of the other DLC on top of the original SKIDROW release, ALL are working fine."
,souwaylier,2012-10-22T15:45Z,Same as xKezzax - will this work with original Steam version of Borderlands 2?
,gratefullydrunk,2012-10-22T19:34Z,"Will this work with the original repack i've been using flawlessly since release? 

Here's a link so you know which version i'm talking about.

,TheRealRollie,2012-10-22T23:48Z,For those of you in which BL2 doesn't launch anymore after the update: you have to reinstall BL2 and install only this update.
,specterk,2012-10-23T06:28Z,"This will work just fine with Steam/legit versions of BL2, if you skip copying the .exe files in the SKIDROW folder (step 5 of installation process). Copy the other files in the crack folder as you normally would. Note that this WILL break your ability to play non-LAN multiplayer, access the downloadable content menu, etc. It will function just as any other cracked version of a Steam game."
,420yoloswag,2012-10-23T19:04Z,"How do i ""enable"" it i can't go into downloadable content i'm using 3dm and direct play"
,mmbacon,2012-10-23T21:38Z,"I am also having 
fatal error!
adresse=0x0 not found on startup.
I have Windows 8 and am wondering if that contributes to the issue. Tried reinstalling and only installing this on top. Same error. Tried a couple different cracks and fixes but still get the same result. Maybe my fault for upgrading to 8 so soon."
,turbokiczki,2012-10-24T10:59Z,"I have to error 0x0 in win7 but I finally fix it.
1. uniinstal game
2. instal steam ( only instal do not login )
3. instal borderlands 2
4. instal Borderlands 2 Update 4 incl DLC SKIDROW
5. instal Borderlands 2 Captain Scarlett and her Pirates Booty DLC SKIDROW and then copy crack 

"
,mmbacon,2012-10-25T01:24Z,Is there any way to not have to install steam to get this to work. I don't really want to hog system resources if I don't have to.
,turbokiczki,2012-10-25T08:14Z,"I dont know, but steam help me to play this game. After finished the game ( Captain Scarlett and her Pirates Booty) I uniinstal steam. "
,psycotoniik,2012-10-26T13:25Z,"i haved uninstall everything, reinstall, i have steam.. and still fatal erro adress= 0x0 not found :(

,digiman42,2012-10-27T19:07Z,"im barely downloading this but the problems that everybody has ive had em when updating b4 and a tutorial fixed em i dont remember the page but do this. copy and paste this into your notepad and save it as .reg          Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

,fluster84,2012-10-28T07:06Z,"This DLC worked for me without any problems..

- Backup your save game first of all (My documents/My Games/Borderlands 2)

- Install the DLC and the crack like it says in the .nfo file

TURN OFF YOUR ANTIVIRUS SLAB!

- Now install steam and play. Easy."
,RuruZenYu,2012-10-28T13:02Z,"Can anyone tell me what version number this is? 1.1.4? And awesome btw, installed great, worked great, no problems. People installing a steam game for the first time need to stop flaming and just read comments before they actually post their B.S. most of you durrs need to just install steam and block it in firewall just in case, and thats it, dont log in, dont use it. just install it.. and always keep up to date with dotnet and the vcredists. anyways..... thanks for the update :D"
,catalyst10,2012-10-30T11:46Z,Hmm.. Not Working.. when i click the PLAY button in the laucher then BOOM! Nothing.. plss.. fix.. i tried using 3dm crack but its always crashing.. help plss.. 
,Incogngr0,2012-10-31T19:44Z,Still working on stock build of Borderlands 2. I'm not gonna update until I finish the game.
,wrecktem,2012-11-02T14:53Z,"Do I have to reinstall Skidrow's Borderlands 2 in order for this update to install/work? I already have Update 4 and played a Mechromancer, so if I do have to reinstall, how do I backup my save files?"
,Skillah,2012-11-03T23:57Z,"Major problem - CO-OP via Hamachi DOESENT WORK with this DLC!
We have tried everything. Skidrow game alone and with update 6 - coop works. But when we install Scarlett dlc, coop doesent work anymore! Client side gets error ""wrong version"" or something like that.
We have tried Scarlett after clean install an after update 6. Doesent work.

Any suggestions? Help!"
,SmokeTheChron,2012-11-04T16:03Z,"I'm really hoping that there is a fix for the multiplayer support via hamachi or openVPN :D This would be ideal - I'm not up on the whole netcode/cracking thing but I'm taking a look at the Scarlett Pirates DLC install now, I'll let yall know if I make any headway with it."
,ZeBastian1,2012-11-15T20:17Z,Works fine - when you got problems install Steam but dont log in 
,Skillah,2012-11-18T19:10Z,"ZeBastian1, does installing Steam fixes co-op via hamachi also? Have you tried? Thanks"
,Resion1234,2012-11-19T00:51Z,"Any updates on the hamachi/tunngle lan problem? The ""different patch versions"" one? It seems only the dlc fucks it up. The update 6 patch alone works fine."
,11770,2012-11-21T07:08Z,i've never had any issues with skidrow's stuff until now >.> i even re installed everything and still no luck...
,11770,2012-11-21T07:45Z,ok i just installed the update-4 then the pirate; with no luck >.>
