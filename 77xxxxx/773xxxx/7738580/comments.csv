They deserve the money and also if you buy from the official store (not amazon or other retailers) you can get the personally signed version, by both of them, which already worth a lot of money, but more than that, it has a huge sentimental feeling to it, probably just like any other artists you have signatures of). Also, with your own CD you can export to flac and have a much better quality than MP3.

I love torrents but I will hold back from this one.

my 2c, cheers!"
