WhenI install Europe I must download all map and I don't have not storage for that. With Nordic I have enough storage.

Thanks for your excellent job."

,diamond-optic,2012-10-16T06:08Z,"First off, thanks a ton for all these packs (new to android and youve made things soo easy!).


...But I'm running into a minor issue. Trying to install the Start Menu v1.1.6, and Ive already have v1.1.2 from one of your other packs. So I figured i could just install it over the top but it gives me an error: 'An existing package by the same name with a conflicting signature is already installed'. Does this mean i have to uninstall the old version first? 

Just wanted to ask before i went and tried that because I assume im going to lose the settings that Ive done to v1.1.2 and if theres a way to avoid that, Id rather avoid it lol.

(also phone isnt rooted and it appears most backup apps need root to save app data)"

Yep the new version use other parsing packages and this is the reason for the error.Unistall the old version clear data make restart and then install the new version.For backup your settings you need root and one program like titanium backup"

,gorgotron,2012-10-18T08:27Z,"@barbiras2009 Man you're the fucking king at Android apps and games. How are you able to crack these so fast? I would really like to be able to do this. I wouldn't upload to compete or anything, just for fun."
,gorgotron,2012-10-19T05:27Z,"Also, not huge deal but the title is a little misleading. Most of these apps are free on playstore. "
,bobiras2009,2012-10-19T14:30Z,"@gorgotron

Read my description:

Some are free but this is also good for users that havent access in playstore.

Also less of them are free.The 85% of these apps are full paid versions."
,bobiras2009,2012-10-19T14:35Z,"@gorgotron

Also i started to add 5-10 free apps in my two latest packs.The half people of all the world havent access to playstore.All my other packs all always 100% full of paid full apps.In these 2 packs and in my next packs the apps will be only the 10-15 free of the whole pack.The 85% will be full paid.
But i change the title too:
