Sound disappears.
Tried VLC, Mplayer X, QuickTime...
NOT WORTH!
I usually love YIFY's uploads, but this is the third or fourth time that one of his 720p movies has exactly the same problem.
Old dogs was the same thing.
The other titles i don't remember...
It's pretty frustrating, since download is not that fast..."
