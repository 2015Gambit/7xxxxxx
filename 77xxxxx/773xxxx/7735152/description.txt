  The lavish sound Jon Barthmus crafted on Sun Airway's 2010 debut, Nocturne of Exploded Crystal Chandelier, became more popular and widespread thanks to the releases of albums by kindred spirits such as M83, Neon Indian, and Beat Connection, and in turn, Barthmus goes even bigger and more polished on Soft Fall. Where Nocturne was crafted largely in Barthmus' bedroom, this time he had a string quartet record arrangements based on chopped-up samples of classical music in one studio, a live band record in another studio, and enlisted the help of David Wrench to give it all a harmonious mix. The results are more streamlined than Sun Airway's debut, but just as vivid; Barthmus was inspired by fittingly elaborate imagery like Versailles' gilded glass halls and the work of the Japanese art collective NAM - whose Soft Fall artwork captures the album's elegant chaos - and the elliptical word paintings of Andre Breton's poetry. While this is a remarkably process-oriented album, Soft Fall is also some of Barthmus' most engaging work, especially on the tracks where tight song structures give form and contrast to his grandiose tendencies.
