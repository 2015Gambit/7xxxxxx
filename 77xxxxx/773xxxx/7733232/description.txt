In Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes, players return to the world of

old friends and discover many new hand-made cartoon locations, realized in
full HD glory!

Lilli, a young girl at a convent school, is the main character of Edna &
Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes. Seemingly the best-behaved little girl in the
world, she executes all her chores in a diligent manner, no matter how
unfair they may be. Her innocent, imperturbable way of carrying out the
orders of others has something both tragic and eerie about it. Any angry
thoughts, any childlike disobedience is buried deep beneath a seemingly
impenetrable surface of sweetness. But how long will these feelings stay
hidden? And where do the friendly little gnomes come from that paint over
everything unpleasant in Lilli's vicinity with a pleasant pink color? Are
they real or just a product of her subconscious
