He buys a parted out junk heap without an engine and with major frame rust damage for $5000, because it was the only one with a build sheet list to have an ELECTRIC CLOCK. Then they don't even paint the original color AND its got horrible orange peel. To top it off, they give it fake ""BOSS 302"" badges.

They insult the first guy repeatedly, costing them an extra $150 for its engine, when they could have bought his complete decent car for $3500 to start with.
Then they spent $1700 just to throw gaskets, rings and spray paint at the engine to ""rebuild"" it. No machine work, no valve job, no block/head decking. They didn't even check the distributor gear for damage (it was damaged).

Seriously, $19000 investment in a rusted out, BOSS clone that doesn't match the build sheet, has an improperly rebuilt engine and has uneven panel gaps?

These guys have absolutely no business or mechanical sense.

What fucking retard would willingly offer $29000 for this pile of junk? Seriously."
