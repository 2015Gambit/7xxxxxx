,Whobuysgames,2012-10-18T06:38Z,Confirmed. it is the game. but requires legitimate account at this point. need one of our scenes to grab this and make love to it
,hungryman521,2012-10-18T13:13Z,is somebody gonna figure this out or should I just quit seeding this useless hunk of data?
,JuggernautOfWar,2012-10-18T13:40Z,Looks like some Anons on 4chan.org/vg/ figured out how to get around it. I got it working.
,hungryman521,2012-10-18T14:52Z,right so someone got it working and posted a half link that lead me to one of tyhe most confusing forum/i dunno what thingy things and I can't find anything of interest about castle story. Anybody have something useful?
,hungryman521,2012-10-18T15:03Z,right after scanning through the bullshit of the forum. (not using the link the other guy gave because that leads to a forum that has 0 to do with castle story ((TARD)) So the fix is here DL this and paste to your castle story directory under data management. Have fun in an incredibly buggy alpha.
,hungryman521,2012-10-18T15:04Z,oops forgot the LINK http://filesmelt.com/dl/patch.zip LINK. Have fun.
