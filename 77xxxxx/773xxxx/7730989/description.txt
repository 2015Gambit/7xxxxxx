Native Instruments The Mouth v1.2.0


After the success of THE FINGER, British artist and musical prankster Tim Exile is back with THE MOUTH! Designed to generate melodies and harmonies out of whatever audio material you feed it, THE MOUTH is a unique and exciting way to get creative results on the fly.

Sing, beatbox or send a drum loop into it and THE MOUTH comes to life as a tweakable synthesizer, bass, vocoder or talkbox-like effect. A playful interface provides you with plenty of room to shape your results as you go.
