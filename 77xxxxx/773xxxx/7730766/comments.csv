You will be a true hero if you can get the latest DXTory!

Please for the love of everything!
Lots of people are looking for it, and the latest working version is over 5 months old and very outdated.. :(

Please, please, for your fans!

I've posted this comment on many other uploaders' uploads in the hopes of someone doing something, since I don't know where else to ask for anything like this :)"
,RoguePrim,2012-10-16T03:28Z,Fuck this show you people disgrace the zombie genre.  As the World Turns soap opera follows a more believable story line and the cop's wife I hope her and that stupid fucking kid get ate.  If any of u followers wanna see a real zombie flick watch George Romero's flicks.  It's just like vampires ruined by the masses ruined by twitards I sparkle in the light so fucking lame.  Now you fuckers are going to ruin Zombies one day they will come and eat you all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

,Mikhel,2012-10-16T09:24Z,"@RoguePrim: You need to check the 'comic' in which is based, this first episode of the 3rd season was more in tune with the comic, in which there are no soap operas and everybody can die (the cop's wife and her baby girl get killed, his son turns into a psycopath, the cop's hand gets chooped, the new character Michonne gets raped by 'the governor')."
