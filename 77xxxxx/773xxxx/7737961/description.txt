Mon Amour

Severide is hiding a serious shoulder injury
sustained in the fire that killed Andy
Darden, and grapples with his guilt as he
fights to rescue a construction worker
trapped in a building collapse. Adding to
the burden, Darden's wife Heather turns on
Severide at the annual firefighters'
barbecue, blaming him for her husband's
death. A call is made to an accident site at
Hancock Tower, where two teenagers are
pinned in a vehicle trapped beneath the
falling debris of a broken window washer's
cart. Meanwhile, Casey and Hallie work to
figure out their future together
