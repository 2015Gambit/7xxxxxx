i liked the movie but I'd say its not for everyone. 

the only movie I've seen that all the lead roles get a nude scene at some point or other :)...thats not a porno

V - Good


M - Great movie. Although if you are a 12 year old faggot you will probably not get it. "
,BBQSource,2012-10-26T02:13Z,I'm a gay 12 year old an I totally got this film.

No likable characters = not so good movie.  While the acting was great (one of McConaughey's best roles), the story just didn't do it for me...my humble opinion.

*Spoiler*
A woman performs fellatio on a KFC chicken leg...
*Spoiler*"
,CarlZeiss,2012-10-26T08:02Z,@Phatfish I'm guessing you have the intellect of a 12 year old.

M: Wasn't bad, however it's a movie based on a play. Anyone who's ever seen movies from plays should know they can be unsatisfying and heavy on dialogue that goes round and round. Personally I enjoyed the characters but wished I would have known it came from a play source material. My expectations for the ending would have been lower."
,BBQSource,2012-10-27T04:15Z,"What is this really?
Hardcore porn for Colonel Sanders?
But seriously, The Colonel taught Mconaughey that move, Back when he was an intern in Texas. "
