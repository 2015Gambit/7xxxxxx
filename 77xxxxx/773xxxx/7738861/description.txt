Game information

A  fierce   struggle   is   taking   place  within  Asgard,  the  realm  of
the Norse Gods. The battle has escalated, spilling over to the mortal world
of Midgard  and now a Champion must be found,  a Warrior than can sway this
war that threatens the fate of Asgard and the Gods themselves.

The  goddess Hel daughter of Loki,  Norse God  of  mischief,  has  been
banished from the heavenly kingdom of Asgard for defying Odin's rule. Angry
at her fate, she seeks to release the  ancient wolfgod Fenrir which legend
tells will bring about Ragnarok  the apocalyptic battle that will  destroy
Asgard and the  Gods.  With her army of  resurrected Viking  warriors,  Hel
marches on the unsuspecting mortal realm of Midgard.

Odin's daughter Freya, goddess of love and wisdom, is appointed the task of
stopping Hel  and  defending the  future of  mankind. For her champion  she
chooses Skarin, a great but troubled young  warrior, ignorant  of the  true
reason for his  favour with the Gods and  thrust into the  midst of  their
bitter war.

As Skarin, players will experience unparalleled battle  scenes, leading the
charge in a titanic  clash  between  powerful gods and mere men.  War on an
unprecedented  scale  will   rage  across  a  beautifully  realised  Viking
landscape.
