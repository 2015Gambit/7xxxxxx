C-Doc - Divided We Stand (October 16, 2012)


ΓÇªand finally itΓÇÖs here! The new album by Public Enemy producer/EMCEE/filmmaker, David ΓÇÿC-DocΓÇÖ Snyder, is finally available for you to download and enjoy. ThereΓÇÖs absolutely no doubt in my mind that youΓÇÖll enjoy it. ThatΓÇÖs no malarky, let me tell youΓÇª

Considering the incredible work that C-Doc has been turning out for Public Enemy, The Impossebulls and his & TiradeΓÇÖs LOWdown, I was quite eager to hear what he had cooked up for his solo release! When I first heard it about a week ago, I was floored. Even better than I expected, and my expectations were fairly high! ΓÇ£Divided We StandΓÇ¥ is twelve tracks of no holds barred, high-quality music for hip-hop connoisseurs.

Although this is a ΓÇ£C-DocΓÇ¥ albumΓÇª itΓÇÖs no mistake that the album cover states ΓÇ£Featuring The ImpossebullsΓÇ¥ prominently. For those of you in the know, you will notice a couple of the Bulls members featured prominently on the album and singles. For those of you not in the know, no worriesΓÇª along with C-DocΓÇª DJ Def Chad, Marcus J Gilligan & Tirade are all members of The ImpossebullsΓÇª a virtual rapp squad that was originally put together by none other than the great Chuck D viaEnemyBoard back in the late 90s. The Impossebulls went on to release their debut album ΓÇ£Slave EducationΓÇ¥ via ChuckΓÇÖs label SlamJamz in 2004. What the future holds for The Impossebulls, only the squad can say, but for now, this album should tide you over. Never have these Bulls sounded SO good!

Personal favorites are ΓÇ£BraggadocioΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£Drumm Machine (Featuring DJ Def Chad)ΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£Far Gone (Featuring DJ Def Chad)ΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£(Story) Telling (Featuring Marcus J Gilligan)ΓÇ¥ & ΓÇ£Broken Homes (Featuring DJ Def Chad)ΓÇ¥. Though there are so many strong tracks that Doc and I cooked up a scheme in which we release extra singles, in addition to the standard two (so, over the next couple weeks, keep an eye out at blocSonic.com for a surprise or two). Anyway, chances are youΓÇÖll have your own favorites, so donΓÇÖt let my love of those steer you from listening to everything.

Thanks again for listening! RememberΓÇª everything we release is cool to share! Always keep the music movingΓÇª share itΓÇª blog itΓÇª podcast it! If youΓÇÖre in radioΓÇª support independent music and broadcast it! With these clean versions, thereΓÇÖs no reason not too! Word.
