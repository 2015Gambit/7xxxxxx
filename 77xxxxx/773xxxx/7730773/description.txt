Jeffrey Linton Osborne (born March 9, 1948) is an American Soul, funk and R&B musician, songwriter, lyricist, and former lead singer of the band, L.T.D.

Jeffrey is one of the top CROONERS in the category compared to the likes of Luther Vandross, Johnny Gill, Peabo Bryson, Will Downing and Teddy Pendergrass. He has had many hits in his career such as DON'T STOP, ON THE WINGS OF LOVE, I REALLY DON'T NEED NO LIGHT, WE"RE GOING ALL THE WAY AND EENIE MEENIE to name a few.

I certainly am and will forever be a BIG FAN of Mr. Osborne's vocals as he epitomizes REAL SINGING ... something we don';t have much of today.

Remember to keep MUSIC ALIVE by seeding forever...or at least a long time
