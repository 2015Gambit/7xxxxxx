TutsPlus - JavaScript Testing With Jasmine

Admit it: you say that you test your JavaScript, but, in reality, youΓÇªdonΓÇÖt. ThatΓÇÖs okay; the idea of testing JavaScript is a relatively new thing. And unfortunately, there arenΓÇÖt too many ΓÇ£hold your handΓÇ¥ resources for getting up and running. Well, that all changes with this course. We start from scratch, and slowly work our way up the testing chain.
Along the way, weΓÇÖll take advantage of the fantastic Jasmine BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) framework to make our tests as readable as possible. Upon completion of the course, youΓÇÖll not only have a robust test suite at your fingertips, but your tests will also make for fantastic documentation!
