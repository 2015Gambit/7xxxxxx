YoWindow works like your window, very simple. A landscape reflects the actual weather and the sunlight at your place.You can see the weather without ever looking at numbers. All the weather is there - real cloud coverage, rain/snow, mist, the grass moves along with the wind.

At the moment YoWindow is the only software capable of this.

There's more, YoWindow is a full featured weather monitor.
* Total weather control.
* Watch weather forecast exactly at the time you need.
* Current temperature beside the system clock.
* Personal weather station support

YoWindow also comes with a screensaver. When your system is idle, YoWindow enables you to see the weather outside.

This is truly a new way of weather watching.
