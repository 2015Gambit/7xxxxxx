,chillis22,2012-10-18T19:49Z,"is it a good movie, wat would u rate it out of 10"
,Revolutionary_Enigma,2012-10-18T21:34Z,"this is probably the best movie ive ever seen. from the usual releases ive  seen over the past couple decades, i dont think it can even be compared to t he movies i would normally rate 10. this is most definitely without a doubt a 12/10 if thats even possible. also, audio and video were on par with a dvdrip.


well off to watch this masterpiece a third time..!"

,Sharak,2012-10-20T04:27Z,"haha Alicia Silverstone, Justin Kirk, Sigourney Weaver, this film has a good cast so I am going to watch it and I will probably like it. Don't rate it a bad movie just because you'd rather watch Sylvester Stallone at age 90 knifing people. "

,Moviecritics,2012-11-07T05:22Z,Revolutionary enigma the best movie you have ever seen? I guess legally blond must be the second best movie you have ever seen! I'm going to watch this just to masturbate to krysten ritter.
