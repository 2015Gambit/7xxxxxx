,not_my_real_name,2012-10-18T09:31Z,"This is a lousy series and a total waste of time (in my humble opinion of course). If you are 15 you might disagree, but I challenge an adult to call this good television."
,Superbookey,2012-10-18T10:11Z,"I agree with you not_my_real_name (>_>)

But still would like to give this episode another 3-4 tries before I give up on it.

Still awaiting a good superhero tv-show"
,Bynx,2012-10-18T11:51Z,So who is breaking your arm to watch it or download it? You dont like it just piss off and be somewhere else.
,sinzulai,2012-10-18T12:17Z,"not_my_real_name,you sound alot to me like a retard. why are you downloading or on this page in the first place. seems to me like u r the 15yearold one looking to start something. Great upload VTV!"
,not_my_real_name,2012-10-18T14:18Z,"What? we can't have a little adult conversation?
I'm here because I was tempted to download it, but then remembered how bad the first episode was. All thanks to the uploader for sure, but just putting another opinion out there. Why the fuck not... I might save someone half an hour of their life LOL..."
,tigerlily_1380,2012-10-18T14:28Z,Great Show love it! thx for the upload x
,mantis88,2012-10-18T14:51Z,i'm with not my real name . what a load of old rubbish. deleted it after 10 minutes. total nonsense!
,bladedracula,2012-10-18T15:16Z,cheers
,Divined7,2012-10-18T18:48Z,"Fantastic show , maybe not the most realistic but isn't that what TV is for.  not_my_real_name , seems sad and just wants to pick a fight on the e-net. Challenges someone to call this a good show lol ?"

,Flyboy09,2012-10-18T21:24Z,"seriously, you are all talk if you wanna complain about TV show shit go get funding , some top name actors, a decent script and make your dream super hero series....if you can't then shut up OMG!!!!"
,Dufox,2012-10-19T02:07Z,"im 24 and i like this show^^

the fact that he kills someone and is still considered a superhero means it has serious potential.

the whole ""cant be judge/jury and executioner"" crap  has gotten old. 
right now the show is ""ok"" (in my opinion) but i bet by season 2 or 3 it will be one of my favorite shows."
,bong420,2012-10-19T06:58Z,"so much anger, hostility and trolllling. smoke a joint, yeesh!"
,KelownaGuy,2012-10-20T05:04Z,"Love people that refuse to pay for TV, download all their shows for free, then complain about the quality of show."
,teyorya,2012-10-20T05:17Z,its funny how people complain how bad the show is or that they deleted it after 10 mins but still here to download the second episode.

,timnorris,2012-10-21T18:35Z,I saw the first episode. What a poor rip-off of the Batman series. The acting sucks too. I might give this series a couple of more shots and then I am done.
