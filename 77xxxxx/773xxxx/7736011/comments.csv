If it has ""WEB-DL"" then is should be pixalation free.

On the second point, I'm having trouble uploading anything at the moment. If / when things get back to normal, I'll consider it.

[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-17T21:14Z,"Well, no sense uploading if I cannot send the data.

And right now it looks like i first need to find a brain cell and then I can figure out what went wrong.

So, this is not goodbye, just call it a hiatus.

I seed, I get peers, but no data flows and I don't know why.

This file posted to UseNet now.

,genocide44,2012-10-18T15:00Z,since you have stopped uploading which is a shame what website do you download the web-dl tv shows from??
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-19T03:04Z,"UseNet - well worth the ten bucks a month.

It allows SSL encryption so nobody can spy on your habits.

Also, it's a download only situation, so no upload stress on your resources.

Use an nzb search engine to see what's there and then find a newsreader (usenet for ""client software"" ).

Good luck

p.s. - all the stuff I can't post here, I'm posting there.

,genocide44,2012-10-19T07:01Z,cant use usent have you tried uploading to other torrent websites??
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-19T15:43Z,"That's a shame, UseNet has done something quite amazing.

With UseNet you hear the term ""expired"", meaning that a posted article is there for a certain time and then it's gone.

And then one day nothing was ever gone again. Advertised retention rates will always point back to early September 2008.

This means it is a permanent repository for the human race without any sort of gatekeeper whatsoever. Make it a personal cloud storage facility for free - just pay for access, not storage.

Looking into the torrent block problem, but I'm pretty clueless as to how you block initial data while letting everything else through. And it's not just a tracker block - DHT should allow trackerless data transfers, but it don't.

Sigh - forced vacation isn't that terrible.
