[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-21T16:42Z,"If your having trouble understanding howto use the MS Toolkit. Use the Office E-Z Activator at the link below:

,rocky1978,2012-10-24T09:01Z,thanks for the upload. Is this office 32bit ? cos i am using 32bit com.
[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-25T03:27Z,"rocky1978

It's both 32bit and 64bit all in one.

ENJOY AND SEED!!!"
,East-17,2012-10-26T18:50Z,"The software work flawlessly, but the activator has a Trojan. 

Avira, Avast and AVG all report it as TR/Dropper.MSIL.Gen2.

The other activator recommended in the comments appear to be clean and work well, so I've used that one.

Thanks for the upload.

[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-27T01:19Z,"East-17

Glad all worked well for you.
But please note that patches,cracks,keygens,tools etc are normally flagged by A/V as trojans.
These are called ""false positives"".
ANY/ALL executables i include in my uploads have been thoroughly tested on multiple rigs before upload.

Good that you raised the issue as others can read and hopefully learn from the comments."
,Oyseka,2012-11-01T13:07Z,"Hi All, firstly thanks for the up, when trying to run the setup I get an error that says setup has stopped working. I have burnt the ISO to DVD and I have also tried unpacking and running the Setup.exe The full message reads:

Any help would be appreciated"
,Oyseka,2012-11-01T16:13Z,"Hi Again, sorry I am a F*** up, I downloaded Virtual Clonedrive which allowed me to mount the ISO and the installation went without a hitch. Thanks one again for the up."
,SSSHARK,2012-11-02T06:23Z,"This is definitely 32-bit only.  I have 64-bit Windows 8 Pro installed.  After I installed MS Office (from this torrent), and I then downloaded a 64-bit language pack here:

http://www.mydigitallife.info/office-2010-language-packs-free-official-direct-download-links/

But when I tried to install the 64-bit language pack, it produces an error saying that the Office edition I have installed is only 32-bit!

So if what you claim is true, then there must be some way to switch Office from 32 to 64.  Please advise."
,SSSHARK,2012-11-05T08:51Z,"To supplement my previous comment...
I downloaded 2010kaiser's other torrent, the one that is x64 only, and found it to truly be x64.  So I recommend that one rather than this one, if you want 64-bit MS Office Pro Plus:

,Mash92,2012-11-11T14:41Z,"Actually, teh default installer is 32-bit. If you mount teh image then go and check teh folder you'll see there is a 64-bit folder as well. Use that one to install 64-bit :)"
,neilleeds,2012-11-19T07:38Z,"Hi, 

I downloaded the software and followed the instructions, but before i could do anything the set-up immediately asked me for the product key.  But as the toolkit needed the installation complete before it would disarm the product registration, i couldn't do anything!

Does anyone have any idea why this is coming up and how i can install it without this problem?

Much help appreciated!"
,neilleeds,2012-11-19T07:57Z,"I tried installing, but asked for product key before i could do anything, and the toolkit kept saying no office product is installed.

Any ideas how to get around this?"
