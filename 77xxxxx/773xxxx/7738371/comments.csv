,AlyH,2012-10-18T08:40Z,"is this episode 11? - I think that's where we are at not 21 :-)

thanks for the upload

and I'm not sure what the freedom tracker is, sorry"
[V],psspss,2012-10-18T08:51Z,at least 3 read the comment and connect to me LOL
[V],psspss,2012-10-18T08:53Z,"call it what you want but its ep21
if the a-e site that makes the show lists only 6 in season 1 still i kinda think tvrage has it correct

you may have to rename them later if
you rename mine back is all.. :)"
,AlyH,2012-10-18T14:13Z,"the other uploaders are calling it 11 - like TVTeam and the people uploading to rlsbb

I never noticed yours having different episode numbers, but I know its the same one, since the Pinatas and Ta-tas is the same name as the one on rlsbb...

oh well weird.. 

but thanks for the upload, don't really care the episode # as long as it is the latest one hehe"
,miamisunset,2012-10-18T14:14Z,"According to Futon Critic it's
(#28) Pi単atas and Ta-tas
No production number listed, although #27 was 212.

According to Wikipedia it's
Season 3 Episode 10

According to IMDB it's
Season 3 Episode 11
(no title listed but it's the same airdate)

A&E doesn't list episode numbers.

It's probably best to just go by the episode name."
,beechyboy,2012-10-18T14:40Z,"TVRage says it is episode #21 AylH so that's good enough for me.

Thanks for the upload psspss"
[V],psspss,2012-10-18T15:55Z,"ive covered this already...

there been 27 episodes aired all together across all seasons and specials.. thats why a-e calls it so

how ever it does have a season selector
theres no season 3 only 1 and 2 and
season one has 6 episodes showing

so 27-6 gives presto 21 episodes under season 2"
,GeekinTX,2012-10-18T19:55Z,"A&E shows 6 episodes in season 1
http://www.aetv.com/storage-wars-texas/episode-guide/season-1/
and 22 episodes (so far) in season 2
http://www.aetv.com/storage-wars-texas/episode-guide/season-2/
That would be the definitive source.

The correct list is also listed on TVRage:
