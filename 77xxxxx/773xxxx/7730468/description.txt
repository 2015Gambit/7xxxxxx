 Technics SL 1210 Mk II
 Rega RB 300 tonearm (Origin Live! mod)
 Denon DL 304 M/C Cartridge
 NAD 3101 (M/C phono section)
 Outboard M-Audio Profire 610 Multichannel A/D

Method:
 - Record cleaned on Vpi machine.
 - Audio sampled at 96/32 float.
 - Filter to roll-off frequencies below 20 HZ (only below audible frequencies).

Audio restoration:
 - Manual declick and deglitch (like, maybe 30 clicks on 6 sides of vinyl!!).
 - Denoising treatments were not necessary.
 - All whole sides normalized to 100% NEVER using compression or limiting.

Synopsis:
 Very clean 200g pressings in mint condition, virtually flawless requiring almost no work at all. Like the matrix numbers suggest, it was a half-speed master too. The sound quality is very good indeed with a lot of power and not too much compression by the HD Protools mastering. I'm going to guess it was mastered at 96/24 but there's not mmuch of a way to tell. Not much more to add apart from it was fun to work on, I enjoyed every minute of it and I'm not even a huge Queen fan. Enjoy!
