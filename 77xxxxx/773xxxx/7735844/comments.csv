,captainkhaos1966,2012-10-18T01:01Z,Thanks anon. I tried to download earlier today but after an hour only had 2%. Maybe I will have better luck this time
,Who-He-iZ,2012-10-18T10:59Z,"@5-click. Thx goes to you! I know for sure that you saved this very slow torrent. It was 2% after 5 hours, then suddenly you jumped in and we got this super fast to 100%. That is what I call great work, man! 
@captain. Read above, it was 5-click who saved us. It's possible to help another user seeding. How? If you have the exactly same files on your PC, then just download the torrent to that folder.... and it will show you have 100% and start seeding at once.
That's what Maestro 5-C just did. Awesome job.
@everyone. I have uploaded a resized alternative in Others-Pictures:

,captainkhaos1966,2012-10-18T12:30Z,Ok I will remember that who. And thanks 5-click for jump starting it for us.
,5-click,2012-10-18T18:48Z,"@Who-He-iZ: Perfect explanation, i can't do it better.
@Anon: I will overtake the torrent, putting it in my upload-list on my server, for a long-time-seeding. "
