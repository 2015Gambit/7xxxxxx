In the early 80s, while in my teens, I first heard hip-hop music and it was for meΓÇª there was simply something about it that spoke to me. It was the future. It was exciting and fresh. A musical genre in its infancy that was finding its wayΓÇª learning who it was. It grew up over the yearsΓÇª it evolvedΓÇª still learning about itself. It had a chance to sell out and took it. It embraced the good times and seemed to forget about the important things in life. Eventually it was even used and manipulated by its corporate bosses.

Thankfully hip-hopΓÇÖs always had a double life. While the mainstream world thought it was one thing, it managed to keep a connection to the underground and was actually another thing. Unbeknownst to all but true heads, it continued to evolve. Today it exists in the form of the many independent EMCEEs, DJs and producers that continue to embrace it and push it and pull it and prod it and mold it and shape it into new forms that explore its past and its future. To the uninitiated, hip-hop is deadΓÇª itΓÇÖs ΓÇ£gangstaΓÇ¥ΓÇª itΓÇÖs ΓÇ£jiggyΓÇ¥ΓÇª itΓÇÖs about rimsΓÇª itΓÇÖs about hoes & bitchesΓÇª itΓÇÖs uncreativeΓÇª itΓÇÖs stupidΓÇª itΓÇÖs an embarrassment. Not trueΓÇª wellΓÇª only partially trueΓÇª it is those things and so much more.

ItΓÇÖs southΓÇª itΓÇÖs northΓÇª itΓÇÖs eastΓÇª itΓÇÖs westΓÇª itΓÇÖs everything in between. ItΓÇÖs malleable and thatΓÇÖs what makes it so incredible! When done wellΓÇª itΓÇÖs a thing of beauty. Down in Richmond, VA, thereΓÇÖs a crew called Just Plain Sounds. ItΓÇÖs a crew of talented producers, DJs and EMCEEs who are doing it wellΓÇª making it beautiful. Real music for real souls to feel and connect with. The cast of creators involved in this Joey Ripps album are mostly from RVA, part of the JPS crew who are making good things happen down there. ThereΓÇÖs also 13adluck who makes an appearance on ΓÇ£My Block To Your BlockΓÇ¥ making the team Luck & Ripps a reality once again.

So I guess what IΓÇÖm saying is that ΓÇ£Son Of 1,000 PardonsΓÇ¥ is hip-hop done well. ItΓÇÖs that stuff that isnΓÇÖt trying to ΓÇ£keep it realΓÇ¥ΓÇª only trying to keep it honest.

Thanks once again to JPS for the honest music. Thanks to Joey Ripps, Just Plain Ant, 13adluck, Bliss-One, DJ Harrison, Draztiq, Gordy Micheal, Ohbliv, Rowan & SleazeΓÇª itΓÇÖs an honor. Hey 13aluck & SleazeΓÇª see yΓÇÖall later this year on your blocSonic releases!

Of course, as always, thank you! Thanks for listening & downloading. Keep the music movingΓÇª spread the wordΓÇª share itΓÇª blog itΓÇª podcast itΓÇª oh and if youΓÇÖre in radioΓÇª support Creative Commons artistryΓÇª broadcast it!
