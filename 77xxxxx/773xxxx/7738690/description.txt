Description:
Eugenie visits her father's mistress and is introduced to the erotic games of the sex slaves… after consuming a "cocktail special" of course!
The naive teen-aged Eugénie (Beni Touxa) is strongly convinced by the perverse Martine (Carole David) to spend a weekend in her ambiguous house, after the vicious woman has seduced the girl's father. Martine's true intention is that of offering Eugénie as the main course of a secret orgy, where she plans to get the girl's father to unwittingly deflower his own daughter with the help of a "special cocktail" containing rum, urine and sperm. The young guests of this house placate their sexual lust among themselves, with the sporadic participation of a vicious young man.
As an irony of fate, this complex and articulated Jesus Franco's movie was released with one title only. An unbelievable anomaly for the productions of the Spanish cult director.
