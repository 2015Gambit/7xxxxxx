Here is the Halloween Homecoming Bootleg.  It is an earlier cut of Halloween Resurrection, with different footage, different audio, and different narration.

*** PLEASE NOTE ***

The quality is absolute SHIT by my standards, and probably yours.  The AR is 4:3 letterboxed.

This is an NTSC DVD5.

Although the quality sucks, it is important enough to see for the die-hard Halloween fans.  The first act of this film is the only part worth watching, no matter what version it is, but with the added footage at the beginning and the overall feel, it is a real shame that it was cut into the version we all know.

Again, this is not going to be a quality experience.  Just enjoy the footage of what could have been.
