Robot Chicken - Season 6 - Episode 5 (WEB-DL - 720p)
----------------------------------------------------

Robot Chicken is back for its Sixth Season of hilariously insane, wackadoodle,
totally off the wall stop-motion animation! This season's 20 brand spankin' new
episodes will flash images across your retinas and flood your brains with an
overabundance of mind-melting pop culture spoofery that will most likely cause
your head to explode and leave a stain on the couch that will never come out (sorry Mom)!

Produced by Williams Street, ShadowMachine, Sony Pictures and Stoopid Monkey.

Middle-Earth will never be the same after Robot Chicken takes on "The Lord of the
Rings"; We imagine what happens when Elijah finally makes it home for Passover
Seder; Elliot and E.T. have another adventure; Ben 10 gets a birthday present he
didn't expect; The creators bring Captain Planet back to try to save the Earth.
