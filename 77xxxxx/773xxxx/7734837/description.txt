Much like U2, Radiohead do regular battle with their group identity, harvesting new ideas and pathways to the future while simultaneously acknowledging their past legacy. With 2007ΓÇÖs In Rainbows, Radiohead continue to seek new patterns and blends without succumbing to pure art for artΓÇÖs sake. Kid A and Amnesiac took them to the ambient edge and theyΓÇÖve been clawing themselves slowly back to the pop playground ever since. Thom Yorke is a naturally gifted vocalist whose acapella can lift any melody to stratospheric heights and when his group turns down the volume and settles into a subdued groove (ΓÇ£Nude, ΓÇ£ ΓÇ£Weird Fishes/ ArpeggieΓÇ¥), the result is a surreal new age vibe where what could be sterile, slick tones are infused with touches of extreme emotionalism. There is always a sense of danger lurking in the guitars and keyboards; storm clouds frequently gather by mid-song. The angry clank of ΓÇ£15 Step,ΓÇ¥ the marching synthesizer doom behind ΓÇ£All I Need,ΓÇ¥ the obscuring, mysterious reverb of ΓÇ£House of CardsΓÇ¥ create soundscapes that arenΓÇÖt afraid to dream beyond the usual instrumental limits.
