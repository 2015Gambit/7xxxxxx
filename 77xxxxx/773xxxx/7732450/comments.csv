Whoever that is who keeps writing reviews in utorrent like ""You should send me the file so i can help seed this"" basically, screw off with that request. I am not a fan of these types of people and will toss you off the connection permanantly for bitching at me here and falsely reporting a fake. Pirate Bay run successfully off people PROPERLY reporting a file, not some dipshit pissed off hes in line with 600 other people whining about a file he couldnt google for himself to get the 480,720,1080p rips for cuz im working as hard as i can to get it out there. First of these people are selfish and WILL NEVER seed a damn thing for Pirate Bay, and probably never have before neither. These are people i will toss off the torrent and ip ban you from getting it from me meaning you'll wait EVEN longer cuz you decided to whine. Right now its reporting 1 seeder, know why? The other 10 who already grabbed a copy fucked off somewhere and left you all hanging and i gotta do it alone. Wanna complain? Then throw the hell down and contribute, considering as it stands theres only me and 1 other person with rips of this here and his are romanian audio.  I've invested damn near 3 days into ensuring you all can get a copy......what are you doing to better the situation other than mouthing off at the original contributor because you're to damn selfish to contribute?"

,SugarGuY,2012-10-18T05:30Z,"So man are you going to seed this . 24% for 3 days now, thanks"
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-18T21:53Z,"Holy crap, I've been seeding this for like 4 days now. Wanna bitch at someone, bitch at the ones who aint seeding. Not me. Considering the ones who bitch have never contributed here themselves (like kraftseeder and Sugarguy there, trust me we know you've done jack shit for this site, clicking on your name proves it) I've put up over 300 torrents on this site, NEVER BEFORE have a i seen such pointless BITCHING before on a torrent. So much in fact people are hitting the -1 cuz of the speeds meaning they don't even have a clue on how this site even works. Asking me if im seeding it....That just got you ip banned."
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-18T22:39Z,"Here time for you all to read some of these horseshit comments and messages you're sending me:

""What happened to however posted this"" Been right here haven't stopped seeding or uploading.

""Give it to me first then i can seed it to everyone"" Came from someone who ""lost"" their Pirate Bay login details, and hasnt uploaded a thing here.

""i get 100-200 mb then it stops"" Thats not me, check your computer.

And to the rest whining bitching and complaining ""Seed"" ""Seeding this please"" etc, do you know how stupid you sound? Notice the title, webripz, meaning i got it off a streaming website and you just went to pirate bay looking for a copy without doing any research of where i got it from. If you're gonna bitch, im sure waiting in a queue'd line of over a million people STILL waiting for Redbull, Youtube, or even Discovery Channel to post the replay will be fine enough for you. You can accept your 1/1000000 spot chance of actually seeing it from them or 100% success rate of a TRUSTED uploader here..... Your choice. Next complaints, false flagging, etc you're being booted off the connection period."

[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-19T12:38Z,"""What happened to whoever posted this"" that wasnt bad, but asking for a copy before anyone else then admitting your forgot your login in here, that one pushed it to far. The only people on this site i would trust to help with my files have green, blue and pink skulls next to their name."
,DistendedCapacitor,2012-10-19T13:18Z,"I'm a mod in a pC these days, and have been for a couple years now. I've made probably 15-20 accounts on here.. when i said ""original"" I was indeed referring to the 1 or 2 accounts i had waaay back that had 'credentials'. I made a new account, well, because i ""cant afford not to"". (not tryin to sound like billy badass or some shit, extenuating circumstances for aprx 4-6 more months.)"
,DistendedCapacitor,2012-10-19T13:24Z,"but yeah, i had hoped the middle paragraph would bolster some confidence. No nubleech with zero uploads is going to know how shitty it is to sit on a torrent for weeks while thousands of people download it... and no one seeds ffs.

I didnt want to come right out and say it if i was gonna be putting addresses up, but i've got access to probably 4-10mB/s  uL bandwidth. That doesnt sit on my //ain line either. ;P

one word...

fractal.    lol"
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-19T14:44Z,"K that wasnt the breaking point for me. That was mild compared to the constant ""Seed"" ""is this being seeded"" ""where did this go"" etc is what got to me. I've had even more leeched items up here than this, this was the most complained about. Even my rips of like Trailer Park Boys 2, was desired just as much as this, yet not one of the people who downloaded this have bothered to seed for others and they are the ones doing the most bitching about it. 

Sorry if I doubt ya, I've been a member here since like 2007 and havent lost my login details, ever. Those who wanna initially seed tho from here MUST have a blue, green or pink skull. Its nothing against you personally, just I need a resume before you get it first before everyone else. I'm a loner as it is, doubt thats changing, hence why i worked for years to get my skull. I would only expect the same if not better to help with my torrents."
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-20T06:48Z,"THERE FINALLY SOME SEEDERS FOR YOU! Thank you to all that weren't greedy, whining, complaining, thank you for contributing to get this up there. OFFICIALLY The Pirate Bay had the replay in the most available HD formats before Discovery Channel, Youtube, and Redbull could provide us all with one. Thank you to all with the patience to bear with my slow ass speeds (I have 2 machines running here for torrents so no matter what now when 1 machine goes down the torrents staying up, i was also having x64 xp issues and finally got disgusted with it and switched to 32 bit for this machine) Hope its what the HD crew likes, like i said for me to do HD format is kinda of a new deal. Now you all see why i upload smaller versions of the tv shows at a time, easier for me to get it out there."
,serialdownloader,2012-10-20T11:11Z,Anyone got a pure English version of this in 720p/1080p?
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-21T20:14Z,"Far as I know there is no ""true"" full english version of it. Stories of YT and Redbull teaming up to flag those who actually do post the whole thing in english. There are bits and pieces in english, nothing with this length or quality from what i seen. Shame to, i know people are still wanting the full thing in english."
,DistendedCapacitor,2012-10-22T02:13Z,"when you say you need a resume for people to help with U/L - i read that loud and clear. And I cant remember, but to the best of my knowledge i never posted a beligerent ""SEEEEEEED"" comment. Though if i did post anything about seeding, it was directed towards the LeechLejun - not you. I did post the ""what happened to whoever"" comment, but that was at the very beginning when i saw the masses stuck at 2% or w/e. I've seen many torrents where the popularity scares the seeder and they sorta say ""fuck it"" you know? (not the case here, you obviously stand by your u/Ls - which is good - and rare these days)"
,DistendedCapacitor,2012-10-22T02:32Z,"i dont know whats up with my comments not showing. I press submit, not hide, and they still dont show up...

anyways, a couple things:
check that rediculous uber-rar, left a comment on there for you.

also, if you can find a full copy of just the english audio, I wouldnt mind replacing the audio on these files with the english audio. (im sure you can mix, sync, and master... crowdsourcing lol)"
,You_Muppet,2012-10-24T00:43Z,Reading these comments was the most fun I've had all day :)
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-26T15:36Z,"Now looking back at them after these are being seeded properly, they are. Should pull the torrent just to look at the comments they left on the torrents themselves."
[T],n2kmaster,2012-11-01T19:25Z,"and @You_Muppet, you've contributed NOTHING, mouthed on not even the main page of N2KMaster on FB (one of my sub sites, actually its funny as hell now on my side), gave a big long ass speech about how you at 22 (who claims to work his own ios business - as if! considering you couldnt even google properly to find me and got your ass chucked there thinking i was throwing some coniption fit here over the leechers pigging and not sharing is setting me off. No what sets me off is punk kids who think they know their stuff trolling on pages with sheer and utter nonsense about how you are somehow better than the rest of this world. This isnt a rant and rave, this is your 5 seconds of my time that your worth telling you this is about as famous as you'll ever be. And you dont even have a skull...... Tsk Tsk...."
