,uhaaaaa,2012-10-18T12:31Z,The ending is from a different show!!
,Furious_Child,2012-10-18T13:28Z,Wow...I've been so beyond disappointed with you and ETTV the last few weeks. Your downloads have sucked. Audio out of sync and now not even the proper ending to the show. I'm not going to waste my time on either of you anymore. Your little green skulls should be removed. You can no longer be trusted.
,ellakim1,2012-10-18T14:08Z,"EZTV are the same too, all they want is fast and crappy x264, with out of sync audio, pic res usually too high as well resulting in often jittery movement. Another crap up then."

,Dizzy8,2012-10-19T20:18Z,"Thanks Shogun, since I wasn't able to watch the original I didn't know, and was disappointed. The audio/video has been good for me. The only thing that has disappointed me with some of your uploads is the in and out of focus of some series and episodes. You get used to it, and sometimes don't notice, but when you are aware, it's quite annoying."
