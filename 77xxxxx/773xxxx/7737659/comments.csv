,Yes613,2012-10-18T17:29Z,deluxe has a 2nd cd an extra 6 tracks see wiki
,Yes613,2012-10-18T17:42Z,the audio bitrate is not consistent. but it's lower than 320
,thriftstoretalent,2012-10-18T19:34Z,"I see. I was incorrectly informed. Sorry about that. Too bad tpb coding doesn't allow for renaming. :/

I'll have the real deluxe up as soon as it's leaked."
,thriftstoretalent,2012-10-18T22:34Z,"@yes316: this rip seems to use VBR(variable bitrate) to avoid wasting data space. the max kbps is 320, which is useful for full eq spectrum allocation. but VBR cuts down the bitrate during unnecessary points, such as silences, talking, or anything that doesn't use the full frequency spectrum. I'm not a fan of VBR, so when I rip the cd myself, it'll be constant 320 for sure."
