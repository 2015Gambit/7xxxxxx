Doug Cameron - Mona With the Children

I have been trying to replicate my record collection on my hard drive so that I can play my music without worrying about wearing out the analogue recordings and so that I can take my collection with me whenever I go to work out of town.

I searched and was not able to find this album anywhere else online and the LP (obviously) is long out of print.  I do not believe that it has ever been released on CD.  I would not share the music if it was otherwise available.

Stats:  Original Pressing
        True North Records
        Dual CS16-1214 Turntable
        Shure M75 Cartridge / RS70 Stylus
        MP3 - 320kps

Please give feedback, and don't forget to seed!

Enjoy!
