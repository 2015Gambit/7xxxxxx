Nesta divertida comédia, Zack e Benji decidem passar um fim de semana em Palm Springs, e embora sejam só amigos, decidem fingir que são namorados, a fim de tirarem partido da situação. Mas, como já era de esperar, as coisas complicam-se…

Zack and his new boyfriend Benji are setting off to vacation at an all-male resort in Palm Springs with their friend Lily. In light of the veritable smorgasbord of available men that are sure to be awaiting their arrival, Benji has proposed that he and Zack open up their relationship, just for the weekend. He's not ready to limit himself sexually and explains that this will be a good way for them to explore together. Zack is less than thrilled with the idea, but he's eager to keep Benji happy and, after all, he likes sex too. At the same time, Zack's ex, Casey, is making his way to the same resort with his hag-in-training, Penny. Knowing that Zack will be there with his new boyfriend, Casey immediately goes into panic mode, recruiting his new friend, Peter, to be his pretend boyfriend for the weekend, proving to Zack that he's had no trouble moving on from their relationship...
