7.21 GiB !!

????!!!!??"
[V],Murlok,2012-10-17T22:31Z,Mike_Bottigheimer so you beat Skidrow good upload the smaller or just FO:(
,IndigoAK,2012-10-17T23:12Z,The real question is does the DLC work?  With the 1.5 patch you had to jump through hoops to get it to work with Skidrow's release.
,moeburn1,2012-10-18T14:44Z,not an update.  full release of updated game.  please label your torrents correctly.
[V],Murlok,2012-10-18T18:31Z,moeburn1 problem read? its Skidrow who named it I not :D
,boyznacne,2012-10-18T21:52Z,"Um isn't the reason this download is 7.21GB because in order for Skidrow to update the game they need to manually update ALL the files hence the full game size?

Update v1.6 just like v1.5 which is small in size but it changes a lot of files of the main game , so skidrow just cracks all the files after they have been updated.
"
,boyznacne,2012-10-18T22:01Z,"to sum it up

apparantly the update injection process has been changed in steam, and crack group isnt able at this time to emulate there update procedure, so they have basically altered manually every file modified by the normal steam update, this however means that every file modified is a complete replacement.

So to cut a long story short.......

This is only a update and still requires the original game installed first, then this will replace most of the existing files with ""patched modified versions"" of the same.

Example: if the sub 200mb steam update inserts one line of code into a 1gb file then SkidRow have to replace the whole 1gb file."
,Wisher_SiD,2012-10-19T18:15Z,The game wont load for me when i continue my save game or even new game. It just keeps on loading.
,Ryke13,2012-10-20T02:26Z,"does it have the new 4 dlc packs? 

tactical soldier

,Evil-Phoenix,2012-10-22T16:29Z,"I downloaded game 1 day ago and yesterday downloaded and installed this patch.Did everything like in Install notes but have same problem as Wisher_SiD

How to fix this problem ? Also will appreciate if someone will upload all DLC separately."
,webflashing,2012-10-25T07:32Z,"For all of you getting stuck at the loading screen, there's a post on the official Sleeping Dogs forum that says to download the latest BETA drivers for AMD. (If you have Nvidia then sorry for you).

Trying them right now.

,yosa716,2012-10-26T03:50Z,Everytime I start a new game It shows no intro/cutscene and starts me under a bridge 1900m away from Naz and says you got 20 seconds to catch up. Then when the 20 seconds ends and it starts to load something it closes my game.
,yosa716,2012-10-26T03:56Z,"Game shows no intros/cutscenes at all and crashes, 1st mission starts me out 1900m away from where its supposed to"
,MacPain_,2012-10-26T18:11Z,"Im having the same problem aswell. After I click ""New Game"" I get stuck at the loading screen. And I cant use the AMD 12.11 beta driver either. Since that driver is for Radeon HD 5xxx series and up. And I have a 4xxx series card >_<
Anyone know if another crack/patch might do the trick?"
