one question though, would it be better to just vie the show in its format or change it to like an avi or mp4 or something like that?"

,rmekdaschi,2012-10-18T15:18Z,"jesus christ just use format factory, or some other conversion program to get it in avi. They already work pretty hard to get this stuff out there, so stop being whiny little bitches and do it yourself! Thanks a lot ettv"
