,bidawi,2012-10-17T02:31Z,Thanks a lot for this and your other uploads. Much appreciated. Cheers.
,jmchip1,2012-10-17T04:22Z,"Did not work for me. Followed the instructions to the letter. The serial numbers generated worked for the install, but were invalid on the Adobe website when asking for the response code for offline activation. So only the trial version could be installed."
,Boomer47,2012-10-17T05:13Z,Where are the Serial Numbers?
,panpanbebe,2012-10-17T15:34Z,doesn't work

,thefog71,2012-10-18T01:29Z,"@Boomer47,CallMeDegel:, (Running @ 10.8.2 Mac), I uninstall Adobe Acrobat 10 thru CleanMyMac apps. Follow the instructions carefully! Did not use terminal command just copy paste ""adobe blocker"". But before copy paste ""adobe blocker"" as instructed,(clear that host file first). Actually its the same ""adobe blocker"" from AA10; just make sure clean that @ host file., when you install AA11. Its like fresh install apps. Note: After install and done message pos up? Just click ""import"" from previous certificate...ALL is Well ..Thanks Ching_Liu !!! Trusted Pirate Har har har"
,GSPT,2012-10-18T12:27Z,Thanks. I also followed to the letter but it fails to generate an activation code.

,berlines,2012-10-20T03:54Z,"Got lost in step 7:


7. Run Osx/disable_activation_osx as root
   if you dont know how to do that, open a terminal window
   then issue sudo -s, a root shell will open
   then simply do ""sh disable_activation_osx""  w/o the """"
   or ./disable_activation_osx( make it executable chmod 755 disable_activation_osx 
   you do that from the folder where disable_activation_osx is. (just copy it anywhere on your hdd)

Help please. I ran the terminal window and entered the commands specified above but I keep getting error ""command not found"" or ""No such file or directory.""  Can you please explain how to do step 7 more clearly?  Thanks!"
,Saigaijin,2012-10-20T03:55Z,UNBELIEVABLY unhelpful install instructions.  Better torrents elsewhere on TPB.

,swedishmatch5604,2012-10-20T21:00Z,"GUIDE:


1. Disable your Network card or pull the network cable out.
   And make sure you dont have any of those entries in your hosts file: 
   127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
   127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com
   Lets start clean :) 
(look at step 7 how to check or edit the host file, I had the X version installed before so I removed the old entries in the host file)
(Of course uninstall previous versions of acrobat if you have it installed)

2. Install Adobe Acrobat XI Pro , Select Trial

3. Launch Adobe Acrobat XI
   Enter a Serial generated by our Keygen, DONT Close the Keygen or write your serial down
   When the error ""Please connect to the internet and retry"", shows click connect later.

4. Start or Restart Adobe Acrobat XI, after a while you will have an option
   To register (under Help Menu). Select and Confirm you have ""connection problem"" 
   and you want it to activate offline.

5. A request code will be generated. Use it with the serial you used to install adobe 
   to generate an activation code. (You can copy and paste this code from the adobe application to the keygen, just make sure to right click and copy, the fast command ctrl c didn't work for me)

6. Validate it of course :). Dont Restart Adobe Acrobat BEFORE step7 is done

7. Open a Terminal window. Enter command: 
sudo nano /private/etc/hosts
Enter your password end press enter.
You can navigate the file using the arrow keys, paste these two lines in the bottom of the file:

# Adobe Blocker

127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com

When done editing the hosts file, press control-o to save the file and press enter. Then exit the Terminal app. 

RESTART the macintosh


8. After it has been activated re-enable you Network card and run the adobe updater to update your software to the latest version.

9. Enjoy!

Worked for me - thanks!"
,totor69,2012-10-21T06:34Z,"Parfait. Tout est impeccable.
Merci, Thanks a lot."
,posciena,2012-10-21T19:20Z,"Dear uploader,
Thanks for this great torrent as for your instructions.
However, despite several install/uninstall attemps, and use of CleanMyMac, it is not working at all!
I am stuck at step 3 and the generated serials are absolutely not recognized.
I of course removed those two lines from the hosts file to begin with.
Please help!!!!!!!!"
,lobs11,2012-10-22T12:23Z,Thanks so much for the upload. it's perfect.  Any chance you can crack MYOB AccountEdge for Mac? I can see the trial version but no crack anywhere on the net?
,ronparchita,2012-10-23T14:39Z,"Thanks for this version. I am really sorry.
It does not work. Impossible to reach the forth step
The X version works well"
,dukeduke1774,2012-10-23T19:52Z,"Do this it will work better

1. Open Terminal
2. Paste this command: sudo nano /private/etc/hosts You’ll be asked to enter your administrator password.
3. Arrow down to the last line, highlighted here, and type your entry like this: 137.61.27.216 www.tech.com
NOTE This IS WHAT TO ADD…………
# Adobe Blocker
127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com
_____________________________________________
4. Press control+x. Type the letter Y. This saves the file.
NOTE I HAD TO CLOSE THE TERMINAL HERE AND REOPEN IT AND THEN DO STEP #5
5. To flush your DNS cache so the changes take effect, paste this command next: dscacheutil -flushcache
6. You can test if it has worked by using the PING command. Try PING tech.com and PING www.tech.com – the IP addresses should be different."
,ronparchita,2012-10-24T17:45Z,"Thanks dukeduke1774
Please just two or three indications

- Before step one, do I install the .dmg ?

Step three. Is it my IP adress ? 
Is it one space and : www.tech.com or is it the line after ?

And this : # Adobe Blocker
127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com
Is it in the same window or it needs to clic return before to type this three lines ?

is all you write instead of to use the code generator ?

Thanks again

,aloofs,2012-10-26T15:01Z,"@ChingLiu - Great work!
@swedishmatch5604 - Followed your guide and it works like a charm. Gött!"

,posciena,2012-10-28T12:04Z,"Hi,
No offense but this is absolutely not working.
All serials appear to be blacklisted at first. Would it be possible to have new ones or another keygen?
Thx"
,elroy23,2012-11-04T23:37Z,"Work fine.  If you can't follow instructions, don't try it.  Learn to edit the hosts file (/private/etc/hosts), how to turn off your network connection and how to NOT connect to the internet until you've generated the response code.  
If you follow the directions, it works fine."
,73173user,2012-11-07T21:24Z,"i have a doubt, i used the trial version with an adobe count, and i have tried to erase all info about it in my mac, but it just keeping telling me that i have x days of trial and don't seems to tell me anything about ""connection problem"", is there a form to erase all??"
,xintbp,2012-11-08T15:32Z,"Oki guys, I think a lot of people are confused about the KeyGen process from X-Force,

This is how you do it.. because I myself wasted 1 day figuring this out.. and it finally worked. Steps 1 through 5 is very important.. if you couldn't do this uninstall and re-install adobe without the internet connection.

1. Install your Adobe Pro.. DO NOT OPEN it see below when to open it.

2. run your key gen x-force

3. generate a serial number and copy it somewhere (textpad/notepad..etc) 

3. close x-Force make sure you have the serial if not re-open and generate another.

4. disconnect your internet connection. (both wifi and cable if you have. 

5. NOW OPEN your adobe, and open any pdf.. after few mins it will ask you to activate stating you have ""xx"" number of days before you can activate it.  Select Enter License ... 

6.(Double check you are not on the internet) Now enter the copied Serial Number on to the licensing field.. 

7. It will complain stating internet connection is not found ..bla bla bla. just ignore it. and Select Activate Later

8. Close your Adobe.. (CMD + Q to quit the app all together _ 

9. Still make sure your internet is down... 

10. Re-open adobe and now again select product registration under help, if it doesn't pop open.. This time it will state  ""internet connection problem offline Activate.. or something similar ""

11. now when you press that a long crazy ""request code is generated"" Copy this to the same doc/textpad/notepad where you copied your ""serial number"" on step 3. 

12. NOW re-open x-Force and copy/paste the Serial and the request code from step 11 above. (make sure you delete the ""Press generate or paste serial here""  and ""Paste request code here""  before you paste them.

13. Press ""gen. activation code"" this should generate the code you need to copy it back to the adobe activation process. 

13. YOUR INTERNET still should be DISCONNECTED. copy the generated ""activation code"" back to adobe and press activate

14. now adobe will state it is activated. 

15. Quit Adobe,

16. edit your hosts file  (I am not going to describe that process as its described below)  and add the loop back info 127.0.0.1 .... and connect your internet.

17. Re-Open the adobe and now it should stop complaining.. 

cheers

,Frazier15,2012-11-11T04:10Z,Heads up!!! Use little snitch to block adobe updater helper or acrobat updater helper (can't remember) to avoid reverting to a trial mode.
,themmee,2012-11-15T22:56Z,For me it is the force keygen that does not work... open and close... Snow Leon ?
