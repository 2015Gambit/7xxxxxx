,Schabe,2012-10-18T01:46Z,The same shitty English subs that are everywhere else.
,ofpirate,2012-10-18T02:22Z,agree with everyone else - not much point to this without PROPER subs.. first to release with correct hard-coded subs for the non-english dialog will be a HERO!
,spiritualiste,2012-10-18T02:49Z,"Hi Twentyforty,

:D"
[V],twentyforty,2012-10-18T07:54Z,"I don't do subs, I put in the torrent what is currently available.

This is not the place for bitching about quality of subtitles. If I want to be rude - no one except yourself is to be blamed for own stupidity (low IQ) and been unable to understand few main languages. Italian is one of them. BTW, can anyone name ONE single reason, except mentioned, for not speaking several languages?

If you wont do that - maybe Woody Allen movies are too ""complicated"" and you should stick with cartoons."
[V],twentyforty,2012-10-18T08:32Z,"@Schabe: I know. It is few days old disk. Be patient. First subs (""early"" subs) are sometimes machine-translated and - stupid. But, this is no place for bitching about subs - movie encode is what I have done. Subtitles are 100 KB only and I have many times downloaded even dozen for same title to get good one. And here was nothing to choose from.

@ofpirate: ""Everyone else""? One guy above is hardly ""everyone""... Judging by that I would recommend watching Scooby Doo for you. LOL"

1st-I placed the exact same comment in each of the 5 available hi-res torrents of this film.. not singling out any particular print

2nd- I am simple voicing the collective frustration I see being expressed here on the bay, subscene, opensubs, etc

3rd- I am a film major, a filmmaker, and specifically a cinematographer.. I watch literally hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of films every year (many of which are foreign).. 

4th- I have prints of everything Woody has ever done, and Darius Khondji is arguably the best living cinematographer working today!

5th- I love Scooby Doo! I grew up on that shit..

With all do respects, your comments read like the rantings of a frustrated teenage boy.."
[V],twentyforty,2012-10-18T22:02Z,"You try to sound intelligent, but your conclusion speaks otherwise.  You are in short - nobody. 

If you have read and tried to understand what I answered to ""Everyone else"" (one guy) you would see what you have got wrong. And maybe (but I am sure how you will not) see how you are ONLY ONE who wrote ""the rantings of a frustrated teenage boy"".

I just put you on right place.

And please, drop the shit ""I am a film major, a filmmaker, and specifically a cinematographer.""
Anyone can say whatever he want.

I will repeat and you read even few times or use Google-translator:
""I know. It is few days old disk. Be patient. First subs (""early"" subs) are sometimes machine-translated and - stupid. But, this is no place for bitching about subs - movie encode is what I have done. Subtitles are 100 KB only and I have many times downloaded even dozen for same title to get good one. And here was nothing to choose from.""

I am encoder and I uploaded my work for free?
What you have done here?
Bitching - not saying a word about the movie.

And how in fuck's name anyone should know aside how you sound pretty frustrated (try masturbating) and who do you are - how you LEFT same comment on all uploads of other people? LOL. By saying THAT - you gave away how I have right. Spamming troll and jerk."
[V],twentyforty,2012-10-18T22:26Z,"BTW, about your ""intelligence"" speaks a Copied&Pasted absolutely same comment such as:

To.Rome.With.Love.2012.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-HDChina [PublicHD]

Hero? For someone like you? No fucking way."
[V],twentyforty,2012-10-18T22:39Z,Not good - but better forced English subtitles appeared (ebp_eng).
