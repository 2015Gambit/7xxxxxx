,nipunb,2012-10-19T21:19Z,"working perfectly finally!!!
firsly, go to this page:
http://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_mark_of_the_ninja.shtml
and download the ""Mark of the Ninja v1.1 [MULTI6] Fixed Files #1"" by Fairlight
extract the files and copy them to your install directory and overwrite existing files....
secondly, don't use the desktop shortcut to run the game, use the original game.exe..
working perfectly for me after doing this...."
,colinb74,2012-10-21T06:56Z,"@nipunb - Thanks, these files could come in handy  in the future. My solution to fix this was simply run in XP SP3 Compatibility Mode (I am using win 8 pro). This fixed the issue for me so far, no more CTD. Hope this helps and thank you again!"
,colinb74,2012-10-21T07:02Z,"OMG, how fucking rude of me- I forgot to thank you T.F.K!! Great up, cheers!"
,danielsrg,2012-11-25T12:30Z,"it sucks!! I download the game,but when i try to open with winrar and extract, it necessary the .r00  but don't have!!!!!FIX"
