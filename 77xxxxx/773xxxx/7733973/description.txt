Steve (Billy Dee) runs a dude ranch in the mountains and, after teaching Suzie (Amber Lynn) the finer points of "horsing around" he challenges this rich little Beverly Hills "brat" and her friends to a game of "Cowboys and Indians". In the sexy free-for-all we find out if those "ol' six shooters" are really better than a quiver full of arrows. The cowboys are up to the challenge, but the Indians princesses "head 'em off at the pass". In the woods, this raiding party would have made Custers Last Stand... his last lay.
