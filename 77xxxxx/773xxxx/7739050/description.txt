                 Info      
          
           
            Based on the true story of the ill-fated 13th 
           Apollo mission bound for the moon. Astronauts Lovell,
            Haise and Swigert were scheduled to fly Apollo 14, 
           but are moved up to 13. It's 1970, and America have 
            already achieved their lunar landing goal, so there's 
           little interest in this "routine" flight.. until 
            that is, things go very wrong, and prospects of 
           a safe return fade.
           

                                   
                Notes      
          
           
             We have internal'd this release for a few reasons
            The main reasons being that the bitrate for this
             release seems to be on the high side. Which is
            FINE for releases that are internal acording to 
             txd2005. As far as we can tell no oen else has
            released the IMAX version of this film.
             Just a note on the aspect ratio, it is within
            scene standards because the imax aspect ratio
             is different than regular wide screen. Lastly,
            we tagged the year of this film as the year
             that the IMAX version was released NOT the
            year of the origional release.
