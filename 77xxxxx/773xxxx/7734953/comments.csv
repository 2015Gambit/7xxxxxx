,ramrod911,2012-10-19T03:10Z,Could you please re-release this game with the new patch included??? or could you just release the patch as standalone??? The games crashes for me because of my old GFX card. This was resolved in the new patch. Please help.

the version of file is not compatible with the version of windows you are using . Checkyour computer's system information to seewhether you need an x86 (32 bit ) or x64 (64bit) version of program and then contact the software publisher"

So I need to delete the games without any playing or any positive thing....for the 1st time extremezone make me dissapointed"
,phat_71,2012-10-22T06:28Z,"I'm so sick of reading stupid shit from people talking about viruses. Anybody who flat out says something from VIP or Trusted sources is a virus needs to have their internet removed. I've been pirating games for as long as game pirating has been around, and most of my software is pirated as well (excluding free-ware). I use Avast, always have, and for now always intend to. Know how many viruses I've gotten from games? 0. None, not a god damn one. Even if something flags (usually only ever happens with keygens) I can just open it in sandbox mode, get the keys I need, and close it. Nothing happens. If you people can't learn how things work with pirated software then go buy it and quit crying and bitching and bothering those of us who aren't complete and total morons."
,Aeroastro1,2012-10-23T13:30Z,"Just temporarily disable your anti-virus if you get any warnings, and install the game. It works just fine."
,haveaquestion,2012-10-23T14:09Z,"!!!Does anyone know why can't I assassinate people in the first mission, when it comes to silent kills!!!"

,anita3332,2012-10-24T11:58Z,"False positive MY ASS.. Had to reboot in safe mode (cuz my pc, as the others say, went nuts) to delete everything and then my computer was fine! after that i checkd the antivirus log (bitdefender 2012) and yes it came up with a trojan.. so yeah it's NOT a false positive"
,PornFTW7,2012-10-24T20:09Z,"bitdefender, really? "
,deaderweterdog,2012-10-25T00:12Z,i get a virus warning but no problems seems like a false pos to me but every 10 sec it says cant save im guessing an autosave isue makes it unplayable since it tryes to save  when enemys are near and thay shoot you while i select retry or cancel looked like a decent game to
,Cys1ek,2012-10-27T20:13Z,"Fake virus alert, you morons..."
,xXNeoREXx,2012-10-28T10:16Z,It works 100%
,fuckingtrojan,2012-10-28T17:43Z,"This shit has a fucking trojan in.

If it was a False Positive I wouldn't have to enter safe mode like the last guy because the piece of shit keeps running in the background and won't let me delete in normally.

Don't waste your Bandwith."
,ainstainy123,2012-10-29T00:03Z,found virus
,Hype4fun,2012-10-29T20:21Z,"I am awere of falsepositive viruses, and im downloading games for past 10 years,never had some problems. After i instaled this game, all crashed,even my bios went down. Black screen, cant shut it down without unpluging power cabel. Maybe its not virus but this softer fucked up all. So ppl, maybe it will work for u like other ppll wich commented here.

Real one. ^"
,moeburn1,2012-11-08T20:14Z,"Why is it that every single THETA release contains ""false positive"" viruses, when the EXACT SAME GAME released by other groups contain no such thing?

Because THETA sticks to very easy-to-crack games and focuses all their efforts on what they are really here for: building a botnet to sell."
,GeneralTso92,2012-11-10T23:42Z,"@moeburn1

Really?
Theta isn't really that bad, its just retards who have absolutely no idea what they're talking about."

,Timbo6669,2012-11-20T10:16Z,YOu guys are funny....trojan??? hehe..Like EZ would upload a virus...?!?! wow...ppl are getting younger or stupider???
,Timbo6669,2012-11-20T10:20Z,YOu guys are funny....the simpliest answer is usually the right one...EZ has never uploaded a virus to my cpu...SO....You must have downloaded something else and got virus then you r anti virus confused the dates and name (it happens)...No way this is infected....
,YALazyBum,2012-11-20T14:25Z,i wish i had enough money to punch every in the face who has or is going to say EZ or any other skulled guy in here has uploaded a virus...
