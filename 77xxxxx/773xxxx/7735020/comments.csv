,zaifoi,2012-10-18T18:36Z,@jdabas  where can I find the serial number? :(
,zaifoi,2012-10-18T19:35Z,"Ok @jdabas @anarchist9027 I Did what you guys said BUT the adobe keeps telling me:

Validating serial number.. Please connect to the internet!

I'm pretty sure that I'm online :| can plz help me"
,Lenchanteurmerlin,2012-10-18T23:25Z,"It works.  No need to do anything butr to use the activator.  I had some difficulties with Avast about it.  Those who find that the number does not work, do not understand that they ahve to chose the TRIAL version.  The number is to be used AFTER.  I am now on a 32627 days trial period.  Should do the job."
,anarchist9027,2012-10-19T04:14Z,"I will try to explain this step by step.

1) Disconnect from the internet.
2) Patch Your hosts file
3) Install with an Acrobat 10 Serial (Keep it off hand for the Keygen)
4) Launch Acrobat
5) It will try to connect to the internet but cannot
6) Click the link about Offline Activation
7) Get the response code from Acrobat
8) Make sure you copy your acrobat 10 serial into the serial field
9) Copy your response code from Acrobat into the keygen in the 2nd filed)
10) Click generate an Voila, you have your activation code
11) Copy the activation code into Acrobat and click next and you are activated :)"
,gadgetpal,2012-10-19T05:47Z,"Thanks for the effort Ching Liu.

Just a sharing info. How I got mine to work is
a) Get an adobe ID
b) Download the official trial version, which is faster than torrent
c) Install the official, activate it using the adobe ID, when launch it will gives you 30 days trial message
d) Download this torrent, exclude all other files except the amtlkib.dll  scan it for virus
e) Go to C:WindowsSystem32driversetc double click on the file name hosts, choose notepad to open it and add in this line 127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
f) Go to C:Program Files (x86)AdobeAcrobat 11.0Acrobat and rename the amtlkib.dll to amtlkib.old
g) copy the 'cracked' amtlkib.dll to the location 

Activated (official), full version, etc etc. This works for me, hope it works for you. The reason is that the trial version is already activated, hence no need serial number, the amtlkib.dll should be the one that let the cracked version runs without triggering activation. the edited host file block the activation outgoing, so all works well."
,zaifoi,2012-10-19T15:56Z,@anarchist9027 where can I find the offline activation?? there is nothing in the Help menu...
,anarchist9027,2012-10-19T16:29Z,"@zaifoi
When you get the activation Window in Acrobat after you install, it will try connecting to the internet, if you are still disconnected from the internet, you will click the button, ""try activation later"" or some shit like that. Close Acrobat and open it back up. You will get the activation window again but you will have a link for the option for offline activation in the window somewhere. Click that link and you'll have the offline activation method. Enjoy"
,zaifoi,2012-10-19T18:26Z,@anarchist9027 Thank you man it is worked!! Cheerss PARTY TIME hahaa =)

,cmonroy,2012-10-19T23:07Z,"You know why replace AMTLIB.DLL is not working for you? Simple: you need to start Acrobat XI once with the original file to accept the license and finish installation. Once completed, exit Acrobat and replace the original file with the cracked one. It should work now."
,cmonroy,2012-10-19T23:09Z,"To modify HOSTS file, open your Notepad AS ADMINISTRATOR, then navigate to Windows > System32 > Drivers > Etc and see all files. You should be able to edit HOSTS file without a hitch now."
,zaifoi,2012-10-20T15:43Z,"1. After downloading this torrent install Adobe Acrobat XI Pro as TRIAL version
2. Open Adobe Acrobat XI Pro for a while then close it.
3. Go to C:Windows-System32-drivers-etc then copy hosts to the DESKTOP then open it with notepad and add these lines:
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com
then SAVE.. after that CUT the new hosts and replace it with the one in the drivers-etc..
4. Go to C:Program Files-AdobeAcrobat 11.0-Acrobat and rename the amtlkib.dll to amtlkib.old
5. copy the 'cracked' amtlkib.dll to the location
6. OMG ITS WORKING!! -___- "

,Zlif,2012-10-21T03:03Z,Where can I find the serial key for offline activation? Looked all over the adobe folders
,gadgetpal,2012-10-21T10:01Z,"My solution dated 2012-10-19 05:47 CET works, and I found a simpler route. Tested it on my window 8 today and fully working.

a) Go to official Adobe website and click download trial of Acrobat XI. It will ask you to download and install Adobe Download assistant.
b) Run the download assistant, select Acrobat XI Pro, sign in with your Adobe ID. If you don't have one, create an Adobe ID now. Download the official trial version and the speed of download will be faster than this torrent
c) Install the official trial version and select trial version during installation. Launch and it will gives you 30 days trial message when you try to  edit the PDF File. Close Acrobat
d) Download this torrent and only the file amtlkib.dll. You select and  exclude all other files from download so the download will only take a few second. Scan it for virus
e) Go to C:Program Files (x86)AdobeAcrobat 11.0Acrobat and rename the amtlkib.dll to amtlkib.old to keep the original safe
g) copy the 'cracked' amtlkib.dll to the location
h) Restart Acrobat...voila

Please try and see if it works for you."

I used the cracked amtlkib.dll then advanced my clock beyond 30 days and ""voila"" it stopped working. Acrobat wont even open until I restore the original amtlkib.dll. But by then the 30 day trial period message comes up and you are screwed.

So don't try that method."

GOT THIS TORRENT, DISCONNECTED FROM INTERNET, DOUBLE CLICKED SETUP.EXE, INSTALLED TRIAL, LAUNCHED TRIAL AND ACTUALLY OPENED A .PDF, CLOSED .PDF THEN CLOSED ACROBAT.

RENAMED amtlkib.dll TO amtlkib.old, COPIED CRACK TO THE INSTALLATION FOLDER, THEN, LAUNCHED ACROBAT - NO PROBLEMS.

DON'T FORGET TO TURN OFF THE AUTOMATIC UPDATE FEATURE ( Edit -> Prefrences -> Updater, then select ""Do not download or install updates automatically"")

HOPE THIS HELPS!"
