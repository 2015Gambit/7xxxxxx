If you don't know the names Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, you certainly know their songs -- Leiber and Stoller were one of the first great songwriting teams of the rock & roll era, writing hit songs for the Coasters, the Drifters, Elvis Presley, Dion, Ben E. King, and many, many more. Smokey Joe's Cafe: The Songs of Leiber and Stoller is a Tony-nominated Broadway musical revue built around such classic rock and R&B tunes as "Ruby Baby," "Kansas City," "Hound Dog," "Spanish Harlem," "There Goes My Baby," "Yakety Yak," "Jailhouse Rock," and over two dozen more.
