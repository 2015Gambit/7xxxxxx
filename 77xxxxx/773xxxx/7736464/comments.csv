,johnny614,2012-10-20T16:09Z,"I could really use some help. :( I've tried many, many times to install it, in a variety of ways, and each time, the main executable, doom3bfg.exe, will not open properly, AT ALL. To even get it to run, I have to use a variety of compatibility settings, and then, when it does run, each, and every time, I get an error on the launcher, this is the error I get:
""------ Initializing File System ------

...shutting down QGL""
Theres more to it, but I figured that was the main focus. I'll post the rest anyway to see if anyone is getting a similar error.
