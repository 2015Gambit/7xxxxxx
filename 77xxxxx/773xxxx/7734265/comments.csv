,Charlie117,2012-10-17T03:17Z,"This game is great!
Buy if possible."
,afillip,2012-10-17T06:06Z,Idk what could be happening but after doing the manual installation te game keeps opening steam and going to the page of MotN and then asks for age confirmation as if it's not installed. :/
,afillip,2012-10-17T06:10Z,"Manual installation does not give me results, game does not initiates."
,ramrod911,2012-10-17T08:53Z,the game installs fine but then it keeps telling me my save file is corrupt and when i click start game it crashes to desktop after like 2 seconds of cutscene
,barr91,2012-10-17T17:50Z,Saved games do not work properly as they are 'corrupted' after a program exit and re-open. The files did however help me not have to DL it all again for a clean install (also no corrupt save problem).
,chowley,2012-10-17T22:04Z,Terrible install instructions. Absolutely no clarity. I have the save game corruption issue. Hesitant to reinstall in case it just happens again. 
,chowley,2012-10-18T02:26Z,"To fix the corrupted save:

go to 
http://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_mark_of_the_ninja.shtml

and download, that sorted out my problem anyway. Hope it helps others.

,Gfunk839,2012-10-18T13:57Z,So is this working or not? Busy DL'ing but my interwebs is very slow??
,ramrod911,2012-10-19T03:10Z,Could you please re-release this game with the new patch included??? or could you just release the patch as standalone??? The games crashes for me because of my old GFX card. This was resolved in the new patch. Please help.
