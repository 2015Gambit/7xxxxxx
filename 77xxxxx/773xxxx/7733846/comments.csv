[V],gnv65,2012-10-17T04:54Z,"Hi SectorVector, 
I have saved you about $200!
So now how about going for that scanner?"
,SectorVector,2012-10-17T09:08Z,"In that case, i would spend the money on a printed copy or some other good book ! Lets see. In time maybe."

,SectorVector,2012-10-18T15:07Z,"Thanks dynstab. Noticed your comment rather late. Will get that (too). Good to see you back. :)

(Aside: I wish those yellow ballons indicating comments, show up in a different colour if there is a 'newer' comment. Am going to try putting it up as a suggestion.)"
