[V],twentyforty,2012-10-18T18:03Z,"@param436: I didn't planned doing it, but ... OK, soon.

@nooguy: Only last season survived (my torrent on SU). I do not have sources anymore and as many long-lived BBC shows HDTV even wasn't here before season four of Hustle. So, one day, maybe - but earliest season can be 4. Earlier seasons get as DVDrip."
,param436,2012-10-18T20:31Z,then il wait for u to upload it. thanks
,nooguy,2012-10-19T04:23Z,"@ twentyforty: doesn't have to be hdtv, a dvdrip collection in your signature small size would be perfect.found this link :

,nooguy,2012-10-19T04:36Z,"gee...sorry for the double comment,guess the site takes some time to show recent ones "
[V],twentyforty,2012-10-19T07:45Z,"Source for DVDrip is - DVD. It must be retail DVD9.
Source for DVDrip cannot be DVDrip. I have found sources for seasons 4 to 7, 8 is alive (my torrent) but the rest...."
