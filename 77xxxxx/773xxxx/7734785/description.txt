I recently discovered how to download tv shows and movies from project free tv and me and my friends have been watching this show laughing our asses off and not many people have been uploading episodes. so until this season ends i will upload all episodes a few days after they air.

video format is .mp4 so it works on ps3 and i believe smartphones aswell

if you want to download any shows or movies from project free tv get mozilla firefox and get the add on called flashgot

this file is high definition

i will upload as much as i possibly can but i count on others to help as well. On average I upload 1.2mb/s with enough peers I've seen it hit 2mb/s


Enjoy! =)
