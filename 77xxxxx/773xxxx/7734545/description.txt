Version 1.03 EditCompatibility Changes: 

ΓûáOlder laptops experiencing "overly pixelated" or distorted images should now function 
ΓûáMacBooks with ATI X1600 video cards will potentially function both in fullscreen and windowed. I do not have access to a MacBook with that video card, so if you're experiencing that problem please update me! 
ΓûáMac OS X version now implements Left-Ctrl+Left-Click to be equivalent to Right-Click 
Fullscreen Changes: 

ΓûáFullscreen stretch now works differently and should be more effective at properly "stretching" to fill your screen 
ΓûáMonitors that support 2560x1440 should be properly scaling and look much better (I'm jealous) 
ΓûáMonitors with resolutions less than 1280x720 may now function in Fullscreen Stretched depending on your OpenGL support 
ΓûáA more elaborate manual mode is available for tweaking your desired resolution effect within settings.ini 
Additional Video Settings: 

ΓûáV-Sync can be activated within options mode. Depending on your system, you still might need to force it on or off from your video card control panel as well. 
ΓûáFrame limiting is also available from the options. Between the two (V-Sync vs. Frame Limiting), pick the one that works best for you to balance performance and cpu use. 
Additional Game Settings: 

ΓûáWithin options you can enable paths to be drawn when hovering over a beacon. 
ΓûáDialog keys will now have a brief delay before they are active, this can be disabled within the options.
