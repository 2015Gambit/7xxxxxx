,nomisqc,2012-11-03T20:12Z,Anyone know why there isn' a NTSC version of this game available ? Does the PAL version work fine on US Wiis ? Would your character still work if you go over to a friend with a NTSC version of the game ?
,Jimdawg22,2012-11-05T02:23Z,"Finally got it to work. Fixed USB detection problem. 

1) Watch this Youtube video in order to get all the wads and cios that you need. If you follow this video and do what dude says it will work.


2)Launch in Wii Flow and in settings select video: force with NTSC"
