Knut Hamsun was without question one of the greatest writers of the past century. In his day he was universally praised. When Hamsun won the Nobel Prize for literature, Thomas Mann remarked that ΓÇ£never has the Nobel Prize been awarded to one so worthy of it.ΓÇ¥  Henry Miller called Hamsun ΓÇ£the Dickens of my generation,ΓÇ¥ and Charles Bukowski called him "the worldΓÇÖs greatest writer." Isaac Bashevis Singer wrote with respect to Hamsun's novel "Hunger" that ΓÇ£all modern literature of this century finds its source here.ΓÇ¥

It is impossible to understand the 20th century novel without reading Knut Hamsun. But Hamsun's work has been studiously ignored by the literary world ever since World War II, for Hamsun was an enemy of the modern world, an enemy of deracinated cosmopolitan hedonism - and hence an enemy of the literary establishment.  The establishment, intolerant of opposition, did its best to stifle his work, demonstrating yet again that the modern cultural movement which now goes under the name liberalism is far more illiberal than any "authoritarianism" which preceded it.
