,nikolajo,2012-10-19T16:10Z,"Anyone found a fix for the chapter 2 ""floor bug"" ?"
,WuHaPe,2012-10-19T19:55Z,"For all who have floor-bug (i was thinking and thinking and got solve of this problem):

1. Go to Options and set all to lower settings as possible (resolution 640, details LOW, and game in the window - not Fullscreen)
2. Exit the game
3. Start the game (it should work at the window)
4. Load Chapter 1 (Not Chapter 2 or Autosave)
5. Go again through the map
6. Skip all movies
7. You should start Chapter 2 ON the floor, not IN ;]
8. Now You can back to Your own settings

Cheers!"
,aldrinzordic,2012-10-20T06:48Z,"WuHaPe your solution did'nt work for me. before i tot this only on my computer but when did this happen i already search about this in website and i found out that its not only me who having this kind of bug.

meaning to say that this bug is in the game so we need to wait for bug fix to play this game normally."
,aldrinzordic,2012-10-20T06:53Z,"HuWaPe your suggestion, not didnt work for me"
,WuHaPe,2012-10-20T12:24Z,"ehh dude...You can't write properly nickname, so I guess You don't get the things right. Try again or look on the SKIDROW site - people tell that this solve the problem"

,KevbuscusStyg,2012-10-21T02:09Z,My game works fine but It doesn't save.. It says unable to save and I can't continue where I left off. Is there a fix for this?
,aldrinzordic,2012-10-21T09:49Z,huwape or wuhape watever the matter is the solution you give is not helping. if you say's that was the fixing stuff that you talking about then post a link here  so everyones properly follow or what website is that. and i will also look if that is probably solve like you said. because it isnt working on me
,rasostar,2012-10-22T21:35Z,"WuHaPe, I also tried, exactly, what you said. No luck. I also ran around the carpet and, after some time, I fell on the library... I believe it's not possible to complete ""Smoking Kills"" (Chapter 2) via library. I trust it should start on the bedroom, no?"

,crazyedex,2012-10-30T14:28Z,I can't seem to create profile. The game loads up and I see 3 new profile slots and when I click on them and press create nothing happens. I'm stuck there.
,brot,2012-10-30T15:02Z,"---------SPOILERS-------

I'm on chapter 13 and i'm in the bathroom with Susan. The problem is that I can't move the iron closer to me (by other words, i can't press Mouse key 2 to bring it closer). 

I remember before, when I was stuck in the cage near the garage, that i was able to use the ability. But when i'm on this particular chapter it doesn't seem to work at all.
Could this be a bug for me, or is anyone else out there also having this problem?"
,Lillita,2012-10-31T00:56Z,"Spoilers------------


Hey, I'm on Chapter 13 and I'm stuck. I broke the washer and talked to the maid, turned the cross and found the hole. But the maid just keeps walking around the house. She eventually gets to the bathroom but then just walks around for a minute and leaves to walk around the house again. I tried watching through the hole when she goes in, tried standing in the hall, I even tried closing the door behind her but nothing works, its very frustrating please help"
,KoaLARP,2012-11-01T20:32Z,did not like it.game looks like shite.thx anyway...guess it was just not for me..
,iTHEIF,2012-11-03T13:16Z,"Game is terrible all around. Very generic, cheesy as hell, graphics suck (looks like early 2000)... save your time."
,AdrianoFerroTPBPA,2012-11-03T15:08Z,So i hope it works and i like this game so much so guys if you want plz seed and then i am gonna seed too :)
,Kamidesu,2012-11-04T00:36Z,"for some reason when I start the game up the main menu is flickering and 90% percent gone, I can't see anything except half of the border at the top. if anyone knows what I'm talking about please help"
,blaymoric,2012-11-04T05:58Z,"@iTHEIF
A) Stop being a Graphics whore
B) Get a Taste in games
C) Stop being a fucking Graphics whore.
Really? 2000? Chances are you were barely old enough to hold a Controller in 2000. Google ""Majora's mask"" and take a good, Hard look. Now Google ""Lucius game play"" and take another good, hard look. If you tell me that it still looks like it's from 2000, you are a Troll and a very Bad Liar. Take some lessions from M'aiq, he can teach you a few things."
,ChellUsesDell,2012-11-04T12:38Z,"Great torrent, +3 internets to Blair"
,ChellUsesDell,2012-11-04T12:39Z,"*Blay, -1 selfinternets for typos"
,blaymoric,2012-11-04T23:30Z,*Chell -600 for implying I give a fuck.
,ItchyLala,2012-11-08T14:18Z,"Thanks. Works fine with the update.


@Blay, Chell was agreeing with your comment and deducted points from himself for his own typo.

-600 for misreading."
,filip989,2012-11-08T18:33Z,"What, no crack needed for this?"
,Sivos,2012-11-09T09:46Z,"@iTHEIF

Who gives two shits about graphics anyway?  That's only a bonus to a game, not the reason you should play it.  Grow up some, kid, then try it again."
,salemxr,2012-11-11T01:11Z,"this game is way i don't like buying games before i get a chance to play a couple of lvls  its the most boring thing iv ever played even though ign and all of them gave it great reviews im starting to think thy payed them people off, and to fix the floor bug do every thing that guy said but restart at the very beginning "
,Aaronblue22,2012-11-11T17:20Z,"I really wanted to try this game out but it says im missing a file "" XINPUT_3.dll"" PLz get back to me asap "
,Natalie.w,2012-11-13T18:15Z,"@iTHEIF's comment describes what the gaming world is coming to now. The only thing everyone seem to care about is graphics. This is tragic really. There are only a couple of important things when it comes to a game. And those are the gameplay and the storyline. Just search for the history of gaming in google and as blaymoric said take a good, hard look. Learn about what gaming was like before all these graphics whores messed up the whole culture. There was no GUI at all, and still all those games were way, WAY better than what these graphics whores have to offer now. They are not even remotely comparable. It's because of stupid people like you gaming industry is going south.
If you don't wanna take your hand out your pants to search and read, atleast let others take their own god damn decision and do so.
Troll be gone."
,Pranavjain,2012-11-13T19:06Z,"For me , when i start the game , the video comes! 
But then it suddenly goes blank and the game doesnt start. 
Someone plss help ASAP. "
,ZeBastian1,2012-11-24T15:54Z,Works great with update 1.01 - Also nice to see some special games nowadays by all the graphic whores
