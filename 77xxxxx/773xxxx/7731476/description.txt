This was ripped by myself from a Bluray. I tried to edit the track as best as possible.

I simply released this track since it's impossible to find on the internet.
I would have hoped that there would have been this single on the OST but unfortunately, there wasn't. Let's hope Mr. Phil Vassar will release this single on his next album. Until then, here's a copy that was edited as best as possible.

Encoded in MP3 @ 320
Edited using Adobe Audition

All credit goes to the artist Phil Vassar.
This song is a beautiful single which has touched many lives.
