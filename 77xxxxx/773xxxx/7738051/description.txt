These are the 2-disc 2008 reissues of New Order's 5 albums with the now defunct Factory Records. These are the 2009 corrected versions, as the pressing from 2008 was loaded with mistakes due to Rhino Records' mishandling.

The albums are:

1981 - Movement
1983 - Power, Corruption, and Lies
1985 - Low-Life
1986 - Brotherhood
1989 - Technique

As always, please seed for the other people that want them (don't be greedy!), and enjoy. :)
