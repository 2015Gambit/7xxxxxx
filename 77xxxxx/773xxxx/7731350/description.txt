Esquire - November 2012 (USA)

Esquire USA magazine is the discerning man's lifestyle magazine. Addressing the entertainment requirements and values of the modern man with wit and sophistication, Esquire is a magazine with cut and thrust, and none of the tackiness and banality of many women's lifestyle magazines. Very chunky and printed on high quality paper, Esquire magazine is a complete stylish package for every man with brains, taste, and a good sense of irony.
