,tflagger997,2012-10-16T18:44Z,"Because Kripke wrote the first two eps. to get us hooked, and then took off to JJ's yacht to party.  Since the second ep. is has slid downhill significantly and it is hurting in the ratings.  Hopefully Kripke will come back since only the first 6 are written (well finalized anyway).

devasko - WTF are you doing here if you are not watching?  Come out of the closet and bring Tom with you."
