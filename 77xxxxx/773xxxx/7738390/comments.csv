[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-18T20:52Z,"Hey Winterimage. I don't have that one presently. I don't tend to collect anything that looks (or reads) even a little bit like a superhero book. I've got a few here and there, but not many.

Also, comic book db says one issue on Night Wynd, and then issues 1-4 on Malibu. I added them to the search list. "
,Winterimage,2012-10-19T04:11Z,"As far as I know there are two separate comics called Foxfire. The Malibu one seems to be an ordinary superhero comic.

The other one, the one I'm looking for, is more of a fantasy-themed tale, black-and-white and quite simply drawn. I'm pretty sure all the parts were published by Night Wynd.

Here's a link to cover art: http://d1466nnw0ex81e.cloudfront.net/iss/300w/994/289941/6039991_1.jpg"
,Winterimage,2012-10-19T04:28Z,"Thanks! But as far as I know there are two separate comics called Foxfire. The Malibu one seems to be an ordinary superhero comic. I'm not looking for that one.

The one I'm interested in has more of a fantasy theme, was drawn in black-and-white, and all issues (3 or 4) were published by Night Wynd.

I tried to post a cover art link, but that comment vanished. Maybe TPB doesn't approve of links in comments."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-19T05:46Z,"OK, cool. Comic Book DB is regularly lacking, but it's a good place to start. Since you're only looking for the Night Wynd run I'll definitely keep an eye out for it. Sounds like something I should check out, anyway.

I can see the link. I'm pretty sure that's a Barry Blair cover. Looks A LOT like one if it's not."
,Winterimage,2012-10-19T05:57Z,"I can't remember if Barry Blair drew the comic, but I think he was involved in the publisher Night Wynd.

Speaking of Mr Blair, you don't happen to have the Elflord comics or some of the spin-offs?"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-19T07:37Z,"Yes, definitely have Elflord and some of the spin-offs on the list of things to upload. : )"
,RayFord,2012-10-19T18:20Z,"Thank you so much for your consistent, tireless and amazing work! I got this account just to thank you and make a request: Peter Milligan's The Enigma, Ted McKeever's Metropol, Miracle Man #8 + the post-Moore issues and Scarab by John Smith. If possible in the future, these would be appreciated. And thank you again and live long and prosper!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-20T01:10Z,"Hey RayFord, you're most welcome. And thank you very much for the kind words.

Enigma, check. I actually thought that was already available, which is why I didn't post it with the last round of Milligan stuff. But yeah, I can do that one. 

brodahisou has Metropol right here...

...and most of his torrents still work. If that one doesn't work, I can re-up it for you.

Scarab, check. Got that one.

Yeah, Miracleman, I'm torn on that one. I do have issues 1-24, plus the unpublished issue 25 pages, plus the 1984 Marvelman Summer Special. However, most, if not all of that stuff is already posted in one of three existing torrents. There is two Miracleman torrents...

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4859450/Neil_Gaiman_s_Miracleman_(Complete)

And the Alan Moore Collection...

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4758782/Alan_Moore_Collection

In general, I try very hard not to double-up on existing, still seeded torrents. It kind of makes a mess of things, but it also keep me from stepping on other uploader's metaphorical toes. I'll have to stew on that one."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-20T05:52Z,"Oi! brodahisou has Scarab, too...

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4823831/Scarab_(Vertigo)

...please check and see if that's still working before I upload again. "
,RayFord,2012-10-20T16:24Z,"Spock, the kind words are nothing in comparison to the work you put into your torrents. The Miracleman torrent you pointed out is missing #8, but it does have the Neil Gaiman stuff. The problem with Metropol and Scarab is no seeders (1 at most) so they would not download. Brodahisou is a great uploader and I respect your integrity, but no seeders still means no seeders. Thank you! You give every other uploader a run for their money!"
