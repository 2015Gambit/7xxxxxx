,XtraZoom,2012-11-02T08:50Z,Btw anyone using this version gets a pop from Hagel that says you are using pirated software? Along with my vpn ip. I thought its fully cracked
,MrCabana,2012-11-04T16:49Z,@ XtraZoom I had that one too just this morning :(
,MrCabana,2012-11-06T19:22Z,No working crack yet?

Seems to be working for me!"
,XtraZoom,2012-11-12T12:13Z,"MrCabana, I am no longer using this version, I have been using the 6.03 dl from some foreign lang site probably russian. It uses a patch/crack named dum5.0x_patch

Google it or use Filestube to look for latest DU Meter

Just installed 6.05 also seems to be same patch/crack. Normal I prefer fixed exe to a crack but so far after using 6.03 for several days there is no issues and no annoying pirated software popup."
,h4hammad,2012-11-22T22:47Z,"@XtraZoom your given file ""dum5.0x_patch"" is contain virus dude."
,XtraZoom,2012-11-23T14:35Z,"h4hammad, KIS2013 never warn me about any virus however Malwarebytes Anti Malware did warn me. I have no issues using it. I don't see any virus/trojans popup after using it. However I cannot guarantee it is virus free only that I don't have issues using it. Might be false positives or might not. Most patches will show up as virus/trojans which is why I normally use fixed exe but this current fixed exe have piracy popups."
