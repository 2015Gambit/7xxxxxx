I could post a synopsis, reviews, or any number of blurbs, but I think all of them take away from the real/unreal ('quasi-autobiographical meditation on fantasy and reality' says one of the reviews) style of this book. It's a solid story with a very unique style or art/coloring, check it out if it looks like your kind of read. 

Also by Peter Kuper, but not at all like this book...
