Choose the language and the version you want for installation, it does not need any Serial nor crack.  
  
Important : I suggest you choose Windows 7 Ultimate because it's where I inserted all drivers possible and a few programs.

No unsigned drivers were forced into setup. 'Vista' and 'Win8' drivers were removed from the driverspacks. Only 'Win7' and 'Win XP or above' drivers were kept
