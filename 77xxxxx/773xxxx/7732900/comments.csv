,quinnsearle,2012-10-26T09:47Z,"Having issues, firstly I had to disable my anti virus to get the game to start, fine figured it out, now all I can do is sign into the social club as ""default"", if I  try to create an account it only gets as far as creating my account info and then tells me to check my internet connection and won't go any further.. If is stay logged into the defualt profile, I exit the social club and I'm left with the Max Payne title screen and message that says I need to be connected to the internet and logged into the social club to initialize the game, help??"
