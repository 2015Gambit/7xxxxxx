,ben7530,2012-10-18T18:40Z,"@nosTEAM:

Thanks!

Does this cumulative version work on Windows 8? 

If not, can you tell us why? Or give us somewhere to look? Anything? 

I am willing to do some hex editing for the first time in 20 years if that's what it takes!

(For everyone else: YES, it's a crack issue, NOT a driver issue: Owners of Legit copies can play BL2 on Win8!)"

I suppose is not working because is used S K D I R O W  crack"
,MLO89,2012-10-18T21:42Z,"Is this the same as ""Update 5""? The numbering schemes different people are using is kind of confusing. For example Sicheats is using the number ""v1.0.16.20091"" for the latest update trainer and skidrow is apparently using the name ""Update 5"" for the latest patch."
,Next_Gen_1987,2012-10-18T23:39Z,"It also includes ''Season Pass DLC'' ??

Thanks."
,MLO89,2012-10-18T23:40Z,"I'll answer my own question. If anyone gives a shit, yes version 1.1.2 is the same as Update 5."
,Next_Gen_1987,2012-10-18T23:41Z,This includes ''Season Pass DLC'' ??
,101rjb,2012-10-19T00:42Z,could you guys upload batman arkham city

,remotehugger2,2012-10-19T23:20Z,ok - so i have the skidrow release with the 3dm crack - do i just install this and go ?
,walrus-commando,2012-10-20T05:35Z,does anyone know how to fix the LAN? I could use built in LAN for 1.1.0 but since 1.1.1 I can't get Tunngle or Evolve to work. Exhausted almost every possibility.
,Skullsquisher,2012-10-22T01:49Z,"How do I use the Scarlet dlc on a legit steam game?
Ive tried a few but it doesnt seem to hold.
 Steam updates my files.
I Support the creaters but think dlcs are bad practice."
,gratefullydrunk,2012-10-22T19:33Z,"Will this work with the original repack i've been using flawlessly since release? 

Here's a link so you know which version i'm talking about.
