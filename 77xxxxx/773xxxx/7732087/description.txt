Hello potential DnD players!

Included are some virtual tabletop programs which include eTools (character generator and character viewer with numerous rulebook add-ons) and Fantasy Grounds II, a virtual tabletop that is extremely powerful. After my group migrated from table to virtual tables, we couldn't imagine ever going back to the old stuff. 

Further, I've included a few basic books. New players should view the player's guide first in the torrent. It is found under the books folder.

To install eTools, install the full program first. The others should be installed in accordance to the DM's rules. If I am the DM, shoot me a text and I'll tell you.

Fantasy Grounds II:   This one will be a bit odd.
	              Go to the RegKey folder.
	              R-Click on the appropriate FGII.reg and edit it.
	              Change the License Key to whatever you want it to be, adhering 
                        to the format provided. (i.e. replace all the 
		        x's but keep the dashes every fifth letter)
