,saffronsghost,2012-10-18T11:13Z,"Also, you people are terrible seeds, my god."
,Strajow,2012-10-18T11:30Z,@Melo22 you know this is the Aust vs Uk season right? episode 4 aired last week on the 10th of October. 
,dagsbouch,2012-10-18T11:46Z,"There is not one seeder, it says 19 but i got none for christ sake people seed "
,dagsbouch,2012-10-18T12:46Z,"Well someone listened cause i got it all, so thank you, so i'm going to bed and i will seed all night, thank you again."
,Melo22,2012-10-18T17:03Z,@ Strajow thats kinda odd. Because I've seen a couple of torrents named E05 from last week. But thanks for clearing everything up. Time to download! Cheers
,Strajow,2012-10-18T23:16Z,@Melo22 I think you may have this mixed up with the American series as they aired their 5th episode last friday. Kindly delete your comment and think before you make false comments about torrents in the future.

I'll try and delete this comment. So, if you're reading this, maybe you can't :)"
