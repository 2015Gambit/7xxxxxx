Native Instruments Reflektor IR Library 

REFLEKTOR represents the pinnacle of digital signal processing ΓÇô a definitive 
convolution reverb based on the groundbreaking Zero Latency Convolution 
technology developed by Native Instruments. This high-performance effect 
provides reverb ranging from super-realistic physical rooms to fully virtual 
acoustics, offering in-depth modeling parameters for creating unique spaces. 
It can perfectly emulate the sound of high-end, expensive digital reverb units 
and includes specially designed content for creative sound design. 
Combined with some highly usable and musical innovations such as the Sync 
and Reverse feature, this is the ultimate reverb for every production need, 
from classic to creative.
