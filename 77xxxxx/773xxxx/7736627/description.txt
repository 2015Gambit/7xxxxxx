India Today  - 22 October 2012
English | PDF | 147 pages | 56 mb

This is the digital edition of the weekly magazine. It focusses on Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra and his real-estate corruption. It also includes 2 supplements - Simply Mumbai & Simply Gujarati. I have edited the PDF to remove over 50 pages of ads thereby reducing the file size.
