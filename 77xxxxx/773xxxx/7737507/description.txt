The Number Ones was a compilation album of hits by The Beatles released in 1983 by EMI on the Parlophone Records label in Australia (PLAY1024).   It is an alternate version of the album titled 20 Greatest Hits in most of the world. Due to timing problems, EMI included a three-track bonus EP (A-980), with the 20-track LP. The cassette version contains all 23 tracks as cassettes do not have the length limitations which LPs have. The album spent one week at the top of the Australian album charts in 1983.
