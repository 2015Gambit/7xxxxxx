Description:

The Many Faces of Benny Hinn:

For many years, the folks at the Trinity Foundation (publishers of The Door Magazine) have picked up the debris of wrecked lives of people who have been financially, emotionally, and spiritually abused by televangelists. Atop their list of abusers during the past few decades has been faith healer Benny Hinn.

This Dallas-based watchdog group has worked with news organizations to expose the corruption of various television ministers, including Hinn. Many of these investigative reports on Hinn ΓÇö spearheaded by the Trinity Foundation ΓÇö make up the bulk of this DVD set. They show Hinn at his worst, including his power-wielding control, opulent lifestyle, bogus healings, lies and deception, heretical theology, and much more. A single report should make anyone question the integrity of this man; viewing several hours of investigations should leave no doubt. The presentation also includes segments from HinnΓÇÖs broadcasts that have not been shown in news reports. These include his stage antics, absurd theological statements, and false prophecies.

This is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.


JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
