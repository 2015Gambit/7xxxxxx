,UFOslava,2012-10-19T09:05Z,"Was somebody able to play it? VLC and WMP cant play this .wmv file, and suggesting to download some new shitplayer spam shit of some sort... i suspect a bogus torrent..."
,TAM70,2012-10-20T21:36Z,"wtf is wrong with you and nupper, dvd and hd is a totally different section, is it to get the yellow skull you put 720?? this suck..."
,legio9,2012-10-21T21:41Z,"Ultradye35: Fucking RETARD!

ITS A CAM, A SHITTY CAM TOO..not a ""high definition""

LEARN to 1) upload decent material 2) READ

V= 1
A= 1"
,Shadow416,2012-10-22T00:35Z,how does a camera capture a 3D movie in theaters that requires 3D glasses?....cmon use your brain seeders...its a stupid upload that shouldn't even be at the top of the list.
,zeldaxlove64,2012-10-24T06:33Z,CAM =/= 720p or highres
,averagehuman,2012-10-28T09:54Z,"High resolution CAM is a contradiction in terms. 

The file may well be x720, and the resolution of the camera used may have been x720, but a cam only captures a few pixels, and very poorly at that.

So in reality this isn't 720p and shouldn't be posted in the high-res section."
,zeldaxlove64,2012-10-28T20:46Z,CAM cannot never be high res.
,nairobi19,2012-10-30T16:57Z,piece of shit
,Nihil88,2012-11-03T22:16Z,I don't understand what kind of person would watch these in the first place. Is saving 10 bucks or whatever really THAT preferable to godawful quality?
,Forgoth,2012-11-05T00:15Z,"just a FYI guys,the dvd release for Dredd is around 20-30 of December,so we can only expect a good quality upload by then."
,psimon,2012-11-05T17:47Z,720p CAM are you kidding?!
,Darkhyron,2012-11-13T13:17Z,why ypu fucking people keep download this? why the moderators delete this shit? why this funcking guy recorder this crap? some many questions with no answer
,Zanteater,2012-11-21T04:53Z,"-------------------RETARDS ABOVE--------------

A note to everyone above this line:

The title of this torrent says CAM.

You are fucking retards for reading that and coming in here bitching about how ITS A FUCKING CAM.

Do a better job yourselves, or shut the fuck up and deal with it nerds.

I want to see all of your HD cams that trump the DVD releases."
,007pirate2012,2012-11-21T06:49Z,Anyone have any idea when a better copy of this will be available?
,aiigghht,2012-11-23T07:30Z,"Fuck these pieces of shit off.

I don't even want this movie but you must be a complete fuckwit to post this in high res. Take cams to the fucking hand held or shit res section you stupid cunt.

inb4 some idiot replies to me thinking I'm ever gunna read this again or that I give a fuck."
