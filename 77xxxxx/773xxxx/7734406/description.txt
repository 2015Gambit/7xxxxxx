Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

CHIVALRY: Medieval Warfare is a first-person slasher with a focus on
multi-player. Featuring competitive online combat that seeks to capture the
experience of truly being on a medieval battlefield. We've drawn our
inspiration from the intensity and epicness of swordfighting movies such as
300, Gladiator and Braveheart and we want to bring that experience to the
hands of a gamer.

The game is skill-based and controls like a FPS, but instead of guns and
grenades, players are given swords, shields, maces, battleaxes and longbows.
Set in a fictional yet gritty and realistic world, players will fight in fast
paced online battles besieging castles, raiding medieval villages and fighting
for glory in the arena with up to 32 players.

* Deep melee combat system provides players with a huge range of responsive
  combat options
* Adjust your attacks and blocks in real time with the mouse for precise and
  full control of the action
* Wield an arsenal of up to 60 brutal weapons ranging from broad swords and
  battle axes to longbows and javelins
* Dynamic objective system brings team tactics and strategy to the forefront
  as players batter down gates, raid villages and assassinate enemy royalty to
  achieve victory.
* Use a variety of siege weapons ranging from catapults, boiling oil,
  ballista, battering rams and more
* Vast, lush environments that transport the player to a gritty and immersive
  medieval world. 
* Offline play options that allow players to gain familiarity with the
  controls and gameplay before being thrust into the action.
