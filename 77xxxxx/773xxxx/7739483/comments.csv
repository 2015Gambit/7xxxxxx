Provided that enough people stick around and keep seeding, i intend to keep provided dual audio Mp4 High Quality low file size rips.

While i'm not ""quite"" as small a file size as perhaps a popular encoder such as yify, then again yify's currently do not provide 5.1 and it's argueable about which has a better image quality, blind tests usually point to me, but then again i do use a higher bitrate which also adds to the file size in the end. Still i think any movie that is 1080p with dual audio sitting around the 2gb mark is more than reasonable, any further compression regardless of how much tweaking is done is still going to introduce artifacts, i try to give a movie some extra ""room to breath"" for this purpose. The result is a very very happy balance of size vs quality.

I just hope people are happy with the results enough to give me further encouragement to keep doing this.

Soon as x265 codec is standardized and widely available.. which may be another 2 years.. i'm sure we could make 1080p movies in around the 1.2gb range at about the same quality. Until then... my current bitrate is a fair balance.

Enjoy ;)"
