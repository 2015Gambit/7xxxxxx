*anyone know if this has a Win8 compatible crack*?

Come on release groups: Win8 is officially out now. Time to stop ignoring it..."
,brianxxx,2012-10-17T18:28Z,"@ben
Just make a backup copy of your entire Borderlands 2 install folder, install this update and DLC and see if it works. If so, then report back here and help others.

If it does not, revert back to backup folder that was working."
,darkgamerX,2012-10-17T18:48Z,ben7530 agreed. a lot of ppl are going to be disappointed when they upgrade to windows 8 and find out BL2/transformers FOC wont start. overall windows 8 is more stable and easier on resources than 7. idk why its so hated. BL2 and FOC are the only 2 skidrow games that dont work on 8 64bit for me so far
,OmniNegro,2012-10-17T19:52Z,"If Windows 8 is so good, why is everyone using Windows 7 and XP? The answer is money. Your OS like everything else costs money and people are more willing to pay for an OS they already know and trust than to mess with all the risky cracks in the world.

For the people who do not play games, Windows XP still works perfectly and I dare say it is even more lean than Windows 8 could pretend to be. (Be aware, I have not used Windows 8 at all.)

For gamers, Windows 8 is not yet ready but not for the reasons you probably expect. The drivers made from third parties are frankly better for Windows 7 than any other version with regards to stability and performance in games.

The only thing that pushed me over to Windows 7 over XP is that MS pretends DX 10 and up cannot run on Windows XP. 

We know this is a bold lie since Halo 2 had a fixed DLL that allowed DX10 to work in Windows XP despite MS saying that it was physically impossible.

But in order to snare the next batch of gamers, I expect they will resurrect the same old lie with the same old trick. (All the more reason to favor games made supporting OpenGL like RAGE and any others. When Rage was released, both ATI/AMD and Nvidia claimed to support *ALL* OpenGL extensions. The game tried to use them and showed that this was a bold lie. 

Since then they have had to make improvements to the drivers to support most, but still not all the extensions they claim to support."

No... The 7 Drivers work fine on Win8. Additionally, owners of Legit copies have no issues.

No, I was not drunk. And I said I have never used Windows 8, so how am I to know that it is effectively 7 with a new GUI? (If the drivers for 7 work in 8, then 8 *IS* 7 with a new GUI.)

You may be in love with the new abomination from MS. I am not. Enjoy being a fanboy if you want to.

Windows 7 works for everything at current. YOU CANNOT SAY THE SAME FOR 8.

Read that line again if you are still in denial.

I do not hate 8. I simply do not trust new OSes from MS. Their track record for new OSes is pretty horrible. In time it may be great. But I do not think that time is upon us yet."
,RafVne2,2012-10-18T20:44Z,"@Omninegro
I agree with you on the Microsoft's bullshit.
I too hate how they have force fed Win 7 on the gamer community. I hate win 7, x64 at least, with it's constant ""something"". Get a patch, wait for one, run in the compatibility mode, turn off... whatever. Tried win 8...hated it a bit less, mostly due to giving it some reasonable leeway for not being compatible with something,  But i hated it nevertheless, it's just too fucking ""secure"" for it's own good. It was constantly preventing you from changing something... I understand there is a need for some ppl to have a system that secure, but for the common folk? Come on... so you catch an occasional worm, yeah like I have something worth spying on.

Ad speaking about spyware, adware etc. he he he... I don't think there is a bigger supplier of those then MS themselves. Constantly collecting usage data, if you look close enough you'll find some bits and pieces of logs.... like when a program crashes and you click NO when asked if you want to send the crash data. One would think that is it, but it seems they are all stored and they are eventually being transmitted anyways.

i mean really, fresh windows install and right from the start there is several MS processes that are trying to access internet. I see no reason for that, unless I specify myself I want something to check, update etc.
The immediate internet accessing is actually quite typical behavior for adware or spyware.

In conclusion... I have uninstalled any  Virus protecting software, especially MS stuff, I only use commodo free firewall (good product BTW), and since then my system never run better! I run occasional Malwarebytes check, and that is enough for me...I have dual boot, but I rarely log onto win 7.
 Win XP pro is he most stable system, it took some time to ""better it"" and when it finally works quite well,they want to force it out, by cutting out support. And I say fuck'em.

(actually open source Op.systems are much more stable, unfortunately they don't work with games, and that IMO, is the reason why they are not the most popular systems around).

Sorry for my rant...

And before I forget what I was gonna say...

a simple Thank you to the uploader, and to the releasing group... Thanks guys for your time and effort."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-10-18T21:22Z,"windows 8 is trash and you're going to find tons of games that will not work on it. maybe later they'll fix this problem but im sticking to win 7 til they do...maybe even after too.

look at the fact that it's every other os they release that sucked.

xp = great
vista = trash
7 = great
8 = trash
9 = not out yet but im betting it'll be what windows 8 wants to be

my point being if you want to play these games then use windows 7 or something that you know it works on... and dont bitch when they dont work on win8, if you were fail enough to switch to that just cause it's newer... got news for ya, newer doesn't mean better!!!!

NUFF SAID!!!!"
,OmniNegro,2012-10-18T22:44Z,"The original Model T Ford had ~15 MPG going uphill, downhill, carrying a load, or empty. Newer cars that weigh a tenth as much average ~20 MPG. So newer does not mean better.

We can debate the merits and demerits of Windows 8 until the cows come home. It does not matter either way. Most games made now do *NOT* run on 8 without a patch or even several. 

And since we are on a Pirate site, we should take note that most cracks do not support 8 either. The few that do usually break compatibility with 7 and XP.

In another year I expect 8 will be supported by most games. But to my eyes, 8 is the new Windows ME. You are welcomed to disagree and live happily with 8."

If we can get a Win8 crack for v1.0, then surely some cracking group out there cares to make one for the new content!

And, it's obviously a very simple change that ONE user was able to make to the original borderlands 2 crack, so: 

Just publish what you did with that .exe or .dll on pastebin and we'll do it our goddamn selves if crackers ""can't be bothered"" with Win8!"

No harm is done. I do not want people to admire me. And by doing this, I can rest assured no-one will. I do not really care.

I do respect posters like the aforementioned one who was being insulted by my petty rival here. And I took it quite personally when the douche insulted him.

It is unlikely to continue, as the douche seems to have left. Good riddance. But just ignore us. We are the anonymous morons of the Internet. We do not matter to you unless you want us to.

Having a discussion, even if it is not directly related to the release, is not disrespectful towards the releaser. At least IMO.
Would you prefer see more of posts like...""SEED""..., or ""it's a virus""... he he he... I think not.
As I said before, I actually think that it is not a bad idea to discuss something on this site even though it is not game related. The reasoning is simple... if you go to a board... I don't know... ""Doorknobs admirers.org"", to discus pros and cons of your ""doorknob"",you'll either get the same tired arguments, or you get that one little pissant, that actually knows everything there is about ""doorknobs"", who instead of helping or advising, will try to ridicule you, because you don't know what the... ""something"" is (you know the type).  Now by posting same thing here, you might hear something new.
Besides, if S4A would mind, he'd ask.
@omninegro
dude... no harm done, I guess we all ""loose it"" from time to time.

Now on the subject of patch... I installed it with ""nosTEAM"" release of the game, and it seems to be working. Although I didn't play the actual levels yet, I did get some special fireworks granade, and new skin mod... so I guess it is working on XP x86. 
One more thing in regards to Win8 vs win7

Like a few of you said.  Win 8 is basically 7 with a different GUI and other things.  You can use Vista drivers on Win 7, and you guys don't complain about that.

The only con about Win 8 is the large difference in the GUI which will create a large learning curve.  I've been using RTM for about a month, and I'm already fluent enough that I have it installed on 6 of my computers.

The shortened boot time is good enough for the change.  I use to take nearly 1-2 minutes to boot, but I can boot in around 45 seconds on a 5 year old 7200RPM Sata 1.5 HDD.  Once you get use to Win 8 your work speed increases (in my case)

If you have not used Win 8 your comments about the OS has no meaning to anyone.  If you have then you have provided an opinion that someone might appreciate.

Go argue about Win 8 in a Win 8 Love/Hate forum, and stick to the topic.  Which in this case is Borderlands 2"

I used to think that too. I mean that win 8 is based on win 7, but I have heard/read, that it is actually based on Vista. I've never used vista so I can't tell, but even for the GPU drivers installer, I've noticed that it had aditional package to run an .MSI package, which suposedly is what vista had.
I'm not 100% sure, I actually wouldn't mind some confirmation from someone knowledgeable

I'm assuming you didn't forget to overwrite the files, after installation, and you're positive you meet the req's, right?
Sid you try to run an exe directly drom the win32 folder.
I should ask first, if the game run before the DLC patch...?
I know, I know, I know... he he he... You've rushed the instalation, and just skipped thru the option where it specifies place where it will be installed, and since your game install is in the custom location, it just created new folder and dumped the files there... make sure you it points to the game folder."

So I don't really know what else. the only other thing that comes to mind is AV is blocking the crack.
Sometimes I don't get it, I install something... it doesn't  work, I uninstall and reinstall without changing anything and it works I mean WTF,right? Most of the time it was AV just adding the file automatically to the restricted list. I remember I spent hours figuring this one out. I couldn't get that when I moved the folder, something worked, moved back in, and it stopped again... and since (i thought) i didn't have any AV installed i wasn't considering, but As I've learned, commodo, even if you specifically want to install firewall only, it still stick me with system monitoring, and even when I turned it off, it was still blocking it...
