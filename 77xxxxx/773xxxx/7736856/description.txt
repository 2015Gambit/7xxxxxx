    Truly one of the most unique moments of Elvis' life ever captured on tape. Apparently the tabloids printed a story about Elvis being a heroin addict , and Elvis took offense to the story in a BIG way. Usually a closing engagement show is a special thing , with a lot of celebrities in the crowd , a longer setlist, Elvis in a great mood, etc. Certainly there are some interesting song choices here, but the most interesting moments occur on disc 2 with the infamous "Drug Monologue". 
 
Enjoy!
