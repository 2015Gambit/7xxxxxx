,gkai,2012-10-18T20:01Z,"I canÂ´t start downloading too!!!
Why??"
,Toforto2,2012-10-18T20:29Z,I have no idea either....all the other trackers are fine and get about 80 seed and 100+ leech per tracker.But theres just 1 that gets Timed Out.Firewall is alllowing EVERYTHING possible for uTorrent to do.And because the 1 tracker times out i cant get a signal for downloading.The 4 bars arent green.Not even one of them......
,Toforto2,2012-10-18T20:31Z,"Just after i posted this.....i restarted my computer earlier and now i tried the torrent.Its downloading fine O.0......
It fixed itself i guess lol.
Thx for the episode CP and keep it up :D"
,Toforto2,2012-10-18T20:33Z,I guess i just had to reset my internet connection and i did it by restarting my PC.Its downloaded now :D
