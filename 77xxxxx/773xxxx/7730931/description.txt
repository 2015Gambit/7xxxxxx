This is original Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 VL installation from MSDN site. I also included Mini KMS activator in the archive.


Simply install the office with setup.exe and after the installation is done, run KMS activator as administrator (Left click -> run as administrator for W7).

Firstly you have to install KMS service and then press "Activation Office 2010 VL"

It should work flawless.
