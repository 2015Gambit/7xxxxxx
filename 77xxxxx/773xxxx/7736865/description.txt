Nazi Collaborators 
This series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. "How could they have done it?" How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. At the heart of this 13 part series lies one uneasy question. If you had faced what these people had faced, might you have done the same thing - and danced with the devil? 




6)  Vidkun Quisling 
Vidkun Quisling was leader of the Norwegian Fascist party Nasjional Samling - National Union - which he had founded in 1933 to counter Norwegian Communism. When the war broke out in September 1939 Quisling realised that Hitler's war plans needed Norway. He travelled to Berlin in December 1939 and met the Fuhrer. He did a deal - to take over as leader in Norway and stage a coup d'etat that would allow the Nazis to keep a military presence in Norway - he even gave the Germans military secrets on Norway's defence plans.In return, he believed Hitler would make him the "Norwegian Fuhrer". Quisling had betrayed his country and paved the way for the Nazi invasion of Norway in April 1940. Throughout the war, Quisling cruelly oppressed the people of Norway and urged them to fight for Nazi Germany. He even oversaw the execution of dissenters and collaborated in the deportation to Auschwitz of Norwegian Jews. As the war came to a close, this puppet leader became delusional. In the end, he was arrested and stood trial for his crimes. Today, "quisling" has become a synonym for traitor.
