,tbay007,2012-10-16T01:18Z,Thank you!  V10 A10!
,19Boothen72,2012-10-16T06:44Z,"@tbay007  You do realise that 10/10 for audio & video constitutes it being a perfect replication, don't you? With it not being on disc yet, the TV broadcast is the only reference for quality which by it's very nature should be 10/10.  So are you saying that this file is as good as the original broadcast?"
,neeliesu,2012-10-16T11:00Z,"Thank you.... @19boothen72, re your comment to @tbay007, are you saying that it's against The Pirate Bay rules to give your own opinion? I'm not currently in a location where I can watch the original broadcast, otherwise I wouldn't need to download it. I'm not being sarcastic, I know there are certain rules, but not having the option to watch the original my comments would be based on my opinion, possibly that applies to @tbay007 as well."
