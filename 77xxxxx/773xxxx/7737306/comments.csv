[V],thetorrentlord,2012-10-18T14:19Z,"The latest installment of ESPN’s critically acclaimed documentary series, 30 for 30, returns tonight with “There’s No Place Like Home”.

After seeing an advance screening of this film, I can safely say that this is one of the best documentaries the series has ever produced. It’s quirky, funny and totally original. 

Unlike the other 30 for 30 films in the past that typically look back at a specific team, player or iconic sports moment, this documentary tells a modern day story of one man’s fanatical quest to win James Naismith’s original document outlining the rules of basketball at auction. His dream is to win these rules for the University of Kansas, where he went to school and where Naismith founded the Jayhawks basketball program. 

The film is very successful at informing the viewer of tons of intriguing moments in basketball history without coming off as a boring, old-school documentary. All the while, the viewer is taken on a wild journey as a Jayhawks fan named Josh Swade travels around the country, trying to convince wealthy alums that his cause is worthy of their time and donations.  

While this film will undoubtedly be revered by Kansas Jayhawks fans, it resonates with anyone who’s ever had a lofty dream that seemed to be impossible. It serves as a feel-good reminder that even though we may not be able to take the court or field, we fans can make an enormous difference for the teams we love. 

“There’s No Place Like Home” is a can’t-miss film not only for the avid sports fan, but for anyone who wants to believe dreams can come true. It’s an instant classic that will be shown on ESPN over and over for years to come."
