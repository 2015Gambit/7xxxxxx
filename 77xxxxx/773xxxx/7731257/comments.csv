,CallMeDeGeL,2012-10-15T23:50Z,"the one i wanted xD just cuz of siri, i dont heard any other xD"
,BeagleBandit,2012-10-17T08:22Z,Are there other voices? that'd be cool!
,Xanthippus,2012-10-18T18:12Z,"Yes, there are a multitude of different voices, but most of them are in languages other than English, so unless you speak the language, it would be useless to upload them.  A couple of English voices I can remember are British, Australian, Irish, and Scottish."
,Xanthippus,2012-10-18T21:16Z,"Okay, I just downloaded Milena, the Russian voice, and it turns out that she can actual read English, but in a Russian accent! However, if you like your Mac telling you time every x hours, the voice will say it in its native language.  With that said, which voices do you guys want?"
,Xanthippus,2012-10-30T05:08Z,"Alright, guys, Milena for Snow Leopard is up and running! Enjoy! https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7771761/Milena_for_Snow_Leopard"
