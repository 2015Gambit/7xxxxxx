Hart.of.Dixie.S02E03.If It Makes You Happy.HDTV.XVID-AVIGUY.avi
Criminal.Minds.S08E03.Through.the.Looking.Glass.XVID-AVIGUY.avi
Covert.Affairs.S03E11.Rock 'n' Roll Suicide.HDTV.XVID.AVIGUY.avi
The.Daily.Show.2012.10.16.Eugene.Jarecki.HDTV.XVID-AVIGUY.avi

The first two are seeding just fine. But the last two are not and I don't know why.

Everything is the same - settings, tracker list, all the same.

People have slowly been dropping off as they don't get any data, but currently:

connected(peers)
20(74) Covert.Affairs.S03E11
3(42) The.Daily.Show.2012.10.16

It's not uTorrent (I use ancient 1.6.1) because I try seeding with recent VUZE
And it doesn't work there either.

If anyone has any ideas - I'd sure like to hear it - I'm completely stumped.
All connected have ""X"" flag set (X: peer was included in peer lists obtained through Peer Exchange (PEX))
Most have ""H"" flag set (H: peer was obtained through DHT)
Most have ""E"" flag set (E: peer is using Protocol Encryption (all traffic))

I seed, I get peers, but no data flows and I don't know why.

This file posted to UseNet now.
