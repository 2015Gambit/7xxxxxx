,hal4000,2012-10-15T21:22Z,Thanks for all these m8. I've got both Sheik Yerbouti and Zoot Allures correct and complete but I don' seem able to f.....g upload them. Been trying a couple of times but nothing works. Guess I'ts my (very) lousy connection. (And mostly ignorance probably) Any help appreciated.
,hal4000,2012-10-15T22:17Z,"I've done all that and I know it's quite self-explanatory and logical and everything but jeeeezus.I just seem to be lost here. I've tried three times and nothing seems to work. It's a shame because i've got these files here but anyway, I'll keep trying and Admin sorry for any mistakes."
,hal4000,2012-10-15T22:22Z,"Working on Linux here, with Transmission. Anyway, doesn't matter. At least I've got them in the Vault, as to say. I'll find a way."

,hal4000,2012-10-15T23:07Z,Thanks Jordan. Will check that out. Especially like the 'patient'. Haha. Been busy with this stuff for years but never had the need to upload anything. About time I learn.
[T],rjordan21,2012-10-15T23:43Z,"@hal4000.

Not everyone has to upload.  SEEDING is key to keep this Pirate ship afloat....

Good luck though.  Once you've got it down it's easy. I'd tak to you there myself but Life now has pulled me in other directions.

Have fun....   "
