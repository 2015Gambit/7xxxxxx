""fmfteam"", I really don't know why you zip them, it doesn't save space or bandwidth (jpgs are _already_ compressed and don't double compress!), and it makes some people wonder what you are hiding in the torrent, and wondering if one of the files will be a sneaky .exe or worse.  But thanks for all your posts,and she is fairly cute!"
,fmfteam,2012-10-19T16:33Z,futureshock999 I zip this file because i put on web seed my private link to download without my seed but when you download torrent from the pirate bay this link is deleted and next torrent will be unpacked
