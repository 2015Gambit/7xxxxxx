,hawkesk57,2012-10-18T06:40Z,"C.mon, hatepig, some people are just Seagal fans.  He could make a movie of himself, holding a stick with dogshit on the end of it, reciting haiku, and his fans would like it."
,BillyBold,2012-10-18T11:51Z,"hawkesk57 - too true. I'm one of them. I like Steven Seagal movies, good or bad.

Anyway, cheers for this!"

,DogTop,2012-10-18T22:26Z,A fake wrestler and a fake cop trying to act.  I'll be passing on this one.
,Brends2012,2012-10-19T03:00Z,Seagal will soon have his card with 20% discount.

,taxentaxen,2012-10-19T16:00Z,whats wrong with spoiling Aliyah O'Brien? the future ex-wife must be raped and saved!!!
,gilsonoliveira,2012-10-19T22:42Z,"Steve seagal since he was a kid, he  try to be an actor. Keep trying steve. :)"
,Jaymark_prs,2012-10-20T17:39Z,"This is actually pretty good for an SS movie. I say that because the story line breaks away from the typical SS movie stories. Filmed in my province of BC Canada makes it a little hard to believe the setting is somewhere deep n the USA but that being said. I liked it! Go figure! 

A/10
V/10 
Cheers! "

Steven ""fatman"" Seagul hahaha"
,nimagiga,2012-10-21T00:52Z,thanks bro! been waiting for seagal..
,y3n007,2012-10-22T18:39Z,"sometimes with just the name of the movie you know it is gonna be a piece of crap, like this one, straight to video, horrible acting....cannot believe with so many years acting at the WWE or whatever he was at (Steve Austin) he just cannot act....skipping this one...."
,Billo51,2012-10-31T10:23Z,"Thanks scene4all, Good Rip;
You guys Talk Crap about Seagal, But he make more money than you and I will ever make, and He can still kick all our ass`s"
,mikeike65,2012-10-31T11:47Z,"@EliteBeast Thank you for alerting us you wont be using this torrent.

ATTENTION EVERYONE: EliteBeast will not be downloading this one. He will wait for the elusive 700mb one. So rest easy.

In other words, nobody gives a shit."
,BoxcarWillie,2012-11-06T04:31Z,"@DogTop
Tell Steve Austin (Williams) to his face he's a fake and see if he kicks your ass or kisses you. My bet is he'll laff at ya the beat ya to a pulp. Andy Kaufman found out the hard way from Jerry Lawler"
