Lost Songs was recorded at Horus Sound Studios in Hanover, Germany.The album's lyrics are themed around war, tyranny and apathy. Frontman Conrad Keely said:

    "The music was inspired by the apathy to real world events that has plagued the independent music scene now for over a decade. "Up to Infinity" is about the Syrian civil war. We believe that tyranny and despotism suffered by any people, anywhere, is intolerable and should not be treated as an internal matter, but completely justifies intervention by the international community."
