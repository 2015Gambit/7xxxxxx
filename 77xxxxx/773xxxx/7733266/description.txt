Release Notes:
--------
These "crazy creatives" ΓÇô as the credits giddily put it ΓÇô have soft-rock
grandiosity down cold, and there's no reason #3 shouldn't cream off much of Snow
Patrol's massive audience. Non-fans, though, will find the album fantastically
bland, and be bemused by O'Donoghue's party trick, which is rapping. He
embellishes several songs with a sweary American accent, adding mild
embarrassment to songs that were trundling along effectively. (A bit of sleepy
rhyming from Voice co-judge will.i.am adds little to Hall of Fame, either.)
O'Donoghue's real metier is lyrics: he's a striking and emotional storyteller
("Would you pat me on the back or would you criticise me?" he asks his late
father on If You Could See Me Now), and it makes #3 listenable.

This is the Best Buy Deluxe Edition containing bonus tracks 13 & 14.
