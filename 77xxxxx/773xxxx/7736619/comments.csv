Borderlands 2 Update 5 info:

Borderlands 2 Update 1.1.2

- Prevents data instability when launched with unsupported commands."
,Kingsanx,2012-10-17T19:43Z,Anyone know what this update actually does? Cant find notes online anywhere

,Matinator10,2012-10-17T20:28Z,â&#x20AC;&#x201C; Prevents data instability when launched with unsupported commands. 
,guccicar,2012-10-17T23:27Z,Does this works with Windows 8?
,kevoo_11,2012-10-18T01:17Z,"Can this be installed over skidrow 4? Or do we need to reinstall the original version, crack it, then crack it again? 

Trying to avoid that, and just asking first to not F up my BL2 "
,bacitoto,2012-10-18T03:01Z,We need windows 8 fix!!!
,Prosum,2012-10-18T08:58Z,"Or run Windows 7... especially considering 8 hasn't been released yet. Just saying I don't think you should rightfully expect support for a, technically, unreleased OS. I would wager that full Dev and Scene support for 8 probably won't happen immediately either. I would never solely run an OS that was still in beta. I'd dual-boot 7 and 8 at the very least. Just a suggestion."
,Glassed,2012-10-18T09:45Z,"@kevoo_11 Read the description.You don't need to have any of the previous updates installed, as this
update is featuring all previous updated content."
,Darshe42,2012-10-18T16:48Z,"Just so people are aware. This still doesn't fix hamachi.
You will get a version mismatch error.
Though if anyone figures out how to fix this please do tell!"
,oorenotsoo,2012-10-18T20:00Z,"@kevoo_11 and Glassed: I have not downloaded/installed this update. Yes, you should be able to install this over Update 4 and yes it will include the updates from 1-4. (Just make sure you copy over the new crack) However, AFAIK this does not include the DLC that was included in Update 4. Update 4 was >500MB, this is ~89MB. 

Side note: If you end up somehow fucking up your BL2, you might be able to fix it quickly and easily with a right-click->properties->previous versions on your install folder."
,Immortel9,2012-10-19T10:00Z,This is not genuine Skidrow update.
,Immortel9,2012-10-19T10:14Z,This is not genuine Skidrow update and stop deleting my comments.
,Darkfirebird,2012-10-20T04:48Z,"@Darshe42: As with Tunngle also. You may need to disable your firewall / antivirus. ( For me I had ZoneAlarm and if it was on, anyone connecting to me got the generic error 'mismatched game versions' )
Hope it helps."
,larry27,2012-10-22T19:08Z,Game wont start at all with update 4 same thing.Using win7 64-bit.
,larry27,2012-10-22T19:11Z,"Using 3DM crack,game starts and right away crashes to desktop?!"
,coolioice,2012-10-22T21:20Z,"i followed every instruction to the fucking letter and this shit doesn't work. i didn't make any mistakes, i know i didn't, i made sure i didn't. i even uninstalled, re-installed, and re-cracked twice. this shit just doesn't fucking work. i did all the firewall stuff too, so i don't see why this isn't working. the only explanation is that the crack just doesn't work. "
,Aud1tt,2012-10-23T22:24Z,"Well it seems that SKIDROW is using some kind of a new lib or dll or even a different redistributable that we don't have.

Many of their newest cracks are not launching the game at all on Windows 8, no error report. The exe closes automatically."
,tiboka,2012-10-24T07:47Z,"@Aud1tt

So true! Because of that, i had to downgrade to windows 7. :-("
,Darkfirebird,2012-10-24T16:09Z,"@Aud1tt & larry27: From another comment:
You may need to install steam. You don't need it to run or update, just having it install is fine."
,d.p.roberts,2012-10-24T16:23Z,"@Aud1tt & tiboka:
This isn't entirely off-topic since it addresses your compatibility issue. Windows 8 is unreleased and unsupported.  In order for you to have realistic expectation of reliable functionality, you should at least use a mainstream operating system.  I'm sure that once Microsoft officially releases Windows 8 and folks catch up, you can expect more reliable functionality and compatibility with it. Until then, you should have some patience."
,HotCocoa,2012-10-25T04:20Z,This is not SKiDROW. You're a bitch.
,Zmajce,2012-10-27T15:48Z,"When this
version mismatch error starts? From this update?
Though if anyone figures out how to fix this, please do tell.
Should I reinstall the game and go back to previous update?
Or just go for

,Darkfirebird,2012-10-28T02:02Z,@Zmajce : I did a response in the earlier posts... Tends to be Firewall / Anti-Virus.
