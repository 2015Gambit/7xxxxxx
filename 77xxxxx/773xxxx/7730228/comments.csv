,nicklas1015,2012-10-15T18:21Z,"So? YOU ONLY HAVE ONE TORRENT

And .rar is often passworded, GTFO.
I wait for reloaded to upload it. Not some random fag"
,vascob,2012-10-15T18:36Z,is it working?
,adamz_PL,2012-10-15T18:45Z,1 rar file = 99% fake
,siwy0184,2012-10-15T18:48Z,too bad being an idiot isn't deadly...
,vymrd,2012-10-15T20:23Z,its OK.
,BobVilaHomeAgain,2012-10-15T20:39Z,"If the only difference is the folders are in the corrected places, then why is it 6.4 GiB when the other is just 3???"
,siwy0184,2012-10-15T21:21Z,"2013 scenarios wasn't working so i added content from 2012 deluxe, but still not everything is working -we need to wait on better release."
,zagna,2012-10-15T21:33Z,13 people download it ... noone can tell us IF ITS OK OR NOT??? FFS!
,adamz_PL,2012-10-15T22:25Z,"Ok, i have it - there is problem - the game is unpacked, but there is only Steam.exe, not cracked exe. So, we have to wait now for cracked exe."
,siwy0184,2012-10-15T22:46Z,read readme in torrent to play...
,adamz_PL,2012-10-15T22:55Z,"EDIT: it works - Run GreenLuma.exe, then choose Train Simulator 2013 from the list in game library and clicl Play button. Confirmed - not fake."
,phaids,2012-10-16T00:32Z,"If I have a legit Steam-version of TS 2013, can I install this and run my old pirated content from RW2? They dosen't seem to work in the Steam-version.

Great upload btw. "
,mrantcorr,2012-10-16T00:33Z,why is it taking so long to upload?
,siwy0184,2012-10-16T10:10Z,"phaids

Yes u can, just follow readme in torrent. (log your steam, go offline, use greenluma in offline mode, play). About 2012 content; everything is in readme, copy right files in right places:)"
,elbarbon,2012-10-16T11:46Z,"It is OK. I have all asset, routes and manuals from 2012 cracked copied in 2013 cracked. ÂĄfantastic! thanks."

,Angelo20,2012-10-16T15:43Z,"ItÂ´s Ok it Works but its for Rookies very Difficult to activate the game. You need a Steamaccount then you must Login with the Bogie Account.

Then you must imediately Logg Off otherwise, Steam Destroyed the Completely Installation and Unrar Files.

And Finally needed Assets, Content and Manuals Folder from Cracked TS 2012 to Copy in the Steamapps, Common, Railworks Folder of TS 2013.

Excuse me for my Bad English, and a Appreciate Thank to siwy0184!"

,mrantcorr,2012-10-17T03:48Z,"yep, class 377 doesnt work full stop, it comes up with the London to Brighton but cant find class 377"
,zagna,2012-10-17T07:38Z,"working but i choose SD70 for first quick trip and when the load ended i got black screen and an error ""something bad happened to your game"" nice Try uploader appreciated , i just have to wait a cracked .exe release from Reloaded why too late ?"

,TheNemmy,2012-10-25T09:22Z,"this has some textures missing, it's been a month but no proper release ? plz skidrow / reloaded, help us."
