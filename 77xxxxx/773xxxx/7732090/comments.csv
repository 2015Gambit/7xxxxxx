,fall1en,2012-10-18T22:01Z,"Yep wrong file!

DibyaTPB, you been drinking before you uploaded this?"
,lotus14,2012-10-23T06:49Z,Fake! Shoulda read the comments first :
,Saki33,2012-10-24T17:53Z,"It is definitely GG, not Major Crimes. I tried to download at PublicHD, and while it said Major Crimes on the torrent, it was Gossip Girl when I checked the folder to see what was downloading. I'm surprised that Dibya hasn't fixed this at PublicHD, but impossible to delete your own torrent once you've uploaded at TPB. The only way to get it removed is to report it as a bad file at the forum and have an admin take it down."
[H],Wanderer,2012-10-24T21:28Z,"Actually only the uploader can request for his torrent to be deleted.
I m sure the uploader has more things in his mind than this and while he should fix this he is not obliged to do so.
Anyway you guys have made it more than clear here what are the contents of this torrent.Whoever makes a mistake with this torrent from now on its his fault for not spending a few seconds to read the comments."
