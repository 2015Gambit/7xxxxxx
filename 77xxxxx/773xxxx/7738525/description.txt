Dynamic Auto-Painter Pro (x64)

Dynamic Auto-Painter (DAP) is a fun to use software to automatically turn a photo or a 3D rendering into great looking painting inspired by some of the most famous real world artists.

Dynamic Auto-Painter can work also as a great feedback tool to improve your photography skills by simplifying the image to its core visual value

This is not your ordinary photo-to-painting effect! Instead of changing the pixels of the photo itself, DAP uses the input image only as a guide to paint the scene with many different brushes and guided by real-world artists inspired techniques.

"In a nutshell, Dynamic Auto-Painter not only emulates the technique but also the way different painters would see the same scene"
