,g33kymama,2012-10-23T00:03Z,"I downloaded this and burned the iso to a disk with Active ISO burner in an attempt to fix my husbands computer, which says windows is missing winload32.exe. I used a recovery disk only to be notified it no longer had windows on it. I tried to use this and it says that the install.exe was missing. 

It loaded the program but when I clicked install it  came up with an error that said that. Any tips/help/ideas?"
