As a severe storm front rapidly closes in on the UK, all flights out of East Midlands 
airport are cancelled, all but Atlantic Sky Airways Flight 686, bound for New York. 
Shortly after take-off, several passengers become concerned when one of them disappears. 
Their anxieties are further increased when it becomes apparent that the flight has veered 
off course and it is revealed that the plane is carrying an interesting item of cargo: a rare 
and extremely valuable ancient Chinese vase. The assumption is that terrorists are 
responsible, but nobody on board is showing their hand, for now. With tensions rising 
amongst the passengers and crew, violence soon breaks out, forcing those behind the 
deadly plot to expose their identities.
