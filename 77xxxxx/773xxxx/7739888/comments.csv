The Audio however is 50% inaudible and the audible parts are extremely high pitched that pierce the ear drums.

Constant background noise I had to turn it off after 10 minutes from a massive head and ear ache."
,Revisionist,2012-10-18T23:04Z,Well Tazerz thats why you should avoid R5's.  The audio is usually horrible.  Why anyone bothers with R5s is beyond me
