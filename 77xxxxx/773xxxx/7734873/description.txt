blocSonic is quite proud to present to you the self-titled debut by Richmond, Virginia artist Friends or Whatever. With its fusion of shimmering electronica and a raw rock vibe, FoW proves to be a very engaging listen. At times quiet and contemplativeΓÇª at other times beat-driven and laced with distorted guitar and melancholic vocals. All the while a bit challenging to put your finger on and yet itΓÇÖs quickly familiar. ItΓÇÖs that very enigmatic nature thatΓÇÖs sure to pull you in.

On a side note, I just wanted to give a shout out to Just Plain Sounds. When I first heard early versions of some of the FoW music, I had not known that it was originally set for a JPS release. After approaching Mark Herbkersman (aka Friends or Whatever) about a blocSonic release, I found out. I have to give props to Anthony Gillison aka Just Plain Ant who was gracious enough to allow us the pleasure. So thank you once again Ant!!!

Thank YOU for downloading and listening, I hope youΓÇÖll enjoy it every bit as much as I do. RememberΓÇª as alwaysΓÇª share itΓÇª podcast itΓÇª blog it.

Peace
