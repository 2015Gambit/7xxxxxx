i will keep seed this for a long time
but, in a day u might not get any speed coz i may not able to seed full day
rest assured i will seed until there r many seeders
and due to my normal internet connection, my upload speed will not be very high 

AND PLZ SEED AFTER U FINISH DOWNLOADING, even for a day

thanks for reading"

The old BitComet crap that you are using has been obsolete for many years. "
