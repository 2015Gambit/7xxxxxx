This will be nuked shortly.

There is no sound after 23 minutes."
[T],iamgreat,2012-10-18T06:51Z,It is at 22.56.576 that the audio ends. Which means about half the episode is silent.  Since the .mp4 file is fine this appears to be an editing / muxing error that should easily be fixed. Please 2HD can we have a repack.
[T],VixenofVenus,2012-10-18T07:56Z,"With MKVMerge and the basic SD mp4 download, you can merge the two files together and select the video from the 720p and the audio from the SD ...

The audio sync's up perfectly.

I'd upload my own merged file, but I'm currently in a hotel room and the upload speed is less than 15kbps ... I'd be uploading for a week!!!"
[T],iamgreat,2012-10-18T17:17Z,"VixenofVenus, that works UNLESS you are wanting the 5.1 audio. There is a repack that came out nearly 7 hours ago. I just noticed it; surprised it isn't here. But then again look at how the seeders have quadrupled despite the pretty big flaw with this.  Some people will blindly follow the green skulls..."
