[V],gnv65,2012-10-17T16:39Z,I had to study it to decipher the commentary in my Russian chess books of which I had lots as I was an amateur chess player during my school days!

The only book i managed to leaf through was 'Winning Chess: tactics and strategies' by Ted Nottingham et al. I think the fact that the print was large, helped to an extent."
