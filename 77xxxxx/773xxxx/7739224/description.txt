If you thought Bryan Adams was just another pop star, this impressive performance will prove a revelation. Before an appreciative crowd of 56,000 fans in the natural amphitheater near Slane Castle in Ireland, Adams and his bandmates (drummer Mickey Curry and guitarist Keith Scott) provide a hard-driving set of Adams's best-known songs, working wonders with their muscular three-piece arrangements. While providing a solid bass foundation, Adams is an amiable host in top form, moving quickly and confidently from rockers like "It's Only Love" to the chart-topping ballad "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You," and the crowd proves its devotion with a massive sing-along. Former Spice Girl Mel C. appears--along with a lucky girl from the audience--for a lively rendition of "When You're Gone," and the entire concert is faithfully reproduced in crystal-clear 5.1-channel audio. It's a rockin' good show, and the backstage footage and interviews are a welcome bonus. --Jeff Shannon
