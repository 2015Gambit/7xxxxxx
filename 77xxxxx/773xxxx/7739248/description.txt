Hard to find DVD rip of Judas Kiss, 1998 caper movie directed by Sebastian Gutierrez about a kidnapping  which goes a little off, you might say.


Good soundtrack, wonderful sexy Carla, many plot twists and chemistry between "admitted hard to believe New Orleans lawmen" Thompson and Rickman make this a fun watch. DVD not released in America unfortunately so this is a foreign DVD rip, my first time creating an AVI,  so file size may be a little large for this type but it plays and looks  as the DVD does.  Please re-Seed for just awhile as I'm not online as much anymore. enjoy
