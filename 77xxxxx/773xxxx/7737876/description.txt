||				ABOUT:					||
||									||
||		UNPOPULAR is a lame P2P group that sucks at		||
||		releasing on time and in good quality. They		||
||		do what they can, but without hdtv feed or		||
||		any prior encoding experience, they receive		||
||		more complaints that compliments. We do try!		||

||		The quality might not be the best (standard def		||
||		sucks, amirite?) but we do try our best to		||
||		deliver shows the scene or other P2P groups		||
||		don't. We also upload releases to cyberlockers		||
||		to download but once they're gone, they're		||
||		gone!							||

==========================================================================
||									||
||				GREETZ:					||
||									||
||		Greetings to all scene and P2P groups we've		||
||		viewed material from. Thanks for your hard		||
||		work and dedication. We realise the scene		||
||		dislikes P2P for numerous reasons but hey,		||
||		we're noobs and have to start out somewhere,		||
||		right? Think about that. We're just offering		||
||		what we can, how we can. Peace. -UNPOPULAR		||
