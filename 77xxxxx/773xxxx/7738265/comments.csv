I love you all, but I've been warned by the powers above, and really don't want to lose my ISP :(  You guys are great, but I think it's time for me to hang up my hat... I will hopefully now and again post a show or two, but please don't depend on me for regular uploads... You guys are great... search for magzcrib on google for the stuff I upload... JJ and others, etc... be kind to one another!  xoxo -- mdprosser"

,Pendaws,2012-10-18T23:53Z,"MD, what will I do now :( You have been like my procurer of the JJ drug and now you are leaving??? :(
Just joking :). Truly though, you will be missed and the torrents you upload here as well. I thank you so much for taking the time to upload these and make a lot of people happy. Sorry to see the end of this."
[V],mdprosser,2012-10-19T01:41Z,Thank you for all the kind comments... you guys can still get the daily JJ episodes uploaded by Sebastian (who uploads a bunch of other great shows) on Magzcrib... the site is awesome for hard-to-find shows... Magz who runs it is amazing... just do a google search for Magzcrib & it's the first link
