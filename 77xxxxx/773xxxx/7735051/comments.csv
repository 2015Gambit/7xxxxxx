Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 1793  seed,(im never having a go at the uploader ! )  if you  find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb.com  info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out (eg if its porn what type eg lesbien) ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc ( copy and paste this comment & save it in a word document or open office or a draft email & then paste it as a reminder to people to be helpful on every torrent you look at â&#x20AC;Ś 1 by 1 teaching selfish snatch & grabbers to help out) "

ok"
,bob-420,2012-10-17T19:00Z,"@saggybluetits24, jesus go preach somewhere else, puddinpop.  Those that bitch the most, do the least.  You probably seed less than anyone, you little prick."
,snowbirds,2012-10-17T21:42Z,"wow, someone needs some more 420...  right BOB????

thanks for the up, SureNdrA!

anyone got A/V quality?"
,snowbirds,2012-10-17T22:42Z,"I just looked at the sample on my laptop.  It looked great!  Maybe  a little soft (not crisp) but I didn't see any pixilation even in dark scenes.

I would give it a strong 8.5 - 9 for A/V."
,shanebb,2012-10-17T23:01Z,I've seen dvd rips better than this.
,Jumpst0r,2012-10-18T04:01Z,"@GhostofMackisGod
You remind me of one of the fatasses from mcdonalds that stay on the computer the whole day that dont have jobs and leech off their parents . But i completely agree with you about the seeding thing. ps. lay off the movies for a bit, there's a whole world out there :D"
,fwee288,2012-10-18T05:21Z,"Any more A/V comments? 
Are english subs for whole movie or just non english parts?"
,gjpp,2012-10-18T05:22Z,so whats the rating on this one? enough with the preaching.
,briffault,2012-10-18T07:56Z,"Thanks for the upload, I like it."
,alije,2012-10-18T09:25Z,thanks
,ScottyD7421,2012-10-18T13:02Z,"Nice upload SureNdrA, much appreciated.

12 comments prior to mine and no one bothers to give a rating?

A/10
V/10

Picture and Audio are both excellent quality. 

The writing (opening and closing credits, loction name etc.) is in Russian but it does not detract from the movie as the characters are basically talking about where they are or where they are going so you know their location. 

All in all a great upload.

Cheers"
,resmith,2012-10-18T13:21Z,"A V 9 Same as the other downloads, Not totally English, 4 or 5 points where it has hardcoded names of cities. Having trouble opening subs but probably just my computer on this one. Subs are more for the hearing impaired by the size of the srt. English translation only needs to be around 4 kbs in size."
,HSpawn,2012-10-18T15:57Z,"Can't believe this is out on BR already. Thanks for the upload. 

A&V 9/10 really good quality for the size. Haven't watched the whole thing but English is the spoken language throughout so there is no real problem with the Russian text.

,molly_dog,2012-10-19T05:51Z,"ahkk97, stop with your spamming bullshit. I've checked out your ""great"" links. They're ripoffs one and all.

Why don't you, GhostofMackisGod and Jumpst0r go have a 3-way with each other and in general stop wasting the bandwidth of those of us who believe seeding is the ""price"" for all the freebies.

In short. go f**k yourselves and die!"

,TtToker,2012-10-20T09:54Z,"I think the only people saying this movie was good are just spammers. This ""film"" is 100% GARBAGE. "
,dak9,2012-10-20T20:25Z,GhostofMackisGod with that attitude you shouldn`t be allowed to dl anything. What a fckn shittalker.
,libertaswv,2012-10-20T22:46Z,"babybluetits is one of the most community-minded contributors on tpb. They've posted literally hundreds of bits of info in the comment sections of as many seeds. The last person that should be dumped on is someone that goes waaaay out of their way to help each and every one of us. 

Sincerely appreciate your longtime efforts, bbt. Really.

Thanks a ton to SureNdrA, and to all seeders and leechers - thanks for making it happen!"

,lugnoc22,2012-10-21T02:20Z,"Honestly, everyone keeps moaning and groaning at someone about not seeding, one stop its pointless your not gonna meet them or hurt them so stop, two please keep all posts to about the movie Q/A so we who do seed and dl can know if the copy is good or not, three all of us millions of people who view and download these files do not want to hear you all b*tch and moan, thank you @babyblue and @Scotty"
,lugnoc22,2012-10-21T02:21Z,aswell to @SureNdrA
,libertaswv,2012-10-21T05:54Z,"The 'ghostofwhatever' kid is just an angry little boy. 

He pastes the same thing in every well seeded comment section. By replying, you give him what he wants, as with all trolls. 

Ignore him, and he'll have nothing but his personality disorder to keep him company. "
,MARYUS1010,2012-10-21T12:32Z,I rather wait for a proper DVDRip. Probably audio is imported leading to a bad A/V sync.
,Glassed,2012-10-21T14:52Z,Anyone knows why the english subtitle file doesn't work when I try to add it?I'm using VLC media player btw.It keeps saying VLC can't recognize the input's format.

,datwerd,2012-10-24T10:14Z,"@GhostofMackisGod people like you should not be given access to the internet. If you take and never give back then you are ensuring a lack of torrents in the future.
Downloading is not a right, its a privilege. Seeding is a must to ensure the torrent community stays healthy."

@ everyone else, shut the hell up...stop crying...and realize you are being trolled. I never comment on anything..ever...but the fact that GhostofMackisGod has over 50% of the users crying on here...just rofl!!!"
,jh31415,2012-10-28T11:22Z,"Included subs are out of sync and for entire movie, not foreign parts only.  Anyone have a link to a suitable foreign-parts sub file?"
,jh31415,2012-10-28T11:34Z,"Also -- this is an R5, not a BRRip, as evidenced by on-screen titles being in cyrillic.  Can we have accuracy in release tags, please."
