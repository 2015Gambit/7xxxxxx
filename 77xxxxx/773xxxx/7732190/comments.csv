,_xori_,2012-10-16T07:10Z,Indeed! +1
,Neon_Jackal,2012-10-16T07:41Z,"Why is this one so much bigger, and what is .ts?"
,lAsphyxial,2012-10-16T09:33Z,ts is basically the raw format for the ripped tv show.. when there in 130-160mb mkvs they've been converted down to save size.
,Tanis138,2012-10-16T10:40Z,"dwjp90!
Will there be ""normal"" (.mkv) release? I (and many many fans of your AT releases) simply don't understand why did you decide to change format to .ts?! It's only 2 episodes left till the end of 4 season and you (again) changed formats! :( We simply don't need this big .ts for last two episodes, while all previous eps were in .mkv! 

So, please! Ple-e-ease, re-upload in .mkv! 

P.S.: And don't tell me ""if you want mkv convert it yourself"". This is not the option."
,MoMoCHu5,2012-10-16T16:20Z,"I think Tanis is being a little bit of a waaah! Baby, but I fully agree (just think it could have been said differently
My internet speed is like really slow (South Africa), it'll probably take at most 5 hours maybe more to download this... I mean if it was faster I would have just downloaded it and converted it myself, but it's gonna take way too long to finish. 
Please tell me you're gonna re-upload the .mkv version and stick to .mkv
If you're not, well not like I could do anything but.. "
,Tanis138,2012-10-16T17:35Z,"Sorry if my post was too emotional. Of course, I am very grateful to dwjp90 for his work. It's just... It's the third time when he changes encoding settings in his AT releases.

I'm not against HQ .ts releases. And I agree that quality of .ts is higher than x264 .mkv. But, is it hard to also upload .mkv version of episodes? For those who has bad or expensive Internet connections, who don't have >40"" plasma and don't need ultimate quality? ;)

P.S.: I'm not child. My Đ&#x2022;nglish is not perfect 'cause it's not my native language :)"
,agekindly,2012-10-16T22:32Z,"Thank you for the speedy upload
who cares about format? In regards to connection speed just be patient, the satisfaction will be that much greater especially with a show of this caliber

,cuteycindyhoney,2012-10-17T03:00Z,"474MiB is a little big, but I don't see it as a major issue. I'm used to downloading multi-GB files! Thanks for the upload! "
,dwjp90,2012-10-17T06:24Z,"Sorry guys, this was NOT supposed to be uploaded.

Sorry for those who downloaded it, basically the program i use copied the raw instead of the mkv."
,SugarLacedLie,2012-10-23T05:44Z,"Wonderful upload!  V/10 A/10!

Do you think you could upload The Lich?"
,krobtpb,2012-10-24T19:47Z,"please upload The Lich, the quality of the other torrents is nothing compared to what i've downloaded from you before"
