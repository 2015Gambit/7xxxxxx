,ChicaPirata,2012-10-16T03:48Z,"To call women ""sluts"" is pretty aggressive, don't you think? Just wonder for a minute where you came from, oh... a woman!
You should be little more respectful of the other half of yourself, as women and man we need each other in order to live.
Stop consuming porn and your brain WILL desintoxicate... eventually. "
,Glenn1963,2012-10-16T07:21Z,"You seem to be the one applying a negative connotation to the term, when in fact I hold sluts in the highest regard.  

And as far as porn goes, the women who work in the adult entertainment industry do so by CHOICE and are  compensated for their efforts.  

If everyone followed your suggestion to stop consuming their product, thousands of gainfully employed women would be thrown out of work, and forced to seek other sources of income.  How is that helpful?"

If porn intoxicates the brain - well what are you doing here in the porn section?

Or are you just on a crusade against the evil?"
