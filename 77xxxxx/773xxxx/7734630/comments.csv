,dmex00,2012-10-17T03:54Z,where can I download a 1080p version??? To play it on a iPad 3....
,Hambosas,2012-10-17T05:51Z,@dmex00 I'm afraid there are no 1080p versions of this encoded specifically for iTunes/iDevices but once I upgrade hard drive space I will start uploading 1080p and 720p versions of future movies

,Hambosas,2012-10-18T01:04Z,"@chuckasarus I will seed all my torrents at night, which is about 12:00 am to 4:00 pm US Central time if that's what you want to know"
,chuckasarus,2012-10-18T01:39Z,"Thanks nice to know. I seed 24/7 so I'll make sure it gets seeded.
Thanks again"
