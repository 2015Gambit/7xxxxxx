,FluffigtDjur,2012-10-17T22:45Z,"Should've called it ""The Stumbling Dead"", considering how the series has developed over the last few issues. Thanks for the upload, though. Nice scan and this one almost felt like they're going places again.  "
,Ubenhiton,2012-10-17T22:53Z,After 100 issues I guess it's getting hard to keep the story interesting.  I have faith it will come back around.  Thanks for sharing.
,pow.r.pop,2012-10-18T00:23Z,"The writing is sooooooo bad, sooooo, slow.

Fuck Kirkman 

But Thank you GunningHawk90"
,mytmowse,2012-10-18T06:04Z,"Have a little faith... and patience. There has to be ""slow"" issues sometimes to set up stories with more action. I think the story and character development are well worth the lack of action. What are we, ten years old? I think it seems obvious that they're building to something better in the near future. Great download! Thanks!"
,baconninja,2012-10-18T10:49Z,Think Kirkman is distracted with the show and other stuff. It keeps looping like a broken record.But  Thanks for the up!!
,pow.r.pop,2012-10-18T16:43Z,"Yeah , but that was like 10 pages ! WTF ?"
,ZombArt,2012-10-18T22:20Z,"Yeah, what everyone else said.

It's like he's focusing too much on the show maybe, because the comic is clearly suffering. This one was boring as fuck, as have many have been over the last year or so.  

Thank you for the upload, of course."

,grimaudio,2012-10-18T23:15Z,I waited 3 weeks for this shit?
,railgun1,2012-10-19T09:30Z,"Nice quality, thank you!"
,captkong,2012-10-20T05:35Z,"Thanks for the share. All is good with the file.

But for fuck's sake, Kirkman... if you're gonna do a filler issue, at least put some filler in it."
,Riga11,2012-10-21T08:20Z,"Sweet upload 10/10
The story is starting to rustle my jimmies though."
,NinpoLore,2012-10-24T23:17Z,"Great upload, GH. You consistently make me the happiest fanboy alive.

Now, with regards to this PARTICULAR issue... let me say a few words. I can see that most of the hardcore fans are getting fed up with all this filler crap, and I'm with you. The last ten issues have been mostly boring, nothing like the heart-stopping drama we all experienced way back during the Governor's story arc. The reason for this shirt in quality? I don't know, but I think most of the people commenting have somewhat of a clue. Kirkman is spending a lot more time on the show, but remember that he's also consulting for The Walking Dead game, the countless novelizations that are no doubt in the works, and many other projects besides. I have faith, though, and here's my reasoning.

Do you guys remember how fucking awesome it felt as a reader to see Rick and Michonne get bloody revenge against the Governor? Why did that feel so cathartic? Because we had seen Rick and the gang completely brutalized and beaten. They were made maggots in the mud, completely unlike the characters we had grown to love. I'm hoping that this is what Kirkman is doing with these last few issues. Negan and the gang have slowed the story down a bit, but I have faith that a gigantic fucking bomb is going to go off soon, a bomb that brings Rick & Co back on top. A few people have mentioned that any long-term story needs lows as well as highs - let's just have faith that this is a low, yeah?

Don't get me wrong, though. If this boring shit keeps up, I'ma be pissed. Don't you forsake us, Kirkman!"
,STFmaryville,2012-10-27T04:33Z,"Lot of whining from you guys. Kirkman isn't infallible but TWD is over TEN YEARS consistently better than 90% of the crap put out by Marvel and better than 95% of DC. Honestly if you can write a better horror comic, go out and do it. Maybe you'll make a million bucks ..."
,ropeadop3,2012-10-27T22:48Z,"Agree 100% with STFmaryville and mytmowse, you guys are a bunch of fucktards that need a quick action fix, I'd probably be more sympathetic if you actually bought the comic and thought it wasn't worth the money but you're not, you're getting this shit for free, so fucking enjoy it. And they are not fillers but character developments, which are necessary."
,pow.r.pop,2012-10-28T02:09Z,"""they are not fillers but character developments, which are necessary.""

15 issues of that is enough ......fucktard "
,tflagger997,2012-10-28T06:16Z,"""they are not fillers but character developments""

What, like Glen being not-alive?  Aside from that what character development has happened since issue 80?  Nothing.   Rick is still just as leader-today, whining-psycho tomorrow.  The rest are mostly criers, and sulkers.  No one has grown in this story for a very long time, unless you count Schizophrenia as growth.

Then there is the continuity errors that have decimated this story.  How in the hell did numb-nutz's army sneak up on Rick and his Zombie killing ninja-sqaud in running vehicles?  Hell, even on foot, it would have been a hard sell.  Not to mention that their small army would have drawn the attention of a lot of walkers.  That is just one of the most ridiculous things pulled in the last few issues.

On another note -
Most here seem to be under the mistaken impression that Kirkman and the lads have anything to do with the show.  They do not.  Their comics do, as source material.  They collect their % of the profits, and may even be invited to look-over the general arc of the current season's script before shooting on the first episode begins.  Aside from that, they just get invited to a few more parties.  They are certainly not in Georgia with the shooting crew, or in Hollywood with the post-production crew.


They problem is that they have no idea how to develop their characters, just like most TV writers.  They introduce them,  throw in some back-story to explain why they are the way they are. Then the characters stagnate until the need to do something 'drastic' comes along, and one gets sacrificed to appease the audience.  Then they each whine and remember the good 'ol days, get some revenge, get drunk or help someone unrelated to the story, and go back to being the same characters they were before.  Rinse and repeat.

It also looks like their ideas on how to develop the world of TWD have also evaporated.  Around every corner is another slightly larger, yet perversely weak group that need protecting. As they are being threatened by an ever larger, ever more-psychotic bunch of thugs that have managed to not only survive, but flourish.  Then the two fight, 50% of Ricks side dies, but the 'main' characters limp through it claiming to be stronger (even though one is usually missing a substantial part of their body) and have learned.  Then they are wary of strangers for a few issues, acting more logical and tactical, but quickly reverting back into their old selves again.

Two years in an hand-loaders are just being thought of?  Is it going to be another 50 issues before someone re-discovers the ancient art of Molotov cocktails, pipe-bomb grenades (with lit fuses not timers), and all the other ways we have for killing each other?  Hell, when are they going to finally use the Zombies as weapons?  Jesus could lead a herd right up to the enemy in the middle of the night, then skirt the perimeter, climb the nearest hill, and watch the show.  

I will wait for the obvious showdown that is brewing for Issue 105, but I doubt this will hold much interest past that.  Perhaps Kirkman is listening (elsewhere) but I doubt it.  I would not be surprised if they just kill everyone off, burn the community down, and restructure the group again.  If that happens, and the survivors do not start heading to the nearest military base to tool-up, I would suggest you leave before they ruin all the good memories.  I hope that they do pull it out of the fire, but it is staring to smoke.  "
,shadowdl,2012-10-31T00:51Z,"hey guys i have all the walking dead comics in PDF format and i have them in comic, volume, book, and compendium versions and i would much like to share it with the world but idk how to make a torrent! help?"
,pow.r.pop,2012-11-04T02:04Z,"@ shadowdl ........Suck my balls , we all have all that shit already and another torrent is pointless.

@ tflagger997  ......Right on. I've been saying that for a while too. This story still has a LOT of potential  but they are pissing it away. 


MAIN POINT I would make is that the art work REALLY Sucks Donkey Balls now , like it was drawn so you could see the world through the eyes of a dude with Glaucoma "
