Beth Fouhy of the Associated Press questioned some of the film's points and said its central thesis that Obama's presidency is an expression of his father's political beliefs, ""is almost entirely subjective and a logical stretch at best"". Ben Mankiewicz stated, ""I think [the film] is another reminder of how many people in this country find Obama so shockingly unlikesome that they are seemingly ready to believe the most nonsensical theories about him."""
[V],joshua13,2012-10-16T17:30Z," In the Washington Post, Michael O’Sullivan described the movie as a ""slick infomercial...destined to irritate the president’s supporters while mobilizing his detractors, even as it is doomed to win precious few converts"", while also criticizing D'Souza for ""fear-mongering of the worst kind"". Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic said it was ""preaching to the choir"" in a style similar to Michael Moore's films, but without the humor, straw men, and views from the other side. Joe Leydon of Variety said ""The deft editing and overall technical polish -- as well as a generous travel budget -- go a long way toward making the pic an attention-grabber"" but that ""the pic comes off as a cavalcade of conspiracy theories, psycho-politico conjectures and incendiary labeling"" making it ""highly unlikely that anyone predisposed to championing Obama would be won over"". He also stated, ""there's no gainsaying the value of '2016' as a sort of Cliffs Notes precis of the conservative case against the re-election of our current U.S. president."""
[V],joshua13,2012-10-16T17:33Z,"btw I will freely admit that Romney is probably more competent than the President, but I'd rather have someone who is mediocre at trying to help the average american and further world peace, than someone who is highly competent at working primarily for the rich and making the world situation worse. Mister we could use a man like William Clinton again."
,chedderz66,2012-10-16T18:30Z,"If you would rather have Obama =more record high unemployment, more TRILLION dollar deficits, record low (stagnant) economic growth, a healthcare mandate penalty/tax, naive and dangerous foreign policy, economically killing energy policy (Keystone,off shore drilling ban), high gas prices, etc etc=  then you're a fucking braindead moron. Romney is surging in all the polls, especially in swing states and even the National poll and WILL WIN in a landslide just like Reagan...Obama the Great is DONE! "

,-G-rad,2012-10-20T23:06Z,"so obama is not working for the rich?...
Who paid for his election then?
Banksters and war industrial complex - they've invested correctly: there are new wars every few months and bailouts and ""QE to Infinity"".
The Bipartisan Party rules and sheeple are arguing who to vote for..."
