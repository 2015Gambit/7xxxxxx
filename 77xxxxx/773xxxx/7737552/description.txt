Another torrent I'm uploading because the previous one I found was password protected with a survey scam. So annoying. 

This is from some random download site in multiple parts. I just uploaded it so you can see all the video and projects 

files and know its not fake!


My upload is slow so it may take a day or so to get another full seed going.
