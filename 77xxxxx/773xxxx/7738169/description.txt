By far my favorite hentai mini-series EVER. 

Here's the description :P

Boku no Pico (πü╝πüÅπü«πü┤πüô Boku no Piko?, lit. My Pico) is a Japanese series of adult shotacon anime OVAs produced by Natural High. The producer has described it as "the first shotacon anime", although the series could also could be categorized as an otokonoko anime. The series consists of three episodes, as well as a one-shot manga chapter, an upcoming computer game and a video compilation of songs. Because of the high cost of producing anime, the characters and contents were intensively product-tested before production began.

- Pico

A blond pre-adolescent boy who works part-time at his grandfather's bar in the summer. He's often shown swimming, usually naked or in a blue Speedo. He wears girls' clothing after Tamotsu suggests it. Later, hurt that Tamotsu wouldn't define their relationship, he rebels by cutting off most of his hair and runs away. The following summer, he spots Chico swimming nude in a stream while cycling. He soon befriends the other boy, who calls him "oniichan" and forms a sexual relationship with him. In his relationships with both Mokkun and Chico, he is the uke, though the latter is somewhat reversible. Pico is played by Mariko Sakou under the pseudonym Pico.

- Mokkun

Nicknamed "Mokkun" by Pico, he's a young man who sexualizes Pico. Tamotsu is a white collar worker and regular of BeBe. He seduces Pico mistaking him for a young girl, but continues the relationship after realizing Pico's true gender. He later buys Pico a girl's outfit, complete with collar and panties, which he persuades Pico to wear despite his initial protests. He views Pico solely as a sexual object, though later shows true concern for Pico after he disappears. Although he eventually reconciles his relationship with Pico, he is absent in the second and third OVA. In his relationship with Pico, he is the seme.

- Ojiisan

Pico's grandfather runs a large but usually empty bar by the beach named Bebe. When Pico visits him for the summer, he has him help out as waiter while wearing a frilly pink apron. He introduces Tamotsu to his grandson Pico and suggests they spend time together.

- Chico

A brown haired boy who develops a sexual relationship with Pico. He is younger and less sexually experienced than Pico. He often plays outdoors in the nude and secretly watches his older sister masturbate. In most cases, Chico is the seme, despite his age, though his relationship with Pico is somewhat reversible. He lives with his sister in a large house in a secluded forest area.

- Chico's Older Sister

She takes care of Chico. She is tall, with dark-blue hair. After being seen masturbating by the boys through a crack in the ceiling, she is the indirect cause of their experimentation. She has a large collection of fetish outfits and sex toys that Pico and Chico use without her permission. She later masturbates around a corner from the boys when she finds them sexually engaged upon returning from the grocery store.

- Coco

An effeminate boy with long, black hair who Pico meets in the third episode. Coco has sexual relations with both Pico and Chico. After inadvertently causing some friction in their relationship, Coco decides to distance himself from Pico and Chico, though they find him again at Tokyo Tower. He is also the main uke of the three, but this can be reversed.

Heh. So. Enjoy.
