The Beatles' Ballads is a compilation album featuring a selection of ballad songs by The Beatles. The album was not released in the United States 10-14-1980, but in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Germany, Italy, India and Australia. In Australia, the album was a big success, spending 7 weeks at #1.

The cover art by "Patrick" (John Byrne) had been created in 1968 as a possible cover for what would become The Beatles (AKA the "White Album"). Its style and concept appears to support the original working title of A Doll's House.
