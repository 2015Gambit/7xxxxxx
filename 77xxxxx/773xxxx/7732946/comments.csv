DOOM and DOOM II games, making it the definitive collection of the
revolutionary games developed by id Software, the studio that pioneered
the first-person shooter genre.

Where is? I have only DOOM 3, DOOM 3:
Resurrection of Evil, and The Lost Mission in version DOOM.3.BFG.Edition.Cracked.Repack-ALI213. SKIDROW version downloading now."

and as you can guess by now. it not has a graphics details setting in this game (only resolution and AA setting). 

honestly, i think this is just a direct port from console version. or they gonna release a huge graphic update patch later like darksiders 2 did ?"

,TyMod,2012-10-18T03:23Z,I can tell just by your specs your most likely using a laptop or a low end desktop. Either way your computer most likely cannot run Doom 3. This game still has some high specs due to the super high res textures.
,Mucci1234,2012-10-18T03:23Z,the game works fine the only problem i have with it is that evry single gun sound is really soft like the shooting reoading sounds is anyone else haveing this problem cause i cant find a solution to it anywhere

First of all!!!  Thank you to the uploader!!

This torrent downloaded very fast and is running on Windows 7 x64 without any issues.  There are no viruses/trojans/loggers.  

Go to Google and search how to use a torrent file before saying it's broke.

Running it on an i7 990x, 16gb 1600 ram, x2 GTX 680's SLi, and a Asus Sabertooth x58 M/B.  No issues at all.

There seem to be enough seeders as i downloaded this in about 15 minutes.

So you needed all those specs on your pc to run a game from 2004 :P Like hooking up a new years rocket to an ICBM.

My point: hardware-masturbation is gay.

About the game: works perfectly!

My specs:

A shitty ass GT525m, and an i5-2450 2,5Ghz that still can play BF3 on High settings flawlessly.

and btw, I play on a very cheap laptop :P"
