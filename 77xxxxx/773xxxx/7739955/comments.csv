,neolectric,2012-10-19T06:43Z,"Not a DvD rip; R5 at best, HQ TS Cam at worst.  

Typical High Contrast Gausian blur quality cam shit.

Tinny audio.  Also has a large asian watermark.  Highly suggest downloading sample first if you are curious.

On a side note, I HATED this Peter Parker. Such a douchey hipster. But hey, I grew up with the Peter Parker in comic books and this is for today's darn kids with their loud Walkman's and Reebok Pumps."

,GeorgeMack,2012-10-22T07:50Z,Very appreciative of the upload. Thank you very much. I always seed the films the very least the volume i download. But in this case i just went to the folder and pressed shift and delete. Worst spiderman film. One of the worst possible comic book actors. Horrible script. Emma Stone is being wasted here. Directing from a 10 year old. Martin Sheen should be apologized to for being led to play in this parody. I couldn't even watch the whole thing. Thanks for the torrent so I wouldn't have to spend a dime on this crap. Sorry for not seeding this immense pile of dung.

You are a worthless bitch and we all own you. So keep your bandwidth and stay in your mom's basement while I rape her fat ass upstairs.

,GeorgeMack,2012-10-24T16:54Z,"In the year that produced The Avengers for me the best comic book based film to date this catastrophe of a film is not that much important. Because Spidey has been captured tons better before. The first Hulk was imho the worst comic book film - then i watched this ""gem"". Thank God it got redeemed in the next one. What's especially concerning and troubling is that they're planning to turn this into a franchise according to imdb. What I can honestly say is that I felt ripped off. Yeah I just downloaded the torrent and didn't pay a dime for the cinema - probably because i could smell the crap from a distance - but still i feel ripped off. Probably because some bozos where placed to make a film reboot on an iconic comic book hero, they fucked up quite a lot in the process, said ""ehh whatever dude"" along the way and this insulting piece of crap came out of it.

,JamsBand,2012-10-29T21:01Z,So many haters. This movie was actually better than the other boring ones and had decent acting and good action in it. I thought Tobey Maguire was a fag in the Spider-Man series. And Emma Stone is such a better actor and SO MUCH beter looking than Kirsten Dunst. Good movie.
,Omega420,2012-10-31T02:34Z,"@ useitright your a moron! some times they need to start over, for one reason some actors who plays a main part is an asshole and wants alot more money...and 2nd fact if you was a true Spider-man comic fan, then you should know that Peter Parker never had his own webbing he always had to make it, and it made for good story writing cuz he could run out in a fight or while web swinging they just FIXED something they messed up in the first movie!

Anyway thanks for the Upload! i wanted to see the DVD quality for a min!"

A remake is telling the same story again while a reboot tells a new story with many of the same characters and setting. And after the shitfest that was Spider-Man 3 a reboot was definitely needed.
Secondly: Not producing webs isn't ""bullshit"". What is ""bullshit"" is having Spider-Man produce web organically. Seriously, if you have ever even glanced at a Spider-Man comic you should know that his (or at least the main, prime universe Spider-Man) webs have always come from Peter's own hand made shooters and not from his body."
