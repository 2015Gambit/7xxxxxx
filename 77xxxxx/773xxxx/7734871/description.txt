CBR 64kbps read by Tony Roberts. Mixed reviews.

I knew Peter was coming into the books as Stone's son but this story really changed things up. While the story took some interesting turns I think it moved a little too quickly for me. I would have liked to see things take just a shade longer than they did. But who knows what Stuart Woods has in store for the next one. We shall see.
