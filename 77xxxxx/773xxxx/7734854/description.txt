If It Makes You Happy

When Zoe reads about her fellow classmates'
accomplishments in her Alumni magazine, she
is upset that they list her as "retired" and
invites the reporter to BlueBell for an
interview. However, Zoe has a hard time
convincing the reporter that she actually has
a thriving medical practice in BlueBell -
that is, until she comes across a rare and
potentially serious disease. Trying to be
considerate of Lemon's feelings, George
informs her that he is going out on a date,
making her feel that she too needs to find a
date. Meanwhile, Lemon and Lavon both find
themselves in competition with their nemesis
Ruby.
