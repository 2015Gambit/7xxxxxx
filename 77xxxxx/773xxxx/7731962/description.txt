Notes

Enjoy this DVDSCR.. there is no imdb rls date in theaters for it

Did our thing.. Turned out real nice
Resize, denoise, slight RGB adjustment and slight sharpen.. enjoy
Does have occasional watermark that pops up at top decided not to blur as its
only onscreen for a few seconds each time and doesnt happen often..
