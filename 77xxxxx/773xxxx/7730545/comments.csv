,vatney94,2012-10-15T21:54Z,i cant wait for the crack cuz i really don't want to spend 60 more bucks just to have this game on pc when i already have it on xbox
,icetech,2012-10-15T22:28Z,Exactly... there are some nice discussions about it on the official forums.. i would buy the game again but they wont give credit for DLC content that was already bought on peoples consoles... i just hope someone releases DLC for pc version also:)
,dilinwe,2012-10-16T02:17Z,"so, this is basicaly the fussion between gh and gp?"
,dilinwe,2012-10-16T02:42Z,"segun estube leyendo se necesita este cable:

,icetech,2012-10-16T04:01Z,Not sure what GP is.. but with this you can use any guitar you want.. and play along with real songs with dynamic learning/levels.. i have been playing for a year on ps3.. and its decent EXCEPT extremely slow DLC content.. wouldn't take much for another company to own this market
,dilinwe,2012-10-16T14:49Z,"@icetech

,icetech,2012-10-16T17:37Z,"Nice, looks like a crack is out.. just need to see if it works:)"
,Aerionix,2012-10-17T00:03Z,Well this is legit at least.  Thanks for the upload.  Hopefully a decent p2p crack comes along in the next couple of days.  Hate this period tho.  Every pedo with an ankle bracelet will be posting fake cracks in between googling Amanda Todd's boobs.  Ain't that right Proxy?

,drymoused,2012-10-17T08:46Z,Where's the Amiga version? Don't tell me Ubisoft has once again passed the technically superior Amiga by!
,icetech,2012-10-17T14:19Z,"mac... teehee.... ""it just works"" so try it out:)
but seriously.. ubi took over a year after the console release to get the pc version out. It was supposed to be out 11 months ago.. don't expect much else from them.. the DLC release rate is SLOOWWWW also... just horrible treatment of their customers"
,Alexx237,2012-10-18T00:00Z,"been waiting for this, by the way, is this game supposed to work with Asio4All with a external sound card instead of RealTone?"
,olivier_d10,2012-10-18T02:42Z,We need a crack :(
,Aerionix,2012-10-18T04:11Z,"Can't say with certainty, but I dont think the asio drivers are required.  Think that was just for amplitube and similar stuff.   Rocksmith should just sync in with the primary sound driver.  The cable does get recognized as the ""real tone"".  Haven't seen anything from people playing the retail that needed to mess with the extra drivers so here's hoping.  Isn't a huge deal but ya, switching it back and forth was a painn"
,icetech,2012-10-18T05:01Z,"I played the demo on pc using my ps3 cable, no drivers or anything to deal with, just plugged in and played.. just need a damn crack now:)"
,fumbles69,2012-10-18T10:57Z,SEED BRO SEED!!!!
,Alexx237,2012-10-18T13:28Z,I'm just asking because I can't even afford the cable right now xD I already have an external sound card that I use for amplitube
,fumbles69,2012-10-18T13:57Z,anyone find a crack yet? not worth seeding if people cant use it right?
,icetech,2012-10-18T14:47Z,"naw.. there was a fake crack uploaded, hoping the person that did that got assraped"
,fumbles69,2012-10-18T15:36Z,off topic but isn't there a keygen program called icetech for making keys?
,fumbles69,2012-10-18T15:38Z,also i tried the demo out while we're waiting for our crack/keygen...unfortunately it does not run on integrated graphics (not that i expected it to)
,nonamerus,2012-10-18T17:11Z,"@fumble69 I'm running on mobile integrated graphics and I can run the demo version just fine on medium settings with every background program turned off.

And I don't think asio is required , the RealTone cable has it's own sound driver now.
But I still can't run amplitube or GR5 without sacrificing every other sound device .-."

,ChocoboDreams,2012-10-18T20:04Z,I have integrated graphics and the demo runs fine. 
,icetech,2012-10-18T23:41Z,@non thanks for that update.. and holy crap that site is king of the popups:)
,MushyMouth,2012-10-19T00:04Z,that site is fake
,MushyMouth,2012-10-19T00:09Z,"Skidrows Official site is at skidrow/games/com

in their chat they said they have no plans on releasing rocksmith

All other sites are fake"
,icetech,2012-10-19T03:55Z,yeah kinda figured after i went there:( ah well.. will keep playing on the console 
,dilinwe,2012-10-19T05:23Z,the site is fake but there is a lot of games too!! xd
,drymoused,2012-10-19T07:49Z,"Yeah, and lots of malware too!"
,Wh33lz,2012-10-19T12:39Z,Anyone know of a working keygen/crack yet? I really wanna play :(
,Skinote,2012-10-19T15:04Z,"Just buy the game! There's an Amazon promo code right now for 25% off the digital download version, which is pretty nice. What I really want to see is the DLC get uploaded as a torrent, that would be great...

I can confirm that it only works with the Rocksmith cable"
,medalcue,2012-10-19T16:18Z,Whats the amazon promo code dude?
,t0d,2012-10-19T16:29Z,Does anyone know of a working crack? I don't know why there isn't more crack support for this game... there seems to be no lack of demand.
,Wiggly86,2012-10-19T17:05Z,Im tired of the demo songs and cant afford the game atm. If anyone knows of a working crack theres plenty of internet credz to be had!
,Skinote,2012-10-19T17:42Z,"The Amazon promo code I mentioned is: SQRLUVOC on 10/19/2012. It's a deal this week because their regular games download deal sold out. I expect it to end either Saturday 10/20 or Sunday 10/21, so jump on it if you want it!"
,icetech,2012-10-19T19:49Z,"ski, the problem is there is no way to know if even the dlc's are released will they work with a legit version of the game.. If they would give me credit for my ps3 dlc's i already bought i would buy the game for pc... but fook em..."
,dfltxbe,2012-10-19T21:29Z,"@t0d
The reason for the lack of crack support might be due to the fact that you still need the cable to play the game, maybe the crackers don't realize how many people have the cable from the console version (and that its the same cable)"
,t0d,2012-10-19T21:58Z,"@dfltxbe Yeah, valid point. It's definitely the same cable though."
,piratefrs,2012-10-19T22:05Z,"i might be able to make a crack, altough I do not have access to the files, i need the manifest file from Steam/depotcache folder.
the one i need is 205199_5118923319160099634.manifest
i would appreciate that if anyone that has bought the game through steam could upload that file.
thanks"
,Skinote,2012-10-19T22:41Z,"Well, I've got it legit on steam at this point, so I can test out DLC compatibility if they're ever released. It would be excellent if you just had to copy resource files to the right folder. I hope it eventually gets modded, too. "
,Michaelcr13,2012-10-19T22:47Z,Any way to message the guy who uploaded this? would probably be our best bet of getting that file
,Michaelcr13,2012-10-19T22:49Z,@Skinote any way you could upload it since you bought the game?
,itsover8000,2012-10-20T02:55Z,"I have a realtone cable I just need the key to activate this on steam. I don't like the slow loading times on the ps3, this should be much faster."
,piratefrs,2012-10-20T03:18Z,"@itsover8000 can you give me the hardware id of the cable?(you can see it on driver property/Details/Hardware Ids on device manager)

thanks"
,BestRbx,2012-10-20T03:37Z,"@itsover,
same here but for xbox. I essentially live on the computer, so I rarely use it down in the basement. It's much better to have it for PC."

lets wait for someone that bought it on steam to upload the 205199_5118923319160099634.manifest file, so we can extract the files from installer.

I'll create a torrent as soon as it's done..

Skidrow seems to not want to crack Rocksmith.. and I refuse to buy the DLC's (even though I reallly want some of the songs) because 10 bucks for 3 songs is wayy to expensive..

Hope some of you guys manage to crack the game (and the DLC's)"

,kas006,2012-10-20T21:41Z,"ust to let you all know, you need the Real Tone Cable which is only included in the original game. No matter if you crack it you wont be able to play it without the cable. "
,Replenish,2012-10-20T22:49Z,"Any progress made yet?

Also: is it REQUIRED you use the Real Tone Cable? Or do offbrand guitar-usb cables work? Anyone with the demo/real game that can confirm?"
,kas006,2012-10-20T22:59Z,Afaik none has managed to get a home made cable to work. Offbrand usb cables doesnt seem to work either.
,spartan18,2012-10-20T23:06Z,As far as i know it takes a realtone cable or at least something that shows up in windows with the same ID as the realtone (some people are working on that). From what i have read in the comments a lot of people posting here have the cable already from a console version. I for one was going to just buy the pc version on its original release date then it got delayed and delayed again so i finally broke down and got a console version. I would love to be able to use other interfaces i think ubi should have allowed it to use any interface then just recommended there cable. I have a Presonus firestudio tube and the tube preamp would sound great with my guitar but i don't want to go through the trouble of patching though there cable. Anyway Good Luck to whoever is patching i can't wait saw that the DLC is on steam but i can't believe that all of it would cost $300+.
