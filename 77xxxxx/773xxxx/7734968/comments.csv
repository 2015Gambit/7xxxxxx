,brittanylee,2012-10-17T06:12Z,I don't trust this... Anyone find a virus?
,acsmith1972,2012-10-17T06:14Z,You don't even need to look for a virus. It's not a trusted source and it's only 57mb. I really doubt it's for real.

my connection is very slow,,,,,,"
,acsmith1972,2012-10-17T06:57Z,"So once again: if it looks like it might be a bad file, it probably is. That sounds like some dumbass sitting there with their cell phone tripod mounted recording it in the lowest resolution possible. You could have at least set it to 1280x720. "
,clipseo,2012-10-17T07:21Z,"you can watch it without downloading it.

,dexsore,2012-10-17T07:21Z,"someone, please make an acceptable torrent."
,clipseo,2012-10-17T07:22Z,"also im not those people that try and get you to go to thier site, im just a guy who wanted to watch the debate cause i missed it and instead of downloading this file i did some googling and found it at this site"
,clipseo,2012-10-17T07:24Z,you can watch it online without downloading it. just google it
,AlexLibman,2012-10-18T14:42Z,"Everyone knows you can find these debates on MSM and SpyOnYouTube-like sites - no need to bring this up.  We need torrents like this so as to build a more decentralized and self-reliant Internet culture that is less prone to potential censorship and other foul play.  Legal P2P traffic helps legitimize P2P protocols and keep ISP's from blocking it.  So huge kudos to everyone who uploads and seeds quality video.

PS: Obama is a socialist thug who would turn USA into another Argentina."
