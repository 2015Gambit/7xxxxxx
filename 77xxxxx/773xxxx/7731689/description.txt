Melissa Harris-Perry; Saturday, October 13, 2012.

So rather than asking those people in a fury, "WHY HAVEN'T YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND, DUDE/LADY?!?!", today Mellisa explored some of the things that could help sway their vote in these final days. Naturally, there are people who are their direct opposites folks who have voted early, in states like Ohio. Well, in today's edition of This Week in Voter Suppression!{Trademark}, they brought some fresh news on what extreme Republican lawmakers and state officials are going to in order to block people from voting early.

They assessed the cultural and social impact of an Obama second term on African Americans, and take a look at school desegregation through busing. And Mellisa had a Foot Soldier who is brilliant!
