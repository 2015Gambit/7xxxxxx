That's it.. If you guys got one of these, post it on torrents. Alternatively, if you buy one of the above and upload it. In either case, I'll upload 4 Flemings of your choice for each one. Lets get this stuff on the web guys!"
,torrentb,2012-11-03T20:41Z,"really great upload, thank you. if you could upload contracts and torts that would be tremendous, and civ. pro 2, but I suppose that is less of an imminent necessity"
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-04T22:12Z,"Okay I will but no one is willing to buy and upload:
Flemings Agency and Partnership
Flemings Constitutional Law II

??? If I upload Contracts and Torts it would be cool if someone would buy and upload just one of those.."
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-05T08:10Z,"Torts I here:

,will409,2012-11-18T03:37Z,"please upload civil procedure 2 for the rest of it
have a nice day"
,will409,2012-11-18T03:49Z,please upload civil procedure 2 thanks
,RilesObrien,2012-11-18T06:19Z,"i believe there's a sample of ""con law 2"" over on kickass since you were asking about that one."
,RilesObrien,2012-11-19T11:18Z,"Some of thought you wanted Con Law 2.
What seems to be the problem?"
,will409,2012-11-19T21:36Z,I guess you are not interested in the material I offered. I even considered putting up about a gigabyte of con law material up on kick ass for you. I'm moving on. I'm just not going to ask anymore and not worry about it anymore. Good luck with your studies.
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-25T22:47Z,"I couldn't find it on kickass. What's a sample? I want the whole con law ii, fyi."
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-25T22:48Z,post link if you upload and I'll upload the rest of the series. No joke.
,will409,2012-11-26T00:05Z,"The whole thing is up now.

Piratebay won't allow a link from kick ass so look up Constitutional Law 2

This will only be up temporarily-- Ms.H9
I now wait for Civil Procedure 2.
I hope you are a person of your word. "
