,Lebada3,2012-10-16T01:37Z,Thanks. This should be perfect. Those SBS rips suck. 
,OmniusPrime,2012-10-16T03:20Z,Be aware ISOs may not play on PS3 or recent-model Blu-Ray players due to Cinavia audio watermark protection. I can't even stream rips/cams to my PS3 any more.

,_j0urn3ym4n_,2012-11-15T02:23Z,Seems to be Region A/1 - not playable on my European Blu Ray Player (just for info)
