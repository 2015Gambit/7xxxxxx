,nate_drake,2012-10-20T05:31Z,You are welcome guys. Rebecca coming up soon.
,dawideksl,2012-10-20T09:40Z,"Anyone downloaded? Please, people - seed. i'm stuck at 59%. When i'm downloading something i'm seeding it for at least a week!"
,dawideksl,2012-10-20T22:28Z,Please seed! Alicia/Carisma/Sheeran not working - no seeds!
,hobkien,2012-10-21T23:29Z,"I've seeded 30gb of Mumfor & Sons and 16gb of Alicia, please seed until someone else has it complete, I have no problem helping you to seed this but I need it all, I'm stuck at 62%."
,nate_drake,2012-10-22T05:59Z,"Sorry guys for some reason from time to time uTorrent fucking blows and just stops seeding even if all variables and settings seem to indicate it's ""ready to roll"". If by tomorrow I continue to see the trend I will have to do a reset and other things like I had to do with Muse, in order to keep seeding fine.

But don't despair, i'm not leaving you on the blue, just technical issues get on the way but I always compromise to (obviously) seed these puppies well so you guys can take from then on.

,dawideksl,2012-10-26T10:57Z,Is rebecca coming? :) Cheers!
,nate_drake,2012-10-29T03:50Z,"IMPORTANT:
Just like I noted in the OP my job here is done and I've stopped seeding this.
So it's now up to you guys and the file has been deleted from my HD."
