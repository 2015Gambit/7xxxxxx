Hi pals!

Nostalgic of the pre-intel OS 9 old trash-can floating on right corner of the desktop, showing the growing amount of items waiting for deletion and their sudden collapse on using the trash command? Wishing to get it back out of the dock default location in OSX? Then, you can use Bin-it 1.6 which works nicely on any Mac OSX version, from intel Tiger 10.4 up to Mountain Lion 10.8. The app allows customization of the bin theme, of what is shown by the desktop icon and automatic launching at opening of the user's session if chosen. 

When unzipping the package, you will find a .dmg disk-image containing the app. you just have to drag & drop into the Applications folder ; and a Read-me .rtf file showing the instructions to selecting the default preferences and providing an universal license key.

Enjoy!
