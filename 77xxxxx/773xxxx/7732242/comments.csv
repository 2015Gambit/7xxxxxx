,sadg0d,2012-10-18T19:57Z,Worse fucking movie I've ever seen! It felt like an abortion!!! Thanks for UL though!
,PineappleStarz,2012-10-20T11:58Z,yes its horrible
,mossrite,2012-10-20T14:47Z,"Yes great quality but I have to admit, a shit movie. I love a good cult classic, Tarantino, etc but this was a total waste of time. I dunno , maybe it was over my head but I don't think so"
,pacocrowley,2012-10-22T03:55Z,Are you seriously saying that this movie is bad because some shocking scenes? from the performances alone this is a highly recommended piece of work. Personally I could say that this is a must watch; you be the judge.
,speedern77,2012-10-26T22:13Z,"Thanx for the ul dude.

,bazzjazz,2012-11-19T14:20Z,"Just a word of warning, this file would play on my LG TV but the audio was unsupported cos its DTS. No fault of the uploader, just a quirk of my TV and proably many others. I am having to covert it to watch. V: 10 A: ?"
,yogdagon,2012-11-24T19:00Z,"V-10, A-8, M-5, Thanx.
