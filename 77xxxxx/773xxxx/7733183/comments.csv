,yamato74,2012-10-17T09:16Z,not working for me... crash the trainer after I launch the game.
,hexc0der,2012-10-17T17:05Z,"@yamato74 The trainer has no problems at all and works fine. Please check your computer first before saying that it isn't working. Also, if what you are saying is true then why are there 42 people seeding the torrent?
Thank you guys for seeding and letting other people enjoy the trainer and the fast download speed."

no viruses, scanned with MSE, it's all clean.
about the trainer music, unfortunately there is no mute button, but you can still mute it by opening the sound mixer, and muting wmlxplayer or something.
great torrent. fast. thanks."
