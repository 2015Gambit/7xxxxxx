,TxJag,2012-10-19T06:21Z,@Aimier_59 I highly doubt I will be able to do that. Depends if they are available digitally and even if they were they are going to be scanned and even with the best scanner out there it's going to be dodgy on the quality. So I have to pass on that. I'm sorry. I prefer quality over quantity.
