,wantonone0530,2012-10-18T02:19Z,"Exactly how is this ""remastered?"""
[T],rjordan21,2012-10-18T02:25Z,Oi!
[T],rjordan21,2012-10-18T02:47Z,"Remastered by Tim Young, under the direction of original producer Chris Thomas, using the once lost original master tapes that were  rediscovered during the recent move from Virgin Records to Universal Music Catalogue in January 2012."
,wantonone0530,2012-10-18T05:03Z,"I'm looking right at the artwork you provided in this torrent. Sure, it says copyright 2012, but nowhere does it say remastered or any such commentary.

However, Thank You rjordan for providing the legitmate information. Carry on!"

,johnny4242,2012-10-18T07:12Z,Anyone know if it sounds better than the Toshiba Japan Black Triangle 32VD 1011 release?
,Bjellesau,2012-10-18T09:12Z,"Thanks for sharing MrShite.

And thanks for disc 2 & 3 also. A very interesting package.
This remastered cd has a much more lower dynamic range (DR9) compared to the Black Triangle version (DR13) (A HUGE difference). I can not say which sounds BEST, it will be individual likings. For me, dynamics are very important, so I usually preper the earlier versions. The Black Triangel version are clearly more open in sound spectrum and scores high on dynamics. Definately better in my ears. I can not say anything about your ears.

Anyway, this box of 3 cd's is worth gold. Thanks for sharing again. "

,Flyfisher61,2012-10-18T22:23Z,Many Thanks!
,Sten1972,2012-11-05T12:22Z,"I actually prefer this over the Black Triangle version (DR13) wich I think has too much treble and lacks bass. This sounds more like the old vinyl, raw and with a lot of punch!
:)"
,Sten1972,2012-11-10T09:58Z,I compared this with the Black Triangle release again yesterday and I can't really decide wich one I prefer. But a mix of them both would be the ultimate version!
