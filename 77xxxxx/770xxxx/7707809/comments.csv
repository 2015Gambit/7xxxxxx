Hopefully a decent version of this will pop up at some point soon, but this ain't it."

,biff_stroganoff,2012-10-10T10:05Z,"Nope.  Not fullscreen; it's a 1.78 image (approximately) compressed into fullscreen.  It's watchable, I suppose, but that's the best that can be said for it."

,biff_stroganoff,2012-10-15T22:26Z,I don't have that particular player; maybe that'll help.  Thanks!
