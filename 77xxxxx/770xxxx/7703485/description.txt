    PERSON OF INTEREST stars Jim Caviezel, Emmy Award winner Michael Emerson and Academy Award nominated and current Emmy Award nominee Taraji P. Henson in a crime thriller about a presumed-dead former CIA agent who teams up with a mysterious billionaire to prevent violent crimes by using their own brand of vigilante justice. ReeseΓÇÖs special training in covert operations appeals to Finch, a software genius who invented a program that uses pattern recognition to identify people about to be involved in violent crimes.

    Using state-of-the-art surveillance technology, the two work outside of the law using ReeseΓÇÖs adept skills and FinchΓÇÖs unlimited wealth to unravel the mystery of the person of interest and stop the crime before it happens. ReeseΓÇÖs actions draw the attention of the NYPD, including homicide detective Carter, and Fusco, a cop whom Reese uses to his advantage. With infinite crimes to investigate, Reese and Finch find that the right person, with the right information, at the right time, can change everything.
