[V],Daman4Iife,2012-10-07T05:38Z,i will upload 1080p tomorrow 
,cmryan821,2012-10-07T06:50Z,Ah cool. Thank you for all the great uploads you've provided.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-10-07T12:38Z,"the file size is huge because the Opening for this anime is ridiculous, its the definition of Bit whore seriously.
Ive never seen an anime take so much bits like this does.

this anime cannot be encoded to anything below 400MB because it will ruin the OPening."
,chemic_zen,2012-10-07T15:48Z,"Oh wow an english dual audio. Didn't even know one existed. Thanks for this Daman. But this is only half, so when are the rest coming?"
,HaloGuy,2012-10-07T23:04Z,"Dude, where are the remaining 12 episodes?? :/"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-10-07T23:31Z,"Halo guy, funimation only released 12 episodes so far, Please research before asking questions like this.

it could be months before Part 2 comes out."
,HaloGuy,2012-10-09T17:29Z,"Daman4Iife, srry dude, didn't notice that you were uploading funimation releases.
I usually look up on anidb to find more details, since I like original Jap audio."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-10-10T00:51Z,Is all Good Halo. Episode 13-24/25 should be out by December or early 2013
,chendrix318,2012-10-14T16:27Z,"Hey Daman4Iife I was just wondering if you will be uploading the DVD rip version of this anime if you have it by chance?

(I really want to watch this anime, but my computer doesn't like playing 720p or 1080p videos.) :/"
,mooserocka,2012-10-22T00:14Z,I dunno why anyone would complain about subbed anime. There ARE SOOO MANY god damn sub anime uploaded on this site and other torrent sites. Daman is one of the first people to finnaly bring dubbed. HE seriously is THE MAN. If he wernt a man i would kiss him for bringing joy to my life thru new anime torrents. Im going to make a few requests on his newest post to see if he will ablige thier all new anime so im sure he wont mind putting them up. Once again daman your amazing.
