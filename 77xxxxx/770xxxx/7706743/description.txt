Post Date: 23 September 2012

Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson is frequently one of the
more outspoken ΓÇô and scientifically literate ΓÇô guests on HBOΓÇÖs
Real Time with Bill Maher. So what happens when the controversial
Maher stops by StarTalk Radio? A rational discussion about some
of todayΓÇÖs most important issues.

Along with co-host Astrobiologist Dr. David Grinspoon, Neil and
Bill talk about climate change, squeezing into BillΓÇÖs electric
car (a Tesla roadster), the value of space exploration, and
whether it is possible to reconcile religion and science.

YouΓÇÖll also learn a few things about Carl Sagan you didnΓÇÖt
know ΓÇô including speculation about why Harvard denied him
tenure ΓÇô from David, who grew up calling Sagan ΓÇ£Uncle CarlΓÇ¥,
and Bill, who took SaganΓÇÖs astronomy course at Cornell.

Part 2
Post Date: 7 October 2012

According to co-host astrobiologist Dr. David Grinspoon, ΓÇ£Science
thrives on controversy,ΓÇ¥ and in Part 2 of host Neil deGrasse TysonΓÇÖs
interview with Bill Maher, controversy is definitely on the menu.

From the value of dissent in scientific progress to the dangers of
dishonest science fueled by hidden agendas, the trio address climate
change, the death penalty, abortion, assisted suicide, legalization
of marijuana, prostitution and whether science can inform morality
laws.

Believe it or not, Bill Maher actually takes a time out from
attacking the Tea Party-led Republican war on science to actually
say something nice about Republicans. DonΓÇÖt worry, though ΓÇô youΓÇÖll
get plenty of opportunity to disagree with Bill, whichever side of
the fence youΓÇÖre on!
