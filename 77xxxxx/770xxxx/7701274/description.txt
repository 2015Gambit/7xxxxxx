Hakam seems to be a gangster on the run with friend Valentino, but has to say goodbye to a couple of females first - Tina Latour and Nicolette. They 'borrow' horses from the baroness (Monica Orsini). Hakam falls ill at his hideout and is 'nursed' back to health by Beatrice Poggi. They then raid the baron's house while he and his wife are at dinner. They get the baroness to show them where the riches are, but there aren't any; so they take payment in kind from the baroness who leaves with them. Finally Hakam marries Beatrice and there is a wedding party orgy involving all the girls plus Hakam, Valentino and two extra males, one of whom is Francesco Malcolm. Little rhyme or reason to the story but Monica Orsini makes it all worth while for the viewer as well as the gangsters.
