The Rumble 2012 - Bill O'Reilly Vs. John Stewart - XviD
Oct 6 - 2012

There are many versions of this video all over the internet.
And so far all of them are the jerky 12 to 15 frames per second live feed.
This is also one of those live feeds, so don't expect anything better.

This was a 720p mp4 from you_tube.
Then re-encoded to work on old XviD players
The very blurry first 14 seconds was trimmed off.
Frame rate was changed to 29.97
The volume was raised 8db

Sample provided so you can decide if this is something you want.
