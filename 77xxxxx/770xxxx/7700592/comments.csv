,fall1en,2012-10-06T08:03Z,"Thanks for this!

@ bob the noob! There's nothing wrong with sceneline files!"
,glowme,2012-10-06T08:33Z,5.1 or 2ch?
,EXPERIMENTONGOD,2012-10-06T14:25Z,"@glowme

It's 5.1 (6 channels) at 448 Kbps (you can easily check that using Mediainfo on the file after downloading a few Mbs).

@Drew4201 and fall1en

Sceneline releases are shit:

- Moronic, retarded, unfunny filenames
- Spam (.txt files)
- Sample (useless for most people and makes the torrent bigger)
- Rars (again useless for most people and a waste of time because of unrar)"

- moronic, retarded, unfunny filenames
so...who the fuck cares about the rar names anyway...after the unzip everything is perfect..so stop bitching for something you get for free.
- spam
what spam? they don't ask for money, you should be glad.
- sample
so sample is something bad? It's the best thing if you wanna a quick download to know the quality
If you don't wanna sample just don't download it
uTorrent offers to choose
- rars
Yes...10 seconds to unzip is too much for you..you can't handle it :O"
,MatroskinCat,2012-10-07T12:21Z,The worst thing about rar'd torrents is that they don't live long.

I'm pretty sure a lot of people care, and you also get the file ""for free"" with this PublicHD torrent but it doesn't have that retarded bullshit

- what spam? they don't ask for money, you should be glad.

PublicHD doesn't ask for money either, you can visit their site (which is really good) because they have the URL in the description, no need for more fucking .txt spam

- so sample is something bad? It's the best thing if you wanna a quick download to know the quality If you don't wanna sample just don't download it uTorrent offers to choose

PublicHD's torrents don't make you waste time deselecting the sample in the client. Also you already know the quality as it is consistent with previous episdodes from the same release group, which makes it pointless (not to mention that with good internet access you can get the 1.45gb torrent in about 15 mins).

- Yes...10 seconds to unzip is too much for you..you can't handle it :O

Of course it's better to not waste 10 seconds, what's your point?"
