RoboForm Pro Desktop and RoboForm2Go v7.8.3.5 ┬⌐2012 with patch by novice2 / RU-Board [brought to you by onttm]

RoboForm - Easy and Secure password manager and information vault. Remembers passwords, logs you into web sites and fills forms with one-click.
RoboForm2Go - Secure password manager that works directly from USB key. Take your passwords wherever you go and experience one-click logins.

Just install your choice of RoboForm (Desktop vs Portable) and run the patch (read the patch txt file forarguments[/url] to patch Portable). No need to close RoboForm before patching; the patch will kill the processes for you.  All you need to do is run the RoboForm TaskBar Icon after patching.

Enjoy!

[b][color=Red]NOTE: To date, there is no universal patch for roboform-x64.dll[/color][/b], so you will have to continue using a 32-bit browser or pay for a legitimate Roboform license to enable 64-bit browser support.  When I find a reliable patch/solution I will package it in a new torrent release.
