The Courtney Novels are a series of thirteen novels published between 1964 and 2009 by Wilbur Smith.
The 'Courtney' novels trace the fortunes, and misfortunes, of this sprawling, ambitious family, from the dawn of the eighteenth century to the late twentieth century, starting with When The Lion Feeds.

The Triumph of the Sun brings the Courtneys and the Ballantynes together, in Egypt, and Assegai continues the Courtney saga in East Africa just prior to the outbreak of World War I.
