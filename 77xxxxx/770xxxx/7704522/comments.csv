,joshman598,2012-10-11T00:31Z,"Hey tpb_4_ever, I'm having a problem. I downloaded the torrent, and I dragged the 2 folders into my railworks folder, overrighted what was asked, and i went in game, If I try to do a mission with sherman hill, as soon as it starts loading, it crash's and gives me ""Something bad has happened, Would you like to save a dump file?""

Please help! Thank you!"
,tpb_4_ever,2012-10-12T23:11Z,"hello Josh,

You will need a cracked railworks copy in order to make sure the non legit addons work. Head over to our forums in case you need further help :)
Link is in description"
