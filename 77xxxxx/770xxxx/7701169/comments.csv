,Spankinator94,2012-10-09T01:57Z,"the english subtitles are stupid, some transelations are dead wrong, some are innaccurate; used other words...

Just don't use the subtitles included lol"
,Spankinator94,2012-10-09T03:17Z,"It's not out of sync on PC, i'm using VLC that's confirmed, bluray quality too"
,godo12345,2012-10-09T04:39Z,but it is just 98 mins. how come?
,stanleyapple03,2012-10-09T09:30Z,not 1080 quality. pixelated
,Str4nJer,2012-10-09T10:27Z,"Audio is definitely is out of sync while played from HDD straight to a new model Samsung TV, not alot but enough to ruin in for me. Re-download for me :( Thanks anyway YIFY"
,SwedishJackass,2012-10-10T01:08Z,"please stop saying it's 1080p when it's clearly not. the 3 screens you attached looked like dvdrip quality ffs, other than that, great work lol honestly"
,elitecrusher,2012-10-10T04:17Z,"Hey YIFY, Man your movies are amazing and perfect. Very professionally done!! I upload your 1080p movies onto my phone and watch them threw 1080p HD on my phone with my Beats Audio headphones. UNREAL MAN!!!"
,crunketz,2012-10-10T04:56Z,In reference to it being out of sink. Currently dl so I dont know yet but I recently had the same issue with Prometheus and it did ruin it for me. I noticed it worked fine on my pc w/vlc though. Then I dl That's my boy from different uploader and had same issue. I like to put my movies on a flash drive and watch from me samsung. I checked that movie befor hand on vlc and no out of sink.So I just rewinded it a bit and then it was in sync. If out of sync in same method you might try it.
,crunketz,2012-10-10T04:59Z,Either way much thanks to YIFY for all the great ups. Dont see how anyone could complain about quality though on anything I've dl yet. Im sure this is just as good.
,fridens,2012-10-10T10:50Z,"No thx UL!

Audio out of sync....

Ljud osynkat...."
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-10-18T11:45Z,"God some people are retarded. To people claiming this isn't 1080p... its not exactly, but close too. But you are complaining that its not 1080p because the quality is low...

THATS NOT WHAT 1080p MEANS! its simple resolution dickwad. I could turn a single pixel image into a 1080p image, and it would be true 1080p.

And the guy who put in on the phone - you are not watching 1080p video. You phone doesn't support 1080p. It will be downscaled to fit to your screen. You would be better off downloading a better fitting version, because a video encoder will give a better image than your phone scaling it.

And can someone give me an accurate description of the quality. Does it or does it not have audio sync problems, and is the quality less than desired for this size file?"
,Shtefu,2012-10-20T06:36Z,"The image is great, it spikes at certain moments but the audio is horrible, totally out of sync. And the SUBTITLES included are weird from the start. Sometimes it's not translated in english, sometimes it's plain bad... made up.

Sorry YIFY, I usually get stuff from you but this one is bad :("
,Shtefu,2012-10-20T06:41Z,I'm using KMPlayer btw.
,Amafule10,2012-10-20T18:15Z,"I think YIFY and the other uploaders of this movie haven't explained what is going on.
This is a Russian copy that somehow they got so much time before the official dvd release date. There are no russian subs or dub, there is nothing to bother you in this copy. Only the logo of the expendables and the location names that appear on the screen are in Russian nothing else.
I enjoyed the movie, I think there is no reason to wait for an american copy but I think the uploaders should inform us about the above. I didn't use the subtitles file so I don't know about it.
That's all, sorry for my bad english."
,kermit123,2012-10-27T23:09Z,"Thanks for a great upload.
The audio was off just a microsecond or two, did not bother me. The subs are really bad but these work:

,dvdgeek,2012-11-12T04:29Z,"Do A Little Homework before leaving Non-Sense as feedback. Very few movies are exactly 1920x1080p, depends on aspect ratio, often the black bars are cropped by transcoders to save space. Unless a person knows what they are doing, most encoders do this by default. YiFi, you do exceptional work for the final file size! TY! "
,Taliyuna,2012-11-15T16:34Z,"thank you YIFI you're awesome :D 
never failed to amaze us grettings from Serbia
