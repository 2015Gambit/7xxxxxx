Star Wars The Clone Wars

Season 5 Episode 1 "Revival"

Darth Maul and Savage Opress steal a fortune of republic credits, and bribe a squad of pirates to take down a pirate stronghold run by Hondo. They attack Hondo's stronghold but Obi-Wan, accompanied by Jedi Master Adi Gallia, intervene, and in the battle that follows Savage kills Adi. Hondo ambushes the squad of pirates and wins their loyalty back, while Obi-Wan fights Savage and Maul and injures Savage. The brothers flee to their ship under fire from Hondo and the pirates, but launch the escape pod mid flight as the ship is damaged. Obi-Wan returns to Coruscant, where the Chancellor informs him that the brothers are of no importance compared to the Separatists, and no further action should be taken on their behalf.
