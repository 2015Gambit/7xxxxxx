Ben has invited Jenna over to his house for a surprise. Jenna thinks it must have something to do with her best friend, who is also Ben's wife. But she isn't there, and Ben calls Jenna into the master bedroom. He bought Jenna a brand new pair of expensive shoes! She doesn't know if she should accept them, but he insists, and helps her try them on. They feel fantastic, and when he starts to kiss and caress her leg, she gets swept away.
