,aabunko78,2012-10-07T00:38Z,"works on my FLT release with update 1 by FLTDOX

Great update thanks!

If you have the FLT release and lost your save game, just go to
‘C:Users(your login name)AppDataLocalFLTSteam208500 remote’
copy your save games and paste over on
‘C:Users(your login name)AppDataLocalSKIDROW208500Storage’
should have your save games back. not sure if ’208500′ may be a different number on your system"
,philoz494,2012-10-07T00:44Z,"Cannot find my save game directory, already lost you on the '' AppDataLocal ''"
,fotis246,2012-10-07T00:47Z,You first installed the update 1 from FLT and then update 2 to 5 from Skidrow?
,philoz494,2012-10-07T00:47Z,I dont use steam btw...
,aabunko78,2012-10-07T01:14Z,"yes, had the FLT release first, then used the update 1 by FLTDOX

sorry, comment section does not allow backslash, here is the directory. just replace * with backslash...

If you have the FLT release and lost your save game, just go to

but i encountered an issue. game losses some graphics and audio after returning from pause."
,philoz494,2012-10-07T01:19Z,Yes I've installed the update 1 from FLT and then update 2 to 5 from Skidrow
,RECa5T,2012-10-07T01:20Z,"@fotis246 ...same thing, wtf?!?"
,philoz494,2012-10-07T01:47Z,I don't have AppData folder...
,aabunko78,2012-10-07T01:58Z,"the issue after pause seems to be coming from the new exe file. Here’s what i did to get some of the new updates working at least.
reverted to my backup of the FLT release patched with update 1.
installed update 2 to 5 on a different directory.
copied all folders ONLY from update 2 to 5 and pasted to overwrite those in the game directory, EXCEPT ‘actionmap’ folder. If you do, you will crash to desktop.
But, I’m not sure what I maybe missing from the updates due to using the old exe file.
hope it also works for you guys."
,aabunko78,2012-10-07T02:00Z,"AppData is a hidden system folder. just type it on the address bar and you'll get there. If not, just do some research on how to view hidden system folders on your OS."
,philoz494,2012-10-07T03:34Z,"Ok gotcha, found the saves and installed the patch 2 to 5 and got the game worked. I also have the graphic and audio lag after pause and tried your thing to fix. It din't work, is it something i din't understand or I did something wrong? Followed all your steps"
,grimm862,2012-10-07T08:40Z,"This update is not working on the only release we have right now and that would be the FLT release, unless somebody has a skidrow release somewhere I don't believe this works. "
,taz1004,2012-10-07T09:31Z,"This works on FLT version.  If your save games are gone, follow instruction of aabunko78.  If your crashing to desktop upon launch, download and install the free steam client.  This patch seems to require steam.

I am however getting audio glitch.  When I go into options and resume, the engine sound is gone."
,aabunko78,2012-10-07T09:43Z,"It does work on the FLT release, which is the one I have. But has some bugs when you pause the game."
,SilentViper01,2012-10-07T10:57Z,Hm great u cant use flashback with this update just freeze and u cant do anything.
,fotis246,2012-10-07T12:22Z,"In order to play with this update you need to have Steam installed.I installed Steam and then i could play this game.There is an audio bug after you press pause.

Also the update 5 hasn't gone up live in Steam yet.It will go up Monday morning as stated on Codemasters forum.

Changed the Prime tyre compound to Hard for Suzuka to match the race this weekend.  This change will not affect Time Attack which will continue to use the Medium compound tyre.
This change was introduced in patch 4 and you can see it yourself.

I hope that someone could crack update 5."
,adamqazqaz,2012-10-07T13:17Z,"i really dont understand how it is possible to create and sell game with so many bugs from the first week, and how it is possible to create first patch after one week of selling, the sell fuking beta version for real money, they should be sued for stealing money from people,  but for this patch why is so many problem with this patch, version 1.1 was fine and game was working , now is so many things change and the same problem with camera and pause "
,adamqazqaz,2012-10-07T13:21Z,"and another question, f1 2010 has option to change angle of front wing to create more gripp or less when you drive a car, and in 2011 and 2012 it is removed from the game but in real life it is still working, why odemaster want to create ""realistic game"" and give up from thinks that real egsist, why looklike of mclaren nose isnt change in game, and why is so stupid qualification mode that in q2 ai run faster than q3"
,adamqazqaz,2012-10-07T13:23Z,"best formula is 2010, first from many many years and you was so happy that you can play for something new, now they take the same old shit from 2010 and only pack in new cover and sale for more money"
,Nicolas55,2012-10-07T13:52Z,"Sadly, this release creates more problem than it resolves. In Champions mode, when I pause and resume the game, my car freezes, turns invisible (except is has a shadow), everyone passes me and I lose.

I wish I had stayed clear of this update, because the Update 1 has fixed even the savegame bug.

For those losing their savegames: they can be recovered followin aabunko's advice."
,philoz494,2012-10-07T14:56Z,My games loses sound and graphics after returning from pause. Any help plz? Tried aabunko's solution but it dint work
,FlankerB1,2012-10-07T18:32Z,"@adamqazqaz
In F1 2010 player had the ability to change angle of front wing while driving because it was alowed in the official f1 rules. In 2011 it was prohibited in favour of DRS (movable rear wing but not on any setting). DRS (Drag Reduction System) has only two settings - on or off. When DRS is on the top panel of the rear wing goes almost completely horizontal, and when drs is off the panel is going through the air at an angle defined in the first qualifying session (Q1) by each team. 

Your laptimes question - usualy drivers choose thinner fuel mix during q1 - that's the reason they are slower. Thinner fuel mix preserves the engine. Only weaker teams choose normal or riher fule mix option during q1 just to try to qualify for q2.

Back to front wing settings. It is true that you should be able to change it during race but only in pitstop (and only for a few ""notches"" - turns of a special tool). Parc fermé rules prohibit any major alterations on the f1 car after q1.

To me bigger problem with this series of games (F1 2010 to F1 2012) is to simplistic method of setting up your car. I remember F1 2002 and F1 Challenge 99-01 (both by EASports) had a lot more details in car setups and a separate exe file you were able to run from withine the game - telemetry analyzer which was rather realistic.

PS: What did you mean by mclaren nose looklike? If you meant that it doesn't look like other teams' noses it really doesn't. McLaren decided to keep the classic design wthout that hump."
,adamqazqaz,2012-10-07T21:02Z,"i know that in 2011 rule about changing nosa angle during race was suspended but in 2012 is on again but codemaster fail again, nose mclaren is his nirst nose they produe , in may they change shape http://www.formula1.com/news/technical/2012/868/958.html there you have description abaut what i m talking about
about ai in q2 and q3 i talked because so often ai in q2 are faster then q3 (profesional difficulty)"
,AtraxS16,2012-10-07T21:43Z,"Thnx for the upload.
To fix crashing problem, you just need to install Steam, that's it.
Although, this patch (update 5 I guess), totally ruined the already buggy game.
I have no sound after exiting the pit, my car freezes after flashback, the menu in the pit goes invisible, textures missing, etc...
Really bad.
I was happy to see that they've fixed the problem with engine getting damaged after flashback, that ruined many races for me, so I installed this, and now the game is literally unplayable.
Well, it's going on a shelve until some better patch comes out."

try these steps to get some of the updates to work

1. install f1 2012 by FLT
2. update using f1 2012 update 1 by fltdox
3. make a backup of the following files
f1_2012.exe
game_gdf.dll
steam_api.dll
win_000.nfs
:(F1 2012(system(flow.bin
4. backup the whole 'actionmap' folder with all it's contents.
3. run f1 2012 update 2 to 5
4. DO NOT use the cracked files in the Skidrow folder
5. delete the 'actionmap' folder in the game directory
6. paste your backup actionmap folder in the game directory
7. paste all other backup files to overwrite those on the game directory.
8. make sure you paste your backup flow.bin inside the system folder.

This has been working for me. Hope it works for everyone else"
