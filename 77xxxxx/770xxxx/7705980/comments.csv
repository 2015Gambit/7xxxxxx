,.Leto.,2012-10-08T13:50Z,"how's the audio, is it the real one? not a fake ac3 like all the other early exp2 releases."
,canopener,2012-10-08T22:59Z,"Expendables 1 = dts audio
Expandables 2 = hopefully will have dts audio on the English BluRay."
,666s,2012-10-09T12:23Z,"cant believe theres not one person seeding this up, what a joke"
,lopaka914,2012-10-09T12:29Z,"The quality, both video and audio is very bad . 
A/3
V/5
Sorry but true ."
,.Leto.,2012-10-09T15:47Z,"lopaka914 thanks for info. So it looks like it's still that horrible fake ac3. Not worth downloading then.
About the bad picture quality you can read comments on IMDb, from people who saw Exp2 at the theater, confirming that there's a problem with the movie, really grainy or blurry, so it's not the encoder's fault after all:

[T],ztorrenter,2012-10-10T17:52Z,"For these two users ( .Leto. and lopaka914) who never upload it a thing and just posting a negative comments, if you work with the movie 
companies than just go F.U.S. if not than just post the real thing.
This is a very good copy.
V=9
A=9"
,.Leto.,2012-10-10T21:27Z,"ztorrenter what negative comment? I asked a question, he told me it was the same fake ac3 as with all the other Exp2 releases. ok, now I know he was lying so I'm going to try this one. and my max uploading speed is 60kb/s, do you expect me to upload something with that??"
,.Leto.,2012-10-11T01:28Z,"Well I've downloaded this and it's the EXACT same bad audio as all the other Exp2 releases.
Which means that when you said ""This is a very good copy. V=9 A=9"" you lied. Or you've no idea what you're talking about.
So warning to everyone don't download this, this isn't better than the AVSHD bozx release that got slaughtered in the comments.
BTW I just saw that the extended version is now available with a DTS audio track."
,.Leto.,2012-10-11T01:38Z,"lol, sorry about my comment about the extended cut with dts being available, it's Exp1 not 2. I was so excited when I saw this among the search results that I didn't pay attention to the release date, 2010. The comment regarding the audio from this torrent is valid though, there's nothing new or different here compared to all the other releases."
,lopaka914,2012-10-11T12:57Z,"@ztorrenter
I'm always appreciate people who spend their time upload stuff on the internet . In this case it's you . 

But i have to review for people who hasn't good bandwitch connection but want watching this movie in best quality . 4.35GB may take a whole week for them, it take 3 days for me . I'm saving their time . 

A/9 V/9 is a lie ."
,lopaka914,2012-10-11T13:14Z,"@Leto
I'm not realise that ""extended cut with dts"" is exp 1 too ! 
Hahaha 30% "
[T],ztorrenter,2012-10-12T13:17Z,"Well, than wait for real BluRay release soon.
or download a 700 MB from yify if you don't have a good speed.
This is so far best copy out their for a DVD size.
Audio is DD 6 ch."
