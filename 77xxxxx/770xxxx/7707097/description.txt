
Basil Rathbone reads 'Lancelot and Elaine' and 'The Passing of Arthur' from Tennyson's Idylls of the King - a pleasant baritone voice fully in touch with the Tennysonian ethos.

Lancelot and Elaine is a tale of Victorian passion and fantasy, of sensuality and psychological repression, and is full of attractive pre-raphaelite colouring. She in fact is the Lady of Shallot and this is her full story. The Passing of Arthur is the great climax of the sequence.

Note that the first Tennyson upload, a Penguin Audiobook collection of Tennyson's verse, was unable to be uploaded to this site because of a filename error since it contained text files. Go to the 'Current Poetry Torrents' Folder and download it as it is has exemplary verse readings of Tennyson, (Lotos-eaters, Oenone, The Lady of Shallot, The Kraken Wakes etc.) with a literate and interesting commentary on Tennyson from his humble beginnings to the exalted Victorian conclusion.
