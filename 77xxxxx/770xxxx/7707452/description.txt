Not the usual cowboys-in-space type or the equally silly 

superheroes-in-space, so dear to mainly American minds, 

but stories with a depth that keep you thinking for long 

after you've read them.



The Invincible begs to be made into a blockbuster movie 

with the quite original story in science fiction cinema of 

a strange simple life form and human impotence to emerge 

victorious against it, even with superb technology.

Surprisingly, nobody in Hollywood has realized they 

have here a gold mine that would bring them zillions  

of dollars...



Solaris is also a quite original idea about an intelligent life form 

that is a whole ocean in a distant planet, but also a story with 

many angles and throws light over our human condition.



The Russian movie about it is a classic of science fiction 

and in spite of its moscovite slow going, it's a great pleasure 

to watch and enjoy.






I can seed only for a short time, please seed to keep alive.

Thanks.
