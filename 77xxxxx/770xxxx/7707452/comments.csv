I fully agree with you, it is amazing core sci-fi, Have you read also ""Suma Technologiae"" from Lem ?
This will really make you think long time after reading, its not actually a sci-fi novel, it is futurology text ! Which I was admiring Lem even more after reading it !"

Well, lucky you... I was looking for Suma Technologiae in English and couldn't find it anywhere.
