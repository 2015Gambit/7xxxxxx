,atamemet,2012-10-12T09:57Z,"is it full DVD or DVDRip???

i love pink floyd and hope this is full DVD instead of a Ripped format!"
,Technics666,2012-10-12T21:40Z,It's the FULL DVD
,Playit96,2012-10-16T23:20Z,"For some reason or another, this craps out while playing. 

Very likely, the ripper did not properly remove the copy protection. 

Both Nero and DVDShrink give me errors when they analyze the files. 

I wonder how this original disc was ripped... 

I must confess that I am completely baffled by the lack of expertise shown lately by people who rip DVDs - they leave the copy protection on, or use programs that create non-standard files, and consequently, the films are unwatchable - it's a waste of bandwidth and time. 

Use DVDDecrypter or DVDFab, people!!!"
