The Killers' first two studio albums (Hot Fuss [Limited Edition] and Sam's Town) presented in 320kbs.

BPM is calculated, lyrics & high-quality album artwork are included, and it's all properly tagged; with no extra garbage tags. Formatted for iTunes 10.7, tested on a 4th generation iPod touch.

Please leave feedback as there are a couple of other artists I would do this for if people like it. Thank you.

Currently also working on:
