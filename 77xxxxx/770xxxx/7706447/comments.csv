I put the contents of the zip file into the folder C:Program FilesNAMCO BANDAI GAMESDark Souls which is where my Dark Souls.exe was automatically installed to... 

However, nothing seems to be affecting the game, it still looks like it did before I tried applying the fix.  After looking elsewhere, people said to install the game into a DATA folder, but my installed version doesn't have any DATA folder... 

I'm using the Dark Souls from the torrent here:

Any help would be greatly appreciated"
