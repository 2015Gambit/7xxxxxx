,Kole97,2012-10-08T09:26Z,Thanks Scene4all! gREAT share.
,alannutt,2012-10-08T09:39Z,"tanlic, why are you on this site if you class films on here as stolen...its a sharing site...its cyber, no one has stolen anything ..you have to handle something to class it as stolen."
,nicofan,2012-10-08T13:35Z,@alannut. Tanlic meant the movie Stolen. Stolen is the name of the movie in the description ;)
,babybluetits24,2012-10-08T15:31Z,"from imdb review..Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed is a beautifully crafted WWII picture. Ryan Little delivers a moving film once again with Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed. With solid well developed characters just like in the original Saints and Soldiers. A strong cast of very talented actors bring the story to life. The action is incredible in this film. An all around great film.

This film has very strong female characters in it. This was refreshing as this isn't the norm with WWII films most of the time.

I could tell that the production team gave great attention to detail on this film. Well done.

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 1235  seed,(im never having a go at the uploader ! )  if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out (eg if its porn what type eg lesbien) ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
