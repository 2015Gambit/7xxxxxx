I used to have Lady Gaga festival sets sorted with either Concerts or Live Appearances. Now I put them in a separate Festivals category. Same existing uploads, just in a different place. 

2011.09.25 - iHeartRadio is a new upload. Here are the others:

2007.08.04 - Lollapalooza (a few snippets of a few songs)
2009.06.26 - Glastonbury (complete - broadcast, and audience recordings of the 2 songs not broadcast)
2009.07.03 - Werchter (one song)
