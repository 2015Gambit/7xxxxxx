,medioalmud,2012-10-22T00:50Z,"Weapons System
*Armament Panel (How to Load, Select, and Fire Weapons.)
1. The aircraft can only carry 2 different types of weapons.
2. The mix can be A/A & A/A, A/A & A/G; A/G & A/G
3. The aircraft has 7 hard points, called stations, where the weapons are attached.
The are numbered from left to right 1 thru 7.
4. Hard point 4 is in the center of the fuselage, between the two main landing
gears. It is only used to carry EW pods.
5. Stations 2, 3, 5, and 6 can also carry external fuel tanks for increased combat
range.
6. The external tanks are configured to use FSX fuel tanks.
7. It is NOT possible to carry FULL fuel and FULL weapons load at the same
time. If any external fuel tank has fuel, it will override any weapon/pod installed in
that station.
8. A/A Weapons are always HOT. Pressing the trigger will shoot/launch them.
9. The GAU-12 Cannon pod ONLY works with a joystick. It detects whether the
#1 button is being pressed. It will keep firing as long as the #1 button is being
pressed until it runs out of ammunition.
10. Cannon ammunition has weight. Shooting it will change aircraft
weight/balance.
11. All A/A weapons are HOTAS only. There are no switches/buttons in the
intrument/lateral panels to click before being used.
12. To use A/G weapons you must carry out the following steps:
a. Set HUD Master Mode to AG by clicking on the AG button.
b. Select one of the A/G weapons to be used by selecting the STORES page
in either the Left or RIGHT MPD. Click on the button labeled STRS.
c. The MPD Stores page will show a estilized aircraft wing showing all the
weapons and pods loaded in the aircraft.
d. ONLY A/G weapons can be selected. A/A weapons are selected by
HOTAS.
e. The top buttons (#20 and #19) will show the available weapons for
selection. Click on the button above the weapon label to select it.
f. A selected weapon label will be boxed in a rectangle.
g. A SAFE legend will be displayed in the STORE page, indicating that the
weapons are not armed. To arm them, you must click on the MASTER ARM
switch, located to the left of the Left MPD.
h. An ARM legend will be displayed when the system is ready. At this time
pressing the trigger will release the weapons.
i. If a weapon is exhausted (the count is 0), its label will disappear from the
display.
j. The aircraft will select the available station automatically. The firing
sequence is as following: 1-7-2-5-3-6.
k. Only one bomb/missile/rocket will be released/launched everytime you
press the trigger.
l. Aircraft weight/balance will be affected by weapons release.
13. To load weapons, the aircraft must be:
a. On the ground.
b. Engine OFF.
c. Parking Brakes set."

,snapshot88,2012-10-29T01:03Z,"
Question, what does the friction control do that is next to the nozzel control? If I move the control all the way to the back I don't see any effect, then I can't move that control back forward no matter what I try? Also I followed all of the check list to fire the weapons air or ground and still nothing happens. Is the download messed up or am I missing something?"
