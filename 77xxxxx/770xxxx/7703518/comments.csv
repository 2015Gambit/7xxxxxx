,chuck1953dec,2012-10-07T18:32Z,Product Key? I'm trying this in VMWare first and it asks for a Volume License Product Key.
,chuck1953dec,2012-10-07T19:05Z,"Nevermind, I used a key from another XP version I have and most everything installed in VMWare. Pretty slick how you make XP sort of look like Win7/8.
Thanks for the up......nice."

,sperky,2012-10-10T02:11Z,"hi, newb here. 
can't select anything during setup as my keyboard ceases to work at this point.  therefore I can't install.  it's a USB keyboard if it matters.  any advice?"

,watcheroo,2012-11-15T20:26Z,"Hello. Total noob here. My Thinkpad X22 back port doesn't work at all; side port only sees flash drive; I need both back and side ports to see external drive enclosures, and external Hitachi mini drive.  Not sure what SATA is, or if that's what my Thinkpad has.  Will my ports work with your 8 Elite?  If my Thinkpad is not SATA, will your 8 Elite still work anyway?  I need it to get online WIRELESS immediately after instal.  Will it wipe out my file system on d: partition?  And my programs on c partition?  Thank you, appreciate your time."
