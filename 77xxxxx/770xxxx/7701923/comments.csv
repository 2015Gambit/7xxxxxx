,bob9001a,2012-10-06T19:53Z,terrible quality
,HelloMynameisV,2012-10-06T19:59Z,Thax CP! The fastest one! 
,Drippar,2012-10-06T20:01Z,A/V: 5.4/10
[V],{C_P},2012-10-06T20:03Z,Yes it's SD quality. You should know by now thats what we releases bob9001a.
,bob9001a,2012-10-07T00:36Z,"Try writing that again, but in English. It is no wonder your releases suck so hard when you are too stupid to even write properly."
,getaboshi,2012-10-07T05:38Z,"Your ignorance is astounding, even if your punctuation is correct. English isn't the first language of the majority of uploaders/seeders on this site. 

Proficiency in a secondary or tertiary language has no bearing on the quality of the releases. 

Your post makes you look idiotic, and achieves the complete opposite of what you intended."
,getaboshi,2012-10-07T05:39Z,"Thanks, CP, for making this available quickly to those who want it irrespective of quality! (That last post was at bob9001a, just to be 100% clear on the context.)"
,Brian0310,2012-10-07T05:48Z,Screw the haters. Its not even that bad of quality. Your like the first person to put it up also so Thank you. Keep it up.
,Tuntira,2012-10-07T09:45Z,"Wow, some people are pretty lame. You're getting something absolutely MAHALA (free) and you're complaining about it. WOW!! Either way, most people know that C.P's quality isn't the greatest, but they are out of the blocks fastest, so if you want to watch YJ asap, download, if you can wait, then do so!!! 

Personally I wait, but I appreciate the effort by C.P, don't listen to the losers around here, just look at your number of seeders, those guys and gals are the ones that are thanking you ;)"
,LeBob,2012-10-07T10:12Z,"It's too bad that the quality is not up to par. At the moment i use {C_P} just as ""news"" to find out that a show was released (since they are always the fastest with release), and then search for it at the high-quality groups 3-4 days later."
,dreadquake,2012-10-08T05:34Z,"This argument is ridiculous. There's no question that the quality of this release is very noticeably lower than most other releases. But some people choose to accept lower quality in exchange for a fast release or a small file size. Personally, I prefer to wait for a higher quality release, but there's no problem with this release being available, for those who prefer it. After all, giving people viewing choices is one of the main reasons a torrent site like this even exists."
