,leather522001,2012-10-06T12:16Z,Is this R5 russian crap?
,.Leto.,2012-10-06T19:19Z,size is different so I don't think. it can't be worse than AVSHD  anyway
,QborT,2012-10-06T19:35Z,"Yes, leather522001 this is still from a Region C (Russian) source."
,.Leto.,2012-10-06T22:12Z,"yes, I just finished downloading this, exact same shitty quality. picture is horribly grainy and where's the definition? really low quality considering this is supposed to be a bluray rip. better releases will come soon, there's no way this is the real thing, so no big deal."
,.Leto.,2012-10-07T05:23Z,"I watched this movie, it doesn't look like it's the real audio. I read on another torrent that the rippers used to dvd audio for this"
,.Leto.,2012-10-07T20:55Z,"yes it's confirmed, stereo mixed in 5ch and the music score is so off key that it often sounds like bagpipes!"
