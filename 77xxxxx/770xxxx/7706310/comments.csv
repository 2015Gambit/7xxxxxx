When I added this torrent it identified it as being exactly the existing one [not a new one] and requested if the trackers should be reloaded. If you could be so kind, perhaps you should delete both torrents and resubmit with a *newly* created torrent file ... and re-upload it. I'm sorry if it takes so long to upload, but there are 25 persons interested in your shared file. :) Cheers!"

What is typically done is to download the existing TPB torrent, then once you've connected ... stop the torrent ... put the real file in place ... then force a re-check of the torrent ... which should place you at 100% then start it ... you will then become the seed ... just sayin' :) Thanks!
