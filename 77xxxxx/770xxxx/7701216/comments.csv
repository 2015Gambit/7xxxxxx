,DaBigLebowski,2012-10-09T20:14Z,"Looks promising at 2.2g to be a cam, but a decent/good cam version

I am DL now, I will report back A/V"
,DaBigLebowski,2012-10-09T20:20Z,"For a cam, the increased size does give you better A/V.

For a Cam:

A 8
V 9

Looks great for a cam.  He has 720 in the title, so everyone may judge it thinking it's a DVD rip.  The DVD isn't out until December.  If you want real blue ray quality wait till then. 

However, if you want to see the movie now, this is the way to go.  It's very watchable.  

Thanks UltraTorrents (VIP member for a reason)"
,DaBigLebowski,2012-10-09T20:23Z,"For a cam

A 8.5
V 9.5

This is one of the best out.  If you want a true DVD -rip wait till it's released in December.  Until then, this is the best I've seen"
,frkzoid,2012-10-10T08:30Z,Thanks. Hopefully it's watchable.
,enonumus,2012-10-12T12:56Z,"A5/V3 Any screen captures are highly misleading since they don't show the number one problem with this video and other similar cams, which is the unwatchable blurriness due to the frame rate issue.  Definitely not worth watching imo, and it'll ruin the movie if you haven't seen it yet.  Wait another month or so for at least something close to DVD quality."
,DaBigLebowski,2012-10-12T21:04Z,"enonumus, you Fucking crack me up.  

What do you want this to look like?   A Blue Ray on a LED TV?  

It's a CAM.  Cam's don't look like DVD quality.  It is what it is.  For a Cam, this one is good.  It doesn't have the trademarks of bad CAMs. 

It's not dark, you don't see people walking to their seats; it's not out of sync.  For a Cam its' pretty good.  Very good actually.

...and you have some balls to be critical of quality.   Your only upload is of a 1946 movie in average 720 quality.  There is 1080 Blue Ray versions of that movie, but you got the average version.  Great torrent too; with ZERO seeders. lol.  

He who lives in a glass house shouldn't throw stones.  Or in your case, leave comments. 

I am new to TPB, and I know I don't have any uploads.  But I am not dogging someone for uploading a pretty good CAM version, and trashing it.  Get a life brah"
