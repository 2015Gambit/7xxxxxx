The 2005 re-release of the Marvin Gaye compilation "The Very Best of Marvin Gaye". 

I'm not too fond of compilations, but this is a pretty decent collection if you don't want all of Marvin Gaye's albums or a simple Greatest Hits album either ("What's Going On" should always be an essential though).
