I feel this is fake, but downloading to be sure."

[V],HeroMaster,2012-10-08T22:23Z,"Language is Not English, it is only Fra, Ger, Ita, Spa  Only."

,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-09T00:23Z,"No english, what a joke. Maybe you should write that in the release name or something, now i have been downloading this shit for nothing... Oh well, better to wait for the PC version anyways!? :)"
,gumph1688,2012-10-09T00:25Z,is they not anyway to get it into english?
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-09T01:13Z,"I wish there was, but no, we just have to wait for someone to release the english version. Hate these Multi4 releases, stupid germans, italians, spanish, french people for not having the brains to learn english. My native tongue is not english, but still I want my games with english audio as I wouldnt want to play the game with Swedish. Hello, there are something called Subtitles, cant you guys just have subtitles, no you have to have it in youre own language?!? :) Learn english you morons..."
,nos4r2d2,2012-10-09T01:46Z,"Alik0 uploads can be trusted, the languages are clearly stated in the description with no mention of English. No need to mark the quality of this torrent down because you didn't read the description. Why do you think people who upload games regularly disappear, because they end up getting more complaints than thanks, endless requests and deal with people with an expectation of entitlement."
,Deega,2012-10-09T01:47Z,I think it's English by default..
,knuthamsun,2012-10-09T02:06Z,"MEGodObeyOrDIEeee

I think you don't have enough brain just to read the info just in this page. 多Como puedes ser tan estupido?"
,gumph1688,2012-10-09T03:27Z,"i thought all games would be default english too.. but fook knows obviously not, has anyone tried it to see?  im gunna get it original anyway i like bethesda but would be bonus to play early :)"
,ROM4N,2012-10-09T04:35Z,"@MEGodObeyOrDIEeee

you too are stupid because you can not speak Spanish, Italian, French or German,LOL!!!

and you're too stupid to know or read the description of the torrent"
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-09T05:49Z,"WOW i touch a nerve here!!!?:) Yeah im the lazy idiot who needs everything translated or dubbed... Only fra, spa, ita, ger, countries have everything dubbed and translated, because youre too lazy to learn english, or too proud to accept that youre shitty languages are not nr1 in the world. Get over youre selves and get with the program, english is the 1# language of western society, dont you idiots get that? Its because of you morons we euroeans often get games and other media later than others because the need to translate every fucking thing because you idiots cant learn english.... And im stupid? Yeah maybe i am stupid, but its only because i catch the stupid disease from you idiots... :D"
,quaderquader,2012-10-09T11:47Z,"you MEGodObeyOrDIEeee are one really stupid fart. We just have to wait for the english version, its not helping to post something as brainless as you. I'm german myself, and i will wait for the english release, as I hate german synchs, but I hate stupid fucks like you much more. Let the people who want to play the game like that have their fun, and stop whining."
,Serwantes0123,2012-10-09T13:37Z,Can i ask why  did no one released the Region Free version?
,knuthamsun,2012-10-09T18:54Z,"@MEGodObeyOrDIEeee

In ten years your ass and your mouth will belong to the chinese people so don't sing very loud... in english"
,kirAldk,2012-10-09T19:00Z,"Works perfectly on LT+3.0 with a normal burner on Verbatim printable surface.
ImgBurn x2.4 ! thank you so much "
,blz0,2012-10-09T20:47Z,"come on guys, the description says there is no eng language in it... then... don't download it? is it that hard?"
,Gvarimoto,2012-10-10T03:20Z,"Confirmed, no english is in this game, and for what i could see, its onlu spanish. No option to change language."
,Gvarimoto,2012-10-10T03:21Z,"So, FUCK you Alik0. What kind of a retard uploads a game that doesnt include english ? a retarded fuck. Thats who."
,froger76,2012-10-10T03:22Z,"harro, why no engrish?"
,6ril,2012-10-10T18:05Z,"Many thanks !
