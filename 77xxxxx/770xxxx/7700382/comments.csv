,AlyH,2012-10-06T10:07Z,I'm at 98% - but no one seems to have 100% of my connected peers
,AlyH,2012-10-06T18:36Z,"so I got it to 99.8% but in the meantime I downloaded the other option available, it was bigger and rar file, which stinks, but it works lol"
,Potato23,2012-10-06T22:41Z,how many shows are you going to upload and not seed so people can atleast download it to share. I have 2 shows downloading from TvTeam and both are stuck at 99.8% for 2 days now. Why even waste your time uploading shit that no one will get to watch cause we cant even finish downloading it in 2 DAYS
