,Dakyo,2012-10-10T19:59Z,Where can I found the crack ?
,Dakyo,2012-10-10T20:01Z,"Anyway, I found it."
,DSExpert,2012-10-13T17:18Z,"I was intrigued by this game when it came out for PSP couple y. Found out last month this game was coming out for PC and have been waiting patiently for the torrent to this game. :) 

Looking forward to trying this out. Tthanks for the heads up about it being in Japanese by default and changing it to English by copying the crack over. Also, in order to mount the game you need to select the .cue file with ""Daemon Tools lite"" or other mounting software."

,RadRob,2012-10-19T22:30Z,"OK ignore previous comment, after mounting it, it doesn't do anything when I tried launching the application.  I don't believe I did anything wrong, anybody know what to do?"
