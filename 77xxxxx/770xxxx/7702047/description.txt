I was tired of all of the torrents I could find being the first three books in ebook, and the fourth in audio, so I hunted them all down and made my own torrent.

Books are:

1) Alanna: The First Adventure
2) In the Hands of the Goddess
3) The Woman Who Rides Like a Man
4) Lioness Rampant

All are in .epub format.

All have various errors from whoever created them. If anything they're going to irritate me so much while I'm reading I break down and find some way to edit them. If ever you want the proofread versions (and I promise they'll be perfect) let me know. Also leave a comment if you want any of these other books, or all of them in one file. I'm working on getting the other two Circle universes series, and the random collection of Tortallan stories.
