,Annairea,2012-10-06T20:18Z,Will seed as long as I can.
,dashante,2012-10-15T02:37Z,Thanks So much.  It would be awesome if you would put up the torrents for the other tortal books in epub format.
,anoora,2012-10-18T04:46Z,Thank you very much. I would appreciate it if you can put the rest of the tortall books and the circle books up.

,nas.ebooks,2012-10-23T20:30Z,Thank you so much for all the Pierce books. The only copies I could find were poorly formatted pdf versions. These are bound to be better!
