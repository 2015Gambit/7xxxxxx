Zingers flew and egos crackled Saturday night as Fox NewsΓÇÖs Bill OΓÇÖReilly and ΓÇ£Daily ShowΓÇ¥ host Jon Stewart debated in front of a boisterous audience at the George Washington UniversityΓÇÖs Lisner Auditorium. The two television personalities, at ideological odds, found common ground by brandishing their wit and revving their symbiotic sideshow act, branded this time around as ΓÇ£The Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium.ΓÇ¥

In one corner: OΓÇÖReilly, 63, a 6-foot-4 conservative Catholic from Levittown, N.Y., who divides the world into patriots and pinheads every weeknight on ΓÇ£The OΓÇÖReilly Factor.ΓÇ¥

In the other: Stewart, 49, a 5-foot-6 liberal Jew from New Jersey whose quippy ombudsmanship of OΓÇÖReillyΓÇÖs network has dominated segments on his rollicking Comedy Central show for years.
