,view9234,2012-10-08T17:15Z,"The quality is unwatchable.  I'm guessing it was from a live stream of the event (not the download that's available on their website).

Can someone please upload the 'download' version instead of continually posting different streaming versions (seen here: http://www.therumble2012.com/index.html)"
,wearehidden,2012-10-08T23:54Z,you have to buy an account to get it there :/. and the quality was decent for me so eh
