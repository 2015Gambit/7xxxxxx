,sopho19,2012-10-07T19:31Z,where are all the seeds? all the peers seem to be stuck at 12%.
,dragonballz,2012-10-07T20:22Z,Is it your mission to upload mostly the poorly rated movies? I mean who would want to watch a 2/10 rated movie? Is it even worth your efforts?
,miki80pirate,2012-10-07T22:39Z,"pls YIFY encode in small size all older movies that is on bluray., http://thepiratebay.se/user/DownTYU/"
,kratol,2012-10-07T22:43Z,2.5 score on imdb...
,passionpit,2012-10-08T01:25Z,"@dragonballz - If you don't like the film, then don't download it. There are plenty of people who wish to watch it, despite the imdb rating.

Thank-you for your time and effort Yify. Very much appreciated."
,deaderweterdog,2012-10-09T05:42Z,you can find torrents of the top grossing movies anywhere what makes PB so great is you can find the shit no ones heard of even the shit no ones heard of 20 years ago thanks uploader
,LordOrwell,2012-10-11T14:25Z,i agree completely.  You want to watch a movie based on what someone else's opinion of that movie is?  Don't you have a brain?  Movie reviews are notorious.  For example i happened to thoroughly enjoy The Last Airbender and it scored even lower than that.
,kaaviyan,2012-10-12T14:35Z,subs anyone?
