In Talbot, Ohio, a father's need for surgeries puts the family
in a financial bind. His son Vince, an electrician, overhears
a man talking about making a fortune in just a day. When the
man overdoses on drugs, Vince find instructions and a cell
phone that the man has received and substitutes himself:
taking a train to New York and awaiting contact. He has no idea
what it's about. He ends up at a remote house where wealthy men
bet on who will survive a complicated game of Russian roulette:
he's number 13. In flashbacks we meet other contestants,
including a man whose brother takes him out of a mental
institution in order to compete.
Can Vince be the last one standing?
