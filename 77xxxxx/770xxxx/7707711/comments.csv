,com8472,2012-10-08T23:00Z,"Ok I tried deleting ru.pak files and it worked. So copy everything from this torrent to the game folder, then go into 000 folder and delete ru.pac and sounds_ru.pac."
,RVG90,2012-10-08T23:00Z,If you are still having a problem deletemove the ru language files in the 000 folder.
,RVG90,2012-10-08T23:05Z,So yea just deletemove the ru files too from your 000 folder.
,RVG90,2012-10-08T23:06Z,"And please seed, it's a pain for people to download it when i am using a 2mb connection :)."
,miss_poe,2012-10-09T13:04Z,"Maybe I'm stupid here, but what is this supposed to fix? If it's the Westgate Prison crash, then it doesn't work. Still crashes at day 2 :("
,kiklop71,2012-10-09T13:44Z,Well...I've done everything right...but the game wants to activate the product...where can I get any S/N ?
,kiklop71,2012-10-09T13:46Z,I need a serial number to activate the product...what kind of crack is this?
,RVG90,2012-10-09T14:17Z,"This is not a crack, this is a fix for people who downloaded this:

And can't play the game because it's in russian.

If it asks you for serial and you haven't got a crack yet please download Skidrow's crack here:

,Maximity,2012-10-09T23:17Z,Just after you paste the folder delete the ru.pack and then rename the en.pack to ru.pack. It worked for me :)
,RVG90,2012-10-09T23:57Z,Try what Maximity said but you shouldn't need to do that.
,Koca114,2012-10-10T17:53Z,@RVG90 Can I play this game with a controller?
,RVG90,2012-10-11T00:50Z,"I am afraid you can't atm, i tried with a 360 controller and didn't work."
,Koca114,2012-10-11T13:57Z,@RVG90 I tried as well and didn't work either. I can move but I can't pick stuff from my inventory or scroll main menu
,outlawxxheart,2012-10-12T02:12Z,"I downloaded the english fix, deleted the ru files and copied the english files into the folder.. the game wouldnt open, so I did as someone else suggested and renamed it ru.pack... but the game still wont open.. help? I really want to play this!! :("
,RVG90,2012-10-14T15:54Z,"I am really sorry that your game ain't working but this has nothing to do with it, it only changes language from russian to english anything else is unrelated, try using a different crack."
