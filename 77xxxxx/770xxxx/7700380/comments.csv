,Goldfire1986,2012-10-07T09:55Z,What's happening with the seeds on this and S09E53? We're all stuck at 95.2% and E53 hasn't even transferred any data.
,DraukaSpider,2012-10-07T11:29Z,"Come on SEED please, I'm with Goldfire on this, though I'm stuck at 99.8 on E53 and NO data on this one, COME TvTeam I hate getting pKcMva's crap, the file size is usually double yours and the quality isn't as good, for a long while you guys rocked with geting this uploaded first now you're falling behind"
,DraukaSpider,2012-10-07T11:46Z,"ALSO pKcMva has E54 uploaded 2 days ago, where is my x264-FQM TvTeam, PLEASE you're failing me here :-("
,SweatyBalls6969,2012-10-07T14:49Z,"Try rapidmovies site for episodes 52, 53 and 55. Search for S09E52, S09E53 and S09E55 as putting Big Brother AU does not seem to work all the time.

As for Episode 54, kinda stuck with PKcMva's

Thanks to all the uploaders for this show....very much appreciated"
,Goldfire1986,2012-10-07T15:16Z,My mistake. 52 hasn't budged and 53 is stuck at 95.2%. Looks like we'll have to get the pKcMva release until these ones pick back up again.
,DraukaSpider,2012-10-08T19:30Z,"PLEASE seed, stuck at 70.1% and I'd like to keep my collection of these in mp4 instead of mix matching with avi"
