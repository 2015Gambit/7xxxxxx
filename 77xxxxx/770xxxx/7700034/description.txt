Loose Ends was a successful British R&B band that had several urban contemporary hits. The trio was formed in London in 1980, initially comprising vocalist and guitarist Carl McIntosh, vocalist Jane Eugene, and keyboard player, writer and founder Steve Nichol. The latter two left the group in 1989, bringing an end to the band's most successful phase.

Giving us all such hits as CHOOSE ME (Rescue Me), HANGING ON A STRING, SLOW DOWN and WATCHING YOU, Loose Ends was another of the AWESOME bands during the time. Sadly it seems the more awesome bands and performers were, the more drama the music industry subjected them to, until they eventually broke up or stopped making music.

In either case we PIRATEBAYERS will keep this music alive by seeding it forever...or at least a long time

I hope you all enjoy LOOSE ENDS it certainly brings back memories
