The Birthday Massacre - Hide and Seek (2012) - 128

 The new album from The Birthday Massacre opens with rain, and ends with the sounds of waves; in between we are given songs of lost girls, lost love, lost time. The delicate interplay between ChibiΓÇÖs vocals and the ambiance created by Rainbow, M. Falcore, Rhim, Owen & Nate is on full display. Dark new wave hooks and haunting synths turn sinister as Rainbow and FalcoreΓÇÖs guitars lead Hide and Seek into ever darker, ever more beautiful corners of The Birthday MassacreΓÇÖs world.
