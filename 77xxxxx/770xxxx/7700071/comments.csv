,BUTT_SEX,2012-10-06T07:17Z,"Ah at last! 

Someone needs to post a 320kbps MP3 version of the album soon though. Considering the album doesn't come out until the 9th this might be all that is available until then though. "
,pokeb0y,2012-10-06T17:09Z,"How is 128kbps good quality? we're not living in 2001 when 128kbps was the choice of rip. There is a 192kbps leak out on mp3db.ru and synthema.ru , otherwise you'll have to hope one of their fans leaks the album."
,Jnxd1,2012-10-06T23:37Z,"Two things:
One: Mine was the first available copy. A full day before mp3db.ru and synthema.ru. And mine is the only copy on TPB. If someone wants to put a higher bitrate version up, by all means go right ahead. It's just a waste of time because of...
Two: You're looking at the audio the wrong way. You should be looking at SAMPLE RATES not BIT RATES. 128kbps means it is CD quality. Almost all humans cannot tell the difference between 128 and anything higher. What humans perceive as sound quality is the SAMPLE RATE, or how much information is given per frequency (Hz). The bit rates are only for computers and how much data they process per second. Besides, CD players don't even use bit rates
My rip is 44,100Hz @ 128kbps. The other rips are 32,000Hz @ 192kbps. 
Simple experiment: Put on some headphones (a good pair), put on one version of the song and turn the volume up. See how high it goes before distorting the songs highs and lows. Then play the other version. See which one is better. You'll see mine is better quality because it has more info/data/sound per frequency(Hz) than the other. "
,Jnxd1,2012-10-06T23:39Z,Don't forget it's free and the actual album isn't even out yet. 
,pokeb0y,2012-10-07T02:18Z,"so you ripped the actual cd with windows media player @ 128kbps? i can understand that, a promo leak, buy the real thing... thanks!"
,Jnxd1,2012-10-07T06:23Z,"Don't worry, I fully intend to buy the CD when I see them on tour this year.

As a tip - buy the cd whenever you go see them on tour. Bands average $0.10 per unit sold in a record store but see almost ALL of the money they sell them for at shows. This way the band themselves make money and not some record label. 

Support the band not the label!"
,BUTT_SEX,2012-10-07T11:56Z,"Good points Jnxd1.. But who the hell rips music at 32,000 mhz anyways? That's just stupid. Lol.

I also look forward to seeing them on tour too!"
,Condemned1990,2012-10-09T19:00Z,"Thanks for this! I've been waiting for a long time to finally hear it and it sounds amazing right now, especially Play With Fire."

hahaha, finally someone who knows their shit! Thanks for the upload and the entertainment. 

I hate it when these people complain about the bitrate or the quality in general. Even if it was a shitty upload (which its not) your getting it for free and before the album even drops. 

So shut up and enjoy it! "
