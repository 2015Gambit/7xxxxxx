,pricegeoffrey,2012-10-07T17:39Z,"Price Geoffrey has written four fiction and non-fiction ebooks and one stage play for the torrent community. He initially seeded the files on a number of by-invitation only torrenting sites. Then he released the texts on PirateBay. All his books are being seeded still by his readers. His decision has dimensions much more interesting than vanity publishing did in the old media economy. He seeds the files unlocked so downloaders can convert them to their preferred format. It also means that readers can alter the files and revise the texts in any way they desire. It leverages the writer-reader relationship into a truly collaborative post-copyright space. He has written an anti-war novel premised in John Ford's Stagecoach called FFtGG (Fucked From the Get-Go). Fan-fictionalizing the same characters for Marco Polo: A Play About LHR & COS, his intention, as explained in the stage notes, is to cause a reaction by the police to ban the book, like other Hubbard texts in Germany. He has written two horror genre books: one that brutalizes the Tea Party absurdity, in Zombies on the DL, and delights in the Manson Family's social impression, in Fascist Vampires. His exploration of the French philosophers Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze is contained within a historiography of SoCal called Understanding Charlie Manson and the Family of Infinite Soul. He is finishing a book about art and social unrest called Errors in Space in Time. In order to confront copyright boundaries, EST will have an ancillary album of copyright-violating remixes ostensibly produced by the protagonist. His work encourages collaboration beyond file-sharing as the Administration and its mandarin client states brutally and inequitably enforce the corporate domination and ownership of culture. "

If you've downloaded them and you keep them active in your torrent application (UTorrent, Vuze, whatever you use...), you can always say to your IP/WiFi/Cable provider that you were downloading and hosting PERFECTLY LEGAL files. I wrote these and I have uploaded them to Piratebay for you to enjoy. It's all good to download them and keep them seeded. Torrenting is the preferred means by which I, the sole creator of them, want to share my work with anyone and everyone. This way, I get you to seed my files and maybe you'll read them and like them. Because you are seeding them, they stay active for me and I don't have to overheat my old laptop while I seed overnight. I'm asking you to host by giving you an explanation you can use for your parents or spouse or whomever about why you are receiving a warning for a cable/Fios/WiFi ban/shut-down. Just say you were hosting my lame-ass shit, and ask them where the violation is in that. You can say, ""Yes,"" I torrent, but I torrent `literary' texts."" See, it kind of classes it all up, too."
