,Mikey320,2012-10-06T07:53Z,"Same as the 720p version!

V: 8 (some scenes look grainy)

A: 7 (Not bluray HD sound)

This is a Russian Bluray Copy so there is english audio from a DVD rip dubbed over it, so its not HD quality that you would expect for a Bluray! Still the best copy you can get so far, as for me im going to wait till we get a real Bluray rip from inside the states! "
,1on1,2012-10-06T09:18Z,"ah well, the second i wrote that it went up.. nvm LOL"
[T],xxbel,2012-10-06T09:33Z,"Mikey320, lolwhat? ripped from inside the state like by who? say grace when you see a CHD out."
,sugarpuffextreme,2012-10-06T16:56Z,"isnt dvd sound pretty damn good anyway unless you own a highend sound system?

I really hope you arent posting this and sitting infront of pc speakers mikey320 :P"
,Mikey320,2012-10-06T19:16Z,"what i ment was im going to wait till we have a rip from an english source from a bluray for the audio, cause right now its just audio from a DVD source and you can tell the difference, and no im not using computer speakers, im using a Home Theater Box 7.1 surround sound hooked up to my comp! "
,FilmTrix,2012-10-06T22:24Z,"BOZX: you could have told about the audio.
Mikey320: your still a idiot"
,derrique,2012-10-07T01:20Z,"at FilmTrix, :-D 
the comments are mostly more entertaining than the films. are there charts for the wittiest slagging matches.. ? i know i'd have the funniest evening reading through them  (-:"
,Steeldude,2012-10-07T04:10Z,I would like to say thanks to BOZX for the amazing movie. First of all you fuckheads this is a Russian Bluray source. That being said the audio is in english but not bluray quality and the video is a little grainy but not something to bitch about considering its on TPB 2 months earlier then expected so shove your idiotic shit up your ass and say grace to your master BOZX.

,ulle,2012-10-07T13:16Z,Horrible sound! Stereo mixed in 5ch and the music score is off key. Russian rips FTL!
,.Leto.,2012-10-07T20:52Z,"lol @ Steeldude: ""say grace to your master BOZX"" ???? who are you to praise him like that? you're his little bitch?
Like ulle said there's a problem with the audio. I'm not kidding, music sometimes sounds like bagpipes or something like that. Don't waste your time with this bad release, wait for the real ones."
,Mufassi,2012-10-07T22:19Z,Agree! BOZX could tell about the sound without problem.. so the people can know and make choice!
,afhmk,2012-10-08T13:59Z,VereBad accuracy !!!
,afhmk,2012-10-08T14:00Z,"^
Very Bad Accuracy

Not 1080p !!!!"
,newline1,2012-10-08T19:21Z,"thanks every body rate and comment for us, 

we will wait until 1080p rises thanks again people you are great"
,canopener,2012-10-08T23:04Z,"Does the Audio sound bad because it's in:

44.1 KHz instead of 48 kHz?"
,.Leto.,2012-10-10T01:29Z,"canopener, the audio sounds bad because it's not the real bluray audio! it's a fake ac3, that's why it sounds so aweful. and of course he ""forgot"" to mention it in the torrent description."
,Skram0,2012-10-13T06:19Z,"I'd guess the audio is off key because Russia's video format is PAL 25fps. And I know when you convert 25fps to NTSC 23.976fps you get audio pitch issues. Such a slight change in pitch that most people won't notice it, but some do. Not quite loyal to the movie's intention, so that's why I hate PAL->NTSC converted video."
,griiid,2012-10-14T13:22Z,"Who the fuck translated this one!?
Both nlupper and this is the wors english i have seen! They say: Eat shit and the subs: Take out!?
wtf!?
Any descent subs?"
,MARYUS1010,2012-10-18T12:54Z,A/V sync is messed up!!
,Walliance,2012-10-28T17:35Z,"I love all the little cunts on TPB, like FilmTrix and Steeldude. Why the fuck would you hate on someone stating it's dvd quality sound when that's the actual truth? I for one is really grateful for this UL, but that doesn't mean that I don't think that the audio quality is fucking horrible, DOES IT? And by the way, Steeldude, you must have your computer hooked up to a fucking gramophone if you give the audio 9/10 you brown nosed smurf.

Anyhow, thats BOSX for the UL. Awesome file size for this kind of quality!"
,Data-Danne,2012-11-17T22:38Z,"I'm sure this was a nice release when it was new, but now there are proper releases instead. Don't download this. The audio is bad quality (not horrible, just bad) and out of sync, which is kinda annoying."
