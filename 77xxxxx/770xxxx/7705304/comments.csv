Gary Lineker presents highlights from the Premier League, with analysis from Alan Shearer and Martin Keown.

Manchester City entertain Sunderland, with last season's 3-3 draw at the Etihad Stadium still fresh in their memories. Those dropped points were the only occasion across the whole season that City failed to secure maximum points at home. The Black Cats were also the only side City failed to beat at least once in the league last term following defeat at the Stadium of Light.

Chelsea entertain a Norwich side looking for their first Premier League win at Stamford Bridge since 1993, while West Ham host Arsenal, hoping to continue their solid home form since their return to the top flight.

Wigan face Everton, Reading travel to Swansea and West Brom meet QPR in the day's other games.
