,LittleVinnie,2012-10-09T09:31Z,"Patch for EXP is here:
http://dl.poke-mega.org/pokemon-black-2-version-u-nintendo-3dsds/

just scroll to bottom and it should say download and a couple lines under that it says AP fix. Just download that (not the big download button) and do what it says: extract the Patch file. Make sure the rom is extracted too. and drag the rom onto the patch. Click yes then ok and its done!"
