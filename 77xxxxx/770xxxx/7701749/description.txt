While other Match-3 games support only one gameplay mode (Swap or Chain), Lost in Night goes a step further by now including Group, a third, new gameplay mode. Swap pieces between spots, trace a ΓÇ£chainΓÇ¥ between identical pieces, or ΓÇô now ΓÇô explode groups of similar colors. And to complete a level, destroy the marble plaques. ItΓÇÖs harder than it sounds! Another game exclusive is the shape of the playing field: Lost in Night offers a traditional rectangular field as well as an innovative six-sided one for a greater challenge, 400 different levels, and relaxing music to soothe you when the going gets tough!
