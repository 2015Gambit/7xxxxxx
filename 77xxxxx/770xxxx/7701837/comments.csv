If you are not going to seed then donÂ´t bother leeching you bunch of Pricks.. Fuck off somewhere else you low lifes"
,cyberhippy,2012-10-06T21:01Z,"By the way, thanks to scene4all for the Upload, shame no fucker is doing their part in the deal and seeding.
Keep up the good work i really appreciate your work. "
,toktokeh,2012-10-06T22:37Z,wow so much anger. May I recommend taking a cold shower? Your blood pressure will thank you.
,mmay2879,2012-10-07T01:21Z,been awhile since I listened to an angry hippy...lol i also appreciate the uploader as well!
,BridgeToClarity,2012-10-07T01:31Z,The hippy must be out of weed. 
,Aznagroth2,2012-10-07T02:48Z,Thanks for upload!  Quite entertaining!  @cyberhippy: some of us don't seed extensively because of down-/upload limits.  Just thought you might want to know.
,You_Muppet,2012-10-07T08:18Z,"Yeah, there are a lot of haters. I'd have thought UFC fans were all pacifists, not angry peoplz.

Maybe its Dana in disguise.

A & V = 8. Thanks, S4A.

,kokurukai,2012-10-07T14:52Z,@cyberhippy Are u not bright or just live somewhere its legal to seed torrents i live in the usa and i dont seed much cuz of the fucked up laws here so get your facts straight dumbass
,KShelbrock2,2012-10-09T06:25Z,"@Cyberhippy you do see theres 832 seeders and only 130 leech right? maybe you just cant connect to the seeds...

@ everyone else complaining about seeding due to fear of legal reprisal. Its called ""Peer Block""... look into it"
