Thanks for the upload, though."
[V],psspss,2012-10-08T12:53Z,"i  see on the episode they calling it a season premier which means first one of the season

so season 10 was 13 episodes thats really weird short season

so I guess this is season 11 after all?

are all the previous season naming messed up then?"
