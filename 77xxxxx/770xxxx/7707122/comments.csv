It is a communication error between the #mystats communication in the GUI and the info being transferred from the server. Makes for a difficult fix. Planning to mod a test server to try and fix it but I need to find the time. This last one took 3 months in the works."

Please SEED people, help speed it up!

Obviously I am being throttled by Xfinity because they have some personal vendetta against TPB... Bastards! Checked speedtest.net and 56Mbps down and 18Mbps up, but only upping at average 34Kbps. 

Again... PLEASE, SEED - that is the only co$t for this."

:(

SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED -- or it dies. "
