Real landmark for VFR flight enthusiasts, this scene is also a real challenge for experienced helicopter pilots. Atmospheric conditions, the small size of the helipad (9m x 9m), proximity of buildings and the lack of ground effect are many hurdles to a perfect landing...

Located in the Hautes-Pyrénées near Bagnères-de-Bigorre (France), on Pic du Midi de Bigorre, reaching an altitude of 2 877 meters, it offers a unique view of the mountain range between France and Spain.
 
Since the beginning of the eighteenth century, the summit of Pic is known to be a place for astronomical observations.
 
The first cable car was installed in 1952.
 
In 1963, NASA funded the installation of a 106 cm telescope. It was used to take pictures of specific places on lunar surface, during preparation of Apollo missions.
 
The author's goal was to model this scene with a detailed accuracy, thus reproducing the site typical atmosphere. One can note the absence of night lighting at the Pic in order to avoid light pollution that would disrupt study of the solar system.
 
Tested by helicopter pilots, it remains faithful to reality within Flight Simulator. The EC145 helicopter is best suited to this type of exercise.
 
Geo-referenced and implemented according to official plans and aerial photos, this modelling includes:
 •Animations of Jean Rösch bezel (study of the solar surface) and Gentilly dome (observations of the solar system).
•A windsock responsive to wind conditions.
•Strobes of cable car's single pylon which only work at daytime.
•Photo realistic textures of buildings, reworked for a correct reading by FS engine.
•Partial reconstruction of the top 3D photo realistic texture in which the peak was built.
•A double span of 2550 meters of cable between the final station and Taoulet intermediate one.
