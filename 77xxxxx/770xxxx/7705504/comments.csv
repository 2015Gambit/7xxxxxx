Ice Age 1 have some problems in its file, well if you open it works fine but when u seek it forward it stops and plays nothing. I have tried in every player but this problem doesn't seems to be getting solved.

Other two parts are working awesome, quality is just spectacular its just the 1st part which is annoying me a bit. I hope u guys will reply. Thanks for your hard work, very much appreciated."
