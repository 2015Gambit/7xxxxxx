Mira, disobeying her parents, stays home alone for the first time during school break… She thinks herself strong and self-reliant, but will be proved wrong when fear comes upon her. The moments passed with her only friend Mathieu stir up her confusion. Gradually, fear permeates everything. A shadow hunts her, a shadow feeding on her refusal to grow up and become a woman. –unifrance.org
