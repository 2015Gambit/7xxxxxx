Well, sorry it took so long - HBO slow and had to do it twice.

Just know that the video is exactly pixel-per-pixel what HBO released. Unless you know
someone inside HBO - you don't get better video quality then this.
And who doesn't prefer AVI to FLV, even if it's still x264?
The 960 x 544 is 3/4 of 1280 X 720 and 50% more than 640 X 360
