,kikoto123,2012-10-09T13:55Z,"meh, I've seen smaller, but honestly, who uploads a picture on TPB?"
[T],YahSoft,2012-10-09T15:41Z,"@kikoto123
 As you can see, in my page of TPB, I distribute all 103 comics, Trailers, The Official Video Game of The Walking Dead. If you like The Walking Dead, or have a minimum of nom sense you asked: That stupid evaluates an upload without even have downloaded?"
