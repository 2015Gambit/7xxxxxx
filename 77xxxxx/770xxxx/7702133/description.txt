I Tested it (Work Like a Charm) .

Amazing Sounds and Game gets a Real crazy Atmosphere. You Will enjoy the game much more . It's not comparable with the bored european commentaries. 

Size of Japanese Commentary : 1.13 Giga , Other Commentaries less than 500 mb . 
So Japanese Commentary is Better .
