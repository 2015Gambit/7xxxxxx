| You are the once-trusted bodyguard of the beloved Empress. Framed |
| for her murder, you become an infamous assassin, known only by the |
| disturbing mask that has become your calling card. |
| |
| In a time of uncertainty, when the city is being besieged by plague |
| and ruled by an oppressive government armed with neo-industrial |
| technologies, dark forces conspire to bestow upon you, abilities |
| beyond those of any common man but at what cost? |
| |
| The truth behind your betrayal is as murky as the waters surrounding |
| the city, and the life you once had is gone forever. |
| |

| creatively combine your abilities and gadgets to eliminate targets |
| with your own ruthless strategy. |

| each mission, and the outcomes will change as a result. |
