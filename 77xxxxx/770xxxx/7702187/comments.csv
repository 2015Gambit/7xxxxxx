But how do I get this to work on my PS3?
Just got a PS3 and it's has all the updates which I think is bad.

Either way thanks for the up."

I think the last ps3 you can jailbreak was 3.something.

if you have anything newer than that, you are shit out of luck.

imo, i would leave ps3 jailbreaking for a few years until all the proper jailbreaks are out and sony has moved on to their next console. Thats what im going to do.."
,xmracer,2012-10-09T02:53Z,Thanks..
,racerx87,2012-10-09T05:04Z,"You have to have Dex firmware 4.21. Custom firmware 3.55 will not work with this unless someone has made an Eboot to make it work. With a little googleing you should be able to quickly find out if there's an eboot for custom firmware 3.55 to make this game work. 

Dex firmware (aka converting your 3.55 console or below to a DEX machine) Is the pretty much the only way to play any new game unless your lucky an someone patches the game for 3.55 CFW ("
,hotd54me,2012-10-11T02:05Z,"well good news is the release works, bad news is the only languages are french, german, spanish, and italian. no english"
,flaviud,2012-10-11T11:39Z,this release works??? is there a fix ? bercause it ask for fw 4.21. have you played this? 
,hotd54me,2012-10-15T04:50Z,"@flaviud
this works for 4.21 dex consoles, I already made a release for it should be online already converted to dex formatted emu file lookup ""dishonored dex hotd34me"" but as my previous comment mentions the current release is not in english. i made some modifications as far as i got was having the menus in english not the audio."

Please explain hex, I have 3.55 and have been using true blue. If I install 4.21 hex, would I be able to play backups from the hdd?"
,flaviud,2012-10-19T19:51Z,"vitor.fernandes1983    
you have to switch to dex version, and you will be able to play almost everything.  you find more details and tutorials on the internet. ps3news site for example"

Thank for the info. From what I can read, I can play games from disc only with 4.21 Hex. Having Hex is like having an official firmware, the only difference being you can go back to 3.55 easily. 
For this game I would probably pay full price, but, having already the true blue, I might just search around for a fix. 
Having to switch firmwares just to play a game is going to be troublesome."
,UKballerz,2012-10-23T07:45Z,Game works on the new Rogero-4.21 CFW. No fix needed.
,flaviud,2012-10-23T19:33Z,New cfw released rogero 4.21 :)
