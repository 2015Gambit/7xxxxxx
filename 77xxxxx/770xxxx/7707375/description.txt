Description: Ill Manors is not autobiographical, although it was party inspired by real events witnessed by the director and his friends. The film plots several days in the lives of several loosely linked characters in Forest Gate, Drew’s own home neighborhood, close to East London’s new Olympic Park. Aaron (Ahmed) is the downtrodden deputy to small-time drug dealer Ed (Ed Skrein), a relationship which becomes strained when the latter ruthlessly pimps out crack-addicted prostitute Michelle (Anouska Mond) to a string of sleazy clients to pay for his lost cellphone. This won’t be for everyone. There’s crackheads, prostitution, pedophiles, drugs and violence but there’s also an incredible empathy for even the most horrible characters. There’s also some good humour too. The acting’s fantastic. With some faces you know and some you don’t, each performance is bang on. Overall a deep, very well made film with terrific performances and a truly original style.
