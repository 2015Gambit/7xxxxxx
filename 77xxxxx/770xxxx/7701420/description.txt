Documentary that examines both sides' views in the campaign
to allow the planting of industrial hemp in the United States.
In the pro camp, celebrity activists including Woody Harrelson,
Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard and Ralph Nader put forward the
argument that American farmers, already finding it hard to survive
in today's economic climate, are being criminalised for going into
competition with their rival synthetic manufacturers.
