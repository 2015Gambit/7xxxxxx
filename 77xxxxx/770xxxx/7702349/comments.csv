,indianola,2012-10-07T03:27Z,"Can you emulate this on the PC?

Or do we have to wait for a PC torrent to release."
,2FnFast,2012-10-07T04:07Z,"emulating this on a pc would be too resource intensive, the games official (american) release is tuesday, so look for a pc-specific torrent to be out by then if not sooner"
,indianola,2012-10-07T04:22Z,Cheers
,Janchitox,2012-10-07T09:24Z,"I just can`t wait for PC version, so i downloaded this and now I`m waiting when it writes on my 360 HDD. Big thanks!"
,myciu,2012-10-07T12:16Z,"Can anyone confirm if it's working, please."
,Mehmet79,2012-10-07T12:27Z,"Thank you, thank you, I cannot wait to try this one..."
,notdone23,2012-10-07T17:43Z,I burned it with imgburn and it was verified. The disc is ok But when i try it in the xbox360 i get disc errors. Tried abgx360 but its not on there just yet so i burned without it. 
,Mehmet79,2012-10-07T19:52Z,"Don't know about the burned stuff, but the game works flawlessly on RHG console. To cite Chandler ""... this is the best game ever..."""
,Assassinprofessor,2012-10-07T23:50Z,"#Alik0
man,you've got the fastest torent here..proud of u bro..thank you very much, the game works fine :)))
im on LT 2.0 patched.."
,jimmymkd,2012-10-08T04:10Z,can u play this on PC with the xbox emulator??
,Jezz888,2012-10-08T09:53Z,"Working for me well. Burned image with imgburn 2.5.6.0. (Box patched for lt3.0). Just now have started first mission without any errors.
Thx, iMars."
,Assassinprofessor,2012-10-08T13:10Z,played a couples of missions but looked not so practical..i'll wait to play the PC version..
,VezRoth,2012-10-10T00:40Z,"I know this is a complete idiot thing to ask, but to play this do I need to hack my Xbox?"
,2FnFast,2012-10-10T22:11Z,"@jimmymkd
You can, but your dumb ass could never figure it out."
,Smallz94,2012-10-11T04:29Z,truncate method???
,2FnFast,2012-10-11T06:40Z,"@smallz94
depends on what your drive is currently flashed to, LT 2.0 seems to prefer truncate while 3.0+ prefers overburn"
,xbruce,2012-10-11T13:20Z,Working fine here. Great game!
,Smallz94,2012-10-11T20:01Z,Yea I got lt. 3.0 firmware so I guess I use overburn.. Thanks man :)
,salazam1,2012-10-11T21:46Z,"I couldn't get this to d/l, kept getting directory errors even after multiple attempts."
,Smallz94,2012-10-12T03:21Z,ok this is so gay.. i really want to play this game but i dont have a ihas drive to burn it HELP!! i used to two disc for the truncate method and the overburn and still no luck.. I have one more. 
,cloud4203,2012-10-12T04:06Z,"disc is unreadable error at starting screen, cant get it to play."
,Smallz94,2012-10-12T13:23Z,"I need a flash ihas drive to play these type of games. I really hope that black ops 2, halo 4 and other good games that are coming out are not going to need the ihas burner.. "
,2FnFast,2012-10-13T00:24Z,"@smallz
i didnt use an ihas for my copy, try injecting topology data into the iso then overburning"
,Tyclone,2012-10-13T19:38Z,"Didn't work for me either...2 Verbatims later, still nothing.

Failed Verification...

Just DL Res 6, Max Payne 3 and Dragon's Dogma. All worked fine."
,abdul86,2012-10-14T03:36Z,"In the meantime,
There is no verified rip of Xex CRC A2C32625 in the online database
 Failed to find a verified ini file for this Xex
 AutoFix Failed, Stealth is still unverified"
,punkfreak123,2012-10-14T08:40Z,Surprised this has not been verified yet
,Smallz94,2012-10-15T01:00Z,"@2FnFast

is that a Xbox back up creator "
,salazam1,2012-10-15T07:06Z,"wtf does ""Error: is a directory"" mean? I've tried like 8 times to download this and it gets to around 55% and gives me that crap."
,salazam1,2012-10-17T03:20Z,"so check it out, after doing all that changing target directory stuff and even installing uTorrent (was using Bittorrent) and getting the same result, I installed Transmission and it worked. Well, downloaded at least. I'm unraring it now to verify..."
,salazam1,2012-10-18T20:40Z,verified as of today using level 3 autofix in abgx! Thanks!
,jory4u2nv,2012-10-19T15:27Z,"Burned this game 4 times, 2 does not boot (overburn), 2 works up to the main menu then unreadable disc error pops-up, can't even start a new game (truncate). Burned Dishonored and got it to work on the first try. 

Can anyone confirm if this works using the truncate method, as I don't want to waste another disc.

Thanks! "
