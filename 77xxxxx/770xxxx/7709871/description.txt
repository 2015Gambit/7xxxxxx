ABOUT US

We are just  another small non-scene group who  started in         
2007. Since then we became a bit more skilled, now we have      
done over 3000 quality  releases, and we hope to bring you        
more of them.

NOTES

Our releases are always virus-free. If you think you found         
something  suspicious, it's  a  problem  of  your security      
software. All those  antivirus systems  will  never be too         
smart, so don't complain.  And always remember that we are      
not responsible for modified releases.                             
                                                                        
We aren't stealing releases. We respect hard work of other         
people and always  indicate  original authors of releases.      
We have permissions to use their files.                           
                                                                          
We are doing all this for fun  and  knowledge only. Always         
remember to support the developers if you like the product       
and its quality.
