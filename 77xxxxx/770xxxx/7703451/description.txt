The Mirror of Love is a book of romantic poems on the history of same-sex. Originally written in 1988 in a comic form (as part of an AARGH!, or Artists Against Rampant Government Homophobia, comic anthology) as a protest against England's anti-homosexual Section 28. This version, published in 2004, combines poetry written by Alan Moore and photos by Jos√© Villarrubia.
