The game begins with Pic powering on for the first time in a dusty abandoned laboratory. Uncertain about his purpose and why he was built, he wanders into the forest that surrounds the laboratory. This is where youΓÇÖll first start to use your camera to take photographs of objects. The first chapter of the game will hit you with a series of puzzles involving moving objects around within the levels, and itΓÇÖs easier than you think. If you want to reposition a box, simply snap a photo to capture it, then paste the picture back into the world and watch the box fall back out of it.
As you progress through Snapshot youΓÇÖll use the camera in new and interesting ways, like taking photographs of light and using it to interact with physics. Your camera even captures an objectΓÇÖs momentum. This, combined with the ability to rotate photographs as you paste them, leads to more complex and interesting gameplay. For example, if a snowball is falling when you snap a photo, the snowball will hurl upwards if you paste that photograph back into the world upside-down. You can even use this to take photographs of enemy projectiles and aim them right back at them!
