,apeg,2012-10-06T20:22Z,"Bahaha @bob9001a

Why the rar's... there is zero advantage to raring a video. I even have XBMC which plays right from the rar but for collection purposes i waist my time extracting rars for nothing?!?! is it just to filter out the morons who dont know what to do with rars?"
,jollyjr11,2012-10-06T22:27Z,"probably a usenet format, either way, it's a faster torrent upload while others still have not uploaded anything. For that, thank you. Could have unpacked it before putting it on TPB though."
,Lonsman,2012-10-10T06:34Z,"Bob9001a, you are a complete Eegit. It takes 15 seconds to regroup the RAR files...that is if you have HALF a brain. Stop whining!"
,Lonsman,2012-10-10T06:35Z,"And thank you for this, sceneline.
Much appreciated!!"
