The final two teams race to Boston in the Season 3 finale. Once they arrive, they are tasked with adding an authentic New England lobster dish to their menu. Two lobstermen rate the dishes and award the winner a head start to Maine, where they'll sell head-to-head one last time before host Tyler Florence counts their money and reveals the winners.
