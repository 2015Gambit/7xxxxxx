,foffster,2012-10-07T13:11Z,The sound isn't in sync.
,thechad2k8,2012-10-07T13:28Z,how bad? Is it out of sync all the way through?
,thechad2k8,2012-10-07T15:42Z,downloaded it..its NOT out of sync..played fine with vlc player. EZTVs releases are always great..i shouldnt have taken the troll bait..
,killthe9,2012-10-07T16:58Z,"It's true that a few scenes are out of sync. The construction scene was barely out of sync but went away right away in the Bond girls skit. So...overall, it's watchable, but there are slight errors. "

,soletar,2012-10-08T06:17Z,"There are many rumours that Daniel Craig is gay.... i might be insulted now, but am sure time will prove me right....Homosexuality is disgusting ( sorry, personal views)!"
,botcrawl,2012-10-08T07:51Z,"@soletar
Your personal views are disgusting and I hope one day they change. Take care. =)"

Let's keep the comments quality related.


Played great in vlc, no sync problems. Big thanks from a disgusting homosexual!"
,soletar,2012-10-09T06:30Z,"@botcrawl...sorry if you are a ""buttcrawler""... D.Craig is a good actor, but there are pictures of him online kissing a guy. He behaved like a faggot in this video and also he dressed in drag in a video dissuading Violence against women... so he is probably a fag like you

Whatever the case, open question to faggots, what is attractive about a fellow man's body? does the smell of excreta excite you???? Ewwwww!!!!!"
,soletar,2012-10-09T06:31Z,"Ok....good quality, thanks eztv...no thanks faggots!"
,musicdork,2012-10-09T07:22Z,Listen up kids. You can't spell *soletar* without  L-O-S-E-R.
,musicdork,2012-10-09T07:23Z,Oh... and thanks eztv!
,LaciBug,2012-10-11T18:36Z,@soletar Why don't you shut the fuck up with the bigotry. No one cares about personal views. It's obvious you're just looking for anything to argue with someone about.

,firexninja,2012-10-24T04:00Z,thank you!
,getApl8,2012-10-24T04:57Z,Don't get sucked in by the troll. One day he will get a girlfriend and his hands won't be so chaffed.
,headgear_362,2012-11-03T15:06Z,"If I was a bigot, I'd at least pretend to have an intelligent opinion. Thanks for the DL- VLC is the player for sync issues!"
