I regularly download EZTV files from here.  This was the first time this ever happened.  How about rather than being reactionary assholes, you take a second to ask what the problem is before just flying off on someone?

,romet6,2012-10-08T13:58Z,"I always prefer uploads from eztv, ettv, vtv and other similar trusted uploaders. They have uploaded thousands of files and none of them are bs (just do a search on them in here).

When piratebay shows it as a single mp4 file then it is an mp4 file, anyone who is naive enough to believe spammers like ""eotwtv"" deserves to be fooled.

Also, when looking for files, always arrange the results by seeders (""SE"") and pick the file in the top of the list because 99% of the time the most seeded torrents are not fakes."

If you are gonna try to stop people from torrenting, at least don't insult our intelligence (and make yourself look like idiots) by saying it is a password protected rar.  Especially when one click shows us that it is an mp4.  Say something that is at least somewhat plausible, like ""this torrent is 381.69 MB full of static"" or something like that.  Or you could always just get a life and stay the hell away."
,justincusack18,2012-10-08T16:28Z,"@romet6

if you arrange results by Leechers(at least on the movie section, seeders on tv section) you are more likely to get the most recent torrents, and the easiest way to determine whether a torrent is legit or not is to look for the green or pink skull next to the name of the uploader, if they don't have one then don't download unless your %100 sure its not fake. "
,akscals,2012-10-08T17:00Z,"guys there was a fake eztv version that had the episode name in the title, and it was 371 mb, this one is 381. im guessing everyone, like me, came back and looked for the eztv version to say its fake or pw protected. i liked at the file size and title first tho, and realized this is not the one that was up earlier, it probably got deleted for being fake. downloaded this one no problems"
,lindayy,2012-10-08T17:00Z,Thanks! Keep up the good work! :D
,romet6,2012-10-08T17:53Z,"@justincusack18

Why would you ever arrange it by leechers?
When you pick the most seeded torrents then you have the best chance of avoiding fakes and getting the file quickly. Piratebay should start arranging files like that by default, it would save everyone some time and greatly reduce the issues with fake torrents.

Personally I always check the name of the uploader on tv shows. Don't bother with some random guys and avoid the ""anonymous"" uploaders. Green skulls can sometimes also upload crap which is why it makes sense to stick with the few major uploaders that you know and have previous experience with.

Groups like eztv upload a large variety of different tv shows and they do it on the same day that the episodes are aired, so why bother with the unknown guys?"

I am using WDTV, PC-vlc202 and a bunch of other players and they all stuck at the same place in video, which gives me a hunch that the problem could be with the videos/encoding.....Thanks in advance "
,trace535,2012-10-09T01:14Z,"MicSokoli1912, 

Playback that stutters or stops indicates either a corrupt file, or that the hardware has insufficient CPU power to process HD video or in the case of a WDTV unit, the software may simply be buggy. In fact, according to the wdc.com website, their OS was last updated in 2009!

 Good work EZTV! Keep em coming!""

First -- keep saying the word ""fuck.""  It makes you sound really smart.

Second -- I've been using TPB for many years now.  When I saw EZTV in the name, I assumed -- from all these years of being on TPB and downloading EZTV files -- that it would be the same quality as every other EZTV file I've ever downloaded.

But that didn't happen.  I'm not bullshitting you or anyone else.  I downloaded the torrent.  It was a RAR file.  Believe me, don't believe me, I couldn't care less.  But know what you're talking about before you just start spewing shit at someone.  Why some of us got RAR files and others didn't, I DO NOT KNOW.  But I'm a legit user here and have been for many years.  The only time I ever comment is if something's wrong with the torrent, and in this case, for me, something was wrong with the torrent.

Or, in words you're more liable to understand -- go fuckin' fuck your fuckin' self.  Jerk-off..."

,rswa,2012-10-09T06:56Z," @ The_Lon and everyone else complaining about passwords and rar files:

you need to block all the fake 'click to download' banner ads. if i turn off adblock, i can see where it might be confusing, since right above the REAL download link (GET THIS TORRENT) is a FAKE download link (some convincing file download link).

ONLY CLICK ON 'GET THIS TORRENT', THE ONE THAT LINKS TO A MAGNET SOURCE. 

try it for yourself if you don't believe me. the magnet link will get you an mp4 file in your torrent client (utorrent, etc.). any other link will probably get you something you don't want."

no pw needed, it's just a good old mp4 file"
,obvious2me,2012-10-09T09:32Z,"People are getting tricked by advertisement placement?

Better yet: People still see advertisements?

I literally face palmed.

Seriously people Adblock has been available for about 7 year now, maybe more. I haven't seen ads for 5+ years since I first installed it (Excluding recent integrated ads with RT's content, but I can handle ~15 total ads in the last 5+ years)."
,The_Lon,2012-10-09T09:38Z,"@rswa -- thank you for taking the time to post advice instead of bile.  But, I did click the magnet ""get this torrent"" file.  If you other folks would check out the comments sections of a couple of the other Dexter 702 EVOLVE uploads, you'll see others complaing about getting rar files, too.

Maybe I got a RAR because I started downloading it something like ten minutes after it had been uploaded, I don't know.  I really don't know how it happened.  Apparently, whatever the problem was, was taken care of after I and some others DL'ed it.  Again, I don't know how that happened; I've never had a problem like that with an EZTV file before, but I assure EZ I will still continue to partake of their torrents in the future.  

I just seriously dislike when members here flame others for no damned reason other than to show they know how to say the word ""fuck.""  Ten bucks says those who do so don't have near enough balls out there in the real world to mouth off to someone like that to their face.

Again, thank you for your courteous reply, rswa.  It's appreciated.  "
,romet6,2012-10-09T10:19Z,"Actually, as tr19900 suggested, it seems like some people just assume that if the title says eztv then it must be eztv, even when the uploader's name is different.

I could understand if new users have trouble with torrents but The_Lon, if you have used Piratebay for years and keep making the very basic mistakes and then crying about it in the wrong place then if I was you I would go hide somewhere in shame instead of being so loud.

Always check the name of the uploader before downloading, if it's something different than what is written in the title then it is not a good sign.

There is no magic happening in piratebay that could give some users one version of a specific torrent and the others another version. Having used piratebay for years, you should already know this.

And seriously, DOWNLOAD only THE MOST SEEDED TORRENTS. If you search for ""Dexter"" and sort the results by seeders and you don't see the new episode at the top of the list yet then try again a little later because there is a good chance that the episodes with very few seeders are fakes.

Now you seem to be able to find this torrent again and again to keep posting comments so how about you press on the magnet icon (NOT the ""CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD"" link) and when the download finishes and you see that this upload is legit, you may write your apologies to the uploader."
