Thanks so much, God bless!"
,amp4mie,2012-10-08T17:36Z,Thank You TT. God Bless
,Clloud,2012-10-08T20:10Z,"@TorrentTracts: just a thought, and it may require too much extra work, so please just consider this a thought.

In the comments section where you list the titles, would it be possible to put the classifications with the artist? Many of these artists are new to me and it would be great to know if they are Praise and Worship, Rock, Metal and so forth.

Either way, thanks for this. "
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-10-08T22:45Z,"Clloud, love the idea. :) Problem is, I don't necessarily listen to much of the music I'm sharing. I have my favorites that I sample when they're introduced to me, sure, but beyond that I typically don't listen to everything I'm torrenting. So my opinions wouldn't count for much! hahaha But that's sort of why I sometimes post genres in my subject, because at those times, I have sampled more than my usual favorites."
,studog123,2012-10-09T05:18Z,"I have only fairly recently discovered your torrents, surprisingly almost all of the stuff from 2011 is still very active, which I am very glad of. You are inspiring me to add a christian collection based on release years. I'll have to look into how much work is involved, but wanted to thank you for all of your hard work on these torrents, please keep it up."
,shallondb,2012-10-09T08:40Z,"God Bless You TT, You are doing far more work than you realize !! your uploads are blessing a lot of people in Southern Africa who don't have the access to purchasing Christian Music."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-10-09T15:22Z,"Shallondb, that's awesome! :)"
,Tranqued,2012-10-10T05:29Z,"@TorrentTracts:

,TJSmith90210,2012-10-11T06:52Z,"Thanks TorrentTract for all your great work. If possible, can you please do discographies for The Echoing Green, The Choir, and/or S.F.C.? Also, do you have the new releases from Sixpence None The Richer or Charlie Peacock?"

[V],TorrentTracts,2012-10-11T15:24Z,"TJSmith90210, I just did a Charlie Peacock discography in September. And there's already a great Sixpence None The Richer discography here by another user. I'll look into those others to see if I have anything for you."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-10-12T02:11Z,"TJSmith90210, I will have discographies for both ""The Choir"" as well as ""The Echoing Green"" up here on The Pirate Bay for you momentarily.  But S.F.C confuses me.  Who are they?  Soldiers For Christ?"
,TJSmith90210,2012-10-12T03:14Z,"Yes, they are Soldiers For Christ (90's Christian rap group). Thanks again for the Echoing Green and The Choir torrents!"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-10-12T04:39Z,"TJSmith90210, I was somewhat surprised when I looked through my collection for you earlier today and didn't see any ""Soldiers For Christ"" in there.  Yet I knew of the band.  Sorry.  Wish I had some for ya."
,beanybeans,2012-10-12T12:51Z,Awesome uploads!! Hats off.. Ne chance on Martin Smith - God's Great Dance Floor Movement-3.. Thnx!
,Elchander,2012-10-14T23:24Z,"I have all of Caedmon's Call albums, but I had a HD problem and about half of the files don't work anymore. You wouldn't happen to have any of their music would you? Thanks for everything"
