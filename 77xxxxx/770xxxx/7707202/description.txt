2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

Another day, another 2+ gigs of Christian Music.  For those keeping count, with today's 25 new titles in this 44th bunble, we're now up to 1,150 releases on the year.

If you're a fan of praise and worship music, there's some good meat on this bone.  Be sure to check out Bethel Music's new "For The Sake Of The World", Daylight Worship's "We Are Weak - He Is Strong", or even the Buddy Fanjoy "Beatitudes" single.  If you prefer traditional hymns, Kenny Roger has you covered.  This isn't the same commercialized Kenny we all knew when we were younger.  I've got to admit that I must have listened to his new "Faith" album at least 25X since I added it to my collection last week.  Kenny's at his absolute best on this one!  Looking for some metal today?  There's plenty of it within this 44th bundle.  Inhale Exhale, Set Free, Behold The City, Onward To Olympas, and They Will Fall are a few that quickly come to mind.  Have you been waiting for the new Brandon Health "Blue Mountain" album to drop?  Your wait is over!  We also have a sample of Sandra McCracken's new album.  And for all of you Dara Maclean fans out there, Dara has a Deluxe Version of her 2011 "You Got My Attention" album that you're sure to want to check out.
