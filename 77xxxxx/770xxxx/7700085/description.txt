A concert to celebrate the 45th anniversary of folk-rock outfit Fairport Convention, 
filmed in March 2012 at the Union Chapel in north London, only a few miles away from 
the 'Fairport' house in Muswell Hill where the band was formed during the summer of 
1967. Today only Simon Nicol, whose parents owned the house, is still there from the 
original line-up, but the wealth of incredible songs and arrangements left by former 
members such as Ashley Hutchings, Sandy Denny and Richard Thompson remains at the core 
of the band's live shows. This concert's highlights include Matty Groves from the band's 
landmark Liege and Lief album and Sandy Denny's Who Knows Where the Time Goes, voted 
'favourite folk track of all time' by Radio 2 listeners...
