,cbboner,2012-10-07T15:40Z,"snakeye thanks for this torrent its great but i can confirm that the scenery has some minor bugs when i hit the ground textures and some buildings disapear, Corrent me if im wrong but is this a beta release or something i dont see this product on the latinvfr site!"
,cbboner,2012-10-07T15:41Z,"correcton, i see it on simmarekt.com, thanks anyway!"
[T],_SnakEye,2012-10-07T22:47Z,"I have not tested it myself, but those kinds of issues as you describe usually are caused by mis matching Scenery to the terrain Mesh you are running. are you using FSGLOBAL or similar Mesh product for that area?"
,roume666,2012-10-08T14:48Z,This is whats happening with it... The runway seem to disappear when you are taxiing on it.. It's either a texture or elevation issue.. Some of the buildings and trees are missing.. Might be autogen issue as well..! 
[T],_SnakEye,2012-10-08T18:35Z,I'll test it and let you know what I am getting.
,DakotaDC3,2012-10-11T09:24Z,No problem with the runway for me. But half of the island is missing the buildings and trees. Compare it with the screenshots on simmarket and you'll see what i'm talking about. There are autogen files missing. Hope someone uploads a complete version.

Same to me."
[T],_SnakEye,2012-10-13T19:13Z,"if I'll get hold of a complete version of this , I'll sure share it with you guys."
,DarkstarG,2012-10-26T14:37Z,"Hello Snakeye,

Again, thank you for all your uploads, but I must confirm that this scenery is faulty.
The autogen is missing all over the islands. I guess there are some files installed somewhere else..."
