James Patterson's bestselling PRIVATE series sees the world's most exclusive detective agency open a new office - in Australia! 

With the best detectives in the business, cutting edge technology and offices around the globe, there is no investigation company quite like PRIVATE.

Now, at a glittering launch party overlooking the iconic Opera House, PRIVATE throws open its doors . . . 

Craig Gisto and his newly formed team have barely raised their glasses, however, when a young Asian man, blood-soaked and bullet-ridden, staggers into the party, and what looks like a botched kidnapping turns out to be a whole lot more. 

Within days the agencyΓÇÖs caseload is full: from a missing businessman whose latest scheme was a step too far; to a rock star terrified heΓÇÖs next in line for the infamous ΓÇÿClub 27ΓÇÖ. 

But it is a horrific murder in the wealthy Eastern Suburbs and the desperate search for a motive that stretches the team to the limit. Stacy Friel, friend of the Deputy Commissioner of NSW Police, isnΓÇÖt the killerΓÇÖs first victim ΓÇô and as the bodies mount up sheΓÇÖs clearly not the last . . .
