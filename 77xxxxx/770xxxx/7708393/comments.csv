,Apoc_69,2012-10-11T02:04Z,"You should check again.. This is season 11. Mythbusters have been on tv for 11 seasons now. The order of the episodes is messed up, and you are outright wrong about your statement. Google that shit next time...  nobody has a few months gap in between active season episodes......"

i did google it, also being a huge fan of mythbusters and have been tracking them since season 8 (when i got a comp) i know for sure its second part of season 10. also, you obviously haven't seen futurama, they do the same thing. its only 1st half of season 7 with them and will continue jan 2013. every season since 7 of mythbusters has been broken into 2 parts, 13 episodes in the beginning of the year and 13 at the end. you dont know shit so shut the fuck up."
