We've been all volunteer since 1973, and the US military leaders think drafting soldiers is no longer a good option as it was 40 years ago. It takes  much longer to train soldiers today with the high tech equipment and recruitment standards are higher. Today's military knows that draftees would dilute and reduce the quality and effectiveness of the professional military we have today."
