,RocMarciano,2012-10-06T05:36Z,"ty, the event wasnt carried by my provider.. Hopefully this can download before the day ends but  i doubt it, only been up for 15 mins.

But it should be 10/10 like usual"
,basilc,2012-10-06T05:47Z,Thank you!
,DalGreen,2012-10-06T08:53Z,is this the FULL CARD?
,saffronsghost,2012-10-06T10:28Z,Lower res and higher file size than the other upload!  Why do people still do xvid?

From now on compadres, pick a trusted uploader, like S4A, and just downland without reading the comments."
,Dublin15,2012-10-08T01:53Z,I think everyone should comment with made up results so then everyone can read comments but still not know who won because one person will be saying red corner won the next will be saying blue corner won ... problem sorted
