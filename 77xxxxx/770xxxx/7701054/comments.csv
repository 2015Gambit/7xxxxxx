[T],jmanwf,2012-10-09T05:30Z,Audials One 9 It basically it takes a screen capture of the program that is playing and converts it to DRM free but with song and music it is way faster and you dont have to do a screen capture hope you like my quality of these files now very good quality thought i would do .flv files they are used on all computers
