,mikkelGets2You,2012-10-16T01:29Z,"Works, but freezes when Im trying to pull out any pokemon in Virbank pkmn center."
,rydillo,2012-10-16T23:55Z,"Works perfectly on DeSmuME for mac... Don't see how this is complicated at all... Make sure you have the right archive tool for 7zip files... comes with TWO ROMS the fixed one and the original which is why its 164MB... No patching needed. and the link for the ""working patch"" in the comments is the same exact thing fyi.. Great torrent though thanks!"
[V],Maverick2587,2012-10-17T12:39Z,"@rydillo

,billpao13,2012-10-20T13:08Z,It works :D
,djay62,2012-10-21T12:44Z,"Everything runs perfectly except you can't use the computer without it crashing..Kinda sucks, but still very much playable."
,djay62,2012-10-21T12:45Z,Computer as in the pc inside the game.
,Nounread,2012-10-29T07:59Z,"I haven't played a Pokemon game since the original Pokemon Red.

Is using the computer a big deal or do we need a fix?"
,Nounread,2012-10-29T10:23Z,ok so I got as far as getting my second pokemon. I tested the computer and I could deposit and withdraw the pokemon just fine. It didn't crash for me.
,Monkeybonelives,2012-10-29T21:59Z,computer does work in the start but after awhile it stops and if you want to complete the pokedex or be able to travel to areas to get legend/fav Pokemon you have to leave space in the party. 
,Nounread,2012-10-31T09:32Z,I've put 12 hours into the game got 4 badges. Still no problems with the computer. or anything.
,Monkeybonelives,2012-11-02T01:26Z,YA well good for you I just tried to play again got 5 badges and was working fine until a sec ago now cant remove Pokemon from computer without freezing so I'm happy its working for you but for the rest of us its just pissing us off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Monkeybonelives,2012-11-02T01:38Z,I must apologize for my pre comment warring to users if you use the action replay code for shiny Pokemon it will cause the freeze and make it impossable to play the game.
,darcslayer,2012-11-07T03:43Z,"it work 100%, i recommend this, thank you"
,itsdim,2012-11-08T14:00Z,"I can't possibly see how i'm doing anything wrong..

,PoopCircus,2012-11-17T06:21Z,I had the same problem how you fix it is when you open one of the ROM'S open PkmnB2_apfix.nds instead of PkmnB2.nds
,an0n10,2012-11-24T01:07Z,Is it possible to enable challenge mode on the rom?
