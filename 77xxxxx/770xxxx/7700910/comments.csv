,wooly143,2012-10-12T22:41Z,I was at the taping of this show.  I recorded it on my dvr but do nt have any way to get it off of the dvr.  there was a shot of the audience before the band went on that has been edited out.  any chance the person that posted this can repost with that part included? I'll be happy to seed the show once I grab it.
