,xardaspol,2012-10-09T00:44Z,"I’ve got an issue. I have fifa 13 multi 12 and crack from internal reloaded. The problem is that everything works fine until I try to play match, it crashes me to desktop, career mode is also bugged for me. I’ve got windows 7, direx 11, inlet core i5 2,67Ghz, 4gb ram, gforce gt 540M 1GB. I have selected fifa.exe and fifaconfig.exe “open as administrator”. so i can play only on match and it crashes again after finishing him. Any suggestions?"

,truthy,2012-10-11T10:24Z,"can anyone of you confirm, that this crack/loader works for other commentary languages than english, french or spanish (mexico) WITHOUT origin? I always get a CTD + Crashdump when trying to start a match with other languages ..."
,bartibo,2012-10-11T11:29Z,"Truthy yes i confirm that crack does not work with other languages, I trying to start the game with polish commentary but game crashes so i using original comentary and polish text."
,truthy,2012-10-11T12:31Z,"finally ... I got the loader to work with all other languages! the problem was that it only works with a mod/different/bigger data7.big + data7.sh file. Filesize 168 mb instead of 160 mb.

detailled instructions + dl-links can be found here:
http://www.soccergaming.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3311149&postcount=100

to sum up you have to:
1. copy/replace all the commentary languages you want in your fifa Game folder - normally 4 files per language (example: ger_de.bh, ger_de.big, german_de.bh, german_de.big) 
if you have the multi12 version they might already be installed idk (if not just mount the iso & replace the files)
and if you like me have the Reloaded-Internal-Version (Multi3/5/6 whatever version) you can find single commentary-language dl-links here atm (hotfile mirror): http://ddlgratuit.com/fifa-13-patch/fifa-13-commentaries/fifa-13-language-commentary-files.html
2. get the total commentary mod by doctor+ modified/bigger data7.big/sh from the soccergaming forum-link/Skydrive (I didn't find it anywhere else): http://www.soccergaming.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3311149&postcount=100
3. I don't know if this step is really necessary - however it doesn't hurt either especially if you don't have the reloaded-version:
- get FHL-BH-Editor from here: http://editing.myfhl.de/FHL-BH-Editor/ddet/id/10
- open the programm (it should automatically dectect your game folder etc) and click on regenerate all bh-files (+ext) then close it
3. run the game and select the commentary language you want ingame. Now it should work without any crashed whatsoever - excepct the fifa related ones. LOL"
,truthy,2012-10-11T12:42Z,"and yes, all this works WITHOUT that origin crap."

,Thoros634,2012-10-20T10:42Z,Virus in the RLDEA.DLL file. You cant play the game without the .DLL file. So this sucks.

,sevensins7days,2012-11-22T18:30Z,"If game crashes at play game, try this it almost works. 
Open game, Press Alt+Tab before selecting play game and refresh it as many times and then give play. It works for me !!"
