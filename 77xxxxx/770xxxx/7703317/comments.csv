,drdoodoo,2012-10-07T19:19Z,"Hahaha!! These are great and sadly, so true! Obummer is clearly the worst president ever in history. Only edging out Jimmy Carter earlier, but with his poor debate skills, it's clear who the worst is. Every single aspect of American life has decreased over the past 4 years. "

,BaggerX,2012-10-07T20:31Z,"The best way to recognize the truly deluded people out there is that they can only see this sort of stuff on the ""other side"".  Never on their side.  It's rather disturbing."

,txrabbit,2012-10-07T22:30Z,"These upload sure bring out the wingnut losers.  As well as scatologists like the aptly named drdoodoo. just spouts out the shit he swallows everyday on the False Noise channel.  What a pathetic bunch you are, sad pathetic losers."
,shamanist,2012-10-07T23:10Z,"The sad news is these whack jobs can't smell Romney's 'struggle with facts'. Maybe it is that 'magic' underwear that protects him. Obama is certainly not the best president we have ever had, but hardly the worst. We had Howdy Dowdy (2000-2008), Ronald McRaygun, Tricky Dick, Harding and Coolidge. On the other hand Eisenhower was a class act, a real hero, and an honest man: someone you don't see every day... from either party."
,LemonJ-Lo,2012-10-07T23:34Z,"Romney and the Republican party have no ""struggle with facts"" - they simply choose to ignore them and say whatever they think their at-the-moment audience of followers want to hear."
