These types of shoes are apparently not watched by those who know how to cap and upload.

I kinda wish msnbc / fox / cnn were capped. You can get bits and pieces from the web site - but nothing whole.

With one exception - This week with George Snuffleupagus [sic] whole shows

Anyone interested?

Anyway, many networks allow full episodes online, maybe you could learn to web-rip (and then tell me how) and be a big star in an underutilized area of the internet.

I didn't do any of this until ghost of encoders past moved me.
