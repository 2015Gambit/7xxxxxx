,Mem666au,2012-10-07T07:17Z,Not everyone watches on computer/laptop
,ChuChullain,2012-10-07T15:17Z,"Chenzo, there are much better players on the net than the one you advertise and yes... We can download this to watch on our PC... BUT... then one can hardly watch it anywhere else. So why should I download it twice? I'm from South Africa so series like these are keepers for us because its hardly likely that we will ever see it on our TV screens or even have the DVD sets available in our shops. So, .avi it is because most DVD players can play them. I'm sure we are not the only country in the world where this applies.  If its not an AVI file, it simply does not get downloaded. Sorry eztv.... "
