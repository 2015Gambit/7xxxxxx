What you mean my friend?Most applications are in exe format.Some are in msi format."
[V],DeGun,2012-10-09T12:38Z,"I meant if this AIO was an autorun/play & instal app... which will let yuh choose what to instal once new 7 is on yur hdd ... but nope it's not what i meant and i could have realised that by seeing there was 76 files in this torrent...! nevermind still good thought :) 

I had this kind of app when my blog was still open i've just found it back on my cpu and uploded a few (...) screenshots for yuh to exactly see what i meant.... you can have a look at'em there :
