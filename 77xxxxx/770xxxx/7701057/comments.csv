,lRyu,2012-10-07T05:21Z,"Anyone having an issue with the game not being readable after updating? Every other game is readable, just not this one."

,reno.99999,2012-10-07T19:18Z,Works on lt 2.0 after update for me.  Trunacate
,SuperTsubasa,2012-10-07T19:31Z,"thx for your answer reno.99999, now what about this being bluray format? what do i do after download? is there a iso in these files?"
,KockBurn,2012-10-07T19:43Z,Don't fucken tell people to truncuate because your to cheap or stupid to buy a Ihas burner and proper Verbs. All that does is flag your console for a ban. Idiot!
,Super-E,2012-10-07T19:49Z,i never seen a torrent go so slow i mean wow!
,AlkaidaKush,2012-10-07T20:38Z,how do i extract into one iso file??
,abernick00,2012-10-07T22:29Z,"I have the Ihas burner, but truncate seems to work better when you only have 2.0... my buddy that mods moved away, so im stuck with it for now... plus my laser is going, i dont know why, maybe years of playing burned verbs?? thanks for the info. still, why bluray??"
,DanQuiros,2012-10-07T23:32Z,"@alkaidakush Google WinRar, install it and then right click the file with the .rar extension and select  ""Extract here..."""

Another .iso version here."
,reno.99999,2012-10-08T00:14Z,"@cockburn, don't be a puss.  Everyone knows that if you are running 2.0 still you are patching topo so you are already flagged on xgd3 games.  What does money have to do with anything.  I have been patching xgd3 games since they cam out can't be arsed to update to 3.0, still no ban.  Also didn't tell anyone what to do, just said that it works for me on LT 2.0.  Hope that burn goes away.  Hey maybe try and troll in the kids section."
,reno.99999,2012-10-08T00:26Z,"hey cockburn, go troll in the kids section.  Didn't say anything other than it works for me running lt2.0 and using trunacate.  Has nothing to do with being cheap. Have been patching xgd3 games since they came out, still no ban.  And if and when it happens I will switch boxes, and rgh this one.  Tool"
,Smallz94,2012-10-08T02:45Z,Okay guys  this game works! :) it works with Truncate method with Verb. Disc !! 
,kmankiller,2012-10-08T05:51Z,hows the game?  Thanks uploader your a *ucking bad*ss.
,IzayaOrihara,2012-10-08T06:14Z,Works fine on LT+ 3.0.
,JauffreBlumpkins,2012-10-08T11:51Z,"Burnt with Ihas324b,TDK DL, and on LT3 and it works flawlessly. "
,DarkIceCreAm,2012-10-08T14:19Z,When will PC version be uploaded?
,shadbaze,2012-10-08T16:17Z,"reno.99999, do you own an hitachi or Samsung drive? Because on these, xdg3 games ar supposed to work on lt+ 2.0 afaik. On others drives it shouldnt work without the lt 3 topology.

I myself use an ihas burner and wouldnt recommend playing online without, since some data of the copy check supposedly is written on the outer area of the disc that simply isnt writeable without an modified ihas."
,dunit80,2012-10-08T17:30Z,This has to be one of the slowest loading torrents Ive ever downloaded. Has over 400 seeders and I cant even pull more then 100k/s. Seed people seed! Been waiting for this game for months.
,Cold71,2012-10-08T21:23Z,Who actually got this to work? I'm on LT3.0 and i've burned this game twice with an IHAS drive. Getting a disc unreadable error. All other games still work fine.
,dunit80,2012-10-08T21:43Z,"My friend got this to work perfectly. But hes using a chipped Xbox, running straight off a hard drive. If you are still wasting your time burning games. Find someone that will put a chip in your Xbox and use XBOX Image Browser to put the game on an external hard drive formatted to FAT 32 and you can just play your games straight off the drive. I will NEVER burn a game ever again. Best $50 I spend"
,droid05,2012-10-08T22:30Z,"First off just wanted to say thanks thenoobish for this upload, ive been waiting for this game for awhile. to all these people saying this game dont work if full of it. i download this game in an hour at 2mbps and burned just fine using clonecd and a memorex dvd+r dl 8.5gb 8x disk. Works flawlessly without any troubles. been playing for afew hours now and no issues. thanks again thenoobish."
,droid05,2012-10-08T22:32Z,"ohh and meant to mention that i truncated this game. before all the ihas people go crazy its only cus my ihas drive broke, ill get another one soon."
,Cold71,2012-10-08T22:40Z,@droid05 IHAS or truncate? If your using IHAS can you please confirm your setting for me? I'm also using Memorex. I've wasted 3 disc's now trying to get this to work. Thanks.
,Smallz94,2012-10-08T23:19Z,TRUNCATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
,Cold71,2012-10-08T23:22Z,"Thanks Droid05, don't use your IHAS people...use a standard DL burner and truncate. Took me 5 discs to get this working. "

,dopeboiv3,2012-10-09T00:59Z,"THIS GAME FUCKING SUCKS! LMAOOOOO! I WASTED A DVD DL, 10 HOURS OF MY WHOLE LIFE WAITING FOR THIS GAME TO GET DONE DOWNLOADING"
,Smallz94,2012-10-09T02:29Z,the game is pretty distant dude lol ^^ 
,jakenator,2012-10-09T03:24Z,"People stop bitching! Its fucking free!!! So stop complaining about speed and how to burn it. 

On another note thanks thenoobish the game works great (playing off usb rgh). Game was a little short (beat it in 2 days). But it was a fun game so thanks again."
,dueck,2012-10-09T06:25Z,Truncate worked great. 3 hours in and no problems
,twohearts_left,2012-10-09T07:19Z,"@Thenoobish
you have my gratitude. Thank you once again for your wonderful wonderful work!!!!!!!!

@dopeboiv3

you wouldnt know what a good game was if it smacked you in the vagina based on that statement. but ill respect your opinion....ya fuck"
,dunit80,2012-10-09T14:46Z,This game didnt win 50 awards at E3 for absolutely no reason. Nice to see a game with something semi original to it. Kind of reminds me of when Bioshock came out. Game works fine for me. Download speeds finally picked up. Im not burning though. Im running an xbox thats been chipped.
,ryunax14,2012-10-10T03:21Z,Hey thenoobish can you upload jtag rips please everyone is nw in RGH xbox thans men :)
,dunit80,2012-10-10T15:22Z,You dont need JTAG rips to run the game on a RGH xbox. All my games Im playing on mine are just regular rips. I just use XBOX IMAGE BROWSER to convert to ISOs to the hard drive and play.
,cnester1,2012-10-10T16:42Z,When will this game be verified through abgx360? or do single player games not get verified?
,DrossRotzank,2012-10-11T07:24Z,"Can I Update my xbox with this release? i mean, the first time that i do it a ""silent update"" attacks me! (Dragon Dogma, Max Payne, Ghost Recon Updates) Dishonored Update dosent erase my Flash!?!??!?! Thank U! "
,DrossRotzank,2012-10-11T08:34Z,Heeeeeeeeeeelp!!! 
,jasonismoney,2012-10-12T05:02Z,"2 Verbatims down, nothing to show. LT 3.0 with an iHas burner. Never had a problem with any other game (at least to load). One disc I get an unreadable message. The other doesn't quite make it that far. Frozen black screen. Trying the other Proton upload. "
,Smallz94,2012-10-12T13:25Z,^ don't use the ihas burner. Use your PC drive burner with imgburn truncate method. I did that and it works fine. 
,taloohi101,2012-10-12T14:28Z,Now verified by abgx360!! Burn and play safely :)
,Maltor2378,2012-10-20T06:33Z,Does anyone know where I can get Superman Returns for NTSC. That game is almost impossible to find. 
,SWSeigler,2012-10-21T04:55Z,"Will this work with Utorrent's ""USB to Xbox360"" thing?"
,mhall7,2012-10-24T08:30Z,"hey, downloaded, everything was great,
put it onto dvd dl, xbox reads it as a game, but when tries to play it, the screen goes black then goes back to the home screen.

and ideas how to fix?
thanks "
,nickxing,2012-11-12T06:14Z,Is USA region the same as Brasil region?
