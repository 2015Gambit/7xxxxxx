,peterlip,2012-10-09T12:41Z,"Been loving your work Gary.
Anyone having trouble with this one though?  It's simply just not starting for some reason.  Perhaps a bit more time required before panic sets in...

[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-10-09T12:51Z,"That's odd mate. What media player are you using? I tested it in VLC media (which I recommend), Windows Media Player and my TV USB port and it played in all of them ok. Maybe you have not got 100% of the file??"
,peterlip,2012-10-09T13:57Z,"Sorry, forget my comment.  Downloading now.
It was actually a downloading problem, not a playing problem.  
It just couldn't find any seeds with greater than 0%, and just sat there for 15 minutes not starting to download..  I went away for an hour, and on my return,  hey presto, it's well on it's way now. 
Tragedy averted..."
