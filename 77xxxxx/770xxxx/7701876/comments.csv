,mantikor777,2012-10-07T12:21Z,After that debate with Obama I find that Romney is not who I had been led to believe he was.  Thank you for uploading this - I want to learn more about the way he thinks.

[V],joshua13,2012-10-08T22:08Z,"Romneys ""apology"" claims both in 2010 when in wrote this and last month are bogus. Obama never did anything of the sort. see some rebuttal info at the link ( unless you are uninterested in the Facts like Romney)

,Lama2p0,2012-10-09T04:08Z,"Actually I already know the facts. I know that for a fact all sides have bullshit to tell. I also know for a fact that there's much more talking point than accusing Obama for apologizing to other nations in a 336 paged book... I believe most people look into this book to read those other points.. You have to look past the petty bs to see the real deal, and that's true for many circumstances.."
,shamanist,2012-10-09T06:54Z,"@Lama2p0: Your sentiments are worthy and honorable, but I will bet you dollars to doughnuts that most of those on the reich/right will go through the book glassy eyed, uncritical and adoring. And those on the left will probably not evewn bother with it. But thanks for trying!"
