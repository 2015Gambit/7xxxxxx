Request for feedback.
CC2AVI is really quick, really easy and does NOT work on (some?) standalone players.
XVID AVI takes a considerable time longer, but is the MOST compatible.
When I test both formats, I get almost exact rates of peers.
So, quick AVI or wait for compatible XVID?
Vote early, vote often.
