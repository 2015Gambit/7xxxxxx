A very good catholic movie. And a true story.

      St. Louis, 1905: Parish priest Father Dunne becomes aware of the plight of the city's newsboys, living on pennies and often homeless, and resolves to help them. Through inspired finagling and the gift of the blarney, he organizes a sort of "co-op" orphanage for increasing numbers of boys. Then he's faced with the tougher problem of stopping the escalating violence in inter-paper rivalry for "good corners"
