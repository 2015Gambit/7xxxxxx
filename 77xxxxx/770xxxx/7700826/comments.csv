,sub-seven,2012-10-06T07:59Z,"Why do people bother making 720p movies at less than 4gbs. The quality stinks. It may have the resolution, but that doesn't matter if it's so overly compressed it looks like shit. Just look at the screenshots.

People would be better off getting a DVDRip of the same size, it would be better quality than this junk. If you have bandwidth restrictions, then go buy the damn movie you cheap bastards, you aren't doing yourself any favors."

You do need about 4GB to do a 720p movie in very good quality. 

2GB movies  will generally have Noise Reduction, and show banding a some scenes.

700 MB 720p movies like here are full of compression artifacts everywhere.  Suitable to preview a movie or watch on a laptop.

YIFY small rips would look better if they were 540p. 

YIFY sound has actually improved a lot. It used to be ~50KB/s, and was painfully distorted, now it is more dull and compressed but not as bad as it used to be. So maybe they can figure out that dropping resolution would actually improve video quality. 

My personal 540p HDTV rips look MUCH better than YIFY 720p rips. "

Yify encodes are not better than any good encoder group.

No good encoders waste their time doing high resolution, low bit rate encodes because they know you get better results by going to a lower resolution. 

Case in point. 
I did my own encode of Batman Begins to compare with YIFY.
No special tuning at all, just defaults, single pass Q22.

Mine is labled m, YIFY labled Y.

(if links don't work, copy paste to a separate window).

Look at his face, his hair and the texture on the seat  behind him. It is all better in my encode, despite it being smaller in size and lower resolution.

It is better BECAUSE it is lower resolution.  Going to low bit rates on higher resolution smears away details and increases artifacts.

YIFY encodes would be better if he kept the same bit rate and dropped his resolution.

The rips are fine for the size. I watch on 42"" LCD and it looks great. You can't compare half a frame of an entire movie and conclude that YIFY's rips in general are no better than SD rips. That's ludicrous.

The only thing YIFY could improve would be to give the same bitrate for longer movies instead of keeping the same size. That's probably the case with Batman Begins which is runs at 2h:20min (YIFY's rip@850MB=6,1MB/min), this movie is 1h:43 mins, YIFY's rip 700MB=6,8MB/min that's more than 10% bitrate... 

Get YIFY's 1080p rips under 2GB if 720p under 800MB is not good for you."
,CosmAvngr,2012-10-12T02:56Z,"@Manuel

I DL YIFY encodes of movies I don't care that much about. So I have seen a fair number of them, and all of them have been fairly mediocre with often with visible artifacts. Rock of Ages and Prometheus both had annoying artifacts in them recently.

For movies I really like, like Batman Begins I get a real decent encode, I have an 8GB release of that with multi-channel sound. 

The comparison above is representative and matters because I was finding that my personal HDTV 540p encodes I do from WTV files look better than YIFY 720p encodes.

So I re-encoded BB in 540p, to smaller size than YIFY BB, and it was more detailed and looked better. That is with no special tuning or anything.

I really can't believe so many people don't realize that going to smaller resolution is a better solution for low bit rate encodes, they come out with more detail and less artifacts. 

They just see 720p and small size. Sure it is technically 720p, but it is more smeared than if it was 540p encode at the same bit rate. "
,ManuelRivero,2012-10-12T22:42Z,"@CosmAvngr

I think x264 works much better at higher resolutions, I'll take YIFY's 720p encodes any time over same sized 540p rips.
In general the picture will look much sharper and detailed than the 540p resized on the LCD which will look blurry. Watching really closely on your PC you might find a scene or two where the 540p might look more detailed in a spot.
But I agree if you really like a movie you should buy the Bluray or get a 1080p >4GB rip if you can't afford it."

I liked this movie, its a little gorier than the first but if you can take the movie for what it is is pretty good with some good comedy moments thrown in....... I'll be back, no i'll be back, you've been back enough so i'll be back!

This does sound a little strange mainly near the start i thought but it's still fine, the video is not perfect and looked a little grainy in parts, there is russian dialogue and the names of places that come up on screen are also in russian.
Also the subs are for the english speaking parts too so you need to keep turning them on and off.

I think it should be labelled as an R5 Bluray personally.

But hey its free and thanks goes to YIFY."

V: 8 - could be sharper/clearer, source probably R5 stuff.

The movie could be much better. It's more of a parody on action flicks from the 80's than anything else. It lacks substance.

I liked JCVD's scenes, pretty good, right level of cheese, felt real, not too much self indulging jokes. Final fight not too far out over the top didn't feel fake like every other slapstick fight in the movie.

It feels rushed, the script, the filming it looks like they rapped this up in a couple of weeks."

Doesn't feel like the Expendables I used to watch. More of a parody than actions. For example in Chuck Norris' part."

Neither video nor audio look like HD. More like a DVD i'd say. But it's still very good."

The audio is the main issue for me as it is rather mediocre with poor quality moments (evident as u have ripped this into a small file). 

The subtitles dont match the actual dialogue in terms of what they actually say and at time, its out of sync. 

The title and movie subs for locations are in RUSSIAN (i.e. this is ripped from the Russian Blu-Ray version). Tho this is no biggie overall.

You can tell its Blu-Ray but obviously the quality isn't up to 720p standards (fuzzy at times due to the rip). Its highly watchable but could be better.

Tho overall, I generally appreciate ur torrents YIFY. Keep up the good work but this is a rather inferior upload vs ur other ones. "
,LedBull,2012-10-24T20:32Z,"I asked this couple of time but no luck with a answer, maybe this time :-), when I download 720p movies I have problem with sound, picture and sound are not in sync, but when I download 1080p movie all is fine. I am talking about Yify's uploads. Does anyone have answer.
Thank you in advance! "

DO NOT BOTHER. the audio quality of almost all yify torrents are terrible.. wonder how he can get 700mb '720p' rips? and why he never lists audio quality? because the audio is so bad it is like 128 kb/ps mp3! if you are thinking of watching this or any YIFY torrent on a high end home theatre sound set up, DON'T BOTHER. terrible artifacts all through, so hyper compressed that as soon as the dialogue stop the background noise jumps to 10 times the level..

People need to boycott crappy audio in rips! No point having a small file size when the file is useless!"

Plz upload dark knight rises!!"
,SrMLove,2012-11-14T03:19Z,"@xngjamesx: really chuck norris was the breaking point.... perhaps if he just kicks you in the throat... then will he live up to your high expectations of the expendables... 

chuck norris should of been in the first one anyway... the thing is... he believes in useing his hands instead of guns(or any other firearms). i would consider that to be more classic... not too mention he is much older than most of the cast. before you talk shit about something you might want to do some homework on the subject.... instead of talking out of your ass. my guess is during the peak of chuck norris's career you were but only a sparkle in your daddy's eye. "
,24to1,2012-11-19T06:23Z,"I appreciate your ups Yify but as someone who encoded since the beginning of H.264 and far far before that I can say that 700MB's flat pushes it. I expect the video to be decent when I download but work on the audio...on my uploads I include a 2ch HE-AAC Pro Logic encoded track at 64kbps and a 6ch track which could be anything from a full blown DTS-ES 1.5mbps track or a 128kbps HE-AAC 5.1 track that VLC can output to any HDMI receiver, quality is good too. Just a friendly suggestion :)"
