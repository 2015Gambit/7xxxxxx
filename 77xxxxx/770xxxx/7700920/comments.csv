,Helmer2,2012-10-06T12:36Z,"AVI, YES!"
,genocide44,2012-10-06T14:09Z,does this rip have no pixelation glitches ?? 
,iamdavidchang,2012-10-06T16:42Z,Thanks for the avi.! Been searching for this but most of them are mp4 out there
,machspee,2012-10-06T17:03Z,"funny how people get surprised that its an avi.

Its simple. Download the mp4 version or the hi definition mkv version and convert them to avi using a video conversion software. It only takes 10 minutes. "

,vilagirls,2012-10-07T22:56Z,thank you so much
,insidce,2012-10-09T04:31Z,or just watch the mp4 because they're better?
