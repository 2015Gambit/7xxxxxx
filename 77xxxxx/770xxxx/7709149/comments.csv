,ristopalazzo,2012-10-09T10:35Z,"Yes, I have all of their albums on vinyl and I'll get the rest of them ripped and up here when I get the chance."
[V],jmz619,2012-10-10T02:45Z,Hey man i never had a chance to download this and there's no seeders can you reseed there's 2 people stuck at 64%
,ristopalazzo,2012-10-10T04:59Z,"What exactly do I need to do for that? I left it running all night and day and the Up Speed is active so I don't quite understand why it's not working. Remember, new guy here."
[V],jmz619,2012-10-10T05:27Z,You're seeding now. Sometimes with initial-seeding enabled your client stops seeding once it notices another seeder that peer must have did a hit and run and stop seeding. It's going good now should be done soon.
[V],jmz619,2012-10-10T05:35Z,"Oh, also right click on it and press FORCE start it may go into your que if you're seeding other torrents and not seed until those are at a reasonable ratio. Do force start if that is happening."
