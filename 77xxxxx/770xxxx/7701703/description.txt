NOTES:

Ok took Hp's release and cleaned it up some ....the video was a small res mpeg file and contained
borders all round and cam does move now and again.Also the video on this had alot of glare and colours
were off .
Audio decent cam audio....could be better but also heard alot worse.

Workdone ...pulled the top right corner of the video up as there was a black border that kept appearing,then
cropped the other borders and resized to a better res to fix the AR issue.
Upscaled the video as it was really small ...but doing this makes any faults stand out alot more.
So i need to reduce the video noise then and fix the colouring ....for this it was a simple HQ smoother and then
rgbeq to level out the colours.
The colours near the end did change so tried to fix it best i could for both changes.
Finally needed to add some sharpness back ....but not too much.

Audio stripped and cleaned in AA and then remuxed back to our encode.

Not the greatest of cams but more than watchable ....enjoy folks
