Deep in the heart of South Wales, in the quiet and picturesque rolling countryside known as The Valleys, nine youngsters are currently dreaming of a life of stardom, limousines, flashing paparazzi bulbs and adoring fans. Unfortunately itâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s going to take a small miracle to become the next Tom Jones, Catherine Zeta-Jones or erm, Steve Jones.

,affking,2012-10-08T08:52Z,This looks interesting. Cheers Gary.
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-10-08T09:26Z,"Cheers. I don't think I will continue uploading this show coz EZTV are doing it and they are the best!! I have gotten so much stuff off them, they are LEGENDS!!
You can find the torrent to episode 2 here-

If EZTV and TvTeam are slow to upload it and I see it, then I will do it :)"
,rheeby101,2012-10-11T12:32Z,"thx gary, could you please put more up, im dying to see the next episode and the others are not working :) "
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-10-11T13:20Z,"The only version of this I can find is the same file as EZTV and TvTeam's one. It starts playing, but I get an issue with trying to skip forward in the show. This happens on both VLC and Windows media. So I converted it to an avi. If more people are finding the same problem and cannot watch it, let me know. Then I might upload my converted version. I don't like doing that coz it might be seen as disrespecting the original capper of the show???"
,dangerousdonkey69,2012-10-14T01:22Z,"Gaz, firstly you are a legend, i download lots of ur uploads! Really appreciate your work. Secondly, please upload episode 2. I can see how it could be perceived as disrespectful to the original capper, but it does not work, so it is more respectful than disrespectful to put a working version up :) Thanks again for all your efforts "
,rheeby101,2012-10-14T09:56Z,Yes Please gaz !!!! im dying to see it
