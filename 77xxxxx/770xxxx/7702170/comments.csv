,Ahsoka420,2012-10-06T22:06Z,"Thanks SCSA420 for the 3 releases today. Two 720p and a 1080p You're the man not even ""The Scene"" has a 1080p The Clone Wars S05 release out :D May the Force be with you always............"
,UAofE,2012-10-07T03:46Z,Thats because there is no 1080p version. This is just an upscale of the 720p broadcast.
,Leiss,2012-10-07T11:19Z,awesome dude :)
[T],SCSA420,2012-10-07T14:11Z,Actually you're wrong UAofE  because I captured it in 1920x1080i from the Cartoon Network HD channel then converted it from 1080i to 1080p with Handbrake. This capture was never in 720p.
,hoodbag,2012-10-07T14:58Z,"The last one was improperly deinterlaced, giving jerky playback at 29.97 fps. I think we can safely assume the same here.

You should detelecine, not deinterlace."
