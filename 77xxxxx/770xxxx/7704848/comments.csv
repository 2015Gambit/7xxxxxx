,mdx2035,2012-10-08T10:05Z,"FOR THOSE WHO HAVE A QUESTION STRIKING ""WHAT IS INTERNAL?"" REPEATEDLY.
ANSWER (by the uploader himself):-

Note: This release is meant for our sites, its ops and users, and those who
request it. We've labeled it ""INTERNAL"" because the DRM is bypassed using a
loader. The game works, but it's not how we would usually release a crack
A more proper way of cracking it exists, but would take extra time. The
rules we follow also do not allow for loaders of this kind to be released,
and it seems unlikely that new rules will come."
,mdx2035,2012-10-08T10:09Z,"Guys please seeeeeeeeeeeed......... let the others download as well...

has anybody done with installation? how's the game by the way? how about the new features?"

,rico1987,2012-10-08T21:48Z,"Here is the solution for the crash before starting the match:
1- Copy the crack to the game folder.
2- Download the origin : http://www.origin.com/ie/download.
3- Sign up for an account in the origin.
4 -Open the origin then select ((Application Settings)) then go to ((Browse Game Installers)), an empty folder will be opened.
5 -Copy the whole FiFA 13 folder into that empty folder, then run the game from that folder.
6- Enjoy playing the matches.

NOTE : If the game asked you for a key to play online, just press cancel and it will continue.

The problem is that everything works fine until I try to play match, it crashes me to desktop, career mode is also bugged for me. I’ve got windows 7, direx 11, inlet core i5 2,67Ghz, 4gb ram, gforce gt 540M 1GB. I have selected fifa.exe and fifaconfig.exe “open as administrator”. so i can play only on match and it crashes again after finishing him. Any suggestions?"

I had the same issue at first

Before you start the install, click the button that shows the destination folder, and change it to (C:) -> Program Files(x86) -> FIFA13

I already had another EA game so I put the FIFA13 install in the ""Electronic Arts"" folder. Hope that helps"

,dammR,2012-10-09T20:19Z,"Hello every one

 I have a request to all you all.

 I have downloaded Fifa 2013 from a different torrent but the problem is that on executing the ""setup.exe"" file it prompts me for a activation key after asking for accepting terms and condition and installation directory.
 Or else it gives me an option to redirect to a web page which asks to complete a survey in return for the activation key(which never works).
 Now my point is that I have downloaded all the data.*** packs of the game and the only requirement is for a proper ""setup.exe"" like available in this torrent which could simply skip the activation key part during installation.

 SO MY REQUEST TO YOU IS PLEASE UPLOAD THE ""Setup.exe"" file of this torrent SEPERATELY.

 Like me many others are facing the very same problem and definately could not bear to redownload 6.5 gb of data with a 256kbps connection.


 Please do it if possible..."

,truthy,2012-10-11T10:07Z,"to all you people experiencing crashes/freezes: keep in mind that the game is still very buggy until they release a patch. if you followed the instructions precisely (eg running fifaconfig BEFORE playing, block all Inet Access) and it still crashes it's very likely that it has something to do with fifa bugs rather than the reloaded crack. you don't need that origin crap for this release and mine works fine.

here is a good collection of various fixes for freezes and crashes:
http://www.fifa-infinity.com/fifa-13/fifa-13-bug-fixes/

to all you people having the multi12 version AND having selected other commentary languages than the ones included in this release english, french or spanish (mexico):  so far it will crash after you try to start a match (at least for me) - so my conclusion is, that the loader only works for these 3 commentary languages or that it's yet another fifa bug. does anyone know a fix for that? and no I don't want to install any origin crap! waiting for another crack or a patch seems to be the only thing to do ... alt-tab before didn't help."

to sum up you have to:
1. copy/replace all the commentary languages you want in your fifa Game folder - normally 4 files per language (example: ger_de.bh, ger_de.big, german_de.bh, german_de.big) 
if you have the multi12 version they might already be installed idk (if not just mount the iso & replace the files)
and if you like me have the Reloaded-Internal-Version (Multi3/5/6 whatever version) you can find single commentary-language dl-links here atm (hotfile mirror): 
http://ddlgratuit.com/fifa-13-patch/fifa-13-commentaries/fifa-13-language-commentary-files.html
2. get the total commentary mod by doctor+ modified/bigger data7.big/sh from the soccergaming forum-link/Skydrive (I didn't find it anywhere else):
http://www.soccergaming.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3311149&postcount=100
3. I don't know if this step is really necessary - however it doesn't hurt either especially if you don't have the reloaded-version:
- get FHL-BH-Editor from here:
http://editing.myfhl.de/FHL-BH-Editor/ddet/id/10
- open the programm (it should automatically dectect your game folder etc) and click on regenerate all bh-files (+ext) then close it
4. run the game and select the commentary language you want ingame. Now it should work without any crashes whatsoever - excepct the fifa related ones. LOL"

this game installed perfectly for me. if it isnt working for u, it must be a problem with the installation not with the torrent."

press alt+tab just before starting the match and that should surely make your game work ..

Any reply would be appreciated !!
Thank you :)"
