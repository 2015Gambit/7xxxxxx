,nominae,2012-10-06T00:28Z,please all support the artist and buy the album on OCT 9th
,Nereus2013,2012-10-06T00:40Z,Where are all the seeders?
,nominae,2012-10-06T00:49Z,im sorry for the seed problems i am trying to do what i can if anyone has any pointers to speed this up id be more than happy to take suggestions 
,Abyssul,2012-10-06T03:37Z,It's stuck at 99.8% where I had a 3MB/s download speed until then. We need one seeder to get the last bit for the rest of us downloaders.
,canadianice,2012-10-06T03:45Z,99.8 what an ASSHOLE
,nominae,2012-10-06T05:41Z,"i want to say sorry to everyone the problem should be fixed ...this was my first upload and i knew i had something that wasnt on this site...everything should start working pretty soon i had to research a lot on how to handle initial seeding...it didnt help that my laptop had died while i was out of the house but now i will be seeding for the next week and there should be no problem, i've deleted the file and downloaded it myself at a very nice speed...sorry for the trouble, enjoy the album and wish me luck on my next release."
,BoronNitride,2012-10-06T05:52Z,The other .2% is the jpg. I can listen the album in its entirety.
,nominae,2012-10-06T05:56Z,the file is officially fully seeded by me now
,wlcked,2012-10-06T06:08Z,"I would just like to say thanks. I downloaded in record time. Nominae made some noobish mistakes but he did not do them intentionally and I think we should all appreciate his effort to fix the problem. 
LOVE THE ALBUM AND I WISH YOU CONTINUED LUCK IN YOUR FUTURE RELEASES. 

you people should really be ashamed."
,canadianice,2012-10-06T07:34Z,"Garbage, Listen to RUSH---Clockwork Angels---no comparison!!!!   RUSH RULES!!!!"
,nominae,2012-10-06T07:49Z,"to be honest, i dont know if this is or isnt from a direct cd....i originally found it at 128kbs and 2 days later i found the 320kbs on the same site...it is very possible that someone just converted it up.....oh...and yes...rush rules...but by the simple fact that you draw that comparison says something to the talent of coheed"
,Abyssul,2012-10-06T08:22Z,Thank you nominae for the upload.
,Abyssul,2012-10-06T08:23Z,"I'm helping seed it now since I hit 100%. Quality is about an 8/10. Definitely sounds like it was converted up from 128kbps, but a spectrum analysis shows the frequencies curve off at 20 kHz which is normal for 320kbps. It's something to hold onto until the album comes out, and we can get ahold of a really good CD rip."
,nominae,2012-10-06T08:52Z,"im actually going to download the itunes version when it hits ...it has a bonus track called ""the homecoming"" but yes...i agree....until a better version surfaces...this is what we got...take it or leave it"
,Man_no9,2012-10-06T09:31Z,"Tomorrow night, those who preordered the Collectors Edition of Aftermath will be recieving a download link to the album and all the bonus tracks/demos per email since the CE will be delayed by a week or so. It's bound to be high quality (hopefully.) I'll share it myself, if I have the chance; I have to go travelling monday morning."
,Abyssul,2012-10-06T16:47Z,"This album is slightly underwhelming. I was expecting a little more since I heard Domino the Destitute. A lot of the songs are soft or feel like intros. Vic the Butcher and Domino are the only worthy songs, but maybe it will grow on me."
,beano311,2012-10-06T20:53Z,"Thanks for the upload nominae... no one else had it or were nice enough to upload it, so screw all those people complaining about your upload.

As for the album, just from a quick listen it is light years better than YotBR, a lot of the riffs remind me of Good Apollo Vol. I.

Also, comparing Coheed to Rush is just stupid..."
,OsamaBinJackin,2012-10-08T00:11Z,"thank you thank you thank you, ive been looking forward to this for a while"
,MegaDroogie,2012-10-09T07:17Z,"I really wanted to go legit for this album. You know - Go out and buy it, like a decent fan. But payday is two weeks away, and it's not until two days AFTER I see Coheed in Columbus. And TPB just calls out to you...""Download me"" ""Seed me"". It gets me every time..."
,TtToker,2012-10-09T18:15Z,Bonus tracks anyone?
,nominae,2012-10-09T20:28Z,ill be uploading the bonus tracks very soon ...link will be here and on every afterman torrent
,nominae,2012-10-09T20:55Z,http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7711519
,nominae,2012-10-09T21:13Z,^^ thats the bonus disc
