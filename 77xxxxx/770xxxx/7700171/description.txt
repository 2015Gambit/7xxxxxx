Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, October 5 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex runs down the latest on efforts by the United States, NATO and the European Union to kick-start Syrian intervention under the pretense of protecting Turkey, establish a no-fly zone and work with CIA mercenaries and al-Qaeda to overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad. 

Alex also covers the latest on the economy as it continues to implode despite Obama's feeble attempt to sugar-coat dismal unemployment numbers following his pathetic showing during the presidential debate.
