,Zaskava,2012-10-09T16:43Z,"I am sorry I have slow bandwidth, but I do what I can."
,enonumus,2012-10-09T20:43Z,"For those wondering, this version has the choppy frame rate the other versions have.  It's been re-encoded to 29.97fps which makes the file size larger, but of course it doesn't improve the frame rate.  Aside from the frame rate issue the quality is good."
,riceknight,2012-10-09T21:17Z,Agree with enonumus... currently there is no proper HQ release of this :(

Sad."
,skoumoun,2012-10-10T21:56Z,"There's actually a 1080p version with constant 30fps available on some other torrent site.

Compression is still far from flawless though.

So wait for this or maybe also a proper 30fps 720p.

,Zaskava,2012-10-12T01:30Z,Will upload 1080p later.
