The Mark One features a Fender Rhodes MK I 73 electric piano with a warm and intimate tone perfect for a rainy day. This king of electric pianos played through a vintage tube combo and captured by rare vintage microphones is a truly unique instrument. The tone can go from a smooth enthralling caress to a tight and crunchy sound for a dense arrangement.

The playability of this instrument will invite you to just sit down and play. The included ExploreMaps let you choose from classic Rhodes sounds to spacious textures and fat bass sounds. The Mark One is a rare and one of a kind instrument that fits perfectly both on stage and in the studio.
