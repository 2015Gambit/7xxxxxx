,_antongirdeux_,2012-10-07T16:30Z,there's only one way to find out...try it for yourself. i don't have a NDS/3DS since I exclusively play on emulators ;)
,_antongirdeux_,2012-10-07T17:08Z,try out CRX-3000's upload...it might work on you! ;)
,Uberyoshi,2012-10-07T17:25Z,I have a fully updated ds two Ill confirm if it works or not after download is finish. downloading at .3 kb this may take a while
,Dave2028,2012-10-07T17:38Z,"You mean CTR-3000? His rom is great, but it's unpatched. I patched it myself, but still doesn't work. I'm just gonna wait for R4i to update their damn firmware."
,Phazze,2012-10-07T19:18Z,"CRX works flawless on Supercard but I'm getting this to test on my brothers Acekard2i, because he gets freezes with that rom."
,_antongirdeux_,2012-10-07T21:02Z,who just finished this upload? are there any thoughts? :s
,GMTN,2012-10-08T00:27Z,"
I did it for my nephew on the DSI XL and it seems to work fine.  Loads up and plays.   Acekard 2i, Akaio 1.90"
,xuperlimit,2012-10-08T00:52Z,This worked fine with Desume but with No$Gba I got a black screen after the intro. Anyone know how to fix this? Desume doesn't run well with my PC.
,Asd133bay,2012-10-11T18:12Z,"Download time 22 sec ^_^
BTW THANKS :)
i 'll play and write again "
,Asd133bay,2012-10-11T18:20Z,"nice the xp working ,too!
gj ^^"
,ESH72882,2012-10-12T03:02Z,I have Supercard DSTwo and this file works great. No exp. problems and it runs smoothly.
,_antongirdeux_,2012-10-13T07:20Z,TY 4 D FEEDBACK GUISE! :D
,alfjalkwjfejawjkefa,2012-10-13T21:47Z,"Just letting you guys know that this isn't fully patched. Two features need to be patched that I know of:

Swarm (perhaps all random events? haven't paid attention)

Egg (they don't hatch)

Works fine otherwise."
,Glocc5000,2012-10-14T23:08Z,eggs dont hatch on this rom?
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-10-20T07:33Z,"Cool thanks. This seems to have solved the experiance problem with the acekard 2i running akaio 1.9.0.

However maybe someone could confirm that the experience is correct? First battle gave me 96xp, which is only 2 short of 2 whole levels. 
Seems a lot. Previous games would usually up it by a single level almost exactly."
,.235.,2012-10-28T16:05Z,"does not work, 0/10"
,s0nicf,2012-11-09T20:06Z,I'm using an iTouch DS and after going into the wifi settings and exiting I got a whitescreen. After that I tried to restart and it froze. Then everything on my MicroSD card was unreadable! I had to reformat it. So yeah don't go into the wifi settings via this rom.
