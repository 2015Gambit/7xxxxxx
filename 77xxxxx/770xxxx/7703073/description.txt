Adventures of a gentleman thief in Victorian England

A dashing aristocrat turns criminal in this classic British drama

Meet A.J. Raffles (Anthony Valentine, Callan, The Commander), a gentleman of leisure and a first-class cricketer. But when heΓÇÖs not dining at his club or taking wickets for England, heΓÇÖs often engaged in his other favorite activity--relieving the wealthy of their riches.

A master of accents and disguise, Raffles is assisted by his old school chum "Bunny" Manders (Christopher Strauli, Only When I Laugh). Always eager but often bewildered, Bunny follows his friend into the most complex of predicaments and deadliest of situations, likely as not pursued by the dogged Inspector Mackenzie (Victor Carin, SutherlandΓÇÖs Law) of Scotland Yard.

Anthony Valentine and a stellar cast of British actors deliver superb performances in these beautifully crafted adaptations of the work of E.W. Hornung, brother-in-law of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In each episode, the roguish Raffles and his intrepid companion set out to plunder the wealth of the aristocracy, stay out of the reach of the law, and revel in the thrill of the game.

This is a DVD rip. It isn't exactly blu-ray, but it is pretty good quality for being from the 70s. All 13 episodes + the unaired 1975 TV pilot are here.

Enjoy and please seed! :)
