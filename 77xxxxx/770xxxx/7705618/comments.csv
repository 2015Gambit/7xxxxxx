,MKACI,2012-10-08T20:55Z,Audio out of sync....why is this not a 350MB rip?
,DngnRdr,2012-10-09T02:43Z,"AFG does xvid/avi releases, often re-encode of the mp4 I think and since the only mp4 is the 720p I'm guessing this is a re-encode of that, with reduced resolution - which is probably what lead to the sync issues and large size. Not sure why there hasn't been a regular mp4 from 2HD or LOL who usually do them... could be the show was missed with all the others and they're waiting for a repeat."
