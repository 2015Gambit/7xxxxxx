,V8_Man,2012-10-14T19:05Z,I'm having the same problem with the audio :(
,AIVAS,2012-10-18T02:54Z,Audio is out by 10+ minutes (No REALLY!)
,F110,2012-10-25T20:14Z,"Audio is completely buggered. Out of sync after about 15 minutes. Do not bother downloading.
Go to Speed.CD and get the original."
,F110,2012-10-29T18:53Z,"Update to previous comment. The Speed.CD original is also faulty in the audio department. 
About ten minutes of audio missing from about the 16 minute mark, and therefore, no audio after 34 minutes, 34 seconds."
