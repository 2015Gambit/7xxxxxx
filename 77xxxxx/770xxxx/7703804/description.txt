The year is 1967 and Godzilla is on the move... to Vietnam! With a war underway, Godzilla is the last thing the country needs. Lieutenant Murakami follows Godzilla to try out some new tech on the monster, but a super-sized foe named Anguirus might just be the most effective counter-measure. It's a rumble in the jungle, don't miss it!
