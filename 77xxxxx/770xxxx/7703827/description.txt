About the Game

Assassin"s Creed is a historical action-adventure open world stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows. 
The bulk of the game takes place during the Third Crusade, with the plot revolving around a sect known as the Secret Order of Hashashin ( Assassins ). 
The player is in reality playing as a modern-day man named Desmond Miles, who through the use of a machine named the "Animus", 
is allowed the viewing and controlling of the protagonist"s genetic memories of his ancestors, in this case, Altaïr ibn-La"Ahad, a member of the Assassins.
Desmond Miles, a bartender, is kidnapped by the Abstergo Industries. 
There, Desmond is forced to interface with the Animus, a device that is able to replay the genetic memories of the user"s ancestors. 
In Desmond"s case, they seek information about his ancestor Altaïr ibn-La"Ahad, an Assassin during the time of the Third Crusade. 
Within the Animus, Altaïr"s memories reveal that he was attempting to stop Robert de Sablé from taking an artifact from a temple, but broke all three of the Assassins" Brotherhood"s tenets in the process. 
The Brotherhood leader, Al Mualim, demotes Altaïr to the rank of Novice, and assigns him the task of assassinating nine people, all of whom are Templars, to regain his former status.......
