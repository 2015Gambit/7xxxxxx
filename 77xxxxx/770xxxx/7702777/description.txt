Spade Cooley Big Band 1950-1952 (Harlequin) [FLAC] {MKOP}

Spade Cooley (1910-1969) was the true dark spirit of Western swing. Cooley, a notorious drunk, did prison time for stomping his wife to death. As a bandleader, he was nearly peerless in melding the Bob Wills invented sound to the big-band swing genre, and this single disc documenting Cooley's late era big band reflects the big, tough, horn driven sound of that group in its prime. It included steel guitarist Noel Boggs, fiddle player (who doubled on saxophone) Ron Dady, guitarist James O. "Jimmy" Wyble, and pianist John F. Freddie Haynes.There are 33 cuts here, all of them showcasing the brassy end of the band which swung hard out of the country and blues grooves and played everything from ''Perdido,'' to Bob Wills' ''Texas Playboy Rag'' to Hank Williams' ''Honky Tonkin'.'' The sound on this set is terrific and includes a full range of hard to find recordings from the Okeh era. Highly recommended. ~Thom Jurek (Allmusic)
