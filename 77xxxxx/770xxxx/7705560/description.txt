The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the Sunday, October 7 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about a federal bill mandating FEMA respond to "funeral homes, cemeteries, and mortuaries" being "overwhelmed" (see Paul Watson's FEMA To Mobilize For "Mass Fatality Planning"). He also covers the economic crisis now coming to a head as gasoline prices shoot through the ceiling in California and Obama's phony jobs report is debunked as a cynical election season hoax and talks about new developments in the Middle East as Turkey and Syria prepare for conflict after a false flag on the border between the two countries threatens to spark a wider and more ominous regional war.
