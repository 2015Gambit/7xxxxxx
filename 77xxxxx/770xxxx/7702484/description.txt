To commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the TitanicÆs sinking,
TITANIC: 100 YEARS IN 3D combines stunning 3D HD imagery of the wreck with powerful untold stories of passengers and crew,
letting audiences experience the real life drama of Titanic in a way never before possible. In 2010,
an unprecedented expedition by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and RMS Titanic, Inc. went on location to document the entire wreck site of Titanic,
using high-resolution optical video, sonar, acoustic imaging, and 3D HD video and acoustic modeling.

These incredible visuals will be accompanied by the untold stories of people who were on the ship, narrated in voice-over by actors.

Each personÆs story will be linked with one or more recovered artifacts that connect to that passenger or crewmember.

These haunting artifacts and unforgettable personal stories of average people take viewers back in time, making the history of Titanic as vivid as it was yesterday.
