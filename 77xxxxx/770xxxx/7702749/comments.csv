I suspect a repack will show up

it's nice to know that this torrent leads you to a fucked up episode. However, why keep this torrent alive if the end result is crap!"
[V],Masterzilla,2012-10-07T23:50Z,"there's a new source for this:
Yukon.Men.S01E07.Logjam.720p.HDTV.x264-DHD"
[V],psspss,2012-10-08T03:27Z,"its not alive.. just TPB delete and edit torrent functions have be disabled for some time

I will see if I can make a new source"
[V],psspss,2012-10-08T04:24Z,"proper version now up

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7705240/Yukon.Men.S01E07.Proper.HDTV.xvid-%5D%5B_Logjam_%5D%5B_06-Oct-2012_%5D_avi"
,jammerster,2012-10-12T01:41Z,"psspss, thanks for the torrent.

However can i ask why you re-encode scene releases to Xvid/DivX, do you not understand the concept of lossy compression? 

seriously dude, you are making an unwatchable mess of good HQ torrents out there.

oh it gets better 44KHZ audio from a 48KHZ source. fuck me it gets better. why not re-encode to WMV7, it will get better results!"
