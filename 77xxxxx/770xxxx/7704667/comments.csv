,MARYUS1010,2012-10-08T19:42Z,100% BluRay Rip?
,fabb0,2012-10-08T22:01Z,Probably the same. Audio is out of sync and the music sounds very distorted :(
,vidarsmith,2012-10-09T07:11Z,"Inte 100% BRrip, DTS ljudet saknas."
,heinek1,2012-10-13T23:35Z,"Bluray quality video, audio is AC3, not DTS. Still good audio though not in sync"
,heinek1,2012-10-13T23:51Z,"Not DTS audio, but AC3. Video is 10/10. Audio is 8910. AC3 640 kbps. So unless you have a really expensive surround setup, you will not notice the difference between AC3 and DTS. This is probably the best version out now. If you want something better buy the damn movie on bluray and stop bitchin. It`s out before christmas anyway"
,heinek1,2012-10-13T23:52Z,It was supposed to be audio 9/10
,heinek1,2012-10-13T23:58Z,"if you use media player classic, set audio sync to -300 and it`s perfect"

Varför ljuger du? Är du så kåt på internet-cred?"
