"Control" tells the remarkable story of Ian Curtis, lead singer of the influential band Joy Division and one of the most enigmatic figures in all of rock music.

Based on his wife's memoir, Control follows Curtis' humble Manchester origins and his rapid rise to fame, tormented battle with epilepsy, and struggles with love that led to his death at the age of 23. Starring Sam Riley in an acclaimed breakout performance and Samantha Morton as his teenage bride, Control is "a stunning look at the head-spinning, tragic world of a gifted musician" (Pete Hammond, Maxim)
