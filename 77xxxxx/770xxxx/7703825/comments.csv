,a7xran,2012-10-07T15:48Z,Does this work on any Flash carts?
,damican,2012-10-07T15:49Z,"Not to be picky, but could you please zip/rar it?

It'd cut the file size down signifigantly.  Or better yet just upload the patch itself?  I already have white 2, but I dunno where an AP patch it"
,_antongirdeux_,2012-10-07T15:49Z,i've tried this only on emulation...since I don't have a Nintendo DS. but i ithink it will..
,_antongirdeux_,2012-10-07T15:51Z,dude! this one is already patched
,_antongirdeux_,2012-10-07T15:57Z,"here's your compressed version! pls share and don't forget to seed!

,Dave2028,2012-10-07T16:35Z,Still doesn't work on most flashcarts though.
,galex609,2012-10-07T18:36Z,"Nope, nothin on flashcarts"
,samljer,2012-10-07T19:20Z,"@Galex609
Most flashcards....
It works on my DWTwo fine, and ill try my r card later
but ive read it works on the R4I Gold 3ds (>9 pcb)
wife also loaded it up on her AceKard 2i but says it ""freezes alot"" might be a fix comming for that too.  

to say ""nothin on flashcarts"" is flat out wrong.

but it doesnt work on most."
,samljer,2012-10-07T19:38Z,"Works on AceKard 2i running 1.4.4 DSi XL
and DSTWO on my 3DS 4.3.0"
,Dave2028,2012-10-07T20:06Z,"Yeah, it's definitely not working with the R4i-SDHC 3DS cart. Every time, I get the damn 'load rom errcode= -5' bullshit. Oh well, just gotta wait for R4i-SDHC to update the firmware."
,thecrazy_33,2012-10-07T20:45Z,meh.Not working no$gba..... blackscreen after pokemon white 2 show's up...
,_antongirdeux_,2012-10-07T21:03Z,@thecrazy_33 just use DesMUME emulator..it works on it! I just caught a Riolu! :D
,Sebanana,2012-10-24T17:51Z,"urh, can someone help me out? the game works fine on dstwo until the 5th gym, where you hafta go fight ur rival in the driftveil tournament. After beating my rival, the game just hanged. No matter what team combination i try, the game will keep on hanging, is there some way to fix this bug? thanks"
