London Burns. Choose your side.

Damien (Nick Nevern) is a London policeman, having joined
the force from a difficult upbringing. In his spare time
he is a borderline football hooligan and while on duty he
frequently disregards proper rules to either get a friendâ™s
charges lifted or put the boot in on a suspect who he
doesnâ™t like. As tensions in London build towards the riots
of summer 2011, Damien tries to keep his building rage under
control while trying to establish a relationship with Louise
(Kellie Shirley) a new police officer he has been partnered with.
