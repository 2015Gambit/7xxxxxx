,NekodaLolita,2012-10-10T05:50Z,What on earth is wrong with the other two Bones torrents you made/have up.
,aeristilheartly,2012-10-12T17:02Z,"I think the short answer really is, those other two AREN'T his, they're faked as they're .rar files and look at their seeders and leeches, almost identical astronomical numbers.  They just stole the name to try and get others to download it."
,aeristilheartly,2012-10-12T17:03Z,"This one is though, and great job, 10/10 :)"
