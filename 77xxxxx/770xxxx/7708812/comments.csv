,skoumoun,2012-10-09T10:58Z,"Thanks a lot, I was waiting for this proper version !"
,t7t76t,2012-10-09T14:17Z,I paid the 5 bucks for this like some others but the official version online stream was a little impractical to watch so I'll hit this thanks. 
,riceknight,2012-10-09T20:55Z,Jerky framerate and sync... seems to yet another streamed version..... why are there no good quality releases of this?
,Revrant,2012-10-09T22:29Z,"Nope, this is from the site, that's just how it is dude, it was a stream and they recorded high definition versions of a stream."
,LackThereof,2012-10-10T19:09Z,Thanks for the upload
,skoumoun,2012-10-10T22:03Z,"There's actually a 1080p version with constant 30fps available on some other torrent site.

Compression is still far from flawless though.

So wait for this or maybe also a proper 30fps 720p.

details : Runtime	1:33:00
Bitrate	4638 kbps

,Revrant,2012-10-13T08:21Z,"This is constant 30 FPS, it doesn't matter, it's a stream, the new version they released at 1080p still has stuttering.

Streams are crappy no matter their resolution."
