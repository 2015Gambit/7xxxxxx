,mykehdoom,2012-10-07T10:49Z,"For those of you wondering how to get this to work on carts, and emulators, I suggest you go here. http://gbatemp.net/topic/267243-retrogamefan-updatesreleases/

He updated all cart firmware today to run White 2, and you can download DS-Scene Rom Tool, run it, update it, then open the Pokemon White 2 rom, then click the AP tab, make sure the patch is checked, then click export. It'll patch the game for you.

Been playing the game since midnightish. It's amazing."

,mykehdoom,2012-10-07T21:53Z,"Apparently no one reads all the comments. x_x I posted how to make the EXP and everything work, and how to patch it to work on all Carts."
,Dave2028,2012-10-08T00:03Z,"@mykehdoom: It still doesn't make it work for all carts. It's still not working for my R4i-SDHC 3DS cart. I did everything that was necessary, and it still does not even come close to loading the rom."
,sussumu,2012-10-08T03:20Z,"@mykehdoom : Where is the link to download the ""Ap patch"" that you talked about?"
,sussumu,2012-10-08T03:22Z,@mykehdoom : Where is the patch that you mentioned?
,mykehdoom,2012-10-08T09:01Z,"You open the rom in DS Rom Tool, then look under the AP tab. It should have a green check mark. Then click the export button, make sure the apply ap patch box is checked."
,Lyricant,2012-10-08T13:51Z,"This worked perfectly for me on Acekard 2i with AKAIO 1.8.5. Bypass AP enabled.

For people with EXP issue:
1. Download this.
2. Download DS Scene Rom Tool. http://filetrip.net/nds-downloads/rom-hacks/download-retrogamefan-ds-scene-rom-tool-v10-build-1205-f25536.html
3. Update DS Scene Rom Tool if / when prompted.
4. Open this rom (Open File) with DS Scene Rom Tool.
5. Check that AP Patch tab has the patch information. If not, restart DS Scene Rom tool and check again.
6. Export the Rom with ""Apply AP Patch"" selected."
,umbralah,2012-10-12T23:03Z,"I can't get working on my Acekard 2i. Already tried every Akaio and ap patches. It just don't pass the Akaio's Loading screen, when the Loading turns yellow. Can somebody help me? I'll be very thankful >."
,FluxZone,2012-10-13T10:25Z,"Guys...

Get YSMenu and install it to your carts. This basically gets Black and White 1 and 2 working on pretty much any cart, even if it's a clone"
,kainwolfe,2012-10-14T15:01Z,"Tried it with Supercard DSTwo, using latest firmware. Able to start, so far only one issue, see below.

Note of caution: Do not access your start menu Pokemon summary screens. This will cause the game to black-out and freeze. Only use the PC to view your Pokemon's summary screen."
