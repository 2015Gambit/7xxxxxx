Introduction to Flashtool
Flashtool is a flashing software that can be used to :

    Flash original Images (Android 1.6, 2.1, 2.3 Images)
    Root your phone
    Install Recovery, Busybox, custom kernels
    Clean your Rom (remove /system/apps apps of your choice) (Be careful, unless you really know what you do, do not modify the default list. This can make your phone stuck at the SE Logo)
    Clear dalvik cache
