1986 CD reissue of the 1957 LP (monaural) release.  A later reissue includes (2)


alternate takes.  This album was recorded just after TIJUANA MOODS which wasn't

 
released until 1962 for some mysterious reason.
 

Yet another great gig for Bill Evans who had not yet achieved fame.


If you're new to Mingus, this is a good place to start.



FLAC doesn't improve source material...it simply does less damage to it.
