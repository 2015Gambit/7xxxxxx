notes:
First show of 75 tour. Bob talks a lot between the songs.
One of the most memorable lines has to be "So I shot the sheriff.
Now I wasn't no fast draw or anything. But I could shoot straight."
Ziggy comes out on Natty Dread and they sing a bit of it together.
Also some unknown vocalist on Get Up Stand Up
