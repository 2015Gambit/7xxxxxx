,theo23rd,2012-10-07T19:19Z,Why -3? Is this one laggy like the others?
,Zatticus,2012-10-07T19:20Z,"better not be fake, cost me 4.95$  :P  

as for quality, I was a little disappointed with what the site called ""HIGH QUALITY"" , but this is still fine for computer or small t.v. viewing, if you have a big screen, I'd recommend going with the 1.4Gig version."
,Zatticus,2012-10-07T19:21Z,"as for lag, thats how it downloaded.... so I don't know if there is a cleaner version..."
,theo23rd,2012-10-07T20:24Z,"Thanks for the info. I dl'd the 1.4 gig version and found it unwatchable on my big screen, BTW."
