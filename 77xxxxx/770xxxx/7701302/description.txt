Here's the Elseworlds Giant #1 (recently re-released as DC Comics Presents: Elseworlds 100-page Spectacular) that was almost immediately pulled from circulation and all copies destroyed by DC in 1999.  Scandalous and infamous for a stupid frame with Superman baby crawling into a microwave.

Anyway, here it is with the the sons of Batman and Superman, cause, you know, Supes is all into truth, justice, the American way, and lots and lots of unsafe sex - - so, ya wanna show that off, just don't show a frame of a baby crawlin' into a microwave...
