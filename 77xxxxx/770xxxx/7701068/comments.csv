,133712ap3,2012-10-08T02:31Z,"Absolutely horrible quality

Video is 25 frames per second, instead of 24 or 23.976 and is an upscaled 720P

Also, the video's language is all in Russian (the source of the rip)

Audio is an upconverted stereo mix and the audio is borked. It sounds flat and has delays in the rear speakers.

This is worse than the YIFFY shit"

i.e
audio: ""you'd better duck -oh shit""
subs: ""fere and your head -damn it""
Just horrible..."
