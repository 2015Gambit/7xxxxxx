[T],nosTEAM,2012-10-08T17:28Z,@ stubbytoquinho  - if you have windows 7 try running in compatibility with XP SP3
,stubbytoquinho,2012-10-08T21:03Z,"@nosTEAM That didnt fix it, however i managed to fix it by setting Replay0.bin as a read-only file in Appdata. But that only got me past the loading screen, now it bugs out on profile creation, any tips on that?"
[T],nosTEAM,2012-10-08T22:02Z,@ stubbytoquinho  - my advice ?? stop using Windows Vista and upgrade to windows 7 and if you PC meet requirements to play this game will be working for sure on Windows 7

,algebra2,2012-10-20T11:06Z,"game works fine and very smoothly, this is excellent! thank you very much nosTEAM i will definitely be obtaining more of your torrents! one thing though; when i first began playing the graphics looked like pure crap (and i knew it wasnt my video card because i have games that require higher graphics to play that look marvelous), but then i started to investigate and [if you are also having the same problem] what you do is go to where you installed fifa 13 (the folder/place/etc.), click on ""FIFA 13"", then click on ""Game"", then ""fifasetup"", then find an application called ""fifaconfig"" (without the quotes of course), click on it. now another window will appear where you will click ""Game Settings"". another window will then also pop up where you will make the resolution the highest listed (in my case it was 1600x900, before when graphics were crappy it was on 800x600). also ake sure the frame rate is unlimited or on ""no limit fps"" (same thing). one last thing i did which im not really sure did anything was put the rendering quality on high... not sure if it affects graphics but yeah that pretty sums it all up thank you once again nosTEAM.
oh and please seed! :)"
