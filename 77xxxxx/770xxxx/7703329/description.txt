INEFFECTUAL, invisible, unable to honour pledges and now blamed for letting Gaddafi off the hook. Why ObamaΓÇÖs gone from ΓÇÿYes we canΓÇÖ to ΓÇÿEr, maybe we shouldnΓÇÖtΓÇÖ...
Let us cast our minds back to those remarkable days in November 2008 when the son of a Kenyan goatherd was elected to the White House. It was a bright new dawn ΓÇô even brighter than the coming of the Kennedys and their new Camelot. JFK may be considered as being from an ethnic and religious minority ΓÇô Irish and Catholic ΓÇô but he was still very rich and very white. Barack Obama, by contrast, was a true breakthrough president. The world would change because obviously America had changed.

ObamaΓÇÖs campaign slogan was mesmerisingly simple and brimming with self-belief: ΓÇ£Yes we can.ΓÇ¥ His presidency, however, is turning out to be more about ΓÇ£no we wonΓÇÖt.ΓÇ¥ Even more worryingly, it seems to be very much about: ΓÇ£Maybe we canΓÇª do what, exactly?ΓÇ£ The world feels like a dangerous place when leaders are seen to lack certitude but the only thing President Obama seems decisive about is his indecision. What should the US do about Libya? What should the US do about the Middle East in general? What about the countryΓÇÖs crippling debts? What is the US going to do about Syria , Afghanistan, about Iran?
