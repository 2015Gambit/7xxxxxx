,magunda,2012-10-06T14:25Z,did anybody watched  this film?
,i.heart.me,2012-10-06T16:25Z,"yes i have, its possibly the funniest thing ive ever seen, but im english and chris morris has a particuarly unique take on humour. so not sure if it works for non-british types."
,che3to,2012-10-06T18:46Z,"I watched a bit (but I downloaded it from another torrent). I particularly did not get it. I was like is this supposed to be funny? I stop watching it after 20 minutes. 

""i.heart.me"" might have a good point there."

Thanks YIFY."
,i.heart.me,2012-10-07T10:25Z,"ghostnet, obviously thats your opinion and youre entitled to it, but this is comic genius at least for an english man, plus its by an englishman (very well respected comedian) about stupidity and a satirical look at how we deal with terrorism in the UK.  For the record, the concept of the film was actually based on real life accounts of terrorism gone wrong, the main one being three terrorists tried to blow up the millenium dome in cardiff on millenium eve, they spent months planning it and loaded up a inflatable raft to sail up to the dome, and got the weights of the explosives wrong and the raft sank, they apparently spent months planning it, and the police had no clue till it washed up.  The character of barry (the white guy) is based on a ""far right"" guy who used to beat/bully muslims in his local area, and one day decided to read the koran to use against his victims, and he ended up ""accidently"" converting himself. the list goes on. But it probably helps if youre english"

,bhailog,2012-10-29T15:35Z,"Being a Muslim, I must say, one of the most funniest movies, humour has no religion and can exist in anything. "
