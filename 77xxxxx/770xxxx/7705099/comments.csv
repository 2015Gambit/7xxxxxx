Why anyone would be such an ungrateful arse is beyond me, but whatever!

Thanks sceneline!"

It only shows how little you know about torrent technology. The whole point to it, si that you do not have to rar things anymore. Program itself downloads in small chunks, so when you rar something for a torrent all you do is make someone else wait for it to unrar and watch the progress bar. Learn more before passing judgement."

you are right it takes 1/2 hours to unrar  a file :) 
wake up it's morning it take 1 minute to unrar a file and you can watch without unrar the file with VLC player "
,Gaarades,2012-10-08T22:02Z,"While I'd rather have the whole file instead of RAR'ed, this is hardly something to whine about.

This stuff is brought to you for free and you're whining because it's not super ideal. Geez."

If rar files bother you so much, then there are other files you can download. You & phat_71 should get together & bitch about all the petty things that annoy you, that you could avoid, if you both weren't a pair of arseholes!"
[T],BTGuy,2012-10-09T21:15Z,"Thank you sceneline for this great upload :)

I appreciate your many great uploads :)

It only takes 10 seconds to unrar this file so stop complaining people and enjoy this great free entertainment."
,will8689,2012-10-10T09:57Z,Great quality in only 165mb. Awsome!!!!

It's not whining and it's also not ""being ungrateful"", it's just pointing out a stupid move.

It's also not only about unconvenience. It's about raring torrents being completely pointless, even harmful in fact, because it is diminishing the number of seeders, since no one's going to store the same file twice, only to be able to seed.

Therefore it is fucking stupid."

and that's exactly what I'm gonna do"

or someone's deleting my comments"
,honkeyman,2012-11-09T02:15Z,"I can see both sides of this silly RAR convo...
...sceneline you rock for doing what you do, and personally I don't care about splitting the file.  The only thing that throws me off about split files is fakes and/or virus, but since it's your upload everybody that has a problem should stfu if they're whining."
