,freedomczar,2012-10-06T00:21Z,"Hi Guys. I see everyone is excited that Obama got his clock cleaned in the debates. Well, the guy was charged with an impossible task, that is, to defend the indefensible. It is impossible to defend liberalism in the face of reality. Romney had the easy task of repeating facts, and there is no liberal theorem in the world that can deny them. The fact is that Obama's liberalism is not working, just like it has never worked before under different presidents. But our work does not end with the defeat of Obama (of which I am certain.) Our work begins with Romney's victory, because in him I see just another liberal Republican like Bush was. Yes, I will vote for Romney, but let us not fool ourselves. This guy wants to be loved by the media and the democrats. He is not the Marxist that Obama is, but he will implement half of Obama's policies just to appear bipartisan. And that is how our country is going down, one little step at a time."

 Thanks again! And enjoy the weekend!"

Recall the 'anybody but Romney' GOP primaries.  

Know why folks like you will always be full of shit? Because you declare your guy or side is the only ones telling the 'truth'.

Be real dude"
