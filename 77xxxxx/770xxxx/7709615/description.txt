Rodriguez on 60 Minutes +  Overtime - XviD
This is only the Rodriguez segments.
Oct 7 - 2012
I also included his appearance from Aug on the Late Show with David Letterman

From the website:
The singer songwriter named Rodriguez came from nowhere. In the late 60s, he cut a couple of records. They got great reviews but went nowhere. What he didnt know, what no one in America knew, was that half way around the world in South Africa, he was more popular than Elvis or the Beatles. He had never been there. No one there knew anything about him. Even when word spread that he had died, his records continued to sell.

Then, four years ago, a young Swedish filmmaker heard about Rodriguez -- decided to shoot a documentary about him.

Notes:
There were three Overtime clips on the website
They weren't very good quality to begin with

Just don't expect the overtime to be a high quality video.
