Tales of the Abyss will follow the story of the young aristocrat, Luke fon Fabre. Kidnapped seven years ago, Luke returns to his family with no memories of his life before. Suddenly, Luke is thrust into the outside world and caught in the workings of the Order of Lorelei and the Oracle Knights who serve as keepers of the prophecy known as the Score. He must learn of the power of friendship and feel the pain of sacrifice. Luke's actions could save the world or destroy it.
