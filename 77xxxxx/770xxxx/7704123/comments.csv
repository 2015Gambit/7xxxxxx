,sprin,2012-11-16T13:16Z,"what software did you use to burn the ISO?
 I am using PowerISO and I am having a hard time because PowerISO only display folder ""video_ts"" and ""audio_ts"", but when I mount the ISO it shows PS2 files.
Thanks for the upload.
sorry for my bad english I'm not good at it."
