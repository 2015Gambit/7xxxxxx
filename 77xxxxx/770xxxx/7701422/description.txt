Beatles '65 is The Beatles' fifth Capitol release, but seventh American album. It was released in mono and stereo versions. The album was also issued in Germany on the Odeon label.

On 16 November 2004, this album was released on Compact Disc for the first time as part of The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 box set (catalogue number CDP 7243 8 66874 2 5).

Beatles '65 includes eight of the fourteen songs from Beatles for Sale (omitting "Eight Days a Week", "Words of Love", "Every Little Thing", "I Don't Want to Spoil the Party", "What You're Doing", and the "Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey" medley, all of which were issued on Beatles VI). It also includes "I'll Be Back" from A Hard Day's Night and the single "I Feel Fine"/"She's a Woman". These latter two songs were remixed into "duophonic" [fake] stereo and drenched in reverb by Capitol Records' executive Dave Dexter, Jr to cover up the use of the mono mixes sent from England. 

The stereo mix of "Mr. Moonlight" has a longer fadeout than the mono version.
