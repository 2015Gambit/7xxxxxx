The Sheepdogs are a Canadian rock band from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, consisting of Ewan Currie on vocals and guitar, Leot Hanson on guitar, Ryan Gullen on bass and Sam Corbett on drums.

The Sheepdogs released several recordings independently prior to entering Rolling Stone's "Choose The Cover" competition. They beat 15 other bands to win the contest and were featured on the August 18, 2011 cover of Rolling Stone magazine, the first unsigned act to do so. During the competition, the band made appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and performed at the Bonnaroo Music Festival as well The Osheaga Festival in Montreal, Quebec. The band has recently signed with Atlantic Records with a new album being produced by The Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney.[2]

The band's Five Easy Pieces EP debuted at No. 7 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 3,300 copies.[3] On September 22, 2011, the band won the three CASBY Awards they were nominated for. They won Favourite New Artist, Favourite Indie Album, and Favourite New Album.[4] The Sheepdogs won Rock Album of the Year at the 2011 Western Canadian Music Awards.
