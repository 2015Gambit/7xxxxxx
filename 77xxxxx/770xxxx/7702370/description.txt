In this edition of On the Edge, Max interviews Wolf Richter from testosteronepit.com. He talks about the new consumer strategies by big companies to impoverish consumers. Wolf Richter has over twenty years of C-level operations and finance experience, including turnaround situations and startups. He went to school and worked for two decades in Texas and Oklahoma, with an interlude in France, and then headed east to New York City, Brussels, Tokyo, and finally San Francisco, where he currently lives.
