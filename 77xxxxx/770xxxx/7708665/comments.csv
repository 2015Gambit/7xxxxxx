,bambootb,2012-10-09T15:21Z,No one is seeding can't download 
,MadMango,2012-10-14T12:59Z,Dude is this torrent dead too? No seeders at all! Any help?
,getswordfish,2012-10-15T16:09Z,@ Hambosas: When can we look forward to your next upload? And why have there been so little seeders?
,Hambosas,2012-10-15T17:28Z,@getswordfish I plan on uploading Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Magic Mike very soon.
,Hambosas,2012-10-15T17:30Z,@getswordfish And with the seeders... I have no idea. The only torrent I'm still seeding is The Avengers but people still say they can't download it :/ but like I said I will seed every torrent I upload for now on.
,Hambosas,2012-10-17T05:54Z,"@MadMango I'm probably going to forget about Prometheus because it is giving me so much trouble however I found something that might work...
