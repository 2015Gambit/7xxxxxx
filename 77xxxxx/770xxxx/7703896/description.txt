[i]Where The Hell Are We And What Day Is It... This Is Static-X[/i] is a rockumentary DVD that was set to be released in 2001 by industrial metal band Static-X. It features behind-the-scenes and live footage, along with all of Static-X's music videos (at the time) and an audio-only concert. Due to the live footage being recorded at Ozzfest, Sharon Osbourne threatened to sue the band if the DVD was released; therefore, it was prevented from ever hitting store shelves. Given this, it is very hard to find and roughly only 500 copies are in existence.
