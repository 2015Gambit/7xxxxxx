,skoumoun,2012-10-08T22:27Z,"The Rumble website has a new 1.77Gb video with 30fps, so don't bother on this version, the 1.49Gb version has only 13fps because of technical problems."
,Zaskava,2012-10-08T23:22Z,@skoumoun Thank you! I will upload the other one in a bit.
,Zaskava,2012-10-09T06:56Z,Here is the better one: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7709257
,enonumus,2012-10-09T20:46Z,The better one that Zaskava linked to also has the a choppy frame rate.  It's just been re-encoded to 29.97fps which just makes the file size larger.  The quality of that version is good aside from the frame rate issue.
,Zaskava,2012-10-19T20:46Z,1080 version: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7719314/The_Rumble_2012_-_1080p
