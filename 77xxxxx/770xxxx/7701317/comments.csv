,Blarg2012,2012-10-08T21:38Z,"RayCort, thank you so much for the entire season!! I truly truly appreciate it. My family and I just love it!!!!!!

We did have issues with the first 5 episodes though, no matter where we play it at, we only get sound or nothing at all. I was wondering if you could please re-upload the AVIs?

Thank you again!!!!"
,upx3,2012-10-28T18:21Z,"FYI: Maybe it's just me (VLC, KMP, WDTV, Philips 5982), but episodes 65 - 80's aspect ratios are not correct -- it's letterboxed, but maybe should not be. 
However, it's fixable (simple verticle stretching with VLC or KMP; or transcoding with a video converter), and everything else seems okay.
Better to have a fixable show, than no show at all. Thanks! "
