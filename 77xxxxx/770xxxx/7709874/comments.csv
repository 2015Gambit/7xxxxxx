,.Leto.,2012-10-11T01:43Z,"I posted a comment here a few minutes ago but now I can't see it? Not the first time this bug would happen on TPB. Anyway, I was saying that a DC with dts sound was available, that's a big mistake from me, it's Exp1 not 2. Sorry about this. The CHD audio is still very bad though."
