,seed-or-die,2012-10-09T00:25Z,I can't believe that 10 seeders equal (stuck at 63.3%) I have at least 20 trackers and my peers and I are all stuck. Thanks anyway dude.
,appletangy,2012-10-09T00:32Z,LOL. I too have been stuck at 63.% since mid day.
,appletangy,2012-10-09T00:37Z,It would be cool if one or two of those who completed the download could re-up. It might help for more to grab it and repeat the process. 
,appletangy,2012-10-09T00:38Z,Are my comments being deleted? 
,funkypanda,2012-10-09T01:09Z,I think this is a fake. Mine has also been stuck all day at 63.7%
,madgina2,2012-10-09T01:11Z,63.7% - May need to be uploaded again by RayCort... 
,madgina2,2012-10-09T01:13Z,63.7% - May need to be uploaded again by RayCort..
,seed-or-die,2012-10-09T01:17Z,"I understand the power of sharing. RayCort has had over 1000 leeches and only a few seeders (shameful), when you DL something please leave your torrent client open with the file you recently DL'd so that the poster of the file doesn't have to go back and seed 1 out of 50 torrents he/she uploaded."
,txrabbit,2012-10-09T01:22Z,Tried this at KAT and now here and  it's still stuck at 63.9% and crawling.  Has anyone gotten a complete download of this yet?
,seed-or-die,2012-10-09T02:21Z,Hmmm...Funkypanda you may be right.
,appletangy,2012-10-09T02:24Z,"I don't think it's fake. It's stuck at 63% (now 65%) because it's at a bottleneck point, including the other trackers they are all piggy backing on each other. I think someone who was able to complete should at least re-up it and so on. Let's get this thing moving. Thanks to the uploader, btw. "
,appletangy,2012-10-09T02:32Z,There was 10 seeders and now there is just 8. Two selfish people got theirs and left.
,seed-or-die,2012-10-09T02:56Z,"Yeah we just need RayCort to re-seed when he comes across this torrent and hope more people will keep it alive, I don't think it's fake because I have a torrent stuck at 86.6% for 2 weeks, it's all about seeding. I don't remember having these issues with BTjunkie. I normally leave my client open for at least a few days after Dl, this is very selfish for a torrent not even 24hrs old to have no seeders but 1000 leeches."
,seed-or-die,2012-10-09T02:58Z,I'm at 67.2%.
,seed-or-die,2012-10-09T03:05Z,67.7%
[T],RayCort,2012-10-09T03:19Z,"I re uploaded Steel Magnolias. I renamed it to read ""Lifetime-Steel Magnolias - ReSeed [2012] "". My last upload on Pirate Bay because of Sorry Leechers that don't hit and run."
,kcoco,2012-10-09T03:20Z,I'm seeding........ Currently at 68.5.
,freeegatee,2012-10-09T11:51Z,"Thanks for this one. I am presently seeding and will continue. However, it is very sad to see such selfish display. "
,DameGiggsy,2012-10-09T20:38Z,"Once I get it downloaded, I won't be a selfish jerk and will seed as usual. Thanks for the UL."
,DameGiggsy,2012-10-09T20:41Z,"Wow! 2 MB/s! Excellent UL, already have it downloaded. Seeding now, thanks so much!"
,DeeChanell,2012-10-12T00:09Z,can you upload Abducted: The Carlina White story?
,Momoko6,2012-10-20T04:39Z,I second the request for the Carlina White story! :D
