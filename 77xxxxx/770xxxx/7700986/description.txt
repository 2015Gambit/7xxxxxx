Recognising symptoms of illness at an early stage is often vital to achieving a cure. But how do you know when something is trivial or really serious? Here at last is a book that can help you decide if and when you should consult a doctor. In this invaluable family health guide, popular doctor Hilary Jones, with the help of charts and illustrations, enables you to diagnose your symptoms and gives practical advice on the sorts of treatment you may need to seek.

He answers questions such as:
* How long should a headache last before it becomes abnormal?
* What is the difference between a twinge of chest pain and a heart attack?
* How can you tell if a child's rash indicates measles?

If you have ever worried about your own or you family's health, this comprehensive and reassuring book, with its clear and commonsense approach, will make you feel a great deal better.
