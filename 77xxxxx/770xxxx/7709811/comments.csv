'Nuff said."
,tflagger997,2012-10-09T17:26Z,"The answer is no, not for sure.  The 16 people that gave it a +1 are confused.  It is supposed to get a +1 once you have actually seen the quality.  Same goes for everything else on TPB.  

It is great to see the quality rating being used, but if it is not used properly, it is meaningless.

Once the crack is released, then we will know if this torrent's version works or not.  It is a Skidrow release, so expectations are high."

This is Unlocked steam version. Preload is not unlocked.

As normally steam version comes pre-installed and you don't have to install it, just copy the crack inside the game directly and play.

Have a look to the files inside the rar files.

Sorry about rar files, but unraring them was making total size huge.


Stay tuned will be releasing crack as soon as it's out.

,tflagger997,2012-10-09T23:27Z,"First, it was taken directly from their site so I knew just from the label of the torrent.  There are also files in the torrent that tell us it is a Skidrow event.  The only reason we cannot say the crack will come for sure (100%) is that they have put up games in the past and told us to wait for the crack, and it never came.

,tflagger997,2012-10-10T02:23Z,"Well, I would not have said it exactly that way, but it does primarily release and host Skidrow material.  Besides, how long do you think Skidrow would let them exist if they had stolen the name?

Funny thing is it looks like they are about to post a Fairlight cracked version of the game.  It is hard to tell if the crack is stand-alone or baked into ISOs at this point.  If it is the latter, then we will have to wait for the crack only version to be posted, unless you want to DL 13GB again.  If you do, be a good shipmate and post the crack for those of us still DLing this after 12+ straight hours with crappy connections?  Thanks!

DLC = Down-Loadable Content and you had to download the Elite Solider Pack from Steam (I believe - but am not 100% on that).  I personally hate the term DLC since patches also qualify for it."
,corinthus,2012-10-10T02:23Z,"moldor, there is no Skidrow website. If you're using that fake site then congrats on all the malware you picked up.

Perhaps you should try it in Sandbox mode before making claims like that.  I have never had any malware, trojans, or virii from the files posted on their site.  

Since this torrent is an exact duplicate of the what is posted there, I guess you are also saying this is full of malware?  If so, what kind of malware is this infected with?  Just so we can get some confirmation on that from people that have successfully downloaded it.  It will be another 36 hours for me apparently.

To reiterate, the SkidrowGames site is maintained by people who have no affiliation with Skidrow."
,tflagger997,2012-10-10T06:29Z,"It really does not matter if they work for them, the fact is they are given direct access to the Skidrow material before anyone else.  So regardless of whether Skidrow is running the site, or just letting them to distribute their material, it amounts to the same thing.  They are just as good as getting it direct from Skidrow.

Case in point - if you are commenting on this torrent, you are probably downloading it.  If so, that means that you are getting files that are unmodified copies directly taken from one of these sites and posted here (just like the majority of all games).

So what was that about Torrents and 'tards again?"

There is no Skidrow website. Saying there is because the stuff they release is available on a site is like saying you can fly because you can jump. While it may technically be true, you would be pretty fucked if dropped from orbit.

Likewise the ""Skidrow"" site(s) *MAY* be safe for now. But they may not. And you will be the first to learn the definition of ""Fucked"" when they are inevitably corrupted or taken over by a governmental agency to spread malware.

Shut up about ""Skidrow"" sites. There is zero benefit to even mentioning them. You can verify a release is official by using a site like Releaselog or OrlyDB.

No, you are wrong.
The game requires directX 9c
The only reason why it won't work on XP is the laziness od the developers (or they have been paid by microsoft to not support XP). WinXP needs some more functions to call in a .dll library file. 
To run the game on windows XP, google up zernel32 . It is a customized version of kernel32, no it doesn't do anything with the standart windows core one, it is only a customized version to be added into the game, that runs only during the game. No, it is not a virus. On the official forums, it was deleted in like a day. 

The only main problem is, that the girl who made it made sure it works only with the original executable, so it doesn't work with a pirated one. :/
You need to add the file into the game folder and then hex edit the game executable to direct it for your modified kernel (zernel). The library basically has the function calls normal kernel doesn't have, and then it links to the standart windows kernel32 for the ones XP has. Also, you have to run the game first on XP before modifying (even through it crashes, it creates several files)

DO NOT DOWNGRADE TO WINDOWS 7 !
Windows 7 is a simplified commercial shit for children playing COD all the day. And old people, and retards. "

Windows 7 is far better than Windows XP in every way. You'd only be downgrading if you got Windows 8 or Windows Vista.

The game is also DX10. That .DLL that allows you to play on XP is just forcing the game to run in DX9, which also eliminates a lot of graphical features from the game. It is also not very stable."

No way you can launch an app DESIGNED for dx10 with dx9 unless it was actually designed for winXP and dx9. You cannot force it. Just not possible. Changes that requires a windows7 actually small and insignificant. They only changed executable and steam libraries, and probably a dx10 related stuff as wall.
It works perfectly on winXP, just google a bit more for proper files.   "
,NecroFile,2012-10-25T10:55Z,"@Voiddweller

Halo: Combat Evolved for Windows Vista has the exact same cracked/hacked/customized .DLL to make it work in Windows XP with DX9, also. 

That game in particular was designed specifically to showcase DirectX 10 and make the game exclusive to Windows Vista.

It is indeed possible. It just removes many visual features from the game, just as the patch to get XEU to work on XP does."
,Voiddweller,2012-10-26T02:22Z,"@NecroFile
Captain Obvious
Any other game that supports both DX9 and DX10 actually ""removes"" DX10 features if you run it with DX9. XEU works perfectly under XP, so devs simply changed executable to work with Vista/7 only. No need to ""force"" anything. There is no other changes except that. And cannot be, because engine itself is old.

P.S. It is a worst X-COM clone i ever seen... Yeah, it looks good, but lacks traditional elements, flexibility, too scripted and linear.
