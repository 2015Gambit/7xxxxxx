The Big Melt~2012 09 28   BBC Our World 

Scientists say the Arctic ice is melting at an unprecedented speed and they fear it could have a dramatic effect on the weather in Europe. David Shukman reports from a Norwegian research station deep inside the Arctic Circle and witnesses the impact of a record-breaking summer thaw.

Ongoing changes in the climate of the Arctic include rising temperatures, loss of sea ice, and melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The Arctic ocean will likely be free of summer sea ice before the year 2100

Projections as to when precisely this will occur vary greatly. Because of the amplified response of the Arctic to global warming, it is often seen as a high-sensitivity indicator of climate change.
