,xXNeoREXx,2012-11-08T19:20Z,"This does work, but the main .exe is infected (probably injected) with a virus.
The licence keys work and I managed to get the program installed and working before my AV deleted the .exe cracker.

I wonder if the licences will work on a regular installation of the program.

This licence worked for me:
ChattChitto
VDRVJ-XKAKP-MMNW1-X2SV3-PAUUL
and remember to block the program in your Firewall."
,moistrous,2012-11-10T00:24Z,"@xXNeoREXx: I just tried your credentials and they worked!!! I was running the legit trial version and needed to burn a CD beyond the limitations, so I came on here and saw this torrent... then i read your comment.
Apparently it doesn't even check the internet, it just uses an algorithm that combines the username and key. (I didn't notice you posted your username at first so it didn't work at first)

Anyways thanks :)

So I'm proof that all you need is a trojan-free keygen for this software. No cracks needed."
,chaiyont2,2012-11-18T08:09Z,"Gee, nice music for a change! Thank you so much!"
,rabid_parrots,2012-11-22T17:00Z,"Motherfucking software has a motherfucking AVG crapware installer enabled by default.

USE ""CUSTOM"" METHOD OF INSTALLATION, NOT EXPRESS.

ChatChitto, did you know about this? I almost installed spyware on my computer. I really hope this was not intentional on your part."
