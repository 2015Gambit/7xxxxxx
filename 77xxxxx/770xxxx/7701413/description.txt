Hi Guys,

i have reconverted a bad qual rmvb file that was proving to be unwatchable on both windows and mac, so i have scrubbed the video and hardcoded the subs and have tested the video on a 42" plasma and was quite impressed with the quality considering the original file (video was blown up to maximum before it became lossy). i did not create the original movie so props to the uploader but it was unwatchable. now the video and audio are decent for the time of the movie being made. anyhoo
enjoy
