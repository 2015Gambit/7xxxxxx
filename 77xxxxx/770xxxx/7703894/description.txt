* Plot :
 
In 2044, the United States has suffered economic collapse, causing severe social decay and growth in organized crime. In addition, a mutation has occurred in ten percent of the population giving them telekinetic powersΓÇöthe ability to levitate small objects. Thirty years further into the future in 2074, time travel is invented, but is immediately outlawed. Tracking technology has rendered it nearly impossible to dispose of bodies secretly, so crime bosses use illicit time travel to send those they want killed to the past where they are killed by "loopers": assassins paid with silver bars strapped to the victim. When crime bosses want to end a looper's contract, they send his future self back to be killed by his younger self, referred to as "closing the loop". Failing a contract is a death sentence.
 
In 2044, Joe Simmons works for a mafia company in Kansas as a looper. His boss Abe was sent from the future to manage the loopers and also owns a club that Joe frequents, and where he spends time with Suzie, a showgirl. Abe controls his own group of hired muscle, the "Gat Men", including the unstable Kid Blue, who is desperate to prove himself to Abe. One night, Joe's friend Seth visits him and tells him that he was supposed to close his own loop, but hesitated. Before Seth's future self escaped, he mentioned the Rainmaker, a mastermind who has taken over future organized crime and is closing all loops. Joe attempts to protect Seth, but later chooses to betray him to Abe instead of surrendering half of his silver savings.
