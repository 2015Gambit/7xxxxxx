,mdx2035,2012-10-08T11:12Z,"@a.katikar:- thanks very much for the information!

and one more is, hope no video (or except the languages part, nothing) has been ripped! sorry for being quite childish here! :-)"
[V],azaq318,2012-10-08T11:24Z,"mdx2035
katikar is right - it's only RUS and ENG languages, including RUS and ENG comments.

Nothing else was ripped. Video 100%, Audio 100 %."

,dammR,2012-10-09T20:33Z,"Hello every one

 I have a request to all you all.

 I have downloaded Fifa 2013 from a different torrent but the problem is that on executing the ""setup.exe"" file it prompts me for a activation key after asking for accepting terms and condition and installation directory.
 Or else it gives me an option to redirect to a web page which asks to complete a survey in return for the activation key(which never works).
 Now my point is that I have downloaded all the data.*** packs of the game and the only requirement is for a proper ""setup.exe"" like available in this torrent which could simply skip the activation key part during installation.

 SO MY REQUEST TO YOU IS PLEASE UPLOAD THE ""Setup.exe"" file of this torrent SEPERATELY.

 Like me many others are facing the very same problem and definately could not bear to redownload 6.5 gb of data with a 256kbps connection.


 Please do it if possible..."
,rodrigoalone,2012-10-09T22:50Z,"wanto to say many thanks to the uploader, keep up the good work my friend. this release WORKS PERFECT, no crack needed

Fuck all you noobs, if you don't know nothing about installing a game, fuck off and learn, stop crying here.

Many thanks again!"
