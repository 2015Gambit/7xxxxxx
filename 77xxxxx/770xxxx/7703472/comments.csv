,Shadow9002,2012-10-09T12:29Z,You are back! Thanks buddy. Great quality and it fits to DVD!
,Sanny01,2012-10-11T08:15Z,"1920x800, 800p"
,PrinceVince_,2012-10-11T12:22Z,"The quality is perfectly fine, nothing to criticize as far as i can see. Since i had issues downloading the 9GB [PublicHD] release, i decided to go for this."
[T],murdoc47,2012-10-11T19:37Z,"@Sanny01
It's full HD, 1080p (only with the black bars cropped). but whatever rocks your socks."
,r1r22,2012-10-11T19:59Z,"Sanny01, 1920x1080 means the movie is in 2.35:1 widescreen, and rather than include the black pixels of the two black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, the pixels have been left ""blank"", which is black anyway. This reduces the file size without any loss of quality in the video...unless you really need to know that the black in the black bars is a projected blackness....

In fact the 800 aspect of it means the black bars are even blacker than they would otherwise be, so your criticism really is unfounded."
,hugo1717,2012-10-13T00:13Z,"Were da hell can I get a 1080 or 720p version, without the black bars (full screen)? Anyone knows? Thank you."
,herbie93,2012-10-13T03:52Z,"So I successfully downloaded this and it seems to work perfectly fine on my computer, however, it won't let me move it to anything else. If I try to put it on a flash drive with almost 30gb free space it tells me there is not enough room for it. Anyone else having the same problem? is it the mkv format?"
,rakich,2012-10-13T05:36Z,"@ herbie93 
30 gb Flash drive takes maximum of 3.99GB of single file. Cut it using HJSplit.."
,funkyw1,2012-10-13T12:35Z,"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!! It was awesome and didn't miss the bars @ all!!!"
[T],murdoc47,2012-10-13T13:30Z,"if you want to put bigger files on flash drives, first format the flash drive to NTFS file system."
,LittleAlienRobot,2012-10-13T23:09Z,"Flash drives made with Dos.. dont take big files. :)
so until the tv's get an upgrade on the DOS to say a MAC compatible sys. we are stuck.. and no MKV :("
[T],murdoc47,2012-10-14T10:01Z,OR: connect PC to TV with a hdmi cable
,r3x1000,2012-10-16T06:58Z,dont bother it doesnt work! Fucking assholes!
,tflagger997,2012-10-23T03:21Z,"Sanny01 - you are correct, the others are wrong.  They are under the mistaken impression that aspect ratio has something to do with it.  In actuality, the #p designation stands for
# - The number of horizontal lines displayed
p - Progressive (or non-Interlaced) Video

So this is actually widescreen 720p.

hugo1717 - If you do get one without black bars at the top and bottom, it will be cropped (part of the movie will not be viewable) and you will miss it."
[T],murdoc47,2012-10-23T06:16Z,"tell me, do you know the difference between aspect ratio standards like 1.85:1 or 2.35:1 or 1.33:1? if yes, then how do you fit all of those on the same standard 1.85:1 screen? black bars, right? useless black bars, hence cropped. not one pixel of the film is missing, trust me."
,tflagger997,2012-10-24T03:05Z,"murdoc - try reading what I wrote again.  I simply told hugo that if he found one without black bars, then *that one* would be cropped.  Not that your was.  

To answer your question - Yes, I do.

I do not know how I mistook this for a BluRay rip, but just found out it is the theatrical release.  None of the extra material that is coming with the BR.  The story is easy enough to understand though, and the encode is great.

It does little-to-nothing to tie into the LV-426 Alien/Aliens movies, so do not trust the claim this is a prequel.  Perhaps they are going to sequel this so-called prequel, and thereby make it so..."

,JesusChrist420,2012-11-11T06:09Z,"This has great video quality, but the sound isn't that great. I hear crackling in the background and it sounds a little muffled. "
