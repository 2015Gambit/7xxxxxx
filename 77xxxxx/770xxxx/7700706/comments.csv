,TxJag,2012-10-06T06:10Z,Well it seems that I left some out here and there but ALL the books are there.
,zipzit,2012-10-07T07:12Z,"Huh?  I'm trying to load .mobi files.  I'm getting ""The selected item could not be opened.  If you purchased this item from Amazon, delete the item and redownload it from Archived items available in Home.""

Thats not good.  I haven't yet tried to convert an epub to .mobi format, but the .mobi's as sent aren't working for me."
,TxJag,2012-10-07T07:55Z,Then do the ePub's. I used calibre to convert the mobi's to the KF8 output (typically seen with only the AZW3 format).
