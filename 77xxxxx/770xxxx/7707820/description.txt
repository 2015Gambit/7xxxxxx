Notes:   Press note: In August 1972, Elvis was a lean & mean rock & roll machine. He was still just as good as he was in 1970, but the experience that he had gained since then had made him into a mesmerizing performer. In every show that year you could see that he meant business, and like a starved predator he went straight for the jocular, taking no prisoners and knocking out audiences night after night. He was performing with a consistently high standard, and the Madison Square Garden shows show him at the apex of his performing abilities. The show on this disc was recorded roughly two months later, and the same high standard is obvious right from the get-go. This topnotch audience recording dates from Friday, August 25th, 1972 (Dinner show). Elvis could do no wrong in this period of time, and thankfully, someone was there to capture it all. This previously unreleased concert was taped by the same super-fan who recorded the concerts that were released on "LABOR DAY MADNESS" and "WATCHING DREAMS TURN INTO ASHES".
