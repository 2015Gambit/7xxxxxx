[T],RayCort,2012-10-09T03:17Z,"This is probably the last movie or TV Show I will upload on Pirate Bay because I am sick and tired of those Leechers that grab and run and don't seed to share my uploads. I am limited monthly on amount of Bandwidth, so once I see 10-15 seeders, and after 8 hours or so, I remove the torrent since it maxes my daily bandwidth amount."
,txrabbit,2012-10-09T04:20Z,Thanks again Ray.  Nice of  you to do this....I'll try to seed as long as I can once I get this.  This is like the third time I've tried.
,appletangy,2012-10-09T04:53Z,"I just want to tell you thanks. I commented this suggestion on the other one. But It seems I came a little too late on this one too, it's now 21 seeds and 200 leechers. The thing is, even those who seed are probably seeding at such a low rate that it makes no difference how much they clam to be ""seeding"". "
,madgina2,2012-10-09T05:22Z,Thank you for the upload!
,crispy3,2012-10-09T05:34Z,"Thanks RayCort.  So sad to hear this might be your last.  I alway look forward to your torrents.  I hope you change your mind..Have you tried torrent day? lemme know if you want an invite, if your not registered already :) "
,seed-or-die,2012-10-09T05:41Z,"Thank you RayCort for taking the time bro. We appreciate it. Sorry about all the leechers, they are annoying."
,seed-or-die,2012-10-09T06:33Z,"Thank you bro for this movie.
A.10
V.10

I'll seed for a few days at least."
,kinglaw25,2012-10-09T09:14Z,"RayCort don't make this your last upload... there will always be people who ""hit and run"" even on some of yify's top torrents, and some of my own... but that's not why you started... "

,meagain01,2012-10-09T13:38Z,"so sorry you feel the need to stop posting Ray they are very much appreciated,i have no cures for those hitnrunners."
,cindy25,2012-10-09T14:46Z,"I don't think this was a lack of seeders, but impatience from the initial downloaders.

as u can see there r over 500 seeders on the first torrent, and 138 on the re-seed.

this movie was far more popular than your usual releases and I think it jammed things

that said, thanks for your uploads, and if u want an invite to a private site just PM me on the piratebay forum

but i think it can work here, just mention in the description that the initial download will take time, and to be patient.  and that once seeded u will no longer reseed.  people here are used to scene releases , and need some firm guidelines.
they will seed if asked.  someday they might learn to say thank you"
,cindy25,2012-10-09T15:05Z,"much of the hit-run is unintentional.

add an instruction to ""set this torrent on forced seed""

many torrent clients automatically queue torrents for seeding.  the force fixes that"
[T],RayCort,2012-10-09T18:36Z,cindy25 I sent a PM on forum asking about private invite to a site
,botany,2012-10-09T19:51Z,"I hope you do post again I love Hallmark movies and I see you have a few.

I am new and this is my first download and I don't know what seeding is but I am just letting it run until every thing is done, I figure it will say seeded when it's done.

Anyway Thank you for the movie and I hope to get some more from you later on."

[T],RayCort,2012-10-09T22:35Z,"crispy3, I am already registered on TorrentDay and ExtraTorrent with same screen name, but I don't have uploaders rights on TorrentDay. A good place for current movies though."
,cindy25,2012-10-10T02:17Z,PM sent regarding e-books
,wyckedlyebil,2012-10-10T04:12Z,Thank you for the torrent!!! i had to stop it yesterday it was ridculous. 
,blue140,2012-10-10T13:35Z,"I really hope you don't stop uploading these amazing movies and series too. I really appreciated what you have done for us, though I couldn't say thanks because I didn't have an account."
,blue140,2012-10-10T14:26Z,"I want to add to that that Im really sorry I can't always seed, it's not intentional. My computer is really slow and when I'm using it it freezes all the time.

Anyway, thank you for everything, me and my sister have had a great time watching hollywood heights, and without you that would have been impossible, because it's nowhere else to be found, just like the other things you uploaded.

Oh and I wanted to ask, I've looked everywhere for the movie 16-Love, is there any way you could get a hold of it? I would love to see it, but I can't find it anywhere, only people in the US can watch it online:(

Thanks for the upload!!"
,crispy3,2012-10-11T02:47Z,"@RayCort - if you ever decide to upload your hallmark and lifetime movies elsewhere, I would gladly follow you :)"
[T],RayCort,2012-10-11T13:53Z,"I will give Pirate Bay one more try. If time allows, I plan to record Disney movie Girl vs. Monster and Dog with a Blog new series Friday night and hope to have them re-encoded and ready to upload here sometime Saturday morning. You may have to do the search since alot of shows an stuff get uploaded, or you can click on myname in upper right of this page and it will show all of my torrents I have uploaded here."
,blue140,2012-10-11T17:58Z,"I'm really happy to hear you give the pirate bay another chance!! and I can't wait for the movie you just called, I've already added you to my favorites, so I'll take a look at your torrents on saturday :)"
[T],RayCort,2012-10-11T19:30Z,"Geesh, I keep getting all these PMs in Pirate Bay forums asking me to record movies and TV shows, lol... I only uploaded Hollywood Heights because I noticed it was not avaialble anywhere and I was recording it for later viewing, so I thought I would share it and the few Hallmark and Lifetime Movies which can be hard to find. I guess now people think I part of a group that records and uploads daily, but in reality, I learned how to record with a cheap external analog tuner and how to remove commercials and re-encode them to smaller file size which I was able to upload to another site before it went down. Oh well, I don't mind PMs to say hello and all. but I can't fulfill the vast amount of requests for weird TV Shows and Movies I have never of."
