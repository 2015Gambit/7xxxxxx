Summary: You play the role of Azai Kyousuke, the son of a legendary gangster infamous in the underworld.

Almost without delay, the two begin a deadly cat-and-mouse game, bringing you and your friends into the crossfire. Plotting, political intrigue and layer upon layer of interlocking traps are the weapons in this epic battle of wits.
