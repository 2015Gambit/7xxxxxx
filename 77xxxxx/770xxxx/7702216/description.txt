NOTES
The BD transfer had a red tint. There has been much debates
and complaints about this issue:

Apparently, Japan uses a 9300k color temp on most of their sets,
the majority of the rest of the world (including the USA, Canada,
and Europe) uses a 6500k standard. When you watch something created
for JAP color standard on a set that uses a warmer color standard,
it has a red bias.

Also, the DVD did not have that red tint (obviously):

That's why I'm applying a white balance correction and a little
saturation increase to compensate for the color dimming.
