[V],Nepotu,2012-10-07T23:07Z,"This depends on many factors. So, I'll up when I'll up."
,pat.bateman,2012-10-07T23:31Z,"As long as you up before 12:00:00 GMT tomorrow I'll be fine. But there's also Yankees at Orioles game 1 and Reds at Giants game 2, all of which I have to see. And don't forget about NFL Eagles at Steelers, Broncos at Patriots and Chargers at Saints. 7 HUGE games everyone will wanna watch tomorrow. If you keep everyone happy, you'll be a rockstar dude!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-10-08T00:33Z,"I don't know, mate. Maybe until 2:00 PM GMT. I don't have 24 hours/day internet acces these days."
,pat.bateman,2012-10-08T00:46Z,"Ok, mate. But just so you know and you should know this by looking at the numbers of seeders and leechers, many of us only want NFL and MLB, forget about this soccer with Russian commentary and NCAA football, nobody downloads, why upload? NFL and MLB is what we're all waiting for and the reason why we respect and love you all over the Europe and the world man."
[V],Nepotu,2012-10-08T20:08Z,"Well, I will explain you shortly. I'm not interested in the number of leechers, I'm interested in helping people to find rare things (russian is the last option). I have started to up Barcelona's games (nobody was doing it at that time). I upload what the people need and ask me nicely. So, be patient and you will be pleased too! Cheers man, and I love you too, all my friends from Europe and over the world!"
