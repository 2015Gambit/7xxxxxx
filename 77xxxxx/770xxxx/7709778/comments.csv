,thxforthehelp2,2012-10-09T22:32Z,Crack works thanks for it!
,Tazimus,2012-10-09T22:46Z,"Thanks for the crack, but it would have been extra nice to actually include it in the game torrent, like, i dunno, every other freaking torrent ever...still...helps weed out the idiots i guess.  Thanks again, really."
,tadchav,2012-10-10T02:34Z,This has a better see/leech ratio than the actual game torrent
,jordanidk,2012-10-10T03:37Z,"tadchav - That's because many are still downloading the game. This downloads in under a minute.

The crack worked, however the auto save doesn't appear to work whatsoever sadly.

,peacefirexoox,2012-10-10T22:28Z,"yea so getting pissed off. played 4 times. neither times has it saved and made a directory for this game to save. i can quick save but tell you honestly think 3 hours into the game, you will constantly remember to save. There is an auto save for a reason. get the proper crack and then get back to this issue."
,natan42,2012-10-11T02:12Z,Where can I find the saves for this crack?
,peacefirexoox,2012-10-11T05:05Z,"there is no save directory. as i have stated before in my post this crack is only a prmitance to play the game. does not creat a save location. not in my documents, not in the game directory. no where."
,peacefirexoox,2012-10-11T05:11Z,"there is no save directory. as i have stated before in my post this crack is only a prmitance to play the game. does not creat a save location. not in my documents, not in the game directory. no where.-------actaully i just revisited my computer/user/name/appdata/local/skidrow...thats the only unusualy file i got there......and there are saves from today. only other game i have skidrow is borderlands bnut didnt play it today... i stand corrected though, autosave does not work. quick save does..."
,sherrypizza,2012-10-12T07:13Z,Quick save doesnot work.
,peacefirexoox,2012-10-14T19:40Z,omfg how many people will comment after me saying save fdoes not work. read the blimey pcomments and you will bloody understand that! dunces
,bwillb,2012-10-15T05:52Z,"Where are the saves I'm backing up? Instlaling this crack adds a new saves folder to the SKIDROW folder, but in my original 3dm release I can't find such a folder. Obviously it is saving, because I can load games, but where?"
,peacefirexoox,2012-10-15T07:06Z,"everyone, because this game does not initially install onto your pc, there will be no auto save directory. your quick saves will only work if you manually go into the menu and save. when you die and load, it will take you to a totally different ""save"" point. allow it then go to menu and load the BOTTOM SAVE FILE!!!! to load your last MANUAL save point; again because there is no ISO you will not have an internal save location. In ISO it would be local disk C/user/name/my documents/my games/ dishonored. this is not my torrent upload but I do know this much. I hope this helps everyone so they dont have to post a comment and not have tikasukaz respond. PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMENTING!"
