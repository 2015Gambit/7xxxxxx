,grfam,2012-10-07T02:13Z,just try and let us know
,namco-nexgen,2012-10-07T09:08Z,"Ok so here it goes;

1) It's not activated. The BGLs need to be patched.

2) Uploader forgot files in the RIP. There are flatten files that are not present.

3) Who the hell releases stuff in .7z?

4) Thank you for the effort, but the download is useless."
,atlas12,2012-10-07T14:03Z,Can anyone up the EDDF aerosoft update? 1.05
,sky198,2012-10-07T14:26Z,"no 3D buildings,can you send you install file? thanks"
,namco-nexgen,2012-10-07T23:04Z,"Sending the install file is useless. This release uses a new protection scheme which generates a serial number through Aerosoft's servers and is verified by a new library called ""ASE-DATA"".

This protection needs to be cracked somehow. The content is there, just not displayed."
