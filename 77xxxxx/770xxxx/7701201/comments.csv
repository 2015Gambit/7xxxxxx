,J3rryKo42O,2012-10-06T12:59Z,"hmm zero seeds for me too, this has been overly common since TPB went offline for that day and a half"

,ziggyff,2012-10-06T14:56Z,you cannot trust seed counts on TPB anymore this is stuck on 97% go elsewhere
,Cyberjanne,2012-10-06T15:16Z,Stuck at 97 %
,cipherpunks,2012-10-06T15:41Z,"Yeah WTF this is stuck at 97%, uTorrent client shows 49 seeders. I will bail on this torrent, I can download the whole thing from another torrent faster than I can get the last 3%."
[T],FrodooBagginz,2012-10-06T15:53Z,"There is another torrent they recently uploaded of the show ""Shark Tank"". That has been available for a little while now and all the downloaders are showing having 0.0% completion.

The reason I bring it up is because the torrents uploader is TvTeam....the same as this torrent which I am stuck at 97% on this torrent.

Something must be wrong with TvTeam."
,halfchaos,2012-10-06T16:00Z,People downloading aren't seeding much. Turn off your other downloads and set allocation to high you damn noobs!!! :|
,MajorWody,2012-10-06T16:00Z,C'mon 97% ???
