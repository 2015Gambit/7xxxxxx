[V],psspss,2012-10-08T10:27Z,"yeh I see tne had one up while I slept in mp4 format
but no one added to tpb from kat

hard to believe I wasted 2gb getting this twice and sharing it...if I saw tnes I would of gotten his over the 1.4gb source :/

lets hope crimson checks his work next time.. one has to always check start middle and end
else you get caught with a bad upload later"

Seriously, its like the shit you would get off Gnuttella back in the day. Thats why we moved to torrents.

Now we have n00bs messing that up too.

lets rencode everything to DivX3/RM/WMV7 and call it a release!

You are not just releasing poor quality works (because you HAVE to re-encode) you are slowing the progress of all man-kind you douche.
