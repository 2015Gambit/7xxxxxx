V-9
Thanks eluent. C'est magnifique. The only reason V is not 10 is because I can't crop it to a 16:9 screen. That's just a quirk of mine. Anyone who doesn't mind watching movies in ""snake funeral format"" would give it a 10... Unless you can tell me if there is special trick on VLC, because it won't do it the usual way (Video>Crop or Video>Aspect Ratio). Then I'll give you an 11. 

Oh, by the way, thanks for the subtitles. It's a rare thing with French movies - not even subtitles in French. You'd think there are no deaf people in France, and nobody else is interested in their films. Bunch of self-absorbed je-m'en-foutistes !"
,eluent,2012-10-10T03:07Z,"Thx, Fakeid !
No trick necessary, the file is already 16/9 (and it works perfectly on my 16/10 screen too on VLC and others)."
,eluent,2012-10-10T03:31Z,"Thx fakeid !
The vid is already 16/9, and VLC (and others) plays it perfectly on my 16/10 screen anyway, juste don't do any crop or pan/scan."
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-10-10T04:16Z,"@ eluent,
ah, so if it has black stripes on top and bottom and you can't get rid of them by fiddling with the crop function that means  it's already in 16:9 aspect and there's no way to get rid of the black stripes ? 

Let me know if I got that right, that way I won't keep bugging other encoders to fix something that ain't broke.

By the way I just finished watching the movie, and I must admit, it says things about sex and homosexuality that American audiences would find very subversive. Mainly, homosexuality may be a choice for those who choose it. And secondly, homosexuals are just like anybody else, they don't constitute a special interest political demographic, or ""caste"" as they like to present themselves ""en Amerique"".

Even with the slightly stilted acting I'd have to give this movie at least an 8 overall."
,eluent,2012-10-10T13:57Z,"Ok, I misread.
Sure I could have stripped the considerable black bars up and down, but 1) they don't take any significant place 2) if memory serves me right, I have to provide pure 720p if someone want to do a DVD readable by a BluRay player without haing to reencode 3) it displays fine"
,eluent,2012-10-10T14:05Z,"Oh, and about the sexual orientation aspect of the movie, I've thought about it and decided that I don't want to attract 1) people searching for sexual keyword and then complaining this isn't pron or 2) homophobic comments.
Gotta keep it light, that's the spirit of the movie concerning the matter."
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-10-10T18:59Z,"@ eluent,
Absolutely right ""Gotta keep it light"".
By the way, I looked at your other posts and I like your selections. I'm downloading ""Stellet Licht"", ""Unter den Br端cken"" and ""All or Nothing"". It might take a while. All have very few seeders and leechers. Seems there's not much demand for the good stuff. 

Also your comment about Mike Leigh's ""Secrets and Lies"" set me off looking for it. Again, you would think, since it won the Palme d' Or that people would want it. I only found a low res version at fenopy. Still, it' damn good. If you know of any high res, please post link."
,eluent,2012-10-10T20:40Z,"Lucky you, you haven't watched Secret and Lies !
I mean the first time is always the best, except for sex and swimming. I guess watching movies isn't a sport.
full DVD, come armed with patience :

in fact good idea, I might donwload it and compress it to x264, plus probably some preprocessing.."
,eluent,2012-10-10T20:56Z,"Oh, and nice that you like some of my other torrents, but I'd like to point you to Der Freie Wille : I can't advocate enough how this movie doesn't get the tenth of the love it deserves."
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-10-11T08:03Z,"I like your idea of compressing ""Secrets and Lies"" to x264. My hard drive is almost maxed out, and every little bit of compression helps. I'll keep an eye out for it.

By the way, what is a seed box and is it necessary for uploading a torrent? And how hard is it? I ask because I have some excellent movies that are in low demand (probably because they don't have explosions that destroy entire planets). But still they should be made available to those who want them. Maybe I could upload them."
,eluent,2012-10-11T22:58Z,"I don't have a seedbox, if I had maybe I wouldn't have put so much effort in the denoising/sharpening/scripting science, and would just upload whatever decent unreleased stuff would come around since seedboxes usually give you 1MB upload speed I think, tough if you put the money you can get more I guess. Still you have to fill your seedbox, located on a server somewhere with those files, so you're still bottlnecked by your home upload speed initially. Not an expert, most people who have those use them to have access to elite private trackers, which are really hard to get into, and give you the ultimate pride of having access to releases a grand total of 2.04s before the rest of the world."
,eluent,2012-10-11T23:03Z,"I'm compressing Secrets as we speak, might be able to start the torrent tomorrow, maybe next week."
,eluent,2012-10-21T19:35Z,"Done :

,botibol,2012-11-20T02:24Z,"Thanks a lot for this, I've looked everywhere for an HD version, and with spanish subtitles too, wow.

It's true fenchies are not used to include subtitles on their DVD's. I speak french but since it's not my native tongue I'd rather watch it with french or some other subs. French deaf people should be really pissed off about this."
