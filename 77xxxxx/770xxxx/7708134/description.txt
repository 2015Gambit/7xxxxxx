The unique outlook of Guiraudie at its best, fresh, simple without being stupid, 

funny and revigorating, that's pretty much all I'm ready to say since synopsyses 

are already spoiler to me.


SCREENSHOTS :
  

Technical aspects :

The video was encoded according to AVCHD specifications so I guess a DVD-R readable by your Blu-Ray player is doable.

VIDEO :

The source is HD DVB-T, 1920p, also the TV logo wasn't broadcasted! Very few 

and almost unnoticable imperfections because of the reception (which was close 

to perfect), they should not be a concern.
