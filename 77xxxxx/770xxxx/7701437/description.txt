The Airport Guys are proud to announce their second scenery release, Myrtle Beach Intl Airport! This is their debut international airport project, and is a culmination of a combined 7 years of scenery development experience. This is the most detailed scenery ever created for the Myrtle Beach Intl Airport.
 
One of the most popular vacation spots on the Atlantic coast of the United States, Myrtle Beach has a thriving airport. Originally Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, the airport became fully civilian in 1993. In recent years, there has been an explosion of traffic and new developments on the airport. The amount of passengers that departed from KMYR jumped nearly 11% in just one year from 706,000 to 780,000. This boom in passengers has been a driving force in the planning of the terminal addition.
