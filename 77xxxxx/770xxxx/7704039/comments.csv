,antignor,2012-10-11T22:40Z,"Thanks for sharing.
But sigor10, would you please be so kind to give it some more seeding? It's stuck at somewhat over 1/3 and there are many people trying to download without any seeders. "
,sigor10,2012-10-14T04:00Z,"@antignor Im seeding all the time,but pls everyone don't download and run away. "
,antignor,2012-10-15T21:25Z,"It's finally in. I have a ratio of over 10 now and still seeding.
Maybe some people didn't like the slow speed and jumped ship before the port was even in sight, taking their positive ratio with them. But seeing the current s/l ratio (31:3), most people were patient and willing enough to seed."
