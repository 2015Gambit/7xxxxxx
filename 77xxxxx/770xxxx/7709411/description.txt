The Heckler is a fictional character, a superhero parody published by DC Comics'. He first appeared in The Heckler #1 (cover-dated September 1992), an on-going series that lasted six issues, ending with The Heckler #6 (cover-dated February 1993).

Stuart "Stu" Moseley, co-owner of "Eats", a skid row diner in the ghetto section of Delta City, fights the injustices and slightly goofy criminal element as The Heckler, armed only with his sarcastic wit and a brightly colored costume. Stu's motivations and origins are unknown. Possibly he's just a glutton for punishment, for it seems that he receives no respect from his contemporaries in either his civilian or costumed alter ego's existence. It is notable that while walking around as Stu, he ends up coming across as slightly anal, frustrated and awkward; when wearing his costume, he seems to become a completely different person.

Stuart has spent time in the meta-fiction of 'Limbo' along with many other forgotten heroes. The group is led by 'Merry Man' of the Inferior Five. All are rescued by Superman; they assist him against a cosmic threat.

Part of the 'Restoration' process is done to make it possible to enlarge these images. As such, after you have opened the files in a comic book reader, some of you may actually need to shrink them down a bit to achieve the best image quality possible.

After it was pointed out to me that people were getting a GonVisor popup, I am now creating these books in such a way as to have stopped that from happening. No GonVisor popup will appear on any 'Restorations' in the future.

So what does 'Restored' mean? Well, with respect to all the work the scanners have done in order to make these books available, the pages were not yellow when first printed. Ugly grey newsprint? Yes, often they were. Cheap, thin paper? Yeah, that too. But not yellow. And not looking like some ancient, faded artifact.

In most cases, the changes make the books look better than they did when they were originally printed. By turning the newsprint or cheap paper they were printed on to a bright white, with crisp, clearly differentiated greys and solid black lines on top, they look very much like a new b&w comic you would buy right off the shelf today on high quality paper.

This is accomplished by directing you to read the description in on of my other uploads so this torrent will post without giving me an error.
