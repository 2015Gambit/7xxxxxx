I posted over on the other IGTM torrents and thought I'd pop in here as well...  

My name is James Swirsky - Iâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;m one of the two people who made Indie Game: The Movie. Myself and Lisanne Pajot spent our last two years working on this film. We kept a pretty active blog about the production of the film on our site (www.indiegamethemovie.com).

We are a two person team, making this film completely independently. And we want to keep on making films, just like this one, for people to enjoy.

If you like the movie, consider purchasing it over on iTunes, Steam or completely DRM-Free (in a variety of encodes) directly from us over at http://www.IndieGameTheMovie.com. You can also get a copy to gift to a friend if youâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;d like to.

Thanks for taking an interest in our film.

-James Swirsky
Co-director/Maker of Indie Game: The Movie"
