From acclaimed filmmakers John Moore (Max Payne, Behind Enemy Lines, The Omen and the upcoming Die Hard 5) and Richie Smyth, comes the story of Colonel John Donner, aka John Doe. ItΓÇÖs the last days of World War One ΓÇô the Great War. On an obscure patch of mud, a small company of American soldiers fights to the last man against a powerful German offensive. John Doe is the only American survivor of the attack. He wanders alone for days amongst the maze of trenches and blast holes. Shellshocked, badly wounded and without food or medicine, he is lost. Through a twist of events, Donner is transformed into a creature of unthinkable power, a monster that pledges he will avenge the deaths of his fallen comrades, not only on the muddy battlefields of WWI, but across the generations to the slaughter-fields of the "War on Terror." With abnormal strength and agility he hunts his enemies. But DonnerΓÇÖs actions have not gone unnoticed ΓÇô and he will soon face an enemy from a place he could never have contemplated.
