---: Story :---

Premiered on April 21 1913 in Mumbai, Phalke's first full-length feature stars a man named Salunke as the Leading Lady, since women didn't get to act in movies at the time. Only one reel survives of the king who suffers to prove his commitment to truth.
The story of Raja Harischandra is taken from the Mahabharata, the classical Indian Epic, and tells about the righteous king who sacrifices his kingdom, wife and son to fulfil his promise to Sage Vishwamitra. Convinced of his ideals, the Gods in Heaven declare him to be the living embodiment of Truth and restore him to his former regal glory.
