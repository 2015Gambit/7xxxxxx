London is in chaos. A military cargo plane has crashed
leaving its highly classified contents strewn across
the city. Completely unaware London is in lockdown,
Charlie (Noel Clarke) and Shelley (Antonia Campbell-Hughes)
accompanied by best friends Mark (Colin O'Donoghue) and
Nikki (Laura Haddock), are at Storage 24 dividing up their
possessions after a recent break-up.

Suddenly, the power goes off. Trapped in a dark maze of
endless corridors, a mystery predator is hunting them
one by one. In a place designed to keep things in, how
do you get out?
