,sv504,2012-10-07T08:39Z,You should never install software with a black screen afte. You can only use black screen aftes for watering your plants.
,chop007,2012-10-07T13:42Z,"Shame bro, you must be struggling incredibly to ask for help here, please excuse the incensative pricks they truly are a reflection of the underbelly muck that the world spews out. Yeh man, without more info I cannot help you much but only to say that if you where coming from win7, the best would be to reinstall a backup, first wipe your drives and then do a fresh intstall. You probably got driver issues if you where upgrading, if you need help just try send me a message and I will get in touch via email, then I can guide you through the process, skype would also be easier then I can see what is going on and guide you step for step. Shweet bro I hope you come right."
