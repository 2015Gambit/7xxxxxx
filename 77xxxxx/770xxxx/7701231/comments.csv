Right. The young do not have that kind of money so this is delusional propaganda for the rich. 

Didn't succeed in saving up money? Don't blame the rich who fucking own everything, even DC."

Because they have to pay for the costly welfare state that won't be there for them when they're old ?"

,AlexLibman,2012-11-09T07:09Z,"Halbermunken:  Why don't you calculate how much you'd save for your retirement if you got to keep and invest all the money that the government steals from you every year...  (Yes, you can hire a South Korean third grader to help you with the math.)  And government regulations have tremendous side-effects that skyrocket retirement costs: non-market health-care prices, property taxes, etc.  People can pool risks through non-profit mutual aid societies and other voluntary organizations."
