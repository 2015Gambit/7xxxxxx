Looks like mostly 128kbps based on the file sizes.

Also check out this torrent, as it has all the same studio albums, without some of the live (Berlin, Destroyer) and ""other"" (No Quarter, Kashmir) performances, and is *much* larger in size per track (though that does not always mean higher quality!):
