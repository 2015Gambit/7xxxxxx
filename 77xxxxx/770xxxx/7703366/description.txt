Robert Crumb - My Troubles With Women

Last Gasp, 2003

Written and Illustrated by Robert Crumb and Aline Kominsky-Crumb

Most, if not all of these stories were previously printed in one book or another. Be it a Crumb book or an anthology. There may be a couple of new short pieces, I just can't find confirmation one way or the other. Still a nice collection of stories focusing on one theme (one that should be pretty clear from the title). A nice introduction of Crumb newbies (if there are any of those out there) and another one of the missing pieces for completists.
