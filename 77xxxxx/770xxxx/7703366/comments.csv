,SplhcbPrime,2012-10-07T09:55Z,have u given any thought to mayhaps combining ur efforts into groups?
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-07T10:09Z,"SplhcbPrime, oh yes, most definitely given it a great deal of thought. The decision I've come to, for quite a number of reasons, is that so long as I'm not getting burned out by uploading them as single books, or single title runs, this is the way I'm going to go about it.

I'm really into fast-serve, freedom of choice downloads to as many people as possible. The way I'm uploading right now best accomplishes that goal."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-07T10:16Z,"For instance, the Robert Crumb folder from which all of the Crumb files are being seeded is approaching 7 GB and contains 183 files. That's just far too large (imo) to upload as one torrent.

Uploaded the way it is...

People can choose the files they want with ease (I use tags pretty religiously, so there isn't even a need to search, just click on a tag in one and be led to the rest).

People get the files faster, because they don't need to wait for 7 GB to download (something particularly beneficial to people with even moderately slow internet speeds).

People are MUCH more likely to continue seeding the smaller chunks, verses a mountain of a torrent, thereby making the files available to more people overall (go back to my first two point and apply them to everyone else who seeds my uploads). 

Lastly, I do upload some rather large complete runs. And I upload series and/or volume runs complete almost exclusively. I uploaded a 14 issue run this evening, and I've uploaded several folders that are over a GB.

[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-07T10:31Z,"Yeah, click on the tags EXCEPT for the times when I'm uploading torrents in the middle of the night (morning really) and spell somebodies name wrong, which will lead you to exactly one file. Yeah, don't click on the name in that case. P'shh!"
,SplhcbPrime,2012-10-07T11:36Z,"people can choose which file(s) they want to dl when they are grouped too, dontchaknow?  grouping just seems less tedious than the myriad of confusing titles u r uploading."
,SplhcbPrime,2012-10-07T11:45Z,"eg:  the robert crumb volumes could have been combined into one reasonably sized torrent, and if i wanted all, or just some, of these volumes, i could pick and choose what i want from that one grouped torrent (the utorrent client is good that way.)  ur way, i have to dl > 10 torrents."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-07T16:30Z,"LOL! OK, then. Apologies for being so tedious. I guess I should just upload superhero books so you won't be confused.

Read my comments, nobody has a problem with the way I'm uploading. Thanks for checkin' out my stuff, though. On to the next one! ----------------->"
,SplhcbPrime,2012-10-08T01:58Z,LOL
,SplhcbPrime,2012-10-08T02:00Z,"so, ur plan is to populate this website with > 1600 individual titles?  wow, and waayyy kewl... not."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-08T02:57Z,"SplhcbPrime, if the following response does not make clear my position and you still have a problem, please address your issues with a Pirate Bay moderator at this point.

First of all, my uploads are well organized and filled with information.

Second, they're quality uploads. Period.

Third, people want them and obviously have no problem with the way they're being uploaded. 

I uploaded 20 pages of comic books and other than a small handful, all of them are still being seeded. 

Fourth, your complaint has no merit. It's nonsense. 

The Pirate Bay comic book section is FILLED with single issue uploads that are less organized and less informative than mine. Nobody complains about them. And nobody has a problem finding what they're looking for.

And as I explained to you previously, the Crumb folder is over 7 GB. There is no way, even if I had all the files when I started (and it didn't, something downloaders were aware of), I would NEVER have uploaded a torrent that large. 

Also, AGAIN, as I already explained to you, all of my files are NOT single file uploads. MANY of them are single title runs, the same as your uploads! The ones that aren't are very often collected TPBs, graphic novels or longer books. 

Lastly, the only books I consistently upload as a single file are the Underground books that only have ONE ISSUE. And I'm uploading them as single files because I'm restoring them as I go, a project that already has a very loyal group of downloaders. 

Basically, you're trying to stir the pot for one of two reasons. My uploads get in the way of your shiny special uploads, or you're just too lazy to download multiple torrents. In other words, you're complaining about the way you get something for free that you did ZERO work to supply. 

The Pirate Bay comic book sharing community is a very chill place and I will make every effort to keep it that way. As such, I'll not debate this issue with you any further. If you have a problem with my uploads, please seek the assistance of The Pirate Bay moderators (ya know, the ones who gave me a skull because they liked my uploads). "
,SplhcbPrime,2012-10-09T13:08Z,"wow; y such an emotional response?  and y would u view my ?s as a ""complaint?""  things that make u go, ""hmmmm...""  lts, ur defensiveness, and attempts to demean me, speak volumes."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-09T18:51Z,"Hey, thanks for checking out my uploads SplhcbPrime. As I have already mentioned, should you have any concerns with my uploads or my comments you should address them with a Pirate Bay moderator."
