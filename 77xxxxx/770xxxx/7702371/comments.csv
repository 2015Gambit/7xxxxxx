,aabunko78,2012-10-07T00:38Z,"works on my FLT release with update 1 by FLTDOX

Great update thanks!

If you have the FLT release and lost your save game, just go to
‘C:Users(your login name)AppDataLocalFLTSteam208500 remote’
copy your save games and paste over on
‘C:Users(your login name)AppDataLocalSKIDROW208500Storage’
should have your save games back. not sure if ’208500′ may be a different number on your system"
,philoz494,2012-10-07T00:47Z,"For me, you have to start all over again, pretty lame..."
,lamole234,2012-10-07T01:26Z,if include update 1 why Update 2 to 5? 
,SilentViper01,2012-10-07T09:43Z,"philoz494 just follow this and u will get ur savegame back:

,trekvr,2012-10-07T16:05Z,Game is getting closed after the iniitial start screen..with this update installed. Please let me know on how to resolve this.
,adamqazqaz,2012-10-07T17:23Z,instal steam and then you must change location of savegame
,FlankerB1,2012-10-07T17:47Z,"@adamqazqaz
So this crack requires steam. Bad job by skidrow, if it is skidrow."
,juanreus,2012-10-07T17:53Z,thank guys I scared to hell when the game told me to create a new user xD
,adamqazqaz,2012-10-07T18:28Z,but still this patch is shitt it destroy more thinks than it helps so if you want to play w8 for another patch this is so bad
,krneki123a,2012-10-07T19:01Z,"Patch 5 is so bugged it was removed from Steam.

Stay away from this update"
,Redbrpt,2012-10-08T00:08Z,"@trekvr Download Steam; login; add game as non-steam game, very simple; then just start the game via steam. It takes a while to load, but it's good afterwards. CHeers"
,adamqazqaz,2012-10-08T08:11Z,"they create a game witch didnt work, after one week finaly they create a patch, after few patches it is worse then ever, good job codemaster"
,trekvr,2012-10-08T16:03Z,"@Redbrpt Thanks a lot..working now after installing steam. But the update is still not working for ""AutoSave"" bug.

I started new career and tried to skip practice session for Australia GP,but after loading screen it is again coming back to practice session instead of Qualifying. This is ridiculous..

,bryk,2012-10-08T17:16Z,"Well, this update screwed my game up pretty bad. Was working well just an hour ago before I applied the patch, now every time I hit replay the cars poly models just disappear and there's weird graphics glitches everywhere, what the actual fuck?"
,Irishd15,2012-10-08T20:13Z,Guys this update#5 is officialy broken and it WILL break whatever version of the game you have....codemasters pulled it from steam because of this and are due to re-release it today.
,simets,2012-10-08T22:12Z,Here is the chance for SKIDROW to repair this broken update. Patch #5 is on Steam as of this moment...
,Maynard46,2012-10-09T16:13Z,"wow, this game is beyond broken for me. i never have these kinds of issues but i cant hear any car sound. When I do the young driver test the car just sits in the garage and i cant do anything to get out. In quick mode race again, no sound other than the menu chirp sounds. But when i pause the game and come back, the car takes off but my camera view stays on the track like the car is sitting still. "
,savvasferrari,2012-10-10T01:33Z,"apply this patch
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7684994/F1_2012_Update_1-FLTDOX

and the game will revert to patch 1!"
,Bundi001,2012-10-11T00:58Z,"I tried applying this update and the game keeps crashing at the loading screen (does it for the first update by FLTDOX as well)! I tried adding the game to Steam as a ""non-Steam"" game and launching it from there but no difference. It still crashes at the loading screen! WTF is going on? Does anyone know how to fix this?"
,jawad87,2012-10-11T23:39Z,@Bundi001 try installing steam on your pc and then launch the game from the .exe
,Quartzbambi,2012-10-18T04:53Z,dont install this update. install only udate 1. everything is fixed in updaye 1 including autosave
,jawad87,2012-11-05T18:45Z,"why so many seeders when this does not work, could someone explain?"
