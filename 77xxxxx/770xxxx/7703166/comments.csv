[V],jmz619,2012-10-07T12:32Z,On your uTorrent right click on this torrent that your currently seeding and click properties then select the checkbox that says initial seed it will make it much to seed the torrent to mulitple users.
,ristopalazzo,2012-10-07T16:27Z,Gotcha. I'm new at this so bear with me.
[V],jmz619,2012-10-07T17:03Z,Yes and another plus to initial seeding is that it doesn't show you on the peers column as the 100% so you somewhat invisible to other leechers.

Here's my vinyl rip of Opeth - Ghost Reveries if you're interested."
,vintage_vinyl,2012-10-08T20:08Z,"thanks ristopalazzo this is actually a good record musically great players the vocals take a little getting use too but on the slower parts the singer actually has a good voice much better than most death metal out there, these guys are actually quite talented...very good quality rip, thanks again,
