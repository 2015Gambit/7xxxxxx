,whaletail935,2012-10-09T14:47Z,"Thanks for your HD uploads.  While file size may increase, these comics look fantastic on both my retina MBP (and iPad as well).

I'm unable, however, using magnet links, to select specific files within a larger torrent prior to downloading (I use utorrent).  With the previously available ""regular"" torrent files, I could check/uncheck individual files through the UI.  With magnet links, the UI still appears, but is always blank (within the files checklist box).

While this is not an issue with your releases, as you can imagine, having to download 100+ comics to grab a single issue can be annoying.  While not a dealbreaker, having noted your above comment about selecting individual comics within a torrent, I'm hoping you can enlighten me  about how to use this functionality with magnet links (Agan, with utorrent as my client.

In any case thanks again for your HD uploads"
[V],RubrumPopulus,2012-10-09T17:00Z,"@whaletail935:  You can deselect files after the fact.  Shortly after loading a magnet link, it should recognize the full list of files.  Now, even though it's already begun downloading them all,  you can go into the list of files and turn off which ones you don't want.  In utorrent there are a few tabs at the bottom, and one of them is a list of files included in the torrent.  Select, or multi-select the files you don't want in the filelist, right click and select ""Don't Download"".  It'll change the priority from normal to ""skip"".  I hope that helps, and thanks for the kind words. :)"
