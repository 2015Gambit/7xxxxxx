,madabouttv,2012-10-27T14:52Z,Thanks so much for this - will be eternally grateful for series 11 - 18 - if you have any more x
,N0Drew,2012-10-29T22:56Z,"I have begun watching Series 11. I don't expect that I will index and seed anything that I have not watched myself.

I was thinking that I would Series 11 and start seeding it around 17:00 GMT on Friday this week. This seems to be the time when the world is going into its weekend torrenting frenzy, and I can get these things well seeded by just leaving my PC on for just one night.

The thing is, the files in Series 11 have an aspect issue ratio issue. The aspect ratio in the files says 4:3, but it should say 16:9. These are meant to watched wide screen. With VLC you can override the incorrect aspect ratio and watch at the correct 16:9 ratio. I don't think you can do this with Windows Media Player.

I suppose it may be possible to do this somehow using the features of your TV or DVD player too, since these files have been TheBox.bz for quite a while and people download them. But I do not know how you would correct this in that context.

Are these files still of interest given this fact?

I have peeked at the remaining series (which I got from TheBox.bz).

Series 12 and 13 have the same problem with aspect ratio. And some of the episodes in Series 12 have hard-coded Norwegian subtitles.

The files in Series 14 and 15 are poor quality video despite being twice as big as those in the seasons up to Series 13. And the file names follow no pattern! Files grabbed from all over the place I think.

Series 16, 17 and 18 look very good (PDTV).

I hope that by the time I get to Series 14 (if my interest in this is sustained that long), there may be a PDTV version of it. I see PDTV versions of individual episodes being added frequently. Rebroadcasts on satellite or some other unencrypted media.

Perhaps you should consider joining TheBox.bz (I very much recommend it if you you like UK TV) rather than relying on me"

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7774497/Heartbeat_-_Series_11_(2001-2002)__[TVRip_(XVID)]

I may not give as much upload capacity to this as I have in the past. So please leave it seeding for a while once you have it."
,madabouttv,2012-10-30T20:24Z,Don't mind at all my TV sorts out the aspect ratio - thanks so much :) So will keep coming back to see if anything else has been uploaded :)
,Amosis,2012-10-31T00:34Z,"Thanks so much for these. I watched series 1-7 plus 12, 13 and 18. I just finished 13 yesterday and was all bummed out. "
,madabouttv,2012-10-31T17:51Z,I joined the box & almost thought I had died & gone to heaven at all the wonderful British TV shows but then read the rules & regulations & from what I understand I would have to seed the shows for almost a decade before I built up a good enough reputation to download myself - this in itself would be so difficult as I stay i South Africa & only have a 1meg line & our service providers throttle our use for torrents :( - will do my best to seed series 11 back for you - I don't suppose you have peak practice? I saw it on The box & would love to have this show
,N0Drew,2012-11-01T17:30Z,"No. I do not have Peak Practice. I think I saw some episodes once. It didn't grab me. Heartbeat is essentially a ""mystery"" series. A new mystery each week. Without this I think Heartbeat could just be another soap opera for me. And I fear that as I get through more episodes it may degenerate into that. With more and more ""one of"" roles by well known British actors, at the expense of the quality of the mystery aspect. We'll see.

A year ago I did not even really know what a torrent was. Let alone a private tracker. Since then I have put in a lot of effort into trying to understand how to do this. And I changed my ISP to accommodate doing this. And I have bought several USB hard drives! But this effort has been well worth it. And it is helping me to keep my mind from rotting too. I am not particularly young. You may have to go down a similar road."
