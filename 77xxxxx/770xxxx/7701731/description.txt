The Ed Show; October 4, 2012.

President Obama fires back at Mitt Romney 13 hours late, after the first presidential debate. "Governor Romney may dance around his positions," Obama told supporters in Denver Thursday.  "But if you want to be president, you owe the American people the truth."

Ed welcomed Stephanie Cutter (Obama Campaign Deputy Campaign Manager),  to review last night's performance and the way forward.

Then, Sam Stein (Huffington Post political editor), and E.J. Dionne (Senior Fellow at The Brookings Institution and Washington Post columnist), looked at Romney's style versus the president's substance.

President Obama said we can't double down on the policies that created the Great Recession. Ed welcomed David Cay Johnston (Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and author of "The Fine Print: How Big Companies Use 'Plain English' To Rob You Blind"), to examine Romney's $5 trillion lie.


All of a sudden Mitt Romney is concerned for the middle-class.  James Hoffa (President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters), reacted to Romney's pandering to the middle class.

Ed brought the latest on Mitt Romney's plan to fry Big Bird!

And in the Big Finish, Ohio is the key to victory for both candidates. Ed asked state Sen. Nina Turner (D-OH) whether last night's debate was a game changer for voters in her state.
