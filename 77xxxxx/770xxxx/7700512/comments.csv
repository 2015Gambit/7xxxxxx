[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-06T15:12Z,"Shame we didnt get to know this Doctor better. This was the US Pilot as well. REALLY has that whole late 80s-early 90s tv production to it which was a shame considering it came in the later 90s. Special effects werent the best and i was totally not a fan of the way they did the Tardis or Master(he was just to ''rock and roll"" for me if you catch my drift) They really didnt give this doctor time to grow like the others did, wish i got to see more of him. I have heard about the new 5 doctors episode thats supposed to be coming here some day soon and i guess Paul McGanns coming back for that episode as well as Tennant and Eccelstein. Love your whole 'channel' here. Ill try to help seed as best as i can, probably will convert some of these to the mp4 formats i do."
