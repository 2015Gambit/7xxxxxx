,beerman100,2012-10-06T13:57Z,"Does it ever help when someone says 'seed please' ? Always wondered - cause at this rate season will be over before I get to watch quali !

Thanks though to Albiondean for your work. Appreciate it."
,arnaval,2012-10-06T14:34Z,"Thanks a lot for sharing.
Please stop using decade-old, inefficient video codecs and switch to h.264, though. It always pains me when people do this. You get much better quality for the same size."
,frostbite88,2012-10-06T15:44Z,waitin for HD ver thanks
,ali_nba,2012-10-06T16:13Z,BBC or SKySport?
,Rubyconn,2012-10-06T16:35Z,"Thanks a million, albiondean. You're quite a bit faster than footy. (he STILL hasn't uploaded the qualifying) But like arnaval says, please switch to h.264 and use .mkv container if you have the opportunity. It would save lots of people for trouble.

On a slightly unrelated note, why does all the F1 uploaders still use SD? If anyone has problem playing HD content they can just downscale and compress it themselves. On the other hand, you can't turn SD into HD, that quality is lost forever."
,SerSpec-V,2012-10-06T19:35Z,Thanks.
