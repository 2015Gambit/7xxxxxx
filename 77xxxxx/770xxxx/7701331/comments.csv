,TsarB0mba,2012-10-06T15:01Z,"Thanks again for getting some of these more obscure rips psspss - while your choice of XviD and .avi continue to give me fits I do appreciate you making the content available, so have a + up front from me."
[V],psspss,2012-10-06T15:14Z,"just me seeding still.. wont be far away but some
arent sharing as well as they could.. as ive already shared 100 percent and its still around 80"
[V],psspss,2012-10-06T15:18Z,"i only do xvids most know that already.. theres 720p out maybe a 480 as well if look

main reason I do xvids is I have less issues with them across all devices

and secondly I dont want to have same or better quality then commercial sites offer dvds or streams or cable.. as sharing is about content/fans not competing with business sales/profits

it should be a balance.. else gives them reason to shutdown p2p more and more"
[V],psspss,2012-10-06T15:19Z,:I
[V],psspss,2012-10-06T15:26Z,"some good class a evps in this

and some movement caught on tape"
[V],psspss,2012-10-06T15:44Z,"OK 70 plus real seeders now my job is done.. bed time again

note some at kat say it wont play.. gobblers

bloody xbox xvid I beat...

did you know VLC 1.11.1 installs a back ground service.. you can use app like vlc direct to
stream to phone these cvids i do or ICS tablet
works great."
,bubbanuggzz,2012-10-06T19:45Z,plays just fine on xbox360.thnx again pss :)
[V],psspss,2012-10-07T03:29Z,"I meant bet not beat LOL
was 4am though when I posted

im surprised it works on xbox.. but then theres xbox and xbox 360

some converts work and others dont without
changing a thing

but i suspect its to do with FPS.. needs to be 30?
I leave FPS to that of source"
