Bronx In Blue is an all-acoustic blues outing highlighting the music that first inspired Dion as a child growing up in the Bronx. With songs by Robert Johnson, Willie Dixon, Jimmy Rogers, Hank Williams, Lightnin’ Hopkins and Jimmy Reed, the collection is a soulful tour de force for Dion, not only in his familiar role as a magnificently interpretive vocalist but, also, as a brilliantly innovative guitarist.

Dion notes, "When I was a kid, there was no Rock & Roll. In the early 50’s – late at night, I’d tune into Wheeling, West Virginia (WWVA), listening to the Blues – Howlin’ Wolf’s ‘How Many More Years,’ Jimmy Reed’s ‘Bright Lights, Big City.’ After school, I’d run home to catch the last half hour of the ‘Don Larkin Country Show’ coming out of Newark. I was a Hank Williams junkie; for me, putting country and blues together – that’s what I call Rock & Roll."

Previewing the album in MOJO, Paul Déchamé writes, "Recalling the back-to-basics approach of Cash’s American recordings – muted drums, acoustic guitars – it’s a little like having Dion in your front room strumming his favourite blues songs." Don McCleese, in No Depression, sums up Bronx In Blue thusly: "It all sounds like Dion. It all sounds great."
