Trustable torrent, no .rar files, only the game files!"
,matthewrocks123,2012-10-09T07:36Z,Is this actually working?
,matthewrocks123,2012-10-09T07:37Z,Sorry for the double post but the other comments didn't show up till after I wrote my comment. Will download and seed if working!
,breadand,2012-10-09T07:43Z,I was desperate and downloaded this. To my surprise it worked!!!! Playing it but stopped to share the good news
,breadand,2012-10-09T07:44Z,also. thanks abernick00
,plagasx,2012-10-09T07:54Z,If it's the same 3DM one that is going around it is not working...
,matthewrocks123,2012-10-09T08:17Z,"Yeah it works! Although it just crashed when I went to the sewer :/ but I bought the game so I can play tomorrow, just had to try it tonight. Still, great find abernick00, you're a life saver."
,ant2805,2012-10-09T08:48Z,"Is there something I did wrong ??

I tried every crack on skidrow site, tpb and i'm getting crash issues.

I found about this one still crashing !

Why I'm I the only one that still having this issue."
,Secretz.R.Us,2012-10-09T11:16Z,"Tried the other cracks, couldn't get them to work...this one worked like a charm. I'm playing right now. Thanks uploader! Btw, used it on the 3DM release from here..."
,abernick00,2012-10-09T11:45Z,"This crack seems to be working on both the 3DM release, and SKIDROWdotNET release that I put up. I have played well PAST the sewers, and had no crashing. 
If anyone is having trouble, make sure your firewall is on, and do NOT let the program access the internet. If you do not know how to stop the program from getting online, then just unplug your computer and use this crack. That MAY be your problem. 
FYI, i did not ""make"" this crack, I only found it in a forum as i stated. I appreciate all the thanks. "
,seiphirot854-11,2012-10-09T17:54Z,i confirm working for me (v5 of skidrow wasnt working but this one yes!!!!)
,callmewut,2012-10-09T18:20Z,"says im missing binkw32.dll, wut? help please"
,killerbuz13,2012-10-09T19:32Z,"I got the same Problem ^ With ""binkw32.dll"" says its missing. Help??"
,abernick00,2012-10-09T20:53Z,"bink32.dll problems can happen for a few reasons. It is common in D/L a copy of a game. 
1. try updating your video card driver
2. restart your computer
3. re-install the game and use my crack that is posted here.... or D/L the same Dishonored that I uploaded, and use this crack. It seems to be working for everyone.
4. after installing the game, try to search for bink32.dll. If you D/L a bad rip of the game, sometimes the file would be in the wrong place.

Note: Even if you're not asked to, be sure to restart your computer after the uninstall and before the reinstall. Restarting your computer at this point will ensure that any loaded files are cleared from memory and that the uninstallation is 100% complete."
,Shant07,2012-10-10T13:06Z,mine worked with this crack but then crashed.. over and over.. ugh I wish I can play the fucking game for once...
,abernick00,2012-10-10T18:25Z,"I'm well past the sewers and have just met the ""loyalists"" and have not had ONE crash... If the game is crashing, then you need to reinstall. If you downloaded the 3DM copy that was released right before mine, then used their crack, you may have an issue. They have fixed it since. I wish I could help, but maybe you need to update your video card driver?? What kind of video card do you use?? i have two Nvidia 560ti's running in SLI, and the game looks amazing.  "
,xevyx,2012-10-11T23:39Z,"Which forum did you find this on? I'm trying to figure out who made this crack, so that I can track down the save game folder >"
,xevyx,2012-10-11T23:42Z,Where are the save games for this crack??
,cyberpunk88,2012-10-12T08:02Z,man! you are awesome!!! finally a working crack
,duo403,2012-10-12T13:14Z,"hey guys i'm having a problem. the crack works fine, but after i get past the intro screens, it just randomly crashes. any ideas on what to do? i've tryd to find something about it, but nothing comes up. please help"
,abernick00,2012-10-15T02:32Z,"my save games work OK, they do not show how long you have been playing, which is strange. It just says ""days:hours:minutes"" where it should say how long you have been playing. Also, when i do a manual save, I have to use the second one from the top of the list to continue. In the ""intro"" screen where you can choose ""resume"" ""options"", etc, select ""load game"" and find the one that you saved yourself.  That is how i have been playing it through. If anyone has a fix for the save game problem, please, let us know.  Thnks. "
,abernick00,2012-10-15T02:37Z,"As for the forum where i found the crack, I don't remember where, I was just scrolling through ""tehParadox"" website forums. No other team had come up with a working crack, and I lucked out and the one i found worked... I haven't had a crash yet, but the save game problem can be worked around."
,abernick00,2012-10-15T02:39Z,"oh, and make sure you have windows firewall blocking any new programs attempting to access the internet. There is an option on the firewall to notify you of any program trying to access the internet. DO NOT allow this game to access the internet."
,abernick00,2012-10-17T23:29Z,"in order to fix the save game problem, download the ""skidrow save game fix"" on google. Be aware that it will erase your current games that are saved. I started all over, but still had a blast playing it again@"
