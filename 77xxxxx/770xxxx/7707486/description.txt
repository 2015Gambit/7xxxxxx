With a focus on Al-Jazeera and its new affiliate, Al-Jazeera International, Terror Television: The Rise of Al-Jazeera and the Hate America Media examines the global media and propaganda battlefield. AIM argues that the influence of Al-Jazeera is a fundamental reason why winning the war in Iraq has proven to be so difficult, and that the emergence of Al-Jazeera International threatens to make it more difficult, if not impossible, to win the global war on terrorism.
