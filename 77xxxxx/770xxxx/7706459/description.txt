An AWESOME(IN MY OPINION) Podcast run by a bunch of guys in Brisbane, Australia, just sitting about and chatting in one of their living rooms.

Totally irrelevant frequently derailing their train of thoughts and ending up in completely seperate subjects.

With a steadfast refusal to edit their work and no real scripts other than a general list of points they "intend" to cover episodes can go for a considerable length of time  the longest running for approximately 3 and a half hours.

While the show frequently had guest hosts these mainly fell into the categories of mates who they invited over with only one or two exceptions One of these being Yahtzee from escapistmagazine.com's "Zero Punctuation"

After disappearing from the internet almost 2 years ago I have finally managed to retrieve 16 out of their 18 episodes the 2 absent episodes being the live cast and another one which ended up at such low audio quality that they pulled it from the site.

I have been without this series since my former computer died taking the episodes with it and I have only just remembered that my old Ipod might still have them as I hadn't used it since the days of my fomer PC I am seeding this torrent so that should I ever lose them again I will know that they are out there online being shared so please download this torrent enjoy the eps tell your friends spread the Gospel of these three sages of our age Korthal, Hawky and The Scarecrow
