You can't make information magically appear by tossing 10 algoritms on 16/44. No dynamic range is going to drop out of blue air.  No filtering goes unpunished.

I think it's smarter to invest in a good stereo system so you can actually hear what you are doing. 

Most old reggae records sounded like shit anyway because of the frequent recycling of vinyl. "
,beavis39,2012-10-09T02:32Z,"So did you listen and then judge or just assume based on what you read? You think I am just slapping some processing on a 16/44 file and calling it 24/96. This could not be farther from the truth.

Of course I cannot just invent detail. The details are already there, you just can't hear them due to the bare minimum hi-fi 16-/44 bitrate.

I have been doing this for over 10 years. I only recently started to share them. It is a shame that people just try to dethrone me instead of trying to learn from me.

The recordings I provide will sound better on any stereo system, be it an Ipod or extreme hi-fi system. I have know this ever since I blew a friends mind doing this with a Santana CD. Both of us heard detail we had never heard before. I have not looked back since.

I don't mean to sound like a pompous ass but I think I am way ahead of the curve. There is nothing but truth and reality here and it is only a matter of time until this is a publicly know fact."

I am not trying to argue with you, but what you claim to be doing with these audio files simply defies the laws of physics (as it pertains to sound). Simply put, when a CD is pressed, the audio on the disc has been downsampled, meaning, parts of the sine wave are removed so that the data fits conveniently on single 700 MB compact disc. What that means is, the original analog sine wave has bits removed at a specified sampling rate. It is no longer the smooth flowing sine wave analogous to the original sound produced in the studio. The 16bit sound wave is now notched in appearence, due to the fact that it has lost audio information. See the sine wave example on this link:

,hoarybat,2012-10-09T03:54Z,"Anyways, information has been permanently lost when the audio was downsampled to CD quality. It is not hidden in the CD anywhere. What you are doing is analogous to creating an mp3 from a wave file then converting the mp3 back to a wave file. The information during compression has been discarded (in effort to save data storage space), and when re-expanded, it is still absent. Your claims to have been doing this for 10 years is unfortunate, as you have been sadly mistaken for a decade and likely have harddrives full of wasted space. Take what HDTracks.com does for a living. They release high-fidelity re-releases, but with each, they have to go back to the original master source to acquire all the audio information. If what you are claiming is possible, HDTracks could simply upsample all their 16bit/44.1kHz files to 24bit/96kHz. However, this isn't ""true"" 24bit. In fact, if they sold a product like this, it would technically be considered fraud and they would be sued out of business. I suggest that you email HDTracks and see what they have to say about upsampling audio tracks from 16bit versions to higher resolutions. I am sure they will enlighten you to the fact that it is not possible. Now, don't get me wrong, if you like your 24bit files better, have at them. But what you are offering the community is extremely misleading. These are not true 24bit files. I have a lot of experience with audio. I have been studying physics and sound for my Masters of Science degree. I suggest you email a qualified audio engineer and ask them about your post-processing methodology. Also, if your post-processing methods truly created 24bit audio files, think about how this would affect the music market. What keeps the rest of the world from taking the very same steps you do to find the true Hi-Fi in any CD? Why would DVD-audio and Blu-ray audio even exist then, when all the info is hidden in a CD? Why would HD-tracks be wasting time tracking down the original masters and re-digitizing them at high sampling and bit rates? Why wouldn't they just go to Best Buy, buy any old CD and upsample it and re-sell it at an inflated price? While, your audio files may sound better to you, I think it is merely the placebo effect in action. Do some blind audio tests with your friends."
,hoarybat,2012-10-09T04:04Z,"This is directly from HDTracks.com. They wasted ""many years of research"" when they could have simply upsampled their CDs like you did. 


ABKCO Music and Records Inc. and HDTracks速 are announcing the first-ever release of high definition digital downloads of The Rolling Stones ground-breaking catalog of studio, compilation and live albums in High-Fidelity FLAC formats offered in both 176.4kHz/24-bit and 88.2kHz/24-bit.

""Many years of research went into locating the original mono and stereo analog tapes that would be used in ABKCO's Rolling Stones Remastered Series. That research revealed a treasure trove of first generation tapes - true stereo masters from The Stones' 1964 Chess Studios sessions including the unedited version of ""2120 South Michigan Avenue,"" Beggar's Banquet at its correct speed and Let It Bleed with splicing that indicates that the original intention was to leave little spacing between each cut.

For the analog to digital transfers, vintage reel-to-reel tape machines were utilized - a modified Ampex 351 with original tube electronics (full track mono and two track stereo) and an Ampex ATR-102 modified with Aria Discrete Class-A Electronics (full track mono and two track stereo). A Sonoma DSD digital audio workstation was the chosen high resolution format and Meitner Design ADC8 and DAC8 MKlV converters were used for the conversion process. Cables used were the cryogenically frozen type supplied to us by Gus Skinas of Super Audio Center. Gus also provided much guidance to Jody Klein, Steve Rosenthal and myself for our first time use of DSD technology. For this HD Tracks release, the Bob Ludwig mastered DSD files were converted to both 176.4kHz and 88.2kHz high resolution PCM with Weiss Saracon conversion software.""

,beavis39,2012-10-09T04:26Z,"Dire Straits - Brothers In Arms, recorded in 1985 in the studio at 16-bit/44.1kHz. Re-released in high definition DVD_Audio (24bit/96kHz lpcm) and SACD. 16-bit/44.1kHz re-released in high definition, exactly what I am doing.

Nobody actually comes in here and gives an opinion based on their listening experience. It's always someone trying to push theory down my throat or just plain not listening at all and giving a review.

My ears don't lie. I meticulously compare my releases to the originals before uploading to ensure I am not uploading something less than the original.

Nothing really more to say until someone wants to give a real review based on their own listening experience."
,hoarybat,2012-10-09T15:44Z,"beavis, it is not ""theory."" What I described is fact. Information is lost when you downsample to 16 bit. If there was some secret source of information locked in a CD, why wouldn't every record in existence be recorded in 8 bit then? Or better yet, 4 bit?  I mean, think of all the time that would be saved. Files would be smaller and could be post-processed in the studio much more quickly. No more expensive elaborate hard drives. 

Rather than upsample your files, why don't you do the opposite. Take a CD, downsample it to 8 bit, and then upsample it back up to your 64bit float and then into a 24bit file. See how that sounds. If your logic is correct, you should have the same ""sounding"" file.I encourage you to do blind listening tests on your own files and let me know how many you select correctly as the better sounding 24bit. Do 100 or more tests, so you have an ample sample size. 

Your process somehow negates the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist-Shannon_sampling_theorem

That's amazing.

By the way, the Dire Straight album was not true 24bit, it was merely upsampled to 24bit so that it could be sold as a DVD-audio disc in 5.1 surround. It is still 16bit audio, but since they were changing media types. This is the reason why HDTracks doesn't sell a 96kHz or higher version of it anymore. It is FAKE 24bit!!!!:

,moschos,2012-10-09T19:33Z,i dont know what you are saying i just downloaded from tools 10000 days one track the vicarious because i own the original and listened to it compared to beavis one. you man really rock.  maybe its just something like filtering but the effect is AMAZING. thank you.
,beavis39,2012-10-10T01:41Z,"Have you ever heard music at 8-bit? If you had I don't think you would be using that as an argument point. It sounds horrible, 16-bits per sample is the absolute minimum needed to call it ""hi-fi"".

It is a know fact there are sounds within a CD that cannot be heard. They are masked by other frequencies. This is how an mp3 works. They are able to remove these frequencies which can't be heard based on a model of the human ear and create a smaller file. Most people can't hear the difference, I unfortunately can. I have never been tricked my an mp3 thinking it was lossless wav.

I never claimed mine was true 24-bit. I mean how can it be, it was sourced from 16-bit. There is no 24-bit version of this one unless you count the horribly noisy vinyl rip. Pretty much all the music I do there is no 24-bit version available. I do not lie, it is right there in black & white ""Original 16-bit/44.1kHz files joined in Wavelab 6"". I make no true 24-bit claims.

All the Nyquist-Shannon theorem states is you must sample at twice the highest frequency to avoid aliasing. This is a bare minimum requirement, to sample at a higher rate does not conflict with the theorem.

All I know is my 24-bit/96kHz versions sound better than the originals. I do not claim to understand the exact science. All I can do is take what I do know about digital audio and mix it with an theories that I might have based on what I hear. Of course you disagree with me because you heard my 24-bit/96kHz version, right??"
,gnubeest,2012-10-16T13:05Z,"FYI, the Brothers in Arms SACD release wasn't just remastered, it was remixed entirely (as are most 5.1 reissues by necessity). Recording multitrack is arguably of little benefit at anything higher than 24/44 unless you're going straight to 2-track; mixing is where you start running into questionable territory, which is why most engineers still mix on analog desks fed into a DAW or 2-track digital recorder at 24/96 and up."
