"Escape From Goochland"

Cleveland and the gang visit their rival high 
school in Goochland for the annual football game, 
but when Federline destroys the car belonging to 
Clevelands arch-nemesis Chet Butler, they must 
find a way to escape their enemys home turf.
Meanwhile, Donna dons a sexy Halloween costume 
that gets her in trouble with the cops, and 
Roberta and Cleveland Jr. play pranks around 
Stoolbend when they dress up as Donna and 
Cleveland.
