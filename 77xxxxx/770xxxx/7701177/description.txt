I've waited a long time to get this thing out there. Media-Blasters went through fire and water to finally get Toho ltd. To release this marvelously awful film, the best of the bad Godzilla movies! All previous torrents are of unauthorized Asian knockoffs; this sucker has been remastered and is a fresh, clean DVD rip. The buzz on the ΓÇÿnet (as of this October 2012 writing) is that the Blu-ray, loaded with extras, will be made available next year. Until then, enjoy a DECENT rip of this magnificent shit-fest! The famous flying drop-kick scene ALONE is worth the download.

Godzilla vs. Megalon is a 1973 Japanese science fiction kaiju film produced by Toho. Directed and co-written by Jun Fukuda with special effects by Teruyoshi Nakano, the film starred Katsuhiko Sasaki, Hiroyuki Kawase, Yutaka Hayashi, and American actor Robert Dunham. It was the thirteenth film in the Godzilla franchise. Heavily influenced by the tokusatsu superhero TV shows of the time, the film had Godzilla essentially acting as a costar to a huge robotic superhero character called Jet Jaguar.

The film was released theatrically in the United States in the summer of 1976 by Cinema Shares. Afterwards it became the only Godzilla film to receive a television premiere on a major U.S network, as NBC aired it on prime time television in the summer of 1977, where it was hosted by actor John Belushi dressed in a Godzilla costume.
