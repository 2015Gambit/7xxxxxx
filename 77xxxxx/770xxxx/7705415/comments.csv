,Crim2k8,2012-10-08T05:38Z,"Uh... MP4SUX has been sorta trusted for a while now, tattooguy21.

Who are you, exactly?"
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-08T05:58Z,"The discerning viewer will note that some people like to jump the gun. At this very moment there are 1399 people who will shortly know the truth.

Not to mention my sterling reputation.

Well, there is ONE group who don't like me very much, but they claim quality and then put out crap.

And that is the whole of the reason I'm here doing what I do."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-08T06:53Z,"Correcting a slight mistake ... call it a LOL encode when it's really EVOLVE who is trusted enough by me to post unchecked.

You may notice that with the exception of this type - I won't be posting any LOL CC2AVI anymore as I have to check - and the time it takes to check is the time to properly encode it in glorious XVID.

This one's so popular I think I might do an XVID encode of this.

This has been downloaded and is indeed legit. Quality...I dunno A10 V9 or 10. Looks pretty damn good to me. @MP4SUX thank you for taking the time to upload this. @tattooguy21 fuck your face."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-08T07:14Z,"Rocker4prez:

It truly warms the cockles of my heart to think I can inspire someone to do something - even if indirectluy.

I wouldn't worry about tattooguy21 and his ilk. I've now posted a couple hundred torrents n a little over three months and I get a guy like this about once a month.

Clearly not a major assault.

Thanks for sticking up for me and pushing the bully.

I have to re-convert it again to get it to play, which kinda defeats the purpose of downloading an AVI release in the first place. Could've as easily downloaded the ettv version and converted it, and likely faster too."
,angkst,2012-10-08T11:32Z,yep doesn't work on my divx home theatre system either. unsupported file type. works fine on my computer though. cheers for the up anyway! :)

thanks for wasting my time morrons"
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-08T22:04Z,"Wow, two ranters for one popular post. Hundreds of happy campers and two turds in the punchbowl. sigh ...

For those with the standalone player problem, all I can say is you need to look for ""XVID"", not ""AVI"" (which I'v since uploaded).

CC2AVI takes me about three minutes to create (anyone can do this - see some of my early posts for directions or ask) and XVID more than half an hour.

The good news is (aside from my mis-labeling this file) that because LOL is so reckless with their quality I now have to watch it before I'm going to put my moniker on it anymore. the 666 park avenue was damaged and that's why no AVI from me on that until a WEB-DL shows up.

The good news is that while I'm taking time to watch for quality - that gives me time to encode true XVID.

But with quality cappers 2HD, ASAP (mostly) and especially EVOLVE (wonderful) among others - I can trust them and therefore get a CC2AVI out quickly with some confidence.

Still in discovery phase (only been doing this for a few months now) and maybe in the long run I'll take the time and only do XVID - but far fewer of them.

Time will tell.

,halofubar,2012-10-10T02:45Z,"My main point in posting was to verify that yes, this is real. I hate when people shout fake... those people need a punch in the gut. The standalone player thing was just an FYI for others who might expect it would work. Generally most ""xvid"" encodings do work, which is why I and others might've expected otherwise. Luckily the SUPER@ MEncoder engine is quick on the draw to fix, since watching MKV and MP4 releases on a PC gets old (and there's nothing wrong with properly encoded AVI files).

No harm intended."
