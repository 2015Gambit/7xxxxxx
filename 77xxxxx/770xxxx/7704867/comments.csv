,georgecis,2012-10-08T18:34Z,"Jan.H, u're such a hypocrite... I never said that it's the uploader's fault or that iI'm not grateful to him for the game. JUST that there are some problems (probably with the crack from skidrow or with the game itself)...
Wanna take a bet?... If u get to the parts I've specified and u don't get any error, I'll kiss ur arse, if not, u'll kiss mine... Deal? U can try anything you want, except other crack from Skidrow or others... :)"

So instead of using your mouth, why not try to help, or don't say anything! TWAT"
,Miriam123,2012-10-09T17:40Z,"Hey. I don't know if other people have it but i'm getting graphic bugs when trying the game out. The intro is fine, but... You start outside of the house with a blue background and whenever you try to move, the character gets stuck in the walls. Crack is working fine and all. I have no clue what caused it. It might just be my computer tho... Oo "

,GigoloAunt111,2012-10-15T15:48Z,"Was having the crash on day 2 (like most others) even with the update v1.0.0.2. For me, I got around the problem by dropping my graphics settings all to minimum, no AA, no AF, no bloom etc. Once I got past the 'crash spot' I changed graphics back up to maximum ...all good :)
Try it, it may work 4 u 2!"
,wizzard.new,2012-10-15T21:18Z,good game i like it thanks for upload 
,biteme1011,2012-10-18T00:26Z,"Dramat you should download and play this game whether or not you think your pc can handle it because even on minimum settings, with AA and AF etc. off the game still looks really good!"

,GenAwesome,2012-11-04T19:44Z,"I had the same crash issue on day 2, but i fixed it by simply going to the nephew first, than the jail, and then to the graveyard. there is no need for crack fix, just follow this order."
,Brioli,2012-11-04T19:50Z,"Having the same problem as the others with Sherlock Holmes-The Testament. I've applied the 1.0.0.2 update and lowered all graphic settings to try and get past the Westgate Jail part to no avail. I noticed some said the patch fixed this for them, but it didn't work for me.

Hoping you have a fix for this soon or am I missing one? Thanks for all your hard work."
,Will.Killin,2012-11-05T06:49Z,"everytime i install it, it says game.pak is corrupted, and if i choose ignore it installs just fine, but when i click the game nothing happens. and when I install the patch the game splash screen pops up then it crashes again, i have had the same corruption problems with assassins creed revelations, darksiders 2, and also dead rising off the record and dead island. in my torrent program (tixati) i check the integrity and they all said 100% anyone know whats going on here? most importantly, does anyone else have the same corruption problem for this particular game?"
,Brioli,2012-11-05T14:08Z,ok...my bad...just realized I had to copy the new crack from the v1.0.0.2 update files to the Program Files>Focus>Frogwares>The Testament of Sherlock Holmes folder. Now it works...so for those who can't get it to work after the update...be sure to copy the new SKIDROW files in the update folder and overwrite the old crack. Great game again SKIDROW..thank you
,Brioli,2012-11-05T14:09Z,Oh and update/patch totally fixes crash before Westgate Prison and after the Gardens...awesome game!
,nraek07,2012-11-20T14:52Z,"i keep getting the actcontrol software activation service.. 
how do i fix this?.
sorry newbie gamer here..
thanks"
,penelope13,2012-11-24T08:37Z,"Thank you very much for this great game!

This torrent works perfectly, if you also install the 1.0.0.2.Update.

To nraek07: Don't worry about the 'actcontrol software activation service'. Just close that window, and apply the 1.0.0.2.Update. Everything should be fine after that.
