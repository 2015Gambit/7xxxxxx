CivCity: Rome is a city building strategy game by Firefly Studios and Firaxis. As a collaboration between Firefly Studios and Firaxis Games, the game invites players to shift focus from building a multi-city empire and zoom-in on the great cities of the Roman Empire, culminating in Rome itself. It includes elements from two well-known game series, Caesar (primarily) and Civilization, giving players the opportunity to build, run and maintain various cities of the Roman Empire.
The player is charged with building, nurturing and managing one of the great cities of Rome as they endeavour to lead the Roman Empire from its humble beginnings to its mighty zenith. As with most city building games, making sure each neighborhood has access to all the commodities it needs is the primary challenge. The different kinds of items required by the most advanced households will require the player to fit a wide variety of shops and services into a very compact area.
