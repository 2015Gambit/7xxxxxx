Only the last 1.5 minutes actually shows factual information."
,elex123,2012-10-29T13:57Z,"respect for Julian Assange he just tried to reveal truth but it was not acceptable to govenment and law so why care about such laws who try to hide the truth from citizens
any ways the movie could have been in more detail it only shows most of his teen life as hacker in 1989 but nice one must see this
