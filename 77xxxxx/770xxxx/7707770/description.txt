Personal Note (from aksman)

 With my vinyl transfers, I try to catch the whole beauty of vinyl records; therefore I don't use any post-
 processing or any sound improvement. What you get is a clear and flat transfer. For getting a clear sound, I'll do
 an extended washing of each record with my RCM, which can take up to 30 minutes brushing on each side. Resistant
 ticks and clicks I try to remove as good as possible, but the priority is not to lose any musical information in the
 process. Surface noises, as long they are not too high, are left in place. Only on bad pressings or on records
 recorded at extremely low levels do I use a fade in-/-out. As John Peel said, "Life is full of surface noises." In
 some cases this means that I have to make a compromise.... The result has to pass my personal quality criteria,
 which is IMO quite high.
