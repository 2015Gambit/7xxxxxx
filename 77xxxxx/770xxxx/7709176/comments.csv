,mrnow76,2012-10-09T07:02Z,"TV team is spoon feeding the upload, by not allowing peers to connect to seeders directly. They always do that with new torrents."
,kevx74,2012-10-09T07:37Z,"Can't say if they always do it, mrnow76, but it is seeming like it on this one- 2.6% complete; Down speed 2.5 kb/s; up speed 90kb/s; ratio 2.283(and climbing) eta 3w2d added 42 min ago. Nice."
,kevx74,2012-10-09T07:39Z,"I know I'll have when I wake up, but was hoping to get before I lay down, ah well."
,bladesama,2012-10-09T07:46Z,"0  people seeding, hence no download speed.. what a joke, selfish kunts"
,pottermouth,2012-10-09T09:03Z,been trying to give TvTeam a chance lately to be honest but everytime i've downloaded a torrent i've ended up deleting it long before its finished so won't bother with this all though i'm desperate to see it i'll wait till the scene4all appears
