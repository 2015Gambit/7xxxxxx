,KuromiBun,2012-10-09T00:42Z,"Has anyone been having trouble with extensions lately with torrents from eztv? The file format becomes ""X264-EVOLVE File (.x264-EVOLVE)"" and I have to add "".mp4"" to fix it. This was not happening a month ago, and I didn't change any settings. Running uTorrent and Win7 64-Bit Ultimate (fresh install two weeks ago though problem started on old install). K-Lite Codec pack installed as well.

Anyone else having this problem?"
,jackson5more,2012-10-09T20:25Z,@kuromibun - Win7 default settings in 'cntrlpnl/folders' is to 'Hide extensions of known file types'.  Get rid of this and you might see that the files were always correct. This setting is for no0bs imo
,KuromiBun,2012-10-10T22:06Z,@jackson5more- Was actually the first thing I tried. Same result. I have had it both showing the extensions and hiding the extensions. Gonna check to see if maybe its something wrong with the torrent client. Thanks for the good suggestion though!
,NoMoreAVI,2012-10-11T17:51Z,Losing file types in single file torrents is a uTorrent 3.2 feature.
