     dir to your DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club dir.
     (%USERPROFILE%DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club).
  4. Copy over the cracked content, ie. the rest of the files, from the Crack
     dir to your installation dir.
  5. Play the game offline. Make sure that all the games exe files are blocked
     from going online by using your system or third party firewall to prevent

     game. Going online and using your own profile might be possible, but it
     is at your own risk.
