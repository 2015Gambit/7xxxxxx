Diablo: Hellfire:

In 1997, after the mega-selling game Diablo, Sierra Studios released the only autorized expansion pack for it, called Hellfire. Hellfire expanded on parts of the game people wanted more of the most; a new Monk character class, (several others were also included but not visible without a special file), new enemies, new bosses, new weapons, spells, and more. It gave those tired with beating Diablo a brand new challenge to fight. The Hive was the scene of the new battles. With brand new rare items and new spells, the game of Diablo would never be the same again.
