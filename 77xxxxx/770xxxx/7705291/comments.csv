,swoodruff,2012-10-08T06:43Z,MP4 FILES ARE NOT PASSWORD PROTECTED. IGNORE THESE DUMBASSES. I'm watching the video as we speak
,fx101,2012-10-08T06:52Z,"People... it's an .mp4 file. It's not password protected. Everyone that claims otherwise is a malignant 13 year old troll that thinks he's funny.

In fact, the episode plays perfectly."

,omgwtfnoob,2012-10-08T07:09Z,@953kGT any halfwit can click 'files' to see it is an mp4 and not rar.... go quit your job of trying to stop pirating because you're not fooling anyone.

,Flegit,2012-10-08T07:54Z,"I'm downloading an mp4 file, not an archive, and it's not password protected."
,dudelove420,2012-10-08T07:59Z,"Looking at the screen shots now and your work is always good ETTV. I appreciate it and I already downloaded the other Dexter episode 2 file on here that is 1 gb from sectpb and it is all jumpy, it is not as good as your files are. Should of just came through you as always, Thanks dude!"
,Gonzotabb,2012-10-08T08:43Z,"I just want to say that these comments about password protected .rar files are not fake. I came on right after the show aired and downloaded this file and got one of those password protected .rar's. So I moved the file to a different spot on my HDD and deleted the .torrent info so I could download it again after seeing all the comments. When I added it to utorrent and it downloaded the metadata it only showed the .mp4 file, not .rar, so idk what the fuck was going on but its fine now."
,ir2wicked,2012-10-08T09:58Z,LMAO @ all the people saying this is password protected and stuff! Looks like it's time to get your PC serviced cause there is something wrong with it. Either that or you just don't know what you're doing. Best to leave these things to the grown-ups kid o's.
,7210418,2012-10-08T10:41Z,you guys on all these forums are so emotional .. god damn!  .. sounds like this person had an .rar file that was password protected first and now it's a .mp4 file for an episode of dexter! relax and enjoy the show : )  ... you're doing something illegal by downloading : p you'll have some speed bumps fools 
,tommyfingers,2012-10-08T15:21Z,FUCK those suckers posting FAKE PW'd RARs..i DL 3 Fake DEX's...ETTV...Solid..Trustworthy...
