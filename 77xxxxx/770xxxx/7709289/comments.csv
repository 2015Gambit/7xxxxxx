As you seem very creator-focused in your collecting (inferred from your uploads), I'm wondering if you have scanned Guy Davis' The Marquis.  I've only found one issue (Danse Macabre #1) online, but would love to read the rest.

Finally, I'm curious as to why you don't erase ""Obi's"" horrific logo from the front the cover of many turn-of-the-millenium comics.  While he has posted a number of great series, his scans are often skewed, and that logo is just....

I actually use inPaint Pro to remove logos, Seashore/GIMP to rotate any skewed pages, and Photoshop to otherwise ""restore"" imperfect scans.

Thanks again for your all your efforts and generosity."

[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-09T21:51Z,"Thanks for the kind words whaletail935 and Proteus11, and you're most welcome.

I too only have one issue of that series. That being, 'The Marquis - A Sin Of One'. I'll probably wait to upload it until I have a bit more to offer.

whaletail935, I'm interested in how you remove a scanner tag like that, and how long it takes? Does it leave a discernible mark where it's been removed, and if not does it take more than (literally) a minute or so to remove? 

I love making some of these books look better, but there is a point where the time and effort involved in making the changes becomes counterproductive. 

I have somewhere around 175,000 comic books available for upload (and close to an unlimited number beyond that if I don't have a particular title on the a hard drive already), so there is definitely a point when it becomes more interesting and rewarding (for me, on a personal level) to just share the books, rather than geek out for hours making small corrections (which I have been known to do).

Don't get me wrong, though, as much as I appreciate the efforts of ALL of the original scanners, I hate tag logos and tag pages as much as the next guy. But in the end it's something I can live with if I feel the rest of the books looks good."

Heh. Glad to help."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-11T02:32Z,"OK, so, don't go to the included link for the Suprbay (the thread is no longer there). Sometimes things just don't work out the way you intended, and this was one of them."
,whaletail935,2012-10-11T05:32Z,"I actually use a small OS X app called inPaint Pro, as I'm only learning Photoshop. InPaint has almost no learning curve, but its utility is pretty awesome.  With scans that I cherish, I go the distance, creating  panel frames where necessary, removing the ""midline"" and shadowing on splash pages.

However, I always erase overly conspicuous logos.  It can take a few seconds or a bit longer if I get stupidly OCD about it (as it can be ""fun"" to blow a cover up via InPaint and literally fill in a logo with a pixel tolerance of perhaps 5).

By the way, it all got a lot easier with Cursorsense (free until 12/01), which allows you to independently set cursor acceleration & speed for values.  This makes any sort of digital painting MUCH easier (slowing that cursor down helps tremendously).

If you'd like, I can email you a before/after sample to show you the range of ""restorative possibilities"".  

Needless to say, for my favorite books, I'll put the time in as necessary.  I'll check the page angles with Pixelstick, a virtual protractor, and correct them to the 1/100th degree via Seashore/GIMP.  I'll really try to erase logos carefully, and increase contrast as necessary via Apple's basic editor, Preview."
