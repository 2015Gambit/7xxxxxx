,watcheroo,2012-11-13T20:14Z,"Noobie here.  Never installed Windows before, installed yours 2 days ago, smooth as silk. Fastest, seemingly most stable Windows I have ever used.  However, extremely puzzled, NO wireless icon, doesn't show up anywhere including in networking or on task bar.  Kinda desperate.  I actually reinstalled your Windows to try to get it back, no luck.  I then used Revo to uninstall all net frameworks, and installed them from fresh downloads.  Still works great, but still, NO WIRELESS icon.  I have a Thinkpad X22, (Lenovo. old, but still good). It had the wireless icon previously and it worked.  No clue what's wrong now.  Help would be appreciated.  Otherwise, a fabulous Windows instal experience. I will never pay a technician 50 bucks again to do this!  Thank you!"
,watcheroo,2012-11-13T20:40Z,"P.S.  If anyone can help... re Windows XP Pro on Lenovo Thinkpad X22 -- this machine has 2 USB ports, back and right side.  Both used to recognize external drive (i.e., thinkpad 18GB drive in enclosure, plugged into back port or side port).  However, back port not working at all (since prior to new Windows install) and side port only sees flash drives.  I need both ports to be able to recognize any drive in external enclosure, AND my red Hitachi mini drive (250GB).  The red Hitachi CLICKS when I plug it into side port, and is not recognized.  Any help will be very much appreciated, I am clueless, but willing to learn.  Thank you."
