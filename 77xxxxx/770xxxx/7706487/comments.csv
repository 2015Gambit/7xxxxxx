,SeaBunnie,2012-10-13T10:38Z,"The Anonymous Download link has a virus that was detected and stopped by my Avast av.  Not sure who the Anonymous Download has come from, but I do know that SaM always has great torrents with no viruses.  I'm still struggling to use the magnets even with the most current download client when checking for updates on my Utorrent.  Will look into this torrent client upgrade further, but just wanted to alert those that the Anonymous Download whomever or wherever it is coming from is infected.  This is NO reflection on SaM's uploads, as he is one of the few I trust and will only download from, here."
