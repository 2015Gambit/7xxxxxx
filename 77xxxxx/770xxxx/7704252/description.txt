MOVE or the MOVE Organization is a Philadelphia based
black liberation group founded by John Africa.

The group lives communally and frequently engages in public
demonstrations related to several issues.


In 1985, Philadelphia police dropped a C4 bomb on their house
from a helicopter in an attempt to end an armed standoff.


The explosion ignited a fire in which 11 people died, including
five children and the group's leader, John Africa.
Only two occupants survived, Ramona, an adult and Birdie, a child.

60 homes were destroyed as the entire block burned and police and
fire crews did nothing.

Nine MOVE members have been in prison for 34 years for the alleged
firing of ONE bullet.
