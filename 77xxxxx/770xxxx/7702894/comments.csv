,WubHD,2012-10-07T07:47Z,Thank you very much! Been looking for a Jtag rip torrent forever.
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-07T08:54Z,This is a heads up for you who decide on using the modded xex. I just got to the mission where you have to kill the two brothers and because of the zero gravity on the A.I. The game freezes at the beginning of that level. I recommend not using the modded xex at this time in the game or not at all.

,snajam,2012-10-08T18:31Z,Why is the size so small? Does it work fine? Can anybody confirm?
,WubHD,2012-10-09T00:58Z,"@snajam The size is small because the $systemupdate folder is removed, that folder is not needed to run on a Jtag/RGH. If you're burning it and running the game via flashed optical drive you will need to find the ntsc/pal/region free version, this is only for Jtags/RGH. "
,MaryEM,2012-10-09T03:49Z,"Downloaded and works great.
Everything this guy uploads works.
Thanks for another great game!!!"
,amorym60,2012-10-09T10:52Z,would someone please tell me how to get it on my xbox using usb evry time i converted into iso  iso2god cant read it please help 
,snajam,2012-10-09T11:05Z,@WubHD Thanks man. I didn't know the System Update Folder is of over 4 GB or something. I usually delete it too after using XBC to open the .iso  and then just put it in my sexbox. Thanks!
,miki12345ize,2012-10-09T23:55Z,"Can I play the game without the mods (because I hate mods) ??????  I know it should go-but just to be shure ????

Anyway I'm looking forward for more of your games (for 360)!!!!"
,ryunax14,2012-10-10T03:14Z,Ilove your torrents! Please upload more jtag rips games like Xcom please and incoming games like Assasins creed 3 thanks
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-10T06:33Z, @miki12345ize The xex Mod is in it's own file so no worries.
