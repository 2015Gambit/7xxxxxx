According to the 2010 census, the number of American Hispanics grew 43% in the last decade to over 50 million. By 2050, Hispanics are projected to number 132 million and represent 30% of the population. As that population evolves, so does their political power. A new report by the Pew Hispanic Center shows that since 2008, America’s Hispanic voting population has grown 22% since 2008. But what are the cultural and political implications of these now well-understood statistics?

Bill goes beyond the numbers with two of our nation’s most popular and influential journalists: Univision’s Jorge Ramos and María Elena Salinas. A Spanish-language U.S. television network, Univision has the largest audience of Spanish-language television viewers, according to Nielsen ratings.

Ramos, says The Washington Monthly, is ”the broadcaster who will most determine the 2012 elections,” while The New York Times calls Salinas “the voice of Hispanic America.” In a candid and comprehensive discussion, Ramos and Salinas discuss their responsibilities both as reporters and representatives of their culture, their aggressive journalistic approaches to both President Obama and Governor Romney, and how immigration reform will influence this potentially-decisive voting bloc in November.

Also on the show, Bill shares the story of a young U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan and the Republican congressman he inspired to ask, “Why are we killing kids that don’t need to die?”
