                Real Mixing Training For Real People

REthink Mixing is the ultimate mixing tutorial for real home and project studio owners like you. Why? Because you get to watch me mix tracks that were recorded with home studio equipment in some guyΓÇÖs basement. Not a slick basement studio, just your regular old basement!

Over the course of 8 in-depth videos, youΓÇÖll watch as we transform these raw (and in some cases rough) tracks into a punchy, clear, and professional sounding mix that you can be proud of. I literally mix the entire song in front of your eyes, with no further tweaking happening in between videos or behind the scenes. Nothing is held back as I invite you into my personal mixing workflow!
Your Blueprint For Mixing Like A Pro

If your mixes arenΓÇÖt quite where you want them to be, you owe it to yourself to check out REthink Mixing. IΓÇÖve literally crammed over 10 years of experience into one convenient and affordable package for folks like you. IΓÇÖm totally stoked about this series and it has been a long time coming. Check it out and start making better mixes now!
