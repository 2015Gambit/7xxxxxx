Rather than just own up to President Obama’s piss-poor performance, Funt (the guy Good Life told me was a “conservative”) is blaming something external. It was the moderator. It was the format. It was the questions. How pathetic. I owned Bush’s gawd-awful performance in 2004. What else could I do? He was unprepared. He was hunched over leaning on the podium. He looked and sounded like a country bumpkin. Obama was even worse last night and Funt’s looking for some way to excuse him just like the rest of the media’s been doing for five years.

President Obama was finally forced to defend his RECORD in a forum where no one could run interference for him. He tried to take control of the debate when he said, “We’re not looking back but forward to the future.” No, Mr. President. That’s just wrong. The past is your record. You created it. You own it and we’re going to rub your face in it.

Mitt Romney should have said, “Mr. President. I can promise you this. Should I be elected president, I won’t spend my first four years blaming my predecessor for the mess I inherited.” A great follow-on quip would be, “Should you be re-elected, do you have any idea how bad the mess you’ll inherit is? Who are you going to blame in your second term?”."
