Set in urban Auckland (New Zealand) this movie tells the story
of the Heke family. Jake Heke is a violent man who beats his
wife frequently when drunk, and yet obviously loves both her
and his family. The movie follows a period of several weeks in
the family's life showing Jake's frequent outburst of violence
and the effect that this has on his family. The youngest son is
in trouble with the police and may be put into a foster home
while the elder son is about to join a street gang. Jake's
daughter has her own serious problems which are a key element
in the plot...
