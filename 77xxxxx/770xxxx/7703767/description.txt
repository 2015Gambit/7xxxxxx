The J. Geils Band is an American rock band formed in 1967 in Worcester, Massachusetts. 
They have been described as the best white American blues based band of all time. 
They are best known for their 1981 single, "Centerfold" which charted #1 in the U.S. in early 1982. 
The band played R&B-influenced blues-rock in the 1970s before moving towards a more pop-influenced sound in the 1980s. 
Since its initial break-up in 1985, the band has reunited several times.
This Discography does not include the 1984 Your Getting Even While I'm Getting Odd (No Peter Wolf)
