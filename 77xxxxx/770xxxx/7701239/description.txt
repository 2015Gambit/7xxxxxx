Notes: Many thanks to HP for sharing his stuff ....thank you
Right the video was nice but is a small res again and had whacked AR.Also the video
had alot of glare to it,slight angle and slightly cropped
Audio was decent cam audio but needed some life adding to it

Took the video and used the perspective filter to pull the sides,top and bottom ....
only a little but made it better.From there i upscaled and reiszed to a better AR....
then it was a case of dulling the glares,adding some more contrast for a better black
and then tweak the colours slightly
Audio we stripped then cleaned in AA changing several on the EQ bands and giving it
some more life and increasing the bass,before
re-adding back to our encode

Enjoy folks and sorry its late along with some others we have lined up ...but sometimes
real work gets in the way
