This release is meant for our sites, its ops and users, and those who request it. We've labeled it internal because the DRM is bypassed using a loader. The game works, but it's not how we would usually release a crack. A more proper way of cracking it exists, but would take extra time. The rules we follow also do not allow for loaders of this kind to be released, and it seems unlikely that new rules will come.
