,wivov,2012-10-08T11:14Z,may i ask what is the real final windows 8? killerg4 says its its not the final.
,patrick3876,2012-10-09T02:37Z,"@wivov - rtm is final, it's the version going to the manufacturers and to retail stores."
,wivov,2012-10-10T08:06Z,@patrick3876 - sorry for my ignorance! KillerG4 comment confused me. hehehehe... thanks again!
,tonycap44,2012-10-12T11:58Z,"I installed the 64-bit one, used the first serial number, then downloaded an activator from another torrent, and it worked.  Seems to be the final product, build 9200."
,tonycap44,2012-10-12T14:20Z,"Another note: I installed the updates that it had and it deactivated, but I was able to reactivate it. RTM means release to manufacturing. Now just have to see if it will stay activated."
,wivov,2012-10-13T23:47Z,@tonycap44 - may i ask where did you download the windows 8 activator? thanks!
,tonycap44,2012-10-14T21:50Z,"I had downloaded this version, but I couldn't get it to work and is not bootable. I used the activator from this one.

But I see many other activators coming out here."
,flyster93,2012-10-20T20:06Z,"i wanna know, it is multilanguaje? 'cause i am spanish.."
,xgman1,2012-10-23T16:31Z,"So if it deactivates, just run the activator again after updates??"
,xgman1,2012-10-24T01:34Z,"the korean activator leaves you locked out of custom user icon, lock screen etc. They are greyed out in settings."
,tonycap44,2012-10-25T15:17Z,"Yes that's the only problem, the lock screen and start screen are unusable after you set them first time. This may not be a real final version. Everything seems right except the help section says ""what's new in release preview"". Don't worry, windows 8 gets tomorrow. I'm sure you'll get the real version here soon."
