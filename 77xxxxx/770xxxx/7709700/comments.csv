,Mlleyr,2012-10-09T10:43Z,Dunno. Only started to download. 
,ToeTags,2012-10-09T10:43Z,"So, does it work?"
,halestarr,2012-10-09T10:54Z,Can anyone tell me if it's a steam version or not ?!
,perablenta,2012-10-09T10:54Z,"Guys, First, game DOESN'T work on XP, Second, it's requires 20GB not 7GB. This is fake."
,perablenta,2012-10-09T10:56Z,"Guys, First, it requires 20 GB not 7, and it doesn't work on XP."
,Mlleyr,2012-10-09T11:04Z,5 hours till download complete. (
,Darth_Revan0811,2012-10-09T11:06Z,Well there's nothing on rlslog yet so we'll have to wait until more people are finished downloading.
,Darth_Revan0811,2012-10-09T11:10Z,"yeah that guy is right this doesn't work on xp, rad this on thexcom forum. So I'll be switching to the other torrent."
,The4X3R,2012-10-09T11:13Z,t3h w8 is 0v3r
,DodgyShoeLace,2012-10-09T11:25Z,is 13GB normal? i have checked this guys torrents most of them seem legit! so hope this works! downloading
,DodgyShoeLace,2012-10-09T11:46Z,well this guys uploads are mostly legit so only one way to check!
,ToeTags,2012-10-09T11:52Z,Aaaand we lost 150 seeders in 5 min. Can someone at least give us some feedback?
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-10-09T11:58Z,the crack is most likely not going to work of this 3dm release so just download this i will upload a scene crack when they release it 
,jjkfromuk,2012-10-09T12:13Z,Any idea if the Elite Soldier Pack is included in the download?
,OmniNegro,2012-10-09T12:13Z,"Sigh. Jackasses pretending this is fake because the game supposedly requires 20GB... Do you not realize that this is a rar archive? Until your download completes and you not only extract it, but also install it, you do not fucking know what size it is.

Keep your pants on. The sky is not falling.

Ignore system requirements. They mean little or nothing at all. I bought Guild Wars 2 and it said it required 20GB space. However it is currently sitting pretty at 14.3GB. So disregard shit that means nothing."
,SoulmASter153241,2012-10-09T12:20Z,More seeders pls :(
,fatman12,2012-10-09T13:02Z,thank you Gh0stNet!
,koryagame,2012-10-09T13:10Z,"funny thing is on disc everything is compressed to fit onto the medium 13 Gig is within dual layer DVD support 20 Gig isn't, and the amount of compression that can be done on images and audio is kinda impressive, so the chances of this being fake seem's small. ither way this game is on my wish list this year. 

also a side note support the company's that make the software and games you love i know i will"
,Afinfas,2012-10-09T13:16Z,"@Indianola
Why do you say that doenst have crack? On the discription it says clearly.
""UNRAR, copy CRACK and PLAY"".
Would be great to have some feedback from someone who has already downloaded this cause...its 12GB! Which is quite surprising. 12GB for this game??? SKyrim its half that and has an almost unlimited world...dont really get it but, i give the benefit of doubt.
I think i will wait a couple of days to make sure but, thanks anyway for the upload, on the day that its released! Thats fantastic! :D
Cheers.."
,m00nunit,2012-10-09T13:18Z,"I doubt this will work at all. Just finished the download. The files are comprized of a the local files from a steam download, aka, the orgiginal seeder has just rar'ed the steam folder on his machine. I've transferring the files from my seedbox now, but I highly doubt it will work.

So in other words, it's NOT a fake, as in, it's the actual game, but playable... not very likely"
,m00nunit,2012-10-09T13:20Z,"And just to confirm, there is *no* crack file in this torrent! So that part is def not accurate"
,In_Da_Club,2012-10-09T13:28Z,well the demo was like little below 6GB so 12 aint much a surprise...
,fatman12,2012-10-09T13:29Z,"like Gh0stNet said on the last page wait for the 3dm crack to get released then im sure you will find it uploaded somewhere on tpb. 

Trust the pink skullz"
,slikutis,2012-10-09T13:39Z,"Once the FULL UNLOCKED version finishes downloading for me i'll won't be seeding this, so...yeah."
,wizardelo,2012-10-09T14:07Z,"i finished, there is no crack in it, not even a installer, game is rar packed from the installed directory and thats it, and there exe file that should start the game does nothing :)
...we stil need a crack"
,m00nunit,2012-10-09T14:31Z,"@Gh0stNet, thanks for the effort in trying to share this. It is a legit copy, but since it's a steam folder recursive copy it will not work.

There is *no crack* inside the torrent download and the executable files does not launch the game.

I've disabled my seeding of it since it does not provide a working copy of the game.

Every should either a) wait for scene release or b) buy the game of steam or in stores on friday.

I've pre-ordered my own copy and just wanted a sneak peak as I really disapprove of the whole game launch strategy of this game.

As always, if you like a game, always buy it, it's what makes more games copy out.

So chill out till friday or wait for another release, this isn't it!"
,spiralarchitect,2012-10-09T14:34Z,"@slikutis 

The ""Full Unlocked version"" is not unlocked, and doesn't even have a crack...so...yeah...

keep seeding.."
,In_Da_Club,2012-10-09T14:44Z,"While i have no doubt that crack will be released asap, it should be stated in game description that there is no CRACK yet what so ever in this release, its not good to lose the trust in trusted uploaders. "
,Ether_Man,2012-10-09T14:58Z,"Crack or not, it's so slow because of the people capping at 1kbps upload that by the time it's actually downloaded, the crack will have been out for days anyway. Kudos to the ones that have been lucky enough to get enough pieces from people not doing such caps but wow there's a lot of people doing it in this and the ""unlocked"" torrent as well..."
,OmniNegro,2012-10-09T15:02Z,"Just a word of warning to the newbies that would be fooled. Do not trust the keygen bastards that spam these comments. They have nothing to offer but malware. They usually offer something either for sale that does nothing, or they offer it for free and it is malware either way.

You will *NEVER* get a free key for a game. Period. Keep watching TPB and you will get a crack and need not worry about keys."
,slikutis,2012-10-09T15:40Z,"@spiralarchitect everybody knows there is no crack, unlocked version is not a direct copy from steam and has DLC, thats all."
,jjkfromuk,2012-10-09T15:52Z,So whats the difference between this and the unlocked version?
,MAA11792,2012-10-09T17:31Z,"This is a great game that have taken FirAxis years to accomplish, make sure to buy it instead of this.. it surely is worth your money and honour! I bought the ""Special Edition"" only for the music! xD"
,tflagger997,2012-10-09T17:41Z,"The ""unlocked"" version is a Skidrow release.  They always put out a Steam version first and then try to get the crack out for it ASAP.  The problem is when they claim things like ""FULL UNLOCKED"" which would mean that it is cracked or comes with a crack.  They promised the same thing with Diablo III and it never came, for a good reason.

According to the reports above, this torrent is dead.  It will never work.  It does not install to the registry, so the game will not operate on your system.

The ""FULL UNLOCKED"" version will *probably* work once the crack is released.  Until then, we cannot be 100% sure."
,4331a,2012-10-09T17:43Z,They are the same.
,OmniNegro,2012-10-09T18:52Z,"How is it possible for two releases with different sizes to be the same contents? Different archival methods is possible, but this says Multi9 where the other says Multi7. So I would wager either the 9 is incorrect, the 7 is incorrect or even both are incorrect."
,Ether_Man,2012-10-09T19:33Z,"Neither of them is Multi anything because neither is coming from a DVD. They are both packed archives of a Steam downloads. There are tiny variations in the unpacked archives so if you have one or the other, dont bother with the other because the diffrences, are just things like one still has the installscript (which isnt really used after this), left in the folder and stuff like that."
,4331a,2012-10-09T19:41Z,The unarchived game files are the same size in both torrents.
,Militance,2012-10-09T19:54Z,"honestly... stop capping your uploading, it doesnt make your download faster...it just goes to show how greedy and selfcentered you all are motherfuckers"
,Dorrsk81,2012-10-09T20:04Z,"Well, I hopped on this one when it only had 6 seeders, before the other one existed, and I'm still only up to 67% completed, so I'm curious how so many people can be talking about files they don't have downloaded yet."
,OmniNegro,2012-10-09T20:05Z,Thank you to Ether_Man and 4331a for the details on the differences. That will hopefully save people much trouble.
,Ether_Man,2012-10-09T20:18Z,"Dorrsk81, because some of us happen to get lucky breaks at times. Just wait and you'll eventually get slots with those of us that doesnt cap our upload to 1kbps and you'll be finished in no time :)
Or if you're impatient and have a REALLY good connection, you can increase the number of active connections for each torrent so you try more peers at a time. This will however increase your overhead data which means your maximum speed will go down and anything else you do, will likely go down the dumps."
,MAA11792,2012-10-09T20:53Z,I keep my computer on 24/7.. not all of us are greedy.
,Kamadas,2012-10-09T21:36Z,whats the point? its not cracked...
,Ether_Man,2012-10-09T21:46Z,"If your need to share that information MAA came from the complaints about 1kbps caps...  Then do us all a favour and just turn off uploading completely. Because 1kbps 24/7, is worse than nothing at all because all you're doing, is making people waste their connection slots. That goes for everyone doing it... Even if you think you're being good by having it seed forever to compensate for only giving it 1kbps, it's NOT helpful."
,In_Da_Club,2012-10-09T21:50Z,lol i am not sure why everyone is in such a hurry downloading this... ---> there is no crack 
,Kamadas,2012-10-09T22:21Z,same here in_da_club and prolly wont be...
,Ether_Man,2012-10-09T23:58Z,prolly wont be a crack? Based on what? This isnt like D3 where the game is hosted online. There's not even a requirement to be online at all. There's no logical reason to believe there wont be any crack
,Kamadas,2012-10-10T00:23Z,I meant for this version. I might be wrong though.
,jmcc84,2012-10-10T00:55Z,this is cracked?
,Ether_Man,2012-10-10T01:14Z,"Even if we assume that is the case Kamadas. Then we still dont lose anything by downloading. We have a chance of getting a crack that works for this and thus be able to play as soon as the crack arrives, and if we're unlucky and whatever crack first arrives doesnt work for this, then we're having to download the same anyway so no harm done."
,j3ff78,2012-10-10T02:23Z,"FLT released a crack...

Search for zernel32.dll, and check russian forums for a modified steam_api.dll specifically for this crack, because that modified dll also requires functions that not present into zernel32.dll. Simple as that. Gofor it, it works.
Any smartass who says it requires directx 10 is probably a microsoft employee. Know your enemy."
