,brbear,2012-10-10T00:49Z,"@TaurusM:  You ARE aware this film is in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio right?  meaning there's no requirement to render the black bars on the top and bottom.   

the 1080p resolution is a valid spec as a full-screen player will render the black bars properly independantly of the video itself."
