Can you put something in the description urging downloaders to donate at least the 5$ to one of the charities that Jon and Bill were donating the proceeds to? I'm downloading because watching an mp4 is more convenient for me than streaming, and intend to donate."
,benefit1970,2012-10-07T06:48Z,"I paid the $5, but I couldn't stream or download, so I am very grateful for this! Thanks from a paying customer!"
,UMe2,2012-10-07T06:58Z,I second Goron's message. I bought access to the streaming service but due to the extremely overloaded servers I could not watch it live (at 2 AM in my region). Even download is impossible right now. Quite amateurish. I'll ask for a refund and donate 5 $ directly to the charity. I hope that everyone does the same.
,BoonesFerry,2012-10-07T07:02Z,"Thanks turd23a
Glad someone capped the stream.
What app did you use?"
,Pedeadstrian,2012-10-07T07:11Z,"I couldn't watch the event that I paid for either, because of their damn website. The thing is already over, but it won't even let me log on. So yay for piracy!"

I just used uTorrent, nothing special.

,turd23a,2012-10-07T07:18Z,"I don't normally do this sort of thing, but I paid to watch this live debate and couldn't. I scrambled to get this downloaded and seeded (lots of people were obviously upset)."
,bender420,2012-10-07T07:37Z,I would donate if I had any money at all in my bank account but I don't.  Lucky I haven't had Comcast turn me off yet.  I normally only seed up to 1.0 but since a lot of people paid and got screwed I'm gonna seed this one til whenever I get up tomorrow.  
,danwat1234,2012-10-07T07:38Z,It's also on youtube (for now)
,turd23a,2012-10-07T08:40Z,"If you still wanted to donate to the charities, here is the list that half of the net profits were going to: New York Collaborates for Autism, Wounded Warrior Project, Fisher House Foundation, Alzheimer's Association, Boomer Esiason Foundation, Doctors Without Borders, Tuesday's Children, Portrait Project, NYC Coalition for the Homeless, Project A.L.S., Bob Woodruff Foundation, Haitian Health Foundation, The USO, Responsibility, Childcare, Best Friends Foundation and FealGood Foundation.

,muckymucks,2012-10-07T09:23Z,The video is blocky in the first minute but then it clears up nicely. Not HD but very watchable. Thanks for the up!

^ This!"
,dynamo8899,2012-10-07T11:20Z,Why would you pay or donate for a free torrent on a free torrent site that should have been your first clue that this upload is a scam.  But I guess we all make mistakes better luck next time. Besides the uploaders name (turd23a) should have been a big red flag on this one.
,etc850,2012-10-07T15:53Z,"@dynamo8899

Wow. Because this was a charity event that people paid for. The media delivery company fucked up. Go back to grade school, idiot.

Idiots like you are why people are disinclined to help - and I won't ever again. But, it's hardly a scam (what do I have to gain?). 

But perhaps you are simply upset at the charity list names? I forgot to include 'Retarded Neckbeards' and I apologize. How will you ever survive the brutal winter now?"
,twitchfl,2012-10-07T16:44Z,Great quality except for the first minute. Thanks!
,BSBazooka,2012-10-07T19:24Z,"I was going to pay the $5 and stream live, but had made other plans for that time. I am soooo glad I avoided that fiasco! Great video! Thanks for the DL Mr. Turd! hahaha!"
