And here you are, the original Lanfeust of Troy series, that my earlier posts of Lanfeust of the Stars and Cixi of Troy is spinoffs from.
Thanks again to Alice for scanning and translating this great comic.

In the world of Troy where everyone has a power, Lanfeust, an apprentice blacksmith can melt metal. He knows nothing but a quiet, peaceful life in the tiny village of Glinin until he comes into contact with a sword that can grant him total, absolute, unlimited power! Accompanied by the wise Sage Nicolede and his two daughters, Cian and Cixi, Lanfeust is swept away on a whirlwind adventure in which he will confront the most dangerous creatures and sometimes, as with Hebus the troll, befriend them. From Glinin to the eternal city, Eckmul. From Eckmul to the 77 Baronies of Hedulie and to Darshan and beyond, Lanfeust will embark on a fabulous quest that will decide the fate of Troy!
