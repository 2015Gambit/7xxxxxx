The dogs of Doverville are in trouble again... but Emily O'Conner
(Danielle Chuchran) is back to save them in a song-filled, seasonal
extravaganza. Mean-spirited mogul Finneas James (Sean Patrick
Flanery) plots to shut down the local puppy orphanage, unless Emily
can come up with the money to save it. With the help of some friends
she races against time to put together a musical holiday event that
just might save the day. Don't miss the new chapter in the
heartwarming saga
