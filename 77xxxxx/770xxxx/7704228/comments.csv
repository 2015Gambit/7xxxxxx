,fuci23,2012-10-12T01:25Z,How do I merge these files into an ISO?
,fuci23,2012-10-12T02:00Z,"Okay, figured out you need to extract the files using winzip but after that's all done and said I'm left with a generic image file with no extension.  I tried extracting it using Xbox Backup Creator but it didn't recognize the image.  I'd like to extract this game to my RGH, Any help would be greatly appreciated."
,aldo45,2012-10-14T17:16Z,"@fuci23 - Exactly the same problem. It's not like thenoobish to package stuff as badly as this... Several .000, .001 etc and a .dvd file which when extracted gives a generic disc image without a file extension which cannot be used in iso2god, isoextract or xbox backup creator. Even changing it to .ISO and/or burning with imgburn and the .dvd file doesn't work. Somebody please post how the fuck to sort this shit."
