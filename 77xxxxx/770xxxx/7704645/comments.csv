Wish they had some prequests for rep like they did in cata. Like shdow pan rep and such you can get before dalies. Maybe they do i am missing somthing or it is something they are gonna add. Either way AWSOME and thanks

,Nitrozoid,2012-10-11T22:40Z,Does this work on the true wow servers?
,BlackWi,2012-10-12T16:52Z,"Yes Nitrozoid, this works just fine on all World of Warcraft server. It's really no danger at all using it since it doesn't break any rules. You can think about it like a Quest helper combined with Wowhead."
,Nitrozoid,2012-10-12T19:41Z,@BlackWi  well them Im doing some thing wrong as its not working on the true wow. I get some sort of map error
,BlackWi,2012-10-12T20:55Z,"Nitrozoid: Extract the folder and put it in your wow installation directory inside the addon folder. Make sure that the addon is loaded. Press the addon button in character menu, shouldn't be any problem if your doing it right."
,bluez00r,2012-10-14T08:00Z,"We need and update :PP i will appreciate

For those with issues follow this order:
1. unzip the download
2. open your WOW addons directory..usually C:Program Files (x86)World of WarcraftInterfaceAddOns
3. copy the Zygor folder into the wow addons directory
4. Start the game
5. On the character select screen click on the addons menu on the lower left side of screen
6. Check the Zygor selection
7. Start the game
8. ENJOY!"
