Information
------------------------------

Anders Wahlgren's two-part drama documentary provides an insight into how everyday people lived during the era when the great warship Vasa was constructed, almost four hundred years ago. We follow the fates of various people during trying times ja the shadow of a war - which would later be called The Thirty Years' War. At the time, Stockholm was a small and dangerous capital, with barely fitteen thousand inhabitants. The Stockholm shipyard, run by Margareta Hybertsson, was the largest workplace in the city.
It took more than three years to complete this comprehensive dramatization. The DVD also contains a film where Anders Wahlgren guides the viewer through the famous ship's history, and explains how 16th century Stockholm, and the Vasa, is portrayed in the series with the help of advanced digital techniques.
