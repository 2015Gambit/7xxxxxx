Very nice quality. Hope to be satisfied when it's all done."

,Halomoee,2012-10-22T06:35Z,Thanks! :) :) :)
,El-Kazi,2012-10-24T15:35Z,"OK, so this is not finished yet, but I looked at 2 episodes. Quality is very good. Only problem, but a quite big one:
It's hardsubbed and the subtitles' font is SO BIG it takes often the whole screen ! To change that, you'll need to convert the mkf files, extract the subs, edit them, combine them again and last convert to mkv. 291 files, no thanks.
You still can watch, but it's very inconvenient.
It's a real shame, qiality is excellent and multilanguage !! thanks pyrodog1490 for this big up but I will be looking for another version though, I can't stand reading the whole screen and not watching much of the anime.. Peace."
