,zaccyjaccy,2012-10-13T12:51Z,"Please seed, I know not everyone wants to seed/can seed, but if you've already got it, as you can see the 1st Doctor's adventures are obviously hot demand and I'm willing to wait 27weeks/infinity (as the ETA currently jumps between) but if you do already have it, please seed so that others can get it and then seed. Because isn't it seeding that makes the world go round?"
