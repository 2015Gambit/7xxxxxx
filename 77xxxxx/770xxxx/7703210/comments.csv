TS NEW XviD-RESiSTANCE: V=4, A=6

TS XviD AC3-ADTRG: V=5, A=7

TS NEW SOURCE READNFO XViD-26K: V=6, A=7

This version does start from the very beginning, whereas the other two miss about the first ten seconds. However, as nothing really happens in those seconds it shouldn't be a problem.

@Gh0stNet: I know I've not rated your print too highly, but at least you're uploading stuff, which is more than me!!
