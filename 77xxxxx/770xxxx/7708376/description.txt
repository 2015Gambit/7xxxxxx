Body Invaders 
How did that get there and how did they get it out? Those are going to be the two questions you ask yourself when you watch this brand new series. A Christmas tree, a pair of shears, the spike on top of a set of railings, and a full set of cutlery!? All of these foreign objects have somehow inserted themselves into someone. We talk to the victims, eye-witnesses, recreate the gory accidents and show you the gruesome x-rays that show where those bodies got invaded. And, more importantly, how the medical professionals managed to extract the objects and save the victims' lives. 
Unwanted Guests
One minute, a young American couple are out on a romantic drive in the woods. The next minute, the wife has a Christmas tree coming out of her neck. A boy out fishing is, literally, taken hook line and sinker and nearly chokes to death on a cruel barb. Perhaps, most extraordinary of all is the story of a man who nearly dies after being pumped full of enough air to blow up a thousand party balloons. In each story, the courage and resourcefulness of friends and medics save lives and doctors perform feats of derring- do to locate and expel these unwelcome, lethal guests.
