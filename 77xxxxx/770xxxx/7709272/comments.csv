I changed it back, so if anybody was getting errors or failures on this one just give the torrent a gentle shove and it will start rolling again."
,STFmaryville,2012-10-09T18:06Z,thanks so much for filling my request!
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-09T19:53Z,"You're most welcom, STFmaryville. I would have uploaded these previously but I've been trying to get a complete run put together."
,riverchase,2012-10-10T05:02Z,im stuck at 99% for an hour now
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-10T06:08Z,"riverchase, that's weird. Is it still stuck right now? If so, I don't know why. It's shows as seeding fine with a steady stream of data being uploaded. "
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-11T02:32Z,"OK, so, don't go to the included link for the Suprbay (the thread is no longer there). Sometimes things just don't work out the way you intended, and this was one of them."
