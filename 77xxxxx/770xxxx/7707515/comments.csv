I usually use DivX Plus, but in this case I just searched till I found this AVI. I located it on rapidshare and grabbed it from there, then uploaded it here. I've done this once or twice before when for some reason ettv don't bother with an AVI version.

Hope that helps."

Sure wish there WAS some way to PM someone here ...

Anyway, AVC (AnyVideoConverter) will do what you want.

If you start with a MKV source and convert to XVID and go from 1280x720 to 720x400 / 640x360 / 624x352 with a bit rate around 1024k.

Curiously, most MKV files convert at 23.998fps

If your AVI player can handle x264 in an AVI container, the easiest thing to do is perform CC2AVI on the MP4.

If you have any trouble or questions, just use a comment on a recent post of mine.
