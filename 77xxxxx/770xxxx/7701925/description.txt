TRANSISTOR PUNCH contains a premium selection of drum hits, melodic synthesizer sounds, advanced multi-effect chains, and pre-programmed patterns full of dancefloor bounce. Developed by Surround SFX, over 900 samples of one-shot drum and multi-sampled instruments were created using modern and vintage drum machines and synthesizers as source material - plus unusual sources such as metal whisky boxes, glasses full of coffee beans, and ancient Swiss cowbells. The results are a MASCHINE EXPANSION that adds a carefully-crafted set of new and instantly useable sounds to your MASCHINE library.
