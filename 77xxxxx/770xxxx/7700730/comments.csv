,kellgrich,2012-10-09T09:55Z,"Is only 32 bit version in this 10GB download or does have 64bit as well?

Can see that the download has two components: one for Windows and one for Unix. Presume it is not as shown on incorporated picture, ""About Matlab"".
But am I right in assuming this means the 10GB total download includes 64bit version as well?"
,felimz,2012-10-09T20:30Z,"This torrent includes both Unix and Windows ISOs.

Includes the following platforms:

    Windows (32-bit)

Sorry for being such a noob.."

@pirate3040: this is first torrent for 2012b and felimz also provided a crack. If you were good, provide us  ISO files with crack that you think complete. Could you?!"
,roadhill77,2012-10-31T14:11Z,"Hi, I dowloaded this and when I opened it up it was Nero Express Essentials. 
No Matlab...
what's up with that?"

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7741933/MATLAB_R2012b_-_2012b_-_8.0_-_WIN_-_FULL_CRACK_ONLY_

Working crack for Matlab R2012b.

This crack works for ALL the Toolboxes!!

To install MATLAB R2012b make next steps:
1. Copy all files from DVD to folder on your hard drive, i.e 'C:MATLABSetup'
2. Change file 'install.jar' in the folder 'C:MATLABSetupjavajarinstall.jar' by 'install.jar' from this archive:
   * Select file 'Usualinstall.jar' if you don't know what it is 'MATLAB Production Server'.
   * Select file 'MPSinstall.jar' if you REALLY need 'MATLAB Production Server'.
3. Run 'setup.exe', choose 'Install without using the Internet', enter serial: 23809-26556-08469-31324
4. Choose 'Custom install' to select needed components. Uncheck 'MATLAB Distributed Computing Server 6.1' if you DON'T use MDCE.
5. Activate with file 'matlab2012b_std.dat' from this archive.

P.S. Result of execution of 'ver' are in 'ver.txt'.

,kellgrich,2012-11-08T05:40Z,"Ja Ja, seems from my google search on ""Riedited by fmcard"" that this crack is now at 
http://thepiratebay.ee/torrent/7741933/

:-)

But does anyone know if it works??????"
,kellgrich,2012-11-08T05:45Z,"How is     http://thepiratebay.se 
  different from 
http://thepiratebay.ee 
as appears in that alternative crack URL I mentioned above?"
,kellgrich,2012-11-09T08:36Z,"Can try out that previously removed crack
     i.e. http://thepiratebay.ee/torrent/7741933/
 which is just now available again at
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7807770

Not sure if it works at all. Please comment back here if you find it helpful."
,EderRc,2012-11-09T23:50Z,"interesting is the proposed solution, I would try and see if the error is solved but SimPowerSystems http://thepiratebay.ee/torrent/7741933/ torrent does not have the option to download the new crack full. I hope I can fix and get your help. thanks"
,m2835,2012-11-10T01:05Z,"EderRc: Puzzling as to why but the alternative crack was taken down from PirateBay.se within 12 hours of being re-uploaded. Comment put on this torrent (the ISO) was not deleted by PirateBay. The logical deduction is that the alternative crack possibly had something very objectionable in it. Not sure at all. Normally have seen in the past that plenty of torrents are suss but I didn't think PirateBay would pounce like that unless the material was particularly disgusting such as child pornography maybe? Or material sensitive to the Swedish government?

I identify with your interest in getting a fully working Matlab R2012b. If you wish, just email to tapvotersblock@gmail.com and a reply will be sent back with the approx 450kB alternative crack attached. Would be interesting too, when you try it out, if you could confirm whether it works fully. You sound like the sort of serious matlab user who is familiar with full functionality."
,manolns,2012-11-14T03:10Z,i need crack for unix (macbook pro) please!
,m2835,2012-11-14T18:34Z,"The alternative crack 
  ed2k://|file|MATLAB%20R2012b%20crack.zip|473679|F5E45BF5C39FB91753B5A4D336A9C4D7|/

looks like it works for the Unix ISO as well, contained within felimz's 10.32GB download alongside the Win ISO. Seems the alternative crack doesn't enable all the toolboxes."
,usedtowork,2012-11-17T13:46Z,"Reading these comments, there'a s lot of confusing info and broken links. Does anyone have a 100% working crack they can put on Sendspace or some other file host where it won't disappear overnight?"
,gustavocola,2012-11-22T15:32Z,This matlab isn't complete!!
,bobqqq,2012-11-24T02:26Z,"Does anyone, please, anyone have the stupid Matlab Connector 1.2 from an older release?

Please???"
