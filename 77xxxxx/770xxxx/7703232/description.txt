Relive the very beginning of the feud between the Capwells and the Lockridges in Santa Barbara, California in the glorious 80s, with Eden and Cruz, Kelly (played by Robin Wright) and Joe, Gina, Santana.

Around 60 consecutive episodes in iTunes format. (In iTunes settings, be sure to tick TV SHOW instead of MOVIE, so that they will be ordered much more sensibly.)

Enjoy!
