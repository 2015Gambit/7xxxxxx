,DiogenesDaCynic,2012-10-07T17:19Z,"00sweeney:  I don't know what went wrong with the first one -- uTorrent told me it has missing or corrupted files, so i made a new one.  As far as I can tell, three people are downloading this one.  Let me know if I'm doing anything wrong."

,00sweeney,2012-10-10T05:44Z,"I just looked at the first episode and I wanted to give a head's up about the quality--it's very bad. It looks worse than if someone used a video camera to tape their TV broadcast--which is what looks like happened. There are hard coded subtitles, the picture is very bad and the audio is out of synch. Diogenes, I'm not trying to be a jerk, and I've never uploaded anything, let alone something this ambitious--but this is a HUGE download and people need to know what the quality is before they commit that much time and space on their hard drive. I think this is completely unwatchable. Sorry."
,00sweeney,2012-10-10T05:47Z,"The second episode seems slightly better than the first, but it's still not very good. And the subtitles are very distracting. "
,DiogenesDaCynic,2012-10-10T23:32Z,"For die-hard fans from the fan communities only.  For a sample, download episode #1, which is about the worst quality episode.  About 1/3 of all of them have hard-coded (Swedish?) subtitles.  Many, many, many thanks to the original uploaders who took the time to transfer their old VHS tapes to digital (the only way many of us die-hard fans in the world can see SB again).  First half of 1985's episodes to come soon."
