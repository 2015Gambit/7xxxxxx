[T],tikasukaz,2012-10-09T01:28Z,"ere are some possible fixes for black screen, language select stuck, start delay, crash
IMPORTANT STEPS BEFORE YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE
-update video card drivers
-run and complete Windows Update
-update directX from FIFA 13/_installer folder
-unplug any controler except keyboard of course
The game is designed to run on VISTA, 7 or 8 . The XP users may run it or not. It's about luck.

1. In my documents/fifa 13 you must have a ""instance0"" folder . If you dont have the folder create one. In that folder its replay0.bin file. If you dont have it create a txt file named replay0.txt. save it and rename it to replay0.bin, right click on it and make it ""read only""
(if you dont see the .TXT extension go to control panel/folder option/view and uncheck the ""hide extensions for known file types"")


2. any version of the game you have (not fake, survey ones) it has normaly a FIFA 13 folder. If you have a .ISO, mount it and in your virtual drive you will find that FIFA 13 folder. Move that folder (no fifa13 3dm or so) to Program Files/Origin Games (with space). If you dont have it create one.


3. For default, you don't need Origin. But installing Origin helped alot of people if the game still not working. Install origin and let the login window to appear and do NOTHING. Just let it there in background, without log in.


4. Windows Media Player its also requiered to play FIFA. A faulted WMP will make your game to crash (more likely after language select). You have to reset your WMP.
Go to Control Panel/Program and Features/Turn Windows Features on or Off (left side) a new window appear. Expand Media Features and uncheck the Windows Media Player. Restart PC. After restart go to same location and check back the box of WMP.

5. Also for game crash, try lowering your resolution and game quality to minimum to see if the game starts or works properly.

6. Try also to run fifa.exe as administrator.


Remember: the game has alot of issues and bugs from the producers. So, dont expect to much! "
