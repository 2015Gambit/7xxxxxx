A pity those other works of Bilal are in French though, which is probably why I've never come across them. :( But if you'd be so kind as to upload those, then some of us would at least be blessed with the visuals of the legendary Enki Bilal. And hopefully someday, someone who speaks French will be to translate them. ;) *wink wink* Data 9724~

P.S. The link to your Comic Book Emporium seems to show a danger message that reads like this: 

""You attempted to reach forum.suprbay.org, but the server presented an expired certificate. No information is available to indicate whether that certificate has been compromised since its expiration. This means Google Chrome cannot guarantee that you are communicating with forum.suprbay.org and not an attacker. You should not proceed, especially if you have never seen this warning before for this site.""

Just thought you might wanna know. :)"

Yeah, I think the SuprBay forum give some variation of that error to a lot of people (depending on which browser you're using). Fortunately, it's completely safe. You just have to tell your browser that, or let it store the certificate anyway... or maybe it was acquire a new one. I don't remember because it's been a minute since I went through it, but the site is safe and they are aware of the certificate issue."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-11T02:23Z,"OK, so, don't go to the included link for the Suprbay (the thread is no longer there). Sometimes things just don't work out the way you intended, and this was one of them."
