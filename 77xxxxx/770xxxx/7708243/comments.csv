Shame there were no comments to go on???

Checked out the sample which for the most part looks pretty good. There is a slight blur which is to be expected with a cam but otherwise it looks good. The audio seemed fine also.

Based on sample i would say V/6 and A/7 (cam).

Once i've watched it, if i found any issues during the movie which would stop me from downloading i'll pop in and advise. Otherwise cheers"

,ScottyD7421,2012-10-09T14:53Z,"Watched the movie and here are the issues;

Audio - for the most part was very good, the only problem apart from one or two minor sync issues which lasted only about 10 seconds each (VLC) was the pitch which changed a couple of times during the movie but didn't impact on hearing what was going on.

Video - The movie kept phasing light to dark right throughout the movie, it only impacted in a few places and only in night scenes although you could still see what was going on. The main issue was it appeared to skip a minute or two in one scene which  while not pivotal to understanding the movie it still was a pretty important scene. I say appeared because without seeing the movie at the cinema or on dvd i can't be positive, it just appeared to have skipped.

All in all very watch able and not too bad a movie. 

Hope someone finds this information useful.

Cheers"

Downloading now, if I find any issues other than what @ScottyD7421 mentioned, I will post back.

And once again thanks @J.R.Dobbs and thanks to TPB as always"
