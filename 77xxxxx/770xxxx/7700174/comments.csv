,Seaford,2012-10-10T02:33Z,Thank you very much for this torrent - I've been waiting for one that does not crash my computer.  Looking forward to the rest of this season.  Thank you again.
,ghostman123,2012-10-14T18:50Z,Can we expect the other discs soon? Thanks!
,CAPRIKA,2012-10-21T07:11Z,"This is Cool Thanks 
is this the re-issue / replacement without sound problems ?"
,jalucian,2012-11-05T02:45Z,"CAPRIKA: No, this is not the re-issue. What you're thinking of was a set that contained the entire first season (not just the first 5 episodes), was in 1080p instead of 720p, and had different (blue) packaging."
,Seaford,2012-11-06T22:00Z,I am hoping that you will do the other discs soon.  I am unable to reproduce the quality of your upload with either of my compression programs.  Again thank you for this.
