All these years of feverishly buying Underworld releases and here they all are, nicely compiled in a three-disc set. 1992- 2012 Anthology is one of two retrospective collections the forward-thinking British dance duo is putting out at the same time, marking 20 years of Underworld. The duo released a similarly titled greatest hits collection 10 years ago: 1992 - 2002. A large number of these tracks were also on the Underworld live album, Everything Everything. And almost all of them turn up again on the second collection, A Collection, which has a coinciding release with Anthology
