I have three special requests, if at all possible:

The song ""Both Sides Now"" by Joni Mitchell and Judy Collins, or anyone else who covered it competently.  

Also, ""Heart and Soul"" by T'Pau.  I am trying to complete an 80's/MTV video collection and can't find a decent, non-mangled copy of the original video.  

And ""Close (To the Edit)"" by Art of Noise.  

If you have any of those in your collection, please hook a brother up."
