I am confused on which path.."

I've been trying to activate heartfire for a while now and nothing happened.

I have the Razor1911 version 1.7.7.0.6 of Skyrim > http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6808323/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim-Razor1911
I have this Update 10 + Dawnguard > http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7502589/The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Update.10.Incl.Dawnguard

And this hearthfire files.

I copied all files dawnguard and hearthfire (.bsa and .esm) into the Data folder, and just in case, also in the Skyrim main folder, in the directory.


I added the line ""bEnableFileSelection=1"" into prefs to enter the data files from the launcher, checked both dawnguard and heartfire.

At the moment I have dawnguard working, but not hearthfire, the one I wanted to play. I tried different orders, first dawnguard, first heartfire... 

Everything I tried made dawnguard work, but not heartfire.

I even created a line (read it no where, but just to try) ""bEnableFileSelection=2"" Nothing changed.


Please, help. I hope I gave the necesary details. And please forgive my english, I'm spanish.

Thanks in advance."
