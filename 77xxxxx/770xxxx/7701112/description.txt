With this official add-on to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, you can purchase
land and build your own home from the ground up - from a simple one-room
cottage to a sprawling compound complete with an armory, alchemy
laboratory, stable, garden, and more. Use all-new tools like the drafting
table and carpenters workbench to transform quarried stone, clay, and
sawn logs into structures and furnishings. Even transform your house into
a home by adopting children

1. Unrar to your SKYRIM installation directory
2. Start Launcher and activate Hearthfire DLC
3. Play the game

Note: this release contains the new DLC content only. It requires Skyrim to
be installed with the latest update and the Dawnguard DLC. This was tested
using the The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Update.10.Incl.Dawnguard.DLC-HI2U
release
