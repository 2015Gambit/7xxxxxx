Overview
This was no ordinary war. This was a war to make the world safe for democracy. And if democracy was made safe, then nothing else matteredΓÇönot the millions of dead bodies, nor the thousands of ruined lives...This is no ordinary novel. This is a novel that never takes the easy way out: it is shocking, violent, terrifying, horrible, uncompromising, brutal, remorseless and gruesome...but so is war.

Winner of the National Book Award
This work continues to rivet readers with its story of an American youth who survives World War I as an armless, legless, and faceless basket case with his mind intact.

Editorial Reviews
Publishers Weekly
This audio edition of Trumbo's classic 1939 novel of war's insanity begins as a bit of a slog because of the lengthy padding at its start. With two introductions, from Cindy Sheehan and Ron Kovic, that attempt to place the novel in the context of more recent armed conflicts in both Iraq and Vietnam, it is the better part of a disc before the book properly begins. Once it does, though, the slog ceases. Trumbo's novel is spine-tingling in its immediacy and horror, and William Dufris (while occasionally fumbling around in his bag of voices) mostly gives the words room to breathe. For this book, little more is necessary. 

Library Journal
Trumbo's horrific 1939 novel of World War I garnered the National Book Award and kudos from critics. The book resurfaced as one of the leading protest novels during the Vietnam era. With current events as they are, the antiwar book will no doubt find a new audience.
