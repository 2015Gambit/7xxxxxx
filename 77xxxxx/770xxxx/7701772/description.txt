TAGAP 2 expands the original action formula to new heights with variety of new gameplay features, diverse environments and bigger and more dynamic action. Pablo is more able than before tossing grenades, using new vehicles, utilizing electro-magnetism and being more bad-ass, while Pedro provides back-up via air strikes. Not only that, but if you have a game pad your friend can assume the role of Pedro and join you side-by-side in split-screen co-op play.
