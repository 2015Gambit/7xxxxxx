An unusual angle on Chile's Pinochet dictatorship - the repressive police-state is shown as a social atomisation which makes it paradoxically straightforward for a murderous psychopath to go about his criminal business. The film, however, takes things a step further into offbeat territory by having the killer - a withdrawn, taciturn, fiftyish misanthrope - obsessed with the film Saturday Night Fever and its main character Tony Manero, to the extent of entering a TV contest showcasing Manero impersonators. The result is an unlikely but unsettling combination of moods and tones, which narrowly overcomes the gimmicky implausibility of its central conceits.
