,timothx,2012-10-07T14:53Z,Thank you.
,glocask,2012-10-07T15:07Z,"A bit laggy, but good quality and sound.
Definately watchable"
,majorpayn,2012-10-07T15:54Z,"@glosack - Unfortunately, this is the quality provided by the website :/"
,theshape31,2012-10-07T21:44Z,"In case anyone is wondering, it's only 13fps.  It looks horrible, and I'm glad I didn't pay for this."
,owen35,2012-10-08T02:05Z,"Sadly, I did pay for it and I find it unwatchable.  It's only $5 and half goes to charity, but it is still unacceptable."
,ricky5005,2012-10-08T02:22Z,"Thanks dude, I appreciate the effort!"
,JRaiden,2012-10-08T02:55Z,"Half goes to 'charity'. The other half went... somewhere else, probably some to Nox Solutions who seem to be to blame for fucking this up. Thanks majorpayn, seeders."
,skoumoun,2012-10-08T22:27Z,"The Rumble website has a new 1.77Gb video with 30fps, so don't bother on this version, the 1.49Gb version has only 13fps because of technical problems."
,Muzik305,2012-10-09T02:03Z,"@skoumoun Thanks for the update, now we just have to wait for it to show up. Not seeing it here yet. (On the Bay)."
,bassposaune,2012-10-09T02:54Z,I hope some one ups the 30fps even if not 720p.  I'm dying to watch this.
,escortlvr,2012-10-09T06:33Z,I bought this after downloading the 13fps version. The 1.77gb version is 29fps but it's somewhat choppy too. Not as bad as the version here though. 
,clint-barton,2012-10-09T08:15Z,"Thanks for the show, i was looking for it. "

Same here. I paid for and downloaded the high quality version. Still suffers from choppy video even though the file reports 29.970 fps."
,skoumoun,2012-10-09T10:59Z,"Here is the proper High Quality version : 720p and 30fps.

Not perfect but the best officially available."
