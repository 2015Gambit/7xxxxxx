   1. Unrar.
   2. Burn or mount the image.
   3. Install the game.
   4. Copy the cracked files from the Crack directory on the disc to the
      Game directory, overwriting the existing exe.
   5. Before you start the game, use your firewall to block all exe files in
      the games install directory from going online. Use the game setup
      before starting as well. It can be found in the following directory:
      Gamefifasetup
   6. Play the game. While in game, avoid all of the online options. If you
      have Origin installed, it may start it up. If that happens, ignore the
      prompt, play offline, and dont login.
   7. Enjoy!
