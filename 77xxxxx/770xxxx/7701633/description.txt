three high school virgins, suspended from school on a bogus
graffiti charge, flee to the inner city in an attempt to live
out the plot of The Catcher in the Rye - a book they neither
have read nor understand. BINDLESTIFFS documents their struggles
along the way as they surrender their virginities to
vagrants, prostitutes, and crack fiends.
