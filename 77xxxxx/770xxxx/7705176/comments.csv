,kelbyc,2012-10-08T04:34Z,"Is this a playable file right off the bat, or do you have to do something with it other than unzip it?  I don't know what a .ts file is :/"

,s_jimmie,2012-10-08T10:13Z,"oh and it works, the release is legit.

No rar, no pass."
,jpmeyer038,2012-10-08T14:14Z,"thank you for the upload.  Last week i had to download a different torrent because this one would not display correctly probably because its 60fps.  My TV is not compatible, and my HTPC is a bit old - so that was probably my problem."
,Artinium,2012-10-08T14:19Z,"Great quality, nice upload"
,iGrenade,2012-10-08T20:11Z,"quality is inferior to EVOLVE's release.

look elsewhere, folks."
,sk4di,2012-10-08T20:28Z,"For people like me who are confused about the '60 fps' thing, here's the clarification:-

The FPS business is confusing at best partly because FPS is used in two different ways. 24 FPS generally means 24 frames per second which is a film standard. 60 FPS generally means 60 fields per second which is the interlaced TV standard. Since a TV frame is made up of two fields, 60 fields per second equals 30 TV frames per second."
,sk4di,2012-10-08T20:31Z,"@SecTPB Not trying to offend or act like a bitch but you should better add this remark that its 30'frames'ps.

Anyways, great up! Appreciate the work."
,inemanja,2012-10-08T23:44Z,"to low bitrate for 60fps... it's like  640mb 1hour 720p at 30fps...  it's good to have 60fps version, but next time you should make 2-2.5 giga file (720p @60fps - of course)
cheers!!"
,smudge13,2012-10-09T05:13Z,this file type has no sound on ps3 :(
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-09T11:41Z,"@smudge13
You would want to download my PS3/360 release then, here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7705510"
,Kknewkles,2012-10-10T17:49Z,"What exactly is the point in 60 FPS? 
I can't think of anything else but more convenient screenshot taking, which I do a lot."
,smudge13,2012-10-10T19:46Z,"@SecTPB
I'll try it, and thanks for the effort you put into this! Just wondering if 480p will mean a loss of quality and/or picture size on my 1080p HD TV?"
,cjbobet,2012-10-12T22:23Z,En espa単ol para Madrid. Please in spanish. Thanks a lot.
,ntguru5,2012-10-30T04:32Z,Awesome!  (That's all I wanted to say)
,ChBukow,2012-11-20T12:56Z,"This is from an interlaced 60 FPS broadcast, and hasn't been properly handled brought back from it's actual 24 FPS progressive source. I.e., you have effectively 24 FPS played back at 60 FPS showing all the 3:2 pulldown's duplicate frames (creating stuttering (3 frames, 2 frames, 3 frames, 2 frames, etc.) at effectively 540p (one 1080i half frame).

So, it's 540p 24 BFPS (Broken Frames Per Second)

Surround audio is also badly downmixed to two channels.

A:1/10
V:1/10"
