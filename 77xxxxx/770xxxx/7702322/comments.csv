,subbz,2012-10-07T20:22Z,"Okay, so I'm not a negative person and I'm stoked that you have this and uploaded, Who the Fuck watches MKV's though? The MKV is no better quality than any of the others. How do I convert this to AVI for free? Don't get me wrong, thanks for the upload... Do you think you could up in a format that everyone else can use?"
,BreezeTDK,2012-10-07T22:28Z,"To:   subbz

You may not think you are negative, but your actions are.  MKV has become the most widely used container for video (IMO-I don't know if that is a fact, but it's popularity has exploded the past couple of years).  If you don't like it (because your equipment can't view it - probably dated), then make your own or convert it for your own use.  Try using Google about a subject and learning something before running your dumbass mouth.  I am sorry to anyone else reading this, but sometimes all of the lazy, selfish morons on here drive me a little insane.  Thanks to HeroMaster for the up.  :D"
,ecchiless,2012-10-08T00:06Z,"@subbz

Fucking cunt mkv is a container fucking asshole, the fact is that the x264 video codec that is used to encode this movie is much better that the shitty xvid/avi that u like so much so go and fuck ur self."
,CarlZeiss,2012-10-08T01:48Z,Anyone know where I can find the trailer?
,666s,2012-10-08T06:50Z,"to subbz, i agree with breeze, update your media player, pot player is free and awesome or find a converter and convert yourself.


thanks for the up hero"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-10-08T15:46Z,"@Breeze mkv is not even close to being the most used video container noob.maybe YOU should google how not to make an opinionated statement with a fact-posed introduction.& since we are on the subject of google...@subbz google vlc,it will play anything.if your still dead set on an avi google avs converter.they are both free.@HeroMaster thank you for this perfectly done x264 Matroska.@ecchiless eat a bag of dicks you loud mouth hater"

,mrnow76,2012-10-10T00:15Z,"Thanks for the upload. I don't care what container it comes in. If I don't like it, I just convert it to what I want using freemake video converter. For all of you living in the USA, downloading these kind of files using p2p is coming to and end soon, so enjoy it while you can."
