,shaunovhull,2012-10-08T18:19Z,obvs a gd copy then
,piranical,2012-10-08T20:32Z,"ts audio is good a8 and my compliments to FRiNGE, done a nice job dressing up the cam v7 (for cam). rating is not a science, it's a guide & a8v7 is very watchable for what it is. to my thinking, if  pirates can get a hq/decent cam from a new release movie and spice it up to a good standard, that is much more impressive than someone that pumps out a dvd rip, so standards r relative to what's available. if it hasn't been released to dvd/br anywhere in the world only a complete moron would rate it by that standard. thanks again scene4all!"

,Blackwarp,2012-10-11T07:19Z,"Title is way missleading, its a cam!... 
Video 1 
Audio 1

Cant understand how people actually have given this compliments, save your bandwidth for a better release, seriously this is crap."
,TaZeRz,2012-10-12T01:02Z,That's the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in the world or my dreams or the entire universe.
,jayrockskee,2012-10-13T02:23Z,"@Blackwarp: You might be the biggest douche in the universe. I know we are all waiting for your sweet upload so you can justify your ""crap"" rating. You see kid, the only way to describe something as crap is if you have a better version to compare it to. I'm guessing you don't since your parents just bought you your first computer and you're busy with pre-algebra homework and all. Go take out the trash shithead."
,Blackwarp,2012-10-13T07:08Z,"@jayrockskee 
Whatever man I dont care about your insults

If it says TS I expect a TS and not a Cam thats all.
If I knew I would have waited and not complained.
But atleast im not missleading people im just sayin save the bandwidth for a better release since quality like this just kinda ruin the movie but hey thats me and if thats make me a douche fine who frikin cares."
,Rush,2012-10-15T10:41Z,"@Blackwarp....

""TS"" is a CAMRip........
A ""TS"" uses cam video with better-quality audio, idiot."
,Rush,2012-10-15T10:55Z,"CAM: audio and video originate from the camera 
itself. [Common; Quality issues make this an unpopular format]

TS: a CAM in which audio recording is divorced or separated from the video recording to improve sound and reduce background noise. [Very common]

Many ""Telesyncs"" are mislabled as ""CAMRips""  "
,almost_a_genius,2012-10-18T01:57Z,"jayrockskee that comment was probably the funniest shit i have read in a while bro. Thank you for defending the true guys that go out there, spend their time and efforts, in an attempt to share with others for free. People who cry should go somewhere else!!"
,almost_a_genius,2012-10-18T03:08Z,"Also rush- you are 100 percent correct. This is not the slightest bit misleading in title. A TS is a cam, the difference is that the audio is almost perfect because it is plugged in to another source when recorded. "
,TaZeRz,2012-10-18T09:58Z,"Please can someone break into the studio and steal a DVD of this movie? 

I mean this is the best movie of the year with the hottest girl in the whole known universe in it!"
,ThinkBachs,2012-11-03T04:44Z,"peta27- how many times are you going to spam PB with your link?  Same comment on other shares.  If what you've found is so much better there, either upload it here or just stay there..."
,hackerps3,2012-11-05T23:06Z,The video quality is better on this copy but the camera is bouncing around a lot. Audio is ok. Here are my ratings V6/A8. Hope this may help out anybody wondering.
,OliverTwist26,2012-11-18T04:18Z,Quality is terrible. Not close to even being clear.
