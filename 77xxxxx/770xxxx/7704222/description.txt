Notes: Resize,crop,Sat,RGB,Denoise,HQSmoother and a bunch others.Didn't drop
the hot spots too much as we wanna screw up the dark scenes which were pretty
good and added some sweet LiNE to it to top it off much much better with some
LiNE, this one was a pain in the ass to sync but got it done, might have a
slight slip once or twice
So enjoy

And we made it so it will mux right over any encode of the HP Cam
