Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 282 seed,(im never having a go at the uploader ! )  if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out (eg if its porn what type eg lesbien) ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "

When I try to watch this, it is pixelated. 
Would recommend finding another source.
VLC was used to play the file.

Thanks for taking the time to upload it though uploader."
,3Dazz,2012-10-08T04:32Z,"@ passionpit, suggest problem at your end, I would not have uploaded a file that did play on my pc, tv and from a networked server. 
Works fine on my version of VLC,
sorry if yours doesnt.
Eztv has a lower resolution one that may suit you better.
Cheers"
,Runkies,2012-10-08T13:02Z,Video is great but i get no audio? what codec is the audio using ?
,e8hffff,2012-10-08T17:08Z,@ passionpit yeah works perfect on my linux system.  h264 is a great codec too.
,e8hffff,2012-10-08T17:48Z,They did a good job in bringing together all the old computing etc.  Very real stages and sets.  Very authentic to the era.
,TheUteBandit,2012-10-09T13:21Z,"thanks for upload but I have no audio.
I'm trying to watch using WMP and PowerDVD. Both have great pic but no audio. What codec are you using?"
,TheUteBandit,2012-10-09T13:23Z,thanks but no audio. any help?
,3Dazz,2012-10-09T23:35Z,"For those having audio issues use VLC Media Player. If that doesnt work I'm sorry, but I ran this on PC using VLC, played it with LG Smart Box across my network and plugged it directly into USB on my TV before I upped it. EZTV has a version thats only 555mb that may work for those who are having issues. "
,3Dazz,2012-10-10T00:14Z,"Ok From Now on I'll give more details re; Codec.
Codec: H264
Res:720x576
Frame Rate:25

Audio Codec:MPEG Audio Layer 1/2/3 (mpga)
Sample Rate: 48000 Hz
