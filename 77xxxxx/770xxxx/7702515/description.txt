Native Instruments Maschine Expansion True School-R2R
TEAM R2R | 2012.10.06 | 879MB

Old school + new school = TRUE SCHOOL. This MASCHINE EXPANSION shares the spirit of creative beatmakers who use their deep knowledge of hip hop production to break the rules. Forget dusty clichés, and aim high with a new future aesthetic.

The kits, synths and patterns in TRUE SCHOOL combine inspired sampling, hi-tech sound design and creative drum programming to lay new foundations for the future of beatmaking.

Acoustic and electronic drums are enhanced with artifacts and sonic embellishments, with the organic room sound intact. These drums have a bold signature: sharp, warm and gritty at the same time.

Strings, brass and pianos (both modern and vintage) have been re-sampled, filtered and processed for a harder attack and a vibrant tone.

Hard-to-find vintage and modern synthesizers, including the Arp Quadra, Rhodes Chroma, and Moog Minimoog Model D, were recorded through a Trident analog console and processed for an up-front sound to fit right into the mix. Basses and leads from Studio Electronics SE-1 and ATC-1 synths were recorded through a Steven Slate Fox preamp.
