,Karry666,2012-10-07T08:01Z,Nice!! thanks
,keanu501,2012-10-07T09:03Z,"I'm sorry, but the quality is very poor - deleted."
,nikita566,2012-10-07T11:07Z,"Thank you very much!

I am downloading now, so I don't know the quality, but for that guy who complained, be happy to have anything. I am actually very surprised no one else uploaded the debate. Instead of complaining, say thanks, or just pay the 4.95 they asked to see it online. Ungrateful people out there...whew."
,NomDeWhom,2012-10-07T11:27Z,"first minute is rough, but after that, everything smooths out and the duration is perfect.

totally worth it."
,Elgguod,2012-10-07T12:22Z,Awesome! I'll seed this bitch for DAYS!
,352Fella,2012-10-07T13:04Z,thanks
,splarty,2012-10-07T13:18Z,"I tried to log in to this event but the server was down so I missed it (hopefully because it was too successful).

Thank you for uploading!!"
,DrkCon,2012-10-07T13:23Z,You rule!
,3v1l5w1n,2012-10-07T16:20Z,"Thanks for the ""upload"" but the video quality is terrible"
,moshster,2012-10-07T17:08Z,It's an hour and a half long so of course 300Mb is not going to do it justice with regards video quality
,123acxvcv,2012-10-07T17:47Z,"Thanks for posting the comments :) It was my 2nd torrent so it took me a while to figure out how to post it, but seeing how nobody else posted it and how many people downloaded its totally worth the effort. Unfortunately i couldn't download the high quality video last night probably due to the server overload and high demand, medium and low quality vds downloaded fast. First minute is rough, but the rest of the video is good. I registered and paid the 4.95, and i'm sure Jon Stewart wouldn't mind that i seeded it."
,litreofcola,2012-10-07T19:03Z,Much appreciated!
,MarketingGuru,2012-10-07T20:21Z,"mp4 extension, great torrent, blurry at first but then it gets clear"
,75943,2012-10-07T23:13Z,"The quality is very poor - sorry man, it's just a little too bad to watch .."
,123acxvcv,2012-10-08T00:31Z,"i posted the high quality video earlier today,so get the high quality one if you want. i'm just sharing the video for others to watch, i dont really care or benefit from it. i know i really wanted to watch it, that's why i paid to watch it, and i know it is important that other people watch too."
,RandomPhobia,2012-10-08T02:41Z,Only the first minute or so is bad after that it gets better
,amalgamvirgo,2012-10-08T04:16Z,U R Awesome. I have been fidgeting and twitching since yesterday wanting to watch this. This next Guinness is for you. 
,keanu501,2012-10-08T06:19Z,"123acxvcv - my apology for the bad review. I restored your file from my Recycle Bin and watched it all. Like others have noted, it's fine after the first minute. Thanks again. =]"
,banjohero,2012-10-08T06:29Z,"Don't pay any mind to the ""crappy video"" comments.  It's BS.  The first sixty seconds looks like crap, but that's just the damn intro, and a few seconds of the moderator's opening comments.  The rest of the vid looks great.  

The sound level is a touch on the low side, but whatever; the sound quality itself is okay.

And again, the video quality is fine."
,eslyter,2012-10-08T06:34Z,"I wanted to download this. In fact I got about 1/3 of the way through before my conscience got the best of me.  The thing is, half the proceeds for the sale of this stream are going to go to charity.  I have a hard time downloading anything that would otherwise benefit charities.  Oh well..."
,123acxvcv,2012-10-08T19:53Z,"i didn't expect to get so many positive comments, thanks again. 
btw Rubmle servers were overloaded and a lot of people had problem streaming the live debate, due to overwhelming demand, so im sure they got a lot of money for charity :)"
,juan3rd,2012-10-09T05:05Z,"Wonderful torrent file---First 1.5 minutes are blurred, but after that the Video is a 10, and the Audio is a 10---Thank You very much for the upload"
,TimmyTalon,2012-10-09T07:27Z,"It's super important to check out the entire file before commenting on quality.  Just the firs few seconds are crappy, the most important stuff is really superb, especially for the file size.

Great upload!  Thanx!"
,TimmyTalon,2012-10-09T07:27Z,"Also, if you have the money to do so, pay for this on their web site.  The proceeds go to charity."
,Darklight310,2012-10-09T14:05Z,"123acxvcv - whatever your real name is...

Thank you for this important service.

You are doing what must be done.

S.C."
,123acxvcv,2012-10-09T22:46Z,"S.C. you are welcome, my name is Diane. 
I think everybody should hear these arguments before the election. It is unfortunate that the debate is not available on the Daily Show's website or that didn't air. "
,Jammin Man,2012-10-10T03:00Z,"Thanks for taking the time to upload this Diane, your effort is much appreciated by many people, myself included."
,Sherman8r,2012-10-11T12:49Z,"Like Tittyfuck_Johnson had done, I registered just because I was really bummed I had no way of watching the debate untill you...I have been using the bay for years, and its about time I registered, so THANKS!!!!

P.S. How the hell did you get your username valid that long? I'm restricted to a 9 character name? not likely I will get an answer but if anyone knows, I would appreciate!"
,rpgmaker,2012-10-13T16:59Z,"This is actually the best copy around (and the smallest!). It's better than the ~450mb, and the ~1.5gb. Look no further."
,okonomiyaki,2012-10-14T00:43Z,"@eslyter
Really?.. Your conscience prevented you from watching the rest of it when you were already 33% done watching it??.. Just because half of the money goes to charity?!?.. Would you still have stopped watching it if only 1% went to charity?..

Give some charity to your self and just watch the damn thing.. You need that money more than giant charity organizations do.. Besides, half of the proceeds DON'T go to charity.. You should at least have made it to 50% watching it.. −＿−＊"
