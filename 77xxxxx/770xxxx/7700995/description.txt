These three Microsoft games were released for Windows Vista Ultimate as part of the "Vista Ultimate Extras" set of bonus updates:

Tinker (and a level editor called Tinker Editor)
Hold 'Em (a Microsoft version of the popular poker game)
Inkball (a tablet-optimized ballgame)

Included in this torrent are cracked versions of the games which will run on any Windows Vista/7 version (the original games were hardcoded for Windows Vista Ultimate). I believe that the included versions of the games are either all x64 or at least some of them are, so x64 users will have to download this on their own risk.

Tinker has since its Vista Ultimate release become available in an updated form for all Windows versions through Windows Live, but like all Windows Live games, you need to login to Microsoft's servers and submit scores and game statistics. This older Vista Edition is a fully offline game and additional levels can be created with the included Tinker Editor.

In order to install the games, unpack the included RAR:s, run the Install.bat files as Admin and start the game either from the hard drive or through the shortcuts created in the Start menu and Games Explorer folder.
