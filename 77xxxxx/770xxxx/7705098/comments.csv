,ironymon,2012-10-08T08:32Z,55mb.. really?
,GripGlutz,2012-10-08T10:03Z,"Thanks eztv! Weird thou, 55mb. 
Now I'm no fancy big city hacker, but the file is legit, so I'm guessing awesome compression(?)"
,sugeci,2012-10-08T11:00Z,"55mb, 21:37 long. Great compression."
,RDawgg,2012-10-08T11:14Z,"I was kinda in a hurry for school so the filesize was perfect, cuz I downloaded it in 4 minutes. Keep it up."
,trace535,2012-10-08T12:18Z,This is a testament to how static and simplistic the artwork on Family Guy is compared to REAL animation like the Simpsons...
,Srsbznz,2012-10-08T12:35Z,"@trace535

Now I'm not defending Family Guy's animation, but did you really just say that The Simpson's animation is any better these days? If you were comparing it to the old seasons then I'd have to agree but it seems like you're not."
,Loudfist,2012-10-08T12:36Z,"Awesome , small size with Great quality . 
i don't know how you did it , maybe it has something to do with it being animated .. anyway big thanks ,, "
,haxxed,2012-10-08T17:49Z,Took me 10 seconds to download :D thx eztv!

Thanks :)"
,kam2604,2012-10-09T10:29Z,"please could someone tell me how we ended up with this file size, if you try a normal 150mb rip it is difficult to compress it without quality loss, this quality is great, would appreciate if someone could explain how to get this compression with good quality"
,leepster,2012-10-10T19:11Z,Many thanks dude!
,Heltmy88,2012-10-13T02:21Z,Thx eztv!

,joel1988,2012-10-15T20:17Z,Thank you!!
,GurkeyMai,2012-10-15T22:22Z,kam2604 its x264. It's a newer codec (at least in comparison with DivX and Xvid) that is only now in the last year or two getting more popular. The slowness of release groups to use the most updated codecs until now is the thing that accounts for the big difference.
,thefreakid,2012-10-16T12:24Z,@RDawgg 4MINS TO DOWNLOAD 55M holy crap your internet must be slow
,reeebty,2012-10-20T09:00Z,"That is slow by today's standards, but I still find it funny that people can't accept a show taking a quarter of the time to download as it takes to watch. I remember when downloading an album was overnight deal!"
,PunkArmy,2012-10-21T04:26Z,amazing compression right here
,stijr,2012-10-21T05:55Z,Thank you!
,shogun678,2012-10-22T16:46Z,"Wheres 3,4, and 5?"
,LucazSwe,2012-10-23T17:16Z,"@shogun678
This season has just started, just wait for it."
,Phatfish,2012-10-24T16:12Z,"@LucazSwe:

This exactly what I wondered.

According to IMDB there should be at least 3 episodes so far. I guess the broadcasting dates have been delayed. "
,papa123,2012-10-30T21:00Z,"@GurkeyMai

""its x264. It's a newer codec""

So how come episode one is 155mb?"
