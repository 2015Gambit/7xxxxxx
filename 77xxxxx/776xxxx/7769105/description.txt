About this programme

1/6. Writer and woodsman Rob Penn takes on a year-long project to restore the abandoned Strawberry Cottage Wood in Monmouthshire. He begins by introducing pigs to clear bracken and brambles and planning his tasks for the coming 12 months, but felling a tree on his first day almost brings his mission to an abrupt end.
