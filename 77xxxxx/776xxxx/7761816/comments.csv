(Recently it's been hard to get The Daily Show in 720p.)

Do you record this from TV, or are you taking this video from someone else? (I'd like to know whom do I beg for also putting up Charlie Rose. :)"

Would you please pass on the request? I can't bear watching Charlie Rose on his website anymore, the quality is so awful. 720p would make a big difference. 

Thanks!"
