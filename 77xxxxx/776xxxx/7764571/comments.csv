,costandan,2012-10-30T07:32Z,"Guys im running windows 8 Pro and when im trying to install it says something about 
""Origin"" what is that origin?"
,blue775,2012-10-30T10:50Z,"@costandan
Origin is a software made by EA so that they can spy on their users computers. Anyway, you'll probably have a hard time getting it to run on win8. Go back to win7 and make your life easier. 
Thanks for the upload btw.!!"

,brainvariation,2012-11-21T15:46Z,"I could download the game easily and i' m very satisfied of it : Thank you very much for uploading !
But i still have a problem : the game lags too much and takes an eternity to load the map and the road and plus when i press a key on the keyboard it takes 1 to 2 seconds to respond .
Anybody has any clue or an idea why. Please respond ASAP
Thank you very much"
