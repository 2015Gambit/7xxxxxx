Notes ....: HD4U used the AC3 core from the TrueHD audio stream core which is 
only 224k. Rules require high bitrate sources which can't be used in their original
format to be transcoded to a minimum bitrate of 640k. In this case the THD peak
bitrate is 1302k with an average of 1141k and should have been transcoded to a
higher bitrate than core.
