,hogspermcondom,2012-10-28T01:00Z,"Shady my ass !  What is there to patch ? This is Enterprise Version 

http://postimage.org/image/wj5bezs57/

And no enterprise version is NOT FREE  It currently costs US$ 2,839

I cracked this myself & made the installer with Auto-play media studio.. 

All the patch is  is a Batch file.  

One Stops the service and closes the program for you so you can run the patch.

And the Patch is just a winrar .exe that extracts the patch files into the installation directory..

1 Patch for 32 Bit Os
1 Patch for 64 Bit Os"

Thanks"

,race774,2012-11-02T16:17Z,"Installed on a virtual machine to make sure its clean and runs well before installing on my own computers. 
Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.
Followed install as stated.
Install as personal use, close, patch.

Shows Enterprise License and works as should. 

I run Microsoft Security Essentials and found no shady business going on.

Enjoy guys."
