The Emotions are an African American all female soul and R&B singing group. The group was formed in its current hometown of Chicago, Illinois originally consisting of three sisters.

The Emotions had gone through a number of record label changes before really hitting it big with their collaboration with Issac Hayes and then even bigger success with Maurice White of Earth Wind and Fire fame.

While their last album was in the mid to later nineties (Boogie wonderland with Earth Wind and Fire), they still continue to perform and make appearances today.
