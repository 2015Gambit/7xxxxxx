,Mr.Bookworm,2012-10-28T09:30Z,"Hi, can you please upload the comic called ""King David"" by Nate Watson (it was also published by Blue Water Comics) thanks, God bless..."
,jumjumb,2012-10-28T19:13Z,"Thanks for all your uploads. Its fucking good stuff. 

:o)"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-28T20:36Z,"Hey, thanks for the kind fucking words, jumjumb. You're most fucking welcome."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-28T20:36Z,"Mr.Bookworm, I'm looking into all your requests. Will certainly do what I can. "
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-28T21:58Z,"I'll post this to a few of my uploads to gauge the response, but I'm wondering...

How interested in back issues of The Comics Journal are y'all?

Very? You'd like all of them, or as many as possible.

A little? There's some that you would download individually, but you're not really looking for a complete run.

Not at all? You're not interested.

Keep in mind, to the best of my knowledge, a complete run DOES NOT YET EXIST. There's a lot of them ""out there"", but many of the more recent issues are not easily found. Also, the file size on many of them is as big (or bigger) than a good sized TPB.

Any input on this will go towards helping me decide whether or not I'm going to keep compiling them and/or, eventually, upload them. "

,muckymucks,2012-10-29T06:53Z,"Sounds cool. Mark Millar's first published work to boot. Thanks for the up, LeonardTSpock!"
