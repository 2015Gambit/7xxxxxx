,d347hBy73,2012-10-28T07:48Z,"It's great that you are uploading torrents now, but you did something wrong as it is not seeding."
,Jetpump7,2012-10-28T16:41Z,"Anyone have an idea what I may have done wrong? I use TorrentBitch as my client & ""http://open.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce"" as the tracker. Everything else seemed pretty straight forward. 

TB is showing the torrent as having no seeds, 0(26) Peers, 0.0 Health & occasionally the upload & download speeds climb from 0 to 0.15 KB/s. The Status says ""Downloading"", but progress is at 0.00%."
,Jetpump7,2012-10-28T17:18Z,"OK, I'm checking the tutorial in the Forum. I should be able to find the problem. May have to change client, re-up or something.

Thanks for the heads-up d347hBy73!"

I sure hope not..."
