BBC Prehistoric Autopsy 2of3 720p HDTV x264 AAC MVGroup

Anatomist Professor Alice Roberts and biologist Dr George McGavin go on an extraordinary evolutionary journey to meet our ancient ancestors. At the Prehistoric Autopsy HQ in Glasgow, with the help of a team of international experts, each episode follows the rebuilding of one of our most iconic ancient ancestors from the bones up.

2. Homo Erectus
This time they go back 1.5 million years to meet one of the earliest humans, Homo erectus. They walked the earth far longer than any other human species and were the first ancestors to look a lot like we do today. The team reveal the latest research that suggests Homo erectus were good hunters, were skilled at making stone tools and could probably control fire. They also look at evidence that suggests some individuals were helping those who couldn't help themselves. It may be the oldest evidence we have for something we think of as a human trait - compassion.
