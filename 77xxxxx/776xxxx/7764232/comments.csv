[H],shirepirate,2012-10-27T14:37Z,"there is no ""official final"" build. the RTM (version 6.2.92001) is the same build that has been out for months now, and it has only just gone for sale in stores. there is NO retail final version. you can get the official ISOs from MSDN at this torrent, both 32-bit and 64-bit:
https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7764223/

This torrent is some pre-cracked version with removed activation technology, just read the description. you are better off with the 180-day KMS and the untouched ISO until a permanent activation method comes up.

I hope this alleviates some confusion"
,MsLFi,2012-10-27T15:14Z,"shirepirate: Thanks for the information! That`s very useful. Maybe you can say or these http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7510301/Windows_8_RTM_final_professional_x86___x64_ is original ISO`s from MSDN?

And - does it is dangerous to use my Microsoft account when I have activted Windows with KMS
?"
,crybaby95,2012-10-27T15:36Z,RTM = FINAL!!!
,vaggg76,2012-10-27T16:16Z,so it an activation issue.eveything else is the same... kms witch i used activates only for 180 days. this pre-cracked version has a permanent activation????

,maxmicah,2012-10-27T18:09Z,Wait so im confused its RTM but you can activate so its pretty much a pro copy? can you play games and EVERYTHING the pro copy can do?

Some error about being unable to install, looked it up it appears my disc was too scratched or burned too quickly. Anyways It wasn't at a point where it would've really done anything to the OS.

And it said that any changes would be null. I've had similar issues in the past with installing 7, and it never fucked up Vista or XP.

Any help would be great. I would use a USB but unfortunately I don't have a small enough ISO to fit on the 4gb which is all I have atm."

synopsis.....

WINDOWS 8 = not worth the shot

STICK WITH THE WINDOWS 7...

i'm sorry if i've left anyone offended.....these r just my personal views regarding windows 8....."
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-28T15:35Z,"raze you moron, idiots like you should be put to sleep so you cant spread youre disease of stupitidy around and infect others. RTM = Released To Manufacturing - i.e. Now ready to be released and burned on to CD.

So once more for all the stupid MF´s like raze, RTM=Final Build, until SP1 is released, then its called Service Pack 1=SP1. RTM->SP1-SP2etc.etc....."
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-10-28T15:42Z,"I love Windows 7, but I dont hate Windows 8 as some here need to do?

If you really miss a Startmenu, just buy Start8 from stardock, its almost better than the real Startmenu in Win7, you can mod it to be exactly the same if you want. There is a trial, cost like 3.5euro to buy full version, and if you are a total thief, wait for it to be cracked as well.

I like both OS, but I can agree to that it is buggy now in the beginning, I have this nasty BSOD when downloading with torrent software (no im not kidding), I get a NETIO.DLL bsod everytime I have lots of torrents downloading at the same time. Its like the netdriver/systemfiles cant handle the pressure? Or my NIC drivers, dont know, until that is fixed I wont go fully to Win8, but in time when Win8 gets more stable I will defnitely go to Win8. It is a good OS, not as bad as all the haters say. It just takes time to get used to it, and time to start to like it. Today I like it, specially after I got Start8 software. I didnt like Win8 at all at first... ;)"

If anyone installed (Anti-Virus) and you are seeing a black screen after you log-in. Here is what you need to do to fix that problem:
0: Go to Processes and select one (any) and right click and select Open file location to open explorer and go to control panel and uninstall your anti-virus.
1: Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete 
2: Run Task Manager
3: Select File from top menu and open (Run New Task)
4: Click Browse and Find the crack (Activator) and select and (Right-Click) and Run as Administrator. Y = yes.

After updates are installed you're OS will be deactivated so Run the Activator if so.
