Thanks for the up.

Got a quick question for you... What the fuck is wrong with that installer? :)

I mean it politely asks me where I would like the files to be installed, and then... it does it's own shit anyways... he he he...
I'm smiling, but I thought I'm going insane, I'm pointing it to G:garmin  instaler is done and the folder remains empty.
Wait I did a search thru all my drives and it finally finished...
...aha...ok... so basically, instead of Drive G: where I asked it to install, where I have over 200GB free space , it told me to  go fuck myself and installed it on C:Program files  where I have barely 2 GB left now... brilliant :)"
