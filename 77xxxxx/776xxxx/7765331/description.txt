*SSL support for Subject Alternative Names (SAN) has been added when verifying whether a certificate is valid for the connection.
*A number of issues with the reload logs feature have been fixed, including incorrect line indentation and missing lines at the end of a log in some situations.
*An issue with the split long messages feature has been fixed which occurred when handling color formats in some contexts.
*An Address Book bug that prevented removal of an existing timed unignore has been fixed.
