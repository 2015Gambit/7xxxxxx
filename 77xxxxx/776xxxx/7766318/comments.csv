,tmemphist,2012-10-28T10:45Z,"If I could just clarify a point...  I've seen this more than once and don't understand:

The current Activators Activate Windows 8 and the customisation menu is not activated or unlocked for use?

Or

Does it not unlock windows because it has not activated or unlocked the customisation?

************************************

The Windows 8 UI, formerly called the Metro Start Screen, is Microsoftâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s replacement for the Start menu, is where this customisation section is?  

Because that is just a Windows superficial colour and Areo etc... ?  is this what people are referring too as the customisation menu?"
,sliders7,2012-10-28T11:54Z,Why every activator doesn't activate the METRO UI Personalization?? can someone please show me the light?
