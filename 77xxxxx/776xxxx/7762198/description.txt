11)  Dragons Dinosaurs and Giant Snakes 
In the old maps charted by the first explorers of land and sea, the unknown areas of the globe were often marked by ominous warnings of danger like "here be dragons". Those intrepid men were the first to report on the existence of new animal species unknown to westerners until that moment. Some were captured and taken to European palaces for the amazement of kings and queens, visible symbols of a new era of discovery. Many centuries have gone by and our Earth seems smaller due to the faster means of transportation we now possess, but there are many areas in the five continents where man has never been, especially in the dense jungles of Africa and South America or in the inaccessible forests of Siberia. As contradictory as it seems, many creatures of myth may still roam the untouched places of the world.
