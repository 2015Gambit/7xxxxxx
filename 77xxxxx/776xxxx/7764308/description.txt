Each moment, events take place that the human eye cannot perceive because these occurrences are too small, too large, too fast, too slow or beyond the spectrum of visible light. Witness some of the captivating sights that will forever alter your knowledge and perception of the world around us. This 1979 classic video shows us that 'hidden' world. Different sizes, different spectrums, and even different rates of speed can illuminate the underlying processes that are beyond the limits of our eyes.
