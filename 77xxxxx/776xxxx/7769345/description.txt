NOTE: THIS WILL BE A SLOW UPLOAD, POSSIBLY TAKING A WEEK!  I do not have constant Internet access, as I am a poor college student who cannot afford it.  I only have access at the library or at a friend's house.  Please be patient and grateful, not whiners!

NOTE: Download VLC Media Player to watch this: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/#download

NOTE: English Subtitles are muxed into the mkv files.  They are off by default, but if you want them on, simply tap the V key if viewing in VLC.  If you want French, Spanish, German, or Japanese subtitles, do the following: Right Click, Subtitle, Open File.  Then go to the folder named Various Subtitles and choose the correct subtitle.  It does not matter if you choose the idx or the sub file as the subtitle, but you need both of them for the subtitles to work.

Enjoy, please seed, rate, and comment!  AND PLEASE BE PATIENT!
