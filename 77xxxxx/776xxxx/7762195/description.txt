Deer Hunter 2005 - N2KMaster Portablez


What was done here:
-------------------
Its precracked. No serials, no patching, no loaders, no messing with the host files, etc. The No-CD crack is preinstalled with it. No muss, no fuss

System Requirements:
--------------------
I recommend this,
128 Meg Video Card, Pentium 4 class computer (2.0 GHz or better), 512 Meg Ram
Its been tested on Windows XP x64 and x32, have no idea about Vista or 7. Can't see why it wouldn't.

Is the online working?
----------------------
Yuppers, uses Gamespy network, and I've already seen a few from here playing on the servers ;P 

Directions:
-----------
Run the executable, when prompted for extraction path put it wherever, hard drive or USB stick, then run the DH2005.exe file inside the folder its made. Enjoy!
