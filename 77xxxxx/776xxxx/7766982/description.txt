'Now, Endsville... and other stories'

Kitchen Sink Press, 1993

Written and Illustrate by Carol Lay

Lay has labored on the fringes of the alternative comic scene for more than a decade. A few years ago, she landed a regular gig drawing a weekly strip for a handful of alternative weeklies, and those efforts make up this first collection of her work. Two serials reedited seamlessly into full-length stories, however, best show off Lay's imagination: in the title story, the heroine braves the afterlife to rescue the soul of her comatose boyfriend, while "Invisible City" is an epic tale about the blind potion-maker Madame Asgar and a lost tribe in the South American rain forest. All the stories are well-crafted, attractively drawn, and entertaining.
