Your goal in the second part of Avatar Forest Fight online game is to destroy your opponents fortress in battle before they destroy yours!
Use YOUR FINGER to choose a bending power, then choose a weapon, aim your weapon and press and hold FINGER to power up/down, then release to fire. Bending powers are primarily defensive in nature. You can target the Bending Masters Tower to impair your opponents bending power. Each fortress projectiles have unique capabilities. Try to target your opponents armory to reduce their weapon supply.
