,Michel88974,2012-10-27T14:02Z,Wrye Bash says that update.esm is corrupt... true or false?
,Michel88974,2012-10-27T14:17Z,Wrye Bash says update.esm is corrupt... is it true?
,ab00,2012-10-27T19:26Z,"@Michel88974

hmm. it's not corrupt but the header version is wrong. 
You can fix it yourself by changing it with TESVSnip. Change the header file version from 1,7 to 0,94 for Update.esm. Remember to save."
