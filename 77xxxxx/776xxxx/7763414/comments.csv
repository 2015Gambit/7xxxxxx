,45rpm,2012-10-28T17:33Z,I know this torrent has been downloaded completely a number of times and now only a couple of seeders.  Makes a guy want to give up. Too many leeches. 
,kbslab,2012-10-28T19:51Z,"We are stuck at 99.7 . Someone with the 100% please seed for a few minits so the rest of us can get 100% too, then we can keep this torrent going"
,kbslab,2012-10-28T19:55Z,"45rpm, please seed for a few more minits so some of us can get to 100%, so we can keep this torrent alive"
,45rpm,2012-10-28T21:17Z,I never stopped seeding.
,45rpm,2012-10-28T22:09Z,I have created a re-up.  :) You're welcome.
