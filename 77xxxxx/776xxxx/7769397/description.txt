About:
Sometimes the most compelling art can come from lifeΓÇÖs greatest struggles, which in the case of Tooth & Nail newcomers I Am Empire, only added fuel to the groupΓÇÖs already blazing alternative rock fire. Though the San Jose-bred fivesome had no trouble igniting the local scene since forming in 2008, including dates alongside Flyleaf, Sublime, Deftones, Silversun Pickups and The Wedding, a pair of charting singles (ΓÇ£YouΓÇÖre A FakeΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£The ElevatorΓÇ¥), plus additional acclaim from Alternative Press, AOLΓÇÖs Spinner.com and San FranciscoΓÇÖs LIVE105 radio station, much of the catalyst behind the bandΓÇÖs label debut Kings stems from front man Austin LyonsΓÇÖ fractured upbringing. I Am Empire blends a passionate Rock vibe with a balance of hooks that will be ringing through your head for years.
