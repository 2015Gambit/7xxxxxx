Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 231 seed,(im never having a go at the uploader ! )  if you  find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb.com  info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out (eg if its porn what type eg lesbien) ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc ( copy and paste this comment & save it in a word document or open office or a draft email & then paste it as a reminder to people to be helpful on every torrent you look at â&#x20AC;Ś 1 by 1 teaching selfish snatch & grabbers to help out) "

,LordGod88,2012-11-14T08:11Z,"To sync the sound use VLC player.  Go to the audio section-  there are sync controls.

You're welcome."
