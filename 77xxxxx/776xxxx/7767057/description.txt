Synopsis
Henry Harper is a successful novelist who has it all. But after surviving a recent
trauma he finds himself haunted by a dream that terrifies him. Convinced that the
only way to understand what the dream means is to write his way through it, Henry
decides to go to a remote second home to begin work on his next novel, a thriller.
While on his way there he encounters a strangely familiar drifter who confronts
him with information that threatens to turn everything he knows to be true, upside
down.
