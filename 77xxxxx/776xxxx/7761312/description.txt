Talk on Corners is the second album by Irish band The Corrs, released in 1997. The name 
of the album is derived from a line from the album's song "Queen of Hollywood".

    "And her friends they talk on corners, they could never comprehend"

After its release, songs from this album were to dominate their live set for a long time 
to come and through the biggest growth period of the band's career. During this album's 
long reign, they worked solidly with very little time off and gained a lot of exposure 
with TV appearances and tours. Their next studio album took nearly 3 years to materialise. 
In between was a live 'unplugged' album which introduced only a handful of new songs. 
Hence their continuing reliance on existing material, some of which became subject to 
rearranging or remixing along the way.
