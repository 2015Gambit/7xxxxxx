Capper note:
I love the different series that Chris and John have produced over the years.
But I think this HALLOWEEN SUPERSTAR series is my favourite of the bunch. 
It's from 2009.
Unfortunately a followup season was never made (yet..), but I still love watching it every October!

Show description:
Chris & JohnΓÇÖs Halloween Superstar! 
In their 3 seasons of the hugely popular series ΓÇ£Chris & John to the Rescue!ΓÇ¥, best friends Chris & John have carved a niche as culture aficionados and budding philanthropists, coming to the aid of people in desperate need of makeovers, matchmaking and everything in between. But this duo have decided to take on their biggest mission yet: crowning the next Halloween Superstar! 

A campy romp celebrating the ΓÇ£gay holy holidayΓÇ¥, the series finds 6 contestants from across North America vying for the title of Halloween Superstar. Each week, contestants will be put through grueling challenges, testing their true love of all things witches and goblins. From elaborate pumpkin carving, to trivia, and the big finale Masquerade Ball, it will be a race to the finish!

Chris & John's love of Halloween is met with great enthusiasm. Comments Chris, "I love Halloween in all forms - the fashions, the food and especially the Jamie Lee Curtis-starring horror films." John concurs, "Yeah, we love Jamie Lee!" Expect to see the duo's quirky charm infused with the macabre. "We're experts in dark sided stuff, so our six 'Spooktestants', as we call them, will really have to work hard if they want to be crowed the winner," John remarks. Production on the 4 half-hour episodes took place this September, in Salem, Massachusetts, home of the infamous 1692 Salem Witch Trials, and currently known as the Halloween capital of the world.
