                To Unpack/Rebuild ]-                           
              ( Our Install.exe Does This Step For You )

Notes:                                                         
                                                               
                                                               
We Recommend Installing To A Short Path (Like The Install.exe  
Default) As Long Path Names Can Cause Missing Files On Certain 
Games During Rebuild.                                          
Unless You Changed It The Default Extraction Folder Install.exe
Creates Is C:/Games/                                           
This Is Were You Can Find The Games exe.                       
If Install/Rebuild Seems To Freeze Leave It Alone.             
Install/Rebuild Is Normally Very Time/Space Consuming.         
(So Ensure You Have Pleanty Of Space And Patience)
