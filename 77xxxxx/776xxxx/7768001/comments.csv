Yes you heard it right, its possible now just follow some of these simple steps:

1). Activate your copy of windows with a MAK or KMS method
2). To activate windows using KMS server, run Command Prompt (CMD) as Admin
and enter the following in the given order:
slmgr /ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms 147.134.1.42:1688
slmgr.vbs -ato
slmgr /ckms
If the server is running then you will be activated for 180 days.
3). Visit http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs and get
your legit free key for an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro with Windows Media Center.
4). Now right click on extreme lower left corner of your screen and go to ""System"".
5). Click on ""Get more features with a new edition of Windows"" and

,bhichandi,2012-11-04T23:34Z,Thank you so much! Installed successfully on 64 bit. No problem with that. But Activator didnt work for me. But then I activated through KMS Servers method which activated it for 6 months. And then I activated it by going to http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/feature-packs and entering my email address. After that you'll get an email. Follow the instruction and it will restart. Then simply run the command prompt as admin and type 'slui' .. Its activated for life !

This iso has been floating around the internet for a week or so, but it is definitely not retail.

Someone removed the win8core, tacked on a winx64 pro and called it a retail AIO.  Honestly I don't even know if you can install the x64 version.

For the multi-langs, you can get the torrent straight from the source:

	 Windows 7 Ultimate cannot be upgraded to Windows 8 Pro with Media Center. You can choose to install a new copy of Windows 8 Pro with Media Center instead, but this is different from an upgrade and does not keep your files, settings and programs. You’ll need to reinstall any programs using the original installation discs or files. To save your files before installing Windows, back them up to an external location such as a CD, DVD or external hard drive. To install a new copy of Windows 8 Pro with Media Center, click the Back button in the upper left-hand corner, and select “Custom (advanced)”.

,Aphonic,2012-11-13T21:57Z,"Guys,

Do NOT use the activator included in this torrent.  Research KMS activation instead.  This 'hack'tivator doesn't actually do anything.  It just modifies a few system files in order to appear as though your copy is activated, when in reality it is not.  Who knows what else this thing is doing.

If you don't believe me, then try this simple test.  Any normal activator does NOT need to modify your system files in any way to activate windows.  After using it, open your command prompt as administrator and type the following command:

sfc /scannow

It will scan the system and show you that system files were corrupt.  This is from that activator.

Again, research KMS activation.  I'll even include a link.  Happy sharing!

,thewallofterror,2012-11-14T07:37Z,"Ok, got this to work. A few pointers before I give a guide is that I wiped my external HDD with XP and left win 7 on my external for testing purposes. I DID NOT USE THE PATCH INCLUDED HERE. I used the patch from this up http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7786020/Windows_8_AIO_16-in-1_(Final_Build_9200)___Permanent_Activator (as a side note, when downloading this torrent, make sure you click skip for all the other crap except for the activator).

Step 1: After download finishes, burn iso to DVD using isoburn or whatever tool suits your needs (I set the burn speed to 2x. The slower the better as there's less chance that something will get spazzed during the burn process).

Step 2: After burn, insert DVD and wait for autorun to start. After that follow instructions and install (When it gets to the part about what installation type you want, click custom install as this will do a clean install, rather than an upgrade. Or at least, that's what I did).

Step 3: Wait for installation to finish. This may take a while. I took about an hour for it to install for me.

Step 4: After installation has completed, find the folder with your activator. Click on install/uninstall and follow the CMD prompts.

Presto! You should have a fully activated Windows 8.

As a side note (again): If you cannot personalize your settings, you'll need to run the fix included in the link i pasted earlier. I didn't need to use the fix, but it's there in case you all need it (i take no credit for the uploads on the other page or this one as neither are my work).

Thanks to the uploaders for their hard work. Really appreciate Bros/Brodettes.

Let me know if you guys/gals need help. I'll check back periodically to assist."
