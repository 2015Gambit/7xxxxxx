,Dieselakoc,2012-10-27T07:22Z,"When I insert the burned WWE 13 in my xbox 360 I get the message for the update I press no cause I know I it will crash my xbox but I dont know how to skip it, someone help me pls"
,vorphalack,2012-10-27T09:18Z,i have the same problem that Dieselakoc
,galaxybay,2012-10-27T09:19Z,"@Dieselakoc yes you have to update your xbox 360 dashboard to atleast 15574 in order to play this game or any other new title .

This game has a mandatory 15574 dashboard update built in it. If your console has an older dashboard you are going to be prompted to update it.

If you try to play this game on LT+ 2.0 you will be prompted to update your console. If you do that, your xbox’s dae.bin will be updated. The affect of this update varies for every console. So either you will still be able to play every XGD3 game on LT+ 2.0, or all your XGD3 games will stop working and you will have to upgrade your firmware.


its a small risk ... i have lt2.0 and i upgraded it successfully using game disk ..... you can use USB too ."
,vorphalack,2012-10-27T09:47Z,@galaxybay you said that you installed the update that comes with the game and you still are able to play backups? i have an old dashboard 13k something and i dont want to lose my flashing
,galaxybay,2012-10-27T11:50Z,"@vorphalack just follow it 

Q: On which firmware can i run this?
Ans: This game has a mandatory 15574 dashboard update built in it. If your console has an older dashboard you are going to be prompted to update it.

Q: So does this mean that LT+ 2.0 wont be able to run this?
Ans: This is partially correct. If you try to play this game on LT+ 2.0 you will be prompted to update your console. If you do that, your xbox’s dae.bin will be updated. The affect of this update varies for every console. So either you will still be able to play every XGD3 game on LT+ 2.0, or all your XGD3 games will stop working and you will have to upgrade your firmware.

Q: What will this new dae.bin do?
Ans: There are two main affects of this dae.bin update. First one has been explained above. Secondly, you will loose the ability to install truncated games to your console’s HDD.

Q: I get a ‘disc is unauthorized’ message, what is this?
Ans: You are getting this error because your console’s dae.bin has been updated and you are truncating your game. To install games on your xbox, you’ll have to burn them properly with a liteon ihas dvd writer.

Q: Should i upgrade my dashboard if i have LT+ 3.0?

Ans: Yes, LT+ 3.0 is not affected by this dashboard/update.

Q: Should i run this game through abgx?

Ans: Yes. You should run every XGD3 game through abgx360 so that you can check whether the iso is corrupted or not. Make sure you use the latest version of abgx360.

Q: Why does abgx360 1.0.6 say that verification of this game failed?

Ans: Dont worry about that. You are getting that message because this game hasn’t been added to abgx’s database yet. As soon as it is added your entire log will be green.
Please note that if a game’s SS & DMI files are valid, it has been patched with the topology data and if there is no CrC corruption then that ISO is safe to play.

Q: How should i burn this game?

Ans: I have added a tutorial inside the rar files, please read it.

Q: Abgx says that ‘there is no verified rip in the database’ for this game. Is it safe to play this game?

Ans: Abgx is showing this message because this game isn’t present in their database at the moment. Even if a game isn’t present in their database, as long as its SS & DMI are valid
and if it passes basic stealth checks. it is safe to play that game.

Q: I have a pre 78-79 hitachi/ Samsung with LT+ 2.0b will i be able to play this game?

Ans: Yes, as your console is immune to every ap2.5 check you can play this game online and offline safely. Just make sure that you burn your games properly.

Q: Should i go and play XGD3 games online?

Ans: You should only play XGD3 games online if you have burnt them with a Liteon IHAS dvd writer flashed with Burner MAX firmware. Truncated burns are NOT safe online."
,galaxybay,2012-10-27T11:56Z,every new game title from NBA 2K 13 is built on 15574 dashboard . so every new comer will ask for an update if you do not upgrade your dashboard to 15574  ... if you are on lt3.0 then you should upgrade your dashboard because LT+ 3.0 is not affected by this dashboard/update.
,galaxybay,2012-10-27T12:01Z,"@vorphalack yeah i told you that i successfully upgraded my lt2.0 firmware console to dashboard 15574 and im still playing all my back-ups like ufc 3 & 2010 , mw3 ,BF3 , 2k 12 etc etc but still upgrading the dashboard on lt2.0 is a risk . its only can be decided by you , not me :)"

,vorphalack,2012-10-29T21:13Z,@Slayer1221 did you installed the game to your hdd? because it will not work with truncated games unless you burn it with a liteon ihas burner
