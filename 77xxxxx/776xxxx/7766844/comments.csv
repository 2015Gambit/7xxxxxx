 if anyone has a way to make it work, I would be pleased to hear it.

Another thing, when installed, the shortcut of the game opens Steam on the community page of Dishonored. I don't think it's a good thing ._."
,Foolrkrum,2012-10-29T21:18Z, Anyone know where to get the pre-order content? 
,elarithon,2012-10-29T21:55Z,@Foolrkrum I've been searching for that as well. No luck so far.
,Foolrkrum,2012-10-29T23:26Z,"Yeah, it pisses me off a little bit that there doesn't seem to be more scene interest in it. I really don't want to play the game until I can get the full package. D:"
