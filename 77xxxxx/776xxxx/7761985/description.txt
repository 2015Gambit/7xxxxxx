Weeds is an American television comedy.

Nancy Botwin is a single mother who lives in Agrestic, the fictional suburb of Los Angeles with her two children Silas (15) and Shane (10). After the untimely death of Judah--who died of a heart attack while jogging with their youngest son a few weeks before the series' pilot--Nancy begins dealing marijuana in order to support her upper middle class lifestyle. The series follows the ups and downs of Nancy's life with attempts to start a front to hide her selling, creating her own brand of weed called MILF, trying to stay out of jail and finding her own client base. Together with her children, her brother-in-law Andy and financial adviser Doug Wilson, Nancy gets into all kinds of trouble and always seems to pull through in the end.
