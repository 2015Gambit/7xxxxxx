*UPDATED*

I made a new torrent since I cannot delete the others for some reason and have included a manual. The link still works for additional material.

HeroQuest PC-Game

HeroQuest is a turn based computer game in a fantasy setting, Inspired on MB's and Games Workshop's board game 'HeroQuest'. It focuses on four different heroes working through various quests, encountering foes ranging from goblins to chaos warriors. You can play the original campaign, additional quests or wander the self generating magic dungeon. A user friendly quest editor is also included. Note: this is not the HeroQuest game published by Gremlin in 1992, but a new Allegro/DirectX game made by Gerwin Broers.
