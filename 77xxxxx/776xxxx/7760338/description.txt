[b]TVO - The Agenda with Steve Paikin, October 24 2012: Should Money Buy Everything?[/b]

You might not be able to buy love, but you can buy a kidney for a tidy sum. If everything is commodified, what do we lose as a society?

[u]Should Money Buy Everything?[/u]

Everything has value. Groceries. Cellphones. Now, in our market society, kidneys. What can't money buy? Do we want a society where everything is up for sale? Or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honour and money cannot buy? The Agenda examines the true cost of putting a price tag on everything.
