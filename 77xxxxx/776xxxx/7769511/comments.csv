,sector007,2012-11-04T00:55Z,"On Windows 7 64-bit, I installed the game, overwrote steam_api.dll and added winderlands8.dll to the Win32 directory and I still get MSVCR100.dll error message:/"
,noekk,2012-11-09T05:39Z,I can't get this to work on Windows 8 Pro 32bit. When I hit Play in the launcher it closes and nothing happens. I did exactly as gutko wrote in the fifth post.
,l1p3_g4m3r,2012-11-10T18:33Z,Not working here too. Did exactly the instructions. Nothing happens!
,serper,2012-11-14T08:29Z,worked for me... Win8x64 Pro
,asqw9,2012-11-14T21:54Z,"""I still get MSVCR100.dll error""

Nothing to do with the crack. It means you didnt install Visual Studio 2010 which is necessary to play the game."
,GhostlyVG,2012-11-17T22:26Z,love you works ;)
