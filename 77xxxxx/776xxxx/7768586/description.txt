SimXpert is a next generation CAE application that empowers engineers to perform an expansive range of multidisciplinary simulations by delivering new tools that accelerate learning curves and shorten model preparation and setup times all within a fully integrated user environment. 

SimXpertΓÇÖs unified user environment also enables teams to share data, models, results and best practices across time zones, geographic boundaries, and CAE disciplines, so that they can approach problems more consistently and get reliable results faster. Complete teams of engineers can now work in a modern and easy to use interface to run multi-body dynamics, structural analysis, thermal simulations, crash tests, drop testing, and more.
