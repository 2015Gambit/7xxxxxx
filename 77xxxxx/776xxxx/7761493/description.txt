Game information

King's Bounty: Warriors of the North is  the  next  chapter  in  the  cult
RPG/adventure saga. The new tale takes place  in  the  familiar  world  of
Endoria featured in the previous games, but begins in  the  Viking  lands,

quest in King's Bounty: The Legend

The Mighty Olaf, son of the Konung of Northlings, has dedicated  his  life
to battling the undead who have infested the northern lands of Endoria. He
seeks to liberate the snowy wastes, dwarven dungeons, and the  very  heart

necromancy. On his quest towards immortal glory he will encounter  cunning
foes and new friends, hard battles and amazing adventures
