"" not a prob if a torrent image is not provided ""

Bayimg is down since a while and should be back within a couple of days , this is why no images can be uploaded on all torrents ."
,CMDDVats,2012-10-26T12:07Z,"@ DeGun 
thank You :-))"
,s1raz1,2012-10-26T12:46Z,"THX Xtremezone
U rock :D +1"
,Lardzor,2012-10-26T14:43Z,Looks like another Japanese role playing game with a Northern European theme. I'm sure all the Final Fantasy 7 fans will just love it.
,stephon_,2012-10-26T14:56Z,"works fine, thanks"
,CiobyKpK1,2012-10-26T16:35Z,"when I insert the image into my Daemon tools gadget, the drives disappear and even if I eject it, I cannot delete the image. Something is wrong with this torrent."
,IK1995,2012-10-26T18:22Z,"Extremezone , can you upload Fifa Manager 13 for PC, and if not, when will it be available??? Thanks in advance..."
,xepd00,2012-10-26T18:45Z,"The game crashes (at least for me) during a fight with Eric (maybe other places too), i wonder if they've made a patch for that"
,s1raz1,2012-10-26T20:17Z,"No crashes whatsoever, but this game uses a lot of RAM, far more than BL2 or dishonored, u need more than 4gb ram if u wanna play with high graph settings, regardless if u have a good video card."
,LRN,2012-10-26T21:59Z,"Yep, same here - crashes during the fight with Eric."
,Riftweaver81,2012-10-27T21:36Z,"Lardzor, please do some minor research before you make such stupid claims.. this game is nothing like FF7 at all.  its a grid/turn based strategy like the old heroes of might and magic games.

the game is fun, but im starting to get a lot of crashes during battle.. i've tried disabling the music, turning the graphic settings way down. but they still happen its very random too, so i dont think it is tied to any particular unit or anything"
,rysioxxx,2012-10-28T03:22Z,"up, got the same issue, is has something to do with the skald unit in the hero army, steam already patched it"
,LevitePomelo,2012-10-28T05:31Z,I am having the same issue whit EricÂ´s battle. I have no skalds though and EricÂ´s skald was dead when the crash happened...
,s1raz1,2012-10-28T06:41Z,"its on ur end, i can upload my savegame file, a caster hero on hard dificulty and not a single crash, everything maxed.
I save normally, it has a option of cloudsave wich i dont use. 
GAME ROCKS, very nice music"
,rysioxxx,2012-10-28T12:38Z,its not skald units itself thtas crashing but buffs that they give to others units
,Riftweaver81,2012-10-28T16:36Z,im pretty sure it has something to do with the skald unit. i stoped using them because of what rysioxxx said and i havent had a single crash yet.  before i was lucky to get through a battle without it crashing
,rysioxxx,2012-10-28T17:18Z,"the problem is: there are some battles later when your opponets will have skalds in their army, and the game will crash, steam issued a fix small 350kb file thats solves it, i wonder is flt is planning on realising an update on this one."
,s1raz1,2012-10-29T01:21Z,"yea, i got my first crash :/ when a skald opponent used a buff, that had an animation like a flag, i killed one of those units buffed and crashed.
Safest workaround, kill that sob asap or use scare spell.
The first valkirie has a treasure trap very powerful, it will kill a lv 1 unit pretty quick"
,Spawnas,2012-10-29T03:02Z,Easiest way to deal with skald's and not crash is magic shackle spell.
,medeni73,2012-10-29T13:53Z,"There is repack with version 1.3.1 (included fix for crash issue) in King's Bounty: Warriors of the North v1.3.1 (2012/multi2/Repack by RG Catalyst)
but I havent seen torrent for it yet..."
,bangonwax,2012-10-29T17:19Z,"When installation starts, after a few secs, an error pops out - ""The source file is corrupted."" on animations.kfs file. As far as I see, I`m the only one with this prob. Somebody had something similar?"
,haveaquestion,2012-11-04T03:28Z,!!!CRASH!!! GOOD GAME!!!
,pkkkmix,2012-11-21T20:48Z,"Game works fine, got some issues.
Could someone rip patch 3 from steam and upload here."

,molderfox,2012-11-23T20:01Z,is there a cracked patch???
