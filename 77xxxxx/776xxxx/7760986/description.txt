Thanks to DIMENSION for the original source file, however MKV's do not work natively on PS3 so this has been given the SM10 touch. Converted to MPEG2 and re-synced to accommodate that change as configured a few filters to maximise colour on those bigger screens.
This is a regular upload of mine so feel free to revisit, subsequent weeks.

As always I will seed until 50-100 completes and then the rest is down to you as I will be using my speeds elsewhere. Thanks in advance and leave a comment or visit the Facebook page to leave feedback:-
