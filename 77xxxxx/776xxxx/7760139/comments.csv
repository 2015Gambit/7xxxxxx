Download this fix from the guys who made that game 
http://www.teamtnt.com/other/tnt31fix.zip and unzip it and load the wad like this in the TNT folder:
DOOM2 -FILE TNT31.WAD"
,LyleLyleMrLyle,2012-11-24T13:52Z,You can buy them now in Steam for a acceptable price. However you might not get the Master Levels with Doom II as before.
