Since Bethesta and ID seemed to like to play "George Lucas" and badly edit and/or remove the classic doom games, here they are the good old Doom games for DOS.
That you can only get them in a overpriced package nowadays.

Includes
-The First Doom (Ultimate Edition)
-Doom II
-Both Final Doom games.
-The Master levels.

Try them on a old PC or DOSBOX.

And if ID and Bethesta change ideas and makes these classics easly availabe, please buy them, they are worth that and there is no better way to prove their worth to their owners.

Download and Seed, thank you and you are welcome ;)
