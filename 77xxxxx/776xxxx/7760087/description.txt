The world has ended. There is no hope. No new beginning. Only the
 survivors. DEADLIGHT follows the journey of Randall Wayne, a man searching
 for his family across Seattle during the aftermath of a 1980s event that
 has decimated life on earth. This visually stunning Cinematic Survival
 Platformer will challenge you to run, jump, climb, and struggle for your
 life as you look for answers and the ones you love
