Mockingbird Lane was an attempt to update The Munsters for an audience that likes Once Upon a Time and True Blood ΓÇö is there such an audience? Apparently NBC didnΓÇÖt think so, because the proposed series doesnΓÇÖt seem to have a green light from NBC. Instead, the network aired this pilot on Friday evening. It was smart and colorful ΓÇö which makes sense, since producer Bryan Fuller (Pushing Daisies) was behind it, but it also didnΓÇÖt feel as though all of its elements had come together to make it clear where such a weekly series might go.
