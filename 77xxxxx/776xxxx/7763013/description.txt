BBC Mud, sweat and Tractors: The Story of Agriculture 
The history of modern farming in Britain is presented through individual stories of man s relationship with the land. The series charts the revolution that food production in Britain underwent in the 20th Century, and examines the impact this had on the lives of farmers and consumers alike. With episodes focusing on milk, fruit and vegetables, wheat, and beef, as well as intimate and touching home movies recorded at the time, the series provides an original and largely unseen record of a century of revolution on the land. 
This is a brilliant documentary series: with its use of archive home video it is both a loving and moving memorial to times long gone --The Times
Strange but true - in the 1950s, strawberries were virtually the size of apples. It's a fact you can verify for yourself in this excellent social history series" --The Guardian
Shorlisted for the Best History Documentary Grierson Award

The changing methods of growing, picking and selling produce is told through three staples of the British landscape: apples, strawberries and tomatoes.
