Although the title suggests otherwise, the story is actually science fiction, reminiscent of A Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Mackenize Queen is chosen by ΓÇ£the brotherhoodΓÇ¥ to save the world against the Ice Men who, having destroyed their own planet, would take Earth for themselves. Queen is assisted by an seven-foot tall alien called Ududu, who is a friendly carnivore and who also provides much of the comic relief for the story.
