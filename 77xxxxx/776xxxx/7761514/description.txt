I only recently discovered Bones...a wonderful series.

The package at https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6409905/Bones_%5BSeason_1_-_6_COMPLETE%5D_x264_compression_-_YIFY was a great way for me to start with this series.

I found a few errors in this package, especially with regard to subtitles. So, as a way to "give back," I am uploading this package as a supplement to VIFY's great upload.

In most cases, I was able to find and tweak alternate subtitles that would work with VIFY's video files. In three cases, I was unable to find or easily create correct subtitles for VIFY's videos; in those cases, it was easier to create a new video/subtitle pair.
