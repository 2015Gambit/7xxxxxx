,Eridor3,2012-11-01T20:57Z,"Well... In first movie, sound is desync in about 1:45:35 :/ It is about one second earlier than picture. "
,Eridor3,2012-11-01T21:19Z,"Please tell me: Is anybody else have sound desynchronise in fellowship, from 1:45:38, for about 1s? Or just my torrent client download it wrong? Please tell me, because I don't know if I have to redownload it"
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-11-02T11:12Z,"Confirm that sync problem :(
I guess that it is the same on all torrent because the same source :(

I hit ""K"" in VLC to 1000 ms  and that do it so its sync:)

Hope you will get to work !"
