I hope you continue sharing, looking forward to season 4. Once I've collected all the missing episodes I plan on doing a monster torrent with S 1 - 12.
Will seed this one for a long time. Keep up the good work!"

Just checked my seeding ratio for season 3 and it's 16.864, will continue to seed for months to come.
Btw, the one file with the highest ratio I share is a 2.26 GB film with a 394.18 ratio, been seeding for roughly 1.5 years now."
