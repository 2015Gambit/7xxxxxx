Because you demanded it... Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters return! Fan-favorite writers Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti (Countdown, Jonah Hex) are joined by rising superstar artist Renato Arlem (Hawkgirl, Annihilation: Silver Surfer) and acclaimed cover artist Dave Johnson (100 bullets, Superman: Red Son) for a new miniseries that promises even more action and surprises than last year's UNCLE SAM AND THE FREEDOM FIGHTERS! Spinning out of events in Amazons Attack, Uncle Sam finds himself faced with a changing world and a country torn to pieces. How will he and his Freedom Fighters fit in as part of this new world order?
