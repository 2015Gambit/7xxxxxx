[V],SaM,2012-10-29T15:27Z,"dear p2p users in tpb..i was demoted from vip to trusted for a reason behind my understanding
(putting fb and twitter & extratorrent links in his description) which i was doing since ice age..and not only me but almost every uploader is doing so and more..i remember going thru tpb forum where they said it is ok to promote ur site or pages etc..and i dont see any upload rules prohibits such links..it is ok for eztv and tvteam etc to do it..some even invite people to sign up in their site..but for some reason and after many years SaM is not suppose to do it..i am sorry to say that i will stop sharing my work here if a valid reason is not given or my status is restored..for those who want to download my torrents u can find them in my home site or any other site until this thing is fixed..tc"
