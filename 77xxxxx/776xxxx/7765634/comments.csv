Can you upload just the DLC?
I can't use my old saves with this edition, and I have invested about 200 hours in my character :)
I'm sure most of us have.

Anyway, thanks for this, been looking since all the ones I can find links for on file hosts are down.

As for ""uploading just the DLC"" I imagine you'd need a different .rif and perhaps the data itself for each region... I haven't seen it floating around anywhere.

Imagine it works great on Rebug/ErmaC/Rogero."
