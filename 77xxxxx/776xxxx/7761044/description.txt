Just a word of note, this isn't attributable to me. This, in fact, belongs to the great and wonderful Tailsteak. Look his comics up, he's funny and all. He's also a tabletopper, a roleplayer, and he homebrewed a system for a Waterworld game. That is, a game based in the world of Waterworld. It's very little here, but can be easily expanded. Just a little thing I figured I'd distribute a bit.
