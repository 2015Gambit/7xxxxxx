,BKKJack,2012-10-27T15:46Z,"Is this the one with the cartoons in the back after the chapters about intolerance of other faiths, the oppression of women and need to destroy anything which criticizes this bullshit?"

baboo456  you are right except that Islam do not believe in the crucification and that Jesus is son of God or God himself. 

Jesus is one of the five Great Prophets Noah, Abraham , Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. Islam respects Virgin Mary more than Jews and many christians. 

Islam respects Jesus from being crucified or killed by his enemies. God raised Jesus to heaven and he will come back just before the end of Life on earth.

,toptenz,2012-10-27T19:27Z,"Islam respects all messengers and prophets from Adam and Noah to Moses, Jesus and Muhammad (peace be upon them). 
Muslims do not accept sarcasm of any prophet. 

Those are the people selected by God to convey his words to the human being. 
They suffered a lot during their lives (and up till NOW !!!) from the unbelievers. 

No muslim can accept the humiliation of any prophet. This is not worshipping, it is just RESPECT.
Human freedom does not mean unrespect or insulting everybody or everything."
,SomeGuy1999,2012-11-01T10:49Z,"Muhammad specialy suffered a lot while screwing 9 year old girls! Not to mention all the other wives, the Holy Koran has Suras ordering Muhammad to screw any woman he fancies, a Holy book indeed! Not to mention this glorious religions idea of heaven which puts any whorehouse in Amsterdam to shame!"

(They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it) Quran 61:8."
,toptenz,2012-11-01T19:19Z,"

The Prophet Muhammad  was a perfect example of an honest, just, merciful, compassionate, truthful, and brave human being. Though he was a man, he was far removed from all evil
characteristics and strove solely for the sake of God and His reward in the Hereafter. Moreover, in all his actions and dealings, he was ever mindful and fearful of God.

“My choice of Muhammad to lead the list of the world’s most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others, but he was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular levels”.

,pusslicker,2012-11-13T21:15Z,They would fuck you back. Never seen so much homosexuality as there is in the muslim world. Not that I'm against that. It's just that these muslim bastards are just as hypocritical as christians. All religions are shit. Well maybe buddhists are ok. They never bother me.
