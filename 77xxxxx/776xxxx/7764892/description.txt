ΓÇ£Those who close their eyes from light, hurt their eyes and do not hurt
the light ΓÇª those who close their mind and conscience against truth,
hurt their mind and conscience but do not hurt truth. Light is benefit for
your eyes not for the candle, and truth is benefit and good for the rightly
guided nor for the guide.ΓÇ¥
