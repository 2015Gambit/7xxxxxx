,fankoosh,2012-11-04T07:48Z,"just adding a comment for helping ppl asking :)

is it playable on LT+2 after patching with LT+2 Topology ?,  yes sure it is playable

do i have to check it before running it on LT+3?
yes check with ABGX1.0.6 & set autofix to level3 then burn

also game requires latest DB 15774 so for LT+3 it is ok to update from game disc , but for LT+2 if u have been offline & u never get any silent update so u can go ahead & update ur DB via USB method not from disc
