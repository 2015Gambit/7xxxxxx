[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-26T02:27Z,"No pixelation whatsoever in my encodes.

Only one source is at risk and I prescreen before posting and wait for the WEB-DL if necessary.

Sniff ... but I like to rant ...

Thank you for your patronage,

[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-26T04:09Z,"It starts with the word ""no"" - if that's all you wanted, why did you keep reading?

Why are you still reading?

,genocide44,2012-10-26T13:38Z,this encode was not pixelation glitch free there was a pixelation glitch at 09:24 not a good encode.
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-26T21:41Z,"Thank you genocide44.

When you're right, you're right. I don't know how I missed that. Watched it and still missed it - sheesh.

This was from a usually reliable source.

Posting a WEB-DL now.

Apologies to all, pardon the Smeg all over my face. 'Pixelation freak hoist by his own petard' (boom). That's one for me and zillions for you-know-who.
