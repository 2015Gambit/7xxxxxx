Entangled

Lister loses Rimmer in a game of poker to a group of Biologically Engineered 
Life Forms and in return gets an unwanted gift: a groinal exploder programmed 
to detonate in 24 hours unless Lister pays his debts. Meanwhile Kryten and Cat 
become quantum entangled and do everything in perfect unison.
