,DarthPawn,2012-10-26T21:40Z,"Some of you are really stupid. Anyone who thinks a new build came out today needs to do some research. Build 9200 is the final build, RTM=Read to Manufacture, that means final build. 9200 has been available since August. Check the wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8

Today is general availability for build 9200... "

,lwaikeong,2012-10-27T09:28Z,"RTM = final build. RTM and final build released on 26th has no difference. 9200 is the final.

So stop asking RTM or final release. Now most importantly, is how to activate the OS."
,medion68,2012-10-27T09:32Z,very rude. these people should be prevented to do such things.
,Tomzvvip,2012-10-27T10:44Z,Open this http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7764464/windows_8_loader it's windows 8 loader
[H],shirepirate,2012-10-27T14:43Z,"there is no ""official final"" build. the RTM (version 6.2.92001) is the same build that has been out for months now, and it has only just gone for sale in stores. there is NO retail final version. you can get the official ISOs from MSDN at this torrent, both 32-bit and 64-bit:
https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7764223/

Until a permanent activation method comes up the 180-day KMS solution is what is available.

I hope this alleviates some confusion. once again, this is the torrent you want for an untouched, retail ISO of Windows 8 professional:

Do not download it. Its old release Aug 15, 2012 not final."
,Tomzvvip,2012-10-27T15:58Z,Are you sure? Have you tried it?
,jack00000,2012-10-27T20:15Z,"====READ ME=====

I've tested it and it works great!

Ignore all the newbies and trolls comments.

1. Put disc in disc drive (Disc of this windows is bootable, fyi)
2. Enter key
3. Pick your hard drive for installation and wait for it to finish installing (Windows Setup Installing)
4. Customize and settings and DONE.
