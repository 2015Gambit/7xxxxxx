,amiga82,2012-10-27T14:47Z,"I only used Looks and Mojo for FCP X, don't test the rest"
,pryingeyes,2012-10-27T16:12Z,"Well, if you didn't test the rest, then you shouldn't have uploaded the rest. Come on, think a bit first."
,EXTRABIT,2012-10-27T17:03Z,Dont be rude. Lets just thank amiga82 for sharing this. :) right?
,thewojtek,2012-10-27T23:35Z,Just use serial: MBBF 1105 8711 3555 4633 for the whole suite.
,ClubQBall,2012-10-28T01:14Z,"""Don't be rude"" was the comment ... AND YET ... you were the very FIRST motherfucker to CRITICIZE the goddamned torrent.  And you did it fucking TWICE.  Pretty much the pot calling the kettle black, right?

@pryingeyes - Dude, I wholeheartedly agree with you.  TEST the shit first BEFORE you upload it."
