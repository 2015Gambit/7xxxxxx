Anyone with a Rapidshare or DepositFiles account and the ability to use blogger.com can ""enjoy the pleasure of sharing music for free"".

The one and only reason I persist with this site is because I'm a dirty pirate who likes sharing his treasure. I couldn't give a rat's arse about the f**king ""cause"". Regardless of what new laws The USA implements, piracy will always find a new way around it."
