Each time I choose to ""initial seed"" (which means only seed to people if they are uploading to others), the speed drops to essentially nothing because nobody is uploading to their fellow peers.  You have to choice to make this torrent go much faster by simply uploading to each other.  This torrent will take forever to finish is you choose not to upload to others."

Thanks for the upload.

However, you do NOT understand how ""initial seeding"" works!  Therefore you are drawing completely faulty conclusions.

Intial Seeding was a great idea in theory, but it mostly doesn't work well in practice (there are occasional exceptions). Using ""initial seeding"" almost never works well because of issues of uneven load and connectivity between nodes within a given swarm. Further, the standard sharing mode has been significantly improved over the years so ""initial seeding"" is almost always inferior to 'regular'.  Also, you definitely can not draw the conclusion that it only seeds to those who are sharing as the various P2P clients deal with ""initial seeding"" in different, usually inefficient ways.

I recommend NEVER using the ""initial seeding "" function.

Most other torrents go way faster, as peers upload a lot to each other.  Either way, its uploaded.  And you are most definitely welcome.  My buddy hooked me up with his usenet account, so I can upload pretty much anything out there.  Take care"
