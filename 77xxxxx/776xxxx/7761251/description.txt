Pinocchio's wish to become a real boy has finally come true! Too bad he's been left for dead in the middle of the Mediterranean with what's left of the Great Puppet Theater, and his beloved Carlotta has fallen into the clutches of the vampires' dark lord. Bereft of his never-ending supply of stakes, Pinocchio must rely on a few new friends to continue his crusade against the undead. But when the former slayer's shocking origin is revealed, will Pinocchio be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to rout the vampire scourge?
