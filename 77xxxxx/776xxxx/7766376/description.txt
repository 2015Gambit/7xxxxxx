VIDEO :
The video was encoded according to AVCHD specifications so I guess a DVD-R readable by your Blu-Ray player is doable.
The source is HD DVB-T, 1920p, also the TV logo wasn't broadcasted! Very few and almost unnoticable imperfections because of the reception (which was close to perfect), they should not be a concern.
