Lizard Lick Towing, seasons 1, 2, & 3.

There was a numbering mixup, and I want to see that the numbering gets fixed.  I often wondered why shows would be labeled Season 3 when they're actually season 2.  Or 2 when its actually 3.  I thought people were just stupid.  Truth is, the networks are doing it.


IMDB lists 3 seasons with 13 episodes per season.

TruTV lists 2 seasons with 26 episodes in 2nd season, and 13 in first.
