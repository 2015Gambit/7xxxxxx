The classic point and click games from Humongous Entertainment, including all three Pajama Sam games and all three Spy Fox games.

Spy Fox in Dry Cereal is taken from this torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6388623/Spy_Fox_in_Dry_Cereal_[ZimbiXEL]_(Win64-bit_Compatibile) and the other two are ripped from my own collection.

Dry Cereal will run in 64-bit Windows, but the others require an emulator such as ScummVM (http://www.scummvm.org/).

All files are ISO's, mount with a tool such as Virtual Clone Drive.

Seed these great games!
