Mockingbird Lane is a remake of the 1960s CBS sitcom 'The Munsters' that was 

developed for NBC by Dead Like Me and Pushing Daisies creator Bryan Fuller.

A reboot of The Munsters, it is intended to be written and executive produced by 

Fuller as a one-hour drama with "spectacular visuals." It is to explore the origins 

of the Munster family and to be darker and edgier, while retaining plenty of humor.

It is reported that the costumes and make-up for the characters will be 

heavily toned down to resemble humans.
