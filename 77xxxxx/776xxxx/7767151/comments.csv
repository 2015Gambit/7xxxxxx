,zer0t3ch,2012-10-28T18:57Z,"Should be. I have already distributed it to a few friends and they are still asking me about my gameplaying strategies. I'm sorry for slow upload speed. I was limiting it to really low because all of my torrents were ruining my bandwidth, but I'll see if I can't increase for this one. Please seed when done!"
