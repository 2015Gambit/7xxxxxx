This is a compilation of +15,000 data sheets for vacuum tube components along with a reference chart. The whole archive is organized both numerically and alphabetically to the reference chart. 
There is also a 450MB folder of vacuum tube literature about amps, transmitters, receivers and military reference charts and a few "how to" guides. Probably everything you would need to know about vacuum tubes to work with them easily and possibly every data sheet known to man, possibly. 
perfect edition for your own offline archives of electronics.
Enjoy!
