Description

In 1976 Australian businessman Kerry Packer, annoyed at not having been granted TV broadcasting rights by the Australian Cricket Board and fearing the game was dying, threw the cricket world into turmoil by secretly signing up fifty of the worlds best cricketers and creating World Series Cricket. He knew the players, who had been underpaid for years, were on the point of rebellion against the cricket authorities. His rebel games clashed head-on with official test matches, and the war was on. Despite poor crowds at first, a brave new world of sports broadcasting had begun, ushering in the era of one-day cricket played under lights. Howzat! Kerry Packers War tells the story of the bitter two-year cricket war between Packer, with his highly-paid elite professionals and the cricket Establishment doing its best to protect the hundred-year legacy of pride in the traditional nature of the poorly paid game. The result was to change cricket forever. World Series Cricket introduced into the game a dramatic new era of dynamism and elite professionalism and thrust cricket into the modern era, shaping the game we know today. Southern Stars John Edwards (Beaconsfield, Offspring, Paper Giants, Rush) and Mimi Butler (Rush) are producing Howzat! for the Nine Network. Daina Reid (Paper Giants) directs from a screenplay by Christopher Lee (Paper Giants).
