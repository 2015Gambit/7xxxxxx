O elenco traz Sônia Braga, David Sutcliffe, Antonio Sabato Jr. e mais um trio de atores argentinos. O filme conta a história de um cartunista que não é mais ele mesmo e pira quando o namorado o abandona. O The New York Times achou o filme um "shaky comic noir larded with soft-core sex".

Plagued by memories of his mysteriously departed boyfriend, a man travels all the way to Argentina for some closure in this comedic thriller. TV's David Sutcliffe plays Dean, a comic book artist living in relative comfort in Los Angeles, until an accidental fire destroys his domicile. With no place to live and an egregious case of writer's block, Dean decides to flee the States for South America, where his former lover Pablo (Antonio Sabato Jr.) has retreated without an explanation. Tracking down Pablo's aristocratic mother (Sonia Braga) only brings the attention of the police; Dean has better luck with Pablo's enigmatic neighbor Sofia (Celina Font) and her loose-cannon brother, although even they aren't what they seem.
