Windows-specific changes:

Clicking on the timebar ruler to locate the playhead while playing might cause an offset of 1-2 buffer periods between tracks. This has been fixed.
If multiple monitors were used in the past, the Mixer & Edit windows have their position stored in that location which would make them unavailable when only one monitor is connected. This has been fixed.
