New to town with a made up name in the angel city,
Chasing fortune and fame.
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.
You had it figured out since you were in school.
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.
So overnight you look like a sixtiesΓÇÖ queen.

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.

And theyΓÇÖll tell you now, youΓÇÖre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyΓÇÖll tell you now, youΓÇÖre the lucky one.
But can you tell me now, youΓÇÖre the lucky one.

Now itΓÇÖs big black cars, and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesnΓÇÖt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.

And they tell you that youΓÇÖre lucky.
But youΓÇÖre so confused,
Cause you donΓÇÖt feel pretty, you just feel used.
And all the young things line up to take your place.

Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if youΓÇÖll make it out alive.


And theyΓÇÖll tell you now, youΓÇÖre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyΓÇÖll tell you now, youΓÇÖre the lucky one.
Can you tell me now, youΓÇÖre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

It was a few years later, I showed up here.
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
And it took some time, but I understand it now.

ΓÇÿCause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,

Let me tell you now, youΓÇÖre the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, youΓÇÖre the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, youΓÇÖre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

And theyΓÇÖll tell you now, youΓÇÖre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyΓÇÖll tell you now, youΓÇÖre the lucky one.
And theyΓÇÖll tell you now, youΓÇÖre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh.

Thanks
