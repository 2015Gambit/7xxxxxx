Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, October 26 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the retraction issued by the globalist eugenicist Ted Turner, who said it was a good thing that U.S. soldiers are committing suicide in record numbers. 

Alex also covers the "tsunami of filth" that has left a putrid stain in high places as revelations into the perverse and criminal life of the late British TV presenter "Sir" Jimmy Savile burble to the surface. He also covers the storm of the century, Hurricane Sandy, as it moves ominously toward the east coast.
