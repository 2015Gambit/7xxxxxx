Eric Henderson is a decorated Army tactical officer. Woodrow Van Chelton is a goofy white guy with a guitar (but no band). His idea of detective work is hanging a suspect out a window. They are childhood friends who have lost touch with one another as they entered their teenage years. Now re-united after the deaths of their fathers in a helicopter crash they begin investigating the suspicious deaths, and become victims of a high-tech industrial accident that turns their bodies into pure energy. The metal gauntlets they each wear must be slammed together every 24 hours to reset their energy matrix, or their atoms will break apart and their bodies will fade away. Eric takes the code name "Quantum" to work undercover and find his fatherΓÇÖs killer. Woodrow wants to avenge his fatherΓÇÖs death too, but declares that as "code names are stupid", people can call him "Woody".
