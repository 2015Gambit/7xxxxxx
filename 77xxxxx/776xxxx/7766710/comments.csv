U.S.S.R. got caught with there pants down. A lot of screaming and shouting by the commies and they had to back down, they were wrong. There again the media made a BIG deal over nothing. "
[T],karmax264,2012-10-28T12:40Z,"Yes exactly, because a third world nation, just 90 miles off the coast of the US, having thermonuclear ballistic missiles is ""no big deal"".  Also you make Castro out to be inert or even passive, which is crazy considering the Cuban Revolution.  Castro wanted the nukes to prevent a US invasion, even Operation Northwoods was a consideration before the nuclear crisis.  And your right ""there was no war"", thats why they call it the COLD WAR.  I know you did not even watch this, I was not even close to being done uploading this.  Please shit somewhere else......you troll."
