,ThatTunechi,2012-10-29T07:41Z,Sir.Paul u really should increase the bit rate.i dont mind it for the ufc fights u upload but wwe with this bit rate and resolution is bad.the 352p vid that was uploaded is 1500 this is 1100 and the resolution 400p.all the other 400p wwe torrents are usually around 1400 and looks really good.if any1 agrees with me say so.he might increase the bit rate
