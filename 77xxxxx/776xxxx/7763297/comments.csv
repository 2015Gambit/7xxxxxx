The Color Combination Idea Inspired By Microsoft And The Usage Of My Checklist Only Open As PDF File, Other Purpose Blocked Due To Reduce The Chances Of Abuse And Limit The Checklist Only For Flight Simulation. If You Want You Can Use Any Tablet Or Ipad Or Secondary Device To Use My Checklist List During Flight. "

Excuse me, but what planet are you on? There are simply *millions* of free files (aircraft, sceneries, utilities) and documents out there for simming use and none of them are protected in such a heavy-handed way.

BTW: ""The thing that stops the aircraft is a BRAKE ... not a *break* ;-)"

If you'd saved it with an extension then we wouldn't have had the problem. Go ask your ""mom"" to teach you how to use a computer."

FSX uploads have really dropped off in frequency on this site so when all of you up-loaders finally get around to add something make sure it's something all of us have been requesting for months, don't waste our time. 

Thank you!"
