,shpunky,2012-11-09T06:28Z,Great download. Does anyone have The Passion (by same author) in audiobook?
,michilllie,2012-11-25T03:15Z,"It's called ""The Passage"", but, no, I don't have it. I had to read it. Am halfway through reading ""The Twelve"" when I just discovered this. And it's being read by Scott Brick, one of my favorite readers.  Now I'm torn. Should I finish reading or start listening...hmm...either way I'm downloading...THANKS!"
