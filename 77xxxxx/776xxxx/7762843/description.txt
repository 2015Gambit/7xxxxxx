The Chemical Brothers have, for nearly 20 years [does one dare call them veterans? Like
theyΓÇÖve been in a war or something?], been routinely fantastic on record. And to those
whoΓÇÖve lost themselves to the pairΓÇÖs phenomenal live show at any field-, warehouse
tent- or shed-held event, theyΓÇÖre possibly the most exciting musical experience to ever
unfold before oneΓÇÖs eyes.
