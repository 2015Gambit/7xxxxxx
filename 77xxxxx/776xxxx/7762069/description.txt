Sharafat | 1970 | Dharam~Hema Musical | Xvid | MP3 | Phantom

With the passing away of Rajesh's parents, Jagatram undertakes to look after him. He hopes that some day Rajesh will marry his daughter Rekha. He arranges Rajesh's employment with a local hostel, which Rajesh accepts. After being employed, Rajesh finds that his male students are distracted and unable to concentrate on their studies. He decides to investigate further, and finds out that they visit a prostitute named Chandni regularly. He puts a stop to this. And then Jagatram finds out that Rajesh has been frequenting Chandni's place almost every night, under the unbelievable pretext of teaching her to read and write.

The Mujra number, "Zamaane Mein Sharifon Ka, Aji Woh Haal Dekha, Ke Sharaafat Chodd Di Maine..." {trans.: "When I saw the way the righteous conduct themselves in this world, I gave up righteousness..."} sung by the great Lata Mangeshkar was a block-buster hit across the country and catapulted this movie's box-office earnings.
