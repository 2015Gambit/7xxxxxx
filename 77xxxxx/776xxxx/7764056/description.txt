Recap:
"Buts... are for pooping."

I can't believe this was the second time I'd heard the "here comes treble" gag this month. Do the writers of Modern Family and The Office get together every week and talk about the good old days when they were the hot kids on the block? Maybe they get a couple drinks down at some dirty watering hole off Ventura Blvd. and start swapping puns. "I got this great one. 'Here comes treble.' Do you get it? Because treble sounds like trouble?" "That's effing genius." I'm just saying there might be an echo chamber of mediocrity.
