Over Hawaii
The unique wonders of Hawaii are explored in this illuminating, off-the-beaten-path tour of Hawaii's six major Hawaiian Islands: Hawaii Island, Maui, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu and Kauai's. While popular visitor destinations such as Honolulu are highlighted, much of this captivating hour features areas that can be accessed only by helicopter-or the extremely adventurous hiker. The itinerary includes unspoiled rain forests, majestic valleys, otherworldly volcanic landscapes, spectacular sea cliffs, and idyllic beaches where turquoise waters meet pristine white sands. "Over Hawaii" also ventures under, diving into Hawaii's waters to visit coral reefs teeming with sea life. "Over Hawaii" celebrates not only the scenic beauty of Hawaii but its cultural heritage as well, featuring commentary by people who call Hawaii home and who tell the islands' stories from an authentically Hawaiian point of view. The soundtrack showcases a wide range of traditional and contemporary Hawaiian music. Blending breathtaking scenery with fascinating insights, "Over Hawaii" reveals the remarkable diversity of America's 50th state.
