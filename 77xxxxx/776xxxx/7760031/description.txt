   "China in Your Hand" is a song by T'Pau, released from their album "Bridge of Spies". A re-recorded version was released as a single in October 1987, spending five weeks at number 1 in the UK and is arguably the song for which the group is best known in their native Britain, though their debut single "Heart and Soul" was a much bigger hit in the United States. "China in Your Hand" was the 600th song to top the UK charts, and kept George Harrison's "Got My Mind Set on You" from hitting the top spot.
    "Heart and Soul" is a song by T'Pau. Featuring vocalist Carol Decker performing overlapping lyrics, the song was released as a single record in 1987, taken from the 1987 album "Bridge of Spies". Following its inclusion in a Pepe Jeans advert, the single reached #4 in both the US and UK charts.
