 Ram (Dhanush) and Janani (Shruthi Haasan) are 
 higher secondary students who fall for each   
 other. As they grow up, so does their         
 affinity for each other, and despite          
 opposition from the elders, they tie the knot.
 When they start a fresh life, problems        
 start to crop up. Not the usual mis-          
 understanding difficulties newly-married      
 couples would face. But this is of a different
 kind. Ram is forced to take a decision.       
 What follows is an emotional tale.
