,enonumus,2012-10-31T07:53Z,"Ok, I downloaded this version and compared various scenes against the 1.5GB UNIQUE version that was posted about a week ago, which I believe was used as the source for this (that or they both used the same mutual source).  Based on the OP's comments I expected this to be noticeably less saturated and for the dominant left channel audio to be corrected.  Unfortunately the dominant left channel audio sounded the same, and I can't say that I noticed much if any difference in the saturation in the scenes I compared.  What I DID notice was that the dramatically lower bitrate in this version was clearly evident with the loss of detail, artifacting, and some macro blocking.  Between the two I would definitely recommend the 1.5GB UNIQUE version."
