Release Notes:
Plot :

In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and several Americans are taken hostage. However, six manage to escape to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA is eventually ordered to get them out of the country. With few options, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez devises a daring plan: to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew. With the help of some trusted Hollywood contacts, Mendez creates the ruse and proceeds to Iran as its associate producer. However, time is running out with the Iranian security forces closing in on the truth while both his charges and the White House have grave doubts about the operation themselves.

NOTES!
I work on the video source and use some filtered to change the saturation,  brightness, contrast and color, change the AR for a better view,
and finally sync the audio. English hardsub for some foreign parts.
So this is my version, high quality and small size> fast download,
take`it or leave`it.
