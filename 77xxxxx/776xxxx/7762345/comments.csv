TY"
,m4TTl00m,2012-10-26T17:29Z,Can this be watched on a regular laptop or does the screen have to be 3D enabled? Please help!
,Gotarock,2012-10-26T20:22Z,"@m4TT100m, Most people wont help you in this question because of all the learning and searching they have to do, Google does wonders, But you have to have a T.V that will play this, or get the Powerdvd 11 Player to read this, but really why do that when it reads an avi file, but then you need the red-green glasses to watch anyways.. What I do is just get the avi file of your choice and play it in the Powerdvd and use the glasses, works great,, Hope that helps..."

Download Stereoscopic player from TPB and seed it pls, you may use it to play sbs in cyan/red or 2d and go to your nearest book store and buy blue/cyan acetate and use them as frames  to make 3d glasses and enjoy :)"
