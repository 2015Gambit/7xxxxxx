[V],catflap,2012-10-27T17:38Z,":( sorry.

i can't locate my dvd as everything is in boxes
because of a recent move. i have literally
thousands of dvds, looked through a few
boxes, can't find it now.

there are a couple of other torrents here
with the full series, but they're in
xvid asd. they seem to have enough seeds
so you can take the last ep from them
and convert it if you like."
[V],catflap,2012-10-27T17:39Z,if i find it in the next few days i'll rerip it.
[V],catflap,2012-10-29T10:01Z,"i found the disc.

i ripped it and encoded it three different times
with several ripping and encoding programs.

the vobs rip out in sync but the re-encoded
xvids are still out of sync. no idea why
this happens. you'll have to live with it and
see if your player has sync controls,
or get the xvid asd file i mentioned above."
