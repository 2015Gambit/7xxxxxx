This is a collection of the works of Charles Lindbergh. It contains the following texts:

The Spirit of St. Louis
Aviation, Geography, and Race
Aviation, the Cosmos and the Future of Man
A number of speeches against American entry in the second world war:
	America and European Wars
	Neutrality and War
	The Air Defence of America
	Our Drift Toward War
	Our Relationship with Europe
	Untitled Speech in New York
	Election Promises Should be Kept
	Who are the War Agitators
	What do we mean by Democracy and Freedom?

There are also some partial recordings of Lindbergh's speeches.  The book "Hitler, Churchill, and the Unnecessary War" has been included as an introduction to the reasons behind Lindbergh's politics; for more information see this torrent: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7662497/Books_on_world_war_2_and_the_holocaust

I have also included two works of Lindbergh's father (also named Charles A. Lindbergh); they are "Your Country At War," a book against the first world war, and "Banking and Currency and the Money Trust," a work against the financial industry.
