Information
------------------------------

A film by Shane West and Chris Doig

A documentary about the WWII aircraft the Beaufighter, the crews who maintained them and the thousands who helped produce them in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. The historic significance of the Beaufighter is immense, as along with the Kittyhawk, it was Australia's choice as its frontline attack aircraft. It was this craft that performed effectively in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, when the Allies attacked a Japanese landing party on March 3, 1943. One historian states that this battle was "the decisive aerial engagement of the war in the South West Pacific".

The Beaufighter proved to be one of the most successful strike aircraft in the Second World War. Fast, robust, quiet and deadly, they were nicknamed 'Whispering Death' by the Japanese. The indefatigable crews faced the rapidly advancing Japanese Imperial Forces at the northern gates of Australia. This story is based on RAAF 30 & 31 Attack Beaufighter Squadrons and was previously released by the 30 Squadron RAAF Association as "Whispering Death: Beaufighter, forgotten warhorse."
