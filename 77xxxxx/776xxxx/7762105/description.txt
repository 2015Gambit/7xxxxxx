Unabridged edition 2011 | 6 hours and 16 min | ISBN: 1452601100 | MP3 64 kbps 


Scott Cunningham's classic introduction to Wicca is about how to live life magically, spiritually, and wholly attuned with nature. It is a book of sense and common sense, not only about magick but also about religion and one of the most critical issues of today: how to achieve the much-needed and wholesome relationship with our Earth. Cunningham presents Wicca as it is today: a gentle, Earth-oriented religion dedicated to the Goddess and God. Wicca also includes Cunningham's own Book of Shadows.
