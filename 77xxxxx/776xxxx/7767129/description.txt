There is a war raging in India. A war whose      
end can't be seen.A war that isn't being waged   
by outsiders. The enemy is our own! The youth    
of the country are rebelling.. Against injustice,
against tyranny, against exploitation.Inequality 
will not be tolerated forever. There is anger,   
and there is deep social unrest. Our own         
countrymen are locked in the bloodiest           
armed mutiny this country has ever seen.         
Chakravyuh is the story of six extraordinary     
characters, each with an all-consuming dream..   
A promise.. A promise they will uphold above     
everything else.
