(putting fb and twitter & extratorrent links in his description) which i was doing since ice age..and not only me but almost every uploader is doing so and more..i remember going thru tpb forum where they said it is ok to promote ur site or pages etc..and i dont see any upload rules prohibits such links..it is ok for eztv and tvteam etc to do it..some even invite people to sign up in their site..but for some reason and after many years SaM is not suppose to do it..i am sorry to say that i will stop sharing my work here if a valid reason is not given or my status is restored..for those who want to download my torrents u can find them in my home site or any other site until this thing is fixed..tc"

,Jottan,2012-10-31T15:17Z,"n3xus420 vivaldi0>>> Bitching' in english on a swedish site about movies in hindi you don't have to download if you don't want to is a bit retarded. 

The pirate movement is about sharing culture and information, not restricting it. This particular movie is about unity and fighting the government and the corporations, maybe you would actually learn something from it (if your not beyond help that is)"
