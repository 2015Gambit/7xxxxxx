 Finally, after all these years, Mark Linett, an incredible audio engineer, has done a magnificent job of remixing Brian's tracks into glorious, wide stereo. The harmonies come sailing through like voices from heaven. Listen to the harmonies on "Vegetables," "Little Pad," "With Me Tonight," and "Whistle In" . There are subtle touches in the vocals never detected before, something I did not expect for an album I've been listening to since 1967! Brian's genius at not only composing but for devising harmonies is beautifully shown on this album.
