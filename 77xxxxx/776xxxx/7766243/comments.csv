,Felidae17,2012-10-28T09:35Z,"Thanks for your obstinacy!
Seems to wor but 'll ned a long time: at the moment between 24 weeks and a few years -)
I hope some will seed."
,pumpernickel,2012-10-28T10:56Z,"Well, lets hope. I am now stuck at 28.6% which means that I have reached much further than on the previous upload in all these  days since uploading ........"
,Gariban,2012-10-28T11:26Z,"Well... I am seeding at this moment, but i have a slow connection, about 60kb/s upload and i can't figure out, why so many leechers?"
,FS_Junkie,2012-10-28T12:04Z,"I don't think they're leechers ... maybe kust people flagged it to download but couldn't as there were no seeds .

Thanks for uploading/seeding :-)"
,FS_Junkie,2012-10-28T12:10Z,EDIT: Have you tried utorrent?
,Gariban,2012-10-28T12:51Z,"i use Bittorrent, isn't this the same?"
,pumpernickel,2012-10-28T14:03Z,"Just downloaded it and installed Vol. 1. Seems to work ok - thank you very much.

Now I am seeding with full power ;-)"
,Gariban,2012-10-28T14:21Z,"Thanks man, but i need more people to seed, because i can't seed for ever but I try to seed as long as possible. :)"

,FS_Junkie,2012-10-30T08:02Z,"@gariban - thanks for persevering!

BTW: utorrent is *like* bittorrent (but they're different programs altogether). It's free - and definitely worth a try. It may not suffer the same problems you've been having."
