,deathwisher08,2012-10-29T12:18Z,"if its 1080p, why is there black bars in the bottom and top? im a great fan. but its 3d, if it werent for the black bars it wud be great."

Those black bars are there because of the difference in aspect ratios. Movies are not shot on the same aspect ratio as 1920x1080. It is still Full HD if the horizontal resolution is 1920 pixels."

,spermnator13,2012-11-12T20:57Z,"V- 6/10 Its hillarious to spend 2000 eyros for a 3d 16:9 tv and in the same time watching a movie with 15cm of black bars above and under the image..I dont know if its bitration fault,the only think I know is that its simple rediculous.

A- 10/10 simple perfection

3d- 8/10 In some action scenes the 3d is even better than titanic and tangled,unfortunately in some other scenes the depth is almost unnoticable.

Generally,this movie if better than spiderman 1 and far far better than the crap spidermnan 2 and 3..."
,nithinjs,2012-11-17T15:56Z,"dont biliv spermnator..

video 9/10
audio 10/10

Movies are shot using 2.35:1 aspect ratio cameras(only imax uses 16:9)..So naturally black bars come.."
,spermnator13,2012-11-19T21:23Z,"very funny nithinjs.lets try writting in greek to check your spelling που θα ειρωνευτεις κιολας πουτανοσπερμα.

what about avatar 3d titanic 3d tangled 3d?no black bars there..its ridiculous to take advantage only the 60% of your screen with these shitty black bars..whoever decided it should be fired"
,VonWar,2012-11-24T14:16Z,"Thanks for the upload, BOZX! Good quality.

@spermnator13 ...give it up, already. Most LCD monitors have an aspect ratio of about 1.78:1. CRT monitors usually display at 1.25:1. The movie's aspect ratio is such that unless you have a very high ratio display of 2.35:1, the only way to eliminate letterbox(the black bars you so vehemently dislike) is through cropping which will also eliminate the outside edges of the image.

This release shows the entirety of the film as it was originally recorded; any modified version without letterbox would show less of the image."

The ""black bar"" aspect ratio is optimized for cinemas because ticket sales is much higher then bluray/dvd disc sales.

Titanic and avatar is show in imax format which is optimized for imax cinemas that just happen to have same aspect ratio and normal 16:9 tv:s

Btw I paid aprox 3300 euros for my tv ^^"
