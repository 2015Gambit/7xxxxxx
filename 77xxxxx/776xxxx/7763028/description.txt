Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda are dead. Now, upon the news of Detective Kerry&#x27;s murder, two seasoned FBI profilers, Agent Strahm and Agent Perez, arrive in the terrified community to assist the veteran Detective Hoffman in sifting through Jigsaw&#x27;s latest grisly remains and piecing together the puzzle.
