Text from the website:
The final push is being waged in the battleground states - we'll get a first-hand look at the ground game with governors from across the key swing states that will decide the outcome of the election: Gov. John Hickenlooper D-CO, Gov. Scott Walker R-WI and Gov. John Kasich R-OH.

As of today, there are only nine days left until election day. 
What issue will tip the scales in the final days? 
Which candidate has the momentum and how will they make their closing arguments? 

The Panel:

Rachel Maddow - MSNBC
David Brooks - NY Times columnist 
EJ Dionne - Washington Post columnist
