Machine Design presents the subject matter in an up-to-date and thorough manner with a strong design emphasis. This textbook emphasizes both failure theory and analysis as well as emphasizing the synthesis and design aspects of machine elements. The book points out the commonality of the analytical approaches needed to design a wide variety of elements and emphasizes the use of computer-aided engineering as an approach to the design and analysis of these classes of problems. About 100 new problems will be added throughout the book, and certain topics are updated and enhanced.
