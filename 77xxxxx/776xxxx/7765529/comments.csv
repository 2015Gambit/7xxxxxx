The exception is when you get below about 10 seeders, then the green download torrent link shows up. And that one will have the original trackers that the torrent originally had when uploaded.

Most uploaders have http trackers associated with their torrent, even thought they don't show up in the magnet.
So people who need an http tracker would be wise to just add a couple popular ones manually. It is very easy to do, just google it."
