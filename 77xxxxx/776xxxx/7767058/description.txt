If youΓÇÖre an app developer with a solid foundation in Objective-C, this book is an absolute mustΓÇöchances are very high that your companyΓÇÖs iOS applications are vulnerable to attack. ThatΓÇÖs because malicious attackers now use an arsenal of tools to reverse-engineer, trace, and manipulate applications in ways that most programmers arenΓÇÖt aware of.

This guide illustrates several types of iOS attacks, as well as the tools and techniques that hackers use. YouΓÇÖll learn best practices to help protect your applications, and discover how important it is to understand and strategize like your adversary.
