,JustRacey,2012-10-29T17:04Z,"Please check out Mockingbird Lane! See that NBC execs are a bunch of idiots! No wonder they are on the bottom of the ratings pile. They actually do a cecent remake of a show like the MUNSTERS (yeah that is what Mockingbird Lane is) that was cute and funny to begin with that actually gained a following the more it aired n the late 1960's and cancel the decent re-make BEFORE it even airs, but then there is a CRAP re-make like ""Beauty and the Beast"" that continues on the CW as a re-make of a really crappy show from CBS 1980's series. 

I'd rather watch what happens with Eddie and his new pet d(ragon)og ""Spot"" or even see the Addams family move in next door (technically behind them seeing their address is 1313 Cemetery lane) to the Munsters and see Grandpa Munster fall in love with Grandma Addams, or Wendy and Pugsley Addams go to school with Eddie Munster than see more supposed reality TV like the Kardashians!"
