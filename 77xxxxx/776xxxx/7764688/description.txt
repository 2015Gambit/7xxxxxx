At Business of Software 2007 Michael Pryor held an impromptu session on how to price your software. So many people turned up, and so many people kept on arriving, that by the time theyΓÇÖd introduced themselves there was no time left to talk about software pricing. IΓÇÖve had similar experiences; in fact, ΓÇ£How do I price my software?ΓÇ¥ is probably the most common question IΓÇÖm asked by software entrepreneurs and product managers. This handbook is an attempt to answer that question.
