,daynd,2012-10-26T04:34Z,"Soooo I'm getting about 20kB/s down right now. I never really seed that much because I'm kind of a prick but mainly because my ISP is constantly on my ass, even with additional precautions taken. With this however, I want you to know that if this is legit, I will seed to a 50:1 ratio or until the game's official release, whichever comes last ;). This should be so god damn amazing!"

,dudelove420,2012-10-29T05:23Z,"Parth, reflash your console to LT 3.0. If you do not have a decent disk drive get a benq or a liteon drive for your xbox: Note to check your xbox drive! I had a samsung drive in mine when I reflashed and most of my games were incompatible. Also, use a ihas burner (go on ebay and purchase one with burner max) This is the disk drive you want for burning games because it has the necessary chip to burn all xdg3 games: Note that you need a ""b"" model and research a little bit more if you have the money to spend and want a better version ihas ""b"" model."

but now it is showing the photo of the game on dashboard......which previously it was not
halo 4 ,medal of honor,fifa13 all are working"
,dudelove420,2012-10-29T22:18Z,"Parth, did you run your iso file through abgx360 (newest version)? This is needed for fixing any corruption in the iso you donwloaded. I use it with all my games and never have a problem and I do not have Ihas burner and am burning with Memorex disks at 4x."
,parth_,2012-10-29T23:07Z,"@dudelove420
yes i did run through abgx 
but i think the civ checks are after release of the game"
,parth_,2012-10-29T23:14Z,"@dudelove420
i mean that verification was failed......rest everything was patched"
,Mahman21,2012-10-30T01:43Z,"@parth

I used the abgx to fix up a few things it said it was missing then dont worry bout the verification as i burnt to disc and it works fine."
,Mahman21,2012-10-30T01:44Z,"@ massiakroz 

nah this dont work on pc."
,parth_,2012-10-30T02:30Z,"@mahman21
i have already burned a disc after running through abgx 360........but it is showing me unreadable disc on lt 3 using ihas"
,dudelove420,2012-10-30T19:51Z,"Parth, what type of disk drive do you have in your xbox?"
,dudelove420,2012-10-30T19:55Z,"Parth, burn another disk running it first through abgx360 again. go to the options tab and always make sure that verbosity level is medium and that you are set to the right region code in misc."
,dudelove420,2012-10-30T20:01Z,"Also make sure that under the options setting that these are all checked:

-Check and create dvd file
-Check stealth
-verify if stealth patches
-check fix video padding
-use color
-check for any dvd style game datacorruption
-check for updates and also include the csv
-check game partition csv if needed

Make sure that in the autofix that everything is checked and that the angles are adjusted to 3 degrees from ccrt target"
,Betelguise,2012-10-30T20:57Z,Seed more
,Mahman21,2012-10-30T22:03Z,"@ Parth

yea i used an ihas aswell. have u set abgx to level 3 ? maybe delete the .dvd file and use abgx again, make sure its set to level 3 and everything shuld pass except for the verification at the end."
,kugutsumin,2012-10-30T23:45Z,2 discs? God damn it... don't these companies realize these discs aren't cheap?
,parth_,2012-10-31T00:51Z,"thanx @dudelove420 and @Mahman21
FYI iam using verbatim singapore"
,rauth213,2012-10-31T06:41Z,"@parth
It could just be a bad burn.  I've had bad burns that passed verification before.  Try to install the game to harddrive.  If it fails, then it's a bad burn and just burn it again."
,Betelguise,2012-10-31T11:34Z,seed !
,alexei23,2012-11-01T03:39Z,This is being tracked...got an email from my ISP.
,Linard,2012-11-01T09:35Z,"is it  necessary to run abgx in order to play safe online?
I use Xkey and games run of Hard drive "
,goodoldie,2012-11-01T16:12Z,it says the disc is not supported....what should i do????
,stealthpancho,2012-11-02T07:52Z,I dl this but at the end the I get hex xxxx.ini is not in the data base in yello letters. Shoul I wait a bit and see if they get verified or what? If anyone have the right verified files can the give me a link to them her? I  can take it from there. TY AARRRRRR!!!
,Linard,2012-11-02T08:25Z,"to:goodoldie 

I use to get that when I had LT2.0
update to 3.0 or install Xkey and you are going to be headache free and save a lot of money on expensive media"

,tibyyy,2012-11-05T13:10Z,"Hello Guys! 

I'd like to ask that :  I have a Modified Fat Xbox, with  a  2.0.13599.0 Dashboard, and it's flashed with LT 2.0 or it may be LT 2.1 ( i dont know exactly). 
So it was last flashed and so updated last octobe(lately) or november. 

I can play with AP 2.5 games -patched disks y Agx- like Ass. Creed Bortherhood, and Fable 2. 

And the first XGD3 disks works fine too, like the Bat. Arkham City and the Revelations of Ass.Creed. (these disks are burned just natively, as they are downloaded, Without any patch)


So, will the iso (after burning to disks...:P) work with my xbox? Or I have to do new modifications? Dash Update? Newer flash? Newer Patches and burn process? 

Great thanks for the answers!!"

,MR209,2012-11-11T23:32Z,"coastering discs as well... ihas 424b with burner max..

,sowrolls,2012-11-20T03:30Z,"for dudelove420
it's not a good idea to change your DVD-rom(spoof)in you xbox console unless it's the same drive, unless  you want to get banned

And for tibyyy
i wouldn't even plug that in you probably have already been flagged for a ban, but you your Xbox is still letting you copy games to your hdd and your same saves work in another console you should be fine. you should put your DVD-ROM back to stock firmware, update the Xbox 360 dashboard to the newest one and the flash to 3.0 lt  and the make sure you at least  use abgx to test your iso's before and after you burn them. but for the new games that are over 7.8gb you will need a ihas 124XX version b to burn them properly


and if you can't game the game working make sure you always manually update the ss.bin and dmi.bin"
