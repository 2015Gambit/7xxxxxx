,Grateful84,2012-10-27T06:31Z,Demonoid please reutrn to us RIP
,RayC1,2012-10-27T17:41Z,"I'm always amazed at idiots that encode audiobooks down to 32 kbps...All you do is fuck it up and make it sound like the narrator is talking in a tunnel. Shame on you. 

Go look for a better quality rip from someone that knows what their doing. 64kbps is decent, but 192 is the lowest anyone should go. I don't give a shit what it is.

The problem with Pirate Bay is the fact that there are no standards to uploading."
,santillan,2012-10-27T20:20Z,"32 kb/s is totally acceptable for voice. The real
morons are those who complain without having 
knowledge . "
,giuseppe281,2012-10-27T23:43Z,As another former Demonoid User I've found the audio books the hardest to find.  RIP Demonoid!
,eomer000,2012-10-29T14:28Z,"Just a note on the 32kbps, if I had encoded it stereo and at a full 44kHz, it would sound bad.  But since I cut both of those in half I get somewhere near the quality of 96kbps, and for voice it's sounds fine.  Try one of the files it won't take long to download, because it's compressed so much.  And I did give the link to where the higher quality files could be found if the quality wasn't good enough for some people."
,eomer000,2012-10-29T14:32Z,"@MagiciansFR, I'm afraid I can't help there.  If you look at my notes my source was here on the pirate bay.  I'm grateful for the guys like sven_kirk that do post this stuff I just thought I'd try my hand at helping."
