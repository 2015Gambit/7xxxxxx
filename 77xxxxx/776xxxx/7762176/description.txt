Japan's Mono have been exploring the margins of post-rock since 2006 when they collaborated with World's End Girlfriend on 2006's Palmless Prayer/Mass Murder Refrain, using electronics, strings, chorus, a pianist, and a saxophonist. 2009's Hymn to the Immortal Wind featured large string and wind sections, followed by the live festival performance Holy Ground: NYC Live in collaboration with the Wordless Music Orchestra under the conduction of Jefrey Milarski. Those albums showcased Mono's sound in transition from its thundering post-rock origins. For My Parents, again with Milarsky's WMO renamed the Holy Ground Orchestra, nearly completes that move. Each of Mono's previous experiments with classical instrumentation and arrangements has gone a little deeper and wider. But these five lengthy tracks move them further toward the edge. Here they've created a music that seamlessly melds the repetitive, hypnotic, density, and propulsion we've come to expect from post-rock as a genre, yet turns them upside down, focusing increasingly on detail, space, ambience, melody, expansive harmonics, and intervallic architectures.
