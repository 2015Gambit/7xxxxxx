[T],john1942,2012-10-27T18:01Z,Please...please...included one http tracker...next time. Thanks...
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-27T23:38Z,"10 HTTP trackers, 6 UDP trackers.

I'm using a somewhat obsolete client (uTorrent 1.6.1) which can't actually use the UDP ones. But once there are other seeds, you can use them with each other.

What makes you think I have no HTTP trackers?
