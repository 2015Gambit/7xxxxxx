This is not the one that comes out this month. So for all the trolling unicorns again this is the ORIGINAL Hot Pursuit for PC.

Hit the streets in one of eleven supercars and race them on a variety of tracks in a variety of cars. There's an all-new Hot Pursuit mode wherein you scorch the streets on either side of the law: elude the fuzz as a speeding motorist or enforce justice from a police patrol vehicle.
