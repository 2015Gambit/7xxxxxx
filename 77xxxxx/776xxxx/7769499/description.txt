
The Legend of Dragoon is a role-playing video game developed and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. It was released in Japan on December 2, 1999, in North America on June 11, 2000, and on January 19, 2001 in Europe. Despite mixed critical reception, the game has amassed a very large fanbase following, including several online petitions for a remake or sequel. The game was rereleased on Playstation Network in May 2012.


This release includes the official game PKG, as well as the fix. Tested and works great on Rogero's 4.21 CFW. Should also work fine on 3.55, but if it gives you problems you may have to spoof the firmware number as this is a fairly recent game.

Instructions:

1. Install Legend_of_Dragoon.pkg (if you're on 4.21 the PKG will be copied to the internal HDD first and you can install it from there like a purchased PSN game; you may delete it afterwards)

2. Install Legend_of_Dragoon_Fix.pkg

3. Enjoy
