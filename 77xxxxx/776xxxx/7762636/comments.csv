,Amvet,2012-10-26T18:57Z,Can someone Tell me how to make samples of the pictures
,5-click,2012-10-26T19:10Z,"Use a free image host like imgbox.com and paste the link in the description. The bayimg doesn't work since a few days. Btw., it isn't the best idea to share a single .zip file. Split it into groups with names, or leave it in a folder. The most torrent-clients can handle up to 5.000 files in a single upload."
,Amvet,2012-10-26T19:44Z,They are all in folders
,RL269,2012-10-27T07:26Z,"a .zip file makes it look like you're trying to hide something (like a virus). Many users (like me) won't touch a .zip file.

It's best just to have just a big folder w/sub-folders for categories. If you have sub-folders you might want to include one called 'samples' with a couple from each other folder for those that want to download part of the torrent to check it out first (this is on top of the linked images)."
,Amvet,2012-10-27T13:32Z,"I tried making samples but they didnt show up also I wouldnt even know how to make a virus, I am just trying to learn to share with you guys after many years of only downloading. So what your saying is just put 5000 pictures in a folder and upload it not as a zip?"
,kevmeister2009,2012-10-27T21:01Z,is anybody seeding this?...
,kevmeister2009,2012-10-28T17:49Z,"hey Amvet, your efforts are always appreciated but you also need seeders for your torrents as well...maybe schedule seeding time for night-time for ""X"" number of hours?...

thanx"
