,blacksgdhawk,2012-10-27T06:17Z,"the current versions are all the same build 9200 and the one working activator only activates windows and not the personalization options all we need is an activator with full unlocking capabilities, so all of u guys worried about versions must know its only RTM around with various temptations and names as the time passes by the version from MS will be available and a better activator as well
a pre activated version or the one u activate by urself is the same so be patient and enjoy whats available right now

But if not, there is zero reason to have a 32-bit OS in this day and age. Every single CPU that's been made in the last 5 years are 64-bit capable. If it has more than one core, which all of them do today, then it is 64-bit capable. And if you have that old of a cpu, I seriously doubt you can even run windows 8. I have been using 64-bit OS since XP-64, and never have issues. Not to mention you cannot use more than 3.5 gigs of RAM with 32-bit windows. "

If you think you are slow now, you are only punishing yourself by putting time into Windoes 8.

I have been running the same 64-bit Window7 Ultimate, with Automatic Updates turned off, for years now with absolutely no problems. With all othe overclocking, VPNing, Gaming, Compiling and other stuff I do I guess you could consider me as a user who taxes thier system a lot.

That being said, I would never bother using the first version of ANY Windos OS Loader unless you are in a tinkering phase when it comes to issues like playing around with installing new Operating Systems and have a desire to test a release like this and report back any problems. 

Don't plan on having this be the Operating System you are goiing to go with for the long haul. If you are still on a 32-bit OS you probably have a better use for your time than to download and install this release on to your computer, seriously, there are better things for you to do than install Windows 8 on your computer.

,sheeptwo,2012-10-29T03:10Z,"To the idiots arguing that there is no point for 32-bit OS, 64-bit arguably needs much more RAM for the page tables (OS itself) due to how memory mapping works. 32-bit would be better for those with 3 GB and less.

As for Win8, as far as I know, you can upgrade to it even from a pirated copy of Win7. They don't check the license and email you a full win8 pro cdkey.
It takes some time to get used to, and I don't like how the windows looks on programs. I think the only reason to get win8 right now is that it can do what win7 can do, and you can go legit for 30 euros / 40$."

It worked for me on vmware. I'm using a VMware 5.1 host and not workstation. What VM program are you using and what does the activator do when you run it. 

The first time I ran the activator, everything was ok but it seemed to timebomb out sometime when I went to bed and woke up. I reran the activator and it's been ok for around 12 hours or so. Not sure if it'll hold out or not, so it might be better to wait for a better crack that actually works. I'm not 100% on that yet though."

slmgr /ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms 147.134.1.42:1688
slmgr.vbs -ato
slmgr /ckms
If the server is running then you will be activated for 180 days.
3). Visit http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs and get
your legit free key for an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro with Windows Media Center.
4). Now right click on extreme lower left corner of your screen and go to ""System"".

Eg- The office KMS crack works fine but reacts with most AVs and gives random BSODs unless filtered. I remember my comp freezing in firefox/ flash apps, anything basically giving me BSODs related to video drivers/RAM/ etc. I have a stable fix for it now though. So am assuming microsoft must have identified this new crack software and either altered the on windows 8 security definitions or tied up with other AVs providers to trigger random BSODs.
Fixes -
1. Temporary Fix - Remove MS AVs solution and install NOD32 in safe mode, add KMS.exe and other crack files to exceptions/ignore list.
2. Permanent Fix - Linux forever."

hi everyone, 
(1)there is a virus in the Activators so avoid using antivirus as it will delete the files and windows will crash.
(2) In Windows updates, change settings to check but don't install automatically and by installing (KB2756872 update) you have to run the activator again but not fix.
(3) Buy Windows 8 if affordable for you!!!!!!!!!!~
(4) If you are not an advance user and that also means if you don't know what restore points are then disable windows update.
(5) Every single time you guy install any software or update please create Windows Restore Points, only if you think windows is out of bad luck.

Works!~ Enjoy New OS as I am :) x32 & x64"

,Bmuzammil,2012-11-16T17:55Z,"If anyone installed (Anti-Virus) and you are seeing a black screen after you log-in. Here is what you need to do to fix that problem:
0: Go to Processes and select one (any) and right click and select Open file location to open explorer and go to control panel and uninstall your anti-virus.
1: Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete 
2: Run Task Manager
3: Select File from top menu and open (Run New Task)
4: Click Browse and Find the crack (Activator) and select and (Right-Click) and Run as Administrator. Y = yes.

After updates are installed you're OS will be deactivated so Run the Activator if so.

If you have better way if fixing this problem,
let us all know. I do want to use anti-virus but I can't :( .
Also Disable!~ Windows Defender.
Take Care"
,Turbocoupethunderbird,2012-11-18T20:13Z,"Works fine, I found if you do the initial install of the updates first, then reboot, then activate otherwise the install of the updates will kill the activation. I've been running windows 8 pro with media center for three weeks now with no problem at all. don't really like windows 8 as much as windows 7 ultimate, that's why i set my computer up as dual boot system with windows 7 and 8 installed just choose which you want to run at system start-up"
