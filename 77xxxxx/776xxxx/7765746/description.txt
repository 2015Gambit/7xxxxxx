Recap:
On many a dark night people would see her walking along the riverbank and crying for her children. A father and son go fishing at the river and see a woman in white walking along the riverbank and crying. She walks into the water and the father, Luis Alvarez, goes to rescue her. She sinks beneath the waters before he can get there and Luis dives under and tries to find her. As his son Rafael calls to him, Luis dives under repeatedly. When he comes up, Luis sees the woman in white on the shore, leading Rafael away. Luis runs after them but by the time he catches up, they have both disappeared. At the trailer, Nick takes out a flail and drives to Eddie's house. The Blutbad has decorated his house to extremes for Halloween and talks about the Wesen tradition of chasing villagers through the woods. Eddie admits that he doesn't do it in Portland these days and then gets the flail from Nick as a decoration. He puts it on an automaton and takes Nick inside, and demonstrates how he's rigged it to swing at a nearby pumpkin. The station calls to tell Nick that he has a case and he leaves after making Eddie promise that no one will get hurt. The Woman in White lies beneath the water. She transforms into a ghost, shrieking... ... and detective Valentina Espinosa wakes up from her nightmare.
