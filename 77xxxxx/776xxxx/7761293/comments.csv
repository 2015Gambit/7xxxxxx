,vaaluin,2012-10-27T01:32Z,SEED! Even if you can only manage like 15-30kb please do it. It helps so much. 
,vaaluin,2012-10-27T04:07Z,"Finished downloading. Solid quality. I don't torrent much so I don't know a standard rating system you guys use. However, I can say the audio and video are perfect. Can't really tell that it's not an actual bluray :) great job glowgaze!"
,Eldriken,2012-10-29T18:57Z,"When I played this on my PS3, after about 30 minutes, I got a message saying that the audio had been temporarily muted because the content was copyrighted by Cinavia or something to that degree.

It's the first time I've ever seen this before. Is there any way to get around that?"
,survivor977,2012-10-30T06:43Z,good print....
,stonerwitch84,2012-11-03T19:50Z,its called cinavia. the only way i know how to get around it is when the message pops up go to date and time and switch the year ahead one year. it will prolong it from happening by 30-40 mins each time
,hc32king,2012-11-04T15:32Z,Whos here downloading movies for their PS3 too?
,stonerwitch84,2012-11-04T20:50Z,every time i try to download this it starts to download and then says torrent error and starts over again. never getting past 1%
,hc32king,2012-11-05T12:40Z,Wow better than YIFI.
,DDgarp,2012-11-09T08:43Z,"Hi,

If it is suppose to be released on the 2012-11-9 in blu ray how can this be a blu ray if it is uploaded on the 2012-10-26?"
,cipherpunks,2012-11-12T01:34Z,Very poor quality video. Brightness is way too low and muddy tones overall. Significant banding in gradients and terrible compression artifacts. This is unwatchable to me so I'll find some other torrent.
,kaotic123,2012-11-21T05:09Z,When it comes to the cinavia on the ps3 there is a better way around it but its a hit or miss. I found that turning off your actual internet and then disconnecting your ps3 from any internet connection and then go into network settings and shutting off the internet ability then restarting your ps3 should work. hope it helps. @Eldriken
