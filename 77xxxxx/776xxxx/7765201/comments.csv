,chop007,2012-10-30T15:21Z,"If these are theme chooser themes you need to download a custom rom from xda that supports theme chooser engine, such as cm9, cm10, ressurection remix etc. If these are just launcher themes you only need to download from the appstore a launcher that supports the specific themes, namely go launcher, adw launcher etc etc. Then simply instal the theme.apk and select it from launcher options. The best however is apex launcher pro as you can use any themes icons in it. Anyways, I will downlaod this next week and see for myself, but Bobiras always has perfect torrents. naruto64 hope this helps bro, come to xda forum for all the info and more."

,szakal18,2012-10-31T18:46Z,Audio Player Platinum WithEQ please! :)
,chop007,2012-10-31T19:44Z,"yeh, the themes are in app format, be it for theme chooser or for launchers, all apk format. The only way to install a cutom theme would be to create one from various toggle images, xml etc etc, too long to get into that here, but then you will make a zip and flash it, same way as if you where to place a custom rom on ya phone. You can even deconstruct apk's by renaming them to .zip and then unpack the images from there and place them into a new zip to flash."

You only show your lack of culture and control when you use that language."
