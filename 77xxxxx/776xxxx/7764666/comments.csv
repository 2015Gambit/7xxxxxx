1) Run PM Fastrack v7
2) Click 'Activate'
3) Click 'Accept'
4) Type in ""MANUAL"" (without the quotes) as serial number. Click 'Next'
5) Copy 'Site Code' (18 chars)
6) Run 'Keygen.bat'.
7) Paste Keygen in command prompt window. Press 'Enter'
8) Copy and Paste 'Encrypting Key' (26 chars) in 'Site Key' field of PM Fastrack.
9) Relaunch PM Fastrack.

Voila!!! Program is now activated.

It works flawlessly. You first have to edit the pmfastrack.ckInfo file and change the values of these keys:

KeyLevel=7
KeyOptions=3

To resolve (Authorization Error, number: -7) error.

Make the 'Program data' folder visible in C drive since it is hidden and then search for

C:ProgramDataCrypKeyLicenses
-OR-
C:UsersvikassiApplicationDataLocalVirtualStoreProgramDataCrypKeyLicense

and delete the Crypkey folder along with all of its contents. For best results, uninstall any folder version of Fastrack.
Reboot.
Install/Reinstall the v7
Follow the instructions for activating the SW as mentioned above

IMPORTANT - Make sure you change the KeyLevel=7 and KeyOptions=3 in pmfastrack.ckInfo
file before following the activation algorithm. Works 100% on v7 English.

Also remember to delete the folder inside of here: C:ProgramDataCrypKeyLicenses"

Do you follow the instructions exactly and precisely?"
