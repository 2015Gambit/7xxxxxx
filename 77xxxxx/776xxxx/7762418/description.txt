Requirements:
Android 2.3 or higher on a GPS enabled 800x480/480x800 resolution device.
Operation and use on a higher or lower resolution device is not currently recommended...it may not work.
All install APKs and map/voice data included...nothing more to download.

Regional versions included in Torrent:
Baltics
Benelux
Brazil
Europe
Germany-Austria-Switzerland
Iberia
Italy
Southeast Asia
UK-Ireland
US-Canada
West Europe

Each available region is RAR compressed in the Torrent so that it is easier to pick and choose what you want to download. You can choose/not choose to download any or all that you like.

UnRar from the Torrent download the desired region to install.
Copy desired region tomtom folder to SD Card.
Copy desired matching region APK file to phone or SD Card.
Disable any Data or WiFi connection.
Install APK and run the program. Done!
Warning: to prevent the program from ever 'phoning home' and possibly disabling the navigation, always turn Data and WiFi OFF before using!
Do not attempt any in-app purchases or 'live data' features...use in off-line mode only.

Every one of the regional installs included in the Torrent has been fully tested and found to be working completely at the time of publication.

Currently it is not possible to add your own maps...each regional installation provides for only the maps and data for that region....they cannot be 'mixed'.
You can add your own POIs by using the TomTom *.ovl/*.bmp files available at places like POI Plaza. Put any custom POI files on the SD Card in tomtomcom.tomtom.{region name}files{region map name}*.*
