,timothytt,2012-11-01T07:05Z,"I can't actually imagine a fellow Pirate playing this properly. So, to cheat:
1) Open the game, start a new game, and save it.
2) Exit the game, go to My Documents (Assuming you have Win 7/Vista)My GamesFarming Simulator 2013savegame[something], and open careerSavegame.xml with Notepad. 
3) Then, once opened, press Ctrl+F, and look for ""money"". The number behind the highlighted ""money"" is your current amount of money. Change that to 999999999 and you're good to go."
