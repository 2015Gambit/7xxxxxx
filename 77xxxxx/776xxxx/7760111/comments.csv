It works perfect, you have to try one more time.
In the ""metadata.xml"" files, try to remove the numbers between size size >xxx<
Have fun :)"

When I got it I will upload Australia to :)"
,ScorpioPirate,2012-11-02T14:57Z,"If some have problems to run TomTom:

A piece of advice: To get tomtom working if not running yet you must:
open metadata.xml in text editor and change the xxxxxxxxxxx (xx.. are numbers) to ""0""
after that, you can delete uneeded languages from folder com.tomtom.europe/files/VautoTTS/languages/ leave just language what u need
You save arround 1GB!!!

Have fun :)
