,DarkLives,2012-10-28T18:48Z,Thanks a bunch! I've been waiting for someone to put up the full run for FF before I dive into it.
,Sxr10,2012-10-28T22:30Z,"Glad to help! Yeah, I was waiting for the runs to finish before I read them too! But nobody put them up. It would have been up within a day on demonoid, and no other site seems to have quite filled the comic void left by that site's absence. So I thought I'd do the honors. "
,DocBerry,2012-10-30T02:06Z,"Not to hate on this torrent. But my Fantastic Four Hickman Run Torrent collection is way better. 

1) It's in organized reading order.
2) I've named all the issues.
3) This one doesn't include the 5 issues Dark Reign - Fantastic Four comics by Hickman leading in the beginning of his run.
