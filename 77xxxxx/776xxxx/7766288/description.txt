
Arr, Mateys!!!
Two days ago, three massive creative comic runs came to an end: Matt Fraction's Invincible Iron Man, Jonathan Hickman's Fantastic Four/FF and Ed Brubaker's saga encompassing Captain America, Captain America and Bucky and The Winter Soldier.

My online idol, DEMONOID is down. Normally I'd get all these runs pretty easily from there (Thanks, you MPAA anti-piracy douche bags).

I went on a hunt today from various sites to get all three creator's complete comic runs, and after hours of painstaking searching and renaming, I hit the jackpot!
So HERE IT IS, folks! This is my tribute to DEMONOID, that had the best comic collection online that I'd seen. All three full creators' runs. 

This is Part 3:
Jonathan Hickman's COMPLETE run on Fantastic Four and FF. Fantastic Four runs from issue 570 through to 588. It then resumes from issue 600 to 611. FF goes from issues 1 to 23. 

ENJOY! And I hope this works. Comments, and criticisms highly appreciated! All credit goes to the original scanners! ROck on, you awesome ppls!

PLEASE SEED!!
