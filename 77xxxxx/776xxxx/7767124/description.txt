Meet Sun Green. She's the latest in the familial line of Green Women environmentally conscious girls who are intent on saving the planet. The only problem is, all the other women in her family mysteriously disappeared when they reached her age. Fearful about what she may become and where she might end up, Sun seeks answers from her remaining extended family. When a mysterious stranger comes to town and threatens her brother and her new boyfriend, she may have to figure out a way to tap into her power and defeat him sooner rather than later. Set in 2003 during both the debate surrounding the Iraq conflict and the question of drilling for oil in Alaska, this tale manages to be both politically conscious and massively entertaining. The art is stunning. Sun is beautifully drawn and is just as radiant as her namesake. The unnamed mysterious stranger is depicted as gritty and sinister, just as a villain should be.
