,TeamExtremeMc,2012-11-02T14:02Z,@roman95 it sure does.
,Malakore,2012-11-04T14:51Z,"I'm not sure what I did wrong but after installing (Win7), typing in some random name and clicking Login I end up with ""Login Failed"" error.

Play Offline button is gray and it says ""Not downloaded""

I checked the ReadMe forum page, but it didn't give me any other instructions.

Any ideas? Thank you."

[V],wushdishmeen,2012-11-05T13:58Z,"Can you please tell me how to remove whatever ""crack"" this torrent uses?  I installed this first so I could try out the game and then decided I liked it.  So I purchased the legit version to support the developers and connect to real multiplayer servers.

Of course now when I try to login to my legit copy it says ""Login Failed"".  Which I'm assuming is because this torrent does something,  and doesn't reverse it when you use the uninstaller that is included.

I already tried deleting the .minecraft folder.   The web browser version works for me and installs the legit files,  so then I can use the desktop version and do ""Play offline"" once the login fails.

BUT I cannot login... thats the issue.  PLEASE HELP!"

,mo2377,2012-11-06T21:43Z,why cant i go on multiplayer servers
,TerrydaSauce,2012-11-07T09:32Z,i downloaded this. but its not working for me. i will click on the desktop or dl file icon and adobe will open up instead of the game. can someone tell me how to fix this so i can finally play?
,TerrydaSauce,2012-11-07T09:38Z,"its not working for me. i try and open up the game, but adobe just comes up. did i mess something up?"
,Malakore,2012-11-09T09:32Z,"Yes you are right TeamExtremeMc, I'm sorry. It installed itself into the admin appdata (where was leftover of previous different installation), instead of my user appdata, and my old shortcut was trying to run old install.

This release is working fine."
,Malakore,2012-11-09T14:49Z,"@ThePoisonedYouth:

Have you tried updating LWJGL (thats the game library Minecraft uses for graphics, sounds and input)? Minecraft never ships with latest version, yet I never run into problem with it and it actually solved few issues for me and my friends in the past.

There is tutorial on Minecraftwiki called ""Update LWJGL"" with all the info you may need."

 Bad video card drivers!      
      -----------------------      

Minecraft was unable to start because it failed to find an accelerated OpenGL mode.
This can usually be fixed by updating the video card drivers.

,swiftmadness,2012-11-12T02:35Z,"I'm not sure what's going on, but I installed this as per the instructions, and every time I open it via the  desktop shortcut it opens the wrong application. This is the target of the shortcut: 

""C:UsersMyUserNameAppDataRoaming.minecraftMinecraft Launcher.jar""

I also tried manually going into the minecraft folder and opening it with the same result. It opens another application. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

Just go to the file, right click, open with, choose default programs and make sure that little box is ticked that says ""always use the selected program..."" and then choose ,java from the list, then click OK.

@JocaDASA

Your running windows 8 and the error says ""bad video card drive"" just google ""windows 8 Minecraft bad video card driver"""

I'm having the problem where the minecraft shortcut brings up the ""open with which program"" issue and i tried setting it to run with java but that doesn't work, also java wasn't on the program list so i had to find it manually. I tried changing file extensions to .exe as well, is ""minecraft launcher.jar"" even supposed to open the game?"
,Penitence,2012-11-14T19:49Z,"also i tried installing your 1.3 version and that one at least had the minecraft icon but still the same problem, is there not supposed to be an .exe file?"
,Malakore,2012-11-14T19:50Z,"@Penitence: Verify that your Java is installed properly (you can type  ""java -version"" in the command line) and then make sure that you open it with Java Web Start (javaw.exe, located in the ""bin"" directory of your Java install)."

I've already done that and everything points me to drivers...And i've done what everybody says but still nothing... :P"
,Penitence,2012-11-15T02:00Z,"@Malakore
thanks for responding but i had already tried javaw.exe i saw it mentioned on another forum but it still did not help, regardless TeamExtremeMc's newest update of Minecraft seems to start off without the problems i previously encountered, might just be a rare problem on my account"
