,BlaTaN,2012-10-29T05:52Z,"If you read the info posted above, it hints to what it will be like anyway.

being .mp4 format at 640 reso,  it will be 'ok' to watch. with some pixelling here or there perhaps, but watchable.   IMO anything above 700 is starts to get into the nicer looking realm of things."

You should probably check a doctor or something. I think you might be rerarded.

As for the uploader, I've downloaded before from you and the quality is pretty good. Thanks man :)"

,wizzard4all,2012-10-29T23:43Z,"I really, really REALLY wish that you technology challenged people would quit blaming seeds/leeches for your crappy internet connection problems! Try getting the instructions for opening ports on your connection instead of whining on here!
I can take a file from here with 3 seeds and 30 leeches, and it STILL downloads in less than an hour, because MY system is properly configured for torrenting, and I have a good internet connection.......
STOP BLAMING OTHERS FOR YOUR PROBLEMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
