No, you need both discs to play campaign/single player mode. The game will ask you to swap discs only once."

,dunit80,2012-10-26T05:44Z,If this game asks you to switch disks. Then it probably wont work on an RGH console. You will have to burn discs.
,zero423,2012-10-26T06:30Z,it doesnt ask you to switch discs...dumbasses. 1-campaign 2- multi player.
,aldo45,2012-10-26T07:02Z,"@dunit80 - You're a dumbass mate. 2 disc titles work with NO problems on RGH and JTAG.

If you're using GOD containers disc swapping is handled automatically by FSD3.

If you're using extracted ISO's (JTAG RIPS), you put Disc 1 into a folder called 'disc 1', disc 2 into a folder called disc 2'. Disc swaps are then handled automatically again by FSD 3.

You should really research your facts before posting shite comments like you did.

This torrent will work on an RGH or JTAG WITH NO PROBLEMS!"
,farr3ll,2012-10-26T07:05Z,"@dunit80, if you think multi disc games can't be played on jtag/rgh then you obviously don't own one!

NOW, Stop being a gumby and confusing people with stuff you obviously know nothing about!.. p.s. as usual, thanks thenoobish!"

Get another torrents with people that know how to SEED!

If you grab this, be sure to have the time and doing something else! you WONT play AC3 in the near future!"
,twohearts_left,2012-10-26T21:34Z,"@DJ_SEVEN

look, i dont know where you are from but i cant understand one fucking thing you are saying. but i can tell its insulting since you said noob. 

learn to speak english and its grammar fluently before you attempt to make someone feel bad for asking for help. 

there is nothing i can do about the people who seed/dont seed. This is the case with both AC3 torrents in my specific case. 

Also i dont know what ""AW's"" are mabe if you EXPLAINED that as well mabe id understand your insult to a degree where it was worth saying. sorry you wasted your breath.

,dunit80,2012-10-26T23:10Z,"@twohearts it seems like any game that I try to download that comes out before the release date ALWAYS downloads at a snails pace. And I have a Verizon Fios connection. And any game that I download after it has already hit retail stores, I can download it in less than an hour. Its probably a lot to do with the seeders NOT actually seeding. Because this game says it has 389 seeders right now. I get better speeds on games that only have 10-15 seeders total."

For me it goes like 20-40 kb download speed when I'm using internet, when I don't it went up to 1MB! and average of like 400-500, I swear I will seed when its done, idk wats the problem, after burning the game just open Utorrent and seed, it ain't gonno kill you. 70% now, god i can't wait any longer!"

PC Version is not yet out i think, wait for it."
,P_Greezy,2012-11-03T14:25Z,@CrematoryKid - All you have to do is run the iso thru abgx so it patches the stealth files so its safe to play online without getting banned.

,Speedkyng55,2012-11-04T12:53Z,"CTVX: you can unrar them with WinRAR or WinZIP. if these two don't work, try 7-zip. i think WinZip and WinRar is not free, but trial version will be enough.
but beside unraring the rar files you have to know how to burn the iso file on a disc, because it is done not in the same way as iso file for PC. do you know how to burn it or want me to help?

and last, sorry for my EnglishXD"
,3x3tr4tor,2012-11-04T13:29Z,To all of you who doesn't know. Assassin's Creed 3 PC version IS NOT OUT YET!!!!! It will be available on 23 November 2012 (In EU) and 20 November ( In US and AU)!!!!!!!!!!
,CTVX,2012-11-04T16:27Z,Speedkyng55: well what I use is different than burning a disc and using a flashed drive. I use an xk3y and it only needs the whole disc in an iso file
,Spink__,2012-11-04T18:21Z,The game freezes after sequence 3 for me. Anyone with the same problem? If you got a solution please tell. I'm on LT3...

,CTVX,2012-11-04T22:07Z,SinSnoop: Thanks man.
,whichaw,2012-11-05T04:32Z,disc 2 is also for single player or not? plese tell me.
,SinSnoop,2012-11-05T07:34Z,"@CTVX: No probs man

@The 2 Disc dealio:

I haven't played it yet, but based on Ubisoft's press releases, the single player is spread across both discs, however the multiplayer is all on disc 2. Hope that clears a bit up :)"
,tibyyy,2012-11-05T13:14Z,"Hello Guys! 

I'd like to ask that :  I have a Modified Fat Xbox, with  a  2.0.13599.0 Dashboard, and it's flashed with LT 2.0 or it may be LT 2.1 ( i dont know exactly). 
So it was last flashed and so updated last octobe(lately) or november. 

I can play with AP 2.5 games -patched disks y Agx- like Ass. Creed Bortherhood, and Fable 2. 

And the first XGD3 disks works fine too, like the Bat. Arkham City and the Revelations of Ass.Creed. (these disks are burned just natively, as they are downloaded, Without any patch)


So, will the iso (after burning to disks...:P) work with my xbox? Or I have to do new modifications? Dash Update? Newer flash? Newer Patches and burn process? 

Great thanks for the answers!!"
,dcrock32,2012-11-06T04:05Z,"@radwan1234 

I do know what i'm doing. I played Halo 4 on lt2.0. The only games i've had trouble with after patching were epic mickey 2 which didn't work at all for me and this which just kept freezing at the first long load screen no matter what i did. I updated to 3.0 and same thing so i downgraded back to 2.0. I guess sometimes games just won't work for some. Not many times though."
,nickxing,2012-11-06T15:06Z,"I don't know why this torrent is so slow! I'm downloading by 4 days and it is still on 34%!

,bakafish4,2012-11-08T12:26Z,um... hi everyone... i dl-ed the game... run abgx... everything was green... burned the dvd and started the game... problem was... it was asking to download an update... i have an LT+ 3.0 xbox slim... not sure what to do now.. please help T___T
,skymiah,2012-11-08T13:37Z,"@bakafish4 they always have new patches for the game through system updates. Just download it you will be fine, of course if you don't believe it or don't want to risk it. Just disconnect and play offline. ;) Happy Gaming."
,box_77,2012-11-08T17:05Z,"Works perfect. phat with lt2.0, topo injected with xbox backup creator, burned (truncate method) with imgburn using memorex dl and normal laptop burner. i heard that i can get banned doing this (no lt3.0, no ihas burner, no abgx)  (is that true??), but i dont care bcause i never play live. 
Thanks for the up!!"
,box_77,2012-11-08T17:42Z,"one more thing. when dvd inserted, its asked me to do an update. so i updated the dashboard via usb and not the dvd it self (once again, may be im wrong, bu i heard to not trust the dvd update..lol). by the way, now im playing halo 4, burned same way, and it works perfect.

,bakafish4,2012-11-08T19:45Z,@skymiah YIPPEE!!! i tried what you suggested and it applied the patches and everything... and now its working great :D thankies :D meh... i was scared of applying those updates coz it was those updates before that made me mess up this xbox before XD and the guy who fixed it told me to never update the xbox... i guess he just meant not to update it online... *whew* im glad for your help :D thanks again :D
,tha_fuzz,2012-11-08T20:55Z,"I realla can't get this to work, my last flash was when revelations was released, think its 2.0.

install in hdd, use the mp3 trick (play a song from usb stick with sound turned to min.), and then enjoy the game."

I downloaded Xbox Backup creator, but I can't find any topology 2.0, can you link me a guide or just write step for step. Would be really thankful. btw, do I have to use a new ISO since I already ran this through abgx360? i.e. is it ruined?"
