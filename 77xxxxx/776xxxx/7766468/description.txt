Shawn GallawayΓÇÿs mission is clear: empowering people to take caring, positive action in their lives and in the world right now. He accomplishes this resoundingly through both his music and art. As a multi-talented guitarist, singer-songwriter, and visual artist, Shawn weaves music, song, and painting into a richly textured experience that calls for enlightened activism.

In his latest release, Love Will Overcome, Shawn moves from the individual healing focus of his previous release, I Choose Love, to address community, global healing and restoration. Shawn says, ΓÇ£It is about raising awareness and empowering people to take actionΓÇ¥. These songs highlight healing for the peace movement, the environment, our political system, communities and relationships and are delivered with a passionate plea for loving action. This recording features theme songs written for organizations including the Peace Alliance, New Energy Movement, Go Gratitude, and the Satyana Institute.


I Choose Love: The Experience is a multimedia production that follows the soulΓÇÖs healing journey through pain, confusion and struggle to emerge into the freedom of self-awareness, purpose, compassion, and joy. It includes songs, stories, dance, drama, photography, computer animation, film, and a series of original paintings that brings together the love of eight individuals as they transform their fears into a beautiful mosaic of forgiveness, peace and healing.  This theatrical piece is currently in pre-production.
