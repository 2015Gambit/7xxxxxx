There are currently thirteen books in the series, all of which continue the same story, weaving towards the ultimate climax. There will be fourteen books for the main story line. Books 12 through 14 are being completed by fantasy author Brandon Sanderson, who was chosen by Robert Jordan's widow after he passed away. Robert Jordan left behind an abundance of notes and audio recordings, which allowed his family and Mr. Sanderson to tie up the series in a way that very closely matches his original vision.

What's it about? 

Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time is a story that takes place both in our past and our future. In his fantasy world, the Dark One, the embodiment of pure evil, is breaking free from his prison. The overall plot is about a man who learns that he is the reincarnation of the world's messiah and is once again destined to save the world from the Dark One -- but possibly destroy it in the process. This saga is not only his story, but the story of an entire world's struggle to deal with war and change, destruction and hope.
