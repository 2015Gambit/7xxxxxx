Storyline:


A creepy, darkly comic celebration of the scariest night of the year from producer Bryan Singer (director of X-Men and Superman Return) and writer-director Michael Dougherty (co-scripter of X2 and Superman Returns). Trick 'R Treat takes the Creepshow/Tales from the Crypt approach to nefarious new depths with four interwoven tales set on Halloween night: a high school principal (Dylan Baker) moonlights as a vicious serial killer; the quest of a young virgin (Anna Paquin) for that special someone takes a gruesome turn; a group of teens carries out a cruel prank with disastrous consequences; and a cantankerous old man (Brian Cos) battles a mischievous trick-or-treating demon.
