,Person7557,2012-10-31T22:31Z,"if you want music from this game use this magnet link in your ÂľTorrent:
magnet:?xt=urn:btih:B393DDA6E9D363556875F6673CCACAF60B89A65D&dn=KF%20Music.rar&tr=udp%3a//tracker.openbittorrent.com%3a80/announce"

All DLCs work in this installation."
,VaderforprezAZ09,2012-11-04T00:10Z,"I don't particularly trust this torrent, but I don't really trust any torrents. It looks fine, though.

And just a word of advice, the default language set in the installation is Russian, so if you're having trouble with it ""not being in English"", make sure you've clicked English in the setup or you'll end up looking really stupid."
