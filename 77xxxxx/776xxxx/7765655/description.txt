Build a complex machine to perform a simple task.
Apparatus is a game about setting up simple mechanical structures to 
move one or several marbles to the goal.
This is the lite version, featuring a few levels from the full version. Some features from the full version are disabled in this Lite version.
Connect cables from batteries to motors, build bridges, set up teeter totters,
swing with ropes, build vehicles, or just let the marble have a happy roller coaster
ride to the goal!
Use the hammer or the wrench to connect planks, wheels and other objects together.
