What's New in Version 5.1.1

# New Stuff:
* Static, an advanced and powerful Markdown blogging tool with scriptlet support. Read all about it in the documentation.
* Syncable, per document, preset text styles: Create a rich text page named "VPDocumentTextStyles" in your document and place a new text style on each line of the page. They will then show up in the Text Styles palette, and sync across computers.
* Two way sync between VoodooPad for iOS and Desktop VoodooPad. VoodooPad will talk to its iOS sibling over the local Wifi and figure out which pages need to be copied over, and back. Basically, whoever was the last to edit a page wins. The iOS sync sheet has also been updated to show a little icon which will let you know if it's a one way sync (in the case of VP Reader, or a two way sync for VP iOS).
* You can now select a cover image when exporting to ePub, which will be used in iTunes as a little thumbnail for the book.
* When importing an image into a Markdown page (via drag+drop with the option key down), VoodooPad will insert the correct image tags to make it show up.
* New page event: textViewWillDisplay(document, page, textView). You can use this to customize a text view (like adding custom margins) before the text view shows up on screen

# Changed Stuff:
* Mac App Store versions of VoodooPad are now sandboxed.
* Two finger swiping is now the default for going back and forth (and always using the natural direction for this)
* The location of your last web export is now stored as a document property instead as a per-machine preference.
* When opening a document without a page cahce, VP will now display a little dialog saying "hey, this might take a minute please hold on". It's rare to ever see this, but it can happen.
* Updated to MultiMarkdown version 3.6.
* The Index page is now moved to the very first page on PDF export if you choose "All Pages" instead of a collection.
* Renamed File Γû╕ Export Γû╕ "Export to iPhone or iPadΓÇª" to "Sync with iPhone or iPadΓÇª", since it's a sync now with VoodooPad for iOS.
