'Cynthia Petal's Really Fantastic Alien Sex Frenzy'

Eros Comics, 1993, 50 pages

Written and Illustrated by Dave Cooper


No words, really. Awesomely twisted and completely bizarre. The kind of book that makes you wonder what was going on in Cooper's head at the time, and how much he laughed maniacally to himself while putting it down on paper.
