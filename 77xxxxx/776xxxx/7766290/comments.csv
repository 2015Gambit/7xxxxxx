,Toddler_Naruto,2012-11-04T09:26Z,"Why am I having trouble playing this on my PS3?

Is this 8-bit or 10-bit?"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-04T11:59Z,todler i dont do 8bit video anymore everything i release is in 10bit
,mooserocka,2012-11-07T05:23Z,I dont understand the bits thing. All i know is everything works on my ps3 just takes a while to load them all on using vuse. If there is an easier way i would love to hear it. Everything has worked perfectly except one of the newer animes. The sound isnt in sync with the anime but its cool i can still deal with it. 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-10T01:34Z,Moose its not in sync because the ps3 is not capable of playing 10bit videos properly. 
,mooserocka,2012-11-16T19:17Z,i NEVER have problems on my ps3. Your anime are always great just episode 1 of that one series is not. O well stuff happens what can ya do lol.
