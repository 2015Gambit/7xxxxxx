[V],albiondean,2012-10-27T14:43Z,Is it againts your religion to give credit to the original capper ? 
,Spoonage,2012-10-27T16:12Z,"Man, Albi, Footy has been putting these up since Melbourn... your whining little ass only started, what, 4 races ago - at least under any mild search effort. Then you come in acting aggressivly and, frankly, like a troll. What the hell is your problem. Firstly: you are splitting seeders on an already choked share, and secondly: you are just spreading anger and discontent. You should really just suck it up, shut up, and go back where you came from."

,Spoonage,2012-10-28T14:19Z,It is a wonder how he got his skull - aside from his wonderful collection of Coronation Street. They must've given him his own special one for being such a Venomously Impertinent Prick.
,hmb133,2012-10-29T03:46Z,"@albiondean, you capped this one did you?"
[V],footy,2012-10-29T15:48Z,@hmb133 : NO.
[V],albiondean,2012-11-02T15:09Z,"Hey , Spoonage, i got my skull, not for capping Corrie, i used to cap a lot of sports years ago here perhaps you wasn't allowed on a comp then, and tv shows, dont look like youve capped fk all or uploaded anything to the community here, so bollocks.

Skull or no, it means fk all."
