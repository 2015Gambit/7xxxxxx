,OmniNegro,2012-10-27T09:45Z,"Since many others jumped the gun and already loaded Windows 8, I will go ahead and ask. Anyone know if this works with 8? Or should those who jumped the gun stick to the previous and confirmed Windows 8 compatible versions?

Thanks as always nosTEAM."
,IndigoAK,2012-10-27T10:43Z,I have not been able to get Borderlands 2 running on Windows 8 and from what I've read around the web this isn't just limited to pirated copies.  People with legit copies of the game are also having Windows 8 issues.
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-10-27T11:39Z,windows 8 is not made for games so solution to your problem is simple use win 7
,IndigoAK,2012-10-27T12:59Z,Wow.
,101rjb,2012-10-27T19:46Z,could you upload batman arkham city
,GObonzo,2012-10-27T20:04Z,"AM and have been using Windows 7. tried every other ""skulled"" Borderlands Update and crack and no other version of Borderlands torrent would run this game. no crash, just wouldnt launch.

dumbass idea to add a self executing registry edit to the file. most real gamer is not going to have games, ie steam, installed to their Windows C: drive. need to change this to search for steam.
and i understand human ego but the noSTEAM images you always add to launch screens are cheesy and the web page launch is just ridiculous. you're on the verge of a spam artist.

thanks for the files tho."

Every other game here works just fine just Borderlands 2 just doesnt want to."
,Dustertrouble,2012-10-29T22:31Z,"I'm looking for a patch that will fix the no launch error.

I already have update 6 and the DLCs downloaded.

Gh0stNet had something going that fixed a clean install and made it playable. But I havent' got an update or a DLC to work since.

Do we know if this one fixes that problem?

I've seen the game work on my specs. "
,slapnutz,2012-11-04T12:58Z,"I have something similar to Dustertrouble. The base noSteam install works fine. However whenever I run any update regardless if its v1.1.1 or v1.1.2 or v1.13, I always get a no start app crash error straight away. Something to do with ""BEX"" error. The original install always works fine, however any updates kills it. Exact same issue with the Skidrow version. Any ideas anyone?"
,slapnutz,2012-11-04T13:00Z,"Sorry btw, regards to above comment. I'm using Win7 64bit. Also each time error version changes after each update. So it does recognise its a newer EXE file."
