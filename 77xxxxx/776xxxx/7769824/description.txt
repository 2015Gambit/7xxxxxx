Introduction to Elements of Kathara Level - 4: Installment 1 - Featuring: the Eiradon Awakening, the Voyager "Trinity Time Wave" 'Ra-Sha-LA' Restoration, the 'Ah-Seu-Ra-Shan' State and the Hon'a-tiL-E-a Run. Recorded live in Phoenix, March 2005. This workshop contains the beginnings of the ΓÇ£Monadic TranslationsΓÇ¥, a complex series of translations that have to do with the structure of the Monad and its formation through the FIRST and SECOND Partiki (God SourceΓÇÖs DESIRE then INTENTION to create). These initial translations give an overview of the specific series of ΓÇÿcell divisionΓÇÖ processes that the first and second partiki undergo to form the Monad, which itself splits to form the RADON cells.

The RADON cells interface directly between the etheric and atomic realities (non-manifest and manifest form) and have been progressively activated through the Nadradon (Mexico workshop - ROR), Zendradon (MM/UK workshop) and Kethradon (India workshop - IKA) awakenings. The activations in this workshop, including opening the Eiridon Mother Stream (the liquid light flow within the central vertical column), give us the necessary preparation for the Ethradon awakening and opening of the final ΓÇ£etheric-atomic doorwayΓÇ¥ which takes place during the Morocco Hetharo workshop. Opening these doorways allows us to strengthen our direct connection to Source and to access the frequencies that are ΓÇ£encryptedΓÇ¥ with God SourceΓÇÖs original ΓÇÿmathematical programΓÇÖ for Creation itself. The activations in this workshop also prepare us to be able to use ΓÇ£encryptionΓÇ¥ for manifestation. Our ability to use encryption is not only dependent on the final Ethradon Awakening, but also a properly functioning Chakra system. The ΓÇ£6-fold chakra activationΓÇ¥ helps reactivate and realign our currently distorted and truncated 2-fold configuration Chakra system for this purpose.

This activation will in turn help reactivate the ReushaTA Spiral within our Central Vertical Column, an additional necessary step in returning the strength within our Pillar of Power and our abilities to use ΓÇ£encryptionΓÇ¥. Importantly also, this workshop introduces the first of the ΓÇ£projectionΓÇ¥ technologies, where we learn to project our consciousness in a safe and effective manner. Through the exercises, you will ΓÇÿre-birthΓÇÖ, meet and activate your very own personal ΓÇÿprojection vehicleΓÇÖ called the ΓÇ£Re-Sha-LA BodyΓÇ¥ for the first time in eons! Your Re-Sha-LA will be working with you from this point forward, to develop an Avatar-like mobility of consciousness.

Finally, all the techniques in this workshop assist us in building the necessary frequencies within our Crystal Body structure to access the new ΓÇ£Trinity Time WaveΓÇ¥, allowing us to play our role in guiding this planet and all life-forms upon it, through a successful Starburst. The techniques in this workshop include: Return of the Ra-Sha-La and the 6-fold Ra-Sha-La chakra awakening in preparation for the Ethradon awakening in May 2005 Hetharo (Morocco workshop); The Rain of Rama Song (Voyager code preparation); Part 1: E-Cou-Sha manifesting and introduction to Encryption; Part 2: Consciousness states, time wave surfing the transcendental passages and introduction to the Voyagers Trinity Time-Wave codes; 6-fold Voyager code induction and Chakra induction; The Blue Lotus Code and voyage to the passage of Khemalohatea; The Khemalohatea Voyage and passage through the Khemalohatea Flame to the ADdonDrea; The Ad-Dondra Voyage and journey through the Adondrea Flame and 360-doorway.
