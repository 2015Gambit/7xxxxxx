This is actually a decent re-make of a cute funny 1960's show ""The Munsters"" which was a CBS show! I'd rather watch something like this than all of the so-called reality TV shows on air."
,JustRacey,2012-10-29T14:49Z,"NBC exec are a bunch of idiots! No wonder they are on the bottom of the ratings pile. They actually do a cecent remake of a show like the MUNSTERS (yeah that is what Mockingbird Lane is) that was cute and funny to begin with that actually gained a following the moe it aired and canecel it BEFORE it ever airs, but then there is a CRAP re-make like ""Beauty and the Beast"" that continues on the CW as a re-make of a really crappy show from CBS 1980's series. 

I'd rather watch what happens with Eddie and his new pet d(ragon)og ""Spot"" or even see the Addams family move in next door to the Munsters and see Grandpa Munster fall in live with Grandma Addams, or Wendy and Pugsley Addams go to school with Eddie Munster than see more supposed reality TV like the Kardashians!"
