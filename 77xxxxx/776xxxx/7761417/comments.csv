""Fix"" works perfectly.

Question: Why does the driver updates download so slow?"
,hmathews8,2012-11-14T17:47Z,"Works...BUT @beechyboy is correct. For some reason it either doesn't connect to the server, or only downloads at about 1-3kb/s, therefore making the program useless when trying to download 100+mb drivers."
