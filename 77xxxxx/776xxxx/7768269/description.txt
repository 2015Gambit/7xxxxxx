Revit Architecture is a powerful, complex piece of Building Information Modeling (BIM) software ΓÇö but thereΓÇÖs no reason why it needs to be difficult to learn. In this course veteran trainer and author Eric Wing takes you step by step through the process of building a five-story, multiple-use office building. You will learn how to create a model, use different views, work with the Revit tools, and add dimensions and annotations. Then youΓÇÖll delve into details like floors, roofs, ceilings, stairs, walls, and structural items like grids, columns, and foundations. YouΓÇÖll end up with a complete, realistic design ΓÇö and the skills you need to start creating your own.
