[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-27T12:42Z,"T think I irk the powers-that-be too much to rate a skull. I cannot join the forums because I resemble a spammer somehow. Maybe a subtle comment on my love of the personal rant.

That's ok, my name is my reputation and I stand by the simple respect that I get from doing what I do. For being pretty new at this, I think it's going gnagbusters and I'm having a really good time doing this.

And if I don't say it enough, kind words by you and others really does warm the cockles of my heart.
