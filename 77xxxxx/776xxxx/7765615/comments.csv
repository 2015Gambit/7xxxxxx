,fullboat1234567890,2012-10-27T23:26Z,I'm downloading this version. It is the first one I download since the madness of Windows 8 began some 48 hours ago. It is the first one that looks like it is the one. I'll report here if I could install and activate it. In the meantime please do the same. Did this work for any of you guys? Feedback appreciated. Good luck.

Just as poster John Hill I couldn't unzip it with any tool at all, neither on Windows nor on Linux. However, I see Amjr says he could unzip it, and hence try it. Please, Amjr, tell us how you did it. Thank you. I'd like to convince myself by my own experience that it is just another trial version.
Thanks everyone."
