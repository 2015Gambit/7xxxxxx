Summary
The CodeIgniter Handbook, a three-volume handbook full to the brim with pragmatic, succinct, useful information from one of the web’s pioneering developers.

Discover fascinating new techniques that allow you to remove duplication, increase your programming efficiency, and reduce those repetitive tasks. Fall in love with CodeIgniter all over again.

Ruby on Rails has become immensely popular immensely quickly, widely praised for promoting elegant syntax, rapid development speed and its controversial Convention Over Configuration pattern. In this book CodeIgniter really begins to show its flexibility as we take a look at what makes Rails popular and how we can implement those features in a CodeIgniter-friendly way. We’ll look at tidying up your code by studying design principles like Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY), and using RESTful style controllers to provide a consistent URL pattern across the application."
