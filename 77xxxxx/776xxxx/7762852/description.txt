Joseph Smith Fletcher (7 February 1863 - 30 January 1935) was a British journalist and writer. He wrote more than 230 books on a wide variety of subjects, both fiction and non-fiction. He was one of the leading writers of detective fiction in the "Golden Age".
Fletcher was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, the son of a clergyman. He was educated at Silcoates School in Wakefield. After some study of law, he became a journalist. His first books published were poetry. He then moved on to write numerous works of both historical fiction and history, many dealing with Yorkshire, which led to his selection as a fellow of the Royal Historical Society. In 1914 he wrote his first detective novel and went on to write over a hundred, many featuring the private investigator Ronald Camberwell.
He was married to the Irish writer Rosamond Langbridge, with whom he had one son.

Spargo lived in Bloomsbury on the west side of Russell Square. Every night and every morning he walked to and from the Watchman office by the same route-Southampton Row Kingsway the Strand Fleet Street. He came to know several faces especially amongst the police; he formed the habit of exchanging greetings with various officers whom he encountered at regular points as he went slowly homewards smoking his pipe.
