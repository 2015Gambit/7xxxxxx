Victoria's high country is the idyllic location of Pamela & Stuart's quaint little weekender but with a permanent move here looming, it's time to up-size. Will their new outward focusing house, have the same charm?For ten years Pamela and Stuart have relished weekends in a tiny, unpowered hut on their cattle property in Victoria's high country - but with retirement around the corner feel it's time to upgrade. Limited only by materials that have to suit the rugged conditions - what emerges is bold and unique. Pamela and Stuart clearly embrace their architect's avaunt-garde approach - but will they manage to transfer the charm of their old hut - with its fabulous bush character, into this brand new rural retreat?
