Colonization is a trilogy of books written by Harry Turtledove. It is a continuation of the situation set up in the Worldwar tetralogy, projecting the situation between humanity and the Race (the bipedal lizardlike invaders and settlers from Worldwar) nearly twenty years forward into the mid-1960s.
