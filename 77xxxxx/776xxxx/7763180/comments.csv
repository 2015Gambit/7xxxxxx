,D0gmeat,2012-10-26T22:43Z,Assuming this will work with the FLT release?
[V],gansuk,2012-10-26T22:46Z,"yes, your best off installing manually if your using it on other releases, rather than using the install.exe"
,GATOQSECOMIO,2012-10-26T23:51Z,can confirm if it works with the 12gb version of FLT?
,russianhornybear,2012-10-27T01:01Z,"@ GATOQSECOMIO
its not so important how many GB on hard drive,you can delete all videos from movies folder and will be 4 or 5 GB (dont remember for sure)"
,IndigoAK,2012-10-27T01:03Z,"Are the movies untouched?  I know the notes say there's been no recoding, but since the whole point of this update was mainly to fix the 1080p movies not working, I just want to make doubly sure."
,GATOQSECOMIO,2012-10-27T02:14Z,thanks

,crossebby,2012-11-10T07:08Z,"is this the ""entire game"" or just the ""update to the main game""... ? kindly respond I want to download this."
,KidRapper,2012-11-11T04:23Z,"@crossebby it is an update to the main game. 

However, getting the ""XCOM Enemy Unknwon has stopped working"" error ever since I try to start the game after applying the update. 

Any ideas guys?"
