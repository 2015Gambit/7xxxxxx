The wonder man of music, Devin Townsend, has always excelled in big and bold, but this time he has announced ΓÇ£the most definitive Devin show to date.ΓÇ¥ This over three hour spectacle at the Roundhouse in London is a retrospective of Townsend's entire career and it includes a full choir and theatrical cast, circus and carnival performances, several guests along with visual and enhancements unlike any show he's done so far. The man himself explains:

ΓÇ¥The Retinal Circus is a retrospective of my career in music to date, with the central theme being a metaphor of how life and the adventures therein are a 'circus' of sorts. This is the first opportunity I have been given to make theatrical representations of my music.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ¥The show involves a cast of characters and guests that support this theme through carnival type performances. A story about how a troubled young man dreams of fantastic scenarios, (illustrated through the music of my back catalog), which ultimately crests in the characters realization that life is all about the relationships we have with each other.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ¥My career has been full of amazing musicians, and a few of them will be present at this show in one form or another, and I'll be playing music that has never been attempted due to the size of the songs and the need for certain things.ΓÇ¥
