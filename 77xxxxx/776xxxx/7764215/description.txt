EDWARD GOLJAN - COMPLETE AUDIO LECTURE SERIES



Audio Files: 32kbps Bit Rate = 447.3MB (most others are around 1.63GB) 

             *I tested all the way down from 160Kbps and didn't notice a difference

             *Complete metadata in each file so all you need to do is add to iTunes
              then select all the files > Get info > Options > Media Kind = Audiobook
                 (this will keep them out of your music, I also check "remember 
                  position")
