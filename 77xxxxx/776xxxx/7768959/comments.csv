,TheBillGates,2012-10-29T20:37Z,"Activating Microsoft Windows 8 Pro for free with legitimate key !
Yes you heard it right, its possible now just follow some of these simple steps:

1). Activate your copy of windows with a MAK or KMS method
2). To activate windows using KMS server, run Command Prompt (CMD) as Admin
and enter the following in the given order:
slmgr /ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms 147.134.1.42:1688
slmgr.vbs -ato
slmgr /ckms
If the server is running then you will be activated for 180 days.
3). Visit http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs and get
your legit free key for an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro with Windows Media Center.
4). Now right click on extreme lower left corner of your screen and go to ""System"".
5). Click on ""Get more features with a new edition of Windows"" and
select ""I already have a product key"", enter the key and follow
the procedure to make your Windows legitimately activated!

NOTE:
1). Free upgrade offer is valid till 31 January 2013, so hurry up !!!
2). This method works only with Windows 8 Pro Retail !!!
3). The activation using this method is PERMANENT !!! "

I was activated for 180 day and when I used this method I got Media Center but it de-activated me. It showed ""Windows is not activated.""

So, AFTER getting Media Center I used this:

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7770932/Windows_8_Activator___Remove_Desktop_Water_Mark 

And now my system page shows no time limit and slui shows ""Windows Is Actvated"" with no time limit. All functions are working perfectly. 

Permanent. Props to you and  https://thepiratebay.se/user/cmd7600794/"
