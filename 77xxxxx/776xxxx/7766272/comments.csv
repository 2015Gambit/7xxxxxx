[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-28T09:58Z,"Great up blackcanary. Not a lot of SLG books that I don't have, but this is one of them. Sooo... I guess I have it now! Ha!"

I hope this is the one you're looking for because I don't have The Book of Lost Souls by Icon Comics which was published in 2005. ;)"
[T],blackcanary,2012-10-28T16:46Z,"LeonardTSpock, I've really enjoyed reading all of the SLG books you've been uploading.  Thank you!

For those who don't know, Halloween Comicfest is taking place this weekend, so visit your local comic book shop for some free comic books, costume contests, candy, and more fun for the kids!

One of my local comic book shops was also running a $1 special on all back issues they had."
