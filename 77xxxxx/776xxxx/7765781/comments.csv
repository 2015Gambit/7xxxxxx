,MrAcid,2012-11-04T03:44Z,"The sound is very bad; sort of muffled.
I downloaded a different torrent to make sure that it's not suppose to be like that; and it wasn't.
It also doesn't help to turn the volume up.
Check out for yourselves.
The other torrent that I downloaded was - ""	Halloween.1978.BluRay.720p.H264""
700mb."
,MrAcid,2012-11-04T04:12Z,"The video in the other torrent seems to be less good. So I extracted the audio from the other one with ""Pazera Free Audio Extractor""; and put it into this one with ""Avidemux 2.5 (32-bit)"". Went pretty quick actually."
,MrAcid,2012-11-04T04:21Z,"No, eventually Avidemux ruined the video frame rate; so choose whatever you want."
