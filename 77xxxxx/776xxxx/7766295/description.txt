Court and Spark is the sixth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell. Released 
in January 1974, the album saw Mitchell infusing her folk-rock style, which she developed 
throughout her previous five albums, with jazz inflections. A very accessible and commercially 
appealing album, Court and Spark was Mitchell's commercial and popular triumphΓÇöit was not only 
praised by critics but was also received very warmly by the public, becoming her most successful 
album. It reached No. 2 in the United States and No. 1 in Canada and eventually received a Double 
Platinum certification by the RIAA, the highest during Mitchell's career.[5] It was voted the best 
album of the year for 1974 in The Village Voice Jazz & Pop Critics Poll.[6]. In 2003 it was listed
