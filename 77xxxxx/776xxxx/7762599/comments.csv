Since there is no plot written, here is one: Animated movie for kids. It's the sort of movie that is full through politically correct, made specially for parents that are scared by the Lombroso scenario, that all kids grow up to be terrorists if the kids are presented with reality. Great for misleading kids in to delusional thinking with the promise of a Utopia that will never happen.

In my database, this title is dumped in to category ""Christian-brainwashing-junk"""

    A scarily sweet story of a young boy named Sam who loves horror films and vampires so much that he writes to Dracula for Christmas instead of Santa Claus, DEAR DRACULA was written by Joshua Williamson and drawn by Vicente “Vinny” Navarrete. Sam gets an unexpected reply to his letter when Dracula himself shows up on his doorstep, ready to make Sam’s dream of being a vampire come true.

    Giving voice to DEAR DRACULA is a cast of well-known Hollywood veterans as well as breakout young actors:

    Ray Liotta as Dracula
    Nathan Gamble (Dolphin Tale) as Sam
    Ariel Winters (Modern Family) as Emma
    Emilio Estevez as Renfield
    Marion Ross (Happy Days) as Grandma"
