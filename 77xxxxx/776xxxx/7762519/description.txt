Would you like to get in shape while learning martial arts? We would like to welcome you to come train with us for Winter Training 2012! We will be running our normal Karate, Fitness, and Aikido classes throughout the duration of this upcoming Holiday season. Based on interest, we will add additional training sessions as needed to accommodate everyone.
