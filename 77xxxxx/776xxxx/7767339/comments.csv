,przemyslavitz,2012-10-28T15:34Z,"Game is not starting on windows 7 :( Correct install, copied crack and nothing :( "
,OmarKH,2012-10-28T16:01Z,"downloading right now, but can anyone confirm that it works on windows 7 64bit?"
,924210827,2012-10-28T16:05Z,"Currently not working on windows 7.  Tried on three different win7 computers all with components.  The exe either does not start up at all, or just crashes right after starting.  Have tried different compatibility modes, no A/V, internet disconnected, etc.  It just does not work with 7."
,jagerensal,2012-10-28T16:14Z,"Nope. 
Dosent work in Win 7 Pro 64
Dosent work in Win 8 Pro 64
Dosent work in Win 7 Pro 32
Dosent work in Win XP SP3

Hillarious! "
,roines1987,2012-10-28T16:19Z,the crack isnt working for me on win 7
,przemyslavitz,2012-10-28T16:30Z,Exactly. Tried almost every possible fix for this and crap. Not working at all. I hope that someday it will be fixed.
,ZDay34,2012-10-28T16:39Z,"Yap confirmed, doesn't work on windows 7."
,GateKeeper13,2012-10-28T16:41Z,"Sorry guys but Skidrow SUCKS BALLS! I have downloaded Hunting 2013, Trophy 2 Europa and Hunting Expeditions AND NOT EVEN ONE RELEASE WORKS!!!

And this shit goes on for the last 3 months. 70% of their releases are problematic and get oftenly nuked.

I dont know what happened to them but the quality of their recent releases sucks dick and they waste my bandwith..."
,GateKeeper13,2012-10-28T16:42Z,They are a fucking joke... I have nothing else to say...
,phisher34,2012-10-28T17:18Z,"Both of the Cabelas hunting releases are not working. 

Followed instructions exactly on both."
,przemyslavitz,2012-10-28T17:51Z,"Cabelas Dangerous Hunts 2013 & Hunter's Trophy 2 Europa works, but not this one :("
,phisher34,2012-10-28T18:42Z,Dangerous Hunts has just as many people saying it is not working. Looks like the cracks don't work on 64bit systems. Seeing the same message TPB and KAT

------------Got a feeling you are all just retards or hired trolls becouse dangerous hunts works fine for me on win7 64bit ill try this and report back----------"
,skooma714,2012-10-28T22:05Z,Skidrow is a joke. How exactly does your crack not working get past you?
,knomb,2012-10-28T22:57Z,Shame the crack doesnt work. I am sure they are working on a proper. no reason to freak out
,phisher34,2012-10-28T23:05Z,Might just me be me now - but the fix worked for Dangerous Hunts but still not working for Hunting Expeditions. Re-installed and followed directions from scratch.
,phisher34,2012-10-28T23:25Z,"Alright, under compatibility I had to disable display scaling and it worked."
,przemyslavitz,2012-10-29T00:09Z,Disabling scaling didn't worked for me :(
