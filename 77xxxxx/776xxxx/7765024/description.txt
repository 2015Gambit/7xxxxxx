||				ABOUT:					||
||									||
||		UNPOPULAR is a lame P2P group that sucks at		||
||		releasing on time and in good quality. They		||
||		do what they can, but without hdtv feed or		||
||		any prior encoding experience, they receive		||
||		more complaints that compliments. We do try!		||

||		The quality might not be the best (standard def		||
||		sucks, amirite?) but we do try our best to		||
||		deliver shows the scene or other P2P groups		||
||		don't. We also upload releases to cyberlockers		||
||		to download but once they're gone, they're		||
||		gone!							||
