I get a error message like this:
windows can not access the specified device, path, or file. Maybe you do not have access rights to the object.

I have administrator rights"

,BetterRedThan,2012-11-13T18:42Z,Comodo also reports malware in the patch. It doesnt usually give warnings for this sort of thing - but maybe they are also becoming less p2p friendly.
,greenbackz,2012-11-14T10:32Z,"yah i always get false positives. was using AVG and avast and both are basically the same.. i just make it regular routine to disable them or adding exceptions for all my cracks lol..

so what is this ""proper AV"" you speak os psydeep? it would help greatly as its pretty annoying dealing with all these damn false +'s"
,mollahg,2012-11-16T10:06Z,"Excellent! It works just fantastic, everything is perfect. A big KUDOS!"
,ElFlaco-77,2012-11-19T17:33Z,"Works great except that it turned off the ability to update. Any suggestions @deepstatus.

Thanks very much for your greate job and hard work."
,g0dzai,2012-11-20T22:59Z,"@greenbacz- go with full active version of malwarebytes antimalware and security esssentials by microsoft. Then make sure that your firefox is running the addon no-script, and only allow the java scripts that make the content you need work, with nothing else active. That should be enough to stop most viruses. Also, get sandboxie for opening keygens and running suspicious programs so that you can watch what they do and run web browsers sandboxed so they can't launch anything on your computer. Hope that helps!!"
,lkadar,2012-11-22T04:53Z,"Works perfect on Win 7 x64.
THANKS!!!"
,patrac64,2012-11-22T07:29Z,"Works great!
Thanks!!"
,ineedanswers,2012-11-24T22:37Z,"thanks worked great on win 7 x64
I couldnt close one of the adobe updater processes after installing (but before rebooting), and I just applied the patch and it works fine.

maybe it is because I already blocked the adobe sites via hosts file"
,ssstrong,2012-11-25T07:35Z,Thanks
,some-young-guy,2012-11-25T10:35Z,"To anyone that uses pirated software;

This comes from a few years of personal experience.  I do not even use AV software anymore, so I don't install it.  100% of the software I have installed including the OS was located via this site.  I've learned how to avoid downloading true viral materials through use of Firefox with the ""NoScript"" addon that forbids sites I visit including this site from freely running Java scripts on the page.  The addon has it so that I, the true administrator of this PC have to personally allow a script, and if I don't completely trust a site, I don't approve the script.

About AV companies, they are all a big racket.  If a software producer, such as the pink and green skulls of this site do not pay a royalty to the AV companies, their software is deemed ""unsafe"" or containing a Trojan horse etc.  Even my firewall sometimes blocks a keyring, but that is easy to fix.  In my experience, AVs, even after you set it to allow a Keygen, still quarantines the keygen making it near impossible to run while the AV runs. So I just don't even use AV.

If you are going to download torrents from this or other sites, you are doing so to save yourself a buck or two.  If this be the case, do not complain that a part or portion of the torrent is flagged by your AV software.  Simply do not download the torrent and go to the official site of the desired software and purchase the respective software from the manufacturer for the hundreds of dollars that is advertised."
