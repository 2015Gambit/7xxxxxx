""Full Europe"", Does that mean it includes east i.e. Russian regions? I'm asking because I already have 2013.30 which doesn't include it... so is it a modified version?"
,Ipmark,2012-11-20T10:01Z,"Russian map is a separated release from Europe.

The latest release is City Navigator Russia NT 2013.30 Navicom (cyrillic language) but it isn't uploaded in TPB yet.

You can found this map here:
