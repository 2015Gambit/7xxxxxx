,kew87,2012-10-27T12:03Z,"@ChangoKid IÂ´m skandinavian so gonna see this anyway.. But the Sci-Fi part and the plot: Under their own command"" made me wonder.. Thats all. Is it fucing aliens, future weapons or in fucking space??? I know lundreren and van dammeÂ´s ""style"", but from a imdb look, this coud be a war-flick, a shoot them up-flik, osv"

,fistanleydo,2012-10-28T00:52Z,"Extreme quality as usual. As for the movie, it starts off really slow, but then delivers. If you are a Scott Adkins fan this one is for you. I give it a solid 6.5/10"

PLOT: John (Scott Adkins) awakens from a coma to discover his wife and daughter were slaughtered in a brutal home invasion. Haunted by images of the attack, he vows to kill the man responsible: Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme). While John tries to piece his reality back together, things get more complicated when he is pursued by a relentless UniSol named Magnus (Andrei Arlovski). Meanwhile, Deveraux and surviving UniSol Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren) are preparing to battle anarchy and build a new order ruled by Unisols without government oversight. They are weeding out the weak and constantly testing their strongest warriors in brutal, life-and-death combat. Luc has emerged operating the Unisol Church of Eventualism, taking in wayward Unisols whom the government has been secretly operating as remote-controlled sleeper agents. His mission is to liberate these Unisols from the implanted memories and the lies the government has inserted in them. As John gets closer to Deveraux and the rogue army of genetically enhanced warriors, he discovers more about himself and begins to call into question everything he believed to be true."
,ironymon,2012-10-30T19:06Z,"Please, if u watched even one universal soldier youre all into action and no plot... who cares if it has no plot, id watch a movie that just kicks ass all day long without saying a word except one liners."
,sinjanju2,2012-11-16T14:11Z,"Its a MOVIE WITH my homie Dolph Lundgren and Van Damme! it cant be so bad esp if you are a fan.
 Aha the bad ratings from everybody is so no one download it and BUY it instead  :)"
