,tpbsucksballs,2012-10-28T05:47Z,better late than never
[T],rkstr,2012-10-28T06:40Z,I was away for the weekend and in fact came back early to upload this.Keep up the snark and I can make it never
[T],rkstr,2012-10-28T06:43Z,and how is this late???Am I a TV network with a schedule? NO! I'm one guy (one VERY f***ing generous guy) with a computer who gives and gives and gets jack s**t in return apart from ungrateful comments from ungrateful a***holes.
,treko200,2012-10-28T07:32Z,"Thank you so much for the upload! Don't listen to the complainers rkstr, some of us really appreciate what you do!"
,lucielou1,2012-10-28T11:46Z,"Hey rkstr you are truly appreciated here, thank you for uploading each week, you come through every time =) "
,Purporter,2012-10-28T18:53Z,"rkstr, thank you for taking the time out of your life to upload my favorite/hard to find shows. it means a lot. especially how i hear of the capped bandwidth that they have in Australia. buuuut yeah. again, thank you and you're awesome. (:"
,tpbsucksballs,2012-10-28T21:59Z,ta rkstr please don't make us wait too long for tonights conclusion also kardash is back imagine if they all made it up same night!?
,loox,2012-10-28T22:35Z,"@rkstr Seriously, don't listen to these twits.  I know I speak for lots of us when I say I much appreciate your quality uploads.  thanks!"
,loox,2012-10-28T22:37Z,"one small note... these are some seriously hard to find shows you upload.  And for ones on networks like Bravo we'd have to purchase a hulu subscription to watch missed episodes.  So yeah, some people just don't get it."
,springali,2012-10-29T00:47Z,Thank you!!!!
,yinyang1968,2012-10-29T05:15Z,"@tpbsucksballs
Can YOU IMAGINE if no episodes were EVER uploaded EVER AGAIN? Seriously, I don't know if you're just trying to get under @Rkst's skin, or if you really don't comprehend the effort it takes to upload a show. If it's ignorance, then I guess you should read up on how this process works so that you can appreciate the uploader's efforts here.  If you're just being selfish and annoying, well you're going to ruin it for everyone, when RKSTR decides enough is enough, and quits uploading altogether. Whatever your reasoning, you need to straighten your manners out & show some respect and appreciation."
