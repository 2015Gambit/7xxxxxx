WARNING!  This is a strange/unique album.  One would figure that it's hard to go 


wrong with Oscar and Joe duets.  Both have total mastery of their instruments.


This record goes far afield with Oscar playing an antique keyboard which sounds like 


a zither (watch the movie "THE THIRD MAN" with Orson Welles to understand better


what I'm talking about).   The results are pleasant and quaint and very enjoyable


but this is not yer typical cooking funky Oscar Peterson album.


Approach with caution.  If you can't dig it..blame Oscar and Joe.
