,hifi447713,2012-10-29T23:58Z,1080p pls...thanks
,enonumus,2012-11-02T09:11Z,A8/V9  Thanks for getting this new release up so quickly.  The quality is very good given the file size and the higher frame rate (29.97 [NTSC video frame rate] rather than 23.976).  
,enonumus,2012-11-02T09:23Z,"Just noticed that the posted video frame rate in the specs that YIFY provided up above is 23.97.  That's what it should be for a film source of course, but this file is definitely 29.97.  Someone probably just used the wrong setting or template by mistake."
,lif3isfr33,2012-11-03T10:52Z,"@enonumus thats what yify does, he screws up everything.. his uploads are meant for people who want to save disc space.. kinda like axxo rips exept yify keeps the ""hd"" but messes with everything.. so clear picture but settings may be wrong and audio.. all yifys rips are stereo even if movie is meant for 5.1 audio.. shame"
