Arr, Mateys!!!
Two days ago, three massive creative comic runs came to an end: Matt Fraction's Invincible Iron Man, Jonathan Hickman's Fantastic Four/FF and Ed Brubaker's saga encompassing Captain America, Captain America and Bucky and The Winter Soldier.
My online idol, DEMONOID is down. Normally I'd get all these runs pretty easily from there (Thanks, you MPAA anti-piracy douche bags).
I went on a hunt today from various sites to get all three creator's complete comic runs, and after hours of painstaking searching and renaming, I hit the jackpot!
So HERE IT IS, folks! This is my tribute to DEMONOID, that had the best comic collection online that I'd seen. All three full creators' runs.

This is Part 1:
Ed Brubaker's FULL run on Captain America vol. 5 (number 1 to 50), then through the renumbering (600 to 219), then the renaming Captain America and Bucky (620 to 628), Captain America: REBORN, and Captain America vol. 6 (1 to 19). I've also included Winter Soldier as a bonus. I know there's still two issues left till Brubaker's run is finished, but I thought I'd add it anyway. Hopefully someone else can add those to this volume later. 
I've only included Ed Brubaker's runs on the comics. For example, Captain America and Bucky changes name and creators after issue 628. I havent included anything after 628. 
ENJOY! And I hope this works. Comments, and criticisms highly appreciated! All credit goes to the original scanners! ROck on, u awesome ppls!
PLEASE SEED!!
