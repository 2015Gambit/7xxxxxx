During a presidential election campaign, it is easy to
think that Americans are all at each other's throats.

Historian and journalist Tim Stanley, for whom America
is a second home, believes there's another America out
there and the best guide to the country is its sitcoms.

With the help of top sitcom writers and some of the
best examples of their work, he uncovers a fast-changing
nation that can often leave the politicians scrabbling
to catch up.

Ranging from South Park to The Cosby Show, Family Guy
to Will and Grace, The Simpsons to Ellen, Tim explores
how sitcoms mirror American life, and shows how they
can help us understand what Americans think on issues
like race, religion, gay rights, abortion and the economy.
The current smash hit Modern Family has got teen sex, a
mixed race marriage and a gay couple bringing up an
adopted baby. While hilarious, it also reflects real life
and the attitudes of modern Americans.

Barack Obama and Mitt Romney say they're fighting for
rival visions of America, yet the sitcoms and their
writers reveal a country that's far more complex,
surprising - and funny.
