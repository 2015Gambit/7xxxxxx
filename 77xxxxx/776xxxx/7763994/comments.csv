,sharkzbite,2012-10-27T07:00Z,"Powell was never conservative or Republican.  He wasn't really that great a general either. The only reason he ever got any recognition is because of race. He's still there because of race. Endorsing Obama because of race. However, a vote for Obama is a vote for Islam. Plane and simple. His first duty is to Islam not the USA. He lied to cover up Benghazi, bowed to Saudi King, apologized around the world for the US. He was brought up a Muslim, still is. What part doesn't half of America get."
,ercwynn,2012-10-29T14:41Z,""" Obama---he is as far left as they come.""
Yeah, thats why his political policies have consistently come in to the right of center.   The problem republicans have is that they've swung so far to the extreme right that they make Reagan look like a liberal. 

sharkzbite, the part that people like you dont get is how a man who brews his own beer,  eats pork, and repeals DADT and opposes DOMA can ever be considered a muslim.  Check your own delusions.  "
