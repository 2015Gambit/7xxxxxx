,chavesito,2012-10-31T15:56Z,19.6 % and no further
,kaktus66,2012-11-02T15:57Z,"hey boyz they are a small indie group, consider buying it!"
,hagehun,2012-11-03T09:21Z,"I would consider buying it, but it costs a little too much. I mean the want 30$ for the basic game, that's more than minecraft cost when it was in alpha. This game is also in alpha and I am not sure if I would like it. So in case it's worth the money I wouldn't hesitate to buy it. Hear my word :)"
,Saphykitten,2012-11-03T21:31Z,"The game looks really good on my friends PC, however I will wait and purchase it fully when it gets released on steam."
