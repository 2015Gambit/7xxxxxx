BACKGROUND
This positive psychology iPhone app was developed by Signal PatternsΓÇÖ SP Labs research team, which includes Dr. Sonja Lyubomirsky, author of the book The How of Happiness and professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside. Live Happy is based on Dr. LyubomirskyΓÇÖs happiness research and key elements from her book.

Going about life in a way that makes one happier is a skill that can be acquired and mastered when one consciously chooses to commit and work at it on a daily basis. ItΓÇÖs similar to the way a physical exercise program involves small individual tasks like lifting weights or running that add up to a healthier and more efficient body. By creating an application for the iPhone and iPod, weΓÇÖve made it easy for anyone to follow this research-based program wherever they are, and follow the simple daily activities that can result in a new mindset.
