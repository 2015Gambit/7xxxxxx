[T],_SnakEye,2012-10-31T19:25Z,"I am not familiar with that error message you talking about as I do not run the ASE_DATA DLL file.
at what stage in the FSX loading process it asks for activation? "
,hini29,2012-10-31T22:31Z,With the new Aerosoft Launcher you can only use same serial at 3 different computers at time. You have a program that can generate serial and e-mail for Aerosoft Launcher?

Thanks Snakeye.

For those having problems:
1 Install usins serial email supplied.
2 Do not activate when it tells you to
3 Go to your dll.xml file and you will see this


    ASE-Data
    false
    False
    AerosoftASE_DATAAseData.dll



4 change false
to: true

Done!"
