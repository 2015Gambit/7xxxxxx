Frankfurt Hahn was built during the allied occupation by then US. At first it was planned to build the airport near the town of Hahn but planning later took the airport to the village of Lautzenhausen. Americans though had difficulty in pronouncing the name ΓÇ£LautzenhausenΓÇ¥ so they stuck with Hahn.
In the first years of its civilian use it was called ΓÇ£Rhine-Mosel AirportΓÇ¥ but then its name was changed under marketing aspects to Frankfurt-Hahn although Frankfurt is more than 140km away.
