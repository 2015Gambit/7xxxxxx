With a single touch, Sarah Meiville can see the final moments of a dead personΓÇÖs life. Though this gift once made her valuable to the police, the cops have shunned her since a tragic turn of events cost innocent people their lives. Then dead bodies started piling up, a bizarre symbol on their foreheads. Soon, whispers of the Nothingman could be heard on the rain-slicked streets of the city, prompting a tabloid writer to lure Sarah out of retirement to stop a madman.

Guide Sarah through a classic noir adventure as she searches for clues, solves puzzles and learns to use new visions that appear to be helping her. The Gift will transport you through a town steeped in neon glow, challenge you with cunning mini-games and surprise you with cleverly hidden objects. From the music, to the visuals, to the voice work, The Gift is an unforgettable cross between a moody ΓÇÖ40s detective movie and a modern occult thriller. Can you bring the killer to justice and restore SarahΓÇÖs name? Lives are depending on it!
