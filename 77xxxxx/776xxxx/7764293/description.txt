Opening with lively flute, drums and hand percussion, followed by staccato piano, fuzzy electric guitar and the unmistakable sounds of the
 Moog, it’s clear Alusa Fallax are yet another serious contender in the Italian progressive rock sweepstakes.
 A five-piece from Milan, Alusa Fallax were formed in 1969 deriving from Gli Adelfi, and released their first single the same year, with a
 second one not long after.
 Also in 1969 one of the members (there were two of them with the same name) released a solo single as Guido degli Alusa Fallax (Guardarti
 negli occhi on West Side).
 The band kept playing and released their one and only album in 1974 on Fonit; a great little-known gem, in the best Italian prog tradition,
 led by keyboards with classical influences, it reminds the best things Banco del Mutuo Soccorso ever made.
 No less than 13 tracks are listed on the label, but these are connected to form two long suites very well played and sung, and with
 interesting lyrics.
 Unfortunately the band had very little promotion and kept playing in the dance floor circuit until 1979, issuing a commercial single in
 1977 under the name Blizzard.
