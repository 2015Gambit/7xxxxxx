,Mortalenemy420,2012-10-28T02:41Z,I posted those youtube videos along time ago lol  but now you posted with faster speeds I'll probably take mine down..cheers
,Decompress,2012-10-28T02:46Z,It's converted from my itunes rip to mp3.  Not everyone likes mp4.  I'm one of those people.
,Strangeattack,2012-10-28T02:59Z,"mortals torrent but still good, at least he increased his speed and deleted those damn youtube videos. Tech never lets me down."
,Mortalenemy420,2012-10-28T02:03Z,what media player do you use? zune or Wmp? or other?
,Decompress,2012-10-28T02:14Z,"This isn't mortals ""torrent"" (obviously) Hash on every file is different if you was wise enough to notice.  I use iTunes and Winamp as well.

Done my initial seeding, past 50+ 15.0 ratio.  All on y'all now.  Enjoy the music"
,Urumii,2012-10-29T09:03Z,"This isn't an iTunes rip, this is from urbanleakz. There are a few skips in all of the songs from the urbanleakz version, and the skips are in the exact same spot on this torrent."
,Decompress,2012-10-30T00:22Z,"""urbanleakz.com rep""

If you read above your own comment, this is where we originally leaked it.

Mp3 & iTunes version available on there as well. :)"
,Strangeattack,2012-10-30T01:59Z,"Just realized the skips as well. Guess I'm downloading mortals..neither are itunes rip, and his has more seeders + good quality."
