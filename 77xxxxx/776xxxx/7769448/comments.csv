How interested in back issues of The Comics Journal are y'all?

Very? You'd like all of them, or as many as possible.

A little? There's some that you would download individually, but you're not really looking for a complete run.

Not at all? You're not interested.

Keep in mind, to the best of my knowledge, a complete run DOES NOT YET EXIST. There's a lot of them ""out there"", but many of the more recent issues are not easily found. Also, the file size on many of them is as big (or bigger) than a good sized TPB.

Any input on this will go towards helping me decide whether or not I'm going to keep compiling them and/or, eventually, upload them. "

,muckymucks,2012-10-29T07:07Z,"I'd also like to see as many Comics Journals issues as possible. There's some great stuff between those pages.

Thanks for all your time and effort, LeonardTSpock. You post some incredible and hard-to-find items."

,Val_Wood,2012-10-29T12:20Z,"Don't know if you saw my previous post on another torrent, if so, sorry. I have been looking for Scarygirl by Nathan Jurvicius. Black_canary said you might be able to find it. Thanks a bunch either way"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-30T02:20Z,"First of all, everyone is most welcome.

Second, all requests have been added to my search list. I'll upload them when/if I find them.

Lastly, OK, it looks like I'll be uploading some TCJ issues at some point in the future."
