,AnonymousUsernameHere,2012-10-28T09:55Z,"@Firestorm4594 Extract any of the files using 7-Zip or Winrar or something and then copy all the files from your 'SKIDROW' folder to where you installed Borderlands 2. You'll know it's right when it asks you to overwrite a few files, and when it does that hit 'Yes' for all of them. 

In-case it isn't clear, you need to have already downloaded and installed the whole game prior to installing this update. 

@Kingsanx According to the changelog.txt supplied with the torrent:

Borderlands 2 Update 1.1.3

- Added a toggle for whether textures should fade or pop in when a higher-resolution version loads. High-end computers can disable this to avoid seeing lower-resolution textures streaming in.
- Added the ability to reset all challenge progress for a character once they've completed 85% of all non-DLC, non-area-specific challenge levels. This will keep the player's current challenge bonuses and rank, but reset all challenge progress to 0 and allow challenges to be re-completed for additional ranks and bonuses. Resetting is available on the ""challenges"" screen of the status menu and will display as a tooltip at the bottom of the screen if the player has met the criteria.
- Fixed a bug where profile files set to ""read only"" were not being saved.
- Fixed a performance issue in Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty content with PhysX set to Medium or High."

,GObonzo,2012-10-28T13:30Z,any confirmation that this actually works? none of the last packages thru to Update5 worked on my install except nosTEAM's.
,brianxxx,2012-10-28T15:39Z,I cannot speak directly since I bought my two copies of Borderlands but my friend is SKIDROWing it and all of their updates have worked perfectly for him on Win 7 64 bit. Though he clearly loves the game he should have fucking bought a copy by now!
,MistryWho,2012-10-28T17:18Z,"right brianxxx, ""your friend"""
,fairyboi88,2012-10-28T19:45Z,I assume that I do not have to install the previous updates right?
,GObonzo,2012-10-29T03:04Z,"confirmation that it didn't work.

had to extract .exe and steam.dll(s) from nosTEAM version again to run the game.

Windows 7 x64 SP1"
,brianxxx,2012-10-29T15:56Z,"Yes, my friend. I bought my two copies online from Amazon. My girlfriend loves Borderlands and we lan and online game together. If I pirate something, I say so. 

My friend has not bought his copy."
,GObonzo,2012-10-31T02:31Z,"everyone that has legit copies comes to the torrent links just for fun, you know..."
