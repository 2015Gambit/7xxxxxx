,excite98,2012-10-27T09:40Z,Thank you very much Sec!
,Dirkastanian,2012-10-27T09:47Z,"Thanks, appreciated"
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-27T09:54Z,Welcome. :)
,AucklandNZ,2012-10-27T11:36Z,Appreciate the upload. Thanks!
,HHHarper,2012-10-27T14:24Z,seems to have some sound and video quality issues.
,wadast,2012-10-27T18:21Z,"That compresion make crash my players, VLC and others :/"
,Hoirc88,2012-10-27T18:35Z,"Thanks for fixing man. I was confused with the no audio first one lmao.

@ HHHarper maybe you're just used to hd..? This is only standard 480p bro."
,meltin,2012-10-27T21:33Z,"@Horic88 I'm 15 minutes into it and I can definitely confirm what @HHHarper said about the audio, as for video, there's nothing wrong with it, imo, just occassional satellite pixelated. 

Almost like there's an echo of what's just been said. It's not terrible, but annoying enough to make me stop and wait for another release. Like certain noises/sounds make a 'thwack' type sound. Turning the sound down to 62% in vlc player helps, but it's still there.

Still, thanks for the effort of upping this and re-upping it, maybe the third time around there'll be no audio issues? ;)"
,meltin,2012-10-27T21:43Z,"Um, I was wrong, there is problems with the video. A lot of sattelite pixelation during the fight. Can't continue watching. Will wait for an alternate release. Thanks anyway for the effort Sec."
,Hoirc88,2012-10-28T01:24Z,"I'll agree here after watching what I could there are a lot of issues.. ""popping"" sound all throughout the episode and when trying to play this in my 360 I am constantly getting an error and playback stops."
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-28T01:26Z,"No sound issues at all, but there is about five little video glitches from the broadcast that lasts about two or three seconds each which is out of my control. "
,You_Muppet,2012-10-28T03:57Z,"Excellent quality for the size, thanks Sec!!

PS: I'm a big fan of Shane, but I hope BC wins."
,ZWEMG,2012-10-28T06:21Z,It was probably raining pretty hard when this was recorded on his sat and that is why there are a few audio and video glitches--use VLC to watch it so it doesn't stop playing on you.  Thanks for the UPLOAD!
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-28T10:33Z,There's a hurricane coming my way. Things are quite windy. Service may not be 100% till hurricane passes.
,kadx7,2012-10-28T18:50Z,do your self and us a favor and stop ripping cuz you suck and your ripping quality is garbage.
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-28T21:35Z,"@kadx7
No, I do not suck.
No, my rips aren't garbage.
Yes, I don't like idiots downloading my files.
Yes, you're one of those idiots. 
Congratulations."
,5C077,2012-10-29T10:51Z,"Thankyou Sec, some of us are glad it's only a few seconds we are going to miss and not the whole thing! But you know, next time if you wouldn't mind controlling the weather a little better so that I can get a better DL it would be appreciated :Ă&#x17E;"
,PCdoc7,2012-10-29T14:07Z,File is badly corrupted.  On PS3 player it stops at approx 3 mins into it.  I tried converting it to AVI but ended up with frozen images and using another converter the sound synch went way off.  I would not recommend this file for download.
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-29T15:14Z,"There's always the far better 720p rip for those who care about the few seconds they're missing. If you know how to convert video, just convert the 720p then. :)"
,SubZero00,2012-10-29T16:50Z,"Appreciate the upload, but sorry to say file is corrupted.  Stopped at 31:28 for me.  Missed conclusion of fight and end of the show."
,Sick3r,2012-10-29T20:07Z,Same here.. audio issues. irritating popping and glitchy sound. thx for the up though. Hopefully next one will be perfect =) 
,priced324,2012-10-30T05:50Z,"Garbage, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.thanks anyway"
,distVidz,2012-10-31T09:33Z,I know it's douchey to complain about a free DL and effort put into bringing us this video but the quality is bad. The video crashes every few mins and now I have to DL a legit copy. Thx for the effort.
,wardy0,2012-11-08T04:13Z,"i dont understand what all the whining is about. if you dont like it, download a different one and if it was really as bad as some of you say, dont use seclude again. thanks sec, apart from the reception issues, its perfect. thanks."
,wardy0,2012-11-08T04:14Z,"oh and @priced324, your garbage, fuck off and die quietly"
