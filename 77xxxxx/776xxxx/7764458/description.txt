Videsh aka Heaven on Earth

Ludhiana-based Chand gets married to Brampton-based Rocky Singh Dhillon and re-locates to Canada, to live with him and his extended family, consisting of his mom and dad; brother Baldev and his wife, Aman, and two children, Kabir and Loveleen. From the honeymoon stage itself, Chand gets physically abused by Rocky, and despite of bringing in $20K in dowry, she is immediately hired as a laborer even though she is a graduate and her wages are paid to her husband, and is not even permitted to call back home. Tenants occupy the house during the daytime, and the entire Dhillon family usually stay put in a shopping mall. Things only get worse after Rocky brutally assaults her in everyone's presence after she gets into a physical altercation with her mother-in-law. She manages to call back home wanting to return back, only to face discouragement, as her family want Rocky to sponsor her brother...
