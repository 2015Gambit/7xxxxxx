Abbas Ali lives in Karol Bagh, New Delhi with   
his sister Sania. They are legally fighting for 
an ancestral property - land case. But the odds 
turn against them and they lose. Their well     
wisher, Shastri Chacha, advises and convinces   
them to migrate to his village Ranakpur where   
he assures Abbas that he will get him a job at  
his owner's place. The owner being none other   
than the powerful Prithviraj Raghuvanshi.       
Abbas enters Ranakpur village and while saving  
a child trapped inside a temple, he breaks open 
the lock of an ancestral temple but fate plays  
an important twist in Abbas' life as the whole  
village including Prithviraj's step-brother     
Vikrant opposes Abbas' actions but Prithviraj   
arrives and handles the situation. On being     
asked his name, Abbas's friend comes out with   
a fake name, as it would create a rage if       
villagers came to know that the lock of a temple
had been broken by a Muslim
