"A Casebook of Family Interventions for Psychosis" is a practical guide to implementing family interventions for psychosis. The book discusses different family needs and illustrates different approaches to offering the interventions. It describes a number of clinical cases in full ΓÇô including the theoretical basis, engagement, assessment, formulation, intervention plan, progress, revisions, outcome and critical appraisal. The cases are described by a range of professionals, such as those in psychology, nursing, social work and family therapy, as well as relatives who have taken part in family interventions. These combine to provide a ΓÇ▓real worldΓÇ▓ view of such cases, which places emphasis on what can be learned from the process.
