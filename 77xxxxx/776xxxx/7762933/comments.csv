Seeding with 200mbit/s but please continue seed you too aswell :)"
[V],HeroMaster,2012-10-26T21:14Z,"Nice work Stif, get to go with this one :)"
,death1223,2012-10-26T21:19Z,"We need a multiplayer crack for this, that's what makes the game fun."
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-10-26T21:57Z,"hehe your welcome HeroMaster :)

@death1223, you dont think its possible to play LAN over internet? Like hamachi or tunngle.. you should try that :)"
,fattiglapp,2012-10-26T22:15Z,"It tries to connect to the game servers when you try to play multiplayer, so you have to update in order to actually join or create a game. Would be nice with a workaround for that."
,csandaz,2012-10-26T23:25Z,"The problem is that, like in the 2011 all multiplayer data going through the master servers...

What i do not know that they state you can play lan... but if you need internet to go to lan there is no point...

I hope that skidrow can crack the game, that we can play lan, on tungle or hamachi..."

Besides, game got great reviews and sold over half a million copies already. "
