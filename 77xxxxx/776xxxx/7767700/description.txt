Directed by the renowned director Adri√°n Caetano, which sets tongues wagging in film-are memorable Un Oso Rojo, Bolivia and Pizza Birra Faso, as in the controversial TV series Disputas and Tumberos, here's a different short: Cuesta Abajo, of 1995. Beyond the tango, this film is playing with the circularity of time, with the effect Bioy Casares used in his famous novel The Invention of Morel, and the fate that warns, occasionally cheating, but ends be revealed as irremediable and fatal. A short film which limits the words to tell the story in pictures: merits and invites second readings to see him again and again.
