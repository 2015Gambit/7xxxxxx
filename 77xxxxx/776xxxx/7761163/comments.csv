,Defiantcm,2012-10-26T14:08Z,"not final:( i looked at thesystem file with wordpad and its build is 9200, and released 9/3/12"
,brunosorocaba,2012-10-26T15:41Z,"according to this= http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/software-technology/difference-between-rtm-and-final-windows-7/

RTM is the same as FINAL. Differences are in documentation, but whole system is  the same."
,Sphaa80,2012-10-26T16:12Z,"RTM=Final version! RTM is the one they sends of to get printed on DVDs. What do you think, that they send the final verison to factories the same day as it's available in stores? Some people are just too stupid!!!"

,moviekil,2012-10-27T03:49Z,"oct/26/2012 today windows 8 came out officially final but it is the samething running on RTM's (9200) those skeptical now they can see that theres no difference in anything , only that now the windows 8's are available in stores on a dvd,,just so simple..I read so many comments about this and that and badabin bada boon and what ? still the same windows 8? no deactivations or anything so far like few were predicting, ignorants.."
,moviekil,2012-10-27T12:31Z,"@geotsaki  hope you wont get offended but when you write the keys (activation keys)  on comments  that is how they can find it so easy and blacklist them right away.. better put it on a torrent or by email, anything but not here ,,maybe by now those keys aint working anymore, most possible."
,moviekil,2012-10-27T12:35Z,"PS. past comment was for TheBillGates ,,,,NOT for geotsaki,,mistake ... past comment about the keys was for  TheBillGates.. ,,excuse me..."
[H],shirepirate,2012-10-27T14:42Z,"there is no ""official final"" build. the RTM (version 6.2.92001) is the same build that has been out for months now, and it has only just gone for sale in stores. there is NO retail final version. you can get the official ISOs from MSDN at this torrent, both 32-bit and 64-bit:
https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7764223/

Until a permanent activation method comes up the 180-day KMS solution is what is available.

I hope this alleviates some confusion. once again, this is the torrent you want for an untouched, retail ISO of Windows 8 professional:

,moviekil,2012-10-27T17:01Z,"@shirepirate thats exactly what i mean for those who were skeptical about the final  or official date and bla bla bla,, LOL,, this are the windows 8 and thats it.. agreed with shirepirate... Always few are so paranoid,,oct-26 -2012 is only that you can now go and buy this same windows but with activation product key at the stores,,thats all but the windows are the same..."
,loveofthegame,2012-10-27T23:05Z,"Downloaded and installed seamlessly. Everything seems to be working perfect, but says the key is invalid. I tried the keys listed from TheBillGates but they have been blocked. 
Excellent torrent though....Thanks NepsterJay"
,daol215,2012-11-15T07:38Z,"for some reason I get stuck at the first splash screen, with the white dots spinning around, tested burning it to both dvd, and usb stick, same with both, any idea why? btw, nothing at all on my computer atm, since it was delivered that way"
