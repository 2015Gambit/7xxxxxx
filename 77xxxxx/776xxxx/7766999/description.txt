Hampton Timber - Jenny & Brett are replacing their loved Californian Bungalow with a sculptural, Japanese style all timber house with wrap-around pool. Pure dedication ensures this uniquely challenging build triumphs despite the challenges.After living in the same home in Melbourne's Hampton for 20 years, Brett and Jenny are set to embark on a journey of blind faith, giving Brett's architect cousin Tim free rein to build a replacement for their time-honoured Californian bungalow. His exciting design will be a clear stand-out in the street. Tim is breaking new ground, the builders are thinking out of the box, and the family is about to leap from a conventional lifestyle to an uber-contemporary one.
