,dubswagga,2012-10-29T03:29Z,"thanks so much man! This is a glorious season for the IRISH ! I need to capture every last drop of it before it's gone. The OU game was the best yet.

If you do manage to upload the BYU game that'd be so great! Thanks again."
,MC26,2012-10-29T04:08Z,"So thankful for this upload thanks.  And to the people who want the BYU game, or any home game the Irish play, you can watch it streaming on NBC's sports website.  But for these away games where NBC doesn't have contract rights, I'm thankful.  Can't believe I fell asleep in the 3rd quarter :("
,MC26,2012-10-29T04:09Z,"Meant to say it was free and available 24/7 on NBC's site as well, of course   GO IRISH!"

[V],Nepotu,2012-10-29T15:18Z,"Thank you all to your great words. I can't download Brigham Young @ Notre Dame because my small bandwidth, but I give you the 4 links of direct download:

You have to erase all *. Click on ""No tengo dinero, quiero descargar de forma gratuita"" or ""I have no money, I want download for free"", then wait 30 seconds and you have to fill 2 words, pres Enter and click ""Download file"". Sorry guyz! It's all I can do for you."
,dubswagga,2012-10-29T21:29Z,"^^ for the first above link, it tried to download a 980 MB file called file.html. I then copied the download URL to my address bar and removed ""file.html"" and it started downloading a 980 MB octet stream? I'm not sure what that is but it sounds like video. It's so slow though, currently estimating that it will take 9 hours. We must find a better way. Thanks for trying though."
,kadidarm,2012-10-31T07:27Z,thank you soo much.  I am overseas Irish alumni and have been looking forward to watching this game
