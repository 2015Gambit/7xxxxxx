Plot: Brian, a devoted company man whose fiancée has just walked out on him, escapes to a rundown but charming old cottage he’s just purchased on Maine’s countryside. But he soon figures out he is not alone when he encounters the spirit of Nora, a beautiful woman who is -- quite literally -- living in the past. Realizing they are living in the same house, fifty years apart, Nora and Brian form a special friendship. Brian’s life will never be the same as he tries to break through the time barrier to protect Nora from her abusive husband and potentially save her life.
