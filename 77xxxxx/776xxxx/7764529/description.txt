Hi there
Here is our remastered BrDrip version about "Pulp Fiction".
To avoid to seed a too large size of this movie,we have downgraded both DTS-5.1 sound track to simple AC3-5.1 512 kbps speed/16 bits/48 Khz/6-ch
however screen resolution will be to hd.1080p anyway
Finale size : 11,2 gb and result is good as well.
Video and sound are very acceptable anyway.
Please,if you give us a bad or average ranking about any of our movies,try to explain why and stay constructive so.
Be logical 'cause without giving us your tips,this is not really cool so.
Ty for understanding
