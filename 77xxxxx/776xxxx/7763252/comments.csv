,frysamosa,2012-11-10T10:09Z,"As an unemployed student, I really can't justify paying $369 dollars for software or even pay for it right now if I wanted to. $369 really is way too much. If it was like $10-$50 I would reconsider pirating but I do want to be able to study more of God's word without going into debt. Thanks for the up bbrush."
,jjdoe43,2012-11-14T12:16Z,the wait is over! thank you so much!
,sweetmother,2012-11-19T21:49Z,"Thank You so much, bbrush. im learning the how-to's of this version and will proceed to give it to bible students who cannot afford it in other nations where our boys and girls are persecuted.
Jesus Christ is coming back soon- when are we supposed to have these things? we need it only her on earth- not up there.
if you notice, the muslims, jehovah's witnesses, and mormons, and other religions or anti-religions, are arming their members with the latest and greatest they could muster from their respective theologies (or lack thereof, as in atheism and agnosticism) - and these for free!
by the way, this program is complete with just about anything you can possibly need. the included unlock modules work- except for Grudem's systematic theology. all my previous 316+ bible languages (like ojb, qsm, peshitta, etc.) were just copy/pasted from bibleworks 7&8 and they work here, as well as discontinued modules (like Futato's beginning hebrew).
you can save the entire  on an external drive for easier distribution so that the next time you only have to do a basic installation, then copy paste that backup into install directory, and all of your modules and even personal settings are retained. 
my wishlist for this program would include great commentaries, if someone can upload them as well, such as Word Biblical Commentary, New International Commentary. they're really expensive.

Thank You."
,conspyr,2012-11-21T23:02Z,"Thanks a lot bbrush for sharing it!!! it took hours and hours to download it but it is whorh having it. I noticed that the 30 (about) serials are relevant to great modules (like that of BDAG, HALOT and the rest of them). Unfortunately they are not activated even after when I am asked to restart the computer. Onlyt the BW900 (BW9) is activated. This happens in spite of the confirmation in the activator.exe that all are activated and I have to restart my system. Any suggestions? Can someone of you tell me how I can activate module from the BW 7 to BW 9? Thanks a lot for any kind of help or suggestion"
,conspyr,2012-11-22T11:25Z,"I AM VERY SORRY FOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED MISTAKE OF MINE. ALL THE INCLUNDED MODULES DO WORK WELL. FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO PASS THEIR SERIALS TO THE ""DATA BASE ACTIVATE"" AND FOLLOW THE ACTIVATOR.EXE PROCEDURE (ACTIVATION MANUALLY E.T.C.) - PLEASE TAKE CARE TO BE OFFLINE, OTHERWISE THE BW DISACTIVATE THEM AND LET THE PROGRAM BE USED AS A TRIAL APPLICATION (FOR 30 DAYS)...... I NOTICED THAT BY RUNNING THE PROGRAM (BW9) BEING ON LINE. ANY SUGGESTIONS OF DOUBTS ABOUT IT? I WOULD WELCOME EVERYTHING FROM YOU. SEED AND BE HAPPY. BE PATIENT TO DOWNLOAD THE 11.81GB BibleWorks 9. ONCE MORE MANY THANKS TO bbush for uploading such a usefull application!!!"
