Introduction:
The theory and design of artificial neural networks have advanced significantly during the past
20 years. Much of that progress has a direct bearing on signal processing. In particular, the nonlinear
nature of neural networks, the ability of neural networks to learn from their environments in
supervised as well as unsupervised ways, as well as the universal approximation property of neural
networks make them highly suited for solving difficult signal processing problems.
