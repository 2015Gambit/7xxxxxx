Installing Stalkersoup

Step 1) patch your copy of Shadow of Chernobyl to v1.0005


this is the main mod and all the patches needed as well as the first five (5) pre-patches

Step 2) unpack these files using any program that can handle .7z (7zip) extensions to a directory of your choice (i.e winrar/7zip)

now you should have a directory containing the following:
_appdata_ (directory)
gamedata (directory)
gamedata.dbd
gamedata.dbe
gamedata.dbf
gamedata.dbg
gamedata.dbh
gamedata.dbi
gamedata.dbj
gamedata.dbk
gamedata.dbl
fsgame.ltx

copy all these files/folders to your Shadow of Chernobyl installation directory

Step 3) extract the pre-patches 6 -> 8
specifically the files:
TB3D_1_0_9_9_1_fix6.zip
TB3D_1_0_9_9_1_fix7.zip
TB3D_1_0_9_9_1_fix8.zip

unpack the gamedata directory within these files, in the order that they are numbered (6, 7, 8) to your Shadow of Chernobyl installation directory, overwriting when asked

Step 4) open your Shadow of Chernobyl installation directory and go to the directory named bin, find the file named xrGame.dll and make a backup copy of this file (I usually rename it to .bak, instead of .dll, but either way make sure to keep a backup of it somewhere)



copy xrGame.dll to your Shadow of Chernobylbin directory (replacing the file you may have there, after having made a backup of it)
(this file is needed in order for the engine to be able of handling more RAM for the mod)
