,tdreeder,2012-10-29T04:35Z,"Thanks so much for sharing!  I just wanted to request that if you upload any more episodes of The Soup, that you use the following date format in the filename:  YYYY MM DD

It may seem like a small thing, but if you don't use that format then programs like Media Center Master can't properly fetch the metadata.  Thanks!!"
