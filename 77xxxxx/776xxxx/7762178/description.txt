THE HOUSTONS: ON OUR OWN, an all-new docu-series, will follow the lives of the late Whitney Houston's family, led by Pat Houston, Whitneys sister-in-law and manager, and including Pats daughter Rayah, Whitneys brother Gary, daughter Bobbi Kristina and mother, Grammy(R) Award-winning singer Cissy Houston. Whitney Houston's sudden passing left behind a major void felt not only by the world, but also by those who loved her most, her beloved family. THE HOUSTONS: ON OUR OWN follows those closest to the pop music icon as they try to pick up the pieces after her untimely death. Pat Houston, Whitney's sister-in-law, manager and most trusted confidant, manages the business and estate of the beloved singer and her most prized possession, her daughter Bobbi Kristina. The series will follow Pat and her husband, Gary, Whitney Houstons brother, as they take on their greatest challenge, supporting and guiding Bobbi Kristina as she faces the world alone, without the one person she relied on the most, her Mother.
