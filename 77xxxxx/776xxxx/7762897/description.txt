This is a collection of the works of H.P. Lovecraft.  It contains his complete fiction, together with collections of his essays, juvenilia, poetry, and collaborative fiction. [Note: the collection of poetry included here claims to be complete but is not.  I know of at least one VERY politically incorrect poem by Lovecraft which it is missing.] It also contains extracts from Lovecraft's letters.

Two important essays on Lovecraft by Kerry Bolton and a lecture on Lovecraft by Jonathan Bowden are also included, as are S.T. Joshi's "A Dreamer & A Visionary: H.P. Lovecraft in His Time" and "An H.P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia."
