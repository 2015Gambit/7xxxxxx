1. Introduction 
====================================================================
Arcade Moon invites you to a water world of speed boats and crazy
races in Aquadelic GT!
Join the Aquadelic league and race for glory and cold hard cash
across Russian canals, Greek port towns and Caribbean islands!
Become a star as you build up fans in the crowd.  The more famous
you become the bigger sponsors you can land, and the more cash you
can splash!  Buy lavish new homes, bigger and better boats and live
the lifestyle of a superstar boat racer!
As well as classic boat races in the style of a kart racer - designed
to be easy to play but tricky to master - you can also move about the
world between races, looking for new sponsors, or just showing off your
hot new boat to the fans!
But watch out for your rivals as they pound you with their torpedo sharks,
snag you in their dragnets or pummel you from above with the dreaded
bird bomb!  Not to worry - you can hit 'em back harder with everything
you've got!
