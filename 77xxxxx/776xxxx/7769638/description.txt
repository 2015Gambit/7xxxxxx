From the mind of the man who brought us such hits as Wonderfalls, dead like me, 
and Pushing Daisies comes the latest locale in Fullerverse... Mockingbird Lane. 

Mockingbird Lane, based on executive producer Bryan Fuller's script and directed
by executive producer Bryan Singer, is a new, re√Ømagined version of the classic 
1960s comedy The Munsters, now as a visually spectacular one-hour drama with a 
darker edge and tone. 

The cast includes Jerry O'Connell as Herman Munster, Portia de Rossi as his wife
Lily, Eddie Izzard as Grandpa, Mason Cook as Eddie, and Charity Wakefield as 
Marilyn.

This is for all the folk in Detroit who were fucked over by their NBC station,
WDIV, and were treated to some local All 4 Halloween show followed by a repeat 
of Jeopardy! instead of Mockingbird Lane. WDIV just also happens to be the NBC
station that is carried on most cable and satellite services in Canada. 

Even though the Canadian viewers don't count for the US ratings WDIV managed to 
keep the show from being seen by easily 12 - 15 MILLION people on the continent.
Way to go you idiots.

And for those who care about US ratings, Detroit is the 11th largest market in
the US with not quite 2 million people. More than a few people from Detroit 
wrote to Ellen on facebook, twitter, etc. because they wanted to see the show 
and Ellen's wife stars in the show. And yes, Ellen's syndicated talk show is
carried by WDIV :P 

Maryanne Marie Beetle, who first appears in the Wonderfalls episode "Muffin 
Buffulo" and has subsequently appeared in the Pushing Daisies episode "Comfort 
Food", appears in the pilot of Mockingbird Lane.

If you can, do buy the episode from iTunes, Amazon, or wherever. It might help
NBC decide to continue the show. And you'll get the subtitles.
