,dr_huffrhurr,2012-10-29T05:08Z,"Yeah but 1.25gb?? I understand 720p and all but most are usually around the 900mb mark. If we don't reign this in now, when will the madness end?"
,fall1en,2012-10-29T05:39Z,"Thanks!

These 720p files used to be bigger than 900mb, when they first made an appearance, so I don't see a problem with this size."
,dekzz,2012-10-29T07:08Z,"yeah indeed, if you mind the size, why dont you download 300mb ones oO truth be told i love it when i see 1.5gb ones, usually ends up with higher quality"
,Kknewkles,2012-10-29T07:11Z,"Normally a top-notch 720p weighs ~1.34 gb, so this is getting off easy."
,dr_huffrhurr,2012-10-29T09:40Z,Hell no not going to download the 300mb ones. Just saying that most of the other 720p's are 800-900mb with near flawlessness. Don't see why it needs another 350mb tacked on it unless it's going to suck my dick at the end of the episode
,X_Light,2012-10-29T10:47Z,@dr_huffrhurr LMAO
,jamisonman,2012-10-29T15:16Z,"Yeah seriously guys compression has gotten much better and so why download larger files than necessary? You could make the 720p file to be 2 GB if you wanted but why, right? So why make it 1.2 GB when it could easily be under a Gig? And what are ""gross pixelation errors""? What is up with people today? This isn't 1990, it's almost 2013 people. "
,Froglet,2012-10-29T18:11Z,"Thanks mate. Ignore the whining, size isn't everything; it's what you do with it."
,Negumiko,2012-10-29T20:44Z,Size is not a big concern to me. Lots of smaller files have annoying glitches. At least these big files are completely glitch free.
,fall1en,2012-10-29T22:56Z,"@Negumiko

Yes I agree with you. Have had problems myself with the 900mb size, where as the bigger ones never caused me any probs what so ever."
