,wthrman,2012-10-28T15:10Z,"You know, I had no idea I would be watching a show like this. I like shows like Lost, Fringe, Star Trek, Smallville, 24...mostly sci-fi type stuff. I figured this would just be another dumb teeny-bopper show, but I happened to see an episode one day and was struck by the very good writing and depth of the characters. So yeah, now I'm a 29-year-old male that is a fan of ""The Vampire Diaries."" I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone that though, lol. Thanks once again eztv!"
