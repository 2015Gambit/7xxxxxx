Behind all of the cuteness lurks something slightly mysterious and just a little bit creepy. This is the best way to describe the new digital comic book series Sanctuary by Stephen Coughlin. A research station on a secluded island houses a game reserve/sanctuary where the animals seem to be just a tad smarter than the human researchers observing them. The arrival of a Panda bear threatens to upset the delicate balance of life for everyone involved.
