most computer chess enthusiasts use 64-bit operating systems and the 64-bit versions of engines."
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2012-10-30T19:42Z,"The cracked w64 version isn't available yet, afaik, and the release date is unknown. Maybe later today, maybe in a month, maybe never. 

In the meantime you can buy it direct from cruxis.com which requires online activation etc."
,squash34,2012-10-31T10:14Z,"No. Robert went for an oppressive DRM model for this release. I won't support it with a purchase.

I'll have to wait for it here and then seed the hell out of it."
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2012-11-03T03:53Z,If it comes. Nobody knows.
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2012-11-07T01:29Z,"FYI 
Houdini 3 Pro x64 [Cracked by MAC in 2012] is out now and the experts are saying it's the real thing. It should be easy to find with a search. Happy chess! :)"
,ChiliBean2000,2012-11-07T04:43Z,Thank you. Found it easily.  Google is your friend. :)
,yorkman,2012-11-09T00:54Z,"MAC version is NOT full speed!! Trust me. If you don't, then go and download Houdini 2.0c pro x64 and try that. Then, reboot and try H3 pro x64. Notice how much slower H3 is?!"
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2012-11-09T14:07Z,"I've seen some reports of that but most experts agree it's the real thing. Some people probably have faulty computer systems that aren't functioning correctly. 

Each version of software has its own speed. I remember people complaining when a new version of Rybka was slower than the prior version but that didn't matter. It had more intelligence built in, so was stronger overall. 

The absolute speed of software means absolutely nothing. You cannot compare Houdini 2 with Houdini 3 in that fashion. It's irrelevant!"
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2012-11-11T08:13Z,"There are a couple of new w32 versions out now but I'm waiting for the dust to settle. The one you download from this torrent works fine for POPCNT processors. But if you have an older processor without POPCNT, it will occasionally produce incorrect analyis and run slower, or so I'm told."
,yorkman,2012-11-14T07:10Z,"@tpb2009: I guess you haven't heard that those that actually bought H3 (I talked to three people in the forums confirming this) get between 21,000 and 23,000 kn/s on same hardware with the same overclocked processor, speed and position.  

I only get a max. of about 15,000 kn/s with H3 in the same position, or any position for that matter (slight differences). If I try H2.0c I get the same speeds as they do, about 22K. And I had two of them try H2.0c on their hardware in the same position and they still get between 20K and 22K in the same position so the real H3 should only be ""slightly"" slower than H2.0c.

,tpb2009Nov13jb,2012-11-15T08:02Z,Read what I said above. I won't repeat it again.
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2012-11-16T07:22Z,"I've now uploaded the sequel which includes both the 32-bit and 64-bit engines:
Houdini 3 Pro UCI Chess Engines [CBF-Crack]"
,linuxva,2012-11-16T10:12Z,"Thanks !

Thanks in advance !"
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2012-11-16T10:59Z,"linuxva asked:
Please can u upload houdini 3 pro ...I mean full program ?

If you mean by ""full program"" the Houdini 3 packages from Chessbase, ChessOK, etc, the answer is no. Only the UCI engines are cr@cked."
