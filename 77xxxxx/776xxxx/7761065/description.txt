Beauty and the Beast is an American television series very loosely inspired by the 1987 CBS series of the same name. The series premi√®red on Thursday, October 11, 2012, at 9:00 pm Eastern/8:00 pm Central.

Kristin Kreuk was cast as the lead role of Catherine Chandler (Beauty) on February 16, 2012, with Jay Ryan cast in the role of Vincent Koslow (the Beast) on March 2, 2012. In the original series, Vincent had no last name, although he considered himself the adopted son of Tunnel patriarch Jacob Wells. The last name of "Koslow" (that of the original series' creator) is specific to this series. According to the trailer, his last name is now "Keller".

Thanks to IMMERSE for the original source file, however MKV's do not work natively on PS3 so this has been given the SM10 touch. Converted to MPEG2 and re-synced to accommodate that change as configured a few filters to maximise colour on those bigger screens.
This is a regular upload of mine so feel free to revisit, subsequent weeks.

As always I will seed until 50-100 completes and then the rest is down to you as I will be using my speeds elsewhere. Thanks in advance and leave a comment or visit the Facebook page to leave feedback:-
