,poffik,2012-10-27T19:27Z,"Show off elsewhere with your galaxy s3, fact remains, video is pixelated, audio is decent and there's sync problems."
[T],SCSA420,2012-10-27T19:59Z,Oh a Galaxy  S III hater? Well the fact remains the video plays fine here and looks great. Oh and the Samsung Galaxy S III Pwns the iPhone 5 and that's the bottomline 'cause SCSA420 said so!!!
,poffik,2012-10-27T20:20Z,"With that response you discredited yourself, immature git. Keep uploading low quality trash, that's all you'll be good for."
,Katara_dk,2012-10-27T20:24Z,"@SCSA420:

SGS3 4.8"" vs. Samsung 42"" Full HD monitor. 
of course you don't have any problems on your SGS3 because you see it on small screen. 

The video is bad on my Full HD Samsung TV.
The video is pixelated and the audio is out of sync.

God I use KMPlayer, so I can fix the sync problem with the playback function :)

Any way thx for the upload, but next time make it for computers, not smartphones! :)"
