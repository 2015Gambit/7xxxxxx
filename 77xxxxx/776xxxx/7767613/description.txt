David Tennant's Comedy World Cup
Channel 4

SERIES SYNOPSIS

David Tennant hosts the competition to determine
which of Britain's comedians have the biggest
fountain of funny knowledge. Each team is made up
of three comedians: a team captain in their 30s
or 40s, an over-50 comedy legend, and a relative
comedy newbie in their 20s or 30s.

Team captains featuring during the series include
Alan Carr, Andy Parsons, Phill Jupitus, Omid Djalili,
Johnny Vegas and Micky Flanagan. At the end of the
series the final two teams go head-to-head, with one
team crowned winners of the Comedy World Cup 2012.
