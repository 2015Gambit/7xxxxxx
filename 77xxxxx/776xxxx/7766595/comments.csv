,T-Kid,2012-10-29T00:45Z,"So whats the word on customization? Is it back to the classic most wanted awesomeness, or is it completely gay with prebuilt kits like in The Run? Cause honestly I've already got Forza Horizon and if the customization isn't there in Most Wanted, then I'm not gonna bother with it. That's part of what made the original so great in my personal opinion. "
,Youngy22,2012-10-29T02:14Z,@T-Kid There isn't any only upgrades no visuals unfortunately.
,twohearts_left,2012-10-29T04:20Z,"burned 4x verbatim not working on lt 3!

,smilingze,2012-10-29T06:25Z,"you need to run the game through ABGX, the iso is corrupt , its missing 12 sectors , ABGX will fix that and create a new image file."
,droid05,2012-10-29T10:19Z,"just want to give a huge thanks to AiTB ur the best man, ive been wanting this game for awhile. the torrent downloaded fast 15min @2.5mbps. i ran it through abgx to fix the topology and after that burned at 8x onto memorex dvd+r dl 8.5gb 8x dvd using clone cd(using these disks and program ive never had a bad burn with the memorex dvd+r dl disks). thanks again AiTB"

,Firoz0143,2012-10-29T13:25Z,"Will It Works If I Inject The Tapology Data....?

I Have LT 2.0"
,lordofshadow23,2012-10-29T15:10Z,"lol, the game is actually bad.i think it is official that forza is the best racing game for now, anyway thank you uploader."
,dcrock32,2012-10-29T20:11Z,I'm running lt2.0 also and hopefully the patching will work. It didn't for me on assassins creed 3. I don't want to have to go to lt3.0 yet. 
,salazam1,2012-10-29T20:50Z,"the best thing about the original wasn't just the customization of the cars, it was the entire system of implementing the rpg elements into an open-world making you grind for new car parts by busting out missions and races. Plus the handling of the cars of the original is outmatched by anything I have yet to see in an arcade racer.

If the new one sucks, it's Criterion's fault for sure... they lost their touch after Burnout: Revenge. Black Box almost made a comeback with the Run (as EA Vancouver or whatever)... the game was beautiful and the handling was back, but it was too watered down and the checkpoint system was stupid (as well as the un-railed cliffs).

I find it very strange, this concept of a franchise being handled by multiple studios... How is Forza Horizon? They sure had a clusterfuck of studios working on that one."
,salazam1,2012-10-29T21:00Z,"actually I'm pissed at EA all together right now for their general lack of consideration for the split-screen players in their FPSs). Fuck you EA.

(general rant, no reflection on NFS's availability of split-screen... I have no idea if it has it or not)"
,salazam1,2012-10-29T21:05Z,"I can't believe you guys are still running LT 2.0! You're gonna have to switch eventually, if you want to keep up with the releases... the sooner you do it the less games you'll have to re-burn later. I'm still finding games... I mean backups... that I have to re-burn. The good thing is that if it's a game you never play, you'll never remember and then you just saved a disc!"
,steelllynx,2012-10-29T21:12Z,Anyone know which version of the dashboard is required?

about the dash required i don't know.."
,Assassinprofessor,2012-10-29T23:35Z,"@salazam1
im on LT 2.0, what you are saying is that if i switch to LT 3.O i wont be able to play all my patched games from FF XIII-2 UP TO NOW???????
You gotta be kidding me:((("
,spiderforpc,2012-10-30T00:17Z,the grafix sucks at xbox i ll try the PC its look like PS2 on xbox 
,djnasir7,2012-10-30T01:08Z,ThanxXx..!!!
,salazam1,2012-10-30T01:59Z,"@Assassinprofessor that is correct. Anything patched with ap 2.5 or the xgd3 topology. The xgd2s should still work though as well as a few of the ap 2.5 patched ones. You can rip the non-functioning games and then run the iso through abgx to fix the topology data, and then yeah... you have to burn it again. Like I said though, the sooner you do it the better because you can only hold off for so long. Pretty soon that one game will come out that you can't bear not to play and it will only work on LT 3.0. "
,T-Kid,2012-10-30T02:01Z,"@salazam1: Forza Horizon is pretty damn fun since I picked up up. I love the way they went freeworld play and more of an arcade style. Its fun to just get on multiplayer free roam with a friend and screw around in whatever cars you have. The selection of cars isn't too bad. Customization isn't fantastic, but there's a tiny hint of it there that gives you some individuality to your cars. The vinyl/paint options that you can create or download from other players is really nice. I've got exact duplicates of Bryan's skyline from Fast and Furious, and the Supra. But overall the game is a nice change of pace for Forza to release."
,Smallz94,2012-10-30T02:51Z,HELP  does truncate method work?
,smokingmachine7,2012-10-30T05:04Z,"God i hate this need for speed franchise , they suck at making good games, i am not going to download it "
,salazam1,2012-10-30T06:10Z,I'm looking forward to playing both! I will gladly support a studio that does a good job on a game.
,droid05,2012-10-30T18:22Z,"@smallz94 dont burn it by truncate, burn it using overburn instead. It plays much better and just works flawlessly using overburn. I burned this game twice using truncate and overburn and the loading times were faster with overburn and the drive wasnt as noisy with overburn."
,khuman,2012-10-30T21:47Z,Doesn't work at all! 
,crackmaxx,2012-10-31T03:48Z,"so it looks like THIS GAME BROKE MY 360! i haven't upgraded to the new LT-3, i just used X360 Hacker for mac and patched it with XGD3 then burnt)  i got half way through the intro video and it FROZE MY 360!!! and now its doing the same thing to every other game i play, ripped or not! i play it for a 2 min and the game locks up and make a little noise :( after much frustration i went to make sure to that all my cables are secure and i noticed my power cord was half way in:S not sure if that made it freez, i think it was this game. has this type of freezing happened to anyone or heard of anything like this? i just want to know what was the most likely cause of the problem, thanks in advance! my xbox useless at his point. and btw i never used my 360 at online at anypoint during this"
,dudelove420,2012-10-31T10:17Z,"assassin proffessor, yes you need lt. 3.0 to play the newer games. Go find someone in your area that does flashes on an ad site online like craigslist. They do have videos online that you can use on youtube to do it yourself if you know how to flash and I would recommend benq or liteon drive inside xbox for no compatibility issues when playing the newer games. Once you got the flash and you get a ihas burner with burner max you are almost pretty much safe to play online if you do the abgx verification right and the game has been released. (note that there is always that little chance of getting banned, but if you stealth patch right you should be fine)"
,Kuq_E_Zi,2012-10-31T11:39Z,"@ Smallz

I can confirm that the truncate method works fine. played for 3-4 hours and no problem so far"
,ofriko,2012-10-31T14:29Z,"i seeded, and for play good you need lt3 and i used with abgx360 its fix that"
,salazam1,2012-10-31T19:54Z,"BWAHAHAHAHA @crackmaxx thanks for the good laugh!

@dudelove420 I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that dude already knows how to mod his xbox or knows someone, considering he's already on LT 2.0... just sayin'"
,dudelove420,2012-10-31T23:28Z,"@Salazam1, he could know how to flash, but if he has a toshiba disk drive and lt 2.0 and than goes to flash to 3.0 a number of games will be incompatible, just trying to help a fellow Pirate out! "

This is a very large video partition that isn't hosted on the database, so
you'll have to find it elsewhere and put it in your StealthFiles folder --
Since XGD3 video partitions are unique for every game, you probably won't find
it online and will have to rip another copy of the game instead
