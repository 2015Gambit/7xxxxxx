Adapted from William Shakespeare's play "The Taming of the Shrew," 10 Things I Hate About 
You starts off with Cameron, new student at Padua High, sitting in the office of the 
quirky guidance counselor Ms. Perky. He is then shown around the school by Michael, who 
will become his best friend. During his tour is when Cameron first sees Bianca Stratford, 
a beautiful sophomore with one problem: she isn't allowed to date. And neither is her 
"shrew" sister, Katarina, a senior who loves indie rock and feminist prose and hates 
conformity. But Kat and Bianca's father alters his house rule: now, Bianca can date... 
as long as Kat has a date, too. Now, in order for Cameron to date Bianca, he has to find 
someone to date Kat. So Michael helps him enlist the help of pretty-boy/jerk/model Joey 
Donner, tricking him into thinking that *he* will get to take Bianca out if he pays 
someone to take out Kat...
