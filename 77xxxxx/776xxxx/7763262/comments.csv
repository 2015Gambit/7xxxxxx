Can you give me some tips. Sorry, to trouble you, I know you might have answered these sorts of questions before. Looking forward to your answer."

@tomcruz
use megui instead of handbrake.. its better.."
[V],StyLishSaLH,2012-10-29T19:34Z,"Thanks for the appreciation friends :)
Use MeGUI, handbrake is also good, it all depends on the settings you use. The higher the settings, higher the encoding time :("
,tomcruz,2012-10-30T12:15Z,"@ tdktbbt and @ StyLishSaLH 
Thnx. I'll use megui instead. And, you my friend StyLishSaLH keep doing your good work, especially in foreign films category."
