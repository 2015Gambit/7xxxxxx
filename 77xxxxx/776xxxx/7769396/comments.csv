,Hanne70,2012-10-30T17:53Z,"The information says:

Spoken language(s): English
Texted language(s): English

But there are NO sub... Stop giving wrong information..."
[V],psspss,2012-10-31T00:09Z,"some videos do have eng hard subs as I dont watch myself and dont verify at the time not ticking text would be giving wrong info

its better to say if theres text in a video for foreign it will be english

dont take much to see no srt file or subs in the file collection though"
