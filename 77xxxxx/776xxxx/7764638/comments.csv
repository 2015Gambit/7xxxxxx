,tomppixu,2012-10-27T12:34Z,still no win 8 fix :(
,Zlihud,2012-10-27T15:19Z,For win 8 run borderlands2.exe in 98 compatibility mode and then set affinity to use all CPU cores. You'll find affinity under details tab in task manager
,jlc4life,2012-10-27T16:48Z,what is the version of update 6 ?? ... Because I have all previous version installed up to v1.1.1
,darkgamerX,2012-10-27T17:01Z,Zlihud tried that and it caused a lot of lagging crashing long start ups and issues. couldnt even make it past the main menu after trying to change my resolution back to 1920x1080p
,Jayska,2012-10-27T18:22Z,"Does this have the ""Captain Scarlett and her Pirates Booty"" DLC as part of it, or does it need to be d/l separately?"
,topk,2012-10-27T18:51Z,Previous update includes the DLC ans therefore is much larger size - why is this only 100MB? does it mean that it doesn't include the DLC?
,TaZeRz,2012-10-27T19:13Z,"""For win 8 run borderlands2.exe in 98 compatibility mode and then set affinity to use all CPU cores. You'll find affinity under details tab in task manager ""

It won't launch I see it in task manager but setting affinity doesn't do anything further its just hung."

For windows 8 fix

Source included"
,Karlston,2012-10-27T21:09Z,"@Jayska... that DLC is nearly 2GB, this update is barely over 100MB.  I'll leave it to you to work out whether the DLC is included. :)"
,Dervierth,2012-10-28T00:19Z,"I'm getting TONS of .dll errors that are preventing launch. I *think* I have the right programs firewalled (Borderlands2.exe and Launcher.exe) and I green-lighted B2Launcher.exe.

When I run B2Launcher.exe I get an error saying that either I'm missing files, they are in the wrong spot, or they are corrupted. I launch from Borderlands2.exe just for the lulz and it tells me I'm missing a .dll file. I found a .rar of the file installed it and now it gives me a different one. I don't want to get a .dll fixer because they are all bullshit trojans.

So what should I do?"
,Dervierth,2012-10-28T00:24Z,I can't get the game to launch. Everything seems to be fine and I have Borderlands2.exe and Launcher.exe firewalled and I greenlighted the launcher the crack came with. What now?
,Dervierth,2012-10-28T00:33Z,"I downloaded all the missing .dll files by hand and now it says I'm missing GearboxEngine.ini

FML"
,Glassed,2012-10-28T03:58Z,Changelog?
,Jayska,2012-10-28T07:23Z,"@Karlston yeah, I saw that just a bit after I commented >_>;;"
,kingkukel21,2012-10-28T12:28Z,will this work on my kaos repack ver?
,xoxCheesexox,2012-10-28T19:27Z,any help on how to get to the captain scarlett dlc?
,sasukerak,2012-10-29T07:50Z,"i install the update n copy paste the crack 
luncher run but when i click play it minimize n then nothing happen"
,DemiAngelX,2012-10-30T06:56Z,"The game is lagging like complete shit with this new update. It worked fine with the previous, what happened?"
,DemiAngelX,2012-11-10T06:29Z,"Wow, did I just stop this page's entire flow of comments with my last comment? Damn, I'm good..."
