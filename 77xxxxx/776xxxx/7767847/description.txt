Lifetime-Fugitive at 17 [2012]

Air Date: 27 Oct 2012

Summary: Holly Hamilton is a fearsomely independent teenage girl who is always helping the people she cares about, often using her expert computer hacking skills to do so: whether it's hacking into a college database to see if her best friend Blake got an early acceptance, or by defrauding a health insurance corporation to help her very sick grandmother get a kidney transplant. She's not afraid to break the law a little, as long as it means helping someone she loves.
 
But her luck takes an incredibly bad turn when she and Blake go to a rave to celebrate Blake getting into college, and Blake meets a mysterious older man who kills her by slipping her an overdose of a date rape drug. What's even worse is that this man then attacks Holly and frames her for the crime! And because of Holly's less than lawful behavior in the past, the cops are convinced that she is responsible for her best friend's death.
 
But then one day, while she is getting transferred to juvenile hall, a breakout attempt happens to free another detainee, and Holly is forced to escape.
 
Now on the loose, with the cops absolutely sure that she is guilty; Holly decides that she won't rest until she brings to justice the man who framed her, and who murdered her best friend.
