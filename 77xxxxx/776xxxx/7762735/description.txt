This is a working Windows 7 Activator. I personally attest to it's validity and success on my own Windows 7 Ultimate.

I do not know if this works on Home or Professional editions of Windows 7, but I do know it DOES work with 7 Ultimate.


Instructions:
Extract file: Windows 7 Loader
Run: Windows 7 Loader and click Install without changing anything.
It will install and ask for a reboot. Allow it to reboot, then right-click on the Computer menu shortcut, and select Properties at the bottom of the dropdown menu. The page should come up with the specs of your computer, and at the bottom, it will say:

Windows Activation

Remember, always scan your downloads with an antivirus and antimalware BEFORE you run them.

THIS IS NOT A VERSION OF Windows 7 Ultimate. This is a Genuine Activator. Do not complain when it doesn't install Windows 7 Ultimate.
