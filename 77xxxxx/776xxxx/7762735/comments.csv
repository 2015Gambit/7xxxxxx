,Code130,2012-11-14T21:10Z,"I repeat: This is ONLY!!! for Windows 7 Ultimate. You let it run and reboot, and it will automatically validate your copy of windows. IF you are trying to validate the retail edition of Ultimate, I don't know if it will work. However, if you are using Home, Professional, Vista, or XP, this WILL NOT work. Stop complaining about it if you aren't trying to validate Windows 7 Ultimate. "
,RockNRobin,2012-11-15T03:23Z,"Thanks my Windows 7 Ulitmate is now completely legal and activated, your torrent worked like a charm, many many thanks to you, great work!!!!"
,BostonAl2012,2012-11-15T20:26Z,"I'm lost, how do I get by the screen that asks for the key xxxxx-xxxxx-etc during the install?"
,chaostastic,2012-11-16T15:53Z,"This solution didn't help the virtual machine .vhd files with Windows 7 Ultimate distributed by Microsoft, which is probably not surprising but still good to know if this is what you need."
,chaostastic,2012-11-16T16:23Z,In contrast RemoveWAT did work for removing the nagging dialogs. If you install the Windows update update windows updates seem to work too.
