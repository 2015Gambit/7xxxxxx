Many people are just seeing these for the first time, and an image is the crucial decider.
Also, thanks for the descriptions, it makes a big difference.

Comics - they aren't just for geeks anymore!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-30T07:27Z,"""Going lazy"" may be a bit harsh. Compiling, uploading and seeding new files continually is actually a lot more work than you'd think (it takes several hours a day, minimum, to do what I've been doing, for instance). Doing it right (what I consider right, anyway), is even more work. I've said before that I'll continue for as long as it remains fun. But if I get burned out in any way, or if it stops being fun, I'll stop uploading, at least for a while. For now I don't see that being a problem, but I can definitely see where some uploaders might be really into it at the beginning and then lose interest over time. If for no other reason than it has SERIOUSLY cut down on the time I have to read each day, which is something I value greatly.

Yeah, I think it's really important to point out that all uploaders would LOVE to supply nothing but one-hundred percent perfect quality, totally complete runs of all books. Unfortunately, that's not always possible. I download from a lot of different people/places, and sometimes I still can't find what I'm looking for. There are a couple things I've uploaded here in smaller pieces that I have honestly been trying to find for a few years. For whatever reason, I managed to bump into them right after I told somebody I didn't have them. *shrug* Defecation occurs. Also, in regards to some of the larger runs of the more obscure and esoteric titles I've uploaded (such as Modern Masters), I just don't care if it's a complete run in one torrent. Some people feel differently, but I stand by the fact that I must be doing something right if all my uploads are staying seeded. "
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-11-05T04:59Z,That last comment was in response to somebody who got the boot and all their comments flew out the door with them. That's why it looks like I'm talking to myself through most of the comment.

Spock puts in so much hard work and such efforts should always be greeted with a simple ""Thank you!"". keviner does it perfectly by expressing his thanks with details and specifics. I try my best, but I know at heart how much I am profiting from the dedicated work of Spock,  mdusanjay and Black Canary! Thank you again!"
