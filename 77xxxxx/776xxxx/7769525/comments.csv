,Mr.Bookworm,2012-10-29T10:59Z,"Hi, I'm sorry if I have too many requests to you, if you can't find it, it's okay,.. anyway can you please upload more graphic novel published by Campfire, (like the one you posted before named ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) they really make good graphics, thanks... "
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-30T01:53Z,"Crap, I didn't put Campfire in the tags on Huckleberry Finn. Lame! Oh well. Yes, I am on the lookout for those, Mr.Bookworm. I've already uploaded two others...

,Mr.Bookworm,2012-10-30T03:45Z,"@LeonardTSpock- thanks so much for that link, I really appreciate it, you're the best,... =)"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-30T07:03Z,"Oh great cavernous one...

I am always... intrigued... by requests. Unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge and research...

Daomu did not make it beyond issue eight. Even though it says 'next issue' at the end, it appears issue nine never happened (or hasn't happened yet). 

Jennifer Blood: First Blood has only had one issue released thus far. I'm pretty sure multiple ups will appear for that one when issue two finally hits the racks.

The Secret History I can work on. Issues 19-20 are available individually and in TSH Omnibus Vol 3. At this point, I only have 1-18 myself, so I'll add those to the search list.

I grew up reading these along with Daniel Clowes and Peter Bagge and was wondering if you had any comics by or similar to these fine storytellers. Thanks again!"
