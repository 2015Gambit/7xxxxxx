Going to knock out a few requests while BayImg is down. I figure the people who requested these probably don't need a cover image to decide whether or not they want them. 


Issues 1-8 of 'Scarab'

Vertigo/DC Comics, 1993-1994

Written by John Smith

Pencils by Scot Eaton

Inks by Mike Barreiro

Colors by Stuart Chaifetz

The series came about when John Smith asked Stuart Moore for his ideas about a possible revival of Doctor Fate for DC's Vertigo imprint, giving the Vertigo line its interpretation of DC's Golden Age history and characters. However, Smith's proposal was deemed "too extreme" for an established character and he was asked to rework the concept into an original creation, which became Scarab. Scarab was subsequently cut down from an ongoing series to a limited series, which, with pencils by Scot Eaton and inks by Mike Barreiro, ran for eight issues between 1993-1994.

Louis Sendak is a 78-year-old man, and a retired superhero. A green door in his house leads to an other-worldly labyrinth where his father would often disappear during Louis' childhood to collect strange, alien items. One of these items was the Scarabaeus, which latched on to Louis in 1941 and transformed him, giving him mystical superpowers.

This already exists at TPB, but it's no longer being seeded. I'm doing a requester a solid and giving this book some new life.
