This comprehensive Handbook provides an essential analysis of new venture creation research. The eminent contributors critically discuss and explore the current literature as well as suggest improvements to the field. They reveal a strong sense of both the 'state-of-the-art' (what has and has not been done in new venture creation research) and the 'state-of-the-could-be' (future directions the field should take to improve knowledge). The Handbook comprises nineteen chapters divided into four main sections: setting the agenda; theoretical perspectives; data and measurements; and new venture creation through contextual lenses.

This path-breaking Handbook has allowed experienced new venture researchers to tell the world not only where the field has been, but also where it should be going. Their responses have provided an insightful and stimulating resource that will be of great practical value to researchers working in this vital and rapidly expanding subject. Students and practitioners interested in understanding leading edge thinking in the field of new venture creation will also find this Handbook invaluable.
