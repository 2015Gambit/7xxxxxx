Marianne Evelyn Faithfull (born 29 December 1946) is an award-winning English singer, songwriter 
and actress whose career has spanned five decades.

Her early work in pop and rock music in the 1960s was overshadowed by her struggle with drug 
abuse in the 1970s. During the first two thirds of that decade, she produced only two little
noticed studio albums. After a long commercial absence, she returned late in 1979 with the 
highly acclaimed landmark album, Broken English. Faithfull's subsequent solo work, often 
critically acclaimed, has at times been overshadowed by her personal history.

From 1966 to 1970, she had a highly publicised romantic relationship with Rolling Stones' 
lead singer, Mick Jagger. She also co-wrote "Sister Morphine", which is featured on the Stones
Sticky Fingers album.
