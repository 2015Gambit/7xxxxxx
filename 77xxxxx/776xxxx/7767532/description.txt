What Exactly Is An "Ultimate Master"

 It is more or less a catchphrase originally used to designate something was a hi-res rip. But since there seems to be a lot "similarly"
 <cough> named rips now I guess I should explain.
 I try to present the "ultimate mastering" of a particular LP, the "mastering" is not my equipment or process but the source material, it
 has always been about finding the best source. Now my opinion of the best source is subject to change as I experience more variations.
 Whether or not folks think my rip is "definitive" is irrelevant to me, I just try to find the best pressing and don't mind doing the extra
 clean up that comes with not just ripping new reissues or japanese issues. I understand the appeal of these pressings but I don't subscribe
 to the notion that they represent the best source 95% of the time.
