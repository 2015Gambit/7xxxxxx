,fistingU,2012-10-27T22:10Z,Works perfectly for me (tested on tinyiso release).  Thanks for all your hard work themperror!
,SgtMeowmers,2012-10-27T22:13Z,"I don't have a /Content folder on my game (using the steam installed v) Tried creating one but the songs don't show up, any clues?"
,starstrid,2012-10-27T22:36Z,"wow, Themperror, you're god!
can i hope to see a Heavy Metal Gear Pack amongst uploaded DLC? thanks!"
,Piratechnix,2012-10-27T22:57Z,"I have the tinyiso release and I have no "" content "" folder either ..... WTF"
,woa997,2012-10-27T23:03Z,"omg, u have a beer from me if ur visiting Poland :D"
,itsover8000,2012-10-27T23:06Z,"I have the tinyiso and i don't see a content folder after the rocksmith folder, where is it?"
,woa997,2012-10-27T23:12Z,actually i dont have it either :D
,fistingU,2012-10-27T23:24Z,You will have to create a Content folder for the Tinyiso release and put the 3 files in this .rar into the newly created folder. 
,Bair_morritt,2012-10-27T23:28Z,Not a fan of Megadeth but am a HUGE fan of everyone pitching in on sharing DLC's! Thanks bud!
,twinx3,2012-10-27T23:36Z,"I have the same problem, folder content doesn't exist."
,Wiggly86,2012-10-27T23:41Z,"I dont have a content folder so i just created one, didnt work. any other files in that folder except the obvious song files that we might be missing?"
,woa997,2012-10-27T23:46Z,"so i made the content folder, copied files there, and poof, no changes :/"
,cartman6666,2012-10-27T23:49Z,"works great thanks and for those who don't have the ""content"" folder well....create it in your game directory copy and paste in that folder"
,Bair_morritt,2012-10-28T00:15Z,Someone needs to figure out this Tinyiso/ Steam content folder problem. Where are the default songs located?
,drdoodoo,2012-10-28T00:24Z,"Excellent, thanks!"
,roadkill123,2012-10-28T00:29Z,Thanks Themperror this is much appreciated
,woa997,2012-10-28T00:55Z,"when I start game with cracked exe its there, but when I start with no cable crack its gone :/"
,Bair_morritt,2012-10-28T01:04Z,I'm willing to buy a DLC pack right now but not until this adding content issue is resolved.
,Piratechnix,2012-10-28T01:33Z,"O.K. ...... just to confirm ..... I have the tinyiso release with a real Rocksmith cable ..... I can confirm that these do work after creating a "" content "" folder in the main Rocksmith directory and extracting this to it ..... Thanks uploader ...... I need MOAR !!!!!   =D "
,icetech,2012-10-28T01:45Z,Thanks emp!! You are rockin this week... Hoping for the rest of the dlc's soon:) If ubi would have credited us for console dlc's we paid for maybe this wouldn't be going on:)
,woa997,2012-10-28T01:57Z,"it does work with tinyiso release, but not working with nocablefix from piratefrs"
,Switchak,2012-10-28T02:15Z,"@Theemperror Thx so much for this..not my songs but thx for sharing them anyway.
I can confirm it works on tinyiso release with a Realtone cable (just create content folder and copy files there). Its not working on original steam version ofc. Now i hope for some other DLCs like 3 doors down, blink 182 etc. 
@Bair_morritt wich DLCs are you willing to buy?"
,Switchak,2012-10-28T02:19Z,"@Theemperror Thx so much for this..not my songs but thx for sharing them anyway.

,medalcue,2012-10-28T02:50Z,Thanks Themperror! Good job on trying to release more brother.
,Bair_morritt,2012-10-28T02:52Z,I was going to get the Blink pack but I'm still not seeing this pack showing up.
,ergulo,2012-10-28T02:02Z,"If you run the crack ""NOCablE"" the songs did not appear in the list of songs.

Test and confirm.

At the moment the only solution is to have the original cable."
,Aerionix,2012-10-28T02:40Z,"Interesting how the nocable would have that effect.  Hope it gets resolved soon.  Having the cable here, I can say that the dlc works flawlessly after making the ""content"" folder.  Themperror, dude, you really stepped up on this whole release.  Thanks man.  It's appreciated. "
,Wiggly86,2012-10-28T02:46Z,okey so these wont work with the http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7745402/Rocksmith_Installed_Steam_Files version? if i download the tinyiso version and install it will I be able to save my progress somehow?
,Aerionix,2012-10-28T03:40Z,"Haven't tried the dlc with that version, although it did work perfectly in other regards.  But yeah, the tinyiso version saves fine, no issues. "
,kdobbs74,2012-10-28T04:51Z,I am using the Tinyiso version (and the realtone cable) and the DLCs work great! Is there a way to buy and download the DLCs because the rocksmith store in the game does not load.  If there is a way to buy and download I will buy some DLCs and up them for everyone.  Any ideas?
,zachfursure,2012-10-28T05:45Z,@kdobbs74 try the rocksmith website
,s1ak,2012-10-28T08:07Z,doesn't work with Crack By Themperror and Sam2k8
,applepure,2012-10-28T09:02Z,"kdobbs74 i think i figured out a way to buy the dlc's without having the game, but it will be kinda risky on your end. and we will need someone who has the game already so that you could gift him the DLC through steam. i think that we can confirm Themperror as a trustful user.


"
,applepure,2012-10-28T09:07Z,"FIRST of all you will have to go to steam's rocksmith page

SECOND press on see all and choose a DLC you would like to buy and press add to cart.
page 

THIRD select PURCHASE AS A GIFT 
login to your steam account(if you don't have one yet create one) 

select Email my gift 
and then fill out a a user who bought the game i prefer the Themperror 

btw you need Themperror's mail so you could send him the gift. fill 

out the buyout form and let the person you gifted the DLC upload it 

here."
,Phil2003,2012-10-28T09:15Z,"Im not a fan of megadeath, but great upload! I wonder if these would work on a legit version."
,leane1974,2012-10-28T09:20Z,"I just wanted to say thanks for putting this up its totally awesome.
I appreciate the fact that you put the time in for us."
,veky12,2012-10-28T10:49Z,"Thank you, 
hope to see more dlcs, please guys if you have any other dlcs up them so Themperror can do his magic."
,applepure,2012-10-28T12:59Z,Themperror  i sent you a PM on cs_rin_ru its about buying dlc's 
,starstrid,2012-10-28T13:37Z,could anybody just check is there Heavy Metal Gear Pack in tinyiso release?? i might buy a two or three songs only for this one pack!
,medalcue,2012-10-28T13:49Z,@starstrid: No it isnt on the tinyiso release.
,Themperror,2012-10-28T14:58Z,"Applepure, I replied.. and Hmm I thought I put the link to the forum in the description, it got removed apparently

cs_rin_ru  (change _ to .)

And guys, you are all awesome for wanting to help out and stuff, as soon as I get the other songs (by gift or anything) I will upload them for you guys.. "
,Themperror,2012-10-28T15:00Z,"http://cs_rin_ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=61920&p=796524#p796524

(change the _ to . )

 also heres the main forum for rocksmith, (where i did most of the stuff with sam2k8 and piratefrs)

you can reach my by PM on this site"
,woa997,2012-10-28T15:10Z,plz someone make the no cable fix working with dlcs :
,fishboy11,2012-10-28T16:50Z,the dlc works fine for me and i am using the tiny iso version with the nocable crack
,Jack_iAm,2012-10-28T17:27Z,"@fishboy11

can you upload your nocable exe ?"
,Jack_iAm,2012-10-28T17:39Z,@fishboy11 can you upload your nocable exe ?
,drymoused,2012-10-29T02:37Z,Sure hope worthwhile DLC is posted and not just metal crap. The last thing we need is more people learning to play the worst kind of music there is.
,medalcue,2012-10-29T12:42Z,"@drymoused: Theres quite a bit of DLC that got released on a forum. Some Queen, Blink 182 and quite a bit more
http://cs_rin_ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=61920&start=165

Replace the _ with ."
,medalcue,2012-10-29T12:49Z,"Instead of looking through the forum someone posted all the DLC out so far here.

,bapcanpirate,2012-10-30T20:21Z,"If anyone downloaded the Installed Steam Files version with Themperror's crack, you can get DLC working by switching the crack with TinyISO's 'crack only' file, so you don't need to redownloaded the whole TinyISO torrent. You still need to create the Content folder under SteamApps/Rocksmith/"
