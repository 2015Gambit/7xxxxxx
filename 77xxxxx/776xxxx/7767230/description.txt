Issues 1-4 of 'Weird Vampire Tales'

Modern Day Periodicals, April 1979 to January 1980, 68 pages each

Don't actually know who the contributors are, because it doesn't say.

Vampire/horror stories, obviously. Pretty dark and, uhh, 'weird', considering the time they were published. I didn't read every story in all four issues, but I genuinely enjoyed the few I did read. 

The books themselves are of decent enough quality. A few dark pages here and there, but good solid lines and nice definition between the greys and blacks. I tried a 'Restore' on the first two but it didn't do much other than make the files larger, so I left them as is.
