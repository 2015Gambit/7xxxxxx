The Mohawk Nation controls 50 per cent of the cigarette trade in Eastern Canada. They sell cigarettes to non-natives without paying government taxes on them. Canada calls it illegal. Mohawks call it good business.

In the dark of night Mohawk boatmen speed across the river separating the Canadian and US lands of the Akwesasne Territory loaded with cartons of cigarettes. ItΓÇÖs dangerous work, and lucrative. The Canadian government wants to shut it down, but the trade has raised entire Mohawk communities out of poverty and theyΓÇÖre not about to give it up. Shooting over three years, filmmakers Jeff Dorn and Catherine Bainbridge gained extraordinary access to a cast of charismatic characters who tell the Mohawk side of the story, their history with tobacco, Aboriginal rights and the turf wars with federal and provincial governments. Are they criminals who must be stopped? Or are they a new breed of entrepreneurs who deserve support?
