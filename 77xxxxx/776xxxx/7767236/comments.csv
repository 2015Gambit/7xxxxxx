I've got at least 60 more uploads ready to go and another 40-50 in the planning and prep stages, but I've been holding off in hopes that BayImg would come back online. I don't really dig uploading without the cover image anymore, but my backlog of uploads was getting out of hand. I'm going to give it another couple days before I upload anything else. If BayImg isn't back then I'll up another batch."
,autoblank,2012-10-28T10:48Z,"Thanks very much again for these, LeonardTSpock! Yea, was wondering about the missing cover images your torrents usually come with. They've always been helpful, especially when it's hard to find the lesser known comics on google. Hope they'll be back, but no matter. Still appreciate your good work always! Cheers :)"
,FriendlySpidey,2012-10-28T18:22Z,"No one can upload images to their torrents, be it movie posters, comic covers, etc cause the image site BayImg is currently down. I'm sure you'll see covers again once its back up."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-28T20:40Z,"You're most welcome autoblank. Glad you dig the ups.

Yeah, it's weird how visual we are about EVERYTHING. Nothing looks quite as interesting or clear without that little square image in the upper right hand corner."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-28T21:48Z,"I'll post this to a few of my uploads to gauge the response, but I'm wondering...

How interested in back issues of The Comics Journal are y'all? 

Very? You'd like all of them, or as many as possible.

A little? There's some that you would download individually, but you're not really looking for a complete run.

Not at all? You're not interested.

Keep in mind, to the best of my knowledge, a complete run DOES NOT YET EXIST. There's a lot of them ""out there"", but many of the more recent issues are not easily found. Also, the file size on many of them is as big (or bigger) than a good sized TPB. 

Any input on this will go towards helping me decide whether or not I'm going to keep compiling them and/or, eventually, upload them."
,turtlex,2012-10-30T00:51Z,"Thanks for the many quality uploads LTS! 

As for The Comics Journal... I most likely won't be getting any of them.  While I like a lot of Kitchen Sink's output, I think Gary Groth comes across as a bit of an ass in TCJ.  I've never really enjoyed the magazine.  Just my $0.02 worth."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-30T01:50Z,"I actually agree with you 100%, turtlex. I've read it off and on for nearly 30 years and more often than not it's left me with a foul taste afterwards. The opinion pieces and reviews often go way to far into the negative, and have more than once done damage to somebodies career or reputations. But the interviews are great, and they never cease to make me aware of some random, obscure comic book I didn't previously know of. So, yeah, I'm torn. Can't decide if I should just upload the ones I have now (because people have been asking for them), or go to the effort to fill in some of the rather large holes in the collection (which I could pretty easily do)."
