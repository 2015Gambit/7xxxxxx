Moon Lake isn't just any normal body of water - it's a mysterious portal into the weird, drawing all manner of macabre mysteries to its shores. In the spirit of the classic horror tales from EC Comics, Moon Lake combines comedy, horror, and adventure into a fantastic anthology, where each story is centered on the strange happenings of Moon Lake.
