Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are plastic-like polymers produced naturally by many types of bacteria. PHA are among the most promising next generation plastics because they are biodegradable and can be produced using renewable resources. The Practical Guide to Microbial Polyhroxyalkanoates provides detailed information on the various microbial aspects that govern the design and synthesis of commercially useful PHA.

Unlike chemical polymerisation processes, the microbial system involves multiple biological catalysts that convert renewable carbon sources into monomers and finally high molecular weight polymers in an aqueous environment and at ambient conditions. This rather complicated process will be described by giving specific and well-established examples along with new and recent findings. This book provides the reader with important information on the crystalline and solid-state structures of PHA as well as the physical and mechanical properties. This Practical Guide also gives information on the nature and mechanism of PHA biodegradation as these are the factors that will determine the final applications.
