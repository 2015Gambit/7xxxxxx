,ergulo,2012-10-29T05:16Z,Thank you. Working perfectly.
,Michaelcr13,2012-10-29T06:32Z,"Yeah, not all of them but a good amount, thank you very much :)"
,Piratechnix,2012-10-29T13:46Z,Thanks for sharing everyone !!
,ggsus,2012-10-29T18:48Z,Would i be able to use this with the game bought on steam?
,TudaOpp,2012-10-29T20:04Z,"Where do I place these Songs?
I use the tiny version with nocable fix. I dont have a ubisoft/content folder in my program files directory.."
,TudaOpp,2012-10-29T20:29Z,I dont seems to have a ubisoft folder in my program files (x 86) folder.. I have the Tinyiso version.. Where do I place the DLCs?
,Skinote,2012-10-29T21:44Z,"So can we use these torrented DLCs with the purchased Steam version of the game, or not? What would it take for that to work?"
,kdobbs74,2012-10-29T23:05Z,"Make a ""Content"" folder in C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftRocksmith.  Add the DLC .dat files there and run the game.  I use Tinyiso version and they play just fine.  I don't think that the DLCs will work for the purchased Rocksmith. You will have to download the ""cracked"" version."
,TudaOpp,2012-10-30T12:26Z,I dont have a Ubisoft folder in program files.. I have rocksmith installed on E: and would prefer to put all my DLC on E: instaid since my C: is a small SSD disk. Is this possible?
,cztleilax,2012-10-30T13:39Z,"TudaOpp: Just create ""Content"" folder in your Rocksmith instalation folder. It doesn't matter if its C:Program FilesRocksmith or E:RandomShitRocksmith"
,TudaOpp,2012-10-30T17:47Z,cztleilax: Thank you!
,bapcanpirate,2012-10-30T20:20Z,"If anyone downloaded the Installed Steam Files version with Themperror's crack, you can get DLC working by switching the crack with TinyISO's 'crack only' file, so you don't need to redownloaded the whole TinyISO torrent. You still need to create the Content folder under SteamApps/Rocksmith/"
,ChocoboDreams,2012-10-30T20:26Z,"Thanks for the upload, here's looking forward to the rest of the DLCs! "
