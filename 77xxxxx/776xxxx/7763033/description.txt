||		SHOW NAME: Gold Rush					||

||		CHANNEL: Discovery					||
||									||
||		RELEASE TiTLE: Gold.Rush.S03.Special.Off-Season.READNFO.||

||		ViDEO LENGTH: 41m32s					||
||									||
||		NFO NOTES: While not heavily advertised, this is another||
||		Gold Rush S03 special that aired on 10/25. It seems to	||
||		be a completely new episode. This episode uses the same	||
||		episode title as Gold Rush S02E00 which upon glance is	||
||		a different ep. This isn't the Long Road special either.||
||									||
||		Also, we kept this at 640x480 rather than 624x352 due	||
||		to the goldrushgiveaway.com and all new season		||
||		animations at the top in bottom - so if you want to	||
||		remove the black bars at the top and bottom from the	||
||		16:9 letterbox, then crop it yourself.			||
||									||
||		EPiSODE iNFO: In this season kick-off special, the 	||
||		Hoffman crew unveils huge news as they prepare for their||
||		third mining season. Parker wonders if he has wasted his||
||		winter shifting a mountain of dirt and the Dakota boys	||
||		confront the worst Alaskan snows in fifty years.	||					||

||		A huge thanks goes out to those of you			||
||		who don't complain about the video quality.		||
||		It's a TVRip, what do you expect? Familiarise		||
||		yourself with release tags or GTFO. :)			||

||				ABOUT:					||
||									||
||		UNPOPULAR is a lame P2P group that sucks at		||
||		releasing on time and in good quality. They		||
||		do what they can, but without hdtv feed or		||
||		any prior encoding experience, they receive		||
||		more complaints that compliments. We do try!		||

||		sucks, amirite?) but we do try our best to		||
||		deliver shows the scene or other P2P groups		||
||		don't. We also upload releases to cyberlockers		||
||		to download but once they're gone, they're		||
||		gone!							||
