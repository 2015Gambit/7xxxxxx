,Erick880,2012-10-27T06:01Z,Any Word on S03E01 yet please?
[V],psspss,2012-10-27T06:12Z,"so this is not the do or die S03 special either then?

getting confusing now all these specials with the show lol"
,Erick880,2012-10-27T07:09Z,S03E01 is Million Dollar Season aired directly after Special off season
,Luke1382,2012-10-27T10:16Z,"The off season episode is called ""do or die"" which is this one"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-10-27T14:00Z,"The specials aired in this order:

The Long Road
Off Season
Do or Die
-actual season 3-"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-10-27T14:01Z,"And sadly capping messed up for S03E01, so wait until someone else releases it, however if nobody does we'll get a re-airing of it up ASAP. Working on Jungle Gold S01E01 and Gold Rush S03E03 Special Do or Die now. Should be up as nobody beats us."
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-10-27T14:12Z,"Nevermind, we only capped the Gold Rush special that was on last night. Gold Rush S03E01 and Jungle Gold S01E01 are on this afternoon so if nobody releases them by then we'll cap and upload.

Do or Die should be up within 30 or so minutes."
,Luke1382,2012-10-27T14:17Z,thanks heaps
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-10-27T14:42Z,Do or Die special: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7765024
,julenisse11,2012-10-27T15:45Z,when is afternoon for you? ETA ? thanks for the uploads so far =)
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-10-27T17:03Z,"around 3-4 pm PST Gold Rush S03E01 and Jungle Gold S01E01 will be up, as long as nobody else uploads it. If the scene or another P2Per uploads it before then, there's no point. Sorry for the wait everyone, but thanks for being so patient :)"
,R0YB0Y,2012-10-27T17:40Z,Cant Wait for Season 3 Episode 1
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-10-27T22:42Z,"Looks like we won't be uploading any of the other stuff, as KILLERS took care of Gold Rush S03E01 and NY2 took care of Jungle Gold S01E01. Search around. Maybe next week we'll win. ;-)"
,corey58,2012-10-28T02:24Z,"Is there any chance you can upload this in HD? your the only one that have released this epp at all, great work btw"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-10-28T02:03Z,"We don't cap 720p so no, sorry. Wait and see if a scene group or Usenet group releases it."
