Since WWE '13 is realising this Tuesday, I decided to revise and remaster the tracks for WWE '12 and make them more CD like including a cover photo. The tracks sound more arena like and the sound is more comparable to the in game tracks used for the superstars entrances. As Damien Sandow would say "You're welcome".

P.S I will be uploading the "WWE '13 - Updated Entrance Music" sometime soon after WWE '13 realeases. So far there are 22 tracks and my change to more that includes Wade Barrett's V2 current theme and Road Doggs Theme with "ass" encluded for anyone who wants the track. Right now I am done getting the themes Just need To add the in game arena effects to all of them.
