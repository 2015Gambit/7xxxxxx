Wishbone Four is the fourth studio album by British rock band Wishbone Ash. It was a radical departure from their previous album, Argus, containing almost none of the twin-lead guitar harmonies and folk elements that featured in the previous album. Though Wishbone Four was popular among fans upon its release, sales paled in comparison to Argus, and founding member Ted Turner would leave the band after the subsequent tour
