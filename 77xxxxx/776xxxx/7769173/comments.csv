Editor & co-writer of ""Once Upon a Time Machine"" here. I really hope you like the book! 
And if you do, I hope you tell your friends, write a review online somewhere, and/or pick up a nice, big, hold-able copy from your local comic shop or Amazon (they're selling it at about $13...for 400+ pages, that's not %$#@ing bad!). It took a number of years and a lot of sweat to make this book a reality, and it's home to the first published work of a lot of us involved. So support of any kind really means a lot! 
Anyways, happy reading!
(And if you don't like it...sorry to hear it. But at least you got it for free!)"
