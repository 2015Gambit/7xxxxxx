Tenchi no Mon 2: Busouden is an action-RPG developed by Climax Entertainment and published by SCEI. It was originally released on October 19, 2006 in Japan. It is a prequel to Kingdom of Paradise and features the two new protagonists Rou and Shunka. It is set on the continent of Sema, which is far west of the original's continent of Ouka. In Sema, there lies a great gate called Sema Gate, which rises to the heavens. People use this gate as a means of finding direction, because it can be seen from anywhere on the continent. One day, the gate begins to change color, slowly turning red from the ground up. This causes great fear in the people of Sema, as some 300 years back a great disaster in which many lives were lost was preceded by a similar change to the gate.
