Long acknowledged as one of rock music's most intelligent and literary performers, Pete Townshend--guitarist, songwriter, singer and founding member of The Who--at last tells his wild story in this candid and immersive autobiography.Raised in west London by an eccentric grandmother, while his parents were off living the early post-war, rock 'n' roll lifestyle, Townshend describes a frenetic childhood of displacement and abuse. Then, in high school, everything changed when he met Roger Daltrey and formed a band that would travel the world, earning fame, fortune and critical acclaim. In Who I Am, Townshend brings us from the inner sanctum of Eric Clapton's drug-ridden hotel rooms to the feet of Jimi Hendrix and his electric kool-aid guitar; from the first trial performance of Townshend's rock opera, Tommy, in a London bar to his infamous arrest (and acquittal) on child pornography charges.
