,alcutter,2012-10-29T04:38Z,Are you?
,taylise,2012-10-29T04:44Z,"@newtricks2
seems real. the file is Homeland.S02E05.HDTV.x264-ASAP.mp4

does not look fake..."
,kiwij,2012-10-29T04:49Z,uploader has a green skull which means unlikely a fake
,ArwenK,2012-10-29T04:52Z,Hey Newtricks - yep tis real - check the 'files' link. PB is safe - not a 'zip' file with 'extra' txt.
,ronbello20,2012-10-29T05:15Z,I come here every week. Always works beautifully. Thanks!
,Tom_thomas,2012-10-29T05:41Z,I down loded and it would not Play ..........
,Tom_thomas,2012-10-29T05:43Z,"It Did Not Play for me - If it's not ""eztv"" or ""VTV"" - I think that you should skip this onr"
,Zone55,2012-10-29T05:59Z,Asreal as it can get...
,Dufox,2012-10-29T06:33Z,"ettv & eztv are both fantastic uploaders and are both the real deal.

this is a .mp4, if the file doesnt play then download VLC media player & windows media player classic.

if the file doesnt play in either of those media players and u have win 7 or win 8 then download shark007 codec 

if the file still doesnt play then the computer gods hate you^^

if u want to watch on ps3 download Tversity.
its the god of media share programs and will play any kind of video file you put on it. literally :D"
