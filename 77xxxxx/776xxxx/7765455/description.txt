Book Description
Hadoop in Practice collects 85 Hadoop examples and presents them in a problem/solution format. Each technique addresses a specific task youΓÇÖll face, like querying big data using Pig or writing a log file loader. YouΓÇÖll explore each problem step by step, learning both how to build and deploy that specific solution along with the thinking that went into its design. As you work through the tasks, youΓÇÖll find yourself growing more comfortable with Hadoop and at home in the world of big data.

This book assumes the reader knows the basics of Hadoop.
