It is also my plan to convert and upload The Sarah Jane Adventures as well, though that will be longer since I have yet to finish watching the full series. (I like to fully watch a series to be sure that the source is error-free and good quality.)


I'll be sure to post the links in the comments as I upload the torrents, til then, I hope you enjoy the Doctor Who!

One other thing, I've been thinking about converting the original Doctor Who, however the source files are pretty bad quality, which means that the rips for that would be larger and not very clear, would anyone be interested in them as long as they are watchable?"

It's the same quality and done the same as the this torrent. Now I'm off to do the next series. (Coming soon, Star Trek! :P )"

,0victor0,2012-11-17T17:20Z,"Well I checked and it's working on my iPod, but I'll redownload it from my seedbox and make sure it's working properly. It'll be a couple days until I can though since I'm not at home.

Have you tried force rechecking it? Maybe you got some bad data from someone or it corrupted during download?

Anyways, let me know, and in the meantime, I'll check into it on my end. :)

If it is a problem on my end, I'll reupload the fixed episode.

Anyways, let me know if the problem persists after you force recheck it."
,0victor0,2012-11-17T17:41Z,"Well, I was able to download it from the seedbox, and there is an issue. I'll reupload it as soon as I can. Right now though, I'm just in a store using their internet connection right now, and it's way too slow to upload the episode before I leave. Sorry. However; as soon as I get home, I'll upload the episode.

Sorry about that. It must have corrupted when I uploaded it to my seedbox. :/

I'll have it up as soon as I get home in a few days. Sorry again."
,0victor0,2012-11-21T13:53Z,"OK. I uploaded a fixed version of this torrent:

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7847214

Most torrent clients will recheck the file if you download it in the same place as the old file. All that was wrong with S3E13 in this one is that my seedbox cut off the last 8MB or so. ^_^;

If it doesn't automatically recheck, force recheck it, and it'll only need to redownload the missing 8MB.

PLEASE READ!!!

Please, download the other torrent, not this one. I'd delete this one, but I don't know how.

If you already started this one, or are finished it, all you need to do is start the other one and direct it to the same folder you saved this on in. It should resume from where you left off. If not, force recheck it.

I apologize for the inconvenience. This was my first torrent and a bit of a learning experience. Hopefully, this problem won't happen in future torrents.

Thank you for you patience."
