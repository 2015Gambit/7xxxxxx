ClearRecord is the ultimate voice recorder that features suppression of ambient noise during recording. ClearRecord also provides the ability to control playbackspeed without modifying pitch. ClearRecord uses AAC compression technology to allow for efficient storage of recordings (on iPhone 3GS, iPod touch 2G and later devices)

The advanced Ambient Noise Reduction (ANR) technology incorporated in ClearRecord allows the user to record conversations in typical everyday environments with a high level of background noise (street, train, airplanes, classrooms). A sophisticated signal processing algorithm reduces background noise levels in the recording, ensuring higher intelligibility even under harsh noise scenarios. Slow playbackspeeds makes it easier for transcription users and new language learners to slow down and listen clearly to a fast speaker, while Fast playbackspeeds cut short the time required to listen to a long recording without missing any part. Unique algorithms allow the application to retain the natural pitch of the recording even under slow and fast playback.

These unique features, along with the ability to use AAC audio compression to optimize disk memory space, make ClearRecord a must have for anyone interested in recording.
