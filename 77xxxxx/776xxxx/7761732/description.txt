This duo recording with fellow-countryman and drummer Paal Nilssen-Love, was
recorded a year ago at Klub Gromka
(http://www.klubgromka.org/index.php?mode=program&id=2186) in Ljubljana,
Slovenia. Both musicians had already toured before this performance and that can
be heard. the interaction is quite fun to listen to, rapid, telepathic even at
moments, which is even clearer in an environment where everything is left to
in-the-moment decisions. Gjerstad does fall back quite a lot on the higher
registers, making music like excited birds in the trees, as said before. As
Gjerstad describes it himself on his blog, about this performance : "Since we
last played as a duo which was in August last year in the US where we played 13
gigs, I think the music has become more focused and freer. I have to admit that
I think this has to do with the fact that I have been practising a bit more than
before and therefor feel more relaxed when playingΓÇª.".

Nice stuff!
