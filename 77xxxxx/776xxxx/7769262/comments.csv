,danberberberlee,2012-10-29T00:46Z,"Think outside USA ;) 
German channel VOX showed it on October 20."
,funkypanda,2012-10-29T03:31Z,"ok danberberberlee. YOU download almost 6 gigs of information in some bizarre format (.ts), and then post again and tell us."
,fishcough,2012-10-31T15:32Z,"Not a fake, and it plays fine in VLC.
But you'll have to speak German. There's a spoken German translation over everything said in English (except Michael's own interview segments, which merely feature subtitles). And Michael's amazing performance segments transcend language. 
So, a worthy and appreciated upload. Just wish I could turn off the German voiceover!"

,eric_renato,2012-11-10T00:53Z,"Thanx for it, but it's not good for me since it's not English or Spanish audio or subs.

,igorzets,2012-11-24T05:09Z,"Hey guys, just so you know: this version is one hour longer then the one presented by ABC in the US!"
