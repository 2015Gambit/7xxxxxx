Architecture is an art form that provides both function and beauty. Each architect brings something uniquely distinct to his or her work. Learning what makes an architectural work or the body of an architect's work unique is difficult to deconstruct. This book provides behind the scenes insight into the work of 100 top international designers through the deconstruction of 1000 architectural details and projects. An unrivaled sourcebook for ideas, this collection also provides details and information that are not available on this level through any other source.
