,crulk,2012-11-10T01:35Z,"So I installed the program, then installed the patch from the directory without running the program first and got the message that I'm guessing means the patching was complete. But when I open the program it still asks me to buy or register. What am I doing wrong?"
,bAnGBaNg2626,2012-11-14T04:25Z,Same problem here too. I installed the software.. put the patch in the install directory and still got trial version. Just to let everyone know the patch just said some quote.. it didnt say it was patched or anything.
