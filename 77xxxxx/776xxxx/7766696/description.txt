L.T.D. is an American R&B/funk band known for their hits like, "(Every Time I Turn Around) Back in Love Again", "Holding On (When Love Is Gone)", "Love Ballad", "We Both Deserve Each Other's Love", and "Where Did We Go Wrong?".

This group was the epitome of SOUL and Jeffrey Osborne knew how to deliver the emotion and passion in such songs as CONCENTRATE ON YOU, WHERE DI WE GO WRONG and LOVE BALLAD.

SOUL music has suffered a tremendous loss as it has not been maintained, but has been moved over for the FAST POP we hear today that is without substance or even purpose...just fluff and a person being worshiped for little know reason...Justin Beiber and Lady Gaga anyone?

Nonetheless this is "grown folks music" here and I am sure those who download are then same who appreciate REAL MUSIC. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.
