I restarted my seeding so others can download. Remember we are keeping the music alive by seeding, if you grab and go the music quickly dies and you leave people with incomplete files. Seed as long as possible. I can't seed forever, because I just don't have enough hard drive space to keep all my uploads available as well as make new ones available. I seed until ten or more people are seeding as well and then I delete the file from my hardrive for the sake of new files."

,SAMSON4X,2012-10-29T19:42Z,"Thanks Disastor I really appreciate you doing that. I used to belong to Demonoid and the moderators really stressed SEEDING and came down on those who constantly downloaded, but never uploaded/seeded anything"
,SAMSON4X,2012-10-29T19:42Z,"I see there are now 18 seeders, so I am relieved people are seeding now"
