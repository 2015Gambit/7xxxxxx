Video: 720x320 @bitrate 1700 2pass
Audio: English Line AC3 2.0 Stereo
Sample: Yes, 2 included

Sources:
Video: Matine HDCam, HP-Cam, Unique - Thx
Audio: Line Unique (thx Jiinx) great Line

Encode:
that was loads of work guys...
the video was nice, but dark and the ar switches constantly
you either have eggheads or shrunkenheads throughout the movie
and nobody fixed the resolution problems so far, could have been
done nicely the first time, if you really wanted to


took the matine hdcam, split it into parts, found a common resolution
and fixed all parts, so everything is normal now. no shrunken/egg-heads
brightened it up, added some sharpness, and it was nearly done.
took Uniques line, which was synced perfectly btw, cleaned it up and
wanted to add it to my nice video, noticed there was still some video
missing within that 3min spot that was entered already from the hp video,
30secs at least, which i now had audio for but no video, so i took out that
part from uniques video and entered it also where it belongs.

video is now complete...
the resolution and the aspect is perfect too throughout, and
the line is sweet. (fixed the columbia intro song too btw)
all in all got very nice
