Sometimes I wonder if I should stop for a couple weeks and let people process, sort, read, enjoy, etc. But there are so many uploaders now that I don't think it would make any real difference. I'll just have to be at peace with the fact that there is no way people can read all this stuff as fast as it can be uploaded."
