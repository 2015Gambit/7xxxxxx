,pink1905,2012-10-28T16:25Z,"@thirdcitysaint (CM Punk fan right? :p)
No sorry, WWE '13 wasn't released for PC.
If you have an xbox 360, here is a little easy tutorial for you (so easy anyway) :
1- Download
2- Download ImgBurn
3- Use it to burn your .iso file into a double layer DVD (8,5 Gb) -----> Open the program, choose Write image file to disc, select your file (the one you've downloaded), go :D
4- Enjoy :D"
,dudelove420,2012-10-28T19:40Z,"Does this game work with the trunicate or should I overburn the file? Sometimes when I trunicate the xdg3 games they get the disk unreadable error. Other times I get it when I overburn! And yes I know, I should look into getting a IHas Burner with Burner Max and it has to be a ""b"" model."
,dudelove420,2012-10-28T21:16Z,Come on people! Seed or don't download!
,dudelove420,2012-10-28T21:19Z,This torrents been up for days! Seed! 
,luebig17,2012-10-29T05:11Z,does the xbox got to be modd new to burning games
,dudelove420,2012-10-29T09:37Z,"Luebig17, you need to flash your disk drive to LT 3.0 ..... Go online to an ad sites and look for people in your area if you do not want to flash yourself. To learn how to flash there are several videos on youtube showing what you need in order to do it right, I recommend a Benq or Liteon disk drive inside your xbox 360. You will need to extract the key from your original drive if it is not a compatible disk drive with LT 3.0. For instance, I had a Samsung drive in my xbox and flashed it to lt 3.0 but my games still were popping up with the dvd iso icon where the play game should be so I had to switch to a benq or liteon drive. Once you have the LT 3.0 flash you can burn with a DL burner to 2.4x or 4x on IMG burn( note xdg3 games which are 8.7 GB's require a special burner to burn 100% of the file). Make sure to go to youtube to set the right setting for the perimeter checks in img for burning as well. If you wish to burn xdg3 you still can with a dl but you only get 97% of the file, so, this sometimes causes a disk error which sometimes can be easily fixed by overburning that image file. (note to always do a stealth check with abgx 360 by downloading the application off of their site before burning games).

how to burn xdg3 games without Ihas:

1. stealth patch with abgx 360 

2. Open the iso file you want

3. Click on Burn

4. Window will open saying file size is to big click yes to burn.

5. Now another window will pop up asking if you want to overburn or trunicate. click either one, but if you get the clean disk message when playing try burning with the other settings.

6. file should now download and when you get to around 97% an error message will pop up if you overburned (if you trunicate it does not), click cancel and then choose to close the track. You now have 97% of the game. 

Get Ihas Burner to feel safer playing online or risk getting banned. "

,smokingmachine7,2012-10-30T05:07Z,"well those who cant play the new games , i would suggest to get ur xbox 360 jtagged , and those who have lt 3, bad news for them they cant get a jtagged atm , plus u cant even degrade to get a jtag chip installed ... and pls seed the game , i am getting low speed"
,dudelove420,2012-10-30T19:45Z,"Jtags are useless online, the only reason someone should get a jtag is if they are trying to burn games from another system onto their console. You will get banned from playing online and with LT 3.0 you do not get banned! I do not know where you get your info from, but why are you trying to get people banned? If you can't play the new games do not listen to smokinmachine7 and get the latest lt 3.0 and you will be able to play all the new games if you have a dl burner. If you get any errors get an ihas and do not jtag your console because you are pretty much ruining it."
,smokingmachine7,2012-10-31T04:37Z,"well i believe u cant go online with either jtag or lt 3.0 , so ur argument is flawed"
,rauth213,2012-10-31T06:24Z,You can go online with lt3.0.  I've never had a banned console in the past 3 years since I first started flashing.  I run everything through ABGX and make sure the rip is 100% verified and patched.
,hunter131,2012-10-31T06:50Z,does this come with dlc ?
,pink1905,2012-10-31T13:24Z,"I don't go online, so I can certify this works perfectly. I've just tested it right now, great game!

I restarted and I don't get this anymore, it's just at certain times like it's a glitch in the game or something. I played with four other people and it was randomly doing it to players."
