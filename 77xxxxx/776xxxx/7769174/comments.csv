,kinezu01,2012-10-29T18:53Z,"Man, you are the best. Without your posts and The PirateBay I could never have access to all this NFL games. I live in a far, far away country where this game never ""exists"". Thanks a lot again. 
May I ask you if your nick name comes from another language, lets say romanian?"
[V],Nepotu,2012-10-29T21:42Z,":) Let's say, you're not wrong, kinezule. And that far, far away country has one of the best an cheappest internet connection, and one of the best provider company that I met."
,kinezu01,2012-10-30T19:51Z,"Yes, indeed Nepoate. With your help I can get a game in 30 minutes. 
So i presume you are in US to have access to all the games. And you are also a big football fan (american football)... It's hard to find someone around here that watches this game.
Thanks again man!
