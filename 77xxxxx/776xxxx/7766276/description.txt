1. Download all the files
2. Create folder on Desktop, name the folder whatever you want (We'll call it Betabot)
3. Extract Demonbuddy in new 'Betabot' folder
4. Extract Auth in new 'Betabot' folder
5. Extract offsets in offsets folder ('Betabot' - Offsets - file) 
6. Add to C:WindowsSystem32driversetchosts file (I realize it is redundant to implement all 6)
127.0.0.1 auth3.buddyauth.com 
127.0.0.1 auth2.buddyauth.com
127.0.0.1 www.buddyauth.com
188.165.234.190 auth3.buddyauth.com 
188.165.234.190 auth2.buddyauth.com 
188.165.234.190 http://buddyauth.com
7. Extract Patch in new 'Betabot' folder
8. Run patch as admin and when prompted show it Demonbuddy.exe, tick "Disable serverside navigation" if you wish. If failed run again as admin.
9. Open Diablo 3, Run Auth, Run Demonbuddy, Login to Demonbuddy software when prompted as whatever you like (IE. 123 or 1234).
10. Demonbuddy will now generate new folders in the root folder 'Betabot' named Plugins ect ect.
11. Download profiles(pathing to kill monsters), plugins (profile run order/loot customization/ect), combat routines from Ciggarc or the official Demonbuddy forums. 

You should be setup now, if your DB crashes you most likely don't have the correct .net framework. Run the tool in your 'Betabot' - help folder.

Recommended:
Plugins: Radsatom, Giles Trinity
Routines: Giles blank combat routine (for use with Trinity)
Profiles: Act1 or 2 or 3 Champion Hunting
