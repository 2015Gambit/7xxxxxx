The audio of the full concert at Cologne Music Hall in 2005, performed by the above mentioned.

It was ripped from the DVD, into FLAC, then WAV, and is now readily available in mp3 format.

It is not split into different audio tracks, it is just ONE LONG mp3 (2 hours 8 mins 58 secs)

Didn't have the ambition to split it for some reason, but it sort of deserves to be one because when was the last time you heard of a TWO HOUR death metal concert?

Enjoy.
Or don't.
