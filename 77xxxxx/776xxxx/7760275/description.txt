Hello all, I've been a user of this site for many years, though this is the first time I've contributed something.

This is the original Roller Coaster Tycoon for PC. I also uploaded the Loopy Landscapes expansion, which comes with Corkscrew Follies. I have tested this on windows 7 and it works great, though you do need to enable compatibility mode for windows XP service pack 3.

This is a fairly old game, so all you need to do is mount it with daemon tools, or something similar, and run the setup. Just be sure to install the Roller Coaster Tycoon ISO before the expansions.

As I said, this is the first time I've uploaded to the bay so please comment with any issues you are having.
