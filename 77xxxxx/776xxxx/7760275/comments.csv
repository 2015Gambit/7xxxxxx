,pizza413,2012-10-30T05:24Z,Due to no one even slightly helping with seeding I'm removing this torrent. I'm simply not going to leave my laptop running all the time to try to upload an old game for everyone to use for free if no one is willing to help.

No one said you had to seed 24/7, just do it when you're able."
,SD-Ravana,2012-11-07T00:49Z,"Oof, hate to say it, but this torrent doesn't work on my Vista OS. There's a crash at the end of the Expansion Pack installer (Setup.exe has crashed blah blah), and after that, attempting to run the game creates a completely unhelpful exception: ""Exception Raised - Access Violation. Error Location: Unknown""

All troubleshooting fails, so it turns out this wont work for me."
