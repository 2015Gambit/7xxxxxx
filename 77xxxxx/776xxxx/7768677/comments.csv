,LochDhueDude,2012-10-31T01:32Z,"If you repost again, please don't change the ""Rock My World (2002) ISO.rar"" file. All of us are sitting at 99.2% and should be able to complete no matter what client you use...."
,LochDhueDude,2012-11-01T16:53Z,"No word from Jetpump7 for four days, this is looking pretty dead already....

I sure hope not... "
,Jetpump7,2012-11-01T22:01Z,"Hi.
Except for a few brief moments, I've been seeding this since I posted the torrent. 

I'm using both clients, till this gets a firm hold. utorrent shows it to be seeding almost all of the time. TorrentB just shows it...

Let me know if there's anything else I should do."
