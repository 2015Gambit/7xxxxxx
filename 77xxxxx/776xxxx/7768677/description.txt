Hi All! This is still my first upload, but the second attempt. I hope everything works well this time. Please let me know if I've done something drastically stupid. On my first try, I was told that it wasn't seeding. I couldn't find any specific problem with my first torrent upload, but I've changed my bittorrent client & hope this will correct things.

I've been a fan of TPB for a long time & finally found something worthwhile to give back (besides seeding). 

I've purchased this movie several times & always made the mistake of loaning it out & never seeing it again. NO MORE! After my most recent loss, I tried to find it here or anywhere for download. No luck at all...

Hopefully, my loss(') will be your gain.

Also known as Global Heresy, this movie was released in 2002. 

It's a heartwarming movie with Joan Plowright and Peter O'Tool (The Lord and 
Lady Foxley) playing very well off of each other, as they attempt to cover their 
identities to earn money for their home, Foxley Hall. An American rock band in 
hiding, Global Heresy, rents Foxley Hall to work on some new music with a new 
bass player (Alicia Silverstone). That's when the shenanigans really get 
started!

Though everyone I've shared this movie with has loved it, I believe it was a 
victim of poor to no marketing. It just never gained the popularity I think it 
deserves.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
