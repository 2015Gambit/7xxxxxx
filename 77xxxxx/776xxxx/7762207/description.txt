NOTES: Since no one has released a DVD9 of this movie, we did. This
time the source is from the scene. We used CCE also on this release
@ 7 passes (6 passes = 7 passes in CCE for those who are wondering).
In any case, we hope that you are happy with our hard work. We took
the time to make an suitable menu in DVD Architect Pro 5.0. The
subtitle was made by BkX and the custom dvd-cover was made by BARFLY.
Big thanks to you two!

(The dvd-cover was NOT made specifically for this release).


PLOT: Typical teenager Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) embraces his
incredible destiny after uncovering one of his father's most
carefully guarded secrets as Columbia Pictures reboots the Spider-Man
franchise with the help of director Mark Webb ((500) Days of Summer)
and screenwriter James Vanderbilt (Zodiac). Sally Field, Rhys Ifans,
Denis Leary, Martin Sheen, and Emma Stone co-star.
