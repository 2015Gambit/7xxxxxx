lol looks pretty crap but thanks for the up :)"
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-10-29T22:23Z,Even I and my girlfriend could make a better sex-comedy.
,jagwiz69,2012-10-29T23:07Z,"2.4/10 on IMDB......plus the fact there is a character named Dr. Dick Asskis in this movie leads me to believe it was written/produced/directed by 5th graders trapped in adult bodies. So, if you enjoy losing braincells without doing drugs, please download this."
,jpmcnown,2012-10-30T04:50Z,"I agree jagwiz. There exists in our culture, a defined and politically correct, degree of intellectual separation where other people are considered humorous. It's seldom that people find others with considerably higher or lower intelligence to be amusing. I estimate this degree of separation to be approximately 40 i.q. points. I.E. if you think retards are funny, it's likely because you are one, and that's perfectly ok."
,captargh,2012-10-30T05:09Z,Holly shit this looks like it could be the worst movie ever. I'm gonna have to D/L it just to see this train wreck.
,neptown,2012-10-30T12:28Z,"Agreed. if its that bad, it's worth a look :)"
