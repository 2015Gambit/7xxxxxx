,hbright84,2012-10-28T14:06Z,4.21 cfw users....if loading game goes back to xmb here is a fix. Create a empty folder in usrdir and name it ASSASSIN_ISO. Works for me. Takes a few to load when starting.
,andy4058,2012-10-28T14:50Z,hbright84 thanks so much bro it works! YAY =D
,Gees,2012-10-28T18:51Z,"I'm on 3.55, that the problem, and it seems that every time i enter the game it creates gamedata that is only 1kb large."
,shejmus,2012-10-28T21:48Z,"I'm on 3.55.
hbright84's solution worked.
Thanks ;)"
,hbright84,2012-10-28T22:26Z,Yo Gees I had that happen too. Game kept making some little save file. I deleted all game data like that. Not sure about 3.55..prob need this eboot. I was on 4.21 and didn't modify any files at all just created the empty ASSASSIN_ISO folder in GAMEZ USRDIR folder. Had MM install game data to external to save some space which took awhile...but after it loads up game runs good...so far no probz.
