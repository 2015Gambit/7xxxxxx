Under the direction of Don Was, Travis Tritt turns in one of his leanest and easily his grittiest country record yet with Restless Kind. Cutting back the country-rock flourishes that have always distinguished his sound, Tritt opts for twangy guitars, wailing fiddles, Dobros, and unaffected guts vocals. Mirroring the stripped-down instrumentation, the song selection is straightahead honky tonk, rockabilly and traditional country. Tritt benefits immesurably from this approach -- he has never sounded so alive. Actually, he has never sounded so purely country. -- Thom Owens
