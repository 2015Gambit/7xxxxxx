Windows 8 Activator.

Just Run Activator as Admin, press "y" when prompted, wait for activation to complete, and allow computer to restart. 

Have tested myself on RTM version, Fully activates but still doesn't allow customization. There is an application included that will allow for customization. Not sure if activation will work on MSDN version. Please feel free to experiment.
