Overview

In the return series of Gourmet Farmer, weΓÇÖre in for a surprise. Once a single man trying his hand at farming and experimenting with making artisanal produce, MatthewΓÇÖs now a fully fledged family man with partner, Sadie, and son, Hedley. Time to get serious about bringing home the bacon.

Matthew sets about upscaling his farm, which goes from being home for 2 pigs to 22 and coming up with ways of preserving and selling the extra pork produce from more than just his market stall. An invitation to Slow FoodΓÇÖs Salon in Turin affords him the opportunity to go to Italy and France and learn artisanal ways of preserving meat which might help even out his ΓÇÿdrought or glutΓÇÖ issues.

With his mates Nick and Ross, a new business idea is born ΓÇô A Common Ground. The aim is to go to remote locations around Tasmania, set up a long table, and cook multiple course menus from produce sourced solely from the area. Will locals and mainlanders travel the miles and pay the price for a genuine locavore experience?

But itΓÇÖs not all hard work. Matthew continues his boyΓÇÖs own adventures with a Kayak trip down the Picton River with his mates Nick and Ross.
