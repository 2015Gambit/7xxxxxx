Most of us save these but the 720p version is not needed because 1,69GB is 2 large for a TUF episode"
,KShelbrock2,2012-10-27T06:52Z,Ya'll need to step your game up if your worrying about file size for space saving purposes. Get a NAS set up for a computer that hooks to your tv and stack that bitch with 6TB's lol

,Hoirc88,2012-10-27T08:15Z,This one wasn't budging download wise and the 480p one has no sound -.-
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-27T08:47Z,"For this who are downloading the 480p, my apologies, I uploaded the wrong file.

That's the audio file for the 480p video. Keep them in the same folder and name them the exact same thing and it should play. You can also load it with your player in its audio section within the options. 

I will upload a REPACK of the 480p once this is deleted."
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-27T09:24Z,"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7764373

This link is the fixed version of the 480p with the audio. My apologies, guys."
