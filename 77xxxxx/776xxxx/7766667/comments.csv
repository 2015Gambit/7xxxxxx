,dredre999,2012-10-28T16:55Z,I don't know but I can let you know in 5 days....Dude if your going to upload something at least fucking seed it.
,dredre999,2012-10-28T16:55Z,Make that 10 weeks.
,dredre999,2012-10-28T17:13Z,Btw the info hash is all over the net for the last 17 hours but not one seeder besides here....Doubtful outlook
,MistryWho,2012-10-28T17:14Z,"@dredre999 Its hard to seed to 36 people. I tried uploading stuff before and sometimes it would just be real slow, even though I can seed other torrents just fine. might not be his fault if the people he does seed to dont give back either"
,dredre999,2012-10-28T17:47Z,"@Mistrywho

 I was the first to go for it there were no seeders...got stuck at 2%. He uploaded then left"
,dredre999,2012-10-28T18:04Z,He seems to have come back and is seeding again. Was stuck for 6 hours at .2%
,dredre999,2012-10-28T18:28Z,Key doesn't work as well. Go figure. No virus though
