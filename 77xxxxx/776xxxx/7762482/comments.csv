,dragan_id,2012-11-12T20:40Z,"Thanks mate! I installed it on my virtual machine, and everything works nice!"
,dragan_id,2012-11-13T23:18Z,"Just to be sure, is AVAST XP registry entry for XP only, 'cause i applied it both in win7 and win8 and it works, neverheless? Thanks in advance."
,rigko,2012-11-15T22:34Z," is for win xp,win7 and win8 for all!!"
,BrunoHerz,2012-11-20T14:42Z,"Everyone note that with this crack you do not get the annoying warning illegal (pirate) pop-up. Also you can select auto update for both program as well as virus definitions. Put the exclusion path for ""Version.dll"" into Settings Exclusions (to prevent the Boot scan from picking it up). Also put this same exclusion into:Real Time Shields-File System Shield-Expert Settings-Exclusions. Note all these exclusions and settings will survive the automatic program updating too!!! Permanent 2050 use and auto program updating are what you get with this crack!!! Not bad!"
