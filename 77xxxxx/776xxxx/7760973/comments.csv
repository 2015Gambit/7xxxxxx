,BUTT_SEX,2012-10-26T05:23Z,Can you upload a version in XviD please?
,atticus0584,2012-10-26T06:51Z,open it in VLC or something and stop asking someone for extra favors when they are already doing a HUGE favor...ITS FREE AND right after it aired!
,BUTT_SEX,2012-10-26T07:44Z,"@Atticus: Shut your fucking hole before I fill it with rabbit pellets and cave it in! It was a fucking request, obviously you must be on your period and way too sensitive. I usually just convert it with Pazera so I can watch it on a PS3 or wirelessly to a HD TV. I don't like having to hook the fucking computer up directly to the god damn tv! Or watching on a smaller computer screen. 

I'm also not just asking for my own benefit, like I said I can convert the file myself, but I'm asking for the community as a whole. So people who might not have the technological know-how can enjoy the episode as well on their TV! "
,BUTT_SEX,2012-10-26T07:45Z,"Regardless, here is the Xvid release that will play in most dvd players, ps3's etc or xbox360. If you're too stupid to find it yourself or convert here is the link, lol jk. But seriously, here is the link!
