,CCALLUMM,2012-11-01T19:10Z,"if YOu yourself read the description, you'd see ""GreenLuma is a cracked Steam client"". Doesnt say anywhere you NEED steam my friend"
,CCALLUMM,2012-11-01T19:12Z,"you dont need steam. i dont have it and clearly it works. No where does it say you need it. also if you read it you'd have seen ""GreenLuma is a cracked Steam client"".

,tpb_4_ever,2012-11-03T15:43Z,"Well i expect some decent words to be spoken on here :)

And just to make it clear for everyone, the game doesnt require Steam to be installed.
You just play with the given Green Luma software.

And to those who are asking for iso files better learn how to install a game ratheer then discouraging others.. Instructions are clear and easy."
,futurehillbillies,2012-11-03T23:31Z,Ok I used the 7z to unzip the first folder. I ran the greenluma.exe file and then it tells me it can't find the greenluma.dll file that its sitting right next to it. Any other ideas I can try? Thanks for your help and thanks for the torrent.

I'm usually able to handle my own when it comes to installing torrents but this one really threw me off simply because it's not stated in the install instructions that 7z is required.

Regardless, Thanks for the upload!!"

,neko_ceko,2012-11-08T19:18Z,"well, that's fixed but I got another problem:

The game works (sort of), but there is tons of missing textures. Sky textures, ground textures, signal lights, probably a few more.. Sky is always pitch black for me (both for day and nights) and the ground is always white."
