[V],extremezone,2012-10-27T21:33Z,"5. Block the game in your firewall and mark our cracked content as
secure/trusted in your antivirus program

make sure your av doesn't remove exe file"
,Quink666,2012-10-27T22:08Z,STill doesnt start with the exe blocked!
,Quink666,2012-10-27T22:09Z,Anyone know how to fix it? or do we have to wait for another release?

,Quink666,2012-10-28T00:59Z,And Blaze btw blocking the exe in the firewall has nothing with the game not starting you fucking retard.
,Quink666,2012-10-28T01:03Z,Wow this blaze is a pedophil! Blocking the exe has nothing with the game starting.
,Cerebral222,2012-10-28T03:08Z,"Works perfectly!! had to bitch slap my AV, but it kicked over first time. Xbox360 controls support is good, game itself is pretty good too. Thanks EZ, another good torrent from you, all the best from Australia :) Cheers, +1."

A ton of people get the exact same thing. Loading symbol in the corner and then kaboom, ctd."
[V],blaze69,2012-10-28T07:09Z,"@ Quink666

You tend to come here and call me names , rather than ask for help jeeez. But I'm Still gonna try to help You here.

1/ Turn Of Ur Antivirus
2/ Install The Game
3/ Copy all Cracked Contents From The SKIDROW Folder

buddha.dll
CloakNTEngine.dll
SKIDROW.ini
steam_api.dll
Steamclient.dll

And Copy Them Over to the game's Installation Path, Replacing/Ovewriting The Original Files.

4/ Add Both dh_2013.exe and buddha.dll To Your antivirus Exclusion/Trusted List.
5/ Add dh_2013.exe To Your Firewall Blocklist.
6/ Turn On your Antivirus As Normal and Start The Game.


Your Game Is Probally Not Starting Because Your antivirus Is Probally Flagging buddha.dll as a Virus. Yes We Had This Problem In The Past.

So Hope This Works For You... Have Fun And Die Quietly."

,BuddDwyer,2012-10-28T07:47Z,Can I run around and like free hunt in this game?
,Questoran,2012-10-28T08:01Z,"Don't bother downloading, it does not work. No crack fix or any solutions anywhere. "
,tsivour,2012-10-28T09:02Z,"The game not only launches correctly but it also works fast and it ROCKS!!! The crack (dll's replacement) is fine, no need of waiting for another crack version and bullshit. For all of you that the game crashes.... Go buy a new computer or reformat your machine. The game works PERFECTLY if your system is right configured. DirectX, MS VIsual 2010 Red, DotNet Framewark 4 latest update. If you really cant configure these things before the game then you may start thinking of quiting trying messing up with computers. AAAAwsome work SKIDROW, keep up the good work!!!!!!! "
,tsivour,2012-10-28T09:07Z,"And by the way stop accusing SKIDROW team, first of all RESPECT that you cant do anything better than these people, otherwise their cracks ALWAYS work if your machine of course is hardware and software configured/updated correctly. SKIDROW, FAIRLIGHT, RAZOR ftw!!!!!!!"
,marko8,2012-10-28T11:36Z,"@tsivour
you buy a new computer,fucking tard...
GAME CRASHES @ START,need solution not your opinion...douchbag! "
,Ticket.Pirate,2012-10-28T11:45Z,"Discuss it will not do anything, I use these craks ha over 5 years. And I'm having problems too, the fact of not being able to say that I'm not noob, I know, be cracker today is easy, because we have several new tools.
Knowledge needs to be disclosed, and not saved for later say that you are the best and they succeeded. Here closes the game but I'll be calm and patience that soon he'll open with that crack or another because I want to play."
,JK425,2012-10-28T12:38Z,This game SUCKS FUCKING BALLS please save youself the the bandwidth and get hunting expeditions it was just uploaded
,Ticket.Pirate,2012-10-28T12:54Z,"5 hours trying and nothing, I will not install, good luck to all."
,plsad,2012-10-28T13:12Z,"Did everything but the game still doesn't start. When i double click on it to start it pops up a black window with a rotating symbol on the upper left corner and after a second everything disappears. 

So... same problem with some other guys here. It's not my first time in applying a crack or anything. Somethings is wrong with the crack. To some or many computers it might be running perfectly but in some others there is a problem. "
,GreaterHarpy,2012-10-28T13:45Z,"Yeah, same issue here as plsad. I have the .exe blocked in my firewall, everything excluded in my AV, cracked applied but it still does not work. Not the first time I've hit this issue, I've recently had it with the SKIDROW Hitman Sniper Challenge torrent. I've enjoyed great torrents from Extremezone and SKIDROW before just seems to be these Steam linked cracks are giving me issues. "
[V],blaze69,2012-10-28T13:56Z,Try Installing Steam. No Need to Create a Steam account

,ShoeLase101,2012-10-28T14:31Z,"Hey, anyone managed to find a solution to the above mentioned problem?

(No, not people being idiots - There is no cure for that I am afraid) ;D"
,GreaterHarpy,2012-10-28T14:38Z,"Thanks for the heads-up, Blaze, but I've got STEAM installed as well but it still does not work. "
,Ticket.Pirate,2012-10-28T14:49Z,"Blaze69, know your job, and you are responsible for an upload of the game Left 4 Dead 2 which is at version 2027, a job pig, dirty, which makes people information without downloading the game in a version completely outdated and full of bugs, Left 4 dead 2 version is in 2114, and in 2027 his version is causing confusion and making people waste their time downloading a version 4 years ago. I have STEAM installed but still does not open the game, a brief loading screen and then closes."
,Cerebral222,2012-10-28T15:15Z,"Ok, just a thought on all of these problems with crashing; go into your ""Saved Games"" folder, then go into the ""Dangerous Hunts 2013"" folder & double click the config file, then choose wordPad to open the file. I'm thinking that your res may be too high, or low; change it to suit your screen type, ie: Standard 4:3, or Widescreen 16:9 etc, might work, cheers."
,carlosespada12,2012-10-28T15:35Z,there is no config file in Dangerous Hunts 2013 folder!!!
,phisher34,2012-10-28T15:50Z,"Having similar issues. Not new to cracks or blocking files.

I followed these steps:
1. Installed game (get errors if I try to install Direct X and C++ but those are already updated)

2. Copy cracked content over. All files transfer and overwrite successfully. 

3. Add the application .exe to the blocked firewall and and add the .exe and budda.dll to exceptions in anti-virus. Turn off anti-virus just to be safe.

4. When I first launch after install I get the spinning wheel in top left then CTD. Each time after that it is just a black screen for a couple seconds then CTD. 

I have steam installed. I have also just turned off the internet. Tried running both as administrator and without. Same issue every time. The saved game folder exists but there are no files inside of it."
,Quink666,2012-10-28T17:40Z,Yeah Blaze sry got a bad mood! done all that still not working thoo.
,INovas,2012-10-28T18:08Z,"I read it on the site where this was first uploaded. The problem is with 64-bit systems. The game only works fine on 32-bit windows computers. The majority of 64-bit users get a kick back to the desktop. Just hope for a fix soon. Yes, there will need to be a fix for this, no anything these people above have said will fix the problem, it's related to the crack itself."
,GoodGravy,2012-10-28T19:21Z,"@INovas, I run Win7 32bit, & the game runs well, I also have Win7 64bit on a spare drive, & and after reading your comment, I installed the game on the 64bit drive, I started the game & expected a CTD, but game started without a hitch, so I can confirm that it will install & play on 64bit OS."
,plsad,2012-10-28T19:25Z,Nope. The problem isn't only in 64 bit windows. I own 32bit windows and can't start the game.
,danylobn,2012-10-28T20:06Z,Crashing here at the start as well...=/ OS Win 7 Ultimate 64 bit

Marco8 feeling jelly??? And all of you guys who have problems, go study some computers.... then configure some.... Going offline again, I think I will play later. Cyaaaa!!!"
,guestroy,2012-10-30T02:07Z,"I followed the instructions, applied the fix, and everything's working fine. The game is not what I expected, though. It's more of a trigger happy FPS than an actual hunting game. I was hoping for stealth and smart chases, and instead I got immature bang bang Call of Duty style. Some might like it..."
,Questoran,2012-10-30T03:14Z,"I said it once due to a crack not working and will say it again due to this game being a poor ass port of a poor ass game.
This has NOTHING do to with with hunting other than you have animals with claws instead of monsters with claws. This is a bad rail shooter and when I say bad - I mean it! There is literally nothing satisfying about playing this game. I would point of the bad things but to make it quicker and rather more accurate i will only say that THE WHOLE FUCKING GAME IS BAD. And the fucking AI is that is supposed to be so great is limited to scripted sequences of couguars jumping from a tree to a tree.  
If I would have bought it, I would hit myself with a fucking bat, once for every penny spent. 

DO NOT DOWNLOAD."
,no1453,2012-10-30T07:18Z,"I've had the same issue with the last 5 Skidrow releases I've tried on Win8 x64.  I know what I'm doing, but every one simply runs for a few seconds and then exits with no message,  (Tried all sorts of compatibility modes, and tried the fix for this one.  No luck.)
Not knocking a great and prolific group like Skidrow, but somthing about their development environment is not friendly to Win8 x64.  Havn't had the same problems with releases from other groups, they've worked fine on my system."
