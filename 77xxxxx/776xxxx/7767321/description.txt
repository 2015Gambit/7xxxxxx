Match of the Day 27.10.2012

Gary Lineker introduces highlights of six Premier League games, including the London derby between Arsenal and QPR. Arsene Wenger is desperate for his relatively new-look Arsenal team to show that they can mount a real challenge for the Premier League title, having not won a trophy since 2005. They will also be keen to exact revenge on Mark Hughes's struggling side, who caused a minor shock when they beat them 2-1 at Loftus Road back in March.

Elsewhere, Swansea travel to Manchester City for a meeting between two of the most watchable top-flight sides at the Etihad Stadium. Both teams have managers from foreign climes, with champions City led by Italy's Roberto Mancini and the equally urbane Michael Laudrup, from Denmark, in charge of the Welsh club.
