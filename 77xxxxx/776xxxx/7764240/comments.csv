[V],psspss,2012-10-27T08:43Z,"trackers seemed to be fooked.. connect to me
via the freedom tracker.. should be in the list

but i know tpb and other engines now remove trackers and replace with their own ones"
[V],psspss,2012-10-27T08:44Z,"mp4 one is already up but its not cropped

,Luke1382,2012-10-27T08:46Z,Wiki says: Special 1:The Long Road Special 2: Do or Die and E01: Million Dollar Season
,Luke1382,2012-10-27T08:48Z,This is called do or die isnt it?
,Luke1382,2012-10-27T08:51Z,Cant find the Mp4's?
[V],psspss,2012-10-27T08:58Z,"not sure.. I using the name unpopular used
but i suspect its do or die is the title not off-season

but it could yet be another spiecial called do or die..
too confusing

its very good special this one better then sp01"
[V],psspss,2012-10-27T08:59Z,"the mp4 is not cropped but its a little screen
in middle.. your better with my mod of it

the quality wont be any better if its mp4 anyhow
its a tvrip

convert it to mp4 when you get it

I only do xvids"

,xoshix,2012-10-27T11:36Z,"seems like its do or die special, but what about million dollar first episode which was supposed to be out right after the this special on the 26 oct?"
,kambui,2012-10-27T11:54Z,did you get the 90 min special that aired before Season3 E1  last night DO or Die   please upload thanks for all your great work 
[V],psspss,2012-10-27T12:14Z,"no source for do or die special and ep1 as yet
no doubt it will show up in the next 24 hours

cappers always been slow with this series over the years havent they

this speicial aired a day before the Ep1 so I dont believe its do or die but yet another one thats not listed on site (since date is downunder time not usa time zone)

this aired on 25th in USA"
,adamdow2,2012-10-27T12:36Z,"thanks psspss

i'm also from australia (syd) and you're a godsend for us aussies, i don't think the off-season special is do or die as wikipedia and other tv sites state that both do or die and 3x01 aired on 26th however the off-season special the was aired on 25th and clearly stated '1 day to go' to the new season"

[T],MrUnpopular,2012-10-27T14:13Z,"Everyone - I'm working on uploading do or die now (editing). We sadly missed Gold Rush S03E01 and Jungle Gold S01E01 when capping last night but they're on later today so if nobody uploads them before then, we'll cap and upload. Sorry for the wait, expect faster speed next week."
