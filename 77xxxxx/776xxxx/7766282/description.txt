Tom Cohen, who is tasked with basically retelling the story of Peter Parker before he becomes Spider-Man, is given limited pages to actually fit in an original story. Cohen creates a problem the film Peter Parker must handle thus showing Peter's thought process, how he deals with difficult situations and what kind of a person he was pre-Spider-man. The story is basically meant to show readers the quality of Peter's character before he was Spider-Man. We meet Peter's influences (Aunt May and Uncle Ben) and we also are introduced to the various high school characters such as the bully, Flash Thompson, and Peter's crush/love interest Gwen Stacy. Each character is given a few panels to display who they are as individuals and how Peter feels about them. Pete's life is all spelled out for you in a bunch of narration squares and bubbled conversations.
