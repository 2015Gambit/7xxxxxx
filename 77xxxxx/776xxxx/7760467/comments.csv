,obvious2me,2012-10-26T13:28Z,"A/V? For a YIFY upload? You really don't need one.

His/her/their uploads are always amazing. The quality crammed into such a small file for HD 1080p/720p is incredible.

Granted the 6-20gb Brips are slightly better, but the differences are negligible when considering the ridiculous amount of time and money I save downloading YIFY."
,tomasSC,2012-10-26T14:18Z,I agree that YIFY rips are always great... but I wish they would start doing 5.1 audio
,zeroheritage,2012-10-26T17:15Z,"@tomasSC

Me too.  Unfortunately, 2-channel audio doesn't work well for action movies at all.  The speaking is muted compared to the action scenes.  "
,mike953100,2012-10-26T19:59Z,"No nfo was provided from YIFY per usual, and there is pretty bad audio per usual as well, but not as bad of audio as in The Amazing Spiderman 720p by YIFY.  Here is some nfo as provided to me by Mediainfo.  You will notice that the video is fine, but the audio is only 4% of the total size, and the video is 95%.  I certainly think a couple hundred megabytes more of audio would make this upload considerably better, potentially changing the bitrate from 92kbps to 320kbps or 384kbps and changing it from 2-channel to 6-channel without adding that much in the way of size.  I donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t think people would complain with this upload being 2.2 or 2.3gb vs 2gb with the slight size increase coming with a substantial improvement in audio.

,mynameismickael,2012-10-29T06:53Z,"I'm just here to warn every potential downloader, this movie is SHIT.

Tobey Maguire Spiderman movies are at least 100 times better. Download these instead. 

If I had to give this bag of rotten trash a mark like you guys do, I'd say 1/10 in all honesty.

Quality is great as always though, i don't even need to say that since YIFY is the uploader and YIFY's uploads are always great."
,clintonleatherwood,2012-10-29T15:30Z,Can anybody tell me how to keep the sound from muting (20 minutes in) when watching on PS3? I'm seeing this on newer movies alot. Any remedy?

,Bl33d4M3,2012-10-30T17:59Z,"For cinavia playback on PS3, use ""PS3 Media Server"" and store the files on your pc. If you have a wireless network you can stream a cinavia file to your PS3, and it encodes it for normal playback while you watch. Done it multiples times and works like a charm. Hope that helps!"

,oTipz,2012-11-01T02:12Z,"It's pretty easy to get around Cinivia on PS3
1) When it mutes do not panic :)
2) Go to >Settings >Time settings (or whatever)
3) Change the year by 15+ years
4) Repeat after it mutes again 20 minutes later...usually 2-4 times"

I too would like a 5.1 audio for slightly larger file size."
,Grondaivor,2012-11-02T06:56Z,"@djbuddha

It is out on Bluray... Stores have them 2 weeks before they are put on shelfs and its the copies people get before they are on shelfs that make Bluray rips. This movie is released on the 9th, like it? Buy it."
,obvious2me,2012-11-02T07:07Z,"djbuddha, someone acquires a BrRip weeks before they are released into stores, and then all the uploaders get their hands on it and compress it in all the various ways. The dvdrip is usually acquired a few days to a few weeks prior to the BrRip.

It has been quite a while, but if I recall correctly:

Avengers - BrRip 2 weeks in advance.
Hunger Games - 5 weeks.
Amazing Spiderman - 2 weeks.
Expendables 2 - 6 weeks.
Prometheus - 2 weeks.

Anyway like I said before, great upload. I'm not really sure what the audio comments were about, I was playing it through 5.1 and it sounded great."

,lif3isfr33,2012-11-06T09:48Z,All you nut zombies parasite hypnotized brainless folks must be yify worshiping idiots wtf man.. no regard whatsoever about his audio.. taking to note there all in stereo. Yify followers must be people who watch his uploads on their laptops or pcs with 2.0 speakers.. for US that use 5.1 digital surround sound THIS IS DISAPPOINT. and the fact that yifys uploads are like a virus.. there taking over much better quality videos that have 5.1 audio.. its a damn shame and pisses me off.
,hobie1k,2012-11-06T17:10Z,@clintonleatherwood if you are streaming via ps3 media server go into the settings and change the audio to 2 channels stereo and that should solve your problem. a lot of people will just go into settings of ps3 and change year every time it happens but the previous has worked for me consistently without having to do anything else over and over again

,GameMaster1229,2012-11-10T17:52Z," ^^^
2 methods to get this working on a PS3 without Cinivia or at least workaround:

 1: Use ""PS3 Media Server"" (PS3, Wi-Fi or Ethernet and PC needed)
and store the files on your pc. If you have a wireless network you can stream a cinavia file to your PS3, and it encodes it for normal playback while you watch.

 2: Get around Cinivia on PS3 (Manual PS3 Needed Only)

1) When it mutes do not panic.
2) Go to >Settings >Time settings
3) Change the year by 15+ years
4) Repeat after it mutes again 20 minutes later (Depending on movie length = 2 Hours = 6 Times to do this quick 10 second method."

WARNING:  THE TOTAL RECALL MOVIE AND THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN MOVIE ARE INFECTED WITH CINIVIA AND WILL NOT PLAY ON PS3 OR ANY BLURAY PLAYERS THAT HAVE CINIVIA IN THEIR FIRMWARE IF THE AUDIO IS CONVERTED TO AC3 OR AAC FORMAT FROM DTS. 

IF YOU HAVE TO CONVERT THE AUDIO FROM DTS TO AC3 AND VIDEO FROM MKV TO MP4 TO PLAY ON PS3 IT SUCKS BECAUSE THE PS3 WON'T PLAY IT. :( 

HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE A BLURAY PLAYER THAT IS CINIVIA FREE LIKE I DO THEN THIS MKV VIDEO WILL PLAY FINE. "

And for everyone having trouble with BluRay players and PS3s, why don't you just plug your computer into your tv with an HDMI cable? I'm pretty sure most computers have HDMI ports now and they keep the quality amazing. You can see for yourself just playing Xbox 360 games with it"
