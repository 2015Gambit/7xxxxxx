,nic198419,2012-10-27T05:28Z,Thanks alot......Just wondering why it takes so long though? Every other season it was uploaded the very next morning
,netrek,2012-10-27T06:33Z,nic198419 the show aired less than 4 hours ago so that is pretty fast turnaround time
,nathanthekiwi,2012-10-27T06:48Z,Can you upload after hours? Churrrrrr
,l3endik,2012-10-27T12:02Z,Thank you.
,SuperHell,2012-10-27T14:40Z,"Thanks! I liked this episode and wanted to see it again.

netrek, actually nic198419 is right. I saw the show when it aired three days ago. Not 4 hours from your time stamp."
