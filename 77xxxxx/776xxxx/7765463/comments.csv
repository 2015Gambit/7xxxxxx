Please give us the file's end."

I'm working all day and I'm sharing it at LATE afternoon.
Also, I have slow internet connection: about 20kB/s.
But don't worry I will seed it till I see ratio 10:1!
So please be patient and be sure I will not stop sharing it!
I invested lot of effort and time in it!"
