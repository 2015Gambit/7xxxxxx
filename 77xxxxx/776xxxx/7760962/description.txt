On The Buses [1971]
Code: 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067528/
Stan gets a little annoyed when his Mum and Sister keep
buying expensive items on hire purchase, but the money
he earns for overtime working as a bus driver means that
he can afford it... just! His job is secure, as bus drivers
are hard to come by, and his overtime prospects are good,
until the bus company decide to revoke a long standing rule
and employ women bus drivers. Aghast at the thought of no
overtime and, therefore, less wages, he joins forces with
his long time work colleague Jack to sabotage the new
Female employees.

Code: 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068981/
Bus driver Stan Butler agrees to marry Suzy, much to the
anguish of Mum, her son-in-law, Arthur, and daughter Olive.
How, they wonder, will they ever manage without Stan's money
coming in? Then Arthur is sacked, and Stan agrees to delay
the wedding. Meanwhile, he hits on an idea: Arthur should
learn to drive a bus. Somehow he does just that, and even
gets a job. Stan then blackmails the Depot Manager into
giving him the job of driver on the new money-making Special
Tours Bus. A great idea ...if only the inspector hadn't taken
Stan on his trial run to the Windsor Safari Park.

Sacked by the bus company Stan and Jack get jobs as drivers
ferrying punters to and from a holiday camp and arrange for

accidental compromising situations with the camp's nurse.
The Butlers head for one disaster after another as Jack and
Stan,still chasing women half their age,take two girls for
a bus trip on the sands only for the bus to sink in as the
tide approaches. Olive gets into bed with someone else's
husband when she makes it back to the wrong chalet in the
dark and 'little' Arthur sprays the chalet with ink,requiring
a re-painting job. The holiday over Arthur's sidecar
