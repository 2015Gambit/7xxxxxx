archive.org made the entire run of OMNI Magazine (American variant) available: https://archive.org/details/omni-magazine

They haven't made any torrents available, and their archive is a little hard
to read because you have to pick through the whole run of the magazine in
reverse chronological order.  So, I downloaded all of the PDFs and packed them
into a single torrent.  I haven't changed anything, I'm just making the
magazine a little easier for everyone to get hold of.  If you like this
torrent, donate some money or data to archive.org, care of Anonymous.

File format: PDF.  The pages look tiny when you first open the files but you

	     the images are fairly low-resolution, though.
