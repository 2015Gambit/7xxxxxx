[b]LAN Speed Test v3.1.0 Incl Key ~HuNtEr~[/b]

LAN Speed Test was designed from the ground up to be a simple but
powerful tool for measuring file transfer, hard drive, USB Drive
and Local Area Network (LAN) speeds (wired & wireless)
It does this by building a file in memory, then transfers it both
ways (without effects of windows file caching) while keeping track
of the time, and then does the calculations for you. Simple concept
and easy to use. You'll find that LAN Speed Test will quickly become
one of your favorite network tools!
