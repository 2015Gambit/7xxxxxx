As always for more details, You can check the changelogs bellow. Also, I recommended to find your save files and back them up often because lost saves issues haven’t been fixed yet, for neither PC nor consoles. Be careful and have fun."

Borderlands 2 Update 6 info:

Borderlands 2 Update 1.1.3

- Added a toggle for whether textures should fade or pop in when a higher-resolution version loads. High-end computers can disable this to avoid seeing lower-resolution textures streaming in.
- Added the ability to reset all challenge progress for a character once they've completed 85% of all non-DLC, non-area-specific challenge levels. This will keep the player's current challenge bonuses and rank, but reset all challenge progress to 0 and allow challenges to be re-completed for additional ranks and bonuses. Resetting is available on the ""challenges"" screen of the status menu and will display as a tooltip at the bottom of the screen if the player has met the criteria.
- Fixed a bug where profile files set to ""read only"" were not being saved.
- Fixed a performance issue in Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty content with PhysX set to Medium or High.

If you are gullible and think there is a virus i have attached the source code so you can compile it yourself ( dumbass )"

,mistercow,2012-10-28T04:54Z,"Running windows 7

What ever you did for the 'crack only' torrent 9-18 16:00 worked for me.

This one does not. 

I'm worried I'll have to re-install the game.

The problem is that when I click the Borderlands 2 .exe I get nothing - nothing at all. 

But the last time it worked from you - so I hope you can do it again :)"
,Sagara_Shinji,2012-10-30T07:04Z,"Well, I downloaded it with no problems, nice seeding. But as I have Windows 8, I think there is a kind of compatibility with it, so I think I need to download the GngnmStyl's fix patch."
