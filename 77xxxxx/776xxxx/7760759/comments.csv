,SteinGalen,2012-11-09T19:32Z,"I replaced the original patch (after I run it) with the mediafire patch, and the activation worked. 

When I installed Camtasia on my other pc, I didn`t run the original, but replaced it with the mediafire right away. On that pc, the activation window still comes up. Is that the reason it doesn`t work, or can it be something else?"
