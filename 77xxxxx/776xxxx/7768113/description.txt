In 1922 Australia. When a Native Australian man is accused of murdering a white woman, three white men (The Fanatic, The Follower and The Veteran) are given the mission of capturing him with the help of an experienced Native Australian (The Tracker). As they track their quarry, good and bad, right or wrong becomes less clear. Who are the real savages?
