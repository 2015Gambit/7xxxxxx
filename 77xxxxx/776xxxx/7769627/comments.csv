The show starts then cuts off in the first 2 seconds.

Same problem last week with this and Dexter.

Avoid."

,Minty_Winty,2012-10-29T16:19Z,"I had zero issues playing this episode back on my PS3.  No sync issue, no cutting out issue, picture was a little darker than I'm used too but that's it.

The file is fine, it's the playback device causing the problem."
,Minty_Winty,2012-10-29T16:21Z,"Never mind previous comment, I clicked on the wrong damn link.  It's the other ettv s03e03 file that worked fine for me."
,checabear,2012-10-30T00:26Z,"thank heavens you are still supplying avi files.
thank again ettv"
,danieloc,2012-10-30T06:40Z,"I believe the primary reason to use XVID is to be able to play it on devices that don't support x264. This file wasn't compatible with my device(2 seconds cut), but I solved it without re-encoding.

SOLUTION TO MAKE THIS FILE 100% PLAYER COMPATIBLE:

Open it with virtualdub
Menu Video-> Direct Stream Copy
Menu Audio-> Direct Stream Copy
Menu File->Save as AVI

This worked for me, I guess you could also use Avidemux or other tool with this functionality."
