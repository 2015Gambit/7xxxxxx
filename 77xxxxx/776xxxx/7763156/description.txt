BBC Timeshift 2012 The British Army of the Rhine PDTV x264 AAC MVGroup

The affectionate story of British servicemen and their families who had to make Germany a home from home in the decades after the Second World War. For nearly 70 years, generations would grow up on bases with special schools, shops, housing and even their own radio station, as parts of the Rhineland became little bubbles of Britishness.

Featuring a nostalgic soundtrack of German language versions of period pop hits and contributions from military historians such as Max Hastings and former BBC sports commentator Barry Davies - himself a former British Army of the Rhine soldier - as well as those of military wives and children.

Once the frontline in the Cold War, the BAOR is now being called home as the Ministry of Defence begins preparations to finally pull British forces out.
