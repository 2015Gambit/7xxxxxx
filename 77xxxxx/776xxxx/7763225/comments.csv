You need to have a PS3 with official firmware version 3.55 or below(OFW 3.55, OFW 3.44, etc.)

Then you need to install custom/modified firmware over it(CFW 3.55, CFW 4.21, CFW 4.25)

After that, you need to download the games and place the game folders onto your PS3 via USB or buy an external hard drive and store all the PS3 game folders on it and leave it hooked up to the console.

If on CFW 3.55, you need to copy/paste a patch into the game's folders. Any CFW above it does not require a patch.
