John (Scott Adkins) awakens from a coma to discover
his wife and daughter were slaughtered in a brutal
home invasion. Haunted by images of the attack, he
vows to kill the man responsible: Luc Deveraux
(Jean-Claude Van Damme). While John tries to piece
his reality back together, things get more
complicated when he is pursued by a relentless UniSol
named Magnus (Andrei Arlovski). Meanwhile, Deveraux
and surviving UniSol Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren)
are preparing to battle anarchy and build a new order
ruled by Unisols without government oversight.
They are weeding out the weak and constantly testing
their strongest warriors in brutal, life-and-death
combat. Luc has emerged operating the Unisol Church of
Eventualism, taking in wayward Unisols whom the
government has been secretly operating as
remote-controlled sleeper agents. His mission is to
liberate these Unisols from the implanted memories and
the lies the government has inserted in them. As John
gets closer to Deveraux and the rogue army of
genetically enhanced warriors, he discovers more about
himself and begins to call into question everything
he believed to be true...
