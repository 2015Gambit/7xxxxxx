Detroit FanFare 2010 edition is not available in comic shops and was first offered at the Detroit FanFare 2010 comic convention in Dearborn, Michigan, Halloween Weekend, 2010. This special edition features a variant cover by Tim Seeley that was not seen elsewhere. Angels and Demons, Slashers and Killers - discerning them can all get so confusing. What happens when Mercy and Hank need the relic of a slasher on Cassie and Vlad's hit list? Even worse, when the slasher wants it back.
