I have completed watching this torrent and quality is good, you cant expect dvdrip quality from cam or dvdscr. So go ahead and download this torrent

@khageshb stop criticizing other's work if you cant appreciate. Your torrent is 300mb size, this one is 700mb. Both are DVDSCR. Obviously your torrent is low in quality. Loser."
,khageshb,2012-11-05T15:52Z,@9557722 i can gurantee that my torrent is best.if it is not i will stop uploading torrents
