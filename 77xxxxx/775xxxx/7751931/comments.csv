,Joost1664,2012-10-24T11:21Z,Gaz do you have a Paypal? I'll send you a few notes for Christmas for all your effort this year.
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-10-24T12:01Z,"Mate, I truly appreciate that, but I like to do this to give back for all the stuff I have gotten from this site over the years. I know this sounds so clichĂŠ, but, my reward is when I hear how happy people are they can watch their favourite shows wherever on the planet they are! I am also so grateful for being healthy and for everything I have. A lot of people are not as fortunate. 
Again, I really appreciate the offer :)"
