Here is DJ Paul's A Person Of Interest DVD. I tried converting this movie with the Any DVD Converter software into mp4 format. But there is something wrong with the way the DVD menus were added to this film that causes it to glitch bad & mess with the audio/video sync. I played my original disc on my XBox & there is a problem. I tried rewinding a part. And it throws you to the beginning of the movie every time. So I used Any DVD HD/Slysoft software to make an image file of the DVD. In hopes of resolving the menu problem of the DVD & give y'all the best quality. I know it's gonna be a bitch to convert & so forth. But definitely worth the download. So download, enjoy, & seed. SEEEEEEED!!!!!!!!
