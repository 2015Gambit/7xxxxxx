I encode under ""AVIGUY"" and previously under ""MP4SUX"" and TPB shows as of now:

AVIGUY - 294
MP4SUX - 104

Sceneline - 0

So, your false accusations aside, I post and stand behind MY OWN encodes (except for CC2AVI, for which I give proper credit).

You've encoded NOTHING and appear to want glory for passing other people's encodes off as your own somehow.

So what exactly is YOUR problem with my commenting on the quality of encodes that aren't even yours?

You obviously have the inside track on distribution and as far as that goes, you are right up there with the best of them.

I have no beef with you whatsoever. But until LOL or DIMENSION come out from hiding, those who post their damaged goods are going to have to take the brunt of justified criticism (good OR bad).

Peace out,

AVIGUY"
