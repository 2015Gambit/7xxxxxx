[T],karmax264,2012-10-25T01:33Z,"@Retrenched

Did you even read the description.  It just investigates the climate change doubters.  Its not promoting the idea."
[T],stevekasian,2012-10-25T04:09Z,"@ karmax264: Of he didn't. 'Retrenched' clearly has a drinking problem; Koolaid dependency is, indeed, a disease."
,RTT2,2012-11-03T10:45Z,"Before criticizing Retrenched, have a think about the context, namely PBS' notorious last effort, which was the very definition of 'false balance'..."
,polarbearing,2012-11-10T19:04Z,"@RTT2 Yeah, I can't believe the crap PBS was trying to sell on the last notorious Antiques Roadshow! Damned communists!"
[T],karmax264,2012-11-11T06:49Z,"@RTT2
I have no idea what you mean with ""PBS' notorious last effort""

@polarbearing

ZING! haha"
,RTT2,2012-11-12T10:24Z,"Well, why not look it up, rather than LOL at jokes that make no sense? 

PBS were blatantly trying to make up for their earlier report, an uncritical 'he said/she said' balancing an actual scientist against, er...Antony Watts (i.e 'false balance'). For that reason alone there are still worries about the journalism. Sadly they're not the only journalists to fall prey to denialist fallacies and fantasies, of course.

Good for them that they've tried to make amends (and as you rightly say, it's not promoting the idea), but after being given such a gift previously, the expertly political denialists will inevitably portray it as weak, and a 'cover-up', and a lot of weak minds will believe it, sadly... "

The point was that although normally you might well trust the description (and indeed PBS itself), there were reasons for suspicion here. Cheers."
,RTT2,2012-11-12T13:16Z,"Sorry for another post, but I should say I wasn't criticizing you, karmax, in my first comment. I would have left it if it wasn't for the one after, which was the actual target, because I hate to see bandwagons being jumped, especially by 'sceptics'.

And I tried to explain what I meant in more detail in the 1st comment, but PB wouldn't let me post more than a couple of lines. Which may not be a bad thing...

Anyway, thanks for the upload/encode, I should have said that originally! Cheers"
