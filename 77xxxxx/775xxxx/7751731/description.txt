The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour debuted on September 11, 1976. The entire series was released on DVD as The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour: The Complete Series on Tuesday, March 7, 2006. However, the episodes contained therein are not the original 1976 broadcast versions, but the separate syndicated versions of The Scooby-Doo Show and Dynomutt, Dog Wonder.

These are all 16 episodes from the DVD release and are labeled according to the names of the individual Scooby Doo and Dynomutt segments. I also included the special features: "Eerie Mystery of Scooby-Doo and Dynomutt's History," and "In Their Own Words." As with all my torrents, I have included muxed English subtitles. Enjoy!
