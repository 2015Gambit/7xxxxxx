Thanks for uploading and seeding, guys!"
,ArwenK,2012-10-25T23:53Z,File wont play - either as MP4 or converted to avi - am guessing tis to do with the file size (244.84Mib) as an MP4 - very small

The file works perfectly, if you're having issues, either install DivX software to your Quicktime player or just use VLC which pretty much plays every video file that you could ask for."
