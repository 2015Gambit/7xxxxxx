I just doubled the values of all readiness given, which makes it 100% (still shows 50%, but since you are getting twice as many points, the end result equals 100%).
These settings are somewhere in BioUI.ini, if I remember right. And no need to use anyone's profiles."
,Fantomnz,2012-10-23T19:16Z,"@dahaka47 Hey Ur intitled to your very small minded limited opinion!!!! Which as far as the 100% dosnt matter your SSSssoooo WRONG, but hey you mustnt be able to read!!!!

Im sure that many others will appreciate it & can read about the 100%. Just getting higher points without playing Multi-Player does not give you the best endings!!!!!

Notice the ""Troll"" only mentioned the 100% not the weapons etc which its no doubt using!!!!"
,cartman6666,2012-10-23T19:43Z,so i can use this just for the 100% readiness cause i went thru the game at 100% except multiplayer so it would just be for fun 
,Fantomnz,2012-10-24T20:59Z,"@cartman6666 You can use any part of the pack & the 100% readiness is not changed. If you just want that you can get it from here....

It's not difficult to download a savegame editor and change one of your assets to give you +100500 points to unlock all endings, but with readiness at 50% you still get the hardest endgame possible.
So having real 100% readiness does make a difference."
,Fantomnz,2012-11-14T02:03Z,"I agree with LRN and Iv had the hard ending with 7400...I did apsolutly everything I could...Everything but at 50% & never got Shepard to breath...Infact didnt know & was totally disappointed that they would end the Games like that...Started to read forums etc & then found that if you handt played multiplayer (which we cant) you couldnt get 100%
The fix worked & it was my 3rd play threw. I was up to my 8th when Extended came out. Bring on OMEGA ::))))
