Gives 100% readiness, should Also give all achivements...Including "Veteran".
Gives Alternate Apperances.
Gives the "Firefight DLC" Weapons.
Gives ME3.exe that works with all game content.


Files are from a New Game +

Install Guides, Editors and lots of Info to help you use them. 
"GIYF" Google is your friend & you'll find lots of ways, 
       means & info on how to use Editors etc also!!!

My Pack also from a 100% Shep ME1 and then a ME2.(All Loyal & Survive)

The Genesis DLC can help,
but I would recommend just using the Editors to set your pereferance.
Such as Romance etc.
Who Dies which does make a diff in ME3!!!!

Enjoy!
