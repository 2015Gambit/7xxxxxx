High Stakes Vegas


Deep in the heart of the Nevada desert is Las Vegas--America's ultimate Sin City. 
Each year 40 million tourists come to this adult fantasyland to gamble and party. 
This oasis of hedonism fuels a massive demand for illegal drugs. 
This film reveals how the drug dealers, the gangs, and the Mexican cartel traffickers make their millions from the tourists who flock here. 
From the VIP party host to the notorious Playboy Bloods street gang who control the crack industry in West Las Vegas, 
to the Mexican cartel trafficker who uses three different identities to stay under the radar of the police, 
and the Vegas Strip dealer who reveals how much of a battleground the drugs market is--and how bloodshed is never far away.
