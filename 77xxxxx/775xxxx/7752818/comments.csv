,zulithe,2012-10-24T19:11Z,ridiculously small filesizes. has to be transcode from itunes/amazon/etc. can anyone upload a legit 320 or FLAC? no transcodes please... and if you don't know what that means you have no business uploading music torrents :)
,badarro,2012-10-25T02:18Z,"@Zulithe It was converted from .flv download from a streaming site. The only thing available with this soundtrack at the time.
If you prefer nothing, then don't download, because I'm sure other people were happy with this. "
