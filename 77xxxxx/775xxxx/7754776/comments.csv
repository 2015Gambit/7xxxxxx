,psylotic1,2012-10-25T13:30Z,"Confirmed. Works fine.

Intel i5

,psylotic1,2012-10-25T13:31Z,"Sure you're commenting on the correct torrent? Worked PERFECTLY for me. Simple.

Mounted with DAEMON TOOLS PRO."
,Crusader2010,2012-10-25T19:39Z,"I think the crack is bad. I always get an error at the Datazip.exe file when starting the game. Then i get stuck at the loading screen. Yesterday i could enter the game and play, but today i cannot as it also exits with an error... The only things changed were some display/interface settings, and the autosave it creates."
,TheNotoriousKIJ,2012-10-26T00:27Z,Yaaaaaaa 3mb/s
,TheNotoriousKIJ,2012-10-26T00:32Z,Wait now 6.5 mb/s :-D
,vahnnoa,2012-10-26T23:31Z,"After install still requires product registration before you can play, thereby rendering the torrent useless."

,snowstone,2012-10-30T02:42Z,@Ghost214 just go view youtube videos im sure there is one that shows how to use a torrent step by step
,Pandor27,2012-10-30T21:55Z,"@Ghost Next time i suggest you google it before to ask. Its kinda a topic that come often. But here is the same answer you will probably get everywhere.

First download and install Deamon tool. After mount the game image you just downloaded. 

Install the game. (Dont launch the game just yet)

After check on the mounted disk image usually there is a crack folder or maybe its a folder with the scene name (Skidrow, ect) Copy the file and paste it where you installed the game.

Now you make a shortcut of the exe file (Not the launcher) to the desktop and your game is usually ready to go."
,raspoutin667,2012-11-03T23:39Z,"The pc locks up (freezes) after clicking any option in the main menu and needs manually reset. It's something that never happens with any other game (with more requirements than FE).

Does anyone else have this issue, or should I start checking my hardware?

Also thanks for the upload!"
,unbuggie,2012-11-13T00:00Z,Anyone knows where to get patches for this?
,FriedCoD,2012-11-25T00:28Z,"can someone upload patch 1.01 , 1.02 ??
its lame, you have to sign in to their system with a registered account to get the patch... which obviously is incompatible with this... 
1.02 fixes some BADLY needed things...
please!!! ... thanks.."
