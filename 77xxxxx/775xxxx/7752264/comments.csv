,cossiemk1,2012-10-29T20:41Z,"@barnesy91, there is no verified rip for this version yet, only for the german version..."
,Earl96,2012-11-01T17:45Z,"So, you need jtag for the dlc. Do you need it for just the game?"
,mm7700,2012-11-03T21:00Z,"hey, i did everything as written but when i try to burn it to the dvd i choose the overburn option but at 97% it displyas an error... pls help me! im using maxell DVD+R DL 8.5 GB, and ImgBurn"

,akash2008,2012-11-08T22:14Z,why is this rated +4 when it doesn't pass stealth in abgx?
,hytporsche69,2012-11-09T06:44Z,"Okay, ""EVERYONE"" go and download... FORZA.HORIZON.GERMAN.XBOX360-NSU-RF-MULTI5 from - http://bt.xbox-sky.cc:88/index.php?keywords=Forza+Xbox360+-+German&sort=&NoSeed=0

This is the one verified with abgx360 (green across the board and good to go). Yes, you will have to register to the site.

BEST PART IS... I DOWNLOADED IT, BURNED IT, AND AM NOW PLAYING IT ON MY XBOX AND XBOX LIVE WITH ""ENGLISH"" language. ENJOY! :)"
,mm7700,2012-11-09T21:49Z,@hytporsche69 HOW DID YOU BURN IT? i tried  too overburn the dvd but at 97% it displays an error.... i've already busted 4 dual layer dvds in attempts to burn it
,hytporsche69,2012-11-10T07:54Z,"@mm7700 This link will explain all my friend. Just go down to the burn section. Link : http://sharethefiles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=192121

And.. when you get to actually burning the disc, click ""trunicate"" and not overburn. It will bring up a message saying that the game/file may be to big in size. Just hit ""ok"" to continue and BAM! You have a burned game :)

Btw, I have used 3 DVD+R DL memorax disc instead of verbatim and have burnt 3 flawless disc..."
,mm7700,2012-11-11T14:26Z,@hytporsche69 i did everything as said but when i try to start the game is displays an error saying that the game needs an update
,hytporsche69,2012-11-11T18:50Z,"@mm7700 - That is very wierd. The only problems i cant think of would be, A.. stop using maxwell DVD+R DL disc and use Verbatim. If you can't get a hold of Verbatim. Try memorax. B.. your dvd burner just may not have what it needs to do to burn the disc properly. For instance, I have an LG DVD burner and they are known to have problems burning games. But, I have been lucky to no have any problems."
,mm7700,2012-11-11T20:06Z,@hytporsche69 thanks... if this forza doesent work atleast i know how to burn these games.... ;)
,Noworking,2012-11-12T16:44Z,"THIS game isnt working. The verification process failed through ABGX. heres the message : ""There is no verified rip of XEX CRC 981EBE7A in the online database. Failed to find a verified ini file for this XEX"". SO there you go. CHris, Please prove me wrong. I'm hoping you do"
,Noworking,2012-11-12T16:49Z,"This game is not verified. I just ran it through ABGX and it still couldnt verify the CRC through ABGX. i dont know what Chris-Aksel is saying but i hope he proves me wrong. Also, ive been burning and patching games for years now. Chris please prove me wrong"
,ClipperCigars,2012-11-23T08:02Z,"There are no less than 4 versions of this game released in the world. Each one has it's own CRC. Regardless if a game is region free and can play on any console, every region still gets it's own pressing. 

It will be verified in ABGX360 when someone finally gets around to uploading a verified topology data set taken from a region version of the game that matches the one Complex got their hands on, and not before. Deal with it or download one of the other two versions that have been verified so far.

Better yet, just go BUY THE FUCKING GAME, then you won't have to worry about it. Problem solved. 

No one owes anyone anything, remember that next time you ignorant ungrateful entitlement dip-shits decide to bitch and piss and moan about FREE shit. This is exactly why piracy is supposed to be a ""privilege"" for those that know what the fuck they are doing (as it used to be for decades), and not an entitlement by everyone who is unable/unwilling to learn or make an effort."
