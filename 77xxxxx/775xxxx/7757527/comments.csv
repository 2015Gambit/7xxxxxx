,aperjan,2012-10-26T04:31Z,"@MohammadSarrar  when MISSION STARTS(meaning during the car chase) pause the game go to video check the windowed option and above it it should give u an option to apply the fullscreen or windowd click that then game will be windowed you should now play the game in a smalleer window instead of full screen finish the mission and walaaaa, after that just switch back to full screen"

Press Alt + Enter

No errors for car chase."
