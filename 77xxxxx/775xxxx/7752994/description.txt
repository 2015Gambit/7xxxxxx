Ranch owner Cane Kirk lost more than his arm in the war. He lost his way, battling his inner demons by challenging any cowboy unfortunate enough to get in his way. No one seems to be able to cool him down, except beautiful Bodie Mays. Bodie doesnΓÇÖt mind saving Cane from himself, even if he is a little too tempting for her own peace of mind. But soon BodieΓÇÖs the one who finds herself in need of rescuing ΓÇö only, sheΓÇÖs afraid to tell Cane whatΓÇÖs really going on. How can she trust someone as unpredictable as this fierce cowboy? When her silence only ends up getting her into even deeper hot water, itΓÇÖs up to Cane to save the day. And if he does it right, he wonΓÇÖt be riding off into the sunset alone. ΓÇ£Palmer demonstrates, yet again, why sheΓÇÖs the queen of desperado quests for justice and true love.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇö Publishers Weekly on Dangerous
