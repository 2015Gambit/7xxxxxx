I will do this again if I have to for this week if I can find them, and my pc doesn't screw up as it's been acting flaky since I got back from vacation. "
,assmanvendetta,2012-10-23T16:49Z,thanks dude!
,assmanvendetta,2012-10-23T16:59Z,will seed a couple days!
,BigTimeWhiteBoy,2012-10-23T18:27Z,"I've always been amazed at how consistent wushdishmeen is... he seems like an unstoppable force. Alas, he has gone missing (for a short time, I hope). 

Thank you very much for filling in the gap, jmarko11! 

I will seed indefinitely.

BUBBA-BOOEY!"
,Fitzy727,2012-10-23T20:58Z,WDM is having problems uploading this weeks shows to TPB.  I hope this is legit...  I tend to be very skeptical when I don'y download from a skull here.
,alexfifteen,2012-10-23T22:17Z,I hope this recent trouble for WDM doesnt make him want to stop uploading. I love his uploads.
,freddy213809,2012-10-23T23:28Z,"Thanks so much! WDM has missed days in the past before, and he always catches up when he is able to with all of the Eps he missed. He hasn't missed much though, he is one very consistent Stern uploader lol."
