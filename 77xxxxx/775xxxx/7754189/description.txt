Now settin' sail monthly!  In 'The Housesitter,' SpongeBob looks after Mr. Krabs' house and fends off a fishy cat burglar.  In 'Raising the Curtain of Evil,' Patrick has to think fast to reconstruct SpongeBob's latest issue of Mermaid Man, resulting in a bizarre reading experience.  James Kochalka writes and draws 'SpongeBob Finds a Cave,' in which SpongeBob finds a cave that has a magic hot dog!  Plus: Plankton takes on Mermaid Man, Squidward paints a portrait, and Sandy Cheeks invents a robot so incredible that only you, the reader, could possibly draw it!
