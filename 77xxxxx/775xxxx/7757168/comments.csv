,EDfromRED,2012-10-25T18:03Z,"Thanks Wush!
Any chance of getting ""Back Office Radio"" posted here as well?"
,Fitzy727,2012-10-30T06:22Z,Hmm...  I'm starting to think that Wush has not uploaded today's show due to the hurricane :(
[V],wushdishmeen,2012-10-30T06:33Z,"Sorry guys I'm dealing with hurricane Sandy. There is massive power outages and 20,000,000 people lost power. I will not be able to get the show up for now. This is the first time this has happened in 3 years since I started so you can tell how bad this storm is. There is massive damage as well. Hopefully I get my power back tomorrow but I could be with out it for a week for all I know. I will keep you all posted."
,Fitzy727,2012-10-30T07:03Z,Yeah I'm watching at all the damage the hurricane has done so far...  Shit is crazy man!  Stay safe Wush!!!!
,onedrop75,2012-10-30T11:25Z,Good Luck wush. Thanx again for all your work and I hope all your friends and family are safe
[V],wushdishmeen,2012-10-31T03:44Z,"Still no power.  I have 4G LTE and have my phone tethered to all my devices and my car provides power to charge them, so I can access the internet but with no outlet power I can't produce the WDM releases.  All the equipment and the server that streams and records the shows is down.

I am hoping that power will return shortly but I have no clue when it will.  Thanks for your patience."
,Fitzy727,2012-11-04T10:32Z,"According to WDM's twitter feed, power has been restored and they are working on getting this weeks shows uploaded.  Just thought I'd let you all know :D"
