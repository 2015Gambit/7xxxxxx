NOTE: If you do not already have it, I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this series.  You can find it at: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html
 
NOTE: English Subtitles are muxed into the mkv files.  They are on by default, but you can simply tap the V key while in VLC to disable them.

NOTE: Separate nfo files are included for each of the episodes.  As you can tell by the file names, Episodes 1 & 2 are combined into one hour and a half episode, as are Episodes 3 & 4 and Episodes 5 & 6.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this may be a slow upload.  Many times throughout the upload, there will be no seeders as I will not have Internet access, so please be patient.  You are getting this for free so don't complain, and try your best to refrain from comments of "seed plz."

Enjoy, please rate, seed, and comment!
