,ofpirate,2012-10-25T21:55Z,"wrong section mate.. itll get proper attention if you post it in ""Highres - TV shows"""

oops, that sucks.  And as you may know TPB is pretty shitty in the sense that you cannot edit your torrents, so I can't change that.  I'm glad you noticed, but there is nothing I can do to change that other than hope some mod or something notices and changes it for me."
,ofpirate,2012-10-25T23:12Z,mods in this stream do seem to be fairly active.. what happens if you post it again in the correct section (???) - at least it might enjoy a better chance of success =)
,mike953100,2012-10-25T23:35Z,"I tried that, but it says ""Torrent already exist in system.""  So yeah, no luck.  I hope do hope it somehow gets changed.  Either way, not the end of the world."
