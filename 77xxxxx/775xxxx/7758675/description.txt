|There are no well established activation bypass as of yet, so I have not  |
|included them.                                                            |

|I have made it a point not to modify or customize any windows programs or |
|settings in any way.                                                      |
|Either burn the included .iso file to a dvdr or use a usb flash drive.    |
|I have included diskpart instructions and the win7usb tool.               |
|I personally use diskpart and winrar, but the tool may be easier.         |
