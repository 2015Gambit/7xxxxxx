,hytporsche69,2012-11-09T06:45Z,"Okay, ""EVERYONE"" go and download... FORZA.HORIZON.GERMAN.XBOX360-NSU-RF-MULTI5 from - http://bt.xbox-sky.cc:88/index.php?keywords=Forza+Xbox360+-+German&sort=&NoSeed=0

This is the one verified with abgx360 (green across the board and good to go). Yes, you will have to register to the site.

BEST PART IS... I DOWNLOADED IT, BURNED IT, AND AM NOW PLAYING IT ON MY XBOX AND XBOX LIVE WITH ""ENGLISH"" language. ENJOY! :)"
