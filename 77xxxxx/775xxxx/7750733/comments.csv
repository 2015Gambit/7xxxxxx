I had to spend 4 and half hours to convert the english subtitle into an srt file, THE WORST AND LOUSIEST subtitle file I've seen in my life.

I've watched this twice.

I seriously suggest you learn how to utilise a .sub file (the standard dvd subtitle file) or try using a decent media player which can read dvd .sub files.

I always use crystal player or v player that work fine for me, never DVD player. Most subs in the net are the popular srt type, when it's sub, I use subrip program to convert recognizing the characters. It's usually smooth going, after the first few, goes mostly on its own, PROVIDED the sub characters are well defined images, in this case it was all so garbled that 'recognized' almost whole words amd that with errors to boot. That's why I say the sub quality was ATROCIOUS.

The ocr works better than many.

If your media player doesn't handle standard subtitle files, it's your problem.
It's good to complain, but it's good to be right first."

Thanks, those who don't complain, don't get results...

I tried your subrip program and with these subtitles the 4 and half hours became... 10 minutes !!  It's THAT good... 

The video viewer is also good, a useful alternative.

So, like Bacon wrote: 'All's well that ends well...'

On the other hand...  from what you wrote elsewhere, you seem to be quick to insult people who complain out of frustation at what you uploaded. 

But the 'morons' and 'idiots', as you say, keep this site going by downloading stuff. Otherwise you would be playing with yourself all alone somewhere with all your 'special knowledge and knowhow'.

Pity, I can read your personality from the way you respond to others. Too bad (for you).
