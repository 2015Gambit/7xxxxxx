In 1959, in Romania, six former members of the nomenklatura
and the secret police organize a hold up of the National Bank.
After their arrest, the state forces them to play themselves
in a film which reconstitutes the crime and the investigation.
At the end of their trial, filmed live, they are sentenced to
death and executed.
A month later, the film Reconstitution was released and became
a sensation throughout the country.
