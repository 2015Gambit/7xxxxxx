Our flight to sixth cloud from this heavenly piccadilly compilations, is getting brighter with the melt of psych pop flavored with early progressive rock, giving a different shade to these sunny tunes.
From Still Life to Shulman brothers (pre Gentle Giant) and from Philamore Lincoln's melodic pop to the Merseys merseybeat.
