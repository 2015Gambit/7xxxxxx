You have to wait a while for download to begin. Trackers, DHT and Peer to Peer Exchange need to announce. Look at slot ""Trackers"" in your P2P client. Announcing may take longer when there are a lot of people connecting. Usually you are connected to full Swarm after 10 - 20 minutes (but earlier you are connecting to seeds and leachers that your P2P client is finding during announcing period). So chill out m8 :)"
