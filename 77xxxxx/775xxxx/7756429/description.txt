Meet IrisΓÇª

In the modern, cutthroat corporate world, today's CEO needs an edge to stay on top, and Iris is more than well-trained to oblige the demand of her employerΓÇöincluding murder.

However, Iris discovers the man she has dutifully served for most of her life is far more corrupt than the people she is sworn to protect him from.

Now torn between her loyalties to the only person she's ever served, and the new life she realizes she's ready to explore on her own, she must make a choice that could ultimately lead to her demise.
