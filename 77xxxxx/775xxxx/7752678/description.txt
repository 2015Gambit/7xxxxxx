########Darksiders 2 PC - All saves
--
########Where to put the saves :
~Windows XP path for Darksiders 2 save game :
"C:Documents and Settings\My DocumentsMy GamesDarksiders2"
~Windows Vista/7 path for Darsksiders 2 save game :
"C:Users\DocumentsMy GamesDarksiders2"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And in the "Darksiders2" folder, you put the "English" folder of the save you want to play with.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~Skidrow :
"C:Users\AppDataLocalSKIDROW50650Storage"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here you just put the two "dssaveX*.dsav" from the "Darksiders 2English" folder in the "SKIDROW50650" folder.
X* = number, example : 0 and 4, so your files would like "dssave0.dsav" and "dssave4.dsav".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~Steam (if your game is Installed on Steam) :
"C:Program Files (x86)Steamuserdata4179320050650emote"
--------------------
Same as with Skidrow
--------------------
~UPDATE: In some folders, you should see a folder named "3974135863", you put it in "C:Users\DocumentsMy GamesDarksiders2", with the "English" folder.
(Info : the folder "3974135863" was created after I updated the game with the 3rd patch for the green portal to work.)
