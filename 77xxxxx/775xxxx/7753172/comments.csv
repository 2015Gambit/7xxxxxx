,chrisroberts2,2012-10-26T15:49Z,Could you do Duke Nukem Forever with dlc pack The doctor who cloned me next? 
,Robspace1,2012-10-28T06:43Z,"Hey there, fellow gamers! I would love to play this game as I just finished MOH 2010.  Can we all please play fair and seed for the next person? It keeps the whole process working and we can all enjoy these games at a price we can all afford in these trying times. I will take a vow to seed every game I dl for at least as long as it took me to dl the game. If it took two days to get, then I'll seed for 2 days. I think thats fair. It would be better to seed longer.
 Some of us need to delete the games after playing them due to limited hard drive space. I will be adding a much bigger one very soon and I'll keep all games installed and seed them all. How bout you guys?

,sealtmx1,2012-10-29T02:40Z,"be careful petersona95's solution does work, but it includes viruses and i think a backdoor, so make sure you scan it imminently and remove the threats. it does fix the freeing after breaching doors glitch. "
