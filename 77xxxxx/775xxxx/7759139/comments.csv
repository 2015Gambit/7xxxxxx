,michaelrwatson,2012-10-26T00:54Z,How can this be a Blueray or DVD rip..? It doesn't even hit theatres until next week.
,whymichael,2012-10-26T01:27Z,"Oh this movie stinks.

A - 8
V - 9
M - 4

Avast ye maties this one is a horror show. The acting is (literally) laughable and the action is like out of some kind of a Lifetime movie. YOU DON'T EVEN GET TO SEE ROSARIO DAWSON'S TITS!!

I usually burn flicks and hand them over to friends or family after watching. This one? RIGHT in the trash!

Thanks for your effort extremezone."

,michaelrwatson,2012-10-26T07:27Z,"Okay, 1st question answered, so 2nd question: How can Hollywood spend $20M making a straight-to-DVD movie? Is it intended to be released mainly overseas? 5/10 on IMDb is not encouraging..... "
