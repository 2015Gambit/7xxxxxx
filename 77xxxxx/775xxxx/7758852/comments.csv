,frostfro,2012-10-26T03:09Z,Thanks for the uploads Pyrogoeth. i luv u baybe
,Pyrogoeth,2012-10-26T04:55Z,"Yeah I love me too, I'm p fucking great."
,fatcerberus1,2012-10-26T06:42Z,"Geez, I was starting to think the last Solo Album Month album was vaporware.  Genesis Frog was well worth the wait though, so it's all good. :-)

Just a quick question though: Why is Symphony Impossible to Play only 128kbps?"
,Pyrogoeth,2012-10-26T14:23Z,Aw jeez is it really? Damnit I fucked up somewhere. I'll update that for the next torrent I guess xD
