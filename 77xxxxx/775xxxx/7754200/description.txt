- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  2012 release, the sixth album from the New Jersey-based Metal band. Known for
  their bilingual vocals and signature blend of Latin-influenced, aggressive
  modern metal, Ill Nino have been a pinnacle artist in their genre going into
  their 15th year as a band. They have come this far due to their incredible
  work ethic, performing thousands of shows worldwide, achieving significant
  radio and music videos success, and selling more than a million albums in the
  process. Ill Nino have managed to mix the ferocity and melody of all five
  previous releases together creating the leanest, meanest and most beautifully
  violent album of their career.
