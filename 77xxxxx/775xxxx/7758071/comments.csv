,CrysisHawk,2012-10-25T17:22Z,TY YIFY :)
,FriendlySpidey,2012-10-25T17:36Z,"Thanks! Now everyone can stop asking for it on your other torrents.
"
,wasimdon,2012-10-25T18:06Z,how is the video quality can anyone answer
,Spidey_Fan,2012-10-25T18:48Z,been waiting for you to upload this for the longest time thanks YIFY!!!!!!!
,stepcrft,2012-10-25T19:16Z,"@mike953100, I agree about the audio of YIFY's torrents. As you stated, ""the audio is an abomination."" Especially considering how great the video is of YIFY's rips. I love YIFY's compact files. They are amazing, but the audio awful!

Do you know of any other TPB user similar to YIFY that rips with good audio? I really love YIFY because of the file size, but would also love to find someone who rips with good audio (ie: 6 channels)

I looked you up and see that you also rip with similar amazingly small size AND you have great audio! But, you obviously don't have as much time as YIFY to put out the quantity of titles.

Is there anyone like YIFY on TPB that rips with good audio?

THANKS @mike953100!

AND THANKS YIFY for all your hard work!!!!! I just wish you would rip with better audio."
,upx3,2012-10-25T20:49Z,"YIFY sometimes mislabels his rips w/o the LQ or line audio warning. Now, I never know which of his releases are true retail BluRay quality... and which are not.

Can't guarantee the quality on ALL of his rips, but this is another good source for mHD with DD5.1 audio.
http://thepiratebay.se/user/Brownsugar13/

And Ganool seems to have many HQ m720p (stereo) rips.
http://thepiratebay.se/search/Ganool/0/3/200

Any other trusted mHD rippers at TPB ?"
,stepcrft,2012-10-25T21:51Z,Thanks upx3! Much appreciated!
,3ntomb3d,2012-10-25T22:32Z,Been waiting for this one. Thanks for the up YIFY team. BTW who's the encoder for this one?

either use MKV2VOB to rencode into mp4 without loss of quality and removing cinavia

OR

Play on a cinavia free device like an xbox 360"
,djbuddha,2012-10-29T05:18Z,NOT A BLURAY RIP. It can't be one when its not even on BR yet. you really need to change your take and title posting. good quality for what it is though

,handsomebob123,2012-10-31T12:14Z,"a:6
v:9

There are several moments where the audio is very quiet (at least in VLC), but otherwise is high quality. If not for that I would say a:9 also.

No problems with video, very good."
,phat_71,2012-10-31T19:42Z,"I love when people say stuff can't be a BluRay or DVD rip because it's not even out yet. Seems to me I had the DVD version of the Avengers a little over a full month before it was out on DVD here. It doesn't release on the same dates everywhere, I'm pretty sure it doesn't take a super genius to figure that little bit out.

Besides that, Yify hasn't let us down before, I doubt now is the time to start."
,boobstrap,2012-11-01T06:53Z,"seriously, this movie sucks so hard that solid iron feels soft in comparsion...spiderman one bilion twelve, but now the first one again...seriously?!"
,bantig,2012-11-02T14:05Z,"You, YIFY guys, are fantastic! Your uploads are more than excellent! Keep on making us be attached to screens at nights!
P.S.: My daughter is begging you to upload ""Brave"".
Thanks in advance!"
,meraj666,2012-11-03T07:01Z,Gr8 work YIFY. I am still wondering who d f*** gives a -1 to such gr8 uploader. Shame on you guyz.. u gettin such awesome quality for free and u f****ng around nd giving -1. this is sick....!!
