SuperRam Makes your Computer run faster by Taking Control and Managing the Memory on your Computer Efficiently. If you notice your computer is running slow, this typically is due to the memory (RAM) running out of usable space. When memory space gets lower, Windows then starts opening programs into the Windows page file; this page file is the computer hard drive which is much slower than RAM. SuperRam switches this behavior and puts old programs into the Windows page file and any newly opened programs are put into actual RAM.


Change this in How Windows programs and operates Allows Games to run faster. With SuperRam, Memory Management is Tuned to Maintain Stability Computer but a Greater emphasis is Placed on Computer Performance. Once installed SuperRam begins to monitor the total amount of memory your computer has installed, it also monitors when your computer reaches a threshold of memory to maintain, when that threshold is reached SuperRam immediately will release all memory that it determines can be released on the computer system back to Windows. When SuperRam is installed any new Application, program or game is opened That Will use physical Memory installed on the Computer and applications Placing That opened Previously you to use virtual Memory. This allows software to run with an emphasis on performance when performance is needed; such as when playing games, editing photos / videos, using processor and memory intensive applications.
