Presenting the story that started it all! This graphic novel features the first comics story in which the Smurfs ever appeared! In Medieval times, Johan, a royal page, and his friend Peewit, come upon a magic flute that makes those who listen to it too long dance until they collapse from exhaustion. When a thief steals the magic flute, Johan and Peewit must seek out the makers of the flute, the Smurfs, to make another magic flute to combat the thief in this wildly funny tale.
