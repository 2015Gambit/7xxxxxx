You need to start the game, From start menu shortcut, Remember to cross that option during install, It worked for me."

,Nounread,2012-10-24T15:42Z,@fyrepony Didn't work for me.
,Wolfcry,2012-10-24T15:51Z,Not working?.
,Mojkie,2012-10-24T15:54Z,"No it's not working. Noone of my friends got it working, and didn't see anybody post it's working."
,Wolfcry,2012-10-24T15:56Z,"The process is running, but that's it.

Done everything I could possibly think of.

W/e, got no patience. I'm buying it."
,chs-rg,2012-10-24T15:57Z,"Doesn't work for me either, just hogs 25% of CPUs without actually starting.

My suspicion is that it might be a language thing: the installer is Russian and files in the directory have cryptic names.

@Nounread and @Mojkie
Thats probably just the caching of your browsers its properly explaned at http://www.refreshyourcache.com"
[V],azaq318,2012-10-24T15:58Z,"Guys !

I couldn't be more sorry for this release :(

It seems like this is my Epic Fail with this Game. I would delete it, but I can't :( It works for me, but I might screwd up with registry key... 

MODERATORS!
Please delete this topic!"
,BlackCato,2012-10-24T16:10Z,Just wondering if anyone has got it to work yet. It isn't working for me.
,BlackCato,2012-10-24T16:11Z,Well shit the comment wasn't updating disregard my last comment.
,kuler1,2012-10-24T16:28Z,"no, it is not working"
,chs-rg,2012-10-24T16:37Z,"if it just is registry stuff, then it should be easily fixable, right?

maybe you could just post your relevant keys, azaq318?"
,Mojkie,2012-10-24T16:40Z,"PLS PLS PLS PLS
