Now, this is one real hardcore! Because a) the location (now
known as "Mitsubishi Electric Halle") is a rather spacious one,
and b) the stage happened to be in some considerable distance
from where the guy with the walkman was. Nevertheless, it was
a great evening, to be sure. (Btw: Does anyone know what became
of the opening band, the back then almost close to one day
certainly to become famous "Kowalski"?)

You may want to adjust the balance a little on the second
track. What you get is as ripped from my cassette, with no
noise reduction or any other post processing applied on
my side. This is what you want, this is what you get, hrr hrr.
