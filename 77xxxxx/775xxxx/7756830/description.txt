There's magic and mastery aplenty in "The Wolf's Mouth," a docu-fiction hybrid that represents a breathtakingly impressive debut from Pietro Marcello. Though running a bare-minimum feature length of 70 minutes (six shorter than the press notes and Berlinale catalog claim), it packs multiple layers and subjects into its densely intricate but enticingly accessible structure. A highly unusual love story between a macho ex-con and a transsexual former drug-addict, it's also an exploration and celebration of their home city of Genoa, delicately examining the past's interactions with the present.
