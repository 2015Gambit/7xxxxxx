"TRUTHS & DESTINIES," PART 1
Tom Judge and Tilly Grimes are not the only ones that know the hidden truths of the universe. The Catholic Church knows dark realities kept secret from the world and they have agents to protect us from those secrets. Whether we want them to... or not. RON MARZ (MAGDALENA, SHINKU) and STJEPAN SEJIC (ANGELUS) re-introduce one of Top Cow's most popular characters into the "Rebirth" universe in a special two-part story.

I decided to upload Artifacts and Witchblade too from now on. ENJOY AND SEED!!!
