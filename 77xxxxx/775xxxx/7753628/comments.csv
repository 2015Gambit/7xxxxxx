M- Meh.... Nothing new or original. Just another documentary of how hip-hop/rap came to be. Only difference is Ice-T is doing the interviewing instead of just being interviewed. Plenty of freestyles from legendary rappers and MC's which is always cool.. If you were born in the early to mid 80's and you're a true rap fan, you will already know all of the stuff they talk about in this. If you're a youngster and want to get schooled by some REAL rappers, by all means, mute your lil wayne CD, then watch and learn about where rap really came from.    "
