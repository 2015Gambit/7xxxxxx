,Solidstores,2012-10-24T19:21Z,"Fast upload, but I never find the subs in the link provided to glowgaze.. Where in the glowgaze page is the link to theng subs exactly?? Thanks for help"
,Knuckles654,2012-10-24T20:17Z,Is this HD?
,xoScar,2012-10-24T22:13Z,@Solidstores it's been asked in every torrent. They'll be added later because you can't change the title once you upload a torrent. So in order to get us what we want quickly at first there are no subs then they are added asap.
,ScruffyNerfherder,2012-10-28T07:31Z,Thanks GlowGaze!!! i have been on the road for work and missed the first 5 episodes... keep up the good work!!

,MorphzreaZ,2012-10-31T17:24Z,@ Glowgaze.... if u say +subtitles...how bout adding them?...... 90% of ur uploads say they have subs but they dont... -1
,jalucian,2012-11-11T15:12Z,"And he has explained why in the comments section of just about every previous episode. Personally, I think he just just wait a few hours until the subtitles are ready to post the torrent so he can include them in the torrent, but pointing this out when it's been explained at least 6 times already makes you look like quite the idiot."
