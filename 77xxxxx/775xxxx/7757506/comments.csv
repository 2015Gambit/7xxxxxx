You should pay attention. I already do ""Once Upon A Time"" & ""The Walking Dead"".

Aside from that, I generally upload shows that I watch and ""Greys Anatomy"" just got too stupid for me - did the first ep this season and it wasn't until the very end that they referenced the plane crash from the previous season. Felt ripped off.

Didn't like ep 1 of ""Gossip Girl"" (didn't like the premise).

As for ""Vampire Diaries"", almost watched it - but there are just too damn many vampire shows.

So, I don't do what I do because it's popular.

Here's a suggestion - how about you do it?

It's not that hard. a UseNet account, encoding software & a VPN account for safety. Twenty bucks a month.

Let me know - I'll help.

,pragmato,2012-11-03T20:20Z,reading comments and post one on my own is somehow ironic after watching this creepy episode I got from your supreme torrent. way better than going outside and talk to people in video stores for instance or rely on the spooty laggy southpark-studio stream. Thank you very much MP4SUX. Just keep doin' your groovy craftsmanship xD
,swes87,2012-11-12T14:26Z,looks great! 10/10. wish everyone released torrents in avi instead of the silly mp4 format!
