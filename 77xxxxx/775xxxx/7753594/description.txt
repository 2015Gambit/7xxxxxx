Finally, after 2 years, a new PS3 CFW!! By Rogero. Credits to the guy who leaked us the LV0 keys and zhang yong from BlueDisk who wanted to make $$$ from this and pushed the leaker into keaking... so no money for ReDRMers! Credits to eussNL and the PS3DevWiki for the valuable and always up-to-date source of information.
Credits to Deank for his continuous efforts on Multiman and many other PS3 tools/fixes. But the Chinese were the ones that keep opening the door.. from original JB to TB to BlueDisk.. thank you! FUCK YOU TO THE DEVS WHO HAD THIS 6 MONTHS AGO BUT WERE TOO COOL TO SHARE.. YOU SAD MUMMY'S BOYS!




Note for anyone who downgraded to 3.55 via hardware flasher: This CFW doesn't have LV1 checks disabled and can't be installed on Downgraded PS3 consoles unless you have Dehashed/Reset Syscon Properly (if you're not sure about your PS3, Dehash it anyway to avoid any risk). This applies to only a tiny percentage of users.




Enjoy all the latest games without patching/dongling or any messing about!



Update from 3.55 kmweaw or 3.55 OFW, if on 3.41 or TB. 3.56+ users will have to wait a bit for downgrade.



Copy onto any USB stick, rename to PS3UPDAT.PUP, and install via XMB. That's it!
Use this with multiMAN ver 04.07.01 FULL (20121021) - included in torrent. ***Change payload from Hermes to standard.****



This is not fake, check ps3hax, ps3crunch, psx-scene for confirmation.






ROMNEY 2012!
