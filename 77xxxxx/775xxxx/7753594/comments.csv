,UKballerz,2012-10-23T22:08Z,"You should put up warning about possible bricked. There are many reports (probably noone's fault) of PS3 being bricked after upgrading. 
Rogero also say the best safe way to upgrade is through the recovery menu or wait for a few days when a newer and safer CFW is release with brick proof."
[V],thenoobish,2012-10-23T22:11Z,Thats nice man :D Almost all new ps3 games got many more downloaders now ^^
,dududus,2012-10-23T22:32Z,"fauzan18

convert back to cex, dehash (do a google search for Dehashing/Syscon Reset Tutorial for Downgraded Consoles) and you can install this.

btw always best to install CFW from recovery menu"

you must downgrade to 3.55 first

Or do I have to downgrade it to play 3.55 games again?

so can it play 4.21 games only?"
,dududus,2012-10-24T07:35Z,"rishi82in 

I wrote in the description: 

Update from 3.55 kmweaw or 3.55 OFW, if on 3.41 or TB.

Can you get back into recovery?

lightcompact:

you can play all games. if error, delete game data from xmb."

,Mno74,2012-10-24T19:08Z,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Warning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating that number but I can speak from personal experience. My CECH-2001A PS3 is among the unlucky bricks after installing one of the new CFW's by BlueDisk or Rogero. It seems that it does not matter what model you have. Right now it's a crap shoot on whether or not you will be among the unlucky paper weight owners.

I've been seeing countless reports of bricks using these new firmwares. Rogero has stated that he is working on an updated version that is safer but nothing is 100% foolproof so take this warning to heart.

IF YOU DO NOT OWN A HARDWARE FLASHER DO NOT INSTALL ANY NEW CFW UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE"

,arthurmk,2012-10-24T21:39Z,"Não sei pq tem ANTA que não da detalhes do procedimento!
Para instalar a NOVA CWF, tem que estar com a 3.55 original. Acredito que muitos Bricks se deve por terem jogado por cima da CFW.
PORTANTO ANTES DE ATUALIZAR VEJA SE ESTÁ COM A 3.55 ORIGINAL (OFW)."
,arthurmk,2012-10-24T21:49Z,"ACHO QUE O MONGO APAGOU MEU COMENTÁRIO!
PARA ATUALIZAR TEM QUE ESTAR NA FIRMWARE ORIGINAL 3.55 !!!! SE TIVER COM A CFW, FAÇAM ATUALIZAÇÃO PARA A OFW. O ZANZA NÃO DA DETALHES E LA EM CIMA EXPLICA ERRADO."
,Mno74,2012-10-25T05:52Z,"After Testing with some bricked Slim consoles ( from updating to CFW4.21 ) with different friends and testers around the world,
I can confirm that Bricked consoles can be recovered back to CFW3.55 even if you didn't have a NOR Dump/Backup .


Requirements are:
1- a Hardware Flasher so you can read/write to the PS3 NOR flash
2- A Dongle with PSgrade payload (any old jailbreak dongle + PSGrade hex will do) used to Enter Factory Service Mode (FSM)
3- Rogero CEX3.55 v3.7 PUP

for more details about Recovering from the Brick please check this new thread ----> Brick-Recovery Procedure from CFW4.21 back to CFW3.55

Note:
- I didn't receive any Brick report from any FAT PS3 that updated to CFW4.21, so it seems FAT consoles are not being affected by the bug.

- Apparently only the last downgradable Slim models are affected (CECH-25xx with Datecode 1A and base FW version = 3.50)

- I Also know that there are also few Slims that bricked with model CECH-20xx but 90% of the reports were model
(CECH-25xx with Datecode 1A and base FW version = 3.50).

- The Brick may be caused by the boot-loaders not being written correctly into the NOR during the Update process.

Please note also that all the above info may not be 100% accurate,
things are still being worked on so nothing is confirmed at all and I don't promise anything about an updated CFW.

-RogerO "
,Mno74,2012-10-25T05:58Z,"Recovery Procedure :
1- Dump the current NOR Flash of the bricked PS3 at least 3 times using a hardware flasher (Progskeet / E3 / TEENSY++) 
2- Verify that it is properly dumped and you have a valid dump by comparing your dumps or following these steps ---> Validating_flash_dumps
3- Patch the dump using Rogero PS3 NOR Auto Patcher ---> PS3_Nor_Dump_Auto_Patcher_v0.01.rar ( Clicked 1057 times )
3- Flash the Patched Dump back into the PS3 NOR using the Hardware flasher.
4- From this point you can continue as a normal Downgrade Procedure by entering Factory Service Mode using the dongle and Flashing Rogero CEX-3.55 v3.7 from the USB stick."

,dududus,2012-10-26T02:15Z,"Anyone who has bricked:

a) you can get the console unbricked by a modder. cost: $20-$30

b) you can buy a flasher and DIY. cost: $40-$90 which you can sell again after flashing

c) wait for the devs to make a fix.. not a certainty, not an impossibility


Go for option a)"
