Two important goals of ergonomics are the comfort, and the health and safety of workers. In many ways these are mutually compatible, for where health and safety is jeopardized, the discomfort results. Most work-related injuries can be viewed as biochemical damage to a tissue or organ; ultimately all injuries are sustained by tissues. 

Written by leaders in the field, this text deals systematically with the biomechanics of tissues and organs in the workplace. The book establishes a foundation for the understanding of gross biomechanical loads on the human system at tissue level. It also provides details of the biomechanics of organs, themselves a composite of different tissues, and the differential effect and vulnerability of structures of the organ. Finally, the whole body system is dealt with in a biomechanical context. This text is a thorough description and discussion of common or work-related injuries, their mechanisms and the theories behind them. Chapters provide ergonomic relevance, ergonomic scenarios, and practical ergonomic advice on appropriate interventions.
