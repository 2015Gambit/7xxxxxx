,D34THW41K3R,2012-11-08T23:40Z,what does the Medicine: disinfected mean? is that you saying it is cracked?
,AMForce,2012-11-11T09:27Z,"Medicine: Disinfected
mean
NOT Infected by Virus"
,mayoralink,2012-11-19T06:14Z,Is this Vocaloid 3 or Vocaloid 3 Assign Edition?
,alexvox,2012-11-19T16:05Z,"this is cracked Vocaloid3 called Vocaloid 3 Free Edition
Team Assign disbanded at the begining of the April
Though team R2R considered that AE belongs to them now (cause they have former AE-members)
all FE libraries released wav-breaths sounds, AE-libraries doesn't have such files, also FE are multilingual editor (more supported language interfaced and contains about 70 job plugins in installation package)"
,alexvox,2012-11-19T16:25Z,"just to dispel different rumors AE and FE is a different crack releases from different people
Assign Edition by Team Assign and now by Team R2R, they're was first who cracked editor and released Legacy (V2) libraries for them
then all V3-libraries was released by AlexVox (FE-releases) before Team AssignR2R did that!
Alexvox libraries contains wav-breaths and installers are ~20% smaller (because of stronger compression)
What about editors, latest AE is 3040, though R2R released 3050 in 2nd November
But before, 3041FE (23march) and 3050FE (22July) was released by Alexvox. All stuff are back-2-back compatible, which means you can use FEAE editor with AEFE libraries and vice versa. Which one to use is a question of taste, but obviously less file size - easy to download and store)))"
,199782ib,2012-11-19T20:46Z,"@AMForce I have a question. Can you upload VOCALOID 1 libraries? Like Kaito, Meiko and others. I mean if they are converted to work on VOCALOID 3."
,alexvox,2012-11-20T04:58Z,V1-libraries are not able to work with V2V3-engines
,AMForce,2012-11-21T13:48Z,"@199782ib Vocaloid 2 & Vocaloid 3 only supported V2 & V3 library.

,LaptopNoodle,2012-11-25T23:27Z,"It's beautiful, works perfectly.
One thing is, I don't have complete freedom with creating notes, as in I can't make smaller notes. I can see the outline of it, though. If you could fix that it'd be great."
