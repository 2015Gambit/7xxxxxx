This British movie is about a group of inept criminals who decide to rob a bank so they can save their grandfather&#x27;s retirement home from being demolished by developers. Meanwhile on another building site some workers dig up an old graveyard and they get bitten by the &#x22;undead&#x22; which sets off a chain reaction. Then the bank robbers are cornered by the police while in the process of the robbery, but when they exit they find that they are all dead as a result of the horde of zombies. They have to get to the retirement home before the zombies do!
