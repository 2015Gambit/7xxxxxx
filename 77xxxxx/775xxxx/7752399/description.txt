In 1870, Tonto lies near death, as the Lone Ranger pleads with the Ute Indians for help from their Shaman. Three years prior, Tonto lived a relatively peaceful and happy life with his tribe. How did Tonto come to be a lone brave by the time he found John Reid near death in that desert chasm? The answer unfolds, as Tonto's happy life is shattered. Tonto fights for his life in the present, as he fights for his soul in the past. The Native Ground arc rolls toward its bloody climax in a heart-breaking tale of loss and revenge.
