,kungfiju,2012-10-25T17:35Z,"T.F.K, why your file has 242.16 MB and similiar version of the others has about 117 MB? What's the difference? Thx"

,cl0udzer0,2012-10-27T01:09Z,thanks my bro!!!
,a002074t,2012-10-28T03:19Z,"The 2050 patch only works for Antivirus Pro.  Does NOT work with Internet Security version.  You can start plugging in license files for the Internet Security until you get to a valid one, but eventually you'll get a pop-up saying your version is ILLEGAL.  Haven't seen that yet with the PRO version and patch, but I just installed it..."
,oshua,2012-10-28T08:14Z,"yo.. T.F.K

,oshua,2012-10-29T07:56Z,"hey guys this dose work for internet security version . patch dose work, password zenix is good . ''check there images for install instructions'' . if you have a problem with there licence provided with the patch, go to your local c drive . click  program files . then click  avast  . then avast internet security . then licence, chose anyone of them just gotta click on it and it will be all sweet.   "

,Rand0mX1985,2012-11-08T20:12Z,"It worked fine for me the only problem now is that after using it for a week it keeps saying ""Your Avast Software is Illegal and Will Be Shut Down!"""
,Rand0mX1985,2012-11-08T22:18Z,Your avast! Internet Security is illegal and will be shut down  -  This is an illegal version of avast! Internet Security  -  You are using a pirated (stolen) copy of avast! Internet Security. Please obtain a legal license to be protected against the latest threats.
,RedAutumn,2012-11-11T01:01Z,"Lol at the people failing to install Avast with blacklisted keys.

Avast is a joke. So is T.F.K.

Google ""Microsoft Security Essentials"". You're welcome!"
,dragan_id,2012-11-12T19:46Z,Unusable!
,ImKris,2012-11-14T06:59Z,"wtf, I keep getting a ""version is illegal"", how can i fix this? I use the Pro version!"
,miguelmig,2012-11-15T00:48Z,I can not download
,h_khan_online,2012-11-16T09:18Z,"Thanks T.F.K. ll must try this,, I m using avast 6 for long time.
@Imkris
I also get ""illegal version"" message after every updating, but its still running and keep updating, so don't worry,"
,h_khan_online,2012-11-16T09:35Z,"@RandomX
keep saying that,, don't worry, u would noticed that either this msg is appears,  avast still keep updating and work fine, just close this msg, don't update or press any button appears in this msg box."
,BrunoHerz,2012-11-19T11:47Z,"For anyone getting the Illegal pirate(stolen) warning pop-up: With Internet Security program this can be eradicated by adding the AvastUI.exe program line (from Avasts program folder) to the firewall application rules and selecting ""Block all connections"".Definition updating and program performance seem unaffected by this. It works for me - Try it!!! If you have Pro antivirus installed I don't know that it works."
,D255,2012-11-20T12:46Z,"T.F.K;
Thank you very much

,meero123,2012-11-22T15:48Z,@ T.F.K can pls upload ISA 2006 std edition
,dread_rokk,2012-11-22T23:37Z,"@ h_khan_online

,freeman13,2012-11-23T03:15Z,"It works and it's awesome. I've been using avast for years and even tho its low end shit, it does its job like crazy"
,nevamess,2012-11-23T07:43Z,hi there.. it says the antivirus pro edition license is expired and the crack 2050 is not working.. please anyone guide 
,nevamess,2012-11-23T07:50Z,i found something if it says ur software is illegal go to program files>avast>avastUI run this file ull be redeemed 
,tpirates,2012-11-25T22:05Z,"Ok, so i've downloaded this torrent on my Windows Vista 64 bit Home edition and once i've followed the instruction (using the patch instead of the 700KB crack) i've realized that it does not work and in addition to not working, it freezes the computer everytime it starts (had to goto safe mode to delete the damn avast installation). I don't know about windows 7 or 8 but it seems more than likely that this does not work on Vista. Tried both Avast Antivirus Pro & Internet Security!

PS: Malwarebytes has identified the patch & crack to be PUP, which is obviously a false positive but it may cause instability while your trying to crack the program."
