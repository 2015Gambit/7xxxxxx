 : One April morning in 1943, a sardine fisherman spotted the corpse of a     :
 : British soldier floating in the sea off the coast of Spain and set in train:
 : a course of events that would change the course of the Second World War.   :
 : Operation Mincemeat was the most successful wartime deception ever         :
 : attempted, and certainly the strangest. It hoodwinked the Nazi espionage   :
 : chiefs, sent German troops hurtling in the wrong direction, and saved      :
 : thousands of lives by deploying a secret agent who was different, in one   :
 : crucial respect, from any spy before or since: he was dead. His mission: to:
 : convince the Germans that instead of attacking Sicily, the Allied armies   :
 : planned to invade Greece.                                                  :
 : The brainchild of an eccentric RAF officer and a brilliant Jewish          :
 : barrister, the great hoax involved an extraordinary cast of characters     :
 : including a famous forensic pathologist, a gold-prospector, an inventor, a :
 : beautiful secret service secretary, a submarine captain, three novelists, a:
 : transvestite English spymaster, an irascible admiral who loved fly-fishing,:
 : and a dead Welsh tramp. Using fraud, imagination and seduction, Churchill's:
 : team of spies spun a web of deceit so elaborate and so convincing that they:
 : began to believe it themselves. The deception started in a windowless      :
 : basement beneath Whitehall. It travelled from London to Scotland to Spain  :
 : to Germany. And it ended up on Hitler's desk. Ben Macintyre, bestselling   :
 : author of Agent Zigzag, weaves together private documents, photographs,    :
 : memories, letters and diaries, as well as newly released material from the :
 : intelligence files of MI5 and Naval Intelligence, to tell for the first    :
 : time the full story of Operation Mincemeat.
