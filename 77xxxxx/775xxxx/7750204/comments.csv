,Calbus,2012-10-29T01:52Z,"Just curious about laws in the U.S. and TV shows. I pay for cable, but instead of watching them on TV I usually just DL them and watch on the pc because of HD avail' most of the time. 2 part question. Is it technically illegal to watch the shows (HD or not) on the pc vs. the TV? In a sense this is what people (and myself) did in the 80's with VCR's and today that is replaced with Tivo, etc. 2nd part If there is really no issue with the 'concept' would be illegal if I downloaded HD shows but not paying for HD cable, just regular cable? Just curious. Keep up the good work and thanks in advance to any who can answer."
