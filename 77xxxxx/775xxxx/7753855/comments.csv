Short text description: Adriana is in the same category like the FGs. Nude, but doesn't shows all. Sometimes the Nipples are showing, and a bare Ass."

,Hkship,2012-10-24T11:51Z,"your computer:
what do you mean ""up to 6 gb for torrents"""
,5-click,2012-10-24T13:11Z,"@HKskpi: That means, now i have a x64 OS and utorrent x64 running. The overall RAM is 8GB and the utorrent can use up to 6GB. Usually i have more upload than download, so i can use the RAM as a buffer for Read Accesses. That means, i have lesser read accesses from the disc and the system runs with a lesser CPU rate and the HD live longer.  I've made a screenshot for better understanding.

The normal utorrent can use only up to1280MB as Cache, thats not much, if you see my upload list. 
A little Warning: Be sure, what you do, if want to install the utorrent x64. Its still in beta and a little bit instable (the programmer says). You get no help from the team, so you're alone. I've tested it in a virtual machine for 6 weeks, before i have it finally installed on my little server. It takes round about 24hours, to switch from x86 to x64.  "
