When TPB uploads started working again I started six.

Three started going gangbusters almost immediately.

And three simply will NOT start. This is SO frustrating (for you too).

By now you know that the ""49"" seeds that TPB reports is something less than accurate.

I'm putting these comments here because of the six, this is the one that's
attracted the most peers. It's also the only one that I've uploaded to four sites.

It looks like it wants to work (.1 & .2 flutter on and off), but no go.

I manually added additional trackers to the KAT version and my own.

Maybe if you re-download the torrent from there, it'll add the additional trackers.

Or maybe my anti-scene efforts has caused me to become cursed ...

Couldn't think of a better way to go down.

Any ideas would be welcome at this point.

It's like trackers can identify and black list me ... sometimes yes ... sometimes no ...

Sigh ...

I'm SO confused ...
