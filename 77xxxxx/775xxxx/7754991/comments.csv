,SSJASON,2012-10-24T10:28Z,No problem. Enjoy. It's fun as hell.
,auxois116,2012-10-24T10:35Z,I've heard this version comes up with a trojan.gen on antiviruses. Might be the crack being a false positive but not sure if I want to chance it. Just a heads up.
,Tha_14,2012-10-24T12:57Z,"Nice and clean. Thanks for the download ;)
PS: There are no viruses or any harm in this torrent, if your av says that it is a virus it is just the installer which is packet protected ;)"
,randir12,2012-10-24T14:27Z,"Whenever I try starting the game I get this error:

""ERROR in 
action number 1 
of Create Event 
for object objDevolver: 

Error defining an external function.""

Sometimes the game works if I click ignore, but there's no sound."
,auxois116,2012-10-24T15:02Z,@randir12 I got the same issue with the Conspire version I downloaded. There is still sound just no music. Sucks not to hear the music cause for this game I'd like to be immersed in the 80s style music while playing.
,RagnarT,2012-10-24T18:35Z,"@randir12 The readme file says

""If you get an error saying ""Error defining external function""
please install one of the files in the ""folder redist"".

Use the x64 version if you're on a 64-bit system.
Otherwise use the x86 version."""
[V],cactus69,2012-10-24T18:54Z,"Hey there! 

I'm Jonatan Soderstrom, me and my friend Dennis Wedin made this game. We're working on an update that hopefully will take care of any/all bugs, and we'll try to do some extra polish in the next few days. Would be great if you could update the torrent when the patch is out! It'd be great if people get to play it without any bugs popping up.

Hope everyone will enjoy the game!

For the ""Error defining an external function."" problem, try restarting your system and play again, it can pop up when your computer has been running for a while. We'll try to figure out if there's more to it than that."
,SoRusty,2012-10-24T19:31Z,"Cactus, how pathetic are you to try and pretend to be a dev? And you fucking pieces of shit pirating a game made by 2 guys, this is why PC gaming is dying.

Cunts."
,KoldPT,2012-10-24T20:06Z,"@cactus

cheers. if it runs well I'll probably get it next month."
,SSJASON,2012-10-24T20:44Z,"@SoRusty so you're complaining about PC piracy, yet browsing the top pirate site in the world? 

Cool story bro. Please Tell it again?"
,slowdive1,2012-10-24T20:44Z,"sorusty you sorry impecile, how are the PC games dying? kill yourself."
,randir12,2012-10-25T01:00Z,"@RagnarT

There is no redist folder, at least not in this release."

,hustlakid,2012-10-25T03:29Z,Thanks for the upload ssjason.  Hope this is the gog version and not as buggy as the steam version that I just BOUGHT.  They shouldn't have released it so bugged out.  Unbelievable.  
,chillip,2012-10-25T09:45Z,"For those who have Error defining an external function, you can reinstall game and restart pc. Then it works fine, but you must restart. Dont forget to buy this game."
,thekillawife,2012-10-25T16:17Z,My virusprogram says theres a trojan in this.
[M],Hero,2012-10-25T18:05Z,"Just for the record, looks like cactus69 is really Jonatan Soderstrom...."
,slowdive1,2012-10-25T18:50Z,"@Hero no surprise, real developers are reasonable about piracy. In the end this site is helping them, too, with more people spreading the word about their work."
[V],cactus69,2012-10-25T19:46Z,Patch should be up soon. Feel free to buy the game if you like it. I know what it's like not having money though.
,noremakk,2012-10-25T20:08Z,Thanks for this-- really want this game but the budget's tight and I can't gamble $10 on something until I try it first!
,Ultranist,2012-10-25T20:13Z,All of you need to support those devs and not some greedy publishers like EA and activision.
,Beaverman,2012-10-25T20:26Z,"@cactus69 Being an indie i'm not surprised you do, seeing as there's a very real chance (as an indie) won't get payed for the work you do... so i wish you the best of luck."
,iTHEIF,2012-10-25T20:40Z,"This will not work with your 360 controller. You can turn it on in the options and scroll the menu but you can't start the game.

Just a heads up."

,SSJASON,2012-10-25T22:40Z,Hey Cactus good job man. You guys made it on Steam's top selling.
,henrypym,2012-10-26T08:14Z,"Hey Jonatan! I just heard about this game from a friend today, and after watching a little gameplay on youtube I had to download it to give it a try. It's fucking awesome, I'll definitely be buying it as soon as I get paid, and I hope others here will do the same. You've made a really fun and unique game and you deserve the sales!"
,Finalflax,2012-10-26T08:28Z,"For the record, i pirated this, played it for 10 minutes, then bought it."

,noremakk,2012-10-26T09:42Z,Anybody know how to switch it to English from Russian?
,SSJASON,2012-10-26T11:13Z,@Finalflax I run it just fine on x64 Windows 8 Pro
,SSJASON,2012-10-26T11:13Z,@normakk the game is in English
,the_seer,2012-10-26T12:38Z,"Other for the record: I didn't pirate this game. Found out about it in Torrentfreak.
I think the game is great and the devs had a great attitude towards ppl here.
Already bought it on gog."
,FtheRIAA,2012-10-26T16:39Z,"@cactus69. As soon as I get some money I will try and buy your game. Not a fan of the genre, don't really think I will play it but a developer who supports people on TPB has my respect and my support."

I have them updated, doesn't work for me... no idea why."
,iTHEIF,2012-10-26T19:22Z,"Just tried again, the 360 gamepad does NOT work cactus. You can scroll the menus and back out of the game, but thats it."
,iTHEIF,2012-10-26T19:30Z,"NVM, I don't know why you tried to tell me this ""should work"". I just looked at the Steam community forums and there are over 12 pages of people complaining about controllers not working, music not working, game not working. What a shit release. THIS is why I download here first instead of just throwing my money to the wind."

There's a new patch up on GOG and Steam that takes care of some ugly bugs. If possible update the torrent and description with these links and the new build. I want anyone who plays the game to be able to enjoy it without stupid bugs that detract from the experience.

Feel free to buy it if you like the game. It would help allowing me and Dennis to make more ""big"" projects like this in the future.

Also, there's 40+ free older games on my website, but they're nowhere near as polished:

,PostTenebras,2012-10-26T22:45Z,"Well, this torrent got featured in a torrentfreak article. Expect a surge in downloads. "
,shahril,2012-10-27T03:13Z,"You make me want to cry Mr. Jonatan Soderstrom.

It's hard to believe game developer is willing to help torrent downloader, even other game company won't do that, but you just make the point !

I will try to buy it and thank for creating this awesome game !"

,henrypym,2012-10-27T20:25Z,"@yeeerk @Linkin112 ; same thing happened to me. As far as I can tell, when you do this it creates an empty file in the game's root directory just called ""xbox"". When I deleted that file it reverted back to keyboard control. Hope this helps!"

,Jamstand,2012-10-28T04:44Z,"I'll definitely be buying. It's good to see such open minded people in this crazy mixed up world.
I challenge all who download to also contribute and buy this game as well. If you can't afford it. Say thanks."
,Ign0tus,2012-10-28T05:38Z,"I'm not really interested in this game atm, but I saw the article on Torrentfreak. Otherwise I wouldn't have even heard of this. I just wanted to comment that I think it's great that cactus69 has been commenting here. Games 'will' be pirated, that's just how things work for now. If a downloader has a really negative experience with a title, they will NOT buy it for sure, and they will likely tell their friends about it. If they have a good experience, they 'may' buy it, and will likely tell their friends how cool the game is. That's my opinion on it. I think cactus69 commenting here will only help. I know I bought FO3 after downloading it. I had so many issues with Metro 2033, I deleted it and told my friends not to waste their time/money on it. Anyway, thanks cactus69 for having an open mind!"
,oogiboogi,2012-10-28T06:31Z,"cactus, thanks for making this game and supporting broke ass chumps like myself get their game on.  i may not actually buy this game but i will definitely spread the good word because i appreciate the work that you've done and your damn decent attitude.  on another note, i also can't get my xbox controller to work, even with the update."

I click through the text but when the game is supposed to start the screen just fades to black, almost like my monitor is going into screensaver mode. I can press escape and then I'll see the pause menu, but if I unpause the screen goes black again. I can click my mouse and hear game sounds, but no picture at all.

I hope more games like this is made in the future, because after this one I'll be sure to save up and buy this and many other titles of your's. "
,shitbrix,2012-10-31T13:43Z,"Great game. Very impressed. Bought it on steam. Big game developers should take lessons from Jonathan AKA cactus69 here to confront piracy. If you are friendly and helpful with the user base, there is no doubt people would buy the game."

 Warning: Back up your save.dat file FIRST.
First head to this file directory: C:Users[YOUR NAME HEREAppDataLocalVirtualStoreProgram Files (x86)Hotline Miami 
You should see a file under the name saves.dat there. Edit this file using word pad or any other this similar to that. This is where it gets a bit tricky. 
1 represents something that is unlocked. (such as a level or a mask) 0 represents something that hasn't been unlocked yet, so it is locked.
Line 1: Refers to what masks are unlocked. Order is the same as the masks appear in the selection screen.

Line 2: Refers to levels unlocked. Order is the same as normal level progession.

Line 3: Refers to weapons unlocked. Order is the same as they are unlocked normally.

Line 4: Refers to puzzle letters found. Order is unknown.

Line 5: Refers to overall score obtained. i.e. Every time you finish a level, that levels score is added to this regardless if you have done the level before.

Line 6-25: Refers to the highest rating obtained on all the levels on a scale of 0-15. Line 6 refers to the prologue, line 7 refers to chapter 1 etc etc.
Line 26-45: Refers to the highest score obtained on a level. Line 26 refers to the prologue, line 27 refers to chapter 1 etc etc.

Line 46: Indicates whether the player has solved the puzzle or not. This can be set to solved even if the player does not have all the letter pieces. 
Doing this will make your game unlock these and allow you to progress thru further! "
