"sao paulo shaking to that post-rock beat?
it seems so with the fourth release from brazil’s hurtmold.
a spellbinding release, it’s the follow-up to their split cd with the chicago trio the eternals.
scenes of interlocking urbanity provided by the band’s guitarist, mario cappi, are portrayed on the cover, not unlike sao paulo itself, beautifully packaged in a foldout card sleeve, perhaps giving an indication to the textured grooves within.
here the six-some further mine their delicate, organic, and mostly instrumental post-rock combining rock’s traditional instrumentation with clarinet, vibraphone and harmonica.
"amarelo é vermelho" ("yellow is red") features tortoise-like guitar pickings swept along by mauricio takara’s rolling and dramatic drumming, while an effect-laden trumpet gives the track a giddy dreamlike feel.
in fact, slight guitar motifs are the order of the day on this cd. "música política para maradona cantar" ("political song for maradona to sing" — gotta love those titles!) follows this formula with wistful augustus pablo melodica providing melody and then changes pace into an almost chugging little rocker.
"sova" breaks off into free jazz skronk at regular intervals while gentle electronics tap away in the background.
it would be easy to label hurtmold as the brazilian tortoise, and the guitar sound can be similar at times, but their attention to structure as well the ability to let the tracks play out and breathe gives them the freedom to insert a little jazziness into the proceedings, leaving such comparisons lacking."
