,HylianHal,2012-10-25T21:38Z,Almost forgot my disclaimer: I didn't scan/purchase any of the comics included here. Credit goes to the uploaders who posted them and the respective groups they belong to.
,trblewalkn,2012-10-25T23:20Z,Awesome Upload! Helped me fill quite a few holes! Only thing listed that I didn't see is the National Comics issues

,kichigaino,2012-10-28T01:55Z,"I'm downloading this to my seedbox, so I'll seed for as long as the torrent is popular, but I'm stuck at 80%. We need more people to seed. :/"
,thebigswampthing,2012-10-28T02:52Z,Stuck at 79.7. FUUUUUUUUUUUU- depressed
,thebigswampthing,2012-10-28T03:10Z,"seed please, i need these. lol rhymes "
,MrPilotM,2012-10-28T12:03Z,"@HylianHal

Please seed or anyone who has got the complete set. I know I'm not the only one who is stuck at 81.6%...and I know I'm not the only one who will seed for long after it has completed. So please help us. Thanks"
,dpsleepk3,2012-10-29T00:41Z,why does it stop at 79%
,Smarmycat,2012-10-29T19:53Z,Stuck at 92%... I can almost taste it.
,Fred1383McG,2012-10-30T07:02Z,93.6% Will seed for quite sometime at my max upload speed.
,g3tpwn3d,2012-10-30T07:28Z,stuck at 93.7%  let's get some seeds please
,Najadorel,2012-10-30T18:36Z,stuck at 94.6% any full seed will be rly good

,addi333,2012-10-31T09:06Z,"stuck at 87%, seeding the whole time. come on ppl!"
,rockgod666,2012-10-31T21:19Z,It'll never work
,shmooel,2012-11-01T08:11Z,Any chance this is gonna get some seeds? Stuck @ 99.4%
,HylianHal,2012-11-02T01:13Z,"Sorry for the lack of seeding from my end, everyone. I lost my house this week, and had to get rid of my laptop, but I'm looking into a new place closer to my work, and a more permanent computer situation simultaneously- will be able to seed constantly within the next few weeks. 

You few who are hanging on, keep it up; I still have the original torrent on backup, and will rejoin you as soon as I can."
,Skormm,2012-11-02T04:40Z,"since there are so many leechers and not a lot of seeders, we really ought to coordinate this. for example, if you're at anywhere under 95%, you should stop leeching for a while so those people above that can finish quickly and seed."
,shmooel,2012-11-02T05:28Z,sitting @ 99.7% with an infinite ETA.... argggg.
,Mr.Heller,2012-11-03T05:27Z,"If everyone else is in the same boat, once you get to 99.74%, all thats remaining will be ""I, Vampire"" #'s 9 & 13. Perhaps just get them somewhere else...? I'll keep seeding what I have."
,thestubbz,2012-11-03T06:44Z,"try this on for size

,Capt-lock,2012-11-10T13:42Z,"Anyone have a little sympathy for HylianHal???!! Just lost his house, has the good faith to get on to telll us all and says he will try to be back as quick as he can..... quit whining about how you have to wait for the rest of the torrent, you still have a house!

@HylianHal - Thank you for your efforts, some of us out here appreciate them."
,MAVERICK900,2012-11-11T12:36Z,More seeders please if this gets to 100 percent ill seed it myself for a while
,HylianHal,2012-11-15T16:36Z,"Alright guys, finally getting back on my feet since I've got my first paychecks coming in from my new job, and I should have this up and seeding again within the week. 

 @Capt-lock
Thanks for your kind words man, it means a lot. 

I haven't had the best of months, guys, but hopefully I'll be able to pull through this and get you lot your sorely-needed comics fix!

HAIL!"
