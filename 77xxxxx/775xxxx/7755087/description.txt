NOTES:

Hats off to showtime and Jiinx for some nice video and audio ;-)
Video is nice,slightly cropped on the right like stated in showtimes nfo...Also there is a black
border coming in from the left now and again,but only last for secs at a time.
If honest not alot needed doing to the video ...just more of slight tweaks for personal taste.
Audio is some nice line ....slight hiss in the background and lacked a little bass i thought...but really
good all the same.


WORKDONE:

Right took the video and first thing was i used a HQ smoother on a widespread but balance it right to maintain
the sharpness aswell as removing some slight noise.From there i slightly tweaked the rgb colours...only like + or -
2-3 here and there ....also resized it to the nearest mod 16.
Slightly increased the contrast and brightness,used the intes to lower some of the glare and also lowered the sat down.

Audio dropped in AA balanced the channels and then changes the EQ bands to increase the bass,lower the band that contain 
the hiss etc....before resaving as mp3.

Now i opted to cut the custom intro so its just the film only ...so had to offset the audio aswell.
Also just so you know all the releases of this film are from showtime ( at the point of writing this ) and yes runtimes are
different on several releases,but have grabbed and checked and only reason for this is the custom intros added....
So yes lower runtime on this release BUT nothing missing video wise :)

Enjoy folks :)
