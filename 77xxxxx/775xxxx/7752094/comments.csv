,n944la,2012-10-24T04:49Z,"Hi guys

I have this downloaded okay, however, I was wondering which 'crack' I should be looking to download for this. 

I have seen a few out there with versions approaching x.x.3 & 4 and I was told those were not even out yet. 

Could someone post a link to the proper file please. 

Thank you very much

Tim"
