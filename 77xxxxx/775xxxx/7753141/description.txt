The quest for the Keys of Heaven continues, and Mercy discovers once again that the plots hatched in Heaven and Hell are far more warped and dangerous than she could imagine - and the part she's been assigned in those crazed, universe-obliterating schemes is twisted in ways even a Devil Girl would never think possible!
