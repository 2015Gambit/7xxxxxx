,Maher90,2012-10-24T22:54Z,umm..from what i know there is no any released new beta updates..this could be fake
,buffybill,2012-10-25T01:48Z,"I'm happy to say your wrong Maher90  and should do a little more research before posting. This is infact the latest beta release for Skyrim, and as stated was cracked by DMN32 at the cs.rin site.


Bug Fixes:

- General memory and stability improvements
- Fixed rare crash when using vampiric grip
- Fixed issue where Arnleif and Sons Trading Company could become permanently locked
- Fixed issue related to duplicate NPCs
- Fixed rare issue where exterior door would not open properly"
,terjitt,2012-10-25T02:51Z,It would be nice if a patch would come out addressing the issue where vampire lord form cannot land.   Also the fact that vampire lord has no powers and is floating when you first transform.  It doesn't happen on everyones game but it is on mine and several other people.  Waiting for info on the Bethesda thread.

,sylosis2ndcd,2012-10-30T21:23Z,Does this update cover all the other updates/patches? Or do I have to install them all first in order and then this one?
