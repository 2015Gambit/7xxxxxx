,DaltonMo,2012-10-26T11:56Z,"Even after changing the System Locale, there˙s error when running .exe, on WIN 7. game want start.

On Windows 7, click the Start button

Restart your PC and try running Deadlight
If that doesn’t work, try using the Windows Compatibility Mode feature:

In Windows 7 right-click the Deadlight exe file, go to the ‘Compatibility Mode’ tab and check ‘Disable Desktop Composition’."

,blz0,2012-10-28T20:49Z,@klord2010: you should write 1033 BinariesWin32LOTDGame.exe instead of 1033 LOTDGame.exe
,Ryzoz,2012-10-28T22:26Z,"I love this type of game. As some others have said, if you like Limbo, you will probably like this.

The torrent works, use winrar, then install the ISO like normal. Works great in Windows 7 64"

Other than that, thanks for the up!"
,ClwnHater,2012-11-05T02:57Z,For anyone with problems installing. Do you have WINRAR...For some odd reason winrar will not extract all of these files at once. I had this very same problem. My fix was to uninstall winrar and use 7zip instead...Highlight flt 001 extract files. worked flwlessy after that. Thank You FLT 
,AznAssassin,2012-11-10T02:14Z,"@cullenforever 
no shit sherlock. Of course its the PC version. I dont thnk u can 'mount' images on the 360 can u? "
,weedo420,2012-11-15T08:22Z,"To install this upload:

Download 7zip
Install and run
Find dlt-delt.001
click add and it will compile files
copy completed file to deadlight folder
there is your ISO
mount and install
good to play"
,rBread,2012-11-18T23:04Z,"I didn't use 7zip, so for those with Winrar and don't want to install 7zip, I did this:

1. Open folder (for some reason, it was just a regular folder.)
2. LEFT click ftl-delt.001 and make it so it opens with winrar. (It didn't automatically associate with winrar.)
3. Open the newly ftl-delt.rar and the iso should be there.
4. Click iso, and the Setup.exe should pop up!

I don't know if it was like this for others, so hopefully this helps out someone!

:)"
,therealtd_619,2012-11-19T11:17Z,rBread's technique works...thx dude
