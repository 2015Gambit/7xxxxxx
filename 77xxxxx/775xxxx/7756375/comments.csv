Was wondering if you're still getting Mule SBDS (I can't remember my old username we've talked before) anywho I missed the Ithaca NY show and it was amazing. any chance you have that or the Mountain Jam sets? I love being able to throw those on for people to get them to go to Mountain jam with me! You're the man, man."

Then I was picking up the FLAC tracks on Demoniod but then they went down :-(

I have been missing the tracks myself----I have confidence that a 'new' source will energe soon and when it does I will share once again :-)

till then ... keep on rockin ~~~~~ peace"
