,chrede2750,2012-10-23T20:49Z,"Ehm

,zhiad,2012-10-23T21:09Z,"Work, Thanks !!"
,mandruf,2012-10-24T01:50Z,"Chede > No you stupid piece of shit, my computer has SLI and Xtreme processor, probably destroy your piece of junk that you call ""computer"".

This crack just doesn't work, the game still crashes straight after the car level. Shut the fuck up and play up to that point to see for yourself before opening your fucking mouth ok ?

Asshole."
,RMJ113,2012-10-24T01:52Z,"I took a chance, I have to confirm, I got passed the sniper finshed cut scene ,I have tried all other cracks and so called updates, I hope this works so I can finsh this crap game!

THANKS! RESPECT!"
,mandruf,2012-10-24T02:46Z,"@ RMJ, it's just after that sniper level, you'll have a pursuit level in a car, then the cut scene is about to start (you can hear the sound) and suddenly stops and stays on a black screen for ever. You need to kill the process to get out."
,GameFaqs198,2012-10-24T09:14Z,version 3 is not out guys ! FAKE !
,virtualmatrix258,2012-10-24T14:20Z,@GameFaqs198 Works better than the fake ass shit you're posting up on TPB.
,Abaris777,2012-10-24T15:11Z,@mandruf I have the same issue mate.....did u manage to solve it?
,death1223,2012-10-24T16:23Z,"Actually works, stop being faggots."
,death1223,2012-10-24T17:22Z,"And by actually works, I mean I just finished the mission where you snipe pirates. Which is way after the train bombing. The only thing that I had a problem was, was the graphics going low when the car chase happened, but I just went into options, set them as ultra and then restarted the game.
Good job, sonny."
