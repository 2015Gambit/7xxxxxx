Tonto and Lone Ranger set out to stop a deadly string of train robberies. Now, Tonto has been left for dead at the bottom of a ravine, and The Lone Ranger faces a noose at the hands of a maniacal sheriff in bizarre small town called Utopia. In short, the two greatest heroes of the old West are in a tight spot. As the epic Hard Country arc continues, Tonto must face down both death in the desert and his own, painful past as he struggles to make his way to Lone Ranger before the gallows lever is pulled.
