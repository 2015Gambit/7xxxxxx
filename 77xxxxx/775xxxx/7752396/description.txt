It's new territory and a new arc for the Lone Ranger. With Tonto gravely wounded, the Ranger seeks help from a Ute Indian Shaman. As the Ute decide whether to offer help or simply kill Lone Ranger on the spot, we begin to learn the secrets of Tonto's past. How did Tonto come to be the brave without a tribe who discovered John Reid after the Cavendish gang's ambush? All will be revealed in the Native Ground arc. Part one of six.
