,justak21,2012-10-23T12:08Z,"Apparently CD2 (Bonus Tracks) have some 100%/99.9% CDDA, but the other half has 79% MPEG (Tested through aucdtect). Is this the same? "
[V],jmz619,2012-10-23T13:57Z,I have no idea this isn't my upload i just posted the torrent on TPB
,dyt433,2012-10-24T17:30Z,Just verified with Audiochecker...Apparently some of the FLAC files are transcoded i.e. 75 % MPEG
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-10-24T22:36Z,"Dudes! ""Just verified with Audiochecker...Apparently some of the FLAC files are transcoded i.e. 75 % MPEG""
What the hell does this mean? [in practical terms]"
[V],jmz619,2012-10-24T23:36Z,It basically means that it may not be true FLAC like the original uploader may of just converted it from mp3 to FLAC who know tbh i gave it a listen and it sound fine just enjoy it.
[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-25T00:11Z,"It means it was converted from .m4a which is a pain in the ass to play and upload.
It's native to itunes and was probably converted to FLAC to give it a wider audience.
Any .m4a files i upload i ALWAYS convert to FLAC.

Hope this clears things up."

Thanks very much for taking the time to clarify this!"

Please DON'T."
,FuzzyKiwi,2012-10-29T21:10Z,"@2010kaiser

That serves no point. Flac is a compression of WAV which is supposed to be CD quality, while M4A, MP3, ect are compressed. Upsampling doesn't do anything to your files. Pointless torrent!"
,war59312,2012-11-05T22:50Z,"Like others have said it is basically ""Fake"".

No thanks!"
