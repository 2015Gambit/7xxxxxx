,matt.elder1971,2012-10-24T21:05Z,Am I the only one scratching their heads trying to figure out the meaning of the title?
,5-click,2012-10-24T21:46Z,"@matt: Yes, of course. But not all people of the world are speaking the english language as native. Ich kĂśnnte dir auch auf deutsch Antworten, dann wĂźrdest du dich sicher wundern. As you see, you're not alone. I wish you all good."
