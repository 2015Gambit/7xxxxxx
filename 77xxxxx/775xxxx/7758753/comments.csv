,gino1965,2012-10-31T19:01Z,"Thank you so much mrehabaly. With the repack of the game and this files it's working normal for me. Everything in English now.

I did the mod of the .reg file exactly as you wrote in the repack torrent. I see that here is not complete, so I will post it here again just to make sure everybody do it right.

So, after doing everything for unraring and copying the files from this torrent, the next procedure has to be done as last step: 
.......................................................................
How to change

Open notepad and paste the below lines

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREDanger Close GamesMedal of Honor Warfighter]
 ""GDFBinary""=""C:GamesMedal of Honor WarfighterGDFBinary_ru_RU.dll""
 ""Locale""=""ru_RU""
 ""Install Dir""=""C:GamesMedal of Honor Warfighter""

 ""GDFBinary""=""C:GamesMedal of Honor WarfighterGDFBinary_ru_RU.dll""
 ""Locale""=""ru_RU""

Change GDFBinary dll name & path, Locale, Dir path
 Save as warfighter.reg
 Run the reg file

Same for other languages..

,theaznkid92,2012-11-05T19:33Z,"Lmao. Trashing a respected uploader. Not to mention, I'm surprised you can understand the English release considering your obvious lack of mastery over it. And your shameless trashing of other releases in order to promote yours is obnoxious as well. -1 all please :D"
