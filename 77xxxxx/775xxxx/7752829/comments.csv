,adc240483,2012-10-25T00:18Z,"I can't seem to get this to install correctly. Could you please explain what you mean in step 2.  X5-patch (x86/x64) (restore backup from original patch before using this)?

Thanks!"
,adc240483,2012-10-25T00:41Z,I figured it out. Thanks so much!!!!! :)
,bigpr,2012-10-25T13:58Z,"can't run the patch on win xp 32 nor 64bit, only on Windows 7 64bit. is there a special release of this patch for XP?"
,proben2012,2012-10-25T19:36Z,"Hey I can't get this to install, I have windows 7 64Bit I get the following error;
An error occurred during the installation of assembly""Microsoft.vc90.OpenMP,Version=""9.0.30729.4148"",PublicKeyToken=""1fc8b3b9a1e18eb"",ProcessorArchitecture=""amd64"",type=""win32"".please refer to help and Support for more info. HRESULT: 0x8007041D"
,bradster1000,2012-10-26T04:59Z,@proben2012 Did you try running as administrator if that doesn't work try compatibility mode. If its still not that it can be a hardware problem
,tartilla,2012-10-27T23:48Z,"Having issues.  When trying step 1 Install, asks for key. Can't proceed past that.

Thanks"
,erica7017,2012-10-28T02:15Z,"Is this the actual program or just an update? This is probably a rediculous question...but Im brand new to torrents.  I downloaded it, but cant open any files....Im assuming because I dont have the complete program :/"
,dawglaw21,2012-10-29T08:06Z,"I'm sorry to ask such a dumbquestion, but could you please explain a bit more on how to install-especially #2."
,dawglaw21,2012-10-29T20:57Z,"In regards to #2, What ""backup"" are youtalking about?  Wheredo you ""restore"" this from?  Where is the ""original patch?"""
,dickybyrd75,2012-10-31T02:10Z,"PLEASE!! I've seen the same freaking instructions a couple different places. WTF does step # 2 mean???    I really do know what I'm doing, just not on this one. "
,dickybyrd75,2012-10-31T02:15Z,"For the record, it seems to install the program in a similar easy manner to X3. There seems to be just the step #2 issue.  Have been looking for this crap forever. Had some BS X4 downloads and am very hopeful."
,bradster1000,2012-10-31T21:08Z,Step 2: Extract and Run the crack as Administrator  locate your installation folder example:C:Program FilesChief ArchitectChief Architect Premier X5 open the only exe file that is there (Chief Architect Premier X5.exe) should be at the bottom and patch. That's it. Also discard step 2
,dickybyrd75,2012-10-31T23:23Z,"THANK YOU!!!
I actually tried the same, just not ""Run As Admin""
It seems very similar to the older versions where you just replace the .exe with the one they provide.
RUNS!!
Also, to import the library I :  Library->  Import ->  (navigate to ""Core Libraries""  select all, enter)

Here is to hoping this version doesn't crap out every 5.   Sweeeeeet!"
,igtj,2012-11-04T03:38Z,"Hello, there is no .exe file after download can you help?"
,Invader01,2012-11-04T06:49Z,When I run the patch it say not valid win32 application. Any way fix this? Thanks.
,bradster1000,2012-11-05T03:16Z,"@igtj
If you actually read the my note you would know what to do! extract with 7zip"
,Invader01,2012-11-05T07:24Z,"Thanks for sharing. As I did read all your notes as illustrated below; the x5-patch continues to return (not a valid win32 application). I am using 7Zip 9.20 and running as administrator.

Your notes with the download:

USE LATEST VERSION OF 7ZIP TO EXTRACT!

1.Install 

2.X5-patch (x86/x64) (restore backup from original patch before using this)

3.Import Core Libraries after installation by opening each one.

(NOTE)It should open Cheif Arc and import by them selves once clicked on if not use cheif Arc under ""open with""

Core Libraries Referenced Files is images of what comes in the core libraries in other words a preview.

Your notes as posted:

Step 2: Extract and Run the crack as Administrator locate your installation folder example:C:Program FilesChief ArchitectChief Architect Premier X5 open the only exe file that is there (Chief Architect Premier X5.exe) should be at the bottom and patch. That's it. Also discard step 2 

If you know of anyother reason would be appreciated.

Thanks."
,thimzzdad,2012-11-05T08:42Z,"I'm having the same problem as  Invader01  

When I run the patch it says not valid win32 application.  I'm using Windows xp.

The program extracts and installs fine, but as soon as I run it , it asks for a registration key."
,thimzzdad,2012-11-06T12:49Z,"its ok I found another patch which works http://rghost.net/41248719

thanks bradster for the upload :)"
,Invader01,2012-11-07T09:11Z,"Thanks Bradster1000 for the upload.
Thanks Thimzzdad for link to the patch. Everything works great now."
,MATesla,2012-11-10T04:49Z,"Thanks a lot bradster1000, will try it. I already have X5 with a patch that let me open X5 but closes the program after about 15 mins, over and over again. Will try this one, I hope it is better."
,ClericMat,2012-11-17T09:15Z,Thanks bradster1000 appreciate your upload. 
,bradster1000,2012-11-21T05:50Z,Windows XP users sorry you are out of luck :/ patch does not work according to some comments. I have not confirmed this myself so if you are on xp and it works write a comment.
,tru_2_ublue,2012-11-25T05:58Z,"to solve most problems:
Step 1: download newest version of 7zip
Step 2: extract x86 or x64 using 7zip (depending on single or multiple core processors)
Step 3: extract patch using 7zip
Step 4: install x86 or x64 (again depending on processors)
Step 5: run patch. redirect the patch to the install folder locating the exeapplication file.
Step 6: Import Core Libraries after installation by opening each one.
Step 7: Enjoy!!

:) hope this helps :)"
