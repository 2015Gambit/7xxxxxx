,Switchak,2012-10-23T14:01Z,@bobomsin its awseome game..I have original copy..but im waiting for DLCs cause theyre fkin expensive. Hope someone will upload them
,medalcue,2012-10-23T14:33Z,"@vladguy
Yes it comes with the guitar. Theres a link in the torrent to download and print the guitar. Works perfectly."
,starstrid,2012-10-23T14:37Z,does this include pre-purchase DLCs like a Heavy Metal Gear?
,9mmninja,2012-10-23T16:42Z,"@medalcue

,chiphead,2012-10-23T22:05Z,"For those who don't have the cable, check out this comment from the crack torrent:

piratefrs at 2012-10-23 01:52 CET:
i've added one fix made by Sadler2, i am not sure if it will help ppl with problems with my exe, but still, here it is:
bayfiles . com / file / oOoH / 4sjK7g / RocksmithNoCable3DevCapFix.7z

i tested it on my pc, and like the other one it worked just fine.
if it dont work, then i have no idea what may be causing that error.
btw, this exe is the same as this release, but modified with a cable bypass."
,fellipepv,2012-10-24T03:56Z,Do I really need the cable? I mean i can't plug the guitar in the line in or mic ?
,seaboundrhino813,2012-10-24T04:15Z,"It worked!!!! key word, worked, I've played for an hour or so doing two venues and then it didn't respond, and now ever time I try starting it up, it'll get past all the title screens then crash to desktop"
,waterl00,2012-10-24T04:16Z,"This is opening to a white window then I get the message ""Rocksmith.exe has stopped working""... is this an issue with windows 7 64 bit, or an issue with my having steam installed?"

,FredWedge,2012-10-24T11:37Z,"Hey, it works perfectly, i still going to get a cable...the only problem is that the intro screen, the ubisoft logo, etc. doesnt play any sound and only loads when it's minimized, and in the profile menu, it doesnt play any sound at all, really want it to work when i get my cable! thanks!"
,FredWedge,2012-10-24T11:39Z,"C'mon, i need help, to get the sound to work! please..."
,Phil2003,2012-10-24T14:02Z,You need to adapt settings in the rocksmith.ini!
,gtei,2012-10-24T18:06Z,"@ Waterl00 @ Rzeractor
For Windows 7 64bit:Try to run it as administrator. It worked perfectly for me. :D"
,JimmyJames1992,2012-10-24T18:15Z,"White screen, ""rocksmith.exe has stopped working"".
Any ideas? 
Thanks very much for the up though. 
I bought the xbox version, might have to drop the $37 at amazon for the pc version though if I can't get this to work. Tough to justify buying all the dlc again though. "
,JimmyJames1992,2012-10-24T19:52Z,@gtei Run as admin worked like a champ! Working perfectly. Thanks again to all. 
,waterl00,2012-10-24T20:46Z,"""run as admin"" fixes the white screen issue, and the  ""RocksmithNoCable3DevCapFix"" crack lets me use my M-Audio Fasttrack Ultra interface, so thanks to everyone for those tips.

Interface latency still seems to be giving me trouble... I see the option to compensate for visual latency, but I need to compensate for interface latency... any ideas?"
,azoo134,2012-10-24T22:55Z,Thanks for the upload! Can you possibly upload the dlc as well? thanks in advance!

,Rzeractor,2012-10-25T05:12Z,"Phil2003 was on the money. For those having 'freezing' issues at the intro, play around with the rocksmith ini, more specifically, the buffer size and forcewdm."
,Rzeractor,2012-10-25T05:17Z,"Edit: here are my audio settings in rocksmith.ini that made it work:

,Flamuri,2012-10-25T13:50Z,It Works! stfu bitches learn to install!

,vatney94,2012-10-26T02:00Z,worked perfectly but can someone please upload the dlc it would be greatly appreciated.
,vctrt,2012-10-26T09:21Z,"After installation the game wouldn't start, it got stuck with black screen. To fix I changed the MaxOutputBufferSize to 0 (i.e. MaxOutputBufferSize=0) and voila! Game works perfectly! Can't wait to get the cable.
Thank you Hero, you are a master ;-)"
,Phil2003,2012-10-26T22:45Z,Still waiting for the DLC's.
,starstrid,2012-10-26T23:55Z,can somebody upload pre-purchase DLCs?
,maf08d,2012-10-26T23:56Z,Works great! Please upload DLC's. Thanks!
,Piratechnix,2012-10-27T00:20Z,Got the cable for this today ...works great ..... what a cool game for a beginner....
,Scyrthis,2012-10-27T13:32Z,Why even bother downloading tis when you stil need the required cable the game comes with?
,TheRoko121,2012-10-27T13:58Z,U don't need the cable http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7748964/Rocksmith_Crack_%28By_Themperror_and_Sam2k8%29_CRACK_ONLY here in the comment section is a no-cable crack
,ChocoboDreams,2012-10-27T20:30Z,"Not everyone needs the cable either. I have the game already for PS3, and it seems that's the case for a lot of people. I'm getting this for both the free Bass DLC already installed, and the potential for the rest of the DLC uploads, -and- mods. Even if I didn't have the cable already, it'd be worth it to buy one just for those reasons alone."
,Aerionix,2012-10-28T05:56Z,"yep.  Have it for xbox and just eventually found it a pain to get the disc out, fire up the console, deal with the load times, etc.  Pc version solves every issue I've had with the game.  Had it come out at the beginning, it would have been my version of choice, instead of wasting a good $150 on dlc for the xbox.  Guess that won't be an issue now that dlc is being uploaded, thanks again to Themperror for starting the ball rolling."
,roadkill123,2012-10-28T15:12Z,does anyone know where your profile is save to in this game. have reformat

,Leonof,2012-10-30T03:30Z,"hey, im having a little trouble with getting this to work.  i installed and copied everything from the crack over to the file but when i start up it says Appid not configured and then boots up to black.  any solutions?"
,roytheflame,2012-10-30T04:28Z,A mac version would be nice =P. I can't wait for the avenged sevenfold dlc tomorrow.
,Demonsthere,2012-10-31T09:03Z,Every time I play I get the crack (NoCableNew) crashed and a white screen both using this and the Theemperors version. What can I do to fix that ? 
,Hidengrey,2012-11-01T01:27Z,"Works like a charm!

Using Win 7 64bits and Xbox cable.

Thanks +1!"
,gtei,2012-11-02T02:05Z,"After a few minutes of gameplay, my PC simply shuts down. Wtf, srsly. Does anybody else have the same problem as I?"
,Nakorentreri,2012-11-02T14:15Z,"Hi everyone ^^ ive installed hundreds of cracked games and ive never had the probs im having with this game... cant get it to work without doing it in '' Run as administrator"" mode wich is weird since its the only game that needs that. Also once in it still wont work correctly. I tried editing the .ini file but that also wont let me do it saying acess denied when i try to save the edited file. This is really weird. I got win 7 64bits with the xbox cable. Id luv some suggestions ^^ and id luv to play this game...thx everyone"
,Xpl0siv,2012-11-03T12:24Z,"Did anyone found a solution for the white screen at the start of the game and ""Rocksmith has stopped working"" problem( well, let's call it black/white screen, when you turn on the game with adm rights, the R loading sign appears, but then still white screen appears)? I know it's not me only, and many more people have it, i've searched thru countless solutions, but none of them work( adm rights, changing regedit), i know it's not graphics related cause videodump was all success, so gotta be something else.  I would love a constructive comment or a solution( even better ;) ), i'd like to give that thing a try, been waiting quite some time for it."
,foggy231,2012-11-04T05:16Z,Can anyone tell me where the profile save is located?  I am trying to copy my save from my computer to my laptop.
,guile78,2012-11-04T16:57Z,"My solution for the white screen at the start of the game with win7: edit rocksmith.ini and change
MaxOutputBufferSize=0

Probably you must edit as administrator, and save de ini file.
Then ""run as administrator"" the Rocksmith.exe."
