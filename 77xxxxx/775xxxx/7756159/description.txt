Eight months after the storyline chronicled in the BANZAI GIRL manga trade, Jinky Coronado and Michelle have become bona fide popstars! Their new CD is out, and they're touring the world - but all is not well at home. A massive, hairy creature known as the Kapre` has been spotted in the woods...and kids inciting its wrath are disappearing. Katie J is all grown up and has plans to take on the hirsute Kapre` by herself. Plus: Jinky Coronado returns to school and has a special secret admirer, and it's NOT the class lech. Is he...something more? It's all-out action, fabulous fights, pleated skirts, and everyone's favorite Asian schoolgirl back in action.
