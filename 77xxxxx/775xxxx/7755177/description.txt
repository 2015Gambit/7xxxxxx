Megabyte Punch is an electro beat-'em-up/platforming/fighting game in which you build your own fighter!

Every creature in the game is made of separate parts. Parts have their own powers and bonuses (like gun arms for a shoot ability) and you can attach them to yourself freely. You travel through different environments, search for hidden parts and battle other creatures for theirs. This is the adventure mode. Then there is the fight mode. Here you can fight other players in a destructible arena with the abilities your customized creature gives you.

The game takes place in an computer world filled with creatures called Megac. As a young Megac, you fight to enter the Grand Tournament, the biggest fighting competition there is, to compete for the title of strongest of the world!
