The Manga Guide to is a series of books which adopts the manga format to liven up and explain the  'inanimate',vague and at times plain over the head concepts of  topics such as relativity and molecular biology. Although not a substitute for a textbook it fulfills two very important things-seeding an interest for the subject in the student's mind and making him attempt (and delve further into) the seemingly impenetrable shell of science.
