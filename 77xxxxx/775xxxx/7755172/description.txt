Troubling and extreme events in her life soon cause Helen to flee her homeland for Florence, Italy where she meets up with her friend Sylvia who works as a maid for a wealthy family. She soon learns that her boyfriend in Albania has been arrested for killing her cruel father. Though at first desperate to return home to help, Helen soon forgets her boyfriend’s plight as she is seduced into a wicked life of vice and perversion by the wealthy family with whom she is staying. Helen finds herself spinning out of control in a frenzied cinematic vortex of sex, drugs and manipulation.
