When Shade Silverwing breaks an age-old law, looking at the sun, the owls burn down his beloved Tree Haven. They go to Hibernaculum where they rest for the winter. Along the way, he meets Marina Brightwing who helps him throughout the series. They also meet other characters like Goth and Throbb, bats who are part of the Vampyrum Spectrum, Zephyr, a bat that can see past, present and future, and Scirocco, a bat who wants to be Human.

CHARACTERS
.
Shade
Shade Silverwing is a nerd, and often mocked by his peers, who take pride in their size and strength. He does not know of his father, but has heard many great stories about him from his mother and the rest of the colony. He is na√Øve to the dangerous world around him, where owls rule the skies, and he is dared to look at the sun - which in their world is forbidden - without much idea about the consequences. This starts off a chain of events, which test both his loyalty and strength to the fellow bats. He is the main protagonist of the series, and saves his colony more than once, and slowly rises in the ranks to become the respected Silverwing he always wanted to be. In 'Firewing', he plays the father role and appears briefly in the main plot until about half way through.
.
.
Marina
Marina Brightwing (an Eastern Red Bat) is Shade's closest friend and companion. She is one year older and therefore wiser than Shade. Because she has a tracking band, she was banished from her colony and went to live on an island.
In the first book, Shade and her meet one night during Shade's migration. Shade goes off track and starts to end up over the ocean. He clings to the sail of a boat and reaches an island. There he is greeted by Marina. She is of great help to him, even if he found her mildly annoying. In the second book, Shade claims Marina as his mate. In Firewing, her role is much more minor compared to the other two books in the series; she briefly appears in the beginning and is only mentioned in the ending.
Her name comes from Marine, meaning "of the sea".
.
.
Goth
A cannibal bat, prince to the Vampyrum spectrum, is deceptive and cunning. He was taken from his home in the jungles by humans, and seeks to return home, he and his trusty sidekick Throbb. His carnivorous nature makes him eat many kinds of animals, including birds, enraging the owls against Shade. In the first book, Goth and another carnivorous bat, Throbb, are captured by scientists. They escape, meet Shade and Marina, and plot to follow them to the Silverwings' hibernaculum, where they could spend the winter devouring the entire colony. In the end, Goth was badly wounded and Throbb killed by a bolt of lightning. The demon-god Cama Zotz healed Goth and made him King of the Vampyrum Spectrum, but Goth was killed when the high priest Voxzaco, dropped a powerful explosive device on the temple in an attempt to sacrifice everyone to resurrect Cama Zotz. He later reappeared in the Underworld in Firewing, attempting to take Griffin's life as his own and give Shade's life to Zotz. He again failed, but was reborn and went to the Upperworld to restart worship of Zotz.
His name comes from the English word Gothic.
.
.
Griffin
Shade and Marina's son, and therefore a Silverwing/Brightwing hybrid. He hates the idea that he is nothing like his father, although he knows it. He is constantly worrying over anything and everything and looks for the worst in any situation. He became a hero, like his father. After Goth absorbed his life, he borrowed Shade's life, and was therefore "reborn". He gains confidence throughout his adventure in the book series.
His name comes from griffin, a blend between two animals: an eagle and a lion. A fitting name for a hybrid bat (though he doesn't think so).
