[V],Nepotu,2012-10-22T14:03Z,...welcome!
[V],Nepotu,2012-10-22T15:32Z,"When I try to UL something, TPB gives an error. It can't upload nothing. Sorry guyz! Not my fault."
,urthpainter,2012-10-22T19:08Z,any guess why u cant ul?  Dying to watch the titans bills game.  just an error?
[V],Nepotu,2012-10-22T19:58Z,"Watch here why: ""I'm having trouble uploading and am just wondering is the problem at my end.
When i try to upload i'm getting the error that my image should be an 8 digit once and the code i'm entering is too long.

I've tried re-entering the code. Omitting the code etc and TPB is still returning with the same error.

Also, the normal window for entering your picture code is no longer there instead there is just the window for enter the description i.e. separate words by a comma input box."""
,saints007,2012-10-22T23:50Z,how about the saints TB game?
,hurzz,2012-10-23T02:15Z,Thanks. Can you post the 540p versions?
,clay1111,2012-10-23T07:12Z,Have you tried not adding the image?
,urthpainter,2012-10-23T07:30Z,"well, as you have probably noticed - others are continuing to upload without problems.  I somehow doubt a conspiracy, but I will admit, you seem to be alone in regular posting of these specific events. GL solving this problem - could there be something tied to the original signal ie new copy protection?"
[V],Nepotu,2012-10-23T07:47Z,"Yes, bro, I tried! Same error. Now TPB fixed (without image) this problem."
