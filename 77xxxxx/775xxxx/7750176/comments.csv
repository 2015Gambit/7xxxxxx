,divest,2012-10-22T04:29Z,4gigs for an episode eh? Some people will download anything.
,ziggyff,2012-10-22T04:48Z,I get suspicious when I see a 4.3 GB TV show download ?? and a comment is missing... has anybody finished the download and checked it?
,2HardRain,2012-10-22T05:03Z,pink skull=trusted. If you love the show and have decent d/l speed then it should be worth it!
,Lethal234,2012-10-22T05:19Z,"This is 1080I torrent, not 720p like the rest of the walking dead torrents. So obviously its going to be bigger as its 1080i, 5.1 sound. Come on common sense...

Quality is amazing, I'm watching it right now"
,ziggyff,2012-10-22T06:11Z,"Good,  those are the comments I wanted to hear(or rather see)..I had never seen a TS file for this series before..i'll keep d'loading"
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-22T07:35Z,"@ziggyff 
Enjoy your first .TS file. You'll be in awe."
,Wawelet,2012-10-22T08:34Z,"All these 1080i are excessively appreciated,Secludedly.Grateful thanks.
Fellows,this is top-notch quality so please open the tap 'cause I want to watch them this evening..."
,kiwij,2012-10-22T11:48Z,Thanks for uploading the raw uncompressed HDTV video.  This is the best quality version as everyone else will start with a 1080i .TS HDTV recording  then convert it to 720P rips.
,kiwij,2012-10-22T11:49Z,Personally I'm waiting for DibyaTPB's link for the WEB-DL version :D
,lamole234,2012-10-22T21:25Z,TS extension is =mpeg? 
,kiwij,2012-10-23T00:51Z,WEB-DL 1080P version now available if this file is too big - http://publichd.eu/index.php?page=torrent-details&id=cbcf22b26fee7be57e42d7821a703f8db7b15380
,GarnietheCarnie,2012-10-26T04:07Z,4.33 gigs ... if you playing games for the graphics you are a dispicable human being >.<     DL the smaller one and watch it sooner also!
,ziggyff,2012-10-26T09:14Z,I just wanted to provide update on earlier comment...TS file is magnificent to watch but does tax my little system..had to stop everything else from running but worth it..thanks mucho
