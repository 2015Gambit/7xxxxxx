Argue with a Tree... is the first live CD/DVD by Blue October, and their fourth CD overall. The title of the album is a lyric in the song "Weight of the World". The album was recorded live on June 4, 2004, at Lakewood Theater in Dallas, Texas, and released as a double CD and DVD in the United States in 2004 by Brando/Universal Records. The set includes live versions of songs from all of Blue October's studio albums, as well as the unreleased track "PRN." It is the only Blue October release to feature bass guitarist Piper Skih.
The DVD was recorded at the historic Lakewood Theatre in Dallas, Texas. "Argue With A Tree" covers a unique performance that features all major songs from the band's first three albums "The Answers", "Consent To Treatment" and "History For Sale". Blue October completely sold out their November 2011 UK shows weeks in advance and now singer Justin Furstenfeld played several acoustic shows in Europe.

If you missed Blue October live, you now have the chance to witness the unique live experience on DVD. "Argue With A Tree" includes over 2 hours of concert footage, music videos and over 70 minutes of Behind The Scenes features.
