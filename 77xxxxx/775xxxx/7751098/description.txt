Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most highly acclaimed anime series of all time.

This release, based on the 2003 "Renewal" DVD version, contains all 26 episodes; four of the them in Extended Director's Cut format.

In addition, you also get Death(True)2, basically a recap of the first 24 eps in 84 minutes, and more importantly, "End of Evangelion", the alternate/complimentary ending to the series!

This release is in Japanese with English (Soft) Subtitles. Subtitles are on by default.

Not my encode, BUT, this release looks great, and is a LOT better looking than the shitty zx encode everyone keeps getting. Only thing missing is the English dub. I don't miss it, but it is missing never the less.
