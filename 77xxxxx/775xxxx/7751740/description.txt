This is the Ben Affleck version of the movie Argo 2012. It is the most decent print I found so far. I kept downloading shit for the past week, mostly broken links n password protected rar files.

Since I found this one and I went thru a lot to get it, I realized there would be many like me out there and decided to upload it.

I dint watch the entire move only went thru bits and pieces, but from what I see: A:9, V:8 for a CAM print.. and I heard M:9.

Feel free to post otherwise.

Enjoy!
