All the Games are clean except maybe Counter-Strike Source(Only Background), However I've provided original Background of it. If you cannot play online on servers like it tells you are using an older version of the game, then download the updater of it from torrent (Maybe from here you can find the update:http://thepiratebay.se/user/bruss.aka.durka9/).

Please Play the maps "Race Course Park" (map pack, only 5 to 6 map) for Counter-Strike 1.6 or Condition Zero (Not Source). These are very good maps, These re made by me. Just play it and enjoy!


This is maybe the best Counter-Strike torrent.
