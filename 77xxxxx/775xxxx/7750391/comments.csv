,Penurian,2012-10-22T12:41Z,"come on people, seed please :)"
,pirate_share_the_love,2012-10-22T13:23Z,"oh my bad, luvtpb123 said .mkv. 

Anyone else had it where they download torrents as files only. Without any file extention? This has been happening to me lots even though my client is kept up to date. I added .mkv and it worked fine though.

Thanks for the upload."
,amans,2012-10-22T15:05Z,"Seed you ungrateful pirates, dont throttle your upload bandwith during downloading. Whats wrong with todays pirate community?"
