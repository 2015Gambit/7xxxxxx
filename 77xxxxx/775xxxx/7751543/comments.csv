,Sicko666,2012-10-23T11:41Z,I Use The SD Media Launcher And The Homebrew Program Swiss To Launch Either Off The SD Gecko Or DVD
,tonytiger01,2012-10-26T19:13Z,"You can put gamecube and Wii games on the same usb hardrive. Just make sure to format the drive to fat32. you can use Easeus Partition Master Home Edition (get it from CNET.COM) and format ANY SIZE drive to fat 32. I am using a 750gb drive. Then make a folder on the drive that says ""Games"" and put the GC isos in it. Then make another folder n the same drive and name it ""WBFS"" and put your wii games in it. Then run Configurable USB Loader and point it to the usb drive. Try to download the latest CFG = cfg70MODr48.dol   it works beautifully!"
,tonytiger01,2012-10-26T19:18Z,I forgot to mention that you need to install dios Mios Lite and then you can play both gamecube and wii off the same usb drive if you format and set up the drive the way I said.
