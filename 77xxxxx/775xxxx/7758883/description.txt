Memphis Belle [1990]

The "Memphis Belle" is a World War II bomber, piloted by a young crew on
dangerous bombing raids into Europe. The crew only have to make one more
bombing raid before they have finished their duty and can go home. In the
briefing before their last flight, the crew discover that the target for the
day is Bremen, a heavily-defended town that invariably causes many Allied
casualties
