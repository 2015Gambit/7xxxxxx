Gentlemen and Scholars is a five piece rock band from Southern Indiana. They signed to Torque/Victory records in October of 2008, just a few short months after self releasing their first full length album, "The Record, the Keepsake, and the Thief." In May of 2009, Gentlemen and Scholars entered the studio to begin work on "The Fault", their sophomore album which was released via Torque/Victory records on October 27th, 2009. 

After leaving their record label in late 2010, Gentlemen and Scholars set out to record and release a new album on their own. Nearly a year of demoing, writing, blood, sweat and tears went into the making of Bad Apples. On November 26th, 2011, Gentlemen and Scholars self released "Bad Apples" for free all over the internet.
