,kaithekilla,2012-11-10T13:21Z,"Hey! do you have any possibility to upload this/theese indie playlists of yours in lossless? mp3 sounds so shitty on a decent sound system, dont get me wrong i love that you put this torrents out i really do, but i am wondering your source of this music or if its hand picked from a bunch of mp3s month by month, because you got a lot of great music here i would like to hear in lossless :) Thanx"

Appreciated."
