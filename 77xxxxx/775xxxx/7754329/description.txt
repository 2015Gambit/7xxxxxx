Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, October 23 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the prospect of riots and mayhem following the election next month as more threats against Romney are made following the "debate" last night that once again demonstrates zero difference between the candidates. 

Alex talks with author Brian Tuohy about his latest book, The Fix Is In: The Showbiz Manipulations of the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL & NASCAR, which delves into the dark underbelly of professional sports.
