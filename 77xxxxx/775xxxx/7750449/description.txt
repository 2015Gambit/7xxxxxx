"The Long Road"


In this First Season 3 action-packed one-hour special, relive the most heart pounding and heart breaking moments of the first two seasons of Gold Rush as the Hoffman crew and their rivals Parker Schnabel and Dakota Fred deal with crew fighting, equipment breakdowns and a very unforgiving Mother Nature in an attempt to get gold out of the ground in the frozen north.

Then on Friday, October 26th, gear up for the new season of Gold Rush. The night begins at 7:30PM with a Second 90 minute special (ΓÇ£Do or DieΓÇ¥) recounting what the miners did during the winter to prepare for their ΓÇ£make or breakΓÇ¥ seasons. Then at 9PM, the journey continues with the season 3 premiere of GOLD RUSH.
