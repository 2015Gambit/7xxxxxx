,sccrguy21,2012-10-23T02:24Z,What is the quality of this torrent? Someone has had to have some sort of feedback.
,LeWeez,2012-10-23T03:15Z,320kbps
,Chaps24,2012-10-23T05:58Z,"There's no feedback because there's no (i.e. 0) seeders.  I've been trying to dl this all day, thinkin it's bogus."
,sccrguy21,2012-10-23T06:27Z,"That's exactly why I haven't touched it either. There is only one song thats extra on here that isnt in the others, its Collect Calls. The 17th is just the single of swimming pools which you can DL in another torrent."

,kharm77,2012-10-24T21:56Z,"When I was opening the files after downloading in utorrent (which took only a minute) a pop-up came up and said there was a file that may harm my computer. All of the songs play fine and are great quality, and my computer seems fine so far, so I don't know if it was a false alarm or not."
,Iamthetruth617,2012-10-27T18:41Z,Worked great for me. Downloading at full speed and quality is 320kbps.
