,ChefEm,2012-10-22T09:51Z,Thanks for the AVI #mp4sux
,vgy12,2012-10-22T11:20Z,"Thanks for the upload!
I'm curious, how did you slim your encode by 70mb from the 397mb AFG encode?
You both did 640x360, but theirs is 128kbps audio and yours is 160...?"
,sillymilly77,2012-10-22T11:26Z,Thank you
,genocide44,2012-10-22T12:48Z,MP4SUX@ can you please upload the web-dl of revolution episode 5 please as the AFG Xvid version had a pixelation glitch.
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-22T17:56Z,"vgy12:

Lower video bitrate. AFG probably uses 1024k while I use 768 in an effort to compete with MP4 filesize.

genocide44:

Revolution.S01E05 web-dl was on my list, but something seems broken here - I get an image tag error and I'm not trying to add an image tag.

I have uploaded the torrent to seedpeer & sumotorrent.

Hopefully I'll get it up here soon.

You're one to talk - you allow LOL / DIMENSION to put out pixelated crap by the dozens (115 documented so far).

For my gentle readers - ""sceneline"" is part of ""The Scene"" and they are kind of ticked off at me for pointing out their switch to MP4 has led to a plethora of damaged encodes.

""For quality"", my eye.

p.s. - it would seem nobody can upload for the past five hours (time conversion is a bitch)."

,genocide44,2012-10-23T01:42Z,sceneline@ at least Mp4SUX uploads dont have the pixelation glitches like you have in yours 
,genocide44,2012-10-23T01:50Z,thanks MP4SUX
[V],sceneline,2012-10-23T02:43Z,yes i can thats why people don't download :)
[V],sceneline,2012-10-23T02:43Z,@ yes i can see
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-23T04:12Z,"SceneLine:

Yes you can what?

Tell lies about my encodes? Yep
Upload pixelated crap? Yep
Act like a three year old? most definitely.

You don't do AVI anymore, so what possible interest can you have in my efforts?

Just promise everyone that LOL will soon follow XOR into oblivion ... you know ... so we can return to some semblance of wuality.

That is all I ask.
That is all I desire.

[V],LegendET,2012-10-23T09:40Z,"the glitches are NOT because of mp4 container
LOL/DIM always had glitches even when they were avi this is because of the source of capture
the little black blocks we see every now and then are cuts to keep them in sync 
that is why the glitches are present in both mp4 and mkv versions
we should be greatfull for the countless years they have provided us with free television and get over the fact they switched to a better container which is mp4 as xvid can NOT produce the same quality as mp4 which is higher and yes mp4 is compatible with most media players if they dont work on dvd players by usb then move a few inches higher and plug your usb stick into the tv itself and watch them that way
going on about the switch just make you look childish move on already keep up with the times
regardless of all this thanks for your efforts 
"
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-23T10:32Z,"LegendET

Thank you very much for your words.

Sadly, I must disagree with you. I'm very sensitive to glitches and not since the likes of XOR have I seen such damaged goods as LOL/DIMENSION is now putting out. How come you could get rid of XOR so quality could step in and take its place, but LOL is sacrosanct?

I am quite willing to be convinced should I be wrong.

I've listed more than a hundred of the current MP4 based pixelation errors by them.

So, how about you point me to just ten (or one?) LOL avi file from before with the same pixelation errors and I will be convinced. Anything back to about September of 2008 should still be available on UseNet for me to check.

Until then, you'll pardon my trusting my memory more than your claim - no offense.

AVIGUY

p.s. - there is one other little issue - NOBODY chooses MP4 on purpose - and they would not have had you not mandated it. If MP4 is so great, how come TV shows on DVD and movies still get encoded in XVID AVI? And wouldn't ""The Scene"" have been mostly migrated to MP4 before the mandate if it was such a great idea?

MKV is a different story - AVI has obvious size limitations, so the higher quality naturally migrated to MKV. MP4 is a completely different story."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-23T10:41Z,"Oh, I will concede one probable error on my part - MP4 isn't really the problem - damaged encodes are. So I probably should have thought a little and called myself LOLSUX, but what's done is done.

And however you sell MP4 compatibility, I cannot tell you how many grateful people thank me for providing a format they can play. I think you make a mistake by being so dismissive about them, but it's your mistake to make.

You may consider the matter closed and that's your right. It's been pounded into my head from multiple sources that ""The Scene"" does what they want and listens to nobody - so I don't expect you to change.

But this will not keep me from questioning your mission statement about quality being the driving force in the lowest quality arena. It does say ""SD"" in your mandating document."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-23T11:43Z,"People say I'm long winded - can't imagine why ...;)

Thought about it and I also think you might be mistaken as to the pixelation errors being caused by the source.

This is because the errors don't show up always, only when LOL caps two or more shows at once - and then only one has the pixelation errors.

It seems pretty clear to me that LOL has two (or more) machines and one of them doesn't work quite right.

It's the machine and I posit that the one that doesn't work right never did an XVID encode, or at least didn't use the same streaming software..

Also, I've seen ""repack""s of a pixelated LOL encode (unfortunately rarely) and the source is just fine there, not a pixel out of place (it's always EVOLVE's wonderful work). All have the CTV logo and as much as I'd like to blame it on baby-seal-clubbing-think-they-won-the-war-of-1812 Canada ... I can't. EVOLVE's Canadian feed is never pixelated, while LOL's is from 1/3 to 1/2 of the time.

AVIGUY"
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-23T17:32Z,"Sigh - thought there was a conversation, but just more hit-and-run statements.

Well, it's all free stuff and mostly just chock full of quality goodness.

I just know that nobody challenged XOR until they left the Scene and then others stepped in.

When LOL lays down their damaged sword, someone will step up with undamaged product for all the (un?)deserving video addicts.

Here's hoping!

AVIGUY"
[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-23T18:19Z,"So, the claim is that LOL/DIMENSION have been crap at encoding all along.
Except that I somehow never noticed (if ANYONE can cite an example ...)
The problem with their claim is that I DO notice and have for a very long time.
During all this below, LOL was a paragon of quality, ""NoTV"" had only one entry.
Since then, ""The Scene"" has been pretty much perfect until this LOL MP4 debacle
Check it out:

From 2007-10=01 (October 1st to the non-linears)
Until 2008-10=02 (October 2nd to the non-linears)

I not only documented chopped encodes of XOR, but suggested tested replacements.
And now XOR is blissfully gone and quality stepped in to replace them.
