,vampzcore,2012-10-22T17:19Z,"try vlc player or try to install k-lite codec pack.



Thanks!!"
,yarnek,2012-10-22T22:19Z,"Thanks muchly.
BTW, can't understand why so many peeps still use vlc. User unfriendly and top-heavy compared to UM and GOM which both preview part files and play any format without cumbersome codec downloads."
