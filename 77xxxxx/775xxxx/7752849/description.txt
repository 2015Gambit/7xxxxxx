Recommend to you to use latest version of VLC player. Install shark007 codecs in case of any kind of problem in playback
(For non-VLC Media Player users). Alternatively, install Core AVC codecs, the fastest decoder that there is coupled with
Community Center Codec Pack and play on Windows Media Player Classic. Check sample to be sure. Enjoy!
