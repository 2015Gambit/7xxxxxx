""Gravity Falls"" is just west of weird, slightly east of eerie and always north of normal in a fresh new comedy series that follows city kids and twins Dipper and Mabel Pines who are sent to spend the summer with their eccentric Great Uncle Stan (aka Grunkle Stan) who runs a tourist trap called The Mystery Shack in a remote northwestern town where nothing is what it seems. There are creatures in the forest, there are monsters in the lake and even time traveling adventures. The comedy, produced by Disney Television Animation, has a special preview FRIDAY, JUNE 15 (9:55 p.m., ET/PT) and premieres FRIDAY, JUNE 29 (9:30 p.m., ET/PT) on Disney Channel.
