In 2011, Dynamite Entertainment published Kirby:  Genesis, a nine-issue miniseries by writer Kurt Busiek, and artists Jack Herbert and Alex Ross, featuring Kirby-owned characters previously published by Pacific Comics, and Topps Comics 

With Kirby:  Genesis, Busiek and Ross expanded on the vision of the legendary Jack ΓÇ£KingΓÇ¥ Kirby with the same dynamic and unique perspective on superheroes, and allowed a new generation of comic book readers to become acquainted with the genius that is Jack Kirby.

Spinning out of the epochal events of Kirby:  Genesis, comes the saga of Sigurd Dragonsbane, the greatest champion in all Valhalla.  Since time immemorial, tales of his adventures have resounded throughout the halls of gods and men alike.  This most interesting three-issue series explores what happens when Sigurd and his colleagues, wise Balduur, rakish Honir, and caustic Heimdall, discover that Valhalla is not the only mythic realm.  Everything is not as it seems in the newly unified Mythlands, and Sigurd's latest exploit could be his last!

Also included in this torrent:  the new version of the spinoff, Captain Victory (six issues); and the new version of the spinoff, Silver Star (six issues.)

Enjoy, and please seed.
