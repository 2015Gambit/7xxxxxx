Nice work, especially not zipping all into one file. A while back when I was visiting Vancouver city I met this guy who was making a film and he had a directory (sort of yellow pages) for all the people and company who offered services such as rent a camera tripod, if you want to make rain and lightning etc. Is such a book in this torrent and if it is which one or where can I obtain one. These books are sometimes for a particular city or country."
