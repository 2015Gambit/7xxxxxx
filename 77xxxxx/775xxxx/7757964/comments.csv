[V],Zen_Bud,2012-10-25T08:58Z,Thx :)
,napsterdp,2012-10-25T09:42Z,I presume this is the real blu ray and not the upscaled dvd version?
,pjones452,2012-10-25T10:44Z,this is for real people
,djmik21,2012-10-25T12:08Z,"Which is for imaginary people :)?
Thanks guys looks good.
Downloading now."
,extensistan,2012-10-25T13:44Z,"If it is from BOZX, it should be real!"
,Debadattajash,2012-10-25T15:54Z,"is it internal copy?? if it is, then quality should not be good!!!"
,AdhamFa,2012-10-25T19:30Z,"Why I'm getting an error ""bad torrent file"" while trying to download ??!!"
,napsterdp,2012-10-25T22:01Z,"whats the difference between this and http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7759795/The.Amazing.Spider-Man.2012.1080p.BluRay.X264-AMiABLE_[PublicHD]

This one looks better overall though from the screenshots"
,migcaballero14,2012-10-26T06:21Z,"@napsterdp: Not really, you just compared a png file from a jpg file. PNG is a lossless compression format, so screenshots here will surely look better compared to the other."
,rexol,2012-10-26T10:39Z,Ty Bozx as always!
,abhipuma,2012-10-27T18:22Z,people plz seed thx 
,oorx7,2012-10-27T19:30Z,"downloaded both, this one is better."
,canopener,2012-10-27T22:21Z,"Thx BOZX for the up!

Can't wait for a higher bitrate 1080p to show up... file size somewhere around 15GB or so."
,festisio,2012-10-27T22:54Z,"This was pretty good but not 10/10 as far as 1080p bluray rips go.

For a start it had slight black vertical bars on either side."
,Powerslave0,2012-10-28T07:36Z,"Cinavia; if not using the DTS audio track. Any conversion to AC3, AAC, or other than DTS, will have the Cinavia watermark. "
,dWdHELLCAT,2012-10-29T01:54Z,Cmon BOZX i'm waiting for the full 1920x1080 versions of this and The Dark Knight Rises.

Guys - this is the real deal as as good as it gets. 

This is the first film to use 3ality technology for 3D. As a result the movie is not converted from 2D to 3D. Its shot directly in 3D. 

Hence, this film may not look as bright & vibrant as other copies. you get amazing details nevertheless. You just need to change the picture settings to Dynamic or change the contract, brightness and backlit options.

ENJOY! and Thanks BOZX once again !"
,scurvypirate1234,2012-10-30T04:59Z,It's amazing how many people still don't understand that movies are not shot in 16:9. I guess they'll be waiting a very long time for those 1920x1080 versions.
,deric5823,2012-11-03T15:27Z,"the download stops at 35,2% what i do?
sorry for my english"
,lif3isfr33,2012-11-07T02:33Z,"Guys I think ""internal"" rips are very bad quality. Its suprising to find out after you begin to download this file the name changes to:

""The.Amazing.Spiderman.2012.iNTERNAL.1080p.BluRay.x264-BRHD [PublicHD]"" 

""INTERNAL"" HD theater shot. Similar to CAM. WTF, someone tell me I misunderstood? "
,lif3isfr33,2012-11-07T23:05Z,"finished downloading, took me one day to finish :)

video is kinda sketchy.. its a bit too dark unless that's the way its suppose to be? reminds me of hell-boy movie rips.. just too contrasted for my taste.. even the Columbia brightness white light is too darkish. an 8/10

audio.. I can't tell seems too soft as well.. might wait for its official release to compare.. this rip is in fact INTERNAL release so I suppose its tolerable for us who want to watch it early. Good HD theater rip. a 7/10"
