,HeavyChevy01,2012-10-24T14:01Z,"@brock1384 Put the entire folder on the on the xbox hard drive using xexmenu or ftp, you can then run the deafault.xex throught xexmenu or set the console to boot directly into freestyle dash with dashlaunch, youtube has lots of great videos on both setting up dashlauch and freestlye dash.
Let me know if this helped"
