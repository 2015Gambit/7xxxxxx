2012: the Mayan Prophecy isn't coming, it's here. As the world falls into darkness, an army unites. There's never been a gathering of heroes like this before ... but we've never faced the end of the world before! A collection of Dynamite's greatest characters, including Red Sonja, Vampirella, Pantha, Dracula, Eva, Herbert West the Reanimator, Allan Quatermain, Athena, Dorian Gray, Purgatory and many more, must band together in a desperate attempt to prevent villainous sorcerer Kulan Gath from turning the world into ash. But when your allies include the lord of all vampires, everyone will be at one another's throats -- literally! An earth-shattering storyline from crossover-king writer Ron Marz, and fan-favorite artist Walter Geovani, with an incredible cover by Paul Renaud!
