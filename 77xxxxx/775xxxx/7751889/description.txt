ALL seasons, ALL episodes (including the oft missing last half of season 4), and the recently aired 'Death Comes to Town'.

Quality is standard rip.  These are NOT my rips BTW and I claim no responsibility for the quality, and no credit for the files themselves.  (Just look at the filenames if you would like to credit the original release).

All I've done is collected, archived and shared, all in one.

I will seed this until we get a couple at 100%, after that, I expect this to be SHARED!  ...as I probably won't have the balls or bandwidth to host another.

If you're a child of the 90's, this is a must have DL.  

Enjoy!
