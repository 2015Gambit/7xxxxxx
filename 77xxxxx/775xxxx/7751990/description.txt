The Bionic Woman is smashing down mansion doors and kicking holes in yachts, dodging bullets in the tropics and turning super-spy in the Mediterranean, all in a frenzied quest to uncover the real secrets behind the Mission, and shut them down once and for all. But she's not the only one on a hunt, and she's about to find out that you should never kick a hole in a yacht you're on and that not all bullets can be dodged.
