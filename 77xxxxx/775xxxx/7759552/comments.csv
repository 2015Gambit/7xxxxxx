,Lucixir,2012-11-24T06:16Z,"358 Seeders, yet this only downloads around 5kb-30kb for the past 30 minutes. Sounds rigged and fake, downloaded the 710mg version above instead, it is downloading around 2mg per sec.

If I was getting faster download speed I would wait for longer but I am suspecting all these seeds are fake. Delete Tor + Data, doesn't seem legit."
