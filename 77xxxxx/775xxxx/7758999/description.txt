Breakaway Audio Enhancer dramatically improves the audio experience for all PC users with the same technology as pros in the music business use to clarify and control your computer audio. From the creator of Volume Logic, presenting a new, broadcast quality system to revolutionize your listening experience. Now, no matter which media player you prefer, all your music, movies, and sound will be presented to you with the highest level of quality, consistency, and depth. Multi-band audio processing will bring out the punch and balance in all of your audio, while detailed and authentic metering let you see it in action. 

Breakaway Audio Enhancer provides complete audio control over music, videos, web browsers, and games. Screaming web ads impale speakers, Hulu videos require cranking the volume up, and every media player makes favorite CDΓÇÖs sound different but Breakaway Audio Enhancer changes all that. Audio from any source sounds professionally mixed with the Audio EnhancerΓÇÖs automatic adjustment of volume dynamics and equalization.

Breakaway Audio Enhancer incorporates state-of-the-art dynamics processors that examines and adjusts the audio thousands of times per second. Low levels are intelligently raised and loud signals are kept under control. Audio in any media player or web browser, including MP3s, video, Internet radio, or CDs, will be digitally remastered for consistent volume level and spectral balance. Files are not scanned or modified - just improved in real-time before they hit your headphones or speakers.

With Breakaway Audio Enhancer there is no longer a need to purchase separate audio enhancement plug-ins for each of your media players. Breakaway Audio Enhancer will improve the audio for all Windows audio & video players. It is the gatekeeper for good sound between any digital audio player and your speakers. Only sweet sounds get out.

Never again will you have to reach for your volume control to crank up that tune that's just too quiet, or turn down that hot track that pumps a little too hard- just sit back and enjoy the sonic bliss. Other features include a fully sizable, and dockable interface, Windows Explorer extension, and setup wizards to squeeze the top performance from your system.
