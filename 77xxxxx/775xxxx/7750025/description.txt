Homeless veteran Bob &#x27;Drillbit&#x27; Taylor manages to enjoy life anyhow and even saves some cash for his dream, an &#x27;all-paid&#x27; move to Alaska, even if that may take many years. His dream comes within reach when clever nerd Wade, has fat friend Ryan &#x27;T-dog&#x27; and cocky shrimp Jim, all new to junior high-school, are bullied so badly by emancipated Filkins and his buddies that they advertise for a bodyguard. Only Drillbit seems affordable and not crazy, so he&#x27;s hired and drains their pocket-money and home content. He&#x27;s clueless how to protect them but gives them (bogus) self-defense classes.
