GhostofMackisGod, please keep your hate contained deep, deep inside you, don't ever let it out again for people to see how ugly you are on the inside. if the rest of us (the 99,9999999etc.%, basically the whole human race minus YOU) gets lucky all that hate turns in to a cute little tumor that relieves us from having to share a planet with you.

Anyway, I think it's horrible that women are getting raped in our US armed forces.  All they want is the equal right to work for American oil companies by invading 3rd world countries in the Middle East to kill some soldiers but mostly innocent civilians just like the men do.  Is that so wrong?"

,stewiestheki,2012-10-25T10:02Z,"I think the ""Mack"" guy is quite misinformed. So for people that don't know, I have a few details, that are facts, about the military. Women are not able to enlist in combat arms. Meaning that theyre not on the battlefield. They can be medics and mechanics, which are on the battlefield, but they are normally not involved in firefights. Any person who is willing to sign their life over in the pursuit of saving anothers is worth more than any man who is willing to say theyre better. If you havent served then how are you worth anything more than them? Soldiers do not enlist to kill civilians, or children, or any other innocent people. The problem being that our enemy is not the military of the countries that we've gone into, but the civilians who were attacking their own country. Soldiers did not enlist because of oil. They did not die for oil. They died to pretect those very fuckign freedoms that those on here love so much. Freedom of speech is great, so why don't you say thank you to the people that make sure you get to keep those. And by the way Mack, its not black people that are raping everyone. That's just your rascist idea that your mommy and daddy burned into your brain. Any person who thinks that theyre a deity is obviously just an idiot. A couple of my opinions on the other comments now. love the idea of the guy getting a tumor. Tired of hearing about propaganda. If you're an adult or any person able to make a sound thought, then its not fear, its just stupidity. And i do wish that mack guy could somehow be removed. I'm tired of reading movie review and seeing that rascist fucks comment. But, since the guy seems to be a complete waste of human flesh, at least we can all sleep sound at night knowing that there are 1000's of female soldiers defending his right to be a sexist rascist dousche.

I'df take my chances with the girl that got punched by the bus driver before many of the so-called men. and to the point of a previous post. their role is not a combat engaging one. lastly none of you should feel that any military person since WWII has been fighting for USA's freedom. you need to get that out of your heads and stop propagating that. we will have our freedom no matter how many countless countries we invade.

Mack, you are a racist, sexist fuck, but that is your right, keep it to yourself if you would be so kind.

Women in the army are not frontline soldiers, they fill support roles, such as medics (thank you to the other person that actually knew this) the reason they are limited to these roles is not because they are less capable than men. it is because of the general thought that a womans life is worth more than a mans, which i agree with. but if they want to serve they should be able to, if they meet the same requirements everyone else has to meet. the roles women should not be allowed to do (and this is not me trying to be sexist) are roles such as special forces, which are considered hand to hand roles (in other words you are expected to fight hand to hand) in these roles the fact that women are generally weaker would put them at more risk than a man, even with the same level of training.

,mountaineerjeff07,2012-10-29T12:05Z,"I really hate how unintelligent people like yourselves continue to fight for ""political correctness"" even though the facts are completely stacked against you.

women ARE NOT EQUAL to men. I feel this is so much of a fact that its seems so silly that you guys are not only still fighting about it, but choosing to do so here.

facts on the only reason women equality is nothing more than political propaganda.

#1 they obviously do not have the same physical capabilities as men. If they do then why arent all sports co-ed? you wanna know what sport is? oh wait, NONE.

#2 women are not mentally equal. women think emotionally while men use this thing called logic. NOW I know this isnt always true, case in point is all you males that are commenting emotionally instead of actually thinking it through. However we are talking on a majority scale here.

#3 IF men were truly EQUAL to women, then what took so long for them to get considered equal? from the dawn of time men have been considered superior, so why havent the truly equal women just do what they had to do to change it from the beginning?

#4 women are not as intelligent as men are. Now this is  only coming from my personally experience, so I guess I leave the option open that It may only be a fact based on the control group. That being said EVERY woman I have EVER met is not as smart as their male counter-part. I am an Engineer. and when it comes to education women try to pursue equal paths but the truth of the matter is while they may pull it off, they have to try WAY harder. now if there are 2 equal tasks, and I work at 40% capacity to complete and 'she' has to work at 115% to do the same IDENTICAL task, then how could you possibly imply that just because she completed the task we are equal?

#5 this is my last piece of evidence against equality. if we are TRULY 100% EQUAL in ALL points of creation....then how does this movie even exist? now I am still waiting on the movie to download, so I might not have the facts on this, but from my understanding this movie is about women getting raped by men, shouldnt it be about people getting raped by people? you know since we are so equal?

you choose a physical OR mental feat. and Ill bet the person that is the absolute best at it, is male. now women can do important things (read stereotypical roles), but logically speaking, I bet men could probably even do those better too, but hey women have to have something to do.

Now you can flame on like you have against ghost, and fit yourselves into the same group as many other stupid people, or IF you truly think I am wrong, then by ALL means PLEASE prove me wrong, I would love to change my outlook, but from my point of view these are the facts."

The military is the strong are of the global corperations to strong arm resources from people that sugest other forms of payment besides little green strips of paper.

and if you think ANYTHING excuses rape you should really see a therapist... its like saying that just because you are angry you can murder someone and its ok, I'm fairly sure the world doesn't work that way you brainless retard.

hell all the smartest people ive ever met were female, im above average intelligence but they made me look like a fucking idiot without trying. yes i know this is not a general rule but still.

guess when that logic applies? oh, come on guess....how about WAR??? now I dont particularly agree with either myself, but on that point you lose your own argument.  

now when it comes to the emotion vs logic idea, you also lose your own argument. ""women do think more emotionally than men as a rule"" Like you said, when you make decisions that affect mass amounts of people then you have to use the commonly accepted terms. 

"" yes i know this is not a general rule but still. "" but still, what??!!?? so just cause you found a woman to make you look like a baboon doesnt mean anything at all. I guarantee for those women to get to where they are they had to work MUCH harder than there male counterparts, which mean they didnt do it as well.

Women are not equal to men. Women are superior to men. And I will demonstrate this by refuting each and every one of his idiotic, poorly communicated, ignorant, and irrational ""arguments."" 

1. What exactly do you mean by ""physical capabilities,"" you sad, confused imbecile? On average, males are 5 inches taller (5'9"") and 50 pounds heavier than females. Obviously, some women are 5'9"" and taller, but the average female height is 5'4.""  Does that make you ""better"" in some way? Since males can do more pull-ups, does that make you superior in any way? No, it does not. 

This type of irrational boy argument gives away how deluded the male of the species is. In his mind, whoever can get more violent and do the most damage in a fight is ""better."" Chimps have far better physical capabilities than human males. Chimps are faster, stronger, and can rip apart any human male in a fight. 

Does that make chimps superior? Should they be in charge of governments, economies, or anything else? No. It does not mean anything, and this ""argument"" shows how dumb and violent males are. And actually, chimps might do a better job on Wall Street and in government than males have done. Take a look at the Middle East and North Africa. That's what you get when you allow males to run wild. "

That's why boys make up the vast majority of high school dropouts, students with learning disabilities, and students that need psychotropic medication for mental disorders. And the numbers are only getting worse. This is only about 40 years after women just started entering higher education. Barely 50 years ago, pigs like you made it impossible for women to even pursue higher education (because you’re all scared little boys).

Males like you passed laws to make it legal for men to beat women, to keep women out government, to strip women of all economic and political rights. The feminist movement started because women aren’t going to take this garbage anymore. And you better get used to it. 

You're so illogical, uneducated, and ignorant that you can't see that. And that's been the problem, since the beginning of time."

I don't care about your personal stories. Women are more intelligent, more hard-working, and more able to accomplish goals. That's why we're the majority of college graduates, even with swine like you trying to stand in our way (go re-read #2, pig). And I'd love to hear how you ""scientifically"" measured how much brain capacity it took you versus a woman to complete a task. Where did you get your numbers? 40% versus 115%? How far up your rear end up did you reach to pull those out? You're so deluded that you imagine everything in your idiotic boy brain with no connection to reality. Why are males like this? You don't deal with facts. And by the way, if I had to bet money, I’d bet the “woman” you’re talking about is someone that you asked out, and she rejected you. I feel pity for any woman that has to work around trash like you. 

You're not objective. You're consumed by your extreme hatred of women, and you can't even see past it. You're the most worthless piece of misogynistic garbage I've seen in a long time. You probably go for days without even talking to women (and who would want to talk to you). "

,jackiesmith890,2012-11-07T14:07Z,"5. This movie is about the epidemic of rape in the military. It's an all volunteer force that is about 15% female, 85% male. It's a problem because of worthless swine like you, who view women as nothing but trash to be used and thrown out. 

Like I previously said, males outweigh females by about 50 pounds on average (has nothing to do with superiority). Since males are so bad at controlling themselves and their one emotion (anger), they're naturally violent and irrational. They rape and treat women like garbage. 

And rapists get away with it, because of misogynistic male trash like you that sees no problem with it, that are sweeping this under the rug in the military. You should be ashamed of yourself. You don't even know what the movie is about, yet you spew your irrational ""arguments."" 

Women don't rape men. Women don't get irrationally violent because we can control ourselves, since we are superior. Males commit the vast majority of murders, rapes, assaults, robberies, thefts, etc., not just in the military, but in the world, because males cannot control themselves. And that's why you need to be taken out of power. Tonight was a good start--Todd Akin, Scott Brown, and Joe Walsh (who lost against double amputee war veteran Tammy Duckworth) were all taken out. 

Women are superior to men, and that's why men are finished. And I think you know it. This is why males have such irrational hissy fits in order to hold onto their fading privileges. Oh, here's a feat I'd like you to try. Create life and give birth to a human being, thereby keeping the human race going...that's what I thought. "
,jackiesmith890,2012-11-07T14:42Z,"Your point of view is not driven by facts. That's because you're an irrational male, driven by your hatred of women and fragile ego, who has no clue about what is going on in the real world. And I think I know why this is happening. You're an ugly loser who can't get laid. I'm sure you hit on ""inferior"" females all the time, only to get rejected because you're ugly/fat/zit-covered/frumpy. In other words, no woman wants you, so you lash out with your woman-hatred. I see it all the time, because males are emotional creatures driven by their fragile egos. It's your fault you can't get laid. Deal with it. Making up illogical, irrational arguments to justify it won't change anything. Join a gym or get plastic surgery, and then maybe you might get a date. 

And by the way, a woman gave birth to you (unfortunately). I hope your mother is ashamed that she produced you, because she should have aborted you. You're worthless, and you shouldn't be alive. These are facts, not my opinion. 

When you snap and go crazy, don't do the typical irrational male thing and shoot up an office, salon, store, school, or gym. Just shoot yourself, and only yourself. Innocent people shouldn't die because you're a piece of trash. Only you should die. 

Now I'm done. I hope ""mountaineerjeff07,"" and any other woman-hating, illogical, loser swine here learned a few things. You can get back to your internet porn or video games now. I hope every single one of your mothers is ashamed that they had you. And I hope your fathers (if you've ever met them) get smacked for impregnating them."

A&V=10/10

Disgusted with the U.S military. Commanders not prosecuting rapist because it will take longer for them to be promoted. 20% of woman reported sexual assault in the U.S military so double that number because half don't report. So 4/10 women have been sexually assaulted. so much for a just military fighting the good cause.

RECOMMEND ANY WOMAN THINKING ABOUT THE U.S MILITARY TO WATCH THIS FIRST."

We sign away our freedom for shitty pay and are put in some of the most stressful situations you can imagine. It shouldn't be a license to ""throw some cock"" at a female soldier it should be a license to throw the book at any asshole who would break the covenant we have between us. Raping a fellow soldier should be treated as treason, punishable by death because it's a crime against the country."

,pzacco,2012-11-21T04:16Z,"Dear mountaineerjeff07,

I feel I am somewhat qualified to tackle the points you raised about women’s inferiority. Disclaimer: I am a woman. Please don’t let that put you off. 

#1 Women do not have the same physical capabilities as men.

Actually, they do. If you look at the Olympic Games, both men and women continually break new sporting records. Women are breaking strength and endurance records that men held maybe 15 or 20 years ago. This shows that men are not more physically capable than women, only that they have a head start. 

#2 Women are not mentally equal. Women think emotionally while men use this thing called logic. 

You say yourself that this isn't always true. Both men and women use logic. Women might be more emotional in general, but this has a lot to do with them being socialised to take on the mother/nurturer role.

#3 IF men were truly EQUAL to women, then what took so long for them to get considered equal? 

Historically, women’s equality has been hindered by their ability to get pregnant. This is common knowledge, actually. Birth control is a relatively recent thing, so in the past, women just got knocked up time and time again, and had to rely on men to provide for them. Access to birth control is the number one thing that has helped women reach some semblance of equality (we’re not there yet). You’ll also notice that women have made the most gains in countries with lots of birth control access and education (for women!). There have been lots of studies on this, if you can be bothered looking.

#4 Women are not as intelligent as men are. 

This is bull, and you actually know it. You say this is based on your own personal experience, and I would like to impart some advice: if you believe women to be stupid, you will mostly experience what you expect. For example, my sister believes all men are assholes. I know this isn't true, because I know plenty of good guys. Still, every man she meets and dates indeed turns out to be an asshole. She gets what she expects and you will too.

Also, you say you’re an engineer, well... I'm an engineer too. Actually, I WAS a civil engineer. I'm now a technical translator (oh, because I'm bilingual, too). Most of the other technical and patent translators I work with are women. Just because you don’t surround yourself with smart women doesn't mean they don’t exist.

#5 This is my last piece of evidence against equality. If we are TRULY 100% EQUAL in ALL points of creation....then how does this movie even exist? 

I don't even really understand this question, but I'll try to answer it anyway. All humans have the same worth, but that doesn't stop them taking advantage of each other. Men and women can rape each other, yes, but because of the power structure in the military (and outside of the military), more rapes are committed by men against women than the other way around.
Anyway, I would implore you to read up on sociology or maybe even take a course. I'm sure you could figure out many of the answers to your questions with just a little more access to information. Sociology will give you an insight into the power structures of society and why things are the way they are. That goes for jackiesmith890, too.
