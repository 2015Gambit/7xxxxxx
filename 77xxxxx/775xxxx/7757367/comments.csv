,cipherpunks,2012-10-25T05:28Z,"Why are these SpeedCD torrents always so slow? I'm only getting 4k download, and there aren't that many leechers. I'll leave this running overnight and it will still be incomplete in the morning, about 8 hours from now. Meanwhile someone else will download it, remove the stupid RAR compression, and reupload another torrent. And that torrent will download and complete before the SpeedCD one. "

,ShepardRahl,2012-10-26T05:44Z,"cipherpunks - I got the torrent in about five minutes. Maybe your internet sucks. It would do you well in the future to consider this before whining like a fool.

MP4SUX is a worthless troll for WEB-DL torrents. He tried the exact same dumb shit last week and the episode was fine. "

[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-28T05:18Z,"Nobody has to care about the additional quality (or lack thereof) information I 

provide, so the real question is:

Why do you want this information kept from them?"
,iGrenade,2012-10-29T00:29Z,"@ShepardRahl
how am i trolling? you're patronizing everyone.

you consider anyone who display a little bit more intelligence than you (or anyone you simply disagree with) to be a ""troll."" learn to use the term properly.

relax, brethren. there's no need to get butthurt."
,ShepardRahl,2012-11-01T13:12Z,"How am I patronizing everyone? I simply pointed out how there is nothing wrong with the file and it's a lie to claim otherwise just because you don't want people to download from this uploader. Get over yourself.

If you don't know how you were trolling then you are obviously not ready for it to be explained to you.

So I make one comment stating that the file is in fact fine and suddenly I'm attacking somebody who is ""smarter"" than me? Letting others know that somebody is lying about something that can easily be proven false means that I am disagreeing with the liar? 

By the way; I am amused at how after only one comment you suddenly know me. That's troll 101. Call somebody stupid to incite a flame war to distract from the original topic.

You're the one that sounds all defensive, butthurt, and needs to relax. I recommend staying in the bubble since the outside world doesn't seem to agree with you."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-14T08:04Z,"ShepardRahl:

Apparently I left this conversation too soon.

As anyone of thousands can do is to look at 13:11 of this file.

If there are ""Gross Pixelation Errors"" then I'm not a liar.

The proof is in the pudding.

I freely admit in my report that many (most?) don't care.

My information is for those who do.

AVIGUY"
