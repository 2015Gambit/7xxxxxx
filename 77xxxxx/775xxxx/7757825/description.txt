Hello guys, my teacher dumbly put the advancing reading copy of the new seven series out on here website in PDF format which I have download and will share with you guys.

The series is this one here: 
http://orcabook.com/seventheseries/index.html#!/


This book is called "Last Message" and is about a boy who has to travel to france and complete three challenges given to him by his deceased grandfather. It is an excellent read and I recommend it.

This book is by Shane Peacock

Please be aware that this is an advanced reading copy of the book, the story is still all there and is the final version just some of the graphics are missing on some of the very first pages and there is a large watermark on the side of the page that says "advanced reading copy" this hover doesn't go over the words so it is still readable if only a tad annoying.

Have a fun time reading and enjoy
