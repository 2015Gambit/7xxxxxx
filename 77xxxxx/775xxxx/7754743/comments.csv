,Bigross01,2012-10-24T18:16Z,Hey is there anyway to get it so that i can download the individual tracks or can it only be done as the 3 mixes??
[V],jmz619,2012-10-24T21:50Z,Bigross all you have to do is download a cue splitter  and it will split them for you Google: Medieval CUE Splitter install that and just drag the cue file in to the program and it will ask where to save just save it in the Ministry of sound Euphoria folder also create a folder name it CD1 something like that and just set the destination and click split and there you go. easy as pie. :)
[V],jmz619,2012-10-24T21:53Z,also if you use winamp or mediamonky you can just install a cue reader plugin and it will show you the tracks artists and title without splitting it.
