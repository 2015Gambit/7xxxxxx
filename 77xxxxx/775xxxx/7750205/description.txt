This is a collection of music videos from the 1970's that I've found over the years.  

Allman Brothers (w/Duane) - Whipping Post
Black Sabbath - Children of the Grave, Snowblind
Deep Purple - Black Night
Fleetwood Mac - 2 different versions of Rhiannon.  Both are great because Stevie Nicks is so intense.
Frank Zappa - Montana
Heart - Barracuda, Crazy on You
Janis Joplin - Cry Baby
John Lennon w/Chuck Berry - Johnny B. Goode, Memphis  (This is really good!  The Plastic Ono Band is there, and so is Yoko, but it sounds like her mic is turned off.)
Johnny Cash - The Man in Black
Journey - Feeling That Way, Wheel in the Sky
Neil Young - Heart of Gold
Rainbow - This is a 1976 short film of them performing, interspersed with interviews.
REO Speedwagon - Ridin' the Storm Out, Time For me to Fly
Rush - A Farewell to Kings, Circumstances, La Villa Strangiato, Working Man
Sweet - Fox on the Run

Please seed this as long as possible to keep this historical record alive for future generations.

Check back in a week or two for a collection of blues greats.
