,NekodaLolita,2012-10-25T21:53Z,in the US it comes out on Wednesdays. EZTV Always has the best uploads for tv shows. Anytime I look elsewhere for tv I get crap sound and there are even commercials. Eztv has clean crisp sound and excellent picture quality. He is NOT a fake. You are trolls and forever alone virgins. Grow up get a life outside the internet and get laid.
,spooner152,2012-10-26T05:01Z,It isn't fake. This episode sucks though.
,Kimmyme,2012-10-26T23:16Z,lmfao I don't even know why you guys are responding to that douche! He probably just goes around typing that on everyone's uploads. Anyways thanks again eztv ;)
,tflagger997,2012-10-27T00:53Z,"spooner152 - You expected otherwise?  Kripke bailed and those running the show thought taking Bobby and Kas out were good ideas (reduce the budget).  I know Kas is back (technically), but 60 seconds per episode on average is still mostly-not-there, just like last season.  

The dialogue is weak, the stories weaker, and the constant interruptions with flashbacks makes me glad LOST is dead.  We can only hope that the sliding ratings will spur them back to the Kripke formula, and to get better stories."
