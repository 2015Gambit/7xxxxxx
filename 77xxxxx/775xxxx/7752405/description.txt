Sudeep is a high profile industrialist who   
gets whatever he wants and he has a special  
eye for beautiful women. To get them, he will
not hesitate to do anything. That desire gets
triggered when Sudeep sees Bindu, a micro    
artist who runs a non-profit organization.   
However, Bindu is loved by Nani who keeps    
following her everywhere. Though Bindu loves 
him, she doesn't express it to him and enjoys
the attention. The story takes a turn when   
Sudeep discovers the feelings of Bindu for   
Nani and is unable to digest his defeat. He  
kills Nani. But Nani is born again as        
'Eega'(fly) and he wants to take vengeance   
on Sudeep.
