,Joe33345,2012-10-23T16:24Z,Kudos to ltt99 but I checked the quality. It's just an upconverted dvd to 1080p. Not worth it guys :(

,boomkidd,2012-10-23T23:32Z,"STOP UPCONVERTING DVDS!!!!!!  Why do u ppl do this??  Dont you have jobs??  lol  Is it, ""Im the 1st one to post the bluray""  or something?  the fuck man?!  
Waste O time."
,will3583,2012-10-24T00:56Z,Why is this movies taking forever to be upload at good quality???
,Revisionist,2012-10-24T01:16Z,"do people not get that it isnt hires just because you convert it. the size is also way way off regardless.  you will get better quality just getting a good SD version without all the reencoding.  Every time something is re encoded the quality goes down.

So wish there was a section that was actually just for HD files and not all the trash people seem to think is Hi res"
,erraticchevy,2012-10-24T05:24Z,"You Guys are fucking dumb this is a blu ray copy i just finished downloading it the only thing is its an mkv but its definstly hidef its not no fuckin dvd upscale like the others i downloaded 5 copies and this is easily seen as blu ray it took awhile to download so i know most of you guys didn't download and are talking out your asses show some respect for the uploader you guys don't deserve to download who talk shit and haven't seen it, if you think this is an upscaled DVD then you need some fucking glasses bro

,erraticchevy,2012-10-24T07:48Z,its not upscaled wtf? your an idiot a dvd at 480p stretched upscaled to 1080 there is noway it would be as clear as this is its not a perfect bluray but its not a fucking DVD rip there's no dvd that looks this good in 1080p if it was upscaled at 1080 it would look horrible the pixels would be big as shit the screen would be blurry and look shitty again use some common sense you freakin idiots put your contacts in THIS IS NOT UPSCALED DVD its a bluray HD RIP
,HITMAN00,2012-10-24T08:52Z,"awesome quality, legit real thing.  "
,stone2111,2012-10-24T09:00Z,"Wow, chillax erraticchevy.
Maybe it isn't an upscaled dvd but I've just downloaded it and the quality is about the same as a dvd if not a little poorer and there's a slight jitter every couple of seconds when played with vlc and xbmc.
In my opinion  if you want a good hi-def copy for your archive don't waste ya bandwith on this one. However if all you wanna do is watch then delete by all means get this one.
I will be getting a proper HD version when its released."
,IYNTA,2012-10-24T13:04Z,Not blu ray.
,dumbfuckerraticchevy,2012-10-24T13:05Z,"Dont normally sign up for this stuff but had to reply to eratichevy. Obviously you are the biggest dumb fuck noob. """"there's no dvd that looks this good in 1080p if it was upscaled at 1080 it would look horrible the pixels would be big as shit the screen would be blurry"""" ha ha i lmao at this, the pixels would be big as shit! noob noob noob wtf dont you know what interpolation is?? have you not heard of the terms bilinear or bicubic or lanczos or understand that sharpening filters, denoise filters can be applied to video? just never comment again as you are the dumbest fuck I have ever heard. This is a shitty upscaled blurry release with bluray in the name. It is people like you who make me fear for the human race as there is nothing stopping you procreate arrrggggghhhhh"
,discolex,2012-10-24T18:24Z,Word!
,bigbullzi,2012-10-25T01:46Z,Why all the bitching? It's a BAD remake. Horrible acting and worse script! 
,master_icebox,2012-10-25T03:04Z,"it's not bluray. 

erraticchevy, please use punctuation and shut the fuck up!"
,mavtt13,2012-11-01T01:53Z,I just watched it and it definitely is Blu-ray quality!
