So thank you./"

Just install the game and play it. Nothing else is required.

Thanks for the UL."
,Wolfcry,2012-10-25T08:52Z,"And it doesn't work on Win XP, just Win 7/8 and Vista."
,Wolfcry,2012-10-25T08:53Z,"Some say that it doesn't work on Vista, well, that's weird cause' it worked for me."
,ittam_pl,2012-10-25T15:57Z,"on my win7 i see runing process, but game doesn't start :("

,alucard37,2012-10-25T23:41Z,"My game crashes immediately after I open it on windows 7, can anyone help? The game looks amazing!"
,SexZucchini,2012-10-26T00:18Z,"When I started it, it loaded the first time.  Went to campaign, started new game, and it crashed.  I loaded again, tried again, and it worked.  Win7 64-bit here."
,lolwut11234,2012-10-26T01:57Z,"installed and ran last night fine, went to start it up today and the process starts but that game never does. "
,isotope,2012-10-26T06:06Z,"As a courtesy to azaq318, and for those of you who are having troubles:

- The game will not work in XP, as it does not support DX11.
- You cannot just click the exe to make it run; use the desktop shortcut as there's a parameter required for the program to launch properly."
,lolwut11234,2012-10-26T08:34Z,"I never had the desktop shortcut made, will I have to reinstall? "
,oorenotsoo,2012-10-27T19:50Z,"Thanks azaq! This proper works perfectly.

@lulwat: I've only been using the desktop shortcut that was created during the install. I copied the ""target"" for the shortcut and created a new one that also seems to work fine.

Right-Click on your desktop and select ""New."" Then select ""Shortcut."" Windows 7 has a prompt that will pop up. You only need to paste the ""target"" information in there and it will take care of the rest.

""C:Program Files (x86)A Game of DwarvesA Game Of Dwarves.exe"" -bundle-dir .

Copy that with the quote at the beginning and the period (.) at the end. Edit whatever you need to make it point to your file/folder location. Then the game should load fine."
,danielwe,2012-10-28T18:40Z,Any chance youl be uploading the patch that fixes the awful camera bug ? unable to rotate or zoom.
,dubesor,2012-10-28T19:47Z,btw this is an old version. there have been 2 updates since. major bugs got fixed and they allow for dirtblocks to be placed now. 
,Rammiton,2012-10-29T05:08Z,I'd love those new patches too. Unfortunately we can't be to demanding or picking. We are getting this game for free...
,danielwe,2012-10-29T13:50Z,Any idea where one can find the patch?
,danielwe,2012-11-02T16:16Z,no patch yet? :/
,Satori42,2012-11-04T04:17Z,"I too am having the crash-on-startup problem, using Windows 7 64-bit, and starting with the correct desktop shortcut.  Pity."
,Satori42,2012-11-04T23:23Z,"I managed to overcome the problem, and get the game working.  I did it by reinstalling a copy of DirextX 11 from another source, that the game installation overwrote.  Works fine now."
,mrqnr,2012-11-08T14:11Z,What about patch 1.01?
,Kidzin,2012-11-11T14:38Z,It works for me on Vista but i have very annoying bug with a lot of letters missing in game an menu.
