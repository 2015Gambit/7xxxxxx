,TheoDusko,2012-10-25T19:19Z,"@LordGod88 - Thanks! I think I had found that before but didn't want to download the iLivid thing that they make you use, but it worked in the end! That book will definitely be in my next upload.

@tiddlywink - I don't have any of those books now either. I do have Being Light by Helen Smith, but since I got that on this site you've probably gotten it by now as well. I'll add them to my list of books to hunt for though. Cheers!"
