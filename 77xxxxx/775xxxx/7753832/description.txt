    The real deal--as always. Seed throughout the holidays and enjoy.  
                              
     From the University of Uncle Jerry.  Another underground creation from us to you because we care.

  This is Windows 8 Professional Edition operating on a 16GB USB.  (ANY 16GB or larger USB)  We make things that boot.

 Windows is activated until April 19th 2013 and may be reactivated again at that time. You will find that there are 9GBs of free space available for the installment of additional software.  No modifications have been made besides the activation.  Installing to a USB just takes a couple of mouse clicks using the included usb tool.
