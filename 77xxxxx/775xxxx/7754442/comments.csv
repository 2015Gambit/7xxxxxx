,Green.Lantern,2012-10-25T21:29Z,Do I need to install origin for this?
,nignug,2012-10-26T06:43Z,You might need Origin installed but you won't need an account. To be honest though this game is just another failed project from EA. The SP is really poor. 
,mmatosin,2012-10-27T22:18Z,"after every breach/clear crash i would simply use another crack if there is a checkpoint inbetween two breches,but now iam on a level where is 2b/c and no checkp. between them and the crack cant fix it....grrrrrrrrr what to do what to do ???? SOMEONE????? "
,kuropatwa,2012-10-28T23:37Z,I read somewhere to not getting headshots while breching...i didn`t test this solution yet. mmatosin did you unlock tomahawk in breach sequence?

Hey Yorgal

First use deamon tools, and mount MOHW cd A:
Then run the FAIRLIGHT INSTALLER from the disc!

After 50% unmount cd A:, and monut cd B:

Let the install finish, and select NO to install crack, and libary files!!!!

Then copy the Patch files to your install directory.
Then copy the FLT crack only crack to install directory!

Then just lauch the game, and run it in window mode each time it crashes, and you arw able to countinue :D:D:D:D:D!!!! work fore me guyes! i just finish the whole game on S.P  AAAAAAWSOOOMEE ^^"
