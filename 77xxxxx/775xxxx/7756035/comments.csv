Howbouit not leaving the loveintrests foibles till tha last minute. that is  interesting. but really slater talking to a fluffy dolll monkey just destroys the whole movie. No matter how bad the cgi???? or clipart is. 3 stars for trying. out of 5 or 10 i cannot decide. it's a bad movie with some great ideas that were destroyed as soon asthey came up. HMMMM 
Fuck! could have at least been a cult movie. Now just a pile of shit. A fun one but still!!!"

,scaredandbaked,2012-10-27T10:45Z,"I have done the jimson weed, its exactly like that except, you can concentrate on something for more then 10 seconds.

Id advise people to stay away, it is nothing like acid, mushrooms or DMT. I was still peaking 36 hours later. You have blurry vision for over a week.

I myself have done alot of drugs that make you trip face, but i only done this one time. it scared the hell out of me.

I myself drank it, not smoked it.

It was a sick movie though!

thanks scene4all"

,jodot159,2012-10-29T21:38Z,"the ghost guy just does it because he enjoys reading all the retarded replies you people give him.  he's just a troll that's trolling trolls.  it's quite hilarious actually that trolls bite faster than anyone else.  12 year old mentality, and to think, one of you may be president one day, and i thought the current candidates were bad."
,JustRacey,2012-11-03T00:15Z,"Scaredandbaked- You ARE A FUCKING IDIOT. even mentioning the use of jimson weed as a way to get a 'high' is reckless, irresponsible and downright bordering on deliberate manslaughter. As an Agri-scientist jimson weed can be and is VERY frequently FATAL if ingested by oral or smoke methods.  If not fatal it can cause permanaent irreperable SERIOUS brain damage. When I was in high school  some kids had heard about jimson weed and though they'd give it a try. THREE DIED and a fourth ened up on a respirator for the rest of his drastically shortened life as a veggie.  You want to get high-- at least stick to known shit that causes way less problems like marijuana!  At least some dumbshit kid reading comments here won't end up DEAD from your ignorance."
,Moviecritics,2012-11-07T05:39Z,justracey I agree with what you are saying about jimson weed but scaredandbaked did not say anything wrong. He said he tried it by drinking it and it scared the crap out of him and he tells people NOT to try it. Nothing wrong with writing about his bad experience. Now I actually want to see the movie just to see what all the fuss is about.
