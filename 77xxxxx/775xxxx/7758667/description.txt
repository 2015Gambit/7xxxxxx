American Horror Story is a horror-drama television series created and produced by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. The first season centered on the Harmon family: Ben, Vivien and their daughter Violet, who move from Boston to Los Angeles after Vivien had a miscarriage and Ben had an affair. They move into a restored mansion, unaware that the home is haunted by its former inhabitants.

The second season will feature new characters and a new location, mainly an insane asylum. Thus, the series has been called an anthology. The second season is titled American Horror Story: Asylum.

The series is broadcast on the cable television channel FX in the United States. It premiered on October 5, 2011, and has completed its first season. The series has been renewed for a second season, which premi√®red on October 17, 2012.


Thanks to DIMENSION for the original source file, however MKV's do not work natively on PS3 so this has been given the SM10 touch. Converted to MPEG2 and re-synced to accommodate that change as configured a few filters to maximise colour on those bigger screens.
This is a regular upload of mine so feel free to visit subsequent weeks for further episodes.

As always I will seed until 50-100 completes and then the rest is down to you as I will be using my speeds elsewhere. Thanks in advance and leave a comment or visit the Facebook page to leave feedback:-
