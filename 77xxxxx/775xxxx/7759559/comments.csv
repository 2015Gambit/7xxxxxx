,duriotic,2012-11-23T19:29Z,"Yeah, Norton Security Suite hates this shit and deletes the patch .exe on sight.  There's got to be a better way than all the ""just ignore the false positives and install anyway, you dumbfuck""'s and other willful and insulting attempts to get people to ignore the safety software they've installed in the first place out there.  Thanks for sharing this."
,Kanegasi,2012-11-25T07:03Z,"@duriotic

Step 1. Uninstall Norton
Step 2. Download and install Nero from this torrent normally
Step 3. If you reinstall Norton, please just start bashing your computer with a bat and never use one again"
