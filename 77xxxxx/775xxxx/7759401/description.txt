At the center of the famous government agency, the 'Internal Revenue Service' (a.k.a. the 'I.R.S'), is a team dedicated to the most serious affairs - the 'Criminal Investigation Service'.
You play the role of I.R.S. Special Agent, Frances Keegan. Responsible for tracking down tax evaders in three-piece suits, your heroine knows the financial world, spy techniques and on-site investigations like the back of her hand. Specialized in the oil industry, Frances is relentlessly pursuing Klaus Fredricks, who has been under constant surveillance ever since he was suspected of murdering one of the agents' colleagues and friends, Eric Ward. The scale of the operation is getting larger, and the I.R.S. is doing everything in its power to catch all those who think they are above any man and any law.
