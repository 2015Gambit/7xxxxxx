,matthewwrr88,2012-10-23T16:37Z,hey i was just wondering if anyone else is having trouble with the video. this is the second download i have made from gondy10 and they arent working properly. the audio is fine but the picture is horrible. it just freezes on one image and is unplayable. i have tried using vlc and other media players and its not working. any advice?? thanks

Video works for me though there is an annoying audio artifact that sounds like smacking on a mic that reoccurs frequently throughout the entire game. Not quite a deal breaker but irritating nonetheless."
,matthewwrr88,2012-10-24T21:47Z,yeah its still not working for me... its weird cause i download from pirate all the time and almost never have this problem... but it seems like all the videos i download of my lakers have this problem :( im living in brasil as well so i have to watch the game online and its not always the best quality
