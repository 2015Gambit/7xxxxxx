Gardens of Britain & Ireland
by Patrick Taylor

"Britain and Ireland have a greater number
and range of notable surviving gardens
than any region of comparable size in the
world. We have excelled in the art of the
garden to a much greater degree than in
the visual arts of painting and sculpture."
