Geoff Thompson (from amazon.com):

Until the age of thirty Geoff Thompson had worked through a plethora of menial jobs, from glass collector to floor sweeper; he even spent a decade working as a nightclub bouncer.

Convinced that there must be more to life than this, Geoff decided to become a martial arts instructor (polled as the number one self defence instructor in the world by Black Belt magazine USA) then followed this by living out his dream of becoming a writer.

He is now the author of thirty-four books published in 15 languages, five multi-award-winning films (one BAFTA nominated, one BAFTA winning), three stage plays and hundreds of published articles.

Geoff's autobiography, Watch My Back, has been adapted into a major motion picture, Clubbed.
