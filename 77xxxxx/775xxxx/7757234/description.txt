I debated whether or not I should upload this torrent. I couldn't find it anywhere else when I looked. I BOUGHT this album and I HIGHLY encourage you to buy it too--the work here is simply incredible and as somebody who has met Papadosio many times, I can say they are incredible people and deserve to be paid for their work.

I came to the conclusion that music this spiritual and uplifting simply needs to be spread. So without further adieu, I present Papadosio's latest album, TETIOS-To End the Illusion of Separation, in flac.
*note-this does not include the visionary artwork--one for each song--because you should BUY THE ALBUM and you will then receive all of the amazing artwork that accompanies this masterpiece.
