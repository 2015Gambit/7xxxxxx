NOTES:
For some reason the audio reads as 5 channel instead of 6, but the audio used on this release is a direct copy from the source DVD9, not touched in any way, so unfortunately it seems to be an issue with the source. Enjoy the latest installment in the classic Puppet Master series!

AXED! We do this better
