,tverlaine,2012-10-23T02:04Z,Good idea-see if you can handle it for us.
,musclestud1,2012-10-23T02:43Z,"shut yer trap, michael! TVT NEVER gives descriptions, samples nor IMDB links.  Search the net yerself."
,michaelrwatson,2012-10-23T04:37Z,"@tverlaine: You can't add a file to a torrent that's already upped, ya peabrain. TvTeam usually upload good stuff, but a short sample is pretty basic."
