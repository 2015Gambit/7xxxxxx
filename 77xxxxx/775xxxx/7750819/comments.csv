,matt_W,2012-11-05T08:35Z,"I ran the EpicBotPRO.exe - hesitantly.
After running it, nothing happened. It just showed a quick loading icon. Then i ran EpicBot and still was just a regular user. 
Then I scanned your EpicBotPRO.exe with my antivirus and I'm getting some bad files....
Whats up with that?
Thanks for response---"
