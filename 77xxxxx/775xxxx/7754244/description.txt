Patrick and SpongeBob go on a frenzied 3 AM quest for hidden candy in 'Night Sweets.'  Then in 'Dear Diary,' Squidward's suggestion that Patrick start a journal results in daily misery - for Squidward!  SpongeBob forgets to wear his square pants to work, and thus begins 'The Big Cover-Up.'  And what is the secret of the new delicious sauce at the Krusty Krab?  Find out in 'Patrick's Sauce,' but be prepared to gag just a little bit.  All this plus a cover pin-up to drool for and step-by-step instructions by James Kochalka on how not to draw SpongeBob.
