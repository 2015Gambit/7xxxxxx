What is the story of this game?
-You are a human being who has waken up in a cryotank... you have no memories, but you find some messages from the past... from yourself...
You don't feel good... maybe this is a radioactive and toxic place ... you may not have much time... You find some stupid robots... with strange answers to your questions. 
Where and when is this game playing?
-We don't know. Maybe in the future... in a rusty, metal and concrete, post apocalyptic world... but it doesn't matter.

What about the game mechanism?
-The gameplay is very simple. You can move, take items and use them. You can examine a lot of things.
You can find information about the world and the story.
You must build up the story using these pieces of information.
This is a very important and unique part of the game. So: explore, search, think.
Why no save in this game?
-There is checkpoint system with password. The main gameplay is simple, so if you don't read the texts
again, you can reach a position very fast - and with the password you can start a level.
The graphics are good but why are the animations so simple?
-This is a text based game. So it's the texts that are important, the animations are only extras.

Why do you created this game?
-This game is my fulfilled dream. I love the old text adventures, the fps games and the classic sci-fi writers.
I wanted to make a game with really serious story about the life and death... about the human existence.
