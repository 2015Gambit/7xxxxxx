Krona, an exiled immortal from the DC Universe who gains the powers of entropy, begins destroying entire universes, obsessed with learning what existed prior to the Big Bang. The Grandmaster, one of the Elders of the Marvel Universe, offers to tell Krona about an entity who has the knowledge he seeks; but only if Krona can beat him in a game. The game involves manipulating the Avengers and the Justice League into trying to obtain twelve items of power (six from each universe - the DC items being the Spear of Destiny; the Book of Eternity; the Orb of Ra; the Psycho Pirate's Medusa Mask; the Bell, Jar and Wheel of the Demons Three; and the Green Lantern Power Battery of Kyle Rayner; and the Marvel items being the Ultimate Nullifier; the Evil Eye of Avalon; the Wand of Watoomb; the Casket of Ancient Winters; the Cosmic Cube; and the Infinity Gems) that have been hidden around across the two universes.
