@ Fytch: what more do you want? A Big Mac and fries? It's so hard to separate the songs you don't want? I don't like dubstep and I just delete the songs that I don't like, I don't ask for an upload only the genres I like. The files here in TPB are not exclusives to you."

For others: this torrent doesn't have proper tags, album art or genres. Instead it has housebeats.cc as the artist for every track. You take what you can get."
