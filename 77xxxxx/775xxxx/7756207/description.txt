From Wiki:

OneRepublic is an American rock band from Colorado Springs, Colorado.[1] Formed in 2002 by Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins, the band achieved massive success on MySpace, becoming the most prominent unsigned act on the website then. They signed onto Mosley Music Group in 2006, and released their debut album, Dreaming Out Loud in 2007.

OneRepublic made radio history when with their first single, "Apologize", received the largest amount of airplay in history with 10,331 plays in one week, the record only being broken again by "Bleeding Love" by Leona Lewis, a song Tedder also co-wrote. The remix version, featured on Timbaland's album Shock Value was a smash hit internationally, reaching number-one in sixteen countries and gaining 10 million downloads subsequently earning them a Grammy Award nomination.[2] The band also achieved national success with their second single, "Stop and Stare". Dreaming Out Loud was certified platinum in the United States, and gold in Austria, Australia and Canada.

The band's second album, Waking Up, was released on November 17, 2009.[3] The lead single from the album, "All the Right Moves", charted in the top 10 in Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and in the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. Other singles from the album include, "Secrets", "Marchin On", and "Good Life."

OneRepublic's upcoming third album, entitled Native, is scheduled for release in November 2012.




Dreaming Out Loud 2007

Dreaming Out Loud is the debut album by American rock band OneRepublic. The album was released on November 20, 2007 by Interscope Records. The album was recorded between 2004 and 2006 and it was produced by Greg Wells, with two songs produced by singer Ryan Tedder, and was engineered and mixed by Joe Zook. The album follows two years of massive success on MySpace where the band has appeared in MySpace Music's Top Artists since early 2006, with over 28 million total song plays counted. The album was released after the success of a remix version of the lead single "Apologize", which was produced by Timbaland. The song reached number one in many countries, while it peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The following single "Stop and Stare" was also a success, while "Say (All I Need)", "Mercy" and "Come Home" were also released as singles.

The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Many critics cited U2, Coldplay, The Fray, Muse and Snow Patrol as the band's influences on the album. Some commended the band for having a "tremendous confidence apparent in the craft of creating pleasing music", but others felt it was an unoriginal album and thought that Tedder continued to fare better whenever he was writing for groups other than his own. Many critics noted that sometimes itΓÇÖs hard to distinguish the differences between some tracks. The album reached top-ten in many countries, including the Australian Albums Chart, Canadian Albums Chart, German Albums Chart, UK Albums Chart and others. It debuted at number 14 on the Billboard 200 chart. Dreaming Out Loud has been certified Gold by the RIAA.
