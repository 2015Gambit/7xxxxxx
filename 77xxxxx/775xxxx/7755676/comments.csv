,moremetalthanyou,2012-10-25T07:29Z,This was actually a really entertaining watch once movie. Sorry I can't comment on the quality I downloaded this from another source a while ago. Was surprised to see in the top 100. Slow to start but worth the watch.

Hey mackisdog.. whats wrong, cant think of any new insulting and offensive things to say. This is like the fourth post about you bragging about never seeding. At least you are coming up with gay (and thats gay as in f*cking moronic, aka YOU, not man on man or woman on woman) new ways to repeat yourself. Oh at least you still consistently come across as the biggest DOUCHEBAG in the world.. more and more with each new post.
Uploader, thanks for the post, I look forward to watching this, looks good."
,carrotpouch1,2012-10-26T15:52Z,@ghost no one cares if you don't seed. there are enough people seeding everything to download in a reasonable amount of time without you insisting on never seeding anything you get from tpb
