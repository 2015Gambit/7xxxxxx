[V],meech,2012-10-25T03:30Z,Many thanks for your plethora of torrents I have partaken in.  The finest of the fine.
,xidio,2012-10-25T04:20Z,So is this the real deal or more bullshit?

,paulinacio,2012-10-25T05:12Z,I have been going crazy for the Bluray version.. Thanks- Any idea when there will be a 3D version for The Amazing Spiderman
,ofpirate,2012-10-25T06:35Z,looking forward to a proper SBS print as well.. seems like those usually those take an additional week or two to reach us
,firexninja,2012-10-25T06:57Z,thank you!
,JamJulLison,2012-10-25T07:24Z,"Thanks BOZX.  Now if only there weren't so many leechers. Normally I would say with this many seeders that the uploaders should open their bandwidth a little more. But with this many leechers, I think this time leechers might be more to blame.  "
,FireIsHot,2012-10-25T07:28Z,"You Sir Are A Pirate Legend, and for good reason. Always get my BluRay Rips from you thxvm!

,pjones452,2012-10-25T07:48Z,Im surprised this is out now i thought I would have to wait till friday. Im guessing the sbs 3D will be available sturday or sunday
,seSAMPAH,2012-10-25T08:29Z,"what happened to the ""iNTERNAL"" version of this movie from BOZX???

Whats the different?? Why BOZX deleted that torrent??"
,Alimahsoomi,2012-10-25T08:38Z,could someone seed ?
,ilovevmeganfox,2012-10-25T09:43Z,"can anyone tell me what ""REPACK"" means here ?"
,Strajow,2012-10-25T10:10Z,"Thank You BOZX!!!
Is 720p 1280 x 536? I thought it was 1280×720? 
Am i missing something here lol"
,sameonix,2012-10-25T10:49Z,thanks !:)
,sameonix,2012-10-25T11:17Z,"bitrate too slow,?"
,phase700b,2012-10-25T14:29Z,"@strajow, 720 video is 1280x720. In the case of a 4:3 aspect ratio you might see 960x720. If either the height (720) or the width (1280) are correct it's 720 resolution video. Same for 1080 video (1920x1080) The black bars you see in 2.35:1 aspect ratio movies are rarely included in the encode to save space. That's why the heights can be different."
,arnold_al_qadr,2012-10-25T15:14Z,oos?? out of sync??
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-10-25T16:54Z,"Thanks BOZX :)

The speed wasnt really the fastest, but it works :)

The upload speed was a bit better tho :P"
,flashos,2012-10-25T17:44Z,Thank you king BOZX!!!
,xidio,2012-10-25T18:11Z,"bozx still doesnt know how to seed...6KB/s is amazing man... amazing and he has a skull woah man.

If I were to download from xtremezone, yify or whoever else I get atleast 8 down.
However bozx, never above 300kb."
,neophunk,2012-10-25T19:03Z,You greedy bitches. SEED!!!
,SkeelZ91,2012-10-25T20:15Z,"Everyone, just STFU. You're on a TORRENT site, and you're getting this for free. Stop living at home, and get some decent internet. 
I have a 100/100 line, and the seed is fine.

,mike953100,2012-10-25T21:23Z,"@ SkeelZ91

omigod.  I am seriously so jealous of your upload speeds.  I did not realize speeds of 10.9mb/s existed.  Then again, I live in the US which cracks down on piracy and has way worse Internet blah blah blah.  Enjoy your upload speeds dude.  They freaking rock!"
,SkeelZ91,2012-10-25T22:15Z,"@ mike953100
Hehe thanks man! Just to point out, be careful with downloading now since the law in the US will change in a couple of days/months. I don't know what broadband you have there, but they will start watching everyone how much they use their internet at time. If it's too high, they will send you a warning. There's an article with it @ CNN. 
Be safe & use Warez or a proxy of some sort. 
Greetings :) "
,xidio,2012-10-25T22:16Z,"Skeel. Im also on 100/100 fiber and no router in between.

Yet I get no more than 300kb/s TOPS from this fucking bozx who is worthless compared to extremezone, yify, heromaster and more."
,SkeelZ91,2012-10-25T22:33Z,"@xidio Hey man, did you configure your µTorrent correctly? 
I have no router also which means I'm in direct connect like you have. Try my settings out! I changed the language / settings to English.

See if it works for you. "
,mike953100,2012-10-25T23:28Z,"@SkeelZ91

Interesting!  My ISP is not on that list, but that is crazy!  I mean, realistically, I am not worried, but I can't believe they are finally going to legitimately crack down on piracy.  I wish lived in the Netherlands/UK/Europe/wherever you live. haha"
,SkeelZ91,2012-10-26T00:49Z,"@ mike953100  ""the new world order"" heh, I know right. :) 
This only means we are still slaves to the goverment in each country, it doesn't really matter where you live or what you do for a living. The internet wasn't created for someone to control and watch what you do on daily bases. Thought I live in Sweden as you could figure out easily because of my English errors in the sentences. But I've never had a single issue during the past 9 years by being a pirate. Arr. It's good to see some friendly people out there!"
,SBonesE8,2012-10-26T01:21Z,i heard 3d version release is officialy nov 9th do we need to wait that long to see in 3d?
,ahm3d2000,2012-10-26T03:18Z,"THANKS BOZX...your a Legend!

There are like three people seeding..."
,maric550,2012-10-26T04:12Z,U good sir r a god among the pirate community
,Micke710619,2012-10-26T10:27Z,"Why isent you fagets seeding after you download a torrent? I have no speed at all now... idiots!!

,sgcb,2012-10-26T14:18Z,well for one the movie does kinda suck. Or maybe it's just that I'm past my angsty teenage years...
,antoblfc,2012-10-26T14:35Z,Having a bit of sound issue.Its a sync problem which i have never had from a BOZX file.Playing with vlc.Anyone have this problem.....Bozx you the man
,SkeelZ91,2012-10-26T15:32Z,"@antoblfc 
I don't think it has an issue with the sound, but rather the subtitles. I had slihgtly 1-2 seconds delay with them. (I didn't have my vlc updated to latest, could be that too.) Try to update yours. "
,legio9,2012-10-26T20:01Z,"@Xidio: WHY ARE YOU LYING LIKE A LITTLE BITCH?

Boxz is by far THE BEST uploader on this site:

1) Video Quality is ALWAYS perfect
2) Audio Quality is ALWAYS perfect
3) funny that you bitch about his speed, cause I download from him at 1.3Mbs..so it is your cheap equipment,  lame arse internet provider or simply because you TOO stupid to figure out how to tune your client, the reason why YOU cannot get speed.

99% of the uploader YOU named as ""excellent"" are THE WORST uploader in TPB history!: always cheap cam stolen from other, poor audio etc etc: Yeah you can get their shit fast, but it is SHIT.

So get the fuck out HERE instead of downloading from Bozx..and then bitching bozx.

@Bozx: as usual: a prefect copy: top Quality."
,krill123,2012-10-27T00:21Z,"CNN Link to the new torrent monitoring system  SkeelZ91 talked about... http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/18/tech/web/copyright-alert-system/index.html?iref=allsearch

They want to control us."
,krill123,2012-10-27T01:45Z,"@xidio.. It depends on the quality you want when watching a movie. Others you mentioned are ok but they don't compare next to BOZX quality. You may want to check your utorrent settings if you are getting slow speeds. 

@BOZX - Thanks for another quality release! U ROCK!"
,virus858,2012-10-27T23:27Z,whole team was sleepy drunk and high! lol thats what im talking about!
,swenkal,2012-10-28T07:26Z,BOZX is de man!!
,Powerslave0,2012-10-28T07:33Z,"DMCA Notices, then use a PROXY.  DO not use uTorrent without one, they work with the MPAA to stop Piracy.  BTGuard is one of the better ones, they do not LOG, do not report, and are not legally obligated to do so.  Canada does not fall under the DMCA, not yet, so BTGuard is safe.  Any Proxies in the USA log and will report if served.

Cinavia with this torrent; if not using the DTS audio track. Any conversion to AC3, AAC, or other than DTS, will have the Cinavia watermark. "
,Powerslave0,2012-10-28T07:36Z,"PeerBlock will help, the odds are higher you won't get caught, with UDP.  With HTTP, you're not as protected.  I got a DMCA notice for Tron Uprising, which is aired on CABLE, FREE, and I can RECORD it, and I was using PeerBlock.  So, PeerBlock did not help, and I was using uTorrent for all the torrents I got DMCA notices, and did not get any until I started using uTorent."

btw, is that you Nixxo?"
,jalucian,2012-11-05T17:46Z,There's no excuse for a 720p being this large of a file size. YIFY's version is equal or better quality with a file size almost 7 times smaller. 
,morosso,2012-11-06T03:34Z,^ how's the audio with YIFY's?
,lif3isfr33,2012-11-06T09:51Z,Finally a 5.1 audio stream of this movie.. damn YIFY and his bullshit uploads and taking over top of the pages.. this is the real deal 5.1 audio none of that 2.0 stereo.. wtf? its 2012 for ********
