Guerrilla is a 2011 Bangladeshi film based on the events of the Bangladesh Liberation War. An adaptation of the novel Nishiddho Loban by Syed Shamsul Huq, it was released on April 14, 2011. [1]
Nishiddho Loban, the novel, is written by the prolific Bengali writer Syed Shamsul Huq. It has been envisioned by the director of the film Nasiruddin Yousuf Bachchu. He has crafted the film GUERRILLA with his own experience as a leading fierce freedom fighter of 1971, sketching real incidents of those days. Guerrilla is a delicate, artistic rendition in moving images of the heroic deeds of the liberation war's valiant freedom fighters on an epic canvas. They were a distinguished generation, dedicated to a noble proposition that FREEDOM is Man's first and foremost right. It is not a gift.
