POtHS Comment: Religous History of America

Description:

A Radio Show interview with special guest Bill Federer who discusses the Biblical foundations and early beginnings of the United States and the 13 Colonies.  Professors Donald S. Lutz and Charles S. Hyneman published an article in American Political Science Review, 1984, titled "The Relative Influence of European Writers on Late 18th-Century American Political Thought."
They examined nearly 15,000 writings of the 55 writers of the U.S. Constitution, including newspaper articles, pamphlets, books and monographs, and discovered that the Bible, especially the book of Deuteronomy, contributed 34 percent of all direct quotes made by the Founders.
