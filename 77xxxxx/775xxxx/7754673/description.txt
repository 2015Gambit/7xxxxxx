A few similar torrents existed on here, but all of them had at least one book in crap quality (huge black borders around the image, fuzzy text, etc).


This is a collection of ones I've personally read on a first gen ipad (the Epubs were converted from PDF's via Calibre). 

There are a few typos here and there, but the books are quite readable and as a whole, are in better quality than any other torrents i've found online (the queen of blades in particular was almost impossible to find without huge black borders around the text)

Enjoy!
