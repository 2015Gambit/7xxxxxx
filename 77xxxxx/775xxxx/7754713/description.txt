Choti Choti Baatein|1965|Motilal Hindi Classic|x264|MP3|Phantom

The movie is an offbeat social drama, on a theme that was, at least in those decades, was a taboo -- friendly relations between two grown up mature people, outside of their own families.
Motilal is a widower. After retirement, he realizes that his children actually do not want him around, as they are busy with their own lives and own families. He bequeaths his assets to them, keeping enough for his own living, and moves to a village to live alone. Here he meets with Nadira, a young lady with radical views. Their friendship grows, but it becomes an eyesore for the village people, who object and complain to the two of them and to Motilal's family. The story has a sad ending, as Motilal dies of dejection on being misunderstood, and getting isolated in the face his family and society.
