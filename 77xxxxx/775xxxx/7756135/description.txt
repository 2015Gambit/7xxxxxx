Tom & Ed met in history class at Manchester University in 1988. They started off as
DJ's known as "The 237 Turbo Nutters" [named after the number of their house on
Dickenson Road in Manchester and a reference to their Blackburn raving days]. They
then opted for "The Dust Brothers" which they nicked from the L.A. producers of
"Pauls Boutique" [as they thought they would never be famous]. In 1995 they changed
their name to "The Chemical Brothers" after the real Dust Brothers threatened to sue.
