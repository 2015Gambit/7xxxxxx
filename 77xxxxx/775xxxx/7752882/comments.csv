I have a subscription as well, but it takes soooo long to download each individual video & organise into folders ... How did you do it?

Thanks for the upload"
,sigudian,2012-10-24T19:46Z,"steveaust,
Well, first I made the folders, and named them ""XX Chaptername"".
Then I installed a plugin to Chrome that let me download the raw videos. There are probably better  plugins for this for Firefox, but what ever. The plugin I used I had to rename the videos and move them to the right folder in between every download.

After this I used Handbrake to convert the videos, used normal settings, and it shrunk the videos pretty good, with no apparent quality loss.

I also included the exercise files "

Hours of work!   "
