Clinical Applications for Motor Control is a comprehensive text that will help bridge the gap between motor control/motor learning research and practical clinical applications. Written by a variety of physical therapists with a broad range of clinical expertise areas such as neurophysiology, biomechanics, and human motor control, this text is rich in a multitude of topics. The case-study format that is applied throughout the text amplifies the principles of motor control research and demonstrates the transfer of information from research studies to clinical settings.

Incorporated throughout Clinical Applications for Motor Control are the concepts and language of the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice. The text begins with an introductory and historical review of traditional neurophysiologic treatment approaches and new theoretical alternatives. This comprehensive review establishes a foundation for the remaining chapters that address topics such as motor control, learning and development; musculoskeletal considerations; sensory and cognitive systems underlying the production and control of movement; disorders of the control of limb movement; and gait.

Five case studies representing common clinical problems are included throughout the text to facilitate clinical problem solving. This innovative style is geared towards the student who has limited clinical experience, while also serving as a useful reference for the practicing clinician.
