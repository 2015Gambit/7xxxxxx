Yolanda is a woman who is anxiously waiting for her new husband 
to return from fighting in Iraq. Financial struggles force her to move 
back home with her parents Reverend Wallace and Hattie. It will take 
lots of laughter, love and prayers to keep the entire family together 
under one roof.

Shrunk the size as much I possibly could while keeping the same quality
