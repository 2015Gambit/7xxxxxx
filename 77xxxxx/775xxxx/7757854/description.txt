This is Nassim Haramein's original publication of The Harmonic Sphere Flux Resonator. Topics of the book include: Space is Full!, Crop Circles, Ancient Civilizations, Unified Field Theory and Cosmological Observations. 

It is truly amazing to learn of Nassim's current theories and compare them with his original pieces of work from many years ago. It is no wonder he calls his organization The Resonance Project.
