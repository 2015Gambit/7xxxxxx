,5-click,2012-10-26T01:51Z,"Do you have a licence from MS to spread their OS over the Torrent-Network? If not, you're Pirate. Welcome on the Ship."
,crazymadcat,2012-10-26T15:34Z,100% true... You are now our pirate-captain because you donÂ´t have a written permission from MS for distributing its software.
,notapirate,2012-10-26T15:53Z,"I prefer to think of myself as an underground railroad operator. :D I'm just helping Microsoft out by helping their legitimate customers use their product, which they would otherwise have trouble installing, since Microsoft has never bothered to release a disc with SATA drivers on it.

If my images included keys and/or cracks, you certainly would have a case that I was aiding piracy, but as it is, I'm just aiding people who bought Windows XP and now can't use it because their computer is SATA-based, and their original disc doesn't understand it. If someone cracks these installs later, that isn't something I helped in any way. "

,C0leW0rld,2012-11-01T21:38Z,Thanks notapirate! I'm hoping this works for me...One of my customers does not have their repair media for a Lenovo laptop so I am hoping I can use this and just use the key code on the bottom of the laptop. Not sure why there is so much hate on here but I appreciate your work. Cheers.
,notapirate,2012-11-02T20:58Z,"Raj, the add-ons you are requesting can be downloaded from Microsoft's website and installed afterward with a minimum of effort. Adding them to the image would be impractical and make it too large to fit on a CD, which would force using a DVD, and many XP-era computers do not have a DVD drive. DirectX, SATA drivers, Upgrade, and Recovery are included in this set.

I will not split the set, as this is intended for technicians, who would naturally carry both."
