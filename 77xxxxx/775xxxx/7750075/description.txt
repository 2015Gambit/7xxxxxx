The versions of Terragen 2 on TPB are pretty old now, so I scoured the googles and found this very very fresh version.  Bonus! It's 64-bit and includes a keygen!

1) Install either 32 or 64bit version of Terragen 2 Deep Edition
2) Run the XF-TERRAGEN2-KG2.exe keygen, tell it to place the license key file in your "%PROGRAMFILES%Planetside SoftwareTerragen 2 Deep Edition" folder, or wherever you installed Terragen 2

==NOTE== AVG and other antiviruses may detect a false-postive trojan here.  AVG Free detected "Downloader.Generic11.BYBT", a generic and unspecific trojan detected by heuristics, probably because of the fact that the keygen is trying to create and drop a file.  Don't worry, it's not a real virus.  I've confirmed using Sandboxie that it doesn't do anything but create a license key.  If you are worried about a virus anyway, then run the keygen in your favourite Sandbox software.

3) Profit.
