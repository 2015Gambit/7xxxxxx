This release contains are performances by two of the most admired jazz singers of all time filmed during approximately the same period in the earlier phase of her career.

These two shows, show Nina SimoneΓÇÖs brilliant vocals, her gifted piano playing, her magnetism and her customary eclectic choice of material.

Anita O'Day always claimed that a botched childhood tonsillectomy left her incapable of vibrato, forcing her to develop a more percussive style based on short notes and rhythmic drive. However, she demonstrated surprising skill at stretching long notes with strong crescendos. Her singing on this notable performance in Japan is a perfect example of her enormous talents and charm.
