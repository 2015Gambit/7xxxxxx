At the very edge of the Teutoberg Wald, the Cimbrii enclave had lived in isolation under the rule of their last Warrior Queen. The foreboding woods with its malevolent secrets kept others away.

But that soon changes when a Roman army is destroyed and brutal reprisals followed.

An ambitious Roman officer, at the head an Allied Celtic army takes the enclave by force, enslaving it's Queen and people.

But there is something else that lurks in the dark woods. Something that neither the Celts nor the Cimbrii could have ever imagined or even hope to survive the bloody carnage that it would unleash.

Fangs and claws meet Iron and steel. And in the middle of it all is a girl who finds a blood red cloak and with it, a destiny she can hardly fathom.

A destiny that demands sacrifices she's not willing to make.
