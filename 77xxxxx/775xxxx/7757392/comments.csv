You are awesome!"
,NEL117,2012-10-25T05:16Z,SALAMAT! THANKS!
,DByrne291,2012-10-25T06:10Z,"Thank you for posting this and all of your hard work!  BTW, did you get my message that I posted on the Fury MAx 006 torrent?  The pages in that torrent are all there but completely out of sequence.  The first and last pages are in the middle of the book and the first page of the torrent is one of the last pages of the book.  Do you know if that torrent can be fixed?  Thanxxx!"
,whaletail935,2012-10-25T15:15Z,"I actually spent a few hours straightening the pages and adding borders where appropriate for aesthetic continuity.  

I was unaware of the page order problem, as I've not read it.  While I've no idea how to create and upload a torrent (though I suppose I could learn), I'd be happy to email (or whatever) the jpgs to mdusanjay to upload.

Let me know if interested.  And thanks for the original scan."

,Bibliophile_Indian,2012-10-25T15:20Z,"Sorry to disturb, if you can find the rest of Lucky Luke, I'll really be grateful to you if you'll upload them. ""Oumpa pah"" comics (not sure about spelling) in English will be greatly appreciated. God Bless You...!"

TPB doesnt allow the uploaders to edit the torrents..u have to delete it and upload a new one..since the torrent was not corrupted i thought ur warning might help the confused readers..
@ Bibliophile_Indian
I am as much fan to lucky luke as ur ..unfortunately the group which scans them are currenty busy in others projects..i will let u know once they start rest of  luck luke .."
