,Marrow,2012-10-24T16:44Z,"Hi Extremezone,
I registered an account just to thank you for what you have done for me, and this whole community. Whilst many people rant on about seeders/speeds,etc, many fail to thank you for your time and effort that goes into the uploading of these torrents and the maintenance of your site. All of your torrents (I dl'ed +- 15 games from you in the past) always work flawlessly! And for that, on behalf of this whole community, thank you.

Im currently in Australia (Perth) for a while (but reside in South Africa) and if you ever decide to go there, I will be more than happy to offer you accomodation,and show you around...or just take you out for a drink ;)

Peace! :)"

yes my post is useless too.  but it just can't be said enough how retarded many piratebay users are and you're so god damned whiney maybe I can hurt your feelings and you'll go elsewhere, spare everyone else the headache.  who am I kidding there's too many, just wasted time typing this."

baaah no offense just the way you were shown the ""trick"" made me smile ... after yeah me too i already blew my boomerz with those kind of unexpected sounds so i do imagine ...

after moaning for this is quite too much when you think of the great great work those groups of crackers are doing, FLT released his crack what ? 4 days after the game was out so give thx at least you know what i mean ? 

Hope now you are enjoying the game though and that you can still use your boomerz as well .

But when I got to mission 3 Hot Pursuit I found that the camera is stuck looking to the right, I can look left and see 1/4 of the windscreen but not enough to make it through the tight winding alleyways that the target weaves through. I was hoping somebody might have experienced this themselves and had found a way to overcome the issue. Thanks in advance for any and all help and concern. - gasjunkie"

If you have a good firewall with active defense, like Comodo, it will block that, game will freeze and you reboot without knowing it was the firewall blocking a process. So go into windowed game mode before the area where you experience that freeze and allow it in your firewall when it happens again."

FIRST copy your saved game folder from my documents, and save the folder somewere else.

Delete the whole Medal of Honor map, and reinstall using the FIRELIGHT INSTALLER!!!
( RUN IN ADMIN MODE! ) 

When installation is finish, choose no to copy crack, and no to libary!

Then copy the Update folders and files to install directori.

Copy the new crack to same directori.
Then i startet the FAIRLIGHT installer from crack fairlight folder, that i just copied from the crack folder.
Just hit no to find files, no to libary.

Then just run the game in admin mode and start from last save in ""WINDOW MODE"" then it works :D  You can exit window mode after next cutscene that used to crash : D : D"

thanks, this worked for me:

"" Black screen freezing has to do with the game creating processes with a DLL. If you have a good firewall with active defense, like Comodo, it will block that, game will freeze and you reboot without knowing it was the firewall blocking a process.

In the end, I deleted the game, downloaded and re-installed the Medal of Honor Warfighter Eng/Rus repack and was finally able to continue where I left off and complete the level.

The workaround for the issue (and another similar car chase scene later in the game) appears to be by switching the game language to Russian. After the car chase levels are completed, they revert back to English.

I was able to play the game to completion."
