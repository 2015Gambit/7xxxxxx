Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday, October 24 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about efforts to throw the upcoming election in Obama's favor as Anonymous announces plans to ΓÇ£storm WashingtonΓÇ¥ on the day before the election and the establishment media selectively highlights stories on the supposed racism of Americans opposed to Obama's re-election. On today's worldwide broadcast, Alex talks with Washington Times correspondent Joseph Curl about the debates and the election. 

He also talks with writer, activist, and founder of Black Box Voting Inc., Bev Harris, about voting fraud and fixed elections. Harris is the author of Black Box Voting: Ballot Tampering in the 21st Century.
