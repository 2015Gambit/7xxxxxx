This film is about Ken Boyd, a guy who is not long out of a mental hospital who is working at an ice-cream/burger parlor. The people that put him in the mental hospital start turning up dead, killed in horrific ways. He finds out he has a daughter while at the same time that these killings are happening in the town. Meanwhile the local Sheriff is going out with Ken&#x27;s mom and he starts to suspect that Ken is the killer. All the evidence is pointing that way, and Ken&#x27;s estranged daughter catches him in a compromising position. It&#x27;s not looking good for Ken.
