,xhizors,2012-10-23T15:05Z,"cry about it you ungrateful twat. instead of whining like a baby asking for someone else to do it, why don't you go do it... because you won't.

Very watchable, especially if you're not some first class momma's boy. Thanks anon."
,xhizors,2012-10-23T15:09Z,"Also, you look like a bitch

,3htthe,2012-10-23T22:28Z,"xhizors, are you the one who uploaded this? If not, why are you so overly defensive about it? You even went to the lengths to find a picture of the dude, pretty pathetic.

First off, calling him an ungrateful twat and telling him to cry about it is... insanely immature. You're looking pretty pathetic if you have to stoop as low as to insult their personal appearance of which you found by stalking *ahem* I mean just checking their background.

Second, it's bad. I don't know what you did, but Youtube videos have better quality than this. If it's bad, what does this mean? It means improve the quality.

Third, he was giving a heads up to anyone who may consider downloading this. I did, just to check it out. It's quality is decent, I'm sure, but for a decent display, or a high-def display, it's shit. Him rating it low doesn't suddenly mean he's an ungrateful twat, it means the uploader did a bad job of recording it.

Also, ""you won't do it, but I did"" doesn't suddenly nullify his opinion, nor does it suddenly mean the video is good.

Shit quality is shit quality, that's what this video is, and instead of insulting the user, why don't you actually say what's good about the video? Wait, there's not really much good. Blurs during movement, low resolution, blah, blah, you had to stoop as low as to check out the user himself and then insult him. It's pretty dumb and pathetic of you.

Of course, you'll probably read this and be like... oh... he has a point. Nonetheless, I think you will insult me cause you actually have nothing good to say or contribute, just shit that spews from your mouth. Maybe you won't even read this entire comment cause you realize you're wrong.

Shit is shit, that's what this video is, and you insulting anybody on this site doesn't change facts, it just makes you look like a pathetic dumb little bitch. Cry off to mommy, now."
,madgibbs,2012-10-24T00:53Z,"xhizors - LOL!!

4htth - ""I'm sure, but for a decent display, or a high-def display, it's shit.""

LOL go record it your self you  2 can obviously afford it "
,3htthe,2012-10-24T02:40Z,"@madgibbs

Once again, what does me not recording it have to do with anything? And if I can afford it, what more does that say? (Hint: I can't afford it.) You see, this is why the lot of you are pathetic dumbasses, you don't spend a second to think whether or not what you're saying is dumb, and you don't bother to use a single ounce of logic.

No, I don't want to record it. Why not? Cause I simply don't want to. Does me not doing the same thing suddenly this make the video any better? No, the quality is still pretty bad. It is, and always will be bad. A man doesn't have to be a chef to recognize shit food, nor does a man who watches recordings. Got anymore stupid shit to spew out of your mouth? Or are you little kiddies going to stop making dumb comments that you somehow think are funny? I find it pathetic, and pitifully funny that you actually found xhizors' comment funny, it really says something about you and him.

No matter what you say, this video is bad quality. I'm sorry uploader for trashing it like this, but if you have a decent display, I would not recommend it. That's simply it. Nothing else effects the video, which is what this is really about. If you kiddies want to try making snide unfunny ""insults"" towards me, do it elsewhere. The poor uploader has to deal with his video being called shit because two dumbasses couldn't get it through their thick skulls that the video is bad quality and always will be bad no matter what stupid shit spews out of their mouth.

But, sure, go ahead, insult me again, remember: nothing you say will ever change the video. If you're suddenly not here for the video but for insulting people who dislike the video, take it elsewhere, it just shows your immaturity and how pathetic you guys are."
,Bnutface,2012-10-29T08:22Z,"Yeah.....so I wasn't going to say anything but something told me I should.
3htthe: I understand what you're saying but come on, that wasn't necessary. I'm not here to ""dog"" or insult you so don't expect that from these next couple of lines. While what xhizors said was harsh, childish, and waaay over the top in response to the comment that JonzoBear left, was it really appropriate to say all of those things? I can understand being upset or frustrated (I've read my share of ignorant comments/responses) but the route you took wasn't one of humility. Just from your typing patterns I can see that you are somewhat intelligent or at least enough to distinguish between honesty and rudeness.

In my opinion (which no one asked me for I know but hey, this IS the internet where opinions can be posted and read freely) your comment was simply a more intellectual insult of xhizors' bashing of what Jonzo said, which was neither mature nor was it necessary. Your first posted comment could have been summed up, in a nice way, in 1-3 sentences and would have meant more than all of what was said. 

I do agree that stalking a person simply to gain a little insulting support is piteous to say the least but the two comments ""cry about it"" and "" Cry off to mommy"" are both ""insanely immature.""

Maybe xhizors did upload this but I doubt it, even though his defensive comment suggests he did. He refers to the anonymous (anon) uploader in his comment, though that doesn't prove or disprove anything. And he never said ""you won't do it, but I did"". Unless he came back and edited his comment which I believe is impossible here on TPB.
 Still, the only person who REALLY insulted the torrent/quality was you other than Jonzo simply stating [his opinion] ""2/10 quality would not watch...i cant stand this really bad quality"" and the comparison to the quality of YouTube videos. Other than that, no one else said anything close to ""... it's bad. I don't know what you did, but Youtube videos have better quality than this....it's shit...Shit quality is shit quality, that's what this video is....Wait, there's not really much good. Blurs during movement, low resolution, blah, blah...Shit is shit, that's what this video is...the quality is still pretty bad. It is, and always will be bad... this video is bad quality...  the video is bad quality and always will be bad"". I literally just went down your comments and copied verbatim what you've typed.

In closing, your comments above all were more petty and immature than what anyone else here said. Calling others pathetic/kids/kiddies/dumbasses/immature/etc. and saying ""shit that spews from your mouth"" over and over and over does not make you seem smart/cool/mature/awesome/or whatever. In actuality, the exact opposite impression is made. 
Remember, I'm not bashing, I'm simply stating facts, observances and opinions and giving advice to a fellow TPB user. And I wanted to inquire about your comment ""...you don't spend a second to think whether or not what you're saying is dumb..."". As you were typing that, did you stop and think about what you were saying? I honestly want to know, for personal reasons. That is all. I just wanted to watch some AT but instead I typed this. Guess I'll finish S4 sometime tomorrow. To those who did, thanks for reading."
