The Hunger Dogs is a sixty four page graphic novel intended as Kirby's final hurrah with his New Gods concepts.  The themes, as with The New Gods, are very much about tyranny, mechanization, dehumanization.

The Hunger Dogs is often confused and muddled, but whether that's a fault of editorial interference, or Kirby's own creative impulses, is hard to say.  In that weird, hit and miss, slightly mad Kirby way, there can be a genuine power to the Hunger Dogs.  The story is suffused with a bleak melancholy, an apocalyptic aura, a sense this really was Kirby's swan song with the property -- and he meant it.  Like the best of Kirby's New Gods run, there are richly dramatic moments, some quite powerful, and a sense that he really is pouring out his heart and soul, that the themes aren't merely pseudo-pretensions to jazz up the action scenes.

Enjoy, and please seed.
