There's only one way to turn fats into soap, and that's through esterification.  That reaction requires sodium hydroxide (lye) or some other caustic agent, and that's a pretty dangerous substance in concentrated form.

I've been making my own castile soap at home for years.  It's simple but can be hazardous if you don't pay attention to proper handling of dangerous chemicals.

It is fine to post something like this, but don't lard it up with pseudo-scientific statements about how you'll be free of toxins.  You won't be - you'll just be substituting the ones you buy from P&G with the ones you make yourself."
