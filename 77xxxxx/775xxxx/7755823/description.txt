EViews Enterprise Edition contains all of the features of EViews Standard plus support for ODBC and support for the proprietary data formats of several commercial data and database vendors.

As part of the EViews Enterprise Edition, support is provided for access to data contained in relational databases (via ODBC drivers) and to databases in a variety of proprietary formats used by commercial data and database vendors. Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a standard supported by many relational database systems including Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB2. EViews allows you to read or write entire tables from ODBC databases, or to create a new workfile from the results of a SQL query. For time series data, EViews also supports access to FAME databases, both local and server based, Global Insight's DRIBase databases, and Haver Analytics DLX databases. For time series databases, the same, easy to use, EViews database interface is available no matter what the source of the data.

INSTALLATION=
1) Install "EViews Enterprise Edition 7.0.0.1/Autorun.exe" with serial "demo"
2) Apply updates "Updates/EViews71Update.exe" and "Updates/EViews71Update.exe". If it asks you to provide path to your installation directory - simply do so.
3) Choose proper version of crack according to your OS and apply it: "Crack/EV7 Crack XP.exe" or "Crack/EV7 Crack Win7.exe". On Vista or Windows 7 you should launch the crack with admin rights.

Crack should be working even in case of further updates - just apply it again after their installation.

It should be noted, that at least on my pc this crack proved to be more stable than the REDT one, which had a nasty tendency to crash randomly.
