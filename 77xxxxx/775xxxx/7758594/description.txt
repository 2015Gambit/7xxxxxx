Jack Kirby's Galactic Bounty Hunters is a six-issue comic book limited series published by Marvel's imprint, Icon Comics, from July, 2006 ΓÇô November, 2007.

The series was based on unused material Jack Kirby had prepared for issue 
seven of the series, Captain Victory And The Galactic Rangers, as well as early character designs for The Wonder Warriors.  Kirby's daughter, Lisa Kirby, found the material in KirbyΓÇÖs effects after he died.  Michael Thibodeaux persuaded Lisa to work the ideas into a limited series, although initial ideas were for a film, or animated television series.

Enjoy, and please seed.
