,tristalb,2012-11-21T18:33Z,After i downloaded this ~15gb it can't be extracted without a password that I need to take a survey for it!!! And how I am going to find the survey only gives me empty pages or errors?! Anyone pls can email me the pass for archive. Write it here or email me at vmstudio2002@yahoo.com please.
,tristalb,2012-11-21T18:40Z,Survey pasword pls someone write it down
,tristalb,2012-11-21T18:52Z,"Someone is deleting my comments about survey.
This download has a password with a survey that is not listed in details of the up loader (what I hate too much) ""To download torrent password must fill out a survey easy and free."" I tried the surveys but they doesn't work for me and I still need that password before I download another package without forced Survey."
,tristalb,2012-11-21T18:56Z,For a strange reason my first comments delayed too much to display so please count them as one.
,crazykid7,2012-11-21T19:15Z,also looking for password...this is BS...
