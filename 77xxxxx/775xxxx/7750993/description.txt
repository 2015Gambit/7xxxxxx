1998 CD - Would-be King. 128kbps mp3 format.
Irradiate was to be Would-be KingΓÇÖs debut release, as well as, its swansong recording. The album set out to buck the trend of the popular music of the time, and served as a backlash to ΓÇÿGrungeΓÇÖ and all of its offspring. Conceived as an album from the start, ΓÇ£IrradiateΓÇ¥ runs the gambit of human emotions through diverse storytelling and song arrangement. The themes touched on by this rare recording include: isolation, betrayal, moral corruption, and the age old struggle between God and technology.
