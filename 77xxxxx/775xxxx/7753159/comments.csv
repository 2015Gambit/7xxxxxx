,barty14,2012-10-23T21:33Z,Is this legit? Also it won't download past 1.4% because not enough seeds. So seed people.
,shmas1,2012-10-23T22:00Z,2Â˝ hrs in download 1.9% completed
,DerDoktor,2012-10-24T04:20Z,"People, please seed! If I get this downloaded successfully, I will seed 4x download size."
