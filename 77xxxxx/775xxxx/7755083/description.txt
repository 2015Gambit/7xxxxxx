Kevin McCloud's Man Made Home
Kevin McCloud wants to buy himself a beautiful piece of woodland, roll up his sleeves and build a cabin in the woods. He has decided that everything has to be made by hand from his woodland, and if it not, then it has to be sourced from somebody else's rubbish. Together with a hardy band of friends and experts, Kevin is going to reuse, repurpose and recycle almost all the materials for his bold building in rural Somerset. A place where he can unhook himself from the madness of modern life and live in a different way. Can a simple, more creative life make you happier?

WARNING
In this episode, an old gas cylinder was converted into a wood burner to heat the hot tub. Channel 4 would like to make clear that converting gas cylinders in this way can be highly dangerous and can also be unlawful. It should therefore never be attempted by you under any circumstances. Luxury is the one thing Kevin hasn't yet got at his handmade cabin in the woods. It's an off grid marvel, but what he really wants is a hot tub he can relax in, sipping red wine and watching the setting sun with his friends. He heads off to find a unique solution for his hot tub at an airfield graveyard, while making a luxury bath robe out of alpaca wool and fashioning a 'drop down' veranda. At last, Kevin's wondrous cabin looks finished, but he wants to give everyone who has helped him a house warming to remember.
