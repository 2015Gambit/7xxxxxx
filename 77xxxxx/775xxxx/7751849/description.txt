guitar experience in music gaming. By plugging into your PC, you'll
develop real skills and real styles while playing absolutely real music.
Featuring gameplay that automatically adjusts to your personal ability,
Rocksmith's innovative game design makes playing music visually
intuitive and will engage experienced musicians as well as those who
have never picked up a guitar in their lives.

Unlock mini-games to hone specific skills. You'll also be able to choose
from a large catalog of songs in different styles. YouΓÇÖll experience it
all with an honest-to-goodness guitar or bass. Nothing compares to
playing a real instrument.

If you want another language than english - use Launcher.exe, which is
included with the cracked content.

Note:

Rocksmith requires a unique 1/4"-t- USB cable, that is the first of its
kind, which allows users to plug any real guitar with a quarter-inch
jack directly into their console or PC.

Developed exclusively for Rocksmith, this revolutionary cable turns the
guitar's signal from analog to digital, allowing it to be recognized
and played through video game consoles or PC for the first time.

The use of a second Rocksmith Real Tone Cable allows for simultaneous
split-screen cooperative play while playing Rocksmith.

The Rocksmith Real Tone Cable can be bought at your local retailer,
or many online stores to purchase the Rocksmith Real Tone Cable.
