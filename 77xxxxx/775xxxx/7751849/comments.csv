i've added one fix made by Sadler2, i am not sure if it will help ppl with problems with my exe, but still, here it is:
bayfiles . com / file / oOoH / 4sjK7g / RocksmithNoCable3DevCapFix.7z

i tested it on my pc, and like the other one it worked just fine.
if it dont work, then i have no idea what may be causing that error.
btw, this exe is the same as this release, but modified with a cable bypass."
,amoney15,2012-10-24T00:55Z,Didn't work for me. It crashes every I open it.
,ergulo,2012-10-25T07:26Z,Release did not work at least in my case. A white screen appears and asks to close the program. I played the demo had no problems. Now I'll wait for another release to see if it works.
,ergulo,2012-10-25T08:28Z,"Problem solved.
White Screen.
Run as administrator."
,Demonsthere,2012-10-27T15:04Z,"Does anyone know if you have to have the Rocksmith cable, or any cable jack-usb will do ? 
I used the nocable crack, but it halts the program at the point of loading account data. "
