It works fine and is a useful tool - thanks"
,Gcentral,2012-11-14T20:06Z,"This software helped me in converting a dynamic disk to a basic disk, something other disk management programs (including those of Minitool and EaseUS) had failed to perform. Besides that, this suite of hard disk management software seems like a total solution for all disk related issues. So, thanks a lot for making it free and sharing it.

And thanks ""armchair.53"" for that useful headsup. It really helped me understand what I could expect in this download."
