mIRC is a full featured Internet Relay Chat client for Windows that can be used to communicate, share, play or work with others on IRC networks around the world, either in multi-user group conferences or in one-to-one private discussions.

It has a clean, practical interface that is highly configurable and supports features such as buddy lists, file transfers, multi-server connections, IPv6, SSL encryption, proxy support, UTF-8 display, UPnP, customizable sounds, spoken messages, tray notifications, message logging, and more.

mIRC also has a powerful scripting language that can be used both to automate mIRC and to create applications that perform a wide range of functions from network communications to playing games.

mIRC has been in development for over a decade and is constantly being improved and updated with new technologies.

WHY UPGRADE?

-A "Mark As Read" option has been added to the treebar, switchbar, toolbar and MDI popup menus to allow you to clear all flashing/highlighted windows.
-The $hfind() identifier has been extended to allow results to be saved to a @window listbox or passed to a command.
-An SSL connection issue has been fixed that prevented mIRC from connecting to servers with certificates that used unrecognized date formats.
-A hotlink display issue has been fixed that caused text to flicker when hovering the mouse over a link.
-SSL support for Subject Alternative Names (SAN) has been added when verifying whether a certificate is valid for the connection.
-A number of issues with the reload logs feature have been fixed, including incorrect line indentation and missing lines at the end of a log in some situations.
-An issue with the split long messages feature has been fixed which occurred when handling color formats in some contexts.
-An Address Book bug that prevented removal of an existing timed unignore has been fixed.
-The way incremental search works in channel nickname listboxes has been changed so that it behaves more like Windows explorer.
-The /localinfo -p option has been changed to use a random UPnP port outside the first 1056 services port range as some routers block these ports.
-An $inellipse() bug caused by a compiler optimization issue has been fixed.
-Other changes and bug fixes.
