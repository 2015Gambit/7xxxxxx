The rough-and-ready sailors who set out to rescue Jane Porter from hairy man-apes find themselves in need of salvation. Lucky for them, they have the greatest action hero of all time on their side! Tarzan has already rescued Jane, but can he win the confidence of the men he is trying to help? Jane, meanwhile, is torn between her feelings for Tarzan and her desire to return to civilization. She'll have to make a difficult choice in Lord of the Jungle #5: Lost Treasure. Be thankful comics can't transmit smells in addition to images!
