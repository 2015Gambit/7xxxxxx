Extras:

B-Sides and Rarities - Contains a few live versions of songs, as well as some harder to find stuff. Generally not best quality, but still worth a listen.

A Promo Named Marcus - Sadly I don't have much info on it, but it's live versions of some nice songs.


That's all I have and can find. Anybody who's interested to know, I will be trying to get my hands on Earth Rocker when it drops in 2013, and I'll do us all a courtesy by having it up for you all.
