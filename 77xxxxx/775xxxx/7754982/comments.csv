To be fair, I think PBS has done quite a reasonable job here.  However, we should also consider the context. PBS were blatantly trying to make up for their earlier report, which was the very definition of 'false balance' - an uncritical 'he said/she said' balancing an actual scientist against, er...Antony Watts. For that reason alone 'This is PBS' is not enough to dispel worries about the journalism.  Sadly they're not the only journalists to fall prey to denialist fallacies and fantasies, of course. 

Good for them that they've tried to make amends, but the expertly political denialists will inevitably portray it as weak, and a 'cover-up', and a lot of weak minds will believe it, sadly..."
