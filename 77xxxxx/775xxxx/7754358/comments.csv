,xxxaint,2012-10-26T00:10Z,a patch 3 gigs big? i guess it's the 1080 vids. any chance anyone would like to rip this...
,VezRoth,2012-10-29T17:37Z,I've not been able to actually run this and get it applied. There is no .exe in the RAR anywhere. Just a .sfv file and the .001-whatever files.
,VezRoth,2012-10-29T17:41Z,"Completely ignore my previous comment. I'm not the best Pirate in the world. I just found out how to do this, it may help other bad pirates:

Open the .001 file with your archive utility and it'll open up everything. Showing the setup.exe and the .bin files that will allow for full access of this.

Knowledge is help!"
