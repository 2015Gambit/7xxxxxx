Dawkins Sex, Death and the Meaning of Life
More4

SERIES SYNOPSIS

Ideas about the soul and the afterlife, of sin and God's purpose
have shaped human thinking for thousands of years. Religious
rituals remain embedded in the major events of our lives.

In this thought-provoking series, evolutionary biologist Richard
Dawkins asks what happens if we leave religion behind.

He explores what reason and science might offer to inspire and
guide our lives in religion's place. Can science bring understanding
in the face of death, help us tell right from wrong, or reveal
the meaning of life?

If there is no God watching us, why be good?
