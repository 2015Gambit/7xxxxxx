Robot Chicken - Season 6 - Episode 6 (WEB-DL - MP4)
---------------------------------------------------

Robot Chicken is back for its Sixth Season of hilariously insane, wackadoodle,
totally off the wall stop-motion animation! This season's 20 brand spankin' new
episodes will flash images across your retinas and flood your brains with an
overabundance of mind-melting pop culture spoofery that will most likely cause
your head to explode and leave a stain on the couch that will never come out (sorry Mom)!

Produced by Williams Street, ShadowMachine, Sony Pictures and Stoopid Monkey.

Our demented minds see Gadget from Chip 'n Dale in a brand new way; The writers
imagine what could happen if Frosty's hat landed on a few other things; We always
loved "Master of the Universe" so we show two Eternia sightseers getting caught
up in a battle between He-Man and Skeletor.
