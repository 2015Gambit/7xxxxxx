,Cocoabeans,2012-10-27T21:57Z,"Excellent Quality. Seeding for the masses. I won't buy it because rappers make way more money than I do, and they frivolous as shit with their spending. Don't think Meek minds if I cop his shit for free."
,eberthabib,2012-10-27T23:27Z,@Cocoabeans-is your boycott just against rappers or MOST entertainers. Rappers are not the only idiots who blindingly and dumbedly(my invention of a word) waste money.
