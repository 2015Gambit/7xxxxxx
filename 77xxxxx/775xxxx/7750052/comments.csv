What's your fuking problem. If you want that fuking ancient Rar shit then wait for your fuking buddy sceneline. Most of us don't care for downloading in ancient Rar files for just a small file."
,Sadler2,2012-10-23T17:46Z,"Thanks for unpacking, so I can watch the series during the download."
,RedSmurf2,2012-10-24T17:06Z,"He is right. Unpacking shit is a bad idea, it releases the smell. Please leave shit packaged.

On the other hand, I cannot fathom why anyone would badly want to have unwieldy and useless RAR fragments inside a torrent.

P.S.: what's the deal with blocking comments from poor users who have to go through a proxy to circumvent the stupid TPB blocking by their country's ISPs?"
,RedSmurf2,2012-10-24T17:12Z,"Aha, a proxy that is not blocked. Funny how I can post comments through a USA proxy and not through any of the Swedish proxies I've tried.

Now that I can comment: a big thanks for these unpackaged 720p rips. You rule."
