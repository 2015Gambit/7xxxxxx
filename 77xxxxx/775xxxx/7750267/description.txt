NOTE: I do not have constant normal Internet access like all of you, as I am a poor college student.  I steal it from a random neighbor, whose data is capped due to their ISP, Charter, so they do not have it on for more than a few hours a day.  Some days, their Internet is not on at all, so, this upload may take a week, if not more.  Please be patient!
