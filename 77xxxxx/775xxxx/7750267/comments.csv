The video bitrates are ~2000-2500Kbps as opposed to ~5000kbps like in the original upload.  The audio bitrate is 384kbit AAC vs 1510kbit DTS.  Overall, I reduced the size from 30gb to 12gb, and unless you watch this on a huge TV, there really should not be any noticeable difference from this and the SiNNERS release other than random dar areas here and there."

Read the note bud.  I do not have constant Internet due to being a poor college student with no job.  So, I steal Internet from someone who turns off their router when they do not use their Internet.  Be patient, as I only have a few hours of Internet access a day,"

,yigg,2012-11-01T22:15Z,Just played the files and there's no speaking even though there is sound.  Really odd! Guess I'll have to get a diff version.

Not sure what the deal is dude, but these files play perfectly if you use the universal media player that is VLC.  Download it here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html"
