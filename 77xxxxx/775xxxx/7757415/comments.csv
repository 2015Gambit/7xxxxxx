,upx3,2012-10-26T00:33Z,"What's the resolution of GlowGaze's TV rips ??
I can't find it on his website or any of his TV torrent descriptions...
And are these stereo or DD5.1 ?"
,upx3,2012-10-26T09:26Z,"FYI: 720x404, stereo.

Not quite as large as the better compressed, high quality mSD or mRS rips (850x480).

But it'll do in a pinch. Thanks."
