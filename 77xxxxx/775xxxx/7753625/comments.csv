,phase700b,2012-10-25T00:04Z,Thanks from me too. Also hello flyfisher. I've seen your comments on some of the torrents I'm into. You've probably already noticed marcus has quickly moved to the top as far as high quality concert uploads go. benyalux has some good ones too. I have a feeling marcus is just getting started though. Rock on guys ;)
,marcus100868,2012-10-25T00:53Z,Yes  phase700b this is just the start i will upload my a to z collection over 400 music bluray in the best quality and small file size with hd audio when possible stay tuned  also this is not an easy process each file takes 6 to 7 hour process marcus100868.
,phase700b,2012-10-25T01:39Z,"marcus, you're the man! I know, I've encoded most of mine with Handbrake. It takes a long time at full throttle with the fans running high. I keep my videos on 3 4tb external drives and play them with XBMC on a Mac mini feeding a 92"" Mitsubishi. So the high quality is really appreciated.
I want you to know I really appreciate all your work and cpu cycles. This is unusually great work!"
,marcus100868,2012-10-25T02:04Z,No problem i Know i have got roundabout 50 to 60 tb of hard drives  i stream mine to my oppo bdp-95 using twonky server or i use my external hard drive dock to the oppo nice chatting with you and thanks for the comments cheers Marcus.
