[V],Zen_Bud,2012-10-25T20:53Z,Mr.Stifmeister YOU dont understand this stay at the childrens site!
,[qusawa],2012-10-25T21:02Z,Stifmoron hahaha anoXmous is a master encoder and you are a joke and a moron !
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-10-25T21:20Z,"sorry but you dont understand... this is a rip off the full bluray thats on almost 5GB.
You can see how little bitrate the video got...
This got 802 Kbps while the full 720p bluray got 4 223 Kbps... Also the sound has been changed to ACC at 96 Kbps... and the original 720p bluray got DTS at 1 510 Kbps..
So yes if you want a Bluray rip, here you got it :)
While if you want full 720p bluray you should not choose this one.
Just because the video is 1280 x 536 doesnt make it full 720p bluray zen_bud..."
,anoXmous,2012-10-25T21:25Z,"Please calm down.

Every single torrent are in fact a rip from a plastic sources. So it not a big deal !"
[T],SWAXXON,2012-10-25T21:25Z,"shit this bitrate is low, quality kinda sucks donkey balls. This is more like a upscaled dvdrip.

But thxs anyways"
,anoXmous,2012-10-25T21:28Z,"Mr.Stifmeister men du kan ju inte 채mnet, tillbaka till din skolb채nk och 책terkom sen.

,baba.mulon,2012-10-25T23:42Z,"@zenbuddy: Mate, it's you that dont understand. THIS IS A RIP. See the difference between the two, you can use wikipedia. And one more thing... the screens you gave... They are NOT from the video in the torrent."
,QborT,2012-10-26T00:02Z,"Agree with Stifmeister, this shouldn't be labeled BluRay.  It is an re-encode, so should be titled BRRip.  But whatever the P2P kiddies can do as they please, even if it is wrong."

,doritoman,2012-10-26T13:21Z,"tyvm for this. for all you dumb fucks - rip or not, this IS A BLURAY, its a lower bitrate version to reduce file size, but its still a BLURAY, its like you guys are saying a cookie isn't a cookie because its smaller than most cookies, easy enough analogy for you children? fuck. thanks zen bud. a lot of your 1080p rips are hard to procure elsewhere.. and i re-encode them to 720p :)"
,QborT,2012-10-28T22:44Z,"LuLz @ Zen_Bud claiming anti piracy trolls.  Anti piracy trolls would say your rips are fake.  Nobody is saying they are fake, what people are saying is that you label your rips incorrectly.

Adding the term BluRay to the title would indicate that you actually physically had the disk to rip this from.  Which anoXmous didn't.  So anoXmous rips should be labeled as BRRip as they are re-encoded from other people rips.  

It's pretty fucking simple really."

,pink_room,2012-10-30T22:29Z,"This rips are for those people who don't need this super quality or don't have a superbandwidth.. dont have super tv's or whatever. A choice! like other multiple choices in The Pirate Bay. 

Not too hard to understand. 
.

Can be a 720p with low bitrate.

You people have it all and are always complaining! If you dont want this, go for BOZX.

Thanks anoXmous and Zen_Bud"
