Take 6 is one of the BEST known Acapella groups ever. Their music is known the world over and they have won every award imaginable, performed for presidents and worked with some of the best names in the music industry from Quincy Jones, Whitney Houston, Marcus Miller, Stevie Wonder, Queen Latifah to name a few.

Born on the campus of Oakwood University in Huntsville Alabama, Take 6 has more than twenty years of hits and experience to call its own and solidify its standing.

2012 brings a new CD called ONE, which I am sure will bring Take 6 even more success to add to the pot.

In this torrent I have compiled I believe every single Take 6 album they have ever made including their latest.

Enjoy the music, but more importantly SEED THE MUSIC so it lives forever.
