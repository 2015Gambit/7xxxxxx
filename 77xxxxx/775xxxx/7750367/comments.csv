,sad-sam,2012-10-22T06:18Z,"5 gigs, really?"
,tetnem,2012-10-22T06:34Z,great job! thanks once again.

It's a .ts file, meaning ""transport stream.""
Google it, and you will be thankful someone is willing to provide these sometimes rather large files, since most people don't provide their transport streams. Download and watch the episode to see for yourself."

It's in 1080i, bro. It's better than 1080 it's self.  SecTPB give you the episode with highest video and sound quality, so please don't complain about size. Instead enjoy the episode with high video and sound quality. :=)"
,hutness,2012-10-22T06:44Z,"Dang it, I can't put it in a flash drive. *pout*
Thanks anyway. "
,CapnShiner,2012-10-22T06:45Z,"Thank you! Now seed, people, seed!"
,tetnem,2012-10-22T06:46Z,SecTPB is the only mate who give you shows in 1080. I am very thankful for that and always download the shows from him. Keep up with the great job. Thanks again for the episode. :)

What are you talking about? 1080 is better than 1080 itself? That makes no sense. 1080i is not better than 1080p, if that's what you meant. 1080i is almost equivalent to 720p. The ""i"" means interlaced. Basically, a 720p image is digitally expanded to the size of 1080p but with junk lines of pixels between the actual pixels of the image. Currently, in the US anyway, 1080i is the highest available resolution from cable TV."
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-22T07:33Z,"@CapnShiner
Correct, though on a PC, there are video stream deinterlacers built within that can make it quite a decent 1080p emulation, though not as good as real 1080p(unless really well-encoded after ripping). Using Yadif as the deinterlacer in VLC will correct the Top Field Interlacing, and MPC-HC relies on something else, but deinterlaces automatically. Not sure what it uses tbh. TS files in general are meant to provide the highest quality video output your TV provides, so when you encode it down to 720, 480, 400, 396, etc., you have much better material to compress while losing less visual data. If you know what you're doing though, makes for an unbelievable TV experience to watch. :)"
,sad-sam,2012-10-22T07:43Z,"oh i get, and it is really swell that some people sacrifice the effort and bandwidth to do it.  just find it a bit surprising for a semi-formulaict and somewhat predictable drama in its 7th season, that's all.  Always appreciative of uploaders"
,steaz55,2012-10-22T08:21Z,What's .avs file for?
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-22T14:28Z,"@steaz55
AVS files are for Avisynth, an encoding script that is used by typing out commands and directories. I actually didn't mean to include it. It's just a simple little script I use for my 480p encode releases. I guess if someone wants to encode the 1080i themselves so they can watch it anywhere, they can use my AVS script and just edit the directories, using an x264 encoder of their choice."
,expiry5,2012-10-24T17:39Z,"To be honest, I can't really say this looks much better than some of the 720p releases I've watched, and this is much bigger in size and has to be deinterlaced. In some of the images it looks very good, but as a whole I can't say it was worth the size imagewise.

I appreciate the effort from the uploader though, thanks."
,Digeo-PT,2012-10-25T14:41Z,"Wtf?, shit quality!!! lol, how can be possible so much quality thumbs up?!!! 1080i = 420p
DON'T waste time and 5 gigs of your life... "
[T],SecTPB,2012-10-28T21:54Z,Digeo-PT is on the good shit apparently.
