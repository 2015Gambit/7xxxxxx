One example is how Oz is re-told in so many different ways - Big Dog Ink's The Legend of Oz - The Wicked West, Image's No Place Like Home, Antarctic Press's Oz - The Manga, Image's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and finally my favorite - Eric Shanower's The Wonderful World of Oz and its sequels by Marvel.

A great example is what Zenescope has done with the Grimm Fairy Tales series."
