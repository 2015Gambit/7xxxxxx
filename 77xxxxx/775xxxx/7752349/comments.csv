,Vivic87,2012-10-24T12:07Z,"Hi!

I downloaded the file, but it doesn't start. Seems like the app The Witcher 2 is corrupt... =/"
,alexlov13,2012-10-24T13:08Z,Copy the entire folder The Witcher 2 on the hard drive in Application
,Vivic87,2012-10-24T17:48Z,"I already did! Applications > The Witcher 2, then i have Data and The Witcher 2 icon. It doesn't work for me :(("
,mojo-666,2012-10-24T19:01Z,"I always thought Mac people are smart people...amazing how some of you can't even double-click on an app. Anyway, sound will frequently go away and graphical glitches appear. Both require a game restart. Also don't expect anything above low-spec graphics settings to be playable on current hardware. It's not a wine port, it is native, but not performing very well."
,Turingmachine,2012-10-24T21:12Z,If you get the damaged error like i'm assuming Vivic87 got. Make sure you have Allow Applications from Anywhere checked under General in System Preferences/Security & Privacy/General.

I played the xbox version and was hoping to get graphics similar to that but nope. its crazy how i can play most mac games maxed out like mafia 2, even skyrim. which both look much better than there xbox counterpart."

,v1v1,2012-10-28T02:33Z,"what country was this originally downloaded in? i'm experiencing a common issue (black screen) and they've just released a patch which you choose based on download location. 

i'm pretty sure there's no DRM, will we need a cracked version of the patch?"
,713-2388,2012-10-31T04:29Z,"Works great on MacBook Pro Mid-2012
(15.4"" @ 1680x1050 non-retina display, quad-core Intel i7 @ 2.7GHz, GeForce GT 650M + 1GB VRAM, 16GB RAM, OCZ Vertex 4 SSD, OS X 10.8.2)

Just unpack, copy & paste.

However, I recommend to read this guide before playing:
