This is the ASSiGN release and includes working cracks for Massive, Absynth 5, FM8 and updates and cracks for Kontakt 5.0.2 (courtesy of TeamVR), Battery 3.2.3, Reaktor 5.6.2.
The crack for Guitar Rig 5 Pro is not included.


How to install:
Mount all ISOs and install Komplete 8. Install all the Updates. You might get an error while unpacking Reaktor 5.6.2 Update. Seems like the file is damaged.

In the following whenever I mention the Library folder, I mean the root Library, NOT the /User/*username*/Library. 

Reaktor 5.6.2 Crack:
Copy and replace Reaktor 5.app to  /Applications/Native Instruments/Reaktor 5/.
Copy and replace Reaktor 5.component to /Library/Audio/Plug-ins/Components/.
Copy and replace Reaktor 5.vst to  /Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST/.
Copy and replace Reaktor 5.dpm to /Library/Application Support/Digidesign/Plug-Ins/.

Kontakt 5.0.2 Crack:
Open the CRACK folder, copy (replace) Kontakt 5.app in /Applications/Native Instruments/Kontakt 5/ to your hard drive /Applications/Native Instruments/Kontakt 5/. Do the same with the other files. Just copy (replace) them to the right directories just like in the CRACK folder.

Battery 3.2.3 Crack:
The same directories as Reaktor 5.6.2. (Only the Battery 3.app has to be copied to /Applications/Native Instruments/Battery 3/)

Massive, Absynth, FM8 Crack:
Files in APP go to /Applications/Native Instruments/*Filename*/.
Files in AU go to /Library/Audio/Plug-ins/Components/.
(You might have to replace the files one by one if you are asked for your password.)
Files in RTAS go to /Library/Application Support/Digidesign/Plug-Ins/.
Files in VST go to /Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST/.
