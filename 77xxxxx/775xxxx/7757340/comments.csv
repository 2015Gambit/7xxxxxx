,pipco_2,2012-10-28T05:35Z,"ok,  SOLVED "" iLok error ""

make sure ilok drivers actually install,  mine would not install, solved it by doing this =

1) From Windows' Add or Remove Programs feature, uninstall any listing of ""License Support"" and ""Interlok driver setup""

2) Reboot the system

3) Disconnect any iLoks connected to the system

4) Run and follow the install instructions of the Tpkdx64Setup.exe file found in the Drivers folder of the installx64.zip file linked here and downloaded. It is very important that no anti-virus or Internet monitoring software (especially Kaspersky) is running.

5) Restart the computer

6) Run and follow the install instructions of the LicenseSupportSetup64.exe file found in the Components folder of the installx64.zip file linked here and downloaded. It is very important that no anti-virus or Internet monitoring software (especially Kaspersky) is running.

7) Restart the computer

I took the PT hd 10 beta 9 after textado, and popped the PT 10.0 downloaded from the site avida gulgamento and then just took the control panel, only the plug-in PT.

The big move is; went on workspase she was active with the HDs usually did a test with audio in a session to see if diparava with the same session time ran ok here and so far this ok.
For those who need audio triggers (loop) in the session with the same time there is a great result, and then I will cut and did ums ums and took a crossfade chift the message disappeared alt 3 Idiot violção of audio workspase. no longer appears that shit pissing and consolidated normal without negative message.
For those who want to enjoy and download the tool from the same site and click this trial before activating the beta 9.
will open the instruments xpend least, has already made ​​the library texte others open.
Reminder: once in a while comes a message about violation but does not lock nor lose anything. it saves everything normal. Remember the message that appeared when workspase was not activated
(lowered when any audio in the session) when finalizing the session to save the the work was a message saying the audio unsaved. descobrimeto disappeared after that closes the session normal.
The only thing that still deconforta is this message that dice (rape) but that appears not lock nor hinders.

i7 2600k
32 GB RAM
Nvideo Quadro 4000
256 GB Solid State + other non OS drives
850w PSU
etc, etc

I'm a designer, not a musician, however my brother is a musician and were trying before we buy just like most of you. :) Currently using cubase/Ivory and were looking into a better setup.

1.Do I need Avid hardware?(I have none)
2.On install there are 2 versions to chose from. Which is best for a setup like mine, if any?
3.Should I just use PT 9?

Thanks for your help and of course a big thank you to the uploader and the kind soul who undoubtedly worked tirelessly on this release."

Thanks again for your time."

I own Pro Tools 10 with Avid hardware. If your serious about what to buy, the choice is really what your bro prefers as a DAW.I have been a user since 8 LE. I would upgrade to HD, only if you truly need zero latency. Otherwise non-HD would work.

Does not matter, but choose first one(HDX)"

Forget the ChingLiu version. Do as Olarila said:

1. Download the 10.3.2 installer at http://secure.digidesign.com/services/avid/kb/downloads.cfm?digiArticleId=43692

2. Download this patch

3. Run the installer. I had to reboot two times for some reason before step 4.

4. Extract and run this patch.

5. Open ProTools 10.

No hardware required other than a univeral asio driver which you can get here: http://www.asio4all.com/

if you've eliminated the plugs try starting with a new blank session and adding parts of the old session till you find the culprit."
