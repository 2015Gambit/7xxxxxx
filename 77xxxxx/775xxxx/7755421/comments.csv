,PPierce34,2012-10-30T18:23Z,"@ Zoticus, you're downloading a torrent and you've never heard of an album leaking before it's release date?"
,JamsBand,2012-11-13T02:46Z,well this is either not the full album or it is not the new Psychedelic Pill recently released by Neil and Crazy Horse that is a 2 cd compilation of old and new songs.
,JamsBand,2012-11-13T02:55Z,"My bad to rajabmm. This is the complete album. Its just not broken up in 2 cds like some others. Thanks for upload.
