,wroomster,2012-10-24T21:53Z,"Don't bother by deleting that file, game will make another one when started. Second thing EXE file have SERIAL check within.
It doesn't matter if you are on internet or not, or that u uncheck or check online news, or you block exe file with firewall.
Wait for the CRACK!"

,Ellcz,2012-10-24T22:17Z,I can't see comments. :-/ 
,Ellcz,2012-10-24T22:19Z,"Yeah, i know. I SAID you CAN, not you MUST... :) And this trick worked for me 100%. Game working again, and you dont need crack. Btw, if you have crack, and update your game, crack dont work."
,Ellcz,2012-10-24T22:24Z,"One thing: Game check key, yes... But if game doesn't have internet, game doesn't know if this key is blocked or not. :)

I said, this will work 100%. "
,Dewarton,2012-10-24T23:38Z,"Playing with internet off works for me in version 1.1.1, boring to deactivate internet everytime you wanna play tho."
,grdzero,2012-10-24T23:56Z,"@Ellcz - This won't work. Every update will come with a serial check, banning those already known. And for what I know the game will have a lot of updates. Two of them to be released only in this week. So, instead of tricking it every time and wait, I just bought the game."
,grdzero,2012-10-25T00:00Z,"Ellcz - Ok, keep deleting comments. You are cheating people to believe you."
,Ellcz,2012-10-25T00:12Z,"Ah, i have some problems in 1.1.1 version of game... I dont know. its so boring."
,prince__vlad,2012-10-25T00:38Z,"for Woomster:

Dude you don't have a clue, you talk stupidities. I never disconnected from the internet and I play it. However I unchecked since the beginning those two internet options and , of course I didn't fall for that streamradio boobytrap of them. I am on level 20 now and everything is fine so far. I won't use the 1.1.3. for a simple reason: the modifiations made in the patch won't worth it installing it."
,Ellcz,2012-10-25T01:48Z,"I know, this update is not much of anything."
,acoc12,2012-10-25T03:38Z,"to function properly, windows 8 and windows 7, create a blocking rule in the firewall, inbound rule and rule out, so will have no problems."
,ralphwald,2012-10-25T08:14Z,"Ok guys, the game only â&#x201A;Ź29.95 / $39.95 cost. Why not buy it, and no more ""activation solve""... "
,Zebra667,2012-10-25T19:48Z,"Better yet, how about YOU by it, ralphwald, for all of us as a great charity gift? If not, then STFU! Obviously if you're here, then buying the fucking thing is the last thing on your mind, yes? "
,jontoupin,2012-10-26T05:13Z,Hey kursvirkov asshole your fuc.ing file is a virus and the generated keys don't even work  don't bother download it guys
,wingo44,2012-10-27T10:37Z,"not install patch 1.1.3.

run with patch 1.1.1 and block game in firewall and run fine. 
run level 18 and not problem."
,008Ivan,2012-10-27T11:57Z,DO NOT INSTALL this patch if you don't wanna problems with activation
,Ellcz,2012-10-27T17:21Z,Virus? Are you kidding me? LOL... Its official patch from SCS soft.
,MoneyGuy,2012-10-27T21:59Z,"9. DONT USE STREAMED RADIO IN GAME!

What's wrong whit that, what the game checks cd-keys even through radio :D"
,dredre999,2012-10-29T03:14Z,"@moneyguy...


yes it does, It connects to the internet when using streaming radio...whenever the game connects to the internet it checks activation."
,muceas,2012-10-29T05:56Z,"Stay away from this patch, it will block all the serials released so far."
,THANGDL,2012-10-30T09:47Z,"- At first time it did not work (...incorrect key).
- I restarted windows. Then i actived it again and working perfectly. So, thanks for share!!!"
,Neogranadino,2012-10-30T21:25Z,"FUCK FUCK FUCK YOUUUU!!!!!!!!

I installed this shit following your shitty instructions and now I can't play the game.
I tried uninstalling it, installing the .1.1.1 update, restarting the system EVERYTHING and still I can't get it to activate once again (being lvl 22). 

YOU JUST FUCKED UP MY GAME INSTALLATION 'Ellcz'!!!!

FUCK YOU A THOUSAND TIMES MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!!!"
,skojfoppa,2012-10-31T09:09Z,Neogranadino: Instead of screaming FUCK YOU....I suggest you to buy the game and I promise youÂ´ll never have this problem?
,daym0ss,2012-10-31T13:33Z,"Yes, DO NOT INSTALL THIS PATCH, it will breake your game and it doesnt fix anything important"
,mandruf,2012-11-01T06:01Z,"Someone needs to make a proper crack.
All the serials are being banned already."
,uros81,2012-11-01T09:59Z,"i`m sorry, but it does not work. i`ve tryed all things you wrote and still got the message to activate game after some 20mins of playing offline, on computer without internet connection."
,chrede2750,2012-11-01T18:23Z,"Ellcz...  the cd key dosent work!!! 
DONT FUCKING DOWNLOAD THIS AND DONT FUCKING UPDATE THIS GAME YET!!! 

the update will fuck the game up and say this is a DEMO !!! 
just make backup off ur mods and save.. then uninstall the hole game and then install it to the first version .. put u mods and save into the folder! AND THEN U CAN PLAY ! :) "
,chrede2750,2012-11-01T19:04Z,"
delete the folder in documents! 
uninstallation does not delete the folder and it's cdkey will register to the folder in dokuments! 

after that delete euro truck 2 and install the game in version 1.1.1 from (( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7745176/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2_FULL-P2P )))  ;) and then put your saves and mods into the folder again! 
so it works again in 1.1.1 :)"
,chrede2750,2012-11-01T20:51Z,"okay. it does not matter what you do now!
I played 1H.30M and now says the same (demo verison buy the game)

have studied something on the net .. it is cdkey / serial that is blocked from the publisher ... so it has nothing to do with the update ...
it may be him who lent it out to play with his bought cdkey / serial .. but we must just wait for crack! :) I'm sorry I wrote it before .. but it worked fine on 1h.30m .. but have the same problem now! :/ Purchase the game and support them otherwise wait for the crack! :)"
,OrangJawaTengah,2012-11-03T19:07Z,"Attention All!
The Patch doesnt work after I Apply this patch to the Game.
then I Uninstall the game (sacrificing the savedata -_-) and re-install it and apply this and its WORK!
1. Install the game (dont start after installation finished)
2. Install this Patch
3. Run Game
4. Use the 7KWDE-K9MV0-KFM10-ACJ2Q-HY9KZ key inside

Note: Before I follow 'Ellcz' Instruction the game turned in to ""Demo"" Version after I reach lv 14
If its not happen again i would to seed for 1 day due to my slow internet, if it happen again.... so... F*** U Ellcz. LOL :D"
,OrangJawaTengah,2012-11-07T11:35Z,Just the same. It's doesn't work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,crack25,2012-11-15T09:56Z,"Do you download this game Euro Truck Simulator 2 right all the cd keys are blacklisted or crack does not help, and they figured out that no firewall blocking the game does not help, it should be a real crack crack to make it work, let's play, which bought a copy crack from the master PC CD-DVD rom."
,crack25,2012-11-15T10:05Z,"Do you download this game Euro Truck Simulator 2 right all the cd keys are blacklisted or false v.1.1.1 crack does not help, and they figured out that no firewall blocking the game does not help, it should be a real crack crack to make it work, let's you bought game copy crack with a master PC CD-DVD rom."
