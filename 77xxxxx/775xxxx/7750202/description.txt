Nouveau Calls is the fourteenth album by rock band Wishbone Ash. It is an all-instrumental album and is the first in 14 years to feature the original lineup of the band.

In 1987, IRS Records founder and original Wishbone manager Miles Copeland III began a record label entitled "No Speak," which featured all instrumental music. In order to launch the label successfully, Copeland needed a big name band that would bring publicity to the project. Copeland approached Andy Powell and Steve Upton about having Wishbone Ash release an all instrumental album. However, he stated the album must mark the reunion of the original Wishbone Ash.

For the first time in 14 years, Andy Powell and Steve Upton joined forces with Martin Turner and Ted Turner. Fans were beyond elated to hear that the original Wishbone Ash was back in action, however, reactions were mixed because there were no vocals on the new album. The tour of 1988 was a huge success, as the band played large venues for the first time since the late 1970s.

The title Nouveau Calls is a pun on "No Vocals"
