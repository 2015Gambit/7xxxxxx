Penis Envy 
This ground-breaking series explores all things penile. The penis is the organ most central to a man's sense of self, and the quest for penile perfection has driven some men to incredible lengths.


1)  The Perfect Penis 
Here's another interesting docu for all you medical students. The penis is the organ most central to a man's sense of self, and the quest for penile perfection has driven some men to extraordinary lengths. And I'm afraid that's meant quite literally! It's all about the length-issue here: pumps, stretching exercises, enlargement operations, silicone injections, what some blokes do to push their pecker to the limit just gave me the willies. In this program you'll meet Russian surgeons who chopped off a man's penis and re-grew it on his arm, Mike Salvini whose penis has real pulling power, Dean who's considering penis enlargement (willie or won't he), a bunch of blokes whose only qualification is that they have one and have thought long and hard about it, and to top it off Mister Mark for whom too big is just not big enough.

2)  Chopped Off: The Man who Lost his Penis 
In 1993 one short brutal act guaranteed John Wayne Bobbitt a notoriety that he can never shake off. His wife Lorena sliced off his manhood with a kitchen knife, drove off and discarded it in a field. What followed - one the biggest live TV trials of all time - turned the former marine into an unlikely celebrity. Twelve years on, after brief porn career, a job as a Las Vegas minister, a stint as a limo driver for a brothel and a spell in jail, film-maker Vicky Hamburger went to find out what happened to the man with the world's most famous penis.

3)  The Worlds Biggest Penis 
No doubt about it, society celebrates the big penis. Seen as a sign of adequacy, virility and manliness, those lucky enough to be well endowed are heralded by both sexes and all sexualities. As women have always maintained, and men have always thought, size matters, but not in the way that most of us imagine. Sometimes having a Big Johnson is a bigger problem than you'd guess. Meet the men, including the man claiming to have the World's biggest penis, who reveal there is a bittersweet side to nature's gift, and who lift the veil on a taboo subject and to show the reality of what it's like to have what all men dream of.
