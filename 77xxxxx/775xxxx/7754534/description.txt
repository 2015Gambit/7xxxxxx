Kilokhan, evil digital alien, is wreaking havoc in the real world by poisoning electronic systems with mega-virus monsters!  The only people who can stop him are computer whiz Sam Collins and his rock 'n' roll band.  Together they enter the digital world, transform into the Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad and battle the electronic villains!

In "Do Not Reboot Till Christmas", even Malcolm and Kilokhan are in a giving mood!  They've wrapped an exploding mega-virus monster in a mega-pile of gifts and planned a light show to illuminate Servo's data base and destroy him!

And now "Kilokhan is Coming to Town" to take on Servo!  Only one will survive.  Does Servo stand a ghost of a chance?


Sorry for the shitty quality, I ripped this from the best VHS that I could find.
