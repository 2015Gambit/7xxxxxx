[V],wushdishmeen,2012-10-30T06:39Z,"Sorry guys but the show will not be posted.  I am dealing with hurricane sandy.  New York has 20 million homes with no power.  There is massive damage and I don't know when the power will return.  I have no way of posting the show.

Hopefully I can get them to you soon.  Bye for now"
,Fitzy727,2012-10-30T06:55Z,Yeah....  I'm starting to think that wush hasn't uploaded today's shows on TPB is because of that hurricane :(  gg
,Fitzy727,2012-10-30T06:58Z,"Bah, should have looked at the comments before I posted XD  I knew it was because of the hurricane because almost every show is uploaded around the same time.  Stay safe wush!!!!!!"
