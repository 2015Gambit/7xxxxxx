Can anyone get OptiFine working on this though? I have a couple older computers that get pretty bad performance without it and it refuses to work. I just get a black screen when trying to start Minecraft after installing it (I've installed it multiple times before, I am not missing any installation steps)."
,w4r3zh4ck,2012-10-25T22:13Z,This game gets better and better !!!! Definitely deserves the support. Will buy it one day when I have money

,Professor F,2012-11-03T20:05Z,"I've installed this and OptiFine as usual. As usual I changed some settings and got a black screen. Tried again and game just hung. What I did next - in ""Other..."" settings restored everything back to defaults and still got crashed game. I changed Adv OpenGL to fast - game crashed (as I expected, 'cause I have OpenGL 2.1). Changing this back to OFF gave me what I wanted - OptiFine is working, game is very smooth. Hope this helps to someone.

You might ask what is my video to support only OpenGL 2.1. The answer is easy though. Out of curiosity I ran Minecraft under VMWare :) and it works."

,deadwarrior63,2012-11-10T17:27Z,"Im not going to dispute the quality of the torrent but there is a simpler alternative. Google: Mineshafter (its a mineshafter.appspot link).

Now go to ""LOGIN"" and use you google account to login. Then under ""CONNECT YOUR MINECRAFT ACCOUNT"" connect your official minecraft username and pass (you dont need to buy minecraft first) then go to ""DOWNLOADS"" and click ""MINESHAFTER PROXY FOR PLAYERS"". Save to desktop and double click it.. it then downloads a cracked minecraft jar and a minecraft jar.. wait for minecraft to load up, login with your username and pass (it will then update to latest version (1.4.2)..

Once done it will load minecraft.. next time you open it dont enter a pass only a username and click play offline (if you login with your password you only get to play demo)

Hope this helps and sorry for the essay ;)
