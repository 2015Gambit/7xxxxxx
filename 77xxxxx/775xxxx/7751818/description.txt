Story
------

Takeru Ohyama, a young, normal, perverted minded guy, got accepted and goes to a school that, unknown to him, is where combat and magic is used and taught. Arriving at the school (which was once only for girls), he meets Haruko Amaya, his childhood friend, after three years, Inaho Kushiya, a girl who says she's his fianc√©e, and Kodama Himegami, a blonde who wants to kill him. Finding out that there are many girls there that just don't like him, he is told that everyone there uses a special magic ability while using an item or weapon called a Maken. Later, he finds that no Maken is acceptable for him and doesn't know what to do, since in this school the students get into duels that showcase their magic and combat power, of which he seemingly has none.
