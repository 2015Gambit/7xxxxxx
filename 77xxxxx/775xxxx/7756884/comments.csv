Including Instructions on Installing. Updates Work!

Contact me at NGXTech@yahoo.com

I have other MAC stuff also. Logic Studio 9 (Licensed), Final Cut Studio 3 (Licensed), Komplete 8 Ultimate, and more...

Why waste hours or days or months trying to get it?
It is October 2012 going into November!"

Duplicate files spread out the seeding, which slows things down for everyone. They also increase the clutter on this site. Also, you needed to state which version of 2011 this is (14.0. 14.1, etc.). Microsoft issued significant updates to the original product.

Please search next time before you upload, and do not upload files if they are already here and already well-seeded."
