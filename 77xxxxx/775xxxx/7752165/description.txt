Criticism of the Western Civilization - Collection 22 (Cold War):

Although the two major super powers (America and Russia) never faced each other in a direct war during the Cold War, the world (especially the Third World) endured great sufferings as the proxies of the two super powers did the fighting. The Cold War era is defined by Vietnam war, the missile crisis in Cuba (that almost caused a global nuclear war), and numerous coups and counter-coups that often resulted in armed conflicts and civil wars in many parts of the world. 

Tyrannical regimes were often installed (in countries in Africa, South America, Asia and the Middle East) that caused great sufferings to their own people. Many of these tyrannical regimes are still in power today.
