NOTES:

Yet another video from HP ...mans on a roll,thank you.
Video itself was ok,but like all the other ones is of a small res and has faults ..eg black borders,some
cam movement,glares etc..
Audio was decent cam audio ...just needs cleaning a touch.

WORKDONE:

Took the video and first thing was to crop the borders ...did notice half way through the right and bottom
borders got slightly bigger ( 5 pixels roughly ) ..so opted to crop to the lowest border points.
From there i upscaled the video and fixed the bad AR....now doing this makes any faults stand out even more.So 
needed to firstly run a HQ smoother on some high settings ( took 10 fooking HRS YIKES ) then i tweaked the colouring,
then moved onto the brightness/contrast/intest ,which helped tone down the glares whilst keeping a decent black contrast.
Finally needed to add some life back into it so used a sharpen filter.

Audio stripped and dropped in AA and then changed the EQ bands ...gave it some more bass,made vocals cleaer and lowered the
hiss.Now the hiss is still there and could be removed totally...but it would have made the audio a tad duller,so opted to leave
it.
Once done it was a case of resaving to mp3 and remuxing to our encode.

Enjoy folks :)
