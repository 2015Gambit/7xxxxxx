Just unrar and put .exe in the Torchlight 2 directory.. And yes, overwrite."

Checked file on some anti-virus and checked Pinbax's account (apparently he has some nice uploads) so this is safe :) (feel free to do the same as i did)

@Pinbax: Thank you VERY MUCH for this update, i was afraid that pirates would have to wait until the next big update to fix the current issues ^^"
