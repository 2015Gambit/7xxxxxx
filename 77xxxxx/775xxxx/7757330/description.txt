The designers have the chance to use their design skills for the benefit of others. They must create an on-trend, commercial white shirt and accompanying outfit for the Witchery White Shirt Campaign, which helps raise money for the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation. The stakes are high as the winning shirt will be manufactured and sold in Witchery stores throughout the country and will also be featured in Madison magazine. The prize on offer is huge. Who will nail the brief, and who will be out?

A big thank you to all original cappers and posters
