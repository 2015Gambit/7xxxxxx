[T],rkstr,2012-10-25T03:57Z,I will upload this every week when its made available to me.If this isn't soon enough then thats not my issue.Demanding the next episode in the comments will not make it come any faster and will in fact deter me from continuing to upload the program.Thank you

Thank you so much."
,abdorayi,2012-10-25T21:22Z,thanks for the upload... would be super if i could find these in better quality. 720p would be amazing. *dreams*
,itsmeeloise,2012-10-25T23:34Z,"I don't care when you upload it, rkstr. And I'm fine that it isn't in 720 (watching through Apple TV). Just grateful that you are our only source of this great Aussie show. Thank you!
