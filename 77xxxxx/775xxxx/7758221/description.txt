Got 2 chicks coming in today for some ambush threeway action. They just don't know about it yet. Still no new office yet but the opportunity was too good to pass up. Quiet Sydney isn't too happy when tattooed tornado Brittania walks in and steals the show. I can practically see the dollar signs in Brittania's eyes. She's is all about some first time lezzie action for the cameras. Found Sydney on that compensated dating site so she's game, too. Money, brothers. It's everything. I get 'em to go do down on each other, make them suck me off and take turns banging them. Brittania is overly eager to please and says she'll do ANYTHING to help with this demo tape. Anything? Why, I do feel like some ass fucking is in order. That'll surely shut her up. She kept talking about it like it's the greatest thing so now it's time to put up or shut up. Preferrably both. Unfortunately she's totally into it and still keeps talking up a storm. Sydney can't get a word in and she's just going through the motion at one point - she knows she can't compete for these jobs with her flamboyant enemy. Truth is, they both lost the game. 'And There Is No Job' is the BRCC tag line for a reason...
