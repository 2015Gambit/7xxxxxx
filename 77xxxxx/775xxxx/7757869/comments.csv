You're being darn unclear. There's a web-dl six days old, which means the next one shoule be tomorrow or the next day.

Forgive me for not keeping track (can't search comments), but didn't you ask for ""1 & 3"" because of pixelation when only ""1 & 2"" had aired - so I uploaded both - only to see you say ""1 was fine, just 2 was pixelated"".

So, here's the deal - if there are pixelation errors (this goes for anyone), document the show, episode & location of the error and I'll try to reward your efforts with a WEB-DL XVID AVI. No guarantees.

I wish I could just grant everyone's wish - but I have limited bandwidth and what I watch gets priority, then nailing down more of LOL's pixelation crimes.

============= Rant Mode On:

I started doing this solely because of LOL's damaged goods. A little bit of me balked at a whole community abandoning the AVI crowd. AVI is SO much more versatile. Recently sent a friend a sample of ""Red Dwarf"" because I had an AVI and VirtualDub. Can't do that with MP4.

The bottom line is this:

For about a year XOR used to post chopped up encodes.
XOR finally went away.
Others stepped in and provided quality where XOR had only provided damage.

The theory is - get rid of LOL and all the other great (conscientious) cappers will fill in the void.

I suspect ""The Scene"" keeps people in line by contolling the distribution network and would guess that LOL is a central part of it - so my theory may not work.

But at least I can spread the word that there is quality to be had and nobody needs to put up with damaged goods.

It's a lonely sojourn, just one guy with 2Mb/s upload speed.

But I do what I can,
