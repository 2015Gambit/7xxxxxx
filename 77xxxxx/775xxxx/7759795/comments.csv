IMO this is an ""OK"" rip.  The picture and sound are fine and there are no glitches or synch issues.

However, IMO, when they compressed it it dropped too many frames and its kind of noticable.  I had to fiddle with VLan to get it a bit smoother. Being an action movie I want really smooth vid. I generally go with  the 720 because they usually arent as compressed and run smoother but thought for this film I would try 1080."

If not what am I doing wrong?"
,mt_phile,2012-10-27T01:11Z,Thank you Revisionist.

The.Amazing.Spider-Man.2012.1080p.BluRay.X264-AMiABLE [PublicHD] (Size: 9.84 GiB)

For me, there is no difference at all. So it's better to download the 10 GiB version."
,t_amante,2012-10-31T19:19Z,"I hate this huge black bars around the screen. It feels like you're watching the movie with your eyes almost shut. Surely not what I was expecting after a 10GB download. Besides that, it has a good quality."
,lif3isfr33,2012-11-07T02:09Z,@Goldfire1986 what the fuck do you use?
,shmimbadad,2012-11-11T04:49Z,"@t amante
That's called cinematic widescreen resolution. 2.4:1 aspect ratio. That's why the 1080p resolution is 1920x808 instead of 1920x1080. So, unless you get a 2.4:1 monitor, you better get used to it. Just about all decent HD movie rips are going to be like that, because it's how the movies are actually filmed. If you get something that fills your whole screen, it's because it's letterboxed on the sides, and you're not getting the whole picture."
,cipherpunks,2012-11-12T01:49Z,"OK what's the deal here? Is this BluRay disk mastered incorrectly? I downloaded another rip and the brightness is so low I tried to correct it, but the correction was so huge that it caused banding in broad flat tonal areas. I know 3D movies are notorious for being dim, but this 2D version is even dimmer than what I see in theaters. I mean, look at this one still:

Now here's what it SHOULD look like, I corrected it in Photoshop.

I checked the histogram, the brightest white in that still is at 160 out of 255, when it should be at 255, the max. This video is using only 62.5% of the available dynamic range of brightness from black to white. The brightest white is 37% grey. This is totally fucked up. Is this a problem in the rip? Or was the film deliberately mastered in a terribly low brightness? Maybe they deliberately lowered the brightness, to simulate the poor brightness of 3D projection systems? Something is wrong here."
