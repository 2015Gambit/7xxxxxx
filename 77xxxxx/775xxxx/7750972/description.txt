Jake and the Never Land Pirates is a musical interactive animated Disney Junior show created by Bobs Gannaway, based on the successful Peter Pan franchise that was in turn based on the famous book and play by British author J.M. Barrie. 

This series, a new take on the classic "Peter Pan'' story, follows the Never Land adventures of a group of child pirates -- Jake, Izzy and Cubby -- as they try to outwit Captain Hook and Smee. The show features original music performed by the Never Land Pirate Band.

Just two new episodes this time, the double length special "Jake Saves Bucky" that features another appearance of Peter Pan, and this year's Halloween episode.
