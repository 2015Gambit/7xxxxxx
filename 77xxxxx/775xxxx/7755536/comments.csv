this must be from their GAme release update' which is useless, their release crashes too!

Reloaded will proper this! Just wait for Reloaded"
,minime93ireland,2012-10-24T16:35Z,"The purpose of the update that was released day one is to try and address crashing issues. It's a game issue, not an FLT issue."
,RMJ113,2012-10-24T18:24Z,how do you say?  Oh yes IT DIDN'T WORK!

,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-10-25T22:46Z,"Stop fucking complaining, if you don't like having a CTD here and there buy the fucking game and shut up."
,Hancock79,2012-10-26T00:16Z,"seriously, bunch of ungrateful crybabies."
,Hackerpcs,2012-10-26T02:01Z,Is it a scene release? I can't seem to find it in any release log type site.
,Hancock79,2012-10-26T06:16Z,"yea FLT is a release group.  this is actually in the full FLT release, a folder on one of the iso's I think it's the 2nd one."
,Hackerpcs,2012-10-26T21:12Z,"You're right Hancock, it's the same as Update_common.zip in the DVD2/Fairlight.
@3R01 you should mention it that FLT automatically applies this update and only FLT users need it. Thanks anyway ;)"
,Hackerpcs,2012-10-26T21:12Z,"I meant only P2P user need it, typo."

,iGrenade,2012-10-29T03:43Z,"this ""update"" does jackSHIT if you've already installed the FLT version.

there's currently NO FIX for the train explosion cutscene blank screen problem."
,FieroGT,2012-10-29T17:44Z,"anyone get past the ending of hello and dubai? after u get hit with that suv ?i keep getting a crash there...  had the same prob after the 1st chase, but a new crack fixed that one. "

,mrmouth,2012-10-31T17:08Z,"It could have to do with your firewall or AV blocking MOHWD, which is not the exe to start the game, but a different exe that exists in the Game subfolder. It seems that MOWHD  actually creates processes at certain points during the game. So if it cannot access it you get the black screen freeze, or a CTD. "
