,bobert-bobert,2012-10-22T13:53Z,"IMMERSE pulled a fast one on us, this is definitely not 720p quality, it's like they upscaled from 480p or encoded it badly or something... damn."

,rhenan,2012-10-23T00:18Z,FAKE! Not 720p HDTV x264 5.1ch!
,Fitzy727,2012-11-06T09:36Z,"The Walking Dead has a deliberately grainy look, it's shot with 16mm film.  This IS 720p HD.  You think not?  Go download a non HD copy and you will notice the difference."
