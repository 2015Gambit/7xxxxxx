,VonJok,2012-10-24T12:59Z,"Wait for a trusted uploader, with the skull, it is more secure"
,halestarr,2012-10-24T13:08Z,"There are a couple dozen seeders, will seed when complete. Also, false positives are a norm with these kind of releases!"
,russianhornybear,2012-10-24T20:06Z,4 gb patch ?game without videos same size lol . This game epic fail from start. Perhaps most of this huge patch(according to change log ) fixed 1080p videos. Original XCOM 13mb and working good xD So fuck this thing.
,tstreamer,2012-10-24T20:51Z,"Not interested in some RIP pal. Who cares your RIP is 4GB? 3.45 GB for a 12GB game. Unlike some updates on the net like sleeping dogs this is an acceptable size. This is not an epic fail. It's the best game since terror from the deep and a decent XCOM was much needed, after UFO's trilogy of crap. And in case you didn't noticed XCOM EU uses UT3 engine. Go ahead and try to do like Fireaxis; using a first person engine to create a tactical and strategy game. It is worthy of 3GB update"
,GATOQSECOMIO,2012-10-24T22:11Z,WORK??
,brutal_product,2012-10-25T01:08Z,confirmed working and kept old saves on win7x64. 1080p movies/cut scenes look great. thx
,Taosinky,2012-10-25T01:46Z,"i confirm too.

Thank you."

AVOID!""

This here is CLASSIC example of a fuck-faced liar. Crying ZOMG VIRUZ LAWL to his momma without even downloading and trying."
,IndigoAK,2012-10-25T10:17Z,"This doesn't break anything, but I don't know if it's the real patch.  The patch notes state the game is supposed to use the operating system cursor instead of the software cursor, but for me the cursor is exactly the same as before.  And since my movies played in 1080p before, I have even less of a metric.  Finally, this patch isn't on the ORLY DB, though I'm not how terribly up-to-date or accurate that list it."
,theroboto,2012-10-25T16:49Z,Downloaded it and didnt get a RAR just a bunch of files i cant seem to open
,ben7530,2012-10-25T19:18Z,"@theroboto:

Rename the .001 file to .rar and you should be good to go."
,ben7530,2012-10-26T02:47Z,"Nope. I was wrong, ""theroboto"""
,IndigoAK,2012-10-26T03:16Z,"You don't need to rename.  Just rightclick on the file, click Open With... and then select your archive utility.  Use the Extract To or equivalent function and then pick a folder.  Your archive utility should automatically pick up on the files names and extract the remaining files as well."
,fiuse,2012-10-26T07:32Z,works great. ty
,jjshaw,2012-10-26T17:34Z,"@IndigoAK: it IS on ORLYDB, it just fail to find it with the keyword ""xcom"" for some reason. search for ""fltdox"", and you'll see."
,IndigoAK,2012-10-27T01:05Z,"it's not the real patch though.  Everything that this patch is supposed to fix doesn't actually happen if you install this torrent.  The mouse cursor stays the same (its supposed to look like your window cursor with the patch and not the huge blue one that originally came with the game) and hair still appears over fog, plus big maps with lots of fog of war still run horribly."
,Atonned,2012-10-28T08:46Z,"Guys nothing to freak about.
He just uploaded the file he downloaded from here:

,Axedal,2012-10-28T09:10Z,"@IndigoAK: way to go moron... maybe figure out what you are talking about before you post.  The patch is not supposed to make the cursor look like your desktop cursor.  It uses the desktop cursor with the XCOM graphics which removes lag and makes it much more responsive but looks identical.

CONFIRM: yes this patch fixes the cursor.  Also fixes the videos.  Implementation of other fixes are harder to confirm though.

Retards who do not know what they are talking about: please go home"
,Ga123qwe,2012-10-28T19:33Z,Anyone else having bluescreen probles after getting that?
,IndigoAK,2012-10-31T12:55Z,"@Axedal: Yes, I see that now.  I stand corrected.

There are still all kinds of performance issues even with the patch though, so hopefully Firaxis has more of them coming.

Also, the mouse cursor doesn't seem to disappear completely when using the 360 controller anymore.  I have to hide it in the corner."
,Serenifly,2012-11-21T23:45Z,What about patch 2?
,spystyle,2012-11-23T04:53Z,"This worked great with the BLACKBOX version I have :)

After I installed this, I installed this mod :

It's really good :)"
