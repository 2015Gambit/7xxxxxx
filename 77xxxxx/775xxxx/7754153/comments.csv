Worthless MP3 quality. Was a waste to even include it at such a low kbps.

The flacs are good though, thanks"

Apart from the menu, credits, and bosses.. 5 compositions for a 23-level game?

I would assume there was at least 3 boss tracks rather than 2 considering there's 3 bosses as well unless they just re-used something for the third boss?"

Will seed."
