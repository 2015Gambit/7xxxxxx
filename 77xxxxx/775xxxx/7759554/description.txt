The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a comic book limited series written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Kevin OΓÇÖNeill, published under the AmericaΓÇÖs Best Comics imprint of DC Comics. As of 2005 it comprises two six-issue limited series, each collected in graphic novel format. There is also a prequel short story, ΓÇ£Allan and the Sundered VeilΓÇ¥, included in the first series, and an extensive appendix detailing the alternate universe the League is set in, called ΓÇ£The New TravellerΓÇÖs AlmanacΓÇ¥, in Volume Two. The story takes place in 1898 in a fictional world where all of the characters and events from literature (and possibly the entirety of fiction) coexist. The world the characters inhabit is one more technologically advanced than our own was in the same era.
