"Professional Courtesy"

When the drunk driver who hits a car and 
paralyzes a 16-year-old boy turns out to be 
the son of a dirty cop, Lieutenant Casey 
must decide whether or not to turn him in. 
Facing pressure and subsequent threats from 
the powerful and well-connected Detective 
Voight, Casey decides to tell the truth, 
inviting a stand-off. Additionally, 
Severide, who's fighting off the advances of 
the Chief's new assistant, learns he has a 
fractured vertebra in his neck that may 
never heal if he doesn't get treated, but 
ignores the doctor's advice so he can 
continue working. Meanwhile, Mills is torn 
between helping his mother at her restaurant 
and devoting himself full-time to the fire 
department, like his father did.
