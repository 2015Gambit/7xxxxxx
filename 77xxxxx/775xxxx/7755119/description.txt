What a mess FOX and CTV have made of this thing, all due to some
baseball issue. CTV aired most of the original cut of E11 last week
but then at FOX's request withheld the ending, subbing in part of a rerun
FOX aired 47minutes before going to baseball

FOX's original plan was to air that same episode in it's entirety tonight
from 8-10 but then switched gears to air a CUT-DOWN 1hr version from 930-1030

This royally fucks up the scene numbering because this isn't E12, but we've pred
the CTV version which at pre we thought was complete. SO we're going with E11.REAL
since we don't follow this, we don't know how much of this is new content and how
much recaps the last week episode

We suggest you watch these in the following order

S02E10
S02E11.DIRFIX.Internal
S02E11.REAL
S02E12 (when it's released)

We shouldn't be blamed for trying to be helpful. We didn't know CTV screwed it up too
What a clusterfuck
