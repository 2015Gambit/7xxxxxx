"Lone Gunmen"

Oliver is surprised when someone 
shoots and kills one of his targets. 
As his plan is to bring people to 
justice vs. outright killing them, 
Oliver doesnt appreciate the help 
and searches for the gunman. He soon 
learns that the man, Deadshot, is 
taking out businessmen who are 
scheduled to bid at an auction on an 
energy company and Walter is one of 
the bidders. Realizing he cant 
protect his family and stop Deadshot 
at the same time, Oliver enlists 
Detective Lances help, but his plan 
has dire consequences. Meanwhile, 
Laurel and Tommy get caught in an 
awkward situation with Oliver.
