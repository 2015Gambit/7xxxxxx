Almost forgotten operetta from circa 1936 featuring a comic-opera dictator and the hapless peasant who gets drafted into his army. Supposedly set in the Caribbean (rather like Haiti/Dominicana, the subtext is obviously closer to home. The humour is remarkably bitter for a musical, devotees of Sweeney Todd would probably appreciate it.

I have lots more like this, let me know if you're interested.
