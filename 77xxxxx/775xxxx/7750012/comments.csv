,CentralColor,2012-10-22T20:09Z,What are the languages â&#x20AC;&#x2039;â&#x20AC;&#x2039;of this game?
,haseo0730,2012-10-22T22:32Z,"English language.
Additional notes: Game works if you patch it with topology 2.0 and burn with truncated method.
When you launch the game on your console it might ask for update, do it. If the game on launch stops and says something like wrong disc, non readable then clear your device cache, power off console with no disc inside then power on and insert disc. Play FH ^_~"
,haseo0730,2012-10-22T22:33Z,"P.S ""Update"" means doing an update in offline mode! I did mine in offline so idk what happens if you're on xbl.."
,Assassinprofessor,2012-10-22T23:27Z,"#haseo0730
what do you mean by saying ' clear your device cache' dont get this one!"
,haseo0730,2012-10-23T00:13Z,"Go to your hard drive or flash drive properties on dashboard, there should be an option to clear device cache"

,Saben82,2012-10-23T04:05Z,sorry about spammin net messing up
,mipcgamer,2012-10-23T04:51Z,"Can't make it work. I'm on 2.0 (patched the iso as many games before and burned on a Verbatim), but i'm getting ""Unrecognized Disc"" directly in the dashboard (can't even press ""Play Game"").
I already cleared the system cache many times and even took out the hard drive. I want to play this game so bad (I just tried other games and they work fine).
Is there any suggestion? Many thanks in advanced"
,Saben82,2012-10-23T05:24Z,@mipcgamer did u burn with truncated method
,neon2579,2012-10-23T06:00Z,"Seed twerps or I will stop seeding I dont need this game just want it u non seeding twits are the very type of twits that have destroyed this country with that selfish entitlement crap and you and the scum that raised u idiots deserve everthing you get from this f***** up economy.....

SO SEEEEEEEEEEED................"
,mipcgamer,2012-10-23T06:03Z,"@Saben82 Yes I did, as many games before. I usually run the isos through abgx360 and then patch them injecting the 2.0 topology.
The last game I burned succesfully was the recent Dishonored.
The error I got is the ""Status Code 03 80 00"", first time ever."
,Saben82,2012-10-23T06:16Z,pretty sure that error is to do with the cache. try removing ur hard drive and any other memory cards remove disc and then clear cache. then try playing it again.
,mipcgamer,2012-10-23T06:49Z,"It was actually the freaking disc (I think).
I burned it again on a non Verbatim disc and worked! Thanks for your help @Saben82"
,UnknownCPU,2012-10-23T09:08Z,Is it wise to exchange gamertags with people on this??
,TranceModig,2012-10-23T11:38Z,Works perfectly on my Xbox 360 with latest LT +3.0 .. Have played it for several hours now without any problems. Thanks so much for this ROM4N
,pete1599,2012-10-23T16:29Z,"awesome torrent! worked perfectly the first time used XBOX BACKUP CREATOR to inject ap25 and ran it on ABGX but the CRC could not be verifified still works perfectly. BUT when i save the game to my hard drive, i can only play for about 10 minutes before an xbox guide message comes up saying ""UNVERIFIABLE DISC"". works fine while reading off disc but its just faster when its on the HDD. any suggestions?"
,phoeniks314,2012-10-23T18:27Z,@pete1599 have you tried the mp3 trick
,pete1599,2012-10-23T19:31Z,@ phoeniks314 I'm not familiar with the mp3 trick please enlighten me 
,rfltp,2012-10-23T20:29Z,"which method to use , overburn or truncate ??"
,phoeniks314,2012-10-23T21:00Z,"copy a mp3 song to a usb stick, put that stick in your xbox and start the song, while the song plays start forza, the autohorization error will not appear but you have to do this every time you start a game"
,P_Greezy,2012-10-23T23:42Z,"OVERBURN or ihas is the best way to play this game without any errors, truncate will only work with the mp3 trick or problems will occur."
,pete1599,2012-10-24T01:59Z,everytime i play the game... id rather just keep playing it off the disc. but i never tried burning an abg3 games using OVERBURN i heard the game wont even work. can anyone confirm using the OVERBURN method over the TRUNCATE?
,P_Greezy,2012-10-25T19:51Z,"@pete1599  - I can confirm that OVERBURN works better than truncate, because i have never ONCE had to do a mp3 trick or got any error overburning my games at 2.4x, and i have been able to play every xgd3 game that way, so all im saying is if you don't have a ihas try it out for your self if you think im lying."

For the people that are getting 'unrecognized disk', try wiping your cd with a a q-tip soaked in rubbing alcohol and let it air dry. Or try cleaning your dvd drive lazer with the same method.
