,crypto007,2012-10-26T06:21Z,"Wrong not a scam as this new version does not require a root password, as the root password is set upon installing like any other ubuntu os."
,Utanium,2012-10-26T12:04Z,"I'm not installing it.
I'm running it live from USB drive."
,crypto007,2012-10-26T18:12Z,"Utanium, Please see ubuntu info on live cd's as there is no root logins allowed in live modes (guest accounts), after install and creating a real user account root access is simple by opening terminal command prompt and ""sudo su"" type the password of your real user account and bam you have a root prompt, there is nothing blocked or locking you out from complete access. Just learning how to is your issue. :))"
