Which file you asking about?"
,hell2pay,2012-10-26T23:54Z,"Nice Work, First Patch so far that has worked fully! Thanks"
,cwong668,2012-10-27T09:11Z,"darkman70,

i have downloaded and there is only one file without file extension ... and it is not a folder as well...

so i DO NOT know how to open it...

is it rar or zip file?...

please advise..."
,addyman,2012-10-27T14:14Z,"It comes in a .zip file. If you are running a newer version of Windows (Vista, Win7, Win8) zip compatibility should be integrated into the desktop so all you need is to double click to open it. 

If you are using an older version (WinXP and older) you may need to download a software, WinRAR, to open the zip file.

Once you open the Zip file, navigate to the Adobe folder and follow the instructions in the original details above."

[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-27T22:06Z,"When downloaded it comes with no file extension. Adding the file extension .rar creates a .rar file but upon extraction it's returning multiple errors.
Adding the file extension .exe and running the app. is returning the error that the app. is not compatible with a Win7 64bit O/S"
,cwong668,2012-10-27T22:38Z,"it is a zip file ... unzip it...

cheers,"
,DarkMan70,2012-10-28T15:42Z,"All those who claim that there is no file extension, does not having a basic Windows knowledge. They have checked ""Hide extensions for known file types"" option under 'Folder options->View' tab. File is a ZIP archive."
,cwong668,2012-10-28T20:52Z,"darkman70,

This option is checked by default. You can see extension in uTorrent, but never mind.

I just share someone else patch here because it was so hard to find. I' ve tried this patch only with After Effects so I can't help You. Sorry"
,wesam2015,2012-10-29T15:24Z,"Can I update after using this method?
Thank you."
,LeFunk007,2012-10-30T22:16Z,The patch didn't work. All the apps still try to validate the serials and find out that the serial is false.
,wesam2015,2012-10-31T23:04Z,We can get Photoshop extended with that?
,DarkMan70,2012-11-06T08:47Z,This works for me just right
,haywardb,2012-11-08T02:47Z,Just tried it out and it works exactly as described.  Cheers for this.
,ahlehleh,2012-11-11T02:04Z,Does this work even when CS6 is updated with latest Adobe patches or will it result to deactivation? Thanks.
,PugBrew,2012-11-12T04:23Z,You're a life saver. Mint Flavored.
,xgnarrx,2012-11-13T13:37Z,"Finally a patch that works! I have tried everything and this is the only thing that did it for me :) I canned the file with Avast before using and it didn't give any warning, so I ran it as Administrator and now I can start Encore and Premiere with all sequence presets! :D Thanks alot!"
