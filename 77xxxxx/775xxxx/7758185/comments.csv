M: I didn't watch it, so I don't know.

Ok, for a cam, but I've seen much better. Thanks to scene4all for all his great work. "

Problem is it goes out of sync part way through. I'm not complaining, just telling you what I got."

,dixienormous123,2012-10-27T21:15Z,"Good quality cam until about 30 minutes in then goes out of sync by several seconds....movie looked decent until went OOS but unable to finish.

Vid - 7 solid, little washed but watchable!
Aud - 8 very solid, but goes OOS after 30 min so crystal clear, but totally out of sync!
Mov - ?8? only able to watch first half, couldn't take the OOS after that and shut it off.  But does look like very good action flick."
