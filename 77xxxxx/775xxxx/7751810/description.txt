The Da Vinci Detective
Art meets science and detective story lifting the lid on some of the most controversial stories in the art world. Pioneering forensic scientist Dr Maurizio Seracini has made his name by ingeniously adapting the latest medical and military technology to reveal the secrets of great artistic masterpieces. In this film he sets out to investigate the unsolved mysteries surrounding some of the works of genius produced by world famous Renaissance artist Leonardo Da Vinci.


1)  Part 1 
Because it's a mural, Dr. Seracini believes it could still be within the Hall of Five Hundred. Since the 1970s, Maurizio has worked both on and off commission from the city of Florence to use his engineering and scientific skills to find the mural. Along the way, during periods when he is not allowed to investigate inside the Hall, he does other investigatory work on other art. One such charge was to see if another Leonardo work, the Adoration of the Magi, would survive a restoration effort. In researching the Adoration, he uncovers a surprising revelation about the art, shattering what people know about it. And in doing so, it brings him full circle back to his quest to find the Battle of Anghiari.

2)  Part 2 
This show is quite enjoyable, from a historical quest/educational point-of-view. The idea that a lost work by Leonardo is hidden inside a wall is a tantalizing mystery. Compounded with what he discovers on the other Da Vinci art only heightens the magnificent possibilities of what historians truly know about art. The Da Vinci Detective is a fascinating slice of real history, without any embellishment.
