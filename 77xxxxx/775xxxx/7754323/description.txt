with another woman. Zoe decides to two can 
play at that game, and sets up a date with 
Ruby's (guest star Golden Brooks) cousin. 
Reluctantly, Lavon agrees to let Lemon be his 
campaign manager, but he unexpectedly becomes 
part of a town scandal when he takes the fall 
for her, a move which could end up costing 
him the Mayoral race. Meanwhile, with Lemon 
out of the house, Brick and Magnolia (guest 
star Claudia Lee) struggle with the household 
chores and devise a plan to get Lemon to come 
back.
