[T],mf-den,2012-10-22T22:03Z,"@NoyBoning: There are a lot of episodes to upload for me today, but dont know why piratebay is not allowing me to upload anything after this, it has blocked the bayimg tag and keeps giving me an error cos of it. So probably this should be resolved by tmrw and u can look up for it that time."
,lukescoot,2012-10-22T22:40Z,"Im having the same issue on my uploads. Im waiting for it to be fixed. I pretty much am only uploading Ipad/Ipod Touch/Iphone rips right now. They're in high demand and theres not many of them. I just wish i had a higher upload speed, its 250k, pew pew. Thanks for uploading a low size file for this show, wtg!"
