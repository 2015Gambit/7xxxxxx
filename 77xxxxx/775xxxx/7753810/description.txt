User Review

This film deals lightly with quite an interesting subject: How much of a choice do you have in your life? McCrea wants the freedom of a life with no chains to anything, when suddenly he is in charge of taking care of four boys. This is not what he wants at all, but being a good man he just cannot abandon them. Wanda Hendrix is charming, at the beginning she looks like a young girl about the age of the boys, but then she becomes a beautiful woman. This excellent western, even though is quite predictable, makes you enjoy every minute of it.
