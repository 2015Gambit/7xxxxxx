 Abbas Ali lives in Karol Bagh, New Delhi with   
 his sister Sania. They are legally fighting for 
 an ancestral property - land case. But the odds 
 turn against them and they lose. Their well     
 wisher, Shastri Chacha, advises and convinces   
 them to migrate to his village Ranakpur where   
 he assures Abbas that he will get him a job at  
 his owner's place. The owner being none other   
 than the powerful Prithviraj Raghuvanshi.       
 Abbas enters Ranakpur village and while saving  
 a child trapped inside a temple, he breaks open 
 the lock of an ancestral temple but fate plays  
 an important twist in Abbas' life as the whole  
 village including Prithviraj's step-brother     
 Vikrant opposes Abbas' actions but Prithviraj   
 arrives and handles the situation. On being     
 asked his name, Abbas's friend comes out with   
 a fake name, as it would create a rage if       
 villagers came to know that the lock of a temple
 had been broken by a Muslim
