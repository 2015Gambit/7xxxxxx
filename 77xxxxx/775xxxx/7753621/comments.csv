Professional
MMRNH-BMB4F-87JR9-D72RY-MY2KV

I'm just confirming that this is the real deal, and it works perfectly. I'm on it now.  This is Windows 8 PRO build 9200 x64 and x86.  Ok here's a few tips cause I struggled with it too.  If you use the activator in this release it activates windows but it doesn't allow you to personalize (change lock screen etc) they're greyed out but if you use a different method to activate windows credit from another post from ""murphy78""

Mouse down to bottom left corner. Right click on the Start/desktop button.
Click ""Command Prompt (Admin)"" and type in these 3 commands at the command prompt:

slmgr /ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr -skms kms.creighton.edu
slmgr -ato

If you do this it activates windows, and you can personalize it as well. WORKS PERFECT, nice release!!!!              Thanks again JBiz1"
,razorblade2987,2012-10-25T22:42Z,does anyone know if this has the keys for activation? Don't want to start then can't activate. And also if there isn't can you guide to one that is bootable through the iso and has the activation keys?

,JBiz1,2012-10-27T00:50Z,"6y1q5t - ok so do you have a fastboot option like hitting ESC when you turn on the PC? Does the ISO say bootable image when you load it in what ever your using (winiso, poweriso)? You should be able to hit enter to boot from CD and should have a msg that tells you so when you first boot up the pc. What else do you see on the screen? Mabye you didnt burn it correctly....im trying to help you here but can you give me more detail. Thanks"
,JBiz1,2012-10-27T00:55Z,"6y1q5t - Do not recreate the iso, just remove the activator and keys directory then burn! You might have made it not bootable by recreating the iso leave everything else in tact. Other than that burn it on another PC running windows and use poweriso. when you open it in poweriso just del that directory and then burn it! Good Luck!"

Close CMD and go to next step.

2.Press windows button + R and type slui 4. Press enter. Select United Kingdom as your country.

3.Call the toll free number. Follow their instructions. Works best with a real phone, but if you can't call internationally, use Skype or iCall.
+4408000188354

4. If they ask about number of computer, where you will use this key, say 1. Follow their instructions.

5.After that it's activated...permanently"

,baloo2.1,2012-10-27T19:59Z,"OK. So here's the deal -- in case you noobs haven't understood it.

You can either install Win8 on a virgin computer (usually a virtual one) or you can ""upgrade"" your present Windows install -- using SETUP in the Win8 distribution -- but not this one!.

If you want to ""upgrade"", this is not what you want! At least not if you are running a 64 system. I haven't tested yet if it works on a 32 system, but I doubt that it will...

NOTE: click only the ""install/uninstall"" button when running the activator. Clicking anything else will only result in a skeleton pirate dancing. This is Build 9200. Not sure if it's the current version but it does activate and indicates so in the ""System"" page of ""Device Manager"". Also, do not try to install through XP or Win 7: you run the risk of losing your stuff. Boot using the burned DVD and avoid problems.
