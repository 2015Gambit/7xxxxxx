Dawkins Sex, Death and the Meaning of Life
More4

SERIES SYNOPSIS

Ideas about the soul and the afterlife, of sin and God's purpose
have shaped human thinking for thousands of years. Religious
rituals remain embedded in the major events of our lives.

In this thought-provoking series, evolutionary biologist Richard
Dawkins asks what happens if we leave religion behind.

He explores what reason and science might offer to inspire and
guide our lives in religion's place. Can science bring understanding
in the face of death, help us tell right from wrong, or reveal
the meaning of life?

Richard Dawkins explores what science can tell us about death.

Dawkins brings together the latest neuroscience, evolutionary and
genetic theory to examine why we crave life after death, why we
evolved to age and how the human genome is something like real
immortality - traits inherited from our distant ancestors that we
pass on to future generations.
