Determined gold miners from around the world seek their fortunes in the dangerous and gold-rich jungles of Ghana, Africa's second largest gold producing country. With little money and everything on the line, rookie American gold miners George Wright and Scott Lomu beg and borrow anything they can to succeed after losing it all in the 2008 U.S. real estate crash. After securing a $150,000 from an investor, the pressure is on from the very start to find gold to pay back this loan, as well as their other debts. Against stacked odds, their stakes have never been higher.
