,Anroid869,2012-10-26T12:39Z,"Thanks alot!

Will KaOs release a ripped version of the huge ""Medal of Honor Warfighter"" any time soon?"
,guri1993,2012-10-26T15:37Z,when will u upload  Medal of Honor Warfighter ?

[T],PirateBoy,2012-10-26T18:11Z,"No MoH: Warfighter from KaOs.

@ DMNothing

Read the description. Nothing's ripped or removed. This is a rip.

@ soyuz16

Come over to our site where you will find all the games with torrents and direct download links. And, there's no Mass Effect 1 and 2 from KaOs as of now."

,digli,2012-10-28T19:33Z,"hey, thanks for the great torrent ;)
one question, will you upload ""Destiny Ember's"" ?

I really want to conitnue the game ^^"
,ASD2010ASD,2012-10-29T13:19Z,"the game gives me error """"the application has failed 
to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect"""" 
need help "
,VegitoDBZ,2012-11-01T02:20Z,Kaos is the best. Thank you for all your work you guys.
,RAMENN00DLE5,2012-11-04T05:58Z,Props on your idiot proof and very cool looking software my friend! Even the noobiest of noobs should be able to handle your build
,RAMENN00DLE5,2012-11-04T06:01Z,BTW..@ newer guys This is indeed the real McCoy. Our great benefactor just compressed files in order to make the package smaller thus making it easier than it would be otherwise to DL his torrent. Trolls will never realize that whatever errors they come across could ever be THIER fault! It usually is the case however. This is a great torrent and I hear a great game as well. I will soon find out! Thanks KaOs and gansuk!
,Arkane7,2012-11-12T16:09Z,"KaOs releases are the best, the compression is amazing. Thanks gansuk!"
,theembergrows,2012-11-15T21:01Z,I'm getting lots of crashes and hangs while playing the tutorial. Anyone else having problems with the game?
,blbrotto,2012-11-17T02:51Z,"Great torrent! 

Thanks for the uploader and please, up the last update cracked (1.02) as soon as possible, since the unpatched version of this game has several gamebreaking bugs :("
,FriedCoD,2012-11-25T00:50Z,"can someone upload patch 1.01 , 1.02 ??
its lame, you have to sign in to their system with a registered account to get the patch... which obviously is incompatible with this...
1.02 fixes some BADLY needed things...
please!!! ... thanks.. "
