,moviekil,2012-10-25T12:02Z,"awesome ,,very light software .. thanks.."
,hydromat,2012-10-26T20:38Z,"Sorry to say this:

this software is difficult to crack as the program itself has a strong mechanism that prevents you from using it more than a few times. It's sad as i tried multiple versions, with multiple cracks and serials and nothing works, not even extensions, even in Admin mode. This is good software, cheap, and beautiful, but people dont have money to buy it, that's the truth.

thanks"

,taz420nj,2012-11-21T14:22Z,"@BySenzati:  How about you come up with a crack that works instead of telling people to just keep using the (worthless for life) keygen every 20 minutes?  

This program gets real bitchy once the invalid key is detected, and it does random spiteful things to whatever you're working on..  Sometimes it closes the project suddenly without saving - causing you to lose your work, sometimes it changes the HTML to a red background and the title to ""Created with a STOLEN copy of WYSIWYG Web Builder *"", sometimes it scrambles the layout.  

So simply applying the keygen over and over is a stupid suggestion.  Stop releasing this CRAP."
