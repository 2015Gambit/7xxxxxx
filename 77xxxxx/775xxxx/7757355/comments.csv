,Goldfire1986,2012-11-06T06:22Z,"Yea, we can do without you posting on the majority of MP4 based encodes. Looks like you'll need to have a read of the differences between MP4 and AVI - because it seems that an extension makes a world of difference to you.

It wouldn't matter if it's MP4 or AVI, you can still have poor encodes."
