There are no well established activation bypass as of yet, so I have not 
included them.

I have made it a point not to modify or customize any windows programs or 
settings in any way.
Either burn the included .iso file to a dvdr or use a usb flash drive.
I have included diskpart instructions and the win7usb tool.
I personally use diskpart and winrar, but the tool may be easier.
