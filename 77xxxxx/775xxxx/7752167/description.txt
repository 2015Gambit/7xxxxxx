Storyline:
Mary Shelley, author of "Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus," reveals to Percy Shelley and Lord Byron that Henry Frankenstein and his Monster did not die.
Both lived, and went on to even stranger misadventures than before. As the new story begins, Henry wants nothing more than to settle into a peaceful life with his new bride.
But his old professor, the sinister Dr. Pretorius, now disgraced, appears unexpectedly. Eventually, he and the Monster blackmail him into continuing his work.
The Monster wants his creator to build him a friend; and Pretorius wants to see dead tissue become a living woman.
Henry is forced to give his creature a bride.
