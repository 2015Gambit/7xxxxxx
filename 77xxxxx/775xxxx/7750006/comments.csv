,carrollm5,2012-10-27T16:32Z,"I lost my home in 2009 and had to leave my large library of 2,000 books (mostly award winning fiction) behind. Because of you I'm now able to rebuild my library digitally. There are no words to thank you enough for the service you're providing. Receiving this collection was such a gift!
3 books I'd love to read again:
Moo by Jane Smiley
The Restraint of Beasts by Magnus Mills
The Winter of our Discontent by John Stenibeck
Thanks again."
