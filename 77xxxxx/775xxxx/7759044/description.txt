
Two versions of ΓÇ£Enoch ArdenΓÇ¥ by Tennyson. The first, with Andrew Sachs as narrator, was broadcast on ABC FM some ten years ago. The second, with Erik Rhodes, is of a vinyl recording made in 1950.  Both versions use the piano accompaniment written by the young Richard Strauss.

The poem tells the story of a castaway who returns home to very changed circumstances. Set in the eighteenth century it reflects a nineteenth century ascetic ethos and the popular melodrama of the time.

Static on a previous upload of the Sachs recording has been cleaned up and the sound significantly improved.
