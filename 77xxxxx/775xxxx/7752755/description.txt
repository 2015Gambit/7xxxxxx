The Door Was Shut For Every Truth - Philip Sizemore:
The parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25 gives us a picture of what will happen just prior to Christ's Second Coming -- some people will try to get into heaven, but the door of probation will shut because they did not obey the truth they professed to believe. Join Pastor Philip Sizemore as he analyzes the symbolism of this parable and its urgent message to all people today.

The Testimony of Tom Cantor, Completed Jew:
Israel Restoration Mimistries
Tom Cantor
Hi, my name is Tom Cantor, and I'd like to tell you about the greatest thing that happened in my life. You know, I'm a scientist. I graduated from the University of California at San Diego in biochemistry. And I started a business in my garage with just $130. And today, it's grown to be a debt-free, mortgage-free, investor-free biotech company, with nearly 700 employees.

Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
