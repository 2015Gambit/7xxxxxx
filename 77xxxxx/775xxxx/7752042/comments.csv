This is an .m4a which was converted to FLAC.
There reason being it'll reach a larger audience and it's easier for me to upload.

Hope this clarifies any questions regarding ANY of my FLAC uploads.

If i rip an original CD in future it'll be clearly marked as a FLAC RIP.

If it's a conversion it'll be clearly marked as a CONVERSION TO FLAC."
