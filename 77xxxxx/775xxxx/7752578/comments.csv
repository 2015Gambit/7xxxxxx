,doritoman,2012-10-25T11:58Z,"Request TROY (2004)

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332452/

please! love your work and since the movie is 3 hours long it should be atleast 900mb - 1gb for a 720p version. but the only ones i can find are either too small or too big :( "
[V],twentyforty,2012-10-26T09:27Z,"@kanha:
1. I have Reign.Over.Me.2007.BluRay.576p.H264 - I have no Blu-ray disk anymore, meaning, no new encode could be made.
2. ""Tsotsi"" - as many movies from small cinematographies I must watch it first and see is it good. If it's good, I will encode it, so, when you see torrent (or not) you will know..
3. ""Barbarian Invasions"" - no. Sorry.

@doritoman: I made Troy DC encode this night. It was 1800 MB and shitty in action-with-high-contrast-scenes at the end (plundering the city). It means 1) how decent 720p must be over 2.1 GB and 2) frame-format must be smaller.
It is too big for me (single encode over 1.4 GB). It could be 480p if 1 GB max. is needed."
,doritoman,2012-10-26T11:24Z,hmmm.. well go as small as you can without sacrificing too much quality please :) if its currently like 1.8gb thats fine
,atdrake,2012-10-26T13:38Z,"Sir, can you do ""A hard day's night"" in 720p
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058182/"
[V],twentyforty,2012-10-26T14:10Z,"@doritoman: Maximum I can upload (as single file) is 1.4 GB. It could be one fine 480p, rather than shitty 720p (which looks great on static scenes, but looked endlessly ugly near the end of ""Troy"" movie (night, battle,  lot of fires) and it always look as shit if bit-rate is too low. Well, on big-screens 480p cannot compete with nice 720p. But (and I repeat that as a parrot) - everything is in proper watching distance.
From 6-7 feet differences are hardly visible.

You have mentioned duration, but it is only a part of determining final size of the encode. It's more about content.
480p can stay below 1.4 GB, but I need one more night to encode.

If you are concerned about video quality so much and have no needs to compromise - I honestly think how getting one big-ass rip or even original disk is better solution."

,kanha,2012-10-26T18:55Z,"@2040
thx for replying."
,doritoman,2012-10-26T19:08Z,"@thechilling, yify's 800mb version is horrid quality. completely pixelated even in still scenes. thats why i requested one from twentyforty. even an extra 400mb would make it much better."
,funpigj2k,2012-10-27T05:07Z,"Hey 2040, just saw your request for The Killing.  I'm seeding now if you didn't already get it.

Sorry that took so long."
[V],twentyforty,2012-10-27T22:02Z,"@jawick: Thank you my friend.

@kanha; Tsosie is done as 720p and I hardcoded English subtitles in (many people cannot use external subs on mp4). I currently work at my own site and if you don't want to wait here - email me at gmail. My address on gmail is twentyfort1 and rest is always the same... It's up to you.

@doritoman: I encoded Troy DC three frikkin times. Only 480p and 1.26 GB turned to be decent one. If you want that, please read what I have said above and email me."
,funpigj2k,2012-10-28T00:07Z,"Hey 2040, I tried to contact you at the address above and it bounced back as an address unknown."
,doritoman,2012-10-28T00:12Z,thanks for trying :) but i think i'll take the time to encode it myself to about 1gb in good quality :)
,stevesquirtle,2012-10-28T03:06Z,can u upload teen wolf season 2? in 480p thanks :))

please complete them..havent watched yet
please do them in 480p or if web-dl if possible..thank u sir in advance"
,supcena,2012-10-29T15:18Z,Dude ...i changed the location of a movie on my PC that i downloaded and now i am unable to seed it ..so i removed it from my torrent client..how can i seed it back ? Plz help :)
[V],twentyforty,2012-10-29T16:09Z,"@supcena: Best way is to find specific torrent (maybe your torrent program make copies of downloaded torrents), open it and point to location (folder) is right now. I successfully seeded many old encodes from DVDR, USB stick or USB disk.

@acdc.rockz: I uploaded all episodes, but as you can see from my uploads (no TV show episodes last 45 days), not on TPB. Later I would make season pack for Hell on wheels on my site and maybe much later, on TPB. If you want, contact me on gmail mentioned above."
,jawick9,2012-10-29T18:13Z,"twentyforty, I don't know if you have access to Chiller TV from the U.S., but ""The American Scream"" looks pretty interesting:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2075373/  It is airing again on Oct. 31st.  You can see the trailer for it on youtube."
,supcena,2012-10-30T14:17Z,Thank you so much 20-40 ...it worked :)

,thechilling,2012-11-02T12:23Z,have u started a website? give the link dude!
,doritoman,2012-11-08T09:13Z,will you ever do supernatural seasons 1-5? you did 6 and 7 and they look awesome.. but not the first 5.. i found them elsewhere but they look like crap. ur tv shows are top notch!
,thechilling,2012-11-09T06:47Z,when can we expect you to upload something dude?
[V],twentyforty,2012-11-09T09:53Z,"@x5x5x71: You get that message when you use Proxy or access site ""sideways""... Everything works as it should.

@doritoman: It was my regular show from day one. But - few years back ever my encode was 272p, 320p later - and that is unwatchable on newer LCD displays. However, all older seasons were lost due to few died HDD and final blow happened early this year when two seedboxes with over 3200 movie and TV encodes have been erased from existence. Because it is long show, with gazillion episodes - I simply cannot redo it all again. Sorry.

@thechilling: I give link to regular, known downloaders of my choosin and only through gmail. I made that pretty obvious."
,thechilling,2012-11-10T07:44Z,"what is this link/email business? just upload ur stuff here so we can download dude. ur acting like u have some hidden treasure which ul only share with ppl who lick ur feet. c'mon man, loosen up. i miss ur uploads."
