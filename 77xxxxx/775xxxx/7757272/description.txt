"Halloween-ween"

Since arriving on Earth, the aliens - led by the 
Bird-Kersees - have viewed Halloween as a threat 
and have set up a barrier at the gates of Hidden 
Hills to prevent children dressed in costumes from 
entering the community. The Weavers, on the other 
hand, are excited about their first Halloween in 
the suburbs and want to open the gates of the 
community to celebrate. They do their best to 
explain the ritual of trick-or-treating to the 
aliens. Meanwhile, Marty and Debbie's fears are 
realized when Amber, Max and Abby reject their 
family costume plans.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
