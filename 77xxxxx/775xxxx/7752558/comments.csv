,MrIks,2012-10-23T17:33Z,"@Homeoplasmine

Yes, 3 comments."
,BackDaFuckup,2012-10-23T17:38Z,no.
,fightknightHERO,2012-10-23T22:26Z,"""5. Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy!""

so you really want people to support the developers? no shit? then why upload this and hurt their Profits? 

really quit uploading stuff like this 
those companies don't deserve this for their hardwork "
,lo0per,2012-10-23T22:37Z,"@fightknightHERO
GTFO if you do not understand the concept of file sharing, test drive and digital assets."
,randir12,2012-10-24T00:40Z,"fightknightHERO, why the fuck are you on this site and searching for games? Hypocritical dipshit."
,PirateEm,2012-10-24T01:37Z,"Any kickstarter backers want to upload the extra costumes?

You use a key to get them so I'm not sure how it'd work. Maybe a patch that makes it think you entered the key or something. as there probably isn't any files to paste, just something unlocked."
,synesthesik,2012-10-24T14:47Z,"Thanks Hero!  You never cease to amaze!  

BTW guys, this is a really great Kickstarter game from a small dev team so if you like it, please at least consider spending some of your hard-earned dollars buying it.  :)"
,darkony1992,2012-10-26T16:54Z,"I need some help with this one. It doesn't work . When i click the GSGameExe.exe i get this error ""The application was unable to star correctly (0xc0150002). Click OK to close the application"". And when i click the GSGameExe_DX9.exe i get this ""The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail"". What can i do ? Is this framework or visual c++ problem?"
,darkony1992,2012-10-28T16:21Z,"ok, finally i got it work. for those who still have launch error problems install this:

,PirateEm,2012-10-28T23:51Z,"ignore my last comment. I found them elsewhere :D

good torrent btw. thanks. 
I purchased the Steam version after playing this for like 2 minutes. great game :D"
,Nuraihyon,2012-10-30T07:14Z,What I find funny is that fightknightHERO specifically searched out this game just to get mad at the community for having it.
,LavaWave,2012-11-02T07:46Z,"The classic series, I liked the series, I just heard about the new Giana game yesterday, this remake/sequel or whatever is very fun as well."
,Yorkfield,2012-11-17T16:46Z,"Hi, does anyone know this version?

""Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams v1 01 Update-SKIDROW"" ... can be found via google

I've started the v1.01 download but it has ended at 98.5% because it has no Seeders, just currently 5 (16) Peers.

Does anyone know how to update 1.0.0.3 version to 1.01 ?"
