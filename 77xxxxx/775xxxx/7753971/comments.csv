,DemiAngelX,2012-10-24T09:50Z,"Oh yeah, a couple more things.
1.) A small trick to get the game to stretch across widescreen displays with decent framerate, would be to first set the resolution(with the setup Bat file) to either 800x600 or 1024x768. Then open the game's config file(Ex: ""dosbox.redneck.cfg""), and find where it says ""fullresolution=0x0"". Change the 0x0 to simply 1280x960 or 1280x1024, then start the game.

2.)To play online with netplay clients like Meltdown, you need to convert the game BAT files to EXE. As you can see by default, there's only BAT's. One converter I found, but have not tested, would be here: http://www.f2ko.de/programs.php?lang=en&pid=b2e

So ya, enjoy."
