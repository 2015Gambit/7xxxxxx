))))Redneck Rampage Family Reunion w/ Cusspack, DosBox Edition((((

Re-uploaded, original upload & creation by MasterFaster.


So yeah as the title says, this DosBox version was originally created by MasterFaster. I decided to reupload it since his own torrent went down awhile ago and I was one of the last able people to grab it, so I'm hoping he won't kill me if he minds :P  But if so, by all means I'll take it off here ASAP.

This upload includes all 3 expansions, plus the highly unnecessary (but funny as hell) Cuss Pack, and it should run on most PC's with minimum or no lag. It was released by Xatrix Entertainment about a year after Duke Nukem 3D and designed on the same Build engine, receiving mostly fair to moderate critic reviews.


How to Install:

1.) Open with WinRar or 7zip and extract wherever.
2.) In the extracted folder, configure sound & video with the "Setup Redneck Rampage" BAT files.
3.) Click on any of the "Play Redneck Rampage" BAT files to launch the game, and enjoy :)

And I personally haven't noticed much significance between the regular BAT's, or the "bMouse" BAT's, but maybe they'll make a difference for you guys, IDK :/

Enjoy and seed :)
