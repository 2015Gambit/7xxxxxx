Two CD set. New production of the Gershwins' Porgy And Bess starring four-time Tony Award-winner Audra McDonald, Drama Desk-nominee Norm Lewis, and two-time Tony Award-nominee David Alan Grier. The Associated Press hailed it as "a gorgeous version of the Gershwin masterpiece," while Newsday proclaimed it "a luscious piece of musical theatre: a gripping, in-your-face, vibrant revival that bursts with fierce immediacy''. Revered for its legendary score by George Gershwin, Dubose & Dorothy Heyward and Ira Gershwin -- featuring such classics as "Summertime," "Bess, You Is My Woman Now" and "I Got Plenty of Nothing" -- The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess has been reimagined and reinvigorated for the modern stage by a team that includes Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks, musical adapter Diedre L. Murray and director Diane Paulus.
