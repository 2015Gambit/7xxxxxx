A rather unusual recording of a rather unusual concert.
The gig, because it contains some grey cats you probably
never heard before, and 17 absolutely beautiful seconds,
and a never ending journey by train. And the recording,
because it sometimes sounds like cats. However, as always
you get what I ripped from my (worn-out) tape, as-is and
with no noise reduction or any other post processing applied.
