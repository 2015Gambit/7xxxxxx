,wkt37211,2012-11-14T20:39Z,"Will this is a good file, several of the episodes, 5,6, and 8 may be difficult to get. The only downloads I have found for the 3 mentioned episodes and zipped, password protected and require you to sign up for services and release your cellular phone number. Just FYI!

Makes it difficult to follow a series with all the gaps. If someone has found the episodes please upload!"
