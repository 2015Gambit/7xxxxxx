[T],rjordan21,2012-10-25T02:42Z,"Congrats on your first torrent here at TPB.  You asked for feedback so here's mine. Redundancy isn't really needed here.  There are other seeded FLAC uploads of this album here and all you're doing is splitting the seed pool.  Also, uploading a file that has skips in it? It seems some people either haven't read your description or don't care but try not to do that...

Keep uploading and, more importantly, keep seeding anything you download here.

Enjoy the music! "
