,markob50,2012-10-28T07:19Z,Didn't work for me
[T],dynstab2,2012-11-09T14:49Z,All 3 registration keys provided seem blacklisted (pasted in or typed in). Since markob50's post?
[T],dynstab2,2012-11-09T15:34Z,"Well, it may be that it won't register to any name but to your username (the name of your PC) depending on an option you choose at install. Just installed Xilisoft Converter Ultimate 7 and the install went OK using my username (PC name) this time. So ignore my previous comment."
,7mmSniper,2012-11-15T22:11Z,Worked for me using a random name and one of the serials from the list!  Thanx for the U/L!
,calvinalx,2012-11-17T17:24Z,It worked perfectly for me. Thanks for the upload!
,Sarom,2012-11-25T22:38Z,Doesn't work... I added a block rule in the firewall to the exes in the dvd converter folder and can't continue because it needs internet access to do the validation process. And once with internet access the registration always fails.
