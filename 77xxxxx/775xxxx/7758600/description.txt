Silver Star is a comic book created, written, and drawn by Jack Kirby, originally published by Pacific Comics from February 1983 to January 1984, lasting six issues.

The concept for Silver Star began in the mid-1970s as a movie screenplay by Jack Kirby and Steve Sherman.  The final comic series was based on the initial screenplay, with some revision made by Kirby.

The series was launched following the success of Kirby's previous creator-owned book for Pacific, Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers.  Silver Star follows the exploits of government agent Morgan Miller, who, after being transformed into a genetic mutant (Homo Geneticus) by his father Dr. Bradford Miller, was appointed the task of fighting other super powered beings.  Silver Star teams with fellow Homo Geneticus, Norma Richmond (gifted with the ability to resist enormous stress,) and Big Masai (a size changing mutant,) and battles with the villainous Darius Drumm (an early subject of Dr. Bradford Miller's genetic structuring with the ability to warp reality.)

The books also included additional back-up stories not featuring the Silver Star.  For example, issue two included a short story by Steve Ditko, The Mocker.

In 1993 Topps Comics launched a new Silver Star as a part of the failed "Kirbyverse" books.  The series, written by Kurt Busiek with art by James W. Fry III and Terry Austin, only lasted one issue.

In November, 2011 Dynamite Entertainment released the single-issue series (initially slated to be four) Kirby Genesis:  Silver Star, written by Jai Nitz and drawn by Johnny D, featuring covers by Alex Ross, Jae Lee, and Mark Buckingham.
