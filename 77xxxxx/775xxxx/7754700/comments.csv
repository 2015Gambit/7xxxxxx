Not what you'd expect from Bird - much more simple (the musicians performed in a circle around a single mike in a barn; all acoustic instruments) and no fancy (well, purposely pretentious) lyric play.  Just great, great songs and far more country oriented than anything else he's done. Highlights: ""Three White Horses"" and ""Spirograph.""  I just listened to the album three times in a row."
