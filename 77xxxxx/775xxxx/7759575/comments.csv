[T],blackcanary,2012-10-29T07:59Z,"The initial 6 issue mini series just finished in August.  Tom Hutchison (writer), Alisson Borges (artist), and Kate Finnegan (colorist) are working on the first 5 issue story arc of the new series which should debuted at the New York Comic Con just over a week ago.  Three issue #1 variant covers are available for sale in Big Dog Ink's store, but not the normal issue #1 yet."
