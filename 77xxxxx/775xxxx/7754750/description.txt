Redsn0w is a free iOS jailbreaking tool developed by the iPhone Dev Team, capable of 
executing jailbreaks on many iOS devices by using low-level boot ROM exploits and additional exploits. It is a desktop application that enables users to jailbreak an iOS device (connected to the desktop computer with a standard USB charging cable) by clicking a series of buttons.
Like other jailbreaking tools, using redsn0w to jailbreak a device enables the user to have root access on their device and removes Apple's restrictions on installing software outside the App Store. Jailbreaking with redsn0w includes an option (enabled by default) to install Cydia, the popular third-party software installer.
