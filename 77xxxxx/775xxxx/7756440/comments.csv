,xidio,2012-10-24T21:36Z,"Why do we need posters? Give us images from the movie, from this clip. "
,anoXmous,2012-10-24T21:52Z,"I don't know what the source is so I call it 1920x800 :)
and it is ok but not like proper BluRay :(

So no need for screaming about it."
,baba.mulon,2012-10-24T22:15Z,"WOW thanks 4 the poster!!! I think its the only copy on the internetS! I also don't know what the source is so i call it ""i'll skip this crap""."

,QborT,2012-10-24T22:43Z,"The source is the same as all the others floating around, it is an upscaled DVDRip.  

I really don't understand why P2P groups insist on re-encoding shit rips."
,markob50,2012-10-25T04:43Z,"I just watched a little of the movie. I feel the video and audio are good. Should encode the text in a srt file so it can be turned off. It makes it more difficult to watch if you don't read Dutch
Thanks"
,JeffCC,2012-10-25T12:21Z,"Real 1080p Rip, fuck those people who trying to spoiler anoXmous, test before say something you fking idiots"
,blandrys,2012-10-26T15:18Z,I downloaded and checked this out too and would have to lean with QborT - this is an upscaled DVDrip and certainly not a downscaled 1080p
,villegasep8025,2012-10-27T04:12Z,"Thanks Bro, Can you do Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter?  Thanks.  A lot of trolling going on, anoXmous has the best BLU RAY torrents here for small file size, keeping them under a gig."
