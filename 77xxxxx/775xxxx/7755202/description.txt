   The sequel to 2007's Game of the Year, Portal 2 is a hilariously 
   mind-bending adventure that challenges you to use wits over weaponry in 
   a funhouse of diabolical science.

   Using a highly experimental portal device, youΓÇÖll once again face off 
   against a lethally inventive, power-mad A.I. named GLaDOS. And this time 
   you wonΓÇÖt be alone. Meet an expanded cast of characters as you think your 
   way through dangerous, never-before-seen areas of Aperture Laboratories.

   Break the laws of spatial physics in ways you never thought possible, 
   with a wider variety of portal puzzles and an expansive story that spans 
   a single player and co-operative game mode.
