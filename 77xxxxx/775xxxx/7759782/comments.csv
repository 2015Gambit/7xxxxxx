,dethstyl,2012-10-29T05:21Z,Hey man I REALLY appreciate this - I need these to prepare for part two to prepare for an Algos grad class I have in the Spring. Some videos are only 1kB and I think a couple are missing. Any chance of filling in the gaps with a second torrent? It would help me out a ton.
,timramone,2012-10-29T15:20Z,"Well, I just used `wget` with direct link to every video..  I think 66th video is the last one and all the videos after 66th are actually ghosts =) Just try to open them with any text editor and you'll understand, what I mean ;)"
,timramone,2012-10-29T15:24Z,"oh, I found the link! https://d19vezwu8eufl6.cloudfront.net/algs4partI/recoded_videos%2Falgs4partI-74.mp4 u can try by yourself. There aren't any video after 66 :)"
