,ag_orange,2012-10-25T14:08Z,Tnx m8....only 1 question--where do u change resolution? It starts in windowed mode and I can't change it...there's no option in settings and i cant find configuration file in game folder. 
,Orbnotacus,2012-10-29T01:21Z,"Orange, there totally are settings in the options for resolution. And this game is good and all... but the PS1 version is WAYYYYY better. I suggest getting ePSXe and the Life ISO. :D"
