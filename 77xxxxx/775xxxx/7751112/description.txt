This Walt Disney's two part television movie is a remake
of the original movie called The Absent-Minded Professor.
It was made in 1988 and now very much forgotten -- it
isn't listed in the actors wikipedia pages and Disney
Channel doesn't show it. It is a very 80's movie with
old macintoshes, nerds and the world view of technology
and computers being very 80's in a fun way. Because
I didn't find any existing torrents or DVD version on
sale for this I decided to rip the old TV recording I
still had on a VHS tape. Picture and audio quality is
as good as was possible -- remember it is an old analog
TV recording after all. There are also finnish subtitles
included as hard sub, but if you don't know finnish you
can try to ignore them because the audio is original
english.

"Henry Crawford is the titular absent-minded professor
busy at work in his laboratory. He has a girlfriend, but
she is getting frustrated at his repeatedly missing their
dates and spending more time with his experiments than
with her. One day, Prof. Crawford makes an incredible
discovery a form of rubber that defies gravity with each
bounce, which he names Flubber. Hopefully, with this
invention Crawford can prove to his love that he's not
just a hopeless loser stuck doing dead-end research."
