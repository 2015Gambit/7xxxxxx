Non sequitur. If people don't care for suffering while living their lives in free markets, they won't care either living under socialism, for example.

You may say that science is ""utterly indifferent to the suffering of people"", but that's not what science is for - it is for identifying the Truth.  Capitalism is merely the application of scientific principles to economics - allowing free inquiry and forbidding fraud.

Caring, under any system, is up to individual people.  Under capitalism, they are free to care or not care voluntarily.  Under all other systems, individuals are manipulated and brutalized by whatever lying thugs happen to be in charge.  Those thugs have no reason to care for anybody - they own your ass no matter what."
