No additional crack required. Checksum is COQS as it should be."
,sergio_sos,2012-10-24T01:02Z,"It includes Legacy of Rome, right?"
,Jason310M,2012-10-26T00:13Z,Anybody know where I can download 1.07b?
,matague,2012-10-27T05:34Z,"I installed the 1.07b patch on top on this and the DLCs are not working. It shows up on the list when I started the launcher, but I can't select Muslim nations (need Sword of Islam DLC it says) or ruler designer. Anybody can help?"
