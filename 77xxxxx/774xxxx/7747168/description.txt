Supplemental materials for teaching philosophy to kids.

Big Ideas for Little Kids - How-to book by Thomas Wartenberg
Videos - of actual workshops with children in philosophical discussion
Two books (Sophie's World, Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar)

This, plus the seven books (see other torrent named "7 Childrens Books - Philosophy for Kids"), plus freely available guides from the WWWW, should be everything you need to get started.
