Put some work into this one so honestly, help seed this.

Contains the following:
-----------------------
63 Rebuilt from 3 part chunk webripz full episodes from the 1998 TV Show "New Addams family" - IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172031/

The 1977 Halloween special "Halloween with the New Addams Family" - 
IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126771/
(Figured toss that in cuz Halloween's coming)

They vary in resolutions, mp4 format, probably look better on handheld than actual tv. Rebuilt them cuz there isn't any full rips of these up here that i could find, i kept finding the movies and the classic black and white Addams Family. Dunno if its a full set, its a good pack of them tho.
