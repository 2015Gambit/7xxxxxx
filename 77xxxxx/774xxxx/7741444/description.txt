When Ajib (Zizan Razak), a mat rempit, dies as a result of joining an illegal drag race, he becomes a spirit trapped between the world of the living and the dead. What he needs to do to move on is to settle his real world affairs with his family, something that is almost impossible when he is helpless to do anything. That is, until he realises that he can be seen by Ibrahim (Fizz Fairuz). Will Ajib be able to find peace and move on into the afterlife?
