,wesam2015,2012-10-24T08:43Z,Thank you sir for your reply but I see 36 peers all of them are not more than 85% and no seeders
[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-24T14:34Z,Seeding again. I need more people to help seed this or no one will get the complete torrent.

[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-25T20:11Z,Seeding Again as requested on Suprbay ;-)
,jrigors,2012-10-25T23:32Z,"On install around 2% I keep getting the message ""please insert disk AdobeMasterCollection6-EnglishJapan to continue"". Any idea how to fix it?"
,jrigors,2012-10-25T23:48Z,"Figured out the issue, had to copy files to hard drive instead of running installer from virtual drive. "
,wesam2015,2012-10-26T00:14Z,"@jrigors,
what program you are using for mounting the .iso file?"
[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-26T02:40Z,"Don't mount this .ISO or you'll get the ""please insert disk"" shit.

Burn it and the install will be fine or run it directly from the download."
,wesam2015,2012-10-26T03:48Z,"But I don't have multilayer-ROM.What should I do?
and what do you mean by saying ""run it directly from the download""?"
,wesam2015,2012-10-26T06:00Z,"May I know that Photoshop is the extended Edition or no?
It would be much more great if it's the extended,I hope so."
,rasara_ski,2012-10-26T11:11Z,I followed all the instruction verbatim but it asks for an Adobe ID each time i start an application except for Acrobat Pro X. Does it not crack it fully?
[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-26T20:32Z,"Just X out of the ""Sign In"" window. Then select ""yes"" from the following window which asks you are you sure you want to quit.
It's just a small irritation but doesn't affect the functionality of the software. "
,BubbaDawn,2012-10-27T04:12Z,"Tried to run crack and got ""unhandled exception has occurred in your application... Could not find a part of the path '.64bitamtlib.dll'"" what do you recommend? I am currently running Cs4 so I was wondering if that might be a problem. "
,rasara_ski,2012-10-27T08:05Z,"Thanks Kaiser. Yeah, it is an irritation but as long as the it works we are fine."
[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-27T08:24Z,"BubbaDawn

What are your O/S specs?"
,BubbaDawn,2012-10-27T19:29Z,"Thanks for getting back so quick. Win 7, icore 5, 6g ram. "
,woopSwoop,2012-10-27T20:32Z,"I am also having the same problem as BubbaDawn... I also have win7, i5 and 6gb ram..... Help!!!"
[V],2010kaiser,2012-10-27T21:57Z,You'll need to manually overwrite all the amtlib.dll files.
,echaz,2012-10-27T23:15Z,I'm having the same problem as Bubbadawn.  I have a Windows 7.  Can you tell me where exactly are all the amtlib.dll files and what exactly to overwrite them as? 
,m0nday,2012-10-28T22:37Z,I had the same problem as a few others with the crack not overwriting the dll file. I used http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7753873/Adobe_CS6_Master_Collection_Patch_x86x64 with this torrent and it worked like a charm. I'll be seeding for some time. Thanks OP!
,wesam2015,2012-10-31T23:05Z,"Who could have gotten Photoshop to be extended not just standard?
Please help.
Thank you."
,damesansmerci,2012-11-09T21:34Z,"I've tried overwriting the amtlib.dll files, and it still acts as if I'm running a trial version.  Windows 7 64 bit."
,xoxobarbxoxo99,2012-11-12T23:32Z,"ok i think i must be an idiot.. I've tried running this just off the download, I got the insert disk crap.. so I tried using virtual clone drive, got the same msg.. now if i try I need to sign in with my adobe account.. HELP please... I have windows 8 32bit OS 4g ram intel core2 duo "
,Zorphanlord,2012-11-17T09:30Z,"Mine hasn't worked. I'm getting a message when I try to run the Mastercrack saying:

Unhandled exception has occurred in your application. If you click continue, the application will ignore this error and attempt to continue. If you click quit, the application will close immediately.

Could not find a part of the path '.64bitamtlib.dll'.

I clicked continue and nothing happened. Any help would be appreciated. "
,Nectove,2012-11-22T00:21Z,Can I update the programs? It is prompting me to update....
