
This is the way the world endsΓÇªnot with a bang but a scream in the dark.
 
It begins at dawn, when the sun rises late. Then the holes appear. The first forms in Central Park, in sight of an apartment where Repairman Jack and a man as old as time watch with growing dread. Gaping holes, bottomless and emptyΓÇªuntil sundown, when the first unearthly, hungry creatures appear.
 
Nightworld brings F. Paul WilsonΓÇÖs Adversary Cycle and Repairman Jack saga to an apocalyptic finale as Jack and Glaeken search the Secret History to gather a ragtag army for a last stand against the Otherness and a hideously transformed Rasalom.
