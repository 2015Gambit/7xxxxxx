,catflusher,2012-10-20T08:51Z,"Wow, yet another encode stolen from YIFY and renamed."
,xViviDx,2012-10-20T11:12Z,yify hasnt uploaded this one yet.  look on his site its still to come
,ToniOPatife,2012-10-20T18:20Z,"Great upload ""GlowGaze"" thanks

Yes Yify hasn't uploaded yet this movie, ""catflusher"" please the next time go see things first and then comment."
,ben7530,2012-10-20T18:29Z,"RE: YIFY:

GlowGays IS a re-naming Piece of shit. 

Also, did you notice the tags? WTF does this have to do with spider man, dickhole?"
,xzxero,2012-10-20T18:56Z,"xViviDx and ToniOPatife
you are both wrong YIFY did in fact upload this torrent sometime yesterday i managed to grab it before they removed it for some reason.

the folder was named

The Campaign EXTENDED (2012)

The.Campaign.EXTENDED.2012.720p.BRrip.x264.YIFY.mp4

The.Campaign.EXTENDED.2012.720p.BRrip.x264.YIFY.srt


and of course GlowGaze does in fact steal and rename all of YIFY newest rips and re upload them or else he would comment saying otherwise.

so both of you do research before bashing catflusher."
,xzxero,2012-10-20T18:59Z,"to further prove the point

if one you post a mediainfo summary of the file i bet it will match this one exactly

if you honestly believe what you think do what i said and post a mediainfo summary of this file.

ill guarantee they're identical.

thats why glowgaze won't say otherwise.

and by they way you're a retard for thinking that a glowgaze version of any movie yify hosts is better because they're exactly the same.

get that through your tiny little skull.

,xViviDx,2012-10-24T05:33Z,xzxero: at the time of this upload and my original comment the movie was still in the coming up section on yifys site. seemed it wasnt uploaded there yet or anywhere i could see. but yes glowgloze does rip off all yify torrents. this is known to all yify fans. just he seemed to beat him on this one
,xViviDx,2012-10-24T05:36Z,ahh i c just read the uploader notes on yify site. was taken down. my bad. he really did steal this
,xViviDx,2012-10-24T06:15Z,reason it was taken down to if anyone is wondering is the audio is crackly. i think its unwatchable. still havent watched it. deleted it and got the real one from yify.
