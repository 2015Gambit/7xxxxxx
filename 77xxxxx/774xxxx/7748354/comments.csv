,Oblivilot,2012-10-22T03:40Z,"people don't seem to understand what ""fake"" means. This one is mis-categorized, but it's not FAKE. Fake are those spewing heaps of bogus torrents that show up daily, most likely posted by employees of various ISP's such as Comcast, and the RIAA. Fake torrents have no movie, they have viruses, and they are evil. This is not fake - it's an actual, watchable movie. It's not 720p in the strictest sense, but reserve your fake comments for fake torrents. And do us all a favor - when you see those deluges of fake torrents - like, 20 in 20 minutes - all the same file size, all uploaded back to back - report those bastards to Pirate Bay so their username and torrents get deleted. (steps off Soap Box) Thank you! Cheers... For everyone else, wait for BOZX and YIFY..."
,lynx25,2012-10-22T06:20Z,"it's a blu ray rip, the uploader of this torrent is a trusted with the pink skull logo guys"
,upx3,2012-10-22T22:45Z,"It'd be really nice to get multiple (& consistent) A/V ratings for this movie.

Also, anyone know why there's a seemingly 'identical' torrent ?

,Oblivilot,2012-10-23T08:08Z,"This is what a fake torrent uploader looks like:

By the time most of you click that link, their account will have been deleted. And another will pop up to take their place. As if the mythological hydra was really chubby douchebag office workers, employed by Comcast. Pimples by Cheetos..."
,upx3,2012-10-23T09:05Z,Nevermind... Hard-coded NL subs !
,Oblivilot,2012-10-24T16:22Z,"Here is another one of those fake torrent uploaders:

Notice the unusual and large field of blank space in each torrent? That is a common indicator of fake torrent evilness."
,Oblivilot,2012-10-24T21:33Z,"Here are two more fake torrent uploaders, both of whom have uploaded torrents of ""Skyfall"" claiming to be DVD rips. These usernames will end up deleted shortly, along with all their fake torrents.
