Notes: Loads was done on this, first we cropped and rotated the 720p files. Then we
fixed the perspective and resized the video. A very small amount of the vidoe is
cropped out on the right side, hardly noticable. There is no CAM movements and the
whole video is there. We also used a Denoiser, HQ smoother, Levels, RGB, Saturation
and more. For the Audip it's CA, but pretty decent CAM audio.. I clean it up and
adjust levels and took the noise out the best i could. Sorry for the long wait on this,
cause pf stupid digital watermarking..Boo
