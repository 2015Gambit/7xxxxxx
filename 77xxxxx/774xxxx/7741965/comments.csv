Thanks guys :)"
,milhousedan,2012-10-20T01:00Z,awesome album
,pirate_share_the_love,2012-10-20T02:11Z,"Good stuff guys. I just woke up and your sound is sitting very well with me atm. The distortion sample (I thought of it as anyway) on better days, helped counteract the fuzz in my head perfectly. I'm now onto the next EP and loving the electro/rock combo, very smoothly done guys, keep doing what you are for a while. Hope you fancy a trip down to Melbourne in the not to distant future too :) "
