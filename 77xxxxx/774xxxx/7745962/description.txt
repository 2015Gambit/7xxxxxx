Nazi Collaborators 
This series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. "How could they have done it?" How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. At the heart of this 13 part series lies one uneasy question. If you had faced what these people had faced, might you have done the same thing - and danced with the devil? All the stories are told through the experiences of individuals who were prominent collaborators. Through this we will give the full background of collaboration in nations and places across Europe and the Middle East.It is one of the final unexplored topics in the history of the war - as most of these secrets have been kept firmly locked away in the post war era.




13)  Hitlers KIller Police 
During the Nazi occupation of the Soviet Union the collaborators of Lithuania and the Ukraine became a vital part of Hitler's genocide against the Jews.
Many signed up to Nazi death squads, rounding up and shooting Communists and Jews in hundreds of towns across the occupied area. Many of their victims were fellow neighbours and countrymen.
One fundamental reason for this collaboration was that they hated the Russians and had bought Hitler's line that Jews and Communists were the same thing
