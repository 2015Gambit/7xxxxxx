,3bodnet,2012-10-27T12:17Z,"Hi m8 and thanks for your hard work
when I used these DLL files it worked great but some the photoshop features disappeared .. like for example the video layers.

do you know what should I do ?"
,John_Hill,2012-10-27T13:44Z,"Can't help you with it...
But try to install it again, open it and then paste the .dll and the hosts.
Hope this will help you."
,deadwarrior63,2012-10-31T20:49Z,"Thank you ever so much :) got a problem after my antivirus (Microsoft Security Essentials which i've now replaced with comodo) deleted them as false positives.. I also managed to extract the thingy's torrent but delete the original exe so to save downloading 1.3GB again i'll use this :D

I'll message thethingy later to ask if he'll up these himself (not to ruin your torrent but at least people may trust it more)"

,powercat,2012-11-12T17:54Z,I tried the .dll on Photoshop CS6 EXTENDED.  IT made it revert back to the regular CS6.  It is no longer the extended version.  Any wat to fix this ??
,HEELKris,2012-11-12T18:14Z,"Doesn't work, asshole"
,John_Hill,2012-11-12T21:45Z,"To powercat 
Replace the .dll files with the original or uninstal/install the program again on trial, run it for the first time to enable the 3D option and then copy the cracked .dll's from this torrent..

Hope it works for you!"
