,softkille05,2012-10-20T10:52Z,thank u HeroMaster :)
,cossiemk1,2012-10-20T13:27Z,Lol lordvo1demort12. You need a modified xbox360 and a modified dvd-burner to burn and play this game. Or a jtag xbox360 :)
,Assassinprofessor,2012-10-20T13:34Z,can you upload only single player?
,koooor,2012-10-20T15:49Z,can u upload just the single player disc
,reno.99999,2012-10-20T16:55Z,"for just single player, deselect disc one info in client"
,smilingze,2012-10-20T18:18Z,"am assuming this is an XGD3 correct ? would it work on LT2.0, if so can anyone please tell me how to burn it or patch it to work on LT2.0, thanks in advance ."
,box_77,2012-10-20T22:12Z,"Smilingze. ive not download it yet (ill wait a week or two cause its a new game and download is not very fast right now). but i guess its the same thing as resident evil 6 and borderlands 2 that i played with no issues. but ithink you can get BANNED if you your flash is LT2.0 !! (i never play live so in dont care). 
google and download : xbox backup creator and topology 2.0  and the xgd3 game. i didnt use abgx.
inject the topo to your game using xbox backup creator (takes 2 secondes). then u ready to burn with imgburn (speed 2.4X , layer break=optimal, choose truncate when it ask u).
install the game into hdd, and use the mp3 trick before u lauch the game.  Hope this help to play the game but not online!!  "
,smilingze,2012-10-21T00:55Z,"Thank you very much , I never play online on my 360 , I usually do the multiplayer on my PS3 , i have the game pre-ordered on PS3 just want to see if its worth it before spending $60 =)

I really appreciate your help .
I need to look the MP3 trick up then =) I have no idea what that is , but will give it a shot."
,strby,2012-10-21T16:53Z,on wich lt does this work...imars ure great but next time just write down on wich lt does this game work it would be a lotta easyer..does it work on lt 2.0?
,smilingze,2012-10-21T17:34Z,"I just burned two copies for LT2.0 and it didnt work , I tried to patch it and that didnt work either , am not sure what am doing wrong , I also installed it to the hard drive and tried the MP3 trick and that didnt work either ."
,Assassinprofessor,2012-10-21T18:42Z,"damn, it asks for dvd 1 for high definition, and i downloaded only dick 2 singleplayer..but at 51% said  the disk is scratched, clean the disk..damn"
,Assassinprofessor,2012-10-21T18:44Z,"btw, im on LT, patched the topology, but the game looked like a ps2 game without installing the multiplayer disk, since there 1.7 gb contains the HD.."
,gumph1688,2012-10-21T20:39Z,"@assassinprofesser - download the (Medal Of Honor Warfighter [HDTexture][USB]) instructions are in the comments, saves you downloading DVD1 i did it it works sweet, the game looks so much better "

,phoeniks314,2012-10-22T09:24Z,@Assassinprofessor are you on 2.0 or 3.0. Will this work on lt2.0 with injecting topology and truncate?

,Assassinprofessor,2012-10-22T20:37Z,"#gumph1688 a

,Assassinprofessor,2012-10-22T23:24Z,"#smokingmachine7 
 you have to have Disk 1 if u want HD, i tried without disk 1 n it looked like a game from ps2 era, lol..so my advice download  DIsk 1 n then platy it :))"
,dunit80,2012-10-23T08:15Z,Been downloading for almost 3 days now and only 24% done. SLOW SLOW SLOW
,dunit80,2012-10-23T08:18Z,@smokingmachine some of the multi disc games dont work on RGH xboxes. Those are the only games that you actually have to burn discs for. LA Noire wouldnt work on my RGH. Had to actually burn discs.
,fankoosh,2012-10-23T16:31Z,"ok i followed up steps by wiserxxx here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7746031/Medal_Of_Honor_Warfighter_[HDTexture][USB]
& confirm i succefully installed HD contents of game into my HDD , i used 8 gb external usb & format it in xbox then opened the Horizon & inject the hd content file into the usb took about 5-10 mins , then insert again into xbox & transfered the content from usb to xbox HDD , then played the single player Disck2 truncated disc method( CloneCD for burning & select burn till end of media not overburn ) after applying LT+2 Topology & insert the disc into xbox & playing it without problem or any error , i already updated my dashboard with usb method not from game disc "
,maikinfire,2012-10-23T23:05Z,Please GUYS  ''''SEEEEEEEEEED'''' i want to play this game
,cossiemk1,2012-10-23T23:33Z,"Jebus!! Stop nagin about LT2.0 and get LT3.0 and a propper dvd-burner, works every time :P"
,rauth213,2012-10-24T11:27Z,"I'm guessing multiplayer needs a pass, right, cus it's fucking EA?  Can someone confirm?"
,P_Greezy,2012-10-24T16:44Z,Its now verified and safe to play online!!! just make sure to run thru abgx 
,Smallz94,2012-10-25T02:34Z,"GUYS GUYS GUYS

I search up online about the online pass. YES you need a pass to play multiplayer. IF there is a LEGIT way (not those sites that you have to do surveys) that you can play online unless the research i did was total lie. So please dont burn this game if you dont have the pass. THE GAME REQUIRES A PASS!!!!!"
,eternal666,2012-10-25T08:33Z,"disk 1 i try to install 
to hdd at 27% 
says dirty disc>??
burnt fully
and verified fully
multiplayer is even freezing ?"
,Gvarimoto,2012-10-25T23:32Z,"Why is this so slow ? 1-8kbps ?
Everything else i DL i get 2-4mbps"
,ObserverInformer,2012-10-26T00:52Z,"Is this game worth the 16.28 GB to download?

In my opinion NO, don't waste your time and data. 

I played the campaign and 2 hours of multi-player - gave this game a chance to shine.

It's a poor cousin of BF3/ CoD. If you don't have either of those games - download BF3 instead as it's miles ahead in all aspects of gameplay.

Hope this honest feedback helps :)"
,Bossman112,2012-10-27T15:45Z,"when I press to play singleplayer, I get black screen ,nothing is working,but I am not freezed up,because I can click xbox home,and when I press          A or B I hear little beeping sound and thats all. "
