,Kanegasi,2012-10-21T05:44Z,Same shitty source. Thanks for getting my hopes up.
,AznAssassin,2012-10-21T15:08Z,"Its the same Mainland Chinese version tats been uploaded dozens of times. Nevertheless, its very watchable for a cam these is excessive blurring and lag when action scenes are happening (when things r moving fast across the screen). 
V: 8/10 (***FOR A CAM***. I cannot stress this enough. On an actual scale of DVD, Blu-Ray and rips, it would RATE A 4/10. For a cam tho, its decent). 
A: 6.5/10 - decent quality sound. Might have to turn the volume up a little bit more but its of a good standard.
Get it if u cant wait for Dec 4 and if u can stand the blurriness (i.e. ur eyes can withstand the pain of watching the blurriness). "

WATERMARK VERSION!!! READ BEFORE DOWNLOAD"
,alexbro01,2012-10-26T17:24Z,It works great. Just low quality. The watermark goes away when the actual movie starts
,In_Da_Club,2012-10-26T22:49Z,"Just be patient for a month or so, thats when the dvd/blue ray comes out. Its a waste to watch this on cam version."
,AtraxS16,2012-10-31T00:51Z,"Actually, using PowerDVD's TrueTheaterHD and TrueTheater Motion, the blur is really kept at minimum, also the picture is allot sharper, like some old fashioned Divx rips.
Combine that with some brightness tweaks and it's very watchable.
Seriously guys, today's video players (combined with a modern GPU) do a great job upscaling non HD vids.
I'm watching all my vids in PowerDVD, and get really great results.
It sound silly, but are you guys all on WMP and VLC? There are much more powerfull video players, PDVD not being the only one, just an example.
Thnx for the upload, and great movie.
Cheers."
,fragmatist,2012-11-02T18:46Z,Uploaders who mislabel TS as R* should have their trusted or VIP status revoked.
,upx3,2012-11-03T23:08Z,"I agree,

Attn Pirate Bay Admin:
Uploaders who mislabel Cam or TS as R*, should have their Trusted or VIP status revoked. 
This includes mislabeled RC as BluRay (retail release) rip.
It only takes seconds to check BEFORE uploading, there's no excuse.
Isn't that the reason that there's a Trusted or VIP status ?"
