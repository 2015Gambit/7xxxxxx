Born out of a Chinese father and Indian mother, Chinese Army Officer Lin Tan is in love and gets married to Sin. On their wedding night, Professor Tao Kai Chen summons him, gets him to under plastic surgery in order to look like Prince Shyam Singh, and arrange for weapons for the Chinese army so that they can attack India. Lin meets an alcoholic and disgraced Indian Air Force Squadron Leader Shyam, who was found guilty for killing Vijay Khanna. Alienated from his sweetheart, Leena Sen, he had taken to alcohol and had been befriended by Tao. Lin is then instructed to impersonate Shyam, kill him, and take his place - but Shyam overpowers him, and instead Tao mistakenly kills Lin. Shyam dons Lin's guise and returns home to Delhi - where he hopes to clear his name. This is where he will face many challenges when Leena will even refuse to speak with him, the community in general will shun him...
