,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-10-20T21:23Z,"Osmosian, that happens a lot with these for some reason.  If it bothers you enough, you may want to try other sources, the TV version (which I hate because of all the logos and crap on the screen), or possibly a different player that might have better playback results.  With this one, I would try another source anyway because the file size is just too small and it shows.  Lots of blocking and whatnot."
