,black_skull530i,2012-10-21T12:06Z,"@kevin1212 You have to remove the file from utorrent first. Remove it from seeding and completed sections and then try to delete.

And YIFY Thanks for your efforts... Really appreciate it..."

,420PakaLolo,2012-10-22T07:08Z,"Thank you YIFY, good quality rip, but...CINAVIA PROTECTED. You will not get audio after 20 minutes of streaming to PS3.


A/V = 9/9

Thanks though YIFY"

Kevin - You could always restart Windows and then delete the file.  Or a quicker way is to open task manager (CTL ALT DEL) and end the explorer.exe process.  Then START --> RUN and type in explorer.exe --> enter.  The file should now be deletable."
,mantikor777,2012-10-24T16:33Z,"CINAVIA Alert!!!  Get a different copy - if you watch on any newer devices (less than 2 years old) the sound  cuts out after 20 minutes.  I am so disappointed that YIFY uploaded a Cinavia protected movie.  Poor form, YIFI.  I thought you were better than that."
,firexninja,2012-10-27T20:19Z,thank you!
,Powerslave0,2012-10-28T07:12Z,"The only way to avoid Cinavia on PS3 is with Custom Firmware and a home brew player, OR, you must get a DTS version, that's a .MKV file.  Then you use MKV2VOB and preserve the DTS track (Will say patching DTS).  You then must have an audio receiver capable of DTS over HDMI in order to play it.  Other than that, ALL other versions will have Cinavia.  There is no way to get rid of the Cinavia protection.  Any source with it, and the rip will have it as well."
,Powerslave0,2012-10-28T07:16Z,"Also, not everyone uses Cinavia, so the devices being 2 years old, or less, is not correct for an overall outlook on it.  While most players now are MFRed with it, if the media doesn't have it, you won't get it.

Anything with SONY pictures will have Cinavia (they invented it).  It is up to the movie company to use it, or not.  

There used to be a list of Cinavia protected movies on Wikipedia under Cinavia, but it was removed.  Someone kept a list of movies, and what media format it was, that has Cinavia. "
,iamthefoetus,2012-10-29T04:17Z,YIFY you are by far the best uploader! keep em coming 
,markj801,2012-11-03T06:59Z,Is this Cinavia thing an issue with Roku boxes?
,alwaysodd,2012-11-05T04:21Z,"SOLUTION for the Cinavia issue:
I don't use game consoles for movies, but I do know that PS3's, and others I assume, play M2TS (bluray video format) perfectly.  tsMuxer converts .MKV to M2TS flawlessly.  That should fix it :)"
,CJClags,2012-11-18T10:40Z,"I wish I could put this somewhere where everybody would pay attention to it. 

Cinavia protection is automatic on most 2010 or later movies, but, older and not updated players will not know how to read Cinavia protection...because its new....

In other words your ps3 wont play it because you play online and update the firmware, ie installing the Cinavia monitor. I watch my pirated movies on an old BueRay player and dont update it.

Go buy an old BlueRay player somewhere and don't update it = no cinavia."
,CJClags,2012-11-18T10:42Z,"Converting is a pain in the ass and usually takes forever, and isn't a guarantee. fyi"
