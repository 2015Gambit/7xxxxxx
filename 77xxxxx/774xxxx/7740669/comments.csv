,NoFatChx,2012-10-20T23:36Z,"Been downloading since last night. 

Why can't these assholes adjust their upload speed? It's not cool to just download something and not seed. You should have AT LEAST a seed ratio of 1.5, if not more."
,Klondin,2012-10-21T06:45Z,Ill have this on my seedbox for a while.
,dlupi88,2012-10-21T11:14Z,5000+ seeder only 18kb/s wtf

,ahm3d2000,2012-10-23T14:00Z,"Sweeeet...thanks BOZX!!!

,mantikor777,2012-10-24T16:34Z,Can someone comment as to whether this one has Cinavia protection?  
,Kickyoash,2012-10-26T02:40Z,Possibly one of the best Torrents I have ever seen Audio-11 Video-11 yes it goes to 11!!
,mantikor777,2012-10-26T11:40Z,It is Cinavia protected for the information of those who are plagued by that issue.
,Powerslave0,2012-10-28T07:19Z,"Cinavia; if not using the DTS audio track.  Any conversion to AC3, AAC, or other than DTS, will have the Cinavia watermark.  "

,curtisf454,2012-10-29T21:35Z,"cynivia...you can download Miro Video Converter, essentally you can convert your movie into any format even PS3...once you do this you shouldent have any problems...i convert all my files to MP4 (apple) and just air play it off of my apple TV.  works great!!"
,Toad1951,2012-11-01T00:48Z,This plays great until halfway though the movie and becomes Cyniva Audio protected. Waste of time to DL this. It would have been great without the security measure in the middle.
,gogu68,2012-11-05T19:02Z,Cinavia protected shit!
,Dreight,2012-11-08T19:41Z,Cinavia protection only works if you don't use DTS. The PS3 looks at the audio stream frequencies to determine if it was pirated. DTS audio just passes through the PS3.
