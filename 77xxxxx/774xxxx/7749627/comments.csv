,drewg,2012-10-22T02:40Z,"Mine wont either. I just re-encode them to MKV using Nero Recode. A minor annoyance, but that's all it is."
,mr.geegoo,2012-10-22T04:35Z,All these mp4s they release choke my Apple TV so I have no choice but to recode as well.
,MyKrossini,2012-10-22T06:13Z,"Yeah, I have been trying to tell them for the last month or two that something weird is up with them. Just the FoV rips. But no one listens. People think they are smart because it plays on their computer with VLC media player... Yet they have no answers for why it wont play on xbox 360, samsung tvs (which I also have) and several other players. Things which are completely capable of playing this format just won't with the FoV rips. Every few weeks one of them might work. "
,turdist,2012-10-22T11:42Z,"these rips play fine on xbox360 and ps3, i am watching it right now.  maybe you need to update your dashboard or something."
,trixi50,2012-10-22T16:35Z,"My tv only plays avi files for whatever reason.....so I had to convert everything before I could watch....which was mad annoying.  I bought myself a blueray player and it  plays anything. It's a solution.
Thanx again eztv"
