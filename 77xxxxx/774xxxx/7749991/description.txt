This is the ultimate critical review of Cream, on record, on film, and live on stage. Drawing on rare film and television archive material, this independent and highly authoritative review revisits every single Cream album and critically reassesses the work of this legendary band from the glorious debut album right through to the demise of the band. 
A leading team of music critics, musicologists and working musicians consider vintage performances by Cream and trace the secrets of the bands success. This hard hitting powerful film makes no concessions to labels, artists or management and pulls no punches when it comes to deciding what made the music work and, sometimes, why it didn't.
