Name of the Game - Gene Barry - 1971 - Appointment in Palermo

Gabriel Dell as Rocco Amato, he's out to avenge the honor of his father. Luigi Bardi must die! Joseph Calvelli as Rico Amato, Rocco's brother & also the writer of this tv movie. I find Gabe in the best of form & funny as hell, even Joseph Calvelli cracks up onscreen as Rocco berates him for forgetting the bullets.

Gabe also does the voice-over in this movie, as Rocco.
