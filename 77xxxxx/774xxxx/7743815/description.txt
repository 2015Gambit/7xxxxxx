This is a short album of (12) 3 min. tunes played with Oscar's brand of funkiness.


Don't worry...there aren't any vocals.


Oscar Peterson's recordings in a rhythm section context (ie with a drummer and 


bass) swing much more intensely than his records with a guitarist IMO.


His single note melody explorations with the right hand are entirely appealing and 


with more precision than Bud Powell, the creator of bebop piano.  The jazz bug 


grabbed me after hearing these in the 1980's


In uncompressed .WAV because the album is short


All songs are good but 1,6,7,9 and 11 are outstanding
