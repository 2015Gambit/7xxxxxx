There are a substantial number of A/V drop outs in the first quarter of this version. It plays fine, albeit with noticeable audio drop outs, on Windows Media Player Classic. A Patriot PBO Core (w/ latest P70R2 firmware) though fails at the more substantial drop outs.
I wonder if this was from the original (nuked) source or the repack. I have yet to see a 720p version that is specifically tagged as a repack even though an SD version exists."

,Voshra,2012-10-21T13:06Z,"DOESN'T WORK. ends when the opening theme starts, BROKEN VIDEO. I'm just going to dl the standard def since I'm tired of waiting for a 720p."

,lifedra,2012-10-21T18:08Z,Works for me. But I cannot scroll through the video.
,h2ojames,2012-10-21T23:24Z,"please fix this, seems to stop just before the credits start"
