Changes in AnyDVD & AnyDVD HD 7.0.9.5, 2012 10 21:
 - New (Blu-ray): Support for new BD+ protection
 - New (Blu-ray): Updated decryption keys
 - New (Blu-ray): Added warning, if the Online Protection Database cannot be reached.
 - New (DVD): Support for new copy protections
 - New (DVD): Added option to remove CSS mastering errors. This has been enabled by default in the past, but is only needed for a handful of discs (e.g. ΓÇ£GoΓÇ¥, R2, Germany), and is now disabled by default.
 - Change (Blu-ray): Because of popular demand, the default Region code setting is back. Remember, if you want to remove the region lock of Blu-ray discs, you *MUST* specify the region of the *DISC*. Not of your player. Not of your country. Of the *DISC*. Check the packaging or the disc itself for region code markings.
