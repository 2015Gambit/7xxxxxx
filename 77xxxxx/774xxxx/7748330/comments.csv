,godhelpus,2012-10-26T03:16Z,"Thanks a lot. Works Flawlessly.

Downloaded the trial version of Adobe Acrobat XI from adobe website - http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=acrobat_pro&loc=us

Then install the Adobe Download Assistant and select/install Adobe Acrobat XI from the installs.
You need to have an adobe ID in order to install it. If you don't have it make it for free at adobe.com

Once everything has been installed then run adobe acrobat XI pro (again you will need to sign in to start your trial period)

Open up a pdf file using Adobe Acrobat XI. Go to file>> Save as. And it should say that your trial period has begun (remaining 30 days)

Now go to your default install directory for adobe
C:Program Files (x86)AdobeAcrobat 11.0Acrobat

Copy and paste the crack from this torrent here and run it as Administrator. Now something pops open. 

On first look it seems like nothing is working. Just click somewhere in the middle of the pop up that opens up. Then you should see OK button on the bottom left. And YES!! everything is good to go.

One thing to make sure is that you MUST see the trial period 30 days screen before you do this. Somehow it works after that, i.e. the patch works after activation has been done. 

Thanks again to the Uploader."

,ElFlaco-77,2012-10-26T19:50Z,"Hi. First of all, thank you very much DeGun for the upload. Have a question, how long does it take for the the patch application to work? I followed the instructions, ran the exe file and the music is playing but the ""Ok"" button does not say ok...it's just blank. I figured the patch routine is still running but it's been over 5 minutes now. Thanks again."
,posciena,2012-10-28T12:03Z,"Dear DeGun,
Your work looks very great on PCs!!
However, as a Mac user, would it be possible a similar patch; my due date for the trial version is in 23 days :((
Thanks for your great help!"
,mmodem,2012-10-29T02:25Z,"WARNING

This crack is infected with a win32:Malware-Gen viruz."
[V],DeGun,2012-10-29T21:42Z,"@elflaco : 10s to work , may be you need t add to your AV exceptions list ... + copy/paste into instal folder and run as admin.

@Posciena : if i know about it i'll say it here and will post it straight away ....

,cpuchallenged,2012-10-30T23:03Z,"Awesome!  i am so not good with computers...that said, DeGun is Da Man.
I followed the steps as outlined by god help us.  flawless.  If i can make this work a monkey can.  one thing in his steps i would change for dumb asses like me:
C:Program Files (x86)>Adobe>Acrobat 11.0>Acrobat"

,PyroTheGreat,2012-11-05T11:10Z,"Thanks a lot. Seems to work so far: The Trial reminder hasn't popped up again. 

What happens if we try to make updates or allow Adobe to connect to the internet? Will it deactivate the patch? 
thank you "
,mmodem,2012-11-07T17:42Z,"In answer to @sumpcracker:

Can you please explain what do you mean?
And yes this crack is infected with the virus:

win32:Malware-Gen

detected by AVAST."
,dwinag,2012-11-08T00:15Z,"CAN SOMEONE PLZ ANSWER THIS:
This is my first downloaded cracked program, so sorry for this stupid question..can someone tell me where to find the crack and the name of the file plz? thanx in advance guys! "
,xshine25,2012-11-15T08:43Z,"@DeGun Thanks for the ware!
@Godhelpus Thanks for the detailed instructions. 
I do have one question. I did not see the 30-day trial screen. Would this be because I had an earlier version installed? Should I have uninstalled that first? What should I do now, uninstall altogether and repeat the process? Thanks for the help guys!

@mmodem--It is not infected with no virus. The patch is what comes up as a virus, but without it this just wouldn't work. DeGun's ""careful you are officialy infected with the stupidity virus"" comment was noted with lots of sarcasm to say ""dont worry about that, it is perfectly fine."" ;)

@dwinag-The patch is in the zip file that you downloaded from the torrent. When you extract there should be 3 files the patch is the one with the little key & administrator shield. ;)"
