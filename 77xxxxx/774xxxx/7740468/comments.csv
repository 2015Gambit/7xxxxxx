We need an mSD or MrLss release of this."
,genocide44,2012-10-20T05:23Z,"commericals were not removed and video out of synce,waste of download even if it was a eztv rip"
,Malakore,2012-10-20T11:27Z,"There is short and cool commercial that I don't really mind at all and I didn't notice any audio/video sync issues.

I would never call that a waste of download."
,genocide44,2012-10-20T15:47Z,it was a waste as the commericals should had been removed before it was uploaded it was a sloppy upload.
,Malakore,2012-10-20T18:05Z,"It just depends on how you look at it. You can go and complain here like this, or you can enjoy it and laught.

For me it is still amazing upload - it was great fun for free.

To be honest I'm actually quite surprised that you mind 10 second commercial so much, in today's world which is full of them."
,genocide44,2012-10-20T20:36Z,"Malakore@ get fucked ,I got a right to complain "
,Malakore,2012-10-21T13:42Z,"I don't understand, why are you insulting me? I was just sharing my point of view.

So far it seems that not only you enjoy complaining about other's work, but you also can't handle mature communication.

In either case, I'm done here, this is leading nowhere. Have a nice day."
,genocide44,2012-10-21T15:49Z,"Malakore@ no need to be so high and mighty ,back off."
,genocide44,2012-10-21T15:52Z,Malakorei@ I wasnt insulting you lol
,You_Muppet,2012-11-03T02:14Z,"A&V=8. Ta

PS: the commercials are less than 30 seconds. But I suppose for a Gen Y, that's 30 seconds of their life that they'll never get back, so I can see why they'd feel entitled to complain. Muppet."
