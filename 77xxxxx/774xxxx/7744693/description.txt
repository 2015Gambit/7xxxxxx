Dysfunction is the second studio album by American rock band Staind. It is also their first release on any label at all, in this case the Flip/Elektra label. "Just Go", "Mudshovel", and "Home" were released as singles. The song "Mudshovel" can also be found on their previous album, Tormented, albeit in a slightly different form; this version of the song goes under the title of "Mudshuvel". It would serve as the band's breakout single and help Dysfunction sell one million copies worldwide
