,StonedYoda,2012-10-19T01:28Z,Are you serious? DVD and bluray rips get leaked at least a month before the sale date. Is this your 1st day here?
,fernandobribeiro,2012-10-19T01:40Z,THIS is HDTS !!!
,FriendlySpidey,2012-10-19T01:44Z,"^ You do know that DVDs aren't manufactured on the day they're released right? MANY physical copies already exist, the very same ones that will be in stores Nov. 9. "
,tec1985,2012-10-19T02:12Z,"Not bad at all! Not quite dvdrip but definitely one of the best copies out so far.

,Byff,2012-10-19T03:11Z,"@1944; Who died & made you the Great Authenticator. You sound like Chicken Little except with you it's ""It can't be real! It can't be real!"" Get a life!"
,Weissling,2012-10-19T04:08Z,"Read the info man, it's Region 2 (Europe/Middle East) just cause it's not released in the USA doesn't mean it's not released elsewhere"
,tec1985,2012-10-19T05:46Z,"Guys I know he was wrong about dvd releases and such, but this really is not a dvdrip. So lay off?"
,STAY-AT-HOME-GAMER,2012-10-19T05:47Z,THANKS FOR THE UP
,Fantomnz,2012-10-19T06:39Z,"How do you get a NEW RELEASE for free???????????

If you read that you already know!!

My ""Personal Opinion"" is that I get it before its out, I  get to see if I like it!! Then goto the movies to see it if available. ""The Island"" last enjoyed picture theartre visit.

This is not a chat forum for your pleasure!!!
It so you can give IYO (In Your Opinion) the quality of the DL & wheather you yourself liked it or not!!!

Thanks scene4all great work as always :)

,vendetta2112,2012-10-19T08:02Z,Thank you IMDB my buddy has been wanting to see this.:)
,PSPSPSP,2012-10-19T09:13Z,"@tech1985 This is a dvd release, a dvd is 4gb in size this has been reduced to 800mb so yea its going to lose some of the quality, doesn't mean its not ripped from a dvd. 
Oh and the green skull next to the uploaders name means its a trusted source."
,LordKeezah,2012-10-19T10:13Z,"Greatly appreciated, thanx!"

,oobaka,2012-10-19T15:20Z,aspect ratio is off. everyone is tall and skinny. Definitely NOT a dvd rip
,Malik1986,2012-10-19T17:37Z,"movie that is not scheduled for release on DVD and Blu Ray until Nov 9, 2012"
,b.rubble50,2012-10-19T21:01Z,Hey Byff what are you a bully online you got beat up in school right..
,Razdagar,2012-10-19T21:02Z,"Good quality A/V 9/9, aspect ratio is off though: use vlc and change to 2.21:1, that's the ratio closest to the right one as far as I can judge."
,Razdagar,2012-10-19T21:12Z,Aspect ratio is off: change aspect ratio in vlc to 2.39:1 For the rest A/V 9/9
,michaelrwatson,2012-10-19T23:36Z,"Yup... BAD A/R. You dipshits must be ripping w/o even looking at the screen. Or are you just recompressing someone else's bad rip? (i presume)

Yes, you can resize on the fly w/ VLC and other players, but i don't want my PC working harder just cause i downloaded someone's crap rip."
,glittergirl97266,2012-10-21T21:09Z,Really Scooter1944? Are you a torrent virgin? Perhaps you are one who thinks that DVD's just magically appear on the day they are released and are most definitely NOT manufactured months ahead of time...
,Str1kerz,2012-10-23T02:56Z,"Am I the only one that thinks the audio is terrible? The video is below par as well, but watchable if it weren't for the noise. Makes my ears bleed! Thanks for the up anyhow, but my search continues."
,Herding,2012-10-25T07:01Z,"A=8
V=6"
,crazy_tech,2012-10-25T12:25Z,"for all the haters (@scooter1944 ) your getting a FREE COPY of something you would otherwise have to pay for only thing u need to say is thank you to up-loader and say at most a 1-10 , v 1-10 and if u liked or disliked to movie and if not it had viruses or not on that note: 

thank you scene4all "
,rafreitas04,2012-11-02T17:41Z,"Good quality, thanks!!!!!"
,Video_Veg,2012-11-13T18:31Z,"Good Movie. Aspect ratio I preferred to set at 2.35:1 in VLC for my wall projector. Show has the usual baggage of personal fluff and required background for a 'first of the series' movie, but not infantile; and for once in very few productions - no hostage event! Thank you for your breaking from that seemingly mandatory inclusion. Decent Movie.
A and V both =9,  and Thanks for DL and to all seeders."
,PapooseAnn,2012-11-21T05:12Z,Thank you for sharing!
