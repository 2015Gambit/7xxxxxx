The xbox 360 controller is not a 1 size fits all item.
There are many many games, that it will not work for, and many more games coming out in the future it will not work for. 

Google your problem and find out if it's even a game made with compatibility. 

The only games 100% promised to work are games with the GamesForWindows(Live) association.

I think its funny how so many people think every game comes with xbox controller support."

Hey, I'm on Chapter 13 and I'm stuck. I broke the washer and talked to the maid, turned the cross and found the hole. But the maid just keeps walking around the house. She eventually gets to the bathroom but then just walks around for a minute and leaves to walk around the house again. I tried watching through the hole when she goes in, tried standing in the hall, I even tried closing the door behind her but nothing works, its very frustrating please help"
