,Synopis,2012-10-21T19:40Z,Works but I have no sound. At all. Not to mention the opening credits are laggy as fuck.
,ThaSirPeka,2012-10-21T19:55Z,"How does it works?
I've never used LumeEmu...

I've copied all the files in C:Program Files (x86)SteamSteamAppscommonRocksmith.
I've extrades LumaEmu and the crack in that directory and i've edited the LumaEmu.ini:

SteamClientDll = C:Program Files (x86)SteamSteamAppscommonRocksmithsteamclient.dll

But when i execute the .exe it shows all in black and if i press any key it exits to windows.

Any help?

PD. Thanks for the crack. You are awesome guys 
And thanks to themperror also for the files."
,t0d,2012-10-21T20:18Z,"Thanks guys! That's so awesome. One question - will it work with this torrent? http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7730545/Rocksmith_PC_Retail_DVD_(no-crack) or do I need the ""Backup Files"" one?"

,TC91,2012-10-21T20:40Z,"I have the same issue that ""Synopis"" has

The crack works, but i have no sound, it crashes some times and the intro is laggy as crap

@ Win 7 x64"
,Themperror,2012-10-21T20:47Z,"Forgot to say that the steam_appid.txt needs to be set READ only (right click, properties, read only etc)

This should fix the black screen issue.

As for the sound issue, I do not know..

try the basics.
Reinstall Direct X (latest version)
C++ redist 2010 (both the x86 and x64 version)
updating sound card drivers..
make sure you follow this guide:

If things still don't work 100%.. Then I really don't know.. maybe there will be a later version of the crack (if that's so then I will upload it again for you guys)"
,ThaSirPeka,2012-10-21T21:15Z,"Thank you so much Themperror.

The crack is working fine for me right now.

Sounds with noise sometimes but it's not a problem at all."
,piratefrs,2012-10-21T21:28Z,"it's awesome that someone made the crack, I could'nt work on it last night i had a party to go.

@tod, that release comes with packed and encrypted files, phoenix fails to extract then, so u need to download the first release on the description.

the crack is working for me, but i dont have the cable to test it, the sounds from the intro videos works(ubisoft logo and shit).

could anyone post the full cable descriptions so i can try to make a virtual driver for it?
on Device manager/(cable) properties/Details, 
from Device description to class Co installers
lets see we can pull this off.
thanks

@ThaSirPeka, on the rar there's a file called steam_appid.txt, make sure u extracted it and make it read-only

does this crack works well with the cable?"
,piratefrs,2012-10-22T06:16Z,"ok, after several hours debugging the rocksmith exe with ollydbg i gave up(but i was close, i think)
it uses pid and vid(from hardwareID (probably getting then on the registry)) and the name
perhaps it looks for other things as well, but that's the only ones that i've seen.
here is some address that might be helpful to anyone trying to bypass the cable check:

just get the realtone cable, at least you save $60 on the game, $25-30 is not too much"
,Aerionix,2012-10-22T07:51Z,"Just another confirmation that this does work.  Follow the instructions to the letter.  I also had to crank up the volume on the recording tab for the real tone cable sound settings in Windows (treats it as a microphone)  Before I did that, it wasn't picking up any sound from the guitar at all.  Now it's flawless and no lag that I can detect at default settings.  Can't thank you guys enough for this.  Hated the load times on xbox for it."
,Sadler2,2012-10-22T08:51Z,"@piratefrs as I see, it may use 3 input modes: PortAudio (by default), WaveIn and one more. If we will select the WaveIn mode, it will stop checking the pid, vid; instead it will check the device name, sample rate, channel count etc."

,applepure,2012-10-22T11:03Z,"here is a proper toturial and the way it worked for me:
1. Download http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7745402/Rocksmith_Installed_Steam_Files

and unrar it into any folder you like. u will notice that 1 file is corrupted. press close and it will continue unraring.

2. replace the corrupted file with this file:
mediafire.*** /?b2mm9gxobkce225
change the *** to com

3. extract the file into
......RocksmithBaseGRAssetsGR_PropsGR_AmpJC

4. Download: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7748964/Rocksmith_Crack_(By_Themperror_and_Sam2k8)_CRACK_ONLY

you can open this rar with winrar and extract it into the games main folder

5. open with double click LumaEmu.ini and change the last row into the address that SteamClient.Dll is in. it should be in the games main directory by now..
last row should be: SteamClientDll = (The place u extracted)Rocksmithsteamclient.dll
press file save

if the game gets stuck at start you need to change your playback sound configuration. there are some formats that wont work. 
also update your drivers.

6. right click on steam_appid.txt -> properties and check read only.

and the run the game like a pro.
enjoy 
real thx to all the people that helped, you are awesome."

Question. Does your method work with line in into the sound card(using a 1/4"" to 2.5mm adapter) or is it for something else.  I dont know what setups people are testing your method with.

if i keep ForceWDM=1, i have absolutely no sound in the game(no game sound, no guitar sound) but the game recognizes my sounds.
Either way i have no way of playing yet. If someone know more about this ForceWDM pls let me know. 
Also i did disable all recording devices, etc.

I've encountered that problem too. Sometimes the game just don't register the notes. Can't play notes or tune the guitar. I'm not sure but I think it has something to do with whether or not I play in the loading screens.

It's working for me, i unplugged my microphone and desactivated in my sound panel. The guitar is plugged in the blue jack (input line).

In the line-in properties, I have unchecked “listen to this device” and set the audio format to 16 bits, 48000 Hz. In the Speakers properties, I set the line in level to 100, but keep it in mute, I also set the output of the speaker to 16 bits, 48000 Hz.

,sephiam,2012-10-26T13:14Z,"regarding latency:

it all has to do with the rocksmith.ini
and getting the lowest values to work with
LatencyBuffer
and
MaxOutputBufferSize
-------------------------------------------------
without noise and sound cracking (it has to do with how good your soundcard regarding WDM - ASIO DOESN'T WORK AND DOESN'T MATTER!)
--------------------------------------------------
LatencyBuffer should ideally be 1
and MaxOutPutBufferSize has to be divided by 16
-------------------------------------------------
try getting it to work with LatencyBuffer 1
and MaxOutputBufferSize 128

if it gets stuck/the noise crackles, double the maxoutputbuffersize to 256..
keep going untill it's good

LatencyBuffer has a bigger effect and adds way more latency if enhanced.. so avoid it

,sephiam,2012-10-27T03:01Z,"@TheRoko121

setting 0 to either MaxOutputBufferSize or LatencyBuffer just lets the software determine the value itself, automatically, which isn't.. hmm.. precise.

i'd suggest fine tuning manually instead of using 0 on either setting

also, guys getting notes not registering/lossy reception - i'd suggest playing with those settings too.. if either of them (MaxOutputBufferSize/LatencyBuffer) is too low for your sound card to handle, it'll probably won't work

and try ""listening"" to your device (through audio settings) to make sure you don't get too much feedback/noise from your connection. that'll obviously make things work bad.

good luck"

the only issue I'm having is some pretty bad visual input lag. This might be what's causing notes not to register for some people. I have to stay about .25-.50 seconds ahead of the note highway to get the notes to register on time. I just play with the groove of the songs to get the timing right. I'm getting almost zero audio lag so I don't get why I'm getting such bad input lag. I've tried using the USB connection on my fender mustang amp and get even worse input lag. I expect some input lag but not as much as half a second.

@SgtMeowmers
I get some fps problems during events sometimes too using a 5770 overclocked to 990/1400 and a athlonII x3 at 3.6ghz with 4gb of ram. My system isn't amazing but it plays much more demanding games than Rocksmith just fine. A lot of people complained about this happening on the console version too so I think it's just a poorly coded game. It seems to happen mostly when the game zooms out on the note highway to show most of the fretboard. Turning the visual settings to low makes no difference."
,dilinwe,2012-10-27T05:55Z,"The solution that finaly work for me are below:

1- Changed Rocksmith.ini to new.old to avoid the ubisoft logo freezes at startup.

3- Nothing more changed, the .ini file is default.

4- I have a Ephipone Zakk Wylde model with the bullseyes, moded with a floyd rose tremolo, so to pass the checksound, i only play the tremolo until i get the correct tone.

,sephiam,2012-10-27T12:05Z,"listen guys, professional sound cards and audio devices usually use a technology called ASIO to get minimum latency.. Rocksmith doesn't support that natively - it means that you might get better latency with your onboard soundcard than with your professional one/external device..

Also, if it freezes on the first video (ubisoft) it means the values on you rocksmith.ini are too low. read my previous posts."

i'm using my onboard VIA HD (realtec) line in connection, it has some noise (especially when they add distortion and overdrive in some songs)

had no issue of notes stop registering midway..

i noticed the ForceWDM is kinda like setting BufferSize/LatencyBuffer to 0, meaning everything's automated and delayed.. so i rather not use it.

ExclusiveMode1 also let me have better latency.

when i first started i had my input volume at 100 and guitar volume at 100 and it did register worst then it does now - now i'm at halfway volume on both settings..

again, i advice you to ""listen"" to your device to make sure you have no noise/the connections are good/the adapter is good/you're using your cleanest pickup on the guitar etc..

if it stops registering notes AT ALL midway then it's probably settings (rocksmithini) related, though..

,sephiam,2012-10-27T15:56Z,"err, everything seems okay
just consider that your latency is a factor of
MaxBufferSize x LatencyBuffer

meaning what you have now is basically the same as MaxBufferSize 256 and LatencyBuffer 1..

I'd stick to latencybuffer 1, it seems to have a negative effect - placing a higher number

other than that i have no idea.. make sure no other software that might interfere with rocksmith runs in the background, anything sound related.. eliminate windows sounds too and other input devices..

midway writing this comment i realised something - the whole latency-soundcard ordeal is completely output related, meaning i can probably use my Hi-Z low noise professional input device (and audio card) and get better results, as long as i make sure it outputs to the crappy onboard sound card.. i'll come back with results

good luck dude"
,sephiam,2012-10-27T16:54Z,"ok, so that didn't go as planned but i learned something along the way

switching to the good audio card's input worked, and the notes did register better, up untill they stopped registering after 8 minutes of playing..

meaning any problem you might have has something to do with Rocksmith's compability with your soundcard's input - my line in works well, but my good input sucks..

so now that we know the problem, try updating your sound card drivers / using a different input (if you have any)..

,moeburn1,2012-10-28T14:30Z,"@Mateka111 - If it was an issue of intonation, the game would recognize that as a wrong note; either too high or too low, and it would show a little icon on the higher or lower fret and tell you so.

Our issue is not intonation, or the guitar playing the wrong notes.  Our issue is that the game suddenly stops recognizing the guitar is being played at all (while still playing it through the speakers)"
,moeburn1,2012-10-28T14:32Z,"on MY rocksmith, it will work completely fine for about the first 10% of the song.  Then even when the next bit of the song is the SAME notes, on the SAME frets, it just suddenly stops hearing my guitar."
,vision139,2012-10-28T15:39Z,"Same thing for me the notes that worked just stoped working so its not my guitar its the game or the crack...

I wish i could just buy the cable but its not available in Croatia yet...."
,moeburn1,2012-10-28T16:29Z,"So unfortunately I did the ""make some noise"" noise check with the ""dc offset"" and ""noise cancellation"" enhancements checked in the windows control panel.  I also had to plug in my MP3 player into the microphone input to get past the ""make some noise"" part because I couldn't play my guitar loud enough to completely fill the bar, I'd get to 90% and then it would just drop back down again.  

Those two factors are probably what's causing the problem.  But if I uncheck the ""dc offset"" and ""noise cancellation"" in the windows control panel, the game doesn't hear my guitar at all for some reason, probably because the noise check calibrated that way.  "
,woa997,2012-10-28T16:45Z,"ur doing it wrong, cause for me its working like a charm :) check recording volume and your guitar volume. And plug into INline port behind the computer(front panel making noise for me)"

I have managed to get the fixed no cable exe working but unfortunately the interface i use, M-audio Fast Track, has one channel split into left and right. In other words the mic input is the left channel and the 1/4 input is the right channel - Rocksmith always chooses the mic input. There are a couple others around the web with this problem, but I am sure there are even more who just gave up. Any tips? Thanks."

,Mateka111,2012-10-28T19:12Z,"vossenw

If you can't manage to block mic input then buy a jack adapter(6.3 to 3.5) so you can plug your guitar into mic input."
,vossenw,2012-10-28T19:16Z,"Its an xlr input, and it cannot be disabled."
,sephiam,2012-10-28T19:18Z,"hey guys

vision, don't be an a-hole.. piratefs' & sadler's crack works for some, doesn't work for others.. it's more than anyone else on the internetz did, and you should appriciate it even if doesn't work for you.

2.due to the fact i've had the problem mentioned  - notes stop registering mid-game but i can still hear the guitar - with one of my inputs - oddly enough the better one, but the mobo's linein works almost perfectly (90% registering solid),

and due to the fact that basically real tone's cable is just a different audio device,

i conclude that the problem with piratefs' crack has something to do with the input's comparability with Rocksmith.

i doubt anyone would ever create a list of compatible realtone-alternative-linein devices, and even if they do, it might also be a matter of drivers/operating system, but that's the deal..

your best chance is either trying different soundcards/slots for input (if you have more than one) or just buying the damned cable.

consider that you CAN use one device's input and another device's output, and that's preffered if that device's WDM/MME output is better and has less latency.

me? i'm waiting for someone capable of figuring out how to make the dlcs work with nocablefixnew, cause theemperor's awesome and he just released queen's catalog ^_^"
,vossenw,2012-10-28T19:20Z,The device works as 1 input - Left channel is xlr mic Right channel is 1/4 instrument but they are both 1 input.
,Mateka111,2012-10-28T19:27Z,"There's a slider in audio settings(not in the game), push it all the way to the right so it will record only using the right channel. It's somewhere in your audio driver's settings.

,moeburn1,2012-10-28T20:17Z,"well I've narrowed down the problem.  Every time I try something new, I make a new profile and go through the ""make some noise"" check thing, to let the game recalibrate.  It has something to do with ""DC Offset Cancellation"".  With it unchecked, I can hear my guitar through the speakers in-game, but the game can't hear it at all.  With it checked, the game suddenly works fine.

Originally, I was using my motherboard's onboard Realtek's front mic for input and my Creative SB Audigy for speaker output.  That worked for about 5% of the time, even with DC Offset checked, and then it would suddenly stop working.

So I switched the mic to the  Realtek rear mic for input, and the same onboard Realtek for speaker output.  As long as I had DC Offset Cancellation checked, it was working great!  For a while...

I managed to get up to about 250,000 RSP in about 6 songs until it suddenly stopped working again.  ARGH!!!"
,moeburn1,2012-10-28T20:19Z,"By the way, for anyone wondering, DC Offset Cancellation can be found my microphone's properties dialog, under the ""enhancements"" tab.  It is present on both the Realtek and the Creative inputs, which leads me to believe it isn't hardware-specific.  But it might only be available on Windows 7."

,moeburn1,2012-10-28T21:53Z,"not sure if it's related, but the output audio also cuts out pretty often in the game too.  Only for a second or two every minute or so, but it can be pretty annoying.  During that time when the audio has cut out, the game keeps going and (if it was working at the time) continues recognizing the notes you are playing, so as long as you don't need to hear the song you can keep scoring points.  

But it might be related to the notes not getting recognized.  Although if the input was getting cut out, then we wouldn't be able to hear the guitar through the speakers."
,moeburn1,2012-10-28T21:55Z,"can anyone that has the proper cable for this game confirm the bug we're having?  Where the game suddenly stops recognizing notes are being played, even though you can hear the guitar through the speaker?

man, it's worked
thanks"
,Thonace,2012-10-28T23:16Z,This version doesn't work with DLC sadly. You have to switch to the tinyiso crack but you're profiles will have to be restarted.
,guusert,2012-10-29T00:21Z,"Guys I want to share my experience so far and also ask a question. I've almost no lag or unrecognized notes. Sometimes after an hour it totally stops recognizing the notes. You should restart the game and eventually replug your cable into your PC. But some minigames just won't work. For some minigames the reconizition is really bad. Not that I really care about it.

What I installed and how:
1. I've installed the TinyISO version+crack

2. I've put NoCableNew.exe (page 8) in the Rocksmith folder

3. I deleted Rocksmith.ini and restarted my PC

4. I plug my cable in in my mic jag on the front (otherwise I might get noise) of my PC before I start Rocksmith. I'm using a 6.3mm male to 3.5mm female plug into my guitar and a 3.5mm extension cable of 1.5 metres.

5. I set the mic volume to 100% +0 dB (+0 dB! otherwise you will get noise)

6. I disable all other microphone devices, like my G35 Logitech headset mic and the StereoMix
The microphones I use for my guitar are 
Line-in VIA High Defenition Audio and Microphone VIA High Defenition Audio

7. I run Rocksmith as admin

I've experienced almost no problems so far. To get better latency you can also try plugging the cable in the back of your PC in the blue jag. You might get noise, but the latency is possibly better. Just try out what's the best for you. Maybe it's the red jag on the back of your PC. IDK! To get less noise you can also try to remove as many hardware as possible (mouse, usb sticks, etc.)

I'm gonna try the DLC fix tomorrow.

My question:
How to play multiplayer? I know piratefrs made a crack for it. But I can't connect two 3.5 mm plugs. I'll have to choose which one I use. Windows doesn't let me use 2 mics. Do I need to use a 3.5mm to USB adapter instead? I don't wanna spend alot of money on an adapter though (very max $30!). Or do I need to rename my cable to something? Help please..."

I'm using my homemade cable not the super expensive usb.
Now this is very important i didnt have a enhancments tab and everything worked fine so don't get alarmed if you dont have one.
You have to follow exactly how he said step by step. Now i noticed a couple of things i was playing for hours and everything worked fine and then when i entered the game again notes stop working but then again next time everything worked fine.
Make sure you disable all recording devices except the mic in. YOUR GUITAR MUST BE PLUGGED IN THE MIC IN IN THE BACK.
Make sure you dont have your browser open close EVERYTHING when you enter the game.
I also right click on your speaker properties and select dvd quaility there not sure if it does anything but i did.
I also downloaded the dlc crack here and that works fine aswel.
Any other errors your getting is because you havent followed the instructions closely or you havent set up that your using the mic in. Il be watching here the comments and try to help in any way possible :)

p.s. Thank you Themperror for an awesome torrent your the only one who got this game working all credit goes to you :)"
,Selphiphi,2012-11-01T17:07Z,"Hi folks!
Since I had some difficulties to get the DLCs (search 40 songs rocksmith on Piratebay) to work properly in my game, I registered to say thank you ('cause everything works perfectly now) and explain what I did if some of you have problems to get those awesome DLCs :

1) If you have no 'Content' folder in your Rocksmith directory, create one named like this, then copy all the .dat files inside.
2) ... Yet it might not be enough! Remember to do some editing in your LunaEmu.ini file (if you got Themperror's version of the crack, of course).
The important parts of this file are the [Log] (very useful to spot functionning issues) and the [DLC]. I set mine like this:

[Log]
# Create LumaEmu.log and LumaEmu_Steamclient.log
LogFile = 1

[DLC]
# Use this if you see the line ""BGetDLCDataByIndex"" in the log file.
AppID = 205190 #You'll find this value in the steam_appid file, if you wanna be sure

The AppID was useful for me since I was getting the error mentionned here in my log files, and the DLCs couldn't load inside the game.

3) If it's still not working (no DLCs in the songs menu of the game, damn) go on and replace your game launcher (Rocksmith.exe) by the one you'll find here :
depositfiles_com / files / 2vd5wwbqx (remove spaces, change _ to .)
It does fix the DLC loading issues I encountered. (/! don't forget to make a copy of your olds file everytime you replace some, just in case.)

4) YET, it is a double-function crack, 'cause it also allows NoCable playing.
I didn't mean to enable this feature but it was part of the crack and I really wanted these DLCs. So right after I got the crack to replace my launcher, and launched the game, I saw the DLCs in my songs list. Hurray!
BUT! When I wanted to play some guitar, the game started telling me I had several instruments connected to my PC, and that I should keep just one plugged in.
I assume this is because the NoCable part of the crack enables another mode of recording, or something.
To fix this issue, go to the sound mixer of your computer, to Recording Devices, and disable every item in the list except the Rocksmith plug.
This should finally do the trick, I personnally could play perfectly, once I got through all this :)

 I hope my research will help some people saving time when trying to install DLCs. Thank you again Themperror, you rock! m/(>_"

p.s. if your laptop crashes after 2 songs it might be for different reasons how is it playing other games? might be a laptop problem ( overheting, old graphics drivers ) you have to know that almost all of us couldnt even play 1 song all the way before some kind of problem happened.
Im here to help in any way i can :)"
,DarkKnight_6,2012-11-01T22:18Z,"One more thing if your intonation is off you will still notice that rocksmith is getting your notes and will tell you that you should play higher or lower cause the detuned intonation sounds a little bit lower of higher tuned note. But when it stop registering you will just see that no matter what you play and how you play it its like not even playing.
p.s. i also noticed sometimes when you mess around with the volume know or strum the strings too hard during the loading and menu notes will stop registering who knows why"
,smk3D,2012-11-01T23:42Z,"I'm also getting the non registering notes after a couple of seconds problem, I have the Tinyiso release with the nocable crack.

I'm on a W7x64 machine with an Audigy2 soundcrap, card*"
,Demonsthere,2012-11-02T09:44Z,"@DarkKnight 
The laptop is ok, it is a decent lenovo bought laast year and is capable of running Wither 2 with 75% graphics. The laptop is not crushing but the crack file (NoCableNew) and not after a song, after the first, sometimes second tune played. Interesting is that if I don't play at all the game works... Can there be an issue in the tone recognition that causes an crash ? "
,alexusm,2012-11-02T13:08Z,"Is there any way to use Line-In instead of Mic-In?

I'm using ASUS D1 sound card. In Mic mode i have background noise, so i cant go through 3rd check, where u must tune the guitar. In Line-In mode sound is clear, but game cant recognize notes during 2nd ""Make some noise"".
Anyone know the solution?"
,wass08,2012-11-02T13:12Z,"Okay now it works but I've got the registering notes problem, if I put the game on ForceWDM=1 it works fine for registering notes, but I don't have sound.. 
Any solutions? I tried every one solution in the comments !"

My rocksmith.ini contains this :

,WhiteTemplar,2012-11-02T21:42Z,"Okay so I finished downloading Themperror's version and notes are perfectly recognized (played 7 songs in a row, Guitarcade made notes crash, nothing this times).So the bug may come from TinyISO's version."
,guitarico34,2012-11-03T11:58Z,"hi, 
quiet perfect for me , except i would like to use my ugc102 berhinger instead of micro in cause the sound is awfull , got lot of noise (even with noise reduction active which is like a noise gate so, difficult to play long sustain note)

So, i have tinyiso version with the latest nocable-DLC fix crack and have all dlc active (thanx for the great job... )

The problem is with my usb ugc102. Note detection is not working ( like others, first notes ok, and nothing after.... )  But the sound of guitar is working perfectly, no noise, perfect like when playing whith guitar rig 5.

DOes anyone have solution ?

WhiteTemplar, what about your solution ? DOnt understand the difference between emperor version and tyniso cause the emperor crack not working for me. Have a steam app id error at launch .
"
,WhiteTemplar,2012-11-03T12:42Z,"Did you follow Moeburn's instructions on page 14? (the one which starts with TPB is being pissy) and the comment a bit later ?
Try doing a full clean install. I didn't think it would work changing from TinyISO to Themperror neither but it did, I still don't know why tho, it just does)

Good luck!"
,moeburn1,2012-11-03T22:49Z,"Glad to see I was able to help so many people!  I hate it when theres like a million steps to follow to get a game/crack working, and when people have been following the comments from page 1 finally get it working, they don't let anyone else know how they did it.  And worse yet, when you ask, they just say ""if you bother to READ, your question has been answered before!"" yeah not all of us want to sift through 15 pages of comments all at once just to get the game working.  

Lemme know if anyone figures out why, or a fix for, the game suddenly stops recognizing notes despite the sound still playing through your speakers!  I managed to get through 7 songs and +150,000RSP, thinking ""okay the game is working great I finally got it working 100%"", and then I switched from career mode to go and practise a song from the list of songs and it suddenly stopped recognizing notes altogether.  "
,tzeusd,2012-11-04T09:08Z,"The note thing happens to me too. I won't post here the settings i use, they are like everybody in here(almost). The thing that bothers me most, and i haven't found a solution yet is that when i use line in the game stops recognizing the notes on the first song. Although i can still heat the sound my guitar is producing, just like anyone else here. If i use Mic input, All works fine, but i have a terrible noise on the high gain/distortion songs. And i don't know how to get rid of it. Anyone has a solution to one of this problems yet?  They are very annoying. I did read trough these comments pages, but so far nothing works."
,wass08,2012-11-04T11:36Z,I tried with Themperror instead of TinyIso version and still the registering notes problem.. Why the fuck it's okay in the test zone and in the game the notes aren't registering !!!!
,WhiteTemplar,2012-11-04T15:23Z,"I'm starting to give up, my usb guitar link is 2 channels and it looks like I need one channel but I can't change this(well I can in amplitube but it won't apply in windows or anything).
It worked flawlessly yesterday but it doesn't work anymore now :/
I don't get any of this, guys who own the cracked version but the real tone cable do you have any problems?"
,WhiteTemplar,2012-11-04T16:51Z,"Nah actually it doesn't look like it comes from the 2 channel thing, with a jack adaptor (= not my guitar link) it works fine."
,peyol,2012-11-04T19:22Z,"Hello guys, I think I found a way to bypass a annoying bug with regognizing notes.

,smk3D,2012-11-05T02:32Z,"YES! thanks vision139, I disabled the audigy, and worked! nice. It stops recognizing in the techniques and mini games, but the songs work flawlessly"
,WhiteTemplar,2012-11-05T11:40Z,"Ok it works again for me(berhinger usb guitar link) I uninstalled every drivers of it (you have to do it in device manager and in the usb category too and check delete driver's files too)

But it stills only work on Themperror version so I think there really is some kind of problem with TINYIso's version.
I'll try with official berhinger drivers installed now and see what it does but basically with windows' native driver I could ask for 1Channel so the issue may come from here actually."
,snpwolf22,2012-11-05T16:32Z,"Ok WhiteTemplar i have the usb behringer too, with the themperror version it recognice all the notes???? or the problem is still there?"

I'll play some more to make sure this really works."
,spr333,2012-11-06T04:11Z,"MY FIX FOR THE NOTES NOT REGISTERING:

Close more programs!  I was having the problem with notes not registering partway through a song (still could hear the guitar).  I closed Skype and immediately the problem went away entirely.  My guess is that Skype (and probably other programs) try and access the recording device in some way which somehow breaks the exclusive lock on the device.  So try closing other programs, especially any programs that might potentially use microphone input."
,spr333,2012-11-06T04:13Z,"Also, my setup is:
Tinyiso version
Plugged into line in input on motherboard

I tried (much much earlier) with an M-Audio FastTrack Pro on my laptop but had no success there :/"
,DarkKnight_6,2012-11-06T23:10Z,"I'm glad more and more people are getting this to work.
So to sum up it works (for most of the people) with these rules. You have to have this steam version of the game from the torrent description, your guitar needs to be plugged in in the mic in NOT the line in.
Disable all recording devices except the mic in.
CLOSE all programs running in the background like skpye, internet browser and etc.
For people using the mic in and have noise look your gonna have noise ether way your using an on board sound card try disabling microphone boost in the microphone properties. I also noticed a big thing it has to do with your output if i play on my speakers everything works fine if i try my headset it doesnt anymore. So keep that in mind disable all third party software for sound. Hope it helps :) Good luck !!!!"
,WhiteTemplar,2012-11-07T15:24Z,"When I use my guitar link with windows' native driver it's recognized as mic in, so +1 for mic in instead of line in)
And +1 for Themperror's first link too :D
But I can play fine with Skype in background :/"
,guitarico34,2012-11-07T17:46Z,"whitetemplar : could you please explain how you get a native windows mic-in driver ?

can you explain a step by step guide to do this ?"
,WhiteTemplar,2012-11-07T19:21Z,"Go into Computer(Right Click) then go in manage then device manager, and unroll USB bus thing and audio, video, and game controllers then please do a screen.
But if in recording devices your usb guitar link is recognized as X(as a number)-Mic device or something like this it should be fine, but I don't know if it stills works fine I didn't try enough."

,Kyo3000,2012-11-10T01:06Z,"Heya! I downloaded this torrent and the first link: ""Steam files"". Question is, what do I do? Is it all in just this one pack? OR do I have to go on and install it?

Two, I'm reading through all of the comments. I'm seeing that you gotta go and change some file names and shiz... Can someone provide specific instructions and locations for windows users? It would be very much appreciated. 

The mediafire thing? Is that something to actually download because I cant find it anywhere or the file I have to change. 

~~~~~~~~~~~

Let me just quote : ""here is a proper tutorial and the way it worked for me:
1. Download http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7745402/Rocksmith_Installed_Steam_Files

and unrar it into any folder you like. u will notice that 1 file is corrupted. press close and it will continue unraring.

2. replace the corrupted file with this file:
mediafire.*** /?b2mm9gxobkce225
change the *** to com

3. extract the file into
......RocksmithBaseGRAssetsGR_PropsGR_AmpJC

4. Download: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7748964/Rocksmith_Crack_(By_Themperror_and_Sam2k8)_CRACK_ONLY

you can open this rar with winrar and extract it into the games main folder

5. open with double click LumaEmu.ini and change the last row into the address that SteamClient.Dll is in. it should be in the games main directory by now..
last row should be: SteamClientDll = (The place u extracted)Rocksmithsteamclient.dll
press file save

if the game gets stuck at start you need to change your playback sound configuration. there are some formats that wont work. 
also update your drivers.

6. right click on steam_appid.txt -> properties and check read only.

and the run the game like a pro.
enjoy 
real thx to all the people that helped, you are awesome.""

Awesome instructions, but I still don't get it. Sorry, but again, do I use skidrow's iso to install and alter it or do I download the demo from steam? OR none? I'm not used to this, thanks in advance! "
,Keishee,2012-11-10T10:38Z,"@Kyo3000

1) Download that http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7745402/Rocksmith_Installed_Steam_Files
When finished, extract it, it will say something like 'zomg file corrupted', ignore that for the moment

2) Download that mediafire.***/?b2mm9gxobkce225 (Replace *** by com)
And put it in   Rocksmith / Base / GRAssets / GR_Props / GR_Amp/ JC
This folder is located in the folder you just created by extracting the .rar

3) Download http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7748964/Rocksmith_Crack_(By_Themperror_and_Sam2k8)_CRACK_ONLY
Extract it and put all the files in the Rocksmith folder

4) Open the 'LumaEmu' file (which is in Rocksmith folder now) and edit the line
[SteamClient]
# Set path to steamclient.dll (not the original)
SteamClientDll = XXXXX
So that the XXXXX point where the file 'Steamclient.dll' is located
exemple: for me it's 
SteamClientDll = C:/Program Files (x86)/Rocksmith/steamclient.dll

5) Right click the 'Steam_appid.txt' file, then click properties, and finally check ""READ ONLY""

6) To play without the USB cable the game needs, download 
bayfiles . com /file/p2Kt/9hE8Es/RocksmithNoCableNew.7z [Erases the spaces]
Unrar it and put it in the Rocksmith Folder

7) Plug your guitar into Line in OR mic input

8) In the sound control panel, click the 'Recording tab' and disable (Right click - Disable) everything except your guitar (Which is 'Line in' or 'something mic realtek blabla')

9) Right click - Properties on your guitar then Click 'advanced' tab, select ""2 Channel, 16bit, 48000hz (DVD Quality)""

It should run now"
