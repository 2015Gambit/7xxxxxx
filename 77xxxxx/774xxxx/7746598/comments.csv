,snowbirds,2012-10-22T05:10Z,"I don't know who is stupider, GhostofMackisGod for being a troll all over TPB, or all of dozens of you who feed the troll by responding.

If you don't like a troll, ignore it.  Trolls hate to be ignored.  It makes them whither up and blow away.

If you argue with a troll then you are actually encouraging it. That makes you the same as the troll."

,vatel88,2012-10-22T07:55Z,"@Grindcorejihad Are you serious did you see Romero's last two movies? ""Diary of the Dead"" and ""Survival of the Dead"" are as much zombie comedy because of how awful they are.

The walking Dead is the only Quality Zombie made anything in decades."
,WinkyPirate,2012-10-22T19:47Z,"Thank you scene4all.

Anyone got any subtitles for this movie? English subs?"
,ironymon,2012-10-22T20:13Z,"Yeah the walkin dead series based on comics are awesome, zombie detail, and the story is intriguing... especially the latest episode where he MATCHETE that fags head right in the middle... damn i waited for that ever since they met."

Movie - 6

I don't think it is really necessary to get subtitles, unless you have a hard time hearing English/British people talk. But too any Zombie killing fan who would enjoy a good giggle whilst going on a fun onslaught, give this movie a check. Shows us that not EVERYONE fails during a zombie outbreak. Lol.

Thanks for posting scene4all!"
