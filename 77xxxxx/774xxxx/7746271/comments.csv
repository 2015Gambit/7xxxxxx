,car1015,2012-10-23T08:18Z,"I thought it was a very good movie. Compared to a lot of movies they had out this year, it's like they would just throw movies together, so many low budget movies, I think that they have taken movies as far as they can and can't come up with anything good anymore. V/7 A/6 M/8"
