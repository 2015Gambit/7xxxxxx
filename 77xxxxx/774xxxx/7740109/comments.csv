Also here's a site with the covers:

Thanks for the hard work!"
,SplhcbPrime,2012-10-19T03:23Z,"@ txrabbit:  the copyright IS 1997, indeed, but this issue was released and on the newstands etc in '96."
,txrabbit,2012-10-19T04:37Z,"Just to clarify, this one is considered to be 1997 issue, rather than 1996.  I double checked it with the copyrights withing the mag and the previously mentioned website.  I saw your comment to me on the 1997 upload, so I just wanted to post that I was correct here too.

Regardless, super job, look forward to the 1983-1990 uploads when they are available."
