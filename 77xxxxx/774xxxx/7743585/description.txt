Nazi Collaborators 
This series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. "How could they have done it?" How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. At the heart of this 13 part series lies one uneasy question. If you had faced what these people had faced, might you have done the same thing - and danced with the devil? All the stories are told through the experiences of individuals who were prominent collaborators. Through this we will give the full background of collaboration in nations and places across Europe and the Middle East.It is one of the final unexplored topics in the history of the war - as most of these secrets have been kept firmly locked away in the post war era.



11)  The Greek Collaborator 
During the Nazi occupation of Greece, Ioannis Rallis was one of three men who ran the country's Government, effectively a puppet regime installed to do Adolf Hitler's bidding. It would be an over-simplification however to say Rallis and his colleagues were simply Nazi collaborators. The story of Greece from 1940 through to 1944 is one of unthinkable conditions for its people, intense political infighting, and powerful resistance groups who would fight not just the Nazis but each other to the death. At the end of the war Rallis would be accused of being a collaborator. Was Rallis however just a staunch anti-Communist who shared Hitler's hatred of Bolshevism? What was the truth behind Greek collaboration? The country was occupied between 1941 and 1944 but after liberation, Rallis himself was sentenced to life imprisonment for collaboration and died in jail on October 26, 1946. In jail, he wrote a memoir filled with remorse.
