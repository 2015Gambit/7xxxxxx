
This one is working, also a couple of others have started that previously wouldn't.
Not exactly sure what went wrong and less sure of what's gone right.
I added trackers and one of them must have given me the green light.
Grab the trackers from this torrent and try adding them to previously non-starters.
Couldn't hurt, but I really have no clue.

This one's special - actual "out of the Scene bubble" native XVID AVI
Brit show encoded by Brits and greatfully passed onto you by myself unchanged
Well, tweaked the filename a bit - gotta keep track.
