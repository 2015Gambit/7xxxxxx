This is the iTunes (No DJ) version of Gucci Mane's NEW mixtape Trap God. The iTunes No DJ version has the bonus Young Jeezy Diss track "Truth". But I took the liberty of adding the 2 tracks that where cut out of the final version of both the free mixtape version & this No DJ version. Which are "Bussin Juugs", & "El Chapo". Both these tracks were meant to be on this street album. But the release was sloppy as hell. I wont get into the details. But there was a website funding the release of this project that would earn you rewards. But let's just say it was SOOO short notice. It didnt work. We're lucky we got anything. Anyway. Don't complain. Its FREE. I used dbpoweramp software to enhance the sound & other beneficial tweeks. Could've uploaded in Flac format. But I think about my downloaders. So mp3 format it is. Download, ENJOY, & SEED!!!!!!!!
