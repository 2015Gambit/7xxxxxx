,KESThai,2012-10-26T10:07Z,I'll wait for a decent V/A. CAM's suck. Not worth the (waste of) bandwidth to download.

,zombeenom,2012-10-28T23:43Z,"I have no problem with watching Cam downloads, cause its never as bad as people think it is. But this, is aweful, MATiNE Ive downloaded several things from you, all of which have been horrible quality even for a Cam, Please clean it up, or stop loading up horrible quality videos."

,lo2_doma,2012-11-17T23:32Z,"I mostly don't have problems with cam videos as I don't need hd to enjoy the film, but this time the quality just SU.KS, I really tried to watch this, cause I waited for this one for some time, but the audio is the worst :/ I don't think anyone should waste their time on this recording... And I don't quite understand why the uploader did.. V: 2, A: 0"
