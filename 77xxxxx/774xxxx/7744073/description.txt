A Pianoless quartet with legendary bassist Ray Brown (Oscar Peterson trio), Brazilian


guitar virtuoso Laurindo Almeida, and west coasters Shelly Manne and Bud Shank 


(reeds, flute)


recorded in 1977 with (12) microphones.  7 were used just for Shelly Manne's


drumset.



I'd give more details but all the notes are in Japanese.


Easy listening but not elevator music...not even close
