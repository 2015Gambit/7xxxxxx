The grand old man of the wildlife documentary brings an unusually personal approach to David Attenborough's Life Stories.
A 20-part run of short talks on the extraordinary variety of creatures, birds and other wonders he has come across during his travels.
Some of these reveal his passion for his work, while others give rare insights into someone who, off-screen, remains a very private individual.
His initial topics include giant birds and massive flowers, as well as an immaculate fossil feather which gave the world of palaeontology its first insight into the evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds.
