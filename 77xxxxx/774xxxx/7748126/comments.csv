I know version 4 is out but sadly it will take a long while before a patch comes out as for version 4 you have to connect to internet to validate the activation code so .... use this almost last version as you can save and edit any projects .

and that's all that matters innit ?

Enjoy one & all , good to be back on TPB btw :)

,Biggles33,2012-10-21T16:41Z,Error on Install. Using Win7 and ICO mounted but when your installer (Fairlight Steam installer.exe) is used I get an error. Presumably it should be installed with AV and Firewall off and disconnected from Internet? Any advice please?
[V],DeGun,2012-10-21T18:14Z,"Biggles33

yuh got the wrong torrent ... fairlight do not bother cracking stuff like artisteer as far as i know :)

while artisteer v4 is out why this version?"
,l33chr,2012-10-23T12:15Z,"Does it support Joomla 2.5.x ?
While the Artisteer v4 is out why this version?"
[V],DeGun,2012-11-02T01:04Z,"this version because it is cracked and working - saving and opening projects - perfectly .

Artisteer version shall not be crack for a long time as you activate it through internet .

already it has always been complicated to crack a working artisteer so ... no chance artisteer 4 can be cracked .

this one works perfectly . and yes joomla 2.5x"
,ghumchor,2012-11-15T05:51Z,"Hey Degun, i got the cracked version of artisteer 4 at joomlate.com/2012/11/finally-artisteer-4-crack-patch-is-here.html , i have checked. Its working and i have checked with virustotal , its clean. Can you please check.."
