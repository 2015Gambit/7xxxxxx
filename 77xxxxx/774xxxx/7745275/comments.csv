Second, anybody knows where is the show itself?"
,kew87,2012-10-20T15:35Z,he is not on this week! must be a fake..
,eeuropean2000,2012-10-20T15:37Z,"Just be patient, mooner.  It'll get here eventually.  Assholes on the Internet post fake rar and zip files.  Don't get caught on those."
,232121452,2012-10-20T15:40Z,Thanks man! Are you going to post the show proper also?
,Ryan_Maiden,2012-10-20T15:45Z,"As has been mentioned, many thanks for this, but does anyone have the actual episode? Us Aussie Real Time fans rely on torrents and P2P ;)"

,stegman,2012-10-20T16:29Z,"Scene groups forgot to do a rip of last night episode. 
It happens every 5-6 weeks, for some reason.
Now they have to wait for a re-run, later today or tomorrow to release it.

I'm sure the latest episode will pop up in the next 24 hours."
,kew87,2012-10-20T16:41Z,"i was wrong it seams, aired yesterday.. sorry guys, maybe i should cut down on the ganja a little bit"

,Petertracy,2012-10-21T20:17Z,"Overtime is highly appreciated! My desktop broke, and the HBO site doesn't work on my phone, so I am in your debt, fellow anon."
,yurune,2012-10-27T16:14Z,"Thanks!  I like your version of Overtime because it plays on my standalone dvd player, but I don't know how I will find you again because you're Anonymous."
