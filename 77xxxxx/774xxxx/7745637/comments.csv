,NCC86,2012-10-21T00:56Z,"These EPs were only ever released on vinyl 45s. Unless you or someone else was stupid enough to do a vinyl rip in 320kbps mp3, what you've done here is just take four mp3s from the remastered set, pair them together, and name them a rare EP. Why would you do this?"
,NCC86,2012-10-21T01:22Z,"I've compared all these ""foreign EPs"" to the 2009 mono remasters and it appears that they are the same thing. None of these EPs are actually vinyl rips of the original vinyl 45s. SMB has taken mp3 files from the 2009 Mono Beatles Box Set and paired them up and labeled them as old 45s. It's shit like this that makes it hard for real Beatles fans to find authentic material on here."
