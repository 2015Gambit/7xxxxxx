Spoonfull is a former skater/ex-boyfriend/current independent hip hop artist from Washington, DC. Spoonfull was exposed to purist hip hop when viewing a Scribble Jam video in 2001. Spurred by his new love of hip hop, old love for punk rock, and an effort to avoid the path he knew he wanted to avoid in the dusty hole of a town known as Beaufort, SC, he found himself surrounded by his own bubble of creativity, writing about the world and the girl as he saw it, an identifier still present in his music today. In 2005, he moved to Washington, DC where he shared the stage with Hanger 18 of Definitive Jux, GLUE, Josh Martinez, and Sleep of Oldominion.

Spoonfull's debut full-length album, ΓÇ£Keep The ChangeΓÇ¥ is released in collaboration with 23 year old D-Mitch (David Mitchell) from Northern Virginia. A former full-time touring punk musician, D-Mitch is currently working on his 2nd graduate degree from George Mason University. ΓÇ£Keep The ChangeΓÇ¥ has a sound rooted in hip hop with a strong indie rock/minimalist folk influence. The approach is raw, sample free, and constructed from the ground up in SpoonΓÇÖs basement studio.
