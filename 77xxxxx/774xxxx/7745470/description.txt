The Kingston Trio is an American folk and pop music group that helped launch
the folk revival of the late 1950s to late 1960s. The group started as a San
Francisco Bay Area nightclub act with an original lineup of Dave Guard, Bob
Shane, and Nick Reynolds. It rose to international popularity, fueled by
unprecedented sales of 33Γàô rpm long-playing record albums (LPs), and helped to
alter the direction of popular music in the U.S.

The Dutch Kingston Trio collection The Original offers 20 of the Kingston
Trio's best-known performances, including "Tom Dooley," "M.T.A.," "Where Have
All the Flowers Gone?" and "This Land is Your Land." With a tracklisting
similar to Capitol's Collector's Series compilation, Story offers an enjoyable,
if simplified, retrospective of the Trio's glory days.
