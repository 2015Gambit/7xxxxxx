,kiwiman40,2012-10-21T05:57Z,"If anyone has this completed, please seed, most of us are missing 20% percent of the game."
,abhi1423,2012-10-21T19:08Z,seed please
,dizzykins,2012-10-21T23:06Z,"This 80% wall is caused by ONE missing file. This one file is 55 MB in size, and is called output_log.txt. It's likely irrelevant to the operation of the game.

Unfortunately, the piece boundaries cut off something like 400 KB of sharedassets0.assets and CS_Prototype_1.bnk for MacOS.

Unfortunately, this is enough to prevent the game from running."
