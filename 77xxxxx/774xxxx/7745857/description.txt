Notes:
Took the russian video; filtered it and adjusted it to get it looking nice. Took the nice LiNE
audio and then muxed + synced it to the video. Before then converting and compressing it down to
x264 using a set of our own custom encode settings. Came out pretty nice if you ask me. Only real
fault with the video is a slight pulse and a very small amount of movement here and there and
that's about it really. As always - Enjoy folks!
Yup, I'm back! :lick:
