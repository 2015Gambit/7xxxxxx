MD5 Checksum Verifier is an easy-to-use utility for identifying changes in a file using the MD5 hash function. Although the program is straightforward, only advanced users are likely to need its functionality.

The program provides a simple tabbed interface that lets you calculate a file's checksum (which is a digit used to check whether errors have occurred in the transmission or storage of data), save the checksums of all files in a specific directory, and verify the checksums of the files against that earlier record. MD5 Checksum Verifier successfully detected changes we made in volatile files--files such as Word documents, which one expects to change over time--as well as the addition and deletion of files into the directory we were monitoring.

If you are unfamiliar with checksums and their use in monitoring the integrity of files, the application will not be of much assistance. In-line messaging is sparse, and the equally terse Help file merely restates without explanation what each tab does.

Description copied from CNET.
I have included a serial and removed the CORE keygen.  It trips just about every anti-virus program with false positive.

I have upped this because I am going to start including md5 files, and it doesn't seem to be on TPB yet.

Enjoy,
