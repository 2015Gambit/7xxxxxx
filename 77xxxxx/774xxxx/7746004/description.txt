This file contains...

- Complete North America rom set. Also includes games that were only released in Europe. I renamed each game to match the official title name and also removed the GoodTools tags. (777 roms)


There are also five sub-folders within the file that contain extra roms...

- English Translations (131 roms): Complete or near complete translations of Japanese/European games.

- Hacks (18 roms): A few of the better rom hacks that have been released.

- Japan (25 roms): Some of the better Japanese only games that never got a NA/EU release. Doesn't include games that already have a translated version in the 'English Translations' folder.

- Prototypes (40 roms): Prototypes & Betas for unreleased games.

- Unlicensed (16 roms): Unlicensed games that were released on cartridge. No rom hacks.
