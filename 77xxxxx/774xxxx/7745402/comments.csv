,nonamerus,2012-10-20T16:50Z,"I think it would be best if piratefrs and Riwerv1 can comment and say they're downloading this , last thing you want is everyone leaching of a torrent they will have no use for"
,piratefrs,2012-10-20T16:51Z,"thanks, I'm downloading it"
,stealth_acronym,2012-10-20T19:41Z,piratefrs The world is your hands! =P
,bkaddy,2012-10-20T20:13Z,Yes i would give the steam cracks a shot but we need more seeds
,rellikpd,2012-10-20T20:40Z,"Who gives a shit what you think Nonamerus... If people are leaching this because they are too ignorant to read where it SAYS it's not cracked... then lulz to them.
also.
6.66 gb... nice."
,Piratechnix,2012-10-20T20:48Z,Holding off on this one till someone has success cracking it .....good luck ...... im wanting this when its ready !!!   =D
,Michaelcr13,2012-10-20T20:53Z,"Progress on the download, piratefrst?"
,kas006,2012-10-20T21:14Z,"Just to let you all know, you need the Real Tone Cable which is only included in the original game. No matter if you crack it you wont be able to play it without the cable."
,kas006,2012-10-20T21:21Z,You'll need the real tone cable to play it which is only included in the original game.
,Michaelcr13,2012-10-20T21:23Z,Anyone who doesn't know that shouldn't be here.
,applepure,2012-10-20T21:40Z,Working on the cable as well don't you worry.
,medalcue,2012-10-20T21:43Z,You dont have to buy the game to get the cable. The cable is available separately also. I dont hold out much hope for a crack with these guys though. I hope im wrong.
,piratefrs,2012-10-20T21:45Z,"@Michaelcr13 coming slow... but already at 50%

@kas006 nothing is secure, everything is hackable/bypassable
that shitty cable can b done for < 10 dollars and yet they sell that shit for 30 bucks....
I'm going to release schematics so anyone can build his own cable."
,medalcue,2012-10-20T21:57Z,Dude just because the cable can be made for $10 dosent mean they're going to sell it for $10. Its a business and its all about profit.
,stealth_acronym,2012-10-20T21:59Z,"@piratefrs when you finish, you'll upload the full game or just the crack?"
,Sadler2,2012-10-20T22:10Z,"@piratefrs cracking binary to use any input device will be more applicable. If it's impossible, as an alternative, writing special virtual audio cable driver for the game."
,Replenish,2012-10-20T22:56Z,"Still lurking: 4:56 PM EST

Good Luck men "
,RMJ113,2012-10-21T05:49Z,"!   D:Rocksmith.rar: CRC failed in RocksmithBaseGRAssetsGR_PropsGR_AmpJCamp.nif. The file is corrupt

screw this , this should have been MULITPUL rar.s not a single rar!

UFB!"
,RMJ113,2012-10-21T05:50Z,that file was 80% of the down load!
,RMJ113,2012-10-21T05:55Z,"I did buy the cable 25$ online, to test the demo, sadly the latency is far from accurate. I had to play before the beat even after turning the latency all the way down, Wish I could use my REAL STUDIO sound cards ""MOTU"""
,RMJ113,2012-10-21T05:58Z,FYI no sence in seeding a corupt file!
,DrgMuka,2012-10-21T06:04Z,"@rmj

Just curious. What kind of sound system do you use? HDMI, Digital In, Stereo speakers?
There are known issues with lag when using hdmi.
I'm using d-in and I only get a slight amount of lag. Not even noticeable while actually focusing on playing."
,ryleinath,2012-10-21T06:17Z,I bought the cable myself and played the demo. The latency was just fine for me.
,RMJ113,2012-10-21T08:17Z,"I use 5.1 analog out to extrenal power amps to studio speakers, I,m a retired recording engineer, I,m very picky about latency. I,m used to highend sound cards with ZERO latency. I use Motu's they cost near $5,000"
,applepure,2012-10-21T11:07Z,"RMJ113 calm down. he could upload that file separately.
and you can still try and crack the game, that amp .sound effect file wont bother you
btw piratefrs, how is it going?"
,Riwerv1,2012-10-21T12:33Z,"Damn, I finished the download and is corrupted :S"
,Riwerv1,2012-10-21T12:57Z,"Download here de missing (corrupted) file:

mediafire.*** /?b2mm9gxobkce225

And put in:
RocksmithBaseGRAssetsGR_PropsGR_AmpJC

(for prevent errors)"
,DrgMuka,2012-10-21T13:15Z,"@cog
I would hope its because they wanted a standard  to work with the game.
They may have did it to potentially not have to deal with incompatibility with some cables.
And you always have the factor that the cable is basically drm."
,Themperror,2012-10-21T13:51Z,"Does everyone have that corrupted file?
Strange.. I apologize, I WAS working on alot of things while rarring the game...

Does everything work with the link from Riwerv1?

"
,sam2k5,2012-10-21T16:30Z,"Themperror

We need exe memory dump in order to crack the exe. you just need to launch the game, then open task manager and right click on Rocksmith.exe and select create dump file. you'll find the Rocksmith.dmp file in windows temp folder.
cut the first 20MB of the dmp file with hjsplit and pm it to sam2k8 over cs.rin forum.
They have a thread for this game over there."
,Themperror,2012-10-21T17:14Z,"I uploaded the memory dump of the exe file to media fire (sent you a link at the forum and the thread)

for the other people who want it:

,Aerionix,2012-10-22T08:03Z,"Confirmed working.  Follow the steps in Themperror's ""crack only"" torrent to install and play.  Thanks and much love."
,bapcanpirate,2012-10-30T20:18Z,"If anyone downloaded this version and Themperror's crack, you can get DLC working by switching the crack with TinyISO's 'crack only' file, so you don't need to redownloaded the whole TinyISO torrent. You still need to create the Content folder under SteamApps/Common/Rocksmith/"
