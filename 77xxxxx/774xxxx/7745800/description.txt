This is a set of files from other source games for Garry's Mod.
Includes Textures, Sounds, Models, Particles and Maps from:
-Half-Life 2
-Half-Life 2 Episode 1
-Half-Life 2 Episode 2
-Counter-Strike Source
-Day of Defeat
-Portal

Extract the main Folder and put all the sub folders in your "Steam/SteamApps/USER_NAME/garrysmod/garrysmod" Folder.

Same as above applies for the BETA versions as well.

There might be missing files, I for one couldn't find any so far, but if there is try requesting them from other people who already own the game or look it up on the a Search Engine such as Google.

Leave a comment below and vote it up if it works :3!
