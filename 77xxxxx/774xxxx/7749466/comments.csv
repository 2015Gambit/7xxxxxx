,michaelrwatson,2012-10-22T02:28Z,"Hmm, no SAMPLE either. No sources listed, no sample, no thanks."
,KwyjiboLinguist,2012-10-22T05:47Z,"It's not really watchable, the audio is pretty bad. I tried playing with the equalizer on VLC and could adjust it some, but not enough to make the movie enjoyable.

I appreciate the effort though!

The SOURCE is right there in the title, it's a CAM. "
,michaelrwatson,2012-10-22T10:21Z,"No, that's not the source unless it's his OWN cam, which it's not. Or is it? Can't tell from that info, which is my point. The source would be whoever's video this guy recompressed.

This is important because there is better audio, and i want to know if this release has it. But it seems not, judging by the other comment above."
