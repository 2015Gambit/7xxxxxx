"Scorched Earth"

Danny and Jackie set out to investigate the 
murder of a bride on her wedding day in a 
drive-by gang shooting. However, they are 
pulled off the case and assigned to the 
protection detail of a Central American 
president, who they believe is a target for 
assassination. Meanwhile, Jamie questions 
his partner Vinny's methods when he 
performs an unjustified stop.
