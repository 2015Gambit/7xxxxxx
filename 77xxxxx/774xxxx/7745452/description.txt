Autodesk Moldflow plastic injection molding simulation software,
part of the Autodesk solution for Digital Prototyping, provides tools
that help manufacturers validate and optimize the design of plastic
parts and injection molds, and study the plastic injection molding
process. Companies worldwide use Autodesk Moldflow Adviser and
Autodesk Moldflow Insight simulation software to help reduce the
need for costly physical prototypes, avoid potential manufacturing
defects, and get innovative products to market faster.
