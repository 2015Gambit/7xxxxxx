A full digital (DDD) recording from 1990.


This album seems frozen in time...it could have been made in the 1960's and


nobody would have thought it futuristic.  It's just plain straight forward bebop


played with lots of emotion.  Nice mix of tunes...track #1 LOVE LETTERS is


worth the download by itself.  This album wasn't in the Accurate Rip database until


this upload.
