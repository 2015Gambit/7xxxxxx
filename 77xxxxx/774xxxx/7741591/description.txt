From the liner notes written by Jody Denburg in August 1992:

This performance took place on April 1, 1980 at Steamboat 1874 in Austin, Texas, and was broadcast live on KLBJ-FM radio.

Running on a shoestring budget with a small allowance of tape and equipment donated by sponsors, the performance was recorded by KLBJ-FM Program Director Wayne Bell and Reelsound Recordings's Malcolm Harper. Bell was able to convince KLJB management to broadcast the performance without commercial interruption. 

Bell and Harper recorded the show on both multi-track and two-track. When no one claimed this incredible performance's multi-track master a few weeks after the show, it was erased and recycled! The two-track reel collected dust for twelve years in Wayne Bell's personal library and is the source or this recording.

This performance led talent scout John Hammond to sign SRV & DT a recording deal with Epic Records.


This was released about two years after Vaughan's death.

Double Trouble: Chris Layton, drums, and Jackie Newhouse, bass guitar. (Newhouse was replaced by bassist Tommy Shannon in January 1981)
