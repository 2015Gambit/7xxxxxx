,kornbred69,2012-11-25T18:51Z,"Definately for a specific fanbase... Sounds like the first ace combat games.

Better yet ""My Chemical Romance"" vs J-rock inside a video game

There are a couple on here that are good
Rise of a Digital Nation
Pieces"
,spyderx810,2012-11-25T19:15Z,Great music! Definitely going to grab it when Amazon gets it in stock!
,Jackdasage,2012-11-25T22:37Z,"This band is a compilation of everything mainstream in rock since 1995...it's like a tribute band to everyone, without any actual tribute. Personally, I find them boring, but there is a fan base for bands like these. If this makes it to public radio in America they will be very famous for about two years and you can tell all your friends how you liked them before they were cool.
