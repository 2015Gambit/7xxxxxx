,IYNTA,2012-10-21T12:24Z,"Don't understand the fetish in every single torrent for people to blurt out how everybody is a little shit because it's free and shouldn't complain about anything, at all, ever. 

I just made something in my pants that's free, just for you. You better not complain you little shit.
"
,Strajow,2012-10-21T12:53Z,"@IYNTA it's like how I don't get why you would even comment on this torrent just to have a cry and carry on?

,Strajow,2012-10-22T02:26Z,"@letenmix instead of admitting that you were wrong, you've decided to abuse me? makes total sense, you're a nobody and me simply replying is just lowering myself. please grow up and just seed :-)"
,letenmix,2012-10-22T03:59Z,"I was never wrong about anything
but that little walnut sized brain of your couldnt process what i was trying to say:
I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF LEGITIMIZING YOU
AND I CONFIRMED THAT YOU ARE
but suddenly you have the wits to call me an idiot for no reason, then telling me to admit that i am wrong? what the fuck am i wrong about? CARE TO EXPLAIN OR ARE THESE WORDS TOO COMPLICATED FOR A LITTLE NOBODY LIKE YOURSELF
trying to promote a guy and he starts calling names, what about that. fuck you, i'll keep seeding for the people, not for you"
,Kooblukhan,2012-10-22T04:24Z,"Whats the best place to get into a fight on the internet?  On a miscategorized torrent you uploaded.  Ur both idiots.

Upscaled dvd.  By Highres - Movies I would rate it:

Thanks for uploading.  Please learn how to upload your torrents to the correct section."
,Kooblukhan,2012-10-22T04:26Z,And jesus.  Don't seed.  Downvote it and nuke it...
,Strajow,2012-10-22T04:44Z,"calm that high heart rate for a second please as you have just went totally overboard.
you came on here saying if it's legit i wont get banned, you didnt even check before threatening to get me banned. Then you tell me to shut the fuck up and be grateful, when Im the one whom uploaded the torrent? Chill dude you were wrong by saying I will get banned without even downloading and confirming the authenticity of the upload, lol at your childish seeding remark. "
,letenmix,2012-10-22T12:47Z,"you still dont understand do you?

@hotnutz ""Wondershare"" and ""Xilisoft Video Converter"" are good ones to use, very simple and you can get them from tpb :-)"
,thereisnoother,2012-10-23T22:42Z,"I usually download from BOZX or YiFy. BOZX has the movies first and highest quality, but large file size. Yify's uploads are much smaller file size, the video quality is not as great and the audio is horrible. I prefer Yifi's downloads because I can usually just turn up the volume a bit and it's fine. Unless it is a top release, then I usually go with BOZX, especially since his come online first usually. 

With this download, the quality was far superior than YiFy's 720P or 1080P rips. Probably because the file size is larger here comparatively speaking. In fact the A/V quality was close to that of BOZX and I was particularly impressed with the high decibel, clear surround sound on all surround channels. The video was also very crisp and clear. The only negative was that at times the video appeared ever so slightly stretched, perhaps due to upscaling. Also, at a couple of points in the movie, the audio was out of sync, but this is a known issue in the movie itself (as posted on the IMDB  page for this move under ""goofs"").

Overall, the quality is superb and I am using a 58"" Panasonic Plasma and a high end Dennon receiver with Klipsh speakers. Could have easily passed for authentic 720P rip. Do not hesitate to download this one if you are waiting to see the move. Good movie too! 

A: 9
V: 7 (due to the somewhat stretched appearance only, clarity is superb)"
,dntcre00,2012-10-24T01:23Z,"holy shit this is an awful torrent.

next time don't upconvert a dvd and try to pass it off as 720p you stupid tosser"
