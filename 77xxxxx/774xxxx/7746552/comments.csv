I am one of the developers of Devil's Attorney. This version of the game is not the latest. There is a more recent version (1.0.1) that fixes a serious bug in the last case of the game.

Please buy Devil's Attorney if you like it, so that we can continue making games.

Here's the link to Google Play:

Enjoy.
