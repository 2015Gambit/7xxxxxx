,JohnJacobs1,2012-10-19T23:18Z,You guys realize that there's only a few spots available for users of this app and pirating it steals money directly from a couple developers? Once they run out it'll pretty much kill the app.
,rttCanada,2012-10-19T23:31Z,Wow this is awesome! I mean I only worked on this app for a year.. but hey why should I make money on it. You should definitely download it for free and screw us over.

,anon99anon,2012-10-20T11:47Z,"( 200,000 tokens * $20 ) / 2 = 2,000,000$/head.

Twitter is screwing everyone... but $20 is too much..."
