RELEASE NOTES

His childish innocence wasnt meant to last long, oh no: When little
Lucius was born on the meaningful date of June 6th, 1966, nobody
expected him to be anything other than a normal little boy. His
childhood, spent in a luxurious manor, was as normal as every kid's
young years - well, except for the extreme wealth of his parents, as
Lucius grew up with everything he desired, including several maids,
the family's own butcher and Lucius private teacher.

Everything changed, though, when Lucius turned 6: His real father, the
Devil, appeared in his dreams the night before his birthday, revealing
that Lucius was his son.

The Beast managed through Lucius to bring a descendant back to the
earth - and so it is Lucius task now to accomplish the missions of the
Evil, which is gaining control over the world. Firstly, Lucius needs
to get rid of all his family members and the service staff in the manor
to be able to make their wealth and powers his.

Equipped with supernatural powers, Lucius starts off to a
blood-flooding tour of horror through his house, using hell's powers of
telekinesis and mind control to orchestrate deadly accidents that will
minimize the population of the manor one by one by one
