Now if only I could get mp4s to stream to the PS3. As it is anything but AVI is useless to me except for watching on my crappy laptop."
,ape2212,2012-10-22T03:00Z,@Llwynog you could always download a converter program to convert mp4 to avi. I use one called Converterlite. 
,GTsVsBTs,2012-10-22T03:17Z,"@Llwynog...  http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/video/filetypes.html says that MP4's are acceptable [in a fairly *specific* format] - assuming that you are in windows - try ""Format Factory"" [http://formatoz.com/] - it's free and has ""profiles"" for PS3 under ""all to mobile device"" - then ""Sony PSP and PS3""...

At least you'd be able to convert it and transfer it over [not as cool as streaming - but i'm sure you have a better screen attached to your PS3 than your laptop - lol] :P

@eztv - a thousand thank-you's for all your uploads!  That would probably work out to 1 thank you for each of your files I've downloaded - lol :D

I was thinking of waiting till this download is complete and commenting - but hey - it's EZTV - it's going to be great :)"

,pecpop,2012-10-22T03:51Z,way too much effort to convert
,NekodaLolita,2012-10-22T05:30Z,You sir make me swoon omfg YAY!! I'm sooo happy that you are so current and upto date
,TonyTheTiger1969,2012-10-22T06:03Z,"@pecpop Then you are one lazy person. It takes about five minutes to convert, and there are dozens of free converters out there. I wonder how you handle things that really take effort?"
