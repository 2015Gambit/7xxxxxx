85 pages! In 2009, cartoonist extraordinaire and Internet sensation Mike Norton (Battlepug, Double Feature: The Answer) took the '24-Hour Comic' challenge and created the pug-tastic comic The Curse over the course of a single day! He returned with sequels spawned during '24-Hour Comic' events in 2010 and 2011. Now all three tales of pirates and pugs are available in print in this new collection!
