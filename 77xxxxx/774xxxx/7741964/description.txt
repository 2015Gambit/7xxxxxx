ΓÇ£National Lampoon Presents The Very Large Book of Comical FunniesΓÇ¥ is an American humor book of comic strips, published in 1975 in paperback, as a spin-off of National Lampoon magazine.  Although it appears to be a book, in reality it was a, "special issue" of the magazine and as such it was sold on newsstands.  On the cover it is described as, "A never before published history of the comics."  It is also described as, "An Adult Comic".  It was not an anthology; it was a collection of original material written by the Lampoon's regular contributors especially for the book.  It was edited by Sean Kelly.
