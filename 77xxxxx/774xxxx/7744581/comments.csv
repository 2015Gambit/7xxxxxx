,AngeloCardesteus,2012-10-20T16:18Z,@koooor You should be able to chose what files you download in your torrent client
,P_Greezy,2012-10-20T16:26Z,"@koooor You can download only the single player disc thru utorrent, just right click the file and press dont download, its easy!"
,ca1981,2012-10-20T17:42Z,"FYI: this is kinda setup like Battlefield 3 is. Disc 1 is multi-player AND high res texture pack. 

DVD 2 is single player. You can play the single player disc without the texture pack, but it will be ugly"
