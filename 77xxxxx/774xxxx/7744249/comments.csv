,XeonWolf,2012-10-22T21:27Z,"Will confirm if its working and safe so, stand by. "
,XeonWolf,2012-10-22T21:34Z,"Confirmed, safe, with perfect download speed and 320kbps  confirmed. im going to seed this for the rest of the year "
,XeonWolf,2012-10-22T21:55Z,"there's only a problem with Somewhere to hide, it has been cut before it ends."
,Elvennomad,2012-10-23T22:47Z,How cut off is it?
,Opake,2012-10-24T01:13Z,"Beware, it's a rip from the AOL streaming. It's actually a 128 kbps re-encoded in 320 kbps. For the real deal, search ""Shiny_Toy_Guns-III-2012-FNT""."
,deadguyinthere,2012-10-24T22:58Z,This is not from an AOL stream. It is converted from 100% flac to 320.
