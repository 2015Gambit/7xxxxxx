,SpibbyMcGoo,2012-11-14T11:46Z,so...why is this labeled as an 1080p HDTV rip when you admit yourself in the description that it's ripped from a dvd?
,nabsltd,2012-11-15T23:01Z,"Only the audio comes from a DVD.  The video is from HDTV.

Since the audio that was on the HDTV was only 2-channel, I subsituted the 5.1 channel from the DVD."
,nabsltd,2012-11-15T23:08Z,"Only the audio comes from the DVD...the video is sourced from 1080i HDTV, de-interlaced and pulldown removed.

The original HDTV audio was 2.0, so I substituted the 5.1 audio from the DVD."
