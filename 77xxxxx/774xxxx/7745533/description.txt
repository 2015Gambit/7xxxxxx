Book Description
Software drives innovation and success in todayΓÇÖs business world. Yet critical software projects consistently come in late, defective, and way over budget. So whatΓÇÖs the problem?

Yes, fake systems are even better than the real thing for most of the design and development lifecycle, and SV is already making a huge impact at some of the worldΓÇÖs biggest companies.
