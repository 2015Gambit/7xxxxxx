,FiberFool,2012-10-19T19:03Z,"Lol @ GhostofMackisGod

Mixing with the peasants are we? Isn't that a bit hypocritical of you?

I kind of like the idea of seeding, leaves my mark somewhere in this big ol'world....

My ""seed"" helped Timmy get that Spiderman movie he so eagerly waited for while using his daddy's porn cap...

My ""seed"" also helped Mrs Robinson get all them young chaps to come and watch a movie at her house (she's a clever one that Mrs Robinson)

So I encourage all seeders to ""seed"" while the ""seed""ing is good. Make the circle bigger I say.

Spread your ""seed"" all over the world.

Precautions: Remember lads. A Seed a Day keeps the Mack away.

Ciao!"

Didn't really see a reason for this Spidey reboot other than to tell the Doc Croc storyline, could've just replaced Toby and continued the story line with SM4, BUT The Stan Lee cameo in this one is hilarious and the movie overall is entertaining and well put together. Thats my review. 7.5 stars"

Oh wow! 30-40mb!! Download time 1 minute! WOWOW!
For your knowledge, most Scandinavian countrys (if someone like you even knows where Scandinavia is) have 100mb and more. 
You got your movie because many people here are NOT selfish morons like you.
Keep your crappy 30mbit, seeding from here with my 100mbit and doing it for at least for some days :)"

,strat158,2012-10-20T18:15Z,"@ fixcash

i was talking about adsl2+ which can deliver upto 20 mega bits per second not mega bytes. if u have a 20 mega bits per second connection u will get 2 megabytes per second and for 100 mega bits per second u get 10 mega bytes per second hence its 5 times faster not 50 i ve got 100 megabits per second fiber optic from virgin uk so i know it for a fact its a ploy used by isp to mention it in meg bits per second."
,asdfkjjj,2012-10-20T21:14Z,"You guys ALL need to read up on bits bytes and the IEC binary prefixes (which is used here on PB), seriously. Not to mention theoretical throughput on ADSL is just that. Do a bandwidth speed check on a server NOT in your back yard during peak hours and see what you get, its all relative right? Screw what your ISP says.

,impulss,2012-10-22T18:00Z,"You people need to learn the difference between MegaBIT(Mb) and MegaBYTE(MB). There are 8 bits in a byte.

ADSL2+ is 24Mb (Megabit) = 24 / 8 = 4MB/S = 4000KB/S

100Mb (which is what I have in Australia) = 12.5MB/s = 12500KB/s

A little bit of computer 101 right there for you. Learn some shit before you start trolling. "
,michaelrwatson,2012-10-23T07:31Z,"@impulss: You almost got it right, but when transferring files over the internet, there's some overhead, with the net result being that about 10 bits (not 8) are transferred for every byte you receive. The ISP companies will try to fool you that way. A little bit of computer 201 for you.

@Everyone about seeding and bandwidth

You should be happy to have such good speeds in your countries. Where I live they only 'sell' 1~10mb connections in most areas, and it COSTS A FORTUNE."

Use VLC player as evrybody else!
it play all formats, and the new versions got so many dif kinda options, not that u need to fuck around with em, just install VLC and play movie,but if u want 2, lets say the Voice comes 1sec b4 the movie, there is a option where u adjust it,so movie and audio is running perfect 2gether,and so on!
