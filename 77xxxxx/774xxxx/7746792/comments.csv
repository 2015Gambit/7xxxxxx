,cur37ious,2012-10-30T00:29Z,Have you access to the UK translations of Stieg Larsson's 'Millenium (Dragon Tattoo) Trilogy' ?  A fried advised me that it's the better of the two translations.
,TxJag,2012-11-05T04:19Z,No I don't. Seeing as I am American and that the UK and US versions are identical to be truthful. Just minor pronounciation and idiom translations. It's just like when they altered the first Harry Potter book to be Sorcerer's Stone instead of Philospher's Stone.
