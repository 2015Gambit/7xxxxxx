Before It's Too Late
--------------------

For now it's time to go
And let nobody know
Just why we have to burn
So we start to 
Run out somewhere
Some place I've never been before
To get out of here
Before it's too late

And come just as they say you are
Beautifully far from here
Into ice 
To live forever
Run out somewhere
Some place I've never been before
To get out of here
Before it's too late


--------
Her Face
--------

He left the one he loved
So she could leave this place
Oh Lord, you know I tried
I closed my eyes to see her face

I can nothing, my love
No I can't see a thing
I don't remember her face
I can see nothing, my love


--------------------
The Snake In My Hair
--------------------

There's a snake living in my hair
Looking for my brain in there
Don't bury under the surface
I don't question, I don't notice


-----------
Getaway Car
-----------

Getaway car
Don't know where you are
You promised to drive me
Far away from here
We gathered in circles
To push out the people
Who's heads were caught on fire
Now we can lie down

On the grass
With the worms who we should ask
Do you feel small?
You don't have that far if you fall

Getaway car
Don't care where you are
Because you promised to drive me
But now I don't need you here
I don't understand
We're lying in quicksand
Need better foundations
Or a pair of rubber wheels


-------------------
This Swallow's Song
-------------------

The first one's full of laughter
The second sings of love
The third can't look right at me
The fourth fits like a glove
Shoot honey from a gun
We'll be the only ones
To make it to the other side
We'll make it to the other side

Catch me before I go
Catch me before I go
I'll sing you a swallow's song
Then catch me before I go

My sister's in a twister
She sees in black and white
She don't know wrong from right
She just wants to join the fight
Shoot honey from a gun
We'll be the only ones
To make it to the other side
We'll make it to the other side

Catch me before I go
Catch me before I go
I'll sing you this swallow's song
Then catch me before I go


-------------------------------
The View From My Bedroom Window
-------------------------------

We will see you when you get there
So breath in your air
There are people in the mud
We're where they're dreaming of
I'll find a way
To break away
I'm out of time
I'm out of time
The sun can't shine
No more
No more


-----------------
Mountain of Foxes
-----------------

Raise your hands off the ground
To build a mountain of foxes
They notice when you're not around
They keep your fears in silver boxes
And lift them to the moon
And lift them to the moon
And you'll be coming home soon
To me
To me
Please
