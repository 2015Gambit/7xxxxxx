Trods en kærlig opvækst hos sin onkel og tante har teenageren Peter Parker aldrig tilgivet sin mor og far, at de forlod ham som lille. Men så finder han en kuffert, der måske rummer nøglen til forældrenes forsvinden. Sporet leder til dr. Curt Connors, hans fars tidligere kollega, der eksperimenterer med genetik. Og da Connors forvandler sig til udyret Lizard, må Peter finde sin indre helt og blive til Spider-Man.

Like most teenagers, Peter is trying to figure out who he is and how he got to be the person he is today. Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy, and together, they struggle with love, commitment, and secrets. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr Curt Connors, his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero.
