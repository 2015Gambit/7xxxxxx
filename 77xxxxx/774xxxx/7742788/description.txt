Out Of The Scientist's Garden
A Story Of Water And Food
by Richard Stirzaker

"This is not a book about gardening. Yet the story of feeding the world
begins in a garden. The first farmers were hunterΓÇôgatherers who started
by growing food around their temporary dwellings. These days few of us
grow food for a living, but most of us have grown food in a garden or
know somebody who does.
Talk about feeding the world invokes numbers that are hard to conceptu-
alise ΓÇô hundreds of millions of people, thousands of tonnes of food and
gigalitres of water. But the garden is a scale we can comprehend, and
throughout this book the garden is the lens through which we will explore
how the world feeds itself."
