,geoweo,2012-10-28T19:17Z,"Thanks for this. It is the first version I've come across that is so easy to set up with NO errors! I simply press setup, it sets up. I then go to play it and it PLAYS! I am in shock, almost. Thank you x a million. "
,barkieb,2012-10-28T23:05Z,"Ok, I have downloaded and successfully set up the game. However, I can't find an icon to start the game. How can I actually start playing?"
,geoweo,2012-10-29T07:03Z,"It automatically put a shortcut on my desktop when I installed it, but it's also under ""All Programs > R.G. Catalyst > The Sims 3 Deluxe Edition"""
,EtherealMoon,2012-11-01T21:41Z,Hopefully somebody can answer this: If I use this installer will I be able to install future expansions?
,-macbook,2012-11-05T15:53Z,does it also work on mac?
,megaman_16,2012-11-21T15:11Z,How do you install Seasons over this? I don't know how to do it since it asks me over and over to install the base game.
