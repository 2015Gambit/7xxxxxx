AudioMulch is an interactive musician's environment for PC . 
It is used for live electronic music performance, composition and sound design.



AudioMulch allows you to make music by patching together a range of sound producing and processing modules. Unlike some patcher-based programming environments, AudioMulch's modules perform high-level musical functions, so you don't have to create things from the ground up using individual oscillators and filters. AudioMulch is designed for live performance and improvisation - you can process live audio sources and control every knob and slider on the user interface using a MIDI controller.



Changes:

Added 16 channel Matrix and Mixer contraptions.
Added right-click for Matrix contraption grid cells allowing Automate, Quick-map and direct access to parameters in the Parameter Control window for each grid cell.
Fixed bug where automation loop was sometimes skipped when the audio driver buffer size was not a multiple of 64 samples.
Fixed input/key meters on Limiter, NoiseGate and Compressor to reflect the input level after InputGain has been applied.
Fixed bug where patch was sometimes scrolled off screen when it was first opened.
Fixed bug in Flanger contraption that caused audio drop outs, extreme CPU load and crashes when using low Frequency Range settings when the audio interface sample rate was set to 96kHz or higher.
Added code to san
