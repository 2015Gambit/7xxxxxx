,nooguy,2012-10-23T06:59Z,"thanks for the movie,great quality... only one small glitch;it dosent play smooth on iphone 3gs (AVplayer (plays other 480p mp4s)/ native video app - no playback, TTPlayer - skipping/jittery )

guess it might be the encode filters.if you can look into it then great otherwise no worries as its only an issue for rips with 704 x 400 res (too small for watching on pc) 

keep up the good work :) "
