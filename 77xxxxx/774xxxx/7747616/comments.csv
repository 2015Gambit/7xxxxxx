Use the following utility to quickly remux to mp4 compliant video. Suitable for those fussy hardware media players. That have trouble playing some non compliant x264 video files.

1) Unzip utiltiy to folder
2) Copy video to folder
3) Drag and drop video file into bat file
4) Wait till remux complete. 
You should now have a file that plays on any stand alone media player."
,thw_cokeaddict,2012-11-18T03:26Z,This is a great show and plays well on VLC but the audio is way out of sync on my western digital media player. You have encoded it in mp4 but the file says (.flv). Why is that. Ive tried to re encode it to either avi or mp4 but my program Auto Gordian Knot doesnt reconise the files.
