On the website I can do a rip of the 5 clips that are no longer than 4 minutes each. And doing that is 4 times harder than ripping TOWIE!! That would be less than half of the actual episode! So, I didn't up it. It should come out soon as MTV will repeat it and someone will cap it. cheers xx
@Zarabol- I cannot upload so many series' at a time! I won't be able to seed it enough to do the popular ones. Sorry :("
,treko200,2012-10-28T23:01Z,Thank you so much Gary! Didn't notice it till now.
