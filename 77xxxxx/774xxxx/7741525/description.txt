How the Other Half Live- Series 2- Episode 01 (GB2012 WEBRIP)
Please Note- This is my own webrip!
It is by no means as good as a PDTV cap, but it is quite watchable!
This show was a request by "treko200"
I managed to get 7 episodes, but will upload the rest once I have seeds on each.
Please help and seed these. It will help me to upload more requests!!
Enjoy :)

The first episode of the second series explores rural poverty and the financial difficulties that people can still find themselves in regardless of education and hard work. It is also about a friendship between two eight-year-old girls from opposite sides of the economic divide.
