Lemons

Marooned in Britain in 23 AD, the Dwarfers need an 8-volt battery to power up their 
Returner Remote and get home. Remembering a lesson from school, Rimmer suggests they 
make a battery out of lemons - but the nearest lemon to Britain in 23 AD is in India, 
4,000 miles away. They begin their journey, a journey that will ultimately lead them 
to a meeting with a historical A List Celebrity that could alter the entire history 
of civilisation.
