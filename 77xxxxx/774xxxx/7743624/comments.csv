We're working off a normal system to snag the e-book downloads at the moment. As soon as we get our shit together and buy some proper Hamsters to run our machines we'll have no restrictions as to our down/up limits.
Thanks for the comment and we'll do our best to make our uploads of e-books more frequent as soon as everything is organised."
