Not fake. Check before you post, thanks!"

Kind of hard to believe this is a 720p Blu-Ray rip.
How do you rip a movie that isn't even out on BR yet?"
,boomkidd,2012-10-21T22:29Z,+1...dvd upscale.
,baba.mulon,2012-10-21T23:40Z,This is a fake. Upscaled rip from a dvd9.
,Oblivilot,2012-10-22T02:08Z,"Fake torrents are different. By your comments alone, we know this isn't ""fake"" because we know you viewed it. It may be an ""upscale"" which means it's not technically highres. But fake torrents are a whole other mess. They typically get uploaded in large volumes, a whole mess of them all in a short time span. Those fake torrents are not viewable. So this description may be misleading, but it's not fake. Those deluges of fake torrents are being posted by ISP's like Comcast, and by employees of the RIAA. 100%. They have virus issues, and there is no actual watchable material. Those users and their fake torrents come and go quickly. Just sayin'... Not to be a picky a$$hole, just, I hate those fake torrent scumbags, which this uploader, is clearly not one of."
,Oblivilot,2012-10-22T02:12Z,"Again, not fake. Learn to distinguish between ""fake"", as in those B.S. torrents that get uploaded in mass quantity, like 20 in 20 minutes, with common descriptions, and usually movies still in theatres. Fake torrents are not viewable in any way, they are virus scams. Fake torrents are being uploaded by ISP's like Comcast, and by employees of the RIAA. This one may be misleading - it's an upscale, not a true 720p, but just by knowing you have viewed the film, means it's not fake. Sorry to be picky, but you all need to hate on the actual fake torrent scumbags. They will rear their festering heads over and over. I saw one recently that tried to upload a ""bluray rip"" of Skyfall. It's not even out in theatres yet!!! Anyway, peace out ya'all. Wait for the BOZX and YIFY versions, which will be along soon enough."

Oh, I understand completely. I didn't doubt it was real... I just doubted that it is an actual Blu-Ray rip. The reason everyone is yelling, ""fake"" is because of the title being misleading and the fact that this is in no way a Blu-Ray copy.
I agree about the torrent spammers. Between them, and the bots posting fake online-movie websites, I can understand why you're raging."
,craddle,2012-10-22T23:00Z,"Not fake.

Just an upscale.

Everyone that said it's fake is just butthurt that it's an upscale."
,saviour_gun,2012-10-23T14:16Z,shut the fuck up! the vid is ok
,dntcre00,2012-10-24T02:29Z,"Yep, I'm super butthurt that he upconverted a DVD and called it a BRRip. If a torrent isn't what it claims to be, it's fake.

This torrent is a fucking fake because it's mislabeled, and in the wrong category. DownSpace and any other fucktard that does this should be banned."

If the title says its BRRip & it is not a BRRip...its FAKE!

If its upscaled, the uploader should say its UPSCALED & not BRRip.

Get over it.
