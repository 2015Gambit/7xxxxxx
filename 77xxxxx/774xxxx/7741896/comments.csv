,tiboka,2012-10-19T13:57Z,Thanks!
,tiboka,2012-10-19T13:59Z,By the way: Does it work on windows 8? 
,lachgar4,2012-10-20T01:51Z,Change the folder name to what?....
,Ryke13,2012-10-20T02:14Z,"I installed it but since i dont know russian i might have made some mistakes because the DLC's aren't working. 

should i install to a new directory like the installer prompted? or should i install to the same game directory?

right now i have 2 games that run fine
one has the 10 dlcs the other (this new one) has none 

win7 x64"
,Ryke13,2012-10-20T02:25Z,"@lachgar4 the folder you downloaded has some weird letters (Cyrillic), just delete them."
,boyznacne,2012-10-20T07:49Z,Will these 16 DLC items work with the Skidrow version updated to v1.6?
,MigRib,2012-10-20T10:51Z,"As far as I can tell this is the full game, there's no need to have a previous version. It works fine, after altering the language to english in the Skidrow config (well, it was fine even without it, I just can't read Russian...)  BUT the DLCs don't work, or at least they aren't mentioned in the dowloadable content option in the menu, I haven't noticed anything in game yet, but I just tried ir briefly. In fact I haven't found yet a way to make the DLCs work either in this version or any other. "
,Ryke13,2012-10-20T15:51Z,"i even tried to install the .dat files from the other DLC i have in my other game and it didn't work either. Even though it did ask me if i wanted to replace the files, so my guess is that the dlcs may be there but they just wont work for some reason. "

,boyznacne,2012-10-21T07:01Z,Can someone please upload the 16 DLC separately from this torrent instead of download a full 6GB?
,Devillord2009,2012-10-22T22:28Z,"Yap,does 16 DLC would be a reall help man,please uploadem so that we that have SKIDROW version or any other could play"
,tiboka,2012-10-25T21:23Z,Does not work on Win8 x64....
,XHaloXX,2012-10-27T08:35Z,"the game only has 10 DLCs, and 3 Free ones (HD Textures, Valve T-Shirts, UFG Community Gift which is a car), 13 in total , so how come you have 16?!?! oO"
,inferno123,2012-10-27T19:59Z,"ya it's not working for me either on Windows 8 64-bit :( tried compatibility mode and Periqjoji's instructions, neither worked."
,Thaimonk,2012-10-28T04:17Z,"I followed all the instruction as stated, however, i received a pop up message ""application failed to start because MSVCR100.dll was not found. Re-stalling application may fix problem""
Any advice, pls"
,Kashim22,2012-10-28T18:33Z,Any chance of running this on W7 x64? Im getting that nasty 0xc0000022 error again.
,TestSmith,2012-10-29T06:44Z,Does anyone know if the Cheathappens trainer works with this game. Because this is the Russian version i assume the trainer wont work.
,TestSmith,2012-10-29T06:45Z,"To Kashim22 
I have it working on win7 x64 no problems."
,Ryke13,2012-10-29T13:17Z,@XHaloXX from this release i also got the Tactical Soldier pack and Street Racer pack. 
,XHaloXX,2012-10-29T16:35Z,"@Ryke13, yah i didnt notice he also included the preorder bonuses as well. "
,antonis87,2012-10-30T07:46Z,"To play it on windows 8, run the game using win 98/me compatibility mode. Its working!"
,Sdsmtms,2012-10-31T15:14Z,"This might sound stupid, but do I have to install steam to use DLCs? because I installed 1.5 over my original 1.4, then this over the 1.5, but I still don't see any dlc in the aside from the just cause one which came with the 1.4 installation... so do I have to install steam, or am I doing something else wrong?"
,Rockey_ssr,2012-11-01T06:19Z,"sorry to say that :( game is 100% working but,
DLC not working. it only appear Just Cause 2 DLC :("
