The Other Side

Nick and Hank are called to the scene
of a murdered high school academic
decathlete and learn just how
competitive some extracurricular
activities can be, and the extremes
some coaches and parents will go to
give students the best chance for
success. In other police matters,
Captain Renard deals with an unwanted
infatuation while we learn an old
accomplice of his has been spending
time with his family in Europe.
Elsewhere, Monroe continues to manage
the spice shop and gets a visit from
an unlikely customer
