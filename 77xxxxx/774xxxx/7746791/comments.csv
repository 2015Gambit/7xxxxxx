but my biggest question is , is how come it takes SOOO long for the WEB-DL versions to come out.... the uncensored versions to come out... im sooo reluctant to download the regular one because watching the first 5 ep's unedited then having to watch one with all the beeps would be sooooo crappy lol any idea when web-dl s06e06 is going to be out?"
