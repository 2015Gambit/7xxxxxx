,captray,2012-10-20T21:19Z,"Thank you, thanks a lot!!! I've been expecting this latest version for quite a long time! THANK YOU!!!"
,thesaguaro,2012-10-20T21:38Z,"This version doesn't seem to be registered -- I installed it and the info screen says it is ""unregistered"" and there isn't a license key file. There aren't torrent-specific install instructions.  Am I missing something? "
,captray,2012-10-21T00:44Z,"It worked nicely - just select ""use new registration"" (or something like that) and insert the data provided in the .TXT."
,medioalmud,2012-10-21T23:23Z,Thank you very much
,krw86,2012-10-22T00:03Z,Didn't work the code is wrong
,Manhole45,2012-10-23T02:44Z,"Kuiper, I have to agree.  I'd go even further to say that on his website, in the manual, EVERYWHERE he types about this $35 .dll file, he is a total dick.  

If you didn't notice, just read his website again.  He talks down to everyone that reads anything he's uploaded.  And for that, it could be $0.01 CONGO cents, and I still wouldn't pay for it.  Fuck him."
