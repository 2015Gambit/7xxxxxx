Nazi Collaborators 
This series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. "How could they have done it?" How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. At the heart of this 13 part series lies one uneasy question. If you had faced what these people had faced, might you have done the same thing - and danced with the devil?


10)  The Dutch Collaborator 
On 10th of May 1940 Germany invaded Holland. Hitler's Blitzkreig or lightening war took neutral Holland completely by surprise. Anton Mussert, leader of the right wing national socialist movement, known as the N.S.B.,offered his support to the occupiers. They would play part in the extermination of 74% of Holland's Jewish population. One such victim was Rudi Oppenheimer.Rudi explains in his own words how he, his elder brother and his sister only just survived Belsen.
