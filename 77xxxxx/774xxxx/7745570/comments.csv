None of these EPs are actually vinyl rips of the original vinyl 45s. SMB has taken mp3 files from the 2009 Mono Beatles Box Set and paired them up and labeled them as old 45s. It's shit like this that makes it hard for real Beatles fans to find authentic material on here."

I never made any claims that these were 'old' vinyl rips - EVER - NO WHERE - NO HOW

Was just trying to recreate memories. Also the 'collections' that have been uploaded are from the same sources as you mentioned. For example, I grew up with the 'Hey Jude' collection and love the track listing in that order, but it is not avail on CD hence the digital recreations

I figured that people who had the old EP's may enjoy the same...so once again, thanks for the feedback, but a simple thank you may be in order....

I am a TRUE Beatles fan...the time and effort I have put into recreating the EP's and collections could be viewed as such....enjoy them for what they are....FREE music for the world to enjoy !!!! FREE GREAT music !!!!
