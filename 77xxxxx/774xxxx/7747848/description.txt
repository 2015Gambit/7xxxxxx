FULL COLLECTION OF HHMI HOLIDAY LECTURES ON SCIENCE

Language: English.
There are no subtitles, but in most cases transcript.pdfs are available.
If you are not sure that it is what you are looking for - download "SCREENSHOTS" folder - it will give you general idea of what to expect.
If you just want to try this - you better start with new lecture sets due to their much better quality. Each lecture is about one hour long.

Enjoy!

P.S. Sorry for grammar in description. I'm not native and English is still a bit of a riddle for me)) I'm doing my best.
