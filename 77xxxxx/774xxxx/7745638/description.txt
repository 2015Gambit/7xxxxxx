Storyline:

Jenna, Renee, Ian and Michael arrive at a lakeside cabin owned by Ian's uncle Wade. Intending to enjoy a carefree weekend, instead, three of them become locked in the hot sauna. First they think its Michael playing jokes on them, but soon realize that help is not coming and they must find a way out before the heat kills them. As the heat rises they are pushed to their physical and psychological limits - staying alive is not easy any more. Breaking a small window - may be the worst thing they can do, because cool air will trick the thermostat to run the heater full blast. They need to get out, but all they can is wait! Wait for what, wait for who?! How long could you wait in the heat up to 250 degree Fahrenheit.
