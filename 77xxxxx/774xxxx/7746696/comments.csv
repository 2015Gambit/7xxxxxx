,GroovyJT,2012-10-21T17:40Z,Thanks...working fine on iMac 10.8.2 / Ableton 8.3.4
,spector63,2012-10-22T16:33Z,I received a registry error.  Will not launch on 10.8.2
,kaffekopp1243,2012-11-05T10:40Z,"Worked fine, but with a strange problem; some effects such as for example rack delay does not work. I hear the knobs affecting the sound, but no delay. same goes for some chorus pedals etc. Any ideas?"
,spector63,2012-11-07T14:47Z,"From what I've been reading, there are some bugs in the program.  MIDI assignable control does not work either.  This is reported to be fixed in version 3.9c.  It would be nice to have an update to verify."
,ZZYZXX,2012-11-19T17:24Z,"works perfectly, thankyou so so much"
,grendelpoots,2012-11-20T09:57Z,None of the chorus effects seem to work (rack or stompbox). Any fix for this?
