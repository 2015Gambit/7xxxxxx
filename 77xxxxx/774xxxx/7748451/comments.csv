The DVD's English subtitles (.sub) were a mess.

The subtitles included in this movie file were created by myself with some laborious editing.

There were some minor errors!!!

I have posted an improved version here :

Is this a joke??"
[V],godcanjudgeme,2012-10-22T20:47Z,"To what file are you referring, Naimtpb?"
,vickypep,2012-10-29T06:45Z,thank you!!
,nada_,2012-10-29T15:22Z,Could you please post the German Subs as well? Thankyou
[V],godcanjudgeme,2012-10-29T17:45Z,"There were no German subs on the dvd.
Germany doesn't 'do' subs, they create an industry for one tiny country and 'do' audio dubs.
Sorry."
,nada_,2012-11-01T17:39Z,"Not sure which DVD you have but the official dvd has ""Untertitel für Gehörlose: Deutsch""

I live in Germany. Some DVDs have german subtitles, some of them don't.  "

[V],godcanjudgeme,2012-11-01T18:38Z,"I always try to include everything in my rips.
The source is the Indigo DVD, R2, DVD9.
The only subtitles are English and Turkish.
No closed caption, no German.
Web search > B008BPR75C
No Deutsch subtitles.
Also it should be noted there was no 5:1 audio as advertised, or I would have included it."
,nada_,2012-11-03T00:46Z,"Thanks for your feedback!

(It seems that Indigo released a ""Special Edition"" that has the german subs)"
