,chucktuna,2012-10-19T16:10Z,"Yeah... I moved out of Detroit in 1989 but still follow the Ti-Cats here and there and this year is going to be the best since 1968 as far as I'm concerned. Yhanks so much for all your time and work in putting these all together.  Now I can watch the games since the weren't televised here in SoCal unless you have ESPN and unfortunately....

Thanks Again!

,gannerhorn,2012-10-19T22:16Z,Is there a way I can just get game 4? 11.88GB is a lot to download just to watch one game.
[V],Nepotu,2012-10-19T23:29Z,"Yes. You can easily select only the 4th game of this torrent from your torrent client (uTorrent, BitComet, Azureus etc.)"
[V],Nepotu,2012-10-19T23:32Z,"...before downloaging, I mean..."
,gannerhorn,2012-10-20T01:52Z,"I tried that, it didn't give me the option. I have uTorrent and I think it stopped giving that option since I upgraded it. *shrug* Oh, well, I only have another 23 hrs til the download ends."
[V],Nepotu,2012-10-20T10:32Z,"You still have that option. Because of the magnetic link it doesn't appear in the first place. You have to wait a little while then select file (above) and select the files you don't want it, then click right and select the ""don't download"" option. That's it!"
