HOFA-Plugins.HOFA.IQ-Analyser.v1.5.2

The analyser with Energy*-Curve shows you specifically what to do. The Energy*-curve finally unveils the frequency points which are ideal for the post-production with an EQ. In conventional analyzers the displayed curve is always characterized by the loudest spot -- the IQ-Analyser shows you the frequency range considering the time   factor: Therefore the appearance of the curve is not determined by the loudest position, but rather by the average, from the beginning to the end of the measurement.
