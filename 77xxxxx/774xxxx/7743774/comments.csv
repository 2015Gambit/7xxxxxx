,lukescoot,2012-10-20T02:50Z,"Agreed. Before I commite to downloading almost 4GB of ebooks, I would like to see a list. This is a very interesting torrent though, and I would like to have it, but a list is needed first. Please keep tweaking this torrent and reposting it, im sure you will get alot of downloads once a list has been added. Thanks."
,zampoukos,2012-10-20T03:06Z,I can send you the list if you send me your email
,QuakeGod,2012-10-20T03:19Z,"zampoukos, there is a free utility called Directory List Print available for download at CNET.  It takes less than a minute to download it, less than a minute to run it, and less than a minute to paste the results here.  There is no need for anyone to give you their e-mail address just so we can have a list of the books contained in this torrent."
,zampoukos,2012-10-20T03:49Z,"I didn't know, i collected the titles from cmd, i just want to make up but i can't post such a huge comment that's all"
,burt007,2012-10-20T09:25Z,And why zip them? What if somebody already has most of them and wants only a few of them?
,burt007,2012-10-20T09:26Z,"@ zampoukos:
C all in one desk reference for dummies, not C++ is included in this list?"
,zampoukos,2012-10-20T10:04Z,"here is the list!

,vivaldi0,2012-11-20T00:46Z,"again, i will comment that these are all from early 2000s.....As programmers know, most of the languages and frameworks have major changes..so these are pointless!"
