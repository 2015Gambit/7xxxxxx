[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-10-24T00:00Z,"Hi mate. I can only do webrips as I don't live in the UK and cannot do a cap of it. Why are the webrips not working for you? Are you unable to download them, unable to play them?? They should work. There are plenty of seeds, so you should be able to download it. And if playing them is a problem, I recommend getting VLC Media player (for Windows or Mac) and that will definitely play it. Cheers :)"

[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-10-24T12:43Z,I'm in Australia too mate! Is it the downloading part or the playing part that is not working for you?
