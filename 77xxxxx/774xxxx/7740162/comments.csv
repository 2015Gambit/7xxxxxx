,TabascoQuesadilla,2012-10-19T02:53Z,"V = 6
A = 10

Sync seems alright, maybe slightly off.  Video's too soft/fuzzy, with fairly heavy compression artifacts.  Certainly not bad, it's just not quite up to your usual DVD rip standards, even in standard-def XviD format.

It'll certainly do until the 720/1080 BR-rips start showing up."

Thank you so much! Long live TPB and Extremezone!"
,snowbirds,2012-10-19T20:11Z,"Thanks E to the Z!!!

Extremezone's releases are always of the best quality available, but that doesn't automatically make them 10/10 because he doesn't always have that kind of quality to work with.

I checked out the sample on my laptop, and for a DVDrip I would say it was good, not excellent.  Dark scenes weren't overly pixilated, but edges were soft and the picture lacked crispness and definition.  On my laptop that isn't such a big deal, but on a big screen it might be.

Usually I wait for great quality and I never DL cams, but I'm going for this one.  It's good enough for me.

V = 8.5 - 9 (for a dvd rip)
A = seems good (didn't test on good speakers)"
