Bopup IM Client SDK version 1.0.1
========================================================================


Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bopup IM Client Software Development Kit (SDK) is a toolkit for Windows 
platform that provides documentation, samples and COM components for 
building powerful instant messaging functionality into existing 
applications, creating and developing a chat messenger software based 
a client/server architecture. Applications built on this SDK interact 
and communicate with Bopup Communication Server (IM server software) 
that must be installed as a server-side part of the instant messaging 
system. 

Bopup IM Client SDK provides functions for connecting and establishing 
IM session with the communication server, sending/receiving personal 
and group instant messages, receiving urgent and high-priority tasks 
from the server, managing user's contacts, receiving presence status 
updates within the Contact List. This SDK supports various 
authentication methods to autorize users on the IM server: Simple, 
Windows Authentication (SSPI) and using Private login and password 
credentials entered by a end-user. 

Provided functionality and supported features:

* Secure and Private Communication
All transmitted messages are encrypted with strong encryption algorithms 
based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and CAST-128 algorithms. That 
is the first and primary way to make corporate and business IM safe and 
secure. 

* Authentication Modes 
Various modes to authenticate and authorize users with the IM server are 
supported. Choose the best way for your corporate and business 
infrastructure from the available authentication modes: Simple, Windows 
Authentication (SSPI) and Private login/password. 

* Messaging Groups 
The centralized management of user groups makes it possible to organize 
a flexible IM structure with a list of assigned groups and send / 
receive-only permissions set for each user. 

* User Presence Status 
See the current status of each user in your Contact List, i.e. Online, 
Away, Offline (Not available). Manage your own status. 

* Contact List access 
Organize your personal Contact List and access it from any workplace and 
location. 

* Offline and Urgent Messaging 
Deliver important information to users even if they are currently 
unavailable and receive such messages. Offline messages are stored on 
the IM server and automatically delivered to the recipient when he goes 
online. 

* Centralized Notification 
Receive notifications and urgent messages from the IM server and stay 
updated on any events and information. These messages are automatically 
sent by the server on the scheduled time and at the specified intervals. 

* Message Logging & Archiving 
Browse, search and view the entire message archives on the IM server. 
Print information for any period and for any person.
