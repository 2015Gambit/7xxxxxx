Elena tries to cope with the extreme highs and lows
that are part of becoming a vampire, and Stefan and

stranger, Connor Jordan, arrives in town and begins
questioning Sheriff Forbes and Mayor Lockwood.
Connor's actions quickly convince Stefan that they
are dealing with a dangerous vampire hunter. Jeremy
and Matt are surprised to see a girl they used to
know, April,, has returned to town and is enrolling
at Mystic Falls High. At a town gathering, Elena
comes close to losing control until Caroline steps
