High quality book and scan. Everything here looks very good, and I believe one of the stories (Ship Of Stone) has not yet been uploaded in any form.

Christin-Bilal may be Europe's most famous and honored graphic-novel team, but their first collaborations have waited until now to be gathered in English. Bilal's detailed, realistic backdrops and rugged figures, colored in quintessentially French earth and fog tones, constitute a graphic vision reminiscent of Daumier, Dore, and even Rembrandt. The three tales here, linked by a common character - a lean, blond man capable of amazing feats - are about small towns threatened by bigness. In The Cruise of Lost Souls (1975), weird military-scientific testing threatens an agricultural village; in Ship of Stone (1976), resort developers want to erase a Breton fishing village; and in The Town That Didn't Exist (1977), a conglomerate plans to scuttle the factory on which the livelihood of little Jedancourt depends. With the help of the supernatural forces the blond can rally, the towns fight back.
