K its not the full version, the forums already got the request for the full thing. What this is a collection of photos and video clips that i could find that were legit. Not a whole lot yet. Hogan's already "threatened" Gawker over posting it. Quite frankly i hate Hulk Hogan. I hate what he stands for, I hate what hes done to pro wrestling and their fans (Especially the CWI rip off jobber they pulled last summer on Eastern Canada) so any chance i got to showcase what a sleezeball he is and how much that i can hate someone, HELL YEAH! Video footage comes from Gawker and few other places online (sorry bout the advertising they chucked into them) These are legit clips and real deal video on the actual video itself, its just not the full version of it and all i could find. Figured save those getting bum results on YT and google cuz of Hogans lackies spamming it out of the search engines. Figured show you whats ACTUALLY available instead of getting pissed off at the dude with the foot on the camera, the parody of it and all the still photos and people "giving reviews" We all know what you're doing lol, the traffic can't be that good lol.
