,raleigh110,2012-10-19T03:59Z,AVG is showing Virus WIN32 Heuer
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-19T12:32Z,"You sir are an idiot. How is video that i ripped from the net infected with a Trojan? HMM???? Considering you are the only one to report this. And my own computers AV hasn't seen that either, so if you'll forgive me, but you are quite frankly full of shit

Hogan find another person who hates you less to convince them to pull their posting for you. I quite frankly hate your guts and am NOT pulling this nor am I bought off which such bullshit."
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-19T12:36Z,"Your AVG sucks, just scanned it with AVG, 0 Spyware, 0 Viruses, 0 Rootkits, so yeah another non contributor bitching bout my torrents. The pink skull actually means something to me."
,SaulTigh,2012-10-20T02:39Z,"Downloaded fine, played fine.  Checked clean with Avira, Superantispyware and Malwarebytes.  Trust in the skull brothers!"
[T],n2kmaster,2012-10-20T06:53Z,"I know eh. See there is a REAL wrestling beef between Hulk Hogan and N2KMaster due to me coming here with CWI's footage and made the largest wrestling fed in Canada look like a bunch of ass clowns and his name was tied to that bullshit(Credit card fraud, false advertising, hotel bills not paid, tickets for Hogan were pocketed and we got Mick Foley sitting in a chair as a replacement) . There will be several wrestling feds, hogan lovers and i even expect Hogan himself to come a-flaming here on this one. There's very few wrestling feds that have the balls to actually let me be the manager or character i wanna be, mainly cuz, screw you I'm telling them EVERYTHING about cha, cuz half the problem in the indys and in WWE and TNA right now are because of them all trying to be this guy, the self proclaimed ""standard"" of a character that makes money in pro wrestling today. Kinda nice to see him knocked off that horse ""brother""....."
[T],bill_214,2012-10-24T23:24Z,"LOL... like ALL pro wrestling isn't bullshit anyway. 

So there's no way Hogan could fuck it up...  

...in keeping with that indisputable truth if you wanted to post it, it's cool with me. But don't be suffering under the illusion that any pro wrestling is anything other than made up entertainment."
,crimson85067,2012-10-26T02:16Z,"yeah right we should respect women lol, fucking tramp"
[T],n2kmaster,2012-11-02T00:48Z,"K first off fellas, I've worked for NWA, and other fairly well known companies. Heres what i know about wrestling, Hogans a piece of crap. Everything i claimed that hogan pulled while here in eastern canada and the CWI president quitting, i can back this up with video proof and THEY HATE ME FOR IT! I've worked posters, animations, video remakes, and my understand of the true essence that is a wrestler. They are sleazy, manipulative, liars, and none of them can pay the bills. Heres how Hogan kinda is to blame for it all. Ever watch wrestling before he showed up......Watch it after... This is the reason why pro wrestling is now a soap opera and not even coming close to being listed as a sport anymore. Now I don't believe Hogans the only evil out there. But there are to many kids growing up, beating the shit out of each other in the backyards to become what....Hulk Hogan...meaning he somehow became the standard of what to be in the industry, even when his press states otherwise, even when your marriage has bankrupted you so bad you gotta steal from people who havent had a descent wrestling show for a LONG ass time live, and that goes for WWE/WWF shows here. Last time Saint John,NB got WWE/WWF was back in like 1995 and we had 20 minutes of Bob Backlund running thru the audience despite a total lack of the referees count, next time any these fellas were seen around here was CWI, we didnt get who they advertise (HELL they were advertising NASH WHILE HE WAS WORKING WWE AND IT TOOK THEM A WEEK TO ADDRESS IT!) Even the people on the wall of their facebooks were warning it was a dime and dash here in eastern canada. And we get high quality matches where Street fights are called on a count out DQ....IF you are ANY sort of a wrestling fan, aspiring to be a wrestler, thinking they are gonna open a promotion on the gate income....STOP! Pay your bills first, get a 2nd talent that will pay, pro wrestling doesn't pay wanna know why, they want Hogans, doesnt matter if they have talent or not or bring even more to the ring than the wrestlers themselves. Time for everyone to stop eating the bullshit your being. Hogans 100% pure evil. YA HEAR ME HOGAN AND HOGAN LOVERS AND HOGAN SCHMENGIES...Right to the core, and hes dragged the industry down with him. I've been backstage, and seen that backstage. Lotta hungry people not getting paid so people like this fella can pay for his divorce by ruining the industry further LONG after he shouldve retired and left period"
