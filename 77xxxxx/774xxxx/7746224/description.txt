Find open, ad-hoc and even rogue access points. WiFi Explorer detects 802.11a/b/g/n wireless networks and supports 2.4 and 5 GHz channel bands, as well as 20 and 40 MHz channels.

Get an insight into the network details: name (SSID), MAC address (BSSID), device manufacturer, signal strength (RSSI), noise, channel, band, security configuration, supported data rates and much more.

Monitor signal strength of each network over time and export metrics (average, maximum signal strength, etc.) and network details to CSV file format.

- Fixed a problem where after changing the SSID of a network, an old entry would persist resulting in two networks with the same BSSID but different SSID.
- Fixed multiple stability issues introduced in recent versions of the app.
