Subject: Best Sugaree, Peggy-O, Fire....
After comparing over the past 4 months, and with 36 years following the band, I must say the Sugaree, Peggy-O, and FOTM from this concert are my personal faves. The unique rendition of Terrapin is in the top five as well.

Somehow, the band was just in perfect form for this show, delivering with the powerful gentility that makes the Grateful Dead so unique among all bands. Phil's performance the entire night, but especially on Fire and Sugaree is simply extraordinary. Why was Phil so focused and more active than usual that night? We will likely never know, but his usual playing "lead" bass about 50% of the time was around 90% of the time on Mar 18th, 1977.

Personally, I think that Phil's outstanding work during this show was the catalyst that got the whole band "hitting at 120%", and added that little extra something that makes the songs from this show so highly rated by so many.

No Dead collection can be complete without this show!
