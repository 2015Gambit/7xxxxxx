we don't bullying you :)
just you try figure out what's wrong and put that torrent again up, and tell us also, works that game with osx 10.7 or 10.8"
,jashos,2012-10-21T05:23Z,BTW (only for people using the AppStore): this game costs currently like 8 bucks (limited time)
,taduxas7,2012-10-21T05:24Z,yeah i think hes trying to upload a shortcut to his aplication folder or something... try again dude.
,chrede2750,2012-10-21T14:46Z,"what I think he has done is

He bought the game on the app store
and then he uploaded the app store install for gta sa .. so when you install it here then install it via the app store ... and I will not. I will install it as all the other games I've ... just transfer them to my game folder and then the installret instead of everything else ..
try to upload the install file instead of appstore install
sorry for all the comments. but it is not okay this file!"
