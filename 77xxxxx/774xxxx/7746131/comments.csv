... and here come again the neo-nazis with their packs of lies.... The Leuchter report has been long exposed for what is is: fabrications by a inept and false 'expert', Rudolf, expelled from the Planck institute and his pseudo-scientific report shown for what it is: inept and biased 'science', almost nobody normal believes their lies but in a pathetic hope to convince the gullible and ignorant, they upload this crap again and again... Poor losers, make a click on my nickname and read THE TRUTH I have uploaded about holocaust deniers and assorted juedophobic rats.

,indoeuro,2012-10-21T03:19Z,With respect to the above comment: only those incapable of rational rebuttal turn to character assassination. Read these books and make up your own mind. The truth does not fear investigation.

The nazis by bringing about WW2 caused the death of 50 million people. Those who try to praise them and deny their guilt are willing accomplices in that foul body count. There is no more anonimity in the internet anymore, neo-nazis like this can be tracked and identified so they can one day answer for their deliberate lies and twisting of history, crapping on the graves of so many innocent people massacred by the nazis.

Their will always be people who refuse proven historical accounts with fanciful accounts to make someone look better or even innocent in historical context. The reasons can be as varied as family members directly involved in historical events, a form of juvenile hero worship of historical figures, or an author wanting to make a quick buck selling revisionist history to a niche market.The tales these people spin, wile based on historical events, are not worth the time to read or research.

This collection falls under this category. With very little research, a person can reach this same conclusion. 

I am all for a person researching a subject and making an educated decision. Download this collection, if you must, then you too will be able to clearly see revisionist history at it's finest and then realize what a waste of time you have spent reading it."
,indoeuro,2012-10-22T05:10Z,"The above comment claims that these books are full of lies, but is very quiet about just what these lies are, and how he knows they are lies.  He claims to have read most of these books, and as seven of the books in this torrent are by Carlo Mattogno, he ought to have read at least one of them. I challenge the above commentator to substantiate his allegations and provide proof that any one of Mattogno's books in this torrent is full of falsehoods.

If he is unable to do that, he must stand convicted as a liar himself."
,notuboo,2012-10-23T01:50Z,"Just wiki Carlo Mattogno or use any popular search engine. Any question of the authenticity of his published works will be answered in seconds from reputable sites. A person should know the real meaning of ""revisionist history"" within the context of the description of this author.

I appreciate the feedback from your posting. "
,indoeuro,2012-10-23T04:08Z,"Answered in seconds!  I guess I was wrong to have spend a great deal of time reading dozens of books on both sides of the debate.  I should have just consulted the infallible wikipedia and a few other lightweight websites turned up by google.  Congratulations on your exhaustive research - you are truly a scholar!

However, you claimed that YOU had read these books.  Therefore you should be able to identify the (alleged) flaws in Mattogno's writings on Auschwitz yourself, not weakly fob the job off on unspecified others."
