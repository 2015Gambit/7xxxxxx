Storyline:


Daniel Miller was tooling along a Los Angeles street, listening to Something's Coming when something came - a bus. One head-on crash later, Daniel wakes up deceased. And his troubles are just beginning.

Double Academy Award┬« winner Meryl Streep joins writer/director/star Albert Brooks (The Muse, Lost in America, Mother) for a witty peek at the afterlife, where you can eat all you want and not gain an ounce. But there's a catch: you're saddled with Defending Your Life. If you can't make a case for having lived a full and fearless one, you must go back to Earth and try again. Daniel's life was far from fearless. But after he meets the remarkable Julia (Streep), he's determined not to go back. Yes, there is a laugh after death!
