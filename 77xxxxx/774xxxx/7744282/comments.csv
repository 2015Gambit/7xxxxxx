[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-21T01:37Z,"Hey gonadzz, thanks for checking out my uploads.

As I've stated previously, I have no political motivations when posting material of this sort (and I've posted stuff that leans heavily to both sides). Nor do I have any religious motivations when I post a string of books relating to Christianity. The impetus for my uploads is that they are NOT ""any Marvel or DC"" title. All of my uploads are purposely off the beaten track (unless it's a request that I've filled). It's cool if people dig 'em, and it's cool if people think they're a crock of shit. But the intention is never to start a political debate. TPB comic book section probably isn't the best place for that, really. Peace."

Thanks for posting this!"
