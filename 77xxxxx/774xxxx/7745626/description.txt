Rippers Note
------------
The quality of this encode is bad compared to other Dvd release only because the DvD release by T-Series is one sucky wan. So I would recommend to download the sample first and then only download the entire 900MB movie file. Also there is no news on the release of Blu Ray for this movie. Take care and have a nice day ahead.
