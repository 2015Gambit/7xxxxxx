Just don't download anything with ""720p AVCHD-SC-SDH"" at the end, and you'll be fine.  These rips tend to be really bad for some reason."
[T],SCSA420,2012-10-21T20:55Z,"@ranker38 says Audio out of sync.  

SCSA420 says NOT here it isn't!!! Plays perfectly  on my 2 BluRay players, Playstation 3, Xbox360, 3 different PC's, Samsung Galaxy SIII smartphone, and a 55 inch LG 3D LED Smart Tv

Just don't pay attention to losers like ranker38 who have NEVER uploaded anything here.

Any torrents downloaded with 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH at the end are always good 720p HD video files and play fine. I TEST all my video files BEFORE I upload them for compatability with plenty of devices named above and IF you cant get the file to play right that is your problem not mine. MY suggestion to all you people who think you can do better then I do then do it otherwise STFU"
