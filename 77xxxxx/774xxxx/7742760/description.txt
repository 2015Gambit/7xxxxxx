Trader Johann comes to Berk, bringing with him new and exotic goods that the
people of Berk hurry to trade for. But soon, the dragons begin sneezing and
getting sick. Hiccup, with the help of the others, determines that the
dragons have been poisoned from eating the Blue Oleander flowers that
have been growing throughout the village. The only cure: the venom
of the Scauldron, a massive and vicious sea dragon.
