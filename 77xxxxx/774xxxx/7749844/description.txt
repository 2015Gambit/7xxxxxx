NOVA.Pocahontas.Revealed.2007.DVDRip.XviD-FiCO 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1023725/
Subtitles: None
Date: 2012.10

Director: Kirk Wolfinger, Lisa Wolfinger
Genre: Docu
Plot: On May 13, 1607, three English sailing vessels dropped anchor beside a 
small island fringed by swamps in the James River, Virginia. On board: 104 
colonists who will establish the first successful English settlement in the 
New World at Jamestown. The exploits of the brash, swashbuckling John Smith; 
the wily, venerable chief Powhatan; and his infatuated daughter Pocahontas 
will be recited, retold, and embroidered until they gather the status of an 
epic founding myth of the new nation. Now, on the 400th anniversary of 
Jamestown, science is revealing the truth behind the myth. Virginia 
archaeologists have recently discovered the site of Chief Powhatans 
capital, Werowocomoco, some 17 miles from Jamestown beside the York River. 
This is the very spot where the captive John Smith had his famous 
life-and-death encounter with the mighty chief, in which (so the story goes) 
the smitten Pocahontas begged her father to spare the Englishman. The unique 
investigation of the site will be followed in depth exclusively by NOVA as 
archeologists for the first time reveal the Native American side of the 
Jamestown story.
