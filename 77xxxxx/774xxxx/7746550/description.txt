What? was a hard rock band formed in 2003 by friends Chris Sakiadis, Andy Cohick,and Andy Palski. Then eventually picking up a bass player named Larry Eisenhower. They were notorious for their outlandish stage presence of just rocking out non stop, with the occasional smashing of a guitar or diving into an amp. They definitely knew how to play a show and pave the path for many other local bands and musicians in the central P.A. area. Playing their last show at the Antes Fort Battle of the Bands, for only $4.00. They left the music scene and a legacy.
