,cawoodie,2012-10-20T16:18Z,"Your UL posting claims it was posted 10/20/2012. When in fact it was posted yesterday, 10/19/2012. Have been at it for over 14 hours now and still at 13.2%. DL speed Fluctuates 63kB/s to 450kB/s. Truly appreciate your UL, but at this rate it will take days to DL. PLEASE, please, please seed : ) Thank you so much for the UL "
,cawoodie,2012-10-20T22:29Z,"Moving right along........nearly 24 hours later, I'm at 59.4% with this DL. I see the 162 leekers, non of which left any comments. This may be a real s#!t torrent. WAIT!!! and see."
,cybertanger,2012-10-20T23:57Z,OK this is a new Torrent I am actually the only seeder. I see right now 157 Leechers. After doing some maths I expect your download will finish in 15 hours from now. So start your download and forget it. Pay no attention to speed. Everyone will soon get his copy. I expect also some increase in speed tomorrow morning when there will be more than one Seeder.
