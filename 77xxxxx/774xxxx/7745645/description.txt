Ten no-nonsense, total-body workouts designed to completely reshape your body in 90 days. It's all based on "muscle confusion" -- a technique that constantly challenges your muscles with varying sequences of different exercises. All the workouts include carefully planned "work" and "rest" circuits (without specific rep counts -- you'll just do as much as you can in the time allotted). The exercises blend proven weight-room classics with newer "functional fitness" routines. The toning ranges from classic squats and bicep curls to multi-muscle training and and kettlebell-style moves. The aerobic intervals are short but intense (e.g. "jump split lunges" and "high knee jogs"). Tom Holland makes the most of his equipment -- he matches the dumbbell weight to the exercise and often uses the stability ball as a weight bench to improve range of motion. Requires a stability ball and two sets of dumbbells (e.g. 5 lb. and 10 lb.). Includes a nutrition booklet and "90 day success chart." Γö¼ΓîÉ2010. DVD has: Music only option
