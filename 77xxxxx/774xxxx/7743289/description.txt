TRAKTOR is the pro platform that top DJs trust, and TRAKTOR PRO 2.5 is the most 
advanced version of TRAKTOR ever. Perform your mix on up to four decks, 
featuring TruWave colored waveforms, powerful looping and cueing functionality 
and an exceptional effects suite, and create mixtapes with a single click.

TRAKTOR PRO 2.5 is Ready to Remix. Get started in seconds, fire up the Remix 
Decks and seamlessly merge the worlds of DJing and live performance.



  A NEW WAY TO PERFORM

   The stylish multi-color pads and ergonomic faders make TRAKTOR KONTROL F1 the 
ultimate controller for a Remix Deck. Any sound or loop can be assigned a 
specific RGB color, either in the software or via the controller
   A Remix SetΓäó is the combination of 64 loops and one-shot samples and their 
respective beat grids and BPMs - stored and loaded just like a regular track in 
the browser
   Control the entire Remix Deck via Native Scratch timecode control with vinyl 
or CDs - or scratch using the TRAKTOR KONTROL S4/S2 jog wheels. Each Remix Deck 
has its own transport, sync, and tempo master controls



  DEEP CONTROL

   To add more flavor, you can choose which slots are fed through TRAKTORΓÇÖs FX 
units, or even play samples in reverse
   The Punch mode allows for instant switching between different loops in one 
instrument group, in perfect phase - switch from one drum loop to the next 
exactly on the 2 and 4 snares
   Additionally, the Remix Deck quantize can be set to different values for full 
control of the musical phrasing



  IMPROVED BPM DETECTION

   Rewritten tempo detection for improved accuracy, developed from analysing 
thousands of tracks from various genres
   New ΓÇ£downbeatΓÇ¥ auto-detection improves auto-beat-gridding and phase 
recognition
   Convenient analysis options when importing files to your collection - set the 
tempo range by BPM
   Much improved BPM detection on tracks with variable tempo, (such as ΓÇ£liveΓÇ¥ 
drummer genres) - now detects average BPM
   Rewritten Tempo-Tap ΓÇô instant and simple realignment anytime your tracks 
drifts away from the grid over time
   Manually adjusted grids, (and all BPM-locked tracks) keep their position and 
tempo from previous versions



  NEW BROWSER FEATURES

   All contents and settings of a Remix Deck can be saved and reloaded as ΓÇ£Remix 
SetsΓÇ¥, managed in the Browser as a single entry
   Sounds and loops are contained in the Remix SetsΓÇÖ .trak format for super-
convenient file handling across computers
   The state of browser tree is recalled from previous session when starting 
TRAKTOR
   Importing another collection now preserves favorites


  ADDITIONAL FEATURES

   Now features Jogweel and Joglight advanced HID integration for Pioneer CDJ-
2000, CDJ-900 and CDJ-400
   S4/S2 Sample Deck slot functionality is now mapped to Remix Deck 
functionality
   The S4 channel filter curves have been shaped for smoother transitions around 
the neutral position
