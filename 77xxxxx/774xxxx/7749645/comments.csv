[M],Lollash,2012-10-24T14:09Z,"Since its just one picture, why dont you upload it to an image site instead? Such as http://bayimg.com/"
,5-click,2012-10-24T18:54Z,"@Lollash: Yes, it's a single picture. And now the Question: How should my friends find the picture on bayimg? Suggestion? For your Information: This is a hand made picture from series of  hand made pictures. If you click my name, you will see it. It's numbered. 
Btw: You uploaded many single files, like http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5410633/How.Its.Made.S14E07.PDTV.XVID-CR 
Why don't you upload this to a One Click Hoster?"
