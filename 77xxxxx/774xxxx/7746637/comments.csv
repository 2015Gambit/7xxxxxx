Lots of fascinating reading and useful info. None of these techniques are ""old"" or ""out o style"". they are in pdf format except for about 3 videos. A very extensive library on classic boxing and wrestling combat."

Sorry the initial seeding was trashed by the fact my compter crashed and didn't come back. I have re-posted the torrent with the individual pdf files (no rar) and you can find it at

I also re-seeded this one. Hope it is working.
