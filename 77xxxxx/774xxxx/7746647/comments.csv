,valizio007,2012-10-21T02:26Z,"Upscaled from DVD.

After you download it. You will understand that you have downloaded utter crap. Wait 3-4 days for the real one to come.

Real Screens Unlike shitty screens provided by the uploader

,Oblivilot,2012-10-21T02:44Z,"The comments on this torrent over at PublicHD indicated that it's up-sampled, and not true 720p. It looks like this one has been deleted from PHD also.. Just sayin'
"
,QborT,2012-10-21T03:04Z,"It's not a fake, it's just a shitty encode.  "
,stangerbr,2012-10-21T03:56Z,ill wait for dibya version
[T],xxbel,2012-10-21T05:05Z,d/l at your own risk
,xidio,2012-10-21T06:15Z,xxbel or you remove the stupid torrent as its full of shit.
,merdivino,2012-10-21T06:27Z,"actualy.. i download and tested this release 5 hours ago... this release was deleted from PublicHD. because its not real Bluray Rip, its a UPSCALING !"
,merdivino,2012-10-21T06:29Z,"BAD UPSCALING by the way... lags, and free video, and audio is out-of-sinc... SHIT RELEASE! "
,Oblivilot,2012-10-21T07:08Z,"You know what?? THANKS!!! For one thing, it's NOT FAKE, like those fucking fake torrent uploaders who work for the RIAA and Comcast. Second, it's FREE!! And third, if ya don't like it, wait for the YIFY version, or the BOZX version, which in all likeliness will be along soon enough... Oh yeah, one more thing.... LOVE, Love , LOVE Emma Stone"
[T],xxbel,2012-10-21T08:19Z,"LOL... Screens provided. D/L or not its your choice. I'm sorry for Dysmetria patient like xidio though, Dysmetria is a disease that you can't control your body movement, hence I guess xidio has it, and he has to download this again and again until its remove. sorry xidio, hope you have good bandwidth"
[T],ztorrenter,2012-10-21T11:02Z,"Audio has a delay of 1 ms, you can fix this by using the mkvmerge Gui,
select the audio, click on Format specific options, Delay (in ms), and write: +1
Video also cuts few times.
Bluray releases not out yet,  this is a dvd encoding."

,boomkidd,2012-10-21T13:15Z,"Thank you!  I HATE when ppl just have to be first.  If its not true HD, then WAIT uploaders!!!  Try to be the REAL first HD uploader.  This is just annoying and ppl clicking ""hi res movies"" expect just that.  DVD IS NOT HIGH DEFINITION!!!  Doesn't matter if U upscale the GD file!  Its source is far less superior in quality.  Catagorize this in the correct section!!"
,bladedracula,2012-10-21T16:12Z,cheers
,ungraph,2012-10-21T19:02Z,Don't bother downloading. It's just a terrible upscale of the DVDrip with the audio out of sync. Shame on you xxbel. You piece of shit uploader.

,JuicyFruitSweeT,2012-10-21T20:47Z,Will wait for 1080p :)
,Adam_OSFP,2012-10-21T21:44Z,"I guess anybody can upscale a (not so perfect) DVDRip and share it. But why would someone be such a LYING ASSHOLE and label it as BluRay, is beyond me. "
,KanW,2012-10-21T22:21Z,This is not a 720p! HD is 1280x720. Actually I have no idea where 1280x530 comes from. 
,war59312,2012-10-21T23:41Z,"Indeed what a crappy release.

And 7200 people are grabbing it and 1500+ seeds.

Sad!"
,atr0,2012-10-22T01:13Z,"@KanW I agree this is not bluray, however - a movie in 2.40:1 widescreen will not be 1280x720, it will be around 1280x530. 1.78:1 or 16:9 is 1280x720."
,xidio,2012-10-22T01:36Z,"xxbel I didnt even download it. Why would I?

Secondly, why name it Bluray when its DVD quality, out of sync etc. If YOU know of this, WHY name it Bluray? Idiot."
,Kooblukhan,2012-10-22T04:31Z,"Nuke it, downvote.

As the poster says, coming soon.  Wait for actual Highres.

,Shukuri28,2012-10-22T11:48Z,"Upscaled DVD. Looks about as good as an uncompressed DVDrip at fullscreen. Around 1h 4min into the movie the sound goes out of sync. I found a fix in VLC;

Tools > Track Synchronization > Audio Track Synchronization > set value to '0.300 s'

You're welcome. Enjoy. ;)"

,kri1st,2012-10-22T20:45Z,"Fake shit!!!
Not a bluray."

FAKE FAKE FAKE

Quality is pure SHIT!!!!"
,Jackholed,2012-10-23T00:17Z,"I understand the whole ""It's free, shup up, stop complaining."" Yes, I get it, that makes sense. But why do people continuously mislabel things. This is clearly not 720p nor is it Blu-Ray quality. So why label it as such? Why can't the title be: The Amazing Spider Man 2012 1280x530 MKV x264 SceneHD. That title tells me everything I need to know, misleading people is just stupid and it takes up space."
,phase700b,2012-10-23T04:27Z,Skulls should be taken away for this kind of crap.
,KanW,2012-10-23T13:20Z,@atr0 Thanks for the info about 1280x530. But can it be called 720p?
,phase700b,2012-10-23T13:58Z,Yes. 720 video is 1280x720. In the case of a 4:3 aspect ratio you might see 960x720. If either the height (720) or the width (1280) are correct it's 720 resolution video. Same for 1080 video (1920x1080) The black bars you see in 2.35:1 aspect ratio movies are rarely included in the encode around here to save space. That's why the heights can be different.
,abhipuma,2012-10-24T04:58Z,fcking sad quality sad uploader dont even name this  as bluray its pure DVD  
,obvious2me,2012-10-24T09:15Z,"@phase700b How do games like MW2 and Black Ops get away with their ""HD 720p"" label? I'm just wondering, because neither height nor width is 'correct' in either game. 

Different standards perhaps?"
,topk,2012-10-24T20:49Z,"stretched DVD
fuck xxbel"
,topk,2012-10-24T20:50Z,"misleading asshole title
this is upstretched DVD
remove this misleading shit"
,gjones88,2012-10-25T03:20Z,Bad uploader is bad.
,Shukuri28,2012-10-25T06:22Z,"I don't think ppl understand what Scene uploaders are all about.They just want to be the first uploader of a file regardless of quality. Just to get their name out first.

The majority of scene releasers should never be granted a skull on TPB IMHO."
,billy_the_poop,2012-10-25T16:19Z,"This is a complete TURD!

The quality is pathetic. I'm pretty sure it was uploaded by some MPAA contractor to flood TPB with shit to discourage people from downloading.

You can get the real deal from our reliable friend BOZX:

,Forgoth,2012-10-25T22:19Z,"Fake,terrible quality"
,FireIsHot,2012-10-26T08:21Z,"@xxbel - why do you keep this torrent, with a misleading title up? Your a Pink Skull, and I've seen some of your other stuff, I know you're better than this man.

I guess if people don't take the time to read the comments, it's their problem, but still....

@billy, you sir are out of line and your accusations make no sense, and your comments make you sound like a troll, but you are right about downloading from BOZX.
