And hes all over torrent sites.. someone like him should not discourage other hd uploaders that want to include either ac3 or dts. Unbelievable.. anyways I prefer your stuff and I will always give you a +1 for rep. Thank brother. :)"
,chronaden,2012-10-20T15:03Z,"@ lif3isfr33:

Eh, please read up on the facts before you criticize, there only exist one original audio track for this movie WHICH IS FROM 1968, and that is Mono, also known as 1.0

Did you really think movies was made with surround sound back then?.."
,Lebada3,2012-10-20T17:52Z,"^ IFI torrents are still retarded. Every time i search 1080p IFI pops up. I just want to smack him in the face. He should remove ""1080p"" from his shitty torrents. I guess the newbies who watch them on laptops and small screens, dig his shit. 

DownTY please upload more bluray isos. 30-40GB or bust. "
,squash34,2012-10-22T23:42Z,"Please listen closely to lif3isfr33's comments.

He is absolutely 100% right.

YIFY's torrents are pure trash and only top seeded because stupid people who know nothing about video or audio quality download them because they have small file sizes.

They have small file sizes for a reason."
