This book seems incredible simple when you fist look at the pages, but start reading it and you'll soon find yourself unable to stop. The 400 plus pages move by at a quick clip (admittedly, because there isn't much to them, but it's a good read all the same).


'The 120 Days Of Simon'

Top Shelf Productions, 2010, 416 pages 

Written and Illustrated by Simon Gardenfors


The 120 Days of Simon began in the spring of 2006, when Swedish cartoonist/rapper Simon Gardenfors left his home to spend four months on the road. The rules were simple: During the 120 days he wasn't allowed to return to his home, or to spend more than two nights at the same place. The result was a wild trip through Sweden as Simon slept on strangers' couches, ate mescaline, practiced free love, received a death threat, was beaten up, got adopted by a motorcycle gang, drank obscene amounts of alcohol, and sacrificed his underpants to the Nordic god Brage. And that's just for starters!
