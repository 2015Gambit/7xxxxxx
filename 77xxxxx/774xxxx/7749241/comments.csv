,Th3Myth,2012-10-26T06:17Z,I can confirm that this is working as stated... I did happen to do one thing different and that was once I got the sig.bin file I changed it to start8sig2267.bin and then restarted my computer... Thanx
,Ny9e,2012-10-26T18:14Z,Thank you so much uploader it worked 100% For me. I followed the instruction and got sig.bin file. I renamed it to start8sig2267.bin  and pasted in registeration folder and all done. Yuppppyyyyyyy !! :P One more thing I just made this account to let the ppl know that its workin.

,mike3dd,2012-10-29T20:10Z,"@EVERYONE: Everyone will have the same file (2267.txt) created in My Documents folder.

HOWEVER, First.. the file your all looking for (Start8sig2267.bin) is specially encoded with your PC systems configuration, IE. HDD Serial Number. So even if you could get the file, it wouldn't matter. Second... Stardock has blocked the serial enclosed in this torrent so activate.stardock.com will no longer generate the 2267.txt file with your unique installation code to register the app. I was one of the few who got mine activated before it got blocked.. I cannot get any of my other PCs to register, even with the registration file.

The contents of the Start8sig2267.bin file is as follows EXACTLY (with no line breaks or spaces!):

Good Luck to anyone who figures it out or makes a crack. Until then, you have to pay or do the 30 day trial! =("
