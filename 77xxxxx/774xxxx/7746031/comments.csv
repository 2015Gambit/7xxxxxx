,gumph1688,2012-10-21T00:48Z,"okay, so i need to configure my usb to xbox, put this file on via horizon? yeah"

,gumph1688,2012-10-21T04:15Z,"i dont understand, what do all them numbers mean? what do i do when ive got horizon on? anyone.. thanks"
,farr3ll,2012-10-21T04:49Z,the numbers are the folder structure on your xbox internal hdd or formatted USB.. haven't a clue WTF this horizon business is though!
,ROM4N,2012-10-21T09:02Z,"@gumph1688

simply use horizon to enter the textures in your usb

,ca1981,2012-10-21T21:10Z,The best and easiest way to use this is to use Horizon + the Microsoft hard drive transfer cable... That way you do not have to use a USB stick at all
,homdawg,2012-10-22T12:46Z,will i get banned for using this..!!!??
,supagusti,2012-10-22T22:44Z,"wouldn't it be easier to simply copy the file to ""Content/0000000000000000/45410993/00000002"" ? 
I'm not sure, so please advise!

,supagusti,2012-10-22T22:50Z,I mean if you're using an external USB drive and a JTAG box...
,acidbrown,2012-10-23T11:54Z,"OK. I have a 8gig USB as hard drive.
I copied the files on to the USB and put it in the box! When checking storage i can see the files in the Games&Apps folder. When i start the game it prompts me to install the HD material (which i have on the USB) Should i just say NO and hope the game will find the HD material by itself? I can not install it on my HD as the USB itself is the HD :)"
,fankoosh,2012-10-23T16:29Z,"ok i followed up steps by wiserxxx & confirm i succefully installed HD contents of game into my HDD , i used 8 gb external usb & format it in xbox then opened the Horizon & inject the hd content file into the usb took about 5-10 mins , then insert again into xbox & transfered the content from usb to xbox HDD , then played the single player Disck2 truncated disc method( CloneCD for burning & select burn till end of media not overburn ) after applying LT+2 Topology & insert the disc into xbox & playing it without problem or any error , i already updated my dashboard with usb method not from game disc "
,supagusti,2012-10-23T18:29Z,@acidbrown: you need another USB stick/-drive with at least 4GB size; then do as wiserxxx said and transfer it to the 8GB stick.
,acidbrown,2012-10-23T21:33Z,"@supa
OK! The game looks OK already but i will test it just to be sure! Thanks buddy!"
,bankbit37bp,2012-10-24T16:12Z,Very Good
,danroberto,2012-10-25T01:08Z,"Perhaps a silly question... I have a RGH. Can I simply copy DVD2 to my external USB and copy the HD texture to HDD1/Content/0000000000000000/... ?
Will it work if the single game is on an external USB and the textures on the internal HDD?

Thx!"
,m4heshd,2012-10-25T18:43Z,Thanks mate. This worked perfectly on my RGH with disk swapper plugin.
,danroberto,2012-10-27T02:58Z,"Guys, nobody knows the answer to my question above?

Also, can someone please give a url for Horizon?
