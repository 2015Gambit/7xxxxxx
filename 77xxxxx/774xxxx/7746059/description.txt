A romantic movie about a widowed US president and a lobbyist who fall in love. It's all aboveboard, but "politics is perception" and sparks fly anyway.

Directed by Rob Reiner. 

Starring Michael Douglas, Annette Bening. 

NOTE: Movie I watched long ago. Recommended. Most people avoided in theaters expecting some political blabbering. It's not, it is very good involving romantic movie.
