I'll let you guys know if it's good.
I've been a while just comment here and there never uploaded because I dont know how to crack. However Im aware how to use TPB for sometime. I  wont warn you over stupid false positive and the like. 
Thanks TPB users/providers"

Thanks NZupload
Not sure if you need crack yet. Rec. to update 1 off another site. Offers Eng/Rus as stated by NZupload.
If you choose not to go by this uploader try search one word Viking. Title are followed by period (.) so searches for full name may show limited result.
Thanks."
