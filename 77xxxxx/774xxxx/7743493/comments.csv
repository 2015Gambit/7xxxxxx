,brigzy,2012-10-20T00:12Z,So this is just the OLD BofB right? Nothing new?
,lukescoot,2012-10-20T00:45Z,"Correct, this is the original Band of Brothers, but its the Collectors Edition Box set, which has an extra part, the 10th part, behind the scenes, director interview, etc. And this is ripped into MP4 for the ipod touch specifically, and can also be watched on the IPAD. Theres a shortage of good ipod touch and ipad rips on here so i figured i would help out a little. 
I will be adding Band of Brothers: The Pacific this weekend though, in the same MP4/Ipad formats. "
