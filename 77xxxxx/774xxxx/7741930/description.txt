Not the greatest torrent, but for Vocaloid fans, here it is: Audio and chopped-up DivX video of the Vocaloid panels at NYCC 2012. The first was with Danny Choo and Megurine Luka's voice actress; the second was a rather disappointing non-announcement about Miku USA's release. Basically: Kaito V3 will come out first, and he sounds sexy as hell, while Miku's English has a long way to go. Credit if you use these would be very nice, but if you don't credit, well I can't really get butthurt after putting it on TPB now can I? Enjoy!
