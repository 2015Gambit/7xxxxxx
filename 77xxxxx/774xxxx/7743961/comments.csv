,ironman1383,2012-10-20T16:21Z,who the fuck would upload a file that you cant stream you fucking sucks stop spamming the piratebays with worthless pile of shits that cant be streamed   only losers watch media on there pc cool people watch there media on there hdtv  hey look its another mp4 worthless pile of shit oh look they uploaded a worthless mkv lets upload every version except for the avi files so you cant stream 
,wenex,2012-10-20T19:13Z,"Hey ironman1383: shut the fuck up, idiot. you don't have clue one to what you're talking about. I play mp4's and mkv's just fine on my flat screen tv, and I do it with a hell of a lot better quality than I ever did AVI's. 

Take your ""cool people"" attitude and upgrade your worthless fucking player and join us in the present, learn how to convert modern files to old avi's, or better yet, just go fuck yourself and complain about free shit to someone else while you sit on your dumb ass not contributing a fucking thing. Fucking retard."

,rmekdaschi,2012-10-22T19:31Z,"have these people never heard of conversion programs or VLC before, jesus christ!"
,KelownaGuy,2012-10-23T19:45Z,"ironman1383 - why not subscribe to cable tv then if you're just going to rant about the files that other people provide for free?

If you wanna be one of the ""cool people watching their media on their HDTV"" (1) get a dictionary (2) learn to  filter your searches to show only mkv results"
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-11-03T12:04Z,"I watch all these on my plasma. I can stream them from my western digital player thing, or i can simply plug my laptop up to the tv using hdmi (better)."
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-11-03T12:04Z,Well not this show. In fact i've never heard about this show..
