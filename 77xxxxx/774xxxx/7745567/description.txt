                               Android Essentials-2010kaiser


Android Essentials is a noΓÇôfrills, noΓÇônonsense, codeΓÇôcentric run through the guts of application development on GoogleΓÇÖs Mobile OS. This book uses the development of a sample application to work through topics, focusing on giving developers the essential tools and examples required to make viable commercial applications work. Covering the entirety of the Android catalog in less than 150 pages is simply impossible.

    Thorough, complete, and useful work on the nuts and bolts of application development in Android
    Example driven and practically minded
    A tool for hobbyists and professionals who want to create productionΓÇôquality applications
