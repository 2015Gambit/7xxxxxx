Manish Bhasin presents all the action from the Football League, as local derbies take centre stage. In the capital, the Championship's form side Crystal Palace meet South London rivals Millwall. Yorkshire pride is at stake as a struggling Sheffield Wednesday take on Neil Warnock's Leeds United. And in Lancashire, Burnley entertain one of the early favourites for promotion, Blackpool.
