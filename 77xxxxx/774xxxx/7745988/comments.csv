,Cartoonworld,2012-10-20T23:53Z,Just to let you know this is 640x480p Fullscreen not widescreen.  
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-10-21T00:23Z,"@Cartoonworld we cap SD channels, and rather than doing 16:9 letterbox Nickelodeon does 4:3 AR. Alas, we can offer 4:3 640x480 as a result instead of the (slightly less common now) 624x352."
