It is the year 2137...

The world has been divided into the western hemisphere and the forbidden lands of the eastern hemisphere.

No one knows better than Jefferson Turck, a lieutenant in the Pan-American Navy, that entering the eastern hemisphere is against the law.

However, during a terrible storm at sea, Turck is forced to take refuge in a land located within the forbidden zone. In this alternative view of world history, Europe has been isolated from the rest of the world for over two centuries and has spiraled down into primitive barbarism.

Turck is shocked by the unforgiving lands he finds himself in, and by the fearsome beasts that inhabit them.

This is the story of Turck's adventures in the land that was all but lost to the world.
