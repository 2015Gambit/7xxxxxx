Autodesk Moldflow plastic injection molding simulation software,
part of the Autodesk solution for Digital Prototyping, provides tools
that help manufacturers validate and optimize the design of plastic
parts and injection molds, and study the plastic injection molding
process. Companies worldwide use Autodesk Moldflow Adviser and
Autodesk Moldflow Insight simulation software to help reduce the
need for costly physical prototypes, avoid potential manufacturing
defects, and get innovative products to market faster.

Magnitude, a measure of the brightness of a star - the Ancient  Greek
astronomers divided  the stars  into six  magnitudes. First-magnitude
stars  were  the  brightest,  and  sixth-magnitude  stars  were   the
faintest. This system has been kept in modern times, when the new era
of MAGNiTUDE has started.

If you  feel like  you have  the power  to face first-magnitude stars

Find us. Maybe on IRC. No email for now, sorry, we may get a new one in
the future
