1962ΓÇô1966 (widely known as "The Red Album") is a compilation of songs by the English rock band The Beatles, spanning the years indicated in the title. It was released with its counterpart 1967ΓÇô1970 ("The Blue Album") in 1973. 1962ΓÇô1966 reached number 3 in the United Kingdom and managed to reach number 1 in the United States Cashbox albums chart. However, in the US, the official chart was administered by Billboard, where 1962ΓÇô1966 peaked at number 3, while 1967ΓÇô1970 reached the top spot. This album was re-released in September 1993 on compact disc, charting at number 3 in the UK.

The album was compiled by Beatles manager Allen Klein. Even though the group had had success with cover versions of songs, most notably with "Twist and Shout", which made number 2 on the Billboard charts, only songs composed by the Beatles themselves were included.

As with 1967ΓÇô1970, this compilation was produced by Apple/EMI at least partially in response to a bootleg collection titled Alpha Omega, which had been sold on television the previous year. Print advertising for the two records made a point of declaring them "the only authorized collection of the Beatles."

For the group's 1963 debut LP Please Please Me, photographer Angus McBean took the distinctive colour photograph of the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI House (EMI's London headquarters in Manchester Square, now demolished). Also in 1963, the cover for The Beatles (No. 1) used a picture from the same shoot.

In 1969, The Beatles asked McBean to recreate this shot. Although the 1969 photograph was originally intended for the planned Get Back album, it was not used when that project saw eventual release in 1970 as Let It Be. Instead, the 1969 photograph, along with an unused photograph from the 1963 photo shoot, was used for both this LP and the cover of 1967ΓÇô1970.

The inner gatefold photo for both LPs is from the "Mad Day Out" photo session in London on Sunday 28 July 1968.

The album cover was designed by Tom Wilkes

2010 remastered version

EMI announced on 10 August 2010, that the album had been remastered for a second time and, once again, would be released as a two-CD package. The album was released worldwide on 18 October 2010, and 19 October 2010 in North America.  

There have been no changes made to the content of the album since the 1993 CD re-issue, apart from the sound quality itself. The short 'whispering' oddity found at the beginning of "I Feel Fine" on the original 1973 LP was not included on the 2010 CD. The stereo version of "From Me To You" found in the original 1973 release was not included on the 1993 and 2010 releases.
