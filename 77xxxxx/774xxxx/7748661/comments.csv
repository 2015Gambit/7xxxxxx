,Envied,2012-11-01T16:35Z,"20:40, The video is great for the size, but did the audio have to be so terrible? 

WMP-HC tells me it's 2 Channels AAC with 64 kbps average per channel. Sometimes when the music kicks up, you can clearly hear the audio compression artifacts. 

The audio is a 10 megabyte part of the file, I would have gladly given up another 10 or 20 megabytes for a larger audio stream.

And thanks for displaying ENCODED BY 20-40 for a few seconds at the 20-second mark in each episode. Would've been nice if that showed up during the credits. 

I'm not one to bitch about free stuff, and I'm sure everyone else appreciates what you've done but its back to the DVDrips for me."
