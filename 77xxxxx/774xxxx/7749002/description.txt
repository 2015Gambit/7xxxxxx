The Rolling Stones
"Get Yourself Together: 1963 - 1970"
Length: 79:43
Format: 320kbps MP3

A concise overview of unreleased material from early 1963 through the Sticky Fingers sessions of 1970. These are unreleased STUDIO recordings ONLY-- not alternate takes, remixes, BBC one-offs, or Andrew Oldham Orchestra recordings. Sources include:

JWB's "Unsurpassed Masters"
Midnight Beat's "Satanic Sessions"
Various Russian "Fake Decca" bootlegs

I do not claim to have "discovered" these recordings. I simply compiled, sequenced, and made minor edits for playability. I also photoshopped the artwork, based on original photography by Gered Mankowitz. 

M3U playlist included. 

Enjoy!
