DISTRICT 97 was formed in the fall of 2006, initially consisting of Jonathan Schang (drums), Rob Clearfield (keys), Patrick Mulcahy (bass) and Sam Krahn (guitars).
Instrumental rock in the vein of Liquid Tension Experiment was their thing from the onset, but when they decided that their music could use a vocalist changes were about to unfurl.

Enter American Idol finalist Leslie Hunt (vocals). Her vocal provess soon started changing the band's stylistic directions, compositions merging challenging and adventurous instrumental sequences with accessible and catchy vocal passages a direct result of her influence on events. The addition of Katinka Kleijn (cello) further expanded the band's musical canvas, and when Krahn decided to opt out, young and talented guitarist Jim Tashjian proved to be the final piece of the puzzle District 97 needed to finalize their stylisitc search.

District 97 signed to Laser's Edge Records in May 2010, and their debut album Hybrid Child was released in September the same year.

This is their 2nd album ΓÇ£Trouble with machinesΓÇ¥.
Nobody knows what ΓÇ£progressive rockΓÇ¥ really means, - this is rock jazz at it┬┤s best. They don┬┤t sound like any other band, but (not only) King Crimson fans should like it.
