Early (1986) (DDD) recording of the widely appealing Holst masterpiece; THE PLANETS


Conducted by musical renaissance man Andre Previn (also a highly gifted jazzman)




Telarc made a big splash in the early days of DIGITAL with exceptionally well 


engineered CD's.   Now you have one more lossless version of THE PLANETS


to choose from.  



Turn the lights off...get lost in space.
