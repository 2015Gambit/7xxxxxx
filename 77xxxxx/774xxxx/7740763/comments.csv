,Funk606,2012-10-20T06:34Z,"@GhostofMackisGod  Well with 24000 seeds, i think we will survive without your dialup modem, so keep your habit up, we do just fine without you seeding!

""The names and abbreviations for numbers of bytes are easily confused with the notations for bits. The abbreviations for numbers of bits use a lower-case ""b"" instead of an upper-case ""B"". Since one byte is made up of eight bits, this difference can be significant. For example, if a broadband Internet connection is advertised with a download speed of 3.0 Mbps, its speed is 3.0 megabits per second, or 0.375 megabytes per second (which would be abbreviated as 0.375 MBps). Bits and bit rates (bits over time, as in bits per second [bps]) are most commonly used to describe connection speeds""

@GhostofMackisGod: Not sure where in Africa u live, but here in Denmark, we have been able to buy 100 Mbit/s connection 10-12 years ago, so dont know why u make a big deal about that u got a slow connection!?! Would not be something I would go around and brag about!"

I uninstalled Frostwire and went with uTorrent. I've never had any problems. The only thing I ever found Frostwire good for was downloading individual songs, but even then you get a lot of bullshit and fakes. I think it's better to just uninstall and go with uTorrent, but that is only my humble opinion. Good luck:)"

I know some people use burnable cds not dvds but how about releasing it for both sets of people. Like Madea's Witness Protection, I was super stoked until I realized it was 2 discs and I am not savvy enough to know how to (or even if it can be done) join the 2 files.

Solve your problem and don't complain about free stuff, that is perfect, only not for you. If you wanna leave a note for other ps3 users, do it short and objective. People just can't be pleased nowadays. End of the rant"

This was one of the worst Ferrell movies he has made.  He seems to be losing it lately. Terrible movie, had a couple funny moments but i kept dozing off trying to watch it....  Not worth the time to be honest....."
,Fritz.,2012-11-08T05:49Z,"good quality.

i didnt like the movie, but i really dont like zach galifianakis so i am probably biased."
,gamer87,2012-11-09T05:25Z,The Rar file is password protected so I can't even extract it???? It tries sending you to some bullshit site... How are you guys watching it???
