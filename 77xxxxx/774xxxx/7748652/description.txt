A story of the unseen sense of going and participating in church. It focuses on three characters and their guardians. This is what is understood to happen within a celebration of mass. From confession, to each part of mass such as communion, the offerings and our prayers for those who have gone to heaven or purgatory. Thus having hope and faith will help the stories advance through the explanation of mass. Written by akira
