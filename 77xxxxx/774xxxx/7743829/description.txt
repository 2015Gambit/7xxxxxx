89 pages! Thrill to these classic tales of the Forgotten Realms, selected by creator Ed Greenwood! First, a thrilling 2-part adventure -- adapted from Greenwood's own story "Elminster at the Magefair"! Plus two classic, genre-busting Forgotten Realms comics from the 1990s: "Head Cheeeese", in which the halfling Foxy battles a very bad case of... er, food poisoning? And a very unusual peek behind the curtain in "Everybody Wants to Run the Realms."
