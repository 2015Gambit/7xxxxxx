I do appreciate the up but if you want to get this message out to as many people as you can, putting the message in a more universal format will work better.

[T],drock232,2012-10-21T20:32Z,"I use Handbrake, because 1 it produces the best quality I've seen for dvd rip's to 698mb. If you have a better suggestion please feel free. Don't just be an ungrateful dipshit. I would use Autogk, but Handbrake produces a better quality. I have done my research, although I can't find a better application then Handbrake. Handbrake produces the best quality I've seen, for the compression ratio as well as the time it takes to rip and encode a movie. SOO PLEASE if you have a better suggestion tell me, don't complain like a little female that just found out she will bleed every month for almost the rest of her life."

,NoMoreAVI,2012-10-24T05:17Z,"M4V is not a valid file type, only iCrap uses it. Use the standard MP4."
[T],drock232,2012-10-24T23:48Z,"Well if it doesn't work on your Windows machine, download the MP4 codecs. It works fine on mine. I usually just change the file extension to MP4. I just left it this time, change it if it bothers you that much. And like I've said before if you know a better program that does avi that produces better quality then Handbrake. Please feel free to let me know."
[T],drock232,2012-10-29T16:28Z,"I mean after all Apple is more centered around multimedia types of software then Windows. Why do you think that most professional film makers either use a form of Linux or an Apple machine, after all Apple is Linux."
,00Garlock,2012-11-07T01:59Z,"Thanks for the upload drock232! Also, Apples OS is based on FreeBSD not Linux."
,dabugarman,2012-11-07T15:32Z,"Thanks for the upload drock!
For those have trouble with it not playing, try using the VCL player. It plays fine on my old XP SP3 machine."
,Troilus25,2012-11-12T02:31Z,"Thanks drick232. I can't imagine why folks are complaining about the container--m4v is mp4, which is pretty standard."
