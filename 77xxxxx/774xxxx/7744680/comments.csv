,Worldtouching,2012-10-22T09:00Z,"Hi.
Sorry this is not a comment about the movie, Its a great movie though :-)
I just dont know where to go. I am looking for the movie ""Little Fauss and  big Halsy"", 1970 (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065989/)
There is an upload in torrrents, but its 425 mb avi, pretty bad quality, as it would be.
So my question here is if anyone knows some movie  interested people who maybe could point me in a direction to a way to contact these?
Thanks in advance"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-10-24T11:14Z,"@Worldtouching :
Well...this is an old movie and it will probably very hard to find...
Like ""easy riders"" too.
We will see if we can find it asap
But we cannot promise you anything about...
We will let you know if something is possible anyway.
have a nice day
cu around"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-10-24T11:59Z,"All done bro,we should get the full DVD from a foreign friend in few incoming days...
We will try to make the best dvdrip as possible for you so.
Be patient 
regards"
,Worldtouching,2012-10-24T15:02Z,"Respect my friend!!! :-)

As it looks it took you roughly 38 minutes to locate it, and just for the record, it was not released in too many countries, my country neither.
But if you havent seen it, and you would like to see Robert Redford play the part of a 2-bit-hustler to perFECtion you can look forward to a treat ;-)"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-11-03T19:27Z,"due to a true lack of seeders,we will release another new smaler version and we apologize for the inconvenience caused for anyway. "
,Worldtouching,2012-11-08T02:08Z,"Hi Tyr3ll.
Is there any news from your friend with the Little Fauss and Big Halsy movie?
No intention here to rush you, just to make sure it hadnt slipped your mind ;-)"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-11-08T18:13Z,"Hey bro,ya,we got it but i don't have very good news for you :
DVD is in english without any subtitle and quality is really very bad :(
4/3 in more...
Therefore i'm not sure be able to make a true miracle about so.
Let me some time,please,because i have my kid who takes me a lot of time for sure anyway :s
I will try next week to see if i can do something good enough about then.
Ty for understanding
I will try my best but it will be very very difficult due to crap video quality so.
Original DVD from USA...
friendly your "
,Worldtouching,2012-11-09T01:22Z,"Ok I understand. Please just take your time. It seems to be one of those movies that just went into limbo, which i dont understand of course, since it is one of the most believable performances by an actor I ever saw.

As I wrote,there is another upload of it

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4350608/Little_Fauss_and_Big_Halsy

and THAT is crap for sure (425 mB playtime 1 hour 45 min.) so I am 108,7 percent sure that whatever you can come up with it will be a severe improvement. ;-)
I had it on a video tape I had recorded from danish television (thats my nationality as you prolly gathered) and that was just fine. But all the 2-300 tapes ended their days  some years ago in a major clean-out, so since then I have had to watch the forementioned version the 2 times I really just wanted to watch it again. And both times I deleted it again straight after because it was so terrible quality :-D

So as I said, just take your time, and I would like to add that I absolutely appreciate your help whatever the result will end up in.

Greets"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-11-23T00:32Z,"@WorldTouching :
the only thing i can do for you is to up the iso of our DVD.But the quality will not be really good like i said to you then.
If you are ok for,let me know and i will anyway.
greets"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-11-23T00:37Z,"@WorldTouching :
Unless you prefer a try from our part to a possible remastered version but it will be not be easy 'cause this movie is very old and the DVD we have about is really not very good as well.
See yourself and decide and we will try our best about so.
cu around bud."
