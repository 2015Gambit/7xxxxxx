But is it really necessary to rar it? ^^"
,4life666,2012-10-21T15:27Z,"What makes this Jtag-rgh?

Is it in a GOD container?
"
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-21T19:45Z,"@Clownman1 Necessary? no but compresses game to a smaller size which means less time to download.

@4life666 This is not a GOD container. I simply extract the game from the iso using Xbox Image Browser. "
,mat2209,2012-10-22T10:53Z,Still askes me to insert Singleplayer disc when i try to starty Single Player campaign. Does anyone have this problem either?
,scetopismo,2012-10-22T13:31Z,@Ripclaw187 Do you have Dead Rising 1 (PAL or RF) for uploading?
,nunu90,2012-10-22T15:45Z,if i download this ... what about the HD content in disk two !!!!
,nunu90,2012-10-22T15:45Z,sorry i meant disk one 
,nunu90,2012-10-22T15:56Z,what about the HD content in disk 1
,alexjrcasado,2012-10-22T16:43Z,"@Ripclaw187 --- to run this using RGH all that has to be done once extracted is to place it in the content/0000000000 folder? Please confirm, thanks!"
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-22T18:54Z,"@alexjrcasado To play place the extracted folder on your internal or a external hard-drive. Use xexmenu or FreestyleDash to click on default.xex in the game folder. Plenty of videos on youtube on how to do this. 

@nunu90 go here for the HD textures:

,Ripclaw187,2012-10-22T21:00Z,"@alexjrcasado I tested game through xexmenu and freestyledash (pressing default.xex) and both asked ""Please insert Single Player Disk"". to play the game without that problem inside freestyledash settings set the scan to the location of the game. Then inside XBOX 360 Games choose game. Also unless you download and install the HD Texture Content press B when the game asks to install it. Hope this helps."
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-22T21:06Z,The above comment was to mat2209 not alexjrcasado.
,alexjrcasado,2012-10-23T20:27Z,@Ripclaw187 - it run the game from xexmenu clicking default.xex and it still asks to insert SP disc. How do I get it to run through XEXMENU as I donÂ´t have Freestyledash? Please help me!!!
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-24T08:14Z,"sorry alexjrcasado for the long wait. I tried everything I could think of to get the game to load correctly in xexmenu and nothing worked. So, I uploaded freestyledash and a quick install txt to help you with this problem. Hope this helps you and anyone else whose having the same problem.

sorry 4 my bad English "
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-27T20:47Z,"@nunu90 Read the comments and you'll see how I said to fix this problem. Since I only put disk 2, you have to use freestyle dash.  "
,nunu90,2012-10-27T23:24Z,"@Ripclaw187
i have a freestyle dash 2.2,,,done as you said to mat2209 second comment ,,, same problem :(
plz help"
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-28T00:07Z,Are you going into Xbox360games and clicking icon or file manager and clicking on default.xex? Game won't work if you click on default.xex.
,nunu90,2012-10-28T00:20Z,yes iam going into Xbox360games and starting  it from there 
,Ripclaw187,2012-10-28T02:40Z,"Sorry I can't figure out what you are doing wrong but it's clear it's on your side. I tried it on my jtag and two rgh consoles and worked every time. My only suggestion is to delete the HD Texture DLC (Content/0000000000000000/45410993) and then try it the way I said. I also noticed disk 2 doesn't show up in Xbox 360 Games but in Homebrew inside Freestyle Dash. If that doesn't help then find and download Disk 1.                          

good luck "
,mactawish1,2012-10-28T08:16Z,"bro i have the same problem (Please insert Single Player Disk) when i press B then he gave insert co-op Mutiplayer disc.

,nunu90,2012-10-31T23:00Z,i tried every thing 
,Ripclaw187,2012-11-01T06:08Z,Make sure your DashLaunch is current. I'm on DashLaunch V3.02 (459)
,jlbf0786,2012-11-03T04:44Z,So does it work or not?????
,mactawish1,2012-11-03T10:21Z,"Ripclaw187   bro i used DashLaunch V3.02 (459) but this cannot swap the disc. 
enable the auto swap in behaviour and also add swap.xex plugins but cant work help me plz"
,azuziel,2012-11-03T22:28Z,"Freestyle 3 is out people. Update to kernel 16179, install dashlaunch 3.03 and Freestyle 3. Works fine. Freestlye 2.2 is old, and cruddy. Freestyle 3 is much faster, and does a far better job swapping discs. Don't enable the dashlaunch disk swap AND use freestyle or you'll have problems with newer titles such as this. "
,azuziel,2012-11-03T22:36Z,"The title works. Freestyle Dash 3 revision 58 is out. Use that. I use it, and works. Dashlaunch 3.03 is also out. If you try to use freestyle disk swap, and the dashlaunch disk swap plugin, you'll have issues. Freestyle 3 is FAR superior to it's predecessor and is readily available in the usual places (except auto xbins, u wont find it there - yet). "
,Ripclaw187,2012-11-04T23:25Z,thanks for the info azuziel.
