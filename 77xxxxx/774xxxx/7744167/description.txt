The Georgia Bootleg Box is the first entry in GovΓÇÖt MuleΓÇÿs official bootleg series on Evil Teen. This documents the original trio lineup of Warren Haynes, Matt Abts, and the late Allen Woody during a three-night springtime run in Georgia in 1996 ΓÇö Athens on April 11, AtlantaΓÇÖs Roxy on the 12th, and the Elizabeth Reed Music Hall in Macon on the 13th. This setΓÇÖs 6 discs contain over 7 hours of music.

GovΓÇÖt Mule had been playing live for over three years at the time these shows took place. They had established not just their trademark loud and proud brand of gritty blues-rock and improvisation, but had gelled as a unit who could communicate with one another without a lot of interference. 1996 was a pivotal year, and whatΓÇÖs documented here reveals this in spades. 

Despite the similarity in the set lists each night, the performances are often quite distinct from one another ΓÇö in terms of spontaneity and musicality, not quality. All are exceptional. These were not workmanlike gigs. Check the three different reads of the then-new ΓÇ£Game Face,ΓÇ¥ which all commence exactly the same way yet spiral off in different directions. The metallic blues of ΓÇ£Mother EarthΓÇ¥ may be a basic 12-bar, but it reveals the depth of communication between WoodyΓÇÖs fat-bottom, fluid bass playing and AbtsΓÇÖ drumming. ItΓÇÖs so intuitive it allows Haynes an elastic freedom ΓÇö he can play at his bandmembers but also move far afield without worrying about the groove being fluid and in the pocket ΓÇö and sometimes, as on ΓÇ£Blind Man in the Dark,ΓÇ¥ which opens each night, he travels great distances. 

There are a number of extra treats here as well. Derek Trucks joins the bandΓÇÖs encores in Atlanta and Athens, while blues hero Tinsley Ellis appears on the Macon date. Some of the covers are true highlights as well, including Blind FaithΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Presence of the Lord,ΓÇ¥ SteppenwolfΓÇÖs ΓÇ£DonΓÇÖt Step On the Grass, SamΓÇ¥ (Atlanta), and an amazing cover of Little FeatΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Spanish MoonΓÇ¥ with Trucks on slide. 

Given its sheer volume, The Georgia Bootleg Box is for the hardcore Mule fan to be sure. That said, this behemoth also reveals in intricate detail what a hungry power trio playing at its very best is capable of.
