Wildlife is the second studio album from post-hardcore band La Dispute. The album was released through No Sleep Records on October 4, 2011. Like their first release La Dispute took control of all of the production duties in order to have complete creative control. Two singles were released digitally prior to its release, "The Most Beautiful Bitter Fruit" and "Harder Harmonies". The title Wildlife is not derived from lyrics from the album rather conceptual themes that connect the songs together. The entire album became available to stream, by the band, on September 22. The album was well received by critics. With critics mainly drawing upon its more melodic approach to their style as well as its lyrical content. In its first week the band sold 3,140 copies in the United States.
