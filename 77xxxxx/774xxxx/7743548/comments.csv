What to do?
1. Backup saves in MOHW_DayOnePatch_PC folder in User Documents
2. Delete folder
3. UnRAR the UNLOCK version AS IS, don't put any crack on it
4. UnRAR the ""update.common.zip"" by FLT to game folder or to a folder of your choice and copy the content to game foldr afterwards
5. Open Launcher.exe and PLAY

6. That's it! No more copy&pasting necessary"
