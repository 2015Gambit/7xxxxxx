Along with the ability to format Mac disks from your PC, you can use MacDriveΓÇÖs CD/DVD Creator to burn Mac CDs and DVDs with ease.

Quick Start Launcher
MacDrive has always been a simple, seamless utility for sharing files between Mac disks and Windows. MacDrive 9 makes it even easier with Quick Start. Now youΓÇÖre just a click away from all of MacDriveΓÇÖs features.

Security and Optimization
MacDrive Pro works hard to protect your dataΓÇöeven when you want to delete it. The new ΓÇ£Secure DeleteΓÇ¥ option completely wipes the files from your Mac disk so they cannot be recovered.

Along with security, speed has always been a hallmark of MacDrive. The best way to increase speed is to have a clean disk. MacDrive Pro takes this a step further with the new built-in auto defrag that constantly optimizes your files to keep them lean and mean.
