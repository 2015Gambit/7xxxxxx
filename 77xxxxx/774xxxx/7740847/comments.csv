,P_W_W,2012-10-19T10:13Z,"I experienced several times that GlowGaze tells us that he added subs in the torrent; he adds ""+ Subtitles"" to the name of his torrents. In his torrents that I dl'ed so far, the only file besides the videofile is a text file called GlowGaze.Com.txt which is an add for the torrent site. On GlowGaze.com subs are added in a later version of the torrents, but he uploads the version without subs.
Please leave the ""+ Subtitles"" part in the torrentname next time or upload when subs are available."
[T],GlowGaze,2012-10-19T13:54Z,"I already explained that to you specifically....but I'll do it again since it seems that you don't get it

Because when I upload the Episode ASAP, the Subtitles aren't ready at the time of the upload but will be in couple of hours or so...and when they are, I can't include them in the torrent by that time. But when they're ready by the time of the upload I usually do include them in the torrent itself

Why do I have to put ""+ Subtitles"" in the title? Because I can't edit it afterwards & it's only the first couple of hours when the Subtitles aren't there anyway ;) "
[T],GlowGaze,2012-10-19T13:56Z,"And btw...If you don't like my torrents then please, go get what you need somewhere else....I'm doing my best here to get it all for you but you keep nagging anyway"

,Mhen93,2012-10-20T03:45Z,"Thanks for the upload GlowGaze! Also for the subs. I have noticed that most of the subs I've downloaded lately are from you. So, thanks!

At this download I experienced, for the first time with your torrents I think, some problems. There were about 3 times that the file crashed, including the 2-3 last minutes. I haven't tried to re-download it yet, but have anyone else experienced the same?

(And of course, seed your share! Thanks.) :)"
,Mhen93,2012-10-20T03:49Z,"Except for this, the torrent was good! If you don't count for the last part, you also lost less than a minute from the crashes."
,industrialized,2012-10-20T11:30Z,Thanks =)
,Pir8Gold,2012-10-25T11:30Z,"Yes, I also had trouble with this one. The audio is wonky starting about 2/3, there are some blank spots including the last few minutes. Using VLC. "
