The first major update to the Prison Architect Alpha has been released!

The game is a top down construction and management simulation where the player takes control of the running and building of a maximum security prison.
The players role is of both architect and governor with sandbox micromanagement themes such as choosing where to put lights, drains and how they connect together.

ALPHA 2!

ENJOY :)
