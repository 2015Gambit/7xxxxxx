When Stoick has a portrait of himself and Hiccup painted for the collection in
the Great Hall, Hiccup ends up depicted as a strong, burly Viking, not his usual
skinny self. To prove he's the Viking his father wishes he was, Hiccup embarks on
an epic quest to find the lost treasure of Hamish the First, BerkΓÇÖs first chief.
