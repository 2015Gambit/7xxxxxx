There are two bonus tracks (Madrox & Monoxide)

I forgot to include that in the description.

Track 17 - ""Return Of The Pervert"" is Madrox's Bonus Track"

You need to DL a torrent program, such as UTorrent to DL the torrents. I highly recommend uTorrent, it's simple and free.
TO the uploader, MMFWCL!!!"

,Babylon42,2012-10-28T17:52Z,MMFWCL! I bought both albums but their just to pretty to open. I did the same with Holiday heat and American Psycho Tour. Thanks so much Dawg!!
,Juggalo_Riddle,2012-10-29T07:17Z,"@WyattSEarp - You fucking troll! You're a damn liar. For one to download one of my torrents, and leave a comment when not having uploaded any torrents themselves, your comment has no standing ground. I'm not out here misleading people. Go back to your hole. There is nothing wrong with this torrent. Your a waste of space, please do the world a favor and eliminate yourself. FUCK THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!"
,WyattSEarp,2012-10-29T20:57Z,"I an not lying. Dude, I came here looking for this album. I bought it and gave it to a friend. Great album but try not uploading adware with it. I have the proof."
,Sionide,2012-11-05T20:43Z,Hm. When I scanned for adware I didn't come across any problems... Don't know why it would be happening to just one person unless he was lying. lol. I listen to this every day. Thanks Juggalo_Riddle :) Whoop whoop.
,Juggalo_Riddle,2012-11-10T08:52Z,"@Sionide

""Don't know why it would be happening to just one person unless he was lying. lol""

That's fucking right! lol - Lame ass people always trying to fuck something good up. Honestly, do you think 103 people are going to download this shit, and NOT report some adware, or virus. Get fucking real. Nothing but positive feedback, you damn douche!

@All the Juggalos - Thanks for reporting back, the only way people can really find motivation to actually share shit like this, is to see the positive side of torrenting, helping people out, and feeling appreciated. So..point be said, leaving feedback helps ^_^ thanks!"
