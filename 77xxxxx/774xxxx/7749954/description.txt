Match of the Day Two 21.10.2012

Duration: 60 Min

Colin Murray presents highlights of the day's Premier League games, which see Sunderland face local rivals Newcastle and QPR entertain Everton.

The Tyne-Wear derby is always a fiercely contested fixture, and the last four meetings have produced a total of four red cards, including dismissals for Sunderland duo Stephane Sessegnon and Lee Cattermole when the sides last met in March. On that occasion Shola Ameobi netted a late equaliser for Newcastle, who have only lost one of their last 15 games against the Black Cats.

The day's other game sees QPR meet Everton at Loftus Road, where the Toffees have only won once in the last 25 years. Rangers narrowly avoided relegation on the final day of last season, but will expect a better performance this season following the signing of high-profile trio Julio Cesar, Park Ji-Sung and Esteban Granero.

Colin and guests also look back at the goals from Saturday's eight matches.
