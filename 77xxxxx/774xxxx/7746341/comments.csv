,rudy988,2012-10-21T01:53Z,how do you view this file ? :(
,jj441,2012-10-21T02:51Z,why is the file smaller than 375mb? is it lower quality?
,WoundedWolfgirl,2012-10-21T03:07Z,"Thank you so much for this, I had a really bad day at work and I needed this. So thank you, ez, thanks a bunch!"
,genevieve1,2012-10-21T04:20Z,Thanks for the upload and the other shows u upload. Love Merlin! Fantastic show
,CosmAvngr,2012-10-21T06:31Z,"@JJ441

Quality is high. Size is about right for 720x404 video.

The real question would be why other were 375 MB. That is is overkill for this resolution."
,kaptkbz,2012-10-21T07:17Z,how do you view which what?! Shit. behave
,jnhkll,2012-10-21T08:34Z,"Wd hd tv live can't play this video ""Unable to play the selected file. Please see the User Manual for a list of supported file formats."""
,ogilitis,2012-10-21T11:05Z,Thank you..
,dee60,2012-10-21T18:53Z,Thanks.
,dee60,2012-10-21T18:57Z,"@jnhkll .mp4 is a supported file format WD HDTV Live. Maybe your player needs a reboot.
Unplug your player for 10 seconds and plug it in again. This may solve your problem. It has for me in the past."
,AtotehZ,2012-10-21T21:54Z,"@rudy988 i think the better question is, how don't you view this file. And I can't think of any way.

You can view it with mediaplayer which is standard for windows, but VLC probably the best for a guy like you."
,Dufox,2012-10-23T05:06Z,"if you cant play the file download VLC media player & windows media player classic.

if you still cant play the file on either of those media players and you have windows then download shark007 codec for win 7 or win 8.

if you still cant play the file... the computer gods hate you^^

if you want to play the file on your ps3 then download Tversity media share program.

Tversity will play any kind of video file you put on it, literally :D

,MaGicbush,2012-10-24T01:08Z,Whats with the weird format? It wont work on PS3 with the media server... sigh gotta convert it.
,MaGicbush,2012-10-24T01:13Z,"Nevermind, for some reason there is not file extension it just says file. Added the .mpg to the end and it works fine :D."
