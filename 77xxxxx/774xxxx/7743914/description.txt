History:

Singer songwriter Lily Frost is a rare bird from Canada’s musical woods. Frost has always danced the line between indie and jazz, thus creating a niche of her own. Frost draws from her real life experiences in her lyrics – in performance, there is an intimacy, a gentle passion that can take you somewhere else and evokes a certain nostalgia – the rainy streets of Paris, a winter picnic or perhaps a beat café in San Francisco. This rarity and distinctiveness can be found on her latest offering, Do What You Love.

Do What You Love puts Lily’s distinct sound and exceptional talents together in one concise package. From the lyrics to the arrangements to the striking artwork, it packs a punch and delivers insightful truths about life – embracing femininity with strength, joy and creativity.

“I wanted to make a fun, upbeat record for my daughter that included lessons I had learned the hard way,” says Lily. “I wanted to leave people feeling inspired with smiles on their faces.”

Largely written in a cabin in Georgian Bay, Do What You Love was recorded at Pirate Studios in downtown Toronto and was produced by Juno award-winners me&john (Ryan Kondrat and John LaMagna), who also play on the record. The record also features Jose Contreras (By Divine Right) and includes cameos by Brydon Baird, and Brendon Canning and a string arrangement on ‘Stand’ by Todor Kobokov.
