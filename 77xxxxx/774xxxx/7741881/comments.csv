,darkgamerX,2012-10-19T14:39Z,FIXED! works on windows 8 64bit for those who are wondering. no more crashing after selecting new game. menus/convos are showing text 
,chrisroberts2,2012-10-19T15:31Z,Could you upload a crack for this please?
,Taosinky,2012-10-19T16:36Z,Work fine. No more font problem. But the Xbox 360 Pad Wireless config problem persist...
,ivanhoe68,2012-10-19T17:16Z,"I dunno, but what are the companies thiking when they release a game and the 360 pad is configed the wrong way, do they even try their own games before release? No wonder people download the games for free....... And this is not the first time that a game i is configed with the pad in a wrong way. And remember, when you start the game you get promted with ""designed to play with gamepad"" And a picture of a 360 pad....."
,IndigoAK,2012-10-19T19:00Z,"There's a wired version of the Xbox 360 controller.  You know.  Wires.  Those long bundles of copper and padding that are covered in plastic composites that transfer information between a device and your computer.  I know, I know.  Who's ever heard of such a thing in this glorious age of wireless technology.  Mind blowing!"

,ivanhoe68,2012-10-19T21:14Z,"@IndigoAK

What the fuck did you smoke? I do not give a shit about your wired cheap 360 pad, im on the original WIRELESS one, so stop acting that you know something......"
,ivory_soul,2012-10-21T02:45Z,@ivanhoe68 IndigoAK has a point. I ALSO have a wired 360 controller and it works just fine fucktard. Not everything in life needs to be fucking wireless. My Razer Mamba 2012 Edition has BOTH options and I use both frequently. Take your elitist bullshit where someone cares.
,4Life.,2012-10-22T23:55Z,Thank you.
