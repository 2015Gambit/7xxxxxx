This will fix the corrupted save error that occurred when I tried to quit and replay my game.

Specifically this release

Mark of the Ninja Steam-Rip CRACKED MULTi6-RG Origins  

It works well and should for all releases with the corrupt save file error.

Please do post a comment and let me know if it worked for you as well.

Sharing is caring

Now go play

Peace Out!
