,rgeronimo,2012-10-19T21:35Z,"yeah the torrent doesn't download at all. And it's only 30kb, you might as well upload it to any site like mediafire or something. if it really does work that is."

,jjbane,2012-10-24T04:25Z,cant unrar the files
,gmitsu,2012-10-24T05:08Z,"Working just fine, many thanks! About unziping the file, try 7zip, working just fine for me"
,mzisette,2012-10-25T01:06Z,"I can't unpack it. Keeps saying that there is no operation.

Any help?"
,my_dixie_normous,2012-10-25T08:39Z,as gmitsu so wisely said you need a application like 7zip or winzip or winirar to extract the files inside the zip folder. Those applications can be found on the net as freeware. I suggest if you have anything to do with getting torrents at all.....you will need something to extract files some time soon. 
,Nanosaur,2012-10-25T22:22Z,I cant find steam_rld.ini. Please help.
,my_dixie_normous,2012-10-26T00:48Z,"@Nanosaur

The file you are looking for is in the game directory. Follow the instructions included in this file. Depending on how you installed the game (the method used) the easiest way is to right click the desktop icon and choose 'open file location'. Look for the bin folder......and there you will see the steam_api.dll. If you installed it with steam look in the steamapps >common >mark_of_the_ninja >bin 

Hope that helps you."
,DeviJoker,2012-10-26T18:39Z,"THIS FIX WORKS! Wasn't able to unrar with Winrar but I took gmitsu's advice & used 7zip instead & it worked. Also, I had trouble saving the steam_rld.ini file after editing it so I simply saved it at another location then copied & pasted it back into the bin folder. Ty my_dixie_normous & gmitsu!"
