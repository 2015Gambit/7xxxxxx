Releasing an early snapshot this week because we need to crunch out the pre-release as soon as possible. This snapshot has the following changes:

1.Anvil block has been tweaked (it's cheaper to create, minor visual changes, and you can repair tools using wood/ingots/diamonds)
2.Bats no longer trample crops or trigger pressure plates
3.Redstone repeaters can be "locked" (fixed output) by having a powered repeater connected to its left or right side
4.Added an option to hide a serverΓÇÖs IP address
5.Updated language files
6.More bugfixes & tweaks!
