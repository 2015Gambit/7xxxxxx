NewB V3 has been redesigned from the ground up for better performance and more importantly much improved Audio quality together with a multitude of important additions. newB V3 now does it's internal processing in a multi-band fashion. The low frequency Sub-harmonic generation algorithm now also behave in a much more Analog manner by looking at many more audio characteristics.

newB V3 now features a sub-harmonic compressor which can be adjusted to taste depending on the audio material. The compressor can be used to 'bring out' more detail and better target the audio into a mix. The Compressor is unique in it's operation as there is no ratio selection only a percentage based strength and a selection of response curves (These are somewhat dynamic i.e. internally they are adjusted automatically depending on the provided audio material) which correspond to your taste.
