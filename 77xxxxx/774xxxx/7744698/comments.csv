Seems like a waste of data. Crop those black lines out and make the file 1920x816. That'd be 100% pure movie bits in the file.

I know the scene manipulate a full panavision (anamorphic) 2.35:1 (2.40:1) aspect ratio to 1.85:1 to save file space and not code the black bars and get full screen picture on your 16:9 tv at 16:9 scrren setting, but that just distorts and manipulate the picture so the picture get out of the right proportions (zoomed in). 

I wish the scene would stop manipulate the picture as explained above, because if you don't like the black bars and wanna remove them you can use your aspect ratio setting on your tv/remote or on you media player. VLC for example can do this.

Actually you tv does the same. When a 2.35:1 aspect ratio movie/input (from a 2.35:1 source/dvd/br) gets shown on a 16:9 tv at a 16:9 screen setting the 2.35:1 (21:9) apect ratio gets shown at a 1.85:1 (16:9) aspect ratio (zoomed in). If you want to get the right 2.35:1 aspect ratio from the source/dvd/br you have to set the screen setting to 4:3 on either your tvbox/dvd/br. Then the full 2.35:1 panavision theatre picture will be shown on a 16:90 tv set.

Thanks for this upload Betty-Boop."
