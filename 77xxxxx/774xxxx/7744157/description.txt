These are likely some of the oldest comic books I will ever upload. Books this old don't 'Restore' well - just something about the way they were printed and colored that doesn't lend to the process. However, for being 70 years old, they actually look very good. Much more readable than a lot of thin paper, colored books I've seen from the 70s and 80s
