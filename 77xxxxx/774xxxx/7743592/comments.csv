,bjorn2lust,2012-10-20T01:20Z,"Just one seeder, please?"
,Comr,2012-10-20T01:59Z,I would seed. If I could get it downloaded.
,Ixor779,2012-10-20T02:29Z,"Excellent, thanks."
,T3st1fy,2012-10-20T03:33Z,gonna try it out thanks
,iouxsie,2012-10-20T03:58Z,How is it with 150+ seeders I can't get shit for download speed?
,DeusVult7,2012-10-20T04:27Z,It won't download!
,Kallidrad,2012-10-20T04:36Z,"I think there was an error on the uploaders part (or he just didn't stay around to do anything), because there are no files registered and it doesn't even create the folder."
,Shintien,2012-10-20T04:45Z,There's no folder
,T3st1fy,2012-10-20T06:04Z,ya it wont connect to shit nor download whatsoever
,corkebab,2012-10-20T07:58Z,Found the original. Testing it now.
,andreyppsc,2012-10-20T13:34Z,"Off the record:
@Kallidrad This is a magnet link, there are no more torrent files on pirate bay. There are files registered but you have to wait till they appear (when the user that has DLC and patch open his torrent client).

On the record:
Did anyone, that installed the DLC and patch, experienced any glitches such as the portraits of the characters are not rightly placed?"
,Kallidrad,2012-10-20T14:36Z,"@andreyppsc

The 'didnt stick around thing' was my second theory (it was in the commment; I also assumed there could have been an error with Lingvort just screwing up, but I'm glad to see that it was just him leaving before anyone anyone managed to download anything).

Also; I have yet to download the dlc, but I did find a 1.07 patch somewhere else while waiting for the expansion to be on here.  That doesn't seem to have caused any issues.  The faction GUI is.... poorly implemented, once you get a signifigently large faction.  It fixed that oh so annoying bug (at least, I had it) where you would have to restart to adjust the date if you clicked 'saved game' but decided to go back to historical start.

I haven't noticed any bugs in 1.07, and it hasn't crashed once in the roughly twenty hours I've played on it.  Paradox has been remarkably good about bugs in CK2, at least compared to most of their games.

I also don't use the SxSxl repack, but I will leave a comment about whether or not you'll have to reinstall the game if you use a different pack (I have no idea what I've downloaded, but I assume if it works for both of those it would have a decent chance of working for what anyone else has)

On a side note; once things got going, it began downloading rather quickly."
,doomdemon,2012-10-20T16:06Z,"WARNING!
I overwrote my existing DLC's with the ones in here and it ended up breaking my sword of Islam DLC, even though it is enabled, in game it says i need it to play with Muslims. When moving the DLC's DON'T overwrite existing ones and it will probably work."
,Kallidrad,2012-10-20T16:27Z,"This requires a file from the SxSxL repack.  Not ""Its best to do with with that file"" but ""You are required to download an extra 400 megabytes because I was too lazy to put the Activation_DLC.exe file in this"" (its an ISO file, so you can't just download a small extra thing) Unless, of course, you have no intention of playing with the Legacy of Rome dlc... but 1.07 has no copy proctection, so why the hell would you download this if you weren't here for the DLC?

Conclusion; it does what it says, and the SxSkL thing is an inconvenience rather than an actual issue, but it could definently be better, or at least state in the description that you are required to download the SxSkL instead of saying that they are only tested on it.  Honestly, I wouldn't even have had an issue with this if that was mentioned."
,andreyppsc,2012-10-20T16:31Z,"The patch seems to ruin the whole game for me. Like I said before the portraits are not in place, the loading screen is messed up, etc. I tried reinstalling the SxSxl repack, i put the dlc's, everything. But after i patched i, again, the same issues. I tried the skidrow version, but same thing happened after applying the 1.07 patch. I downloaded the official 1.07 from paradox which is free, but same thing happened. I will share a link soon with printscreens."
,andreyppsc,2012-10-20T16:33Z,"@Kallidrad
Could you tell me, please, what packs did you use?"

PS: ignore the russian texts, i recently tried a new pack, but also didn't work"
,Kallidrad,2012-10-20T17:09Z,"@andreyppsc

I don't know.  Whether the 1.07 bugs apply to you or not seems to be random; while the forums are vocal about it, the people who it doesn't effect obviously won't have anything to say about it.

There is, apparently, a hotfix from paradox coming out monday; if the bugs are really that bad for you, then find something else to do till the 22nd."
,andreyppsc,2012-10-20T17:39Z,"I've found this on a forum, maybe it will work. If it works, i'll say something about it; if not i'll wait until 22nd. Thnks

,Maher90,2012-10-20T22:53Z,this is one of most stupidest uploads..CAN'T you just upload a pure non-exclusive repack DLC? why do you force us to download a stupid repack just to use this!..ah gosh
,Kallidrad,2012-10-21T14:20Z,"@andreyppsc

Like I said, it sometimes happens and sometimes doesn't.  Has less to do with version and more to do with, I'd assume, computer.

I, apparently, am just plain lucky.  I get slightly more lag than normal, and that's it."
,andreyppsc,2012-10-21T15:46Z,"I've found out that others have the same problem. Apparently there is an issues with some graphic cards (the portraits are ruined). The fix you told me about will eventually solve this problem. Gonna wait till tomorrow. Btw, those that have access to the paradox forums, could you please download the test fix and share it?.

,Kallidrad,2012-10-22T00:05Z,"Okay, impressions; it all works for me.  Outside of the bad instructions, this is a good torrent."
,Clausewitz89,2012-10-22T11:52Z,it dosen't find any files when i start the dl !!! 
,MVultra,2012-10-23T01:42Z,"Can someone enlighten us on how to properly install this patch??

Also, do we have to copy only the new DLCs???

Thanks."
,locnar19,2012-10-23T05:06Z,None of my DLCs work including Legacy of Rome. Anyone know how to fix this?
,sergio_sos,2012-10-24T00:55Z,"Ok, downloading now. Will comment later if this works.
But thanx in advance Lingvort!"
,sergio_sos,2012-10-24T01:54Z,"It seems to be working fine. Download the previous 1.06 that is in the explanation of this torrent. Do all it says there.
Then download this torrent, and only copy and paste the new DLC.
Update the game from the launcher, there is a new 1.07b version.
Hope this helps."
,MVultra,2012-10-24T03:20Z,"@sergio_sos - thanks.

I had the other 1.06 installed, then I installed this 1.07, but the Swords of Islam didnt work in the end =("
,Jason310M,2012-10-24T18:22Z,The 1.07b I downloaded from the launcher cannot find CKII installed on my computer. Any chance of uploading a copy of 1.07b that will work with this version?
,opaleg,2012-10-25T05:22Z,"Since nobody seems to be answering in either comment areas for this or the earlier torrent:

Does this AND/OR the earlier torrent [I know you need them both] contain all DLCs not mentioned or at LEAST the Ruler Designer?

I mean the torrent by this same uploader."
,opaleg,2012-10-25T06:04Z,"I can confirm that installing this and the other torrent will get you the DLC Ruler Designer and all others I know of.

The instructions are very clear on how to install this.

""If you have this [linking earlier one] repack installed, then the steps are next""

It does not say other options. It says you need the other repack, just not in perfect english."
,Nanijirobi,2012-10-26T13:06Z,"Broke all other DLCs, the new one works fine though."
,alphazetabeta,2012-10-27T00:19Z,Anyone else notice the sprites are a bit messed up in this release (discolouration on the top)? Is it just the patch itself?
,elfagata,2012-10-27T15:11Z,"I will add something that may help, I hope. 
I did exactly as the instructions said and installed the previous torrent first and this one after it. 
When I started the launcher after everything and downloaded the 1.07b update it looked like a brand new installation. So I didn't install it in the game folder but in a separate place. Then I copied the files over those in the original game folder. This way all my DLCs are working fine."
,massumibr,2012-10-29T21:14Z,"What the fuck, man, why is the file encrypted? Could someone please tell me the password? It requires me to sign for a cell phone service that costs 5 bucks a week."
,instacra,2012-11-06T08:33Z,"@massumibr - What exactly did you download, lol? 

Be sure to use the ""GET THIS TORRENT"" link either above or below the description for the torrent. There's a picture of a magnet to the left of it. I believe you may have accidentally clicked one of the spam ""DOWNLOAD"" bullshit things that flood the net now."
,bryk,2012-11-11T21:47Z,"Well, in that case I've got to ask -will this version (repacked by Lingvort) work with future DLCs? Because I already have the Skidrow install that was working fine until Legacy of Rome screwed it up. I'm getting this guy's file as well just to play LoR, but there's more DLCs coming..."
,adeputu,2012-11-15T00:10Z,"@bryk:

apparently not, we need the repack from sxsxx or whatever his name, just like the uploader mentioned above. im also using skidrow release, and this file also ruin my file, so instead i just download like the uploader mentioned.

as for future dlc, lets just hope they'll just keep updating it since skidrow seems no longer took interest in this game."
,Wolfcry,2012-11-19T12:58Z,"Thanks for the UL.


Will you upload the new DLC, the Sunset Invasion as well?.

,Vasto23,2012-11-20T21:06Z,"Works fine, thx, only got to fix coat of arms again."
,evalillith,2012-11-21T22:16Z,"@MVultra

It will only work if you have the previous repack.
If you do, and have it installed, follow the previous instructions with the activation DLC. exe. with this update+new DLC, I just copied the entire folder and  replaced even the old DLC's. Ran the activation until the in game popup disappeared, then closed it. Copy the update files over, and it worked perfectly. Hopefully this helps everyone out."
,Aodr,2012-11-23T14:20Z,Is Sunset Invasion going to be uploaded soon?
