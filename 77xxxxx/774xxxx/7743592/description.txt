Patch 1.07 + "Legacy of Rome" (5 DLC)

Works with this repack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7406041/Crusader_Kings_2_v.1.06___Sword_of_Islam_DLC

If you have this repack installed, then the steps are next:

1. Download this DLC and patch.
2. Copy DLC in your DLC folder
3. Use Activation DLC just like in the repack (see it's page for instructions)
4. Copy "patch 1.07" contents to the game folder, overwrite when it asks.
5. Play!

Haven't tested it with another repacks, but these DLC work for SxSxl repack.
