,lazyget,2012-11-08T00:21Z,"This game crashes for me on the first level, right at the beginning(yes, after I've waited for the ridiculously long intro to finish!!!).

I've downloaded it from two different sources, burnt with two different DVD writers. Always with ImgBurn at slowest speed. I even tried different versions of ImgBurn but it don't wanna work. It crashes at the same point every time.

Anybody have the same issue? I don't generally have any issues burning anything else. It's just this game that happens to be a prickly one!!!"
