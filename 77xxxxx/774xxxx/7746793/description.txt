- Complete North America original Game Boy rom set. Also includes games that were only released in Europe. I renamed each game to match the official title name and also removed the GoodTools tags. (538 roms)


There are also five sub-folders within the file that contain extra roms...

- English Translations (15 roms): Complete or near complete translations of Japanese/European games.

- Hacks (1 roms): A few of the better rom hacks that have been released.
