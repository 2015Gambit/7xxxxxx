,moviekil,2012-10-21T16:15Z,"@chop007 dude ,, Do you get a hard on critizicing peoples torrents or you just a simple ignorant who just live digging the pirate bays torrents cause no one give you attention ? you and the other monkey AlphaOmega are in the same fuckin mission of calling ppl's torrents shit and even spreading ies about the uploaders.. both of you need to get banned from the pirate bay since you and the other monkey dont contributed with anything but your critics and your shitty comments of lies.. leave this uploader alone ,,at least he is giving something, sharing some work,, instead chop007 is just spreading dhiarreas all over the pirate bay"

,extracube,2012-10-22T09:58Z,Thank you bambunavi.  Older software is welcome too.  Some people collect it.  Other people sometimes need it.
,repayfriendship,2012-10-31T17:17Z,"Jesus Christ!  Well, I am not really into pirating, however, I do find the torrents useful as a backup.  I had like 2 original Microsoft Windows 95 discs and threw them out.  So, I do have a license for two at least..  it is just nice to know I can always get back what is in the trash."
,corefonts,2012-11-03T22:49Z,"Can't buy me new - Windows 95 any - more! 

Good! 
Someone still knows, uploads, downloads, uses Windows 95. 
My thanks and respect! "
