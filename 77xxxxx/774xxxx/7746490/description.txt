The Mike Grove Project was a fun catchy rock band, formed in the winter of 2008/2009 consisting of Chris Sakiadis from What?on lead vocals and guitar, Chad Gibson on bass, and Mike Grove on drums. (Both were from The Damage) They were only around long enough to play one show and record one hell of an album that will get you bouncing off your feet.
