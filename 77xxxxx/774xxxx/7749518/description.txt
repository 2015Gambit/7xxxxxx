Synopsis
---------
Trooper the Bloodhound is a slow talking, slow walking natural-born sleuth, devoted
to his "human", 10 year-old Tommy. Trooper, Tommy and their family have just moved
to a new town, but they soon discover it's a small town with a mysterious legend...
a legend of a Golden Key that could be worth one million dollars! While Tommy
delivers newspapers, Trooper sniffs out clues, helped by his new doggie pal,
Dash...the mischievous and ever energetic little pup. With each new discovery the
mystery deepens, and now danger is headed their way! Will Tommy and Trooper be
able to unlock the Legend of the Golden Key before it's too late? Will Trooper be
able to save Picklebees? One thing's for sure...With Trooper the Bloodhound on the
case, things are bound to get interesting.
