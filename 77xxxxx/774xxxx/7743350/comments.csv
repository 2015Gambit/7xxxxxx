NO comments about the quality, and NO sample.

Thank you very little."
,arslanistic,2012-10-19T23:59Z,someone plz share a screenshot of this
,sarcastos,2012-10-20T05:39Z,"Ya i know, 2 comments and not one about how the quality is or a screenshot. Seems like something one of them could have done instead of acting like the world revolves around them and they matter."

,Kanegasi,2012-10-21T05:43Z,Same shitty source. Thanks for getting my hopes up.
,michaelrwatson,2012-10-27T23:05Z,"So TvTeam *and* scenebalance BOTH uploaded mislabeled files, i.e. TS misrepresented as DVD..? That's hard to believe. There should be no confusing a DVD and a cam/ts."
,jfernd88,2012-10-29T17:00Z,does anyone know when this movie will available to download but in blue ray ?

,upx3,2012-11-03T23:09Z,"Attn Pirate Bay Admin:
Uploaders who mislabel Cam or TS as R*, should have their Trusted or VIP status revoked. 
This includes mislabeled RC as BluRay (retail release) rip.
It only takes seconds to check BEFORE uploading, there's no excuse.
Isn't that the reason that there's a Trusted or VIP status ?"
