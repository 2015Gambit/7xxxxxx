Your other upload of this has been deleted."
,lukescoot,2012-10-19T22:16Z,"Sorry Mr. Velvet, the reason for the 2nd upload was because I had done the names of the torrent and the file itself wrong, and I wasnt getting any hits. So I redid the torrent and re-uploaded. I thought however that I deleted the original. I tried to anyways, but never got actual confirmation of the delete. I will make sure I get things right the first time from now on. Thank you for bearing with me."
