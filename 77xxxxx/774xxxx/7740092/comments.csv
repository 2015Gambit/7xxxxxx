Sorry this is not a comment about this movie, Its a great movie though :-)

I just dont know where to start looking. 
I am looking for the movie ""Little Fauss and  big Halsy"", 1970 (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065989/)
There is an upload in torrrents, but its 425 mb avi, pretty bad quality, as it would be.
Since this movie is from same time I was hoping someone who reads this by coincident had access to the movie mentioned. Its a classic, Robert Redford plays the role to superbness, and I think it deserves to be accessible to more people :-)
If you dont have it, but have an idea where and who I could talk to, or a forum or something like that, it would be great as well of course. 
Thanks in advance"
