ItΓÇÖs been four years since Dutch-born electronic musician/producer Tom Holkenborg (AKA Junkie XL) put out an album, but heΓÇÖs been keeping himself very busy. Since 2008ΓÇ▓s Booming Back At You, Holkenborg has done production work for the likes of Madonna, Coldplay, Robert Smith, and Rammstein, contributed new music to EA video games The Sims 3, DOA: Dead or Alive, and Kingdom of Heaven, and worked with film composer extraordinaire Hans Zimmerman on films like Inception, Madagascar 3, and, yes, The Dark Knight Rises. Yet somehow, Holkenborg still set aside enough time to complete work on his sixth full-length, Synthesized, and has it ready for a November 27th release via Nettwerk Records.
