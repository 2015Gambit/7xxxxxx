[T],deepstatus,2012-10-19T21:39Z,"
     *Note - At the beguining of the installation, if the instaler gives the 
installation folder in C/program files/common files i recomend that you change 
to c/program files/"
[V],bigbluesea,2012-10-19T21:50Z,"@kylminator

Check"" C/program files/common files""

or run a search for the app installation folder.It might have installed it somewhere else"
[V],bigbluesea,2012-10-19T21:52Z,Thanx psydeep  for the up 
[T],deepstatus,2012-10-20T01:24Z,welcome and thankz for the help!! ;)
,numapompiliano,2012-10-20T12:58Z,"i follow the instructions... but when i tried to use ableton 8.4b 64 bit, the autorizelive opens ableton 8.3.4 32 bit!
or in same case it opens ableton 8.4 but it doesn't recognize the authorizelive as valid.
this crack is valid or is a fail?! cuz i didn't find any crack on internet.
HELP!!!!"
[T],deepstatus,2012-10-21T02:44Z,"numapompiliano do you know that 64bit is beta and needs the suite to work?
why so angry if suite works on 64bit?

anyway drag and drop the auz file in 64bit beta

open'it and drag there the auz file

thankz!!"
,yudodis,2012-10-23T00:42Z,Great torrent! Love how you can upload straight to Soundcloud in this version! THANKS :D
,jorgevg123,2012-10-23T02:07Z,"Hey @psydeep
so does this works in win 7 x64? "
[T],deepstatus,2012-10-23T13:42Z,"jorgevg123  it seams that some people cant...

i'm trying here with some tools to fix that....

but the thing is that i have tryed in 2 diferent x64 pc's and workzz

but it seams others not... so i dont know really what is the issue.. in the dark...."
,snypurr,2012-10-23T23:54Z,"Hey psydeep,

First of all, thanks for the upload. 

Second, I'm having some problems with getting this to work.

My ideal ableton live edition in this torrent was the x64 version so I could run the NI Massive VST into it. 

I got the installation of the suite done first, then I installed the beta for x64. 

The only problem here is that seeing as how the x64 version of ableton is a different program, the .auz wasn't going to be taken.

I tried opening the x64 ableton WITH the auz file and everything else I should have tried, but all I get is a box that says ""This authorization file is invalid on this computer"".

I've included an image to show you what I'm talking about.

Please help me out, thanks man. I'm sure you know what to do.

,pIZza17911,2012-10-24T13:03Z,"I have a problem as soon as I unrar, I use winrar and everything but when I try to open the .exe it comes up with an error message 'A serious program error has occured. Live will close when this meesage box is closed' or something along those lines. I have a high operating Window 7 x64bit."
,walewacker,2012-10-25T05:14Z,"ok so i am running windows 7 home premium 64 bit

i dont understand the directions. which of the three do i install, and where do i move the crack to??
sorry im a noob at this"
,Jack0ff,2012-10-25T05:43Z,"your torrent sucks dick for these reasons:

1. the x64 versions are not cracked (patcher only works on x86)
2. easier to d/l the suite from official site and apply generic patcher
3. youre also lame cause no credits to rrtn...fags like you include nfos with only your bullshit web or whatever in them and remove proper credits

PS. as proof read the ableton live credits to the end ;)"
[T],deepstatus,2012-10-25T15:27Z,"Jack0ff were it says its cracked by me?

were it says that is patched?

were rrtn released a crarck for this version
maybe are some changes that you never undertand...

and by the way the torrent is fast then dl from autor site!

not everyone whants to give his/her ip to the autor also

so change your nick to Piss0ff

for the others i'm still working on the hex to manage a working crack for beta x64

"
,Jack0ff,2012-10-25T17:42Z,"ok let me answer this shit in order:
it doesnt say anything but your tag everywhere
my proof that its patched is the credit tag, not to mention the patched bytes are identical.
it has just been patched by rrtn generic patcher, thats it, nothing more. SO i DO UNDERSTAND SHITHEAD!
ok, you are right on the torrent speed
right on the ip scare. however who is scared of d/l a free trial, geez, really?
i cant change my name to Piss0ff, although that is funny :)
you aint patching shit if you cant tell the files you have are the same as the generically patched ones

PS. and you are clearly a dumbfuck cause you used 'were' instead of 'where' in every sentence. whered you go to school fucktard?"
[T],deepstatus,2012-10-25T20:48Z,ok!! was you wish!! lets see!!
,Attreyu65,2012-10-26T21:43Z,"So, this is a clusterfuck and the instructions are written by an idiot.

First of all, you need to install the ableton_suite__834.msi file. NOT the betas.

Then, it will not ask to install in Program Files, but in ProgramData. So change to Program FilesAbletonAbleton 8 Live.

Then, after you have installed it, copy the crack and the authorize files. Double click the authorize file and only then start the program.

If you try to install first the suite, and then the beta, it will install them in two different folders and the authorization file only works for the beta install.

More, the suite is the 8.3.4 version while the beta is 8.4.b8.

,psiloc1n,2012-10-27T07:01Z,"Jeez why does virtually every comment section on this website decay into childish flaming and irreverent self-proclamations of competency vs. incompetency....?

Makes one wonder, how we could have so many resolutions to these periodic vexations, should there be a little more love and cooperation...

But I guess pirates will be pirates.

I just desperately want this 64 bit beta for Live to work. the 32 is so limiting; why do i have 16gb of RAM if i can only use a quarter of it? and the beta has been taken down from Ableton's website, it seems....

Attreyu, I am sorry but your instructions provide very little clarification. Have you successfully run the 64 bit version of the software?

I am not talking about simply making the Live Suite work on a x64 machine...

What confuses me about your directions is the lack of explanation for the beta installers. How is it exactly that the Auth file works for only the beta, if you install the suite first then the beta? The auth file doesn't seem to work, at alllll, for the beta."
,snypurr,2012-10-27T19:55Z,"@Attreyu65 

So, I've redone it again for the 5th time and after double clicking the .auz, it only authorized the 32-bit version. Upon launching the beta, it says it isn't authorized."
,snypurr,2012-10-27T19:56Z,"Correction, sorry.

I launch the beta application and it still opens the 32-bit."
,snypurr,2012-10-27T20:11Z,"If you guys are looking for the x64 version of ableton, (8.4b8), you wont get it from this torrent. You need to wait I guess."
,jorgevg123,2012-10-30T06:53Z,"@psydeep

thanks, i downloaded it and worked just fine the first days... after about 3 days the midi tracks were just randomly recieving no input at all.. i could see the flashing signal of the pc recieving it, but misteriously the track didnd recieved anything or output anything... i tried everything and the problem just got worse
anyone has a solution to this?"
,jorgevg123,2012-10-30T06:55Z,"by it i mean the midi from my computer keyboard :)

please heelppp!!"
,borce,2012-10-30T14:45Z,"@jorgevg123  - that is not from the crack not being good, but from you not using Ableton properly. rtfm.

For those of you still waiting for Live 8.4b8 x64, forget it, that version was scraped from the 8 dev tree and promoted in the Live 9 dev tree.  That codebase will be the first Live 9 version (which is already out)"
,Willsolo1,2012-11-08T11:53Z,Does this work with Windows 8?  :D
,taelor_Z,2012-11-14T23:15Z,...(:< спасибо >:)...
,biglelic,2012-11-20T05:53Z,"Useless instructions but I got it working on Win8 64-bit.

1. Extract files
2. Double-click file: ableton_suite__834
3. App files will be automatically stored to C:ProgramDataAbleton
4. Copy all the crack files and save in here C:ProgramDataAbletonLive 8Program
5. Double-click on Authorizelive8.auz file.
6. Ableton app will open, authorize (must be connected to internet) and prompt you to download a bunch of missing files: Lessons, Library, Demo, Additional Content, etc.
7. Skip the upgrade to 8.4 beta.
8. Done"
