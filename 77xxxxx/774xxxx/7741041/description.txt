features in Live 8 plus sound, with a radically new Library packed with 
beautiful new sounds and a wealth of useful resources. Suite 8 contains 11 
Ableton instruments and effects including synths, a sampler, electric and 
acoustic drums, mallets, numerous sampled instruments, the new, reworked 
Operator and amp modeling effects. Two completely new instruments, Collision and 
Latin Percussion, round off the set. Ableton Suite 8 is a complete package: the 
tools and the sounds.



8.3.4 Release Notes
Improvements and feature changes:

    The word size of the Live application is now shown in the splash screen.
    Live is now showing the email address of the currently authorized user 
account in the "About" window.
    Improved the authorization dialogue when launching Live as a Trial version.

Bugfixes:

    Fixed a bug which could cause a "memory corruption error" when launching 
Live.
    Fixed a memory leak which could occur when using the "Complex" warp mode. 
    The Session View selection frame of the APC40 or Launchpad could get stuck 
after deleting scenes or undoing the creation of scenes.
    Live device parameters would no longer update correctly after deleting a Max 
for Live device which was mapped to that parameter via live.remote~.
    Fixed a problem with the Max for Live engine, which would cause Live to 
freeze when setting an audio buffer size smaller than 21 samples.
    Fixed a graphical glitch in the Session- / Arrangement View amoeba after 
toggling views (mixer, crossfader, etc.). 
    Fixed a problem with the Windows installer which could lead to an incomplete 
installation on some computers. Symptom: The Live application would not launch 
at all and an error message "The application has failed to start due to a side-
by-side configuration error" would be shown instead.
    Under certain conditions, the playback position in audio clips was incorrect 
after changing clip start markers in unwarped clips and then re-enabling 'warp'. 
    Fixed a bug which prevented some VST plugins stored in the OS X system 
library folder to show up in Live's browser.
