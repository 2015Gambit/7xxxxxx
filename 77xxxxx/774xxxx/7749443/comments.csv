I had to spend 4 and half hours to convert the english subtitle into an srt file, THE WORST AND LOUSIEST subtitle file I've seen in my life.

This upload has no subtitles, check the files.

You've posted the same moronic and deceitful message on three totally different torrents, when the fact is, you're an idiot."
