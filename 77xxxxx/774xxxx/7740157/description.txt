HereΓÇÖs the next snapshot, 12w42b! We are pushing these very rapidly now because we need to get ready for the 1.4 pre-release (which needs to be out before the official release on October 24). Since yesterdayΓÇÖs snapshot weΓÇÖve doneΓÇª

1.Falling sand now properly ΓÇ£popsΓÇ¥ when falling on non-solid blocks (such as torches)
2.The redstone repeater lock mechanism is now slightly more stable / predictable. ItΓÇÖs still not 100% as we want it, but fixing it completely will require bigger changes that weΓÇÖve planned for Minecraft 1.5.
3.Fixed tooltip width for renamed items
4.Added a number of sound events, but the sound effects are not added yet
5.Server ping will now tell if the server and client have mismatching protocol versions
6.Updated translation files
