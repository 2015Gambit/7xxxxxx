VIDEO
I have worked to find and use the "best" avisynth technology on the DVD source, and applied the strongest denoising/sharpening that wouldn't 

remove any noticable precision (and obv. thanx to high quality x264 encoding not loose anything noticeable there too).
I think the result is NICER to MOST eyes than the DVD ! Download the sample if you don't believe me.
Anyway, as far as compressed version go, it's the best you'll find around, the reasson being that I wouldn't have bothered making another release if 

the offer was satisfying.
