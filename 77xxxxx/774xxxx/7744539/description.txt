Zameer Ke Bande|1978|Anand Patwardhan Documentary|Xvid|MP3|Phantom

Zameer Ke Bande aka Prisoners of Conscience is an important historical record of a traumatic period in India's recent political history as it focuses on the State of Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi from June 1975 to March 1977.

During the Emergency the media was muzzled, over 100,000 people were arrested without charge and imprisoned without trial. But political prisoners existed before the Emergency, and they continue to exist even after it is over.

Through first hand accounts, the director presents details of the appalling brutality of prison procedures and the classism that permeates them. PatwardhanΓÇÖs major lament is not against IndiraΓÇÖs policies per se, but the very act of holding political prisoners without trial (That the film clearly points out that the situation did not improve much even after Janata Dal came to power testifies to its ΓÇ£nonpartisanΓÇ¥ quality). What was unique about the widespread resistance to this political ploy of Indira Gandhi was that it was highly democratic in nature, with participation by both the secular Left and the Hindu-based RSS (a marriage quite unimaginable now), both workers and students, both citizens and immigrants and both radical Maoists and nonviolent Gandhians. Using the various interviews of people from each of these groups, Patwardhan attempts to examine and evaluate his own political leaning by trying to uncover socialist strains in Gandhian philosophy and the possibility of having a nonviolent base for Marxist thought
