,fernflitch,2012-10-21T19:23Z,"Spock, your comics uploads are the best I've seen since demonoid went away & better than most even before then. Thanks!

But there's a defect in this one: page 52 (image a048, a049) appears twice, page 53 is missing."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-22T05:42Z,"fernflitch, seriously, thank you for that kind compliment. And you're most welcome.

Also &#(*$* R$%#)E$( @(*() %R_#($W#)+_@0 and @(*R$. 

I've worked 30 hours since Friday and I'm beat down fully right now. I'll fix it and re-up tomorrow. Thanks for letting me know."
,fernflitch,2012-10-22T06:02Z,"Okey dokey. But hey, when you're rested, you could just post a torrent with the missing page -- it's no trouble just to replace the current wrong image with the correct one. Or for folks who don't know how to edit the cbr, post the corrected file and a separate image file of p. 53 in the same torrent ... I'd like to avoid dling the whole thing again if possible.

And don't get upset about the mistake! When I make scanned books I can spend hours over a project only to discover weeks later that I screwed up something basic. It happens.

By the way, have you ever tried Scantailor to fix up some of these comics files? It can do wonders with scanned pages -- deskewing, setting consistent margins, removing gray gutter shadows, etc. (For it to work with a book like this, though, you'd need to process the double-page images separately from the single-page images: Scantailor imposes a consistent page size on all the images in a project.)"
