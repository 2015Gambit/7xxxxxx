Surprising, but not overly annoying - but it is yet another defect by LOL / DIMENSION"

I almost always comment on shows I inspect from LOL / DIMENSION - see:

Once.Upon.a.Time.S02E04

From the very same night. Which you damn well know. I post on the first instance of LOL & DIMENSION. This is no reflection on you personally (except you don't inspect for damaged goods yourself).

If you don't want a bad review, stop posting Grossly Pixelated crap.

XOR used to post damaged goods - then XOR went away and then all was good.

As long as LOL posts damaged goods, I'll keep commenting on it. People should have this information before they commit to downloading it. You got a reason to keep people in the dark about the quality of your posts?

So, LOL should stop posting pixelated crap or LOL should stop posting altogether.

Until then, I'm on a mission from God (Blues Bros Quote).

p.s. - When you tell lies about my encodes, people will think very much the less of you. My reputation is secured by the files I post - as is yours."
