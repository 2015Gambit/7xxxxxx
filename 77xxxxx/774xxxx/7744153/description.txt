The Avengers (2012) with the director's (Joss Whedon's) commentary. Put together from YIFY BRrip and director commentary from some guy on 4chan. For all the folks from the world who didn't get it with their Blu Ray ;)


The commentary is in .ogg; just play it with VLC, it will work. The original (English) track is also included in the mkv.


The commentary is few milliseconds off in the beginning (before the main title), I am too lazy to fix that since it doesn't really matter, it is OK after the main title.
