the ones i need seeding on are as follows
The Reckoning
Sour Annie
Daughter of the Sioux"
[V],TheExecutive,2012-10-24T03:13Z,"Hey Ajax,

I don't save the files after I'm done seeding them since I have the DVD set.  But someone I know
might be able to help....if he still has his copies, which he burns to his own DVDs."
[T],ajaxen94,2012-10-24T11:46Z,Hi exec thank you for getting back to me so quick and also thank your friend for me even if he cannot help i much appreciate your help in trying and also if he can help does he have the missing episodes....West of Boston & High Bridge sorry for being such a nuisance but we don't get most of these old western shows here in the UK and my husband loves them
[V],TheExecutive,2012-10-25T05:54Z,"We don't get most of those old westerns here in the U.S unless we susscribe to Encore Westerns channel ( I used to a long time ago ) or buy the DVDs.

My friend didn't save his Mp4 copies of any of the episodes. Sorry.  I don't have time to do them again."
[T],ajaxen94,2012-10-25T18:09Z,"thank you for getting back to me and thank you for trying, anyway i shall still enjoy the doz episodes i downloaded i have been trying to find the DVDs here in the UK might possibly have found somewhere i can purchase them. old western series are very hard to come by over here i usually get most from sky tv on the TCM channel but we havn't got much selsction and they just keep repeating the same ones over"
,pooket,2012-11-04T02:04Z,"Hey Exec,
It looks like you've wasted a hell of a lot of time and energy on your Kojak torrents because almost all of them are dead, and it's only been a couple weeks.  What a shame..."
[V],TheExecutive,2012-11-05T03:31Z,"Just happened to come back to visit and saw your comment, Pooket.   Yes it is a shame but 
that's how it is with torrents when you don't rent a seedbox....."
,pooket,2012-11-06T01:25Z,"Sorry, dude, but I have to disagree about the seedbox.  I have many torrents still alive after years, and I never used a seedbox. The way I see it, there are two potential problems.

1) Kojak fans on TPB are low-life vermin.
2) You didn't seed your ratio high enough when you originally uploaded these.

Oh well, thanks anyway."
