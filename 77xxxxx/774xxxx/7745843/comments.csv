,namco-nexgen,2012-10-20T20:50Z,Yeah i know. Even if i did test it i would like some feedback if it does work.
,deves1,2012-10-20T22:22Z,"Tried out aircraft. Doesnt look like it works. Tried it with and without DX10 and textures are missing. You can see the panel and the gauges work ect, but missing fuselage. Thank for trying. Thanks for uploading . Back to the Drawing board."
,easkidie,2012-10-20T22:22Z,Does not work. No exterior and panel missing.
,victordallaqua,2012-10-20T22:23Z,"hey guy, i make the download but it is transparent
please upload the Executable arquive and your serial name and number "
,mcbiel,2012-10-20T22:36Z,"Its not working.

I can see through the dashboard and Its all skeleton."
,Crash2701,2012-10-20T22:42Z,"@ victordallaqua:

Aren't you a cute little Troll!!!"
,namco-nexgen,2012-10-20T23:21Z,"Oh well. I guess the uninstaller didn't remove something required for it to work, so the RIP still worked here.

It will require patching and that i cannot do. Thanks for trying and i'm sorry it didn't work."
,victordallaqua,2012-10-20T23:54Z,"I'm serious @ crash2701
the cessna 182 had the same problem, and when did upload the executable and put the serials, back in service "
,namco-nexgen,2012-10-21T01:36Z,"I know about that, if it could be done, it would have been done already."
,fsxking08,2012-10-21T05:36Z,"I dont know if it would work, but if you have another drive, make a folder called Microsoft Games, then in that folder make the Microsoft Flight Simulator X folder, and then in that make a folder with the exact name (capitals, spacing and all) for every folder in the default FSX folder, and then run the auto installer into that one, and then copy every new file into a new torrent and see if that works, because you didnt copy every single file, so doing that you just open up every folder and every file that was installed you copy that way you can find the files you missed"
,namco-nexgen,2012-10-21T10:58Z,"I just tried that and copied it into a ""clean"" FSX and it doesn't work. Installation is customized and i can't find what it is on registry and windows system.

Useless torrent, it can be deleted."
,flobro1,2012-10-21T14:49Z,"Hello there.
Where have gone the all time helpers and star providers like ""aarque"" "" SnakEye"" ""xxtsh"" ""mickyfinny"" or other respectful ""anonymous"" ????
We miss you."
,PierreB24,2012-10-21T20:53Z,"Please upload the proper installation file, the carenado aircraft never work if its a rip"
,fsxking08,2012-10-22T04:49Z,"Alright then what you'll have to do is try to find every single file installed by the auto installer, that measn check every single folder, thats about all I can think of doing"
,Crash2701,2012-10-22T14:12Z,"Get a program called ""Uninstall Tool"". Among other useful things, it has a 'Install Tracker', which tracks an Installer and logs every file it writes anywhere on your pc, including registry files. See here for more details: http://www.crystalidea.com/install-tracker-installation-monitor.
I use it all the time and making a RIP now is as easy as 1-2-3."
,captray,2012-10-22T19:20Z,Great suggestion Crash2701 - hopefully it will work. Let me take this opportunity for a few requests: Milviz B55 and Turbine Duke v1.2 patch (latest). Thanks!
,namco-nexgen,2012-10-22T19:50Z,"Will try that, see if i make this torrent useful :P

Thank you."
,PierreB24,2012-10-22T20:26Z,How about just uploading the installation file... Like all the others have.. Rips never work! 
,FritzFredl,2012-10-22T23:46Z,"One or both of the .MDL files is corrupted or damaged. If the uploader would re-upload those two files (From the Model folder), it might work."
,ofb,2012-10-24T04:05Z,"same problem here..doesn't work, something missing, panel and fuselage missing, plus doesn't fly correctly.."
,fsxking08,2012-10-24T06:08Z,"To the people who are asking for the serials and shit, he cant, he has a limited # of serial installs, the reason other crackers serials works is because they cracked the installer (called cracking) so that the serials arent logged and you get an unlimited #, he hasnt cracked it yet, so he cant do that.

To the people saying the torrent is bad, its because its a RIP, which means no cracking, all you do is copy over the files, like he has here, the reason it doesnt work is because carenado is smart and made it really hard to RIP their stuff because they hide the most needed files somewhere, so please stop complaining"
,N109GE,2012-10-24T13:59Z,"@fsxking08 ,

Thank you for your rational on this topic...it makes perfect sense.   I agree, stop the complaining....  Okay, so Carenado has gotten just a bit smarter in hiding or (scattering) the required files.  I presume that are there (meaning in the download), so what or how would you suggest finding them or go about it...?

Again, thank you for your knowledge on this topic..."
,hitchup,2012-10-24T18:01Z,"@namco-nexgen

Give some mail to send you something."
,namco-nexgen,2012-10-25T11:13Z,"Thanks everyone. I cannot upload the .EXE right now because BayImg is down and it's giving me an error when i submit the torrent file.

As for the email, it's the first part of my nickname at netc.pt"
,Rolecram,2012-10-25T15:51Z,"namco-NexGen, inserts in 4shared, you can."
,hitchup,2012-10-26T14:49Z,"@namco-nexgen
- check your mail."
,namco-nexgen,2012-10-26T15:35Z,"All the people sending me emails, you STILL didn't understand, did you?

The files are personalized during installation with the provided serial number. A RIP just won't work no matter what. I will upload the original EXE once it's possible for someone to try and crack it, but i cannot provide the (my) serial number."
,teekster,2012-10-26T16:53Z,Kindly Requesting: Hawker 800XP aircraft from Justflight
,robk182,2012-10-26T16:58Z,Upload de EXE ande them.. someone will crack the exe!! but .. do it.. upload.. 
,N109GE,2012-10-27T00:05Z,"@namco-nexgen,

I apologize for sending you and Email on this.  If I knew how to ""help"", I would be the first one to lend a hand....

Thank you for trying......  : ) 

PS.I would not give out ANY serial numbers that could trace back to me either.  I agree with you."
,N109GE,2012-10-27T00:07Z,"@hitchup,

 do I go about Emailing you about the B200.../"
,Mach_One,2012-10-27T18:50Z,so before I download this...Does it work or not????
,N109GE,2012-10-27T19:11Z,"@Mach_One ,

It does NOT work...!"

,hitchup,2012-10-30T11:26Z, My previous comment was an example of where the files are located.
,N109GE,2012-11-04T00:01Z,"Hitchup,

What are you showing with the link from Photobucket?  "
,hitchup,2012-11-05T14:11Z,The picture shows where the files are and where changes in the register after the installation.As an example C337H Skymaster.
,N109GE,2012-11-05T23:14Z,"@Hitchup,

First off thanks for this information.  I am going to try a figure this out, Okay, I know how to find the Carenado folder in FSX.

As far as the registery database goes, thats were I get messed up. I am not sure as to what I need to change.

Do I find ""Estor"" and look for REG_SZ and change it to REG_2...?  As far as the (does not exist), do I need a displayname?

Sorry to be a pain but I am confused...

Thanks.
