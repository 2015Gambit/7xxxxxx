,somestuff,2012-10-21T16:43Z,"Thanks!
After tinkering around with the Windows 7 KMS, I was finally able to activate both Win 8 Pro & Enterprise with it.  There is no manual with this and you have to kinda use trial and error meathod before getting it to work.  I was also able to set it up using a no-ip link to my IP no.  and port forward 1688 through my router, then go off site to another location and activate from there too.  So, in my opinion, this really works for now.  Interested to see how long this thing continues to work.  By the way, it also activates win 7 Pro and Enterprise."
,ROCKnTIME,2012-10-21T20:30Z,"@473577249,

Thanks man..Great post.. As somestuff pointed out it has to be tweaked but it does work 100%.. "
,ROCKnTIME,2012-10-21T21:56Z,"Corrected & Tweaked info::

• Install VMPlayer
• Unpack Windows.7.KMS.rar
• Open Windows 7 KMS.vmlk in VMPlayer from extracted rar. Be sure to answer the question ""Moved VMWare"" Important to work!!!!!
• Wait for the KMS server window to open on the virtual drive
• Open command prompt on the KMS virtual drive and type ""ipconfig /all"" to find your servers ip address. No quotes! Important to work!!!

Now on the computer that needs to be activated..

• If your copy of Windows 8 is Professional, then you need to change the key using command prompt as administrator...
• If your copy of Windows 8 is Enterprise - NO key changes are necessary so used step two.
• This KMS server will not activate Windows Professional WMC so your SOL..
• To activate Windows 8 execute the following commands using command prompt as administrator Important to work!!


slmgr / ipk NG4HW VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4  (note.. ONLY Run this command for Windows 8 Professional) wait for confirmation
slmgr -skms IpAddress:1688  (note.. substitute Ip Address with your servers Ip address (example slmgr -skms 192.168.1.1:1688) wait for confirmation
slmgr -ato   (note.. this command activates Windows 8) wait for confirmation
slmgr /dlv   (note.. this command visually shows if your activated)"
