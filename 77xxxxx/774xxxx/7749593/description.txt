HAVE YOU BEEN BANNED FROM THE NEXUS FORUMS? 
NOW YOU CAN'T USE THE MOD MANAGER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LOGIN? 
NO WORRIES! HERE IS A CRACKED VERSION FOR YOU!

Or maybe you just want your privacy.

This cracked Mod Manager will not force you to log in. 
UPDATE: HOORAH!! NEXUS SITE SAW THAT I HAVE CRACKED THIS AND GOTTEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOWNLOADS, STOLEN FROM THEM! THEY SEE THAT EVEN BANNED MEMBERS STILL HAVE ACCESS, SO THEY LOSE THEIR POWER!! THEY HAVE SUBMITTED TO US!! NOW THERE IS AN "OFFLINE MODE" IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CRACK IT!!!

However, seeing as the following things, you still do want to crack it:
1) They still do not let members who are banned be able to download mods. So we must use the cracked version to defy them until they submit futher!
2) If you are banned from the Nexus site, you still have to login to download! This means you can't get new versions if you are banned! Scum.

BUT HOORAY FOR THE FIRST GREAT VICTORY OVER THE NEXUS MODS SITE!! LET'S CONTINUE TO DEFY THE SELF-DECLARED NEXUS LORDS AND REMOVE THEM FROM THEIR FALSE THRONE!!! LET'S FORCE THEM TO SUBMIT TO US FURTHER!!!
