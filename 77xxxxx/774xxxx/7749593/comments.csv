,mrm82,2012-10-23T21:19Z,"how do I update cracked nmm 0.21 to cracked nmm 0.32.1 ....,I tried it once from crkd nmm 0.19 to crkd nmm 0.21 and had to install all of my mods, one at a time, it took a long time, so is there a easier way to do it"
,mrm82,2012-10-23T21:20Z,help me ! please
,-xbt-,2012-10-25T09:50Z,"Yes, all you have to do is extract the mods into the mods folder. Then restart the mod manager, and activate the mods you want. You don't ever have to use the ""Install"" feature. "
,mrm82,2012-10-30T21:35Z,"thanks, it's that simple"
,Iridescent,2012-11-08T17:14Z,"You can already start Nexus Manager in offline mode. What does this thing really do? You can't update your mods or use it to download mods or check what the current version is, so there's literally no point to whatever this is... unless it's MALWARE. I'd be extremely cautious about trusting this download."
,PoHeniXxx,2012-11-11T16:32Z,"I dont get it, why don't you ppl use the non-cracked  version of nexus mod manager ????? All you need is a nexus account..., which is 100% free "
,PoHeniXxx,2012-11-11T16:44Z,"And BTW 

""NEXUS SITE SAW THAT I HAVE CRACKED THIS AND GOTTEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOWNLOADS, STOLEN FROM THEM!""  

Really??? 
Stolen??? 

Wtf are u doing here?, all the mods are free, anyone can make an account, download, upload mods, use the forum etc... and if u were banned, then blame yourself (you can make a new account tho, they don't ban based on ip address), nexus is a honest and fair site, so you should stfu "
