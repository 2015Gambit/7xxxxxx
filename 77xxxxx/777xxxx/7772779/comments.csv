,BlaTaN,2012-10-30T06:00Z,"281 supposed seeders,  yet only getting 20 kbps,  whats the point of uploading something so quickly, if it takes the rest of the day to download?

To many selfish pricks leeching ...... these ppl are the first to cry when the shit hits the fan though.... PATHETIC!"
,Trimputes,2012-10-30T06:15Z,"I'm getting 20-200kbs here. Leeching distills the amount of bandwidth to share, and the ratio according to TPB is 1:4 at the moment. That's why it's often so slow after upload. "
,obelisktorment,2012-10-30T08:15Z,Can everyone seed while they watch or something? I'm due in for a 20 hour wait at this slow download rate. Please seed.
