Time & Chaos is our award-winning contact manager and has been around now for twenty years! Our longevity is due to our mix of an easy to use but powerful address book of contacts, appointment schedule, to do task management and projects.

Time & Chaos 8 is a great choice if you need all the contact management but not the email features added to Intellect. Chaos 8 works great for individuals or shared workgroups on networks.
