An Infosec daily podcast featuring zzz, the lead developer of I2P.

I2P is an anonymous network, similar to tor except that it allows torrenting. All torrent downloads inside I2P are completely anonymous and cannot be connected to your ip. I2P is a java application and so will run on almost all operating systems. You can get more information and download I2P from geti2p.net.

To start anonymously downloading this torrent with I2P, start i2p then use your normal web browser to go to 127.0.0.1:7657/i2psnark. Copy and paste the magnet link into the box provided. Download speeds are slower than on the normal internet, but are completely untraceable. Please seed once you have finished, the more seeders the higher the speed is for everyone!

This torrent is healthy inside the I2p network but may not be seeded into the normal torrent ecosystem.
