||
||, Notes: HD4U used the AC3 core from the TrueHD audio stream core which is only 224k
|| Rules require high bitrate sources which can't be used in their original format
to be transcoded to a minimum bitrate of 640k. In this case the THD peak bitrate
is 1302k with an average of 1141k and should have been transcoded to a higher
bitrate than core
Our release uses ref 5 to "respect Level 4.1". The rules sadly lack when it comes
to ref in 1080p for FS sources. "vertical resolution is greater than 864, then 4
must be used to respect L4.1". That is true for WS sources however for FS sources
ref 5 is actually what "respects L4.1". Rules assume (wrongly) a constant horiziontal
resolution of 1920 which isn't valid for scene 1080p as the sides are cropped off
Under the current rules both are ok cause of the conflicting wording - ref 4 is specified
as well as "must respect L4.1"
A calculation Formula can be found in "high.definition.x264.standards.revision.3.1.addendum.1": ref = 12288 * 1024 / (vertical resolution * horizontal resolution * 1.5)
