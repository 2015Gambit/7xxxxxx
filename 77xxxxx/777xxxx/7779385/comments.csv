Damaged source - LOL / DIMENSION / re-encoders
Grossly Pixelated Error @ 15:54
Recommend waiting for the WEB-DL
=====================
Some people won't notice
Many people don't care
This is purely informational for the rest of you. Documented errors since MP4 began:
LOL=122 | ASAP=3 | 2HD=2 | COMPULSION=1 | LMAO=1
IMMERSE=1 | FOV=1 | YesTV=0 | EVOLVE=0 | TLA=0
BAJSKORV=0 | MOMENTUM=0 | FTP=0 | SYS=0
As Bogie said ""but look at the sheer number of them!"""

""Recommend waiting for the WEB-DL""

You would be waiting for a while since WEB DL isn't doing season 14. They've only done season 1, 7, and some of 13."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-01T19:37Z,"""fine"" is a relative term. And it might take some time, they're pretty slow at it. Still waiting for 1405

But I've gotten undamaged ""NBCsrc"" files for eps 1-4. WEB-DL is pretty much a generic term to me. As long as it's NOT LOL, it's likely to be undamaged.

Any chance LOL will begin putting out undamaged versions any time soon? Any idea why LOL / DIMENSION are the only ones from ""The Scene"" consistently putting out these damaged files?

You may be ""fine"" with the Gross Pixalation Errors, but some are not.

,ShepardRahl,2012-11-02T08:49Z,"Wow! You really tried to spin your way out of that one didn't you.

The ""gross pixilation error"" is not the issue. It's your lying about it like it's a file breaker. Which it is not. "
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-14T08:17Z,"Way back in the vinyl days, I had a friend that could not tolerate the slightest tic or pop that everyone else didn't mind.

There are people who swear that MP3 isn't good enough and demand FLAC.

My information is for those who cannot (or choose not) to tolerate such damage to the file.

Nobody said the file was broken - it's just not the quality that ""The Scene"" pretends to and uses as sole justification for switching to MP4.

More information is better and I stand by my reports being factual. What anyone does with the information is up to them.

Again, the real question is:

Why don't you want people to see this info? Afraid someone will notice your emperor is sans clothing?
