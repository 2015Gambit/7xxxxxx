so sad to hear the news :(

can you at least please tell us where else we can download project runway australia? the australian torrent site requires to be a vip member.  i searched far and wide and you're the only source i can find..."
,Fuzi0719,2012-11-04T14:05Z,"Oh no, we won't get any more PR-AUS?  Sadness :-(  I've really appreciated rkstr's work in uploading these."
[T],rkstr,2012-11-04T20:42Z,"People in paid jobs get to have a vacation.I don't get paid for this (in fact it costs me money) and I need to have a break, its not fun for me anymore -its a chore -  and I have to step away from it for a while"
,AaarMatey,2012-11-06T00:53Z,"What?  Aw, man!  If I had access to Australian TV I'd finally be willing to throw me sword into battle for more Project Runway AU. Instead I'm only a scurvy 2.0 ratio leech... Is there nothing that might tempt you to continue?!"
,saffronsghost,2012-11-07T07:54Z,"Can't you tell us where you get them, rk?  :("
,AaarMatey,2012-11-08T16:32Z,"saffronsghost... They're from an Australian torrent site that charges you a monthly fee for access, downundertv dot net.  The ""downloaded from"" ad in this ep appeared when I watched it on my tv, but not when I looked for the time of the stamp in VLC.  Thanks again for sharing as much as you have, rkstr!"
