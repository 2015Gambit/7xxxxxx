,N0Drew,2012-10-30T22:33Z,"By the way, if at all possible, during the early days of this torrent, please download (and seed) ALL of this ASAP, rather than one episode at a time. Otherwise I may be the only one seeding later episodes for a long time. And I may get tired of it!

If folks will do this, I may be able to go ""initial seeding"" mode in order to push out a full copy faster.

Thanks."
