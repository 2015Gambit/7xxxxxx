"For more than two decades, chile peppers have ruled our lives.
While Paul has specialized in the horticultural aspects of the pungent
pods and breeding new varieties, Dave has focused on the food
history of chiles and their usage in international cooking. During this
time, we have witnessed an explosion of interest in chiles, fueled
mostly by the media. Chiles have evolved from being viewed as
something to avoid (ΓÇ£theyΓÇÖre all too hot!ΓÇ¥) to being considered a
necessity in the larder as people have learned about the different
varieties of chiles, their varied heat levels and flavor profiles, and their
ability to transform ordinary meals into spectacular ones."
