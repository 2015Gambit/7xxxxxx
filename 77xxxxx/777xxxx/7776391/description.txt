First download the game files

Next Unzip file with winrar or something similar, run the "steambackup2.exe" as Administrator and pick where you want it installed

Next go back and copy the contents of the "Crack" folder to where ever you installed the game

Crack Files Download: (Dead Island Crack Files Extractor) 

Now run "Dead Island Crack Files Extractor.exe" and click on UPDATE 1 and copy the contents of that directory to where you installed the game, repeat this for for the UPDATE 2

Copy "SmartSteam" and put it in your steam folder 

Now run Smartsteam and log in (i suggest making a new steam account and not using your own)

Go back to where you installed the game and run the "DeadIslandGame.exe" as Administrator (if you are running the game for the first and use 2 monitors please turn one off, WindowsKey + P and select just the one)

Once you get the game going just play through the prologue and after that hit "ESC" and you should see "gamelobby" in there, you can pick who you want to join. Remember you can only join players who are at the same chapter as you or those on a lower chapter, like if you are at chapter 5 you can play with players who are at anything from 1-5 but not anyone who is at 6 or above

UPDATE: You need to change the steam_appid.txt to 42510 as the old one no longer works, if you are playing with a friend make sure they change it to 42510 as well 
Right click on steam_appid.txt, Click Properties. Click read only then ok or apply

Done coop works
