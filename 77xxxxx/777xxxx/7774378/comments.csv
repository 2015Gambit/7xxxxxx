If you like this game you should really buy it. Squad are indy game devs and every dollar helps. 

I know their site sucks for downloading the paid version when it comes out, but they still work hard at the game.

We're downloading it since the patches is bloody broken."
,xebato,2012-10-31T05:07Z,"I wish i could but im fucking poor right now :D 
When i have more than 50$ in my bank account for once i will buy it "
,RdClZn,2012-11-01T01:25Z,"Yeah, I'm also broken...   Maybe I buy it mid-November, thou! Its a really great indie game and isnt even that expensive.

Thanks for the torrent."
,Warbuxx,2012-11-01T03:01Z,thanks man.
,davjet,2012-11-01T03:26Z,Can you upload mac?
,tenorsaxman52,2012-11-02T01:48Z,i have to  do this till they make a alternate way of paying for the game because paypal dosnt exept debit cards
,Narcaidas,2012-11-05T17:32Z,"@tenorsaxman52 I'm not sure if this is the case where you live, but in North America PayPal definitely lets you do that. Only catch is you need pretty much every ounce of your bank info to set it up properly."
,StupidCrows,2012-11-06T15:43Z,Does this include the hotfixes they released as well?
,arinbell,2012-11-09T03:53Z,"I bought the game. However, their downloading system(using patcher.exe to download full version) doesn't work at all."
,lords43,2012-11-12T13:06Z,If we had money to spend on games we wouldn't be on TPB
,Asmodinas,2012-11-17T11:41Z,"I would pay for it if it would be on Steam. 
Not that I don't trust the developers, but sending my money to someone on the internet that is not a big-ass corporation (which has a reputation and lots of money to lose) is just too fishy.
If KSP would come out on Steam, then I would have insurance and I would be able to play and download it even if the devs would abandon it (e.g. Terraria case)"
