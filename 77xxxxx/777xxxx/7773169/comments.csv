j/k"
,Oblivilot,2012-10-31T01:31Z,"""Never Say Never"" was regrettably excluded from the 50th Anniversary set for being a non-Eon production!..  So dumb, Kim Basinger was looking *so fine* in that film... I noticed an insanely oversized (43.2 gigs) up of it post recently, so I am hoping for something more manageable.. For what it's worth, here is that link:

,sickboy_xl,2012-11-04T19:05Z,"Look at the date is was uploaded people. October 30. It's a 55GB file. It takes a while to download and then reseed the entire thing. Calm the fuck down and be patient. If you want it today, go pay $200 for the thing!"

,AurelienS,2012-11-06T20:39Z,The description says the subtitles are English; I've downloaded Casino Royale et Quantum of Solace (took a couple of days) and there are no subtitles.
,-torrent-,2012-11-07T03:38Z,"just so everyone knows, once i get this downloaded, ill let it seed for a few weeks :)"
,mike953100,2012-11-07T04:40Z,"nice video bitrates, but why only 384 for audio and why ac3?"
,key2029,2012-11-07T18:13Z,"English Subtitle: All synced and edited (except Casino Royale)

http://subscene.com/subtitles/james-bond/english/648819

Casino Royale has audio problem 1:35:53 faded audio and possibly more. The 3li version was loaded to replace this and thus the subtitle was synced for it. I believe that applying -1 Sec (faster sub) and it can be used with this NhaNc3 version."
,AEIntel,2012-11-08T21:53Z,FUCKING SEED!!!!! im downloading at 0.2/s plz plz plz seed

,FrangThePain,2012-11-11T19:17Z,"OVER 11K LEECHERS!? YOURE ALL WHORES!! 

SEEEEEED YOU SLIMES!!"
,AjaxAssault,2012-11-12T00:46Z,"While I love that this is all together and is 720p, the file size is an average of 2.5GB per movie. It's in .mkv format, but is over 2GB. The uploader might want to refresh his choice of codecs, as most .mkv files are less than 2GB for 1080p (especially from Yify)
That being said, THANK YOU!!!!! ♥♥
I'll just convert these to properly compressed codecs myself when they finish."
,danltm,2012-11-13T04:13Z,"I don't care to wait, it's just 3y, 51w for me
SEED YOU CHEAP BASTARDS!"
,matt.elder1971,2012-11-13T14:09Z,"@AjaxAssault - YIFY's files are so small because they use a very low bitrate, leading to a degraded image."
,devinlgls,2012-11-14T20:21Z,This is a fantastic upload. Many thanks. Will definitely seed.
,DriverAus,2012-11-15T08:35Z,English subpack (working) : http://www.engsub.net/163171/
,buddda,2012-11-15T13:50Z,"thanks for posting the subpack, it was my only complaint about this amazing torrent"
,Darker666,2012-11-15T21:57Z,"Thank you very much SaM.
@AjaxAssault:
Could you give me a clue how to conver movies to low-space requiring format without loosing quality?
I love YIFY torrent size but I have no idea how to achieve it myself."
,MikolaiJD,2012-11-16T17:29Z,"we could really use some seeders, I've been downloading for days and still I'm only at 66%"

,matt.elder1971,2012-11-18T00:24Z,"I'm seeing nearly 1100 seeds, but only connecting to one, and getting less than 30KB/s speeds. Something has to be wrong here. Maybe a bunch of fake seeds?"
,mrsleep0000,2012-11-18T04:16Z,"You people crying for seeders, if you don't want to wait, you could always go buy it.
Fucking assholes, amazes me how much people bitch when they are getting something for free."
