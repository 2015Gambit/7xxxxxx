[T],MP4SUX,2012-10-31T02:23Z,"Short answer - yes, I checked.

Thought you were mad at my Red Dwarf screw up.

Not a rant, insight into my ""process"". If it's LOL, I specifically check for such errors. For instance, if you check out the first LOL or DIMENSION entry for that fringe episode, you can see that I specifically certified it free of Gross Piexelation Errors in the comment section.

If I say it, I've checked.
