Overview
From Thomas JeffersonΓÇÖs birth in 1743 to the California Gold Rush in 1849, AmericaΓÇÖs westward expansion comes to life in the hands of a writer fascinated by the way individual lives link up, illuminate one another, and collectively impact history.
Jefferson, a naturalist and visionary, dreamed that the United States would stretch across the North American continent, from ocean to ocean. The account of how that dream became reality unfolds in the stories of Jefferson and nine other Americans whose adventurous spirits and lust for land pushed the westward boundaries: Andrew Jackson, John ΓÇ£Johnny AppleseedΓÇ¥ Chapman, David Crockett, Sam Houston, James K. Polk, Winfield Scott, Kit Carson, Nicholas Trist, and John Quincy Adams.

Their storiesΓÇöand those of the nameless thousands who risked their lives to settle on the frontier, displacing thou- sands of Native AmericansΓÇöform an extraordinary chapter in American history that led directly to the cataclysm of the Civil War. Filled with illustrations, portraits, maps, battle plans, notes, and time lines, Lions of the West is a richly authoritative biography of AmericaΓÇöits ideals, its promise, its romance, and its destiny.
