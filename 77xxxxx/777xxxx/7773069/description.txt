They have now broken the 1/3 rule (how much of an hour is commercials).
Can you believe that in the 1950s this would be 39 eps of 55 minutes?
Now we get 20 eps at 40 minutes.
39*5=195 minutes of commercials per season then
20*20=400 minutes of commercials per season now
half the show, double the commecials - aint America great?
