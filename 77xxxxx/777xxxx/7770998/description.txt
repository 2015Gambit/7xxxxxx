Description:


Academy Award-winner Ben Kingsley (Gandhi) is MOSES in this awe-inspiring tale of an ordinary man called upon by God to become a great leader.

Moses is awe-struck when God, in the form of a burning bush, calls him to guide the Israelites out of bondage. The reluctant leader and his flock begin the treacherous journey to the Promised Land. However, Pharaoh intends to stop the exodus and with his brutal army traps the Israelites by the banks of the Red Sea. Yet these Israelites are God's chosen people, and the waters part, allowing their safe passage. Moses continues the chronicle of the pilgrimage to Canaan, through the life of this amazing leader and the many miracles God bestowed. MOSES is the fourth in a collectible series of Turner Original films based on Old Testament stories.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
