Hi there, First video upload.

I got tired of this video not being available on the internet, and I couldn't find the video on CBC's website. Well lo and behold, I eventually found the direct URL to the video itself. From there, I let the video buffer fully, and copied the resulting cache file to a separate folder, renamed it from "CAFE.tmp" to "WinningAmerica.wmv". I have had no issues with playback so far, but if you encounter any, please let me know.

Description: (from music.cbc.ca)

Before winning the 2011 Juno for Best New Group, Vancouver's Said the Whale was like any other band trying to make ends meet in one of the world's most expensive cities: they worked retail and on tugboats; they played gigs for an ever-growing legion of fans; and they spent countless hours plotting how they could take their careers to the next level. 

When a chance came for them to perform at South by Southwest, they jumped, and a CBC documentary crew jumped with them. 

Winning America is a musician's-eye view of a touring band trying to carve out a piece of the American dream at SxSW -- the music industry's most important festival, a festival around which the entire independent musician-year revolves. ∩╗┐This is their story.


Please seed, this is a rare torrent. :)
