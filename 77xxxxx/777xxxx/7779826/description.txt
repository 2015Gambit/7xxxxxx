Four issues of 'Jack and Jill'

Jack and Jill was a British children's comic published between 27 February 1954 and 29 June 1985, a run of approximately 1,640 issues.

The title was derived from the nursery rhyme of the same title but the characters 'Jack and Jill of Buttercup Farm' were otherwise unrelated. 'Jack and Jill of Buttercup Farm' was the cover strip for many years, originally drawn by Hugh McNeill and later by Antonio Lupatelli.

The stories of 'Jack and Jill' were related in rhyming couplets, as were a number of other early stories, although by the end of the 1970s the stories were written in normal prose form. Others were told in captions below the illustrations, a style of storytelling common to pre-war nursery comics such as Puck and Rainbow.

Why? Why not? Honestly, I like the look of them (reminded me of the illustrated books of my youth) and it was a quick fun, read (sometimes the heavy stuff just gets a bit too, ya know, heavy). If you have kids who are pc literate (I don't, so I'm just guessing that), chances are good they'll enjoy them, too.

There are only four issues included here, but if there's any interest I'm sure I could find some more of them.
