This is the biggest collection of remixes of the songs by the American recording artist Lana Del Rey. It includes the remixed versions of every song on the deluxe edition of her debut album Born To Die, plus the remixes of her first official single from the re-release of her debut album Born To Die: The Paradise Edition, Ride and two remixes of her songs Blue Velvet and Burning Desire, which also will be featured on The Paradise Edition. All of the songs are in high quality and with 320kbps bit-rate, so if you're party freaks (like I am) and you love Lana Del Rey (as much as I do), this is the perfect collection for you. Enjoy and seed!
