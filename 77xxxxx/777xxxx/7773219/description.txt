There is a lot of Jodorowsky available here at TPB, but I didn't see this one in my searches. If it's here and I just missed it somehow, apologies for the double-up.

The first volume is very solid - looks great. The scan on the second volume gets a little weird around page thirty. Nothing I can do in the 'Restoration' process to fix it, either. I've had the same thing happen to a couple color books I've scanned and the only way to change it is to just delete the entire thing and start over. Since this is the only scan I have for this book, I'm going to roll with it...
