UNDERSTANDING NORMAL AND CLINICAL NUTRITION, Eighth Edition, provides the most current and comprehensive coverage of both "normal" nutrition, such as digestion and metabolism, vitamins and minerals, and life cycle nutrition, as well as "clinical" nutrition related to diseases, such as nutrition and gastrointestinal, liver, and cardiovascular diseases. The text also incorporates a number of learning tools designed to help you retain the information and apply your knowledge so you are better prepared to work in a clinical setting. Features include case studies, "How To" boxes with examples of problem-solving in real-world situations, and study questions that further conceptual understanding of the material. Regardless of your course background, the text is organized and written in a clear, easy-to-follow format that will get you actively involved in the field of nutrition.
