'The Pogo Stepmother Goose'

Simon and Schuster, 1954

Written and Illustrated by Walt Kelly

After working as a Disney animator, Walt Kelly struck out on his own and Pogo first appeared in a 1941 Dell comic. By the late 40's Kelly had transformed Pogo into a newspaper strip. The first of 45 books, simply titled Pogo, was released in 1951. This was quickly followed by I Go Pogo, Uncle Pogo's So-So Stories, The Pogo Papers, and The Pogo Stepmother Goose.

An Amazon reviewer says: A few fairy tales, a parable or two, and some flat-out goofing. It's not all Pogo and crew, but it's an incredible collection by the hand that created that blue-eyed possum.

LTS is saying, it's genius work from one of the best illustrative hands to ever walk this Earth (or any other Earth, for that matter). You should download it and read it, because I'm pretty damn sure you'll enjoy it.
