Aliens - Inhuman Condition Collected from DHP 12-17

On a distant, frozen world, "artificial persons" are manufactured in discreet seclusion. With formidable new security synthetics coming online, how better to test their mettle than against a hive of deadly xenomorphs? But as "socialization specialist" Jean DuPaul sees her ever-more-human android charges sent to their destruction, she learns that the most savage species in the universe is man. From writer John Layman, creator of the award-winning Chew, and acclaimed artist Sam Kieth comes Aliens: Inhuman Condition, a hardcover graphic novella from the pages of Dark Horse Presents that shines a dark, disturbing light on the Aliens universe.
