Fourth in the Series - Mechanics of Manifestation - Embodying Your Heroic Future - Introducing the Bi-Veca and Tri-Veca Codes. Lecture and two full day workshop recorded in Sarasota, Florida, Sept 2001. This is extraordinary material, not heard on this planet for over 246,000 years. The Manifestation Template was introduced from a new perspective dealing with template substance and structure, the nature and workings of the creation currents; the density levels and the states of matter.  Consciousness and manifestation templates dealing with motive, method, medium and the question of creation projection are discussed, the question of tangibility of thought, what they are, where they come from, and the answer to the illusive question: Where on earth do they go?  The questions of conscious creation, the mastery of manifestation, and issues related to DNA embedding for manifestation are covered. Learn how to bring the heroic future into the NOW by looking at thought seeding, address a whole series of coding issues (cue code, DNA code, the count, Maharata projection code, the Rishiac Manifestation code) and  deal with the levels of activation which correspond with these teachings. It is time to set aside the limitations of psychological, metaphysical, and old school  spiritual guidelines for Insights into the higher capacities of your own Consciousness.  This taped series will enable you to take up the mantle of responsibility for redirecting the chaos of your miss-creations into a Wholeness and Healing Oneness with the other aspects of your total Being.
