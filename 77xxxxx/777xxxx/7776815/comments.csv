Check with antivirus, some creeps have been uploading infected programs for Youtube that don't work and infect your PC.

It may not be a virus, perhaps a trojan, but it installs and then your PC is infected, can't connect to internet because it says it's already connected, ie. someone else is in control...  Nasty piece of work, but fortunately, I could easily get rid of it... Creeps but not very bright ones....
