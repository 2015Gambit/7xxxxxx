Players can also opt to enhance their experience and get out of a jam with the in-game CoD Point System. With six tiers of in-app purchasing options to choose from, Zombies fans will be able to take their experience to a whole new level by unlocking additional areas and securing better weapons in much less time. Please note that CoD points are only applicable in single player.
ΓÇó	Buy CoD points in the Main Menu to use when you run out of earned points in-game.
ΓÇó	CoD points can be spent on anything in the game such as reviving, opening doors, weapons, perks, and the mystery box but are only used when you do not have enough earned points.
ΓÇó	Revives can also be bought with CoD points if you die without the revive perk, although the three revive limit still applies.
ΓÇó	Note: Your CoD points will be lost if the app is uninstalled from your device.
Sure, earning Achievements and Point-Multipliers is nice, but to survive these Co-Op Maps, youΓÇÖll need friends as much as youΓÇÖll need firepower. Lucky for you, not only will the weapons and perks you love from Call of Duty lie at your fingertips, you can join with up to 4 players via Wi-Fi to play mulitiplayer. 

As if that wasnΓÇÖt enough, Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies also includes ΓÇ£Dead-Ops ArcadeΓÇ¥ mode, an arcade-style top-down shooter perfectly suited for mobile combat vets. Unlocking the mode is easyΓÇösimply find the four missing coins in the gameΓÇÖs menus.

And donΓÇÖt forget to download the Call of Duty: ELITE Mobile App for an inside-edge on your console Call of Duty Multiplayer experience. Head over to the Google Play Store for all the grisly details on both Apps.
