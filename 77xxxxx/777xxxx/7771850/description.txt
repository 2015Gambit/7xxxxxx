Georgia Satellites is the first album released by The Georgia Satellites. It contains their biggest hit, "Keep Your Hands to Yourself" (which reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, behind Bon Jovi's "Livin' on a Prayer"), and another minor hit, "Battleship Chains," written by Terry Anderson. It also contains a cover of "Every Picture Tells a Story," written by Rod Stewart and Ron Wood. Most of the other songs were written by lead singer/rhythm guitarist Dan Baird, except "Red Light," which he co-wrote with Neill Bogan, and "Can't Stand the Pain," written by lead guitarist Rick Richards, who also takes lead vocal on the tune.

The band would release two more studio albums after this one, but none featured a song with nearly the radio and MTV success as "Keep Your Hands to Yourself," and the band finally split in the early 1990s.
