The third album of The Rongetz Foundation,
also recorded in New York, released on Sept
1Oth and features musicians such as Gregory
Porter, Ronnie Cuber, Renee Neufville or John
Robinson. On that session, Rongetz goal was to
dig more than ever into compositions that are
bridging Jazz with Hip-Hop and Soul music.  It
resulted in eight original pieces and a cover
of legend Reggae pioneer Count Ossie, which
compose this brilliant The Brooklyn Butterfly
Session album.
