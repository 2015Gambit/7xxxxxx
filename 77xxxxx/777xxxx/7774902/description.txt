ArKaos GrandVJ

Eight channels VJ software for real time HD video mixing

GrandVJ is a real-time video mixer software allowing to compose up to 8 layers of Video on the fly. Take any video from your hard drive, add effects to it and start making your own video show. 


Powerful video made easy

Manipulate, trigger and mix video clips with sound, animated text strings or live cameras in much the same way as mixing music to create a spectacular audiovisual show. GrandVJ can mix up to 8 layers with a vast library of video effects, transitions and sound driven visual generators.

The A/B crossfading mode with independent preview makes it incredibly flexible to perform live, and the Browser Preview feature lets you preview visuals, effects, transitions and sources before sending them to the output, just like a DJ previews his next track in his headphones.
