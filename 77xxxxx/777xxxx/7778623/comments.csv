,setup4u,2012-11-02T10:31Z,This is UNBELIEVABLE good Picture and sound .. If anybody search this movie in good Quality (good Q at this time).. This is good as can be at this time... won't regret it.... Maybe as-holes who expect it HD Quality before movies are released going to regret it.... So everybody else are welcome to enjoy this pre-released movie........
