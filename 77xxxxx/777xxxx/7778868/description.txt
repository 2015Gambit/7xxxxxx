
Pulitzer Prize winner Hedrick SmithΓÇÖs new book is an extraordinary achievement, an eye-opening account of how, over the past four decades, the American Dream has been dismantled and we became two Americas. 

In his bestselling The Russians, Smith took millions of readers inside the Soviet Union. In The Power Game, he took us inside WashingtonΓÇÖs corridors of power. Now Smith takes us across America to show how seismic changes, sparked by a sequence of landmark political and economic decisions, have transformed America. As only a veteran reporter can, Smith fits the puzzle together, starting with Lewis PowellΓÇÖs provocative memo that triggered a political rebellion that dramatically altered the landscape of power from then until today. 

This is a book full of surprises and revelationsΓÇöthe accidental beginnings of the 401(k) plan, with disastrous economic consequences for many; the major policy changes that began under Jimmy Carter; how the New Economy disrupted AmericaΓÇÖs engine of shared prosperity, the ΓÇ£virtuous circleΓÇ¥ of growth, and how America lost the title of ΓÇ£Land of Opportunity.ΓÇ¥ Smith documents the transfer of $6 trillion in middle-class wealth from homeowners to banks even before the housing boom went bust, and how the U.S. policy tilt favoring the rich is stunting AmericaΓÇÖs economic growth.

 This book is essential reading for all of us who want to understand America today, or why average Americans are struggling to keep afloat. Smith reveals how pivotal laws and policies were altered while the public wasnΓÇÖt looking, how Congress often ignores public opinion, why moderate politicians got shoved to the sidelines, and how Wall Street often wins politically by hiring over 1,400 former government officials as lobbyists.

 Smith talks to a wide range of people, telling the stories of Americans high and low. From political leaders such as Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and Martin Luther King, Jr., to CEOs such as Al Dunlap, Bob Galvin, and Andy Grove, to heartland Middle Americans such as airline mechanic Pat OΓÇÖNeill, software systems manager Kristine Serrano, small businessman John Terboss, and subcontractor Eliseo Guardado, Smith puts a human face on how middle-class America and the American Dream have been undermined.

 This magnificent work of history and reportage is filled with the penetrating insights, provocative discoveries, and the great empathy of a master journalist. Finally, Smith offers ideas for restoring AmericaΓÇÖs great promise and reclaiming the American Dream.

 ΓÇ£Hedrick Smith has done it again! Who Stole the American Dream? provides a readable and comprehensive account of how Americans have been robbed of our dream of a broad middle class over the past forty years. It is essential reading.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöJay W. Lorsch, the Louis E. Kirstein Professor of Human Relations, Harvard Business School
