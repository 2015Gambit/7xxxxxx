Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho|1984|Critically Acclaimed|Xvid|MP3|Phantom

Synopsis:
Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho is a comic satire on a judicial system, where cases drag on for decades, where plaintives either die or lose hope and money, while the corrupt run scot free, thanks to their nexus with corrupt lawyers.

Plot:
An old couple, Mohan Joshi (Bhisham Sahni) and his wife (Dina Pathak) decides to sue their landlord (Amjad Khan) for not maintaining their 'collapsing' apartment building. For this, they hire two cunning lawyers (Naseeruddin Shah and Satish Shah), while Rohini Hattangadi is the opposition lawyer.
The court case drags on for years and the lawyers milk the old couple dry, while they become rich. Back home in the society, the old couple is ridiculed for fighting the landlord, but they fight on nevertheless.
In the end when the judge comes to check the condition of the chawl, Kapadia's men prop up the place thus convincing the judge that all is well with the chawl. Finally, Joshi gathers all his strength and pulls down the temporary supports put up by the men causing the building to collapse on himself.[2]
The film provides deep insight into the struggles of Indian 'middle class', which rarely gets space on the film screen.

The film won the 1984 National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare.
