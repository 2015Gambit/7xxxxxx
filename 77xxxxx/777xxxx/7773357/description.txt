THE FIRST TOREENT OF SKULL CAPS!
After downloading mount it on a CD via PowerIso, Nero etc, or try it on VirtualCloneDrive

!!!I apologize for the missing English Version!, but those were the only languages on the Original Disc!!!

--IGNORE THE POINTSOFT.EXE!--

Just click setup.exe
IF it's not starting try :
rightclick --> properties --> compatibility --> Run as administrator

(It worked without the above step on Windows 7!)

When Your Installing, don't install These Things :

-DirectX
-MemoWeb 3 Flash

After the Installation is Complete, go to your Skull-Caps Folder and rightclick on
skull16.exe --> Properties --> compatibility mode --> Windows 98/ ME --> Run with 256 Colours --> Run in resolution 640x480 --> Run as administrator.

If you done all of this correctly, Skull Caps should work perfectly without any problems
