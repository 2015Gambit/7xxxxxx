It's been a LOOOONG time since I read this one and I don't remember exactly what it's about. I remember the 'revolving doors' are dimensional, or worldly maybe. And that the main character is unaware of why and how he's moving through said doors. And that he meets, and occasionally fights, some crazy creatures and beings.
