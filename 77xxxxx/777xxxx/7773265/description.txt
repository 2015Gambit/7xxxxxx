Through a series of never-before-seen interviews and rare photos, documentary-maker Rich Koslowski reveals the horrifying true story behind the Cartoon industry - the story that Hollywood doesn't want you to see. Told in the same style as a Ken Burns documentary, with interviews of toon stars today as well as historical file footage of the early years, this work of fiction will forever change the way you think of those beloved characters in the white gloves.
