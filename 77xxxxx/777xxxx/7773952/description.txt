Michael Nyman Discography
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Nyman

It's funny when you read online how somebody dares to label Michael Nyman...
"Contemporary Classical"... a funny oxymoron that does not explain anything in his childish contradiction.
Surely he inherits from the classical tradition, as you would inherit for instance from Mozart... then you start to dissect his tunes and to reproduce cloned samples in repetitious sequences...
This is a modern abstraction process and conceptualization which breaks with the classical tradition: this is Minimalism.

As many, I discovered Nyman's music through the soundtracks in Peter Greenaway's movies and still today I think of both as Demiurges or Architects. The discography I show here is not really complete. His whole opera is vaste and there are works which are scarcely mentioned even on his site: This is simply what was available searching online, but I deem you will like anyway the insight it offers.

You will find here 78 albums, solo and collaborations.
All the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).
The sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.
Different rates are signed in the name of the albums zips. Soundtracks are signed as "ost"...

Enjoy :)
