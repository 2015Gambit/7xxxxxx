,XYippie,2012-10-29T17:26Z,"I don't know about this ""imm"" troll, but Nepotu's football games are the fucking bomb. He cuts 'em a little short sometimes (got a wicked scalpel for commercial breaks), but they're ALWAYS top quality, not one single exception. Thanks @Nepotu, you give good torrent."

,biber17,2012-10-29T20:41Z,"AV 10 as always! Love the chance to download great games in 720 and the rest in 480. 

Thanks again brother. Without you, pirate bay has no NFL (or MLB playoffs)!! You are the best!!

PLEASE KEEP UPLOADING! 

Go Seahawks!!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-10-29T21:01Z,"@imm_: Your father jerk off is bad quality. That's the way you've born, MF spammer with your shitty site. If you don't know what you talking about go to phuk yourself, moron!

@all my friends (not including ""the moron""): Thank you for your support guyz! I'm glad to be here with you.

@rr-ne: The 540p version is already up, bro!"
