2)  Incredible Edibles 
In the second episode of ethnobotanist James Wong's series about plant based medicine, he challenges us to look at the medicinal and not just the nutritional value of some of the food we eat. In a fascinating blend of gardening, cookery, science and history, James shows us how to use turmeric to help ease muscular aches and pains, whips up a moisturising body cream from something you would normally have for breakfast, invites two willing members of the public to try his pungent onion gargle for their recurring sore throats, and shows how to grow watercress on your kitchen work top and transform it in to a mouth watering and vitamin packed soup, ideal if you're a bit anaemic.
