DMT: The Spirit Molecule

The Spirit Molecule reviews what we know about psychedelic drugs in general, and DMT in particular. It then traces the DMT research project from its earliest intimations through the maze of committees and review boards to its actual performance.

This book started the new psychedelic revolution. Dr. Rick Strassman's report on the results of the first officially sanctioned study of psychedelics to be carried out in the US in 40 years.

DMT: The Spirit Molecule Dr. Strassman leads the way into a new exploration of psychedelics. Careful, mature science is replacing the hedonistic excesses of the sixties--and scientists like Dr. Strassman believe that they are discovering a way to see into other dimensions, even as other scientists are beginning to prove that they're real. A true wonder journey.
