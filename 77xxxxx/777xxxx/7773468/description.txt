Chemical biology utilizes chemical principles to modulate systems to either investigate the underlying biology or create new function. Over recent years, chemical biology has received particular attention of many scientists in the life sciences from botany to medicine. This book contains an overview focusing on the research area of protein purification, enzymology, vitamins, antioxidants, biotransformation, gene delivery, signaling, regulation and organization. Particular emphasis is devoted to both theoretical and experimental aspects. The textbook is written by international scientists with expertise in synthetic chemistry, protein biochemistry, enzymology, molecular biology, drug discovery and genetics many of which are active chemical, biochemical and biomedical research. The textbook is expected to enhance the knowledge of scientists in the complexities of chemical and biological approaches and stimulate both professionals and students to dedicate part of their future research in understanding relevant mechanisms and applications of chemical biology.
