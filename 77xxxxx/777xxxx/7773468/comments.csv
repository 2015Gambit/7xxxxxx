If you had said that these were InTech books, I wouldn't have wasted my time and bandwidth downloading them.

So in the future, please give the title and publisher of the book (like most other people do).  Otherwise, I won't bother downloading your torrents and that will mean one less seeder to help you out."

NONE of these books come off the In-Tech website. yes they are available there and if i had of used In-Tech as my source, I'd have credited or referred to them in the description.
Feel free to post links to any sites where users can access e-Books.
Just as you are free to download or not download ANY of my torrents ;-)"
,LemonJ-Lo,2012-10-31T17:09Z,"Not to argue the point, since I do appreciate the work the you and others do in finding technical books and posting them in torrents, but it would be helpful if you just identified the publisher and author / editor in addition to providing the title.

It doesn't matter if -you- got the book from the InTech website or anywhere else, it matters that InTech is the publisher.  Helps narrow it down and prevents duplication.

Thanks."

Apologies for not adding it previously.

Kind regards."
