Thanks for this upload.
But it currently says 4 seeders, but nothing is actually seeded. Could you please seed again?"

I'm seeding all the time except when i go to bed - I turn off my computer. It's my first torrent so I wanna seed for as long as I could. 
Hope you all guys enjoy it :)"

,zombie131313,2012-11-03T11:37Z,"Ok I think i fixed it, if you have any problems let me know."
,antignor,2012-11-03T18:41Z,It's in now. Thank you for this nice collection.
