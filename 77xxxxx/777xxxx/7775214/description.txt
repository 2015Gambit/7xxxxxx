Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On this Tuesday, October 30 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy following its landfall on the Eastern Seaboard last night. 

Alex talks with the foremost expert on HAARP, Dr. Nick Begich. In a PrisonPlanet.tv interview last year, Begich talked about controversial science experiments, including HAARP, mind control technology, and compartmentalization within the science community. He is the author of Controlling the Human Mind: The Technologies of Political Control or Tools for Peak Performance and Angels Don't Play This Haarp: Advances in Tesla Technology. 

Alex also talks with investigator, film producer, speaker, author and businessman Bob Fletcher, who has produced a number of videos, including: Weather Control as a Weapon, The Bombs of Oklahoma and Exotic Weapons of Mass Control.
