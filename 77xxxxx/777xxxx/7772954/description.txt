Judas's Note:
 
Due to the basically NON-STOP motion and camera shake, there is rarely a moment of pause in which a "good" clean crisp screenshot can be made, and as usual, when there is motion it's really hard to determine "QUALITY". HOWEVER, video will always look sharper/cleaning/crisper and overall much much better when it's actually being played. I've uploaded MANY screenshots to illustrate a few good and bad looking screenshots even though while viewing it clearly looks pretty damn good still.
 
I've also made a few "tweaks" to potentially improve motion image quality while retaining the same bitrate/file sizes. It could be as low as 0% different to as much as a 15% improvement or perhaps more in specific situations.
 
We'll see, please report any issue if there is any... Thank you and view on!
