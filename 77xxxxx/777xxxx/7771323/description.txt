  The work of Blackpool's emergency services as they deal with people   
  suffering mental health problems. Paramedic Sue McGrath is called to  
  a man with a history of deliberately causing himself harm - tonight   
  he has run into a taxi - PC Stuart Gornall is confronted by a man     
  wielding a large knife, and all three services spring into action     
  when a body is found outside a block of flats, having fallen from     
  the 14th floor. Is it the result of foul play or has someone finally  
  lost the battle with their inner demons?                              
                                                                        
  Enjoy!

  W4F is one of the oldest TV Scene groups and releases a diverse mix   
  of quality TV programming including sports, documentaries, scripted,  
  reality, talk shows and other quality content that may be overlooked  
  by other groups. We release purely for fun and to share programming   
  we like with the world.                                               
                                                                        
  W4F is a global group interested in spreading quality programming     
  from around the world to the internet. If you are passionate about    
  your country's TV content, feel it is unrepresented and want to share 
  it with the world please feel free to contact us. We are interested   
  in all television markets with a focus on English content from the    
  USA, Canada, Australia and Europe. Potential recruits will preferably 
  have the ability to receive digital TV broadcasts and some knowledge  
  of digital capturing.                                                 
                                                                        
  From time to time we are also interested in hearing from site         
  owners who are interested in affiliating W4F. We are looking for      
  private links with archives.                                          
                                                                        
  W4F has nothing to do with torrents/p2p so don't ask about that!
