Hey guys... There was some trouble with the a7x pack when it got released.. But here it is!

Gifted to me by Piratefs/Green  and the maroon song from NV

Enjoy guys

Nightmare - Avenged Sevenfold
Afterlife - Avenged Sevenfold
Beast and the Hartlot - Avenged Sevenfold




if anyone likes to gift more songs for everyone

You can add me on steam : Themperror or PM me on the cs_rin_ru  forum (change the _ to .)

We'll discuss about which DLC's have already been gifted or shared and stuff so we won't receive copies of songs we already have (and thus wasting money)
