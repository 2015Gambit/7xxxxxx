,DannyBoyDannyBoy1974,2012-11-05T00:42Z,"***WARNING TO DOWNLOADERS*** Though labeled ""DVDRip,"" this encoding is NOT ripped from a bona fide English-language release (R1 or R2 DVD). It is an ""R5 Line"" and should be labeled as such.

Even if it is prior to the official R1 or R2 release date, bona fide DVDrip encodings of English-language films CAN and sometimes DO appear if the source has been leaked from the production run of R1/R2 DVDs; so it is not obvious that an encoding labeled ""DVDRip"" is an R5 Line if it appears before official release. Unfortunately, unscrupulous release groups will often purposely label their R5 Lines as ""DVDRip"" to inflate the popularity of their releases.

Why should you care? R5s of English-language films are DVDs released in Region 5 (Russia, et al.) with foreign-language audio, and most often lack the expensive image post-processing that films released in DVD Regions 1 & 2 receive. That means video inferior to the video you get with R1 and R2. To get the English audio, the audio from the theatrical release is pirated digitally from the movie theatre by running an audio line to a recording device, resulting in a capture which almost always includes electronic noise in the form of clicks, pops, sharp static, and an ever-present hum or hiss. So ""R5 Line"" means both video and audio inferior to a ""DVDRip"" of R1/R2 DVD releases.

The more we spread the word about mislabeled R5 Lines in the file-sharing communities, the sooner mislabeled uploads like this can die and the more bandwidth we all save."
