Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, October 29 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the coming elections as Hurricane Sandy closes in on the East Coast. As reported bythis morning, Twitter messages are circulating calling for looting in New York as the National Guard prepares to respond. 

On today's worldwide transmission, actor, author, veteran, and the former Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura, talks with Alex about the election and other topics.

Note: It seems to have become standard practice that when Alex has as a guest on the show one of his partners in the supplement marketing web sites (infowarshealth.com amd infowarsteam.com), they are not listed in the official show description. Today, veterinarian and naturopath Joel Wallach is a guest in the third hour.
