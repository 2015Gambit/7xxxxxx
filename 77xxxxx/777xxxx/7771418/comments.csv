,RMJ113,2012-10-29T20:22Z,"repacks are compressed for those with slow internet speed's, but the down fall is they take a very long time to unpack- install"
,gtaarcman,2012-10-29T20:32Z,"@devilvj....

,RomanCl,2012-10-30T00:15Z,"Yeah sorry for what I said earlier, heromaster is not a trusted up loader anymore he uploads something that you cant even change the language of"
,dandalis,2012-10-30T00:17Z,what the GDDR5 means ? do i need a GDDR5 card to run it or something ?
,RomanCl,2012-10-30T00:21Z,When I delete the russian folder it gives me the endless loading screen
,RomanCl,2012-10-30T00:30Z,So the option to change it to English is in the installer but when installed in English crack applied it gives me endless loading. But when you install in Russian it works. That is very weird to me
,dust45a,2012-10-30T01:28Z,"this game just keep loading loading, it wont even start, crap"

,aCiD_x,2012-10-30T01:44Z,"Can't speak Russian. This is trash. Also, as it's set up now, I can't use my xbox controller because it's ridiculously sensitive. Overall fail. Trashed."
,aCiD_x,2012-10-30T01:46Z,"Now maybe someone who can speak English in proper sentences could explain that lol. Thanks tho, less caps maybe next time."

,tester124,2012-10-30T01:53Z,"Game never loads, installer is in russian, can't figure out how to change it into English and no, there is no EA Games in my regedit."
,whateverthefuck,2012-10-30T02:00Z,"@Jimmy5461: Dude this isn't a proper installer, so it doesn't write to the registery."
,Jimmy5461,2012-10-30T02:04Z,mh.. its totally fine install and the games has his registery entry dono why u dont have it my problem is now i wana start a race and the games says hold brake + accelerate but nothing happens -.-
,tester124,2012-10-30T02:23Z,"Nothing better than downloading a game where the installer and game are in foreign languages, the game doesn't load and where you can't change the language."
,jem7jam,2012-10-30T02:33Z,not working on win xp and get dxgi.dll error 
,jem7jam,2012-10-30T02:34Z,and thnx for the torrent fast speed
,tester124,2012-10-30T03:02Z,"OH, I found the language registry entry.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE>Software>Wow6432Node>EA Games>Need for Speed(TM) Most Wanted>Locale

Change it to en_EN"
,Frosticee,2012-10-30T03:04Z,Registry key is in: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWOW6432NODEEA GamesNeed for Speed(TM) Most Wanted
,whateverthefuck,2012-10-30T03:17Z,"Aliright then, for the people with the language problem; the language can ONLY be chosen in the installer, THERE IS NO IN-GAME LANGUAGE OPTION (and you can't change anything in the registery to switch the language either, the Jimmy5461 person up there is just another internet douche), because the installer ONLY installs the language and video files that you have chosen, either Russian or English. 

So for those who have already installed, you're going to have to uninstall and then reinstall with the right choice. The first choice the game asks you to make is the language one; chose the second option for English (it'll create an ""EN-US"" folder in your install directory instead of the default ""RUS"" one).

But here's the big fucking problem, the English game DOESN't fucking work (at least not on Win 7 64). GRRRRRR I had to fucking install/uninstall 3 times just to get the language thing right, and now this... (BTW, the Russian one seems to work fine though.)

PS: Well at least the download was super fast."
,whateverthefuck,2012-10-30T03:29Z,"Update:

Alright, finally made it to work (win7 64/GTX 570):

a) Run installer, choose second option in first choice.

b) Find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE>Software>Wow6432Node>EA Games>Need for Speed(TM) Most Wanted>Locale
in your windows registery and change the value to en-EN (thanks tester124 and Frosticee for the info)

c) Download, and copy/paste this crack ""Need for Speed Most Wanted Crack Only v2.0 3DM NiCkkkDoN"" (5.5MB only, and it is available here on TPB.)

And FINALLY you're good to go, Jesus Christ this was irritating."
,BR0ADSW0RD,2012-10-30T03:50Z,"OMG. Thanks to whateverthefuck, tester124 and Frosticee. Finally got this game to English.

When you're in the installer select Àíãëèéñêèé. IT MEANS ENGLISH.

Then go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE>Software>Wow6432Node>EA Games>Need for Speed(TM) Most Wanted>Locale

Change ru_RU to en_EN"
,bikerabhinav,2012-10-30T04:04Z,"Whateverthefuck's comment helped. Thanks a lot!

GAME IS WORKING 100% FINE IN ENGLISH. Just follow these steps:
a) Run installer, choose second option in first choice.

b) Find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE>Software>Wow6432Node>EA Games>Need for Speed(TM) Most Wanted>Locale
in your windows registery and change the value to en-EN (thanks tester124 and Frosticee for the info)

c) Download, paste this crack in game folder: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7771206/

ENJOT THE GAME!

Thanks HeroMaster and Whateverthefuck"

,scream95,2012-10-30T06:46Z,"Okay guys, I've been trying to figure out why it wasn't working on my system, 

(Whateverthefuck, BR0ADSW0RD and others)
there solution helps but if you have multiscreens/ graphic cards, YOU NEED TO DISABLE YOUR SECONDARY ONE!  "
,BR0ADSW0RD,2012-10-30T06:50Z,Does anyone else get frame rate problems in the cities? I have a GTX 670 and a 4GHz quad-core AMD but it will lag in the cities... I don't think the game is optimized very well... It's only using 60% of my graphics card and processor.
,bikerabhinav,2012-10-30T08:18Z,"@Abaris777: Press Alt and Enter together. It'll switch to full screen,. 

Back after a few races, couldn't stop myself from saying, This game/franchisee has gone utter shit.
Car handles like a fucking Bull, totally unrealistic. 
They should learn how to code driving mechanics from GTA 4.

Regardless, huge THANKS to uploader for saving my $$ which I planned on spending for its multiplayer. Game ain't worth a penny ."
,PseudoPositive,2012-10-30T09:37Z,"Had the loading hang, so I got this crack:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7771128/Need_For_Speed_Most_Wanted_2012.Crack_only

Tweaked the regfile, now it works in English, Thanks for the effort HeroMaster, +1 :)"
,aCiD_x,2012-10-30T09:37Z,"Seems lazy, this game. It's nothing like the first Most Wanted.....they were too lazy to come up with a new name. Oh well, the game is here it plays well enough even though it freezes sometimes, it's usually just for a couple seconds. Some instructions wouldve been nice in the info but Whateverthefuck posted great info.
Overall
I am disappointed, I wanted the old NFS back. There's minimal modification abilities, only generic things like ""Lightweight chassis"" or ""Long/Short gears"" ""Burn/Burst Nitrous"" etc....oh well it is certainly slightly better than ""The Run"" but that isn't saying much.
Wouldn't pay shit for this game. "
,00uhhi,2012-10-30T10:27Z,"guys it does work.

in your windows registry and change the value to en-EN.

c) And change GDFBinary to x:xxxxxNeed for Speed(TM) Most WantedGDFBinary_en_US.dll *(where x= your computer drive and folder name in which the game is installed)
