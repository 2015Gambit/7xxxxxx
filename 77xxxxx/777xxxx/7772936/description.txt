Here is the complete series of Si-Move Armor simulations published by SPI. They cover the entire history of armored conflict from the Spanish Civil War through the late 70's. The titles include:

Kampfpanzer
Desert War
Panzer '44
Mech War '77
October War

As a special bonus, I've included the first edition of Red Star/White Star (sans map), with a few extras.

Enjoy!
