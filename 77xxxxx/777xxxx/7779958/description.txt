'Pogo's Sunday Punch'

Simon and Schuster, 1957

Written and Illustrated by Walt Kelly

The cover of the book reads...

Containing

War Nor Peace (A Novel treatment)

Stuff and Nonsense (28 pages of verse?)

And several old favorites, a few of which are incompletely new

As I said on the last upload...

It's genius work from one of the best illustrative hands to ever walk this Earth (or any other Earth, for that matter). You should download it and read it, because I'm pretty damn sure you'll enjoy it.
