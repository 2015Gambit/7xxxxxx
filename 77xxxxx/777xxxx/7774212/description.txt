If you liked it, return there and search for more ear candy.

If you really liked it, leave a gushingly thankfull comment while there.

If you thought it was a waste of precious bandwidth, meditate on the inherent suckiness of the universe and the unfairness of not being born in a time of direct brain-computer linkage.

If you thought it was a waste of your valuable time, well, let's not kid ourselves about what your time is really worth since you are spending it trolling the internet for free stuff rather than solving the many ills of mankind.

If you pass on or post the archive to another site please include this tiny, itty-bitty, little note so that I may continue to spread joy in my own special way.

SamIam thanks you for sharing.



The 1975 album was recorded from vinyl by God only knows whom.
The files were barely audible. I've remastered them the best I could.
The result is less than satisfactory, but it's as good as it gets. Sorry.

The 1977 album was downloaded from an unknown source.
Most probably ripped from one of the CD re-issues, as it includes
the re-recorded "Roxy roller" single with Bryan Adam's vocals,
along with it's B-side ("Rue de Chance") as bonus tracks.

This is pretty much a complete collection of the band.
You can burn the whole thing on a single audio-CD if you like.
Just remember NOT to normalize the tracks and to use NO GAPS
between tracks. The disc should be fine, totalizing 79'17".
I've included here a possible CD cover that I made which can be
printed to be inserted on a standard CD jewel case
if you like.

Enjoy!
