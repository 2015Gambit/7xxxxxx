,ShoReleases,2012-11-02T10:15Z,"@HalloweenTV True!!
Just wanted some activity here and wanted to check whether people are actually bothered to read the desc or even say thanks. :/"
,kriegerg69,2012-11-06T17:00Z,People probably aren't saying anything or downloading much because someone else uploaded a complete pack containing all four of this year's episodes 2 days after you uplaoded this one episode.
