,captainkhaos1966,2012-11-01T00:32Z,"Yeah please split up, this would take forever to download"
,alinafan,2012-11-01T00:59Z,Who the fuck uploads an 18 gig rar file?
,zyzykwy,2012-11-01T01:18Z,A file this large is almost garunteed to get corrupted at some point too.  smaller RAR files can have recovery options put in without boosting thier size too much.
,RIggsta,2012-11-01T01:35Z,"this girl is boring, if you waste 18gigs of your harddrive on this lame chick you suck at life"
,5-click,2012-11-01T16:43Z,I try it. It's just a half of a Blue-Ray. Nobody whines about a 40 GB Movie. Thank you!
,SamMalone1963,2012-11-02T15:09Z,ANONYMOUS...  Are yougoing to dedicate ANY BANDWIDTH?  Whats up.  Have only gone up 2% in the last 24 hrs.
,Who-He-iZ,2012-11-03T19:09Z,"THANK YOU anon ! Whoever you are, you did an amazing job. We just got this 100 % and yes this rar is not corrupted or passworded. AWESOME GIRL (as we all know!). Many, many thx."
,Phucker67,2012-11-08T17:01Z,"just wanted to say...while, yes indeed, it is going very slowly, if 5-click & Who-He-Iz recommend it...I'm going wait the wait.  They both do excellent work so they'll know it if they see it."
,Jokind,2012-11-27T13:32Z,"Thank you Anonymous!

@5-click I am sorry but you are wrong, people always complain about the size when it is a bluray, always. They complain for multiple reasons: lack of HDD space, limited bandwidth from ISP and the time it takes for download. I personally don't mind the size."
