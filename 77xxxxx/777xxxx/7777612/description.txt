The user interface is intuitive, so you should not have any navigational problems, whether you are a first-time or experienced user. In the Home area, you view the current status of Security, Cleaning and Optimizing.




Start the Smart PC Care feature in order to scan (quick, deep, custom) your computer for junk files and folders, fragments on the disk drive, spyware and malware, web-based traces, outdated and missing drivers, registry errors, and fragments in registry.

In addition, you can schedule a scan and enable the program to automatically fix the errors or shutdown the computer after the system has been optimized.

Furthermore, you can repair Windows registry errors, optimize registry entries, clean and optimize the disk, optimize environment so that you can safely play high-demanding video games, boost memory, and update drivers..

But Advanced System Optimizer also protects you against web-based attacks, securely wipes files and folders, password-protects sensitive files, has a backup and restore system, fixes common problems found in Windows, scans the system for duplicate files, and more.

Unfortunately, the trial version is limited to scanning options, and you can fix only 20 registry problems for free (which makes the software harder to evaluate). Otherwise, you have to purchase the full product. Nevertheless, Advanced System Optimizer barely uses system resources, and it performs a thorough scan. We recommend it to all users.
