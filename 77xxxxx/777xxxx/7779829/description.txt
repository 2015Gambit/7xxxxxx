Cory Doctorow's eBooks


All of the files were downlaoded from Cory's website craphound.com except from the folder 'coauthored'. There are most of Cory's works in lots of formats and languages.

Please read, for example, the first section of little brother ebook: "the copyright thing" so you can understand why Cory posted all of his books on his website.
