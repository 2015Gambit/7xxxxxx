OpenPuff is a professional steganography tool:
HW seeded random number generator (CSPRNG)
Deniable steganography
Carrier chains (up to 256Mb of hidden data)
Carrier bits selection level
Modern multi-cryptography (16 algorithms)
Multi-layered data obfuscation (3 passwords)
X-squared steganalysis resistance

Unique layers of security and obfuscation:
256bit+256bit symmetric-key cryptography with KDF4 password extension
256bit symmetric-key data scrambling (CSPRNG-based shuffling)
Data whitening (CSPRNG-based noise mixing)
Adaptive non-linear carrier bit encoding
