,Brain9000,2012-11-01T07:58Z,yeah i agree they are totally phoning it in
,Brain9000,2012-11-01T08:07Z,I'm just glad i've been torrenting it instead of adding to the list of viewers. Hopefully they will do a good star wars/lucasfilm/disney episode though
,stuart0305,2012-11-01T08:19Z,It's like watching the slow and painfully death of a loved one.
,kamakazy_kid,2012-11-01T08:28Z,"Perfect, as always. Thanks eztv!"
,vinnytrips,2012-11-01T10:50Z,"People panning this episode: have you forgotten how amazing last week's ep was? It can't be perfect every time. You should be thankful that those geniuses are still doing what they do. For 16 years.

Thank you Trey and Matt, South Park is the best television show, of all times."
,The_Chob,2012-11-01T12:30Z,"Dont know what you guys are talking about. I liked this episode, the only ep this season i didnt really like was the hawaii ep. "
,wn1user,2012-11-01T13:41Z,You've got to see the reference to Lance Armstrong... cool episode and thanks eztv!
,vinnytrips,2012-11-01T14:06Z,"it's fucking brilliant, don't get me wrong, I'm just saying that a lot of people seem to like the previous episode better. because it was ""easier"" I guess. but both of them are brilliant, in different ways. I particularly enjoy this one, 'cause it references something much bigger."
,AnHero24,2012-11-01T15:19Z,thank you kind sir
,yerk55,2012-11-01T17:44Z,"@Brain9000
So youre a fan of the show, and continue to watch, yet want to harm the show by watching it without adding to their official numbers? Then why watch at all? Youre a disgrace of a SP fan."
,Coolio135,2012-11-01T20:27Z,Haha thanks this hilarious. Mackey yeah
,PetaFlux,2012-11-01T23:49Z,"This was probably the worst episode I have ever seen, I couldn't even watch it til the end. 
That's how bad it was."
,norway4free,2012-11-02T08:37Z,"go lance armstrong,hahahaha"
,Vallencre,2012-11-02T11:35Z,"I'm not a quality fanatic but I did notice some distortion in the audio at parts. Kind of lame. Wasn't a huge deal for me, but if you're REALLY picky you might be able to find a better quality one."
,stijr,2012-11-03T07:06Z,"I can't believe did not like this episode. 

This was one of the most thoughtful and brilliant eps. "
,RocMarciano,2012-11-03T07:27Z,I wish they would start throwing in eps that dont have to do with current events everytime more like they used to...
,ToastedNuts,2012-11-03T23:43Z,@RocMarciano -  You're the only one
,paleface434,2012-11-04T06:27Z,"i don't know what you guys are talking about. Its not side=splitting funny, but one of the best satire's i've seen on South Park in a bit"
,avaadorey,2012-11-05T01:45Z,"Yeah this show does suck now, nothing but non stop product placement! "
,dog10dog,2012-11-05T04:10Z,They said it them self in that episode about everything being shit. There getting tired of it and just seeing how long they can get away with it.
,Fredo25,2012-11-06T01:01Z,"The purpose of the comment section is to leave comment on the download itself, not if you like the episode or not "
,Zombiesaysgrr,2012-11-06T03:25Z,Great quality.
,matsiboi,2012-11-07T11:50Z,How can you not like this episode? You gotta read between the lines on this one. 
,DJeez91,2012-11-08T05:06Z,"Pretty good but they overdid it on this one. the last episode was better. More like old school south park.
If the animation was still crappy, it would be much funnier."
