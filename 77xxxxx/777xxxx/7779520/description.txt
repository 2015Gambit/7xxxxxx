Blood Brother

After Benny gets brutally beat up by some
vampires, he calls Dean for help. Dean
abruptly packs up and tells a confused Sam
that hes taking a personal day. Benny
confesses that hes going after his Maker so
Dean offers to help, flashing back on the
many times Benny helped him and Castiel in
Purgatory. Meanwhile, Sam uses his solo time
to reflect on the life he left behind with
Amelia. However, when things go bad for Dean
and Benny, Dean calls Sam for help, which
makes everything very complicated.
