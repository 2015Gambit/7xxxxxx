MTotalBundle 7.05 changes

    
    Added MStereoSpread plugin.
    MStereoScope: Added M/S meters.
    Documentations highly extended and available from within the plugin.
    MStereoGenerator, MStereoProcessor, MStereoScope: Panorama direction meter inside the phase meter.
    Modulator editors slightly restructuralized for better compactness.
    MMultiBandHarmonizer: Added pitch-bend range parameter.
    All peak/loudness/.. meters are now reset by clicking on them. Hold ctrl to reset individual meters.
    MMultiAnalyzer: Added name & visual presets, visual settings can be changed from any instance, added multi-track loudness & collision meters.
    In surround mode you can now enable individual channels for processing.
    Analyzers are now surround capable.
    Added phases sync groups to all modulators, so they can now be synchronized with each other and potentially with other parts of the plugin.
    Most modulator sliders/knobs now send automation (before it was possible to automate them, but they didn't send it).
    Modulator synchronization can now be automated/modulated.
    Multi-band plugins: Bands can now be inserted before or after the selected one.
    Step sequencer grid now follows the number of steps.
    Plugin configurations and presets on Windows moved to MeldaProduction subfolder.
    Improved MStereoGenerator audio quality.
    Fix: Plugins could have failed AU validation when default settings contained upsampling of 2x or higher.
    Fix: Plugins sometimes caused high CPU usage on some CPUs when input was silent.
    Fix: Peak/loudness meters on easy screen were always showing real channels not affected by channel mode.
    Fix: MDynamics & MMultiBandDynamics was reporting look-ahead latency in "only-gain" mode.
    Fix: MDynamicEq & MAutoDynamicEq wasn't enabling a band-pass/notch band if the gain was 0.
    Fix: Vocoder could cause invalid gain under certain cirsumstances with LR encoding.
    Fix: Ranges of additional parameters associated to multiparameter didn't update when modulated.
    Fix: Keyboard input on Mac OS X with older Carbon interfaces sometimes generated backspaces instead of letters.
    Fix: MAutoDynamicEq, MDynamicEq and MAutoEqualizer analyzers were always showing "pre" analysis.
    Fix: MStereoGenerator could occasionally freeze on start-up in some hosts.
