,maxzamora,2012-11-06T22:42Z,"Hey hey!! Thanks for the upload!!! Not even a week and there's a pirate version. NOT SAYING THAT IS WRONG! Well, it is. But is good for us people that can't buy it :/
Can someone explain me why some ""peers"" have their info in a lightblue color?"
,Dpx008,2012-11-14T03:49Z,"@maxzamora: No problem. By the way, it took me exactly 3 hours after the album release to upload it here, wasn't long at all.
And I don't know why some peers are in blue, to be honest."
