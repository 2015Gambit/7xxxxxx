Original screens are larger people, look at them instead :)"
,sassekat,2012-10-30T05:00Z,"Best one I have seen so far, Thanks !"
,hcfwesker,2012-10-30T06:09Z,"Oh my, YES!  Def better than the other versions i seen on here.  Great upload Acesn8c!  For a cam version, video quality was impressive, audio still a little mono, but definitely watchable."
,vampzcore,2012-10-31T03:47Z,thanks!!
,Mescwalrus,2012-10-31T20:34Z,"I paid to see this movie and it was a complete waste of fucking money.  If you have to see this piece of shit download a cam.  The whole time I sat thru this crap I laughed at the bad acting, terrible story, and the best part was the ending cause the fucking shit was over."

,Malkuriotes,2012-11-06T03:15Z,"This movie is one of best i saw, but quality is really low so i went to searched better quality version and found really nice one wich u can stream and download plus it works on PS3. check here film.crctvn.org"
,Mescwalrus,2012-11-10T07:57Z,"Id rather watch the original Halloween, Friday the 13th, or my mom give a blow job than watch this horrible shit again."
,Cleric21,2012-11-11T08:34Z,"Don't let Mesc's complaints deter you from this movie. This was actually a really great film, and even though it's no classic like the Elm St. or Halloween Series, it's definitely one of the scariest horror films I've seen in the past few years (although that isn't saying much.) Just hearing him say Friday the 13th was a good scare should give you an idea of how terrible his taste is..."
,Mescwalrus,2012-11-11T16:29Z,Saying this movie is good is like saying Barney or gay porn is good.
