,03storic,2012-10-31T13:17Z,You need the correct codec's installed.
,codyormoe,2012-10-31T13:29Z,"There was something different about this file, all previous downloads from eztv play on my PS3 with no issues, this one I only had audio, no video."
,calvinso,2012-11-01T04:26Z,codyormoe is right. All previous downloads are fine no matter what show. This particular file tonight was different even to those for other shows tonight.
,DiabloTheCritic,2012-11-01T04:45Z,The audio is out of sync with video content. First time ever I have had this problem. Not worth downloading
,saintwazza,2012-11-01T08:18Z,The file is not complete.My completed video files show a video thumbnail but this is showing just the VLC logo.Plays on PC but not on media server or DVD player.Wait for repack or download the avi as it works fine.
