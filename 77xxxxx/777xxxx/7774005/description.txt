Travel Documentary hosted by Henry Cole, published by Travel Channel UK in 2007 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

If there is a journey that encapsulates the riding of the American Dream it has to be US Highway 1. Starting in San Francisco the 650 mile route hugs some of the most breathtaking coastline in the Americas and winds its way through a visual, emotional and often spiritual dichotomy that is California. Henry sets out on his quintessential American custom to ride and reveal both the unbelievable scenery and attractions en route but also to give an insight into the often tumultuous historical background that has made this route so fascinating today. Highway One is the ribbon of road that instigated the true concept of freedom and Henry's journey starts where it all began with the Beatniks and hippies in San Francisco. Heading out of San Francisco Henry experiences what this breathtaking coastline is all about, surf, sea and serenity in equal proportions.
