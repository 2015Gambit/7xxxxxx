    Best Buy Bonus tracks to Anberlin's stellar new release Vital.

    Vital restores the ferocious yet intelligent edge that made Amberlin's early
    releases stand out from the ranks of typical Christian rock. Reunited with
    original producer Aaron Sprinkle, the quintet flexes real musical muscle as
    it explores themes both personal and political. The album transcends the
    confines of emo-pop with hard-punching tracks powered by the punishing drum
    work of Nathan Young. Stephen Christian continues to show an uncommon
    ability to combine raw force with emotional nuance as lead singer. Searing
    tunes like ôSelf-Starterö and polished ballads like ôInnocenceö are
    delivered with conviction. VitalÆs sonic mix of brawny æ90s-esque rock
    guitar, well-sculpted melodies, and atmospheric electronica frames lyrics
    that range from urgent anti-war pleas (ôSomeone Anyoneö) to prayerful
    ruminations (ôOther Sideö) and angry breakup tirades (ôDesires"). The
    showstopper here is the closing track, ôGod, Drugs & Sex,ö a darkly tender
    dissection of a tormented relationship featuring the honeyed guest vocals of
    Christie DuPree. Anberlin here achieves a heroic sound that should impress
    old and new fans alike.
