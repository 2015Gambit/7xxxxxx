a number of different languages, including Russian, French, German, Spanish, Hungarian, and Arabic.
First movie has mostly French, the 2-nd and third are mostly ENGLISH spoken.
YOU HAVE TO USE SUBTITLES!

**Unfortunately, subtitles only appear when English isn't spoken, which is somewhat disappointing as many of the important characters in the film are not native English-speakers and have rather thick accents.
All subtitles have timing improved (longer time at longer text etc).
You may want to set the position of the subs lower, like in pic bellow set in MPC "Screen Alignment":   http://imgbox.com/g/3wJn7qUKYr
