Firemin.

Firefox still uses more memory than most other web browsers. Truthfully, the amount it uses is ridiculous. Firefox can use up to 500MBs of memory if you keep it running. In addition, you will see that the memory usage keeps rising because of, you guessed it, memory leaks. Some Firefox users even reported memory usage over 1000MBs. That is half of the memory gone on most computers.

So, is there a solution? The answer is simple, Firemin. You will see its effectiveness almost instantly and the best part is that it is completely free. To use Firemin; you will need to download the Firemin.exe file, decompress it and run Firemin.exe from the extracted folder.

What this little program does is amazing: Mozilla never uses more than 2Mb of memory!

By the way way, is Freeware... So, no crack, no serial...
