READ THE NFO

ADDITIONAL NOTES

Don't run the game from exe directly, or game will crash. Use the start
or desktop icon."
,chaosstar23,2012-11-02T07:54Z,"@NaNaMoose and GObonzo,
controller keyboard fix, navigate to,prgram file/nordic games/Painkiller Hell and Damnation/Engine/Config open BaseEditorKeyBindings in notepad. highlight where it says false and paste True over it everywhere it says false. save the edited ersion to your desktop. delete old BaseEditorKeyBindings and move new one from desktop into where the old one was, now you will be able to use the controller and keyboard and mouse. works even on a madcatz with button icons showing up in tutorial. cheers."

,marcellocamargo,2012-11-02T16:49Z,anyone know how to operate the co-op mode? when I enter this option it says that I do not have the 'downloadble content '
,matt7109,2012-11-03T00:47Z,"WTF!! There is no crack folder here, does NOT work for me."
,whateverthefuck,2012-11-03T02:46Z,"matt7109 is a troll who pastes the same comment in every thread, pay no attention to him."
,matt7109,2012-11-03T03:18Z,whateverthefuck is a wanker who talks out of his shitty arse. There is NO crack here.
,51Sb,2012-11-03T03:24Z,"@chaosstar23:

I did exactly as you have stated, and it still doesn't work for me. I'll be trying nosTEAM's version, when the download finishes, because this is looking like a total bust.

Win7x64, by the by."
,matt7109,2012-11-03T03:24Z,"whateverthefuck is a total wanker who talks out of his shitty arse, there is NO crack here, it does NOT work."
,51Sb,2012-11-03T03:51Z,"I'm not the only one who thinks that ""whateverthefuck"" and ""matt7109"" are the same person, am I?

Oh wait, I couldn't care less, because none of it is related to this torrent. At all. Seriously. Stop it, it's not even silly, it's retarded.

My personal problem, that being my keybinds and controller being entirely inoperative, is still unfixed, even with the suggestion on page 1."
,51Sb,2012-11-03T03:57Z,"matt7109 is whateverthefuck, calling it now.

Besides, none of this is related at all to the torrent, it's just idiotic bickering clogging up the comments section, to be used for either issues with the torrent that are actual issues, not something that is frequently caused by being too stupid to check your own antivirus for quarantining the crack."
,matt7109,2012-11-03T05:26Z,"Ermm Ahem, I sincerely apologise to Extremezone, i had opened it as an image file and it installed with no crack, but when i unpacked it with Winrar then the crack appeared, works perfect as usual, very sorry EZ :-("
,Zecimala,2012-11-03T09:57Z,Matt7109 you are sooo dumb ...
,AnonPony37,2012-11-03T11:19Z,How about you upload Assassin's Creed III too?
,matt7109,2012-11-03T14:09Z,"To Zecimala, yes i know i am a total dumb mo fo, once again, i am very sorry EZ, keep up the great work, this torrent works perfectly, unzip, install, copy crack, enjoy people."
,tofumunch,2012-11-03T14:42Z,hell yeah it's back!!!
,FabZPT,2012-11-03T16:27Z,@AnonPony37 Assassins Creed III is not yet for pc :b

If you can't get it to work, you're too dumb to be on the internet downloading things.
You're using up air that the sick, old people and plants need.
Go kill yourself."
