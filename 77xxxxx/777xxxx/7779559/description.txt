CHAINED GIRLS - 1965

Starring Joel Holt as "The Narrator"

Directed by Joseph P. Mawra
Produced by George Weiss

2 AVI (Xvid) files, the feature film (60 minutes) and the trailer.

A documentary by the makers of the "Olga" films (WHITE SLAVES OF CHINATOWN, OLGA'S GIRLS, OLGA'S HOUSE OF SHAME). Similar in style are "Chained Girls" and the "Olga" films, beautiful black and white photography, lots of narration, no dialogue and an effective classical music soundtrack.

Exposes the secret world of the Lesbian, how she lives and loves.

Hilariously awful, self-contradictory and ludicrous script, sounds like an essay written the day it's due by a 6th grader on the bus to school, delivered by narrator Holt with perfect seriousness. Phony statistics and dumb graphics give the adult-theater-going public the lowdown on lesbians.

All in all, a very enjoyable way to pass an hour.
