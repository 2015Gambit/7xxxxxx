,MalevolentLoki,2012-11-01T21:21Z,Thanks a lot for what it is its great.  I'm not going to complain at all.
,joegreg13,2012-11-01T21:38Z,watchable I would say about 5 for both. It is not really legends fault it was the movie itself. It is too dark for a great cam of it. 
,culatr,2012-11-02T03:12Z,"@ sodiumbicarbonate - Hey ass hat, what have you done lately to contribute???  Ya pretty much what I thought.  You don't like it don't download it ""you fuck"""
,OSX-User,2012-11-02T04:21Z,"@sodiumbicarbonate- raped this movie??? rape is the human way idiot. take what you want, give nothing back. women, resources, money, its all human nature. if you weren't like that, why would you be illegally downloading fresh movies in the first place? takes a rapist to know a rapist!"
,captcha55,2012-11-02T10:52Z,"good job LegendET, its in english and in sync. the movie itself is dark so blamin the cam talk doesnt hold any footin. good job again LegendET "
,SomeGuy1999,2012-11-02T11:54Z,"I am wondering, Is this a cam recording of the 3 D version of the movie?? 
Is it possible to actually view this on a 3D TV?? otherwise what is the point of recording the 3D version, it will just be blurry, as a 3D movie looks like to the Naked eye"
,kazmandu,2012-11-03T02:13Z,"A - 7

V - 4"
,Hitchslap79,2012-11-03T09:32Z,"A-8
V-3
M-Well that's up to you, isn't it?

Definitely filmed off a 3D showing. Blurry as hell. Thanks regardless!"
,freeforlife,2012-11-03T14:20Z,"Audio is passable,but the video is very bad,thanks for the effort.It looks like it is the 3d version cleaned up to me.The movie lighting is dark and we know how dark movies look when camed...
I will probably go to the theater to watch this or wait a BR print."
,LucasLockford,2012-11-03T14:27Z,"@SomeGuy1999 - it is filmed off a 3D version, yes. No, you can't watch it on a 3D TV (as long as I know). The movie is very blurry in some scenes, but it was watchable enough imo.

I've been dying to watch this movie and it wasn't released in my country, so thank you, LegendET, for making it avaiable to me. It was good enough for now. Video is very dark, but audio is good."
,noonelovesme,2012-11-03T18:22Z,"absolutely unwatchable, even in tiny resolution. dark and blurry as hell, but at least the audio is decent for a cam. for those who are interested in the story it's an acceptable torrent, thank you!

,5p1n47,2012-11-05T02:31Z,"ya its shitty that its too dark for a good cam......there have been a few....dark knight, pirates 4....just too dark the whole movie"
,kavu_rider,2012-11-06T05:15Z,"3D + CAM Blurry = me go blind X_X

Thanks for the effort though."
