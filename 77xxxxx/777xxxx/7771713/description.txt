When ninjutsu master Hamato Yoshi (Splinter) and his four pet turtles are exposed to mutagen, a chemical from another world, 
they undergo major physical transformations: Splinter becomes a hybrid human/rat and the turtles become human/turtle hybrids. 
Splinter retreats to the New York City sewers, where he raises the four turtles as his sons, and imparts to them his knowledge 
of ninjutsu. After venturing to the surface for the first time, the teenage Turtles discover an alien race is taking over 
New York City, and they learn Splinter's old enemy, the Shredder, seeks to track down Splinter and his sons, to put an end to their clan.
