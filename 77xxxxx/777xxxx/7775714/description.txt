Issues 0-29 of 'Madame Xanadu' V2

Vertigo/DC Comics, 2008-2011 (and it's my understanding that the only reason it was cancelled is because they wanted to bring Madame X back into the New 52 world, instead of letting her continue to live in the Vertigo world where she didn't really interact with any of their other properties)
