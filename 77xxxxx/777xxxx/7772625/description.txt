The Jimi Hendrix Experience was an English-American psychedelic rock band that formed
in London in October 1966. Comprising eponymous singer-songwriter and guitarist
Jimi Hendrix, bassist and backing vocalist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell,
the band was active until June 1969, in which time the group released three successful
studio albums. After Redding left the band, Hendrix and Mitchell stayed together through
other projects. The Experience 'reunited' in 1970 with Billy Cox dubbed "The Cry of Love",
until Hendrix's death in September 1970. Redding died in 2003, and Mitchell became the
last original member of the band to die, in November 2008.
