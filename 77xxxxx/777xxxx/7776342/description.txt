Summary
Unwrapping her talent for creating ΓÇ£scintillating wit and heart-stopping sensualityΓÇ¥ (Library Journal ), Sabrina Jeffries gives readers a gift to cherish: a touching new novel of an unexpected Christmas reunionΓÇösparked by a cunning ruse, family secrets, and the mysterious ways of the heart.

Dear Sir,
. . . I feel I should inform you that your mother is very ill. If you wish to see her before it is too late, you should come at once.
Sincerely,
Mrs. Camilla Stuart

Pierce Waverly, the Earl of Devonmont, has led an unabashed rogueΓÇÖs life, letting no woman near his heart. Inexplicably abandoned as a child to be raised by distant relatives, he never forgave his parents, refusing to read any of his motherΓÇÖs letters after his fatherΓÇÖs death. Then came a letter that shook his resolve. A Christmas visit to Montcliff might prove his last chance to discover the truth of his past, and come to terms with the stranger he calls ΓÇ£Mother.ΓÇ¥

But two surprises await him at Montcliff. His mother is perfectly healthy, nowhere near a deathbed, as her meddling ladyΓÇÖs companion led him to believe. The second is Camilla Stuart herself, a lively vicarΓÇÖs widow, too bright and beautiful not to arouse the scoundrel in Pierce. Though she alone is reason enough to prolong his stay, he is soon faced with other tantalizing riddles: What secrets lie in his motherΓÇÖs past to explain his childhood abandonment? Why is the captivating Mrs. Stuart so determined to mend the breach between mother and son? Meanwhile,
Camilla herself is caught up in loveΓÇÖs complications since the arrival of the irresistible earl. As his bold flirtation and suggestive whispers draw her dangerously close, can anything protect her vulnerable heart? If they are destined to share real happiness, there must be honesty between themΓÇöyet telling him the truth about her own life may shatter that chance.
None of them can predict the startling revelations to come. Or the secrets, both heartening and shocking, divulged between a mother and son, and between two lovers haunted by their respective pasts, that will make Christmas night at Montcliff one to rememberΓÇöand the glorious night after, one to treasure for a lifetime.
