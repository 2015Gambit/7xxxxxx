1992 reissue of the 1988 (DDD) recording of Joe Pass guitar solos...music associated

with iconic dancer Fred Astaire who had expired in 1987.

Ripped from a low quality CDR (short strategy) which fortunately hadn't yet

begun to deteriorate.  As data, this delightful music can live on...safe

from the hazards of cheap media.
