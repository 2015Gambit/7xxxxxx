Best Indie Collection 2012

This is a compilation of the best Indie music that I have found over this year.  I've done a lot of research through Pitchfork.  This is the music that really stood out to me.

I tried keeping it away from the mainstream, but there are some mainstream hits in there.  

This is torrent is awesome if you just want to hear something NEW.

Thanks.

Please comment for new bands, questions, concerns, thanks
