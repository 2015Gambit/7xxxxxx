Wing and a Prayer [1944]

An aircraft carrier is sent on a decoy mission around the Pacific, with orders
to avoid combat, thus lulling Japanese alertness before the battle of Midway.
All the men have their individual worries and concerns, but become increasingly
frustrated at their avoidance of combat, for reasons unknown to them. But in
the end, all get their chance to fight.
