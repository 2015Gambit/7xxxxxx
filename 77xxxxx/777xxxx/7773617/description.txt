Description:
Need for Speed: Most Wanted - a mad race through a huge open city full of street racers as well as police officers. The update Autolog makes it easy to track all activities (races, jumping on trampolines, passages at tremendous speeds past the camera, etc.) of your friends and compare them with their achievements.

Multiplayer redesigned so that, for the race, do not need to go to the idle screen and wait for the arrival, looking at the table of participants. It's fairly easy to come to the place of the race, and after crossing the finish line you can turn around and try to ram the laggards.
