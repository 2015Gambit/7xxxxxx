NOTES:

video ...like HP's other releases the video has borders and a small res.The contrast is also really low on this,however
that does mean less of a glare than the last few.Some slight cam movement half way through the film and you get a slanted
border across the top ....otherwise not a bad cam really .Top stuff bro ;-)
Audio ....Once again jiinx shoots and scores,same as uniques sync work.....If honest i would say this line is not as good
as the last few BUT still decent line.
The audio seemed a little low and some hiss to it....but otherwise nice :)


WORKDONE:

Firstly cropped the borders to the lowest point ,to remove the slanted border that appears half way through the film as it was
only a extra 5-6 pixels ...From there i upscaled the video to a higher res and one that fixed the AR.
Like i always say,doing this makes ANY faults stand out alot more...so needed a smoother to remove alot of noise,also then i needed
to tweak the contrast rising it alot and then i actually lowered the brightness and lowered the intes.
Also lowered the sat and changed the rgb colours slightly....before adding some sharpness back.
Finally stripped the audio and cleaned it up a touch in AA before resyncing back to our rip.

Side note,we will be doing a V2 with  matines 720p video ....however it doesn't mean it will be better than this,becuase BOTH faults
have good and bad parts to them so .....
V2 more than likely later tomorrow as real work calls i'm afraid :(

Enjoy folks :)
