Please seed when you're done downloading. I do have a 5Mbps upload but there are a lot of leechers."
,lazycat,2012-11-04T04:42Z,"Some episodes have problems - Web Weirdos is a bit glitchy but watchable, and Goliad is incomplete (last few minutes are missing/corrupt). Most of them work OK."
,SystemDisc,2012-11-10T06:36Z,That's odd.... I'll see what I can do to fix that and create a new torrent.
,SystemDisc,2012-11-22T03:25Z,"If you could please list the episodes that you're having problems with, I'd be happy to fix them and upload a new torrent. If you don't list the episodes, I'll do my best to find them myself and re-upload."
,SystemDisc,2012-11-22T03:34Z,I'm in the process of downloading all of season 4 in 720p from a CRON release. It's full HD the contents of the release (NFO) can be found here: https://binsearch.info/viewNFO.php?oid=89923117 I will be re-uploading the torrent shortly.
,SystemDisc,2012-11-22T04:06Z,It seems my source had corruption. There are now complete versions of this season in other torrents on TPB. Use those instead. Sorry for the inconvenience.
,SystemDisc,2012-11-25T06:17Z,"Just to clarify: this torrent works fine. Everything is entirely watchable, there are only a few episodes that skip, and one episode (the Goliad episode) that cuts out early."
