Same here"
,not.me,2012-11-02T18:24Z,It's caused by some older versions leftovers in registry. I already tried every possible solution I found and nothing. It's the same with 2010/2007. It's time to back to good old 2003.

1.  install office 2013 (make sure it's rtm version)
2.  use user reed26's key KDVQM-HMNFJ-P9PJX-96HDF-DJYGX (better hurry before it gets blocked)
3.  phone activation (or you can post the installation id code to see if anyone can help)

good luck"

,ck19,2012-11-20T06:51Z,"First, thank you so much for uploading this. However, I'm having a problem getting it activated. I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. When I call the activation line, it asks for nine sets of numbers, not eight as displayed by the users below. Any help would be deeply appreciated, my dear friends. Again, many thanks for this upload! 

P.S. I already had Office 2010 installed with the KMS crack. That KMS stopped working for some reason. When I installed Office 2013 from this torrent, I chose ""custom install"" and ""keep existing office install"" is this the problem? 

I've also tried the activator for 2013 but that doesn't work. In some instances, it reports it works, and then doesn't. Now, it is saying I cannot re-arm anymore because I don't have any left. Odd, indeed.

Here is my installation ID: Hopefully this will help. Thanks!
