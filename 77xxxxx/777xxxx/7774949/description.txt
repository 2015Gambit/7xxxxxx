          Patch included - Tested and working as it should - ENJ0Y !


TRAKTOR PRO 2 is the world-renowned, rock-solid 4-deck DJ software that gets you mixing straight out the box. Now with TRAKTOR 2 Technology Inside for enhanced ease-of-use, performance and creativity, this version boasts a new interface with TruWave colored waveforms for a visually rich experience of your music. Simpler than ever to use, TRAKTOR PRO 2 also sees the arrival of the new Sample Decks and Loop Recorder features for ultimate mix creativity.

New Creative Weapons
TRAKTOR’s intelligent features now allow for even easier remixing of tracks on the fly. Switch any deck to a Sample Deck and load up to four loops or one-shot samples each – 16 in total. The new Loop Recorder can record loops from mixer channels, master out or audio interface inputs, while four much-requested new effects, including Tape Delay and Bouncer, round out the arsenal to more than 30 performance effects.

Get In The Mix
Crate Flick cover art browsing and full iTunes® and iPod® integration makes finding the right track effortless. TRAKTOR’s acclaimed sync concept ensures that your tunes beatmatch perfectly so you can focus on the more exciting performance aspects of DJing.
TRAKTOR PRO 2’s built-in mixer integrates multiple EQ and filter types, giving you full control of the frequency spectrum.

Total Flexibility
Use any combination of MIDI controllers such as TRAKTOR KONTROL X1, or your keyboard and mouse to control the software. The new Auto Detection makes connecting and disconnecting your NI audio interface easy – even while there are tracks playing in TRAKTOR. Assisted by the Setup Wizard with a drop-down menu, just select your interface and it assigns inputs and outputs for you. TRAKTOR PRO 2 is highly customizable with multiple, savable layouts and flexible hot key selection to suit your needs.
