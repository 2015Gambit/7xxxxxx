,mchlclark,2012-11-01T01:54Z,"Australian movies are actually quite good. The problem I had was that they were nothing like U.S movies which dominate the market, so which we all mostly see and are brainwashed by. The problem with Australian Movies mostly is they make them for Australians. Unless you were born here most people just wont get it. I think Australia should lift there game on this point."

,TimothyArcher13,2012-11-04T21:17Z,"It's Jason Stackhouse from True Blood! I liked his last film ""Griff the Invisible"" which was also an Australian film so I hope this one is as good."
,titus227,2012-11-09T06:40Z,"I find most Australian movies suck not because they don't follow 'Mainstream Hollywood', but because the dialogue is unbelievable and clunky and besides Paul Hogan, I'm not sure if there has ever been an 'Australian Hero', most of them in the movies just cower and hide until the killer eventually finds and kills them.  Furthermore, I understand that The Outback is in Australia, but it's a very depressing backdrop, and those movies just keep panning it like it's the Swiss Alps or a South American Rain Forest.  Lastly, the mannerisms in the actors in Australian movies remind me of a live action 'Wallace & Gromit' impression.  I appreciate dry humor, but when the humor is so dry that the joke is that they never made one, well, that's not comedy.  "
,jess_90,2012-11-12T02:54Z,He actually started out on Home & Away and then eventually landed the role on True Blood :) Aussie humour isnt for everyone lol Good Movie!

,jiggaman82,2012-11-16T09:07Z,"Candy. Chopper. The Castle. Gettin Square. Dirty Deeds. Dogs in Space. Romper Stomper. The Proposition. Mad max (1&2). Kenny. Two Hands. Animal Kingdom. 10 Canoes. I love you too, and Little fish. All brilliant movies (in my humble opinion) to name a few to come out of this great country, but yes we do produce a lot of shit ones as well, but show me a country that doesnt. No matter where you come from, theres cinematic gold everywhere, you just gotta know where to look...or ask the right geek"
