                     Your uploads are always genuine and superb. Could you pl. try uploading with keys or activator, as others are not reliable. Pl. oblige, Sir."

,biggggdan,2012-11-11T17:19Z,"Hey ChattChittio i love your uploads anydvd rocks i really appreciate you uploading their updates fast too!

That being said i just wanted to mention i wasnt able to decrypt Amazing Spiderman with it so i went on search for free programs (which usually are worthless) but i found BD Free Decrypter and it worked great. it basically does same thing as anydvd loads bluray and decrypts it.

I will always try anydvd first cause its my favorite just wanted to mention this if anyone else in this community runs into issues with any bluray though (usually happens on brand new ones).  Keep up the great work ChattChitto!"
