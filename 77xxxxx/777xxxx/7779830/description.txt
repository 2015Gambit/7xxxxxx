    The real deal--as always. Seed throughout the holidays and enjoy.  
                              
     From the University of Uncle Jerry.  Another underground creation from us to you because we care.

  This is Windows 8 Enterprise Edition operating on a 64GB USB.  (ANY 64GB or larger USB)  We make things that boot.

 Windows is activated PERMANENTLY. You will find that there are 50+GB of space available for the installment of additional software. No modifications have been made besides the activation.  Installing to a USB just takes a couple of mouse clicks using the included usb tool.

  Should you ever aquire a KB update or "gift" from microsoft that changes anything, simply reinstall to your usb device and you are back to square one.
