,apeg,2012-11-03T00:12Z,"this is a great release for an R5, but to give the audio a 10 is nuts...

lets be honest here, if this is a 10 then what will the DVD or BR rip be? an 11? 12?... you see my point, I've have heard much worse but to call this a 10 breaks this very simple system some seem not to fully understand"
,androidboy13,2012-11-03T00:22Z,"the reason why the ratings are all different is dependent on the player they use. to get a good experience with this torrent, YOU NEED THE RIGHT MOVIE PLAYER, experience might still vary from everyone

windows media player: V-7 A-7 (loses synch when you skim through the scenes)

quicktime: don't bother

KM player: V-7 (very dark and pixely at times) A-9

the best one VLC player: V-10 A-9
however BE CAREFUL when you try to download this, I got the Claro browser hijacker when I installed the player. but after deleting it, vlc works fine now!

hope this helps!"

,ScottyD7421,2012-11-03T10:12Z,"First and foremost a big thanks scene4all for uploading, much appreciated.

The picture was fine and there were no sync issues however i found the audio a little off, it was though the audio was dubbed over the entire movie? I could be wrong and it is just my opinion but to me it sounded off. Anyhoo, apart from that is was very watch-able.

Again, many thanks for uploading :-)"

,skulldragon,2012-11-04T01:20Z,"There's nothing wrong with this video, it's good enough. It's just your low quality monitor or TV.
And sound was perfect too, no whisper talk, no skyrocketing on action.

Movie is ""something new"", finally, and has some new jokes."

M:? (has gotten good reviews elsewhere)

only saw the sample, but i definitely am gona wait for a better release. the video is a little dark and pixeled, but at least watchable. the audio though sounds awful. its like trying to use old iphone earbuds as speakers for an entire room. definitely wait for a better quality release, unless you're the type of person who doesn't mind cam quality audio (and hardly better video as well)."
