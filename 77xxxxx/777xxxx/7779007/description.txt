A lot of these could probably benefit from a restoration, but I just spent a good deal of time removing scanner tags from the FRONT of books (man I hate that!), and to be honest, the muddy, grey and old look actually works on these books. Plus, if I did one, I'd have to do them all, and that would more than double the size of torrent (likely, closer to triple it). 


Deadworld

Deadworld is an ongoing American comic book currently published by Desperado Publishing in association with (currently) IDW Publishing.

The series follows survivors in a post-apocalyptic scenario brought on by zombie attacks. Led by King Zombie, Deadworld brings forth a different slant than just humans slaughtering zombies.
