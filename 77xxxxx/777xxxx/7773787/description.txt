::PRESS RELEASE:: 

A sequence of beautiful dreams ... 

Zymosis is a psychedelic-ambient project which has brought it's own bright light to psy-culture over the past 14 years.
 
Four years ago these Ukranian pioneers debuted with "Elements Into Data", an album that became widely cherished among psychillers, Goaheads, and ambient lovers alike.
 This release gave us a unique organic experience comprised of world music inspirations and shamanic sounds seamlessly fused with elements of psychedelic trance.
 
Now arrives the long awaited followup "Between Two Points"! 

With this newest offering, expect nothing less than a fantastic emotional album featuring remixes of Shulman's widely acclaimed track "The Unexpected Visitor", a solid collaboration with Seamoon, and last but not least a nice melodic track from their first album remixed by none other than Micky Noise.
 
Enjoy!
