PLOT

Joy. Ecstasy. A spiritual high. These words describe the exhilaration
of diving a pristine coral reef in Coral Reef Adventure. Ocean explorers
Howard and Michele Hall turn their love for the ocean and their concern
for the future of te world's coral reefs into action. With Jean-MIchel
Cousteau, deep reef scientist Richard Pyle and Fijian diver Rusi Vulakoro,
the Halls explore and capture on film the dazzling underwater world of
coral reefs, magical places here on Earth.

The lilting music of the South Pacific, in a tropical blend with Crosby,
Stills & Nash, will surprise and delight you. Expect to laugh - expect
to fall in love with the reefs - and expect your heart to ache at the
tragic, irretrievable loss of these fragile worlds. Very few movies
change our world view. This is one of those few.
