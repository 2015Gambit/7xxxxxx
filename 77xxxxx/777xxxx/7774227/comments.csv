how come you aren't getting the show from your old source anymore? not that its a problem, im just curious :P"
[T],MsFenmore,2012-10-30T21:09Z,I´m still getting it...but last week one day it was totally messed up and yesterday there were no shows ( B&B and Y&R) because of the news about the storm...! Hope with todays shows it will be back to normal...cause I like the other source better!! 
,disneydreams,2012-10-30T22:38Z,"thanks

I'm trying to find some of the older b&B and y&R can anyone tell me where i can download them at? I tried to here but there weren't any seeders."
,zoniezz,2012-10-31T00:45Z,Thank you
,bleslie1,2012-10-31T00:56Z,Msfenmore is the only one i know who offers them. Im not sure why they wouldnt download for you. They always work for me just fine
,MsMuffet,2012-10-31T06:17Z,MsFenmore ... Hoping that you are safe and sound during this terrible storm. Thank you for all your efforts in bringing us the episodes - very kind of you. Cheers from Down Under! ;-) ALSO got to say that the Stephanie 2-week flashbacks are BOLD GOLD! Enjoying them enormously and makes me nostalgic for the original cast.

,Dimmis80,2012-10-31T13:30Z,"I angree with MsMuffet  the flashbacks are very sweet and wonderfull for maybe the best actor of Bold..And she was a very beautifull woman,she still,is for us the older BATB viewers to remember and for the new to learn all about the history of bold.And ofcorse i think that MSFenmore is from Germany so she is very safe and stuff and no wories there but if she is from the states i will hope and pray for our friend to be safe and sound..MsFenmore u rule girl and God bless.;-)"
[T],MsFenmore,2012-10-31T17:07Z,Yeah thanks guys...I´m fine...and yes I ´m from Germany..so no reason to worry...:-)
,disneydreams,2012-10-31T23:03Z,"to bleslie1 i can get the newer ones, but the ones from a month ago on i cant get to download. i put them up but there is never any seeders. so thought maybe she still had them and i could gt them
thanks for your help"
