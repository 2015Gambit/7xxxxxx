Are we alone in the universe or have we been visited by aliens?
If the answer to the last question is yes, have the world's
governments been covering up this incredible 'truth'?

Comedian Andrew Maxwell is a logical guy and he is going to
tackle these big questions on an American road trip from
Los Angeles to Area 51. He is taking five UFO believers who
claim to have witnessed spacecraft from other galaxies, been
attacked by UFOs, had close encounters with ETs and believe
an alien attack is imminent for a close encounter of the
rational kind. Andrew takes them to meet experts, eyewitnesses
and journalists to see if he can dispel the myths around
UFO sightings.
