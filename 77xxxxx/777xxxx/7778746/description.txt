So it's the end of october, which also concludes Cinemassacres yearly movie review marathon Monster Madness. This year's theme was the 80s. And here are the movies:

Galaxy of Terror (1981)
Q - The Winged Serpent (1982)
Nightbeast (1982)
Twilight Zone - The Movie (1983)
The Deadly Spawn (1983)
The Toxic Avenger (1984)
The Stuff (1985)
Making Contact (1985)
Teen Wolf (1985)
Spookies (1986)
TerrorVision (1986)
From Beyond (1986)
The Gate (1987)
Pumpkinhead (1988)
Puppetmaster (1989)
Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988)

I did not make any of the rips myself, only the compiling. Most of them are DVD-rips around 700 megs, a few are VHS, one is blue ray (Teen Wolf).

All movies are in english. There are no subtitles.

There are no kind of archiving used, so you easily can select single movies to donwload if you like.

On a footnote; this distribution is in no way endorsed by Cinemassacre or James Rolfe and does not include any rips of his review videos. However, you can find them all on this URL:

Enjoy.
