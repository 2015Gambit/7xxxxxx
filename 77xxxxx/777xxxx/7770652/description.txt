This is the demo of the recently published third Raidy game.

As the title suggests, this is the unmodified TRIAL version of the game. I don't have the full version and I'm not going to upload it, so don't ask for it please. 


Also, the game is in Japanese, so if the trial refuses to work use Applocale or change your system locale to Japanese. If you don't know how to do that, Google is your friend.

This trial is also freely available from the developers' website free of charge: http://www.zyx-game.co.jp/newsoft/raidy3/index.html

However, downloading an 1.8 GB file with direct download can be problematic for people with slow and/or unreliable net connection. That's why I've created this torrent.

My upload speed isn't the best either, but I'll seed this until the end of the year at least. Please, help me seed once you've finished downloading.
