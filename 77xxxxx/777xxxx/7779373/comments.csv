I really have to thank Magz again for this episode.
If not for her, I may have done my head in trying to do a webrip of it!!!
@treko- I will upload more Take Me Out soon. I didn't continue with it because it didn't have that many downloads and nobody requested more. Should be up in next couple of days :)"
