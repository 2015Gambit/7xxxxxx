NOTES:

Nice video by HP ...got the normal issues of borders,wrong AR,glare and colours off,quite pinky on this one.....also a small resize,BUT with some TLC ;-)
Audio was nice,little low and some hiss on a few channels ...but for cam audio 
very nice

WORKDONE:

Cropped all the borders and then resize to fix AR and also upscaled it ...like normal this makes all faults stand out even more,so to correct them i had to use a HQ smoother on high settings,tweaked the rgb colours lowering the pink hue ALOT and balancing out the rest.Also slight tweak on contrast and brightness,lowered the intes to dull the glares before finally adding some sharpness back to it
Audio stripped,dropped in AA and gave it a little boost on the DB's and also 
tweaked the eq bands to lower the hiss,before
resaving as mp3 and resyncing to the encode



Enjoy folks
