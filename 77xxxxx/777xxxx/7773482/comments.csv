Is there any way you could put Slammin' Salmon (2009) on here in 1080p or 720p pretty please? :]"

I can understand using it on a 700MB low-res rip, but if you're going to make a high res version you need to use 6ch audio. I won't even DL a BRRIP if it doesn't have 6ch sound. It doesn't take any more time to do, you just need to learn to use a different setting for the audio. The file will be a little larger, but people who are going to DL a 1080p rip would prefer to have better audio and a larger file size rather than a smaller file with crappy audio. "
