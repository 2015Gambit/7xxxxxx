Match of the Day Two 28.10.2012

Duration: 1 Hour 20 Min

Colin Murray presents highlights of four Premier League games. The historic Merseyside derby will be as keenly contested as ever, with David Moyes keen to see Everton blossom into top-four Premier League contenders while Brendan Rogers works hard to build his own empire at Liverpool. Entertainment should also be in rich supply when Manchester United visit Chelsea. Last season, Sir Alex Ferguson's team launched a stirring fight-back to earn a hard-fought point at Stamford Bridge after being three goals down.

West Brom travel to Newcastle and Southampton host Tottenham, while Colin and guests also look back at the goals from Saturday's six matches.
