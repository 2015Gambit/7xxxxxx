Release Notes:
--------------

The late, great Douglas Adams surely needs no introduction. If you think he
does, then that's your loss, I'm afraid. Go hit Google, you philistine!

"Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy - The Complete Trilogy Of Five" is the full, official title of this 25 disc box set, commercially released in December of 2007.

The set features all five books in the Hitchhiker's series:

- Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy (disc 1 - 5)
- The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe (disc 6 - 10)
- Life, The Universe And Everything (disc 11 - 15)
- So Long, And Thanks For All The Fish (disc 16 - 19)
- Mostly Harmless (disc 20 - 25)

All were read by Martin Freeman (of The Office fame) who also starred in the recent motion picture version of the book; except the first book, which is read by actor Stephen Fry (Who, coincidentally was also in the flim, as 'The Book').

These versions of the books were recorded in 2005/2006, and are (according to the sleeve) mostly unabridged.

For the most part there are no chapter markers on the discs, and thus the tracklist below don't list chapters either.
