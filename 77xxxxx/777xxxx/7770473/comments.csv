[V],Nepotu,2012-10-29T14:04Z,"You're welcome, my french friend!"
,XYippie,2012-10-29T17:31Z,"@MTLGENTLEMAN, I hate to be a spoiler, but the freakin' Giants R-O-C-K-E-D Little Tony Romo last night. 4 Sacks, 2 Fumbles, 4 INTs, one pick-six, and another come-from-behind win by Eli. (Duplicated by his brother a few hours later.) Manning-Manning Super Bowl this year, I called it from Week One of pre-season.

Oh, BTW, Nepotu, you ARE the undisputed heavyweight champion of NFL uploaders."
,Lechuck93,2012-10-29T20:45Z,"Thank you xyippie.... NOT!

You just ruined the two games I wanted to watch this week. Great job!
Keep your f** spoilers to yourself or discuss them in forums for football, but not on a torrent where people want to see the games for themselves and not be told about the outcome.

Great job, again...."
[V],Nepotu,2012-10-29T21:10Z,"Thank you guyz! A little request, XYippie. Please, don't post spoilers. We need to respect eachother's choice. Please, man! Thank you for your understanding! Love you!"
,MTLGENTLEMAN,2012-10-30T14:52Z,Well said Nepotu ! Everyone enjoy this man's great work !!!
