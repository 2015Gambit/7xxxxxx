I followed all instructions, turned on background data, copy sd files, etc. but when i ran the game it says ""this application is not authorized for use on your android device."" Now I just read the comment above me but I can't seem to understand it or it doesn't seem to be helpful. I need help please. By the way, I am using a Samsung galaxy tab 7.0 plus (GT-P6200). thank you in advance."

step 1. download and right click the rar file and click ""extract to"" folder
step 2. after extraction is done then open the rar file (double click it)
step 3. go to com.ea.games.nfs13_na / files / published / textures / cars
step 4. open bentley_continental_gt_supersports_2011 folder
step 5. select all files, drag n drop them to the folder you extracted before

for instance, if earlier you extracted to desktop, then drag n drop the files to
....desktopcom.ea.games.nfs13_nafilespublishedtexturescarsbentley_continental_gt_supersports_2011

step 6. repeat the process for above mentioned folders
step 7. now copy the folder to androiddata
step 8. install apk
step 9. play the game

do note that the game needs internet connection...

hope this helps...."
