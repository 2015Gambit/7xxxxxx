 Heir to a billion-dollar automobile empire,   
 Rajveer Grewal has it all, a loving family,   
 riches of the world, and a dream job          
 designing cars. He falls head-over-heels      
 in love with Madhuri, who is a strong advocate
 of social justice and equality. To his        
 dismay, Rajveer learns that she 'hates'       
 all rich people and will have nothing to do   
 with a rich boy like himself. In a sweeping   
 stance of romance, Rajveer decides to give    
 it all up and pretend to be the 'poorest      
 of the poor' in order to win her affection    
 and love.
