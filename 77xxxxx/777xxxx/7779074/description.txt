This torrent should contain all packages for CrossOver, given away for free on 10/31/12 as part of the Flock The Vote 2012 event. There are 32-bit and 64-bit .deb packages, the RPM package, the .bin installer for whatever distro may use it, and the .zip with the Mac version. If you have any questions, post a comment. Enjoy!
