"Gardeners are passionate. We rejoice when seedlings push their green tips through the soil. We revel in the scent of jasmine on a summer evening. We are persistent in our struggle with garden pests and the weather, carefuly picking aphids from tomatoes and protecting lettuce plants from frost. We water, we fertilize, we coax, we coddle. And as flakes of snow descend on our barren backyards, many of us yearn for the opportunity to garden year-round in a greenhouse."
