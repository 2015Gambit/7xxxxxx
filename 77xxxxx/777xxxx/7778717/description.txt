Growing Vehetables In Home Gardens,
by David W. Sams, Professor Plant and Soil Science

"Gardening can be highly rewarding, but it is not
without problems and efforts. A successful garden re-
quires a good site, careful planning, good management
and considerable hard work. Insects, diseases and weeds
require control measures. Acidic, infertile, poorly drained
or sandy soil may have to be improved. Shade and
extremes of moisture and temperature are other problems
that must be overcome for a garden to be successful."
