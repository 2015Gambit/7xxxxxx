,pos610,2012-11-02T15:14Z,"Crash - 'setup/uninstall has stopped working' on random % done, precomp.exe stays in taskmgr, windows 7sp1 x64, first time happened, any ideas ? I've tried few times, deleting temp and game folder, booting with win services only and no additional apps, running setup xp sp2 mode as admin, used MicrosoftFixit.ProgramInstallUninstall, no problems found, tried installing from unpacked iso, same problem. Win logs show setup.tmp causing either unknown problem or problem caused by msvcrt.dll. torrent downloaded with no problems, no crc's during unpacking whatsoever. thanks in advance for any tips"
