I will release the others ten at a time each week or as time permits.

*I prefer .ape files as they save me about 10% space and I need it. For those who prefer flac files, converting from ape is no problem: lossless --> lossless = lossless. Most media players will do this, I use MediaMonkey. Standalone converters exist, also.I use xrecode. Any computer from the last 5 years can convert to the format of your choice in a matter of minutes (or less) for each CD.
