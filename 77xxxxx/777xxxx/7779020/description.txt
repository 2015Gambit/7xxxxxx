  Arriving just eight months after the whistling bard's sixth studio album, 2012's Break it Yourself, the eight-track companion piece Hands of Glory forgoes its predecessor's predilection for quirky, albeit homey, slabs of stately, professorial indie folk-pop in favor of a more authentic and rootsy approach. Produced in the same Luddite fashion as Break it Yourself (old pals, old barn), Hands of Glory takes that austerity one step further by recording all of the proceedings on a single microphone, resulting in a set that sounds both out of time and incredibly immediate.
