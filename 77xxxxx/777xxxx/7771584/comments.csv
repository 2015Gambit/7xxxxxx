,casstin,2012-10-30T22:20Z,"Don't waste your time on this. It says ""encoded from Web-Dl"" it's not actually a WEB-DL release, but some crappy recode."
[T],mf-den,2012-10-31T13:28Z,"@casstin: Before mouthing did u actually bother checking the quality of the encode, or are u one of those douches who fail to understand the meaning of encoding and just looks at the size and decides the quality, yeah re-encoding from a Web-Dl need not make my release a 'Web-Dl', but I guarantee its  quality is almost similar to the original. Then again it makes me wonder why u would bother coming to my page at all, if u understood the meaning of encoding"
