When a rogue neuropathologist makes a startling breakthrough - literally isolating the root of all evil in the recesses of the human brain - he'll stop at nothing to advance his theory. With the help of a naive Hollywood actress, a tormented motion picture director, and a condemned serial killer, Dr. Wolfe Brunswick launches a bold experiment in the Nevada desert, the outcome of which could transform humanity forever. The Truman Show meets Se7en in Syndrome, an inventive, original graphic novel.
