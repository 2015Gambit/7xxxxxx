,uchimichi,2012-10-30T10:07Z,"THANKS a lot man!! It works like a charm :)
By the way, after installing the APK and copying the SD data.. I opened the application and it said that in order to play the game, I had to download some files first.. Pressed OK and instant happiness!!

-Motorola RAZR 4.0.4, no root-

,SceneModz,2012-10-31T05:18Z,"I installed everything properly however the game is cramped in the lower right hand of my tablet.I tried ""stretching it to fit screen"" but it still only shows in the lower part of my screen about the size of a phone screen.Any solutions?"
,norhstarr,2012-10-31T09:54Z,"I installed this and it was working great until about 10 minutes into the game, i change screens and it takes me to a screen says additional files must be downlaoded to play.  The problem is the download keeps saying connection error.  Everything else is working fine and my connection is fine it just will not downlaod and not let me move forward.    Any ideas?"
,obrb51536,2012-10-31T13:40Z,"If I am not using an SD card, do i still need the SD data?"
,goda678,2012-10-31T15:30Z,Works fine until you first go to the past and get past the first little area. It then request for more data to be downloaded and refuses. 
,sickcityxiii,2012-10-31T15:45Z,"Same problem as others.

After Crono jumps into the rift at the fair, the game requests more data after a couple battles/screens.

Constantly fails with ""A connection error has occured""

Boo-urns !!!!"
,omgstfu12,2012-11-01T22:03Z,"Yeah same exact issue here. Game installs fine, downloads/installs first set of additional data fine, then about 10 minutes in, when i first get to 600ad (i think thats the year if i remember correctly) it says additional data is requires, and the download starts but always ends up saying connection timed out and to check my signal. I alwasys have perfect reception and tried 4g and wifi with same result. I know its downloading something as i checked my data usage when its supposedly downloading, and itll stop anywhere between downloading 2-40mbs, so i have no idea whats the issue. Thanks for the upload; eveerything you provide is great, hope someone can provide an answer on what to do here"
,ninekplus,2012-11-04T01:18Z,"We are getting the download error because of DRM.
The game connects to Square's server to download content after the 1st time jump. If you are running a pirate copy this download fails.
