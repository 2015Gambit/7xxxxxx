"Solid Citizens"

Sheriff Lamb suspects Savino of 
kidnapping the son of a member of the 
Nevada Gaming Commission in order to 
fast-track a gaming license for The 
Tumbleweed. Meanwhile, when Savino's 
wife, Laura, comes out to Vegas to 
support him in a new venture, his 
promise that their family will be 
safe there is put in jeopardy when a 
ruthless hitman from Milwaukee 
arrives in town.
