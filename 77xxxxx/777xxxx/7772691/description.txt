The General Line, or The Old and the New ?
Movie or propaganda ?
To me a filmed poem, a landmark in the history of cinema, my favorite Eisenstein; a jewel.

VIDEO
I have worked to find and use the "best" avisynth technology for the DVD source that wouldn't remove any noticable precision (and obv. thanx to high quality x264 encoding not loose anything noticeable there too). The source is extremly old and damaged, sometime filled with scratches, I find the result is significantly better than the source, which is why I release this "optimized" version.
