,lifeofreilly,2012-11-08T03:30Z,Can anyone tell why this is so outrageously large?
,Kratchiphol,2012-11-08T21:52Z,This is a direct blu-ray rip with no compression quite like dvd releases on 4.4GB. For normal users it's quite unnecessary to download these torrents unless you want to burn the original blu-ray onto a disc. Search after the compressed ones instead.
