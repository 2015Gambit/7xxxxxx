[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-11-01T05:09Z,"Nah, no reason other than not being able to find it. 

In case anybody wonders, let me put this out there...

I have some stuff that is complete, in need of no 'Restoration', ready to go. That goes in one staging folder, where I have about 50 books/series waiting to be uploaded pretty much all the time.

I have another folder for things that are complete, but I'm going to 'Restore' them, or am considering 'Restoring' them. After those are done they get moved to the folder mentioned above.

If I'm thinking about uploading something that's incomplete (whether I'm considering 'Restoring' it or not), I put it in a separate folder and I usually spend (at least) a couple weeks regularly checking all of my usual search spots, trying to complete the run. At some point, when I'm not finding the issues I'm looking for, I have to decide if I should move it back to my external drives and come back to it another time, or upload it as is, still missing issues. With anthologies, like this one, I almost always decide to upload it, because nothing will be missed with stories that don't run from issue to issue. 

So there's that, in case anybody has ever wondered (doubtful anybody has, but now ya know anyway!).

In regards to accepting 'donations' from y'all, hells yeah! I'm all about it! Although anybody out there could upload books just as easily as I can, I'm happy to grab them from y'all and upload them from over here.

I actually tried to start a thread at the SuprBay that I could link to in all my uploads, but the mods their run a tight ship, (get it? tight ship, arrrgh!) and my plans didn't fit within the forum guidelines. I've been a mod before, so I totally respect that. Sooo...

What I figured out (with the kind assistance of another PB'er) is that DropBox works EXCEPTIONALLY well for the purpose of receiving books from y'all. Install DropBox on your PC (it's free) and then shoot me a Private Message at the SuprBay (in the links down below where it says Forum - you'll have to create an account there if you don't already have one) with you're email address. I'll then send you a request to join a shared DropBox folder and you can toss anything you like my way. 

I check in at the SuprBay everyday, so anyone should feel free to drop me a note there anytime. "

But I really don't have the time or energy to get into anything too complicated. I already spend WAY too much time downloading comics elsewhere and then uploading a portion of them to TPB."

You're doing great work, LeonardTSpock, I'm glad to have been of any assistance to you."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-11-01T19:27Z,"I wanted it, Mogwai79, so thank you very much! And thanks for the kind words."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-11-03T03:54Z,"I'd like somebody to give an explanation of why they gave this a negative, but I know they won't. Easier to just click the button for no reason. Hope it made you feel better, what have you uploaded today?"
,Jackbooger,2012-11-21T09:33Z,"Thanks for this, I read these in high school. And thank you for all the amazing uploads  "
