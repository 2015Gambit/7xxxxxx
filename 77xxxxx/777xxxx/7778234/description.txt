Release Notes

This pre includes exactly what was released as digital download, and only
the artist tag of track 9 has been adjusted.
The unmixed tracks 1, 5, 9 and 15 (described below) were never part of the
DJ mix, which has a cue file with correct titles included.

"Magik Six: Live In Amsterdam", originally released in the year 2000,
continued the success of the series that DJ Tiesto started on his Black
Hole Recordings label. Eventually settling DJ Tiesto's reputation as the
Number 1 DJ Of The World that be became later on, the pivotal Magik
series covered seven volumes. ôMagik Six: Live In Amsterdamö now sees
it's highly anticipated rerelease for the first time in the digital
domain. As with the rest of the Magik series, the album was a live
turntable mix. It was recorded on June 23rd 2000 during a Wildlife event
at Melkweg, Amsterdam."

As some of you maybe know, the official tracklist on the cover of the
original CD had a couple of mislabels:
1. Fratt Boy was actually North Pole
5. Forever Young was actually Silent Cry
16. Cloudwalking was actually the Astral Mix (not the original as
indicated when no mix name is specified)

After 12 years this is what they did with the digital re-release:
Rather than fixing the problem, Black Holy blindly included full
versions of the tracks that were never part of the mix in the first
place. This includes the 3 tracks incorrectly printed on the original
tracklist.
In addition to that, they managed to include a vinyl rip of "Fred Numf
vs. Etienne Overdijk" - Waste Land wrongly tagged as "Kamaya Painters" -
Wasteland (which should have been the one included).
From what we could tell, tracks 1, 2 and 8 are also vinyl rips.

Rarest unmixed tune of this release is probably Purple Cloud, which
appears to be in digital quality!
