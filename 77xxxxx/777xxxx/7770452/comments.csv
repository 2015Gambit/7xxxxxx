did u check param.sfo ID:=BLES01675"
,maxdesolate,2012-11-01T03:43Z,"@naumi. 

ya i checked it. game plays when its left to 1674. but when i change it to 1675, it shows corrupted data in muliman and xmb and the game doesnt start.  the way i figured it, a lot of other people are having problems with it too. and true blue seems to be the cause. i would really appreciate it if you told me how to go back to the normal cfw 3.55. i have downloaded ofw and cfw 3.55 already. but i need help before removing true blue. can you please help?"

* first of all recent fix games work on ps3 kmeaw 3.55 not on any MFW or Dongle Firmware

* u need remove true blue dongle before u start ps3 

* then go to sytem update update ur ps3 with OFW 3.55

* After all  U need update CFW like called Kmeaw 3.55 and install it from Sytem update 


tht's it........ i hope it should be work "
