Description:

Samson and Delilah:

Samson (Eric Thal) is a shepherd with the strength of a titan and the destiny to fight the Philistines and General Tariq (Dennis Hopper). Delilah (Elizabeth Hurley) is the Philistine beauty. As told in the Old Testament, Samson's betrayal by Delilah left him in slavery. But his epic revenge vanquished his Philistine foes. Parental discretion advised

Abraham:

The Old Testament story of Abraham and the trials he endures. Commanded by God to lead his family to the promised land of Canaan with the promise that if he does so, his descendants will become a great and numerous tribe. His obedience, as well as that of his children and grandchildren, is severely tested as they prove their faith to God. Written by Jean-Marc Rocher


 
Seed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)

Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
