,gethigher,2012-11-01T07:16Z,"sound is normal .. nothing wrong with the release when iwatched it with VLC.

maybe marko8 is missing some codecs or something .."
,marko8,2012-11-01T10:16Z,"For me at least, the audio is very messed up. All loud passages are overlaid with buzzing and distortion. Tried with both latest VLC and GOM player."
,mvewtcher,2012-11-01T10:57Z,I have to agree with marko8. The sound is awful with loud distortion at the start and a weird reverb and screeches all through it.  One would think a trusted skull would check before uploading and why a a person who uploads files such as this one is given a skull. It sucks if you're on limited data download and you waste it on an inferior file such as this one.
,MrPPV,2012-11-01T12:59Z,Yeah The sound is way fucked up. stay away from this torrent
,was192,2012-11-01T13:06Z,yes dnt download this shit .... the audio is fucked up through out the movie . i deleted after wathcing 20 minutes and now downloading other version ..bad day
,101pepsi,2012-11-01T13:19Z,yeah the audio is messed up in this and pixals are the size colin faril head. just wait for a proper dvd rip.
,extremeBONE,2012-11-01T14:08Z,"to all NOOBS that have posted comments compaining about this torrent follow these easy steps and quit your complaining

-DOWNLOAD SAMPLE FIRST and see if the sound and picture quality is to your liking

-DONT DOWNLOAD 700mb AVI rips if you dont like pixels (2hr film = 1.5 gb avi)



"
,mvewtcher,2012-11-01T22:26Z,"I do not consider commenting on a torrents quality as complaining. If someone else had commented on the low sound quality I would have considered that as a helpful comment and therefore not downloaded it. However, at the time I downloaded it, no one had commented about it. If you use a magnet link as I have to, I don't see how you can download the sample separately. Instead of dictating to others to quit complaining, you could have been more helpful by explaining how to do that. I have downloaded plenty of great quality 700mb avi's before with no problems especially from trusted skulls.  That is why I was so surprised that this one was from a trusted skull"
,xvidmusic,2012-11-01T23:24Z,"english subtitles for this, anyone"
,aradiel,2012-11-02T00:29Z,"For some reason, my media player can't play the audio. It sounds like they're under water. Works fine on PC. Video is okay, but a little blocky. I'll be getting another version."
,TtToker,2012-11-02T20:19Z,"The sound is awful, it's not bad in quiet parts but the strange sound is caused when things start to get somewht loud, and the whole movie is pretty loud. I'd skip this torrent even though the file size is half of the others... 

@ExtremeBONE, how do you DL only the sample through a magnet link??"
,Rzaaa11,2012-11-03T07:45Z,"WARNING

This video is pixeleted and audio is fucked up"
,stijr,2012-11-03T08:09Z,thank you good sir!
,soyuz16,2012-11-03T12:39Z,"video is good for me, but the audio is kinda messed up when there are action scenes,. still sad. but thanks anyway."
,Mini_grt,2012-11-03T19:43Z,"To the Uploader

As you have a skull besides your name , you should not up this kind of shit ...

You should have checked b4 uploading.. 

-1 from me :("
,DannyBoyDannyBoy1974,2012-11-05T00:45Z,"***WARNING TO DOWNLOADERS*** Though labeled ""DVDRip,"" this encoding is NOT ripped from a bona fide English-language release (R1 or R2 DVD). It is an ""R5 Line"" and should be labeled as such.

Even if it is prior to the official R1 or R2 release date, bona fide DVDrip encodings of English-language films CAN and sometimes DO appear if the source has been leaked from the production run of R1/R2 DVDs; so it is not obvious that an encoding labeled ""DVDRip"" is an R5 Line if it appears before official release. Unfortunately, unscrupulous release groups will often purposely label their R5 Lines as ""DVDRip"" to inflate the popularity of their releases.

Why should you care? R5s of English-language films are DVDs released in Region 5 (Russia, et al.) with foreign-language audio, and most often lack the expensive image post-processing that films released in DVD Regions 1 & 2 receive. That means video inferior to the video you get with R1 and R2. To get the English audio, the audio from the theatrical release is pirated digitally from the movie theatre by running an audio line to a recording device, resulting in a capture which almost always includes electronic noise in the form of clicks, pops, sharp static, and an ever-present hum or hiss. So ""R5 Line"" means both video and audio inferior to a ""DVDRip"" of R1/R2 DVD releases.

The more we spread the word about mislabeled R5 Lines in the file-sharing communities, the sooner mislabeled uploads like this can die and the more bandwidth we all save."
