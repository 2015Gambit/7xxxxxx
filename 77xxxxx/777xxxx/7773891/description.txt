Vishnu Puran is an Indian television series directed by B.R. Chopra. It aired in 2003. It is based on the Vishnu Purana, an ancient collection of stories and scripture. Vishnu Puran tells of 10 incarnations of Lord Shri Vishnu, as well as other stories, such as the Legend of Dhruva.

The chief roles are played by Nitish Bharadwaj as Lord Shri Vishnu and Vaidehi as Goddess Lakshmi. Nitish Bharadwaj previously played the role of Lord Shri Vishnu's eighth incarnation, Lord Krishna, in Chopra's television adaptation of the epic Mahabharat. The music is composed by Rajkamal who also worked on Mahabharat. Even though Vishnu Puran did not prove to be as successful as Mahabharat, it did become popular among Lord Shri Vishnu devotees and Nitish Bharadwaj fans.
