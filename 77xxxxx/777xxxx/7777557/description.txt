A Yank in the R.A.F. [1941]

Tyrone Power is a pilots' pilot, but he doesn't believe in anything beyond his
own abilities. He gets into trouble by flying a new fighter directly to Canada
instead of to New York and letting it be towed across as the law demands, but
is offered a new job ferrying bombers to war torn England. While on a layover
he finds Betty Grable, an old flame, has joined the RAF as a WREN in her
attempt to fight for democracy. Power joins up to impress her and in the course
of his several missions begins to develope an understanding of what they are
fighting for.
