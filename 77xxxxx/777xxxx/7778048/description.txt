English Subtitles were ripped from the Blu-ray, converted and OCR'd to .ass file, made smaller and lowered closer to the bottom of the screen.  They are however, burned into the movie itself.  Some people make not like this, but some devices can't select alternative subtitles, much less understand the .ass format.

Also, since I don't speak Japanese (unfortunately) and I would only ever watch it with the subtitles, is another reason I burned them in.  I made this file for myself, but if others like it as well, then this is for them.
