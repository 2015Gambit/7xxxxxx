This copy of AVG is loaded with the ""Trojan Horse KillAV.PY"" and ironically it's my current version of AVG I have installed that detected this crap all in your copy, Wallpaperboy!  WTF!  False positive or not, be warned, people!  My current installed copy of AVG went nuts within seconds of the download being complete before a Multiple Threat Detection window popped up showing me 3 threats in this copy of AVG Internet Security 2013 13.2741 Build 5824 (x86x64).  Anyone else care to comment about that or just shoot it all down as false positives?  "

If I wanted to infect tons of ppl, the keygen is exactly where I'd put the bomb(s)!  You've been warned, all.  I hope I'm just being overly cautious!  Good luck!!"
