|-This will NOT fit on a 4.7GiB DVDR.  You need a Multi-Layer DVDR or USB -|

|There are no well established activation bypass as of yet, so I have not  |
|included them. Every activator available to date uses old legit keys and  |
|kms servers with outdated blacklists. If you manage to get your copy of   |
|Windows 8 activated, I highly recommend backing up your activation with   |
|Advanced Tokens Manager 3.5 beta 3 or later from Josh Cell Software.      |

|No Windows 8 Settings were harmed in the making of this ISO.              |
|No Programs are added.                                                    |
|No Unattended Settings were added to the installation.                    |
|No Registry Settings were modified.                                       |

|Either burn the included .iso file to a dvdr or use a usb flash drive.    |
|I have included diskpart instructions and the win7usb tool.               |
|I personally use diskpart and winrar, but the tool may be easier.         |

|I have personally tested every install on this ISO.  It should not        |
|require a setup key as there is a skip button, but if it does, I have     |
|included some default install keys.  I have not verified them as working. |
|Use them at your own risk.                                                |
|----------------------------------murphy78--------------------------------|
|These MSDN iso sources have pre-release EULA on some of the installations.|
|All reports indicate that the binaries are exactly the same as the ones   |
|in the retail dvds.  If you don't like it, don't use it. If you want to   |
|use a retail version, you need a retail key. The programs are the same.   |
