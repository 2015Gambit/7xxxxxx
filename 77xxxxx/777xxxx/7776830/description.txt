"There is no mystery in the management of a greenhouse. Regular attention and common sense are the basis of all success under glass, while the application of intelligence, ingenuity or expenditure can overcome most problems even when time or common sense are in short supply! The one essential is a will to grow plants, not just look at them. The key question are 'Do you want a greenhouse?' and ?Why do you want it?' "
