,Blickity,2012-11-09T00:35Z,"Obviously, it's not the game, but it's just what I needed."
,jonnio_o,2012-11-11T16:41Z,For those of us that updated and were no longer able to run our game because the crack is outdated this worked perfectly.  So thank you very much! 
,Galapril,2012-11-12T15:38Z,"Works beautifully. This is not a fake, nor does it contain malware or such. This is for those who wanted to get the legal update and use things like the blueprint-option and the ability to swim in the ocean ahead of time, and then a crack to make it work. Thumbs up for this."

,napoleonsfirstname,2012-11-13T21:40Z,"I can't get the crack to work - the game says no disk is inserted when I try to run it from another file, but when I run it from TS3W I get an error. Help? "
,dhod4ever,2012-11-14T13:45Z,"@napoleonsfirstname

do not paste the crack in Sims 3 seasons folder..
paste the crack in Sims 3 BASE GAME
#The Sims 3
#Game
#Bin

If you accidentally paste the crack in the wrong folder you will get an error when executing the game (you will need to install the game again if you didnt make a backup of the original files). NOTE: there is no game installer in this torrent, only the seasons crack and the patch 1.42.13 update"
,dhod4ever,2012-11-14T13:50Z,"@pansen7x7

If the Ultimate Edition you mentioned is a REPACK then this Patch will not work for you... you need to wait for the uploader to update its repack for a newer version. ask the uploader if its compatible to future updates and expansion.

If its not a repack then this will work.. just execute the patch paste the crack in the Sims 3 BASE GAME #The Sims 3 #Game #Bin."
,sammywins,2012-11-14T14:14Z,"After this patch game started crashing on ""creating a town"" screen :("
,dhod4ever,2012-11-14T15:17Z,"@sammywins

that's because you didnt remove your custom content and other mods. Paste it back when the owner or poster of that MODS post a newer version or compatibilty fix."
,sammywins,2012-11-14T16:49Z,"@dhod4ever I don't have any mods, I installated clean version of Sims 3 without any expansion packs, still the same problem."
,dhod4ever,2012-11-14T18:26Z,"@sammywins

hmmmm... if its clean Base game only then either the SAVE game has a problem or do you have store content installed in your sims3launcher? DLC? store items?

""backup the SAVE files before performing the instruction below""

try to delete your save game in #Usename #Documents #Electronic Arts #The Sims 3 #Saves
then play a new game. if this work then you cant play your old saves game anymore.

or

if you have some Store content items or World or DLC or sim3packs installed. uninstall them and try to play the game if this work.

I cant help anymore if none of the above work maybe it's the system requirements, etc."

,lordax,2012-11-17T19:32Z,"I got a ""all in one"" game here, it's up to 1.38. I want to update to 1.42 so I can use relativity mod since I can't find 1.38 version of the mod, so the question is, can I install this patch over the game (it just installed everything didn't need to crack or anything)?
