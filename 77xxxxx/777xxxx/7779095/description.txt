Summory: Eye-popping special effects highlight an updated werewolf story. TV newswoman, Karen White, goes on a retreat after a traumatic incident with a serial killer. But is she really safe? And what should she fear more: regaining her memory or the creepy residents of "The Colony"? Followed by many unsatisfying and unconnected sequels. Helped launch shortlived werewolf craze in early eighties.
