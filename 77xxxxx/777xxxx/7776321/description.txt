Supertramp are a British rock band formed in 1969 under the name Daddy before renaming 
themselves in early 1970. Though their music was initially categorised as progressive 
rock, they have since incorporated a combination of traditional rock and art rock into 
their music. The band's work is marked by the inventive songwriting of Rick Davies and 
Roger Hodgson, the distinctive voice of Hodgson, and the prominent use of Wurlitzer 
electric piano and saxophone in their songs.
