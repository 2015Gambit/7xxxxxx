In this four track EP, Big Skapinsky goes over a few Styles of Electronic Music, creatively weaving in and out of each one in a creative mix of "Musical Darwinism"


Constellation takes a while to really get thumping, with slowly accelerating synth pulses not so unlike Deadmau5's "Fn Pig" and exploding into a myriad of bass thumping, and shredding 8bit solos that'll sound like your gameboy having an orgasm. the track then dips back down only to come back full force with a Dubstep bass just tearing away at your eardrums, and bringing back the main theme, twice as hard. 

The Arcade brings an aggressive bass right from the start, with samples from the legendary Pac-Man bringing back old memories while the track thumps away with agressive effect-changing bass, and a saw dancing above it all.

Evolusic is the crown jewel of this EP (hence the naming of the EP) as it starts of very modestly with a simple 'tic, tac' and some sine chord pulses. the track then slowly builds and builds in utter 'Evolusic' to climax into a Chord-Smashing, Bass-Thumping chorus (where the more trained ears can hear some Bob Marley and James Brown, no joke) the track then dies down in an 'extinction' only to rebuild entirely with a new species: Dubstep. Where the most powerful drop of the entire EP hits you in the face like Hurricane Sandy hit New York (too soon?) the track then fades down in the original theme to utter darkness.

The Answer is Always a Piano is a more laid-back song despite having a big thumping four on the floor bass drum. With pianos playing little tickling melodies, and a duo of synth leads harmonizing into a beautiful story telling solo constantly conversing with one another until the very end of the track.
