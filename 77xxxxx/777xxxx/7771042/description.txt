Parasite Eve is an action role-playing game with many horror elements. Movement in the various environments is free. Movement in the "world map" (which is a map of Manhattan) is limited to specific destinations. Upon the player walking over a "hot spot," there's a chance of a random encounter. Each time the encounter occurs, the likelihood of the battle reoccurring decreases. Enemies materialize suddenly and though there is no shift to a separate battle screen, the player is bound within a perimeter of unseen barriers until the battle is over, either by defeating all enemies or using the Escape command.


This release includes the official game PKG, as well as the fix. Tested and works great on Rogero's 4.21 CFW. Should also work fine on 3.55.

Instructions:

1. Install Parasite Eve.pkg (if you're on 4.21 the PKG will be copied to the internal HDD first and you can install it from there like a purchased PSN game; you may delete it afterwards)

2. Install Parasite Eve Crack.pkg

3. Enjoy
