Come on in, the water's fine. And full of amazing things. Things like:
a hungry starfish loping voraciously across a panicked, living
"shag carpet" of prey; a swarming frenzy of opalescent squid who mate,
then die; plus things never before caught on film - including
sea lions who just might be using kelp stalks as toothbrushes.
Kate Nelligan narrates and renowned marine-life filmmaker Howard Hall
directs this colorful foray into the kelp forests located off
California's Channel Islands. So lights, camera, water. A cast of
thousands is ready for its amazing close-up.
