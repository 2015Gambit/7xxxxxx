,TrondSoapMacTavish,2012-11-01T09:17Z,"There is no ""Disc 1"" SinglePlayer, there is a DiscSwap in the game, so this will make a lot of pirates pissed when the games asks you for: ""please insert disk two""

,Sexyz,2012-11-01T11:09Z,"Soap's accusations are a lie, Disc 2 only contains multi player, if you download this you will be able to finish single player."
