The nation's favourite idiot is back. Safely home from his latest travels, Karl has decided it is time to share his hard-earned wisdom of the world.

Taking the Bucket List of '100 Things to Do Before You Die' as his starting point, Karl combines brilliant stories from his recent adventuresto Alaska, Siberia and beyond with entertaining, highly-opinionated views on what other people aspire to do with their lives.

┬╖ Why on earth would anybody want to run with the bulls in Pamplona?
┬╖ Go 'storm chasing' through Tornado Alley?
┬╖ Have lunch with the Queen?
┬╖ Or touch hands with the Pope?

The Further Adventures of An Idiot Abroad is a fitting finale to two years of eventful globe-trotting. Frank, funny and strangely inspiring, this is Karl's final word on travel.
