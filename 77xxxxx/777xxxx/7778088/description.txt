otrtool aims to provide an open source tool to deal with otrkey-files from
onlinetvrecoder.com. At the moment it is able to decrypt them, in the
future a download manager and/or EPG could be added.


This version is precompiled for MAC OS X 10.8

In Short:
put encrypted blah.otrkey file in otrtool folder
open terminal and cd to folder
run ./otrtool and follow instructions
