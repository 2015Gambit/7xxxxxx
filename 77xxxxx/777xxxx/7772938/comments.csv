[V],thenoobish,2012-10-30T14:42Z,"Not funny :( Maybe your seedbox didn't allow public trackers? :( However, blazinseedboxes do allow them, if you want a new one that is."
[V],thenoobish,2012-11-01T12:33Z,"Or you could seed them using a trial version of some seedbox service, some of them offer 24h trial:)"
