Dont download this and waste your time go for something like SkiDrow or Reloaded or Original BLACKBOX or REPACK."

i guess it means that 720p videos are lossless."
,MAA11792,2012-10-31T01:54Z,"Why on earth would I download this repack, there are other better torrents out there.."
,player5453,2012-11-03T01:42Z,"@MAA11792 kiss my ass, please don't no one gives a shit. Thanks to blackbox people like me who can't afford a good internet connection and have a 15 gb limit are able to download and enjoy. Thank you BlackBox and fuck ungrateful assholes like you, if you don't want to download then please don't, just don't leave hateful comments with no good reason."
,MaximusBlack,2012-11-04T14:04Z,"@crossfine - Ripping 1080p videos mean they have re-encoded to 720p, it DOES NOT mean they have been removed entirely. Learn to use common-sense

@player5453 - I concur"
,jKlark,2012-11-21T12:45Z,"This is exactly what i was looking for. Thank you Stifmeister for this. I haven't played it yet so can't confirm if it has any issues or not. But i can confirm this is a legit blackbox release, and i fully trust them."
,spystyle,2012-11-23T01:07Z,"Some things don't work. 

I got to the end of the game but ""telekinetic shield"" psi ability and ""mind shield"" device don't work.

Also mods don't work (I downloaded a mod with installer and it can't find the game?)

Otherwise this game works great. I had graphical issues, when I alt tab out of the game, and then back in,  it corrects the graphical issues (???)

So this game release is good, but needs bugs corrected. I got all the way to the end but can't win without the ""mind shield"""
,spystyle,2012-11-23T04:55Z,"UPDATE :

OK, I fixed this game by installing 2 things.

1 =

2 =

Now it's all good, so far :)"
