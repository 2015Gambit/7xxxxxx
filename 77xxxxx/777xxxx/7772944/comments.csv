-Program Files(x86)/Waves
-User/../AppData/Roaming/Waves...
-Cleaned Registry

But I still get ""Select Waves Folder"" when trying to open the program either in PT or FL 9. Any suggestions? Thanks."

remove program with control panel
delete ALL!! waves folders and files (search your drive)
Delete Reg. Keys

32bit : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareWaves
64bit : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareWow6432NodeWaves
Pay attention when the waves install is finished, look where your 32-bit and 64-bit waves plugins are installed. run crack and install to each directory e.g. 32-bit to 32-bit etc. (this avoids the issue of ""No license found"" error)
I had the same issue as you on Team R2R's release of v9r5 for mac osx. A clean install of OS X and (re-install of)Windows (felt like starting fresh). but to avoid you having to do that lets cover our bases and fix this.

Running fine on  legit PT 10.3.2 (and cracked HD) and FL Studio 10.8 beta
let us know if this helps or not."
