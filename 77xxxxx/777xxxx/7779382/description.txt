"Blood Brother"

After Benny gets brutally beat up by some 
vampires, he calls Dean for help. Dean 
abruptly packs up and tells a confused Sam 
that hes taking a personal day. Benny 
confesses that hes going after his Maker so 
Dean offers to help, flashing back on the 
many times Benny helped him and Castiel in 
Purgatory. Meanwhile, Sam uses his solo time 
to reflect on the life he left behind with 
Amelia. However, when things go bad for Dean 
and Benny, Dean calls Sam for help, which 
makes everything very complicated.
