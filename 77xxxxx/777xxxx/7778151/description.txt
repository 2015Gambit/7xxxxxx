Australia, the world's largest island and smallest continent
is an exotic, intriguing land shaped by its isolation from
all other lands. With thousand of miles of red desert sand
dunes that characterize its famous Outback and lush coastal
rainforests rich with unique wild life, Australia is a place
of extremes. Australia- Land Beyond Time takes viewers on a
breathtaking journey back in time to witness the birth and
evolution of a mysterious land that harbors remnants of
Earth s earliest life and many of it s strangest creatures
that exist nowhere else on the planet.
