,candycoatedlove102,2012-11-03T17:48Z,"@Spiritmarauder I'm not even sure. :O There's three versions. The original, The target version and the yearbook edition. :O I'm having a hard time choosing which one I want. "
,candycoatedlove102,2012-11-03T17:51Z,"As soon as I get Take Me Home, I'll upload which version I have and I'll try to get the other bonus tracks too and I'll put the music videos on it too.

Why must it be so hard to choose? D: 

I have a 50/50 chance of getting the Yearbook Edition or the target edition."
