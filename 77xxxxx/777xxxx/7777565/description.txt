In the spirit of Halloween, Gnomoria gets a couple new undead enemies.

Skeletons
They spawn underground and get stronger the deeper they spawn
They carry weapons and can have a helmet and breastplate

Zombies
They spawn underground and spawn in greater numbers at a greater depth
If a zombie bite contacts blood it can infect a gnome
A zombie infection won't kill a gnome but if a gnome ever dies, they will turn into a zombie

General
Goblins spawn in slightly greater numbers but weaker armor and weapons and lower skills
Goblins can spawn with two handed weapons or 2 one hand weapons in addition to a weapon and shield from before
Beetles only spawn at depth -10 and lower and won't spawn before Fall
Mants no longer show up during Year 1
Significantly increased trap damage
Reduced meat from wild animals

Wood doors being invincible
Resistances for heat damage
