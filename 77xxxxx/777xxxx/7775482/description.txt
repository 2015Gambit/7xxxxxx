Nucleus was a Canadian quintet that arose from the ashes of one of Toronto, Canada's most popular 60's bands, "The Lords Of London".  Their sole album originally appeared in April 1969, and features intense jamming, with plenty of swirling organ and tough guitar.  When it failed to sell, they split, with three members going on to form 1970's hitmakers "A Foot In Coldwater".
