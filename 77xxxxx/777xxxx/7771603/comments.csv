,electropop_guy,2012-10-30T11:49Z,"""Please Seed back to make the speed Faster!!""

Well I would...but it's RAR files so I have to extract them and I can't seed it after I do that. Duh!"
,Bean-Bandit,2012-10-30T12:20Z,Take your rar shit and go somewhere else.
,hmac2,2012-10-31T13:46Z,RAR files and mine fails on r18.
,Bishounen,2012-11-12T14:12Z,"What's wrong with RAR files?  With any file above 1GB, you will get it more reliably if it's broken into RARs.  That's the way they almost always come from the scene uploaders.  Dunno why you are making such a big deal over it.

Also, this is the ONLY copy of this episode in HD on PB.  Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."
,Bishounen,2012-11-12T14:17Z,"Also, electropop, are you stupid?  OF COURSE you can seed after you unrar the file.  Unrar-ing it doesn't DELETE the rar files, it just copies the contents!  So unless you have some F-ed up setting in your unrar utility to delete the RAR files after opening them, (and if you do, you fail at RAR) you should be able to continue to seed even after you unrar the file.

TLDR version:  Lrn2RAR, dumbass."
