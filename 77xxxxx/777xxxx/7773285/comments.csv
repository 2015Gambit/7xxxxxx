,medeni73,2012-11-11T21:55Z,I have nuvi 50..what should I do with those files? just copy them on internal card and if yes where exactly?
,Ipmark,2012-11-12T10:37Z,"Your Nuvi 50 supports the lite JCV file version .

Put the D3589050A.JCV file in .systemJCV folder.

The .system folder is an system-hidden folder, you have to change the folder view options on your PC to see it."
