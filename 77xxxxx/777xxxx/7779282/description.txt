Thirty students. Twenty-four hours. Zero survivors.

Two years after a high-school prank involving flesh-eating acid nearly kills popular teacher Mr. Balszack, the graduating class of Sloppy Secondary holds a ΓÇÖ24-Hour FamineΓÇÖ charity event on school grounds. But thereΓÇÖs an uninvited guest at this event, masquerading as the schoolΓÇÖs handyman mascot, and heΓÇÖs got an insatiable hunger of his own. The powerΓÇÖs cut, the doors and windows are chained shut, and now itΓÇÖs not just cheerleaders who are getting nailed! Has Mr. Balszack come back for revenge? Is his sad tale just a cover for a brand-new psycho? Can the Nailer be stopped before the whole Class of 2011 goes six feet under?
