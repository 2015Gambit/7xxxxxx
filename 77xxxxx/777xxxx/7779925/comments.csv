[T],data9724,2012-11-04T18:21Z,"Arrgh, more of those....Well, a few scanlators outside the normal scanlation circles (like this/these guys) who seems to enjoy packing in soem obscure format. My Gonvisor program runs them fine, but CDisplay dont...the best i can do are to say to rename to rar.unpack, and repack, AND dont share the repacked version.

Sharing versions not identical to the original = bad for file sharing purposes, so best to keep that, but a probelm when the packer used some obscure format :)"
[T],blackcanary,2012-11-06T20:57Z,"Thank you data9724.

If anyone else is having troubles opening the archives, the archives that give you errors are ACE archives.  On Windows, you can use WinRAR, WinACE, and a few other programs - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_archivers#Reading.  For Linux or Mac OS X, you can use Unace or RAR.

As to why ACE is used, it provides a slightly better compression than RAR (~0.5%) and ZIP (~1%)."
