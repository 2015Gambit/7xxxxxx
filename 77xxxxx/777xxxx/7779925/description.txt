And here you go, a nice upload of Spirou and Fantasio 1-3, scanned from the Cinebook releases.

For those of you that dont know Spirou and Fantasio, it is one of the most popular classic Franco-Belgian comic strips. The series, which has been running since 1938, shares many characteristics with other European humorous adventure comics like Tintin and Asterix.
Spirou and Fantasio are the series main characters, two adventurous journalists who run into fantastic adventures, aided by Spirous pet squirrel Spip and their inventor friend the Count of Champignac.


Apart from the 3 Cinebook releaes, I have also added all known scanlations of Spirou. But sadly, the quality on those varies a LOT, most of them having no covers, horrible text, and no sound effects and text outside of bubbles changed. I have not added any screenshots from those, since there are no generel representation on how they all look :)
