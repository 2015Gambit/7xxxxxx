Thanks "
,JBiz1,2012-10-29T20:03Z,There is a way to activate pertinently thru Microsoft. Email me for details : jbiz1.tpb@gmail.com
,TheBillGates,2012-10-29T20:38Z,"Activating Microsoft Windows 8 Pro for free with legitimate key !!!
Yes you heard it right, its possible now just follow some of these simple steps:

1). Activate your copy of windows with a MAK or KMS method
2). To activate windows using KMS server, run Command Prompt (CMD) as Admin
and enter the following in the given order:
slmgr /ipk NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4
slmgr /skms 147.134.1.42:1688
slmgr.vbs -ato
slmgr /ckms
If the server is running then you will be activated for 180 days.
3). Visit http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs and get
your legit free key for an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro with Windows Media Center.
4). Now right click on extreme lower left corner of your screen and go to ""System"".
5). Click on ""Get more features with a new edition of Windows"" and
select ""I already have a product key"", enter the key and follow
the procedure to make your Windows legitimately activated!

NOTE:
1). Free upgrade offer is valid till 31 January 2013, so hurry up !!!
2). This method works only with Windows 8 Pro Retail !!!
3). The activation using this method is PERMANENT !!!"
,apple24,2012-10-30T00:40Z,Anyone have an idea when the windows 8 pro retail with permanent activation will be uploaded? 
,krixx,2012-10-30T06:09Z,"Windows 8 Professional is batter or Windows 8
Enterprise Evaluation ?"
,viggen6666,2012-10-30T15:51Z,What does this do? Is it a list of servers still available to activate or it emulates a server?
,Maou-JP,2012-10-31T00:12Z,"Works for me.
Thanks."
,mkd91,2012-10-31T20:54Z,"Anyone can just blindly follow what ""TheBillGates"" said. Thank you so much. I have activated my copy with microsoft genuin key permanently."
,lavir74,2012-10-31T23:21Z,"Yes, what TheBillGates says works perfectly. 

If you then have to reinstall (and the key gets blocked for being already installed) you can just phone using support and there are no problems, but use your key only for ONE PC (and don't give it to anyone) or Microsoft will block it.

For now this is the ONLY way to activate permanently, so hurry up and get the free key until you can, it's very easy.

Sooner or later a real permanent activator will come, but as of now KMS is the only way to truly activate and the media center key is the only way to permanently activate."

[T],Tom_Da_Man,2012-11-02T14:33Z,"kms server lunar21.no-ip.org:80 will work, if you set your timezone to GMT+02.00 CaĂŻro.

(Server 2 in the KMS activator)

Then get your free Media Center Upgrade key, install and enjoy your fully activated Windows 8 Pro WMC Edition."
,lookito,2012-11-03T12:22Z,I confirm that TheBillGates procedure is working like a charm. The only thing you need to do is to follow the steps in a clean installation of windows 8 pro
,lavir74,2012-11-04T10:51Z,"One other thing:

I suggest everybody, after permanent activation with the media center key, to backup the activation with Advanced Tokens Manage 3.5 beta (or higher)."
,vgnqn,2012-11-05T04:44Z,No KMS server could be found. How do I get around this to activate Pro as TheBillGates and Lavir discussed? Any assistance is much appreciated! 
,lavir74,2012-11-05T16:13Z,"@vgnqn:

Try one of these:
147.134.1.42:1688
kms.dant.net.ru
kms.creighton.edu
kms.creighton.edu:1688
jbiz1.no-ip.org:1688
109.174.76.120:1688
lunar21.no-ip.org:80 (set the time to GMT +2)

Also search on google on forums to see what are the latest KMS servers working."
,vgnqn,2012-11-05T22:51Z,"@lavir74, I appreciate the response! I'm all activated now, and just awaiting my email for the new key. "
,vgnqn,2012-11-05T23:21Z,Legitimate key activation worked like a charm.
