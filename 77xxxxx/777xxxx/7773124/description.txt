The Smiths Complete


Often imitated, rarely matched, The Smiths have grown to be one of BritainΓÇÖs most influential groups. No band since has truly captured the incredible dynamic of Johnny MarrΓÇÖs musical genius and MorrisseyΓÇÖs lyricism. Completed by Andy Rourke on bass and Mike Joyce on drums, the band is often cited as the key precursor to the Britpop movement.

The Smiths Complete is the ultimate The Smiths remasters collection, lovingly reworked by Johnny Marr and Rhino UK. It includes all four of the band's studio albums: The Smiths (1984), Meat Is Murder (1985), The Queen Is Dead (1986), Strangeways, Here We Come (1987); their sole live album Rank (1988); as well as firm fan favourite compilations Hatful Of Hollow (1984), The World WonΓÇÖt Listen (1987) and Louder Than Bombs (1987).

This CD boxed set features each album packaged in a mini-LP replica sleeve complete with the original artwork, including gatefolds and inner sleeves where relevant. Each album has been taken back to original tape sources and remastered by master-engineer Frank Arkwright, assisted by Johnny Marr at the Metropolis Studios in London.
