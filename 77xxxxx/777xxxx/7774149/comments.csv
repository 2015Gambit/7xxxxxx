,Pitu1000,2012-10-31T19:10Z,How to install in the Skidrow version (Ver#0061)?
,sznejk87,2012-11-01T17:03Z,put files in to Worms RevolutionDLC 
,whateverthefuck,2012-11-02T01:49Z,"No install instructions, there is no ""DLC"" folder in the game where one could just copy these files. I've tried putting the ""Funfair_DLC"" folder in the game's root folder, but that doesn't work. Thankfully though, the download was small and fast, so I can just shift+delete the whole thing and move on with my life without much care."
