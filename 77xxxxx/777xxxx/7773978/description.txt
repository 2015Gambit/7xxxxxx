Description:


David:

This 2-part story begins with his legendary battle with the giant, Goliath and ends with his romance with Bathsheba and his struggle to preserve Israel.

The story of David is a legendary saga of a man after God's own heart.


David and Goliath:

This epic version of the classic biblical tale features Orson Welles as King Saul.

A dark cloud hangs over Saul as the Philistines declare war on his Kingdom. Looking for help, he seeks the advice of the prophets on how to defeat his enemies.


The Story of David:

See the classic story of Israel's greatest King.

Here is one of the greatest sagas in all human history-the story of IsraelΓÇÖs greatest king. He became a nationally known hero while still a teenager in his battle with the giant Goliath. Thereupon his life was caught up in the whirlwind of his peopleΓÇÖs life and destiny. Never far from danger, political intrigue, the jealousy of opponents, and the problems caused by his own surging passions, David, nevertheless, emerged as a "man after GodΓÇÖs own heart."

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
