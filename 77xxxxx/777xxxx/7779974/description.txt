On a simple mission to make the present and future better, Professor Phineas B. Fuddle travels into the past to introduce modern technology to ancient civilizations. But the professor's machinations result in catastrophic consequences as the present-day world of the early 1900s is transformed into an anarchic war zone. Now with the time-stream on the verge of collapsing due to the professor's meddling, Fuddle's nephew and his companion must travel back in time and return with his uncle before the clock strikes midnight and reality ceases to be.
