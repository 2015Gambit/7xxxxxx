,unnim2,2012-11-01T08:38Z,thank you. 
,helicon84,2012-11-01T21:40Z,"Thanks for all your uploads. I was wondering if you could upload (if you have it or can get it) The Complete Case Files (Judge Dredd). There's some Dredd on TPB, but mostly they're not very good scans and it's pretty scattered. The Complete Case Files 01 is alredy uploaded but the rest isn't."
[V],mirrormaster82,2012-11-02T02:12Z,"JUst wanted to say thanks for filling up the void on TPB with all these obscure and hard to find comics,and even though I can't find the time to read most of the comics ( that even I upload ) it's great to have you here on the TPB and keep up the great work...I think that's enough from me...and I've been here for quite sometime...so..."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-11-02T03:21Z,"Hey mirrormaster82, thank you for the very kind words. And thank you for all your great uploads as well. You have no idea (because I have no idea) how many books I've downloaded from you. Not sure exactly what the last part of your comment means, but if it means what I think it means, best of luck to you in everything you do, and I hope you take the time to read as much as humanly possible! : ) "
,keviner,2012-11-02T03:45Z,"^^-What an oddly cryptic comment...Is this an allusion to retirement? Could mirrormaster82 be hanging up his scanner? 
Stay Tooned!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-11-02T04:29Z,"Ya know, that's what I thought he meant at first. But he's been uploading pretty regularly, including today. So maybe he just meant he'd spent too much time writing the comment and wanted to get out of here. lol "
