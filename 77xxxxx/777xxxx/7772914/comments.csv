This doesn't seem to work for me, I'm running Windows 7 64-bit and I've followed the instructions carefully, and the patch always says it's not in the install directory, even though I did copy it there, I'm running it there, and I'm running it as admin. Could I have missed something? Thanks!"

c:Program FilesUltraISO"
