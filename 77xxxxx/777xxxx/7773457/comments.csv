,jddhi,2012-10-31T13:29Z,"@SSJASON hi, downloaded and installed a version of win8 you uploaded, works great. Just wondering if this permanent activator allows backgrounds to be changed? Thanks"
,SSJASON,2012-10-31T16:45Z,The activators in the first comment unlock customization for sure. This one seems to be iffy sometimes. 
,ireun,2012-10-31T22:58Z,"I can confirm that it works great, permanent activation and i can change background.."
,jddhi,2012-11-01T05:27Z,"I tried those activators and this one, no luck. edited group policies, registry, transcodedbackground file and every time i restart.. black background lol :( so frustrating"

Windows 8 is just Windows 7 with a new UI and touch screen integration. Do your homework. And quit being a moron."
