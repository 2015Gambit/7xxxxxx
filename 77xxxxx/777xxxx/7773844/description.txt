The Legend of Dragoon features three modes of play: the world map, the field map, 

and battle mode. The world map is linear with the controlled character's movements, 

which is then limited to dotted lines from place to place. The field map is used 

whenever the player enters a town, dungeon, or landmark. It consists of HD graphics, 

characters and backgrounds. Animations are overlaid to create motion such as the 

movement of water or light effects. Battle mode is a 3D field that complements the 

current field map. Turn-based battles occur in this between playable characters and 

CPU-controlled enemies. Standard actions such as attack, magic, defend, item and 

escape are present and implemented in various ways.
