Jean-Baptiste Marc Bourgery's "Traité complet de l’anatomie de l’homme comprenant la médecine operatoire". 

An 8-volume masterpiece concerning human anatomy. The first volumes deal with descriptive anatomy and the last two ones deal with surgical anatomy. The finished work contained 2108 pages of folio-sized text and 726 hand-colored lithographs. It is considered to be one of the most comprehensive and beautifully illustrated anatomical works ever published.

Have fun.
