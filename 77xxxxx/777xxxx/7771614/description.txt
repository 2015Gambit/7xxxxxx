From Wiki:


Peter John Murphy (born 11 July 1957) is an English rock vocalist. He was the vocalist of the rock group Bauhaus, and later went on to release a number of solo albums, such as Deep and Love Hysteria. Thin, with prominent cheekbones, a baritone voice, and a penchant for gloomy poetics, Murphy is often called the "Godfather of Goth."

Murphy was born near Northampton, England, and raised in Wellingborough, England. Bauhaus were one of the establishing acts of the goth movement.[citation needed] Their use of spacey recording effects and theatrical aesthetics was evocative of glam rock; they became an influential group in the early days of gothic rock.[citation needed]
