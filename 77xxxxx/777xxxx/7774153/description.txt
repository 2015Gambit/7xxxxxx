Cygnus Hex Editor Version 2.50

Cygnus Hex Editor is a powerful file editor for Microsoft Windows. Unlike text editors, which are designed to edit files that contain text data, hex editors allow you to edit files that contain any type of data.

Very useful if you want to modify .exe files (i.e. translate programs)

IMPORTANT NOTICE: This version of Cygnus Hex Editor requires Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows 2003, Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7. Users with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, and Windows NT 3.5 will need to either upgrade to a newer version of Windows, or use our Cygnus Hex Editor FREE EDITION (included), which will run on these older versions of Windows.
