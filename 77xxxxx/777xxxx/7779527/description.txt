within the department. Meanwhile, Lieutenant 
Severide helps an elderly woman facing some 
neighborhood problems. Detective Voight 
ramps up his intimidation tactics aimed at 
Casey in an attempt to discourage him from 
testifying against his son. Shay is forced 
to revisit her heartbreak over her ex-
girlfriend Clarice, when she finds herself 
face-to-face with the ex and her husband 
during a call. Hermann's temper flares 
during a rescue call at a Halloween block 
party.
