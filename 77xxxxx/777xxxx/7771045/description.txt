DEFYANCE began as three individuals from Knoxville, Iowa (USA) with the talent, drive, and determination to follow their love for music. Brent Scott, Marcus Peterson, and Doug Beary are the nucleus that has maintained the groupΓÇÖs focus on songwriting, musicianship, and melody throughout the years. During the formative years of DEFYANCE, a few members came and went. Despite these changes, the first three DEFYANCE releases (Voices Within, Amaranthine, and Time Lost) displayed a distinct sound, even as the band's songwriting continued to evolve.

With DEFYANCE's latest release, Transitional Forms, the band shows that their writing abilities have continued to grow. They have taken their sound to the next level by utilizing the established talents of vocalist Lance King of BALANCE OF POWER, EMPIRE, KINGS MACHINE, and GEMINI. The band met Lance through Lance's company Nightmare Records, which distributes DEFYANCE's earlier releases. Also teaming up with DEFYANCE is longtime friend Aaron Bell, the founder and leader of DEGREE ABSOLUTE, on bass guitar. This combination of musicians "transformed" the music into something that is instantly recognizable as DEFYANCE, yet at the same time, has a fresh and unique feel. This collaboration yielded some very interesting music that pulls from the strengths of each individual, forming a sound that DEFYANCE hopes will fill a musical void for many. Combining the power of heavier bands, the technicality of progressive bands, and the melodic finesse of hard rock bands, DEFYANCE looks to spread their music farther than ever before.
