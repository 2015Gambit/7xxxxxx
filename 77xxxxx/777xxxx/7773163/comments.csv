[V],Nepotu,2012-11-02T11:40Z,"Sorry chunny9! From where I took this torrent it had no credit. When is not my rip and I don't know the ripper I put ""Credit: ???"". What can I do more? Then people will know it's not my rip. If you have another proposal, tell me, please!"
,mematey,2012-11-11T22:30Z,"Thanks Nepotu .... again!  :)


@chuny9
I think you were just supplying the name of the original ripper, not criticizing Nepotu, right?

As Nepotu says he has never taken credit for anything not his. He always gives credit where credit is due. He is a class act. And a great asset here at TPB."
