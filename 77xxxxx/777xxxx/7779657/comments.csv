,raymond_u,2012-11-01T12:19Z,Had some issues seeding earlier - but should be going like a bullet train now.
,ripnsilk,2012-11-01T13:00Z,"you're right, completed and seeding now. cheers."
,atheist7,2012-11-03T02:36Z,Hey Raymond. Really appreciate your efforts. Any chance of getting that fine British publication Motorsport? I think that would make my life complete.
,raymond_u,2012-11-07T23:47Z,"Hi atheist - no, I don't have any sources for Motor Sport unfortunately."
,raymond_u,2012-11-08T02:09Z,"Hey folks. It seems that of late, Autosport have revised their procedures. They're no longer uploading the PDFs ahead of release - and obviously I can only send out the PDFs after they DO get released... so... yeah. Next one should be up in a couple of hours"
