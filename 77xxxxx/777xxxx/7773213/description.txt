Release Notes

"Magik Five: Heaven Beyond is the fifth album in the Magik series by
well-known trance DJ/producer Tiesto. As with the rest of the Magik
series, the album is a live turntable mix."

Unfortunately not all of these full versions are digital copies. A lot of
the old artists are hard to track down these days. Some have probably even
forgot about their old work, thus not put them up for digital purchase.
From what we could tell only Eve - Riser and DJ Merlyn - Stupid are vinyl
rips.

We also find it surprising that Black Hole failed to put the Main Mix of
Subraumstimulation on this release, as this huge bomb did have a cd
release back in 1999.
The rarest (digital) track on this release must be Maurits Paardekooper's
massive remix of Platina, previously only to be found on the compilation
"Reactivate 16".

Track 4, 8, 12 and 14 were unaccurate or mislabled on the official
tracklist, but have been corrected on our release.

Originally released in 2000. Cue file included for the mix.
