Where Cold Ambitions And Fiery Lust Meet Head On!

Beautiful Samantha is the hot new 'It' Girl at the city's top advertising firm. Co-worker and ad wiz Manuel sees her and falls instantly in lust, and vows to help her impress a big client. But CEO Evan Stone has his own plans for Samantha, and manipulates the vulnerable beauty away from sexy Manuel. Heartbroken, the European stud seeks solace in the arms of hot lesbian couple Katsuni and Asa, which only proves to Samantha that Evan was right about the French lothario. Will the star-crossed lovers ever find their way back to the truth? Or is ambition more satisfying than love? Written and directed by Nica Noelle.
