,Flac2496,2012-10-30T14:58Z,"Hi Leonard, I haven't written to you before, but just wanted to say a huge thank you for all the great uploads and the independents.  Like you, I own thousands of these things and many of the independents you've shared.  It is great to share these so people become aware of these artists and storytellers and never would otherwise.  Just wonderful work you are doing.  We need another 1000 like you and we could really change the world and how people treat each other in it !  Can I vote for you for president next week?"
,STFmaryville,2012-10-30T17:28Z,I'll second that nomination! Thx for uploading LeonardTSpock!
,Oneiromancer12,2012-10-31T00:23Z,"It would be really awesome if you could upload separate torrent Grant Morrison's JLA (with Earth 2 and the JLA Classified numbers written by Morrison, if possible). I hope you consider this. Cheers!"

[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-10-31T02:07Z,"A BIG you're most welcome to everyone. And a giant thank you for the kind words. But me? Politics? Oooooh no. While I take my civic duties very seriously, I could never be a politician. My closet is full to overflowing, and I intend to keep it locked for as long as possible. 

Working on all of the requests. Some are easier than others. Some I have and can post straight away. Some will have to go on the search list, which means I'll keep looking for them at regular intervals, literally, forever (or until TPB ceases to exist, anyway).

Oneiromancer12, I don't want to mislead you, so I feel it best to tell you that I don't really move in super hero circles. I dig Grant Morrison, but I don't actually have anything he's done in the realm of superheroes beyond his Batman stuff (all of which is heavily represented here at TPB). Off the top of my head I'd say that SplhcbPrime would probably be a good uploader to ask about that request. "

They yearn to be free!
But only if they ""out"" themselves voluntarily.
(Ahem)

Happy Hell-O-Ween! And more thanks echoes to LTS!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-11-03T19:19Z,Yeah man... I ain't volunteering. Nope.
