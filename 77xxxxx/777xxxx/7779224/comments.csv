I would not bother to insult you if you bothered to mention this is a *DEMO* of your commercial product.

""Nope no F***ing serial or crack. O and if I can help it there will never be a crack for it. ""

Yeah. Some of us bother to read comments of other torrents made by people when something new is posted.

Die in a fire spammer!"
,LastEnd,2012-11-01T04:48Z,Not a demo that wouldn't be right at all. 30 day Trial. Also when did I ask you. Atleast your uses of language shows your IQ.
,LastEnd,2012-11-01T05:00Z,"ALSO OmniNegro you look like a great guy! Yea right. From what I read on your torrents you give out BS teen porn, and files with virus in them. Had a feeling by your name you were one of those."
,IndigoAK,2012-11-01T08:51Z,OmniNegro: Last End = The company that develops Visual RPG Maker.  Why would they upload a cracked version of their own software?  That makes no sense.
,OmniNegro,2012-11-01T22:06Z,"@IndigoAK
They would not. But like I said, I would not have said a word if this bothered to say demo. Instead it implies it is free. (If it is on this site it is either freeware or usually stolen content.)

@LastEnd
The file in question with a ""Virus"" was posted by me for the game company itself. It has no malware/virus in it. The douchebag that said it did was upset for the reasons you can clearly see in the link I provided.

Since you think a claim of a virus means one exists, then I claim there is a virus in this. How would you defend your malware now?"
,LastEnd,2012-11-02T03:02Z,"Well in the world of TPB I would look for a green or pink skull. What sucks is I have no idea how to get that without posting a ton of cracked software, and I will/wont ever do that for legal reasons. I was showing links to the homepage that did imply more that I am the owner; however TPB does a database error now if I try to post a link.

Other than that look up ""Visual RPG Studio"" on Cnet or other download sites and they have already tested the software.

OmniNegro the reason I came across like this is your header/footer of your first post. I am human and unleased on TPB to do what ever I want. I love TPB."
