,piratorn,2012-10-31T05:07Z,does this include the full version of the game? or do  i need to download the full game?
,lwllw,2012-10-31T07:26Z,"Excuse me, does anyone know what am I supposed to do? After unzipping I only got an .arc file."
,markusios,2012-10-31T08:03Z,This torrent is only a patch (not the full game!)
,[AKATSUKI],2012-10-31T09:12Z,@lwllw download free arc and unzip; its gonna work
,elyolker,2012-10-31T13:12Z,"There is nothing in the .arc file. (Not to mention the fact that an .arc file was used in the first place.)

This is either a fake or created by someone with flippers for hands.

,Pink_Taco,2012-10-31T15:33Z,You need the sleeping dogs directory inside it.
,Pink_Taco,2012-10-31T15:33Z,but why not just rar or zip it? 
,Militance,2012-10-31T16:20Z,fuck this shit! uploader is a crackhead
,Militance,2012-10-31T16:21Z,he didnt simply rar the shit cause he dont want you to download it
,XHaloXX,2012-10-31T16:49Z,"@Militance, you stupid asshole, uploader didnt rar the shit to give you the freedom to download any file you want. some ppl get this fucked up after downloading, they just redownload the fucked files not the entire shit.

Go and fuck urself, what an unthankful shit!"
,Pink_Taco,2012-10-31T19:59Z,this file is like Inception  a file within an arc within an arc within a rar within a folder lol
,Pink_Taco,2012-10-31T20:38Z,game wont start nothing happens even with game installed
,Sabresite,2012-10-31T21:57Z,Does this require previous updates?
,OmniNegro,2012-10-31T22:41Z,"For fucks sake... Arc is a old archival format. There was a time whiny bitches complained loudly about rars being used instead of zips.  Now the same idiots are complaining again. 

If you cannot figure out how to use an archive of any sort, then it is not for you. And I strongly advise you to bother to look it up before you presume it is a defunct archive format."
,Pink_Taco,2012-10-31T23:03Z,"that problem i dont understand, arc opens pretty much like a rar extract it, but my problem is it is added to my sleeping dogs folder and the game wont work no more "
,niad,2012-11-01T00:23Z,"I made the stupid assumption that this was an update.I copied the files over a working 1.6 game version and now it doesn't start.Every time i try to run it nothing happens except it creates a file inside the game directory with the name HKShip.exe.xxxx.STEAMSTART.So either this crack requires steam installed or as the release name suggests blahblah-1.7-COMPLETE, this is full game and not just update.But i cannot test it,erased the arc file,have to redownload. damn it"
,Moonshaft,2012-11-01T05:46Z,"Yeah...I couldn't get this to work either. I've tried:

1. Unzipping the huge 10GB .arc and copying the crack into the unzipped folder

2. Creating a copy of my original and copy/pasting the .arc content and crack  into my original

Neither of those two worked. Every time I would start the game, it would open right to the Sleeping Dogs page on Steam. Am I doing something wrong, or was this just not cracked correctly?"
,Wrex1,2012-11-01T06:07Z,Shitty Torrent just waisted almost 7gb of bandwidth and hours of download -1
,niad,2012-11-01T06:14Z,Redownloaded it and treated it as a full game.Still nothing.Installed and run steam but as Moonshaft said running the game just opens the game page inside the steam software.I tried to apply the 1.6 crack over it but it hangs at first screen.So screw this and stick with the 1.6 version of the game or keep those files and wait for a new crack by another group.This just doesn't work.8 people rated this up but not one comment confirming it.
,ArchieA,2012-11-01T14:40Z,Does it have the previous UPDATES? tell me please
,VitorCz,2012-11-01T15:05Z,this shit opens steam!
,SpeeDFreaK996,2012-11-01T19:48Z,"
do i have to download every patch to play this one or just this patch"
,Taosinky,2012-11-01T20:39Z,"Dont work neither her.

I have installed the Skidrow Realease then i have patch the game with this release. (and the crack includes in here) -> Nothing lunch -> Steam page.

Nuke release. Dont download it."
,VitorCz,2012-11-01T21:03Z,it auto closes
,MacPain_,2012-11-02T05:29Z,Remove this torrent please. It aint working. Download the new 1.7 update from skidrow. It works!
,VitorCz,2012-11-03T06:35Z,"-1 and reporting as fake, this doesnt work"
,VitorCz,2012-11-03T06:45Z,it comes with a fucking .arc
,XtremeGammer,2012-11-03T10:33Z,"How to Run ?
firstly i downloaded..then extracted the .rar then i got .arc file...i extracted that also then i copied the crack and tried to run using HKship.exe but nothing happened....
now please tell me whether i have to copy all these to the sleeping dogs game directory (without nay patch the first one.) ?"
,DJ-IAN-COOK,2012-11-03T10:39Z,my comment isnt showing up? I got instructions to make this game works
,DJ-IAN-COOK,2012-11-03T11:39Z,"my comments never shows up, go to skidrow website, have instructions there to make this works"

,thechronic_13,2012-11-04T16:26Z,can someone just upload Nightmare in northpoint dlc alone? Like not with the entire game? Thanks.
,81936,2012-11-05T05:35Z,use the free arc and decompressing file .arc good play!
,81936,2012-11-05T05:36Z,make the download a freeARC programe and decompressing file .arc

,hakim462000,2012-11-05T07:55Z,Thanks :)
,hakim462000,2012-11-05T07:56Z,The HKShip.exe didn't work because it's not cracked yet. You need the LumaEmu crack that ghostnet uploaded or grab it from here http:*//bit.*ly/*UtywwW (remove the *)
,adawadawada,2012-11-06T02:36Z,Stick it with this and it works fine. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7785062/Sleeping_Dogs_v1.7_Proper_Crack.incl_DLC_s-P2P
,rastamees,2012-11-09T11:23Z,"doesnt work. extracted it many times and still, when i click HKShip.exe, nothing happens"
,rastamees,2012-11-09T11:24Z,and with the crack in the previous post
,Secretz.R.Us,2012-11-10T21:21Z,"Yes! Got this to work by applying the crack adawadawada listed and it worked. Anyone having problems, make sure to block the HKShip.exe file and allow the buddha.dll file through your firewall. Most anti-virus programs will delete the buddha.dll file and it won't work without it. Thanks uploader!"
,NationalistuND,2012-11-17T10:44Z,"can't extract .arc file! ""WARNING: write error (Disc full?) in compression algorithm tempfile""...help?!"
,7175,2012-11-20T00:04Z,"Works with crack files mentioned above. Great job with arc compression!

Anybody who couldn't figure this out needs to just buy this game and stop whining... seriously.

,RafVne2,2012-11-23T15:27Z,"Hi there.
Thank you for the up.
I'm curious how long did it take you to fully decompress that arc file?
I'm running on PhenomII x4 @3600 for comparison...

I'm asking cauz' I keep getting errors and it seems to take forever using Freearc."
,RafVne2,2012-11-23T15:41Z,"I've never worked with arc files before so, I'm just not sure what's normal and what's not.

For example in the window where it says ""Speed"", it just droops to 1kb/s... actually now it says 0kb/s, and progress bar stays at 0.00%... so is it exactly what I'm supposed to be seeing?

Thanks in advance..."
,RafVne2,2012-11-23T15:49Z,"Non exhaustive pattern lambda error... I guess I'll try again from the scratch, I've never even seen this error before."
,RafVne2,2012-11-23T19:22Z,"@NationalistuND

From what I've read, it might be low free memory on your C: drive, cauz even though you're unpacking it elswhere it still need space on C: for temp files...

... Anyway... I got it finally extracted, but this thing just crashes to desktop, tried sugested fixes... it just doesn't work... I guess I'mm gonna have to redownload an upgrade and not a full version."
