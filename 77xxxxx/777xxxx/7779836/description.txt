Maxim is an international men's magazine targeted at heterosexual adult males and based in the United Kingdom, and known for its pictorials featuring popular actresses, singers, and female models often pictured scantily dressed but not fully nude, sometimes clothed.

In the United States, Maxim is an industry leader, reporting a circulation of 2.5 million readers which they claim is enough to outsell leading competitors GQ, Esquire, and Details combined.[2] The magazine is now using the brand name to market a myriad other magazines and projects.
