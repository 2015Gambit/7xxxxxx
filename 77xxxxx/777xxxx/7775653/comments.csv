Thank you for supplying the show, love the show!

Is it possible to state the date the show's aired in your title? Much oblige! :)"

It may be a little more trouble than PB but it's a whole lot better than paying a greedy loser like scenebalance, who really should be banned from PB and probably will be, once the moderators pick up on what's going on. The very spirit of open exchange that is the essence of PB is contaminated by this creep."
