This is a Japanese pressing of the album "Gentlemen Take Polaroids" by British band 'Japan'. In my opinion, this is the best sounding version of this album, being superior either to its European (Virgin) or American (Caroline) counterparts (which sound slightly muddier). It also sounds more natural than the latest remaster. Manufactured by Toshiba-Emi, this is another of those releases that are now sadly out of print and that deserve to be preserved via online sharing forever. Please, seed it as long as you can.

High resolution covers (original black artwork) have also been included.
