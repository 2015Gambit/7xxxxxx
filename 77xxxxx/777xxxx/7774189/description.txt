The world has ended. There is no hope. No new beginning. Only the
survivors. DEADLIGHT follows the journey of Randall Wayne, a man
searching for his family across Seattle during the aftermath of a 1980s
event that has decimated life on earth. This visually stunning Cinematic
Survival Platformer will challenge you to run, jump, climb, and struggle
for your life as you look for answers and the ones you love.

Features
* A beautiful deadly world where a misstep means death. Sharpen your
surviving instinct and learn to turn the environment from foe to ally.
In this hopeless world, an ordinary man, Randall Wayne, will reveal
himself as a natural born survivor.

* Think. Mindless shooting is never a good idea: there are much more
walking corpses than bullets. Be smart and avoid direct confrontations
whenever you can.

* A suggestive world of darkness. 3D highly detailed models and
environments mixed with 2D sidescroller old school gameplay to create a
vintage 2.5D Cinematic Platformer. Unable to escape from the horror of
this dying world, Randall Wayne's journey will lead him to Seattle, in a
strange search beyond his own survival.

* HD graphics that enhance the immersion and atmosphere of a dead world

* New NIGHTMARE difficulty mode from the 80s. Totally rad!
