,MagiciansFR,2012-10-29T23:26Z,Thank you very much for this. With Demoniod down it is hard to come by good recently published audiobooks. Do you have any tips on a good source or 2 of recent sci-fi/fantasy audiobooks?
,twoeternity,2012-10-31T17:35Z,"Another good source for Sci Fi and Fantasy books is the Undernet. First you need to download ""xchat"". Once you download that and open it, click on ""undernet"" under the available netowrks to connect to and hit ""connect"". A screen should come up that says ""Xchat connection complete"" On that screen click on ""join this channel"" and eneter ""bookz"" then click OK. After you have done this type ""@search David Weber"" or any other auther or title that you are looking for. Gook luck."

Choices are VERY limited and of course unlike torrents you are downloading the whole book, should you be lucky enough to find the one you want, from just one guy--VERY SLOW."
