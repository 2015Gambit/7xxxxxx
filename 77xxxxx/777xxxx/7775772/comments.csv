,Garfelt,2012-11-01T12:55Z,HobbitGames is the best!
,themselvesvaibhavalways,2012-11-01T14:30Z,guys seed plz download speed is 1kb/s .plz plz plz forever
,wwefan91,2012-11-01T16:41Z,I just seeded 12gb.  I'm just one person though. Y'all got to seed too. I can also confirm that this won't work with dolphin 3.0 as it doesn't support wbfs format.  It does work with the latest build of dolphin. Its a little slow at times though. especially on the entrances. Anyways thanks hobbitgamez for the upload.
,themselvesvaibhavalways,2012-11-01T17:44Z,@wwefan91 : r u sure that this will not work in dolphin 3.0 on which i m gonna play it ??
[H],shirepirate,2012-11-02T01:51Z,"it does not necessarily need to support wbfs as this file is easily convert-able. with wii backup manager or wii game manager, for instance"
,wwefan91,2012-11-02T03:03Z,"@themselvesvaibhavalways: You need to convert to iso, elf, dol, gcm, ciso, gcz, or wad to work in dolphin 3.0. Just like shirepirate I use wii backup manager to convert to iso and it now works in dolphin 3.0 or you can just get the latest build of dolphin and it'lll work."
,wwefan91,2012-11-02T03:08Z,"My specs are i5 35700k oc'ed 4.2ghz and intel hd graphics 4000. I get 100% speed in menus. 95%, 105% in entrances and it drops down to 80%-90% speed during gameplay and that's after tweaking some settings. Not sure wheather my gpu is weak or that's as good as dolphin can run it. Other than that the game is great and very much playable."
,ZankmanJack,2012-11-02T03:33Z,Why is playing in Dolphin 3.0 such a big deal? Is it more stable?
,wwefan91,2012-11-02T05:18Z,Not really. I get about the same speed in dolphin 3.0 and latest build for this game so it doesn't really matter.
,themselvesvaibhavalways,2012-11-02T10:56Z,"guys plz suggest how to use dolphin wii backup manager to convert this game to iso format as i m new to dolphin n can i use other converters to convert this to iso like power iso, etc."
,wwefan91,2012-11-02T23:33Z,There are probably other converters out there but wii backup manager is easy to use and requires no installation. Just open the program. Click add under the files tab to add the wbfs check the blank box. Click transfer and iso. Choose save destination. Wait a couple of minutes for file to convert to iso. That's all there is to it. 
,lmnm,2012-11-03T03:32Z,Hey is there anyway you can upload NCAA Football 09 I have looked everywhere for it and cant find it. Or can you direct me to where I can get it.
,wwefan91,2012-11-03T04:16Z,You can easily find the ps2 version of that game on the web and play it on pcsx2.
,themselvesvaibhavalways,2012-11-05T16:31Z,thank u guys for helping me n special thx n wishes to HobbitGamez you r faboulous out of the world 
,ZankmanJack,2012-11-05T20:23Z,"Unfortunately, it's just not playable. :/ My PC is not good enough. Had no issues with getting the game to run and stuff like that, and the game works fine in menus, but the gameplay itself... Slower than SvR 2011 for the PS2."
[H],shirepirate,2012-11-05T22:13Z,"@ZankmanJack

this is a Wii game, not a PC game. complaining that it emulates slow in dolphin because of your low-powered machine isn't really helpful for anyone."
,themselvesvaibhavalways,2012-11-06T21:30Z,it works perfectly for me on pc even better at speed and graphics than wwe 12
,56821,2012-11-08T16:27Z,Or you could just actually play it on a wii.......
,Lobowolf81,2012-11-10T05:26Z,"I try this game using via harddrive on my Wii, using Wii Flow, the game loads well, but when i try to play an exhibition match using for example Hunico vs Jinder Mahal the game stucks during the loading screen. Anyone has the same problem?"
,acr250rider,2012-11-15T02:49Z,Thx HobbitGamez!!!!
,angvil143,2012-11-18T08:36Z,THanks for the upload but how to I burn this to a DVD I converted it using wbfs to iso is that enough ? Now just use imageburn and try it on my chip modded wiii?
