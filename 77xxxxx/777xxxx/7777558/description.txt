In the lands of Middle Earth, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a Ring of Power to control all the peoples and creatures of Middle Earth. The Ring was taken from him and fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit from The Shire - a place of complete innocence. The Ring was then passed onto young Hobbit Frodo Baggins, with one task set before him - to destroy the Ring of Power. Frodo begins his perilous journey through the lands with a Fellowship that will protect him on his mission. Their mission; to destroy the Ring of Power in the only place it can be destroyed - the fires of Mount Doom.
