Read more carefully descriptions(s) next time before comment, besides folks don't give much credibility to your ratting, lol, you're such a sad child.

I mentioned in description ""Remuxed from my old [mkvonly] release."", mkvonly being my old nick.

Secondly both torrents have removed the credits but you obviously didn't bother reading thoroughly. 

Also in these mks-s I added the ""Elvish only"" subtitles...

It's a pity for my effort and time making description if folks don't bother reading it."
