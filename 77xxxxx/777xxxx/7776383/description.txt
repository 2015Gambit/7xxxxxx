We Will Bury You is a story of two lesbian lovers, Miyah and Fanya, set in a zombie-ridden alternate version of the 1920s. Unlike many zombie stories, We Will Bury You does not focus on the main characters' struggle to survive when besieged by a horde of zombies. Instead, the story concentrates on the lovers' relationship and their travels as the roles of women in society change.
