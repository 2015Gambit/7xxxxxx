The Turtles ΓÇô Surrounded By Turtles
5.1 DTS DVD Upmix by Sansdancer

This is my compilation of songs by The Turtles, upmixed to 5.1 DTS surround sound using the Spec method (Slice mode) and tools available on Surroundbyus.com. I also utilized several other audio editing programs. This upmix can only be played on PCs and home theater/audio systems capable of decoding and playing DTS files. You can burn it to a DVD using the ISO file. I recommend ImgBurn for best results.

The Turtles were one of the consistent ΓÇÿhit singleΓÇÖ bands of the 1960ΓÇÖs. They are obviously best known for ΓÇ£Happy TogetherΓÇ¥, but they were able to pull off some big hits even when they werenΓÇÖt trying. For example, Their record company, White Whale, put such heavy pressure on them to come up with another ΓÇ£Happy TogetherΓÇ¥ hit that they purposely wrote what they thought would be a song so blatantly dippy that it would flop and they could go on experimenting with other styles. The resulting intended flop was ΓÇ£ElenoreΓÇ¥. ΓÇ£Gee, I think youΓÇÖre swell.ΓÇ¥ Instead, it too became a major hit for them as the public assumed it was suppose to seem dippy. That was part of the songΓÇÖs charm. A key theme that runs through most of The Turtles music is that they donΓÇÖt take themselves too seriously. That is not to say they are a ΓÇÿjokeΓÇÖ band, but they were always more about having a good time than machismo strutting.

The tracks for the upmix were taken from various CD compilations and full album releases. No one compilation (to my ears) had the best sound on every track, so these come from Rhino, Laser Light, Repertoire and other label collections. I chose what I felt was the best sounding version for each track. There are a few rarities mixed in too. The songs are generally grouped in chronological order, so you can get a sense of how there music developed and grew through their career. Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan (Flo & Eddie) are still touring as The Turtles today. Their live shows are a lot of fun. Go see them if you get the chance.

Also, find the movie ΓÇ£My Dinner With JimiΓÇÖ. It is the true story of the night the Turtles met Jimi Hendrix. Great stuff.
