Welcome to a very moist future, where 'The Big Rain' has turned New York City into a twisted warren of river canyons and skyscraper archipelagos. This action-packed tale, full of Wilson's extraordinary design work, follows the adventures of Eve, a shipwrecked member of a scientific exploration team, who must put her trust in the salvage-hunting Holly if she is to escape, and where danger lurks above and below the water.
