,Mescwalrus,2012-10-31T20:35Z,"I paid to see this movie and it was a complete waste of fucking money.  If you have to see this piece of shit download a cam.  The whole time I sat thru this crap I laughed at the bad acting, terrible story, and the best part was the ending cause the fucking shit was over."

,Mescwalrus,2012-11-10T07:54Z,Wrong Turn 5 was better than this piece of shit.
,mastermalloy,2012-11-13T03:00Z,"This is one of the few horror films of the last decade that is well-written, well-acted, and best of all is actually scary. Keep in mind that most of the people who write comments on this site are whiny little bitches with no taste. Trust me, this movie is surprisingly well done. Thank you for the upload."
