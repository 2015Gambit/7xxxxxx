Mel and Kim were a British pop duo, comprising sisters Melanie and Kim Appleby. 
They achieved success between 1986 and 1988 before Melanie succumbed to cancer.

Mel & Kim were born to British and Jamaican parents. In 1985, Mel recorded two 
demos solo, under Alan Whitehead's management. The producers loved her voice and 
they asked her if she would have someone to sing with. That's how Kim got involved. 
The girls recorded about five demos [according to Mr. Whitehead]. One of these 
songs - "Wild and Crazy Love",a Mary Jane Girls cover - can be heard on the Mel 
and Kim documentary on YouTube. The demos got them signed with Supreme Records, 
and Nick East - president of Supreme - put them in touch with Stock 
Aitken Waterman.
