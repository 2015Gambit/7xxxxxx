Mouse without Borders is a Microsoft Garage project by Truong Do. Garage projects are side projects that Microsoft employees build for fun on their nights and weekends. Mouse without Borders makes you the captain of your computer fleet by allowing you to control up to four computers from a single mouse and keyboard. It also makes you able to copy text or drag and drop files between computers.
