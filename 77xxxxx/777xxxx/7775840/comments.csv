i have a question... how can i play the movies with 5.1ch audio??

i have a blu ray with home theater, can i save the movie in a usb drive and plug it directly?? will it play the 5.1?? 

Thanks!!"
,Hambosas,2012-11-02T20:20Z,"@ROFLJ0rs I don't own a blu-ray player or blu-rays for that matter, I just use mkv files and then convert them to m4v which can be used on iTunes/iPods/iPhones/iPads and Apple-TV. You might try using a usb drive but really i don't know, my suggestion is invest in an Apple-TV, I hear they are worth it and you can play all the iTunes movies on it"
,ROFLJ0rs,2012-11-02T23:20Z,@Hambosas thanks for reply. i will watch it on the blu ray player and will let you know what happened!!
