There is a corresponding NFO file in each folder so have a look at that for specifics of each program.

WATCH OUT: NOD32 complains that the Optimizer's cplex executable in the bin directory is infected with some sort of virus. Here's the virustotal.com report: https://www.virustotal.com/file/3d5cb330cdee34e3551311b33b80430abd5db140f29c39945143f43aa986c252/analysis/1351561885/ (be careful and consider yourself warned!)

All credit goes to EAT (although I'm not sure about that virus) - I merely found all this on usenet.
