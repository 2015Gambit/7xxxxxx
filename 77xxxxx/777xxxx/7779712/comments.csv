,gazza2009,2012-11-01T07:17Z,EnemyDrone what ur problem??? relaxxx...
,phillymike32,2012-11-01T07:47Z,this could possibly be one of the worst cams i have ever seen.
,hcfwesker,2012-11-01T08:18Z,"wah wah, philly!  It's watchable.  but gonna let those know, before they download,  the audio is about 30 seconds ahead of the video.  so prob best to wait for another version, or edit the audio back in sync yourself."
,phillymike32,2012-11-01T08:51Z,im not complaining. i appreciate all the uploads and i also appreciate peoples comments before i download a movie.

,dieagain20113,2012-11-01T14:40Z,"audio is quite ok, 7

,MalevolentLoki,2012-11-01T21:23Z,I've seen better cam vids and worse but the important thing is the audio is in english.  So thanks a lot for the upload.
,joegreg13,2012-11-01T21:38Z,watchable I would say about 5 for both. It is not really his fault it was the movie itself. It is too dark for a great cam of it. 
,DreaD151,2012-11-04T19:24Z,"ThaNKS  guys for taking up for the work of Acesn8s if it wasnt for people like him Legend,Hero,Scene,Bone,and more we wouldnt have these damn movies to watch they dont record them just edit them to try TRY to make the watchable .... so next time you say ""Fuck you douchbag this cam sucks"" think about it for a damn minute these guys do this for FREE!
