Pid is a creative, stylish, retro-flavored platforming adventure game designed to turn everything you know about 2D gameplay upside down. You play as a young boy that gets stranded on an old remote planet. He must fight off a variety of malicious robots bent on stopping him and befriend unlikely allies to shed light on a huge conspiracy that keeps the planet mesmerized and prevents him from ever reaching home.

The core feature in Pid allows players to manipulate a powerful force that can be used to maneuver around the levels in thousands of unique ways. In Pid, two players can experience the adventure together in co-op mode and help one another navigate tricky puzzles.
