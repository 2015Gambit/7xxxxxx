,GambitWallstar,2012-10-31T09:56Z,I don't want to have to go through and pick out each one individually to download. Maybe next time you should try uploading individually... Just an idea...

Start reading the provided info.
***Notes: Big upload so seed, to big for your hard drive, get a new one or download 1 by 1 iso file.***

I not going to place 55xDVD individually, u ever try to load 55 torrents in your download/upload-client.
