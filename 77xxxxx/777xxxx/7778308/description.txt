Book Description
Many designers enjoy the interfaces seen in science fiction films and television shows. Freed from the rigorous constraints of designing for real users, sci-fi production designers develop blue-sky interfaces that are inspiring, humorous, and even instructive. By carefully studying these ΓÇ£outsiderΓÇ¥ user interfaces, designers can derive lessons that make their real-world designs more cutting edge and successful.

Make It So shows:
- Sci-fi interfaces have been there (almost) from the beginning
- Sci-fi creates a shared design language that sets audience expectations
- If an interface works for an audience, thereΓÇÖs something there that will work for users
- Bad sci-fi interfaces can sometimes be the most inspiring
- There are ten ΓÇ£meta-lessonsΓÇ¥ spread across hundreds of examples
- You can useΓÇöand not just enjoyΓÇösci-fi in your design work
- Over 150 lessons and 10 ΓÇ£metaΓÇ£ lessons that developers can use to enhance their realworld interfaces
