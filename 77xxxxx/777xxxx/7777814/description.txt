THIS IS A CORRECTION. IF YOU DOWNLOADED IT ALREADY, ONLY CD #2 HAS CHANGED AND THAT IS ALL YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD. IT HAD A GLITCH OF SOME KIND NEAR THE END AND CHUNK OF THE TEXT WAS REPLACED BY A BLANK SPACE (AT ABOUT 1:17:17 FOR 20 SECONDS).

NOTE: This is a direct rip from the CD's. 

LISTENER WARNING: Don't narrators EVER listen to the previous books? Or at least talk to the author? The new narrator is very hard to listen to because he pronounces so many place and person names in the book differently (at least different from ALL the other narrators - and he can't even pronounce regular words correctly sometimes, too), and he is OVERLY dramatic in his reading.  But, until something better comes out (SOON PLEASE), this is all there is.  Remember, the first book was read by Martha Harmon Pardee, and RE-READ by Oliver Wyman in a much better reading (I have both), so it IS possible that a re-read could be done. Funny thing is, the imprinted CD's say "Read by Peter Ganim", so maybe this is a replacement reader.



Description:

After centuries of stasis, the island kingdom of Charis began to defy the edicts of the Church of God Awaiting - egged on, some say, by the mysterious warrior-monk Merlin Athawes. Now, in the wars and intrigues that have cascaded from Charis's declaration of independence, the populous Republic of Siddermark is sliding into chaos. Vicar Clytahn of the Church of God at harvest time, King Cayleb of Charis, his queen Sharleyan, and Merlin Arthawes will have their hands full trying to stave off wholesale starvation in Siddermark while at the same time shipping in enough land combat units to fend off the "volunteers" from the Church's Temple Lands. And while Vicar Clyntahn is hailed in the Church for his boldness and audacity, there are those who remember how dependent Church power is on money from Siddermark...and who wonder what will happen if Siddermark starves.

Bursting with vivid invention and the sweep of lived history, Midst Toil and Tribulation will build its series' audience to a new level.
