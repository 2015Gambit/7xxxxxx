,Shadow416,2012-10-31T03:42Z,lol @ shmidy i haven't finished downloading yet but I'm sure there are profiles that you need to transfer over from the skidrow folder. once that's done you probably need to either disconnect from the internet to make life easier or just completely block the game's exe with the firewall so the game cannot access the internet. Once you run the game the skidrow profile should be there and you should be able to login through that.

,Shadow416,2012-10-31T20:12Z,"ok @ everyone who is struggling with the profile thing. I just got back from school and installed it myself so here's what to do its very simple my friends.

my specs: windows 7 ultimate 64bit
software: Alcohol 120%

1. Mount the ISO file in Alcohol 120%
2. Install Game, deselect desktop icon shortcut
3. Once game finishes installation, if a shortcut for the desktop is still made delete it.
4. Open My Computer, Click on BD-Rom Drive: Need for speed wanted
5. (You may need to add acceptions to your antivirus for this part) Open skidrow folder right click NFS file copy.
6. Go to installation directory, so Program Files(x86) > EA > NFS
7. Paste the file in there and REPLACE existing one.
8. Click start menu, in the search box type Firewall, SELECT FIREWALL WITH ADVANCED SECURITIES
9. On the Left hand side you should see ""Outbound Rules"" left click it then right click it, click NEW RULE
10. ""What type of rule would you like to create?"" PROGRAM, click next
11. Select ""this program path"" browse to the need for speed installation directory and select the NFS13 file that you copied over, click open, click next
12. Select BLOCK THE CONNECTION, click next
13. SELECT ALL BOXES, DOMAIN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC MAKE SURE THEY'RE ALL FILLED IN WITH A CHECKMARK, click next
14. Give the Rule a name i called it NFS (cuz i only have one NFS game installed), then click finish, close firewall window

15. go back to installation directory, go to the NFS13 file you copied over right click > send to > desktop (create shortcut, then place that shortcut wherever you like)

16. Run the shortcut file, when you reach the part where it says you need origin to access the online content, give it a middle finger and press A (i use 360 controller) or press Enter w.e option, you should then be lead right into the game Intro and the game will start after.


Have fun....please note that I JUST started the game so i dont know if i have the full game or not...but i've gotten past the origin account thing. 


Enjoy folks"

,killergik,2012-10-31T22:57Z,i did all i have to do to make this game working. im using xp 32bit and when I start the game a sing pops up and it says that a file named dxgi.dll could not be found what should i do pls some one help
,roastmeat,2012-10-31T23:13Z,"Upvote for extremezone, game downloaded nicely

Just a few times the speed dipped below 20kbps, just be patient.

For those having problems with getting the game running, its like oldschool cracks:
1 - Mount iso
2 - Open folder
3 - Double click setup and install
4 - Go into the folder in the iso called SKIDROW
5 - Copy NFS13.exe
6 - After install do NOT open game, paste NFS13.exe in installation folder (c:/program files/EA games/Most wanted) or something like that
7 - COPY AND REPLACE
8 - enjoy

Issues:
I have a pretty good computer, on all graphics settings the game freezes a bit, gets worse the longer you play, otherwise great game!"

I rate it 0/1000000000000 for fucking up the 2nd best racing game title.. the best being Midnight Club."

,JesseS420,2012-11-04T04:37Z,"This game is fucking trash. The graphics aren't that great and the frames dip horribly. I tried locking my frames to 30 in the config file which helped a little bit, but is in fact still shit. Also if you plan on using a controller plug it in before you launch the game otherwise if fucks up the steering sensitivity horribly. Thanks for the torrent, but this game is garbage."
,metalyger,2012-11-04T07:39Z,"This game wasn't very good at all, or at least the PC version anyway. I expected most of the negative comments to be typical internet hate but the game just wasn't worth the time. It's hard to complain about something you got 1000% free that normally costs $60 but this game was a shoddy port. It has a lot of framerate dips, from what I've read it has v-sync on constantly and you can't disable it. You just know the controls are bad when a modern PC game by default uses the arrow keys instead of WSAD. After remapping the controls, I discovered that the steering is way too sensitive like a tap left or right sends you off like a bat out of hell. They really didn't put much effort into the PC version."

But man the game itself is horrible, the game engine isn't optimized (What a shotty port), the steering oversteers (Even tried a controller and still could barely manage), the crash cam is driving me nuts I want to turn it off, everything is handed over to you and there isn't even a bloody story-line.

My laptop does an alright job running bf3 and other games but framerate on this game tanks down to unplayable levels for long periods of time.

Buy rFactor2 if you want serious good online fun.

As iRacing , neither of these titles will ever be ""effectively"" ripped.

Thank you extremezone for another quality rip. I'm running Windows 7 x64 which apparently required a missing .dll which was easily sourced and installed. The game runs fairly well but sometimes runs windowed? That may just be my setup.
This game is about 75% Burnout Paradise, 10% Need for Speed and 15% god-awful half-breed.

Why cant EA get it right? The original Most Wanted was, in my opinion, the best racing game ever (minus the childish stupidity of excessive vehicle customisation requirements). In this the controls are unimpressive to say the least."

,blaze305,2012-11-19T19:46Z,"Great torrent! Worked perfectly.
As for the game, I uninstalled it after the first most wanted race. The graphics are great, and so is the racing, but it lacks in story. They just throw you into races and tell you to win. Call me old fashioned but the original Most Wanted excelled because of its storyline. I might download again soon and give it another shot.

TL;DR, It's worth trying out."
,nelbkw,2012-11-20T00:03Z,"I'm from Brazil. Please, I have a dream of having this game, but I'm poor in this thid world country. I want it for christmas — I'm crying right now, but it's too expensive due to the high taxes. We must pay 400 dolars for a game here in Brazil and I earn just 300 a month. It would help so much to achieve this wish of my dreams if you just simply subscribe to my youtube gamer channel: ""contentegamer"" (have just 1080p gamming footages and I earn some cents if you just subscribe to my channel). Search on youtube and help me and my child. Thank you so much and god bless you all.

P.s: I just wanted to be one day in a first world country and could buy a game. I'd be the happiest person on earth."
,Hackerpcs,2012-11-20T02:01Z,"@nelbkw
Don't whine for subscribers as you aren't going to earn anything from YouTube without creative content (how would you see a channel with 500k subs and no videos?). I'm from Greece and my country is in a lot worse situation even from Argentina in 2000-2002. The only solution is pirating, 60€ for a game is ridiculous when the basic salary is 586€ per month. You must be a bot though, as you can't be dreaming of having a game you haven't tried out."

,johnalex10,2012-11-23T19:06Z,"In reference to karthikhe, burning refers to copying the game files over onto a CD, whereas mounting refers to using a virtual drive program such as Daemon Tools Lite (Google it, very good program) to make the game think it's on a CD.

It makes it much easier to manage these things overall and I suggest getting Daemon Tools as they don't have a size limit."

You need to download Daemon Tools or PowerISO if you do not have those already.

Once those are installed you right-click on the .iso file, and go to the PowerISO sub menu and you click to mount to a virtual drive. If you have Daemon tools then you go to the bottom right of your desktop to the small icons, right-click on the deamon icon (silver circle with blue lightning bolt) and you click to mount to a drive, you browse to the file then click.

Now the iso should appear on ""My Computer"" as if you inserted an actual CD. This is for Windows because thats what i run on:P"

This game will NOT run on Win7 64 using a Radeon 6870 period. I have tried EVERYTHING to solve this, including a complete Win7 Reinstall, old/new drivers, compatibility modes, reinstalling DirectX, etc...

This crack is complete shit and not up to the quality of a SKIDROW release."

Had to close it with Task Manager and from this point, the game justs starts and all the time shows Loading and never goes to main menu.
Tried even to uninstall and reinstall and no difference.
Any ideas?"
