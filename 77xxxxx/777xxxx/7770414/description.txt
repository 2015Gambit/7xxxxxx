 The head of a traditional family and a union leader, Otávio clashes with his son Tião over their opposing views and values on class solidarity. Both of them work in the same company, but Tião sees the union’s politics as the reason for the family’s misery. He’s more interested in material consumption and worries about his pregnant girlfriend. Afraid of losing his job, Tião misses a strike organized by his father, marking the start of a family conflict.
