Plunge into the realm of wild dolphins in this Great Adventure Film Series hit from MacGillivray Freeman Films, producers of the
large-format films Everest and The Living Sea. In Dolphins, you will experience the warm, white sandbanks of the Bahamas where

Then travel to the wind-swept waters of Argentina where duskies, the most acrobatic of all dolphins, work together in a beautifully
choreographed hunt for food. Brimming with details about the complex lives of these fascinating animals, this ocean adventure film
takes you into the very heart of the world of Dolphins.
