,zharkan,2012-11-11T13:50Z,"I will now help you how to install the game. :


You need Custom Firmware to run this game.
this game is pirated, so It won't run on normal FW.

I suggest google-ing ''PSP PRO B9''

Then, it will give you 3 files. just copy them from computer - to - PSP and put in Game folder.

Then, run the file that says PROUPDATE.

It will automatically hack your PSP. Then, every time you turn your PSP off and on again, just run  FASTRECOVERY. No need for a pandora battery,  opening the psp, no money to waste... ITS FREE!

After the hack, make a folder in the root of your PSP,  called ISO. (MUST.BE.ALL.BIG.LETTERS!)

Then, put this game into the ISO folder. Enjoy the beautiful PES 2013!"
