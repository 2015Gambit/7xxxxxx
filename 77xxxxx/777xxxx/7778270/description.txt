Book Description
We all tell stories. ItΓÇÖs one of the most natural ways to share information, as old as the human race. This book is not about a new technique, but how to use something we already know in a new way. Stories help us gather and communicate user research, put a human face on analytic data, communicate design ideas, encourage collaboration and innovation, and create a sense of shared history and purpose. This book looks across the full spectrum of user experience design to discover when and how to use stories to improve our products. Whether you are a researcher, designer, analyst or manager, you will find ideas and techniques you can put to use in your practice.

- Need to share research and design insights in a compelling and effective way
- Struggle to communicate the meaning of a large body of data in a way that everyone just ΓÇ£getsΓÇ¥
- Want to explore a new, innovative idea, and imagine its future
