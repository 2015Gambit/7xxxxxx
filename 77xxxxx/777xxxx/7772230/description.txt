For everybody out there who can't download Bootcamp utilities from the Bootcamp Assistant, there it is (I've been trying for weeks and it kept stopping right in the middle of the download).

This has been downloaded from Apple, with the Bootcamp Assistant on a late 2009 MBP 13"

Version 4.0

All languages available.

Just run the setup.exe from Windows and it will install all required drivers.

Tested on Windows 8 Pro 32 bits, seems to work flawlessly, and it doesn't display an error message like "this version of Windows is not supported" (I had this kind of message with every Bootcamp package I downloaded on TPB).

Works on Windows 7 x32 et x64

I don't know if it works on previous Windows version, but you're welcome to share in comments.

Enjoy :)

PS : be a little patient with the download at first, I'm stuck at about 400kB/s upload until november 1st.
