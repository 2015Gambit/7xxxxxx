Any feedback on other machines is appreciated (especially with 64 bits W8)"

I just needed to update the graphics driver (from nvidia.com) because it's not compatible with Windows 8 (causes random freezes).

But, by updating this driver with the latest WHQL, I lost the capability to control brightness from the keyboard (known bug for all nvidia drivers newer than the one released by Apple with Bootcamp).

I don't know who is to blame to lost this control : Nvidia for having change something in the driver API ? Or Apple for having modify the Nvidia driver to fit his need ?

After all, thanks for that upload : Apple sucks at not providing this on his website.

We're waiting for them to release Bootcamp for Windows 8 !"

I didn't have any problem with the Nvidia driver provided in this version of Bootcamp running on Windows 8 Pro x86 on my MBP (same year as yours, but better proc). Maybe there are compatibility issues with the 64 bits Windows 8.

Anyway, I also tested it on a later MacBook Pro (Geforce 320M chip) with Win 8 Pro x86 and it worked :-)

And you're welcome, I spent hours trying to find this on Apple's website but they don't provide it... Glad to help !"
