@ greenwheel, and all RAR haters, if he's also uploading to irc or usenet, splitting files is a must to avoid transfer corruption on big files.

 Just install Winrar (its a good tool to have) Right click the *.rar file, drag-n-drop to any folder, click extract here. this way you can use the file and still seed the original for wks and build up share ratio.

If you need Winrar go here:
