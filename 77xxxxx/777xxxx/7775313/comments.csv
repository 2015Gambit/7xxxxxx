I tried in different, powerful machines with different players and it's the same. It's the encoding. The sound gets out of sync because of this problem. I recommend to uploaders and seeders to watch the whole thing before uploading. Third time it happens to me with this kind of rip. First was Zodiac, then London Boulevard and now this one. Please don't download and don't seed anymore unless you're 100% fine with what was said."
