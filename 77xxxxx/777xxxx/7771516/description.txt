Windows 8 Watermark + Activation Fix



1.) I did not make this program, I just spent endless hours trying to make my windows 8 watermarks and activation popups go away so im sharing this so that you dont have to :)

2.) Right click on "OnThreeSeas.exe" and click "Run as Administrator"

3.) The Program will open. Click "Install" then wait for the program to do its thing. Restart computer to complete process

4.) After rebooting you will notice that all watermarks have disappeared.

5.) Right click on "OnThreeSeasPersonalization.exe" and select "Run as Administrator"

6.) You can then personalize Windows 8 using this program


Enjoy,
