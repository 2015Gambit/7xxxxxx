------------------------------------------------------------

Screen icons Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck continue the fun in season two of
The Looney Tunes Show, a modern, animated half-hour comedy series. Living
together on a suburban cul-de-sac, our favorite mismatched roommates hit
the ground laughing, along with beloved Looney Tunes characters from the
first season, including Porky, Lola, Speedy, Tina and many more. This season,
find out what happens when Bugs becomes addicted to PorkyΓÇÖs buttery catering,
or when Gossamer turns into a frog after Lola mistakes the WitchΓÇÖs spell book
for a bedtime story. And can Daffy, Lola and Foghorn Leghorn help the town
find their holiday spirit during a Christmas heat wave? The fun continues in
the looniest neighborhood on television, along with all-new Merrie Melodies,
original songs and music videos featuring your favorite Looney Tunes characters.

When Bugs tells a small lie to Porky, it gathers steam to make everything
far worse - and inadvertently prompts Daffy to join the U.S. Marines.
Plus, in the Merrie Melodies "Moostache", Yosemite Sam's mustache
sings to him about all the wonderful times they've had together.
