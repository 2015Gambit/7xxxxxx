,MsMuffet,2012-11-01T13:11Z,I did not realise that MsFenmore is in Germany! Well - you're most certainly safe from the problems in the USA except for access to your usual source. How wonderful of you to take the time to provide us with our favourite show ... many thanks again. These fabulous episodes leading up to Susan Flannery's final appearance are real treasures IMHO. Long time viewers are taking a trip down memory lane but they are equally enjoyed by the new fans who are not aware of the history over 25 years. I have to agree with Dimmis80 - Stephanie was and is still stunning and without a doubt the unchallenged Queen of Daytime TV. I'm going to miss the professionalism she brings to the show.
,Dimmis80,2012-11-01T17:02Z,Amen to that MsMuffet.It will be for ever our Queen..
,sheilaforever,2012-11-01T23:48Z,I prefer the larger files; I find the quality to be better. And we get to see the credits. It's great!
