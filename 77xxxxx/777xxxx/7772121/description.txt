NOTES:
Videos ...matine,pretty nice but had missing scenes,some camera movement,Ar changes throughout,colour/brightness/contrast levels seemed
to change throughout aswell.
Hp ...not as sharp,got some blares,borders,ar off,but does contain the missing scenes.
Audio ...jiinx ,found this the best line out the two and unique did a good sync job...keep up the good work both :)


WORKDONE:

Well will be honest and say i took matines encoded and re-encoded it ..BUT fixed alot of issues that it had.First the AR problem now like
stated above it changes throughout,but i also noticed from around 35mins you got borders appear down the right,across the top and a slight
angled one in the bottom left corner....so i opted to cut them out and then resized the video back up to 720 x 272...looks better now,but
still does change throughout.
From there i notice the colours/brightness/contrast levels seemed to change as if it was several videos used for it ...who knows.Anyway opted
to cut the video into 3 parts and change all the levels for the brightness,contrast,sat,intes,sharpen,smoother differently for each part.
Now seems better and comparing the two side by side you wil see ;-)
Once done it was onto the audio ...this is where i noticed uniques sync job different fit ,so needed an offset then around 1hr19 i noticed there
was a skip ...so when back to the HP video cut the video from that ...cleaned it up and resized it and added it too my encode....then i just needed
to reline the audio and hey presto,back insync.

Finally step was dropping the audio into AA ...give it a touch more lovin,and saved as mp3 and remuxed.

Enjoy folks......
