,DannyBoyDannyBoy1974,2012-11-05T00:47Z,"***WARNING TO DOWNLOADERS*** Though labeled ""DVDRip,"" this encoding is NOT ripped from a bona fide English-language release (R1 or R2 DVD). It is an ""R5 Line"" and should be labeled as such.

Even if it is prior to the official R1 or R2 release date, bona fide DVDrip encodings of English-language films CAN and sometimes DO appear if the source has been leaked from the production run of R1/R2 DVDs; so it is not obvious that an encoding labeled ""DVDRip"" is an R5 Line if it appears before official release. Unfortunately, unscrupulous release groups will often purposely label their R5 Lines as ""DVDRip"" to inflate the popularity of their releases.

Why should you care? R5s of English-language films are DVDs released in Region 5 (Russia, et al.) with foreign-language audio, and most often lack the expensive image post-processing that films released in DVD Regions 1 & 2 receive. That means video inferior to the video you get with R1 and R2. To get the English audio, the audio from the theatrical release is pirated digitally from the movie theatre by running an audio line to a recording device, resulting in a capture which almost always includes electronic noise in the form of clicks, pops, sharp static, and an ever-present hum or hiss. So ""R5 Line"" means both video and audio inferior to a ""DVDRip"" of R1/R2 DVD releases.

The more we spread the word about mislabeled R5 Lines in the file-sharing communities, the sooner mislabeled uploads like this can die and the more bandwidth we all save."

The Arnold version is about 5 times better in every other department!  The CG graphics and sets in this one are slightly better - and that's it.  Also the sound in this one was boosted - so there's lots of over-modulation rumbles and hisses. Whoever ripped this (Lum1x ?) is a n00b dork!

So this torrent is a bit of a miss IMO. Wait for the 3 or 4 gigabyte HD 720p or 1080p version and skip this one!

Seriously!"
,UberDooD,2012-11-07T07:02Z,"People saying A 10, V 10, M 10 must be total n00bs with nothing to compare to. 

Given that this is a DVD RIP and not a TS or something the rating should be:

A 5
V 8

The M (Movie entertainment value) rating will depend on whether or not the viewer has seen the Arnold version. Again, the only betterment in this version over the Arnold version is the CG.

Acting is poorer,
Choreography is poorer,
CG while better than the original is relatively poor for a 2012/2013 film.
BGM is poorer,
etc. 

So M should IMO, be:

M 8"

stop chew on your daddys cum fuckface, if I want to  give movie reviews I will, no matter what you think about it. If you don't like it, GTFO and leave this site u inbred piece of shit, none of us wants you here anyways


So, heres the review:
Did you ever see the original Total Recall? then don't waste your time on this, unless you have very low expectations. Everything from acting to atmosphere, 'tis all better in the original. And the story, they made a great sci-fi story in to a pretty lame standard action flick. They should have just ripped the original straight off.

It might sound really bad, but it isn't. the movie is worth a watch, but I can never recommend this when the orignal is so much better

Don't feel like scrolling through these comments to find out if you got a better suggestion that opens subs, so here you go...

For movies: Subscene

For TV: Addic7ed

Basically the only 2 sub sites you'll ever need.

If you ever need the very latest bbc/uk subtitles (like, the night something airs or the morning after), go to MemoryOnSmells' great site, uksubtitles dot ru. Eventually, his stuff gets posted to addic7ed; but if you need it quick, go to his homesite. 

Hope that helps! :)

----------------

Sincere thx to scene4all and all seeders AND leechers... Much appreciated all.

Will seed to 20 or more."
,libertaswv,2012-11-09T00:04Z,@Fito40 - forgot to mention that addic7ed allows you to filter for your language pref. Easy-peazy. :)

,hachiko00,2012-11-12T12:38Z,to all the faggots that say this is poor compared to the first one....are you fucking nuts? This is a very good remake even if you know the story. There's even a little twist at the end that was not in the other one. 
,hachiko00,2012-11-12T12:39Z,"stop writing stupid comments with links to your shit sites. 

This is NOT a 10 in a/v

which is about right for a dvd rip @ 702 x 304"

,zenheathen,2012-11-15T04:04Z,"Is there some unwritten rule that people on this site who leave comments must be total asshats? Jesus Christ! You're getting something for free, because someone cared enough to make it available. If something is not to your personal liking, just say you aren't fond of it. I've never seen such thankless, thoughtless and mean spirited people... and I work with the public. "

The movie started off well, then it turns into a gongshow IMO. I don't remember anything after the piano scene. No spoiler alert."

,kisszom,2012-11-21T09:53Z,"This is off topic, but you people need to get ready. November 28th AT&T Cox Time Warner is going to put the boot on downloading and infingments. I will be accessing the interwebz from a coffee shop from then on. BOYCOTT these mother  fuckers! Do not PAY your MASTERS to stay a slave! Give your ISP the Boot Nov. 28th 2012. If we work together they will backtrack on this shit with a quickness! Google ISP Block Nov. 28th and see for yourself!"
