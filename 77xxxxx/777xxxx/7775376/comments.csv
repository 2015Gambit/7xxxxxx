,dumbson,2012-10-31T01:03Z,what does R6 mean?  is it just a gussied up cam?
,kitttik,2012-10-31T01:32Z,"Yes, it is the same R6 that was uploaded a few weeks ago.

V - 6
A - 4

Good for a cam, but not worth the DL."
,Kanegasi,2012-10-31T03:44Z,A little late with that source there. Two other people already uploaded that ages ago.
,islandinthesun,2012-11-02T05:13Z,"r6 is not a camjob.

r6 = dvd region code for china, hong kong"

,upx3,2012-11-03T23:09Z,"Attn Pirate Bay Admin:
Uploaders who mislabel Cam or TS as R*, should have their Trusted or VIP status revoked. 
This includes mislabeled RC as BluRay (retail release) rip.
It only takes seconds to check BEFORE uploading, there's no excuse.
Isn't that the reason that there's a Trusted or VIP status ?"
,thecats2011,2012-11-04T02:39Z,yes any person involved in mislabeling should be removed even if it is a skull . also there should be a report this torrent button 
,JeffCC,2012-11-05T02:27Z,FKing WATERMARK!!! FUCK U GANOOL
,DJeez91,2012-11-06T06:23Z,"Plain and simple this is not watchable. 
It is not 720. 
That implies 720 hd when it's clearly a shitty copy.
Not knocking your other work because I'm new to the site and don't know it but this is wrong to do."
,GateKeeper13,2012-11-08T12:37Z,Stop calling TS videos R6!!!!! R6 are the DVD released in CHINA and have DVD QUALITY! That piece of shit is just a Telesync you moron!
,rcr29budcar,2012-11-12T01:35Z,"It doesn't mean this is a 720p bluray quality movie numnuts!  It means it was recorded with a 720p HD camera!  Its not mislabled!  Before making dumb shit comments about things you know nothing about,  do a little research!  All these comments saying its mislabled are comments from a bunch of newbs who are new to TPB.  "
