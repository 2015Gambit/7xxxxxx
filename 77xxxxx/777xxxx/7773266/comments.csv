,dmaja,2012-10-31T11:21Z,"This is another version of kj pirate activator itself. But with the old activator, the activation process fails and restarts. But i found the activator in this torrent does the job and restarts the computer. 

But after restart, when i tried to change the theme, windows is displaying some 3 error boxes with some 0xC... error message. And can't change personalisation options.

Can anybody tell that, why this happens. I'm using windows 8 RTM Build 9200 with product activation removed by default. "
,John_Hill,2012-10-31T11:30Z,"Το @dmaja, I'm using the same version of Windows 8 and all are working fine till now.
You should format your system again and run this activator as admin.
You should have no problem after that."

,lavir74,2012-10-31T23:12Z,"People don't use these ""permanent"" activators, they do NOTHING.

THERE'S NO PERMANENT ACTIVATOR AS OF NOW. These ""activators"" just remove the watermark and change some system files to cheat activation, BUT YOU ARE NOT ACTIVATED REALLY.

The only way to activate W8 is with KMS as of now. If you then want to have a permanent activation there's a way, getting a product key for media center.

DON'T USE THESE ACTIVATORS, THEY WILL BREAK SYSTEM FILES AND AFTER YOU CANNOT ACTIVATE TRULY, NEITHER WITH A KMS SERVER.

Use a kms server instead. Sooner or later a REAL permanent activator will come, but there's none right now and the only way to truly activate is via kms (and to permanently activate via a product key for media center)."
,fish4net,2012-11-02T01:54Z,"@ John_Hill

i installed the activator and it extracted files and then restarted and then after the login by entering the password.... nothing is coming up.

no start screen... nothing at all.
i do get access to Task manager by using Ctr + Alt + Del... but nothing else at all.

tell me something i should do to fix this."
