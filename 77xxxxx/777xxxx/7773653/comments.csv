,bestseo,2012-11-07T05:09Z,"anyone have an issue with this saying ""can't read from this disc"" after loading the start screen? I was converting to ISO with wii game manager and burning with imgburn at 4x"

try burning at a slower speed like 2x and use sony or verbatim discs"
,machymach,2012-11-11T19:46Z,Seems to work fine but I think this game does contain a lot of spoilers from the film... I think I'll wait to play until I've seen the movie
