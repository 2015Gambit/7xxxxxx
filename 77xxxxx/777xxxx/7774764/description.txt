Season 2 , Episode 1 - ΓÇ£African WerewolfΓÇ¥
Reports are coming in from Tanzania that sound like theyΓÇÖre straight out of a horror movie. The peace of the farmlands is being disturbed by the blood curdling screams of farmers being dragged off to their deaths by a huge violent creature. Locals say the beast is so murderous and cunning that it could be a human transformed into an animal. Not only that but they say the full moon is a sign of impending attack. Sounds like Richard is on the tail of an African Werewolf.
