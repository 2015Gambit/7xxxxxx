          ReFX Nexus 2 Pop Expansion Pack





      This is where Nexus2 demonstrates its potential as a All-In-One
      Pop band:
 Organs, winds, pianos, strings, drums,  
      choirs, basses... In a nutshell:
      A
 band consisting of 128 players who always have the
      time to meet and who
 always hit the tone!


      Of course, this expansion  is not restricted to  
      pop - you need such basic
 sounds every now and then.
