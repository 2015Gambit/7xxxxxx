,bapcanpirate,2012-10-30T20:19Z,"If anyone downloaded the Installed Steam Files version with Themperror's crack, you can get DLC working by switching the crack with TinyISO's 'crack only' file, so you don't need to redownloaded the whole TinyISO torrent. You still need to create the Content folder under SteamApps/Rocksmith/"
