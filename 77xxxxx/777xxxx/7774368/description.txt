Hey, It's me again,

Here are 5 more songs

Heart- Barracuda
My Chemical Romance - Na na na
My Chemical Romance - Welcome to the black parade
The Blues brother band - Soul man

Have fun, The A7X that comes out later today will be added too.

These songs were gifted to me by piratefs and kbdobbs78

if anyone likes to gift more songs for everyone

You can add me on steam : Themperror or PM me on the cs_rin_ru  forum (change the _ to .)

We'll discuss about which DLC's have already been gifted or shared and stuff so we won't receive copies of songs we already have (and thus wasting money)
