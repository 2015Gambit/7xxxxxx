Famed oceanic filmmaker Howard Hall (Into the Deep) guides this
immersive adventure that lets you swim alongside some of the most
exotic creatures of the planet. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet provide
the narration. And an unusual array of finned and scaled stars are
ready to steal every scene. Among them: Green Sea Turtles who gather
off Kona so that Surgeonfish can strip harmful algae from their
shells... an ominous, predatory Humboldt Squid that changes color
four times per second like a flashing strobe light... an underdog
Mantis Shrimp, whose claws have the speed of a 22-caliber bullet, in
battle against a hungry octopus (the shrimp wins!). So many creatures.
So many amazing stories. Sea them all.
