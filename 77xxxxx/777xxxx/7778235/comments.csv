,topeak,2012-10-31T22:20Z,"It is what it is... an R5 rip. 
In the real world, that equals
A-5
V-7
Sound is fuzzy, bass has plenty of distortion. It's alright if you've already seen it, but if you haven't, wait for a proper Retail DVDrip which can't be far behind, probably in a week or so. 

Thanks for the up, though Extreme. "

Thanks, Extremezone! You're awesome."
