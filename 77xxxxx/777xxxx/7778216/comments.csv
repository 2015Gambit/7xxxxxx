In my humble opinion it's OK not to buy this album and download it instead if:
1.You don't have the money to buy it (e.g. you're unemployed or your monthly salary is under 300 euros)
2.Your parents won't buy you this album (if you're a kid) 
3.You've already bought it.
4.You're going to a Dinosaur Jr. show (well, you should consider buying it - you could get signed copy at the show, if you're lucky).
5.You're planning to buy it.
6.You're just checking it out (that's cool but wouldn't it be easier to download mp3s first?).

This is a lossless album rip (I found it somewhere on the net), so you'll probably burn it to a cd and print the covers and all that. That's nice but buy a legal copy someday.
I mean, if you care about the music, you should care about the musicians."
