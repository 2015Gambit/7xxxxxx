A cavalry outpost in the Wild West of 19th Century USA is in need of horses. The captain of the outpost gets word that they're to receive a shipment of fine Arabians. What he gets is a shipment of...camels. Written by Afterburner

The US Cavalry tried camels out in the southwestern desert for a short--but memorable--period of time. Horses were having a tough time in the arid climate, and the "powers that be" thought that camels might just be a better option. Needless to say, the results were comical. Some of the best jokes in the movie, however, were based on the Camel cigarette commercials that we baby boomers will remember well, but will have to be explained to the kids. Written by Tess

Quality is good. According to the responses on Amazon.com, the quality is the same as their DVD. Evidently the film to DVD transfer wasn't the best. http://www.amazon.com/Hawmps-James-Hampton/dp/B0006Q945A/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1350203601&sr=1-1&keywords=hawmps

However, it is still very viewable. It is the only copy available at the moment. I had to get it off of rapidshare. Enjoy!
