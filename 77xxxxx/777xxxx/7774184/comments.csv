Visual C++ package has been remade [...]

Remapping keys are now available with movement and restart. You access this in the CONTROL section (TITLE MENU)

Game can now run in lower resulutions [sic]. That should now take care of the problem some people had getting stuck while entering stairs or elevators.

Masks perks have been fixed and tweaked.

Game saving grade on the wrong stage have been fixed. However, we are not able to move the grade you already unlocked, so to make sure you have A+ on a stage, replay it and kick its ass one more time to make sure the A+ displayed is the correct A+.

Most reported bugs have been taken care of and should not cause more trouble. If they still persist or you encounter any new ones please report them here on the forum or at support@devolverdigital.com.

Hope this patch works as it should and that you can now enjoy playing the game as it was meant to be played!

Controller WILL work in the next update. Sorry for the delay, we had to make sure everything works as it should and will test it a bit further.

What's cool about it:

Breakneck gunplay in bloodstained neon corridors combined with an intense, pumping soundtrack.
Gut-wrenching battles against a bizarre cast of bosses from Miami�s underground.
Wield 35 different weapons - from shotguns and assault rifles to katanas and lead pipes - everything is at your disposal.

Overview:

Hotline Miami is a high-octane action game overflowing with raw brutality, hard-boiled gunplay and skull crushing close combat. Set in an alternative 1989 Miami, you will assume the role of a mysterious antihero on a murderous rampage against the shady underworld at the behest of voices on your answering machine. Soon you'll find yourself struggling to get a grip of what is going on and why you are prone to these acts of violence.

Rely on your wits to choreograph your way through seemingly impossible situations as you constantly find yourself outnumbered by vicious enemies. The action is unrelenting and every shot is deadly so each move must be quick and decisive if you hope to survive and unveil the sinister forces driving the bloodshed. Hotline Miami�s unmistakable visual style, a driving soundtrack, and a surreal chain of events will have you question your own thirst for blood while pushing you to the limits with a brutally unforgiving challenge.

,makige,2012-10-31T18:28Z,"I still get stuck between levels. I am using dual monitors but even when i tried with just one monitor on the level ""Tension"" i get stuck between the first and second floor once i go to the stairs( I am deffinitely above the 1280x728 res ) If anyone has a 100 percent save game pls upload it since the crash does not occur on all levels, just this one so some of us can just skip the crashing levels. Thank you"
,IndieGamer,2012-10-31T19:47Z,"I finished the game at 100 % with the original release, and didn't have any problem with resolution (1360x768), this update however is controller compatible but I got a bug on this 1st stage, where you have to kill the bum, you hit him and he keeps coming. Jonatan told me it will be fixed in the next update that should be released today."

@13m0n1c4l It might be your printer spooling interfering with the game's initial loading."
,JyL,2012-11-15T10:33Z,"Since nobody's said it: This is the updated version of the game, not a patch, so you're good to go with just this."
