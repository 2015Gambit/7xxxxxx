,analgrin,2012-04-25T21:51Z,"@Grishanoff
It makes me mad when people dont realize magnet links sometimes show as empty for a few minutes until enough seeds have been established :)"
,Grishanoff,2012-04-26T08:44Z,"Analgrin, i've been trying for 3 hour every 5 minutes. Nothing. What's wrong?"
,abdurrehman1990,2012-04-26T09:48Z,is it possible 472 mb??
,ZeroGravityZero,2012-04-26T10:16Z,"It works guys. It's only episode 1 out of 5 , but that's normal because Telltale Games haven't even released them yet. I finished this first episode in 2 hours. It was really good and the game is very fun. There are many choices to be made ( safe a little boy or a man ) or ( choose to save someone and run to save yourself ). I give this a 10 / 10. No jokes :) Thank you so much azac for uploading this!"

,irishpride1960,2012-04-29T13:36Z,"Why is this called ""eng""in my torrents, kinda afraid to run the setup."
,Grishanoff,2012-04-29T17:57Z,"Guys, forgive me. I just did not know that ""empty"" magnet link just needs time to check the hash. If there were some FAQs..."

,Zanime,2012-06-04T00:43Z,The sound doesn't work (OS: W7).
,aremic,2012-06-13T05:38Z,"works good. i am actually surprised at how cool this game is. its like a choose your own adventure book and the story is good. i also like the ""borderlands"" type graphics."
,botyking123,2012-07-17T06:09Z,wow nice torrent thnx the game is fun but it is too small will you get the 2nd episode?

,TroyBoyz,2012-09-02T16:12Z,"Please Help, I seem to be the only one this torrent doesnt work for. It installs and I install everything in  the Redist folder but when i click on walkingdead101.exe nothing happens. The mouse does the loading thing and then nothing. No error messages or anything. Ive tried every other torrent but none of them work for this game. Thx in advance."
