6.13.93 Memphis, Richmond, VA

This DMBLive release is a Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds 1993 performance from the now defunct venue in Richmond, VA called The Memphis. The Memphis was located "up the hill" from the Flood Zone where DMB played many regular gigs in the 90s. This recording captures the intimacy of these early duo shows perfectly. Fans will love the playful banter between Dave and Tim and the audience. Early versions of now bonafide classics provide a different listen and Tim's stunning solo works make this,until now, unheard show a real gem. Dancing Nancies and Song That Jane Likes with Tim playing slide stand out, as well as Tim's Rheginos and the Resurrection.
