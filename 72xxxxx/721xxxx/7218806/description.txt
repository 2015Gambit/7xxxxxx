Ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso
Released 26.04.2012

Fast, secure and stylishly simple, 
the Ubuntu operating system is used by 20 million people worldwide every day.

The Ubuntu team is very pleased to announce the release of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 
(Long-Term Support) for Desktop, Server, Cloud, and Core products.

Codenamed "Precise Pangolin", 12.04 continues Ubuntu's proud tradition 
of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a
high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution.  The team has been hard 
at work through this cycle, introducing a few new features and improving 
quality control.

To be a bit more precise about what we're releasing today...
There are 54 product images and 2 cloud images being shipped with 
this 12.04 LTS release,  with translations available in 41 languages.  
The Ubuntu project's 12.04 archive currently has 39,226 binary packages 
in it, built from 19,179 source packages, so lots of good starting points 
for your imagination!   

For PC users, Ubuntu 12.04 supports laptops, desktops, and netbooks  
with a unified look and feel based on an updated version of the desktop 
shell called "Unity", which introduces "Head-Up Display" search capabilities.  
Finding and installing software using the Ubuntu Software Centre is 
now easier thanks to improvements in speed, search and usability. 

Ubuntu Server 12.04 has made it much easier to provision, deploy, 
host, manage, and orchestrate enterprise data centre infrastructure
services with the introduction of new technologies such as "Metal as
a Service" (MAAS), the Juju Charm Store, and the latest OpenStack version, 
codenamed Essex.  These technologies further position Ubuntu Server 
as the best OS for scale-out computing.
