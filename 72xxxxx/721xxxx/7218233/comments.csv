If I'm not seeding it's for one of two reasons:

1. I have no internets.

2. I'm using the bandwidth for games."

1 - If every one did like you, It will be impossible to download torrents
2 - There are 2 bandwidths : Up and Down 
For your games you use the Down and for the sharing it uses the Up.
So sharing torrents won't disturb your games :)  "
