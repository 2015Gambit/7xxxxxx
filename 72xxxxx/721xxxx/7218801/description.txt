Well, yep, another port but this game is mac native which means its available for the mac via app store, steam, etc.

so if you like the game, SUPPORT THE DEVELOPERS!

Note: I was playing this game for a bit to make sure everything goes well, during scenes, there might be SOME freezeing moments, dont worry, it lasts for about 5-7 seconds.

Please seed if you can!
