[T],nobody2007,2012-04-27T20:27Z,"@Demondays1
You've said at another torrent: >>Come on guys, please seed, I would seed but my download rates are like an average of 60 kb/s so I can hardly seed. (My highest speed to seed it about 1.0 kb/s)"
[T],nobody2007,2012-04-27T20:29Z,"@sebolito

you're an asshole?"
,superrkoman,2012-04-27T21:46Z,"you do know that no one can seed if did not upload the game, right? "
,jonne.zoide,2012-04-28T18:34Z,"You know, I'm the patient type with comments, but you've had more than two days now, and still, not a single byte uploaded by you. What's the point of uploading anything when you simply don't seed it. Nothing at all. Even if your speed is very low, by now you should've been able to upload a little of the file. Seems more and more clear that you only want to mess with people, and never really meant to share this game here."
,hxcpride,2012-04-28T18:59Z,"dont think hes listening or check/online here much, anyone else wanna rip this game?? or suggest other pro's who normally rip mac games??"
,hxcpride,2012-04-28T19:00Z,im also looking for The Darkness 2 & Deus Ex The Ultimate for Mac (native for mac) just released few weeks/days ago!
,ToasterStrudelz,2012-04-29T00:20Z,"Hey, guys. Here is the original wrapper.
http://portingteam.com/files/file/7316-the-walking-dead-episode-1/
Seems Demondays has just installed the game into this wrapper and taken the credit. Good going, bro.

For anyone who's unfamiliar with PortingTeam.com, all wrappers come empty, for legal purposes. Just install any windows version with Wine and place the game files in the proper spot.

I hope this has helped some people."
,AnxiouslyCalm93,2012-04-29T00:32Z,DOWNLOADING NOW AND SEEDING! EVEN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT GAME THIS IS :D
,ToasterStrudelz,2012-04-29T00:59Z,"Since supposedly, Demondays1 isn't seeding his own file, I decided to help everyone out by uploading my own.

,Demondays1,2012-04-30T02:48Z,"Toaster, screw you, I didnt take his wrapper and took the credit from him, I ported this game on my own. I was planning to upload it to portingteam but there was a mac native version. Whoever you are toaster, screw you for accusing me I took credit from dan."
