,QuePensa,2012-04-24T13:49Z,"What a wonderful torrent! I never watched this series but always want to, but did not find it in good quality and complete..... until now....  good job Pyro!!!! and ThanX!"
,PyroTheGreat,2012-04-24T14:04Z,"Yeah, I thought the same when I discovered it on a private tracker. Got only a few seeds, so I thought I might revive it here. 
I'm sorry that I can't afford a seedbox right now...would be much faster that way for everybody. "
,PyroTheGreat,2012-04-24T15:08Z,"Encoders notes...

This is our largest and most comprehensive release to date. Yes, there are a couple of other BSG packs around. Why did I decide to do this one? As good as the other packs were, I found they were either overkill on filesize and bitrate or not good enough quality for such a special series. Also, native compatibility with PS3 and Xbox 360 is provided from us. So, with this pack, you will get 3000 video bitrate for all HD video files. Each HD video file also has 640 kbs audio (or highest possible from its source) with 5.1 sound. "

,aaron_auto,2012-04-29T11:47Z,in two weeks when i have finished this dl i will seed the crap out of it!! haha any comments on quality?
,PyroTheGreat,2012-04-29T12:14Z,"Thanks. Hope you keep your word ;) 
There are some samples...you should download them first before starting the whole thing, although I daresay you woudn't regret it. Quality is great! 

But download the 280GB version by all means...if you want to wait 2 months..."
,djr2012,2012-05-12T03:43Z,Awesome quality! But need to help seeding this!
,Donkey79,2012-05-18T07:30Z,Thanks man!  I can't wait to start watching this stuff...  I will be sure to seed as well.  
,PyroTheGreat,2012-05-26T13:36Z,"Thanks everybody for your seeding efforts. 

People with slow connection could also help by super-seeding, which is good at spreading rare pieces. ;)"
,applerun,2012-07-10T20:35Z,Is anyone else getting errors with files in season 3?
,PyroTheGreat,2012-07-28T03:10Z,"I've watched everything once before uploading and it all run perfectly, so there should be no errors. 
Maybe a file got corrupted on your drive...a forced recheck might fix it. "
,rumpel,2012-08-06T21:47Z,ThanQ!
,cylon7,2012-08-18T07:40Z,"Razor (Extended) and The Plan are missing, as are the webisodes. The sample for Razor is there, but the actual file is not."
