,Nazziege,2012-05-25T13:38Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS!! this dick R1nger thinks he is funny if he uploads a bs video and names it to be something it is not. Karma is a bitch dude, watch out."
,butthurts,2012-06-04T17:17Z,"I understand that you made the movie and all, but you gotta also understand that you have international fans, I am unlucky enough to live in an stupid third world country where I cant even get a credit card or dollars so how am I supposed to buy the fucking thing, you should aim for international exposure aswell, if you promise me you can send over here, hell Ill buy a 100 and even sub it and sell it in this part of the world, but floor painting, is not funny at all.
