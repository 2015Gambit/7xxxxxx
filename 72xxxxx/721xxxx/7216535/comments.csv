,breizh_adc_hanet,2012-04-29T15:43Z,"Thank man, nice one! wanted to buy it but they won't have it in brasil"
,ween01,2012-04-30T19:38Z,Something is wrong with tracks 7 and 8. It sounds like the songs have really been slowed down and the track times are longer than the official album states!!! Use another
,Gimiesome,2012-05-08T19:38Z,Thanks Stumpie.... Excellent
,BakedUp,2012-06-10T11:34Z,"awesome quality!

,JustAnotherApprentice,2012-07-09T06:53Z,"It's not true! Of course the album will be released in Brazil as it's going to in other countries.It is this kind of comment that makes people still have the idea that Brazil is nothing but a huge jungle.If you want to download it,do it,but do not lie to justify your actions."
,JustAnotherApprentice,2012-07-09T06:56Z,"35,90 at Brazilian Fnac."
,raturbano,2012-07-31T16:55Z,"I'm brazilian, and I agree with JustAnotherApprentice.

29,90 at Saraiva/Siciliano. At least if you'd searched before start talking lies to justify your download..."
,wbholder,2012-08-02T23:14Z,"ween01 is right. The tracks after #7 are messed up. Do not download. Try this one: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7230282/Norah_Jones-Little_Broken_Hearts_(2012)_320Kbit(mp3)_DMT

I was looking to buy the album off Amazon MP3 but they won't let me buy outside the US. I will be going to her concert, though. Love Norah Jones."
