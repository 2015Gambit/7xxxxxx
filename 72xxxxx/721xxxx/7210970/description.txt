Notes:

With a left hand like God these pianists lay downn some of the most rocking boogie woogie bass lines that you'll ever hear. Forget 'Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy' by the Andrew Sisters - this is the real stuff. 

If you like any of the genres or artists in the tags then this collection is for you.
