,druhklam_orbowetsch,2012-04-25T04:25Z,"Amazing game and works perfectly, however since it's episode by episode, each episode alone is too small so you'll want more which means waiting! I really wish they had released all the episodes together in a single game. "
,bobw0609,2012-04-25T04:47Z,how do i get it to work?
,CaptainSwagglez,2012-04-25T05:39Z,Where is the crack?

,bluebird9k1,2012-04-25T17:14Z,"game's not bad. a lot of story, not much action. you have to make choices and stuff."
,cheezumz002,2012-04-25T17:32Z,"it says ""d3dx9_41.dll is missing from your computer"" any help?"
,Tokizo,2012-04-25T18:11Z,"Install this, http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35"
,arun279,2012-04-25T18:32Z,"just 458 mb? this is the first episodic game I am downloading, is that right? installation process any different or just regular?"
,ag_orange,2012-04-25T18:38Z,"@cheezumz002

Download and install DirectX Version 9.0 or above...."
,Sivos,2012-04-25T19:04Z,"Pretty fun game.  It's kind of glitchy (jerking clips and the occasional temporary freeze) but nothing that effects the game to where you will fail.  The glitches seem like the video will freeze and the sound will continue, but then the video will start up again and catch up to the sound (if that makes any sense).  All in all, don't think this is like Left 4 Dead or Dead Island, it's a director game which means it's a movie/show and you decide what happens and what the main character will say.  If you've played the newest Jurassic Park game, you'll understand what I mean.  Also, there are no saves so when you make a decision or say a certain thing, you have to stick with it the entire time.  I don't know what would happen if you exited the game, my advice is to play the full episode all at once in case you might have to start over.  I can't wait for the next episode! :D"
,Diogoferreira1,2012-04-25T19:19Z,anyone know when the episode 2 is going out? :D
,thiagoadecastro,2012-04-25T22:46Z,"Nice game, good job! "

,alkona,2012-04-26T02:04Z,it wont stop trying to connect any help?..
,Moonshaft,2012-04-26T02:23Z,"@alkona

If the game is stuck at ""Connecting"" forever, make an Outbound exception to it in Windows Firewall to block it from the internet and that should fix the problem."
,Empty888,2012-04-26T02:28Z,"Got the same problem alkona, easy to fix after the usual ""oh noes D:"".

1- Do as the readme says
2- Add the shortcut or whatever you use to launch the game to your firewall
3- Block access
4- Launch
5- Play

Hope it helps. Works for me."

,blaze7755,2012-04-28T12:56Z,Will saves from this game carry forward to next episodes? Or do you need a legit copy to do that?
,SomeRandomBloke,2012-04-28T15:23Z,"I'm really sorry, I don't mean to troll, but the game doesn't work for me. I run Win7 32, at first I got the false positive virus, excluded it from the watchlist, loaded it again and although it starts it stutters a lot to an unplayable level. But it's ok, I got a taste and I'm probably gonna buy it, it's 5 euros per episode anyway. Thanks for the effort though!"
,kikosalaz,2012-04-28T16:13Z,Will we be able to transfer our savegames to the next episode?
,Anon96,2012-04-29T01:24Z,"I assume you will be able to, since I believe the episodes work sort of as updates to the original game. Once an episode is cracked, I assume we just copy the cracked data over to the original walking dead game."
,Unknown16,2012-04-29T05:12Z,Fuck me. This game is amazing. Wasn't expecting much off of it but it's brought a whole new perspective to the Series for me. Shall be watching the TV Series and reading the Comics soon. Thanks a lot OP!
,agid877,2012-04-29T06:42Z,"So I installed the game and replaced the existing .exe file with the cracked one, but it's still not working. When I go to play the game it asks for my username and password to telltalegames.com, in order to prove that I have a legit copy. 

Anyone else having this problem, and how do I fix it? "
,DasDaemon,2012-04-29T07:54Z,Something about Tell Tale Games pops up saying log in to activate.
,DasDaemon,2012-04-29T08:00Z,"Nevermind, I realised I didn't copy over everything.
Great job HeroMaster."

,irishpride1960,2012-04-29T14:58Z,"@Blaze, you need a programme like demon Tools lite, install it and use it to mount the game on a drive, then you can install it (the game) to your PC."
,blaze7755,2012-04-29T17:59Z,"@irishpride. Ok, but which image should I mount? The BIN file? Or do I need to create a .cue file?"

,Losers_Finish_Last,2012-05-01T01:13Z,"how to install
1. mount or unrar your choice same thing really 
2. once unrared or mounted (if mounted go to the mounted drive) and run the setup it will have a R symbol on it 
3. once installed go to crack folder in the game folder or the game folder in mounted drive which ever one you chose  and open the crack folder
4. crack folder looks like this
steam_api.dll
steam_rld
walking dead101 copy all of that!
5. then paste all the cracked contents you just copied to your walking dead folder which usually is C DRIVE PROGRAM FILES THE WALKING DEAD
6. open the walking dead folder in your hard drive and paste all the cracked content over the files in that folder!
7. play! its a lot fucking simpler that it sounds man. peace :)"

,plooxx,2012-05-29T04:12Z,"Hey guys 

I can't change the graphic settings. I click on the graphics icon and all the different graphics settings appear but i can't seem to change any? The game doesnt freeze or anything it just doesnt react when i click. And when i try to leave settings and go back to main menu, that wont work neither and i have to shut down the game.

Is anyone having the same problem or knows how to fix it? Thanks in advance."
,GeekIntel,2012-05-30T12:22Z,"This question might have been asked a million times in the comments, but when is episode 2 out? I heard sometime at the end of May - start of June. "
,nautzz,2012-05-30T22:45Z,"@GeekIntel Episode 2 is already out, just not cracked yet."
,Boxxist_Acolyte,2012-05-31T08:46Z,"It is saying ""The program can't start because d3dx9_41.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."" 

I tried reinstalling but nothing changed, and yes i did copy the contents of the crack folder and replace the old ones. 

Please help!"
,Boxxist_Acolyte,2012-05-31T08:48Z,"About that last commend, i wrote it before reading the other comments and i now see that other people have had this problem, so i'm going to try the solutions already mentioned. 

I will report back if it still doesn't work."
,spoofycat,2012-05-31T17:41Z,"Thats an hour of my life wasted.....(most of that hour was spent lamenting over the lack of freedom and options) 
Works well enough, big ups to the uploader for throwin it together, many thanks! Ok story but its one i think everyones heard since the dam 90's. This game is an awful repetitive lump of shite. Designed for fatass bastards who need a hand free to force food down their throats and make as little input as possible while jerking off...(where is the option to rape a corpse? or put a bullet between your companions eyes and survive alone?) All in all a childs tea cup has more depth.
A half blind, crack smoking, bong sucking, quadriplegic ferrit riddled with parkinsons would have no problems finishing this game in under an hour. This game was made for zombies by zombies. Not people."
,boostrom,2012-05-31T17:43Z,"Quick question, how do you continue episode 2 with the choices you made in this episode? I mean if they're different discs.."
,spoofycat,2012-05-31T19:00Z,"@boostrom
 I would guess it saves your progress on ur pc and just loads on the new episodes? im fishing tho..."

,EmilzTPB,2012-06-26T18:05Z,Game works just fine. There are some rare lag issues but you will get them with original version too. Its really worth to support developers and buy this because there will be 4 episodes more
