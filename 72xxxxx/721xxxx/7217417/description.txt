Introduction:
=============


Astrology is a science, not a fiction. And since, it is based on facts and lengthy calculations, application of computers can surely improvise this ancient treasure of Indian culture.
Astrology is based on the fact that when the environment can effect our feelings, the moon can effect so far placed non-living (according to science) sea then much bigger planets like Sun, Venus etc. do effect the human behavior and it is left to us to predict what changes will they bring to our lives.

The improvisation in calculations leads to perfection in the predictions regarding past, present and future of any object in the whole universe. There are various methodologies, beliefs about the prediction systems but the system of calculations remains the same except for some basis like Sayana system and Nirayana system of planetary positions, differences in Ayanamsa  calculation etc. To accommodate these we have included the option of common Ayanamsa Calculation methods and both Sayana and Niryana longitudes. Since average human beings are more prone to the errors than the modern computers and calculators. ThatΓÇÖs why we have combined the power of machines and the sciences of Ancient astrological sciences to produce a much accurate system of horoscope casting. However, for the prediction part the beliefs and systems followed vary a lot. Western astrology is based on Sun while Indian astrology is based on Moon reason being that the change in position of Moon in relation to earth is very fast and changes in our life are also very fast. Based on this Indian method, we have included a general prediction system along with the Varshphal for predictions in respect to time.
