Many hail Emmylou Harris' 1990 album 'Brand New Dance', her worst album. I think it is an unfair comparison. To compare this album against albums like 'Red Dirt Girl', 'Wrecking Ball' or 'Roses in the Snow', is simply unfair. This album has its own flow and beauty, and its own appeal. It opens with the single 'Wheels of Love', and is followed by Bruce Springsteen's 'Tougher Than The Rest'. 'In His World' is a beautiful, almost magical song. The title track is an album highlight, as is the album closer 'Red, Red Rose'. True, it is not her strongest effort, but there are some true gems to be found if you listen to this album. Other highlights include 'Better Off Without You', 'Never Be Anyone Else But You' and 'Easy For You To Say'. Don't believe all the negativity, don't believe what you read, listen and form your own opinions about Brand New Dance, you might be surprised.
