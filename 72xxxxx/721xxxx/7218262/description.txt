
Known more for their exotic hypercars, Lamborghini isn't totally unknown when it comes to SUV's thanks to the awesome LM002. With the Urus then, Lamborghini is all set to hit "Bulls-eye" again!



Utter the word ΓÇ£LamborghiniΓÇ¥ and one can immediately picture chariots fit for the gods. Cars like the Miura, Countach Diablo (and the list goes on) are pretty much the poster on every car enthusiast walls. But for those who didnΓÇÖt know, Lamborghini also made one SUV, in fact let me correct that, one ΓÇ£specialΓÇ¥ SUV called the LM002. 


When it was unveiled in 1985, the LM002 was an absolutely revolutionary vehicle. An automobile suitable for off-road driving with a twelve-cylinder engine and 450 horses (rather bulls in this context), a top speed of more than 210 km/h, a luxurious interior and, above all, an absolutely stunning appearance ΓÇô it was utterly unthinkable at the time. Only 300 units were built making the LM002 not only an exotic but also a very exclusive piece of machinery.
