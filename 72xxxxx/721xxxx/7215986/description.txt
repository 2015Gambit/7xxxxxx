Heller is woke up by a man name called Saul Benjamin who introduces himself as a photographer. Heller enquires where there were being held, however, Saul informed that the last thing he could remember was falling asleep while accompanying a light armored unit while Heller claimed that he was on patrol. Saul tried to detail the soldiers he had seen in the bunker and how the last two prisoners were tortured.

Soon, Saul was taken away by a few soldiers, while Heller was left alone. After sometime, the gates to his prison were opened and Heller moved out cautiously. He dismantled the lever to use it as a weapon, as he came across a few infected Walkers dressed in lab coats. Heller found a weapons cache and continued to find a way out of the bunker. On his way he came across two soldiers who were terribly injured.
