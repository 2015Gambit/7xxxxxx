Akerstache, in collaboration with legendary newcomer Stephen Wilton, has once again revolutionized the cock rock genre (something he last did with his brilliant release 'Songs In The Key Of Cock (Unplugged & Uncocked)', which simultaneously revolutionized acoustic music and induced Kroegasms all over the globe). Believe it, bros."
