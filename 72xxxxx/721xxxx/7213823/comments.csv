(his words not ine) but despite and perhaps *because* of that, thanks for this interesting upload, and thanks for adding me to your enemies list! Anyone who writes an info  file  like yours is someone I definitely don't want to be liked by. Knowing you hate me gives me a warm feeling inside. It tells me  I'm on the right side of the universe. It also tells me how insecure and foolish you are. I expect more insults in your next torrent. Common I'm counting on you to live down to my expectations o I can continue to feel superior.

oh, and, x.264 rocks. Not to mention playing on all the best portable devices without having to be re-encoded, which I have to do to all your great uploads."
