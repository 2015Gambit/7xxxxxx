,strathmeyer,2012-04-27T03:22Z,"warning, RARs"
,nardar2,2012-04-27T03:42Z,"if rar is something that takes too much time to unpack in 2012, then you should get the fuck off the internet and don't come back till you got a computer that's not from the 90s."
[V],spastik64,2012-04-27T03:58Z,Check out our NO .rar uploads.
,Arkngt,2012-04-27T07:20Z,plus you don't even have to unpack it if using VLC.
[V],azizex666,2012-04-27T07:24Z,Thanks for the upload scene!
,afghanwhig02,2012-04-27T15:11Z,"Thanks Sceneline, probabably one of the most reliable uploaders on TPB."
,AnimalLeopard,2012-04-27T17:57Z,"Thank you! Oh no, Rar's! I'm gonna waste 1mn of my time... ;)"
,DJ_JB,2012-04-28T00:26Z,"Any words on the quality? I used to keep up with the ctrlHD Web DL editions, they seem to have 720p H264 DD5.1. No tv recording, no logos, etc.

Is this release just as good, or should I just wait for ctrlHD to come alive again?"
,Tadrio,2012-05-02T00:24Z,"WEB-DL is usually better quality - clean source and often encoded to higher bitrates. If quality is important to you, e.g. to keep the episodes, wait for the WEB-DL, but if you just want to watch the show it's not worth it, the HDTV 720p rips are in good quality as well. This one's CRF 18, that's pretty good.

@AnimalLeopard & nardar2: As Arkngt says, no need to waste even a second of time if using VLC or MPlayer. Both play RARs directly :)"
,alfaplast,2012-05-03T19:03Z,"Great as usual, thanks sceneline / DiMENSiON"
,Slarti42,2012-05-03T19:37Z,"I don't really mind having RAR's if you don't mind me not seeding.  I normally seed everything I download, but I don't like double the space on my hard drive being taken up because I have one copy of the unzipped file and one copy of the rar.  So I delete the RAR, but after that I'm not seeding anymore.  That is my issue with Rars.  It's not so much a problem for me as it is a problem for you because you're losing seeders."
,greenwheel,2012-05-04T14:48Z,Rars suck... that's all there is to it. They're fine for ftp transfers in case part of your download is corrupted then you can just re-download the part that you need. But this is not necessary with torrents.
