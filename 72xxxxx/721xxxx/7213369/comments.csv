,goldinguy,2012-04-25T03:16Z,"I downloaded, scanned (it came up clean) but as stated above, it comes up with an installer in a different language. I tried to navigate it to my Fifa12 folder and install it in the ""game"" folder and it accepted it but after the install Fifa12 no longer launches so I guess that was wrong. I'll have to uninstall and reinstall Fifa12 and then keep trying different folders unless someone else has figured it out already..."
