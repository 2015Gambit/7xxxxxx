Henrik B is a man of many talents, who now at the peak of his game continually delivers the goods both on & off the dancefloor through his trademark epic productions. He originally made a name for himself in the techno community, releasing tracks on key labels such as Drumcode, Primate & Corb. With the continually blurring lines between House & Techno, it wasnΓÇÖt too long before HenrikΓÇÖs productions crossed
genres and he began to work closely with the likes of Angello, Prydz and the other key players.
