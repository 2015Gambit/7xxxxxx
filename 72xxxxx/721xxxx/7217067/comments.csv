,gbh102,2012-05-23T01:21Z,"Quality ( what shouldn't be surprise, as we got deal with serious mark - KINGDOM ;) ) is simply AWESOME, especially considering its size, picture stays clear and sharp like a razor even in fast, dark scenes, such a big downpour, 3 D is AWESOME too, noticeable in almost each second of the movie really intensive,theres A LOT pop outs ( yeah, we love it ;)  ). One of the best 3 D I've seen so far
Great, really great job.

Will reccomend to anyone who was thinking if grab or not... Answer is: Yes, as this release is ( IMO oc ;) ) spectacular!!!
