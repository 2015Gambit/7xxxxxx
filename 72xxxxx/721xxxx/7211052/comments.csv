For the fact that everything and anything has an impact on climate such as, oceans, seas, volcanoes, flora, fauna, land fill, clearing and planting, waste, gassy animals, man's breath, radiation, reflection, absorption, solar, evaporation, conduction, physics, humidity, earthâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s rotation, sun, moon, stars, tectonic plates, tsunamiâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s, earthquakes, air movement, ice, snow, rainfall, water vapor, droughts, clouds, cars, trains, jets, boats, construction, agriculture, and on it goes. To think we (man) have all the answers, know how everything works, let alone be able to control the ""climate"" like a thermostat it is very misguided or possibly just plain arrogant."
