Scotland: The Edge Of The Land: Series One 
A spectacular aerial journey up Scotland`s Western coastline. The edge of the land is where geography becomes history; much of what defines the Scots happened where the Atlantic`s long fingers reach into the heart of Scotland. From the air we see where man has patterned the landscape; the great city of Glasgow, the fisher towns of the west. We see the marks made by a thousand generations; the stones at Callanish, the brochs of Glenelg. The wild margins of Scotland have been shaped by the raw power of the ocean; the cliffs at Cape Wrath, the jagged ridge of the Cuillin. We see sea eagles in flight, bottle-nosed dolphins at play. We see Scotland from a unique compass perspective, until now unavailable to earthbound Scots.
