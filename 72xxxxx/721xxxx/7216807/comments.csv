[T],smokkedog,2012-04-26T11:51Z,Yes it does.
,dannwid,2012-04-26T11:55Z,"okay... you rocks, thanks"
[T],smokkedog,2012-04-26T12:01Z,"BTW I now this was a spoiler for some of you guys.

But the reason I split the files is that it is quicker to upload. I just get the 1st half out there as fast as I can and while you guys are downloading that, I prepare the 2nd half and so on.

The other reason is I have limited bandwidth, so smaller files means faster downloads and more seeders quicker. 

Anyways, if you guys don't like the way I do it let me know and I will wait until everything is ready. Of course this could mean an extra hour or two."
,dannwid,2012-04-26T12:22Z,"for me, it doesnt matter... :p"
,Oromia,2012-04-26T15:50Z,thank you! 
,muhu88,2012-04-27T05:28Z,"2nd half & extra time should be uploaded as 1 file and there should be no spoiler in title like this 1 has. 
Anyway u r doing a great job.

Thanks "
