Thanks for the share."
,gw2share,2012-04-25T22:15Z,"Thank you Fougene, I forgot write that to description.

Yes, you will need a valid GW2 account and an alive beta event to play.

These files are 100% original and valid for sure. Just providing them if people have download problems with GW2's own downloader."
,Superjazzer,2012-04-26T15:56Z,"GUYS YOU NEED TO PRE-PURCHASE GW2 BEFORE DOWNLOADING THIS....OR IT WONT WORK!!!

also MORE SEEDERS PLEASE!!!"
,Superjazzer,2012-04-26T16:01Z,"More seeders please!!

cant download the GW2 client due to problems so need to use this, thanks for thinking of this GW2share :D"
,gw2share,2012-04-26T19:23Z,"You will need to have a valid GW2 account to play, which you may get:
- By Pre-purchasing GW2
- By being a lucky bastard, and getting a beta invitation

And people... SEED! I will keep my seed up until the final finished game get released.

Game is also portable, because I tested it with many computers just copy&pasting game files and executing Gw2.exe."
,CookiezEater,2012-04-27T04:12Z,You can also buy beta key on russian sites almost for free - 2$
,Fougene,2012-04-27T07:55Z,"why would you buy a beta key? either you already know you want the game - or you don't and wait for the open beta that will almost definitely come before launch.

If you are not sure if you want the game, it is probably not good to try it at an incomplete stage >.< and spending money for it."
,Pimpmylurker,2012-04-27T17:33Z,C'mon guys... let's seed that stuff !
,n1kos_gr,2012-05-07T14:04Z,CAN SOMEONE BYPASS THE LOGIN SO I CAN JUST CREATE A CHAR?
