,raymond_u,2012-04-26T09:04Z,Cheers ripnsilk. Thanks. If you missed any of the previous editions I think user Spetses has you covered though. But I can still guarantee I can upload mine before he does :P
,boozy80999,2012-04-26T11:44Z,"Great to see you back. Even though Spetses has been doing great job, it would be awsome to get the previous three issues in this fabolous quality from you. Could you upload them?"
,raymond_u,2012-04-26T12:26Z,I think Spetses uploads in the same quality - though admittedly I don't really know (I've never downloaded off him. Will upload.
,thorhammer2000,2012-04-26T12:57Z,"raymond_u: where have you been? Great to have you back - can I echo boozy80999 and request that you upload issues 14, 15 & 16 in your lovely quality PDFs? Spetses does a great job, but you seem to be the only one posting the true PDFs!"
,EnzoFerrari1,2012-04-26T12:59Z,Cheers. :)
,raymond_u,2012-04-26T13:09Z,"@Enzo - you're welcome :)

@thorhammer2000 - Done and done ;) I don't know to be honest... I got... lazy. :P"
[T],Spetses,2012-04-26T18:38Z,"Welcome back sir,only problem you called me a him, I`m a her"
,raymond_u,2012-04-26T19:18Z,@Spetses - oops. It happens I guess - especially when I know nothing of you except for a pseudonym :P My apologies.
,F110,2012-04-26T20:41Z,Many thanks to you both for your excellent work. It's always appreciated.
,ripnsilk,2012-04-27T01:28Z,"Yes I have called on Spetses ups to fill in the gaps, and her ups are numerous and appreciated.
 One thing i know for sure is that your version presents itself as single page/continuous, whereas with Spetses I've had to go hunting for the format button (times is haaard!).
 Anyway you took up the mantle when Thorhammer stopped upping, and I'm happy to support the incumbent! (that'd be you in the autosport realm)."
