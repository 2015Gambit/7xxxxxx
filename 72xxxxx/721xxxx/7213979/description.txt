   The film takes on a journey through the   
   love story of Ram (Dhanush) and Janani    
   (Shruthi) who are 12th standard students  
   and eventually falls in love with each    
   other. As they grow up, so does their     
   affinity for each other, and despite      
   opposition from the elders, they tie the  
   knot. When they start a fresh life,       
   problems start to grow up. Apart from the 
   usual misunderstanding difficulties that  
   newly-married couples would face, this    
   is of a different kind. Ram is forced to  
   take a decision in that problematic       
   situation. What follows is an emotional   
   tale.
