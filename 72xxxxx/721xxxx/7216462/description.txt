Post by Nicky Ramone at NRK's official blog on 2008-10-06:

"Diggin' The Vaults: Jon Marsh - nite:life 01

NRK's nite:life mix CD series started in 2000, and we
selected Jon Marsh to kick-start the series, which ran up
to 2004, and featured 20 mix compilations from some of the
world's most popular deep house, techno and progressive
DJs.

Long since deleted, we bring you Jon's mix in full to
download. Featuring cuts from Nick Holder, DJ Spen, Aaron-
Carl, David Alvarado, Dano and Halo Varga, nite:life 01
captures the Beloved main man in dance-floor mode, twisting
and snaking the deep rhythms with vocals, deep keys and
tribal undertones."

Downloaded from the label's web site via its official blog.
Cue sheet put together with info retrieved from web stores
and whatnot.

There are several minor clicks in the album and some
foreground noise at 23:05. Since we didn't reencode
anything, I'd say it was probably the ripper's fault.
