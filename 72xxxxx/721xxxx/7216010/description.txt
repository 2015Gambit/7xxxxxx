Here's a fantastic starter pack for those of you interested in audio production on Windows machines.  This pack includes:


****Ableton Suite 8.1.1
-Excellent Digital Audio Workstation, light enough to run on a netbook
-Includes ALL LIVE PACKS
-Run "Setup.exe", then replace the "Live 8.1.1.exe" in "C:Program FilesAbletonLive 8.1.1Program" with the "Live 8.1.1.exe" contained in the torrent, then open the "Authorization.auz" file and you're good to go

****iZotope Trash
-Great distortion FX, hailed by Skrillex as one of his 2 favorite distortion FX.

****Ohmicide
-Another great distortion, the other of Skrillex's 2 favorite distortion plug-ins.

****Max for Live
-Advanced plug-in for Live that allows the user to program their own instruments and effects.

****Rob Papen ConcreteFX Blue
-Excellent VSTi effects.

****Rob Papen Predator VSTi
-Synthesizer allowing easy creation of "dirty" sounding patches for electro/dubstep.

****Native Instruments Massive
-Probably the most widely used synthesizer in modern electronic music, my personal favorite for the wide array of sounds you can make with this.

****Native Instruments FM8
-FM based synthesizer, easy to use, Skrillex employs this synthesizer for many of his more melodic synths.

****Sylenth1
-Another great synth, very versatile with a nice GUI.
-Perfect for REESE/Hoover style synths.


I will edit this later to include instructions on how to use all of these, currently in a rush.
