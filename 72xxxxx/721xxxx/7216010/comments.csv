,Hielonegro,2012-04-25T23:57Z,"No seeders, 10hr x 1%,  no worth it!."
,traxitron,2012-04-26T04:13Z,"Sorry guys!  I probably should have waited to upload this until I was home, I finished packing this up this morning and I was bouncing around the area today using what internet I could.  I will probably have one more bit of internet outage for like 30 minutes later, but after that I'll be seeding straight for at least a few days"
,cocoathunder,2012-04-30T03:01Z,having problems with concrete fx blue and predator not showing up in my ableton vstplugins folder if someone could get back to me id appreciate it. thx 
,UX7331,2012-05-01T00:29Z,"Just a warning, some of your filenames used in the torrent can cause issues from their length, I got many errors trying to extract the pack on Windows 7 due to the path or actual Filename length."
,UX7331,2012-05-01T00:38Z,"Also, if you're looking for a newer version of ableton (There's quite a few things on the internet that wants 8.2+ now): There's a version by theLEAK here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6511769/Ableton_Live_8.2.2_%28CRACKED%29_%5BtheLEAK%5D"
,traxitron,2012-05-02T09:38Z,"The reason you are having problems extracting is because of the software you are using to extract it, you should probably get a better archive manager like 7-zip or PeaZip.  If you still have problems at that point then it's settings on your system, I've already downloaded, extracted, and installed to a few friends computers with absolutely no problems."
,traxitron,2012-05-02T09:46Z,"@cocoathunder
The reason you are having trouble getting them to show up in your vstplugins folder is because you probably chose to install them in a non-default folder, which happens often as the installers don't necessarily use the default folder for windows vst plugins.  
1. Open up the preferences in Ableton
2. Toward the bottom you'll see a ""Use Custom Folder"" option under the VST section of the preferences.  
3. Turn on the ""Use Custom Folder"" option, and set your custom folder as ""C:Program Files""

This will take a bit to scan initially and will cause it to take a bit longer when rescanning your vst's in the future, but it will ensure that it checks all installed programs for tricky VST locations."

Unless you are talking about a plug-in developed specifically for Ableton 8.2+, you cant find anything on the internet that REQUIRES 8.2+.

The only things that would require a certain version of Ableton would be Live Packs, and those are included with ableton Suite anyway.  VST (and rtas/dxi) plugins are built to be universally accessible because they use Virtual Studio Technology, and thus they don't have any host requirements other than the ability to implement a VST.

So...You're full of shit."
,UX7331,2012-05-02T16:27Z,"@Traxitron, yeah I was referring to live packs that I've seen require 8.2 before.
Also I've tested and installed everything from the producer pack finally, 100% clean (it happily ran in sandboxie since I was skeptical at first) and everything works great. Thanks :)"
,Minimee99,2012-06-01T20:06Z,"Very good! For some reason It worked perfectly for about a week and a half... But now I can't launch live. When I try I get ""a serious error has occurred . live will shut down after this message box is closed."" I Don't think this is a problem with the torrent but can someone point me in the right direction."
,Scarc100,2012-07-23T22:16Z,Thanks for the upload trax. having trouble with the authorization though. help?
,astackofpapers,2012-07-30T23:18Z,I can't get past the authorization part which means I can't save anything I make rendering this useless aha any help at all or is this another unistall?
,astackofpapers,2012-07-30T23:23Z,"nevermind, you have to open the auz file with ableton, it's default is on notepad"
