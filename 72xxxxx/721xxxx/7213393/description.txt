BitScramble - FREEWARE 2012 (ver. 1.0)

BitScramble is a file encryption software for Windows. Encrypted files will appear corrupt or damaged to Windows
but they are actually encrypted by BitScramble. Please DO NOT LOOSE your password after encryption.
BitScramble will not store your password to anywhere nor does not leave any trace of itself in the system.

.NET 3.0 required or higher.
No installation needed, just run the application, drag & drop file or browse file for encryption.
The longer password you give, the more secure the encryption will be.
