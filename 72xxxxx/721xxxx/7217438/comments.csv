,B3lanuj,2012-04-27T17:15Z,"i just dont understand why people always looking for subtitles..the movie is spoken in English and not Chinese,so subtitles is not actually a big deal here!!!!!"
,rinku84,2012-04-27T18:43Z,"@B3lanuj I hope u know that English is not the first language in most of the countries, u r an idiot if u dont know this, and an ass if u know this and still said ""u dont understand why people always looking for subtitles""."

,B3lanuj,2012-04-28T01:37Z,"@rinku84 -what i really wanna point it out here is that if they dont understand English,they should not be looking for English subtitles in Yify's, but search Google for the subtitles in their own language instead.."
,AnxiouslyCalm93,2012-04-28T03:49Z,Whys yours 601MiB And the other ones are over 4gb??? please answer this for me
,Adam_OSFP,2012-04-28T23:29Z,"@B3lanuj

Did it ever appear to you that some people might be hearing impaired? Or maybe some non native speakers are trying to learn/improve their English? 

Of course you didn't think of that, you little ignorant.  "

[T],immagical,2012-05-06T17:11Z,"@drexel75,   well said..    can you translate that though pleez...   lol :D"
,permaponics,2012-05-06T20:30Z,"so was it a good movie or not... Fuck Subtitles! unless your deaf. if you don't speak English, watch the shitty movies of your own country."
,eXclusivestocK,2012-05-07T08:54Z,"@permaponics
Harsh.

Though it does piss me off to still see those dumb comments asking about subtitles in a time where everyone knows about piratebay and how to pirate a movie.

Yify Great download."
,topk,2012-05-10T18:17Z,"Good rip
Shit movie"
,vampzcore,2012-06-25T09:49Z,thanks yify! and seeders!!
,IMHitler,2012-09-01T04:48Z,"Hi 
There is no srt file in the torrent .. i have noticed the same issue with few other yify torrents..

any idea why??"
,kaiserin.marss,2012-09-07T08:14Z,"It is good to have subtitles somehow since some characters in the movie speak english too fast. I also want to point out with what word is they are really saying for words can be mistakenly heard as another word. For people who don't want the subtitle just skip the SRT file. Learn to appreciate the file.

By the way, thanks YIFY for the hundred movies I got from you. Your movies are really great please keep up that great ripping work of yours. :)"
