They tower over some of the most tranquil countryside in rural China.  They're giant, man-made mountains that hold the keys to a violent history scarcely imaginable in such peaceful surroundings. These are the ancient pyramids of a bygone era characterised by battles and bloodshed, as warring kingdoms wrangled with each other in a power struggle spanning generations.


Today, these huge structures present historians with some of the world's most fascinating and well-preserved examples of ancient tombs. Deep within the pyramids lie the mummies of early China's most important generals, emperors, lords and ladies.People for whom size definitely mattered, with the scale of their final resting place mirroring the magnitude of their status.
