,muckymucks,2012-04-24T06:14Z,C_P uploads are shit! The frame is cut off and the quality is ass. Don't download C_P videos. Support ettv and eztv! They do it right.
,khabbs2335,2012-04-24T06:25Z,"CP....its good stuff ...show is the best show by far since the Justice League ...thanks again love your stuff , anything I can do to help you put out more I will "
,Osmosian,2012-04-27T18:26Z,"As stated above, C_P uploads got shit quality. ETTV got far, FAR better quality than this junk."
,BDA420,2012-04-28T21:55Z,"Agreed that C_P uploads are always low quality, misframed and in SD format instead of 16X9 or the typical HD.

It's 2012. Everything is 16X9 now. Not your cruddy 4x3 offerings or the versions where the top or bottom is cut off for whatever reason.

That being said I will say that at least C_P is trying to do his thing. As a comic fan one has to respect his attempt to provide people with a great comic TV show.

If I had the technical knowhow I would offer some advice on how to fix the encoding problems which so obviously plague, but I have nothing to offer as I can't even figure out how to backup any of the DVD's and Blu-Rays I own into avi or mp4 format.

Hope you can get your encoding issues worked out so you can finally get the +1 in rep you deserve for giving us shows like Green Lantern and Young Justice."
,megate,2012-05-01T00:16Z,"this is megate the one who does encoding for #cartoon_palace you can find me on the irc channel our group is in desperate need of encoders as we lost them a while back and i went out and got the stuff to encode so all you people saying that {C_P} is crap shut the hell up i learned to encode as i went along so i take any help i can get to improve my work. 

@bda420 i only get the sd channel that airs young justice so thats why it is 4:3 and i use avi the programs i use to do the epss use avi.  if you have advice for help come over to the irc channel ill take any help you have if it can help improve my work

@muckymucks the frame you are talking about is a black borders on the top and bottom of the screen i remove them to make it look better in the final version

@khabbs2335 it nice to see someone giving us a complament instead of bashing us"
,muckymucks,2012-05-02T06:56Z,"megate, I actually appreciate what you're doing but not the way you do it. If you're going to go through the trouble of uploading this show why not do it right? Eztv and ettv do it right. They do widescreen and a clean picture and the size is always 174mb or 175mb. Why can't you do that? You'd be helping out a lot of people."
,megate,2012-05-03T08:08Z,"@muckymucks this pic is the original cap file all i do to it is take off the bars at the top and bottom and adjust the size for 4:3

,flint03,2012-05-06T17:55Z,"Quality really isn't bad, definitely watchable. Where there has been a little ""over-cropping"" it doesn't inhibit the watching/enjoyment. muckymucks is just a whiner...he's bitched on all of the young justice season 1 torrents."
,zickboi,2012-05-12T03:46Z,these are great thank you CP
,Life-is-a-glitch,2012-06-10T18:05Z,"This really are TV rips guys. C_P is ALWAYS the first one to get episodes online (I've always download when the show comes out). But I would not recommend these after the fact when there a much better quality rips. 

Not to put any hate on C_P, keep up the good work dude. "
,slimHXCchance,2012-06-19T06:00Z,"Hmm lets look at some simple facts here:

muckymucks-
has uploaded... oh wow no surprise, NOTHING TO THE BAY.

Osmosian-
Also has uploaded ZERO to the Bay.

Myself-
I too have uploaded nothing.

The difference here? I dont go and trash someone who is at least trying to get these out to ppl like us. If he sucks so bad lets see you do better, oh wait you have already shown you cant by the simple fact you dont upload it. So lay off the guy.
Dude I dont have cable so I appreciate it regardless of the quality, which I have seen worse, so dont listen to these schmucks."
,querayos,2012-08-06T07:26Z,shut up and enjoy the show
,LEGENwait4itDARY,2012-08-19T11:41Z,Fuckin A/V Bitches!!?
