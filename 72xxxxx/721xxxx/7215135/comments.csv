,udidwht,2012-04-26T04:14Z,How's this compare to say REX or Active Sky? 
,_SnakEye,2012-04-26T11:03Z,"udidwht, If you got REX or ActiveSky, I wouldn't bother with this Product.
that IMO.."
,udidwht,2012-04-26T22:34Z,"^^^Much appreciated _SnakEye. I do have Active Sky 2012 but have not installed it. If you had a choice between the 3 which would you choose? Which looks the best and is FPS friendly. Still currently using the default textures for sky, clouds. But I have installed all the GEX and UTX items and fully updated on all. As well as numerous aircraft add-ons.

I've got the horsepower:

Windows 7 Ult 64bit SP1 (fully updated)
Core i5 2500k (stock clock)
Gigabyte GA-Z68XP-UD3 (BIOS F9)
8GB G-Skill Ripjaws
XFX HD Radeon 6870 1GB GDDR5 256bit (CCC-12.3)
1TB Hitachi SATA-3 32mb cache (7200)rpm
1TB Maxtor SATA-2 32mb cache (7200)rpm
Sound Blaster X-fi Xtreme Gamer
LG Blue Ray writer
Antec 650w PSU
Rosewill Mid tower black edition

Keep up the good work Snake."
,_SnakEye,2012-04-27T13:17Z,"I have not tried ActiveSky yet, but from what I am seeing the Sky textures are still not as good as REX.
If were you (actually what I am doing now).
I would go buy REX, Install it and wait for the REX Essential to be released (free Upgrade for all REX2 owners) and Upgrade to REX Essentials.
REX Essentials is probably the Best Weather / Textures Product combination, IMO it would be even better then ActiveSky.
That we will see when it would be released (probably in a week or to it should be released).

I am not so happy with your Display Adapter, i have a similar one and my FPS are not at the the best.
my Nvidia GTX275 yields much better FPS then my ATI6790. unfortunately my GTX275 died on me and I had to switch. 
when I was running it on my GTX275, I felt no FPS drop what so ever with REX.
I am going to replace my ATI6790 with an Nvidia GTX.. "
