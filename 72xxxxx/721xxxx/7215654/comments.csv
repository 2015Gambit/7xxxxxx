How come that I donÂ´t have it?"
,sum2010,2012-04-28T05:21Z,"- [qusawa]

litdreams is right, it has cinivia.   Mines started about 20 min in. Maybe it works on the old firmware version.  I have 4.11 installed.  Dammit :(."
,sum2010,2012-04-28T05:33Z,yes it has cinavia
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-04-28T09:09Z,"Try this solution:

- demux the .mp4 with YAMB 
- then make a .mkv with mkvmerge 
- then make a AVCHD with mkv2vob

Play and enjoy :)"
,godessnyx,2012-05-05T13:20Z,"Hey Zen_Bud, just wanted to say a big thank you for your Blu-ray rips. Love your work. Your stuff is always 100% dependable and 100% perfect. Thank you!"
,Jagga73,2012-05-09T03:05Z,Thanks for upload!!!
,celticwarrior22,2012-05-18T04:06Z,"There is a workaround for Cinavia although it can be a pain in the arse, when the sound goes off after 20 mins or so, quickly go to your PS3 time and date settings and move forward by a year i.e. 2013 (this should take 10 seconds) go back and resume the film and Cinavia is disabled for the next 20 mins. You can repeat the process through the entire film, moving the date forward by a year each time.

It's not perfect by any means but at least you can watch the entire film with sound albeit with a 10 second break every 20 mins while you change the date."
,znavy264,2012-05-23T06:09Z,There's absolutely no way this is 1080p...those resolutions usually fill up like at least 3GB....some are usually 5 or 6 GB.  This is only 949 MB?  Cmon stop trying to fool us.
,miguelll,2012-05-28T07:53Z,"WOW, amazing rip for such a small file, a/v=10"
,NoXzema,2012-05-31T08:12Z,"You know, to those guys doubting the file size... have any of you ever encoded a movie or video yourself? The quality lost in this torrent isn't bad at all... it just takes advantage of modern compression technology (or rather technology we've had since early 2000's but everyone thinks higher file size equals better quality...)"
,red2silver,2012-09-05T21:08Z,"@znavy264
Theres nothing to fool you. Try encoding a Bluray to a 5.1 (6 channels) & a stereo (2 channels) - you'll know the reason. A movie is essentially a series of images (the video) & audio. Here the 5.1 surround is being downgraded to stereo just as the bitrate of the video is being downgraded for hitting the targetted size"
