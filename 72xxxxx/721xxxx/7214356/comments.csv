,mycophage,2012-04-25T15:30Z,"Thanks for posting, and for the advisory about the slow initial upload. Cheers!"
,ChillReb,2012-04-26T13:14Z,In 7 1/2 hours I've Downloaded 4.0mb and Uploaded 5.5mb... WTF.... Last night there were twenty something seeders listed... Now they're all leechers... Why post a file this big if you can't support it...
,mycophage,2012-04-27T15:26Z,I suppose we could always ask for our money back ;-)
,Qwaszx54321,2012-04-28T02:28Z,The speed on this thing is atrocious. Been stuck at 4.0 mb downloaded and 2.1 mb uploaded for hours.
,the_snake_jake,2012-04-28T19:04Z,"Stuck at 4.2mb also for last 12 hours, what a joke"
,WinterGale,2012-04-29T07:53Z,"@ Everyone: I do apologize for not being able to seed these past days - internet's been down since tuesday. I did ask my girlfriend to seed this torrent. Hopefully, you can continue the download some time later today.

Once again i apologize for the inconvenience."
,WinterGale,2012-05-01T05:44Z,I'm back!! Internet's been fixed so I'll finally be able to seed this again!
,mycophage,2012-05-06T14:57Z,"Thanks - I have completely downloaded and can verify that the game works on my MacBook Pro (10.6.8, 2.3 GHz Intel i7).

Having some trouble with the right-click/mouse button 2 commands - Command key combos with the trackpad button don't seem to work, and remapping keys has been unhelpful. If anyone else has similar problems (and solves them), please share your solution with us!"
,WinterGale,2012-05-06T19:29Z,"Yeah, controls are a tad confusing but it's not really a bug, or even if it is, you'll learn to get used to it. Also, if you do remap the controls, some would only appear as ""unrecognized"" but in reality you've actually changed it.

Like when I changed the FIRE button from Mouse 1 to Spacebar, it said control unrecognized but in-game, it actually works...

Hope this helps..."
,bigbellyman,2012-05-08T15:44Z,It downloaded fine but it keeps asking me for a product key....what am i doing wrong
,WinterGale,2012-05-08T16:47Z,"@bigbellyman Try this:

1. Copy the Battlestations: Pacific folder to your Applications folder or desired installation directory.

2. Open the crack and OVERWRITE the Battlestations Pacific.app with the one from the crack file.

3. Run the game, the launcher will still ask for a product key but just click ""Play with Disc"" and the game will run just fine.

4. Incidentally, also use Little Snitch to deny all outgoing/incoming connections from the game. (Optional)"
