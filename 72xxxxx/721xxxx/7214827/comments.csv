,...TPB...,2012-08-10T20:00Z,"Obama's sure come through on all his promises! It doesn't matter if you agree with his ideals or not, this president has been the biggest failure since the great depression. A great president pulls people together (i.e. Clinton, Reagan), makes Americans on both sides want to work together. Instead he's torn this country apart using class warfare and personal attacks on his rivals. His presidency has been a total disaster, no matter how you look at it. 

PS - I voted for him too. I fell for his charm and personality like everyone else. I was hopeful for change, just not THIS kind of change (America going from being the richest country in the world to becoming a 3rd world nation). Countries around the world are getting ready to switch from the dollar backing their currency to the Chinese Yuan because America is so far in debt. When that happens, we won't be able to print as much money as we want anymore. It WILL BE the end of American as we know it. We've been spoiled by being able to print as much money as we want to cover our debt, but that will change soon. Do the research yourself if you don't believe me. You can thank Obama when gas is $10 a gallon."
