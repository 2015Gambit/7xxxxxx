,ALAINPAIN,2012-04-25T19:04Z,"oh nice - my sergio Leonie HD collection is coming along nicely - this is an often ignored classic from the Italian master - not up to themark of his other work but still head and shoulders above a lot of the dross released in hollywood today 
Thanks for this "
,sintran,2012-04-25T21:01Z,Seed please :)
,indiovega,2012-04-26T14:00Z,Please Don't Be Some Asshole that won't seed his own Torrent?
,ALAINPAIN,2012-04-26T20:11Z,why is no one seeding this? i will keep waiting in the hope of some divine intervention - my sergio dream is slowly dying but hope still remains
,indiovega,2012-04-27T00:59Z,We are being Jacked Off!!This is his first and Only Upload...
,ALAINPAIN,2012-04-27T23:09Z,this is one of the most depressing torrents ever seen - seeds for a minute then stops for hours ????
