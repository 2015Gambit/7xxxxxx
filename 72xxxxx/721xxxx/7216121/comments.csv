If you have any more there are still issues I cant find that seem to be absent from those torrents. If I can get them all I was thinking up putting up a torrent with the whole collection, but so far no luck finding the missing ones. Everything prior to 2008 seems to be out there already in active torrents but not the ones since. Thanks again."

*Infestation 2: Dungeon & Dragons Eberron 01 + 02, *Infestation 2: Team-Up 01, *Infestation 2: G.I. Joe 01 + 02, and *Infestation 2: 30 days of Night 01.

Everything else has already been posted. Also, I just noticed I don't have the original INfestation storyline..Anyone out there have the complete collection of that?
