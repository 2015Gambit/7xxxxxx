I'm using VLC.

Also it'd be nice if you didn't include spoilers in the file names. Thanks for the uploads though."

Not issues detected (I watched it all yesterday), I think is fail of your machine / configuration. The language is Catalan, if you read the .nfo you will see:

Language...........: Catalan

And it's not spoiler, ppl need to know what downloads, if there is a extratime or penalties these files 'll be called so."
