This is a custom work. I chose the French Bach DVD for it's supeior image with better grayscale, as I was unhappy with the other editions available. I created new English intertitle screens, and had native speakers create new subtitles in eight languages. Then I carefully edited together a new soundtrack from Philip Glass songs. Also included is the Russian piano soundtrack from the Ruscico edition.


These songs by Philip Glass were used in the soundtrack: 
Metamorphosis Four, Back To The Hive, Facades, In The Upper Room, 
City Walk, Closing, Dance 8, Girlfriend, My Building Disappeared, 
Screens Of Memory, The Hours Suite, Portrait Of Chuck Close, Three Truths, 
Where Have You Been Asked The Doctor, The Encounter, 
1000 Airplanes On The Roof, What Time Is Grey
