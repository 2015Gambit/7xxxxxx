,thubz010,2012-05-15T12:25Z,"right...

1. the ""trojan"" is not a virus your anti virus says it because he doesnt know the file and asume its a trojan, dont believe me GL finding a game without that error.

2. sound tracks are probeley found on the website or in the files of your game.

3. thanks for upload altho mine isn't working keeps crashing.. :) working onit"
