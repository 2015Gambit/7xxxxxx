Plot-Sarah returns home to her troubled family after a much put off visit. As a storm rages through the countryside, she and her family find themselves isolated. As night falls, cut off from the outside world, a bloodthirsty creature comes out of the darkness tearing through their home leaving the group besieged. Trapped and scared, the few who survive its initial attack will put a strategic plan together to stop the creature that is hunting them down limb by limb only to discover that the creature, itself, is already among them.
