A=10
V=10
M=7
SUBS=100!!!

Would love Norwegian sound for my kids ;)

If enyone has problems with the subs.
Download mkvmerge and set your language subs as default=yes, => Start muxing and you are up and running with your subtitle, works with WMP,VLC and not at least XBMC
It's not hard to do this (I'm a girl, be a man ;) )"
