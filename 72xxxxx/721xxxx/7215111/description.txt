The Greek island Kos is one of the most popular holiday destinations in the Aegean. Kos International Airport "Hippocrates" is situated in an idyllic atmosphere, directly by the sea and between two ridges. It is particularly approached by European charter airlines during the summer.

The airport is a faithful copy of all original airport buildings. Accommodated landclasses, coastlines, and a detailed mesh for the entire island ensure that the airport is beautifully embedded in the countryside. Various details, different scenery-effects and many little objects provide a lively atmosphere at the airport.
