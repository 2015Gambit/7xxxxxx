,Slave4UBB,2012-04-30T21:12Z,"Thank you so much for ripping and posting these episodes for us! Your version is always the best quality.

Can you please also rip RuPaul's Drag U off LogoTV's website and post them here as torrents? I can't seem to find the episodes anywhere. All full episodes are on Logo's website but I can't watch them since I'm outside the US. Here are the links:

Season 1:

Season 2:

Thanks in advance!"
