"Are you caught in the business of preaching, teaching, and running the church? Then Peterson, a pastors pastor, will speak words of refreshment and wisdom to your heart! His chapters begin with poetic reflections on the Beatitudes and then address themes such as curing souls, praying with eyes open, the language of prayer, the ministry of small talk, and sabbatical---all illustrated with engaging personal anecdotes. Several poems on the incarnation finish the work. A timely book for pastors who want and need to get back to the basics."
