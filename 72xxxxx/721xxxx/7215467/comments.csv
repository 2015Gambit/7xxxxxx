1.) Movie is 95% English but parts of it are NOT in English and are NOT subtitled.

2.) Main characters are introduced with on screen text. This is not in English nor subtitled. Movie also ends with on-screen text for each of the major characters. Again not in English and not subtitles.

Had I known the above I would have downloaded another version."
