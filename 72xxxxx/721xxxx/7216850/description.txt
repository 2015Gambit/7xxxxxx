Dead Famous: Ghostly Encounters[1] is a British paranormal reality television series that originally aired on LivingTV from June 15, 2004 to June 13, 2006. The program searches for the alleged ghosts of famous deceased people. Curious skeptic Gail Porter and clairvoyant Chris Fleming take a road trip through America looking for the haunted locations where legends of stage, screen, and music reside. Described by the channel as "like a sharper, sexier, and funnier Mulder and Scully", the duo visits places where celebrity spirits are claimed roam: their hotel rooms, diners, gardens, film lots, and theatres.

The show was produced by Twofour[2] originally for broadcast on LivingTV, but because of its popularity, it can be seen in many countries and is currently aired on the Biography Channel.

serial killer?
