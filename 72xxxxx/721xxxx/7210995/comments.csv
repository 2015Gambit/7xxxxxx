,mistermayhem666,2012-04-24T21:42Z,thanks alot killer ;9)
,cris11,2012-04-28T07:48Z,"youre welcome misterman
This application is a must and its very good to remove even the registry entries when u had installed without your approval a 3rd party application.
For example ive installed recently a video converter and that thing installed by force a ""Pandora Tv"" which was trying to make some settings in cmd.exe and a registry scaner ( reg4you). I could remove those 2 additional entries even with a lot new registry (forced) keys"
,unicodex,2012-04-28T08:31Z,"Crack did not register the program?
Why a portable version of the folder with the crack throw?"
,srki011,2012-04-29T01:31Z,"Installation file is good and clean !

Revo recently helped me to uninstall the messy ADOBE CS5 and found left on computer :
1629 keys with 1635 values !!!
Now im gonna install Adobe cs 6 :))"
,trinity8,2012-06-17T04:03Z,I don't have an 'install' file/folder showing up once I've done the install and so I'm not sure where to put the crack file.  Does it just go into the Revo Uninstaller Pro folder?
,rodrigues94,2012-07-28T23:27Z,thanks
,mariusgv,2012-08-01T13:13Z,"Thank you, cris!!! ;)"
,joynerjoyner,2012-08-27T11:44Z,"@trinity8 Unrar the regular Revo Unin. Pro and install it (remember the directory where it went). Open it after installation. Go to tools, then into options, then uncheck the update box. Now CLOSE THE PROGRAM. Go into the crack folder and copy the Revo Pro in there and paste-replace it into where the regular Revo is."
