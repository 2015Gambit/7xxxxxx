The Cornshed Sisters are a North-east folk-pop quartet who include Marie Nixon (previously of Kenickie), and their debut album, produced by Field Music's Peter Brewis (a Cornshed husband), is filled with beguiling close-harmony tunes which wouldn't feel out of place on the Wicker Man soundtrack, and sound like venerable trad-arrs but are actually originals.
Highlights include anti-fur parable "Pies for the Fair", and the poignant "Dance at My Wedding". Lovely.
