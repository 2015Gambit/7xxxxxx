,jessibren,2012-06-19T06:57Z,"Great torrent the only thing that bugs me is that for the most part the openings and ending are completely cut out from the episodes.
Apart from that the quality and subs are great"
,Artorias,2012-06-22T00:21Z,"@jessibren Agreed, the openings show alot of good seens. to bad that there all cut out "
,kaffmx,2012-07-24T22:45Z,"for me the subs for the dialogue don't apear every time there is a sign in the scene, it shows the subs for the sign instead. that happens quite a lot, I could say I miss half of the dialogue because of this. I'm using GOM player.

the video and audio quality are great though!"
