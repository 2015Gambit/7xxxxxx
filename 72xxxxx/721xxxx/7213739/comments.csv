,RarePlop,2012-05-07T14:10Z,"hawkbs, Thanks for downloading your friend's torrent."
,RarePlop,2012-05-08T07:27Z,"hawkbs, Further more, the fact that you have an account on The Pirate Bay suggests you are a major hypocryte.  It's only okay to download people's material that can see is it?
  10 People have downloaded this track, so taking into account that 9 people probably wouldn't buy it anyway and only download it to have in their collection.  I'd say at $1.19 Rachel would get around 20 cents.
  Also, the fact that you are concerned about contacting shine Australia (which is a company that creates/produces reality tv) proves you are a douche bag.  Why wouldn't your concern be for a charity for the blind if you are so passionate?
Torrents are not about getting things for free.  Do you think a person with 10,000 songs on a hard-drive would buy all those songs if torrents weren't available?  
So to conclude, it appears you are a hand-flapping whinge bag that wants to be seen to be doing the right thing with no real concern for the cause you're becoming emotionally unstable about."
