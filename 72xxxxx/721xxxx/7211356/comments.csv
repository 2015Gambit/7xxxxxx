[V],psspss,2012-04-24T08:28Z,"not sure i understand

the main reason I use brackets to to delimited
the title and add air date -1 day if your in usa

the problem with the way cappers do it
is if you have a show title called PROPER
or BAD or corrupted etc

pawn.stars.S01E01,corrupted.xvid.avi

now people will ask is this file corrupted

brackets keep it neat and clear"
