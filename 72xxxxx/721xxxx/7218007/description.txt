The above links to the same files I was unable to seed properly.

Sorry for the inconvenience!

NB My free Dropbox account allows a limit of 20 GB/file/day 

This means only 13 downloads per 24 hour period.

The paid service would allow 130 downloads per day.

My free account may be terminated at any time.
