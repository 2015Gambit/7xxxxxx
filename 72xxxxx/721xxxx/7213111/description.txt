
RMS Titanic officially sank at 2:20 a.m. Of the over 2200 passengers and crew aboard, only 713 survived, including the survivors of Collapsible Boat B, who were rescued by the crew of Carpathia early in the morning of April 15, 1912.
A month after the sinking, the partially-eaten body of Richard Bartholemew Greenfield III was discovered by the crew of the fishing vessel, Plymouth. The body was never identified, but the fishing boat's crew did find interest in a document found on the corpse that spoke of a plan to collect insurance money for the sinking of the RMS Olympic. The letter has been passed down through the generations and the weathered and faded remnant now hangs in the helm of the Plymouth IV, where it is generally ignored.
