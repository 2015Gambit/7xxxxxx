,analogmonkey,2012-04-26T07:04Z,"THANKS A MILLION for posting this!!

I am having trouble with the last 75mb or so.  any ideas on how to fix this issue?  "
,JUSTSIN,2012-04-26T08:39Z,"@analogmonkey: If you're using Utorrent, try this: Stop the torrent, right-click on torrent and select ""Force Re-Check"" then start your torrent again. If that doesn't work try right-clicking on same torrent, choose Advanced then Reset Bans or Clear Peer List.

@SsputnikK: I haven't stopped seeding since I posted this torrent. I hope you and everybody else is able to finish downloading this torrent.

@EVERYONE: Be cool and seed once you're finished downloading.

Thanx,

JUSTSIN"
