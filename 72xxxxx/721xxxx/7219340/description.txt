Narratives:

 If you arenÆt familiar with The M Machine, it's time for you to learn more about them because the trio of djs/producers have just unleashed their biggest release to date. Their debut EP ôMetropolis Pt. 1? is a fantastic EP that definitely exceeded expectations. Even though theyÆve released a total of 10 originals since their creation in July, ôMetropolis Pt. 1? cements the M Machine as some of the most talented boundary-pushing artists today.
