,liheh,2012-04-26T17:42Z,There are only three Realplayer programs without any setup or instruction. How the hack do you expect people to do with it. Copy them into the Real installation folders or use them stand alone? Include some instruction for God's sake. None of the 100 + people who downloaded this did not even say anything.  Do they all know what to do with this or just donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t want to be bothered?
