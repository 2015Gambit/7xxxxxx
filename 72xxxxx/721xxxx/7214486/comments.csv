,ani789,2012-04-25T13:56Z,"@all who cannot extract johnny movie, put .zip.001 and .zip.002 both files in a single folder. Download a small software called HJSplit for free(google it). Open hjsplit(no installation required), click on join button and select .zip.001 file. It starts joining both files and gives you single zip file. Now extract this zip as usual using winrar or 7zip"

DL either WinRAR or 7Zip software and open the zip archive with that. Default windows zip manager might not be able to handle zip files with high compression ratio. It worked for me with WinRAR"
