
Thanks for the comment EffieLewis (nice name).
Please keep seeding !!
 
I seed EE until I see ten or more other pirates seeding, then I go to bed. 
Youngsters go to bed for fun, but I am very old, and I need my sleep !!
 
I sometimes upload programs from BBC2 or BBC4 during the night.
I don't think they would interest EE viewers.
