In Oregon, Richard puts his logging skills to the test when attempting to learn three harvesting machines that cut and process wood. The Feller-Buncher, which is used to cut down trees, can process 1,000 trees a day. The Dangle Head Processor cuts, strips and slices wood in less than a minute, while the Log Loader adds organization to the chaos by stacking logs. But prior to jumping into these massive vehicles, Richard must scale a tree like a true lumberjack and learn how the Luoto family maintains their sustainable forest.
