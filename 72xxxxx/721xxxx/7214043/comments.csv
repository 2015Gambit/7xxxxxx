,marker3221,2012-04-25T20:48Z,"Legit. thanks a lot man, appreciate the speedy torrent! "
,reznorfan15,2012-04-25T23:28Z,"confirmed legit. also, this album fucking blows ass. i've been listening to marilyn manson since 1995 and today i'm sad to say i renounce that fandom. i man, this is actually worse than his last two albums, and we all know that's saying a lot. it's clear now what marilyn mansion's music is missing: trent reznor. the only exception to this was the awesome production micheal beinhorn contributed for mechanical animals. after that album it's been all downhill. i'm glad i didn't waste money on this. it's crap. absolute crap. kills me to say it, but it is what it is, and it is crap. twiggy's guitar riffs are mediocre at best and manson vocals are just....ugh."
,haivinyl,2012-04-26T02:19Z,"Nah, Reznor has been a PETA-pimping nerdy loser since his early 2000s rehab as you can hear of every one of his crappy albums after The Fragile. Only credibility he's got is that he hasn't yet converted to scientology (but he probably will).

Manson's still fully got it and even if you disagree, it's not Reznor that this band needs. Not to say new blood is always welcome... for example, Fred Sablan seems to be a great new addon.

I love this album, I love all of them. Will be buying it."
,creative_expansion,2012-04-26T04:45Z,"@reznorfan15    Fucking finally somebody who knows good music, same here i agree 100 percent with u, mansion hasn't been good for years unfortunately, trent reznor is a real musician. i could go on all day and ppl will argue but thanks to the uploader.....good quality files"
,creative_expansion,2012-04-26T04:46Z,manson*
,creative_expansion,2012-04-26T04:57Z,wow i just previewed it.....manson should be embarrassed! its fucking garbage! what happened to his vocals? ugh bad bad disappointing
