can you pls upload a trainer for game to"
,tpb3571,2012-04-25T22:22Z,how is this 1.1.4?  after installing the update. I loaded the game and it shows version 1.1.3
,DarkkFate,2012-04-25T22:24Z,"Not working for me, either.  Using Windows XP.  When trying to run ""Grimrock.exe"" you get the following error message: ""The application or DLL *insert installation path here*d3dx9_43.dll is not a valid Windows image.  Please check this against your installation diskette.""

It doesn't matter where I install it, you get the same error no matter what."
,Vestilence,2012-04-25T23:29Z,"I deleted that dll and the game works fine for me, but none of the fixes are present, no volume sliders or import portrait feature, among other things."
,IndigoAK,2012-04-25T23:59Z,"This is NOT 1.1.4.

If you pay close attention to the name of the file that you download, this is the original 1.0.08 version of the game.

Do not download if you have a newer version because the installer will just skip to the end without changing anything."
,Ranguvar,2012-04-26T02:10Z,"Indigo, be sure of your facts before accidentally misleading people.

GoG installers use different version numbers than the game itself.  The original was 1.0.0.6 (https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7177984/Legend.of.Grimrock-RELOADED), this is 1.0.0.8.

Just because the installer says 1.0.0.8 does not mean the game will be."
,Ranguvar,2012-04-26T03:16Z,"Found the solution to the game still saying 1.1.3 -- delete your old grimrock.exe, dlls, grimrock.dat, etc. before installing.  Or rename them to .baks."
,DarkkFate,2012-04-26T03:26Z,"Actually, I simply deleted the offending .dll file (the d3dx9_43 one) and ran the .exe from the GoG ""version"" of the folder, and voila! 1.1.4 with volume slider, quicksave, etc.

Might be worth a try if you're getting those errors like I was.  Also, the installer does say 1.0.8 or w/e, it's in the documentation readme to ignore this.  It is 1.1.4 once you get rid of that pesky .dll file."
,IndigoAK,2012-04-26T09:30Z,"@Ranguvar:

Bitch shit pussy cunt motherfucker!

(I stand corrected.)"
,arrow_in_the_knee,2012-04-26T12:45Z,"listen to DarkkFate, it works!"
,Captain_Zero,2012-04-28T17:25Z,"This works fine. It's the real 1.14 patch. Delete/rename the following from the game folder:
- D3DX9_43.dll
- FreeImage.dll
- goggame.dll
- grimrock.dat
- grimrock.exe

Run the patch from the game folder (as admin) and it replaces the files above. You now have 1.14 in the menu with all the fixes and extras."

,xpk7,2012-05-04T14:34Z,"@ben_l_ssq: DX3DX9_43.DLL installed with this patch is for 64-bit OS, so replace it with the old one (for 32-bit OS), or find any DX3DX9_*.DLL file in your Windowssystem32 folder and copy it into LoG folder."
,Atomsk1,2012-06-03T08:53Z,Is this the full game or just the update?
,Kalypsis,2012-06-28T03:52Z,"For everyone with .dll problems, you can download a fixer that installs it here: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7393791"
,GoodTunes,2012-07-14T11:17Z,"Works fine for me, just installed over the RELOADED version, nothing else.

Don't see how you folks are having issues."
,LeitorDeQuadrinhos,2012-07-22T19:42Z,I had two dll problems. I solved both with Dll Fixer from http://www.dll-files.com/. But now I'm having the following problem when I try to run the game: http://i637.photobucket.com/albums/uu96/D3M0D3M0/error.png Someone knows how to solve it?
