,b1893757,2012-04-27T08:32Z,"Whale Wars: Viking Shores, a new five-part series beginning Friday, April 27, at 9 PM (et/pt), follows the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society as it sets sail to end this ancient tradition, known as ""The Grind"" (Faroese for ""whale drive""), that takes place every summer. Each new one-hour episode airs on Fridays at 9 PM (et/pt).

For the first time in the history of the Whale Wars saga, the Sea Shepherds are not only at sea but also deploying a covert team to patrol the streets, interact with locals and carry out undercover missions. For this campaign, the Sea Shepherd arsenal has been upgraded with a new ultra-lightweight aircraft and mobile acoustical devices to deter the whales from the islands. The flagship Steve Irwin (captained by Paul Watson) and Brigitte Bardot (captained by Fraser Hall) join the land-sea-air operation to provide backup along the coast. A Grind can happen at any moment, and the Sea Shepherds are vastly outnumbered and behind enemy lines in a new kind of face-to-face battle.
