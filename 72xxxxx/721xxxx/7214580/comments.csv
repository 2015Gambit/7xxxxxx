,fredphoesh,2012-05-26T19:35Z,Im not sure HOW anyone could rate the video quality on this as ANYTHING above a 4. It is VERY pixelated... a bad encoding of a good quality original... as all the ViP3R rips of this movie are at this time... probably from the same crappy rip.

[T],FaeGiN,2012-06-13T16:26Z,"Oh this bloody age of re-encodes is doing my head in. 
Question: How the hell can a re-encode of an already pixelated source, then compressed down to almost half of it's original size, BE BETTER?

Answer: It cannot possibly, in this world, be better."
,Keeeez,2012-07-17T15:41Z,don't complain about quality you fuckheads it clearly tells you what the resolution is in the description. It's good enough quality to be able to enjoy the documentary. Quit whining and wait for the DVD release if you don't like it. Not like it's costing you anything anyway....
