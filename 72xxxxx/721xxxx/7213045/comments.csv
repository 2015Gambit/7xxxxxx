,mrkurtz,2012-06-23T07:37Z,"yes, this does indeed have a little extra with it.

doesn't appear to have any rootkits or actual viruses, or lingering backdoors, but the installation (which presumably works, i didn't bother going any further) also installs a bitcoin miner to add to someone's bitcoin pool.

not hard to disable, it pulls the files down via batch scripts and ftp, uses a program named svchost.exe, which obviously isn't svchost.exe.

also disables the firewall in order to allow the miner to work.

seems to dump everything into the following folder: C:ProgramDataadob - just delete everything.

kill the ftp process, delete the files, you should be good to go."
,mrkurtz,2012-06-23T07:38Z,"and don't forget to turn your firewall back on, will probably need to go into your system services to re-enable it."
,brk254,2012-07-02T02:42Z,"Yeah, this guy has a bitcoin miner installed. Not cool. Not cool at all. If you install it, go to processes, find the one labeled bitcoin miner (it will call the process scvhost.exe although it clearly isn't). Right click, show in folder, then delete the whole folder (named 1 8)."
,brk254,2012-07-02T02:43Z,My bad. Someone already addressed this. I feel dumb for not reading the comments first.
