,coop02,2012-06-10T15:14Z,"This does work, I'm not entirely sure why its a .jar file, and being computer literate I'm not a fan of .jar files. They can do things that I don't want them to do, and for some reason it is trying to execute a file that can be used by Finale, so is placing a ""Finale Files"" folder in ""Documents"". *THIS DOES WORK* but I don't like how it works, sorry to be a bit of a heel :)"
,coop02,2012-06-10T15:32Z,"So saying, I have had a look inside the Jar file with Pacifist and I can't see anything too disconcerting."
