""Do it all for the glory of God"" (1 Corinthians 10:31) right?  But, just the same, your kind words are very much appreciated.  Truth be told, it's a bit frustrating at times for me to see my torrents die off so quickly.  And because of that lack of continued seeding support, I've been praying on perhaps taking these Christian albums elsewhere online.  Sharing them elsewhere.  So the timing of your kind words is indeed appreciated.

As for Pettidee, I believe he has about 10 albums out.  Unfortunately I only have about half of them.  Just the same, hopefully there's something within this discography that you are looking for."
,TedDekker,2012-04-25T23:54Z,"TorrentTracts! Please do not go! And if you do please let me know where you will upload in the future! You are truly amazing! I know what kind of work you have been doing and it has been incredibly hard. You are a true blessing to everyone who has the chance to listen to any of the Christian Music that you upload. I wish there was a way I could repay you help you. At least for now I can include you in my prayers and have God bless you in everything you do! 

I hope one day to have your entire collection! I think it is so amazing that if you need to listen to stuff you have something uplifting to turn to. 

Thank You oh so much for the pettidee upload that was much appreciated and yes that was a great collection thank you. 

Only other thing that I do not know if you enjoy collecting would be excellent praise and worship music like what is in the modern churches. Like Heaven Fall Down, Light of the World, Sanctuary, Lord of All, Spirit Fall, Beautiful Things … Or you know like Passion, Phil Wickham, Steve Fee, Matthew West, Jesus Culture, and Northpoint.  Basically I didn’t know if you had a praise and worship package or folder. But don’t worry about it now I know you are busy.

In any case man are a very uplifting individual. I look forward to sharing with you in the future! Please keep your head up and do not get discouraged! If you ever need prayer or uplifting please leave a comment and I’ll be right there my friend! I hope you have a wonderful day and God Bless!

[V],TorrentTracts,2012-04-26T03:40Z,"TedDekker, thank you for your prayers.

Worship music is by far my favorite.  I can't ever get enough of it.  I always keep a healthy supply of the ""Worship Together"" series in my disc changer here at home.  As a matter of fact, you've inspired me to gather together some of those groups you've mentioned below, and create my next batch of torrents with 'em.  :)"
,TedDekker,2012-04-26T04:31Z,"TorrentTracks! Yes by far praise and worship music is by far my favorite as well! I have some very special and meaningful tracks that have collected and have gotten me through the years. Especially the song “Word’s Apart” the 11th hour edition by Jars of Clay, Touching the father’s house – Light the Fire Again [Volume 18] Edition, also songs, There is Freedom, Greater Grace, Eternity, Into Your Presence, Could I, I LOVE “Creation Calls …, Be the Centre, Breathe, and so so many more! I have even edited some of these tracks and combined them to make them longer into one track for instance several of Rita Springer songs are great for that!

I love oh so love praise and worship songs like this. If you have a massive collection of praise and worship yes that would be amazing to put that in a huge package like you do for the 2011 packages or 2012 packages! Only if you have time!

One day I would like to put my custom praise and worship together and also all of my Vineyards because you can no longer buy them and they are in the vault. I know a lot of people would benefit from them!

God bless you so much! I am so thankful for everything you do! I am sure your home is filled with the Spirit and lovely music! Right now I am listening to “There is Freedom” 9:25 praise song it is so Amazing!

Have a wonderful night!

[V],TorrentTracts,2012-04-26T15:00Z,"Yeah, I certainly wish my collection was like that.  I don't even have much of my music archived in a list, much less identified by which genre it is.  In a perfect world, it would be listed together in a single file, the style of music would be identified, and finding it on my hard drives would be easy.  Then creating these torrents would indeed be easier.  :)"
,TedDekker,2012-04-27T13:31Z,Your music is greatly appreciated! My collection is kind of scattered as well. The important thing is that we have it. Thanks for the all the kind upload requests that you have fulfilled.
