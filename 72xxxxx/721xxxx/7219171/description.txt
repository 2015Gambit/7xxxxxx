Grow Your Own concerns a most unusual therapy doled out to local refugee families in London: an analyst allots a parcel of land to each group, and asks its kinfolk to farm vegetables there. Naturally, a myriad of complications arise - from a young man named Kenny (Alan Williams, who refuses to comply with the given ordinance and paint his hut red, to Miriam (Diveen Henry), a widow who believes that the spirit of her late husband has returned in the form of one of the gardeners, Little John (Eddie Marsan), to a Chinese immigrant, Kung Sang (Benedict Wong) whose wife died when packed into a shipping container. Matters grow increasingly sticky and complex for everyone when a cell phone company turns up and insists on planting an obtrusive mast in the middle of the land.
