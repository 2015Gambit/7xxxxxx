,tr99tr,2012-04-25T22:02Z,maximersk are you trying to win the Légion d'honneur for all these french films
,Boide,2012-04-25T22:34Z,@tr99tr : What you have against French?
,Allier31,2012-04-25T23:42Z,Merci!
,nutella59,2012-04-26T23:38Z,"No problem with the French movies: some are real great. My problem is just with the politically correct b.s. about the ""moderate muslims"" allegedly victim of ""islamophobia"" (a term invented by islamist propaganda) fighting ""for liberty and democracy"" against the ""extremist muslims"", which to me is like saying that the S.A. were better than the S.S. : that is real bullshit!
Just like with nazism, Islam must be fought before it's going to cost too many lives.
Of course, the pacifidiots and paciphoneys, jus like in the '30s, they preach peace while the other side is strengthening to fight a war with all means... Then the peacenicks' money came from Stalin's URSS, now it comes from oil producing countries..."
,steveru,2012-04-27T01:33Z,All French movies suck....everyone knows that ;0)
,aarjcas,2012-04-27T01:53Z,lol nutellas mad
,nutella59,2012-04-27T19:38Z,"Not at all.
The movie doesn't underline AT ALL the FACT that the main character is a Sufi, a sect that has been heavily persecuted all over in Islam (especially in Tutkey, even by the secular Young Turks), outlawed in many muslim countries and the only one with some spiritual dimension which preaches peace and respect for non muslims. They are not only a minority, they are almost nonexistent in today's Islam...
In fact, most islamic countries and leaders were allied with the nazis during W.W. II, they massacred the Jews in Baghdad in 1941, in a mass-murder called the Farhoud, and the Muslim spiritual leader, Haj Amin Al Husseini, even lived in Berlin in 1941-1943, and founded an SS Muslim Division in Bosnia...which during W.W. II, among other things, was co-responsible of the genocide of over one million Christian Serbs and Jews..."

So neither a French nor an American point of view on terrorism. Refreshing.

Thanks to maximersk & seeders."

{all french movies suck}"
,franglais,2012-05-02T16:47Z,"Don't feed the trolls. 
@Boide: you don't understand tr99tr's comment; his comment says  nothing bad about the French. He might be suggesting that the uploader is kissing ass, but that's it."
,tiz2,2012-05-03T12:08Z,"@ nutella59: Your arguments lack perspective, depth, and intelligence. So Islam should be ""fought""? I assume you mean the Muslims should be fought, since you can't literally fight a concept or an idea. What about the ones living here in Europe, maybe they should be put in concentration camps? Wouldn't that make a great ""Endlösung"" for you? Your claim that most Muslim countries were allied with the Nazi's are not true. Most were neutral, some were still beholden to their colonial slave-masters, and only independent Muslim forces allied with the Germans. Haj Mohammed Effendi Amin el-Husseini were the Grandmufti of Jerusalem, and was trying to stop a Zionist takeover of his country, you can debate if his decisions were wise, but they are understandable. So what if a few Muslims allied with the Nazis? What kind argument is that, when the Nazis themselves were all white Christian Europeans? You might not be mad, but ""Islam must be fought before it's going to cost too many lives"" was pretty much the exact reasoning behind the Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik's killing of 77 people. "
,tiz2,2012-05-03T13:11Z,"@nutella59: Your facts about Sufism are incorrect as well. While the Sufi historically have been persecuted, there's religious freedom in Turkey today, and the Whirling Dervishes of the Mawlaw'īyya Sufi are a popular tourist attraction, and an iconic image used in tourism advertising for Turkey."

,iamhelix,2012-05-05T13:29Z,"FUCK SOME OF YOU ARE IDIOTS
these comments are to post on quality of torrent not your opinion! 

no one has even commented on quality!

Fuck tards."
,sillig,2012-05-05T19:22Z,Clearly some of those here haven't understood that almost no one is interested in their views on anything besides the quality of the file. Exchanging views are anything else when it's all done anonymously by people you'll never meet is simply a waste of time.

Do you know that a million is a six (6) digit number?
When jews were persecuted in Spain during the 15th century, which was the only European country that welcomed them?"
