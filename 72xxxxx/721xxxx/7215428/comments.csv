Hardcoded French subtitles."
,kxwaal,2012-08-24T23:47Z,"Dakota1000's comment is incorrect - the French subtitles, while they ARE displayed by default in many media players (like my preferred ones, VLC and KMplayer) - All you have to do is uncheck the 'display subtitles' option - or straight up delete the *.srt file containing them.... The commenter claiming otherwise probably was fooled, not realizing the subtitle function was activated - The file seems to work fine, looking forward to introducing my girlfriend to this masterpiece - Thank you!!! :D"
