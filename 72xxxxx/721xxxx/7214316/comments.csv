,Tokerific,2012-04-26T15:54Z,"Strange how Nightwolf is shows as 2012 on IMDB but 13 Hrs (night wolf) is shown as 2010. Was it reshot, re-edited, ending FX fixed???"
,BluOrchids,2012-04-26T16:26Z,@gellis2010: haha pretty much this
,st0gey,2012-04-26T16:38Z,"Fuck, what a shite movie! At least Dog Soldiers had some humour in it. This is just a bunch of useless toffs getting killed by some twat in a monster suit. Honestly, this movie is total fucking arse-gravy. Still, i suppose the audio and video quality was good."
,nogloryrory11,2012-04-26T18:22Z,"@ moremetalthanyou,

That's because the Night Wolf page has only been reviewed by 26 people, which most likely  are the cast and crew themselves, lol.

Clever ruse against folks that don't pay enough attention perhaps."
