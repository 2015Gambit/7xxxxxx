,Dramat,2012-04-25T01:50Z,I've done those screens in like 5 minutes. If there is something You do not know/understand - if something is not clear for You - please post a comment. I'll make another screens to show step-by-step what maybe unclear.

I've made those screens in my spare time using my own uTorrent view as an answer for comment under one of my torrents. To be honest I do not know any tutorial pages of different torrent clients. Maybe You will contribute Your Part and do something like that? "
,jimbuck2,2012-04-25T11:33Z,Thanks Dramat.  I noticed your download worked pretty quickly.  Hopefully this will help some of the new seeders whose links never seem to work.
