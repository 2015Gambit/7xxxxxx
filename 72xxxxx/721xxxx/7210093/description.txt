Pink Floyd - Building the Wall DEMOS(2001)@320kbps

Promo CD rip

So you thought the Immersion Box set and the Under Construction bootleg were 
the last word in The Wall demos? 

In early 1978, Roger Waters began laying down tracks for 2 records; The Wall 
and Pros And Cons Of Hitchhiking. Pros And Cons was passed on by the band, and
Roger would later release it as a solo album. The Wall would become a magnum 
opus and watermark for all concept records to follow. This CD released in 2001,
contains the entire set of demos that Roger recorded, performing all vocals, 
guitar, bass, keyboards and drum machine tracks. UNBELIEVABLE stuff, with many
alternate lyrics! Complete demo tracks for The Wall album. Composed at 
Britannia Row Studios, Islington, UK

This CD has lyrical and musical arrangements that those who have heard the box set will be familiar with, however, it expands on the snippets of songs we were given on Immersion and as the album progresses completely new takes on a lot of songs. 

The Album is presented with songs in order making for a more satisfying listening experience.  Quality wise, while it does not reach the standard set by the 2011 remasters, it is excellent....  a really enjoyable experience for any Pink Floyd fan.
