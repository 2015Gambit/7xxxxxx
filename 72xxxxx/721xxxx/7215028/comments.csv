,SomeGuy2005,2012-04-25T14:38Z,"Dude, u should stop talking about stuff you don't know, all original scene releases are in Rar-format, so a rar file does not mean fake. Specialy when posted by a Skulled-uploader"
,casper1690,2012-04-25T14:47Z,"extractd with winrar.

,KingNico,2012-04-25T18:23Z,"@casper1690 Its not lazy to ask about quality, you took the time out to post two comments yet you cant post quality, people like you hurt the scene.

That being said A-6 V-7, watchable better than last version, but wait if u can"

                          Read my comment again !!
i said it was Rar files. Question was are they fake.
So i suggest you read things properly before 
you make silly comments."

I must say for this copy it is pretty watchable, definitely would like to see it in better DVD quality, I regret not seeing this at the theater tonight instead of seeing Wrath of the Titans. Thanks uploader, kudos!!! I recommend this copy as the audio and video was really not that bad. Could still make out dark scenes somewhat."
