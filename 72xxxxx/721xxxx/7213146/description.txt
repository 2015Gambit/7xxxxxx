While the hidden object genre has more than its fair share of spooky, creepy offerings, Artifex Mundi hopes that its upcoming Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart turns out to be one of the best. In The Cursed Heart, youΓÇÖll follow the story of an ancient pirate with a forbidden passion. The pirate was cursed and ultimately died, his soul never truly finding rest without the accompaniment of his long-lost love. YouΓÇÖll travel throughout the Caribbean to some dimly lit locals as you try to lift the curse and discover more about this ghostly pirate along the way.

While you can complete The Cursed Heart in traditional hidden object game fashion, exploring the gameΓÇÖs 33 locations and (likely repeatedly) playing its 13 hidden object scenes, you can also switch to a Mahjong-style mini-game if the hidden object scenes just arenΓÇÖt doing it for you. Regardless of your method of choice, youΓÇÖll take items from hotspots and can use them elsewhere in the game, like in its 17 puzzles or mini-games.
