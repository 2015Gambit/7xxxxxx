2012 NewNowNext Awards


Due to popular demand, here are the 2012 NewNowNext Awards!

These files are ripped directly from the streams available on LogoTV.com (though sadly for Americans only). Unfortunately, they split each episode into multiple files and I don't know of a nice way to merge them without losing quality.

For that reason, I have added a playlist.m3u file for easier viewing. Most media players should be able to open it, but if yours doesn't, I recommend using the excellent and free VLC ( http://www.videolan.org/ ).

Enjoy! <3
