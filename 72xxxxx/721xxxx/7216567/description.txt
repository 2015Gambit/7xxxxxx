Sources - UnKnOwN...Thanks :P

Notes -

1st of totally decompressed vid and demuxed audio.. made an avs script for vid to 

denoise then 
dropped that into vdub to denoise a lil more. slight rgb, saturation, levels, 

contrast changes
then just sharpened it up a lil bit.. cleaned audio up a lil bit as was good already 

and then 
just remuxed it back to the encode...... enjoy
