"The Warrior in the Wuss"

The corpse of a truck company 
employee is found in the middle of 
the woods. After the victim's son is 
questioned, Booth and Brennan visit 
his karate class in search of a 
motive. Back at the lab, Hodgins is 
going overboard purchasing lab 
equipment. Then, Booth's son Parker 
returns from England and Brennan is 
apprehensive about how he'll react 
to his new baby sister.
