,cacciatore,2012-04-24T08:38Z,if you're enough not to see this awesome movie at the cinema you can at least wait til the dvdrip comes out.... ALL I'M SAYIN
,Fritz.,2012-04-26T22:35Z,"why would i waste my money on this garbage at a movie theater or wait for a dvd rip?

this movie is awful. the entire thing is one big derivative cliche.... and on top of that its just plagued with poor acting and being a really stupid movie.

peoples standards are abhorrently low to think this is a ""good"" movie in any way.


apparently putting music to CGI = good movie to people these days."
