NOTES:

ok yet another battleship from us lol and i know there will be another one soon aswell after this 

Right this time round we used the german release which is nice but is more cropped than the p76 video we used before and overall probably a worse copy.
However its better than the deep release we had too use for the first 48 mins of all previous releases we've done .
heres some compare shots against the different versions too give you an idea:

deep vs twixx

Rigth we this encode we have opted to stuck too the full german twixx release with no video from another source.
But have clean the video up nicel considering and have also resynced and remastered the 26k audio,which is used on all releases so far ......no cuts needed just needed too line the audio up and do 1 shrink and hey presto insync.
The audio also contains the first 1min off twixx's release aswell as the last few end credit....too make the audio complete.

Have added some before and after shots in the screenies below aswell.

Will there be a v4 .....hell yes,work in progress atm ...muxing the best of the best to make one sweet looking cam.But for now......
