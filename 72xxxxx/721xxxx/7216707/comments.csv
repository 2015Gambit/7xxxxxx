But the reason I split the files is that it is quicker to upload. I just get the 1st half out there as fast as I can and while you guys are downloading that, I prepare the 2nd half and so on.

The other reason is I have limited bandwidth, so smaller files means faster downloads and more seeders quicker. 

If you guys don't like the way I am doing it let me know and I will wait till everything is ready. Which means it will take 1 or 2 extra hours."
