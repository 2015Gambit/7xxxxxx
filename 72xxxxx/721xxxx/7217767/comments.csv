,Manderz,2012-05-08T06:32Z,"The movie itself was actually very good. Yeah it was one of the ""first person amateur"" style movies, but honestly, it wasn't very shaky, and I never got annoyed by it. The download itself was fine, the audio and video were PERFECTLY in-sync and I watched it in Windows Movie thing. So I didn't have to use VLC.
