@CRY/maximersk: h264's main strength is low bitrates, so there's actually not much diff between, say, 695 MB and 350 MB. Not until you drop the video bitrate below 350-400 do you start to see a noticeable drop in quality. I'd also strongly recommend the MP4 package over MKV."
,guanakito100,2012-04-25T05:22Z,dude mp4 really over mkv I think not!! !! mkv files are always better when the uploader knows what he is doing keep up the good work

V:3
Border line A:5, Video is not that great,Kinda dark, not the greatest download. I use VLC and it plays the File Type fine. But most important it's FREE and watchable if you don't want to wait. Maybe a HD Cam will come around soon"
