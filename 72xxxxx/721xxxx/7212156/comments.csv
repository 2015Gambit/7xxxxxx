,Sick3r,2012-04-24T14:20Z,Thanks!!! I'll rate later when I've seen it =)
[V],psspss,2012-04-24T14:53Z,"its very good for a tv to stream rip
bit like last weeks I did.. v 8.5 a 9

93 seeders are fakes also so block them if yoru
seeing other then 100percent on a CA ip"
[V],psspss,2012-04-24T15:16Z,"there however a minor crackling sound in places just noticed while watching on laptop
i think its cos the source rip was too loud and caused clipping.. I always find this with m4a audios in webstreams espc since they use bit rates of like 600kb/s

I found using VLC audio filters.. EQ set it on preset DANCE seems to rid most of it

its worse around father and son segment"
,Sick3r,2012-04-24T15:47Z,"If it's anything like last week there's a straight 10 from me. if people would have the indecency  to complain then fuck em.

""93 seeders are fakes also so block them if yoru

Fakes? o.O Can you block seeders, I don't get it."
,Sick3r,2012-04-24T15:48Z,I'm seeding ~600-1k kb/s right now.
,Sick3r,2012-04-24T15:54Z,Videos fine for stream. Audio is is a bit meh but totally ok. Thanks for the up!
[V],psspss,2012-04-24T15:58Z,"yes you can block any ip.. with tools like peer block or peer guardian

but i block non sharers and bad clients with
utorrents ipfilter.dat google it.. can
copy ip from peer list on utorrent with right click
and add the ips you want to block in the dat file

seeders are normally listed as 100 percent in the peer list tab

sound i would lower to 8 for this one.
the crackling seemed to come about end segment and lasted 5min or so.

no doubt a HDTV ver will come about now I spent a hour ripping and 1 hour or so uploading it LOL :)"
[V],psspss,2012-04-24T16:05Z,"some always moan or hate :/ i rather see it then not at all.. no guarantee a capper did it 
i suspect HDTV and 720p or mp4 lovers should avoid my up though,, it may cause them to
have a heart failure"
[V],psspss,2012-04-24T16:14Z,cappers i mean scene cappers.. they only release HD rips even though they might have a analog tv rip or vhs they wouldnt release it.. I release any source I can find basically
,Random-User,2012-04-24T17:03Z,Thanks for the up dude.
,kitekid,2012-04-24T18:50Z,cheers muchly fella :o)
[V],psspss,2012-04-25T00:53Z,"i was right.. 5-6 hours after my upload 
scene 720p is out now

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7212785/American.Chopper.Senior.vs.Junior.S03E10.720p.HDTV.x264-aAF"
[V],psspss,2012-04-25T00:56Z,"is the 720p a real hdtv source this time?
last time turned out to be tvrip and wordse
aspect or source then mine"
,ONT_Man,2012-04-25T09:34Z,"audio 6 
video 8

Constant crackling in the audio, and at full screen the video was quite pixelated. "
,mars696969,2012-04-25T12:46Z,cheers as always bro love ya work :) +1
[V],psspss,2012-04-25T14:42Z,"dont people read above.. (how to rid the
crackle and how to sharpen the picture
use VLC cideo sharpener.. really males a big difference!)

I didnt bother makign a xvid of the hdtv sources
i let some do that.

tvrips /pdtv = always pixelised

as per above comment. "
,macwtf,2012-04-27T03:47Z,"First of all, thanx for the up.
Quality is fine.

Just a quick point, on wiki this episode is listed as E9.
Think the PJD Camaro build, which has gone up as E7, was actually a special, throwing out the episode numbering.
No biggie but I thought I'd mention it  "
,mars696969,2012-04-27T11:00Z,"came back to comment on quality 

v 9
a 9
i didnt get any of the problems that people are bitching about i used a usb stick in my hdtv and it was perfect ..... to all the people bitching rip it yourself then!!!

cheers bro ;)"
