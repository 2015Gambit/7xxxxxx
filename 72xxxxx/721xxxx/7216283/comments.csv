,roaduck,2012-04-28T12:30Z,"This little proggy is the best one of it's ilk I've ever tried.I used to use Orbit downloader but it was bloated, buggy and had tentacles and usage files all over my HDD.

The other similar streaming grabbers were no good for a variety of reasons and this is reliable and gives consistent results every time.

    This thing, unlike Orbit and fastest tube doesn't even need the file to be playing to grab it, it does it direct from the main site's upload server plus it's faster than them both combined.

It also captures anything and everything, blocks adverts, is easy to turn on and off and additionally  is configurable to dl something once without duplicates.

In a word - Brilliant.Try it and see for yourselves."
