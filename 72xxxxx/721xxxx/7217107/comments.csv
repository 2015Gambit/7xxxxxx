,W_Irizarry,2012-04-30T15:46Z,"After hearing your issues with sims3packs, I've done some research and testing.  What I have come to find out is that The Sims 3 Launcher can only install so many sims3packs.  I think it is a glitch with the game, however, there is a certain point where you install sims 3 packs, load the game, open the launcher, and not all of them are installed.  It's a pain in the butt.  But what I have found is that it is easier to load the store items as package files and load the worlds as sims3packs.  I hope this helps.

I have released a newer torrent which includes sims3packs and package files, and I have also included the India Inspirations Collection for April.  It also contains some pretty neat mods for the game if you wish to use them.  Check it out.  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7227228/Sims_3_Store_Full_June_2009_-_April_2012_Sims3Packs___Packages__#filelistContainer"
