Greetings!  This is the ONLY complete listing for The Sims 3 store items from June 2009 - April 2012.  Included is ALL Sims3Pack files, as well as package files broken down into months.  Pick your poison.  Install Sims3Packs through the Launcher or put package files into the Sims 3 folder.  Included is the framework to set up package files to work for your game.  Simply read the Read Me file to learn how.

I have included an Excel worksheet that I put together with the files that are included in each month.  I have also color coded it to tell you if the file is included or if I could not track it down.

Again, this is ONLY the store content, not the game.  The read me file I've included will specify how to install the files.
