Red Dirt Girl shows a new side of Harris as she branches out musically and goes places she has never gone before, but the essential elements stay the same. It keeps the qualities that make her albums into old friends, that uniquely gorgeous voice and the profound, thoughtful lyrics. The album runs like a musical autobiography in which Harris opens up her soul and invites every listener to jump inside and feel her heartaches and her joy. Emmylou Harris has given us yet another album that is close to her own heard and is offering us yet another invitation to step in and look around at the walls of her soul.
