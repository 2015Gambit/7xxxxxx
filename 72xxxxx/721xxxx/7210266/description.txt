bad info traslation,
Another representative of the generation northeastern after-tropicalismo, that he had in Pa┬Ébir┼¢, of Squid CΓäórtes and Z┼╜ Ramalho, its more radical expression. Also pernambucano, Flaviola and the Flock of the Sun recorded only one album, launched for the Solar local stamp, in 1974. On the basis of regional rhythms, had rare produced a mix of folk-rock-psicodelia, that remains with the extreme present time. Rich instrument, in the base of violΓÇ║es, violas, guitars, flutes and percussion. Basically acoustic, with an uneven poetry, the record is plus an example of the energy, of the will of crair something new, that it abundava in Recife. A comparison with the English of "The Incredible String Band" is not of all absurd. They participate of the FlΓÇívio record Lira (the Flaviola), CΓäórtes Squid, Pablo Raphael, Robertinho of Recife, and Z┼╜ of the Flute
