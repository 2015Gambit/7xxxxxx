,buckeye87,2012-04-26T02:59Z,please seed
,sas013,2012-04-26T10:55Z,please seed !!!!!
,sas013,2012-04-26T14:47Z,....nothing happens ...
,Pagan814,2012-04-26T17:31Z,Working on it. Not to sure how to seed. Feel free to help me out.
,Pagan814,2012-04-26T17:39Z,"Ok, I think I got it figured out. I should be seeding now."
,Lbg5656,2012-04-26T21:08Z,Not seedinh
,kvc09,2012-04-27T03:02Z,please when you fix it add nutritional guide and calendar
,Lbg5656,2012-04-27T04:34Z,"Since your fixing it and adding Nutritional guide and te calendar, can you (or someone)please Convert it to M4V format. I think more people, including myself, will get more use out of m4v then avi.  Thanks...."
,valaguur,2012-04-27T09:28Z,it is so slow but it is the only real tapout xt copy available anywhere on the web! i'll keep seeding this for a week after i manage to get it which is prolly going to take a week
,Pagan814,2012-04-27T16:22Z,"Sorry on the speed, I only have DSL."
,buckeye87,2012-04-27T17:05Z,this torrent is facing certain death if people dont seed. 
,Lbg5656,2012-04-29T01:58Z,"Yes. Def certain death. At one point the ETA on my download was 2y 1d. after someone actually finally gets this downloaded,can you post a M4V or MP4 version. I can't cant do conversions. Thanks. "
,valaguur,2012-04-29T13:27Z,had not all videos had ab circuit with them it would have had been much smaller vids. but anyways i'm still sooo grateful
,IrishDiesel,2012-04-29T15:55Z,"Thanks for putting this out there... even if some are being greedy & asking for file format changes. The only thing I'd ask for is the nutritional guide, it's not there in the scans of the calendar & workout guide. +1"
,IrishDiesel,2012-04-29T17:10Z,As for wanting video conversions but being too lazy to do it yourself... look-up Freemake Video Converter & make whatever video format you want it to be. Damn! This is the only Tapout XT set I've seen online anywhere... stop being so picky/bitchy & just do it yourself. If you can't do that then don't complain.
,Lbg5656,2012-04-29T23:18Z,"Irish diesel, 

As for being a drunken moronic Irishmen that is a tuff-talker on the Internet while dispensing advice....
I've tried converting files many times. With various programs. I have yet to figure out a way to do it without quality degradation. if you know, I'm listening. but spare the tough guy act. "
,buckeye87,2012-04-30T04:03Z,any video converter is a good way to go. its easy and the download is free but plan to only use it maybe 3 times after that it will only do 3 minutes of video. however you can convert video files to any format and you can do multiple videos at once but expect it to take awhile. as far as degradation goes you'll most likely have that no matter what. good luck with it.
,valaguur,2012-04-30T08:58Z,many thanks to the uploader 99% at the moment :)
,kzamora,2012-04-30T22:40Z,"the voice and video does not correspond with one another.. :( waited for days but the torrent suck
"
,fsback,2012-04-30T23:56Z,Can you upload ISO version later?
,buckeye87,2012-05-01T00:26Z,kzamora-must just be your player. worked just fine for me. no complaints here. a-10/v-10
,kzamora,2012-05-01T01:23Z,@buckeye87 did you check all the videos? And what player did you use? I use widows media player 
,kzamora,2012-05-01T01:31Z,@buckeye87 did you check all the videos? What player do you use? I use windows media player 
,sas013,2012-05-01T12:34Z,thx for the upload...
,sas013,2012-05-01T22:33Z,"Pagam814
If you have a little time...
Please upload again every dvd in a same picture format... 
Most of them 16:9 but 3-4 in 4:3... 
By the way 
Thx again this upload"
,johnsy35,2012-05-06T00:11Z,This is so slow! At the average speed is going to take me 4 weeks!!  
,IrishDiesel,2012-05-06T03:51Z,"@Lbg5656

If you're too stupid to convert videos or follow the advice given, then why not smash your computer & just STFU? An 8 year old could do the conversion... and if you can't say thanks for what is given by this torrent why not just go away. Noobs need to read a book rather than waste our time."
,buckeye87,2012-05-07T04:21Z,kzamora-i use the player kwik media player that comes with nero. plays almost every video and audio format you can think of. 
,reaganFF,2012-05-07T19:25Z,Thanks for the upload! Downloading now... will seed as long as possible. xo
,Lbg5656,2012-05-11T02:35Z,Irish. You're pathetic. 
,IrishDiesel,2012-05-22T18:27Z,"I'm pathetic? At least I can play the videos & even burn them to DVD without having to cry about it. Either figure out how to do stuff, take the help given or just stfu! Noobs suck ass."
,stan0208,2012-05-23T14:58Z,Thanks a lot!  Not trying to be greedy but do you know where the Nutrition Plan can be found?
,xtvenice,2012-05-28T04:20Z,"Pagan814: Thanks for being the first to upload Tapout XT.  It is better than nothing this is a classic noob rip, here are the problems:
-incorrect aspect ratio on half the videos
-the audio gradually go out of sync 
-wrong video container used (.avi shouldn't be used for x264)
-you only uploaded 2 pages of the documentation

If you can, please upload the DVD's in ISO format along with the missing documentation.  It's going to take longer but once it's uploaded there are tons of people here to seed it."
,bersebuk2k,2012-06-13T15:57Z,yea would be nice if you upload the dvd iso
,supsee,2012-06-14T23:57Z,Thanks for this. I just glimpsed the infomercial this morning. I've set mine to seed 10 times once I have it.
,mrakun,2012-06-20T19:05Z,"These videos are weird.  The video that matches the file name takes up 1/3 to 1/2 of the file, then they repeat halfway, or have parts of other videos mixed in.  For example the workouts are supposed to be about 45 minutes long, but these videos go ab out 2-3 hours long."
,JGSmassacre,2012-06-21T02:44Z,Does anyone know where to get the nutrition plan?
,goober420,2012-06-21T04:04Z,Could you please upload the 10 day slim down guide. I'm thankful for the videos but the other files would be nice
,wisecat74,2012-06-27T04:59Z,"Hey thanks for the upload, I have all my friends doing TapouT XT. It'd be great if we could get the Nutrition Guide and the 10 Day program.

Thanks again,

Wisecat74"
,cbc7063,2012-07-01T17:39Z,is the rst of the documents and 10 day slim down included with this yet?
,cbc7063,2012-07-01T17:57Z,can you upload the rest of the documents and the 10 day slim down please
,Rhythm619,2012-08-03T20:04Z,Thanks for the wonderful upload will seed for the rest of the day! Thanks again!
,Kra3zd,2012-09-03T17:02Z,"Here's the link for Tapout XT full set with PDF. doesn't have the meal plan or slim down guide, so if anyone could help me with that.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7546872/Tapout_XT_Full_Set.ISO.with.PDF-K1

This was my first up under another account name, so be gentle, it's good quality, NEEDS PEOPLE to help SEED.

Next project is to convert to avi, but the software was hella slow. Can anyone suggest any good software to use as I AM a nood:P

Peace. Have fun and enjoy!"
