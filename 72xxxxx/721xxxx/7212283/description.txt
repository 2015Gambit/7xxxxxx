One hour HD documentary uncovering the covert world of codes and codebreaking, from the time of Mary Queen of Scots to the World War Two Enigma machine, this is the complete guide to the science of secrecy. For National Geographic.


Codebreakers is the story of the science behind secrecy- how codes work, what they do and why we need them. But itΓÇÖs not dry or technical, because codebreaking is where science meets adventure- these are great tales of hard thinking, but also heroic risks, cat-and-mouse secrecy and high stakes. We get inside the minds of the code writers and breakers to reveal the skills of the clever yet unsung heroes of this life or death science.


Today codes have become the foundation that underpins our entire globe. Secret information passes every second every day across continents using codes known only to the sender and recipient. Every time you log your computer onto a favourite website, go shopping, use your phone and drive a car, youΓÇÖre using the science of secret codes. And as well as the serious stuff, all over the world, thousands of enthusiasts, professionals and nutters devote their lives to cracking some of the greatest- and strangest- unsolved mysteries concealed in codes.
