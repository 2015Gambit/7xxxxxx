,rishav007,2012-04-29T14:40Z,Hey @eztv .Thanks for all the amazing releases. But I believe many of the your recent releases are slightly incorrect because many have an audio delay of 3.5 seconds when I open them with Media player classic. It's alright when I open them with windows media player. Just wanted to inform you about it.
