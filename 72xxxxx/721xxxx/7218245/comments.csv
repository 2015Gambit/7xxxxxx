,daem83,2012-04-26T20:38Z,last 20 min of the movie quality drops drastically... 
,bismarket,2012-04-27T10:20Z, @ daem83 How bad is it?
,Shinycage,2012-04-27T19:54Z,"Yeh at 1hr 17 secs in, to the end of the movie, the quality drops to virtually unwatchable. Shame."
,Shinycage,2012-04-27T20:01Z,"Yeah at 1hr 17 secsonds in, the quality goes to vitually unwatchable. Shame."
,bismarket,2012-05-05T09:33Z,"Yeah, it is pretty bad, but not unwatchable, i'd like to know what caused it(just out of interest)as it's seems to be what it's claimed(a dvdrip) up to that point?"
,aradiel,2012-06-12T20:27Z,"What caused it is the encode went wrong and no one bothered to check it before it was released. There are other versions, so perhaps those would be better to download than this.

It becomes extremely pixelated. The sound is still fine and it is watchable, but it's pretty bad. Get a version not made by LPD if you can.

I usually don't even bother checking the comments from extremezone's ups, maybe I should have."
