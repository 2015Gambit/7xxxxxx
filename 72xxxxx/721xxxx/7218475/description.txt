    Malcom Crowe is a child psychologist who receives an award on the      
    same night that he is visited by a very unhappy ex-patient. After      
   this encounter, Crowe takes on the task of curing a young boy with      
      the same ills as the ex-patient. This boy "sees dead people".        
    Crowe spends a lot of time with the boy (Cole) much to the dismay      
    of his wife. Cole's mom is at her wit's end with what to do about      
      her son's increasing problems. Crowe is the boy's only hope.
