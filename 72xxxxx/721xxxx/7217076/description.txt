Written by an award-winning researcher and professor whose work straddles the fields of communication
 and healthcare, Talking About Health explores the importance of health communication in the 21st century,
 and how it affects us all.
Organized around six key questions about health and communication:
How ΓÇÿNormalΓÇÖ am I? What are My ΓÇÿRiskΓÇÖ Factors? Why DonΓÇÖt We Get ΓÇÿCareΓÇÖ? Is the Public Good ΓÇÿGoodΓÇÖ for Me? 
Who Profits from My Health? and WhatΓÇÖs Politics Got to Do with It? Provides readers with specific tools which
 which to better navigate the healthcare system Translates what we know about communication and health into 
useful guidelines for everyday practice Includes discussions of politics and healthcare, genetic testing, and 
alternative care.

Now Americans are not so confident. Surveys show that health care is the number one concern among voters
 today.  The cry for Federal legislation to protect patientsΓÇÖ rights reflects a growing anxiety about
 qualityΓÇöfear that we wonΓÇÖt get the care we need when we need it.

And researchers have confirmed that our fears are valid. The quality of health care in this country is
 not ideal: quality varies widely across health plans and providers. Many procedures and therapies are
 used too often while others are not used often enough. No institution or office is free from errors. 
And these problems are pervasive. Although most of the information we have comes from managed care

 organizations, we now see that quality is uneven throughout the industryΓÇönot only in health plans,
 but also in physiciansΓÇÖ offices, nursing homes, hospitals, and home health care agencies.

What makes this National anxiety especially powerful is how little we really know. We may be aware
 that some health plans and some providers deliver poor quality care, but the real issue for people 
is much more personal. What about my health plan? How good is my doctor? How do I choose among the 
options available to me?
