,pwnt_soup,2012-04-27T21:18Z,"thanks for the UP, I have WHS and this WHS2011 and honestly unless you are well versed in server 2008rc2, your better off with WHS. there are much more add ins for WHS and its much easier to setup and admin, as well as drive pool. Microsoft really goofed with WHS2011."

[T],prathaprabhu,2012-04-29T03:57Z,"That's the most interesting thing created by Microsoft ever when comparing other programs.

Here is how you can find out. For ex.
en = English
da = Danish and so on.

Cheers"
