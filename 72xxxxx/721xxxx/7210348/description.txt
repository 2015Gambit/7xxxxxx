This is my first attempt at a torrent so hope it works!!


Ghost Dances is a production by the UK's Rambert Dance Company and choreographed by Christopher Bruce.  This was recorded from TV in the 1990s.

And apologies for the quality.  It is watchable but is a conversion from a VHS video.  As Ghost Dances doesn't seem to be available anywhere else, I thought it was worth uploading it.

This is a .avi file.  I am not technical so don't ask for any specific details on codecs etc!


Hopefully more people will seed this as I don't have internet at home and can only seed when I'm online.  Be patient!
