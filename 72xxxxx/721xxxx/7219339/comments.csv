,skum361,2012-05-07T22:36Z,"i actually installed maple 16 but get confused when we have to move the licence file and the lib maple file! i was wondering when do we actually move it? before or after installation? and where exactly? also also i am being told that invalid licence! 
anyone please could you guide me step by step? please!"
,SirBlanton,2012-05-12T08:47Z,"Thanks a lot for sharing!

& for the other commenter:
/Library/Frameworks/Maple.framework/Versions/14/license is where license file goes after installation for Maple 14 before one can use it."
,stu_douglas,2012-09-18T20:33Z,"You move the files after it is installed, but before opening it. @purpleninja, i dont know what terminal stuff youre talking about, could you clarify? because after working well for several days, it has now discovered my license isn't valid, and will not work. "
