The first 20 minutes are kind of rough.  It was the feed, not me...  

Just because it says "no seeds," doesn't mean there aren't any.

My max upload is 50K/sec. Sorry. It's all I've got. Slow torrent is better than no torrent. Please seed. 

I can only seed each upload for a day or or two.  I have too many competing priorities.  Please keep seeding.
