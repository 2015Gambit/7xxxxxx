,Woodzta,2012-04-24T23:56Z,"45 minutes it took for me to get 20%, that's due to one kind seeder and a couple of others.

I gave up and grabbed it from a different (partially private) tracker in 12 minutes. Everything else, this is great. Torrents in demand... the leeching is ridiculous. -.-"
,kevx74,2012-04-25T00:37Z,"S4A's quality is always good if not great, but after downloading for over 6 hours and only having 20% done I'm cutting my losses and letting the leechers have it."
