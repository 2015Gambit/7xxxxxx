WTF are you talking about. You're own torrent about TiĂŤsto is fucking fake and you're calling this trusted member a liar? There is nothing wrong with this. "
,goodguyswannabeme,2012-04-27T00:08Z,"Sorry to say, but some of the songs are indeed faster. Just compare song lengths with beatport. Paradise is supposed to be 4:44, not 3:54."
,Magneasiest,2012-04-27T01:10Z,"k guys it's called mixing, when you mix a 128 bpm and a 125 bpm there is gonna be a slower and a faster song. and second the beatport versions includes the intro and the outro, Tiesto mixed it him self. the people excluding the uploader are dip shits."
,JustSomebody,2012-04-27T02:29Z,Their seems nothing wrong with the quality but these songs don't have the right length to be songs of the DJ TiĂŤsto - Club Life Volume 2 Miami album. The title and artist are right but these are probably the unmixed songs. The complete length of the music in this torrent (all songs together) is 1 hour and 34 minutes. But the total play time on the album is 1 hour and 14 minutes (source: http://www.amazon.com/Club-Life-Volume-2-Miami/dp/B007NCTFJ0).
