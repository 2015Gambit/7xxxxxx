Kim Walker-Smith, Chris Quilala, and Melissa How were worship leaders at Bethel Church's youth group, and are the core of the Jesus Culture Band. Jesus Culture states the purpose of music in their movement is to "ignite revival in the nations of the earth...compel the Body of Christ to radically abandon itself to a lifestyle of worship, motivated by a passion to see God receive the glory that is due His name..." and to "encounter His extravagant love and raw power."
