Playing around with wrapping programs with wine the other night, came across this post and decided to do a port to OSX.

Now, this is an *alpha* release, the interface can be slow at times but it all seems to be loading nicely and the most important part is there doesn't seem to be any delay in the market prices 

Screenshot attached!

Anyway, mad props to RobinHood, I will shortly be experimenting with different wine builds etc and with any luck I'll be able to cobble something together to rival the Windows counterpart. It's very mahoosive (~700MB!) at the moment.
