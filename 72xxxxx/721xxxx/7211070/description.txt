'Last Chance Driving School' is a half-hour real-life series that follows Sven Ruppaner and his crew as they take on disoriented, despondent and downright dangerous student drivers.

Sven and his team of driving instructors have just a short while to turn their flustered pupils into safe and sensible drivers, with newfound confidence to take on the unpredictable and accident-prone streets of New York.


All the near misses and accidents taped along the way guarantee a nail-biting driving experience, so buckle-up and prepare for some of the worst drivers ever.
