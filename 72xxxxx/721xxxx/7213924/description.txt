Mama's Milk is the debut release for both Gibbons and the Sluts and for their label, Miedlena Records. It was recorded at the casa de Angelopes, a live/work space in Inglewood where Gibbons and Mateo built a studio. It was recorded on Γö¼Γò£-inch tape by Bones and mixed to Γö¼Γò¥-inch by Revered Ben Mook. It is a short record, coming in at just over 23 minutes in length. However, Mama's Milk clearly bears the depth of a full length album. It was put to tape in sequence, with even the studio noise in between tracks carefully considered. There are abstract characters and repeated themes at work throughout the album, suggesting an operatic vision. Also it drops like dubstep.
