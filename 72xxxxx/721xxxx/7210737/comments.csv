[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-24T02:02Z,They both do the same thing mate. Neither are faster or slower (that I notice). But I have no control whether the green arrow options appear or not. That is a Pirate Bay thing. I would get used to using the Magnet links as that is what will no doubt eventually be your only option to download stuff from this site. My torrent will always be slow to start with until there are seeds on it. This is because I cannot upload any faster than 80kb/s.
