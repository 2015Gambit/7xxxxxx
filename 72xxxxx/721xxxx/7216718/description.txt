

One pirate complained that I did not give any program information with the uploads. That maybe a fair comment, but I always give the name the name of the program and the channel that it was broadcast on. If you ΓÇ£googleΓÇ¥ that, you will usually find all the information that you need.

  

I wanted to give something back for all the downloads that I took over the last few years, so I started to upload interesting programs, mostly from BBC2 and BBC4, that nobody else uploads. I have time to do that because I am quite badly disabled, and can seldom leave the house. 

 

I am almost blind, and I have many physical problems that make it difficult for me to use a keyboard, so I donΓÇÖt  give information that able bodied pirates can easily find out for themselves !!

 

But your comments are appreciated, so please leave them, good or bad  !!
