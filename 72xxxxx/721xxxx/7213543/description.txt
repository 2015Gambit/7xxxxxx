Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, April 24 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Lew Rockwell. Mr. Rockwell served as Ron Paul's congressional chief of staff from 1978 to 1982. He was a contributing editor to The Ron Paul Investment Letter and worked as a consultant to Paul's 1988 Libertarian Party campaign for president. Lew founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute where the Journal of Libertarian Studies is published. He is the author of Speaking of Liberty and The Left, The Right, and The State. 

Alex covers the Big Brother transportation bill ready to go forward this week and the latest TSA outrage.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
