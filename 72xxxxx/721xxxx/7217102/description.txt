This torrent contains volumes 1-27 of Lekturama's Luister Sprookjes en Vertellingen, the Dutch edition of Story Teller - A Collection of the World's Best Children's Stories by Marshall Cavendish.
This torrent couldn't have been done without the help of lothorian, who had uploaded cbr files of Luister Sprookjes en Vertellingen on 4shared.
I converted the files to jpeg images using winrar, and the jpeg files to pdf.
Each folder contains the jpeg images as well as the pdf file (named binder 1,2,3 etc.) 
The audio for this torrent will probably be uploaded next week.
