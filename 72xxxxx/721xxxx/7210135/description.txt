Welcome to Planet Momoko, a prison full of tests and illusions! Mission Sirius ΓÇô a FPS (First-Person Shooter) game powered by Unreal Engine 3 that gets your blood pumping!

Roger ΓÇô A prisoner? A lone ranger? Unveil the secrets of Momoko and you will be fighting an army alone.

All are but tests!

Video Camera Following Mode makes it easier to operate without a mouse or a keyboard. There are only two operations: aim and shoot, and reload. The game shows a number of extraordinary scenes: in the open air of a planet, the sky, the ground, the underground, the military base, enemies attacking from all directions like flood. You will operate all kinds of weapons ranging from high-focusing laser guns and fast-shooting photonic submachine guns to mass-destructive heavy machine guns.

All are but illusions!

Mission Sirius is like a motion picture and animation makes the whole game an action movie. You will have different choices at various scenes, only to find out in the end what the illusions and tests really mean. The latest video-audio technology used in the game ensures the fluency of the pictures. Even if a group of enemies appear out of nowhere, you will still be able to keep shooting smoothly. 

What you will be dealing with is No Ordinary Army!

Maybe the lowest form of life has no brain and would only attack out of instinct. But when you are eager to find out the hidden secrets of Momoko, the real opponents--the mercenary troops, will show you who you will be dealing with. You make the tiniest mistakes in fight formation, teammate cover-ups or tactical strikes and you may be killed on Planet Momoko.

What exactly is Mission Sirius? The mystery is waiting for you to solve.
