RELEASE NOTES

The year is 2027. The world as we know it is unraveling after fifteen
years of economic meltdown and widespread global conflict over
dwindling natural resources.

A once proud America has fallen, her infrastructure shattered and
military in disarray. Crippled by a devastating EMP strike, the USA is
powerless to resist the ever expanding occupation of a savage, nuclear
armed Greater Korean Republic.

Abandoned by her former allies, the United States is a bleak landscape
of walled towns and abandoned suburbs. This is a police state where
high school stadiums have become detention centers, and shopping malls
shelter armored attack vehicles. A once-free people are now prisonersÂ…
or collaboratorsÂ… or revolutionaries.

Features:
>> Discover a terrifyingly plausible near-future world - the familiar has
become alien in this nightmare vision of Occupied USA
>> Fight for a cause - join a cast of memorable characters as your
resistance cell wages a guerrilla war against overwhelming military
odds in the name of Freedom
>> Witness the human cost of war - a gripping story from the pen of John
Milius is told through immersive, interactive 1st person cut scenes
