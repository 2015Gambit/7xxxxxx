,wizzard4all,2012-04-26T02:56Z,"Thank you extremezone! It's refreshing to see SOME people still put up a quality release, instead of using any crap source to be the ""first"".
Keep up the VERY good work, my man!"
[H],NZPirate,2012-04-26T06:43Z,Thanks...
,gratefulforthis,2012-04-26T23:03Z,"Shit...just realised this is an EZ one.

His downloads are always the slowest out there. Basically due to you mongs not seeding.

Haculus' download fast as fuck."
[T],immagical,2012-04-29T13:43Z,"@gratefulforthis,  speed has nothing to do with the uploader when there are loads of seeds..  check your isp @gratefulforthis if you have slow speed..  he uploads movie, he doesnt controll your internet speed.. lol"
,gratefulforthis,2012-04-30T03:13Z,"@immagical You don't say? lol

I know how it works, man. Did you read the bit that said ""Basically due to you mongs not seeding.""? 

No? Didn't think so.

EZ distributes the best copies but his followers are selfish dicks who NEVER seed what they take without sharing. Anti-torrent.

Anyways:

A:8
V:8
M:8

Was well surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. Worth the download (albeit slow)."
[T],immagical,2012-05-01T12:19Z,"@gratefullness..ye man,,  i did read that bit.;)  

 i had one of those ""take it personal"" days,  ""when ya said mongs..  :)lol

but ye, i know what you mean, when there about 100 seeders with speed turned of.. then when they get the hole movie they just run and don't seed the torrent back::( 

But ye good A-V quality movie this.  10/10"
,gratefulforthis,2012-05-01T14:45Z,@immagical: Thumbs up! :)
,gmacor2,2012-07-08T11:07Z,Another quality torrent. Thank you. I am seeding.
,schlierkamp,2012-08-02T07:26Z,ty ez. looks like an awesome movie from the trailer. I always seed everything 1:1 or more. and usually give thanks for the uL before I even finish dLing =)
