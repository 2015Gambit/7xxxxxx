,PoppaChubbie,2012-04-29T09:11Z,"Thanks for the upload Azaq but how to change player name? I renamed the default player in the config file and put my name in the launcher but the game still calls me azaq. No offence but I don't want to play as ur name, I want my own."
,PoppaChubbie,2012-04-29T09:16Z,"The setting is probably in C:Users""username""AppDataLocalSKIDROW but which subfolder? I have 28 of them and no idea which one. Any help is appreciated."
