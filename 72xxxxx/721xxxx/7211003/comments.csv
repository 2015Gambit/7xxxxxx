,johnski8,2012-04-24T15:13Z,"No problem libertaswv :) I will keep uploading the ep's as long as people want them. I really need you guys to seed for as long as possible, as my up speed is very limited."
,libertaswv,2012-04-24T22:33Z,"Definitely will - I have to seed a couple of other things for at least one more day or so (promised to seed them until my share rate hit 20 and i'm almost at 18) and then i can download/start seeding DwtS AU. 

I'm planning on seeding the first 6 eps at least... Might run into space problems past that, but if i can do more when the time comes i will. I'll seed indefinitely - Won't take them off until they go for at least a month without anyone touching them. Thanks again! :)"
,libertaswv,2012-04-27T23:14Z,seeding now bro
,libertaswv,2012-05-14T22:51Z,"I'm at 30 gigs + now, and the number of downloaders has dropped considerably over the past 3 or 4 days. It looks like johnski has decided to defer to the TvTeam seeds of this season. Perfectly understandable w/ speed/bandwidth issues. 

As the s12e2 TvTeam seed is currently healthy (though personally i prefer johnski's smaller, perfectly good qual encode), i'm going to drop this to make room for stuff that isn't as well supported. 

Thanks for making sure it got up'ed when no one else was doing so, johnski! :)"
,johnski8,2012-05-25T15:39Z,"Thanks for your support libertaswv :) I only started uploading this series because no one else was initially doing so. I am deferring to the TvTeam guys to handle the future uploads of DWTS, mainly due to my limited up speed."
