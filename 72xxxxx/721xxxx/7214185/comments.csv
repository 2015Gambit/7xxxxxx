massive thanks sceneline, P&R isn't broadcasted in my own country, without peope like you i couldn't follow this show

one question  i thought the original airdate was 
26-04, so how did you get this so early, for the people who are doubting downloading this it's the real deal !


thanks again, love this show my favorite show ever.
