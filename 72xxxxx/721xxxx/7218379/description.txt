[Orgasms.] Morgan (Take Me / 16.09.12)



Since the birth of her son some years ago Morgan has been in a loveless marriage, the deteriorating relationship with her ever-distant husband has left her feeling lonely and unattractive. A chance encounter with a past-love in her apartment building fills her once more with desire, the desire to be lusted after, the desire to feel like a sexual being, and the desire to be taken by a man.
Martin was Morgan's first love at a time in their lives when they were young and free, nothing mattered and they didn't carry the weight of responsibility that comes with adulthood. When she sees him on the stairway the memories come flooding back, she has to suppress her desire to kiss him and hold him. Secretly, she wishes he would just take her then and there.
