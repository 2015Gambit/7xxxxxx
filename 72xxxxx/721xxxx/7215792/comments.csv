,TedDekker,2012-04-25T18:16Z,"TorrentTracts! You are my Hero! Man it has taken me forever to leave this comment because I had issues joining because of my IP being flagged as spam or something by accident! I love your torrents so much. I have so much Christian music myself before I even found your torrents that I would think that I could never add to it. I was mistaken! I have so much more now because of you. I might have some requests later if you do not mind because I have seen you honor some. One particular I wouldn’t mind getting is everything by the rapper “Pettidee” I do not think you have uploaded him yet.

I have everything on vineyard if you need that. I mean every single TFH, all the originals on CD’s. Very rare. I can’t believe you had a nice package yourself.

I still can’t believe I can finally leave you a comment it is all thanks to “velvetfog” on the pirate bay forum website taking the time to look into my account! Thanks velvetfog!

Well TorrentTracts I really look forward to all of your future uploads and I know in my heart you are doing truly the right thing! God bless you man and have a wonderful life! Let’s stay in touch! "
