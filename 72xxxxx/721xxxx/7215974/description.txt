Dead Famous (xvids) - UK Paranormal Series (2004-2006) - Season 3 E01-E06 Collection 1 of 2 

This is the first of 2 parts of the collection which will cover
Season 4 and Live Specials.. which are tvrips with some web stream rips
assembled and tweaked to xvid formats

there is now DVDrip of S01 and S02 with extras on demon
which you will need to grab separately to complete the series

Help to seed if grabbing.. once this one is seeded out
and can share Collection 2 of 2

enjoy

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
===================================
Ps/3 , phone and xbox users may consider grabbing
the free tool umile encoder 3.1.1.2 it can convert
to most devices to make compatible in 8mins
on dual core or higher. as some of my converts may
fail for certain devices.. you will need a pc to run it
though. no link just google it..
