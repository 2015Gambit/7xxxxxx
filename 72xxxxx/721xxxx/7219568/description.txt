V1.1 of http://boompje.net/ 's iLoL client

Not claiming any credit for this, just didn't see an updated torrent file up on here.

From their website:



Almost 3 months ago, Drakulix started writing his own native launcher. Right now, he set it in place along with a Wine wrapper for the game client. Although the client works for now, keep in mind that it can break every patch! This is why we suggest to play one or two custom games before starting to play any match made game after the deploy of a patch. 

The iLoL client makes use of the Wine technology. Be aware that your performances might drop compared to the old Riot Mac client and the Boompje Edition.
