not too bad considering the ratio of seeders to leechers.
will give a a/v/m once i finish watching the movie.
(version 4 so already better than the others)
will seed for a good amount of time.
give my thanks to the people that helped put this together"

Quite Watchable.

Text at the beginning reads:
En 2005 los cientificos descubrieron un planeta distante con un clima casi identico al de la tierra

En 2006 la nasa construyo un aparato de transmision cinco veces mas potente que los existentes hasta la fecha, dando comienzo a un programa para contactar con dicho planeta

Lo llamaron ""proyecto beacon""

Google translate says it means:

In 2005, scientists discovered a distant planet with a climate almost identical to that of the earth.

In 2006, NASA built a transmission apparatus five times more powerful than exists to date, kicking off a program to contact the planet

They called it ""Project Beacon"""
,TrustyRuss463,2012-04-28T07:58Z,"Picture is pretty good, audio is quite horrible, movies itself was one of the worst I've ever seen."

,kenshinsars,2012-04-28T20:57Z,"V:5.5 
A:3 (you WILL need subtitles to understand whats being said)"
,Daeshan,2012-04-29T13:03Z,"Not too bad of a copy,
the screening changes halfway through, so i'll review for use for both halfs
1st half:
a7 v8 (pretty solid, bit of laughing but very watchable)
2nd half:
a5 v6 (more blurry but overall less background noise, its more colourful and brighter)

if youre using VLC player you should be fine.
if youre into the movie the video change wont be a problem really.
GREAT WORK HeroMaster!"
