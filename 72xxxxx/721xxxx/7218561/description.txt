  Game information:
=================

  Pole Position 2012 will put your manager skills to the test by putting  you 
  in charge of your Formula 1 racing team. It's your responsibility not  only 
  to buy spare parts, but also to design the car and to recruit  the  members 
  of your team. And then, you have to decide which training sessions are  the 
  most appropriate for your pilots.

  Pole Position 2012 offers you more features than ever in a Formula 1 racing 
  team management simulation. The whole technology tree was revised from  the 
  ground up and you have  to  pick  your  own  research  from  over  100  new 
  technology projects. The team management system is easier  to  use  and  is 
  even more interesting. And even when it comes to your own satisfaction, you 
  can make your dreams come true and get a sports car,  a  villa  or  even  a 
  private jet plane. But it doesn't matter how you build  your  racing  team, 
  your goal is always the same: make the right choices, pick the right people 
  and win the World Championship!
