,CODEX911,2012-04-29T17:48Z,"@Shepard76  
since shevchenko's removed goal for no reason @ all followed by leeman gived an unright redcard in the finale , and what happend with chelsea in 09 made it obvious to the world ! i didn't believe this kind of things but after what happend to CH (and note that i don't like this team what so ever though i watched it @ the time because of balack ) it made it clear & even later i started to focus on barca games it was all by luck with refs wrong dicessions ! arsenal won the first & @ the second leg they were 1-1 but suddenly the ref gave a redC to RVP for no fuckin reason what so ever ! and of course the team of youngsters collapsed ! then with rmadrid @ the very same season pepe got red without even touching alves ! and that doesen't always works with barca as in the season before with inter though busqets dived and the ref gave inter's player a false red again but barca couldn't make it this way this just like what happend this year with chelsea though the ref also gave them a false penaltie to fix the score and in the replay u can see clearly that fabregas wasen't even touched ! & even @ this years milan-barca milan scored the tie & there was no way in hell they would of score back when milan plays with there cantaniaho but suddenly a joke of a false penalty was given to barcelona !! & right @ the begining of the second half a clear penalty for ibra but the ref didn't count it !! as i look @ other big teams things like this dosen't happend with them at all , maybe once in their history or once in 20yrs or somethin in that case only it could be called mistakes , but every time & constantly , it's crystal clear !! & when i look to other big teams games i don't see any of that hapening with them for example none of this happend with milan-arsenal or bayern-madrid or chelsea-napoli for example & even sometimes i watch some games of la ligua were there is barca seriously what the fuck !! the little teams r being injusted but it looks like people in spain r used to this & think this is football !! in bundesligua u will never hear in ur wildest dreams accusations about ref being sided ! watch the bundesligua & then u will know why ! u see it's bad to see ur team loosing but then its a 1000 time better to know they lost because they sucked then they lost because of an outside hand ! and to deny that ref r sided with barca its either ur blind or laying to ur self !! & i mean no disrespect for u but beating madrid was my teams achievement not barca's 
& it's because i believe right now  we r the best in the world & if it were barca in the finale & not chelsea we would of taken them down ! & i don't like it when i see somebody braging with someone else's achievement's i'm sorry but it's humane's nature !  "
[T],Shepard76,2012-05-01T01:45Z,"Had enough of this shit. I stop seeding. Sorry for the rest of you downloading this.  
Codex911 jut read a little about history, about relationship between Spain and Catalonia since ancient times, read a little about Franco's dictatorship, about his determination of anihilate catalan culture, language and even people during our sad Civil War (1936-1939) . "
[T],Shepard76,2012-05-01T01:48Z,". Read a little about that...and maybe only maybe you'll understand why I am so glad that Real Madrid is eliminated of this champions league.
I'd prefer a non german team to do that but at least Madrid is out.  You're not catalan, you can't understand that feeling. That's why we say Barsa is more than a club. We are catalans fighting for our right to exist and not be wiped from the map.  And if Barsa were in the final with Bayern we will crash you down so hard, Messi, Iniesta, Xavi would have been  rape you so hard you wouldn't remember the name of your club.  "
,CODEX911,2012-05-01T03:45Z,"first of all i finished downloading long ago , so u r being an asshole because the others downloading have nothing to do with my personal openiens , & i know all about the catalan , franco used madrid & the madridista have nothing to do with him , & whatever happend 80yrs ago doesen't give the right to barca to cheat their way to the top , & acutally these racisme things looks like they'r still in spain , i mean r we in the middle ages ?? ur happy because a team of spain ""assuming that ur spanish"" lost by a foreign team ?? i mean do u even call ur self a spanish ?? why do u separate ur self from the rest of spain ?? and in munich we have a saying ""MIA SAN MIA"" we r we , and proud as we r , we build our owen way to the top , a never use any dirty trick , we don't even play ruff like the other European teams , we don't get other teams captains for millions or someone for 90m , we build our owen players right now we have 7 starters from the bayern academy , we succeded in becoming one of the biggest greatest teams in history by depending on our selfs not money not ref not old crappy political bullshit not dirty play in the field , we know our selfs & proud of who we r & don't need to proof anything to anyone ! & about rape seriously ?? u mean like u've got rapped fiew days ago from 10 players & by a striker who can't score !!! though the reff was on ur side !! & few days before that got raped by ur nemesis madrid !! & wich caused ur cowerd manager to fleet right away while a few months ago he told the board that he's renewing soon !! and if u acutally put foot on munich finale the team would of made barca curse the day they decided to put foot their !! and the farca fags that would their put their foots near the allianz arena , would be raped before they even get in by the true Bavarians , because we don't accept fags & sissies & divers fans in their !! oh and schweinsteiger-kroos-ribery would of made a joke out of ur fags thriple if they happend to meat soon ! & i will look for u to remind u if they ever happend to meat ! "
[T],Shepard76,2012-05-01T11:04Z,You can bet I'll remind you too when Bayern play again with Barcelona. Prepare your ass you nazi piece of shit.
[T],Shepard76,2012-05-01T11:23Z,Iniesta- Xavi- Messi a fag thriple ? You are not more idiot cause you don't practice more for being an idiot. Do you really think that a prostitute customer like Ribery can even compete with Iniesta or Xavi ? Who's Kroos?  And tell Swatchenager to change his name so the rest of the world can pronounce it.
