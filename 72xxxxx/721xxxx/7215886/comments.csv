All content from iTunes is in 720p, so everybody with 1080p stuff is either upscaled or ripped from the TV airing, which arguably has degraded quality. Great torrent, but more seeds are needed. I'll seed as much as I can."

,jrharbort2,2012-05-01T21:57Z,"Absolutely perfect torrent, exactly what I was looking for. Untouched 720p rips and the original Derpy episode. I'll seed this to at least a 2.0 ratio. Nice job!"
,raki-chan,2012-07-07T04:51Z,Need more seed! Please! Thanks! :D
,slnln,2012-07-09T08:46Z,And now to seed indefinitely...
,raki-chan,2012-07-18T17:42Z,"Anyone seeding? I've been stuck at 70% for several days now!
Please keep seeding! Thanks! :D"
