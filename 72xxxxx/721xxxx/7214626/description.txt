The first nitroblu upload!

Unofficial Glee: The Music, The Complete Season Two album.

Songs are all complete and in the right order, as they appeared in each EPISODE. If it didn't appear in an episode, or it did but was never released as a single, it is not included. Similar in formatting to the first season's complete album. Christmas episode only has songs which appeared in episode (ie. I didn't copy and paste the entire Christmas album in).

File name and tags are all formatted in a consistent style, comment free. All songs are tagged with my OWN custom album art which I created for this album. Please seed and say thanks if you like!
