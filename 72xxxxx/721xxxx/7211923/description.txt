MARDEK is an epic Flash RPG in the style of NES and SNES RPGs, like the early Final Fantasy games. It is highly story-driven, featuring a setting that merges swords-and-sorcery Fantasy with sci-fi. It will be eight chapters long.
This is the second chapter. Eight years have passed since the events of chapter 1, and Mardek and Deugan have joined the Royal Guard of Goznor!
