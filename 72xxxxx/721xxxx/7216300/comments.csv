About 80% of the movies that i have downloaded is from your account. All your movies are having A=9 & V=9 ratings.
Could you please put the movies ""Red Tails"" & ""Chronicle"". These movies were released in Jan & Feb 2012. And all the torrents of these movies are CAM prints in piratebay.

Thank you

redbull "
