Many thanks"

i can only find med books in pdf,i dont think that the kindle will show pictures or drawings."
,bjmassni,2012-04-25T01:35Z,"MABY, it sure does seem like we have similar tastes, I actually have never read this author, but someone recommended him to me, so I figured I would try him out. Who else do you read? Some of my favorites are Deaver, Finder, Coben, Preston/Child, Hurwitz, Connelly."
,slychenko,2012-04-25T23:42Z,"thanks, fot checking kk. i tried too but i could only find in pdf."
