Ok so i must have bought this CD about 5 times now but keep losing it due to moving house or someone nicking my disc etc. Could not find a single place to legally download it (eBay to the rescue) so you know what, here it is for any other random people hunting it down. It's all about track 4, the Moonmen's Theme, which is 11 odd minutes of crack in audio form, but for the sake of permanent archiving here's a lossless rip of the entire CD single.
