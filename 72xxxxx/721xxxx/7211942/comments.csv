,wthrman,2012-04-28T06:46Z,"I got fooled too...up until the point where the website said I needed to click on an advertisement to get the password. How stupid does this fucker think we are?

@polaris71301: Is there really a way we could ask TPB for his IP so we could attack this piece of shit's computer? He doesn't seem to swift, so I doubt he took any steps to fake/hide his IP."
,wthrman,2012-04-28T06:52Z,@terminal_disease: Probably not too many because the number of seeders has rapidly dropped by over 90% since this guy uploaded this.
