"Fascinating collection of three visual books that feature jaw-droppingly gorgeous 3D CG renderings of RX-178 Gundam Mk-II Titans, MSN-00100 Hyakushiki, and MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam, each featured in their own separate 32-page book. The staff involved in producing the "Gundam Evolve" short films lent a hand in creating the high-quality 3D CG renderings of the three mobile suits specifically for this Gundam MS Graphica collection. The 3D CG renderings are used to visualize the short stories told in each book."
