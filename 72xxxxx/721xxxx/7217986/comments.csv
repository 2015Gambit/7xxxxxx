,StarfireWolf,2012-04-28T06:34Z,The games was great til I got to where you have to get the pollen from the plant in the glass vial. Then it crashes every time. And I tried six times. Deleting the game now.
,Malyne,2012-05-09T21:27Z,Same thing happens to me. Can you tell me why it shuts down when I go to get the pollen?
