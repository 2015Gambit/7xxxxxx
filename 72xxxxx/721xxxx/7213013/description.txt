Hotei is one of the 7 gods of happiness; the happy god of abundance and good health. Hotei is seen carrying a large bag over his shoulder that is said to contain gifts and fortunes for those who believe in his virtues. Your goal is to connect all 4 parts of the Magic Island Coin, then go on to find 12 magic coins (one coin on each island), and bring them to Hotei. If you can make it back, Hotei's Jewels will be yours!
