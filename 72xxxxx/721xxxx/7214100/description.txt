                         For All You Scousers Out There!!

           Makes most British gangster films look like the teletubbies 

User Review:

A realistic snapshot of gangland Liverpool
Coming from Liverpool, it was very strange to see and hear the very people you had heard of, who were not to be crossed, acting in a film!
In my opinion it is a very realistic snapshot of the seedier, more murky side of Liverpool, with gangsters and, as the film title suggests, guns.
You wouldn't believe that the actors are actually real people from that seedier world... their performances considering this are superb.
Brilliant film in my opinion, hoping they make another to tie up all the loose ends left from this.
Quality.

All... Well most of the charactors in the film are the real life criminals that where involved in this drama remake of some, not all events, in what took place in some of there lifes in liverpool, Not all this story is fiction as most of it was real and did happen.. and the people in the film playing the parts are in prison for some of the crimes from that time.... But "her majesty's hotels" (prison) cant hold ya 4eva.. so most are out and about again.. ;)
