,westy40,2012-05-03T10:39Z,Stuck on 18.8 % .. because no one is seeding :(
,alangeezy,2012-05-03T14:54Z,I'm seeding as well but one thing about the game is it keeps freezing on me 
,alangeezy,2012-05-03T16:48Z,game frezes and i have new dvd drive and system so not bad on my end but yours abgx even calls it bad rip
,BBP_2010,2012-05-03T23:30Z,"@alangeezy this is not a bad rip it works perfect, its freezing because you did something wrong, try deleting your saved gta games and your cache before installing, and for abgx that only checks to see if it is a clean iso which its not because its been modified. You try and mod an ISO then put it into abgx and you'll get it sayin the same."
,alangeezy,2012-05-08T05:23Z,thanks didn't know about deleting all game save data it now works thanks good mod can you put a loop to loop ramp in one 
,BBP_2010,2012-05-10T19:39Z,"@alangeezy glad it worked, there's loop to loop ramps in the deadly fishes mods torrent that iv uploaded, try that"
