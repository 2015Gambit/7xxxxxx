,Antideox,2012-04-24T22:51Z,"gansuk:
Can't do nothing wrong! I removed every previous install of game (incl.appdata etc.) Turned off AV, installed kaos-version of the game (using install.exe) and clicked shogun2.exe, but nothing happens? As i said before, I've updated all drivers, dx, vcredist, flash to latest version...So what can i do wrong?My AV was turned off the whole time, so it can't be the reason. Tried compatibility modes also+blocked exes access to the internet."

I think I've tried everything twice and still no luck.
The original game(Total War: Shogun 2) works fine so I don't think it has anything to do with my specs.

When I launch the game I can see it in the task manager but nothing happens. After a while the screen blinks and then it disappears from the task manager.

What can I do?"
[V],gansuk,2012-05-01T09:10Z,"install the stuff in the extras folder, make sure u have Microsoft Framework 4.0 installed, make sure you have updated all your drivers gfx,directx,ect try reading the nfo file. and try scan over the other comments.."

,devilleech,2012-05-01T19:00Z,My game doesnt seem to show any cinematics but thats ok i guess the real problem is the sound of the game is all mess up but seems no coment is here for that maybe if i just re-install would do the trick? how can i reinstall the game without going for the 3 hour rebuild?

If I attempt to start game numerous times in a row, I can get to splash screen, followed by pitch black forever.


I want to remove the contents, and I cannot get rid of KaOs.part01.pak, why is this? These are from extracting the torrent. It states the file is open in system.  Why am I unable to remove the contents of this torrent?"

AVG complained once or twice during the rebuild (forgot to turn it off).  Anyway Ignored the warnings, waited about 2 hours for the rebuild. . .

Dunno why such a new game would use outdated redistributables like this. Hopefully someone can make a workaround?"

,wisehumanitarian,2012-05-13T11:00Z,"I too had the problem in which the game was not starting(was shown in task manager for a few seconds). I tried a lot to solve it and came up with the solution. Just do a Clean Startup and then start the game.
For a clean startup:
1. Type msconfig in the start search box and hit enter
2.Choose ""selective startup"" and uncheck ""Load startup items""
3.Got to ""services"" tab, check ""hide all microsoft services"", and then click ""Disable All""
4.Click OK and then Restart...

Your game should now be running... All the best.... :)"
