Pokemon, seasons 01-05, English dubbed, offcourse including banned/censored episodes. the best the internet has to offer (after extensive research and comparing quality).

ShiizuA has all Seasons (also in Japanese), but chooses to upload them separately sothat the seeder/leecher ratio will be better, thus reaching higher speeds.

Size: 46,9 GB
Files: 281
Encoders: PM-Dragon, P-O

ShiizuA made this beautiful package, which took a lot of effort and time.
If you don't have a proper player, try VLC. http://www.videolan.org
