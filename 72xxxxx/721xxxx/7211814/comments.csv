,kromking,2012-04-30T18:09Z,Hi! I was wondering if you can sign up with Demonoid or Torrent Day. The reason why is because I live in the UK and the courts here say we can't use Pirate Bay. I rely on you to have Operation Repo and Hardcore Pawn. So please do this for all of your UK friends. If you want to get on Torrent Day I have an invite to give to you. All I need is your e-mail address. Thank you so much for your help.

I have no problem doing an external link to these shows on Demon, but if you can't use pirate bay then how are you leaving comments?
Just curious."
