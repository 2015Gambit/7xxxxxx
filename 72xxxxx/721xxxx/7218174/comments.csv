THANKS MAN!!!"
,Wayne_Brady,2012-04-26T21:59Z,The audio is NOT in sync how are any of you serious?
,Lucybabe,2012-04-26T23:07Z,"Interesting film and good quality rip. Thankyou.

,BlackandBad,2012-04-27T00:45Z,out of sync on my ps3....sample was insync though...
,rocknrollbaz,2012-04-27T02:36Z,Why do you write SYNCFIXED when clearly it is not? Exactly the same as Hackulus Xvid SPARKS one. If you watch your films on PS3 don't bother with this download.
,jusclem74,2012-04-27T04:23Z,"there are some real idiots around here. the audio is OUT of sync. you will have to adjust it your self. ok for watching but not for burning. and its every torrent labeled ""sparks"". i've checked 5 and some were more out of sync than others but all were out. "
,Kkorp21,2012-04-27T05:15Z,Audio is NOT synced..
,dydog2,2012-04-27T06:30Z,NOT in sync. Just the same as Hackulus upload.
,Jzawadzki,2012-04-27T08:59Z,Well someone tell us how to sync the audio >.>
,msaaa,2012-04-27T12:17Z,"Watched it last night with the sync off, could not give a shit and enjoyed the whole film. Quit whining about free stuff or go pay to see it."
,Pioneer41,2012-04-27T12:21Z,"V: 8.5
A: 9
M: 8 Pretty good movie

The audio IS in perfect sync!

Maybe try playing it on something other than a shitty PS3."
,dydog2,2012-04-27T17:44Z,Let me correct my comment... It is ONLY in sync if you watch it on your computer. It is out of sync if you burn it to DVD. And I tried watching it on my DVD player not a PS3. So again it is the same upload as the one Hackulus put up.
,benicianews,2012-04-27T21:10Z,Audio is still off but watchable.  I enjoyed this movie.
,heenan420,2012-04-27T22:55Z,"heres a little info for those of you that need help. 

1st- Use VLC media player its one of the best players out there in my opinion. 

2nd- If the audio is out of sync on this video (havent finished DL-ing it yet) then...

3rd- Whilst the video is playing use the letters J & K and it will sync foward of backwards just watch the mouth movements and sync it yourself.

4th- Quit bitchin, Its free and someone else did all the rest of the work for you. If your not part of the solution, your part of the problem. hit a couple of keys and SHUT IT. feel proud that you actually were able to do something for yourself. earn some self worth. "
,dydog2,2012-04-27T23:46Z,We're not bitchin... we're just pointing out that the label on this torrent is inaccurate... so quit judging other people asshole.
,tylerawesome,2012-04-28T01:57Z,OMG! movie is so fucking EPIC. thx for uploading :)
,deedee72,2012-04-28T13:16Z,"Audio is in sync. Unless you can hear faster than the speed of light!  YES, light not sound before anybody says anything. If you shut your eyes, how do you know if it's out? Thats right, you have to look. That uses light. "
,DragoonEnder,2012-04-28T18:22Z,"Audio is in sync with even windows media player.

,Timewarpone,2012-04-30T18:27Z,"Thanks for the UP!!! but the sync is not fixed. Image quality is very good and so is the sound ""Quality"". This is the 3rd different upload I tried for this movie and all of them had sync problems so I have a hard time believing the problem is with the uploader. I have the latest version of VLC on my computer."
,UTheGuy,2012-05-02T01:52Z,Nice quality with no audio sync issues using VLC player. 
,JustRacey,2012-05-07T19:01Z,"Absolutely the wors movie i have ever tried to watch. I'm not bashing the audio, video or torrent quality, but the film SUCKS! Had I gone to a theater to ee this I would have walked out and I deleted it from my computer."
,JustRacey,2012-05-07T19:08Z,this is one of the worst films ever made.
,9519,2012-05-09T05:34Z,"audio on track v9 a9

,hazmatt23,2012-05-18T15:05Z,the audio is much better than the Hackulus version.  I'm watching off of a flash drive on an XBOX 360 and its good.  the A/V is borderline 10s.  nice upload
,Sbflus,2012-05-21T19:09Z,Can anyone help I am encountering a problem when trying to download torrents. When I click on the magnets (Get This Torrent) nothing happens.....I updated UTorrent and still nothing. Anyone else getting this same issue or have had this issue int he past and resolved it if so please help.
,Carrot_Bottom,2012-05-28T11:06Z,"Audio - 9

When i open this, it's still not in sync, unfortunate. I will have to wait for another or just download the 4.6GB BluRay Rip"
,tzannes_K,2012-05-28T15:39Z,"A/9

if you are using VLC player then syncing the audio is not a big problem "
,nuke4u,2012-06-01T04:34Z,"@Carrot_Bottom
