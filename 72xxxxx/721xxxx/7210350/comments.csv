this is prolly one of the better ones, but overall this movie is hard to judge when its a cam due to alot of dark shots overall."
,tflagger997,2012-05-23T17:54Z,"This is scenebalance's 9th bloody upload of this movie!

There needs to be some common sense applied.  Most of the others were all just as bad as each other - while this is marginally better but not worth a 9th upload.  

People need to stop DLing just because of the Green Skulls.  They are earned by people uploading many copies of the same thing making it a scam.  It used to mean something, but not anymore.

Please use the Quality marker in the upper right corner too, if you rate it"
