--About--
Two great piano concertos performed by the great Leon Fleisher and George Szell in the new Sony remastering. I'm no program notes writer so I'll just get to the point - Beethoven's piano concertos are amazing, and if you are even remotely interested in classical music, be sure to check them out.
