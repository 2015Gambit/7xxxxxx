Secrets of the Sun

Examining the sun, which is 27 million degrees Fahrenheit at its core. Included: spacecraft- and Earth-based telescopes that are enabling scientists to glean information about how the sun works; research that may help scientists predict and track solar storms, which can play havoc with power grids, satellites and air travel."
