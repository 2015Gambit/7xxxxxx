Here is all of hilary Duff's cds with all artwork Hilary Duff was a teen star as Lizzy McGuire on the Disney Channel. Since then she has continued acting in films and commenced a singing career, selling over ten million albums already.

Hilary Duff turned her attentions from acting to music with several Disneymania releases, but committed to a full album with the release of 2002's Christmastastic Santa Claus Lane. The follow-up, Metamorphosis (2003), charted well in the US and became one of the biggest-selling albums of the year.

She co-wrote some songs on her third album, Hilary Duff, which she said had a rockier edge. It continued her success in the US and Canadian charts. The Most Wanted album, released in 2005, was a mixture of old and new tracks, some of which were inspired by prominent artists of the time, such as Muse. She shared co-writing credits with Joel Madden of Good Charlotte, who she was dating at the time.

After an Italian-only release in 2006, 4Ever, she recorded Dignity (2007). The album marked a move back to a poppier fun style and, once again, charted well in the US and achieved her highest UK charting to date. With an album every year, her ongoing acting career and continuing ability to gain publicity in the celebrity press, Hilary Duff is riding her Disney star high in the sky.
