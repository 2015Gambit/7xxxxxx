In case you haven't been following, Watching Over the Throne is an experimental mixtape where DJ Rob Dinero blends Biggie and Tupac verses with the tracks off of Jay-Z and Kanye West's collaborative album, Watch The Throne.

What makes the mixtape incredible, is the fact that there is currently no instrumental version of Watch The Throne available. DJ Rob Dinero had to literally recreate every beat from scratch.

We think the project is dope and we highly recommend giving it a spin.
