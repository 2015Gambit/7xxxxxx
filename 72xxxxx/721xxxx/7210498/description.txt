Comments are welcome. As this is my first attempt at uploading a torrent, please show mercy. :)

My preferred container for movies is mkv. As such, any movie I download that isn't already an mkv, I make it so.


I downloaded honda93's "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" a couple of days ago, which has an Info Hash of 329C6874A523F3B63E02364AF9A7A367613E7FC4. The "no sound" comment by f0ofigher21 dated 2008-11-12 17:53 CET may have been correct at the time it was posted. But when I played the whole Video TS folder using VLC 2.0.1, I found no problem with sound.

Then I used mkvtoolnix to convert the VTS_01*.VOB to an mkv. I immediately noticed some problem with the sound but didn't give up.

I noticed that when I asked mkvtoolnix to start with VTS_01_1.VOB, it started with the trailer.

To get it just right, I had to tell mkvtoolnix to start with VTS_01_0.VOB instead of the usual VTS_01_1.VOB. And I had to delay the audio by a whopping 137,000 milliseconds. Then I told it to split at 00:07:13.

The resulting mkv seems pretty good.
