Cream were a 1960s British rock supergroup consisting of bassist/vocalist Jack Bruce, 
guitarist/vocalist Eric Clapton, and drummer Ginger Baker. Their sound was characterised 
by a hybrid of blues rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock, combining the psychedelia-themed 
lyrics, Eric Clapton's blues guitar playing, Jack Bruce's voice and prominent bass playing and 
Ginger Baker's jazz-influenced drumming. The group's third album, Wheels of Fire, was the 
world's first platinum-selling double album. Cream are widely regarded as being the world's 
first successful supergroup. In their career, they sold over 15 million albums worldwide
