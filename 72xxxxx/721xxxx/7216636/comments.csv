Also, make sure this is on ur memory cards bc if you move it to ur phone, the theme will go away"

Please help me out here i been looking for this Cm7 theme for months, finally I find it here but dont know how to use this .asec file!"
,JmBa_SCH,2012-05-15T14:33Z,"This is just really pissing me off... I have searched and searched for 3 days now and every post I have found says there is no way to install an app from a .asec file. A .asec file is a encrypted copy of the apk file that has been moved using app2sd, so how can i possibly use this file to install the damn theme! I cant understand why you would upload your .asec file and not .apk."
,Hemi4me,2012-05-17T09:20Z,"i uploaded this through a program Titanium Backup Pro. Let me see if I can find the apk for you, good sir"
,Hemi4me,2012-05-17T09:31Z,"I uploaded the .apk file for you :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
