This is a compilation of all of the most functional RuneScape macros and bots as of April 12, 2012. I have included instructions on how each bot is to be set up for best performance & results.

I take no credibility for any development of the bots featured in my compilation. I did however, include every script that I have personally purchased up to this date. The scripts that I have purchased will be automaticly be added in the Scripts section when correctly installed., 



The bots featured in my compilation are as follows:

RSBot
EpicBot
Simba

Upon the completion of your download, please make sure to seed, and leave feedback for how I can make future improvements.

Thank you & stay tuned, as I will be making consistent releases to keep up with the flow of bot & script updates. Please bookmark my profile to be notified of my releases!
