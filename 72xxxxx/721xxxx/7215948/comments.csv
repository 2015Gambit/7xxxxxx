The English subtitle track which does include those Imhotep parts, has ALL the audio dialog subtitled.  Annoying if you speak or understand English.  Might be able to find the subs for just the foreign audio parts at Opensubtitles.org or one of the other sites.  Note that the framerate is 23.976 if you do go looking for just those subs."
