    Agent 47 is back, and this time he's paid in cold, hard cash. How
    the money is spent will affect his passage through the game and
    the weapons at his disposal, resulting in a unique gameplay
    experience for each player. It's business as usual until he loses
    contact with the CIA. When fellow assassins are systematically
    eliminated in a series of hits, it seems a larger, more powerful
    agency has entered the fray. Sensing he may be the next target,
    he travels to America to make a killing. 


    While others may have released the UDF image of the game on the
    scene, we are the first to bring you a burnable, playable, REAL 
    image from the disk.  The other images, while smaller, are not able
    to use the SS patch method that works with the xtreme firmware.  
    Not only that, they won't be made SS patchable because the DVD 
    track and layout information is already lost.
     
    
    *** We are very sorry for the first release..  to all of the 
    people that downloaded it, especially the ones with slow 
    connections.  Anywho, this one is tested.. it extracts and the
    game itself was tested so there should be no other problems.
