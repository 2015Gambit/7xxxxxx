Thx for this great up! I want to play this on my home DVD/Media player. I will have to convert the MKV to a format that will be playable on it. [I want DD5:1, but not the HD video]"

Even in latest version of VLC
And on a Toshiba blu ray player
Audio is also slightly out of sync
Little bit frustrating as would like to see a Hi Res copy"
