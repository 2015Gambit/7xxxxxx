Consolers of the Lonely demonstrates how great vinyl can be when mastered properly from a well-recorded analog source. The band has gone out of its way to point out that it believes that vinyl is the way this record should heard and released it on vinyl right out of the gate rather than making fans double dip and buy the inferior cd first and then have to spring for the better sounding vinyl later. Recorded directly to one inch tape and mastered by vinyl guru Kevin Gray everything one expects from an excellent vinyl release can be heard. The soundstage is wide and detailed and tonality is evenly balanced never shrill or bright. Great dynamics abound with a big drum sound reminiscent of John Bonhams drums on Physical Graffiti.
