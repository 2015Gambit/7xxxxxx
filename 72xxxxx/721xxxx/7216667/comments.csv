+1 for what the first guy said ;-)"

,Klumzy,2012-04-28T17:46Z,"Good torrent, quick download.

Music, I'll give a  low 7/10, sounded VERY influenced in the vocals from other swedish bands, melodies and rhythms as well.

Overall, it was an alright album. "
,ThePoisonedYouth,2012-04-29T07:49Z,"Is it possible to find this album with practically CD-rip quality, preferably FLAC format? I'm kind of a geek when it comes to this stuff."
,ThePoisonedYouth,2012-04-29T07:54Z,"Did someone remove my comment? That's alright, I'll ask again. Is there any possible way to find this album in FLAC format, or full CD-rip quality?"
,ThePoisonedYouth,2012-04-29T07:55Z,"Ignore my last comment, lol. Question still stands!"
