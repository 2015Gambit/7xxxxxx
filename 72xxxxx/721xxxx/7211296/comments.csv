,matttttttt,2012-04-28T08:27Z,"Looks and sounds great!  One minor gripe:  The frame rate has been converted to 29.97fps from the original 23.98fps.  This leads to some extra blended frames.  Still, better than have the logo on there the whole time!"
,seatides,2012-05-15T18:36Z,thanks a lot! :D could you do ep 6 without the logos as well?
