,univ_code,2012-04-27T02:59Z,"downloading now, but what does DC stand for in the title? directors cut? disc candidate?"
,slaeryx,2012-04-27T03:57Z,"show lots of seeds until you start it, then they drop to 0(233)...makes me think it may not be legit"
,univ_code,2012-04-27T04:16Z,"i don't know. bozx is a trusted uploader and the screens look pretty good. going super slow for sure, though."
,BDPound,2012-04-27T04:31Z,"If it has a skull, it's usually legit. Thanks BOZX!"
,BDPound,2012-04-27T04:33Z,"And look at the cover photo univ_code, it's a Digital Copy and also a Director's Cut. So, DC can stand for either one I guess. LOL"
,72194123,2012-04-27T04:59Z,public trackers absolutely suck for stuff like this. Too bad this isn't on private HD sites yet.
,phase700b,2012-04-27T06:09Z,BOZX uploads a lot of new releases before anyone else. Everybody jumps on them at the same time. Download speeds can be slow sometimes. No surprise.

,driver3260,2012-04-27T10:30Z,How do you get rid  of the subtitles ? please.
,Adam_OSFP,2012-04-27T10:42Z,"@driver3260

Delete these two files:

refined-chonicle-720p.idx	71.62 KiB
refined-chonicle-720p.sub	7.7 MiB

Other solution is to learn to use your media player. :))"

1. Have a closer look:
http://c534909.r9.cf2.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Chronicle-cover.jpg

BTW, you've never hold a Blu-ray disk in your hand, have you? :))

2. There is a ""BluRay"" in release's title, isn't there?

3. Abbreviation used for digital copy is DDC (digital distribution copy).

4. DC stands for Director's Cut."
,JayCeeOne,2012-04-27T11:04Z,Saw this one at a theater... Walked out after 30 minutes!
,z_-e-_n,2012-04-27T11:51Z,DC in this case is Directors Cut.

Do Copy."
,lizardomanson,2012-04-27T15:29Z,Is this a rip for the director's cut or the theatrical??
,phase700b,2012-04-27T16:12Z,"D.C. It's runtime is 1:29:31

now im not saying im the kind of person to go round giving ppl bust noses but theres plenty out there who would not stand for it.

lolol i wonder how many ""shut the f**k up"" ""im gonna s**t down your throat"" i get from the on line gangsters.

You're dealing with leeches who act the part as well.

You have to understand that the demographic for downloading illegal copies of what ever is mostly going to attract some of the lowest life forms on our planet, that's just the way it is. 

It wouldn't be surprising to see people engaging in anti social behavior on here. I'm sure a lot of them never see the light of day."
,tumbler,2012-04-29T15:26Z,so is this cinavia protected? Anyone know?
,whutwhut,2012-04-30T02:35Z,"Can anybody help me? The file doesn't seem to play in any media player, from WMP to VLC.

In WMP is says ""Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file.""

and in VLC, i open the movie and it just never plays...

Anybody have any ideas as to why?"
,CakeMonster,2012-04-30T03:46Z,"The movie is actually good, I was entertained.

@ whutwhut Update your VLC you have an old version OR use splash lite player which is free.

,lassik2,2012-05-02T00:47Z,"My subtitles weren't working at first then I noticed that the file names were not the same. The subs are missing an ""r"" in the name. They say chonicle instead of chronicle. Changed the name and they worked fine. Just a heads up.

By the way, does this film even need subs? Are their any parts that are not in english?"
,CakeMonster,2012-05-02T04:25Z,"@lassik2 

The movies does not NEED subs no

BUT sometimes it can be easier to hear what they said with subs, incase you miss something OR english is not your first language"
,Seere,2012-05-02T17:00Z,"It doesn't matter the name of the subtitles, just open mpc-hc, and click ""file"" then click ""load subtitles"" and open the "".idx"" file not the "".sub"" file"

,YamiKuro,2012-05-15T03:48Z,@krownos In most movies with more then two channels of audio most of the voices come from the center channel. Depending on the player you are using you'll need to adjust the settings to match your speaker setup.

Good movie. Not really a superhero movie, it's just 3 guys with some telekinetic powers, and because they use it well, they can do some great stuff with it, like flying. But those who expect a great superhero movie, should not watch this film. It's the story that is the headliner, not the action."
,Feenixx,2012-05-29T06:05Z,"@thomasrofl:

The file here is a bluray rip, but encoded as an MKV file. As a fellow Macbook Pro user, I recommend VLC player for playback (though I'd recommend VLC for just about any video playback). 

If you want to convert it to a format that can be used for the PS3 or other devices, use MKVTools, which has presets for the PS3, XBox, iPad, etc. Before actually converting the file, it'll try extracting the audio and video (separately) and placing them in a different container. So if the video is already in the right format for PS3 playback for example but the audio isn't, it'll extract the video, then convert the audio, then put them in an MP4 container. The whole process takes less than half an hour if the video doesn't need converting. "
