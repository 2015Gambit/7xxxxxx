,Lajtan1337,2012-04-26T13:12Z,"How to solve the audio synch issue in VLC:
This is what you do:
1. Go to preferences
2. Select Audio from the list, actually I think it is selected by default
3. Click the advanced checkbox in the lower lefthand corner
4. Enter the miliseconds you want to ""desync"" the audio in the box to your right - it's entitled Audio desynchronization compensation - if you want the sound to come before the picture is it originally put a minus in front of the number...

300ms will do."

While your watching the movie rewind for a few seconds and then play.. this usually synchs the audio and video. If it doesnt work try it again. Have done it quite a few times.
Dont know how it works but it works.
Sometimes the synch problem can be created by yourself because you pause the movie or fast forward it which throws it out.. Once synched just play it out or do the above to resynch it.. Enjoy"

@numse - what broke the internet was people like you who have no manners and have no idea just how idiotic they sound when they complain about the quality of the stuff they are stealing. Seriously dude, you don't have the right to be insulting about stolen property unless it's got malware, Your mother raised a jerk. "

NEVER NEVER EVER run something else when you encoding/transcoding movies/tv series ..videos and music in general.

It starts out as in the perspective of a  high school kid doing a video diary and it never gets any better than some self-indulgent crap that looks like it WAS shot and written by a high schooler. I became so bored I had to jump ahead to see if it improved (it didn't).  I did not have any audio or video issues-- just found the movie really not worth the bandwidth.

,Nazher,2012-05-20T05:49Z,"@sayssimon83
Now why would you say something like that?
First of all there are tons of other people commenting about this being out of sync so you would have known before hand that it was if you would have read even the 7th comment from the beginning and would you have read the latter comments then you'd see that it's just to put the ""sound delay"" around 450ms.

People like you are way to spoiled and shouldn't be allowed to get content from the net for free when all you do is bitching about something that only requires a few clicks on the ""K"" button on the VLC Player to be fixed. Is that so hard?

And NEVER tell people if they should or should not download a trusted torrent upload without a proper reason.

First off, he had every right to leave that comment, it IS a valid reason as it IS out of sync. To me that's a reason not to download a torrent. If you feel like watching it on PC, then fine, you can change your settings. But for the large portion of us who would rather stream to our xbox or ps3, it WONT be synced. Therefor this torrent is not worth downloading.

So stop whining. Everyone is brave on the internet ;)"
