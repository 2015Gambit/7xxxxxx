(for the bajiolionth time) I fucking hate Itunes and will never buy another apple product. But, regardless, you rawk my socks. (MY business socks, yea, it's that time)"
,Gnob77,2012-05-02T02:01Z,"Alrighty peeps. If you're gonna use this.. shit. Have it be known it will crash windows explorer every time you click on anything windows related, your browsers and other programs will work. I found this out the hard way. More'n'less. Download/install. Don't use anything else (if using solely to transfer playlists, as I did) then unistall it, or it will cause you a headache. Srsly, I say avoid unless you have some decent grasp on what you're doing. Fuck this torrent. Be very wary."
,Gnob77,2012-05-02T02:05Z,Gawd I feel like a noob. This shit didn't work at all. Yet again. Fuck this torrent and it's uploader.
