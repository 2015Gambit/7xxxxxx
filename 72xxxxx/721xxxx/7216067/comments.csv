,destinyfate1,2012-04-27T07:48Z,"Good Japanese games like these should be supported if you like them, if PC games get popular, there will be more japanese companies willing to produce great PC games. The japanese are also know for the great games that they make, it's just that most of them arent translated or are on playstation, so please guys, if you like it, buy it :>"

Gaijin Entertenment is originally Japanese game development company and Konami is purely Japanese game devs
