Reach for the Sky (1956)


Biopic of the famed British World War II flyer, Sir Douglas Bader. He joined the RAF in 1928 and easily took to flying, perhaps too easily as his commanders are concerned at the risks he takes with his aircraft. After a nasty crash in 1931, he loses both of his legs above the knee. After a long convalescence and learning to walk again with artificial legs, he returns to flying school where he again passes. The RAF forcibly retires him however due to his presumed disability. With the onset of World War II, Bader is re-instated and is given command of a fighter squadron. He survives the Battle of Britain but is shot down over enemy territory in 1941 losing one of his artificial legs. He was a POW and the RAF even sent a new leg to replace the one he lost. Known as a problem prisoner because of his numerous attempts to escape, he was transferred to Coldiz for much of his time, until the end of war.
