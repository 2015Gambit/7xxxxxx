,brewer42,2012-04-26T19:04Z,Why do people torrent the Daily Show? Watch the full episodes on their website? I was in Korea and still about to view it.

,MrBix,2012-04-27T22:26Z,"brewer42: I used to watch it on their website, but they started blocking IPs from Africa a couple months ago."
,PBR-Streetgang,2012-05-01T05:44Z,"@brewer42:
Not all countries are filled with US servicemen as Korea is, most have little to none. Most USA shows have banned internet access to countries that they broadcast into unless you have... like Australia. If you were not so ignorant you would understand this and many other things that happen to people in other countries.

Thank-you to VTV for taking the trouble to help us access this fantastic show."
