,TJTheIncia,2012-04-27T19:28Z,"Love your stuff gansuk!
But I've gotten a problem, the game gets this; 'name' has stopped working- at startup.

It might be by an error that i got in the install sequence where it stood something like; Gibbed.RED.Pack.exe - initzialising for .NET Framework
You need version v4.0.30319 

do you maybe know how i can fix this? thanks :)"
,TJTheIncia,2012-04-27T19:34Z,"btw when I re-installed it, the same happened, and when i ran Configurator it said i didn't have a valid installation"
,iittopper,2012-04-27T20:37Z,TJtheincia - download net framwork 4.0
,iittopper,2012-04-27T20:38Z,@TJtheincia - download net framework 4.0
[V],gansuk,2012-04-27T20:47Z,"like it says

.NET Framework
You need version v4.0.30319 

download it from
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718

once thats installed it shud work but you will need to reinstall this rip after you installed .net framework v4"
,TJTheIncia,2012-04-27T21:43Z,thanks alot:) I will go check it out right away
,TJTheIncia,2012-04-28T00:22Z,"I've installed the Net.framework and i dont get the error while installing or the 'has stopped working' at launch, but now when I click the launching the machine processes for half a second and stops, and the configurator still says the installation is invalid and has to be re-installed :/ do you have any ideas if I'm doing anything wrong?"
,doritoman,2012-04-28T06:13Z,does kaOs have a facebook page or something?
,wroth91,2012-04-29T04:38Z,"umm, I installed using installer and none of the textures will load in-game, the beginning videos and main title background are gone too"
,wroth91,2012-04-29T04:53Z,"oh, forget that, had to change reg entries since I moved it"
,wroth91,2012-04-29T05:02Z,"no, the opening videos and title background are still gone"
,wroth91,2012-04-29T05:56Z,"ok, reinstalled in location I'm keeping it and now everything works great, sorry about that and thank you"
[V],gansuk,2012-04-29T09:17Z,@wroth91  the black movies can be fixed by setting the aspect ratio to 16.9. the movies are fine in the release its an issue with the game itself and not everybody has the problem.
,wroth91,2012-05-01T08:01Z,"when installing make sure you install to the directory you plan to keep it and don't move it, that was my problem, it will mess up textures and movies if you move it

feel free to delete my earlier comments, I was just being impatient, great upload, thanks"

,spidy09,2012-05-15T12:49Z,"Great torrent, but if I may ask, did you remove any movies other than the foreign ones? because I'm only getting audio when Dandelion narrates after the prologue, a black screen and voice, it's supposed to show a map and geralt and triss on the ship."

,pan43,2012-05-31T02:09Z,"this works and the game is great. patch 3.1 works too.
Tip: when in configuration, be sure to make Texture memory size large (good) or very large (better). The game will run smoothly"
