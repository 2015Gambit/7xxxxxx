I'd like you to check out these exclusive remixes of my latest track Silent Shadows. 

I worked on the music for ΓÇ£Silent ShadowsΓÇ¥ with the guys from Noisia and came up with the lyrical concept with Swedish vocal talent Mirou to finish the track off. I was also really happy to be able to work with L.A. based music video director Alistair Legrand on a very cheeky video, which is unlike anything I have ever done before. 

I have kept a bit quiet the past year, but I can ensure you that I have been slaving away in the studio like a madman and canΓÇÖt wait to share more of my new music and collaborations with the world this year! I have had so much support from the online community these last few years and want to thank every blog across the globe for giving me a platform beyond daytime radio and t.v. and I hope we can continue to keep breaking the rules together in the years to come!

Cheers
Don Diablo
