"Traitor"

When a crystal is magically stolen from the 
abandoned house, the Circle decides it was the 
traitor witch working with Eben so Jake calls for 
a meeting with Isaac to see if they can get him 
to change sides. Cassie's loose grasp on her dark 
magic threatens to destroy any possible alliance 
when their pursuit of the traitor leads them to 
the "Creepiest Place on Earth." Meanwhile, Faye 
and Jake work together to steal Dawn's crystal, 
Melissa and Adam pair up and uncover a new magic 
trick. Meanwhile, a frustrated Diana reaches out 
to Charles for help.
