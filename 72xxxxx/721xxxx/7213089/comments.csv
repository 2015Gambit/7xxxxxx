,filthypig,2012-05-05T21:34Z,Is there any reason why the ending is edited? There's an entire scene missing -- anyone know if there's any copies of that movie that aren't cut?
,riffraffselbow,2012-09-22T02:42Z,"This is missing the final scene, which is not entirely kid-friendly but is probably the most emotional scene in the movie. I won't spoil it, but I'd strongly advise picking up a version that doesn't have that cut. Otherwise, good upload, and if you're looking for a version without a downer ending, this is the one you want. It's clear it's cut, too, previous scenes hint at it, but it's not there. This version also doesn't have subs in the download, which is also annoying.

But:
v: 10/10 (looked very nice, didn't notice any artifacts)
a: 10/10 (I think, can't understand Korean but it didn't sound distorted or bad at all)"
