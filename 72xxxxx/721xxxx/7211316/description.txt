"Pop is the final album by Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project. It was released in 2000 on the Mille Plateaux label. At the time of release, reviews noted 'a striking left turn' in the sound, compared to other Gas releases; the album sounds considerably crisper, with a less muffled kickdrum and less of the 'underwater' quality present on other releases under the name. Like all Gas albums, the tracks are untitled."
