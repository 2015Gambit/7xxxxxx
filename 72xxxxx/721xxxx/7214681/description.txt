*** 
I use a Transfer Cap and upload 7 gigs a day. This is why I upload a new torrent every other day or so. I do this to keep my IP off my back as they have initiated a monthly limit. It usually takes me two days to fully seed a torrent so please be patient.

SYNOPSIS:  
Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney were teamed up for the only time in their careers in Smart Money. Robinson has the larger part of a small-town barber who fancies himself a big-time gambler. He travels to the Big City carrying ten grand from backers at home with his younger brother (Cagney), who comes along as his bodyguard. Unfortunately Robinson has a weakness for beautiful blondes, which means trouble with a capital T. Watch closely in the first reel for an unbilled appearance by Boris Karloff as a dope pusher. Smart Money was Oscar nominated for Best Original Screenplay.

I upload my torrents to The Pirate Bay and Demonoid, if you would like to upload one of my torrent files to another tracker feel free, all I ask is that you upload the same torrent file you downloaded by clicking on one of my links so that more seeders/peers are in the swarm.
