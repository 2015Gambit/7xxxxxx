PLOT :

In a decaying mansion in England, the former Lord Donald Brocklebank lives with his wife Nancy, who is very ill, and their schizophrenic teenage son James, who needs to use several pills to stay calm. Donald is completely broke, apparently for paying for Nancy's medical treatment, and has been pressed to sell his manor. One day, Donald needs to travel early in the morning to London for business and he summons Nurse Mary. However, James decides to prove to his father that he is capable of taking care of his mother and he closes all the accesses to the house and locks himself with his mother inside the house. He gives an overdose of pills to his mother expecting to heal her and Nancy dies. At the funeral, there is another problem with James driving Donald insane.
