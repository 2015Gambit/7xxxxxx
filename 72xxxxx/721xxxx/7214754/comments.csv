,TJBab,2012-04-25T18:11Z,nope...there's a patch for it that's fully working...though u need to disable ur antivirus for it
,blacksidex6,2012-04-25T18:29Z,Please...32 or 64 bit
,foto-digital,2012-04-25T18:47Z,let the speed please!
,loledujo,2012-04-25T20:30Z,"I can not say 100% since i haven't downloaded the file yet, but if you look at the ""files"" you can see that both 32 and 64 bit files are in. so i say its both."
,Activate-it,2012-04-25T21:28Z,Does it work? i'm at 86% and it has slowed down to 40 kb/s i hope it does. I'll post a comment after i've installed it (:
,adamtage,2012-04-25T22:29Z,SEED please... i'm at 93.7%
,ddkkpp,2012-04-25T22:51Z,need serial for mac version -- d/l'd from adobe.
,erronr,2012-04-25T23:31Z,I am stuck at 99%! I want to see if this works. 
,TheAslan,2012-04-26T00:19Z,"Looks like it's working but for me it's not showing ""extended"""
,t3chn0v1k1ng,2012-04-26T00:43Z,"Works for me perfectly, windows 7 ultimate 64.
One note though: the patch was by default aimed at the x86 directory of photoshop (which I didn't install)

for 64 bit users: when you run the patch, it will say ""can not find the file, search the file?"" click ""yes"" and just manually navigate to ""amtlib.dll"" Located in your regular 64 bit photoshop directory ""C:>program files>Adobe>Adobe Photoshop CS6 (64 Bit)"" Do not look in your Program Files (x86) for the .dll to patch.

no viruses according to Microsoft Security Essentials.

Thanks for this!"
,morphious666,2012-04-26T01:11Z,"ok bad news, This is Not Extended version ( at least 64 bit is not ) and it is a version from 3/15/2012 20120315.r.428 Sorry guys, not the final release :-( 

Have a look at the image he uploaded, the Extended version Would have a 3D and Analysis drop down in the tool bar... Nice try though.. "
,t3chn0v1k1ng,2012-04-26T02:13Z,"Actually I take that back. 
It crashed on me within first 20 minutes. Lost work because of it. Removing torrent and deleting data..

Better off using the trial beta and waiting for official release."
,humhum84,2012-04-26T03:00Z,"I downloaded this torrent, installed, and went to use the crack provided, now I don't know if it's just me, but I could not see a patch button for me the life of me, I clicked on every square millimeter of the window... If someone could help me I'd be greatly appreciative."
,humhum84,2012-04-26T03:09Z,"Thx for the upload. I downloaded and installed however I cannot get the patch to ""patch"" for the life of me, mainly because I can't seem to locate the patch button .... Am I missing something? Could someone please help me?"
,TJBab,2012-04-26T03:32Z,"@morphious666
dude...64-bits r not extended....use the 32 bit version for extended"
,rawasduke,2012-04-26T05:31Z,"Do NOT download!  This is a complete VIRUS.  Crashed my computer multiple time and now running slower than ever!  I turned off my Avira to install it. I deleted the entire download. Installed. Turned Avira back on, and it detected something hidden, but didn't know what it was. So I signed back on here to tell ya'll.  Now avira identified TR/Dropper.gen virus with more scanning to go.  But have no fear... I completely backed up my computer just before downloading this, cause i suspected!  Oh yeah, and patch doesn't work like everyone else said...  "
,WarRobe,2012-04-26T06:14Z,"This is suspicious... The splash screen is terribly cheap, not even close to what I expected for a CS6 release. Just compare with the CS5 old one. Looks more like a revamped beta version."
,itsRahman,2012-04-26T07:44Z,"Thanks for uploading !

,TJBab,2012-04-26T10:11Z,i don't know y people r having problems with this install....it worked absolutely fine for me and my pc is working fine too....i think those who couldn't run it properly have some problems in your PC
,leigh_d7,2012-04-26T11:29Z,It does work well and is nice to have a copy to get use to the new Interface. But yes it is not the full version or extended. But very good easy patch. 
,LeoJan,2012-04-26T11:57Z,"Avira gave a virus warning, I wait for the real thing"
,LJUSALF,2012-04-26T12:46Z,"@TJBab I think i´m going to trust you and install this. Maybe it´s just a beta and not extended, but as the man said above, you can use this for learning purpose. Hopefully!"
,Morres13,2012-04-26T16:42Z,"Can someone pls help me fix this problem: it is full version, extended, still I can not patch it because for some reason patch program is passive, I see no patch button only the info, and I'm stuck at trial version. I'm on win 7 x64 platform, and I'm dying for the solution of this!!"
,leing,2012-04-26T18:16Z,"Thank you very much for this program. It works fine!

Morres13: Stop the anti-virus program before using the patch-program and there is ""PATCH"" button. "
,Activate-it,2012-04-26T21:25Z,"THERE IS A VIRUS in it do not download. I downloaded it and the installer asked me to reboot my pc wicht i did but then it got slow so i rebooted again but now it won't start anymore. It crashed my computer and it's not the official version of CS6 it's just the beta that has been manipulated. Anyway if you do decide to try it, back-up your most important stuff first!!"
,Animal98,2012-04-26T21:28Z,"This is NOT the Extended versions...It is just like morphious666 and maxmoser99 both state. This is an older version from 3/15/2012 20120315.r.428...version 13.0...It does work, but still not the final! Thanks again!"
,Elbichu,2012-04-27T02:11Z,This Fucking Shit doesnt work....it keeps as a trial.....Ching_Liu...tu eres un CABRON...
,Elbichu,2012-04-27T02:14Z,"I installed it as trial and it works but it keeps saying ""30 days trial"""
,TJBab,2012-04-27T12:07Z,@LJUSALF...thanx.....I got the extended version from this.....just run the 32-bit version
,Animal98,2012-04-27T18:14Z,"@TjBab...I Have both installed, but both are NOT Extended!...
@Those that can't get it past the trial, try running the patch as ADMIN! You aren't patching the file properly!"

,c2h5oh,2012-04-28T17:21Z,"The patch contains a Trojan ""Trojan.Gen""
If you want to install it, dont blame anyone but your self"
[T],Ching_Liu,2012-04-29T23:03Z,"SOME PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
.
1. Do not start the installation, the installer gives an error
.
There are many reasons for this. Two possible reasons are : 
a. The conflict with previous products Adobe. 
Solution: 
Remove the application at a time until the problem is solved. 
b. Applications are removed, a window pops up again. 
Solution: 
We clean the folder% SystemDrive%  Program Files  Common Files  Adobe  Installers  uninstall 
(For x64% SystemDrive%  Program Files (x86)  Common Files  Adobe  Installers  uninstall) 
Adobe. Be careful, the action can lead to problems with other products of Adobe. 
.
2. After patching it is not activated Extended version (in the ""About"" no mention of Extended)
.
1. Remove the patched file (s) amtlib.dll, by default they are located here: 
For 32: SystemDrive  Program Files  Adobe  Adobe Photoshop CS6 
For 64: SystemDrive  Program Files  Adobe  Adobe Photoshop CS6 (64 Bit) 
....OR.....SystemDrive  Program Files (x86)  Adobe  Adobe Photoshop CS6 
2. Rename the original (amtlib.dll.BAK) to amtlib.dll. 
3. Launch Photoshop, accept the agreement, close. 
4. Use the patch again. 
.
3. No 3D option
.
a. If you have Windows XP, then the item will not be updated engine does not work with 3D in XP (and there may be problems with the new blur filters). Adobe.com: 3D features and some GPU-enabled features are not supported on Windows XP. 
b. If the system is higher than Windows XP, then look at the item 2. ""When the patch is not activated Extended Version"" 
.
4. In the patcher i can not see the buttons
.
Set the font size in the system to 100% (Control Panel -> Display or RMB on the desktop -> Screen Resolution -> Make text and other elements default). 
.
5. Error when running the tool ""plastic"", as well as new filters blur (""Blurring the diaphragm,"" ""Blur field""), etc.
.
1. 3D features and some GPU-enabled features are not supported on Windows XP. 
2. If the system is higher than XP, update  install the graphics driver. 
.
6. Patcher does not patch files, gives an ERROR message.
.
You are in wrong folder."
,Deive33,2012-04-30T12:44Z,man nice torrent and good recipe on instalation the and crack instalation :)
,keponteam,2012-04-30T15:09Z,"Works fine, you just have to read the .nfo file.

Thank you"
,Animal98,2012-04-30T22:26Z,"I must retract my previous statement...This IS the FINAL AND EXTENDED!

You are supposed to boot each one up BEFORE you patch the amtlib.dll files on BOTH 64 and 32 Bit! After that, shut them down, then patch! If you already have patched them, do this: Go to BOTH folders and change the amtlib.dll to amtlib.dll.patch and then change the amtlib.dll.BAK to amtlib.dll. Then run each 32 and 64 Bit..They will be EXTENDED. Then, shut them down, change the DLLs BACK! Now you are fully up and running! I couldn't for the life of me figure out WHY these weren't extended! Now they both are! Thanks again!"

,skoxpress,2012-06-07T16:14Z,Wow-thanks Ching. I've been looking all over for a solution to the no 3D problem.

[T],Ching_Liu,2012-06-11T17:19Z,"CONTINUED
6. Patcher does not patch files, gives an ERROR message.
 .
 1. You may be in wrong folder.
 2. You may not have admin rights on your system.
 .
 7. The ""Update"" button is not active
 .
 The button is not active after patching, but the update continues to be checked (if not blocked by firewall).
 Updates can be checked without starting Photoshop.
 For x32:
 Run SystemDrive  Program Files  Common Files  Adobe  OOBE  PDApp  core  PDapp.exe
 For x64:
 Run SystemDrive  Program Files (x86)  Common Files  Adobe  OOBE  PDApp  core  PDapp.exe
 .
 This action is equal to pressing the ""Update"" button in Photoshop.
 P.S. Create a shortcut for PDapp.exe, if necessary.
 .
 8. Where is the patch, i do not see it.
 .
 1. You may be in wrong folder.
 2. Your security software may delete or quarantine the patch without your knowledge.
 .
 9. I have language problem, how can i change it.
 .
 1. You should select your language at the beginning of installation.
 2. You can not change it after installation."
