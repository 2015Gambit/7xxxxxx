,iamrifter,2012-05-26T14:52Z,"Can we get some seeders on this? Yes we get it that there were some shows broadcast after, but this torrent was complete at the time it was uploaded and includes several episodes that are available nowhere else. (for instance ""butt dial"" and ""eggcelent."")  Maybe the previous ""complete"" torrent, which was also incomplete, made people believe the season was over and  they stopped uploading, I dunno.  But thanks for uploading and PLEASE SEED!!"

,topk,2012-07-19T18:33Z,"there are 40 episodes in last season, no one has the full series for some reason"
,topk,2012-07-19T18:37Z,"You are the first person to upload episodes after Rap It Up! 
but still, as of July 2012 almost complete season 3 has been aired, except 2-3 remaining episodes, but no one has the season 3 complete (missing the last couple episodes) instead everyone has season 3 only up to ep10, except for you! so thank you! but you still are missing a bunch of episodes!"
