Step 1 - Download the individual parts of the file into a folder on your computer. Remember where you put em!
Step 2 - Download the merger file. 
Step 3 - Browse to the folder where you downloaded the file to and make sure you have all the files needed!
Step 4 - Double-click the merger file to start the process. 
You will see a small command prompt window appear.
Step 5 - You will be asked if you wish to delete the parts that are no longer needed. Click 'YES' for this."

,ani789,2012-04-26T18:03Z,"@veeresh after joining file, try to extract with winrar or 7zip because windows default software might not be capable of extracting highly compressed files. It worked for me with winrar."
