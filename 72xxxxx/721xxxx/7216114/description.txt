in my country you have two bloody choices :
Either 2 kill, then you are a "Murder"
or 2 be killed, then you are a "Victim"
like "Be or not to Be"
in the other hand, you have two different peacefully choices :
Either 2 stand with the killer, then you are a ''Murder'' as him
or 2 stand with the victim, then you are an ''innocent'' as him
you have the choice!
