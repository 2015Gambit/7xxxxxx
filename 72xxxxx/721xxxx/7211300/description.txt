Recorder's notes: "From what I understand, this is the second recorded Gourds live show. Also, from what IΓÇÖve read, it circulates with some of the songs in lesser quality than others. That is not the case of this version. A friend of mine bought a cassette of this show from the original drummer of the Gourds the first time we saw them. I think it cost $5. I donΓÇÖt remember if I copied that tape or my dub of it to make the DAT. In any case I donΓÇÖt think anyone is going to have a problem with the quality. It is top notch. I canΓÇÖt even tell where I splice the two sides together. This sounds like one long tape. I know IΓÇÖm going to scare a lot of people off, but I may have used noise reduction in the transfer. I know, I know, IΓÇÖve learned since then, but unfortunately the cassettes are long gone so this is all I have. I only say that to be as open and honest about the transfer. If it was used, it was with a light touch because it doesnΓÇÖt sound like much high end is missing. Please donΓÇÖt let that keep you from this download if you are a fan. There are some rare cuts here, and as I said earlier, it seems to only circulate with some songs in bad condition."


Interesting note from a listener: "This...was the ONLY recording of [The Gourds which] you could actually buy until their first CD came out in 1997."
