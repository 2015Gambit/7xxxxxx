,Orochi_Z,2012-07-16T02:00Z,I couldn't get this to play for shit on my PS3 through PS3 Media Server. Just herked and jerked and the video would barely play at all.
,Carjacker,2012-07-16T19:23Z,"This file is in .MKV format.
Please read the following from the PS3 website:
http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/video/filetypes.html
Most likely you will need to convert the MKV into a compatible file for your PS3- most files for PS3 movies//TV Shows are in MP4 format."

Havent done this myself,so Im not sure it would work or not- I dont own a PS3 atm,but seems like a well thought out detailed post.
