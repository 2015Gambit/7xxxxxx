,mohee23,2012-04-25T10:06Z,Awesome made my day....
,RustyMcclintock,2012-04-26T04:17Z,"You sir, are the fucking man! you torrents are so organized and complete. You obviously spent a lot of time and effort and I salute you for it!"
,robert930,2012-04-26T13:30Z,"Thanks a lot good sir
many hours of nostalgia are waiting"
,AnxiouslyCalm93,2012-04-29T10:40Z,This won't work for mac os x riggggggggght?
,AnxiouslyCalm93,2012-04-29T10:42Z,"i have ""sixtyforce"" or whatever that is to run these other n64 games but i don't want to download and i don't know what might happen!

[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-01T07:53Z,i HATE mac therefore i know nothing about it. cept that it sucks and doesnt have a lot of games that are compatible with it....i guess if there is an emulator of super nes and n64 then this should work on a mac if u separately get that emu. it should run these roms. i highly doubt there are separate rom file types for a mac
,FatBastard420,2012-05-11T04:23Z,"Anyone happen to know if these emulators will support the use of a gamepad, like Xbox360 USB controller?  "
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-11T08:04Z,yeah they will. gotta config it though
,vegeta5000,2012-05-13T01:06Z,have the old nes and super nes still play them thanks for the torrent 
,the_koptimist,2012-05-13T05:07Z,"Any ideas why none of the Final Fantasy games will respond to my keyboard? I can get other ROMs (even Bebe's Kids *shudder*) to work but not any of them. I'm using ZSNES on Linux Mint. Any help would be appreciated, and thanks for the otherwise very nice torrent!"
,alnteixs,2012-06-06T05:59Z,Thanks!
,Heinz81,2012-06-09T16:26Z,"the_koptimist,

Get the ""Gravis Gamepad"". It's cheap and its modeled just like a plastation controller. I works really well for SNES. "
,Heinz81,2012-06-09T16:27Z,Look at the ratio on this.  142 seeders to 20. People really want to share this awesome torrent. 
,ableemuser,2012-06-11T12:15Z,"OK just a heads up. Once you download it and end up with 715 [!] ROM's (which mean they are verified), run them all through snespurify. Next, run them all through NSRT. There will be 10 Bad ROM's and 16 Corrupt ROM's if you have done everything correctly. Delete these files to leave you with 689 CRC verified [!] SNES roms for the 32-bit version of bsnes! Optionally, you can delete the 2 Stellarview games (.BS extension). Mad props to FuCtUpPuNk!"
,ableemuser,2012-06-11T13:00Z,also.. I didn't see A.S.P Air Strike Patrol or Doom Troopers in this list. I got these from another compilation (which only had a few CRC verified roms) so maybe I can upload somewhere? It's not hard to find...
,assfacefromhell,2012-06-14T07:42Z,Why include so many duplicates? Do we really need 20 version of Aladdin?
,noelly94,2012-06-14T12:37Z,don't mean to sound ungrateful or anything but there are a few games missing super gradius and gradius III are missing as i can see and the donkey kongs only seem to be the Japanese versions 
,noelly94,2012-06-14T23:02Z,needs 16gbs to uncompress the games alone x.x but still awesome collection but why all the different versions it makes it so annoying trying to find a specific game especially since most of them are called super (game name) u cant even just type the first letter of the game q.q
,Zora_Sama,2012-07-02T01:23Z,"can you plese please plese 
make a gameboy / gameboy colour / gameboy advanced one?   wouldent mind all 3 in 1  thanks on beforehand"
,sharer1064,2012-07-16T20:37Z,"Body, thanks for your effort. My ancestors, My grandparents, Me, and My future kids appreciate this.

Thanks bro."
,zelazor,2012-07-17T10:47Z,"ohyeah, miss this games
thanks man"
,Rand0mX1985,2012-07-21T01:41Z,Yeah there is way to many duplicates. This torrent/ rom pack is best if you are plan on making a SNES website other than that I don't see the reason for needing 29 copies of Alladin and 5-20 duplicates of every other game.
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-08-04T20:10Z,"stop being greedy and think about other ppl!!! this rom pack isnt just for 1 person so stop thinking of ur self.... ""oh im a whiner and i only want this version"" WELL!!!! other ppl want other versions...sooo i included them all. get over it or go elsewhere. :) happy torrenting"
,tonyeverhart,2012-08-08T19:22Z,i have all roms for nes snes n64 all in diff torrents only one copy of each game each game has the real title so you can search for them in a folder http://thepiratebay.se/user/tonyeverhart dont even have to download this to tell you it has more then one of the same game my n64 torrent is about 6 gigs by itself and my snes torrent is only 666mb with 773 games so 1.73 gib is way to much for snes games and their are only 773 games not including hack foreign games.(by the way my nes torrent has foreign games hacks and more)
,bowlinwes300,2012-09-07T04:18Z,"@Rand0mX1985 and assfacefromhell. there are that many duplicates because those are different parts of the game when you want to play one you need to put them all in the emulator and it will play them if you have decided to delete them because you think they are duplicates then post about how they don't work, I don't feel sorry for stupidity. that is all"
