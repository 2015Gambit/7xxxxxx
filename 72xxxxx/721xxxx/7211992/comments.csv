He said its been a great 18 year on the air, wild ride, and basically thanks for all hte memories.  Then he comes back the last hour with some re-hashed re-run bullsit like he always does thinking nobody notices.  But now this.  Its Almost a week and no savage.  I truly, truly tjhink he is done this time.  If you listened Thursday, he was tellling us goodbye.If I am right, it is the end of an era.  God I hope not.  Kuhner is not bad, but all his callers make brilliant points to him.  Everybody nailed it.  Hit it right on the head.  Great point.  Even when it wasn't.  And whats with the damn ""k's"".  Either way thanks Papa!"

If memory serves I think he takes a week off around this time of year. With so much at stake I would find it hard to believe that he's finished this close to the election. We will have to wait and see."
