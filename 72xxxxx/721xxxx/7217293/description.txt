So I decided to finally do something with the CD I made a while back and upload it to the thepiratebay. I've never intend on trying to be a rap star or make any money on doing it; it was more of a hobby. I only made copies for friends and other people who wanted it, but now I'm putting it on thepiratebay just to see what other people (complete strangers) think about it. Now, it's not the best music in the world; cuz I recorded these when I was the ages 16-18, I'm now 26. But I have been told that it was good. I honestly don't think so because I'm hearing myself and I don't like it, but thatΓÇÖs for other people to judge. Anyways, 
I wanted to get back into it and put everything on thepiratebay cuz I enjoy piracy, it's awesome but I'd like to know if anyone will even like this Album before I try to do another one. If successful; I will become a "Pirate Bay" rapper, just for kicks. I support piracy and do not intend on making any money off of this, just the support of other pirates. So please Download this and give it a listen. I want all the feedback I can get whether it's the good, the bad, or the ugly I just need to be motivated to do another Album.
