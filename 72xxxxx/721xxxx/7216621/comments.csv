And the size of this one is almost twice as the 1st half? Interesting..."
[T],footy,2012-04-26T00:23Z,@Ballrunn : You will come to know why the size is more after you start watching it.
,JustAnotherApprentice,2012-04-26T01:47Z,"Hey Footy!

Thanks a lot,dude!

I'll certainly keep seeding it for days."
,b11c,2012-04-26T11:02Z,"Ta mate, I appreciate your effort "
,EdoSensei,2012-04-27T17:28Z,"I've waited a couple of days to post this as I imagine most have seen or now know the result. But Ballrunn, PLEASE don't post comments like you did in future! I deliberately didn't look at the file sizes because I know that can be a give away, but YOURS was the 1st comment which without trying I flash read!  And I instantly knew there'd be extra time and therefore knew the score after 90 minutes! Cheers!!!!

NOT clever!"
[V],albiondean,2012-04-28T20:09Z,"EdoSensei, you'll be surprised at how many still don't know the result even after a couple of days or even weeks, so the only one here posting a spoiler is you."
,JustAnotherApprentice,2012-05-01T04:29Z,"I get EdoSensei point, albiondean. The guy really gives a clue about the result."
