Alimankada - The Road From Elphant Pass by Chandran Rutnam



An army officer's routine assignment to pick up a woman informant near Jaffna turns into a nightmare when the Tigers launch a massive attack in the peninsula targeting the camp at Elephant Pass. The two adversaries are forced to escape together through rebel held Wanni and later, cross the abandoned Wilpattu National Park on foot. 

Bitter enemies at the start of their journey, Captain Wasantha and the activist Kamala face innumerable dangers from wild animals and threats by a gang of deserters who make determined and violent efforts to apprehend the woman. The constant external danger, and their enforced dependence on each other gradually erodes their enmity and distrust. 

But a shocking revelation confronts Wasantha when he finally reaches Colombo. He is now compelled to choose between his friend and his country.
