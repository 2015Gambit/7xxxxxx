[V],thetorrentlord,2012-04-26T16:17Z,"@alien99: I will soon be uploading a bunch of Cold Case episodes in 720p in addition to the ones that I have already posted in case you are interested. They will not be complete seasons as I am recording most myself and a few that I have found on the internet. Am working on organizing them as I have time. Am also trying to do Without A Trace, but most that I try to get are edited severely and not worth posting. I will only be posting them if I can obtain enough to warrant an upload. Thanks for all the oldies!"
