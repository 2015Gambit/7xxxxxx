Maybe I'll be curious enough to research it for myself, but another time, I won't bother, I'll just catch it on MVGroup."

I typed ""BBC4 Mystery of the Minoans"" into google, and I got stacks of information on the program, instantly.

Thanks for the comment, it's more than most bother to leave, but if you can't be bothered to ""google"" it, don't bother with the download. Simple."
