Juan Verdera (born Juan Verdera Fern√°ndez), aka The Muses Rapt is a Spanish psychedelic trance musician. He began his career in the early 80's when he worked as a keyboardist with experimental punk bands like Derribos Arias, who used drum machines and guitars to create a hybrid of punk and industrial. He then came to Ibiza and began promoting concerts and invested his money in a studio in which he began to write his own experimental techno tracks. When he performed his first open-air-party in India, he "fell in love" with Goa trance, and so he decided to devote himself to the creation of trance.

Verdera's life was next altered when he discovered that he had cancer. He was advised to begin an intensive course of chemotherapy. During this period, Juan found peace and relief in trance music. Over the course of one of his treatment sessions, Juan experienced a surge of inspiration that followed him home to his studio. It was under the influence of this inspiration that he wrote his famous track "Spiritual Healing". After this single was released, Juan began to recover. He is currently in good health.
