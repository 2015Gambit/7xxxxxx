In 1992 Emmylou Harris recorded the Nashville Country Duets album with Carl Jackson. Carl, an accomplished bluegrass instrumentalist and songwriter, who was born on September 18 in 1953 in Louisville, Mississippi, USA. Jackson debuted at the tender age of 14 by accompanying his dad and his uncle on the banjo in a local bluegrass outfit. One of his compositions, 'Banjo Man', illustrates how he learned to copy Earl Scruggs' licks by listening to his records and picking along with them. Jackson toured with Jim & Jesse's Virginia Boys in the late '60s and during that time also made his first solo album.
