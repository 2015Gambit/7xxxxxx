DESCRIPTION:

Slavery in the Modern World: A History of Political, Social, and Economic Oppression helps bring to light an often-ignored tragedy,
 opening readers' eyes to the devastated lives of those coerced into unpaid labor. It is the first and only comprehensive 
encyclopedia on practices that persist despite the efforts of antislavery advocates, nongovernmental organizations, and 
national legislation aimed at ending them.

Ranging from the late-19th century to the present, Slavery in the Modern World examines the full extent of unfree labor practices 
in use today, as well as contemporary abolitionists and antislavery groups fighting these practices and legislative action from 
various nations aimed at exposing and shutting down slave operations and networks. The 450 alphabetically organized entries 
are the work of over 125 of the world's leading experts on modern slavery.
