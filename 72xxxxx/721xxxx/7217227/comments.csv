,craddle,2012-04-26T06:23Z,Is this one out of sync too?
,davidolsen,2012-04-26T06:39Z,"Audio is out of sync. Picture is somewhat blurry.
This could be an R5 rip, but it is NOT a real DVD rip."
[V],Hackulus,2012-04-26T06:39Z,@craddle no m8 its been fixed now ;) Enjoy
[V],Hackulus,2012-04-26T06:44Z,@davidolsen  audio is perfect and picture is perfect not blurry at all and this IS A DVDRIP not r5 bro
,zoros_dib,2012-04-26T06:52Z,well in the notes Hackulus says that he/she resynced the full audio and that it is in sync now so here's hoping!
,simonb6868,2012-04-26T06:58Z,"Thanks Hackulus for the time to re-sinc as i am downloading now and will get back to all about the sinc.
You can always use VLC and go to Tools>Track Synchronizations>Audio Track Synchronization and tweak it up to 0.500 or what ever fits like 0.450 or 0.550. 
Hope this helps for people that d/l the oos version but will def get back as it's great if people upload versions that need a little fix and then their name gets trusted through out the community.

I can't upload as I have way too slow band width but will seed at least 1:1"
,jsuga19,2012-04-26T06:59Z,great upload! audio-10 video-10
,jzenman23,2012-04-26T07:01Z,Doesn't look like the audio is out of sync for me. I tried it on VLC player and K-Lite. The other two seem out of sync but not this one.

Why is it that gay fairy nerds in USA sit and dream about getting super powers instead of getting some steroids and go to the gym?
If I was a gay fairy nerd I wouldn't go home after getting bullied and write a comic or script about gay fairy nerds getting super powers. I would start working out and perhaps train in MMA."

,ThaitGuy,2012-04-26T23:14Z,"@kjhgviyvoiyoi
steroids make your penis small and balls grow back inside. USA made MMA popular through UFC. Im from the US and im sure what ever country you are from is alot better.

thanks hackulus
kjhgviyvoiyoi enjoy your small ego, penis and balls."
,violenstsaint,2012-04-27T00:15Z,"@Thaitguy steroids don't make your penis smaller nor make your balls go back in, in fact working out will make your penis bigger but you don't need to take steroids will help to make it bigger but  all you really have to do is work out the reason beyond this is because working out increases your blood flow and the more blood getting to your penis will make it increase in size and thickness. but steroids aren't good for you which im sure you know, work out for a few months and you will notice a difference in your size.

,Shayed13,2012-04-27T06:51Z,"This took a REALLY long time to download considering the seeds. And no it wasn't my internet I ran a speedtest just prior to downloading. It does however have the proper audio sync, which the other torrent I tried did not. So as far as the actual file itself goes:

Audio: 10
Video: 9"

If you haven't properly opened your ports, you haven't tested shit."
,nogloryrory11,2012-04-27T13:04Z,"Tried to play in on HDTV via USB and can't get any sound. I've had it once or twice before with these sort of files ?? 

Disappointing really, coz I don't wanna watch it on my small laptop screen. I'll have to wait for another file. Seeded to 1.1 though, and visual looks good, lol."
,rayador,2012-04-27T16:12Z,Perfect Audio and video. Thanks a lot!

That's a good idea, I didn't even think of that, i'll give it a go. I was hoping someone might come up with a useful suggestion, thanks :)"

,Catsar,2012-05-06T03:23Z,Ok I have d/l alot from this site but just started burning recently and have some questions about converting.  I used Avi2DVD to convert this copy and the end result came out of sync on the audio is there anyway I can convert it and it stay in sync?  or is there a better free converter out there?  I have been using Avi2DVD for all my conversions so far but am starting to run into some issues with some movies I havent figured out yet.  Any input from the pros?  And as far as the unconverted file d/l from here it looked great A 9/ V 9

,badf101294,2012-05-21T00:48Z,tried to open in divx and media player classic. itll open but wont play... what do i do i am new at this
,felesar2,2012-05-21T14:57Z,"@badf - You could mess around trying to tie new codecs to your existing players. Not difficult for many, extremely painful for others. 
Or you could just go get a copy of VLC. It's free, and plays everything. I used to go back and forth between media players that worked for separate file types. Now I just use VLC, all the time. Plus if something is ever out of sync with the audio, you can use the J and K buttons to toggle the sounds before or after the video, so a couple button pushes and you're usually right where you need to be.
Nice up Hack, although the last one wasn't bad. I actually prefer them a little out of sync, just to make the crybabies troll away at how awful it is. Fun to watch them whine when all they had to do to solve it was use VLC.
Cheers."
