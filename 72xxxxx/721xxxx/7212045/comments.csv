So u can download it and after u can convert them within the massive program using 'KSD batch konvert' into the new file format of massive nmsv."

,shockfiverpm,2012-06-18T07:59Z,"Hey guys just to let you know, I found a trojan in the 1.4 update. 

If you keep extracting files until you get to the 1.4 update .exe and you open that archive you'll find the setup.exe and two other files which my anti-virus found to be the trojan.

You can try deleting them and then installing."
,24609010,2012-06-24T20:23Z,i downloaded it and now i need to choose a program to open it...can anybody help?
,marian99,2012-07-22T02:06Z,"1 - The latest version on the Native instruments's site is 1.3, so, there is no way you can find a more recent version here! There is something very fishy with this torrent, + other users confirmed the existence of some trojans
2 - It's known that one of the heads at TEAM AIR has died, cancer (R.I.P.). Many people say that Team Air does not exists anymore, and these are just some impostors spreading viruses taking advantage of the well known name! (makes sense with this torrent )
I am also puzzled :(, can't find it anywhere without heaving bad comments (viruses or fake negative comments from, probably, Native Instruments officials trying to fight against piracy )"
