,tflagger997,2012-05-23T17:47Z,"""How on earth is this file over three and a half gigabytes? ""

It is because some 'people' think that large file size = good.  
What they do not pay attention to, is that stretching actually degrades the picture quality.  So ANY TS -> DVD will be CRAP just based on the file size alone.  It is NEVER DVD quality, just DVD size.

So much for the green skulls actually meaning anything..."
