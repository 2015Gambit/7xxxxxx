,koemanmag,2012-04-27T00:58Z,"I believe that this have the 2 versions, 32 and 64 bits. Let's seed, i'm at 95% without any seeders at the moment :(
if i download this today i can answer all your questions about this, hehehe"
,morphious666,2012-04-27T01:51Z,"ok bad news, This is Not Extended version ( at least 64 bit is not ) and it is a version from 3/15/2012 20120315.r.428 Sorry guys, not the final release :-(

Have a look at the image he uploaded, the Extended version Would have a 3D and Analysis drop down in the tool bar... Nice try though.. 

Same version as ChingLiu uploaded with PainterR patch :-( "
,cpaube,2012-04-27T02:04Z,This Not extended version...
,koemanmag,2012-04-27T02:09Z,Yes i confirm it.. version 64 bits not extended :(
,LJUSALF,2012-04-27T02:27Z,"As I could see this is the same as ChingLiu uploaded earlier+ hostfiles, right?

Does that mean that ChingLiu`s version does´nt run properly?"
,ibomb909,2012-04-27T03:47Z,dont download....
,cor6un,2012-04-27T11:39Z,"how install, he want serial number"
,leigh_d7,2012-04-27T12:09Z,"Its rather strange if you Install both 64 and 32bit version. you get the extended version in both.

However if you just install the 64bit version no 3D.

Tried and tested."

,panchopancho,2012-05-19T22:35Z,"Basta con tutte queste storie: Nikita200 é tra i migliori.
Le DLL sostituite dalla patch sono le stesse di quelle di TheThingy.
Di seguito metto delle note che aiuteranno per l'installazione (per me hanno funzionato):
1-Installare versione ""Try"" con connessione Internet (dopo aver modificato hosts file).
2-Creare Adobe ID con email anche fasulla.
3-Aprire Applicazione e verificare se é OK.
4-Disattivare Antivirus ed applicare Patch.
Certo le indicazioni sono in italiano e non in inglese, ma serviranno ai miei connazionali. Per gli anglofoni: come io faccio fatica con l'inglese si diano da fare con l'italiano.
GRAZIE Nikita200"
,SiegHeilforever,2012-07-19T12:58Z,"i hope it has the 3d tag, otherwise i will write an angry comment"

,SiegHeilforever,2012-07-19T23:47Z,can anybody please give me a link with 3d please?
