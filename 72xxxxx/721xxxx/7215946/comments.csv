,anu24592,2012-04-26T05:14Z,it more looks like zoomed version of 'a better' Cam print. but definitely not 720p!
,heavydiamond,2012-04-26T09:08Z,amazing quality cam tnx
,aiigghht,2012-04-27T06:39Z,"TS and cam's should not be posted in high res, even if your source was 720p or HD camera. If its not high quality it shouldn't be here."
,KrazyAttack,2012-04-27T12:28Z,6 comments and not one with V/A ratings. Guess I'll give it a shot anyways.

,KevinCostner,2012-04-29T20:02Z,Best version I've gotten so fat.  Audio gets a bit out of sync at times but nothing major.   V-8. A-8 
,pjrib77,2012-04-30T10:52Z,"TS CAM is not HighRes !!!

IS IT THAT HARD TO UNDERSTAND ?????"
,fingerbun,2012-04-30T12:17Z,"About as good as cam gets. Thanks for the upload. Unfortunatly the movie itself is horrible. Not funny at all...

m-5 (would have gave a 2 but +3 for topless scenes)"
,ManuelRivero,2012-04-30T21:19Z,"to the idiots shouting ""this isn't 720p"". Go ahead and ask TPB to make a CAM/TS section:
http://thepiratebay.se/contact
It's not froggie's fault. This is a 720P TS likes it says in the title, and TPB puts it here in the high-res section.

STOP HACKLING POSTERS AND ASK TPB TO CREATE A CAM SECTION!"
,TheArtOfRuin,2012-05-02T06:43Z,^^^this
,lassik2,2012-05-02T08:03Z,"Sorry but this shit was bad. It seems bearable at first but once you get further in to it, it gets a lot worse. 

Audio goes out of sync. The whole movie skips around and even skips over parts. I've seen the movie already and it actually skips over some pretty funny lines. It doesn't seem like it skips much but there are a few funny parts that just get skipped over completely. It jumps around so much. 

Do not watch this copy unless you feel like you just have to see it now. I would wait for a better copy.

Nothing against the uploader or the ripper. It was a valiant effort but just not worth the watch unless you're desperate. "
,texasheat125,2012-05-03T17:15Z,why ppl never be happy what they get..hey shits heads this is free movies what we are geting..man..like whatever

,rg101,2012-05-05T10:02Z,no cam deserves more than 250 mb/h - fvck everybody posting cam quality in 720p
,keyuchu,2012-05-06T23:20Z,"lol u fck tard, why bother puttin ""720p"" up for a cam? unless ur dumbass too stupid to know 720p stands for 720 pixels blue-ray"
,uthacalthing,2012-05-07T16:11Z,"Sorry to break it to you keyuchu, but you've just shown everyone here that you're actually the stupid fucktard dumbass.

720p means 1280 pixel-wide, progressive scan video.  It's a measure of the resolution of a video file, no matter what the original source is.

In the common aspect ratio of 16:9, that means the source will be 720 pixels high, but quite often it is less than that because of wider aspect ratios of cinema releases, for example 2.11:1.

So now that you've learned what ""720p"" really means...

If I am looking for a CAM release of a movie that isn't going to be out on BDRIP or DVDRIP for quite some time, I would certainly rather have one done with a 720p-capable camera than some old-school 480p Sony Handycam shit.

So, the first place I generally look is for Froggie's 720p uploads, which (not always, but more often than not) are better quality than lower resolution cams of the same movie. Even when they come from the same source as other releases, the upscaling gives you a noticeable improvement, especially on a large (40""+) TV.

The fact that these CAMs are of higher resolution than most others quite rightly entitles them to be placed in the HighRes section, where they can be more easily found by those who want them.

""High Resolution"" does not automatically mean high quality Blu-Ray.  If that's what you're looking for, then search for ""BRRIP"" or ""BDRIP"" instead of ""CAM"" or ""TS"".

Get it now?"
,piizda,2012-05-07T18:43Z,"So, is this CAM rip?"
,fleshm0nk,2012-05-08T01:41Z,crap quality not worth the download at all !!!

,victor.brazil.qwerty,2012-05-17T17:05Z,"@missoula26 Whats the point of insulting people who like this movie. What the fuck are you doing here man? Get a life.

I dont think the movie should be in high-res section even though its 720p. We all agree cam video does not present a high quality picture not matter what reslution it has."

Yeah, everyone appreciates that, but that doesn't excuse the little dipshit from posting it in the wrong category. There's a reason we have categories. No one would be bitching if he'd post this where it belongs. There
s always a risk in torrenting stuff like this, and some people have bandwidth caps and don't want to waste it downloading a cam when they think they're getting good dvd quality video."

Froggy100, thanks for the upload but please stop uploading in the hi-res section.. I go to the ""movies"" section to check recent cams.. I'm not bitching, just do the right thing.. This is at least the 5th time I have come across your cam uploads in the hi-res section.. I thank you for uploading, just stop purposely doing it in the wrong section.. "
