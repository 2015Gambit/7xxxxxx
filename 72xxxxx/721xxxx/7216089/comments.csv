HeroMaster you are a true hero. Keep going with your great job."
,michaelrwatson,2012-04-26T07:40Z,"Has anyone downloaded this and the UnKnOwN version..? How do they compare, particularly with regard to the audio..?"
,blackbones33,2012-04-26T13:07Z,"@ wizzkid1970 just because your a ungrateful micro penis, little man. dont blame others for your short comings, blame your dad for your little problem and i hope i dont see your shit name again."
,cvydas,2012-04-27T19:55Z,"has nothing to do with gratitude, this is clearly not a TS its a fkin CAM and of course mislabeling it gonna piss ppl off, this is bad on the release group WBZ not the uploader"
,drakic,2012-04-28T01:29Z,"It is not TC it is CAM, a very bad CAM!

V - 3
A - 5

Not watchable... Why are you uploading this CAM when there are at least 5 other CAM versions?!"
,blackbones33,2012-04-28T12:53Z,"A telesync is the same spec as a CAM except it uses an external audio source (most likely an audio jack in the chair for hard of hearing people). A direct audio source does not ensure a good quality audio source, as a lot of background noise can interfere. A lot of the times a telesync is filmed in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a professional camera, giving a better picture quality. Quality ranges drastically, check the sample before downloading the full release. A high percentage of Telesyncs are CAMs that have been mislabeled."
