,3htthe,2012-04-27T01:10Z,How did you get this?
,DesiredCarnifex,2012-04-27T01:22Z,Was DDoS'd when I finished the DL. Something seems fishy.
,DesiredCarnifex,2012-04-27T01:35Z,Everything seems to be okay now. Just err on the side of caution since it seems a bit too weird to be coincidental.
,Applegrenade,2012-04-27T06:15Z,"This guy hasn't uploaded eps 1, 2 or 3, so i'll just wait for someone else to upload it anyway, just seems a bit fishy to me since this ep shouldn't be released yet."
,Xenous,2012-04-27T07:50Z,It's legit. Don't know what all the fuss is about. Thanks.
,Hyperion09,2012-04-27T09:29Z,"To everyone wondering: it was leaked on Nick's severs yesterday/last night/whatever, and some people on /co/ managed to find out where they were located and grab it from there. It was originally in three parts: this torrent combines them (so there'll probably be some faults in the ""break"" transitions). And yes, it's legit, I'm watching it now."
