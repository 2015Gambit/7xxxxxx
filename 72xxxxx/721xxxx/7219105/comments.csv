LOL...i think it says ""720x480"" so its not an 720p one...And also want to Say that...its a DVD release....so it great to have a Decent DVD 480p..one...

And if you found 720p...or greater Version...its an DVD upscaled....like this one i hav uploaded...""http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7240755/[Hatsuyuki]_Naruto_Shippuuden_Movie_5_Blood_Prison_[DVD][1280x69""

And if you want the orginal here it is ""http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7240745/[Hatsuyuki]_Naruto_Shippuuden_Movie_5_Blood_Prison_[DVD][848x464""
