,ohcock555,2012-04-27T17:08Z,"great quality sound and video, and a really funny episode (finally)"
,Acl_fabre,2012-04-27T21:12Z,thanks:)
,bapwa,2012-04-28T01:44Z,"Very funny.  To all those that say this episode sucks, go out and work a hard 8 hour day, come home and drink a couple beers, then watch it.  If you're just lazy and sit'n around the house all day, you're not going to be building up the necessary natural endorphins you need to really appreciate south park (or you could just get stoned, that would probably work).  But then again, hey, I'm an older guy, and a big fan of south park.  I can't help but think that this episode was some what reminiscent of some of the episodes from the epic 5th season.

And to top it off, I'll be my usual ""Good Guy Greg"".  The video was extremely high quality for it's size.  I watched it on my laptop (1680x1050) and it looked just fine.  Sound was in sync.  Nice quality.  Muchas gracias to the uploader.  Gotta love the internet.  Fuck the U.S. corporate aristocracy!  Peace out."
