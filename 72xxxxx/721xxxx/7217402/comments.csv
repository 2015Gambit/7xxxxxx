Devil's Film is one of the studios that goes after people for copyright infringement. Evil Angel does the same.

If you're American then be careful. You might get a copyright infringement letter from these cocksuckers."
,scaredkitty89,2012-06-01T13:46Z,Oh and the porn sucks as well. Not worth a download to anyone. Most of these companies who send out copyright letters make crappy porn anyway. Don't waste your time.
