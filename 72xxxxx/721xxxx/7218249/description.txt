Aherusia were formed by Voreas Faethon in Athens in 1997, with Evrynomos in guitars, Foibos Apollyon in keyboards, Pontos Oceanos in pipes and bagpipes, Lyda Faesforos in female vocals and Polypimon Damnameneus in battery. During that first period of Aherusia, Voreas Faethon was the main vocalist and also played the bass.
The aesthetic principles, the band holds until the present day, were forged from the combination of the traditional hellenic sound and the progregorian european folkloric tunes under the music manifest of Majestic Black Metal. The band played some underground shows and released independently the ΓÇ£Whispers of MoonΓÇ¥ mini LP in 1999 for a very small number of copies.
During 2000-2003 the bandΓÇÖs activity was frozen, the first line up broke and Voreas Faethon entered the cult north aegean black metal band of Panselinos (based in Mytilene, Lesvos and originally created by Orion Arctorios).
Eventually in 2004 the Aherusian dawnhost gathered again:
From the ashes of Panselinos, Aherusia were formed again with the following line up:
Orion Arctorios~vocals, bass.
Voreas Faethon~guitars.
Arcania~guitars.
Ierax~cretian lyra.
Ichoria~Keyboards.
Polypimon Damnameneus~battery.
Two years later, an unsuccessful recording of the first album and too many shows across the entire Aegean Sea, Polypimon Damnameneus and Ichoria left the band, to be succeeded from Aidhor and Charon.
In 2007 the bandΓÇÖs seat returned back to Athens, where Alchemist an Esperos took the orphaned positions of Orion Arctorios and Ierax, since they could not follow the band due to serious obligations. In early 2009, Shadow was chosen to be the bass player replacing Alchemist.

The present day, Aherusia are promoting their debut ΓÇ£And The Tides Shall Reveal The TracesΓÇ¥,prepare their second album ΓÇ£As I Cross The Seas Of My SoulΓÇ¥ and are also booking shows.
