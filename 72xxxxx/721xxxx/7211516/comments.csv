,michaelrwatson,2012-04-24T19:13Z,"No sample. Hmm. I'd download this if it were less than 400MB, but at almost 700, i'll just download UnKnOwN's and get one that's slightly less recompressed.

@CRYS/TvTeam: h264's main strength is low bitrates, so there's actually not much difference between, say, 695 MB and 350 MB. Not until you drop the video bitrate below 350-400 do you start to see a noticeable drop in quality. I'd also strongly recommend the MP4 package over MKV. Thanks for the effort tho. "
