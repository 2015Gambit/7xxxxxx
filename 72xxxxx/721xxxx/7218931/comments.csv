,Hrvat1941,2012-04-28T14:36Z,"I have the original game, will Steam (or any other) ban me if I play in multiplayer with this?"
,Solyom2,2012-04-29T17:37Z,"Hello
Is it works with the original Warband?"
,emmaella,2012-04-30T07:14Z,"You CAN play online with this version. I have just tried playing multiplayer and it works. To get past the ""Enter Serial"", go to your installed game folder, and look for a ""mbreg.exe"". Run it, select ""Warband"" and that's it. You can now play online. Hope this helped!"
,Buck1800,2012-04-30T15:28Z,"I have opened the""mbreg.exe"" and chose Warband and when i Open the game and go to Multiplayer and NOTHING HAPPENS please help i really want to play online please help me !!!"

,ArmutAsil,2012-05-01T19:01Z,"Works, and english (option).
But this is just multiplayer, nothing more...as you say darkfbk."
,AuroN2,2012-05-02T06:58Z,"As the description says this is a fully working multiplayer version of napoleonic wars
what it doesnt say however, is HOW TO USE THE FIRGGEN CRACK
This is how you do it: after installing the mod/game/w/e
You run the game
Then you tab out, run the crack (make sure its in the server)
And click warband
Then restart it and check it again, try running multiplayer and if it asks ofr a key, you fucked up."
,AuroN2,2012-05-02T07:00Z,"Fun fact: After you've cracked the game, you can easily use the same Mount and blade WARBAND.EXE in your main folder for the main game (AND ANY MODS)
Just copy paste it into the folder
That is, if you installed it into the directory that came with this by default."
,maxim_99,2012-05-02T08:04Z,"Full working multiplayer?
No...
It only offers access to cracked servers, there are currently like 4 running maybe, I can't play with any friends this way, these cracked servers are all hosted in Russia which lag like F*ck.

The full game costs like 10 dollar and offers 100 servers, I just bought it."
,terradon3,2012-05-03T21:14Z,Is this the steam version? How can i update it to 1.003?
,imortaluz,2012-05-04T01:08Z,"This version is OUTDATED and seems to contain viruses!

I've uploaded the newest versions with FULLY WORKING Multiplayer and a new crack that requires no installation or additional trouble:
