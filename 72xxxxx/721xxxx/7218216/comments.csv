,bexwey,2012-04-26T15:24Z,"Hey Gaz, I just registered just so I could tell you thanks!  You do an amazing job!  I think I have downloaded every torrent you have ever put up, this account and the old one!!!  Thanks, you are a star, B xx"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-26T16:01Z,"Thank you!
I first started putting these shows up because I realised no one else was and they are sometimes quite hard to find! And it is soooooooo worth it because a lot of people are very nice to me with their comments and help me out heaps by seeding it for a good period of time. So, all the people who have left the U.K and find it hard to source these shows, I will keep doing my best to upload them as fast as I can :)"
,babyrube,2012-04-26T20:01Z,Thank you so much! You are so so nice.
,bexwey,2012-04-27T12:03Z,"Yeah, I am in Spain, so I would miss all these shows if it wasnt for you. Thanks again Gaz xxx"

,HDrocks,2012-04-30T00:46Z,"Thanks Gary, could you upload season 1 of towie?"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-30T01:13Z,"I won't upload it until both current seasons of MIC and TOWIE are finished. Otherwise it will slow everything down for everyone! A whole season can take 2 or 3 days for just 1 other person to download completely and I would have to pause the uploading of it due to the demand for the newer episodes! 
Sorry I can't help just yet."
