,mamo2xs,2012-05-08T00:40Z,"The torrent is corrupt cannot use. It asks for a freakn password. Downloaded Winrar, but still cannot open!!!"
,mamo2xs,2012-05-08T00:42Z,If anyone has a version not in RAR please put one up!!! I used the trial and really like the newer version! : )
,slybulldog,2012-06-11T09:02Z,"Works great! Password is in the text document that is named password (for those that couldn't figure it out for some reason). just unrar to where you want , send a shortcut to the desktop, and play, no install needed. :) Plays fine with no issues. Thanks!"
,lovelylogic,2012-07-03T02:50Z,played for a couple weeks then my anti virus detected a trojan horse downloader when I went to open it again one day..not sure if its embedded in the game or if that was just a malfunction ... just thought I would warn you
