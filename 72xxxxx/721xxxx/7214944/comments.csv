,x2Phrack,2012-04-27T03:57Z,"this is mainly just for collectors,  but to get it to run, many say that they used VMware and searching google for ""how to install windows 1.0 on a virtual pc"" helps also"
,bert16,2012-04-30T04:44Z,"Clearly it's just for collectors. Obviously there's no practical use for it today. I don't think getting it to run under VMWare won't be all that tough - after all, DOS would be the OS, not this copy of Windows. I only wonder about compatibility with today's hardware (even under VMWare), and if it'll run on anything newer than DOS 3.3 - just curious, that's all."
