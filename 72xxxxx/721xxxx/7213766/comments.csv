,abj642,2012-05-01T15:19Z,"@ajaxen94
sad to hear that this site is blocked in UK. I hope you know how to circumvent the block or you will continue uploading in the other site."
[T],ajaxen94,2012-05-01T17:06Z,"hi abj642, i don't know how soon they are going to block TPB only the top 6 ISPs have been ordered to block it, unfortunately i am with one of those and i do not know how to get around it, but for anyone who can't access Demonoid i also upload to Kickass Torrent under the same user name so if it's blocked before Murdoch is finished they can still get it from there"
,abj642,2012-05-01T18:19Z,"hello madam thanks for the information. i will be following you over demon
to circumvent you just need to use a proxy. i will pm over demon various links of proxies which you can try. i am unable to post links here"
