Continuing the expansion of its popular unscripted programming, Syfy will bring the international hit ""Total Blackout"" - a half-hour game show which places contestants in complete darkness to compete in challenges -- to its prime time schedule in 2012, it was announced today by Mark Stern, President of Original Content, Syfy, and Co-Head of Content for Universal Cable Productions. The eight episode order comes from FremantleMedia North America (American Idol, The X Factor, America's Got Talent). Total Blackout will begin production in Los Angeles on October 18, and will be hosted by Jaleel White (Family Matters, Grown Ups). Total Blackout is a comedic game show in which contestants battle each other and their fears in a series of challenges. However, there is a twist -- all the challenges are played in complete darkness. There are no lights, no blindfolds and no-holds barred as the players face their fears and unexpected surprises in a series of nerve-wracking games. (Source: Syfy)
