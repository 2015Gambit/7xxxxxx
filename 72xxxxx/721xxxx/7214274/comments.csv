,Funnybook,2012-04-27T18:13Z,"YEAH thanks for the avi! I get these for my mom and they have to play on a regular DVD player, so mp4 and mkv and so forth are no good.  And some of them don't even tell the format so I have to start the torrent just to find out, and that sucks.  So THANKS AGAIN for the avi share, ettv!"
