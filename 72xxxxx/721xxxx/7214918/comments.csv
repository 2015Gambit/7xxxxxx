,Nimh,2012-04-25T10:58Z,"ok ok , Antarctica?  Do penguins get good DSL connections? Does the thing monster still live down there?   (i still think australia) 

Anyway, cheers for getting this out quicker.  I still dont understand how there can be only 1 torrent available.  Some guy gave you crap last week but where else to get it???  (not being a member of some USENET or registered secret torrent group)"
,Nimh,2012-04-25T11:00Z,Also i have to say this stupid fucking thing wouldnt be required if i could pay for HULU. US citizens get it free. I would pay a reasonable amount to use it. Its complete bullshit. 
,thagoatster,2012-04-25T11:53Z,Thanks again dude :):)

,1rontorr,2012-04-25T13:09Z,"@nimh, get a brain, it is an American show, no Penguins outside the zoo, dweeb"
