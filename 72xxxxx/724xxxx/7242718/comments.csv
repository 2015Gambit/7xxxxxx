,panosol,2012-05-05T16:33Z,"ok, i saw the trailer, and that's it !!!!!! its ridiculous in every way !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! waste of time..."
,randallytxt,2012-05-05T17:42Z,"Only jerks can call this cheap little movie awesome. The so-called special effects with ridiculously portrayed ferocious little and not so little animals are laughable. I can imagine a producers son telling his father: Dad, Id like to make a horror movie about animals attacking people. OK, son, here is 500 bucks, make your movie..."
,brane1981,2012-05-06T06:47Z,Bez veze trailer je totalno glup a isto tako i film..
,tommyhawkster,2012-05-06T07:14Z,"Looks like a movie made for a high school film project.  Nope, more like a middle school film project.  "

,abjater,2012-05-13T01:12Z,Utter rubbish.  Unrealistic in any and every way.  Special effects *puke* 
,ghostrx,2012-05-14T19:50Z,Thanks!
,bjlowe,2012-07-14T20:51Z,"The people saying stuff like effects are rubbish and its a stupid movie, well what did you expect with a movie like this? a masterpiece? This movie was made like this on the cheap, its a silly b grade trash that their is a massive fan base out there for. Get a few beers and a few mates around and watch this is so so funny, its one of those so bad its good movies!!!!"
,mpup54,2012-08-05T19:05Z,"The masterpiece would be a movie called Wild Beasts (1984). Im sure that movie paved the way for others.
