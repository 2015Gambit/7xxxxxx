We have shot a short film, set in a post-apocalyptic world. The plot revolves around a small band of survivors, stuck together and pitted against a world filled with danger and decay. But beneath the surface of the survival story, is another, metaphorical layer, through which we hope to show the flaws in society that will drag us down and lead to disaster. It is a story about the dark side of humanity, but also about the light side of humanity. Each of our four main characters is a metaphorical embodiment of a piece of our society (politics, the military, big companies/the economy, and the consumerist people) and through their struggles we hope to show how the rotten, decadent parts of our civilisation can be changed to become a force of redemption, steering humanity away from extinction.
