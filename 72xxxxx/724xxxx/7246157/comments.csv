Can you make a complete Garmin Western Europe NT 2013.10 Unlocked IMG with Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland included to.

Thanks"
,NickeNyfiken66,2012-05-07T15:07Z,"How Do I use several gmapsupp.img files and where do I put them on my newer garmin, with a hidden systemfolder for gmapprom.img becuse it didnt work to put a gmapsupp.img there?

Thanks"
,Gates,2012-05-07T17:56Z,"The sync from mapsource will always be gmapsupp.img so you need to rename the existing one to open up the slot.

For any PNA based Garmin unit:

gmapsupp.img (always the default name from mapsource)
gmapsup1.img (additional on SD card)
gmapprom.img (Garmin main memory)

For Garmin XT

all three can exist on the SD card.

Works on my Nüvi 765"
,Ipmark,2012-05-07T18:07Z,"@NickeNyfiken66
You can easily make your preferred map using Gmaptool (free, search it on the web), with the Join function.
Put the gmapsupp.img file on the Map folder (it doesn't exist, you have to create it in the root of the Nuvi 1xxx series only)."

,patricio83,2012-07-21T16:43Z,"Ipmark, thanx for uploading!

One question - is there is difference between partial maps and western/eastern europe? I mean, eg is Cze-Pol-Svk NT 2013.10 Unlocked IMG.rar included within Garmin Eastern Europe NT 2013? or are those completely different maps? thanx!
"
,Ipmark,2012-07-22T09:39Z,I used the same sub-maps so the Cze-Pol-Svk 2013.10 map have the same detail level of the corresponding area of Eastern Europe 2013.10 map.
,bestimmt650,2012-07-23T04:48Z,"I have to disagree with the person that claims that this is ""not the way"" to upload a map file.  These maps work like a charm on my Garmin.  Heading to Europe next week.  This will make life so much easier.  Thanks so much!"

,Ipmark,2012-08-15T16:57Z,You have to create a folder named Map on the root of the SD and put the gmapsupp.img on it.

,FlashM,2012-08-19T15:27Z,"Hi to all of you!

I have a Nüvi 50LM with US & Canada map preinstalled and it works fine, but I like to have Europe maps too.

I have a SD card that I named GARMIN. Then I created a map also called Garmin and there I have now two files.

- GarminDevice.xlm
- gmapsupp.img 

IMG file has western europe, but I like to have eastern europe and scandinavia too.

Where do I have to save eastern europe maps & scandinavian maps? There img files has the same name as western europe.

So now I have three img files and I like to have them on my SD card all the time."
,FlashM,2012-08-19T15:33Z,"Second Q?

My Nüvi 50LM has USA & Canada maps installed but why I can't see the img files. When I look in PC my Garmin I find different maps:

- Garmin
- GPX
- Help
- Keybords
- POI
- Text

File GarminDevice.xlm is in Garmin folder.

Where do you think img file with USA & Canada maps is?"

,Ipmark,2012-08-19T15:41Z,"@FlashM

You have to set Windows to see hidden files and folders

The preinstalled map is in the (hidden) .System folder"
,FlashM,2012-08-19T15:46Z,"@Ipmark

It doesn't matter. In folder options I check to see hidden files but still I can't find img file."
,FlashM,2012-08-19T15:49Z,"@Ipmark

I found the hidden folder called .System

Folder options didn't help but I hade to show even protected systemfiles. Now I can see everything."
,FlashM,2012-08-19T17:36Z,"@Ipmark

My SD card looks like this:

GARMIN (name of card)
- Garmin (folder)
       - GarminDevice.xlm
       - gmapsupp.img

Where in SD Card can i put other maps?
Do I have to remane other maps (img) or?

Is there a Junction View for Europe to download?
Where to put that file (junction view)?

Thx

"
,Ipmark,2012-08-20T08:36Z,"@FlashM

Your GPS should recognize any map name, try with Map1.img, Map2.img, France.img, etc. in Garmin folder.

JVC file must be in GarminJCV folder and you can found here:
https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7249677/Garmin_City_Navigator_Europe_NT_2013.10_Unlocked_for_Mapsource

Last thing:
Europe NT 2013.20 is out ..."
,Ipmark,2012-08-20T08:39Z,"@FlashM

The correct folder is GarminJCV"

,FlashM,2012-08-20T17:08Z,"@Ipmark - Thx a lot for help and support.

I have a Nüvi 50LM with only 100 MB free space therefore I have to work only with my SD card.

1) How do I know which Garmin version have all europe on it? Some files are about 2 GB some others about 4 GB.

2) I will make a folder called Map on my SD card. There I will put Full Europe 2013:20 Unlocked (your file om tpb)

3) Where on my SD card do I put JVC file? Do I make a folder under Garmin (root) or under folder Map?

4) If map version is 2013:20 but JVC 2013:10 do they work together or do I have to have same versions on both?

Last question.

My Nüvi 50 supports Lane Assistens and Junction View. Is there Lane Assistans inkluted on JVC or is it a seperat file that I have to download."
,FlashM,2012-08-20T17:35Z,"@Ipmark
