,Ignignot78,2012-09-12T15:10Z,I wish TPB had a + or - for comments like BT Junkie had. So when fucktards like Tito27 (who the fk makes their handle after the worst of the Jackson 5?) have enough negatives their inane and moronic comments get hidden from the view of normal people. Will comment on A/V after DL.
