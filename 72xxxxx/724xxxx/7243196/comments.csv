,rusher3655,2012-05-05T23:09Z,"Howcome when I was trying to watch it before it was fully downloaded (apparently the word I tried to use was banned so I wrote ""watch it before it was fully downloaded"") it last night it started differently than when I downloaded the whole thing? It started with Nick Burkhardt walking into Monroe's hows where Monroe had a friend lying on his bed and he was stuck in his form and he had a bullet in his knee or something like that... I didn't see that at all when I re downloaded it today. (had to re download it because it was late last night and it was downloading slow so I didn't want to wait.)"
