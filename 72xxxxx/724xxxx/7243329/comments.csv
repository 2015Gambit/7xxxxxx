,rdcldrmr,2012-05-05T09:02Z,"""Alien"" means not from this place, and if we all agree that God resides in heaven, then he would be considered alien to earth even though he created it.  :P"
,Sinistar8u,2012-05-05T10:20Z,"try watching all the episodes and then see what you think! This so called god was a being from another planet that our ancestors labeled as god since thy taught us so much. I highly doubt that a supreme being that was supposed to of created this plant flew here in a metal spacecraft, because that's what our ancestors witnessed and said. Hmmm something to think about huh?"
