This is a beautiful song. His nylon string guitar, tuned down a full step to DGCFAD, is slightly out of tune, but his vocals are beautiful.

LYRICS:

So this is how it ends
In separate beds
A wall between us

And this is how it dies
Separate our lives
In hope it heals us

I chose the love of strangers
I chose the fickle crowd
And the woman I wagered

WonΓÇÖt look at me right now, not now

I know IΓÇÖve been like a house cat
Give me this
Give me that

And I know IΓÇÖll be OK
But beg for my attention
Or work for my affection

I just stare and walk away
How can I show you
IΓÇÖd do all that I could do

To show you I adore you, Olivia

And the days go by
In a supplicated style
Hand me the anodynes

Oh Olivia, I still love you
And I know I will 'til I die
And this feels like common madness
Why this wasted life? Come to me

The photographer is lucky;
Does he even know my name?
Does he know IΓÇÖd give it all up,
If I only could be him?
But I used all my chances
And a few after that
Now IΓÇÖm floating in the ashes, Olivia

And the days go by
In a supplicated style
Hand me the anodynes

Oh Olivia, I still love you
And I know I will ΓÇÖtil I die
And this feels like common madness
Why this wasted life? Come to me.
