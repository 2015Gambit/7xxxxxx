Don't waste your time downloading this shit. They look awful. Spend the buck and get it from redbox. "
,garfiel,2012-05-08T13:43Z,"IGNORE, IGNORE trolls like these 2 below that go around bagging other peoples uploads.  They probably have such a sad life they have nothing else to do.  They certainly don’t upload any torrents.

Download an episode if you’re a fan of the stooges and decide for yourself if it’s worth downloading.  Both of the people below seem to want people to go to another site where you either pay one way or another for videos you can get right here on pirate bay free and possibly only available here.

Yeah right I really believe you 2 down loaded and actually looked at an episode

No, they dont ""play quite nicely"". They're all wonky. Every scene looks stretched out and very wide.

Hey, what sort of crap is this? Call it a film internet site; you must be joking, I've noticed much better ones created by kids. Forget it and Google watchfreemoviesonline.4mvtv.com for some actually good stuff."

Yes don't believe everything from everyone up here, especially comments from those two idiots, I hope they don't get together and breed, it would scary.

Anyway they play okay for me just finished getting this torrent.

They are black and white of course and given the age of them the quality is okay and as for any so called stretching they play fine on my TV, and the sound is spot on.  It is a bit unusual seeing them fill the screen instead of only the midde section, looking forward to more please."
