,dieagain20113,2012-05-04T17:30Z,u cant play pirate bay games online except those private server online games like world warcraft or diablo 2 
,Morphesto,2012-05-04T22:19Z,"Ok. So I´ve played the game for a bit now. I have a few complaints about the game. I dont know if its the game itself or my comp.

1. When I saw the first film scene I thought: ""Hmm it´s kinda glitchy. This took most of the fun out of the game.

2. After a while I noticed the sound from my gun had dissappeard.

3. I´ve tried to find the ""jump for a crate to protect my self or from an enemy"" but i cant find it.

4. There are not alot of options in this game. By options I mean. Fast jump from one wall to another or command the others.

5. It was booring and not scary at all...

6. Is this really a resident evil game? What happened?"

,monkey53,2012-05-05T16:20Z,"@dieagain20113 you can play pirated games online, ive been playing cod4 online. all you need is a program called 'Tunngle' , it makes so your computer thinks that a LAN cable is plugged in and you can play on LAN with other people that have Tunngle"
,omegaviper,2012-05-05T22:33Z,@dieagain20113 pirate bay games? are you an idiot?  you cracked games which is what I said.  and you can if you have a mini image but most of the time you can't play if you only have a crack which is inferior to mini images ( I really don't get why the pirates don't use mini images as the default) anyways I still have don't have a good answer as to whether I need tunngle or not but I assume I do.

,Cerebral222,2012-05-08T10:18Z,"Game works well for me. I've had no issues with installing or playing, I did use another crack though:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7247094/Resident.Evil.Operation.Raccoon.City-Only.Crack-SKIDROW
just use the RaccoonCity.exe, don't worry about the other file. Thanks HeroMaster, nice upload as usual, +1 rep, Cheers."

,farhananjumaj,2012-05-11T05:46Z,Im having same ERRORR..... GAME HAS STOPPED WORKING ???? :(
,HSuperV,2012-05-13T16:14Z,Jesus WTF is this a RE game I don't think so this is HORRIBLE I hope RE 6 will be good because this is just a fucking fail I don't know who bought this but I'm very sorry this is exactly why I support pirating to first check out the game than to buy it because this isn't worth 1 penny.
,Araxnofilos,2012-05-17T21:06Z,''this application has failed to start because xlive.dll was not found.Re-installing the game may fix the problem''  HELP PLEASE!!!
,BayGhost,2012-05-18T23:58Z,"@Morphesto
1. I didn't see any glitches in the first film scene, so I don't know what could be causing them.
2. Yea, that happens from time to time, but in my case it just gets muffeled, it doesn't dissapear completely. Although it does if you're playing it first time, it stops doing that after some time you've spent in the game.
3. Try using Shift+E while running towards a box. Your character is gonna throw himself to the ground, providing you cover via the object you were running towards to, and then when he gets up, he's automatically gonna take cover(if i understood your question correctly).
4. Yea, I noticed that you can't command others and that bothered me since the AI in the game is pretty bad because they're relying on the fact that the game is too fun to be played solo, and so it is. I'm just waiting for a PC release, since we always get everying a little later. 
5. Well it wasn't scary, because of the fact that you're not playing it alone. Some of the parts of the game can't be done without friends or bots, even if they are just sitting ducks :) Anyways this wasn't supposed to have much horror in it, but heavy multiplayer action. 
6. Well i liked this game, and i'm still playing it, because it fills the story of Resident Evil 2 and 3 quite nicely. I just think that Capcom released this before re6 to get the hype up, or for people to have some fun before they finish so they don't feel rushed and fuck it up, since it's probably gonna be the last part of it. Any more parts would be overusing it I think."
,cyanblu3,2012-05-19T09:38Z,I don't think you can tuungle this since this game does not have any LAN features
,leocabano,2012-05-24T17:32Z,"Is it a joke ? First i get no SKIDROW file in the .iso file. Then, event using another crack, i can't start the game. I get this error message : ""The application was unable to start correctly 0xc00007b"""
,innocentreknown,2012-05-26T05:53Z,"Attention!!:This game runs well but there's one big problem which is the weapon sound it keeps dissapearing after you die in the game

Summary:
1. The game works fine
2. But the weapon sound dissapear after you die in the game.

Could someone have a fix for the weapon sound
[Thank You]

,Woodah123,2012-06-18T12:50Z,Note: To those having the black screen problem i had this problem when i didn't have WLIDSVCM.exe google that with raccoon city or w.e and find a download that will repair your windows live ID service manager its for logging in to certain games that use windows live as an anti-piracy measure i remember battlestations pacific used it and i bought it from steam so i tried running it and had the same problem with that game too so most likely thats your guys problem with the black crash and Game has stopped working or responding etc.
