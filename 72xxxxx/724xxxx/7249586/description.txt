In the end - pathetic fight with the leader. Hide the monotony and moving to suppress the brain helps depression frequently changing interiors. Psychiatric hospital, tall building site business center, underground drug labs, a huge cargo ship, the eminent rapper recording studio, dark catacombs, the Opera House (a fire-breathing (!) Dragon on the stage and bandits dangling from the scenery, like a bunch of grapes) ... Without them, arcade "soaking" the enemies for a long time has passed to a sweet sleep. What to do guardians of the law in his spare time storilayna? And the same things in True Crime: Streets of LA, - disclosure of randomly generated crimes. Household and street showdowns, car theft, arson, crazy citizens with guns in the office, counterfeiters, terrorists - the tip of the iceberg of the criminal. Catching drug dealers generally arranged as one of the unofficial mission: the search for clues in the apartment of poor, who died of "overdose", turns into a hunt for a whole team of manufacturers of white poison. Finally, Reed is free to search the pockets of any New Yorker or the trunk of a particularly suspicious car (do not forget to bring "crust").
