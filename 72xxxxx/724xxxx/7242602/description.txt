FOR THE FIRST TIME in Spellman history, Isabel Spellman, PI, might be the most normal member of her family. Mom has taken on an outrageous assortment of extracurricular activitiesΓÇöwith no apparent motive. Dad has a secret. IzzyΓÇÖs brother and sister are at warΓÇöfor no apparent reason. And her niece keeps saying ΓÇ£bananaΓÇ¥ even though she hates bananas.
