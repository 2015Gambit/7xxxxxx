he Dungeon Defenders Development Kit allows you to make Mods and Total Conversions for Dungeon Defenders. I want to point out right away that Dungeon Defenders and its Editor are based on (a customized version of) Unreal Engine 3, so if you really want to dig deeply into what you can do with the Editor tools or gameplay code, you should read up on the Unreal Developer Network about the Unreal Engine 3 tools. Dungeon Defenders is based on a pretty recent version of Unreal Engine 3, so 95% of the information on Epic's robust wiki are entirely applicable to editing Dungeon Defenders.
