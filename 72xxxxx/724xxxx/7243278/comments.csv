,c0ldpr0xy,2012-05-05T05:57Z,"I am downloading right now from ETTV, VTV and EZTV and none of them seem have fast DL speed. :/"
,Fangular,2012-05-05T06:29Z,"@c0ldpr0xy You know, I use uTorrent and sometimes I find that when you're downloading a torrent that clearly has a lot of current seeders and leechers but is still inexplicably slow, it can help to stop the torrent and then start it again. (That's how it seems to me, anyway - it's possible I'm just trying to convince myself of this to give myself a sense that I have more control over this kind of thing than I actually do. It can't hurt to try it, though!)"
,fazioh318,2012-05-05T06:50Z,"You mother fuckers, how the hell is it im uploading more than im downloading? Damn, at least seed this shit while you're watching it, by the end of the episode you would upload around 3:1 ratio at least. Instead of just cutting the connection."
,Dono57,2012-05-05T07:45Z,"Never thought I'd see the day when I'd give up downloading from eztv. What the fuck is it with the password encryption these days you stupid fucks? How many times am I going to have to enter a contest or create an account at some stupid socialnetworking site. Nevermind. Just go fuck your ""established"" selves!!"

,jpapertowels,2012-05-05T07:51Z,"@fazioh318: Except when you're in Canada and your ISP gives you 8 mbit download 0.3 mbit upload. :( Chances are, you grabbed the torrent within a few hours of being available. There's so many people downloading that the upload from a lot of us can't cover it. Be patient and your download speed will go up in no time. Once I had enough data to reach 30 KB/s upload, my download shot up to 200 KB/s."
,logan444,2012-05-05T08:10Z,"Total agreement with Dono57 man, password protecting stolen data so that you can force people onto your stupid site? Easiest thing about your torrents is the choice to not download them."
,mcbri,2012-05-05T08:18Z,@dono you are  a stupid fuck and so is anyone who actually believes you...
,MisterLL,2012-05-05T20:26Z,"Thanks again eztv! You are the 'go to guy' for Fringe episodes, et cetera."
,3dot14,2012-05-05T21:13Z,Thanks!
,chaletamale,2012-05-06T10:21Z,has a super annoying watermark at the bottom right that ruins the picture. normally i dont have a problem with watermarks but this one is almost in the middle of the damn screen and bright white so it ruins the entire mood of the show.  do not download. find another file
,milkyb,2012-05-07T08:05Z,thx
