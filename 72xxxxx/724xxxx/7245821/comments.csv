,johniedoe,2012-05-06T15:24Z,"I may have been mistaken.

I did download a torrent with the same name.

Went to find it again and got 404 not found.

searched PB again and this was the torrent I found.

Looking at it now I see that it is a different size and is not compressed.

Guess I was not the only one who got duped."

,Ohne,2012-05-08T16:38Z,Why no AVI !!!??!?!?!?
,dbolic,2012-05-30T07:01Z,People should chill and stop complaining when there are free files to download.(ex. stop adding usleess readme files or why not .avi?).  If the person wants to add a freakin readme file it is all good(it's only 2.8kbs what the hell).  When you upload a file you can exclude any extra files you want.
