,jdizzle22,2012-05-08T21:46Z,I would be careful with this download if I were you...121 KiB size is very suspicous. Also a not well known user with only a couple torrents starting yesterday. I smell virus. Anyone want to find out for me :)

,0770,2012-05-26T19:32Z,"Its old version, I've just uploaded the updated"

What's the big problem? Get Avast mobile edition and scan it."
