Nothing too fancy, just filling a gap left by the scene groups from the other night for those who actually want XviD releases or who like myself can't stand the LOL/DIM faked-from-Canada that they put out night after night for most every show. Last Friday they released The Finder and yet it wasn't even broadcast in Canada and still the scene group's nukers let it through as acceptable. Faking capping from Canada is one annoying thing but creating a fictional broadcast is a bit much for most peoples' sanity.

As the team meets with the executed killerΓÇÖs ex wife in a search for suspects, the UnSub begins to escalate his plan. While the first two women murdered are found with cut hair, the third is discovered with a shaved head. The fourth body is found after having been scalped entirely.
