i dont have a seed box so i'll provide maximum initial seeding but for the torrent to be alive please seed back too"
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-05-04T13:19Z,"Why are you copyright the public picture?

It not a true pirate manner.

Are you soon put watermarked torrent here?
"
[V],sujaidr,2012-05-04T13:51Z,"@Zen_Bud,i am not sure what do you mean but if u mean the scorp watermark which comes for a minute,that is purely done for genuinity of the rip,i cant help it,my own encodes dont have a watermark but scorp has been includin a watermark in his rips for quite sometime and guys who want scorp rips dont mind it actually and it doesnt hamper the viewing experience"
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-05-04T15:30Z,"Pirates donÂ´t use watermark, or put name in public pictures ( the cover )

:(

[V],sujaidr,2012-05-04T16:07Z,"@Zen_Bud, i dont know how to respond to it...after all we r here for our love of movies and i do this so that i can share movies with my friends.
i always thought that being a pirate was a cool rebel kinda thing,didnt know even this had so many rules....
anyway we r in a public torrent site so there r not any strict rules to be followed like for the scene groups etc....i think i follow the basic rules of all public torrent sites :)"
,justregged,2012-05-04T19:03Z,"Maybe u dont know this already but zen_bud is a knobhead. In the past he created multiple accounts to back himself up in various arguments and also went onto others torrents spamming them. The only reason he is commenting on scorps releases is because they are superior to his own, its called jealousy. Sad really. Probably the best way to respond to this guy is not to entertain him.

Thanks for this torrent and have a nice day A/V 10/10"
,shankar55,2012-05-04T19:13Z,dude i have a doubt does scorp does'nt have a ptb account
[V],sujaidr,2012-05-04T19:43Z,"@shankar55,nope he doesnt have and he doesnt do torrents,only direct downloads so i started uploadin his releases on torrents as i am a huge fan of his rips and many want his rips....now i get only the blockbusters of his and the rest i encode"
,[qusawa],2012-05-05T08:47Z,"Zen_Bud you are right!
DonÂ´t bother off the idiot:)
watermark and copyrighting picture is NOT pirate way or style:("
