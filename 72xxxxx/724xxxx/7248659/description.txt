Number twelve, just like the ladybugs' picnic. This week on The Whipped Panther, discussions on the moon and the last six letters of the english alphabet. Possibly even the first ever 90's Knife Fight tie, but you'll have to listen to find out. The Whipped Panther does not own the rights to any of the material played. Enjoy.
