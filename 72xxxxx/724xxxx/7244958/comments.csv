,RafVne2,2012-05-11T06:30Z,"I ran it on Xp x86. It works fine except the 3D tab isn't there, even though it does say ""extended"" on the splash screen while loading. ""Use graphics processor"" option is checked. Any ideas?"
,RafVne2,2012-05-11T06:42Z,"I'm sorry, I just noticed this line which I have missed before...
""3D features and some GPU-enabled features are not supported on Windows XP. ""

Which is suprising though.... Photoshop CS5.5 portable works fine...

Frankly I have never even used 3D capabilities, but I just like to know that it's there if I'll need it."
