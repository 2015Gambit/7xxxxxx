Run a own TPB proxy for broken nations.

Added README-TPB2.txt

README-TPB.txt was writted by an other TPB mod.
Changes I did was to download the latest cgiproxy, version 2.1.3 as the
one in the orginal torrent wasnt the latest and it logged some php notices.
It as also some errors in the config. They are now fixed.
I use Linux CentOS myself. If you use something else, you might have to do
some changes.


Changes in my httpd.conf:
-------------------------

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
Listen 1.1.1.1:80
NameVirtualHost 1.1.1.1


Changes in my vhosts.conf (you can put this in httpd.conf if you want):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<Directory "/www/tpb.domain.tld">
DirectoryIndex nph-tpb.cgi
AllowOverride None
Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>

<VirtualHost 1.1.1.1>
        ServerName tpb.domain.tld
        DocumentRoot /www/tpb.domain.tld
        ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/error_log
