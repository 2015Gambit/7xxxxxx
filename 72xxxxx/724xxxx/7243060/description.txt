Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, May 4 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about Obama's re-education camps and the plan to eliminate millions of Americans. 

He also talks with legendary musician and American icon Charlie Daniels. Charlie is a fierce critic of the Obama administration and has spoken out against Agenda 21. "The politics of globalism is not to better the human condition, but to control it," Daniels said recently. His latest album CD is The Land That I Love and he has also released a CD single entitled "Let 'Em Win or Bring 'Em Home." 

Alex also talks about Ron Paul's sweep in the delegate process and police caught in the act of drugging protesters. 

Joel Skousen, editor of World Affairs Brief and author of Strategic Relocation: North American Guide To Safe Places, talks with Alex.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
