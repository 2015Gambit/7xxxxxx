Introducing the Most Effective Body Recomposition Plan Ever CreatedΓÇª
They say itΓÇÖs physically impossible to lose fat and build muscle at the same time. And they were rightΓÇª until now. The Renegade Diet makes this possibility a reality by presenting an alternative approach, based on millions of years of evolution, that goes against EVERYTHING youΓÇÖve ever learned or believed to be true about nutrition.
Your body was designed for and adapted to a certain style and pattern of eating that has nothing in common with what most people do today. When you ignore this and follow standard diet advice you end up fatter, smaller and sicker. Statistics show our hunter-gatherer ancestors to have had significantly more muscle and less body-fat than the average person does today.  There were also fewer chronic diseases like those so prevalent nowadays. Before you can worry about fat loss, muscle gain or enhanced performance youΓÇÖve got to get healthy first. Once you get healthy everything else falls into place.
To gain muscle without the fat, or get ripped while keeping your hard earned size, youΓÇÖve got to unlearn all youΓÇÖve been taught about ΓÇ£healthy eatingΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£proper nutritionΓÇ¥ and embrace the ways of The Renegade Diet. The future of high performance nutrition has arrived.
