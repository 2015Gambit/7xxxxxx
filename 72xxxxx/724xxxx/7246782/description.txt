Version update:
Banished the stair death! If it is not gone (which hopefully it is) stair death should be MUCH less common now. This does not include falling from high floors through careless walking near edges, perhaps unfairly in certain buggy circumstances like missing bannisters.
    Main menu + stories back in. K&B is a little broken now no need to report bugs on it.
    Compatible with saves down to M only!!
