Aranda fans should find the Oklahoma City-bred band's sophomore album worth the four-year wait, for it's certainly worth its sonic weight in gold, bringing on a 10-song load of the kind of hard-edged, guitar-driven, melodic, made-to-be-played-loud music that distinguished their 2008 self-titled debut.

You won't confuse the title song with the Anthony Newley stage musical of the same name when drummer Mike Walker stomps out a four-count on that bass drum, setting Dameon Aranda's guitar into grinding motion while Dameon and brother Gabe's voices begin to soar: ΓÇ£I've laid with fools / Shook hands with the devil to break free from the rules ΓÇª ΓÇ¥ Definitely not one of your Granny's favorite show tunes.

Nor is the album's single release, ΓÇ£Undone,ΓÇ¥ with its wailing-wall of guitar, nimble-fingered, high-register solo runs and vocal-harmony drama. One begins to get the notion that someone knows the pain of betrayal and heartbreak from the angry power-balladry of ΓÇ£SatisfiedΓÇ¥ and the equally angry but much more rapid-fire rocker ΓÇ£One More Lie.ΓÇ¥

If nothing else, the music these brothers make can certainly telegraph what feels like honest emotion. The blues-tinged ΓÇ£Hey Sally,ΓÇ¥ with its warbling Hammond B3 organ (courtesy guest keyboardist Dan Walker) and Memphis-R&B-influenced rhythm guitar work is another prime example of that quality, painted in colors vaguely reminiscent of the Stones' ΓÇ£Black and BlueΓÇ¥ period, although it won't force Mick and Keith into retirement.

Helmed by Grammy-nominated producer Johnny K (Disturbed, Sevendust, Staind), ΓÇ£Stop the WorldΓÇ¥ is a worthy follow-up to their debut, and Aranda will celebrate it with a CD release show at 7 p.m. Saturday on the stage of the Diamond Ballroom, 8001 S Eastern Ave. [by Gene Triplett from NewsOK]
