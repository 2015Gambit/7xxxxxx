,SNSDfag,2012-05-05T21:38Z,At least it has sound you niggers
,SirHat,2012-05-06T08:44Z,"The end of the episode is cut off weird. It feels like there should be more.  It'd be nice to see the credits/NEXT TIME ON KORRA.

Decent quality otherwise."
,andrewmyles,2012-05-06T19:00Z,"Great quality, although could you (if possible) not cut the video before the ending credits? The music is actually decent in this. "
,megate,2012-05-06T23:38Z,"the reason i seem to just cut off is the program i use to encode popped an error at the end of the encode for some reason but the ending that is there is the full end cause right when it stops is when it jumps to the credits so i left it cause it was the full ep

@SirHat i dont do credits or previews 

@andrewmyles i try to mak it hoit the credits before stopping the recording"
,jj441,2012-05-07T08:44Z,bad quality don't bother
,Walliance,2012-05-27T21:55Z,"Really bad quality, don't bother."
,Walliance,2012-05-27T21:57Z,"Go for Daman4life's torrents instead, they're actually HD with the same file size."
