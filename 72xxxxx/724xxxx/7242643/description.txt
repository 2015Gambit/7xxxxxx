Testimony on toxins and pollutants at Ground ZeroΓÇôwhich the White House said was ΓÇ£safe to breatheΓÇôΓÇ£ actually contained the following: Over 400,000+ pounds of lead, over 200,000+ pounds of asbestos.  More than enough mercury to contaminate 2,500 city blocks.  Radioactive americium 241 from thousands of smoke detectors, and the highest levels of vanadium ever recorded.  Children in nearby schools have developed serious respiratory problems.  Half of those who cleaned Ground Zero have serious health problems.  Hundreds of firefighters can no longer work; and fourteen rescue dogs have died.
