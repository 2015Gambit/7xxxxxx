Your other upload of this has been deleted."

,jaspertjie,2012-05-14T11:53Z,Why'd you upload the same thing as I did? It seems rather... useless.
,AggieKnothead,2012-05-23T00:59Z,because yours wouldnt go past 98% jaspertjie
,jaspertjie,2012-05-28T18:33Z,Then how'd you get the files for this one if you say it's a copy? :P
,AggieKnothead,2012-05-28T19:45Z,found it elsewhere and added it in
