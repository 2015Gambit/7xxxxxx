Storyline

Mumbai-based Kabir Dhiman, 
who comes from a wealthy building construction family, 
proposes to his long-time girlfriend, 
Natasha, much to the delight of both their respective families. 
He then gets together with one of two of his close friends, Imran Habib,
 a writer by profession, 
and they contact their London-based financial broker friend, 
Arjun, to remind him of a pact of traveling to Spain. The trio 
commence their long overdue trip not fully realizing that Arjun 
has still not forgiven Imran for his break-up with Sunani, 
while he himself regrets being dumped by Rohini, 
and must also compete with Imran for the affections of gorgeous Deep Sea Diving Instructor,
 Laila; Kabir struggles to accept life as Natasha's husband; and Imran must ready himself 
to meet his biological father, Salman, who had abandoned him at birth.
