I missed this album the first time around (2008). Timing is a funny thing, for as much time as there actually is, it has an uncanny knack for being extremely precise. Had I come across this album two years ago, thereΓÇÖs a fair chance it wouldnΓÇÖt have resonated as much as it does now; so, I use the word ΓÇÿmissedΓÇÖ quite on purpose as it seems the re-release of China Mountain was timed to show exactly what my Australian winter has been lacking.

Lotte Kestner, the solo project of Anna-Lynne Williams, delivers a down-tempo folk album that is both reminiscent of her work as singer-songwriter with Trespassers William, and distinct enough so as not to be derivative. Anna-LynneΓÇÖs moderately hushed and dreamy vocals also give some welcome warmth and depth to the delicate, gently moving songs. Much like Mazzy Star-era Hope Sandoval, the emotion is largely in the words themselves, and they unravel in a similarly haunting fashion.
