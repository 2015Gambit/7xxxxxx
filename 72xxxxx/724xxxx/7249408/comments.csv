This is the good repack though, right?"

,powers987,2012-05-07T18:20Z,So is this one censored too?
,inex55,2012-05-07T21:03Z,Can anyone please confirm if this release is also censored?
,pickaoo,2012-05-07T21:27Z,"I can confirm that this is NOT censored as far as I know. I haven't watched it yet, but atleast the opening wasn't censored.

A:10
V:10"
,csabaxb,2012-05-07T21:28Z,"Hmm... i have strong PC, others 1080 mkv working well, but this it's only a bunch of colors and some audio. For me not working good. Download 720p version and see the episod."
,micron66,2012-05-07T21:31Z,"@powers987 @inex55

aside from one word in the RECAP, there is NO censoring.  All the curse words, disembowelings, boobs and beheadings are there."
,lurejens69,2012-05-07T21:33Z,"Not censored, and flawless as far as I could see."
,lionfw,2012-05-07T21:33Z,this isnt censored
,BlackSwanf4u,2012-05-07T21:40Z,Then i give it a try and maybee transcode it into a less diskhungry format.
,Pathduck2,2012-05-07T21:42Z,This is the one to get people. 10/10. Cheers Dibya.
,csabaxb,2012-05-07T22:03Z,"Sorry for my earlier comment, my VLC make a crash and that was the problem. Work ok with KM player A/V-9, sorry uploader. Thanx for the up."
,Dgcz,2012-05-07T22:10Z,"@pickaoo

How can you write about video and audio quality if you haven't watched it yet?! Others might base their decisions on that...

For example there's the ""eztv"" 720 rip, which would seems as ""V: 5"" by the first minutes, but later comes 4 or 5 times when it jumps back 15-20 seconds, so that version is useless. 

That is why it would be nice to see experience based opinions "
,o_lindh,2012-05-07T22:40Z,Very good quality. I have no idea if it was censored or not but it contained some ugly scenes. Thanks for the upload!
,dimitrioo,2012-05-07T23:20Z,Seriously I'm downloading from 1 of 50 peers at 10KB/s... People please seed! Thank you 
,Rensnijman,2012-05-07T23:26Z,Are there subs for this download that work?
,greenwheel,2012-05-08T00:01Z,thank the fuck christ for this one. I'm too fuckin spoiled with quality and the 720p made my eyes hurt :-P
,ccoltmanm,2012-05-08T01:14Z,"2.43 GiB for a 1080p hour long release, doesn't make sense."
,severed1314,2012-05-08T01:55Z,@ccoltmanm Then hd is not for you. Stick to shitty quality and small file sizes.
,ccoltmanm,2012-05-08T03:45Z,"@severed1314 That's what I mean. The 720p version is 5.3 GiB and this is half that size? I just don't want to waste bandwith if this is actually worse quality than the 720p, which has 3 times the bitrate."
,ccoltmanm,2012-05-08T03:49Z,"This show airs at 1080i, there is no 1080p Game of Thrones unless they have the BR already."
,addee12,2012-05-08T04:47Z,"can we get someone whos actually watched this give us a A/V + censoring 

also i think its strange this release is so small for 1080p"
,MikeyMetal,2012-05-08T09:17Z,25 out of 1150 seeding. You filthy bitches. Seed you fucking cunts!
,kiwij,2012-05-08T10:30Z,"This should be good quality.  The same uploader uploaded a 5.5GB 1080i version that is high quality, direct rip (not recompressed) and uncensored.  This TV program screens in 1080i, so what he has done is converted the original 1080i into 1080p to reduce the file size for those who can't download 5.5GB highest quality not recompressed version."
,kiwij,2012-05-08T10:33Z,"GoT screens in 1080i

You can watch 1080i converted to 1080P

or watch

1080i converted to 720P then played on a 1080P display (ie it gets converted twice!!!)"
,Plepp222,2012-05-08T20:29Z,"I used http://engsub.net/141296/ for subs.
Worked great.
(need renaming of course...)"
,hmathews8,2012-05-08T23:12Z,"I have downloaded and watched this and can confirm it is the BEST of all the HD versions right now. Not Censored, not HBO Canada, and great quality. 

Only issue is it won't play on a PS3, even converted with mkv2vob. Plugged my laptop into my tv and looked great. 

Download THIS torrent, all of the others suck"
,dr_huffrhurr,2012-05-11T08:40Z,Will not play through my WD TV live network. First file to not work. Interesting...
,kompensan,2012-05-12T18:16Z,"A:10 V:10
