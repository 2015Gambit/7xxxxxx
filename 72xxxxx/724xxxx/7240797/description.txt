From the special effects wizards who brought you
"Star Wars", and "2010" comes this super charged
sci-fi adventure featuring an all star cast that
includes: Tim Matheson, Charlton Heston,
Peter Boyle, Annabel Schofield, Corin "Corky" Nemic,
Jack Palance and Dorian Haywood. Dazzling special 
effects, deep space suspense and grand scale action
heighten the thrills in this epic of the future.
The crew members of the Helios, each with their own
special area of expertise, are on a critical mission
to explore a flare that endangers the Earth. The star
craft is carrying a space probe, loaded with an
anti-matter bomb that is to be shot into the heart
of the sun.
If successful, this bomb could trigger the mega-flare
away from the Earth. But the risks of doing battle with
the sun pale by comparison to the dangers from saboteurs
on Earth. Determined to thwart the mission, they've planted
a traitor on board.
