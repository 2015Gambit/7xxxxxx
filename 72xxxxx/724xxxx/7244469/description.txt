The Training of OToO-19334 Jack Hammer, Alice Kingsnorth, Keira Quinn, Hannah White and Bonnie Day 

 Sorry no Pics



This week we have a fantasy feature shoot with one our community members, Alice Kingsworth, as a featured model.

 San Francisco is plagued with an underground slave trade, yet the missing persons reports have not increased. The media has taken notice with hopes of digging in and finding the truth. In this fantasy we get a first hand look into this dark world, only to see that there is a reason these things go on and why.

 There are four girls caged in an abandoned warehouse like animals, while their trainer and spotter sit by patiently waiting for their next client to appear. He walks in and begins inspecting the merchandise. He picks the one he likes best and the trainer accompanies him to ensure he is getting exactly what he wants.

 The day goes on and he decides that he will keep her for now.
