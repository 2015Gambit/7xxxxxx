Secrets of the Flooded Forest - Danube National Park 
After beginning in Vienna, the Danube riverbank forests extend to the gates of Bratislava, linking the two capitals like a green ribbon, forming a unique wildlife habitat in the heart of Europe. A few years ago a 36 kilometre section was turned into a national park that now protects the last undeveloped stretch of the Danube river and also the last riparian zone of its size in Central Europe. In the forests along the Danube the water's power is able to influence plant and animal habitats again, shuft bodies of water, create gravel banks. Everything here is in motion and subject to constant change. Growth and destruction, birth and death are integral to this landscape, and constitute a vital factor for its great diversity of habitats and species. The variety created as a result is outstanding, as is the sheer numbers of flora and fauna that live here: White-tailed eagles breed in the woods, mud minnows and pond turtles populate the old arms of the river, beavers build their dams on the banks, and red deer raise their young in the underbrush. The Danube National Park: a hidden wilderness full of beauty and drama, and a refuge for an astounding variety of flora and fauna.
