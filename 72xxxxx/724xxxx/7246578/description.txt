This is a complete, unaltered .iso of the Dell Dimension ResourceCD, Rev. A03.  I have used this to install things like network, disk, audio drivers for my Dimension 2400 and 4800.

Dell's website is such a clunker I thought it would be nice to offer a complete resource for you guys trying to beat older computers into submission!

It will likely work for more than just 2400 and 4800, as Dimension boards have a lot of the same parts.

To use, either install a .iso mounter program, or burn it to a disk with the many free .iso utilities.  Windows 7 even has .iso burning built in.
