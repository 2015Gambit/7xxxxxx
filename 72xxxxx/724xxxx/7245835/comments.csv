Only issue I have is that it looks as if someone did a color adjustment on it, and all of the skin tones are very red.  I have a very large library of digital movies that I've ripped from my own DVDs and Blu-Rays or from torrents, and I've never complained about any color issues with anything I've downloaded, so it has to be very significant for me to mention it.  It probably won't ruin the movie, and a person could always adjust their settings on their TV temporarily if it was really annoying, but if you're looking for a good quality 720P copy of this movie for your collection you just might want to consider another copy IF this color issue would bother you."

Boston is hardly where people flock to if they want to soak up the sun and get a tan, so I'm not sure what the director was thinking when he approved the color ;).  "

The quality of them are excellent and the fact that they are so well seeded (at least most of them) speaks volumes about their quality!

I appreciate the ""Box Sets"" of duologies, trilogies, quadrilogies, pentalogies, etc...

Great Work, I appreciate the time, care and bandwidth you have invested in your torrents!"
