,NilsNL,2012-05-07T14:30Z,Lots of censored rips online. Is this also from HBO Canada?
,Antonshka,2012-05-07T15:02Z,It is from HBO Canada. Should I wait for the IMMERSE copy?
,hagoo,2012-05-07T15:22Z,Can anyone confirm if this is censored?
,Blue_Meanie,2012-05-07T16:10Z,Terrible quality rip
,ido172,2012-05-07T16:19Z,quality is not great. plus it is censored... 
,andre1114nz,2012-05-07T17:45Z,"Quality is bad, and it is censored."
,andre1114nz,2012-05-07T18:42Z,actually there was only one case of censoring during the previous weeks scene.
,JJosh_h,2012-05-07T19:21Z,what does repack mean
,BreakingBadFan,2012-05-07T21:07Z,If you see 2HD in the description then it is usually hbo canada which is censored.
,AxBattler,2012-05-07T22:24Z,oh dear.. the quality is quite awful with this one..
,TheBest7,2012-05-07T23:13Z,"When will a decent version (not censored, no lagg, good quality) become avaliable (+/-)?"
,dougmac21,2012-05-08T02:26Z,Ghastly Video Quality. It's like watching VHS upsampled to 720p.
,Balthazar8921,2012-05-08T03:04Z,Better than the other version. video doesnt skip
,rotate_m8,2012-05-08T03:47Z,"pretty poor quality for 720p 1.45gb so far everything ive had from eztv had been awesome tho, cheers for the up. "
,hmathews8,2012-05-08T04:30Z,Quality is pure shit! Wtf eztv?
,BurferTheGreat,2012-05-08T06:23Z,"This version was virtually UNWATCHABLE, skips back every ten minutes or so, no sub can sync correctly to it, and apparently censored.  I will have to re-watch another upl"
,AxBattler,2012-05-08T20:06Z,"Do not DL this.. go here instead:

cheers!"
,WoWx3,2012-05-09T00:47Z,I regret that i downloaded the one out of sync first. This release is good and works well together with subtitles.
,eddlang,2012-05-09T19:42Z,Video quality is rubbish. SANTi release is much better.
,fslaker,2012-05-10T21:08Z,"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7250375/Game.of.Thrones.S02E06.720p.HDTV.x264.AC3-SANTi.mkv

MUCH better, legit 720p without any censored parts."
,dhirallin,2012-05-11T08:04Z,"Does anyone know what was censored out? Because apart from the word 'whore' that was only censored out once in the Recap of previous week's episode, I can't see any other censoring in the actual episode. I mean, they swear and say whore all through the episode, there's full frontal nudity, etc, etc. I think only the Recap was censored."
,dr_huffrhurr,2012-05-11T08:42Z,"@dhirallin   I know right? Canadians are a strange breed.
Whore..................bad
Goat fucker.........good
???"
,dhirallin,2012-05-11T10:20Z,They say whore uncensored in the episode.. just not in the recap at the start.

,f1471in3,2012-05-12T13:34Z,"Bad quality... this ain't 720p, though it's quite OK. The ""SANTI"" version is just perfect, just saying..."
,f1471in3,2012-05-12T13:34Z,This ain't 720p... The SANTI version is just perfect
,ashmatash,2012-05-12T20:48Z,"not good. not good at all

Worst I've seen yet"

cheers"
,Steff320i,2012-05-27T08:49Z,This is from HBO Canada. Not true 720p but artificially upscaled (fake 720p). Very poor video quality. Skips backwards 3 or 4 occasions. I feel cheated.
