Alright guys, I couldn't find Vol. 2 or 3 of PFOS ANYWHERE on the interwebs, so I 
decided to do a favour to all lo's and lette's who have a habit or torrenting. You have no idea how much of a bitch these were to find. I searched far and wide, a week straight, and finally with my water supply running low and going on 4 hours of sleep, I finished. To your ears I present all the volumes of Psychopathics From Out Space.

I am NOT affiliated with Psychopathic Records, or any of the artists listed. 
I am in NO WAY trying to infringe or claim any of this music as my own. 
I got nothing but love for the Wicked Clowns.
