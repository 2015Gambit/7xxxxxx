Songs of the English progressive rock-band fiN. These are all their releases so far, only the cover is ripped, the rest is original. Their debut-album is out due in September, these are pre-releases from the limited 7" vinyls.

fiN is an English band hailing from London that survives by word-of-mouth as they are not signed to any label. Please have a listen, you will not regret it!

If you enjoy the songs, check out the webshop for their cheap 7" vinyl releases and support the band by spreading the word. They perform quite a lot throughout the UK and have supported Mona, Feeder and Incubus in Europe. They are brilliant live and have been compared to bands like Muse, Smashing Pumpkins and dEUs.

Enjoy!
