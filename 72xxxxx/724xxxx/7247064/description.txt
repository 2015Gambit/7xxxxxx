bestpig has released freeBOOT ToolBox Maker V2.9.1: Creation and ECC freeboot for Jtag / Glitch

This update brings:
- The support of the kernel thanks xeBuild 14699.
- Added patches Dashlaunch 2.27
- Update build.py in 1.1 (now compatible with the Falcons)
- Added support for CB 5771 and 6751
- The fcrt.bin is now injected into freeBOOT (If you have a 1175 drive, you must have a source containing the nand fcrt.bin, which is not the case with former freeBOOT generated by my tool.).

Update 2.9.1:
- Adds support for consoles with no DVD player (JTAG only)
- The patch is automatically added fcrt.bin fcrt.bin if not present in the source nand.
