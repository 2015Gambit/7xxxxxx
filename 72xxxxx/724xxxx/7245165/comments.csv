,xcox,2012-05-05T22:46Z,This is the HDTV recording if you guys haven't figured out from the file name.
,Toemme,2012-05-05T22:56Z,"strangely, this torrent doesn't pop up in the search result when I search for 'the spirit of competition', but it does if i search for 'spirit of competition'.

also, this is quite a large file size, even for a HD episode. other HD episodes of this series I have are about 300mb."
,Toemme,2012-05-05T22:57Z,ok well i meant 450 mb^^
,Rezeys,2012-05-05T22:59Z,"Hmm odd why is this file 841 megas? The other 720p's were not larger than 700 megas at most, and that one had 2 episodes."
,Rezeys,2012-05-05T23:09Z,Is it possible to remove comments?
,Rezeys,2012-05-05T23:09Z,Because I think this guy is...

,Senzaxamore,2012-05-05T23:50Z,Please seed! I will too when the download's finished.
,squall14716,2012-05-06T00:10Z,"@MrUnpopular x264 is just an encoder for h264, it's like saying ""It's not LAME, it's MP3"". It's possible that it wasn't encoded with x264, but the h264 label also encompasses x264 as well.

The reason the file size is higher is because it's encoded at a high bitrate. The encoder used is irrelevant."

,memake,2012-05-06T01:34Z,"@MrUnpopular , could you hook me up with the TS potentially?"

[T],MrUnpopular,2012-05-06T02:27Z,@memake TS?
,kAmpRo,2012-05-06T03:26Z,"why when i open the torrent there's no archive in it ? its happening with avery torrent i try to download :(
can anybody help me please ?"
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-06T04:35Z,Whoever ripped this has no idea what they were doing. 
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-06T04:39Z,"TS = Transport Stream.
And most likely, no. No one would take the time to upload a TS of a Nickelodeon show. No reason, too big in size, and waste of time."
,vinz23,2012-05-06T05:57Z,extremely slow download. 0 - 10 kbps
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-05-06T06:24Z,Ah; so transport stream == Nick.com HD rip correct?

,markgri,2012-05-06T10:35Z,@sp910 what did you use to retrieve all that information from a file?
