This fan made soundtrack is maximum AC/DC featuring all of the original Who Made Who's tracks and remastered cuts of every unreleased recording that can only be found in the film, which is quite a lot. This also features some of the film's other audio for a deeper experience. 

Riff 1 is a very dark, mean, hot riff that reminds me of doom / stoner riffs.

Riff 2 is a more mellow classic blues jam kind of riff
