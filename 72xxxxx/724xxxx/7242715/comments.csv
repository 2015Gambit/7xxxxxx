[V],merzedes,2012-05-05T15:14Z,"Currently my videos are available for streaming in the member section of my website. I think it is more comfortable to watch videos instantly, you donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t have to wait for the download, no codecs and player problems, and you donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t need to store the movie files on your hard drive. Of course you need to be connected to the internet while you are watching my movies and you need an up-to-date hardware system and software but I think in the era of broadband internet connections and computer technology it is not a problem anymore.

This are from here site...

Cheers  :-)"
