"Dead Drop"

When it looks like Percy's (Xander 
Berkeley) nuclear weapons plan is 
getting out of control, Ryan (guest 
star Noah Bean) suggests they go to 
the Director of the CIA, Morgan 
Kendrick (guest star Brian Howe), for 
help. Nikita (Maggie Q) is vehemently 
opposed to the plan and is surprised 
when Michael (Shane West) takes Ryan's 
side. Tensions escalate when Nikita is 
proven right after they discover 
Kendrick has a link to Percy. 
Meanwhile, Sean (Dillon Casey) is shot 
by Percy's men, shaking Alex (Lyndsy 
Fonseca) to the core.
