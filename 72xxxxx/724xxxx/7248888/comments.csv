Can you get Paloma Faith - Picking Up The Pieces or Stooshe - Black Heart?"
,razeke,2012-08-09T02:13Z,Worse transcode I have ever heard. 13.2Khz is spectro? That is just lulzy. 96kbps mobile phone mp3 converted to 320kbps LOL.
,razeke,2012-08-09T02:20Z,"Rofl every upload on tpb of this song are transcodes. Best to go rutracker and get a legit 320kbps with rip log, cue file, etc."
