,Fangular,2012-05-07T14:38Z,This version keeps skipping and restarting - don't download it. It should be taken down - I wish they had done that before I wasted my download on it.
,brigzy,2012-05-07T15:59Z,"We thought that was part of the story.... fucking fuck ok so it's a fucked up movie someone has messed with because the scenes keep repeating, it happens about 5 times. Still watchable if your are a camel."
,demon.stealer,2012-05-07T19:33Z,"Play it using Media player classic (if on windows) and you can just forward a few seconds if it loops. If it wasn't for those few instances of a loopback, it would've been perfect. "
