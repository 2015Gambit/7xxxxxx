,jfvb1225,2012-05-08T02:23Z,WTF no seeds already just upped yesterday.
,drew1972,2012-05-08T04:38Z,"I'd say this is one of those BS torrents where someone tries to entice us to ""join their site"", except that there's no URL or anything.  So why are there no seeders, and we're stuck at 97% ??"
,55trucker,2012-05-08T19:43Z,"Why the hell........is this in VOB format??
The file is 3gig large & it's not even HD."
,drew1972,2012-05-09T20:13Z,"I finally got it, unfortunately, the rain in Monza means no one got anything."
,pxpierre,2012-05-13T23:48Z,"@ drew1972 - both your posts above are baloney.

1- I see 17 seeds in my torrent client @ the present and my max download speed is normal @ 200 kB/s as usual for me.

2- I just saw the file VTS_01_3.VOB with the free VLC Media Player (SBK Round 04 Monza Race 2) and the race lasted 8 laps with half points awarded towards the SBK championship.

Thank you to Anonymous & seeders!"
