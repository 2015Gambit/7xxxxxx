More people immigrate to America than to all other countries in the whole world combined. Why?
 Is it because they love hot dogs and hamburgers? 
Or because they want to meet Snoop Dogg or have a close encounter with Pamela Anderson? Maybe.
 But the real reason is immigrants go to the U.S. to chase the American dream. 
Immigrants is the story of Vladislav (a Russian), and Joska (a Hungarian). 
 Both are immigrants and best friends, living and chasing the American dream together.
Certainly NOT FOR CHILDREN!
