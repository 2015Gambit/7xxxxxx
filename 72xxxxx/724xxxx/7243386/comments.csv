[T],iamgreat,2012-05-05T20:48Z,"The girls of Degrassi often do well on The CW but Degrassi itself would fail. US shows often glamourise things and CA shows tend to be more in-your-face-realistic where it isn't all happy times,d fancy parties, and private schools (except Falcon Beach). If you haven't seen it i suggest you check out 18 To Life. It is a CA show that stars a Degrassi girl but The CW pulled it after half a season despite it getting a 2nd season in CA. It is a somewhat comedic look at the fun and difficulties of marrying young. Trust the Miami Herald and The LA Times to say marrying young is bad (nigh evil) and promiscuity is good and the show sent the wrong message thus deserving to be cancelled. 

I have seen the snipes on MuchMusic are somewhat extensive when watching Degrassi. Some of the most prominent for any non-TNT show. 

This show is NOT available on CA iTunes at all but is coming up weekly on US iTunes. So strange.

Enjoy and remember i am not ettv/eztv/etc so these bigger files go somewhat slow until someone else flips to seeding. "
