ABOUT THE SERIES
From the producers of Degrassi comes a new series full of new relationships, salacious temptations, and make-it-or-break it decisions. The L.A. Complex' coming-of-age dwellers grapple with life's defining moments as they deal with the unreality of the show-biz industry.


IN THIS EPISODE
A struggling Abby is given the chance to make some big cash as long as she's willing to "play the part." Raquel decides she's not going to wait by the phone any longer and starts pushing to get a movie made where she can play the lead. Alicia's not having any luck with her dancing auditions so she takes a different approach by attending a party with a D-list actor (guest star Aaron Abrams "Rookie Blue"). Meanwhile, after presenting an impressive demo at the studio, Tariq is offered the chance to produce a track with the infamous rapper Kaldrick King. However, Tariq quickly realizes that this new role won't be easy.


Production is under-way on season 2, which might be branded as the back 13 of season 1 in the US. So there are 19 episodes committed to production, 6 of which have been broadcast in the north. No idea how many The CW will show given the spectacularly horrible ratings it has.
