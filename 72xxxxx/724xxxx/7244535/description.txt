SYNOPSIS

Richard Gere is My Hero is a heartwarming, character-driven romantic comedy with 
political undertones by Tashi Wangchuk and Tsultrim Dorjee. The story follows a 
group of young Tibetan friends living in Mcleod Ganj, India, headquarters of the 
Tibetan Government-in-exile. 

Nyima, who calls himself Richard and is a great admirer of Richard Gere for his 
acting and activism, has dreams of becoming a famous actor and helping his 
beloved motherland. While Nyima and his friends go on whirlwind adventures through 
the town, a love triangle almost detours them from meeting their goal of performing 
in the Tibetan Youth Congress' Drama Competition. Through the escapades of Nyima 
and his friends, Wangchuk and Dorjee show us how the many layers of life - including 
the romantic and the political - can be imitated in art.
