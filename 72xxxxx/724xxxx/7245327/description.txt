Easy Paint Tool SAI ( πâÜπéñπâ│πâêπâäπâ╝πâ½) is an illustration program for Microsoft Windows, developed by Japanese programming company Systemax.

I could not for the life of me find this wonderful program fully working or even looking right without the idea of having to pay $60 for it. That's rubbish.
So, I did it my way.
I've included the crack, instruction guide, install, blah blah blah. All there, 100% working, not a virus or trojan in sight.
And of course, not a trial either- real shit.
So enjoy and if there are problems please send a shout out.

Tested on 64-bit Windows 7 (I'm guessing it works up to XP but there's no proof, so if you want to try it go for it.)
