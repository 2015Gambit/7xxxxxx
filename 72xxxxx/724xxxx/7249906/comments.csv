,RORLVR1,2012-05-08T07:39Z,Does this have the patch of black after the start credits?
,McPay,2012-05-08T08:31Z,No!
,jdlunday8347,2012-05-27T17:20Z,"No patch of blank area on this one.  This is much
worse.  Has watermark logos.  Keep this big junk to your self McPay.  You are a jerk to put out such a huge file of junk."
,McPay,2012-05-27T20:25Z,"@jdlunday8347:
What is your problem? It is a HDTV-Rip, so it has been recorded from Nick in 720p HD-Quality.
This means it contains the Nick-Logo.
If you don't like, than just don't download it!!!
Maybe you can find a better 720p Version of it, and upload it here! I'm so sick of you people, who never ever had any upload here, but only  complaining and demanding!!! This is all free!!!
So please shut the F@ck up, Jerkface!!!"
,jdlunday8347,2012-05-29T18:47Z,"Hay McPay:
Didn't mean to ruffle your feathers.
Just stating a fact that encoding lots of small
files into a huge download is stupid, if it has
logos.  This is the only one I am missing without
logos.  Again - sorry to point out your basic fault."
,McPay,2012-05-30T00:42Z,"First of all: i didn't encode this! The people behind OOO are the encodes and also the original uploaders! I usally find these on some websides and reupload them here! 
720p HDTV and 720p web-dls with a 20min.. Duration usally have a filesize of 700-800 MB!
And there are a lot of people here who want a good picture quality, so they can watch it on their big screen flat-tvs!
This file is totally free, you don't have to pay any money for it! 
Like i said before, if you don't like, than just download it!!!
So please stop bothering me and all the other people who are doing this for free!
