

Dionysis Savvopoulos (born 2 December 1944) is a Greek music composer, lyricist and singer.

He was born in Thessaloniki. In 1963 he moved to Athens, terminating his law studies in favour of his career in music. He met great success since his early days as a musician and soon became very popular, both in Greece and abroad.

Savvopoulos has been noted for being politically active throughout his career in music. In 1967, Savvopoulos was imprisoned for his political convictions by the Greek military junta.

Most of his songs are written by himself (both lyrics and music). He is still singing but no longer composing (since his last CD "The Millennium"). (wikipedia.org)
