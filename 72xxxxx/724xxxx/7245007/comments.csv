,gamer1981,2012-05-06T16:14Z,shit. theres no crack so no save unless you have key. so only download if you dont want to save game
,bigshot2,2012-05-07T10:05Z,"Yeah, the offline profile doesnt work, it will still ask you for a cd key..."
,kobby2k6,2012-05-08T01:06Z,"it does work..I downloaded it...I mounted the iso with daemon tools...run the iso like a CD...after installation, I unmounted the iso...ran the game and used my live offline account and it worked perfectly fine..

no cracks or keygens were needed..if you use a xbox gold live account (I have one for batman arkham, city), that's is when it prompts for a key..I already had an offline account for resident evil 5.. i had my offline account before hand so I switched to offline account and it worked right away.

p.s.  jin is awesome in the game."
,kobby2k6,2012-05-08T01:07Z,p.s.  it autosaves and I haven't lost anything so far..had it for 2 days now

There is not an option to create an ""offline"" account. It is simply a XBL account."
