London's Olympic Stadium
The eyes of the world will be watching when Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah, Usain Bolt and Co.' go for gold' at the London 2012 Olympic Games. But for some, the real star of the show won't be on the track - it will be the athletics stadium itself. In the UK premiere of London's Olympic Stadium take your seat inside the 80,000 capacity, ┬ú486 million arena that's helped to transform the previously unfancied area of East London. Those lucky enough to have a ticket will enter a truly world-class sports venue that will form a fitting destination for the greatest show on Earth. And that's not all: with London aiming to host the greenest Games ever, the eco-engineered stadium has been designed to be downsized afterwards, leaving behind a customised 25,000-seat athletics arena. Find out how some 5,000 workers battled freak weather conditions, a derelict site and the global financial crash to realise their very own Olympic dream.
