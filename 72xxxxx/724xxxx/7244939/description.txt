Plot
Turn of the Century Africa. Colonial traders driven by greed brave forbidding dangers to exploit the continent's vast treasures. One of these is sea captain Marlow (Tim Roth), who penetrates the depths of the Congo's steaming jungles in pursuit of the mysterious Mr. Kurtz (John Malkovich), deranged chief of a remote trading station. Far from the sanctuary of civilized society, Marlow and Kurtz face each other and the dark truth about man and themselves. Nocolas Roeg directs this acclaimed adaptation of Joseph Conrad's classic tale, the one that inspired Apocalypse Now, of the evil that lurks within the heart of man.
