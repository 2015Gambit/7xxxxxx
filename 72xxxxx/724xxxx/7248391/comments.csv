With Handbrake there is a issue of audio getting out of sync toward the end of the movie... (as can be seen on this movie). I found yesterday that Media Coder (http://www.mediacoderhq.com/) does not have that problem.
Generally, for both of them, I would not use video bitrate below 1500 kbps for 720p video(x264), and for audio  below 128 kbps (AAC)."
,GarryColeman,2012-05-13T11:31Z,Thx for the reply :)
,robbybbn,2012-05-18T23:00Z,thanks! 5.1 sound would indeed be great
,poopsnchutes,2012-05-20T00:18Z,Is there a reason why when I open the file it opens it in windows movie maker and it won't play in any media player?

Try VLC player :) or handbrake to convert it."
