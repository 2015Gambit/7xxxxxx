Its Your Luck  that you got my check list go and find and compare mine with others you will see .. lol and is that make sense i spent hours to produce the checklist and you have no time to ask me for the pass ? then you should not use my checklist stay away ... 
,martronn,2012-05-04T23:38Z,a 737 cheklist is a standard all over so if you using hours making checklists that allready been made and pilots use every day every flight and you call it YOUR check list. ok go ahead... but i will call that a waste of time...
