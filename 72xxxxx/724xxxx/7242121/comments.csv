,titaniumten,2012-05-05T04:02Z,With this update patch the freezing ended for me. Now it works as it should. Thanks SKIDROW and thanks scene4all
,Tigellinus,2012-05-05T07:12Z,This patch won't fix crashes. Kalypso is working on this issue already so wait for another one unless you don't mind losing progress in the game due to random crash.
,whiteorc,2012-05-05T09:05Z,"how do you use the freakin keygen cause its only class files, no exe"
,ahoi1,2012-05-05T09:44Z,It doesn't crash as often as it used to. Still crashes though quite regularly and as said Kalypso is working on a fix.
,steveoomer,2012-05-06T12:06Z,"for use the keygen you have to go into the java bin folder with command prompt and execute ""java -jar c:...PortRoyale3Keygen.jar"""
