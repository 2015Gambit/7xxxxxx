Hi.


First torrent, and it's one I've felt was lacking.

The Skyrim Total Enhancement Project is one of the best tutorials for getting Skyrim looking top notch and as pretty as it should have been from the gate. The only draw back is how long it takes to download everything and then install it. This torrent is to take care of the first half. I've downloaded, named, and did my best to organize all the required and recommended mods for a complete STEP installation. Due to the variety of options you'll have to download it yourself.

Now, to anyone who says, "Did you get permission?" No. I didn't, and I don't care. For one, many of you are pirates (which is fine by me) so it's mighty haughty of you to care about permission. The other portion of you who thinks this is copyright infringement or mod creators aren't getting the recognition, to this I say, oh well. I haven't modified the mods (except removing files/folders outlined in the STEP guide) and full credit still goes to them. This is simply to serve a convenience purpose.


If there is a respectable approval and downloading of this I'll consider updating in accordance to STEP, if not I'll at least seed it because I have awesome Internet.

Toodles.
