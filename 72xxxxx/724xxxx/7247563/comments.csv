,uheardmebitch,2012-05-15T17:21Z,why is everyone bitching about people asking questions? last time i checked it was ok to ask questions. THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE A COMMENT BOX. and last time i checked when u upload a torrent it was JUST PLAIN FUKKIN POLITE for the uploader to describe what was in the torrent so that people don't waste valuable download [WE PAY BY THE KB IN AUSTRALIA] 
,uheardmebitch,2012-05-15T17:29Z,"for anybody wondering [I IMAGINE EVERY SINGLE DOWNLOADER] this is an ENCORE installer. it has no premiere content whatsoever as far as i can tell. ENCORE is a separate program and doesn't even need premiere to run, why it has been labelled ass premiere content i do not know. i kind of didn't get an answer and just installed it to see what happens. i hope this clarifies for people who need to know [EVERY SINGLE DOWNLOADER I WOULD IMAGINE] AND to answer your next question, no it doesn't fix the preset input problem of the other premier torrent. they are still missing. thanks for the upload anyway thingy"
,mergim1,2012-05-16T23:51Z,"Does it works on 32bit and is it extended

,bluecrow,2012-05-26T17:37Z,presets for dslr are working in this torrent?
,heyokay,2012-05-28T05:39Z,"I installed this for Premiere, but it seems to do nothing. What does this actually do?

Does anyone know whether the preset / codec problem for Premiere CS6 has been solved anywhere? From what I can see, all releases of Premiere CS6 so far are incomplete.

I was halfway through an editing project in CS6, which now cannot be reopened due to ""This project contained a sequence that could not be opened. No sequence preview preset file or codec could be associated with this sequence type.""

And of course it can't be opened back in CS 5.5. So I am screwed until someone does a proper release or I come up with eight hundred dollars.

Any pointers would be appreciated."
,barnchad,2012-05-28T05:42Z,"Damn Thingy, hope you're alright. Your never this absent when new releases come out. Take care Bro!"

,saydaysago2008,2012-06-17T03:17Z,"MISSING PRESET / CODEC PROBLEM SOLVED /////


This solution worked for me, I can't promise it will work for everyone.. try it out guys:

1) Uninstall Premiere CS6
2) Reinstall Premiere CS6
3) Open Premiere once and click 'continue trial'.
4) Delete the file: ' /program files (x86)/common files/adobe/adobe pcd/cache/cache.db'
5) Apply the cracked .dll file


All presets/codecs should now be working"
,64Sorcery,2012-06-17T18:39Z,"Hi Thingy, hope u OK, better yet getting so R'n'R on Holiday!  Hope to see you back soon!

Great content, I don't seem to be having the codec problem though, I run sharks win7 with x64 extensions, and have about 20 media players each installed in order of reverse preference so my fa'vs open first in my preferred player, the codecs worked fine straight out. But as I said I have a very peculiar environment. Try installing Sharkies and x64 extensions, and then install QuickTime, Realplayer, (I can't stand them and then continue installing players up until you get to Daum player, MPC, Smplayer, mplayer backend, BS_player, Kmplayer  Vlc, and I always finish with good ol Winamp. I read a review of the best 25 media players, google that and if you're prefferences are similar to mine maybe it will work for you guys. PS I upgraded from CS5.5 so maybe that changed something. Good luck to all, as I said I don't know what fixed it for me but I've given you an outline of my config.

BTW Thingy, no offense intended, but your CS5.5 crack had left a 90 day expiry on the trial version ( a pesky Little Lea ... 0x870 secs in Hex) which if you convert 0x870to decimal, and divide it out to get it in days i.e divide first by 3600 and then 24, adobeleft a final 90 day limit after which you either had to register cause the keys wouldn't work or change the system time. For the more talented you could thunk GetLocalTimeA with  an injected DLL ;-). This is what Adobe had to resort to as their pathetic last ditched effort to stop piracy!!!! LOL. How lame..! HAHA 

A pointer for those for everyone who has no idea what we're talking about, I know the thingy couldn't sit and wait 3 months to release his torrent and glad he didn't ;-). But if you're still running CS5.5 and still running in to problems with the 90day limit and PDApp.exe asking you for a key after three months and it's expiring on ya around August 2011.

A useful Little app an easy to find and free of viruses etc is RunAsDate.exe (lets you tell the application what date right down to the second the app is suppose to be running at if it ask's windows for the time) you can find it here http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/run_as_date.html.

Works on quite a few lame copy protection schemes too by the way!!! In fact ANY program that is dumb enough to use Win32 API's for it's time references, is tricked by this app, Nirsoft page explains how it works, but useful for unsophisticated time based trials

Bro could you give me a huge favor and Bust the timer on codemesh.com's JunC++ion application, I've been busting my balls and have gone bald scratching my head on this one, it's some preety nifty software creates a linkage between Java to C++ and C++ to Java w/o all the fricking JNI crap!! You'd be a life saver, I'm only starting out cracking and am not good enough (yet, I hope to join the ranks of the Senior League later in life, but am nowhere near you or others here.) Compliments when due you guys rock!!! Keep up the good work, and as everyone else hope to be seeing you back here sometime soon!!!"
