Narratives:

Everything about Mikaila's debut album is relative. To most R&B fans, the album will come off as too saccharine-sweet, but to fans of teen pop the album is a godsend. The 14-year-old chanteuse brings a much-needed dose of hip-hop to the teen pop genre and her debut album, Mikaila, has energy that's rarely matched by other teen performers like Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears. The hip-hop influence is felt strongest on "Talkin' Bout Me," a track produced by Dru Hill member Nokio. Unfortunately, the album includes too many obligatory ballads such as "Forever, For Always, for You" and catchy dance tunes like "So in Love With You." At just 14, Makaila shows some skills and given some time to mature, she could turn into a credible R&B performer. Until then, Mikaila should stick to the teen market and hope that her audience will grow up with her.
