I have ripped this from my original bootleg CD using EAC direct to FLAC.

The information below is from a website I found that mentions the same bootleg CD and I presume the source noted and the additional comments are accurate but I have no way of verifying this.

Additional comments:
Taken from the original silver pressed bootleg "The Greatest hits concert". Wembley Stadium on 11th June 1988 was the venue for a unique gathering of musicians and performers from all over the world who under the banner of Artists Against Apartheid paid tribute to Nelson Mandela for his 70th Birthday. An audience estimated to be well over half a billion people in some 63 countries participated in an event with a simple compelling message: "Free Nelson Mandela". Dire Straits appeared as the closing act of that unforgettable day with Eric Clapton on second guitar. Until today, it was probably the most important and powerful concert of the Dire Straits history. Great sounding recording but unfortunately the Mandela show is missing Brothers in arms. The last three tracks are from the famous Wembley Arena show from 1985. Both recordings have very good sound quality.

Enjoy!
