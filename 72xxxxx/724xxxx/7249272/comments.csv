,serdavos,2012-05-07T17:53Z,Is this repack good? No censorship or skipping like all the others?
,motherparker,2012-05-07T17:54Z,is this censored???
,powers987,2012-05-07T18:14Z,Is this one censored too?
,asfdmnbb,2012-05-07T18:41Z,"It's censored, bad words are muted at least, you can see it in the first seconds where they muted Cersei saying ""whore"", I don't know about cut out scenes as I didn't want to watch it all, quality isn't the best either."
,LackThereof,2012-05-07T19:35Z,"If this is the same as the other 2HD release, the only censoring is in the last-episode recap, and seems to be in all this episode's sources.  Characters say/do worse in the body of the episode and nothing is edited.

Generally people have been complaining that the repack is lower video quality than the original (which occasionally repeated the previous 20 seconds)."
,attackedbullet,2012-05-07T21:18Z,Hi this might sound stupid but how can i down the un censored version ? does any a linl to this please :) god dam censor ship can kiss my hair balls lol :) fck em all the wankers
,erroneus,2012-05-08T02:38Z,"I don't get the ""censoring.""  There's a nice nude scene and some fierce killing.  Why would they pick on the word ""whore""?  Someone has a pretty strange idea of what disgusting means."
