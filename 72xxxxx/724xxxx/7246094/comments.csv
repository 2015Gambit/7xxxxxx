tNe - do not let one twerp spoil your much appreciated contributions. He's been called on it, exposed as a liar and that he steals your work - don't let one bad apple spoil the crate.

If he pollutes your comments again, there are Mod / Admin ways to get him suspended, particularly after you've requested he not do that in your ups  ....  :-)

Hope to see you back bigger & stronger for all this - you have more support than he could ever dream of, or pretend he has."

Shame that one jerk ruins it for us all, but I can't blame you one bit. That guy was/is a jerk."
