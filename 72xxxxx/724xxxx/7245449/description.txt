 More about The Companion Bible by E W Bullinger. 

This bible outlines the , subjust of what your reading, also the 198 Appendixes offer a valuable insight into a lot of topics in the bible, even those things most so called bible teachers will not tell you about  or teach you.

Bullinger is not perfect, for example he things in his opinion that Christ was naild to a actual tree and not a cross. Not everyone is perfect. But His work is top notch, you dont get better then Bullinger in my opnion, when it comes to his scholarly notes. 

you will find this useful. to say the least.
