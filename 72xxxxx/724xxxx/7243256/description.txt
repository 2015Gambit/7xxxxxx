Hey! RIAA snitcher David Brooks from Devon. What did you tell them?
That HHI is dropping rips like LSD? Call us crazy...We think they might already know that. Didn't your parents ever teach you that it's not nice to snitch? Especially when the people you try and snitch on can figure out who you are. Here's our doc drop dedicated to you. We're sure the information looks familiar, as it's yours.
