REVIEW ON IMDB 


This is a very good movie.Although this movie is very very sad it's good.A young man who has a great future ahead of him treats girls wrong and his brother.He was close to being a professional football player than suddenly gets rushed to the hospital containing cancer.A good man with a nice body and handsome,thats 20,ends up skinning bones,aged and now looks 46.He finds out the people who loved him for him and for his future money.Now getting news that he will die in a few months.This movie was very hard to make considering he weighed 160 lb,then making himself look real for the role lost so much weight,making him look like someone with cancer."
