Description:
High school boys are really simple and curious creatures. They want one and only one thing: girls. But they haven't got a clue about them. Male teenagers are dumbfounded by the girls' thought process, actions, appearance and everything in between. They spend countless hours amongst themselves discussing and arguing their theories which are usually completely off base. If only they had the courage to ask them instead of screwing around and talking about nonsensical things, they might get somewhere. (Written by baka-updates)
