The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 06 May 2012


[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the May 6 Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex takes a look at the phony 9/11 Gitmo show trial of supposed master terrorist Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and his four co-defendants. On Saturday, the arraignment of the accused terrorists turned into a three ring circus, thus sending the message that the Sixth Amendment is irrelevant in terrorist cases. Alex also covers the massive police state rollout in Chicago as the NATO war council prepares to convene. He also adds new details on draconian re-education camps where political activists will be forced to appreciate the murderous foreign policy of the ruling elite.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
