[T],MrUnpopular,2012-05-05T18:37Z,"It's a TVRip smart one. No where in the file name is HD mentioned now, is it?"
,tjdwo09,2012-05-05T18:53Z,"Thanks, from us Australians"

,draggle5439,2012-05-05T19:08Z,Thank you! 
,Desperatenerd,2012-05-05T19:18Z,"Has no audio in VLC, Zoom, Media Player Classic, or just Media Player. Fix this please? "
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-05-05T19:43Z,There's audio...you're just missing the right codecs. I gotta figure what's wrong when encoding. -_-
,mattnoble6,2012-05-05T19:44Z,wait for http://thepiratebay.se/user/Daman4Iife/ to upload 
,urashimakt,2012-05-05T20:02Z,"@Desperatenerd: You're missing the required codecs. I'd update your VLC codec packs, then you should be able to run it in VLC or MPC with sound.

But even so, the visual quality of this release looks like a series of poorly compressed jpegs. Looks blurred in a weird, eye-straining kind've way. I'd wait for another release."
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-05-05T20:09Z,This is SD...I don't get why y'all keep expecting HD. Familiarise yourself with release tags.
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-05T20:10Z,"If it's going to take this long to get a decent HD rip, I'm just gonna start ripping it myself and uploading starting next week. Forgot to set my DVR today and missed it otherwise I'd do it today, but now I gotta wait patiently for someone else to rip it, and it sucks. Expect 1080p next week."
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-05T20:14Z,"VLC is awful. Media Player Classic - Home Cinema, is the best player out there. It comes bundled inside  the CCCP (Combined Community Codec Pack) download which is the most efficient codec pack of all. Install CCCP and never have a problem with playback again.

[V],spastik64,2012-05-05T23:08Z,"Nice, it works 10/10.

Just get VLC, Gomplayer, KMPlayer..."
,ltcomm2,2012-05-05T23:36Z,"And, no. New audio codecs don't help. K-Lite with the latest audio ."
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-05-06T00:30Z,"If any of you wanna help our group figure out the audio issues (we'll send test 30 second or less video encodes with different audio formats and see which work without needing to do anything special) email us. unpopular@hush.ai

thx"
,mirko74,2012-05-08T21:36Z,"If you simply change the extension from ""mp4"" to ""avi"", you have audio in vlcplayer for this particular file. I don't know why, but it does the trick."
