,kanchudeep,2012-05-06T11:21Z,"You're welcome @srinumad. Its just a compilation. Maps are from:
http://gpsunderground.com/forum/sygic-software/15225-mapmyindia-7-0-premium-*2012*-sygic-aura-win-ce-6-maybe-other-devices-too.html

Unfortunately working only with Sygic Navigation version 11.2.5. But then version 11.2.6 does not concern India so no issue.

,kklkanna,2012-07-14T20:23Z,need to run sygic downloader before starting the app for first time?
,viraj31,2012-08-26T19:14Z,after installing does it need any verification from internet?
,viraj31,2012-08-31T19:27Z,Atleast reply to users!
,kanchudeep,2012-09-22T05:09Z,"Sorry @viraj31... I was busy with something...

No there is no need for any verification. The complete set is compiled from various sources. As for the Sygic base files, the source lists that one should not try to activate it over the air. Otherwise it is activated with almost all the functions working.

Sorry again..."
