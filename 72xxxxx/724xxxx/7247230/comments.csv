Don't get me wrong, but it's really lame to seed for such a short time.
I hope your next release of Club Life will be seeded properly.
Your work is much appreciated, as you can see by the amount of leechers :)"
,Quartel20,2012-05-12T00:21Z,sorry guys.. mine HDD with the ClubLife on it has crashed on the day of the upload. so everyone stucks at 88% i'm trying to re-upload the ClubLife's that you will miss and i can't delete the torrent
