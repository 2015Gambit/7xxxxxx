[V],psspss,2012-05-05T13:32Z,"im hearing a rythmic clicking throughout on this one trying mpc kmplayer and vlc.. 

even in sound forge.. just wondering if your seeing it too"
[T],trialNerror,2012-05-05T22:31Z,"no i don't hear a rhythmic clicking
but i do hear a random popping once in a while
that could be from having a high normalization level
will lower it a few db next time

then again i really dont know
maybe it was in the source audio
that's long gone so can't tell

i encoded the audio the exact same way i've been doing them for a while now.  if they all have this ""rhythmic clicking"" then it's on my end and can try lowering the normalization level or something, but if it's only clicking audio in this vid then not sure what to say since i'm not hearing what quite what you're describing and it's completely out of my control"
[V],psspss,2012-05-06T00:29Z,"well it was even on quiet sections when
they talked.. loudest was beginning though
it was a constant pop.. reminds me
of the old LP days :)
so dont think it was over volume
most likely artifacts due to bug in the soft
or filter

i cleared it up in sound forge in my xvid
not so noticable or annoying anyhow
"
[V],psspss,2012-05-06T00:32Z,"well others havent said. its clear on laptop
might of been on one channel since its ac3
one of 6 speakers?"
[V],psspss,2012-05-06T04:20Z,"it had a demon creature in this episode maybe
he was clicking his toes while they talked :)"
[T],trialNerror,2012-05-06T06:50Z,"yay you got a very slight random popping sound to be a little more slight.
want a cookie?
jesus dude
what is your damn problem with me?
any tiny little thing with an mp4 i release and you're all over it trying to make it look like i release nothing good
back the hell off joe
have you read my nickname lately?  trial N error that's right i'm learning this shit as i go and in the past year i think i've come a long damn way from starting with uploading torrents to sites from other sites to recording analog hdtv to capturing digital hdtv recordings striving for quality like those top notch pros in scene do

what the hell is it you do?  toss out regurgitated mislabeled titled 1 day off CBR over sized missing quality in motion scenes bullshit from of other peoples work for a small pack of users that are technologically inapt and willing to suffice for average quality?  whooptie damn doo fool

you annoy the hell out of me
you annoy the hell out of everyone i know
leave my shit alone and just be goddamn thankful you have a copy to convert to begin with

i won't be here forever so if you wanna keep some of these releases of yours ongoing you may have to figure out how to properly cap some hdtv yourself without the use of an hd capture card

good luck with that jack

if you reply anything - that's it - i'm done uploading

you annoy me that much

peace out niqqa"
[V],psspss,2012-05-06T12:19Z,"lol  i have no issue with you
dont know what you mean
it was a question was the clicking heard by all
trying to isolate the issue and how"
[V],psspss,2012-05-06T12:25Z,just ask everyone on demon what i do and they let you know. obviously you havw no clue and liek yoru friend makign silly claims about me all the time. if im what you claim.. how come i was made vip here and demon is a short time..
[T],trialNerror,2012-05-07T00:48Z,oh you replied that's it i'm done
[T],trialNerror,2012-05-07T01:07Z,"if you haven't noticed most vip users only got their status by uploading other people's work.  they don't do a damn thing for original work. you don't do a damn thing for original work. what you do any dumbass could do:  download a video from here or a website, drop it some clunky program, a weak 1 pass encode to xvid, and re-release.  you got vip because some other vip or admin or mod is an xvid humper like yourself and boosted your status when things went to x264. that's the only reason.

but hey i said if you replied i'm done.  so i'm done. thank you, pss
"
[V],psspss,2012-05-07T08:25Z,"i dont know whats with you and others here
so anti

i just providing content like you for our fav shows or paranormal stuff thats it.. simple.. if no one makes xvids then i provide the ones i made for myself as theres a demand for them i rather others make the xvids or provide the missing episodes so I dont have too.. i cant afford the data for one

maybe if you grew up with vhs taps maybe you wouldnt be so upset with xvids :)

chill dude
"
[V],psspss,2012-05-07T08:29Z,you cant expect to insult people and not handle a reply.. thats childish .. 
,sweetchuk,2012-05-09T10:08Z,"psspss, seriously, STFU, go play with your own stuff. If you want to spam up your own comments, then fine. No-one on here will give a damn,
But have some respect for when tNe or anyone asks you to stop polluting his uploads with your borish & repetetive 'little boy who wants a mommy' bullshit.

Seriously, f*ck off and leave the good uploaders comments area free from your taint - nobody cares about what you think & if you reckon they do, then piss off to your own and bask in the bullshit there.

You're not half the uploader tNe is or ever will be and the more you go looking for pats on the back from anyone who believes your crap, the fewer there'll be.

What a seriously pathetic, dependant twat."
,6patera9,2012-05-14T16:06Z,Yeah wow it would be a true bummer to see you go trialNerror. I like and appreciate all your work to be sure despite not commenting a lot. If I could add my two cents in I would say piss on the guy and keep doing what your doing and I hope that is just what you do. I hate to rip on psspss but seriously dude if you don't like trialNerror's work just stop coming by his posts.
