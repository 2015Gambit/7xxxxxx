,ProphetZarquon,2012-05-08T03:02Z,"Hmm, I downloaded this:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7239816/The_Big_Bang_Theory_S05E23_HDTV_XviD-AFG[ettv]
and it had a Video glitch in the very last seconds of the final scene.

So I grabbed this one.  It has an Audio dropout at the same spot!  Clearly different network sources...

I've now tried two x264 and two XviD uploads under two media players each (VLC and Media Player Classic) on Win7 and Mac, same results!

Is it possible the Master that went to air had a bad frame?

Still hoping for a quality fix for this episode."
