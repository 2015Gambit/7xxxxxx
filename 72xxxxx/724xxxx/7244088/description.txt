Hamid Drake's ascent in the world of improvised music rendered unavoidable his
meeting with Irène Schweizer, a pianist who has a rich history of collaborations
with drummers and enjoys playing drums in her spare time. The opening piece
recorded at the Taktlos Festival features the two of them in a long and
multifarious conversation during which Schweizer constantly challenges Drake,
whose stamina is essential to the music's focus. The other three improvisations
come from a different performance that took place at the Willisau Festival and
for which they were joined by one of Drake's mentors, tenor saxophonist Fred
Anderson. His addition does not disturb the chemistry the two other protagonists
have already established and he is clearly careful to support their rapport. His
laid-back demeanor is deceiving, though, and he can subtly inject new ideas or
suggest new directions. The pianist also knows when to step back and let her two
cohorts have a private moment. Her trademark translucent and fleet runs, her
bouncy progressions, and her forays into South African territory reminiscent of
Abdullah Ibrahim are delightful; she can also be whimsical when she plays hide
and seek with Anderson at the end of "Trinity." The quieter passages certainly
betray her European origins, but are not a distraction from this otherwise
energetic, soulful, and pleasurable set.
