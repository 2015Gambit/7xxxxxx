,mrironhand,2012-05-06T01:49Z,"I get how to change to english hehe...

Go to the execute on start menu(I guess that's execute in english windows, 'cause mine is in portuguese =P) and type regedit.

Find the RERC registration, then open the ""locale"" item.

Change the number to 1033.

It works for me at last =)"
