Storyline 
*********

Having been told that the man who has kidnapped her son is the same man who killed her husband Paul, Rebecca reviews the video of the day Paul died. She sees someone she wants to follow-up on and goes to her one-time mentor, Martin Newman. He's the man who brought Michael home after Paul's death and the man who told her Paul was killed by Russian Intelligence. The video means Martin may have lied to her. In Dubrovnik Rebecca, Dax and Newman find the trigger man from Paul's assassination and he's prepared to give her information in return for protection.
