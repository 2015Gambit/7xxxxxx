Amelie is a strange beast, a whimsical fairytale that has more darkness under its skin than most usually want to admit. After all, Amelie engages in malicious practical jokes and stalking behaviour in her attempt to help the other lonely souls of Paris - and herself - so isn't all sweetness and light and big impish eyes. Between Bruno Delbonnel's acid coloured cinematography, Tautou's wondrous central performance and Jeunet's twisted magical realism, the end result is so utterly loveable that the whole world fell under Amelie's spell.

I have limited bandwidth. So try and be patient.

And seed as much as you can.

Enjoy!!!
