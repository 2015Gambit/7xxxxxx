A real-life drama about a family of chimps trapped in a lost world. They live in
a deep and ancient forested gorge that runs though the African savannah and for 
fifteen years it has been cut off from the rest of the jungle, leaving the chimps
imprisoned.

Here, they face a daily life-or-death dilemma: whether to leave the safety of the
gorge and venture into the predator-ridden savannah to find food, or face hunger.
There's now only twenty of them left and as Brutus the alpha male loses his grip,
can the family hold it together or is time running out for the Kyambura chimps?
