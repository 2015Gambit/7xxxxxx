,HeyRio,2012-05-07T19:33Z,"Hello! How are you?

Please inform if the version in English is also present? Where do I find this amtlib.dll ? in the torrent? Cheers!"
,grogxD,2012-05-07T23:48Z,"It is region 4, languages are: da-DK / de-DE / es-ES / es-MX / fi-FI / fr-FR / fr-CA / it-IT / nb-NO / nl-NL / pt-BR / sv-SE

It is the OS X version, there is no amtlib.dll file, folder amtlib.framework is included to patch each application"
,senseinai,2012-05-07T23:56Z,I believe .dll files are Windows files aren't they?
,HeyRio,2012-05-08T00:03Z,"@grogxD Thanks, even tough my original languages are pt-Br and it-IT, I prefer work on en... Pity! Thanks anyway. Cheers.

@Senseinai You're right ... they are. Cheers."
,verne1964,2012-05-08T00:19Z,"Works fine, thanks a lot! But i have a problem with indesign. I can't install folio builder, overlay creator and adobe content viewr for the digital publishing suite. 

Installing the DPS Desktop Tools (InDesign CS6)
In InDesign, choose Help > Updates, and update DPS Desktop Tools.

The DPS Desktop Tools installer installs the Folio Overlays panel, the Folio Builder panel, a required InDesign plugin, and the Desktop Viewer.

somebody knows the solution for this?
Thanks!!"

Hola.
Este CS6·dmg:
1· Lo Descargué desde Adobe, de sus propios servidores, el CS6·dmg oficial.
2· Lo instalé con amtlib.framework según el proceso que se da aquí y funciona… ¡pero funcionó muy mal! (Photoshop).
3· Lo desinstalé y regresé a CS5'5…

¿Es una versión final?, creo que no.
No me gusta nada como me ha funcionado.
Creo que no está acabado para mac. Pero quizá vosotros deseéis probar…, ¡O NO!…

It is a final version?, I think that not.
I don't like anything as worked me.
I think that it is not finished for mac. But perhaps you want to try..., or NOT!..."

,sudo,2012-05-08T12:50Z,"This torrent gives non option to choose these languages: Danish ""da-DK"" / Finnish ""fi-FI""  / Norwegian ""nb-NO"" 

Do not bother downloading as i did if you need these languages."
,Olive74000,2012-05-08T22:36Z,"Thx for this. But how to edit hosts files & where are they ?
Someone can share an edit hosts file tool, like they made for CS5 plz ?"
,Olive74000,2012-05-08T22:44Z,"Update Adobe Activation Blocker for CS6 with new hosts file patched could be a very cool solution for all of us... ;)
Or an update of Adobe MultiGen by CORE Keygen with patch hosts file option would be cool too !
Plz make it & share it !"
