is this SP1 version? or the only version 
of windows!"
,D255,2012-05-07T15:33Z,"sorry, is this SP1 version or the old
compilations of windows"
,FatFreddy371,2012-05-07T20:55Z,"@D255:

It's SP1. During installation, it asks the version to install; home, pro or ultimate & 64-bit or 32-bit. It worked perfect for me! :-)"
,FatFreddy371,2012-05-07T21:01Z,"Btw, home, pro and ultimate only differ in terms of security updates. Those updates are useless as we all use antivirus and internet security softwares. Those updates boot hardware and driver support."
