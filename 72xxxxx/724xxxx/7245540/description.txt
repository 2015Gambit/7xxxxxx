Tod Trauer Trapani - Funeral Marches - Italy (Edition Grumbach) (CD256kb)

Funeral marches played by local brass bands recorded during the traditional Holy Friday Procession (Processione dei Misteri) in Trapani, Sicily.

"In the afternoon of Good Friday, in the town of Trapani in Sicily a 20-part procession sets out to circle through the streets: La Processione dei Misteri. For the next twenty four hours twenty brass bands will accompany this procession with its old statues representing the Stations of the Cross, until finally on Saturday afternoon, at the end of a long night, silence descends and the town waits for Resurrection. This is the sound portrait of a night: a film without pictures."
