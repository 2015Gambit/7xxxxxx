,drymoused,2012-05-26T14:06Z,SHA: A great song from thankfully dead white supremacists (a contradiction in terms if there ever was one) defending the home of the KKK from verbal attacks by their superiors. Most of the people mindlessly humming along to it in their cars wouldn't think it was sweet if they had to live in that hellhole of neocon (and worse: Christian) values

,cormaczoso,2012-09-08T04:57Z,"it's not a song defending the kkk and so forth ... it's just defending the constant spewing of shit from hammerheads like you, drymoused, that the south is ONLY those things and that those things STILL are the dominant things in the south ... get a clue ...

thanks for this up ... always been a big fan of skynyrd and the southern rock movement"
