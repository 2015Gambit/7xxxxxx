This time we're looking at the truly outrageous '2010: Moby Dick'. Herman Melville was only missing one thing when he wrote Moby Dick, and that was cheese (and a lot of it). Thankfully that Asylum has stepped in and rectified the situation. In this re-imagined masterpiece, Moby Dick has the ability to walk on land, the whaleship Pequod has been replaced with a high techsubmarine (which was actually shot on a spaceship set) and Barry Bostwick (Captain Ahab) gives a performance so 'over the to'p he makes Brian Blessed look subtle.
