After working together since 1993 as part of DJ Force & The Evolution (with James Broomfield and Paul Hughes), Paul Hobbs and Darren Mew formed Force & Styles in 1995. They founded their own independent record label UK Dance Records to release their recordings and the duo released numerous 12-inch singles during the mid-1990s. All over the UK was recorded at their studio in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex and the album was released on DJ Eruption's United Dance Recordings label on 26 August 1996 and peaked at No. 103 on the UK Albums Chart.

Although most of the songs were released as 12-inch singles on Force & Styles' own UK Dance Records label, two songs from the album were later released as singles on the Diverse record label. ""Paradise & Dreams"" featuring Junior was released in October 1996 and peaked at No. 106 on the UK Singles Chart and a remixed version of ""Heart of Gold"" with additional production by pop record producer Eliot Kennedy and ex-Dead or Alive members Tim Lever and Mike Percy featuring vocals from Kelly Llorenna was released in July 1998 and peaked at No. 55 in the UK Singles Chart. Several tracks from this album would later appear on Force & Styles' compilation album Heart of Gold (2000).
