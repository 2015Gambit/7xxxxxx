Shame that Sansa had to see and now she's traumatized. Oh well at least it will enable her to murder Joffrey in the finale so its all good! Renly's reanimated corpse is going to cause a lot more damage dont let this episode fool you! Spolr because you all keep whining about spolier tags! Its not my fault I want to talk about this series!

This will convert any file over to xvid which plays on anything divx compatible. I think you need a separate program to convert MKV formats though but I am not sure since I don't have version 8.+. 
It has occurred to me that you might not know how to install a cracked program but you n00b pirates need to learn some day so have at ye!"

Thank you very much ettv

I've downloaded both this version by ettv as well as this one: 'Game of Thrones S02E06 HDTV x264-2HD [eztv]'

This upload by ettv was only slightly better with regard to video and audio (both are very good), but more importantly I noticed that contrary to the other file I downloaded from eztv, in which some of the strong language was censored (e.g.: the word 'whore' was cut out etc.) this download from ettv was not censored! I did not notice any difference in the amount of blood and gore or nudity in either one.

Hope this info is useful to all ye pirates :)

I guess it depends what country you're in and how they define copyright infringement. I don't wanna discourage seeding and all but you can also watch all Game of Thrones episodes uncensored through game-of-thrones.uprisestudios.co.uk in HD.
