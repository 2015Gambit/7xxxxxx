 I Got these from this web site: http://www.companionbiblecondensed.com/

They offer them for download, but I have it all into two folders, one for the New Testament. The other in a Old Testament folder.  

They said the condensed something in Bullingers work. not sure what it was , but there is a explanation of it in the folder and at their side, from where i copied their explanation of it.  Its neat and easy to read PDF. 

I Dont think these come with the 198 Appendixes. But you use it as you want. 

Bullinger's note are the best. no one can compare that i have found.
