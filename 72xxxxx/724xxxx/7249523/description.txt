I got tired of the fake posters who keep putting up torrents purportedly containing this book, but never seeding.  Found the book elsewhere on usenet, tried to seed it in one of the previous posts, but because the "zoidb00k.nfo" file was missing, those torrents would never complete.  (As you can see, the most recent one gets stuck at the point where the file I tried to seed cuts off).

So this is the real e-book.  I will seed for long enough to get it going, then I expect the rest of you to keep it going.  If you like the book, buy it as I did:
