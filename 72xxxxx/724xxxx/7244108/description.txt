In ΓÇ£Private Empire:ExxonMobil and American PowerΓÇ¥, Steve Coll investigates the largest and most powerful private corporation in the United States, revealing the true extent of its power. ExxonMobilΓÇÖs annual revenues are larger than the economic activity in the great majority of countries. 

In many of the countries where it conducts business, ExxonMobilΓÇÖs sway over politics and security is greater than that of the United States embassy. In Washington, ExxonMobil spends more money lobbying Congress and the White House than almost any other corporation. Yet despite its outsized influence, it is a black box.
