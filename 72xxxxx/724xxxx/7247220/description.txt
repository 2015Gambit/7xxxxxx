            NAND FLASHER 360 VERSION 1.2.0
===============================================================================

The NAND Flasher 360 is a NAND -flash program for XBOX 360 (XeX Version). With this program you can update 
to a new version of freeboot within minutes. The Data gets verified for each extraction and writing step. 
Bad blocks automatically get moved to the appropriate positions (Bad block management). 
This works for the small as well as the larger NANDs (16/256/512MB). Information on the hardware and NAND 
is also displayed. (keyword: 360 jtag hack)

Features:
* Simple, easy to use interface (a lot of the more complicated stuff gets done automatically)
* Displays information on the hardware and NAND
* Possible to easily add additional languages
* Bad blocks automatically get relocated (for all NAND sizes, 16/256/512MB)
* Verification process which results in very safe, virtually error-free read and write processes.

New in this rel:
- Fixed Bad Block Handling on Small Block
- Added shutdown button
- Added some GUI modifications
- Small Bugs fixed
- Added Spanish language
