As says Wikipedia, Pillow talk is the relaxed, intimate conversation that often occurs between two sexual partners after the act of coitus, usually accompanied by cuddling, caresses, and other physical intimacy. It is associated with sexual afterglow and is distinguished from dirty talk which usually forms part of foreplay.

Pillow Talk (1959) is probably the most well known pairing of Doris Day and Rock Hudson. For its time, it was one of the more risque films.

The film won the Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), and was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Doris Day), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Thelma Ritter), Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color and Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture.

Simone de Beauvoirs of our times may find the movie offensive and tasteless regarding gender. The trio of Day-Hudson-Randall make it a pleasure cruise, nonetheless.

One of the most clever romantic comedies ever to come out of Hollywood. Enjoy!!!!!
