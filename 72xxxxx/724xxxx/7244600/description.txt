Hi,

After 250 uploads of HQ music and 3 comments (accept for my two friends), I have the feeling, I am just providing a crowd of greedy idiots that use a sharing platform for their own selfish interests. If we want to prevent war we will have to start learning to share (and trust). Less than one percent is willing to share (for a couple of hours). In this case, it is  not that hard, considering its for free. So please take your share, help seeding and show you care.

Comments are also appreciated.

Enjoy,

Dutch Treat
