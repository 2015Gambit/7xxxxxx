,SJDA,2012-05-08T19:54Z,"Awesome tracks, great quality!  Thanks for Uploading!"
,sopwith99,2012-05-10T06:36Z,This is a legit torrent scanned with mcafee and norton. It is virus free and best of all: all of the tracks real and work great CD rip major.pirate!
,skrubsud,2012-05-11T20:54Z,"Works beautifully, no problems. Nice."
,Zylvyn,2012-05-28T16:22Z,"This torrent does have audio files, but they are not the ones from the CD that he sold.  They are, instead, a collection of fake tracks with gag audio for the most part that asks people to buy the CD.

It should be labelled as such, instead of as 'official' and '100% legit'"
,aldaron1,2012-06-07T23:36Z,"It's labelled as Official and legit because it's posted by someone on behalf of Brentalfloss, if not he himself. The uploader has only this one torrent file, so it's pretty obvious. "
,BigRedd11,2012-07-14T18:46Z,"Hah, this had to be Brentalfloss. It's got audio of his little cousin Jackson (the voice of Baby Mario on his CD). Touche, Mr. Black. I will go buy it right now. "
