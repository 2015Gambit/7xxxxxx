Description:
By Martin JÃ¸rgensen - Global Flyfisher about "Fly Fishing for Mullet": 

Brian has always been a very skilled and enthusiastic angler, and he was amongst the first ones in Denmark to get real success with the elusive mullet. This DVD demonstrates that he still has the grip - and then some. 

The DVD is one long drive through a great type of fishing with lots of action, lots of tips and lots of sheer fun in fishing. It is not a top-of-the-line professional production, but the joy and enthusiasm more than makes up for that. After having watched this DVD I cannot wait to get out hunting mullet again. 

This year was my best mullet year ever: I hooked - and lost - four fish. Brian hooks about 20-30 fish in this DVD alone and gets more than I care to count to hand. He also manages to show different fishing methods, flies and a bunch of tips.
