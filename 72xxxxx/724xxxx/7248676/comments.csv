Torrentday... is now an invite only site. If you are lucky you might have a friend who wants to invite you! We just want to see how many cheaters will start respecting their accounts after they realize they canâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t just come back in and get another one.

Please be careful about who you invite to the site, if we think you knowingly invited a cheater both yours and the person you invited accounts will be disabled.

If you want an invite and you know someone who has one, its up to you to contact them to give you an invite we do not relay messages to users."

is it too much to ask to get consistently ripped files, i know different people do them but WTF...these are terrible fucking quality....GOT should be ripped into a 700mb file, it's so dark it needs a bigger filesize....these AFG files are just shit...now we have 6 different XVID caps and they ALL SUCK!!!!!! if you just learned how to rip properly at decent quality then there wont be these problems. is there even an FQM rip, they were the best ones....done at 550mb AT LEAST....but they only account for SOME of the episodes.

fucking brutal man."
