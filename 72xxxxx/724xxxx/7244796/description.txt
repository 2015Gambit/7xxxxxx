This California trio had a sound similar to Jefferson Airplane (not surprising considering their producer was Al Schmitt, the Airplane producer) with powerful female vocals by Chris Christman. An excellent example of the American tough psychedelic sound with some great fuzz guitar / organ interplay on the best track
Silver Rains. All their material was written by Chris Christman and Kenny Thomure, Mike McAuley being also credited for Silver Rains and Wark on Last Laugh. None of the group members appear to have played in any documented group before or after Ivory. Recommended.
