,tonedeth,2012-05-05T06:36Z,"tr108 - Any chance you can list what you use to encode and tag?  I have some films I'd like to upload and I like your results better than most.  Small size, great quality and iPad compatible.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.  Keep up the good work!"

,juvenacca,2012-05-06T19:26Z,"@TR108
Do you upload to a different site?  TBP in the UK is going down and I don't want to miss out on your fab torrents!  Virgin Media have already started denying their customers access to TPB!! :("
,BeSomeone,2012-05-07T16:35Z,can you upload X-men first class iTunes?
,BeSomeone,2012-05-07T18:09Z,"I also need The Green Hornet, if possible"
,essamfhs,2012-05-09T09:16Z,awesome quality tr108! you really are the best there is! Just wondering if you could do new years eve? thank you again!
[T],tr108,2012-05-11T03:17Z,"@tonedeth @borkn - I use HandBrake (Mac & PC) and Subler (Mac only) to produce my files. For PC heads, MetaX can help you input the metadata & cover art that we must have to keep our libraries neat. I'll think about doing some type of tutorial.

@BeSomeone - I might get to X-Men: FC in a few months but not so sure about Green Hornet tho. 

@juvenacca - I also post on Demonoid. If you can't access that, google ""techrod108"" (my actual handle, TPB gave me a username too long error when I tried that tho; weird stuff) and you'll be able to find my torrents scattered about the web. Any other sites I should be posting too? No promises, but I'll try.

@essamfhs - I'll be out of commission for about 10 days, but remind me when I'm back...

Thanks for the love everyone!"
,dilligaf247,2012-05-17T21:03Z,"Hey tr108, Can you please do the grey and I've some pointers on how you make these movies so darn good?"
[T],tr108,2012-05-22T02:02Z,"@dilligaf247 - I'm trying to do The Grey but it's the grainest film I've come across since films shot in the 70s. Right now I'll need to upload a 10 GB file to get a 1080p file that won't have picture breakup. It's pissin' me off...

Ask specific questions about encoding and I'll answer. :)"
