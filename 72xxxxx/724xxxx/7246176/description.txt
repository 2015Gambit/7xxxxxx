Mens Health Philippines May 2012

Mens Health help Filipino men gain control of their physical and emotional 
lives. Unlike most magazines that exist solely to entertain, Mens Health 
also educates its readers. Every tip, phrase, sentence and article is 
relevant, credible, realistic and motivational. We keep the magazines well 
rounded in the local context by using Filipino talents and references. We 
also back up our content with extensive research both from local and foreign 
resources. Our tips and workouts are doable even with a working mans busy 
schedule. Finally, we inspire our readers to make a positive change not only 
for their own benefits, but for their loved ones and associates as well.
