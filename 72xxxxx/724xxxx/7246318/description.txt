Storyline

What appears to be a random kidnapping becomes something more sinister when Secret Service Agent Jeremy Reins discovers he's being used as a pawn in a terrorist plot. Watching the clock tick down to an unknown catastrophe, Jeremy is forced by his captors to listen to the outside world on the brink of collapse, knowing that the only way to save the people he loves is to divulge a secret that he has sworn to protect.
