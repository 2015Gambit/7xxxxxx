@jtwood1978 - It's real"
,msp1518,2012-05-06T15:31Z,So does this have the HBO crew or not? I want to hear the HBO announcers as they are the best.
,djhavikk,2012-05-06T17:56Z,"sync is horribly off. not to mention it took 15 hours to DL, and i have a pretty fast PC. what a waste."
,imolfan,2012-05-06T19:05Z,"Quality is great, but there are couple seconds here and there that are missing ...."
,Xanthium111111,2012-05-06T21:30Z,"First off, thanks for having a video of this quality out so quickly after the broadcast... it's never been done before.

This is the HBO version, 60fps, quality 10/10. It was reported that the audio sync was off, it is not. It is off by about a tenth of a second and I hardly even noticed it during the fight. A person can always adjust the audio sync with VLC player anyway."
,Placebo_obecalP,2012-05-06T22:47Z,"Sync was fine for me, watched on a 120"" projector screen, about 30 seconds lost from 3-4 video skips but nothing major, good cap and great to get HD so quickly :)"
,D1g1talStat1c0,2012-05-07T01:58Z,thanks Xanthium111111 & Placebo_obecalP for the positive feedback!
,Rush,2012-05-08T04:09Z,"@D1g1talStat1c0...

Nice job on the up, you had the first legit copy on TPB.

 I doubted you in that first comment due to very few up's and only one comment, my apologies. 

Welcome to TPB, you gained a lot of respect in a short period of time.

Hope to see you get that ""VIP"" badge soon...

Rush...."
,MIC1906,2012-05-08T07:33Z,@D1g1talStat1c0- 7mins of the fight is missing theres no into or walk ins of bother fighters? why can you upload them please !!! great work & quality! let me know this
,Placebo_obecalP,2012-05-08T10:16Z,"How exactly is 7 mins of the fight missing? Certainly not during the fight, as for ring walks, boring, I always fast forward those, you get the introductions + fight + between rounds + post fight interview, don't be greedy!"
,1Anarchy,2012-05-08T14:20Z,"Thanks for the upload but for some stupid reason it skips in certain parts, like someone edited out the second or two when they get tied together. Quality is fantastic tho."
,jcw21,2012-05-08T20:07Z,skips a lot im tring another one
,D1g1talStat1c0,2012-05-09T06:49Z,"@Rush - Thanks! I would doubt someone with very few uploads as well (lol), but we all have to start somewhere :)
@Mic - the walk-ins were left out because I just wanted to just post the fight, no other reason"

sync is horribly off. not to mention it took 15 hours to DL, and i have a pretty fast PC. what a waste.
--------------------------------------------------
well sounds like ur whole setup sucks. these are the things u want to google. 1st know ur internet speed, i have comcast 150 but blast an performance will do just fine. 2nd you need to set your router up for portforwarding so you can get all the traffic to the right place. 3rd you need to know how to utilize your cheat engine to its fullest. with the right setup i see between 8-13mbs without cheat engine and 19-26mbs with cheat engine. these are the things you need to know befor u start complaining. and if your out of syn it could be weak ram weak processor weak player i suggest vlc player. could be that all your hardware is out of date or it just sucks.http://i164.photobucket.com/albums/u19/tidus21221/gfgf.png this is for proof like i said do ur homework cuz i downloaded this video in 5min after i turned on cheat engine"

,sucka_mc,2012-05-11T23:46Z,"Well, here's how it worked for me.  I have a home server that my PS3 connects to.  I didn't notice that the audio and video had sync issues.  The big issue for me was that the video would pause now and again and by the 8th round, the pausing and starting and stopping got to where I couldn't watch it anymore.  Not sure what the issue is because when I would rewind it and replay it, it would be fine.  But then later, it would start again.  So I suspect it has to do with the streaming or the processors, not necessarily the video."
