ReleaseNotes:

19 is the Grammy Award-winning debut album from British singer/songwriter Adele. Citing influences as diverse as Etta James, Jill Scott, Bjork, Dusty Springfield,
Billy Bragg, Billie Holiday, Jeff Buckley, The Cure and Peggy Lee, Adele is a truly unique new artist. With her mix up of R&B and soul served up with a healthy dash of feisty London attitude, she spins beautiful dark stories of loves won and lost and sometimes just daydreamed about. Features the classic tracks Chasing Pavements and Hometown Glory as well as a cover of Bob Dylan s Make You Feel My Love.

Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic. HHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!

GREETS

Everyone that has supported us over the years.  You know who you are. We'd like to send another special Greetz to our dear RIAA snitcher David Brooks from Devon.
What did you tell them? That HHI is dropping rips like LSD? Call us crazy...We think they might be aware of our existance already. It's not nice to snitch. Especially stupid doing it to people like us. Here's our doc drop dedicated to you. We're sure the information looks familiar, as it's yours. Have a nice day, snitch. :)
