A - 10/10
V - 9/10

This has good video quality (you'll only notice that a 720p version is better in a big screen since the art style of the show compliments even 480p quality)

The audio is by far the best one I have found. This is even better than some of the uploads that calls itself ""HD"" (but in truth the audio is a bit muzzled and distorted if you listen closely)

Keep it up guys!"
