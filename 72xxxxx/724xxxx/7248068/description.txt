Build your very own cedar strip canoe based on some simplified plans featured on a woodworking magazine.  The build takes about 15-200 hours and between $450-$500 (2004 estimates).  It can be built with basic hand tools and can even be built from other woods, such as redwood, oak, pine, poplar, etc.
