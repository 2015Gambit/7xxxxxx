,godo12345,2012-05-20T07:35Z,can't find the subtitle for this. can anyone give the link for proper subs?
,omnimodis,2012-06-10T18:27Z,"Thanks!  Fantastic quality (A10/V10).  All titles and written descriptions in the video are in German, which is a little annoying - but subtitles can be downloaded from subscene. "
,gonberisha,2012-08-14T03:57Z,"I downloaded this few weeks ago. I watched most of the BBC documentaries. They do the real shit! And Im so lucky to watch them, also! (for free).
I've watched 2 parts and both of them were extremely interesting. There are a lot of moments that it takes your breath away!

What I dont find is proper english Subs!! I want to understand Every word on it! 
Anyone got propes subs??
