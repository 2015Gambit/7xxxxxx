chorus: 
my momma told me- 
one day I'ma grow up big and I'ma be a king 
and my poppa told me- 
it's ok to sing when shit hurts 
don't forget your dreams 
cuz' they'll get you through this 
So called life, they call living but I call it strange 
and I bet I'll do it 
cuz' I'm on my way and strong enough that I can shake the pain

verse 1: 
mr. sunshine, mr. rainstorm, 
meet me in the conference room we need to brainstorm 
need some middle ground, need an even keel 
but you're at war picking sides give me fever chills 
I'll take em' both like my flu shot broke 
I need the give and take to keep me out of that moat 
my head above water thoughts to those lost this week 
all these tragedies stay on repeat 
like we can't shake shit, I can't speak on it 
fist to the sky but I can't beat on it 
drink in my cup so I'm gon' sip on it 
cam newton's prolly pissed, he can't stiff arm em' 
all these levels of these relative problems 
and benevolence is elegance for those who can solve them 
i'm feeling pretty low like I"m stuck at the bottom 
but I know I'll rebound like the bulls with Rodman 
I am, just exactly what I will be 
just a guy who can rhyme n' chop ill beats 
one day I'll recover from what ails me 
till then I'm on that fuck-- what the sales be

verse 2: 
they talk about death, we're tryna live life 
while they're signal says left but they really going right 
but who cares they got nothing to improve upon 
meanwhile we past them, fast lane, rubicon 
so let the shitstorm rang in 
they try to dap us up, but we just leave em' hanging 
yeah- so let em' catch up with the language 
they can talk shit but you know that we can manage 
-- they say they tired of the metaphors 
they are only pissed that they never really ready for em' 
--- so go ahead and get ready for em' 
pop another bottle cuz' you gonna' need a steady arm 
- it's like we're living in the Tron Game 
lines are all blurred cuz' we're sippin on the bombay 
- john stock verse lebron james 
no competition when you factor in the time change 
Babe Ruth sucks--- fuck what the books say 
I could strike him out with 3 pitches in an arm sling 
yeah- and we can do anything 
momma said it's true and I put that on everything

verse 3: 
we don't ask for the doors to close in this life 
so we hoping... they keep em' open 
and if they shut those doors we'll smash the skylight 
till it's broken... and smell the roses 
need to take that time to find our own road 
so we focused... on what's golden 
and our gold don't shine it's not from no mine 
so we're not just living for a token
