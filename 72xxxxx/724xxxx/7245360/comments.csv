Video quality is great, but the sound quality isn't as good as it could be."
,seatides,2012-05-06T01:49Z,does anyone know if this has the nick logo on it?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-06T01:59Z,"yea, realize it after it was up but is nothing serious only a lower case letter "
,3htthe,2012-05-06T02:37Z,"Yea, the nick logos on it. nickHD but it's not really anything to be picky about. It's not really noticeable or bothersome, you should be okay with it."
,3htthe,2012-05-06T02:38Z,"Also, no 1080p this week?"
,CombustionMan1,2012-05-06T02:59Z,"After watching it is definitely 720p, and yes it has the Nick logo on it. It's not a leak so it still has that stuff."
