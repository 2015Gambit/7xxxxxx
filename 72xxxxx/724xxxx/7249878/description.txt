It seems like this one is not very easy to find in the share community. Well, here it comes: some called it pretentious and some just think this shit is sick.


It's Music for the Advancement of Hip Hop as released in 1999


18 tracks by Sole, Slug, Themselves, Buck 65, Skurge, Sixtoo, Pedestrian, Etc.


I think it's a great release and it has some value to the history of alternative hip hop.
