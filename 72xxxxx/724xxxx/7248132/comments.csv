,Heather4201976,2012-05-07T03:49Z,I am so grateful that someone still uploads AVI files for us.....The only down fall for me is I still have to format all from AFG because they all skip. Idk if there is something you can do or if I am they only one. They have all been real just to choppy to watch. Some feed back please from other users would be nice. Ty!!

I use WMC on Win7 x64
withShark007 codec pack with the built in Microsoft Audio & Video decoders disabled and all content redirected to directshow.
Directshow has a large and powerfull filter system. One of the keys reasons i use this is because i set up a video resize filter so ALL videos i play have there aspect ratio changed on the fly to 16:9 (sometimes i watch older 4:3 tv shows)"
