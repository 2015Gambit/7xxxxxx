My first torrent upload, and I hope for it to do decently well. Haunted Shores was a pain to come across and find, or at least it wasn't readily available. So that's why I'm uploading their stuff now. All of it is tagged properly without any release group crap. 

Also, for the love of music, SEEEEEED. Please.
