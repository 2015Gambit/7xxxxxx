This inspiring book tells the story of a young Belgian girl, gifted and strong-willed, who became a nun; the story of a life dedicated to the care of the sick, and of her personal struggle to reconcile the demands of her Order with her pride as a nurse.

She faced the heart-breaking and terrifying task of nursing the insane; and spent long, arduous years in the Congo. She witnessed the horrors of the Nazi invasion of Belgium, and risked her life aiding escaping British airmen.

True in all essentials, The Nun's Story unfolds an inner conflict of extreme emotional intensity. Here is a vivid human document of supreme appeal to every man and woman.
