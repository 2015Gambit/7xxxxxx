Requires TRUE BLUE and 3.55 to work. Working eboot already installed. Just download and play!

I had hard time trying to find a "working+no stupid password bullshit" -torrent for Saints Row: The Third. After nitpicking from the depths of internet, I finally had a complete and working copy of the game--and now you do aswell!

What to do:

1. Get a true blue dongle/clone, then install it.
2. Download and unrar (use winrar if you don't have any program(s) to unrar)
2. Transfer "BLES01342-[saintsrow3]" directory to your PS3's internal harddrive (don't know if external works); if you use multiman FTP/transfer to dev_hdd0GAMES
3. Play & thank me in your mind.
4. Seed
