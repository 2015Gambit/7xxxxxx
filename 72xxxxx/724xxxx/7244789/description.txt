Take on the computer alone or with friends in campaign mode, or challenge said friends to a tournament of mini-games including Capture-the-Flag, King-of-the-Hill, Bomber-Hockey, and of course Epic-Slow-Motion-Elimination.

Laugh gleefully as you land a perfectly-thrown sticky-bomb squarely on an opponent's face, or freeze them with an ice bomb and shatter them to bits with a punch; BombSquad's rag doll physics based gameplay ensures that every confrontation leads to a unique (and often hilarious) outcome.

Up to 8 players can get in on the action on a single Mac through BombSquad's support of keyboards, USB gamepads, Wiimotes, PS3 controllers, and XBox 360 controllers. You can even use iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads as controllers via 'BombSquad Remote', a free app available on the iOS App Store.

To victory!

Fixed in 1.2.4:
- fixed a bug where arrow keys wouldn't work properly when assigned to actions
- fixed an issue where music could stop playing if the computer is under heavy load
- fixed several very obscure bugs in team tournament games (thanks to the folks who turned on auto-bug-reporting!)

Introduced in 1.2.3:
- Added Quick-Play Onslaught and Runaround games with infinite randomly generated waves of enemies.
- The first few levels of the campaign are now much easier to complete.
- Scores are now shown even on losses in co-op games, and *all* scores now count on Onslaught training.
- Elimination games now show how many lives you have remaining when you spawn.
- Added opt-in automatic bug reporting to keep BombSquad as bug-free as possible in the future.
- Polished up the custom-soundtrack functionality a bit.
