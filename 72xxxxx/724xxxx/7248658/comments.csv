,ZeroAccend,2012-08-13T23:45Z,"Kilroy222 is what we call ""a troll"". Someone who spitefully tries to antagonize people and cause trouble/arguments with the only goal being his entertainment.

In response to his comment I challenge anyone to make a torrent and delete a comment off it. You can't do it b/c pirate bay doesn't give the ability to delete comments. So its obvious this person is intentionally going around trying to cause grief to people who actually upload legit stuff.

Kilroy222, you need to gtfo of the torrent community if you're not going to be help out and be productive.

That being said, if anyone here has downloaded this torrent please leave a comment saying whether it's legit, what it's quality is, are the ID3 tags done correct, etc..."
