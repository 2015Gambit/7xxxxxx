Blade Series Discography

While updating my music collection I realized I had cherry picked songs from the Blade soundtrack and decided to just get a fresh copy...and to pick up 2 and Trinity while I was at it.
What a pain in the ass it was finding all 3. So after I got all 3 I put them into a torrent and that's what you're downloading! :D

After getting all 3 discs I made sure they were all tagged correctly, named accordingly, and I attached album art and some lyrics to the ID3V2.

This torrent contains the Blade, Blade II, and Blade Trinity Soundtracks:
