,Dovahkiin1337,2012-05-08T03:25Z,"Got it to work, thanks."
,importer,2012-06-04T06:06Z,Hi guys just posting this if you are a mac user and dont feel confortable downloading k-lite pack (which doesn't work on mac anyway) or VLC NIghtly you can go to the app store and download smart converter (which is free) works fine gets rid of green screen and you can get it in to your itunes or other devices
,The_BLaCK_ReDNeCK,2012-06-14T21:32Z,"The quality is very good. 

V = 9 or 10
A = 7.5 or 8 (you can hear that it's tinny, but very acceptable.)

As fer the movie... yall will just see fer yallselves! Thanks fer the awesome upload mane. Will seed.

***NOTE*** TO ANYONE HAVING TROUBLE PLAYING THE VIDEO and you get a green screen: Do as recommended. Download VLC Nightly or Get the K-Lite Codec pack (which actually comes with its own media player that is able to play this particular video file--just make sure you install the K-Lite media player as well. It's callded 'Media Player Classic' or 'MPC'. You have the option of doing this during the set up). 

I don't know how to copy the codecs into other media players' folders... I'm actually having trouble finding the codec folder fer VLC (if it has one) since I don't wanna download the Nightly version. My regular VLC still gets the green screen. I don't think you can add codecs to VLC like in other media players . So yeah, I'm using K-Lite's default media player MPC."
,The_BLaCK_ReDNeCK,2012-06-14T21:45Z,"Also, I see that the VLC Nightly is actually an EXPERIMENTAL/BETA project at the moment, may not work at all, is NOT supported by the VLC Team, and is unstable. So... DOWNLOAD AT YER OWN RISK.

**SPELL CHECK**: 
In my first post, that word is supposed to say ""called"" not ""callded"". Stupid fingers."
