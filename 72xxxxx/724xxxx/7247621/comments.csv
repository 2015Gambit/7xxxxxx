,henryie,2012-05-07T08:49Z,Thanks very much for this. I have a problem with this file though it seems to download as a vlc file and its extension is .verovenlo so i cant put it on usb and watch it on the tv. I have tried to rename the file after downloading but it doesnt work. This the second one of this series thats its happend to. I have had to re-download it and remove your name and save it as .avi? does anybody know why this is happening? is it because he names his file .verovenlo and not .(space)vernvenlo? And please dont slate me in very grateful for this just wondering why its only happening with these files. Thanks
[V],verovenlo,2012-05-07T11:26Z,the extension is mp4 and it plays fine on my usb stick
,henryie,2012-05-07T14:40Z,"Yeah I cant really figure out either why it did that. I just re downloaded it. Thanks again for this series. We watching from Australia, its good to catch up on home tv thank you."
