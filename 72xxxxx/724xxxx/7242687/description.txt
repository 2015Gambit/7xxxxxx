Penny Play is back with a vengeance and determined to work her way up the rankings. Lyla Storm is also a dedicated fighter, but her record is nothing but a series of loses. Can she pull ahead and use the experience she has gained on the mat to dominate someone bigger and tougher than or? Or will she end up face down in a puddle of her own drool getting railed on the mat like she has become so accustomed to? Watch and find out!
