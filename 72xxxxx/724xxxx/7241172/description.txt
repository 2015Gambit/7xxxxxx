Ovnimoon Records presents and ambient meditative relaxation album of Ren Toudu called 'Intangible'!

To enjoy this one true ever changing moment. Ren Toudu is Eki Jokisalo, aka Sienis born the year 1981 in the southern parts of Stockholm, Sweden. His music production started out with a short period of instrumental hiphop followed by experimental electronic psychedelic music. After Eki's visit in Goa, India for the new years of 2000, there was inspiration and ideas for a new sound that resulted in the 'Sienis' and Ren Toudu projects.

So now, with influences from every sound wave he hears, he creates music that is focused on to make the dance floors go wild and crazy in a psychedelic frenzy with hard, funky, weird and twisted electronic party psy, as well as music to relax completely and melt away stress with some deep ambient waves.
