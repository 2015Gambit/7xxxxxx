,jayvon,2012-08-09T00:19Z,where do you originally download this from 
[H],shirepirate,2012-08-10T05:02Z,"@jayvon

FLAC from Usenet."
,XxMidnight-SunxX,2012-09-17T03:41Z,"Another great torrent. When it comes to movies, we go to YIFY. Just as with music, its all about HobbitTunes. Your the best.

(As a side note, I have been searching for a Tupelo Honey discog. Any chance we can get one with your superior audio quality?"
