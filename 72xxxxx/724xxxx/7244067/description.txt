Poem is a metal band from Athens, Greece. They have released one album, titled "The Great Secret Show".

The band was formed in 2006. With a wide range of influences and a love for experimentation Poem embarked on a sound adventure, defining its personal style from the very first songs.
Live performances are where Poem potential is best reflected. With many concerts in Athens and other major cities in Greece, they became quickly one of the best rock live acts around Greece. Opening acts for Ozzy Osbourne, Pain of Salvation, Paradise Lost, among others, have broaden the bands enthusiastic fan base.
In June 2009 they released their first album. At the moment, they are writing new songs for the follow-up to their debut.
