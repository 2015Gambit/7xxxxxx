Lyrics:
[Lil Wayne]
With everything happening today
You dont know whether youΓÇÖre coming or going
But you think that youΓÇÖre on your way
Life lined up on the mirror dont blow it
Look at me when Im talkin to you
You looking at me but IΓÇÖm lookin through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see youΓÇÖre not satisfied
And I dont see nobody else
I see myself IΓÇÖm looking at the

[Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
YouΓÇÖve been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkinΓÇÖ to each other again

[Lil Wayne]
Oh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
but IΓÇÖm with you when you re all alone
And you correct me when Im lookin wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pain
I see the scars that remain
I see you Wayne, Im lookin at the..

[Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
YouΓÇÖve been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkinΓÇÖ to each other again

[Lil Wayne]
Lookin at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my f-ckin dad
Light it up, thats smokinΓÇÖ mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my momma smile thats a blessin
I see the change, I see the message
and no message could been any clearer
So IΓÇÖm stared with the man in theΓÇª

[Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
YouΓÇÖve been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkinΓÇÖ to each other again

uhΓÇª

Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
YouΓÇÖve been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkinΓÇÖ to each other again

(so why are we talkin to each other again)
