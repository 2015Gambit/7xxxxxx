,TabascoQuesadilla,2012-05-07T08:40Z,"Why the repack?  Just curious, I'm not gonna bother DL'ing the other one anyway."
,TheHoudini,2012-05-07T11:02Z,Repacked because the original repeated about 20 secs every 10 mins or so.
,Suhilist,2012-05-07T11:14Z,"this is more like HDTV version than true 720p HD...video is like DvD rip on 23"" LCD =/"
,rickrich9,2012-05-07T11:51Z,Indeed the video looks like SD upscaled to HD
,dfcham,2012-05-07T12:28Z,"not great quality, although neither are any of the other HD copies available at the moment of typing. Probably better off to wait a few hours in hope of something better.

Nonetheless, thanks for your efforts DibyaTPB :)"
,TetsuoDark,2012-05-07T13:39Z,"horrible video & audio quality.. and it is censored...

A6/V5 +CENSORED with silence..  if you are really into this you should wait for a better copy or try the 1080i, which is what I am doing."
,tavi0312,2012-05-07T22:45Z,lame quality for a 720 :)
