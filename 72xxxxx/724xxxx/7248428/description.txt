I assume government regulators don't want to kill prosperity. But that's what their pages of rules do.

This video got suddenly popular this month. It asks the question, "What if you wanted America to fail?" The narrator, Ryan Houck, is here to discuss it.

Cliff Asness says current financial regulations make us less safe.

Mike Whalen explains how new requirements on hotel pools pointlessly kill good things.

In NYC, a dollar store was hit with a $30,000 fine for selling a toy gun. The toy didn't look fake enough. Now the store will probably close.

Douglas Holtz-Eakin used to run the Congressional Budget Office. He also sees that Americans are regulated to death.

Only a few politicians understand that. One is Senator Mike Lee from Utah. He'll explain how he tries to make life better from inside the government.
