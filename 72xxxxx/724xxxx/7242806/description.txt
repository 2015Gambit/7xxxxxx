***SwiftKit***

Updated version 3.3
4-5-2012



SwiftKit is a Toolkit designed for RuneScape players by conveniently bringing together all common RuneScape tools and features from all over into one single application.

SwiftKit is an unique browser. However, this unique browser isn't designed for browsing websites. 
It's designed for playing RuneScape in and, as a result, is full of RuneScape specific utilities, bookmarks to popular guides/websites, 
and anything else required to give you the edge while still remaining within the games rules.

SwiftKit will be able to assist you in whatever task you may be working on in-game, whether your task is doing a quest, following a clue scroll, or just leveling up your favorite skill. 
Swiftkit will even be able to assist you in planning your next task with its multiple planning utilities such as the Quest Planner, Calculators and Highscore tools.
