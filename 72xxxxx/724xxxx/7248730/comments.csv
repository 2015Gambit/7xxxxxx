,jessie.p.johnson,2012-05-08T03:43Z,"Yeah, I agree.  Nepotu, is it at all possible to upload just the single games?  The way Pirate Bay does their magnets now, I can't select just the game I want.  I've already seen games 1-3, but now I have to download them again just to see game 4.

I'm scared to think of the file size if this series goes to a game 7!

But, you are GOD, you keep doing your thing and I will keep downloading.  Just a small favor from one of your loyal followers.

Thanks again for all the Celtics games, my friend!

[V],Nepotu,2012-05-08T07:54Z,"@mentallyours & jessie.p.johnson: This isn't my way to do now, it is the way of some of the rippers. I can't do nothing about that. And yes, you can select, jessie, only the last game, even in the magnet link. I have writed this down in one of my previous games comment, here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7237976/NBA.2012.Playoffs.WCR1.G2-1(02_may).UTA.Jazz_SA.Spurs.720p
And you are both welcome!"
