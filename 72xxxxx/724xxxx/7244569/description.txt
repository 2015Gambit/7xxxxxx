This torrent contains tracks from Cliff Lin's three most recent albums, And Your World Will Burn, A Show of Blood, and This Is War, along with five other tracks of his that aren't in any set that I know of. 

I pulled the mp3 tracks from Riptide music's website because I got tired of playing youtube videos on repeat. >_< I tweaked the song properties/composer/etc - might have missed a few entries. This music is seriously epic - you've probably heard a handful of these tracks in some big game and movie trailers. The most recent trailer I've seen with Cliff Lin's music is the new Black Ops 2 "reveal" with the song Ultraviolence (on his This is War disc).

You can classify these tracks under heavy metal, industrial rock, electronica, action rock, soundtrack... it has a little bit of orchestral element and a bit of background vocals. It's all epic though - brilliant stuff and heavy action oriented.

If you aren't sure you'll like it, look up Cliff Lin in grooveshark and stream a few tracks, or check out the sample bits on amazon.com.
