    Vidya Bagchi arrives in Kolkata from     
    London to find her missing husband.      
    Seven month pregnant and alone in a      
    festive city, she begins a relentless    
    search for her husband. With nothing     
    to rely on except fragment from her      
    memories about him, all clues seem to    
    reach a dead end when everyone tries     
    to convince Vidya that her husband       
    does not exist. She slowly realizes      
    that nothing is what it seems. In a      
    city soaked in lies, Vidya is determined 
    to unravel the truth about her husband   
    - for herself and her unborn child even  
    at the cost her own life.
