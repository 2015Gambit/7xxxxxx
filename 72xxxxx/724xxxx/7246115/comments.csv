,pamona,2012-05-06T14:28Z,Why not give simply the version and the system requirements......

If it helps its v5.6.2 and because its on a mac (and a relatively small app at that), there's no need to worry about system compatibility issues."

If you go to MacUpdate:
http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/16857/pdfpenpro
You might notice that this version doesn't work below SnowLeopard. Good to know if you have ""only"" the Leopard. It's just a little effort to let that know to potential dowloaders....."

The one you linked to is a v5.8. This is a v5.6."

Sorry that I become a little bit tired of this unnecesarry discussion...If you look well on that link, down below in the window, in ""RELATED LINKS"" there are other verions mentioned with their corresponding System Requirements.
My point is simple: thank you for the upload, but... add as a basic service to the downloaders, always the version and the System Requirements to your uploadtext. Is that realy to much? Come on!"
