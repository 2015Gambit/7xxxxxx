(replace stars with the obvious)

this is where you download the outfits. what ya need to do here is download the character of your choice then go to

 C:Program Files (x86)CapcomStreet Fighter X TekkenresourceCMNbattle

now just drag the files ( not the folder name but all the files inside that folder) into that char folder. 

EG. nin, ogr ken. 

so once you have the outfits installed in there char folders, go ahead and open the costume changer programme. now, select the char from the drop down list and select cost 1 2 or 3. then hit the middle button to the right ( its in chinese so its the middle one you want) 

thats it!! your new costume is done. 

any questions just ask here ok. thanks in advance guys/ladies."

,kaiserphoenix,2012-05-17T13:13Z,"oh and one more thing (Speaking to the money hungry, greedy corporations around the world)

Because people download torrents from sites such as the pirate bay does not mean we will not go out and support your product further by purchasing it. 

Downloading helps us test out your product before we waste $60 on an half ass copy of a movie, music CD or video game, and it also help to prevent us from spending an additional $20 for content that we have already purchased!!

The economy is crumbling, and the citizens of the world do not have the financial stability to get scammed for shitty products. Freedom in sharing is the right step in creating a better future, so either get with the program, or get left behind with the other dipshits who refuse to evolve

,panem_08,2012-05-17T17:29Z,"@ewansdad thanks! But I seem to have a problem when clicking the middle button to the right in the costume changer programme. For example with Asuka, when I choose ASK_01 a message box appears that's in Chinese (I think), and when I try choosing ASK_02 or ASK_03, another message box appears saying 

""Unhandled exception  has occurred in your application. If you click Continue, the application will ignore this error and attempt to continue. If you click Quit, the application will close immediately.""

""Access to the path 'C:Program FilesCapcomStreet Fighter X TekkenresourceCMNbattlecharaASKASK_01.2ry' is denied.

,ewansdad,2012-05-17T19:37Z,"@panem_08 ahhhh yes. silly me. i forgot to mention that you have to run it as admin. sorry mate. i recommend that you go into properties on the exe and in compatability, make sure to check RUN as admin. Cheers"
,kaiserphoenix,2012-05-17T22:35Z,"I got them to work properly thanks a lot ""ewansdad"". The issue was I didnt run the costume program as administrator, funny how that can make such a huge difference when using software. Now the only thing left is the 12 characters DLC and we will have an actual full copy of a great fighting game, instead of the half ass copy capcom is trying to scam many out of for $80!!"
