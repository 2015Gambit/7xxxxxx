Not restricted to the workplace, but covering every social and domestic situation, this guide offers readers the knowledge and understanding to be able to use and interpret body language more effectively. More than 90% of all face-to-face communication is non-verbal, and the silent messages of body language often reveal more than the spoken word in conveying true feelings, highly influencing first impressions and the self-image we project to others. This guide includes practical exercises to enhance understanding of non-verbal communication, and covers such aspects of body language as special features of the workplace and non-verbal communication in international contexts.
