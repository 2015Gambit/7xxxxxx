This is derived from an .m4v torrent.
The video is NOT re-encoded, but a useless long segment is removed from the end.
The audio had to be re-encoded to CBR AC3 in order to maintain synchronization with the variable-FRAME-rate x264 video. VFR video is notorious for making it difficult to maintain sound synchronization.

You're on your own to find a player that can do a good job with this, as well as to have hardware and software that can present H264/x264 satisfactorily. x264 is not usually found in today's avi-container files.

If all else fails, install Avidemux and use it as a player. (Answer "No" to the questions that pop up when you open the file.)

Languages: various local languages, plus excellent hard-coded English subtitles.
