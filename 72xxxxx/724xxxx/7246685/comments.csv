It's just a small compilation (12 mins) of some of the good/funny scenes. Also it wasn't meant to go on the pirate bay but since YT is an ass when it comes down to copyright infringement I thought I put it here as revenge. 

Oh and LoK does have a 9.4 on IMDb http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1695360/

Though I do agree that these kind of videos are better per season than per 5 episodes. Oh well.

Download and you may like it. :)"
