I don't have anything that PLAYS Blu-Ray so if you could confirm that this isn't, I'd be willing to seed for a long time due to the increasing lack of non-Blu-Ray Torrents."

blu-ray isn't what you think it is.
Mainly, it is a disc that can contain larger files (hence the higher resolution)
When people say blu-ray rip, they are giving you a video container file that was ripped from the blu-ray, you do not need a blu-ray player or anything to read a video container file like .mkv .avi .mp4 etc. etc., however, if you get a blu-ray DISC, you will need a blu-ray player."

Japanese audio is great, however the English is awful. "

Okay, so could I take this file, download it, convert it to MPEG-II and burn it to a regular DVD? I was under the impression that you had to have special shit to do that."
