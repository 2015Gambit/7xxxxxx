LOUFA KAI APALAGH I-4
Vassilis Katsikis

case:
A group of recruits, who each for its own reasons for wanting to get relief from the army, forced to serve as I4. The company will find itself in a border island with ordered service: you must play the "hares" and coexist with the commando prepared for a great exercise. The difficulties and their incredible Hazing will strengthen the company, and the humor and ingenuity of the "hare" would overcome ... the militarism!
