K-Holes - Dismania-WEB-2012-FRAY

The K-Holes emergered from guttural rock n rollers Golden Triangle and 
the Black Lips, so there is no doubt that these five New YorkerΓÇÖs know 
what they are doing. Sexy and sinsister escapism, Dismania, the bandΓÇÖs 
sophmore release, takes the distortion, feedback, and saxophone of the 
StoogesΓÇÖ Funhouse and drives it hard, head on, into Teenage Jesus and 
the JerkΓÇÖs car. Rock n roll should never be safe! 

The K-Holes are rock n roll.
