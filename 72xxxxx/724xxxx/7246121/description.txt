38 12 "Tunnel Vision" TBA TBA May 5, 2012 212 
Upon discovering the locations of four relics from the Vaults of Iacon, the Autobots split up and travel to each location 
simultaneously to retrieve each relic. Arcee, Bumblebee, Jack and Miko head to New York City to find the first relic, which 
is buried somewhere deep in the city's underground subway tunnels. During their search, however, they are attacked by Knock 
Out and an Insecticon, who are also looking for the relic.

[b]Note[/b] There is at least 1 slight glitch in this where the signal was lost at 19.50, I tried editing it out and it just made things worse so I've left it as is.
I will do a proper of this episode next weekend when I am able to get a better source.
