,SCSA420,2012-05-04T16:08Z,"There is NOTHING wrong with the video file!!! Joe Plum is just a leecher who isn't happy because he doesn't know how to install Klite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with media player classic and configure it properly for mkv playback. 

Media Player Classic: works fine
PowerDVD: works fine
Windows Media Player: works fine
so use one of the above or burn the video file to DVD -R or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player does.

does not show the video only the audio in VLC because VLC is CRAP 
so use one of the above
