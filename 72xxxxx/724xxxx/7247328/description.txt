Through the flicker of dim projector bulbs and the warble of optical soundtracks a blueprint for better living in the Atomic Age was spelled out in no uncertain terms. Now just as you remember them, Fantoma presents these collections of sex education & drug prevention. In case you havenΓÇÖt learned your lesson, get another dose of drug hysteria and the bird & bees with such films: 

Drugs Are Like That, 
Stranger Danger: (Red Light, Green Light), 
Alcohol is Dynamite, 
Parent To Child About Sex, 
Drug Effects, 
Sally, 
Focus On LSD, 
Girls Beware, 
Keep Off the Grass, 
Sudden Birth
Innocent Party

All films ripped to .150 bits per pixel, MKV

Anybody else remember this bullshit from school?
