With the help of the CIA, Rebecca tracks the airplane but when the authorities search it, Michael is nowhere to be found. In Milan, Agent Dax Miller questions Sloane, the sole passenger on the aircraft but she insists Michael was never there. She also wants her employer to give the order to eliminate Rebecca. Rebecca is surprised when her friend Mary suddenly shows up in Rome. Michael meanwhile awakens in the bedroom of a large house and is being watched over by a machine-gun toting guard.
