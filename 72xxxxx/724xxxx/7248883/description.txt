CyberGate is an advanced remote control solution. It is designed to control a large number
 of servers, in order to allow the administrator to easily control his network. CyberGate 
is only available for now for Windows platforms as a Native application, without requiring 
any Framework (such as .NET), Virtual Machine (such as Java Virtual Machine) or any Extra 
Dynamic Link Libraries or shared libraries being a step forward on innovation and an 
advantage over other applications on the market that have reduced installation and usability



CyberGate can connect over either a LAN or the Internet in a variety of connection modes.
 This makes it an indispensable tool for small and medium-sized businesses looking for a 
multi-purpose and yet affordable remote control and help desk solution. However,
 it can also scale to larger environments with thousands of remote computers and servers.
 CyberGate utilizes a Client-Server model with two stand-alone components installed
 separately, being the Server separated in 3 different types
