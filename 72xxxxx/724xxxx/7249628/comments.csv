,Gnob77,2012-05-07T19:31Z,Pretty good cam I'd say 7/7 sadly.. none of the German has subtitles.. and considering this is about Nazis.. uhm.. well.. there's a lot of German. ~sad face~
,kraftseeder,2012-05-07T23:34Z,The image is good for a TS but the audio is pretty bad. But it works to watch
,MindFlip,2012-05-07T23:35Z,If anyone finds any subs plz do post them here :) 
,seedMeister,2012-05-08T11:41Z,this film is so awesome it's a shame to watch it as TS
,FRivera,2012-05-08T14:45Z,"v2 a3 it's not even that good for a TS, this flick shouldn't be watched like this."
,bankmat,2012-05-08T19:10Z,"I think is quite watchable...

The Spoken German does NOT destroy the context if you know ""some"" German, use your imagination...

For a cam, when there was none... it is more then acceptable... period.

(Now that i have seen it, i absolutely going to buy it when it is released on DVD, it is worth it, at least to support the movie makers...)"
,Tankerbot,2012-05-08T19:34Z,"This definitely needs subtitles. (someone who knows German can put together a SRT file please! ;) )

I am not advocating that they have them speak English in the US/UK release, but for most of the world to enjoy the movie, there needs to be subtitles. I like many others know 0% German and thus most of the movie will be lost to me without translation. I won't really watch it until someone releases one with subtitles."
,thcfreak666,2012-05-08T20:58Z,This isnÂ´t watchable. Poor vid and sound in a overzised file.
,devilscalling,2012-05-09T06:35Z,if anyone can get this in english i would love you. information on DVD so far for me is really lacking and so far there is no information on a american/canadian DVD release..unless somebody knows otherwise
,Levy_NR,2012-05-10T22:46Z,"Nope. Still have to wait for better version, DVDrip at least..."
,Taurich,2012-05-22T08:39Z,"Wait, there's no subtitles?
Why do people even bother uploading foreign language films to an english audience without subs

Waste of bandwidth"
,bearklaws,2012-05-26T22:57Z,"Do none of you foreign bashers realize that you are downloading from a Swedish website, and complaining about English this, and how these movies are targeted for and English audience. Why would Sweden make and English website. Thank the up-loader for giving us free crap. Thank you HeroMaster for letting us Americans watch this movie for free. "
