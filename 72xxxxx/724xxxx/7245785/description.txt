First download the torrent and mount the iso's with your favorite Iso Mounting Program I use Virtual Clone Drive, then install in order the iso's, first the Medieval II and then the Kingdoms. When you finish installing everything run the patches that are inside the Kingdoms folder. At the end just replace the files with the Crack's in the installation directory.

Enjoy!
