[b]Akai Katana XBOX360-COMPLEX[EtGamez][/b]

[b]Description:[/b] 

Requiring human sacrifices to unleash their immense destructive power, these swords have been used by the empire to crush neighboring countries. However, all the bloodshed and power gained through sacrificing close family members has made some of the swordsmen reconsider. With new fighter planes and the powered up swords at their disposal, this small band of rebels now fight back against the tyrannical empire. Created specifically with the Xbox 360 in mind, Akai Katana is the first CAVE release to feature horizontal combat in sumptuous HD and eye-watering full 16:9 support. Prepare for a new definition of ΓÇÿbullet-hellΓÇÖ!
