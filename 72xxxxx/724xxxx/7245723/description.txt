 This is The Smith's Bible Dictionary. Its a four Volume version, its a Scan.

The only problem is that its not indexed in anyway, I have it in 4 files ; containing each of the four volumes. 

The scan is done well. its just not indexed. i would do that, if i knew how.

And unless you have a fast computer, higher then intel pentim 4, then then you would have to wait a long time for the PDF to generate the images for each page. theres a lot of pages, that's way.


But this is good, if you can get it indexed.  The Smiths bible Dictionary is the best,. and this rare 4 volume makes it even better.  

needs indexing.
