I have recently downloaded many of your torrents. They are great and I have been replacing my movie collection as your torrents are quality. They are always small and size and fantastic picture. I adore your 3D content you have uploaded as well. Nobody can quite do it like you can. Thanks so much for all your hard work!
xoxo"

,digdug101,2012-05-06T22:49Z,"blu-ray is ciniavia protected, if it is just the audio mute message set ps3 time ahead an hour and the audio will be back on. only last about twenty min then when ciniavia mutes it set time ahead again. if you dont wanna do that download the dvd rip. im open for suggestions on any way to get around ciniavia"

,biblionx7,2012-05-07T11:14Z,"Love your torrents-quality is always spot on and this one is no exception (A=10, A=10). Not impressed with the movie, though. Perhaps it's just me as I'm generally not impressed with British acting.
Cheers."

To bypass the cinvia on my PS3 , Ijust  stream to my X-box( they do not support cinvivia) What I ultimately had to do was build a media box out of old com. parts and now everything is right as rain :)"

,ChasUGC,2012-07-08T19:12Z,"I thought it was a good movie, a little dark in the genre, but good all the same. I won't say anything else or it will spoil it. A=10. V=10, M=7."
,che3to,2012-08-08T20:49Z,"Awesome Quality! Works on my Motorola Atrix 2.
V:10
A:9

This movie was meh. Pretty good story but I kind of was a bit down. My sister liked it so I am sure some of you all would like it."
