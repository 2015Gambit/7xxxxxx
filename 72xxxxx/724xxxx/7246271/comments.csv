Bhai I'm not degrading this torrent.Those who have bandwidth problem or need in small size then they should definitely go for this one.Quality of your torrent is good if we consider size.I've simply provided the link for those peoples who don't wish to compromise with quality.It's my personal perception.No offense, Please."
