,Malfeg,2012-05-05T08:21Z,When i unrar it there is nothing in the bin file please help!
,fitz093,2012-05-05T10:08Z,having the same problem as malfeg and praveen. game will unrar but skips the rebuilding process. I have tried manually unraring but to no success
,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-05-05T10:14Z,"@praveen0553 - Just click the magnetic link. (The magnet icon that says get this Torrent and click ok on the popup after that. Will dowload to the specified folder. I am guessing you have utorrent already, if not google it.
NOTE when you click on the link and the popup comes hen you must clinck ok, the popup will be blank. Just press ok, the file is defititly there and will download. After a minute check your ""files"" tab in Utorrent and you will see it is there. Hope this is what you wanted."
,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-05-05T10:16Z,"Ok, seems as if you guys having different problems to what I thought. My bad. gansuk.... they need your help. "
,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-05-05T10:23Z,"Keep the KaOS rips coming Gansuk, always can rely on their rips, and your uploads of them. A big Thank you"
,Ximmortal,2012-05-05T11:16Z,anyone not having any problems with this torrent?
[V],gansuk,2012-05-05T12:12Z,"unfortunately the ripper of this one made a script mistake causing most of the rebuild to be skipped. so you can expect a tiny fix file, and a repack which wont need one. apologies from the krew."
,fitz093,2012-05-05T12:15Z,My guess is some of the arc files are corrupt which is preventing the game from rebuilding 
,fitz093,2012-05-05T12:17Z,"thanks gansuk for the heads up, sorry for the multiple posts"
[V],gansuk,2012-05-05T12:58Z,"there's an error on unpack, to fix it just unrar manually to where u want the game and replace extras/tools/kaos.ini with this 1 http://www kaoskrew org/kaos.ini (add .)

then click ~unpack~.bat and everything should run as normal."
,cupid1991,2012-05-05T14:08Z,"gansuk its fantastic what your doing, but that link to your website is broken nothing to download?? :("
,Ximmortal,2012-05-05T15:15Z,thanks gansuk it works . @cupid1991 for the link u have to put in the(.) then copy the text from the webpage to kaos.ini file located in extras
[V],gansuk,2012-05-05T15:42Z,this one is faulty. grab this one instead. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7244418/Sniper.Elite.V2.RePack-KaOs
[V],gansuk,2012-05-05T17:56Z,"here's a easier fix for this version.

1: extract manually to were u want the game.
2: download this file www kaoskrew org/Sev2-fix.zip (dont forget to add the full stops back into the link)
3: Extract the file to your games root folder.
4: click ~unpack~.bat"
