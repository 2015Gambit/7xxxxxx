,MikeyMetal,2012-05-06T16:48Z,"Nepotu - First and foremost, I'd like to thank you very much for being the real star of this years playoffs. Your torrents have kept me sane. Thank you bro! 
I normally use DavkaBT, but they are so slow in getting the latest games up, it's so annoying.
Could you please upload the Bulls/76'ers Game 2 in 720p please? 

Again, thanks for all your work! You're a gentleman and a scholar.  :))"
