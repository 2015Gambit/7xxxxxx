,heid62,2012-05-07T16:23Z,This is a clip from the film Crossroads. It is the duel at the end. Joe Satriani is NOT in this. It was Ry Cooder who played the slide guitar and Steve Vai beat himself with the solo mimed quite well by the karate kid. Now I was expecting a short documentary on how they prepared to film this. What I got was a badly encoded 4:3 mpeg film clip. You would be better off downloading the whole film rather than this mislabeled crap!
