i hope all of you like it like i do ... happy inno tool for all of you ...

,ravibose49,2012-05-05T11:43Z,hi globeplus can you rip any game that i say risen 2 dark waters or binary domion or sniper elite v2 or street fighter x tekken or resident evil operation roccon city
[V],globeplus,2012-05-05T12:09Z,"To ravibose49 : iÂ´ll take a look on the last one you mention , i wasnÂ´t working any game because i was really busy with Easy DosBox with Dosshell integration with more than 850 dosbox games running in 1 click without console window at the background and perfect resolution to launch the games then i finish with an appropriate installer the Glomulator Ruby 2.0 with more than 60 playable games systems with the latest emulators versions and now this fantastic GUI for Inno Setup installer program ... only now i can have some time to take a look at any game ...

Cheers and happy tools for all of you ."
