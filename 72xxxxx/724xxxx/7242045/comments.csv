,erin1980,2012-09-13T06:40Z,"spifkitten99 does not know what he's talking about. Somebody else's download speed can be a very good implication of how your download is going to go. Especially if the user posts download speed during, or directly after download and you begin download directly after the user posts the speed.

spifkitten99, you should probably end all your posts with a question mark."
