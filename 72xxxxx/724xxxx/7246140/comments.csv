,l3m1um,2012-05-06T18:15Z,"I think Nickelodeon screwed up their own release, but let me know if McPay's has the same issue."
,zeropioneer,2012-05-07T02:30Z,"Yep, same issue on McPay's... "
,zeropioneer,2012-05-07T03:08Z,TvTeam's 480p release has the exact same issue unfortunately
,RORLVR1,2012-05-07T08:54Z,Is there any way to get a good version? Maybe someone records it off HDTV regularly or something?
,McPay,2012-05-07T19:47Z,"There is a 720p HDTV release by OOO.
If it is complete, i will upload it!"
,zeropioneer,2012-05-07T23:08Z,Thank you sir!
