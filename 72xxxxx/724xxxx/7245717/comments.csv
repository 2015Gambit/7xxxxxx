I wonder if you possess their 1983 album Vocabulary and better known and probably their best album Recurring Dreams from 1984. I couldn't find them in your previous posts, but I could be wrong.
Thanks 80z once again for your hard but greatly appreciated work.
Cheers."

,geek6200,2012-05-08T01:26Z,"just want to say I appreciate all the hard work you do making these old platters new again. I'm finding it hard to locate a good mp3 version of an '83 album buy a band called ""The Pumps"". The album was called ""Gotta Move"". Had a couple couple of great songs on it ""Coffee with the Queen"" and a song called ""Success"". I believe they latter turned into the band Orphan. I see there is also a combo CD of The Best of Orphan & The Pumps that came out a few years back. Can you help with this? Thanks!!!"
