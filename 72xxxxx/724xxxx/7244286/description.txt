I converted TNEs mp4 source to xvid. however the mp4 had this repeating
weird clicking sound in audio.. I dont believe its my codecs as
it was in all players some of which use own internal codecs.. 

anyhow i did what I could with it.. I cleaned up the sound in a editor
 and pieced it back with the xvid video..

its 347mb 1000bit mp3 audio 128bit 640x352

take it or leave it.. but its good enough for me 

help to seed if grabbing

enjoy
