seems to me they have included the 2 specials as lead ins

so name they how you want I guess

think we forced to go tvrage and tnes naming

so if you think your missing an episode thats why.. its all screwed up
again :)

so if could be also called S02E03 or S02E02

I know the press release did say it had one lead in special for the new season and
the other special was at end of S01

but i dont know.. name how you want i guess

simplest is just called S02E02-E04 then
your covered for the naming..
as next week E05 comes out :)"
