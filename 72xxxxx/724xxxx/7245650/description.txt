In 1990 they started a band, their first album went gold, then sold 13 million copies.
The band would go on to sell more than 60 million records worldwide and perform in nearly
every major city in the world. Now they have opened their vault, with 20 years of rare
and never-before-seen footage to tell their extraordinary story. From one of the great
directors of our generation.
