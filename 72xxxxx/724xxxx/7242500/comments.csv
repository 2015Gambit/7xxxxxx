maybe it is more fast, resumable to download via torrent. some users with GSM connection wich have unstable connection can resume downloading after connecting again from disconections.
sorry for my bad english, hope you know my point."

You're welcome ;)

@kdawgcam
Besides to what Rraa mentioned, you need to install adobe downloader to get this software from Adobe! While here you have the offline installers for Adobe Flash Player without the need to install Adobe Downloader.

@Rraa
Thank you."
