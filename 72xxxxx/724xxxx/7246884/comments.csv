,slicknick610,2012-05-06T19:02Z,@snakesweat I know the broadcast was 4 hours and 10 mins. That's why it took so long too. It's almost 5 times the size of an hour broadcast.

,slicknick610,2012-05-12T05:08Z,I missed the MX preview too. They changed the time on me. It originally said 1am then they changed it to 11pm. My cablebox guide didnt know either.
,A.l.x.,2012-05-19T21:33Z,the 2012 MX preview is on allisports.com along with every first moto 250/450 live simulcast w/fuel tv.....watched the preview that originally aired on NBCSN last night....the 2nd motos will be on NBCSN later in the day
