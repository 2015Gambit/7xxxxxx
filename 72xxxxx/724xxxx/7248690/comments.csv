[V],Nepotu,2012-05-07T21:41Z,u r welcome! The quality is not very good but watchable.
,13beat,2012-05-07T23:38Z,Thank you very much!
,pxpierre,2012-05-07T23:56Z,"Thanks to Nepotu & seeders.

It's great to have the full Portugal MotoGP racing events in one torrent and to be able to choose which one to download in the torrent client > file.

Really appreciated here in Central America where one can't see that shite!

Moto3 races much more exiting than MotoGP this year IMO."
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-08T03:11Z,"u both r welcome, my friends! I think that the motors in Moto3 are more equals."
,pxpierre,2012-05-08T04:09Z,"It's more than the motors. The budget of the teams  are more similar. The problem with MotoGP is that there is a 20 to 1 budget difference like in F1. Factory bikes @ 2 million a piece vs CRT @ $80,000...

If you could do also the BSB (British Superbike), probably one of the most competitive series, it would appreciated.

I could only find a Russian Eurosport version of the May 6 2012 race which I uploaded here: BSB.2012.Round03.Oulton.Park.Eurosport2.MPEG-2.Russian-ashu http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7250608"
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-08T07:44Z,"Well yes, you have reason. With BSB, I don't know, I'll try to help you, if I find something different than round 3. Cheers bro!"
,akrapovicSBK,2012-05-12T21:33Z,"great stuff!
and yes the BSB races are the best in the world at this time, too bad that they are very tough to find."
,phatkev,2012-05-19T06:20Z,"Thanks Nepotu, here in Australia we get a very poor and limited coverage of moto gp. I also agree that the moto 3 is a lot more exiting this year."
,phatkev,2012-05-19T06:24Z,"Thanks Nepotu, here in Ausrtalia we get a very poor and limited coverage of moto gp. I also agree with pxpierre that the moto 3 is a  more equal this year."
,SwedishMeatball,2012-05-19T16:09Z,"I almost hate to tell you this, but the races are NOT in english!!!!!"
