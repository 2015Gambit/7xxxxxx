Bio from The GuardianΓÇÖs New band of the day feature:
Hometown: Herefordshire.
The lineup: Mary, Tom, Esther, Vlad.
The background: WeΓÇÖve said it before and weΓÇÖll say it again: itΓÇÖs hard to be soft. We remember the first time we heard about the Magic Numbers ΓÇô who todayΓÇÖs new band have supported ΓÇô and being told that they were a 21st-century Mamas & Papas. Frankly, we were excited by the prospect of a young group, two boys and two girls, from the alternative side of the fence, being prepared ΓÇô brave enough, even ΓÇô to down tools and allow their voices to sing free, minus any instrumental melee. Then we went to see them live, and of course they bottled it, and turned out to be just another indie band, their voices barely audible above the amplified guitar/bass/drums din.
