,JoeAwe,2012-05-07T06:13Z,Finally! I only wish this popular show would get a priority over other shows.
,mosamlit,2012-05-07T06:13Z,"@shanebb.....my thoughts exactly. 

It seems like it's getting worse with these fakes."
,darkizzle,2012-05-07T06:14Z,It was a nice episode. I just didn't care for Melisandre using her shadow monster to reanimate Renly's corpse and using it to convince his soldiers to side with Stannis. Even in the book I thought it was a bit unbelievable! But oh my god that last scene with Cersei discovering Shae and chopping her head off to force Tyrion to leave her children alone was exactly how I imagined it! Too bad Sansa is going to be traumatized now. But as long as her madness drives her to stabbing Joffrey in the season finale I dont care. Spiller people complained I didnt put any spiler tags so there!

And , most likely, this will not play on many multimedia devices !!

I mean this one needs a Proper !!
