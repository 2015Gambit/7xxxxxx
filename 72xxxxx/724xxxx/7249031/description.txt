1. Unrar panzer corps patch1.04.rar

2. Move the files from the newly created folder into your installation folder and overwrite all the files and folders when prompted 

3. Unrar the files from DLC'39.rar and move them into your installation folder

4. Unrar the files from the GC40.rar and move them in the DLC folder

The DLC folder should contain the following folders : Uninstall and GC39 (from the DLC'39 archive) and GC40(from the GC archive)

5. Use the regfiles that suits your operating system:

a. Panzer Corps DLC Windows x86.reg is for Win Xp, Vista and 7 on 32bits 
b. Panzer Corps DLC Windows 7 x64.reg is for Win7 on 64bits

Do not forget to edit the regfiles at the DLC1_PATH and DLC2_PATH: you have to put manually your Panzer Corps installation folder:

Example:

"DLC1_PATH"="C:\Games\Panzer Corps\Panzer Corps\DLC\GC39"
"DLC2_PATH"="C:\Games\Panzer Corps\Panzer Corps\DLC\GC40"

"DLC1_PATH"="D:\Program Files\Panzer Corps\Panzer Corps\DLC\GC39"
"DLC1_PATH"="D:\Program Files\Panzer Corps\Panzer Corps\DLC\GC40"

6.a. If you are on Windows Vista/7 create under UsersusernameMy DocumentsMy GamesPanzer Corps a folder named Mods and copy (not move, but copy) the content of the DLC folder: the GC39, GC40 and Uninstall folders (username = your PC username; example UsersMattMy DocumentsMy GamesPanzer Corps)
  b. If you are on Windows XP create under Documents and SettingsusernameMy DocumentsMy GamesPanzer Corps a folder named Mods and copy (not move, but copy) the content of the DLC folder: the GC39, GC40 and Uninstall folders (username = your PC username; example Documents and SettingsMattMy DocumentsMy GamesPanzer Corps)
 
7. Run the game and select New Game. You should see in the middles a new button called More Campaigns. Press it and you'll notice the Grand Campaign '39 and Grand Campaign '40. Select whichever you wanna play and enjoy.

Thanks are going to the russians that managed to crack the update/DLC and to the germans who pointed where could I get it. 



The original Win7 X64 regfile didn't worked properly because was poorly edited

That's how it looked
