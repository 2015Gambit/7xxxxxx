,dubzproductionz,2012-05-07T06:22Z,@CODY: Would you be able to tell me how to load or use the subtitles using windows media player?
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-05-07T15:19Z,"@dubzproductionz:

Not without DirectVobSub installed [the subtitle filter for Windows Media Player] !!

The subtitle must have exactly the same name with video file [excepting extensions - eg: .avi and .srt] and ...put them together in the same folder.

But there are many very good mediaplayers [BSPlayer, VLC, KMPlayer, MediaPlayer Classic, GomPlayer etc...] with a lot of options to configure !!

 Play -> Captions and Subtitles -> On if available


Good luck."
