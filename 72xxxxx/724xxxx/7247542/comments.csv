Thank you!"

What do you mean exactly with 64bit savegame support?

This game works perfectly on all W7 32/64bit Versions.
Its also Large-Adress aware so it can consume more then 2gb of ram."

As you will see on the screenshots, max sure to check the lightning/graphics settigs are all on maximum."

You should check if your Motherboard chipset/Graphics Card are up to date.

Also check if W7 is fully updated, and Latest version of Directx9 installed.

The torrent / game is fully working"
,Jagader,2012-05-30T18:44Z,"shotta why is this so small compared to the original which is 3.3 GB. You must have ripped something or compressed it...  the other torrents say that after extracting its around 10gb

I want to play the full game with this mod and I am thinking on what to choose this or the other torrent and manually install mod.."
,mauzr,2012-06-08T11:31Z,"tried few times,i get this while extracting
ERROR:archive data corrupted (decompression fails)"
,mauzr,2012-06-08T12:57Z,"nevermind, i got that error because there was not enough space on main C: drive (i was extracting to D: drive and exe was there too, didnt think that i need space on other drive)
thanks
btw the torrent speed is incredible, i got 12 MB/s "
