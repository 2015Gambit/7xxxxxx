Just in case you've been living under a rock, or perhaps maybe you're new to the piratebay, but extremezone uploads most of the quality torrents here on the piratebay. He is well known and well respected.  His uploads are not fake. So go spew your nonsense somewhere else. 

And by the way, you commented the same message four times in a row.  You only have to submit your comment once. Your comment might not appear right away. just reload the page or come back later and you'll see it."

,Hishik,2012-05-12T17:31Z,"For people saying this game is shit and that it's too short...

I beat RE 1,2, and 3 within 5-6 hours each this year after downloading them off PSN (granted I never played the Alternate stories) The length of the campaign isn't that big of deal in a market where most games are 6-9 hours in length anyways. Play it on a harder difficulty AND with friends. I could understand people upset with paying 60 dollars for it because it ISN'T worth 60 dollars.

Then again I didn't consider L4D2 worth 60 dollars when is came out either. But, there IS fun to be had when playing on a powerful enough system with your friends. The controls are nowhere near as clunky as people say. I really enjoy the melee move sets that you can learn. Like kicking the feet out from under a guard and sticking your gun to his face is the shit.

If you play on a harder difficulty with friends the game can be really enjoyable and even at moments suspenseful. For example, In one particular moment I was fighting with my friends in a hall and two of them were infected. We didn't have any anti virus spray and we were down to our last bit of health when they turned and killed us. It was a pretty intense moment.

The game isn't supposed to be horror, it's supposed to deliver a fun co-op experience and too a degree it delivers.

7/10 because the game isn't perfect but it can provide some ""OHHH SHIIIT"" moments while playing with friends.

Don't spend more than 20-30 dollars on this game unless you plan on playing with good friends."

NO ONE..Can afford a measly $1000 bucks cpu and couple of video cards? What a fucking joke HAHA!! You think that's expensive? Try a family with 2 kids a home, cars, insurance etc etc etc. I don't live with mommy and daddy anymore little boy."
,Zipgun,2012-05-15T09:47Z,"@savagecabbage

LOL! Usually I won't even bother with kids like you. How can I afford a measly $5000+ PC?

Easy I'm not a 10 year old who lives with mommy and daddy. I own a home, cars and family with 2 kids who are probably older than you're broke ass I work and pay my bills. 

And you obviously don't read as I said I use torrents as DEMO'S?  And like the other dude said its free. ;) Sorta like you tho you're most likely broke.  Just because you can't afford stuff doesnt mean the rest of us can't. NO ONE can afford it... Haha now that's rich!!

Ok enough with the kindergarten crap. Anyone have a real fix for the gun sound bug? From what i'm seeing so far on other forums seems like either its the game itself or the c word. In anycase this game isnt worth the effort to fix anyway. Seems like just another left 4 dead clone."

Yeah I totally believe you, you really sound ""mature"" enough to have two kids. If that is true though, then don't you think you are a bit old to be flaming at people online, surely only kiddo's do that kind of thing, maybe your mommy and daddy didn't raise you right. I wonder how your kids will turn out."

Nah, it isn't top notch but it's a considerably nice PC especially for people around here who know nothing about PC Hardware. I went to the Best Buy here and they are still trying to get people to buy GTX 9800's, it's sick.

Anyways I can STILL run almost all games 100 % max so a game like this shouldn't be a problem especially when it looks no where near as good as Witcher 2 and I have hardly any issues with that.

Also, people.... do yourself a favor and at least make it past the first mission that one was pretty shit.... But I enjoyed the others. My main complaint is the gun sound issues."
