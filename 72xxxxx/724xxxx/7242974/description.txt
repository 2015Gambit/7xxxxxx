"Class War"

Harry is forced to re-visit an old case 
when Malcolm returns with distressing news 
about a gang member who has wrongly been 
convicted of killing a cop and is 
sentenced to death. Meanwhile, Adam and 
Phoebe defend the British owner of a 
quaint tea shop in a rough part of town 
who authorities realize stole multiple 
works of art back in his homeland. With 
little time to prepare, Adam must 
improvise a plan to prevent this changed 
man from being extradited back to Britain

Evolve... or die.
