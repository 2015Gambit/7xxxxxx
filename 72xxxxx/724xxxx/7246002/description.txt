The musical styles of the sixties, those of Motown, Stax and Atlantic were soon to be eclipsed, replaced by the hard funk of The Fatback Band, Kool & The Gang, Brass Construction et al. In Britain especially, dance floors pulsated to the throbbing bass lines utilised by these and other like-minded bands. But for each action there is usually a reaction and it did not take too long for dance clubs to become discotheques and for the music to get watered down as much as the beer.
Whilst one half of the nation danced their way around handbags to the soul-influenced Bee Gees, the other half went off in search of salvation. It came in the unlikely shape of a musical hybrid, 'jazz-funk'. Jazz musicians had long been injecting their music with dance rhythms, producing songs that had previously been described as self-indulgant. Now, they were seen as trail-blazers.
What separated jazz-funk from soul was the lack of barriers; musical, colour or nationalistic. So alongside recognised American stalwarts like Donald Byrd, Herbie Hancock and Ramsey Lewis there were the Brecker brothers, Mike and Randy, who supplied the horn licks on just about every jazz-funk record of any note for near on ten years; Sadao Watanabe, proving the Japanese could swing with the best of them and from South America came Azymuth and Tania Maria, amongst others...
