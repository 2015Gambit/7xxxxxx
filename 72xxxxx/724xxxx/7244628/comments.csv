,violetflame,2012-05-07T01:43Z,Amazing film!
,kevlar1984,2012-05-07T06:39Z,"great great movie! a little focused on bashing the american right wing politics, but it captures and sums up the dire state of discussion in america.
I remember arguing on youtube about how kim kardashian's death would benefit america and the whole world, with very little resources spent. I feel like this movie was tailored especially for me (except the right bashing thing).
Also, there seem to be all these over 1GB downloads, I would not bother with those as this movie does not gave CGI, and I found the quality of this torrent more than satisfying."

,soulstash,2012-05-12T09:08Z,The subtitles are far from correct and pretty annoying.  Otherwise a really nice quality video.
,soulstash,2012-05-12T09:14Z,Let me say that again...    The most annoying subtitles ever are burned into the video.
,bktheman,2012-05-13T04:22Z,this cant be BDRIP eh?
