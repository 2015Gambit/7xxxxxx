,NateDeezy,2012-06-16T19:11Z,"Nevermind, I figured it out. Great torrent, guy."
,m4lvolio,2012-06-20T10:10Z,"For anyone else interested in how to turn on commentary: just select the second audio track for the episodes which have one.

Your player should have a menu for audio stuff somewhere.


Glad you enjoyed it."

How?"
,m4lvolio,2012-07-23T07:44Z,"The first step is always ""Stop using Windows Media Player"". Some excellent alternatives: POT player, GOM player, VLC."
