Terence Mckenna OmniBus 2012 Part 4 released - History Lesson

This is a watershed release, not only because of the standardization process we've undergone since the series began, but also because of Structured Silence, the awesome audio codec we're using to make your viewing experience memorable and a valuable addition to visual language. Structured Silence┬⌐ [www.structuredsilence.com] will show you sound in a way you've never seen it before. Big thanks to Ernie vega and his team for making it available to us, and also for the quick turnaround time for the processing.
Time to turn up the volume and get comfortable!

Peace
Schwann
