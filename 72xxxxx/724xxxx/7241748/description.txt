Music in the Digital Age, by Andrew Dubber:

"Music is both culture and commerce. Those two things are inextricably linked. Just as the changes brought by the Electric Age were profoundly disruptive to the musicians, businesses and fans of music when it first came along, so too are those brought by the Digital Age. My aim is to help you understand and adapt to those changes."
