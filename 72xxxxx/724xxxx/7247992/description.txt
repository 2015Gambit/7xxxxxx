The Ultimate Jesse Cook (2005)




Canadian rumba flamenco artist Jesse Cook has blended the exotic Spanish music form with elements of new age, jazz, and easy listening on his releases for Narada Records. Signed to the label in 1994, he produced his debut, Tempest, one year later. Gravity, released in 1996, hit the Top Ten on the new age charts. Two years following, Vertigo was released and Free Fall appeared in mid-2000. In 2003 Nomad came out, followed by the live album Montr√©al in 2004. Though it was started conceptually in 2005, Cook didn't issue his next studio album, Frontiers, which marked a return to his initial simpler production style, until 2007.
