,Cruelmalice,2012-05-25T14:42Z,"I am having trouble, I have extracted and installed, but I go to the crack, and it tells me that it cannot start because binkw32.dll was not found. Am I doing something wrong?"
,NeroTurbo,2012-05-27T14:57Z,"whenever you are having a .dll missing, go to google and search for it.
usually, in your case, writing ""binkw32.dll download"" will do.

from a quick search: http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?binkw32

generally, you are NOT suppose to get that error but i used to get it too, in other games.
this really is a quality upload :) "
,NeroTurbo,2012-05-27T15:00Z,"oh and paste the file to the directory where you installed the game to or to the ""bin"" folder inside the installation directory. that would usually work.

,iHustleu,2012-06-05T22:28Z,"I have a windows 7 64x bit Dell studio and am using winrar 64x bit to extract the file. I tell it to extract to desktop and it does so in multiple folder and files. your instructions say extract to folder so I know this isn't right, what am I doing wrong? Also, will Magic ISO work fine with mounting the iso?"
,iHustleu,2012-06-05T22:30Z,"Sorry for all the questions but I have one more. Where is the ISO? is it _setup.dll, ISSetup.dll, or is it one of the folders or what?"
,NeroTurbo,2012-06-07T08:49Z,"any program that can start a ISO is fine.
Daemon Tools is what i use.
im using a 64 bit too and it works fine,
you can extract where-ever you want.
out of the rar there is suppose to be the ISO.
WinRAR can read ISO's too, so you can open it and just start the install, but its less safe thought, problems may accure.
you might get confused between the .rar and the .iso since they both are capable of being opened by WinRAR, so unless you can't see what file is what (extensions like .exe, .png, .iso) it might get complicated."
,Joebell24,2012-06-09T16:34Z,"hi thanks for the download but i seem to have a problem. I installed the iso after mounting with daemon tools, then after the game installed i dragged the files from SKIDROW inside the iso into the program files (ubisoft>acb). i clicked on both executable files and they both bring up a blank screen. did i do something wrong or may it be because i do not meet system requirements? sorry im kinda new to PC game cracks"

,ADKBOSS,2012-06-11T23:03Z,someone please tell me how to get the serial number
,NeroTurbo,2012-06-13T18:22Z,"Joebell24
You need to place the crack at the install dir.
i don't think you installed it in program files :"
,srelie,2012-07-11T21:53Z,"I cannot find the skidrow folder you mention, I'm trying to find the crack.  I'm quite confused and frustrated lol"
