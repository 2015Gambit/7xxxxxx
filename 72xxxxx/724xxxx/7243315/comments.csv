,fengels,2012-05-05T21:12Z,"Some dickhead has seen fit to leave a transparent tag on this episode #DarkestBeforeDawn? What a bunch of wanders, now I have to download another clean copy. Why oh Why...."
,ferbfan68,2012-05-05T22:45Z,@fengels - That happens to be how it was broadcast. 
,candela20m,2012-05-06T15:38Z,great audio 5.1 thanks
,neywen,2012-05-06T22:45Z,"Many thanks to the duchebag who left the transparent tag on the video! That is sooo clever, and also, sooo useful... There is absolutely NO REASON to download a 1Go-video with high definition image and multi channels audio, to eventually get an I'm-gonna-screw-your-sight-for-the-whole-episode-transparent-tag. What a waste of time... "
,neywen,2012-05-08T00:47Z,"hmmm, so, am I the duchebag who did not understand that the hash tag came with the original tv stream? :):) oh well.... :) I still think that's stupid... :)"
