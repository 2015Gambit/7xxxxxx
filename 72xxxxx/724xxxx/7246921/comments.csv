,lepirate28,2012-05-20T11:13Z,is this a legit download? comment anyone -.-
,fightknightHERO,2012-05-28T17:58Z,"don't download this,this doesn't work 
(or just doesn't work on windows 7)"
,sergioreynel,2012-06-07T20:18Z,im downloading this right now to see if it works and on windows 7 you have to change compatibility to windows 95 or something
,sergioreynel,2012-06-08T15:46Z,does anyone know if this has videos/cutscenes?
,sergioreynel,2012-06-09T02:48Z,this doesent work lucky for me i only wanted the videos
,Merpet,2012-06-19T03:30Z,"This works just fine for me.  Using XP, didn't even have to use compatibility mode.  This is a no-install copy.  Just unzip and run. Already cracked so it won't look for a CD & patched with version update.
It doesn't seem to be missing anything."
,sergioreynel,2012-06-21T18:48Z,im also using xp and it just gave me an error
,streyg,2012-07-07T16:43Z,is this the full version with all the cutscenes?
