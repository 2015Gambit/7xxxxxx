Tindersticks return with The Something Rain, out February 21 via Constellation in North America, City Slang in Europe, and the band's own Lucky Dog imprint in the UK. The album was recorded and produced by bandleader Stuart A. Staples at his home studio. Opening track "Chocolate" is a sequel to their 1995 song "My Sister".
The Something Rain follows 2010's Falling Down a Mountain, as well as a collection of Claire Denis film scores the band released as a box set earlier this year.

Tindersticks recent history is a story of gradually rebuilding following a period, around 2003, of breaking it all down. It was a painful time, but it is only now that they feel those hard decisions were the right ones . Their music has grown into a different shape that could never have been found by holding on to the past. Since reforming they have been ever progressive, never looking back. This was felt most accutely on their recent soundtrack work for Claire Denis and the accompanying ambitious cinematic live shows, and culminating in the making of "The Something Rain".
They have gradually grown into a tight five piece band, utilising the riches of a great extended family of musicians.
There are the usual collaborators here - Terry Edwards (saxophone) and Andy Nice (cello, soprano sax) ΓÇô and on "The Something Rain" they are also joined by: Thomas Bloch (crystal bachet), Gina Foster (vocals) Julian Siegel (bass clarinet, tenor saxophone) and Will Wilde (chromatic harmonica).
