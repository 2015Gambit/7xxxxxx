Comment: NOT a duplicate of this honeypot torrent  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7207714/ . STAY AWAY OF TORRENTS WITH NO SEEDING AND NOT A SINGLE COMPLETE.

NOTA: The file is archived (packed for transport) in 7-Zip format to reduce data transfer and download time by ~1/3 with no loss of quality. The 7-Zip "unpacker" to restore the file to its original PDF format (and size) after download is available at  http://www.7-zip.org/download.html (Win & Mac; freeware).

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
