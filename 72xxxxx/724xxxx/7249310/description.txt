Jack's AmEx Unstaged

If you weren┬┤t aware at April 27 when streamed the live Jack White Gary Oldman
directed Webster Hall show for AMEX, now you can download it out in all its glory below. The show features two 40-minute odd sets which span WhiteΓÇÖs career - the first with his all female group The Peacocks, and the second with his all male group Los Buzzardos - including such highlights as a ΓÇÿNo Church in the WildΓÇÖ nod during ΓÇÿCut Like a BuffaloΓÇÖ (Jay-Z was reportedly in attendance), as well as weirdly charming clips of White hanging out with Oldman prior to the performance
