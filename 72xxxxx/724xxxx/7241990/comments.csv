,blackpeanut,2012-05-17T13:53Z,Keep having error 22: A critical error has occurred while initializing DirectDraw.
,area4689,2012-05-17T22:43Z,"it loads when i click, changes to black screen but stays there with a tiny white ""brick"" indicator on the top left corner. when i exit out, itll say access violation 0x000005 ~ something like that. why?"
,P0wn0nin,2012-05-22T23:56Z,"The first two comments seem fake, so I'm downloading it right now. We'll see how it goes."
,P0wn0nin,2012-05-23T01:03Z,"So I was having trouble with the setup, turns out when it's trying to select a drive to install the game on, it wasn't automatically selected on my C drive. Otherwise it works perfectly. "
,xhound40k,2012-05-24T15:11Z,"Had doubts... assumed comments were by the uploader... turns out it works great! Love it, kick in the nostalgicles....

One thing I'm confused with is that I could use 1024x800 resolution at one point, and now it won't let me. But that is probably just a Diablo 2 glitch. 

This works! Great quality!"
,Bloodyfunday,2012-05-25T04:02Z,Sorry if I sound like an idiot but how do i install this?
,trlolololollolha,2012-05-26T19:37Z,its in 10 parts or is my dl fucked up
,j3nnif3ra,2012-06-04T06:55Z,how can I make it work in battle.net?
,DACreech,2012-06-04T19:58Z,"This does indeed work if your computer is good enough to run it.  It worked great on my home system but was not playable on my lap top.
*You will need something like PowerISO or Daemon Tools..You can get either in PB.

Once you download torrent ..Extract files. 
 I always 'Extract here' unless instructed otherwise.

Next, click the Diablo Icon and it will tell you to insert disc in Drive D..or somewhere like that.  
When it tells you to insert the disc, Insert a blank DVD to write as a USB when prompted (to insert CD).  Once you write the game on the disc, re-insert the Disc and install.

Do Not Click any of the Russian options unless you know Russian.
This was an easy install.  Pointer...
Once you install, defrag your computer and restart or you might have problems running the game again."
,lcshunter,2012-06-16T12:54Z,does it need disk to play it?
