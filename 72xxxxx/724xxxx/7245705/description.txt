Somber, melancholic indie folk from a largely unknown English musician. "Dear..." is a very emotional album from the young Englishman Keaton Henson, hailing from London, the musician's intricate guitar and frail voice will capture your attention and your emotions.

Please support the artist in any way you can, and enjoy the album!
