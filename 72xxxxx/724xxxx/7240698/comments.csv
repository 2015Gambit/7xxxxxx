,Dimmis80,2012-05-04T19:20Z,"Hey bro Nepotu.I was waiting for this game.Very good upload dude.Lets see if Knicks can win Heat in their home coart..And Novak i think is a great first team choise.The best 3 point shooter in the NBA.They say that ""White Man Can't Jump"" but who cares if Novak shoots 3s like that.And to be honest i am with Heat but i enjoy good and lot 3 point shoots.So my very good friend Nepotu with your VIP scull(Respect)again and again congrats for this game and all of your work and for the Rippers hard work u guys keep up the awesome work and keep the games rolling.Cheers.:-)"
