The_Great_Paranormal_Clash_UK_2009(Billy Roberts v Ciaran OKeef)-Round_1+2of2.MQwebrip.xvid-enhanced avi

I converted this from youtube bits and enhanced the audio reducing the
echo and amplifying the speech
its a live presentation on stage with a  Psychic verse a Parapsychologist
in UK

the quality of the video sucks but its the only copy about.. I did what I could
with it. it obviously a web capture or stream capture as the video
looses sync in places and also its over compressed in places causing
pixels

why they didnt have over head mics on audience beats me.. I see yvette fielding produced it.. pretty scabby sound and video work if thats the case 

but its still worth a watch (alas Ive seen the card trick in it before doing the
rounds on the web emails in powerpoint and its a obvious one you will kick
yourself when see it)

you may inprove the video and sound using VLC and EQ preset to make
more treble in it and video sharpener can help

help to seed

enjoy
