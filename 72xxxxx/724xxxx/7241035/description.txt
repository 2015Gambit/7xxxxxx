This is a temporary workaround which allows you to play JA BIA with the current 1.13 SKIDROW patch. Install the 1.13 patch first, then place the directory from this torrent into your bin_win32 directory.

It should end up here :

JABIA  bin_win32  interface

*IMPORTANT* : When you hit "Start New Game" you will notice that the text for Tactical Mode (it is the second set of checkboxes), as well as the "Start" button, have been replaced with "Invalid Text". Tactical mode itself works, you just have to tick the second box on the bottom row.

This is due to a partially corrupted copy of the patch and will no doubt be fixed when SKIDROW release an official proper.

(The last torrent I uploaded included the wrong files. Sorry about that.)
