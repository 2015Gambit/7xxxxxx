,nine_dragons,2012-08-23T03:40Z,"Newb question... 
Two folders, one for English and one for Japanese, but the content in both seems identical outside the folder names. Is there something I'm missing?

Is the content the same? If so, why not include the files in one case and two folder names, and have Japanese or English users just copy the files to the correct folder before install?"
