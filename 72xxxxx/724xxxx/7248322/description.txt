What if there was a place beyond terror, beyond passion, where your obsessions come to life? Where your secrets walk the streets? Where the only law is desire? What would you do to get there? Past the edge of the world lies a city of the mind and of the flesh: Palimpsest
Let the music be your guide.

Palimpsest is the newest novel from Catherynne M. Valente, in stores 2/24/09. Quartered is its official companion album, and it will evolve and grow, a work in progress available via download only, as author and composer tour the United States together, across the season of Lent and beyond, from February 25 through summer 2009. Check back for new songs each week.

SONGWRITER'S NOTE JUNE 1ST 2009: "Lucia's song, 'Girl with the Lion's Tail,' is now available. Soon to come are 'The Train Suite II: Marginalia' and more. Keep checking back!"
