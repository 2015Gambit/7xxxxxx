,press2012,2012-05-07T17:01Z,Can this be made into a live cd and if so how? I currently have a couple of win xp live cds but I have come to find out they are lacking driver packs and will not boot from my win 7 machine.TIA

As I wrote it description, this is a clean version of a Windows XP Home Edition SP3, only with integrated AMD and Intel SATA drivers. That means it SHOULD run on your Windows 7 or Vista machine !

You just have to burn the image file (.iso) into CD/DVD as an image, boot it and install like any other Windows version."

,march078,2012-05-27T12:14Z,"Yes, this is English version, but I'm sure there's language packs out there for Windows XP. You just need to search."
