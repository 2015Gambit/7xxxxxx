
 Razor1911 GTA IV EFLC v1.1.2.0 crack / mod by CUE
 
 This package contains:
 
 data.dll       - 273,408 bytes - MD5: 10332d697a74fccc3a1dc0019f709cd1
 5 bytes NOP'd out @ 00003905 (E8 46 CB FF FF) changed to (90 90 90 90 90)
 
 LaunchEFLC.exe - 73,728  bytes - MD5: 727f2757d370688998230c5e1151ee03
 No changes were made to the launcher.
 
 Why ?
 
 This will prevent that Razor1911 startup music and splash screen logo
 from popping up everytime you launch the game.
 
 Instructions:
 Install the retail dvd version of the game..
 Install update version 1.1.2.0
 Copy data.dll & LaunchEFLC.exe to the install folder
 Done.
 
 Note:
 Always use LaunchEFLC.exe to run the game to prevent 'drunk camera'
 
 Extras:
 No-Intro-Logos-Patch-For-GTA-&-EFLC.rar
 Use this if you want the game to start up even faster ;)

 I advise using xLiveless instead of Microsoft's xLive  http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=388658&st=0
