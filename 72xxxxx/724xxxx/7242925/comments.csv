[V],catflap,2012-05-05T14:58Z,"although i'm not in the scene, 550MB
is the scene's standard size for this
type file/duration.

check last year's S1 uploads from the scene.
they are also 550MB for xvid c.1hr duration.

so i kept the same size as the scene did last year."

In this day and age, with the download speeds people have and the massive hard drives computers have, there's no reason to limit this to 500MB if it's going to look so crappy."
,wvyno,2012-05-06T05:39Z,"catflap, I suspect they compressed it differently or used a different format. The season one videos did not look this low resolution."
