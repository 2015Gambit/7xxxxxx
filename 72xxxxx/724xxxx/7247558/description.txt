Incredibad is the debut studio album of the American comedy troupe The Lonely Island, released on February 10, 2009, through Universal Republic Records.[2] Composed of writers and childhood best friends Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone, the album consists of hip hop-inspired comedy songs and skits with a satirical slant on traditional hip hop culture.
The album is largely composed of tracks composed by the troupe for broadcast on NBC's Saturday Night Live. Samberg was hired as a cast member, with Schaffer and Taccone as writers for the series in late 2005. After the quick production and national success of "Lazy Sunday", the comedians began writing and recording tracks for their debut album.
Collaborators on the album include T-Pain, Norah Jones, Jack Black, E-40, Julian Casablancas, Sly & Robbie, DJ Nu-Mark, J-Zone, Natalie Portman, Chris Parnell, and Justin Timberlake.[2] [FROM WIKIPEDIA]
