,ninth1der,2012-05-18T02:00Z,"I need help with the subtitles on your rips YIFY. 
System notes: Intel C2Q, ATi 6670, ALC 889a audio chipset. 
Using VLC 2.0.1 for playback under Win7.
If I turn off the subtitles they are gone, but in some movies there is foreign language with English subtitles during an English audio movie. Case in point: Mission Impossible Ghost.

Do you or any of your fans know how to turn the subtitle track to behave as it does on a BR/DVD? Using VLC of course.

Before any wise acres answer please read the entire message as I do, in fact know how to use the Video menu to turn off the subtitle track.

+1 on the rip as always"
