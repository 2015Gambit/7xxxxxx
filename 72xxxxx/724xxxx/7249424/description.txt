Alien Intervention
Intervention theory began in 1968 with the publication of Erich Von DanikenΓÇÖs Chariots of the Gods. Von Daniken focused on the wide array of megalithic structures around the world that so obviously are beyond modern capacities to match. Surely, he argued, only intervention by non-human, off-world entities could explain how such immense structures could be built to tolerances that todayΓÇÖs engineers can only marvel at. One favorite quote is that the Pyramids are ΓÇ£Rolex watches built on a scale of small mountains,ΓÇ¥ as are Baalbek in Lebanon, Tiahuanaco in Bolivia, and Sachsahuaman and Ollantaytambo in Peru, among dozens of monuments less cyclopean in size but no more likely to have been created by the minds and muscles of ordinary humans.

Lloyd Pye talks about the Intervention Theory of Origins, and his new eBook, " Intervention Theory Essentials" and also in this video :)

if anything its interesting watch even if you dont believe in any or all of it
but what puts me off is all the pushing to sell stuff and make money

if you wanted to get the info out there THE ONLY WAY IS FREE
and then ask for donations for a reason why onw needa the money
etc,, as supporters would if they believe in it..
but then it would be classed as another CULT - my own 2 cents PSSPSS

HELP TO SEED if grabbing

enjoy

ps- not sure if this was re-aired at 2012 congress as some say on googling
or not.. but the intro and quality clearing shows its a 1999 production
