Everyone's favorite obsessive-compulsive house-flipper is taking on a new role - as a therapist? ""Interior Therapy with Jeff Lewis"" follows Jeff and Jenni as they move into someone else's home and Jeff does what Jeff does best: redesign their space and judge their flaws. He'll observe the homeowners, diagnose their problems, and then take over their house for five days - with the goal of improving them inside and out. Of course he does this by using a combination of brutal honesty, impeccable design, and a few unique solutions that only Jeff Lewis could come up with, but he has his trusted assistant Jenni and his loyal housekeeper Zoila along for the ride to make sure he doesn't go too far over the line. This time, Jeff's not just redesigning a space; he's redesigning people's lives. (Source: Bravo)
