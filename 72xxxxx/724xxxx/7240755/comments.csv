Try the latest Version of VLC 2.0.1 OR MPC-HM with CCCP....

As nowadays Anime Mostly are coming in 10bit...so if you are having problems with playback update your video codecs or codec packs :)"

The download was quick and the subtitles are pretty good along with the HD quality so +1. Shame the special feature OVA ""A Chunin Exam of Flames! Naruto vs. Konohamaru"" wasn't included. Thanks for the upload though anyways."
