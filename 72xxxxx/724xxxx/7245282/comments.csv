These books are actually a good read for those who do not believe the propaganda of lobby-driven governments, and their media supporters. I'm not saying that you do have to believe what these books tell you but at least you'll have an account of these things from a different perspective."

Basically all of them have their own agendas to push what THEY want to believe on others....and rarely is any of it in line with reality.

Basically I believe what I actually see myself....and anything that filters through others I take with a healthy dose of salt."
