This is the unabridged version of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (third book).

It is not chapterized *technically* but it is broken up into 10 parts that are about an hour and 12 minutes each. The parts represent the 10 CD's that it was ripped from. 

There are no audio glitches, the quality is great and the reader is unchanged from the previous books. If you enjoy this series as much as I do, please, be courteous and seed.
