,darkizzle,2012-05-07T07:11Z,It was a nice episode. I just didn't care for Melisandre using her shadow monster to reanimate Renly's corpse and using it to convince his soldiers to side with Stannis. Even in the book I thought it was a bit unbelievable! But oh my god that last scene with Cersei discovering Shae and chopping her head off to force Tyrion to leave her children alone was exactly how I imagined it! Too bad Sansa is going to be traumatized now. But as long as her madness drives her to stabbing Joffrey in the season finale I dont care. Spiller people complained I didnt put any spiler tags so there!

somebody needs to die because they spoiled something for you. lol."
,357MAGNUM,2012-05-07T12:38Z,"@ aaBearaka

There are no missing scenes, it just seamlessly rewinds aprx 20 seconds, then replays the segment with continuity. Yes it's annoying, but it only happens 3 times. beside that, everything's good, great audio and video quality. 

To those wondering about the ""skipping"".. whilst watching a show on television, after a commercial they sometimes reloop the scene for half a minute; basically the same thing here but with bad timing xD"

Video quality sucks, as if it was not 1.5 GB but more like 1/3 of this size, and it rewinds 4 or 5 times, so even the subtitle is useless.

Downloaded this because of ""eztv"", which used to mean good quality - over, cannot trust them anymore... :("
