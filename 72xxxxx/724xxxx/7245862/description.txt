Listening to the likeable quintet Ellen and the Escapades, who describe themselves as ΓÇ£alternative folkΓÇ¥, a familiar dilemma presents itself. The particular discomfort of the folk community when one of its own breaks into wider public consciousness is nothing new: the Folk Police are a much more established enforcement agency than the Funk Wardens, or the Custodians of Crossover Thrash. No aspect of leftist culture is without its self-destructive splits and the sniping, the sneers and slurs of ΓÇ£selling outΓÇ¥ are as much a folk motif as any other casually-sketched stereotype of a music harder to classify than it is to parody cheaply. However, the rise of nu-folk as a chart force and its assimilation into mainstream culture has attracted much warranted scrutiny: when bands appropriate the aesthetics and commodify the sound (for what is now a massive mass-market export) itΓÇÖs bound to leave a bad taste. Talented lead singer Ellen Smith and her group have already been alluded to as a female-fronted Mumford & Sons, and itΓÇÖs an understandable tag.
