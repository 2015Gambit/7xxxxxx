I got tired of all the mislabeled Scrubs Seasons as "DVDRips" when they're just TVrips, so anyway here's: 

Scrubs Complete Series (Seasons 1 to 9)

S01.DVDRip.XviD-FoV
S02.DVDRip.XviD-FoV
S03.DVDRip.XviD-SAiNTS
S04.DVDRip.XviD-SAiNTS
S05.DVDRip.XviD-FoV
S06.DVDRip.XviD-WAT
S07.DVDRip.XviD-ORPHEUS (Even if files are outrageously labeled "Matt")
S08.DVDRip.XviD-REWARD
S09.DVDRip.XviD-REWARD

Extras only for Season 1 & 2 (sorry, that's all I could find)
