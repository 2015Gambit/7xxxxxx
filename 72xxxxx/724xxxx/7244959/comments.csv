I'm rewatching the whole series (which I downloaded from the torrent with the most seeds I think) and as much as I could stand the quality of the first three seasons, the fourth is so badly compressed I decided to look for DVD rips like 2 minutes into the first episode...

so great timing huh ? will DL and seed for a while !"

You're welcome dude!
Yeah, I couldn't believe all the Scrubs torrents here supposedly ""DVDRips"" so I decided to find and upload the real thing. It's a shame I was not able to find Extras for all the Seasons. If anyone knows where I can find them, tell me and I'll upload them here.

Please seed as much as you can!"

,castiboy,2012-06-03T20:43Z,"only big downside is I had to rename all files with episode names myself...

but quality's great so far!"
,BonkFever,2012-06-07T06:36Z,Holy hell this will never download for anybody ever with 26 seeders and 123 leechers. .... ahh screw it i'll leve my computer on for 2 weeks.
,AJ724,2012-06-22T00:28Z,PLZ SEED! im downloading at 3kb/s thats pathetic for a file of this size. of the 41 seeders im getting about 5. im uploading faster than i can download WTF!
,morriso4,2012-08-09T20:33Z,"Thanks for uploading this, but is anyone else experiencing glitches on some of the episodes?

I only needed select episodes, so I don't know if this is a problem throughout the whole series. Season 6, Episode 1 and Season 8, Episode 1 both start glitching roughly two-thirds through the episode for me. The video kind of looks like what happens when a DVD starts skipping and the sound just stops. I've tried opening them with different media programs and keep having the same problem.

Every other episode I've watched has been perfect though."

Yeah same problem here on the episodes you mentioned and some other ones too. most of them works perfectly fine tho"
,xtaz87,2012-08-15T13:25Z,edit: just took a quick look through my episodes again and its only 06x01 and 08x01 that are broken
