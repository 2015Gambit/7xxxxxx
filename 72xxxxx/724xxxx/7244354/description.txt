Release Notes:

This is one of my all time favorite programs.
I have found this to be the best disc checking tool I've used.
A good example is the 3 coasters i have on my desk right now,
no other so called verification programs detected any problems
but with CDCheck i found CRC errors. I've also used this tool
to recover data from damaged cd's when everything else failed.

Oh and this works perfectly fine with DVD's too
