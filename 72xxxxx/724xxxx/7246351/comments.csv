No it does not. I mean it will work. but F'N Cinavia."
,thatjessikahbitch,2012-05-14T02:57Z,you can watch cinavia coded files on ps3. But only if cinavia starts at least 15 minutes into movie. copy it to ps3 pause the movie when cinavia starts and back out of movie go to date & time settings. change the time to 2 to 3 hours ahead. save and continue watching movie. When it pops up again. repeat the setting change. Usually you only have to do it a couple of times for one movie..its annoying but if you really want to watch it on ps3 its worth it
