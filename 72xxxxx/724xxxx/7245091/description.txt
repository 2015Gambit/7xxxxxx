Just Download, use Virtual Clone Drive or any other mounting program you like for mounting the iso's, then just install Age Of Empire II when finished install Age Of Empire II Conquerors Expansion. When all the installations are finished, just run all patches in order. Copy the Crack's to the directory's where you install the game and the Expansion too.
