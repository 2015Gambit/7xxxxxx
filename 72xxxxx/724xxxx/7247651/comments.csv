,b1naryatr0phy,2012-07-09T12:45Z,"the x-force crak for this version is garbage (at least with ps cs5)

consistently crashes ps when the plugin window is closed.

tested and confirmed in both 32 & 64 bit versions of ps cs5. tested and confirmed in xp and win7, both 32 & 64 bit versions.

unfortunately it's the only crak available for 6.1, unless i'm not looking hard enough"
