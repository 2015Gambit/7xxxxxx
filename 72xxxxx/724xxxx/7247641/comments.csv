In the readme section it indicates that I should find it in ""Application_Name.app/Contents/Frameworks/"" but regretfully, my novice will not even allow me to find this file. Advice from one of you computer geniuses would be most helpful.  Thanks."
,lovevibez,2012-05-11T00:47Z,"First off Thank you ChingLiu for the great stuff you have done!  - I am with jrabbital, I am trying to put this on my g/f's mac (I'm not fluent with mac what so ever and neither is she O.o) So finding where I need to put the amtlib.framework is proving difficult for me. Any help would be great, appreciate it. Good day."

Once installed launch app and quit at least ONCE - block any outgoing connections.
Close application
Go to Finder>go>applications>adobe premiere pro
Look for the .app file and right click it
Click on show package contents
Double click on amt.lib framework
delete everything from this folder (resources-version-amtlib files)
go to the crack folder
open amt.lib framework
copy or drag resources versions and amtlib into the amt.lib framework folder to replace the files you deleted

All of the above will work for any Adobe files, just look for the .app file and right click it and follow all the above.
Remember if it does ask to connect to the web when you reconnect your connection deny connection (to any Adobe product).
Good luck!!"

,violet1143,2012-06-05T05:48Z,Will this work on the official Adobe installer on their website?
,violet1143,2012-06-05T07:02Z,Do we still have to patch the hosts file to keep Premiere from phoning home?
,soonganesh,2012-06-12T02:31Z,"There is missing presets and codecs. In my case, AVCHD is imported without sound, HDV files are very slow... I just can't use this version!
 I tryed to install same stuff on another system as a trial version with Adobe ID, and got automaticaly installed the missing stuff, everything work fine. So it means it's a new Adobe trick to avoid piracy... I am not the first one to discover it I guess, but if someone can find a way... ( I tryed to compare the content of my Premiere CS6 package installed on both machines but not able to find the difference... Not so easy I guess!"

Seems to be working fine!"
