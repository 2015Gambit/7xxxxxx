It seems to be working ok here.."
,oldiesguy,2012-05-06T20:19Z,"Hi Skep,

I used Medieval Cue Splitter, and the files are split
in the middle of each song.  

Anyone else have a problem?

O.G."

I've checked the tracks and they are complete and correct.

Thanks for the tip.

I downloaded the file again, and Cue Splitter did
the same thing. Must be a quirk somewhere. I
fixed the files in Adobe Audition, and they sound
fine.  This is a good cd - not all loud and 
compressed.

Their you go!

LOL
