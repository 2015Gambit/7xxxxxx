Since the creator of this mod did not upload this file to the Skyrim Nexus, I thought I would put it on here for all the people that did not have access to Steam Workshop, due to getting Skyrim from the Pirate Bay :)

Mod Description:


The highly anticipated Ultimate Castle Defense mod is here!

Instructions:

Wait for the courier to give you a note and follow the quest or just go directly to the boat in Northern Dawnstar. The boat will take you to an island that serves as the main playing area for this mod. If you have a follower, they will come and be upgraded with you.


Gameplay:

Defend your castle against waves of enemies. Upgrade your castle, hire soldiers, upgrade soldiers, gather resources, buy barricades, and upgrade your own weapons and armor.

You can fully customize the gameplay via a menu labeled '-UCD Configuration-' under Armor. You can customize the enemy type, change round settings (round total, max alive, increment, etc), change difficulty, add game modifiers, toggle dragon bosses, change the weather, and enable or disable the tower defense gamemode. In order to unlock most of the menu, you must beat the initial 5 rounds.

After completing the initial 5 rounds, you can receive a demo of my upcoming 'Sandbox' mod. This demo lets you place furniture and tamed creatures (that follow you upon activation). You get it by entering the castle in the basement of Leo's House.


Bugs:

Keep in mind that this is a beta, and there will be bugs. I will be updating this mod and adding new features all the time, so keep an eye out. If you wish to report a bug, please do so on the forums at http://www.zombiegamer.net/ucd.php or email me at cahard08@cardmail.louisville.edu.

Some known bugs include:
-Upgrading weapons and armor after buying back originals will cause certain weapons and armor to be removed from the player.
-You will be charged twice if you upgrade to the same thing twice.
-Balancing still needs some work. Mages are a bit overpowered.
-Your last used weapon doesn't get equipped on round start.
-Attackers may be a little slow noticing barricades.
-Some other stuff I'm forgetting.
