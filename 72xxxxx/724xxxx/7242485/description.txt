Euro 2012 is just around the corner and here is my updated collection of Polish and Ukrainian learning materials. All the files are organized in 8 main folders, so you can find what you want quickly and easily. Folder 00 contains the book list in jpeg files. This collection has pretty much everything you might need, from beginners courses to advanced grammar books, video courses and folk tales in Polish and Ukrainian. Enjoy your studies and remember to seed!
