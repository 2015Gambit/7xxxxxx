Be patient guys, this torrent is not fully seeded yet. Regenzy1 is reliable and a true racing fan.

Look under the Peers tab in your torrent client and you will see that the % is climbing regularly, proof that it's being seeded.

Don't be basterds and keep your torrent client opened after downloading so you may seed to at least a 1.00 ratio.

BTW choking (limiting) your upload speed DOES NOT make downloading faster, it just slows down downloading for everybody including you!"
