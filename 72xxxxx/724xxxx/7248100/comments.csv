,jumjumb,2012-05-08T22:18Z,"What a shit is this?
If you unpack the 7.rar-files, you get a folder with fucking 57 .rar-files. If you unpack again you get the game in a folder. But what the hell is this unzip-orgy for!? Cant you make one clean Zip-file instead!?
At last thanks for the game. Its working fine .....

,mycophage,2012-05-09T16:27Z,"For those who have not yet upgraded to Lion - the game is *not* working on my system - 

MacBook Pro 15.1, early 2011
OS 10.6.8
2.3 GHz Intel Core i7
4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3
AMD Radeon HD/Intel HD Graphics 3000

Based on others' success at running on 10.7, I'm going to assume that this is an issue with 10.6. I plan on upgrading my system later this week; I will try this game again after that and report back."
,Gekkieaap,2012-05-10T10:18Z,"Doesn't work, i get a freaking error!"
