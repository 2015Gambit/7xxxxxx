Thank you very much for this cool little torrent, xpmule; very much appreciated and keep up the good work."
,xpmule,2012-06-03T10:59Z,"right on glad i could help / share.

that window and sound would scare me half to death when i forgot about it.. lol
I'd have my stereo (plugged into pc) turned on loud for the game and your not expecting any sound yet and then BAM! chip tunes are blasted at you lol"
,xpmule,2012-06-06T08:51Z,"i've also released publicly a custom version of xLiveless (originaly by Listener)
my version has some extended logging and mainly the ability to specify your save game folder any where you want.

if you click on my user name it should be in my list of uploaded torrents
or posted available at www.gtaforums.com"
,sdgtuordihufizhtruizehugh,2012-07-19T10:27Z,"I'm getting messages in game when trying to save telling me saving failed and indeed it cannot save, what went wrong? (I also used your Xlive.dll v0.999.B7.24 that I placed in Syswow64)
is it due to xlive or the write permissions of the game exe?"
,sdgtuordihufizhtruizehugh,2012-07-19T11:23Z,"Dude, my bad.

I copied xlive.dll to the game folder edited the .cfg file saved it to desktop and sent it to the game folder, overwrited it.

Thanks for this excellent crack, I own the game, but I've passed to win8, It was the only thing that didn't work because now GFWL is replaced with xbox LIVE games and compatibility is broken.

I suppose they plan on having GFWL games be patched by xbox LIVE games but I laugh at the idea that they'd release THAT by 2013, good luck with that, Microsoft! (and mostly good luck to all the people that have to suffer for Microsoft's stupidity)"
,xpmule,2012-07-30T04:19Z,"please don't put any hacked xlive.dll in any folder other than your game folder.
You may see one in your windows directory but it should be a fallback if it is not found in the game folder. Know what i mean ?

Lastly i wish i named this torrent better lol
There is a never ending amount of torrentsfor the crack but i should have highlighted why mine is different.
And i bet most people don't like that Razor1911 splash screen & sound.
Since i have some moderate cracking skills i just thought one day well it can't be that hard to patch the rzr .dll
and it was easy you just patch out one conditional jump in asm and save the file :)"
