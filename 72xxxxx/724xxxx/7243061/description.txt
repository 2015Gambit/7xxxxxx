
 Razor1911 GTA IV v1.0.7.0 crack / mod by CUE
 
 This package contains:
 
 1911.dll        - 273,408 bytes - MD5: 4d82ddcf7c3a66007e5ce8cef09ea747
 5 bytes NOP'd out @ 00003905 (E8 46 CB FF FF) changed to (90 90 90 90 90)
 
 LaunchGTAIV.exe - 73,728  bytes - MD5: 3e9b3dc03cd5c2e658dd731b616fdcf1
 No changes were made to the launcher.
 
 Why ?
 
 This will prevent that Razor1911 startup music and splash screen logo
 from popping up everytime you launch the game.
 
 Instructions:
 Install the retail dvd version of the game..
 Install update version 1.0.7.0
 Copy 1911.dll & LaunchGTAIV.exe to the install folder
 Done.
 
 Note:
 Always use LaunchGTAIV.exe to run the game to prevent 'drunk camera'
 
 Extras:
 No-Intro-Logos-Patch-For-GTA-&-EFLC.rar
 Use this if you want the game to start up even faster ;)

 I advise using xLiveless instead of Microsoft's xLive  http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=388658&st=0
