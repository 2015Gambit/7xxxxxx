Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead 
Read an excerpt:

Her nightmare pulsed into me, shaking me out of my own dream, which had had something to do with a beach
and some hot guy rubbing suntan oil on me. Images--hers, not mine-- tumbled through my mind: fire and
blood, the smell of smoke, the twisted metal of a car. The pictures wrapped around me, suffocating me, until
some rational part of my brain reminded me that this wasn'tmy dream.
I woke up, strands of long, dark hair sticking to my forehead.
Lissa lay in her bed, thrashing and screaming. I bolted out ofmine, quickly crossing the few feet that separated
us.
"Liss, " I said, shaking her. "Liss, wake up. "
