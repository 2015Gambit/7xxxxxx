Weapons of mass destruction are the greatest threat to national security in the twenty-first century. Frank Barnaby, nuclear weapons and terrorism expert, describes in straightforward, non-sensational terms what is involved when a state or a terrorist group sets out to make a weapon of mass destruction - biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear. But How to Build a Nuclear Bomb is not a collection of scare stories- Barnaby explains what a weapon of mass destruction is, what it is capable of doing, and what is needed to produce one and argues that counter-terrorist measures urgently need to be stepped up to meet the challenges of a new era of international terror.
