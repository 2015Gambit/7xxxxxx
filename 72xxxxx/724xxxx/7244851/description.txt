Minor Disturbance was the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band The Teen Idles. It was released in December 1980 through Dischord Records (No. 1). Comprising eight songs, Minor Disturbance referenced a number of issues pertinent to the band, from being turned away at local concerts due to their age ("Too Young to Rock") to what they felt was the increasing complacency of many first wave punk bands ("Fleeting Fury"). Upon its release, Minor Disturbance, Dischord Records' first release, received positive reviews from local fanzines and gained airplay on local radio stations.
