,KuzcoIOY,2012-05-08T15:58Z,Seeding!
,mycophage,2012-05-09T18:59Z,Doesn't appear to be cracked... Am I missing something obvious?
,WinterGale,2012-05-10T04:10Z,"@mycophage After copying The Vampyre Story folder to desired destination, open A Vampyre Story - Crack.dmg (It'll give a problem with the disk image error but just click on open nonetheless). Open A Vampyre Story UBCrack and it will ask for the admin password and then just follow the onscreen instructions."
,ctav,2012-05-11T10:29Z,"Hi! Just finished downloading...everything was smooth until I tried copying Vampyre Story into my desired location. It said ""The default location required for this install could not be found"" and it cancelled it. Please let me know what to do next! Can't wait to play!"
,ctav,2012-05-11T10:57Z,Figured it out! Now I need to register with a Product Code?
,WinterGale,2012-05-13T05:25Z,@ctav Nope...no need
,luckyem_85,2012-05-14T16:35Z,"Please could you explain how the crack file works? Installed A Vampyre Story to desired location, opened the file A.Vampyre.Story.UBCrack, typed my admin password then unsure where to go from here. Really want to get this installed - thanks  "
,WinterGale,2012-05-14T20:05Z,"@luckyem_85 Try copying the crack file to the app folder. Run the crack (you may have to input your password twice). Then a window will open and you have to navigate to the app folder, then click on open.

Hope this helps."
,ctav,2012-05-15T08:26Z,"got it! thanks! great game so far, can't wait for the 2nd"
,ctav,2012-05-15T08:27Z,"few glitches though..the esc and space bar stopped working sometime and I couldn't save, anyone else have these problems?"
