,packetdog,2012-05-07T17:13Z,"Sorry dear, this is the real deal. :)"
,puunjab,2012-05-08T19:21Z,"I'll believe it's the full version when others start confirming.

Packetdog confirmed before it could have downloaded."
,mac04770,2012-05-09T12:06Z,"4 days later and still @ 30% with 125 seeds.
Something isnt ringing right here.
I still say that this is crap.
Anyone else care to comment and make me look like i am talking nonsense."
,deadpress,2012-05-10T11:13Z,"Was able to download quickly, however using FCPX, I was only able to get Split Screen to work.
I did a little digging around and found the permissions for the remaining plug-ins were only accessible by ""_unkown"" and staff, omitting FCPX from accessing 'em under the main user.
I had to add myself, set my user as the primary, and for safe keeping removed _unknown to get them to function.
Now they work perfectly."
,mac04770,2012-05-10T13:52Z,"Thanks for this ""deadpress"" i will have a look and see if i can now get them to work for me. Cheers."
,deadpress,2012-05-10T17:10Z,"No prob.
And it may be that others like myself only needed 1/3 of the plugins:
TransiMatic
Platinotype
ToneGrade
ShrinkRay X
SplitScreen X
Finisher
Noir Moderne
Lumineux

As these are the only ones compatible with FCPX.
Or whatever.
Anyhow, many thanks to CrumplePop and the uploader.
Not sure if I'll ever use any of these, but it's nice to have the right tool in the box should the need arise."
,GDLookinMingeR,2012-05-22T17:10Z,Epic download thanks to the Uploader can confirm all FCP X working 
,spink888,2012-09-03T14:38Z,"hi, I can't get Transimatic to install after opening the dmg image. Can anyone gives a more detailed way on how to get them running?

So far tried, SplitScreen X, Platinotype and Noir Moderne all working fine.

Thanks in advance."
