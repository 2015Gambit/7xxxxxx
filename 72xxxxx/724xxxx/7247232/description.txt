Whether you're self-employed, a middle manager, or a Fortune 500 executive, it's easy to get stuck in a humdrum life and only fantasize about "what could have been."

Motivational speaker Steve Chandler helps you turn that way of thinking into "what will be." Reinventing Yourself is filled with techniques for breaking down negative barriers and letting go of pessimistic thoughts that prevent you from fulfillingΓÇöor even allowing yourself to conceive ofΓÇöyour goals and dreams.

Within each of us is an inspirationΓÇöa spark of insight about the person we were meant to be. Reinventing Yourself helps us to name that vision . . . to call it ours and to begin to make it come true. We really can become the people we've always wanted to be. Steve Chandler tells us how.
