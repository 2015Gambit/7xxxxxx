However the small puns / bits of text that appear in pink are almost completely NOT translated with one or two exceptions, so if it's your first time watching the series it will often leave you confused. (Not sure if this is the case with all dubs by default or just this one)

Regardless the quality is VERY nice. It has become surprisingly hard to find a dub of this with such good quality. You have my vote."
