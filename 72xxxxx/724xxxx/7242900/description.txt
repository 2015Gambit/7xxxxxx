Nature Documentary hosted by Colin Scot, published by Discovery Channel in 1998 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Serengeti Symphony is a breathtaking look at the astounding landscape and exotic animals that make up the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. It begins and ends with a brief narration but the power of this compassionate portrait lies in a deceptively simple combination of images and music.
The film accounts the daily lives and intricacies of animals such as giraffe, flamingos, leopards and cheetahs, each vivid scene flawlessly paired with a musical score written by Laurens van Rooyen. Van Lawick's immense dedication to the preservation of the Serengeti, combined with his decades of experience studying and filming wildlife, creates the most intimate portrait of natural animal life. Serengeti Symphony brings the beauty of Africa to life like never before, with close up colourful images of the terrain and unimaginable glimpses of the wildlife, allowing the true character of the landscape, and the grace and spirit of every animal, to shine through.

DVD Extras: Bonus film: 'The Waiting Game' (23 mins) - behind the scenes with Hugo and his team, includes some incredible footage of a crocodile snatching a gazelle

In this documentary we observe cameraman Matthew Aeberhard, former pupil of Hugo van Lawick, as he sets out to film a crocodile kill. This task is a hard one - it can last for days or even weeks before any real action occurs. His patience is put to a test.
