(has a skull next to name). Aploigies to Roadeo if this is not fake/virus, but why upload something whne there are already many torrent of Skyrim available."
,Arbiter89,2012-05-04T23:05Z,Why does this exist? Why would anyone want to download this? I am confused.
,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-05-05T10:17Z,"I have no idea why people upload things when there are already multiple copies with many seeds. Just search for Skyrim in the search bar. Arrange list by number of seeds, highest to lowest. Then download the 1 with highest seeds. This is normally best, but sometimes virus/fakes can go to top of the list of seeds. Always best to get from Green/Pink/Blue Skull people. If the uploadr doesnt have a skull, just make sure he atleast has other uploads and not just the 1. Also if there are many comments the file should be ok. 

So to answer your question, why dos it exist.. not sure. Either a virus/fake or it is legit. But why download it when there are trusted sources with many seeders on that torrent already. No1 should want to download this."
