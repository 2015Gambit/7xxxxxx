,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-01T04:29Z,"This album sucks. Nothing new. Even the music accompanying the lyrics is bland. They rushed it or it was made for teeny boppers who pretend they have feelings. At first I could related but wow, its the same old. Cry baby songs with a chock load of sensitivities. Keane need to become MEN. Stop the whining crying songs. This album made me sick. Sorry! JUST SICK. I am definitely not buying this one. NEXT!"
