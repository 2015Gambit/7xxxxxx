,denys55,2012-05-08T01:45Z,I read it and I'd give it a six out of ten. Maybe in China this would be shocking but it was no big deal for me. One thing I disliked about the novel was the overconfidence in the Chinese economy. China has some major economic issues to overcome. Not the least of which is that they will become a society with a high percentage of elderly before they become a developed country.
