The Fat Years by Chan Koonchung
Narrated by David Tse

Banned in China, this controversial and politically charged novel tells the story of the search for an entire month erased from official Chinese history.
 
Beijing, sometime in the near future: a month has gone missing from official records. No one has any memory of it, and no one could care lessΓÇöexcept for a small circle of friends, who will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of the sinister cheerfulness and amnesia that have possessed the Chinese nation. When they kidnap a high-ranking official and force him to reveal all, what they learnΓÇönot only about their leaders, but also about their own peopleΓÇöstuns them to the core. It is a message that will astound the world.

A kind of Brave New World reflecting the China of our times, The Fat Years is a complex novel of ideas that reveals all too chillingly the machinations of the postmodern totalitarian state, and sets in sharp relief the importance of remembering the past to protect the future.
