,megate,2012-05-05T19:18Z,why should we use a codec that cant be played on dvd tv or game systems
,megate,2012-05-05T19:19Z,also why use a hd codec for sd video
,Moonie45,2012-05-05T19:28Z,Man everyone should be thankful there atleast getting it and your watching there's alot of people in the world  that can't watch it.
,HelloMynameisV,2012-05-05T19:33Z,CP is the Best! :D 
,megate,2012-05-05T19:39Z,"cause i am the one that does the encode 
and some of the scene groups have changed to x264 but just cause they have does not mean everyone will plus i dont have the hardware and software to do x264 encoding as that is an hd codec

@Moonie45 i agree with that but some people are just to picky

@HelloMynameisV ty"
,dm_punks,2012-05-05T20:45Z,"Thanks, {C_P}! Don't ever change!"
,tantonj,2012-05-05T22:29Z,"another epic fail, no one likes this shit quality stop failing, if you don't have the hardware GET IT!"
,tantonj,2012-05-05T22:31Z,"oh ya and ""you don't have the software"" is the stupidest thing anyone could ever write on a TORRENT SITE, FUCKING DOWNLOAD IT!!! AHAHAHHA"
,tantonj,2012-05-05T22:34Z,"and this is worse then just bad resolution, its cropped out and you miss most of the picture.  despo1ler uploads great versions, but his always come a day late. and it makes a HUGE difference, even if the show is in SD any fool with a good screen can see this, especially if your watching it on a 42 inch screen"
,xantheus13,2012-05-05T23:36Z,"well tantonj, if it's as easy as you say it is why don't YOU get all the necessary hardware and software and show us how it's done....NO?? Then STFU and be greatful to those that take the time to give you these files for free...got nothing better to do than troll torrents you don't like i guess that's really sad..."
,halfday28,2012-05-05T23:50Z,@ megate.  Why do you crop the screen?
,NMatuzic,2012-05-06T01:58Z,"Yes, I too would like to know why there is screen cropping always done?

I don't care as much about the format, but I'm sick of the alterations being made."
,tran001,2012-05-06T04:29Z,ty c_p!
,megate,2012-05-06T06:00Z,"all i crop off is black bars on the top and bottom of the screen

heres a thumbnails of the original cap file from when i record it http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg850/scaled.php?server=850&filename=cable4201205051030tsthu.jpg&res=landing"
,ceegronlee,2012-05-06T06:30Z,love CP. as the only people who bring us the show day-of at all I don't see where all the complaints come from.
,templefugate,2012-05-06T06:46Z,"@tantonj; when someone is doing you a FREE favor, it's generally good manners to be thankful. I could see one making a polite suggestion. But you're an azzhole so that's to much to expect. If one of these hackers tracks you down and F's up your world...I'll be the 1st buy the beer!
@megate; keep up the good work and don't let the azzholes get you down."
,slybunda,2012-05-06T09:58Z,this is such a good series that im not gonna bother to download this shit quality and just wait for a proper high def one.
,TheRealAngelMike,2012-05-06T13:14Z,"I have to say if this show wasnt on tv in HD and it was years old like Batman or something i would have no problem with it, but i know and a lot of others know this one is on better, and some whine about that cus they dont have the patient to wait for it.

o and i am one of those people who cant watch it on tv, but i rather wait till the HD version is out, or at least a better one..."
,naga111,2012-05-06T19:10Z,Thanks a lot! :D
,greylion,2012-05-06T21:56Z,"The reason to use x264: Smaller files, or way better quality for the same filesize, or somewhere in between.
A lot of us watch this on our PC, not on a tv or console game system.
x264 is not a HD-only codec, and you don't need special hardware to encode something in it, once you have the raw tv-rip in a file.
http://www.videohelp.com/tools/x264-Encoder"
,megate,2012-05-06T23:51Z,"why is everyone want int everything in x264 now just cause onre group does it like that does not mean every HAS to like you say they do 

@greylion that program you linked not a good one cause it a command line you cant see the vid so how do you edit commercials how you know how much to crop 

@slybunda ya you say it shit yet we have over 1800 seeds right now seems to be good enough

@TheRealAngelMike  i know it not hd and anything i do is not hd cause i dont get the hd channels i only get the sd channels yet everyone seems to think that hd is available to every person but for me to get hd it would cost me more money each month on the cable bill

and again heres is why i have to crop it thumbnails of the original cap file from when i record it http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg850/scaled.php?server=850&filename=cable4201205051030tsthu.jpg&res=landing"
,tantonj,2012-05-07T02:17Z,"templefugate: I actually am very thankful to people who do me favours, Just this isn't a favour, nor did I download it, and I do have the patients to wait, and thats what i did wait, and now I am downloading a good version from http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7247942/Young.Justice.S02E02.Earthlings.720p.WEB-DL.AVC.AAC-Reaperza I just don't respect this encoder is all, they clearly are not that intelligent"
,Kazu-kun,2012-05-07T02:36Z,"Ok, we like the feel back if you don't like C_P's releases then don't download them. We are not forcing anyone to do so.

x264 does need a more powerful CPU to encode with, same thing can be said about the GPU too(nvidia cuda). 

Now the HD channels where most of the encoders live costs an arm and leg. For me its 30$ more each month just to get the HD standard channels + a fee of 15$ for the box.

In the end its all about MONEY and seeing how your not paying for it, don't talk down to us.

If we want to encode in xvid that up to us not you.

So in the end if you don't like are releases don't download them. If you have never released anything before, Put up or Shut up."
,pwnt_soup,2012-05-07T04:56Z,"CP you guys rock, i grab your stuff and watch it on my PC, if some jerkwads wanna bash because your not putting out good nuff free stuff for them, well they can go find what they want somewhere else and STFU, i'll keep grabbin your stuff here and sayin thanks for it, keep doing what you do!!!"
,mysterio4,2012-05-07T05:20Z,keep up the gud work dudes
,mysterio4,2012-05-07T05:23Z,@pwnt_soup i agree totally
,rickruin,2012-05-07T05:42Z,"megate are you an idiot or do you actually have no clue about h264 and and the open source x264 and the profiles they have. ALL MODERN CONSOLES PLAY H264. Xbox, PSP, Playstation 3, Playsation Vita ALL PLAYED H264/x264 video since the day of their release. To say they don't play it shows you are straight up a stupid sack of lying shit. Handbrake even has a setting to make sure the h264 profile you pick encodes for playback for consoles, mobile devices, itunes, yadda yadda. What you meant to say you daft idiot i'm guessing is that the MATROSKA .MKV FILE CONTAINER CANT BE PLAYED ON CONSOLES.

AVI and MP4 and m4v and MOV VIDEO CONTAINERS That use h264 or the open source x264 implementation can play just fine on ps3 or xbox 360 or psp or psp vita.

PLEASE YOU LYING SACK OF SHIT EVER TRY TO SAY YOU UNDERSTAND A DAMN THING ABOUT VIDEO ENCODING TECHNOLOGIES EVER AGAIN!

Also if you watch these videos on your god damn computer you should know that H264 is the only video codec that has built into the intel, amd, nivdia GPU and CPU optimized decoding. The GPU on the PS3 is also optimized to decode h246 video is well and any video card sold in the last 5 years from both nividia and amd has a built in DECODER CHIP to help process h246 and encode it too!

AGAIN STOP LYING, STOP TRYING TO PRETEND YOU KNOW ANYTHING. RECORD AND HD FEED OF THE SHOW AND RELEASE IT AS a h264 video with AAC audio in an mp4 container if you want to play it on a console.

You and your fucking idiot release team can fucking easily find an HD source if any of your people have Dish Network or Direct TV and can find an HD capture device from a myth TV Cable card setup or even using a mac using A component black magic design HD capture card. 

SO PLEASE STOP TRYING TO PASS OUT FUD AND LEARN ABOUT VIDEO ENCODING TECHNOLOGY BEFORE YOU PASS OUT FUCKING BULLSHIT!"
,pwnt_soup,2012-05-07T06:17Z,"how about all you know it all sob's go and post your own stuff, i for one am grateful for their effort. if you can do better than do it and show all how great and wonderful you really are, otherwise STFU!"
,Kazu-kun,2012-05-07T14:45Z,"@rickruin so are you going to be paying for all this?? umm i'm betting that a big no.
the MATROSKA .MKV FILE CONTAINER CANT BE PLAYED ON CONSOLES. < that is true

Dish Network or Direct TV... Notes of how they do business good service, have to give them bank account information, signs you up for shit you never ask for, and gives out information to other business. My mom and myself have had to close are bank accounts and open new one do to there fail.

And this all comes down to MONEY MONEY MONEY MONEY MONEY... Your not paying for it so why cry about it. hdtv releases young justice too go download theirs and quit crying."
,greylion,2012-05-07T16:59Z,"megate: Did you overlook the links to the front-ends(GUIs) / converters that use the x264 encoder?
""and is used in several converters like Handbrake, Xvid4PSP, StaxRip, RipBot264, FairUse Wizard, MEGUI.""
Even VLC can encode something to x264.
Anyway, try comparing the filesize and quality of this rip: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7248499/Young.Justice.S02E02.WEB-DL.480p.H264
with your own."
,rickruin,2012-05-07T18:58Z,"@Kazu-kun because you little Weeaboo shit if you are gonna do anything in life do it to the best of your ability. Its like you and the Cartoon palace ilk are a bunch of neck beard basement dwellers who will say Oh Ogg vorbis the best because its yadda yadda or oh this is so hard its expensive so so expensive. 

WELL YOU ACTIVELY REQUEST MEMBERS TO GET ACCESS TO IT THEN OF YOUR DAMN TEAM. ITS NOT HARD. Dish network which has Cartoon network in HD is only 50 dollars a month and you get the HD free box for two rooms now. So all you need is an hd capture card which is 120 bucks. Yeah thats a lot of money to a 12 year old like your self but its called birthday money and a professional skill device you learn to put on your 12 year

Well let me ask you if you are getting EXTENDED CABLE which cartoon network is on YOU ALREADY  GAVE OUT YOUR FUCKING Information to a company like Comcast, Verizon, SBC, AT&T, Cablevision, Rogers, or RCA if you live in the north american area for the USA or Canada. Because this isn't YTV which is terrestrial broadcast in canada, and Cartoon network isn't a terrestrial broadcast in europe either so ... what excuse of BS are you gonna sell me now little boy blue balls"
,megate,2012-05-07T21:37Z,"ya the thing is im the encoder and i have comcast cable and if i wanted the hd channels it would cost me an extra $50 dollars a month for the hd package and equipment and we activily are asking members cause right now we only have one encoder that does everything so shut the hell up 

@rickruin i see you dont have any uploads here so if you dont do the work dont criticize others for there work

@rickruin dont let me catch you in the irc or else"
,Gazman76,2012-05-08T07:34Z,"{C_P} - you are my hero, who ever you are, I love all your work and trust you.  I love every show you upload and hope to one day do the same for others - you are an inspiration! Do not ever stop!"

thanks again..

take care"
[T],despo1ler,2012-05-08T20:04Z,"I would also like to add a reply to rickruin.
 I have a PS3 myself and yeah, they may play h264 mp4 but I have to transfer the file to the PS3 HDD to play it which is something that is impossible with the number of videos in my library, I play all my downloaded video off my PC hard drive through TVersity media server or Windows media player sharing server and neither of them will play h264 in any format and allow me to fastforward or rewind or scene search like I can with every single xvid I've ever watched through the set up. When I play an H264 video and try to FF or RWD it just freezes up, same with scene search. I do not want to have to go through the effort of transfering each file to the PS3 every time I watch want to watch it and then deleting it to make room for the next file. Because of the difficulty I have always had with h254, Tversity wouldn't even stream mkvs at all until sometime last year when it was updated, I avoid them myself and stick with what works. So pls do not preach about something you clearly have no actual experience with yourself. 
 As for other consoles etc, the xbox has no support for h264, it cannot play mkvs and they cannot be streamed to it, anyone who wants to watch a video on an xbox needs an Xvid copy, I see that you don't even mention the xbox yourself so clearly you must have known this but you say nothing about it because it supports everything we are saying.
 My strongest arguement however is the opportunity I gave our audience to choose between both xvid and h264 versions,both SD, of the last few generator rex episodes which were leaked before they air on TV. I released both versions of each episode at the same time and on every release it was the XVID which got a minimum of 4 to 5 times as many downloads as the h264. Both files were similar in size, the resolution was the same, just the codecs varied and our audience made it clear that they prefer tthe XVID versions every time we gave them the choice. You mention the mSD h264 rip offs of just about every HD release that is made but you neglect to mention that despite the numerous complaints from haters like yourself it is our Xvid releases that are far more popular than those mSD h264 encodes and it our encodes which get far more downloads than the h264 alternative. "
[T],despo1ler,2012-05-08T20:06Z,"I've said it before and I will say it again...
 OUR AUDIENCE HAS MADE THEIR PREFERENCE CLEAR AND IT IS XVID, YOU HAVE BEEN OUTVOTED SO STFU AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
(I can use caps too...)

I will asos add this, you preach a good sermon but you offer nothing but empty words and you show your own ignorance of just what is involved when recording a TV show and converting it for upload to share. When you start releasing your own encodes you have a right to preach but you have no uploads t, to use the traditional saying, ""Put up or Shut up!""  If and when you ever try encoding I would like to hear from you just what software can be used to encode h264 AND give the editing control that virtualdub gives. I use megui myself for some transcoding but when I record from TV there are commercials to be edited out and there is no way that I have yet found to edit a section of the recording out with megui or any other h264 capeable media convertor that I have ever tried whereas it is a simple matter to cut out sections with virtualdub so I have no choice but use Vdub with avisynth when there are adverts to be edited out. to then re-process the resulting file I get from vdub to h264 would be pointless and just degrade video quality further.
  Speaking of degrading video quality, We included screenshots of the .TS file, which is the output from the capture equipment used to record the TV shows with all our releases this week but due to limitations on the size of text allowed on this site now it could not be included, if you check my post of this upload on either sites you will see those thumbnails from the TS and you can see for yourself that when part of the screen is cropped off by our encoders it is because that part of the screen is EMPTY BLACK SPACE. What possible arguement could you offer for including empty screen in the encode when by cropping it the limited bitrate can all be used on the actual picture instead of being used to encode empty screen. Why do you want us to include empty screen? to do so would reduce the overall quality of the of the encoding. By cropping off that empty screen the processing power that would have been wasted icluding those 2 black bars in every single frame of the encode can be dedicated to processing the actual image. What possible reason can you give for including areas of empty screen when it reduces the overall quality? I certainly can't think of any."
[T],despo1ler,2012-05-08T20:07Z,"My final comment is this.
 To everyone who wants us to improve the quality of our encoding, Donate the money for the hardware and cable TV rental to our RG and we will happily oblige or buy the equipment yourself and join our Group and we will happily release your work for you, until that happens just be grateful for what we are able to provide or go somewhere else, we aint exactly forcing our work down anyone's throats are we? 
I hope this is the last of this BS I will see, we have now shown that any cropping we do does not remove any of the actual picture, ONLY empty black screen, We have also made it clear that in response to the choices made by the huge majority of our audience we will continue to use Xvid.
 Anyone who continues with this pontless arguement is therefore doing so purely out of malice or sheer ignorance, as the saying goes, ""You are flogging a dead horse.""
  Just take a look at the number of seeders above and then go check how many people are seeding the mSD h264 or the 720p h264 that I uploaded of this same episode and then try and tell me again that Xvid is not in more demand than h264...."
,DannyPhantom,2012-05-24T18:30Z,"Quality don't ideal: i mean that record was maked from antenna network,because on picture have some small sharpen.

Dear CP,please in next time delete black bar from video frame,because on my CRT tv uncomfortable watching this video.

And more please say: when release new episodes?"
,DannyPhantom,2012-05-24T19:17Z,"You can upload next videos in quality 700*240 pixels,becuse watched movie in correct quality not good for me.
