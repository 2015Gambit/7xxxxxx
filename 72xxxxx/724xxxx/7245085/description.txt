Awesome I Fuckin' Shot That! (alternate title: Awesome I... Shot That!) is a 2006 concert film of the Beastie Boys.
It was created by giving camcorders to 50 audience members of a sold out concert at Madison Square Garden on October 9, 2004. The audience members were instructed to keep the cameras rolling at all times.
For a low budget operation, all cameras were returned to the place of purchase for a refund.
