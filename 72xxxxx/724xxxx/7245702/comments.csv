,jmanner,2012-07-06T01:08Z,"A few points. ""63 - Graph Theory"" is the same as ""184 - Modern Graph Theory. It's fine since 184 is an updated edition of 63 anyway.

121 is supposed to be a revised edition of both 59 and 69 together in one book (Cyclotomic fields I and II) but instead is a copy of 59

123 is in German.

Otherwise all that's missing are books 26 and 263 making this an outstanding download. Thanks very much!"
