i dont see how 1 single person cant jus aside the drama for 1 single night and be grateful...everyone else did"
,GeneralKlinger,2012-05-08T04:38Z,"The US HBO show from 3 nights ago was the full show including the GNR performance. This must have been recorded outside of the US i.e in Canada or something.

Why don't you people do some simple googling before running off at the mouth about stuff you obviously have no idea what you're talking about"
