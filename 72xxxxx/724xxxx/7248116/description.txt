From the arrival of Columbus through the historic election of Barack Obama and beyond, Davis carries readers on a rollicking ride through more than five hundred years of American history.

Here, celebrating the twentieth anniversary of its debut as a New York Times bestseller, is the revised, updated, and expanded edition of the classic anti-textbook that changed the way we look at history. 

 First published two decades ago, when the "closing of the American mind" was in the headlines, Don't Know Much About┬« History proved Americans don't hate historyΓÇöjust the dull version that was dished out in school. With wit and irreverence, in question-and-answer form, Don't Know Much About┬« History took readers on a rollicking ride through more than five hundred years of American history, from Columbus's voyages to recent events. The book became an instant classic and has sold more than 1.6 million copies.
