Ugh, muxed a couple minutes too early and 
missed the last few minutes of video. :(

"Voodoo Undo"

Xavier Obispo (guest star Serrano), a mob 
boss in Miami, asks Walter to find a 
voodoo doll he is convinced was created to 
be used against him. Willa and Walter, a 
non-believer in witchcraft, visit a witch 
who is annoyed by the fact that Walter 
does not take her art seriously, but 
decides to help them find the person that 
could have created the doll, leading them 
to a surprising participant in the mob 
boss' situation. Meanwhile, Isabel and 
Miami Det. Curtis Gillespie (guest star 
Chris Tardio) risk their lives while 
investigating a gang fight at a funeral 
linked to Xavier.
