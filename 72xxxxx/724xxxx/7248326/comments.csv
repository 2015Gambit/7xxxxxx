It ain't on Demonoid (yet), most recent there is E5. link the torrents or stop saying it is.  

This looks to be a raw streamgrab from digital cable, hence the mpeg2 and huge size.  

Looking forward to a 720 version in a modern codec, but this will do for now.  I'll re-encode it myself if no 720 version pops up within a day."

1. don't have a TV atm
2. when i did have one, couldn't wait until it was aired in mycountry
3. even if it did air in my country sooner, I'd prefer having a downloaded episode that I can pause and go back easily with VLC.

So yeah I think they wouldn't need to be so worried about piracy if they did release their episodes on something like itunes for about ÂŁ1, 1.20â&#x201A;Ź or 1$60"
