,nastehn8te,2012-04-30T08:40Z,"Idk what ""other"" you are referring to, this is the only one on this site. The installer in this torrent is the same as the one you get when you purchase the game, straight from Microsoft. "

,Addest,2012-04-30T18:47Z,"Made an offline GFWL account.
Cracked Properly (Experienced at doing so)
Used ""Game.exe"" from the original folder
Requires a cd key from GFWL

I would try and find another download until Skidrow (Or the uploader) can crack this game properly."
,Addest,2012-04-30T18:56Z,"My comments are getting deleted by the uploader.

This upload DOES NOT WORK.

Made an offline GFWL account
Installed and cracked the game properly (experienced at doing so)
Logged into said account and it requires a cd key

This upload comes with a ""Skidrow.dll"" file which skidrow NEVER includes on their official releases.

Wait for another upload."

,lmaluko,2012-04-30T21:10Z,"To people getting the message for the missing MSVCP100.dll if u r running windows 64 bits u have to also install the c visuals for X86, even if u have the x64 version intalled too, this is a Microsoft fuck up. U will have to instal games for windows live too if dont have it yet."

,Piyakapya,2012-05-01T02:09Z,"Game works, not sure what the hell other people are complaining about.
Only gripe I have is that on the main menu and in-game, the ground's textures seem to really flip out. They're usually a solid green, but it'll alternate really fast sometimes and even show off what the texture is supposed to really look like for a split second. Not sure if it's the torrent, my computer, or the game itself, but it's probably just me since no one else has complained about it. 
Does anyone have a possible solution, though?"

,turbofog,2012-05-05T05:39Z,"@DrunkPollock
If you are lagging do this:
1. Go to your Start menu and click run.
2. Type dxdiag.exe and press Enter.
3. The Dxdiag should come out and there should be a tab called ""Sound"", click it.
4. Go to Hardware Sound Acceleration Level and lower it down to No Acceleration. This should fix all lag problems.

For everyone who is having problems with GFWL, do these:
1. Make an offline account, the option is underlined when you create a new account in-game.
2. When asked for a code for the game, simply press ESC to close the popup and get into the game.

@FaMoUz Thanks for the great upload!"
,carnFX,2012-05-05T09:34Z,"I extracted everything and copied and replaced, etc..like I've always done..but when I run the game it's just a black screen with a different cursor.
