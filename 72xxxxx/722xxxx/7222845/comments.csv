I'd rather do that, because of low quality of your rips."
[V],catflap,2012-04-28T06:58Z,"it's not a rip, you n00b. it's impossible
to rip anything from tv. it's called a cap,
as in ""capture"". ripping can only
be done from a disc.

go away and learn the correct terminology,
dumb n00b.

and as your account is bare, learn
how to rip and cap yourself before
you criticize someone, especially a VIP,
who has more than 16 years p2p experience
and more than 5 years p2p journalism (which
can be proved, btw).

dumbass noob.

don't complain. it's free.
and i'm not interested, n00b."

Then why not watch/capture stuff in HD? You're wasting your money, and our time uploading this crap."

,Jinny_007,2012-05-11T10:13Z,"Thanks Catflap, this show is not on in Australia, so appreciate it. 
This is watchable and i guess people cant read, as they are complaining. They may need glasses, either that or a reading tutor."
