,bajoseph67,2012-04-30T00:20Z,"early upload, but the video is laggy. and the audio is kinda....distorted in some parts that u cant understand what they say, specially on 00:55
and some other parts.
can u re-record it?"
,newton8573,2012-04-30T04:26Z,"I can confirm this release is broken.

Both laggy (as in computer  busy doing something causing strange bugs in the software you use) and annoying tv receiver bug ~02:54

Please make a proper.


What have happened, lately the videos  have been bad.

You seem to be using a computer not powerful enough to get the job done and a user is using it while recoding and encoding causing bad things to happen.

Yet again i ask: what software are you using ?
the software you use seem to be of low quality.

btw based on the sort of lag in video: recodring machine needs a defrag"
[T],despo1ler,2012-05-01T00:45Z,"the quality of my encode is dependant on the source I get, as I do not live in the US I have to take what I can get.If that source is less than perfect my encode will reflect that and I can do nothing to improve it.
 {C_P} release group is not able to release this show at present as the only active US encoder can not receive the channel it airs on so I am having to make the best of any source that is available, the only alternative to this encode is to do a web rip from the HUB's website when they add the video a week after it airs, which is highly likely to be a lot more glitchy than any TV rip, as there are still no Web DL rips of any of this 2nd season at all."
