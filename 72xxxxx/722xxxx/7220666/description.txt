Spartacus is an American television series that premiered on Starz on January 22, 2010. The series was inspired by the historical figure of Spartacus, a Thracian gladiator who from 73 to 71 BC led a major slave uprising against the Roman Republic. Executive producers Steven S. DeKnight and Robert Tapert focused on structuring the events of Spartacus' obscure early life leading up to the beginning of historical records.[2] The show has been rated TV-MA for graphic violence, strong sexual content, and coarse language.

The first season was titled Spartacus: Blood and Sand. Although the show was initially renewed for a second season, production was delayed because lead actor Andy Whitfield was diagnosed with early-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Because of the delay, Starz produced a six-episode prequel mini-series entitled Spartacus: Gods of the Arena. Pre-production of season 2 began when Whitfield was cancer-free,[3] though his cancer recurred,[4] so Starz replaced Whitfield (who later died on September 11, 2011[5]) with actor Liam McIntyre for the role of Spartacus at the start of season two entitled Spartacus: Vengeance.[6] [7]
