,JoePlum,2012-04-27T14:52Z,another fucked up torrent from this ignorant punk
,SCSA420,2012-04-27T19:30Z,FUCK YOU ASSSCLOWN THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. IF YOU CAN DO A BETTER JOB THEN DO IT OTHERWISE SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU LEECHER PIECE OF SHIT
,SCSA420,2012-04-27T20:21Z,"Oh and hey JoePlum its not my fault youre an ignorant assclown who can't configure your pc or whatever you play your files on. Sure is funny I test my files on 2 different PC's a Maingear Core I7 2700k desktop and an Asus Core I5 2450m laptop before I upload them as well as 3 different BluRay players that are MKV compatible a Panasonic DMP-BD75, a Philips BDP 2900, and an LG BD670 3D BluRay player. My suggestion to you is to download and install the Klite codec pack full and configure it to play back all types of audio and video files and it comes with media player classic which can play any kind of media files. VLC player sucks. Later jabroni.........."
,JoePlum,2012-04-27T23:55Z,"my suggestion to you is as follows - if you cannot handle the technology and do not seed your own torrents, go the fuck away

and think about getting your own materials, loser ""assclown"" ""jabroni"" thanks for the laugh. By the way, looks like your caps lock broke for a bit"
,SCSA420,2012-04-28T03:04Z,oh and by the way jackass I seed my torrents with 2 different broadband connections here a 7 mbps dsl connection and a 12 mbps cable Wi-Fi connection. so STFU................
,punkrets,2012-04-30T17:29Z,"@SCSA420 nice quality,this is my 2nd download from you,good job , if it can be done i'll love to see video quality improved BUT WITHOUT CUTTING DOWN ON 59.940 ,you can lower the audio a little or whatever you do and make video quality little better.
thanks once again 59.94fps is sssssmooth,top rop moves look amazing at that fps.thanks
don't listen to others who say -ve about it"
