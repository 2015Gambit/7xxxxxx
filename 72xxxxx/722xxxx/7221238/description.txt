Ry Legit honed his skills in producing, writing, and playing music for nearly 10 years before the emerging heavy style of Dubstep caught his ear in 2009. It was like nothing he had heard before, and a perfect match for his style of expression. A year later, after producing nearly 20 dubstep tracks exclusively released to his YouTube Channel, Ry released Buzz Lightyear. The song gained a massive viral internet response within a year, gathering millions combined listens. RyΓÇÖs influential mix of listening gangster rap, hardcore metal, classical masterpieces, and timeless film scores have all lead to RyΓÇÖs style, allowing him to produce unique music that has been signed to multiple labels and distributed for worldwide consumption.
