,mistawundaful,2012-04-30T23:08Z,Download AVS Video Converter and do it yourself.  Thanks for the upload...brutal.
[V],joshua13,2012-05-01T03:52Z,"play it with vlc, you don't need it to be avi. 
mkv container is used for high quality x264 this should be better than an avi version with outdated xvid"
,HotJonny420,2012-05-03T03:14Z,The point isnt i cant play mkv. its that all of my collection is in avi and i like it better. Dont get me wrong i appreciate all the uploads. Unless you have an Hd tv and cables it looks like shit on vlc and winamp.
