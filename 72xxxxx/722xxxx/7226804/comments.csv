I have stacks of the housewives shows on itunes and not sure what i use to convert them??  Thanks very much"

,poopp00p,2012-05-04T03:19Z,"Methinks that jamiemichael1984 is an asshole noob who doesn't understand how bittorrent works and is just ULing the torrent file (probably thinking that's all there is to it - and that people ""magically"" obtain the file) then letting it die. All of his torrents seem to never have been seeded. 

Hey, jamiemichael1984, why not google how torrents work before wasting everyone's time, ya pud-pulling pissant."

,tvmovie,2012-05-22T17:25Z,3lilmonkeys: It works for me. maybe ur internet provider's blocked it. it's a torrent site same as tpb
,BoonesFerry,2012-05-24T07:17Z,if you end up on a third party pay site then you are clicking on the wrong download button. try kat again. they have this series. click on the correct torrent download button.
