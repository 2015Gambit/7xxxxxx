It is with... great uncertainty that I upload this torrent.

I originally bought this album, from a band from my hometown that I had never heard, with an intense passion for music the likes of which I had never seen, simply to support the underdog.

I came home, popped this CD in, and it really blew my mind.

Let me be clear:

This is NOT on The Bay so you can get a freebie.

It is here to spread the word about a group of guys who make great music.

My intention here is to somehow have you who is reading this stumble upon this torrent, god willing, and say "Hey, this ain't bad" and tell a friend who tells a friend and so on.

So here it is: 

THIS ALBUM IS AVAILABLE TO YOU FOR SAMPLING PURPOSES ONLY. 

IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU HEAR, BUY THE ALBUM!!

IF YOU WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER ALBUM IN THE FUTURE, REALIZE THAT IT CAN NOT HAPPEN WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT.

JUST BUY THE ALBUM!!

Biography
Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far awayΓÇª. The members of Led By The Blind were spawned from half human and half extra-terrestrial DNA. An ancient extra-terrestrial family then brought them to Earth where they joined as one to spread the message that we are not alone. With all of them implanted with homing devices, each member easily found one another after years of honing their individual skills to be sure the message could be heard. They say donΓÇÖt believe what you hear. If you see it, believe it. WeΓÇÖre all led by the blind.
