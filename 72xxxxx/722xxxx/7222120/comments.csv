@topk
Do you even realize half of the words in the English language were very literally *STOLEN* from other languages because we never had a word to express those things?

Fuck you up your English only queer asshole with a foreign freight-train-mounted chainsaw.

Assholes like you make decent Americans and Englishmen seem like assholes to the rest of the world. I and many others want nothing to do with the likes of you.

Very similar to Mass effect and great with a mic. Keys are weird but you get used to them fast and you still wasd-move.

Basic stuff to get you started, cause it was a little frustrating till I figured out that you need to set keyboard in two parts of the configuration tool...

Open the BinaryDomainConfiguration tool, under the second tab - Input Configuration make sure Input Device is set to keyboard. Then also at the bottom you need to make sure that Input Display Icons is also set to keyboard.

This has got to be the most lazily, terrible and sloppily put together console port I have EVER played. All SEGA did was slap a PC label on the cover and shipped it off ""as is"". Just goes to show you how much they are shitting on their customers. No wonder it has barely sold 200k copies. The game itself looks enjoyable, however all this is just stomped mercilessly into the ground by this vile console port. I am just in complete disbelief... 
Great torrent btw, wish I could say the same for the game."

I did everything, run as admin for both the BinDom and BinDomConfig and even installed the update. Everytime I click to start the game it says Configuration file not found, please run the configuration tool. But when I go into the BinDomConfig to set it, I get some kind of error a Microsoft. NET Framework error - Could not load 'Microsoft.DirectX.DirectInput"
