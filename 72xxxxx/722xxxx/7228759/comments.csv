,darkizzle,2012-04-30T05:50Z,Oh man it was a shame that Sansa had to die and so painfully! But what could they do Robb had captured Joffrey and Cersei is a crazy bitch without her kids! At least now Joff is sharing a cell with Jaime I cant wait until he finds that he's his real father! It happened in the book so it should be in the next episode! And then that shadow baby killed Loras oh my god I was so sad when Renly started crying and Margaery tried to comfort him! Best episode of the series spillers!
,Vegeta9021,2012-04-30T06:03Z,"LMFAO , you're such a DUMB ASS darkizzle, at least read the books

and learn to SPOILER IT CORRECTLY, YOU FUCKING RETARD.  THOSE ARE NOT EVEN THE CORRECT SPOILERS, I READ THE BOOKS.

YOU just embarrassed YOURSELF BAHAHAHAHAHAA

What a DUMB ASS, how does it feel to feel like a DUMB ASS?"
,Vegeta9021,2012-04-30T06:03Z,YOU TOO SLOZEY FAGGGGG
,saurabh.k,2012-04-30T06:04Z,"@darkizzle :
Stop posting spoilers...asshole."

Thanks for the up ez, always my first in entertainment, may the gods cast nothing but good things down apon you."
,BreakingBadFan,2012-04-30T06:08Z,lol its darkizzle again. For those of you that dont know he is completely making this shit up. Nothing he says actually happens in the episodes. Ban this asshole already TPB!
,Dharator,2012-04-30T06:21Z,God dammit f*cking spoiler
,buhlfactor,2012-04-30T06:26Z,So has anybody actually watched this episode? Do we have a rar password?
,vinit5191,2012-04-30T06:28Z,"Thanks eztv !
Been waiting for this :)"
,vinit5191,2012-04-30T06:28Z,"@buhlfactor
No rar !"
,GracefulEase,2012-04-30T06:30Z,"I actually find Darkizzle's comments quite amusing.  Anyone with half an ounce of intelligence can tell they're a lie, thus making it quite amusing when all the true idiots announce themselves by complaining about him."
,Shadow_Dwellis,2012-04-30T06:54Z,"Thank you heaps, We dont get this program in NZ unless you got cable, cheers"
,ajbw,2012-04-30T07:20Z,"@GracefulEase I quite agree - I particularly enjoyed the first comment - from someone who actually knew for certain that they were fake spoilers but STILL didn't get the joke. I suspect he's parroting phrases that have been said to him on far too many occasions... ""YOU just embarrassed YOURSELF"" springs to mind."
,zonejones,2012-04-30T07:21Z,so many leechers!
,Vegeta9021,2012-04-30T07:33Z,"@ajbw GO DIE IN A DITCH YOU MOTHERFUCKER, I DIDN'T SAY SHIT TO YOU EITHER.

,Hellady,2012-04-30T09:10Z,"omg! I have to keep reminding myself how many selfish people are out there that can't even seed for 5 mins even! 
PLEASE seed everyone! Otherwise what's the point in a share site!"
,Hellady,2012-04-30T09:12Z,And thank you eztv! :)
,kellkoan,2012-04-30T09:41Z,"Hahaha, I think even Vegeta9021 is trolling, cuz no one can be that stupid. Best place to troll trolls would be a GoT torrent, amirite?! 

Of course, every time I say no one can be that stupid, the internet surprises me. "
,kellkoan,2012-04-30T09:49Z,"This downloaded in 5 mins for me. Erryone complaining about leechers/ppl not seeding, check your settings and bandwidth, etc, UR DOIN IT WRONG. Or go pay for HBO. Effing whingers. 

 My rule of seeding, for you n00bs: on a popular show like this; seed all the way up through the time it takes you to finish WATCHING the show. (Provided you watch it right away, obviously) This is AT A MINIMUM. On harder to find items, seed even longer since someone else out there probably needs it as much as you did. Basically, don't be a dick.   "
,ComeBack_Kid,2012-04-30T10:26Z,"I don't seed at all. I just download and remove it.  U mad, bitches?!"

,ndonic,2012-04-30T11:39Z,thanks as always
,RJdeWit,2012-04-30T12:01Z,"Those aren't even correct spoilers. I think it's funny that someone tries to come up with a spoiler that looks like it's real. And it's funny that some people are overreacting. Especially when their name is Vegeta9021. 

I trust eztv will have delivered top notch stuff again."
,Gerry19101986,2012-04-30T12:07Z,Jeez what a remarks and capsing 2 i suppose this vegate's caps button is stuck ( too much spit when typing causes keyboard failure ) everybody know that :D rating soon after download

,erich555,2012-04-30T15:44Z,Thanks EZ!
,BUGAB000,2012-04-30T15:45Z,"Thank you EZTV for yet another great upload. All this guy's uploads are outstanding!

I have downloaded all ASAP episodes from season 2 made available by EZTV.

All of them are of good quality, however scenes with a lot of darkness sometimes seem to lack a bit of contrast, making them loose out on detail. I wonder if these details are better distinguishable if one downloads the larger +/- 1,6 GB version!?!? (also uploaded by EZTV)
I am wondering if anyone else can corroborate on this or dismiss it as being the same?
(I watch it on my computer used VLC)

ps.
Everyone please seed to a +1 ratio, don't just leech, that way everyone is guaranteed a quick download time as well.

pps.
What is up with all these flame warring (fake) spoiler troll comments?  "
,wanitto,2012-04-30T16:51Z,"excellent! it set a download speed record...

although for the first HOUR it was at an average of 30Kb/s; it suddenly shot up to 11Mb/s"

,JustRacey,2012-04-30T21:42Z,Clean fast torrent as always with eztv!  Thanks a load. Great episode can't wait for the next one!  I am impressed on how well the show follows the books. Theon's character is just as despicable as written.
,tashbrooke,2012-04-30T22:40Z,"Generally shocked by how little seeders there for something that has been out for less than 2 days,

people who are deciding whether to download, just remember you are only downloading this because other people are sharing the love, so stop being selfish fucking cunts."
,dayglo666,2012-04-30T23:29Z,well tashbrooke thats usually the way for something that hasnt been out for a day even yet it may not have gathered a lot of viable seeders
,tflagger997,2012-04-30T23:46Z,"zedii - it is just that they abandoned the season 1 storylines and started the new, boring ones. 

As for the darkness/contrast - that was the way it aired.  Perhaps HBO slashed the budget the way AMC did with S2 of The Walking Dead (S3 of TWD is back to a full budget supposedly)."

,VampireMuffinMan,2012-05-01T12:28Z,"For anyone having trouble with the eps being too dark, most players have brightness and contrast controls, if you look for them.  For Windows Media Player you just right click on the 'screen' and mouse over 'Enhancements' and then click on 'Video settings'.  In VLC, click on the 'Show Extended Settings' button (looks like a little 3-slider equalizer) and then click on the 'Video Effects' tab and the 'Basic' sub-tab.  [The Synchronization tab is where you can match the audio to the video if you have a problem there, just FYI.]
I have to do this on everything I watch since my CRT has been darkening for the past year or so as it slowly dies..."

,RinkerLft,2012-05-17T19:30Z,Watch out - HBO is tracking all the Game of Thrones torrents! I know because I got an unpleasant email from my ISP... I guess it depends what country you're in and how they define copyright infringement. I don't wanna discourage seeding and all but you can also watch all Game of Thrones episodes through game-of-thrones.uprisestudios.co.uk in HD.
