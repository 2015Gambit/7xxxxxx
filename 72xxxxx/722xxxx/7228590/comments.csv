open the archive

open the installer for logic studio and enter the product key above

then wait till it finishes or asks for a disc

cancel the installer if it asks for the disk

then open logic pro 9.1.1 fix and follow instructions there


then open logic pro 9.17 update

if the documentation folder is in the archive ignore it

open logic and enjoy"
