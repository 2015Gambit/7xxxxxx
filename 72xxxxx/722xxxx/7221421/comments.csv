Incredible movie :) 
"
,Wave_rider,2012-04-27T18:46Z,"try living in Europe and it is dubbed. Download and watch in English...Or see in theaters dubbed (no subtitles) and spend the whole movie translating from German, for a movie you know would be way cooler if Audio was in the original voice (OV). Sadly, don't live near a large city that plays movies in OV.

Wish I was back home in SF and able to see it in IMAX 3d"

,fold4500,2012-04-27T20:33Z,"best to first watch on the computer and then if you have time get the chance to watch it at the cinema 1 or 2 weeks later. The film is layered so you can totally watch it again at the cinema and it will be a better experience because you saw it already but the quality wasn't good. You know the story but havnt had the big screen experience yet, a reverse from watching it at the cinema and then in crappy vhs or dvd later on"

I have no idea how far you are from the Dutch-German border and if you have the possibility to travel, but if it is possible you could visit a Dutch (the Netherlands) cinema.

@ DibyaTPB: Yes indeed. I only see this download as a bridge between cinema visits (oh yes, I will see this movie more than once on big screen) and the release of the Blue-Ray to spend my money on."

,Fritz.,2012-04-28T15:07Z,"djnero has to be one of the least intelligent people ive seen on this site.

the ""4d"" is physical contact, such as moving seats and water spraying and so on.

anyone with smallest amount of common sense should be able to see why that will never be a mainstream form of media.

for 1 the cost for an in-home system would be absurd and for 2 noone is going to want to get dressed up for a night out to get sprayed with water or whatever else at the movies.

i cant contribute to that type of insanity.

Thats not the situation with doctors. They do their job and get paid. I dont think anyone become a doctor just to save human lives. And last of all movies are for entertainment purpose only. If you dont like a movie dont watch it. Dont give your hard earned 10 bucks to the stars. And if you think its all very easy go and make a movie by yourself or become an actor who doesnt want remuneration for his work. if none of these make sense you probably are an alien.

This would contribute to the discussion you. Regarding the movie, is certainly a new level in terms of adapting comics to real life, or ""live action"" simply. Will stay for the story, and surely will do it for references to our children as we do today to Star Wars."

lol 70% of the planet is covered by what? Turn off the TV we are no where near to running out of oil.
I think the races are boring, but because of wasting gas? :) Don't believe what the oil companies & government wants you to believe. Do the math :-) we will run out of oil just enough to get the prices up as HIGH as they can get them!"

,ZombieCleaner,2012-04-30T12:22Z,"Guys , do any of u know how to remove just the credits from the movie ! i want to fit a movie into a dvd but nero is not allowing , caz the file size is 4490 and nero allows 4488 mb . What ever software  i use they are re-encoding the file after trimming . Any wayz or special software you know to reim the video file and not re encode it again . Thanks !"
,maewyn,2012-04-30T16:56Z,Sorry for this very stupid question ( I am very new to this stuff).  I have on my external hard drive allot of movies and stuff that I'm totally up for sharing.  But how do I do that? I can downlowd easy enough...just click here and a click there.
,balrog814,2012-04-30T18:42Z,"supergeek, I can't fathom the genious of your comment, jeez. You're lightyears ahead of us. You're probably a kid, grown only on VG's. Just stick with that boy, and don't write your dumbness. What's with the 70% water? Shall I do my math? I do my math every day. The price of fuel rises, due to depleting resources, that's a fact. We still have much, but the price will only go up. Isn't it high enough already? Even very rich people buy diesel cars, as even they have to look at the skyrocketing daily costs. Boy I don't watch TV, I just pay too much at the pump, while these mothercunt jockeys fuck up my cheap future resource. Go take Warcraft to the next level."
,seang95,2012-04-30T18:44Z,"@ZombieCleaner you could open the movie in a video editing program; even something as simple as windows movie maker would work, but I prefer something like Sony Vegas, and then use the time line to cut off the credits"
,krikri3,2012-04-30T22:12Z,dont ruin your experience with this movie and wait for a decent quality release.......

It would be a real shame to use this file the first time you watch the film!  Audio and video fidelity are critical to the enjoyment of this type of film.

,legio9,2012-05-03T22:16Z,"I still wonder WHY does people still upload such crap quality? Do they hire chimps with 1990 cameras to get those movies and then, be retarded enough to upload them? Looks like it!

Wake up up-loaders!  Its ain't a competition on volume! But if you want to compete in this realm, why don't you do it on the quality level instead?  That way, people won't waste precious bandwidth and the ""pirate"" community will be all the better!

Talk about ""seen it all before""--it's just a bunch of rehashed stuff, with lame dialog and wooden acting.  In a couple months, it'll be utterly forgotten, like ""Hunger Games"", and they'll trot out the next thing to hoover your wallet and machete your intelligence."

AGAIN TURN THE FUCKING AUTO FOCUS OFF."
,phat_71,2012-05-06T18:26Z,"@ zvengar -> Maybe you should quit being a whiney little bitch and take your own camera to the theater, pay the 20$ or whatever it is to get in, and then film it like a PRO without getting caught or being overly obvious. That way you could upload your version and then we can all enjoy the perfect movie experience right at home....

P.S. You're a douchebag, next time you want to cry GTFO and go cry in the arms of your mommy....douchebag."
