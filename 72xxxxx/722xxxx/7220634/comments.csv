Thanks DownTYU, great as always."
,BRAYHUNTER,2012-04-27T18:46Z,PQ and sound does suck when you watch these compressed to mkv on a high end AV system. This is why I'm always asking for the full bluray.

,TheBosun,2012-04-29T06:09Z,"@Vegeta9021  It’s obvious from the fact that you can’t string a sentence together, that you’re either an infant, in which case everything you’ve said will be taken with its due merit, or you’re too busy with your other hand under the table to pay attention to simple gramma.
Your lack of intellect astounds me to the point that I’m wondering if your mommy had to type that for you, if that was indeed the case, I meant no disrespect to your mother or her linguistic skills.  I realise that she was probably spoon feeding you at the time she was typing your reply.
Cheers"
