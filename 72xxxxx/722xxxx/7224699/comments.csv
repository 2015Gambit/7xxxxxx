,Vegeta9021,2012-04-28T21:26Z,"@Dereknell , can you download the sample you LAZY MORONIC RETARD?  Everyone has to do everything for you noob?"
,musclestud1,2012-04-28T22:13Z,"Derek, you're such a lazy lint-hair licker!  Download it yerself and find out!"
,Cameigons,2012-04-29T00:42Z,"I have no problem telling people the A/V score, I just don't try hard at all to remember coming back here for it...

I can download this stuff in minutes, I imagine not everyone in the world can do the same... they have to pick what they will download or fight the people in their household whom want the connection to remain 'uncrowded' for something else, etc.."
,JOMOinator,2012-05-11T17:36Z,"cameigons..is right not everyone has the ability to just download what they want, i can only get a few things a month because of the limits. So people saying 'dont be lazy' need to stfu we arent be lazy! we cant waste our bandwidth if it is gunna be a crappy quality. why cant you just help out and give the A/V."
