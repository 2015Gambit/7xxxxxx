,theseaman,2012-05-09T10:27Z,@Trenchsp Run the set-up while you're off-line. It worked for me :)
,tnt2201,2012-05-21T16:14Z,I am new to this whole process.  I got it to work on my PC.  Will this work on a MAC as well?
,uheardmebitch,2012-05-26T07:44Z,"@cactjunk, always upgrade, they usually fix bugs and things run faster. it will generally be the same though,
@scoffildreturns, thingy has already uploaded ""encore cs6"" but has labelled it premiere pro content for some reason.
@everyone who asks for ""mastersuite"" he will upload last after all separate programs are done.
and please people try to learn to read comments. it will save you time asking a question which has been asked fifty times"
