I was wondering, are you going to be uploading Justice League Unlimited in 720 Itunes like you did with the first two seasons of the regular show. I would be really grateful. Thank you for your time.

[T],tr108,2012-05-03T19:39Z,"@reapyard @xenoFLASH - I've done 24 of the 39 JLU eps so far (unfortunately out of order), but because of tech & scheduling issues, haven't had time to finish them off yet. But soon. Really! (I know it's been agonizing wait. Sorry.)

@dalubi - I'm excited for Safe House and when I see a good rip, I will encode & up.

Thanks for the kind words everyone"
