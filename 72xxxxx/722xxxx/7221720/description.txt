Let It Snow 
This documentary takes an in-depth look at snow - how it is produced, different types and the weather conditions that cause it. From howling blizzards to the gentlest and most delicate snowflakes, Let It Snow celebrates snow in all its forms. Thanks to CGI and new camera techniques, Let It Snow gives viewers the chance to see how snow is formed for the first time, and listen in to the unique sounds that snow makes when the tiny crystals touch, roll and settle together. Each snowflake is unique and contains more secrets than researchers first imagined - every bit of extraordinary sound the snow makes influences the kind of crystallisation process and the shape of the actual snowflakes. You'll be wishing for winter!
