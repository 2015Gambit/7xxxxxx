,diescheize11,2012-06-13T23:18Z,Don't download unless you can understand spanish. The only bad thing about torrents!!!:::(((
,SrMLove,2012-09-08T06:57Z,"@diescheize11: hey dip shit the movie is in that common language known as English (you typed in it) and the subs included are: English & SWEDISH... not Spanish dumbass.... way to misinform ppl... hopefully they do a little thing known as detailed observation and reading... both are vital when giving advice... especially when you don't know what the fuck you are talking about... you are a prime example of the ppl on here who should just be happy they are getting what they get... and not bitch when they don't know what they are talking about. and another little fun fact.. you can get this TORRENT in multiple languages( whichever one you can understand) and you can also d/l subtitles of any language for the movie by just looking online for it.. see there is actual helpful AND informative... both things you are neither... hopefully this will sink in... but based on your knowledge this will go unread by you and deleted by TPB... in essence a waste... like you!

so no one listen to ^^^ (diescheize11)... b/c he/she has no idea what they are talking about it... no matter what the language barrier. "
