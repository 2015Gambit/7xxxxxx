From Wiki:


Rheostatics was a Genie Award-winning Canadian indie rock band, active from 1980 to 2007.

Although they had only one Top 40 hit, "Claire" in 1995, they were simultaneously one of Canada's most influential and unconventional rock bands,[1] a band whose eclectic take on pop and rock music has been described both as iconic and iconoclastic.[2] In particular, two of the band's albums, Whale Music and Melville, have been cited in numerous critical and listener polls as among the best Canadian albums ever recorded.
