It irked me the way the Sin City Recut Extended Unrated DVD played - watching one segment then back to the menu to pick another, watch that one then back to the menu, and so on, rather than playing in one continuous shot.  So I rebuilt it.  I kept only the 2 channel English audio track.  I kept only the English subtitles, but edited them for accuracy and made them light red for effect.  I cut all of the credits.  I demuxed and remuxed by necessity but with no transcoding or shrinking.  This edit is lossless, both video and audio, and plays straight through in one shot.  The run time is 2 hours 4 minutes.

I think you'll like the arrangement I chose.
