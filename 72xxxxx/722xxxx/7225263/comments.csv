,santorus,2012-04-29T15:05Z,"People
there's a fake user called Cryonica that is trying to demove people from sharing ttc lectures. This user is spreading gossips about IP tracing, sues and prosecutions, don't believe him! God bless you people."
[V],dohduhdah,2012-04-29T15:34Z,"Cryonica is not a fake user.
For instance, she uploaded ""TTC - Mysteries of the Microscopic World"" to Demonoid."
,Cryonica,2012-04-30T19:04Z,"I am not a fake user!!! I have uploaded lots of torrents on Demonoid.  But I got a strange message telling me TGC are prosecuting anyone posting their new material using their IP address. So I wrote to other uploaders of TTC courses and asked them if they had the same message.  The fake user is more likely the person who sent me the message, which by the way I forwarded to the Demonoid administrator. That person has never uploaded anything.  "
,indiaman,2012-04-30T19:21Z,"I am still uploading these lectures but thanks in advance.Any news on ""Engg.Circuit Analysis Vol.2 & 3"" by MathTutorDVD ? "
[V],dohduhdah,2012-05-01T00:15Z,"Nope, sorry indiaman.. haven't seen that one yet."

,soletar,2012-05-05T06:29Z,"Hi dohduhdah,
thanks for all your sacrifice and generosity in uploading all these free stuff. Pls i have a problem. i am very shy and wish to be a good orator and great public speaker. the TTC art of public speaking had remarkably poor content. can any one out there recommend videos teaching Public speaking? over to you, guys....."
,FatFreddy071,2012-05-05T11:07Z,Thanks dohduhdah - any chance this could be done rather than me downloading all 3.3gb
[V],dohduhdah,2012-05-05T14:19Z,"@readitlater: if you're lucky an audio version might become available at some point, but personally I tend to focus on TTC videos mostly."
