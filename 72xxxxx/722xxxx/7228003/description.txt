Great collection of some classic recordings not heard in many years. Some recordings are obscure, others are remembered fondly. It's so nice that someone has taken the time and effort to rescure these old recordings so that a new generation of listeners can hear what real music sounds like in a world of mostly noisy racket we are constantly subjected to in today's world. Steel guitar remains the mystic instrument with a haunting sound unequaled by any instrument, and is sadly absent from today's music scene. A top-notch collection of some really great old songs and sounds!
