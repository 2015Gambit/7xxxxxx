Narratives:

Three years on, Oh Holy Molar adds bark to the debut's bite. Since then the chamber-pop duo, Nottingham's Lucinda Chua and multi-instrumentalist Chris Summerlin, have added a third member - namely drummer Neil Turpin, nabbed from Yann Tiersen's live setup. It's hardly the most revolutionary shakeup, but initial distinctions are twofold: the hushed, awkward vocal performance of the debut has been streamlined somewhat, perhaps for popular consumption, and where You Are The One I Pick's pathetic whispers initially evoked a fleeting sense of embarrassment on Chua's behalf, you feel a boldness to Oh Holy Molar that's sophisticated and immediate.
