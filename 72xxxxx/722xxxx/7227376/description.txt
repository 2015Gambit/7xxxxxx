- INFO:
Supertramp are a British rock band formed in 1969 under the name Daddy before renaming themselves in early 1970. Though their music (marked by the inventive songwriting of Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson) was initially categorized as progressive rock,  Supertramp would enjoy greater critical and commercial success when they incorporated  a combination of traditional rock and art rock into their music in the mid-1970s, going on to sell more than 60 million albums.
They reached their peak of  success with 1979's Breakfast in America, which has sold more than 20 million copies.
