Do you wish to debug it ?"
,ToasterStrudelz,2012-04-29T20:11Z,@0PEP0 What are the specs for your Mac? Most ports have trouble working on anything other than nVidia GFX cards.
,jonne.zoide,2012-04-29T21:50Z,"Dang, I get the same error as TheKneeGrowsKFC, running 10.6.8 with a Geforce GT7600."
,Vikenen,2012-04-30T00:23Z,Same error as the others for me.
,cccck,2012-05-09T15:27Z,"Ok. So I started the game, it worked. I went to the settings, to change some things when I wanted to change it to windowed mode. At that point it crashed and when IO now try to start it, I just get to the Ciderx logo, I can hear the game sounds, but that's it ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
Any idea in which config file I can change the game back to fullscreen? Or how I fix this in general? Reinstalling doesn't fucking hep."
,camyoza,2012-06-05T03:55Z,everything worked perfectly untill i tryed to play episode 1 got the same error as KneegrowsKFC
,camyoza,2012-06-05T04:02Z,ok another stupid problem is that if you change try resolution it will just crash and you can never open it again reinstalling does nothing basically what im saying is do not download this torrent.
,camyoza,2012-06-06T02:17Z,Can we please get some feedback toaster!
,camyoza,2012-06-06T06:34Z,ok well despite no feedback what so ever i managed to fix the problem of being able to open the game back up after trying to change resolution. delete your current copy of the app and extract it with the default app Archive Utility it worked for me before i used 7rip. still having a problem with Unhandled page fault on read access to 0xdeadbeef at address 0xdeadbeef cant figure out what to do.
