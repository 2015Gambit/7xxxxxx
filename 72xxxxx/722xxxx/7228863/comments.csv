,mankind316,2012-04-30T16:57Z,5 hours have passed since i starting downloading this torrent. slooooow sloooooow slooooow. a massive list of peeps all giving out 0.1kbs wtf is the point. managed to download several films since this little file began. same with the 2gb version..sloooow slooow. please seed at a worth while rate..i always do!!!
,TombstoneInc,2012-04-30T20:16Z,"ILL say this, this dude is a life saver. Ill be honest im not going to freakin pay 50 dollars for something that is basically a WM repeat except for what 2 matches? And the fact this Extreme Rules isnt ""extreme"" a total lack of good hardcore type matches. That said i have tried downloading all morning, from Rudos and Sir Paul and Evil Crew AND NONE of them will go fast, i did LOVE RULZ WM and sure it was 22 parts but oh well IT DOWNLOADED fast and small size and was watchable. YOU dont have to have 1 whole or 2 large parts. The fact is this one is just as good. I found this after searching and searching and all i came across was Rudos, or evil crew or sir paul and a couple others, those had links to the .rar parts but those were slow as hell. I find this one after remembering love rulz and within 5 minutes it was done and im watching. THANKS SO MUCH Love Rulz, i love your style, i love the fact you keep the file size low but keep the video quality decent. And the fact you dont care what some say about there being so many parts. PLEASE do this for every WWE PPV. Thanks 300% 10/10 5 stars in my book."
,TombstoneInc,2012-04-30T20:28Z,"Other Torrents being 1.6GB or 2.0GB, hell i even saw one that was 5.6GB. Why in the world do i want to download something that large when i can get the same thing for only 600 MB.  I always love smaller file sizes, that doesnt mean the quality is lower and this video looks amazing and wish more people would think about reducing the file sizes, because 1 the downloads are faster and 2 more people MAY SEED if its lower cause it doesnt take as long. THE REASON alot of people dont seed is the large file sizes. I have the highest speed internet COX Comunications offers, and yet those bigger files sometimes wont get up past 200/Per Second. Its crazy. And again i find this one and it took me about  5 minutes. Wow simply the best. Love Rulz keep this up and you can become the top WWE torrent man."
,CRZy.,2012-04-30T21:20Z,"Well, For me its gonna take 5 hours instead of 5 minutes."
[V],loverulz,2012-05-02T19:05Z,YES I DO THIS IN EVERY PPV
