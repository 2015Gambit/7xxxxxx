The 7th race of the NASCAR Nationwide Series the Virginia 529 College Savings 250 took place on a Friday 04/27/2012. Pole winner Kevin Harvick leads the field to the green flag on the 0.75 mi (1.2 km) asphalt D-Shaped Oval in Henrico County, Virginia. Richmond International Raceway opened in 1946 and seats approx. 97,912 race fans. Richmond International Raceway is one of a few race tracks to host all of its events under the lights. The track sold out 33 consecutive NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races. The sellout streak ended in September 2008 partially due to the economic downturn, though the major factor in ticket sales was the impact of Tropical Storm Hanna.
 
Richmond has hosted the final "regular-season" race, leading up to the start of the Chase for the Sprint Cup, each year since the Chase concept was introduced in 2004. The race is often referred to as "One Last Race to Make The Chase."
