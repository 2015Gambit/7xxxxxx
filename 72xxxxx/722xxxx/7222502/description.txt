Omaha-based Neva Dinova has put out a very tidy ten-song, self-titled album. Coming off as a cross between a dreamy, ambient guitar-fronted project, a lounge act ("Lucifer's Lament"), and an Americanized U2, the five lads in Neva Dinova don't seem to falter too much. This album seems suited for the bitter cold days of winter looking out onto pastoral landscapes. Tunes such as "Did You Disappoint Your God?" reflect this gentle mood. The next song, "At Least the Pain Is Real," reflects another side of the band, while not alienating anyone. It starts out with simple guitar and drum work and builds into a pseudo-Radiohead swagger until the chorus bursts at the seams, sending the song all over the place in a beautiful mess. Later on in the tune, the guitar plays out a delicate solo and at the point where one might think it'll play back on itself and repeat, it instead works nicely into a gentle distortion reminiscent of a refreshing drink from a natural waterfall. Definitely an album meant for the more starkly emotional months related back to autumn and winter, this self-titled work shows that there's more going on in Omaha than some might think.
