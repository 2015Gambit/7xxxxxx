,360tech,2012-05-06T19:12Z,this also works on jtagged console but you must update your jtag to the latest dashboard via the reflashing method (not via microcrap) take the iso and run through iso to god i removed sytem update folder to save it messing up cause ya never know :P........
,fankoosh,2012-05-07T01:29Z,"@paff11 , LT+3 should play all ur XGD2 games without issue , but for the XGD2 games with A.P2.5 eg: MW2 , BOps , Halo reach ..etc , if it will not run , then u have to run the original iso on ABGX1.06 to fix ( autofix level3) & to reburn these games again after fix , goodluck :)"

,rixuxu,2012-05-28T20:27Z,"Most of the times you do excellent uploads, when they aren't it's just because there are not seeds (and that's a shame) but this upload just SUCKS.
I love Sniper Elite, but i waste 3 verbatim DL-DVD trying to write this fucking game. The first time the xbox recognized it, but it freezed at the beggining, when the REBELION logo appeared, i tryed to intall it on console and it says disc is scratched (wich was not) at 40%. Second and third time the xbox just didn't recognized the game. Waste of money. Oh, and my console updated but all my other XGD2 games are still working. Shame on you boobsman, shame on you."
