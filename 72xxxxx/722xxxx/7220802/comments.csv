The terrible cries of tortured traitors have given the Tower of London a particularly grisly place in the history of the capital of England.Despite its reputation as the home of expert execution, accounts of the time suggest that being put to death in the Tower could be a messy business. Was it a faulty axe or executionerâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s anxiety which caused the botched beheading of the Duke of Monmouth, who finally lost his head at the fifth blow?!"
