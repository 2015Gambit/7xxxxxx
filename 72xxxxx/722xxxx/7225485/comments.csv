,maustin,2012-05-23T14:05Z,"Lol, be gentle on the poor newbs Avian. Thanks a lot for this! This was a great show, though I do remember season 2 being pretty trippy and not really resolving anything (at least not satisfactorily?) I was young when I watched it though, so maybe I'll understand it better this time. ^^ Will seed this one indefinitely."
,Aaargh666,2012-06-20T16:23Z,I heard little English spoken. It's mainly in Japanese. Which sucks. But thank AvianFlu anyway. It was free!
