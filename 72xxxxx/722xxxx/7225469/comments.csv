,tobies,2012-04-29T00:12Z,PLEASE SEED!!! :S
,AnxiouslyCalm93,2012-04-29T00:30Z,I'll seed and download but what does this do?? noob question...
,nasums,2012-04-29T00:40Z,"Seeding as much as possible on this connection, shouldn't be too long before I have another computer up and seeding."
,nasums,2012-04-29T00:41Z,"These are game console emulators, people have taken consoles EX. Game cube, Nintendo and made them into computer applications so you can play your favorite old school games on your computer."
,Jbharrison355,2012-05-19T13:59Z,"This won't let me download it. It opens in uTorrent and looks like it's going to work but it quickly stops and just sits in the ""inactive"" folder. I can stop and start it again but it only repeats the process."
,Jbharrison355,2012-05-19T14:04Z,"Also, (I think this is more to the point) the availability bar is red and it says 0. What does this mean and how can I fix it (or get around it)?"
,amateuruser,2012-06-02T04:57Z,pleeeeease seed there are 0 seeders right now! :(
,amateuruser,2012-06-11T01:22Z,"again, please seed! I've been trying to download this for a few days now! :("
