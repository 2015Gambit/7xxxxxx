This is [MAC] Emulator Pack 2

I had a lot of friends asking where, when, how, why, WHERE?! I got my emulators etc. So I compiled a folder with already extracted, well working copies of a few emulators. This is pack 2, it includes the more fancier side of emulation. Although it doesn't reach out as far as the Xbox, those sources are few and far between when it comes to open source. For more in depth emulators like Xbox, PS2, PS3 etc. read the READ ME file.

1) DREAM CAST 
2) GB / GB COLOR
3) NEO GEO POCKET
4) NINTENDO DS
5) ODESSEY
6) SEGA SATURN

[AGAIN] The file is compressed into a .zip to further speed up your download, if people complain about that being a virus then I'll scrap it and upload the entire folder.
