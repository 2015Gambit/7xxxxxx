If you agree some things should be censored then get the fuck off TPB, you don't belong in a place where freedom and lack of censorship is prised above all else. And all you lot slagging off Asians, where the fuck do you think all the servers will soon have to be to get access to places like TPB, that's right, like India and Pakistan, just wait and see! "

,twi666788,2012-04-30T23:45Z,"Tezz (English: Fasty/Speedy) is a 2012 Hindi action thriller film directed by Priyadarshan. The film features an ensemble cast including Anil Kapoor, Ajay Devgan, Boman Irani, Kangna Ranaut, Sameera Reddy, and Zayed Khan. It also had south Indian actor Mohanlal in a cameo. The stunt choreographer chosen for the movie was Gareth Milne, the stunt co-ordinator of Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer and National Treasure: Book of Secrets. Tezz was earlier titled ""Bullet Train"". 

The official trailer was released on January 4, 2012. 

The movie was released on April 27th, 2012 in 2000 screens.

A part of movie's plot and scenes are inspired by the movies The Bullet Train and Keanu Reeves starrer Speed. 

The movie received poor score from many critics and did not perform well at the box office."

REFERING TO YOUR COMMENT >>>>>>.oh yeah ...really we should be nuked? what are you then? the faggest fag in the town get a life.. you want to knw something abt India.. here u gooo When we greet one another, we foId our hands in namastey... because we beIieve... that God resides in the heart of every human being. We come from a nation where we aIIow a Iady of CathoIic origin... to step aside for a Sikh to be sworn in as Prime Minister... to a MusIim President to govern a nation of over 80 percent Hindus. It may aIso interest you to know that... many of the origins to your words come from Sanskrit. For exampIe, maatr becomes mother... bhratr becomes brother, giamiti becomes geometry trikonniti becomes trigonometry. We have 5600 newspapers... magazines in over twenty-one different Ianguages... with a combined readership of over 120 miIIion. We have reached the moon and back, but yet... you people still feel that we've onIy reached as far as the Indian rope trick We are the third largest pool in the word of doctors, engineers and scientists. Maybe your grandfather didn't teII you that... we have the third Iargest army in the worId. And even then, I foId my hands in humiIity before you... because we don't beIieve we are above or beneath any individuaI. And... namastey."
,sahilrox,2012-05-01T17:35Z,"And let me tell you, even if more than 50% population is illiterate, and know nothing about the world, there is the other half who is above Superstitions,  casts, racism and believe all countries have human beings that are equal and should be respected.
In this world of globalization, where all countries are trading with each other for comparative advantage, you talk completely nonsense. More Indian celebrities are blending with Hollywood. Music greats like AR Rahman who has written songs for Oscar Winner films like the Slumdog Millionaire for which US Directors got the award, won it by depicting India, not any other country.
US Celebrities want to come to India to get married because they are fascinated by it and don't want it to get nuked. One of the Seven Wonders Of The World Belongs here. India was a richer country than UK, US Combined 300 years back before the British invaded India and took away all the gold, making them richer. I Think i have said enough. A decent enough person would have understood by now....."

,i_steal_media_hohoho,2012-05-01T22:02Z,"@The_Cunt 

Shut the fuck up you fucking moron, Jesus fucking Christ! I don't know where you're from but if it's like the UK, same as me, then why don't you look up what we did to India and the Indian people during the day of the empire? They should hate us, not vice versa, if you had a brain cell you would know that. Also if it wasn''t for them during the war we would be seriously fucked! Oh yeah and you like a nice cup of tea??? Where the fuck do you think that came from? Dumb fuck. So shut you stupid fucking mouth up, you're a fucking embarrassment to yourself and the pirate bay. Oh and once again, if you agree with censorship (ie, censoring Bollywood movies from TPB) then you are a hypercritical moron, get the fuck off here!!!"

,jigubhai2001,2012-05-03T02:26Z,"@ jayhanton...... @Z3DK .......Abe sale Chutiye log..... how the hell can you guys talk about originality..... BTW American Idol, X-Factor, America's Got Talent, Big Brother, Survivor, etc..... etc..... are all shows that were brought to US from different countries....

Also if you are a real movie buff, which i highly doubt you are.... more than 80% of the movies in Hollywood are adapted from novels and movies that have already been made in different countries..... got get your heads out of your stinking, obese  ass and take a peak at reality....."
,jigubhai2001,2012-05-03T02:35Z,"Oh also if your ignorant ass did not know... all the major US production houses FOX, PIXAR, Universal studios.... have all set up shops in India to take a make and produce Bollywood movies.....

So go blame your OWN AMERICAN PEOPLE for making these after all they financed it..... What a great way to put American Tax Payers money at work.....

And if you did not already know......The so called original cool movies full of animation and special effects that you enjoy watching day in day out..... are made created in India......

So sure nuke India and all the other countries... the question is what will your ignorant ass do for entertainment then......."
