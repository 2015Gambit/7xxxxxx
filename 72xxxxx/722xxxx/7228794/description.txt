PLOT

A Spectacular car crash. A quiet garden. A lemon tree ablaze

From these disparate images emerges the story of Tom, a
British chef in a Bondi restaurant, who seems to think there
are no longer any rules he has to obey. Ignoring the people
who love him, and the needs of his young son, he appears set
on a path to self destruction

But Tom wasn't always like this
