Janis Lyn Joplin (January 19, 1943 ΓÇô October 4, 1970) was an American singer and songwriter from Port Arthur,
Texas. As a youth Joplin was ridiculed by her fellow students due to her unconventional appearance and personal
beliefs. She later sang about her experience at school through her song "Ego Rock." Early in her life, Joplin
cultivated a rebellious and unconventional lifestyle, becoming a beatnik poet. She began her singing career as a folk
and blues singer in San Francisco, playing clubs and bars with her guitar and auto-harp.
