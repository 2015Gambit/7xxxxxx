,seemovies,2012-04-29T12:51Z,"i dont normally hate on people but i have to agree, nobody watches your shit.. the quality is too bad i only complain now so you wake up and realise rather than defend your actions."

[T],despo1ler,2012-04-30T22:31Z,"if nobody watches c_p releases howome they get so many downloads?

And as for complaining, I don't see anyone mentioning the fact that the general quality of all releases has made a big improvement over the last 2 weeks and I have not seen one single person offer to help the RG out since we lost most of our encoders a cpl of months ago other than the 1 guy who is now keeping these saturday morning shows going for us. He may have had some issues with quality while he learns to use the capture equipment he went out and bought just so he could keep our group releaseing these shows but we are grateful to him whatever the quality as the alternative is waiting for the scene to release the show. Oh whoops, the scene don't cover this show or many of the others C_P release so unless you are able to offer a better alternative pls keep complaints to yourself. 
If you are not  satisfied with the quality then please, by all means, contact our group and give us better quality encodes to release. Otherwise just appreciate the fact that we are able to release these shows at all thanks to the one person who is giving up his saturdays to record and encode them for us and single handedly keeping our releases coming. 
I just hope that the ingratitude that is shown for his efforts don't lead to him quitting on us."

If you want it to your standards, go fucking pay for it rather than getting at somebody who is simply trying to do you a service with no personal gain."

[T],helder1965,2012-05-04T19:00Z,"Today teams 2HD and FQM announced that they will adopt formt x264/MP4, finnaly! When C_P will adopt this new format? Do you intend insist on XviD/AVI?"
,morpheusxnyc,2012-05-12T07:46Z,"Thanks so much for the Green Lantern rips. They are so hard to find and I've noticed that he somehow seems to get them a week before they air in the U.S.. So double thanks for that!

As for he MP4 format, while that's good if you want to watch them on your PC, for those of us with media players, many of which don't support MP4, it requires us to convert ever file to AVI/MPEG before we can sit down on the couch and watch it, so we very much appreciate the AVI/DIVX/XVID encodes.

Thanks again!"
