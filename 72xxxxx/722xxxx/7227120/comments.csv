,tonymxpcell,2012-05-03T17:21Z,Thank you! very important for me!
,rudolphrnr,2012-05-06T20:06Z,"There doesn't appear to be a professional edition.  If it isn't available for sale on corel.com, you are not likely to find it on tpb."

,press2012,2012-05-08T00:58Z,AV keeps deleting kg. Can anyone post a serial. I have no plans on upgrading so I just need the serial to get the ap going. TIA.

,Vicpdx192,2012-05-10T23:37Z,"Great upload! Keygen works perfectly and got it successfully activated!!!

PS: Remember to turn off your Anti-virus or the Keygen wont work. If you don't it will say its a Trojan which is a false positive.

,farstanley,2012-05-18T10:34Z,Word of warning. File core10k.exe contained a virus when I downloaded X5.
,lvlegaleagle,2012-06-23T21:19Z,Some kind of minimal instructions would be nice. Thank You for your sharing but I cannot seem to figure out your generator other than some nice music and screen designs. Instructions would be nice. THANKS AGAIN
,lvlegaleagle,2012-06-23T22:48Z,This Torrent DOES NOT have the KEYMAKER or KEYGEN.exe file to properly open this SO NO USE DOWNLOADING IT since you can only use it 30-days then it expires. But GO DOWN to Wordperfect X5 version and the torrent by CODY does have the KEY GENERATOR to activate the X5 version.

Did you turn OFF your anti-virus software PRIOR to downloading these files?

These files are NOT contained in an archive so, if your anti-virus software is still active, the keymaker will be deleted or quarantined before you even get a chance to open the folder after the download.

Turn OFF your anti-virus until you finish downloading and installing the software and then turn it back on again.

If you want to save it to install later, you need to put it into a compressed archive so your anti virus won't delete it.  When you're ready to install it - TURN OFF YOUR ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE until the installation is completed!"
