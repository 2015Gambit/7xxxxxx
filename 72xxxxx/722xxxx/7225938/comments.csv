,tiz2,2012-05-01T15:03Z,"@ sage1210: Wrong on both counts. There's nothing in this game you game you can't get with skill instead of $. I haven't spent anything on this and I would still rape your ass if you spent a 1000$. This is a new game (2012) and there's always lots of populated servers, a bit too early to call time of death don't you think? In short: You obviously don't know about this game, or you are just crap at fps-shooters, either way you should stfu.  "
