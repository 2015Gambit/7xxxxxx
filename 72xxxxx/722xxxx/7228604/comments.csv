,sibbeast,2012-04-30T18:59Z,"avi? Not again :(
Thanks anyways"
,jordanidk,2012-04-30T20:38Z,It cuts off as Brian asks meg what she's up to. It's near the end but I'm fairly sure it wasn't supposed to end like that..there aren't credits or anything.
,Amea81,2012-04-30T22:35Z,Yeah weird cutoff at the end..!
,v3ng3,2012-04-30T22:51Z,Are we sure that's not actually how it ends? Like just before the screen goes black? Would be unlike eztv to cut the end out
,bowlinwes300,2012-04-30T23:03Z,to the people talking about the cut off.... Guys it's Meg this was more than intentional. I watched it live and it did the same thing so don't worry about it. 
,f-beacon,2012-04-30T23:36Z,Thanks
,g8aso,2012-05-01T08:21Z,"cuts out at 20.57, the end is missing!"
,spunky7,2012-05-01T20:35Z,"thanx for the UL:) i think the cut off was typical coz this eps seemed like a no(hate) meg eps, was kinda funny cutoff just before she was about to speak. i didnt see chris either. "
,ebud,2012-05-02T05:03Z,"i watched it live as well: CUT OUT IS NORMAL, it was meant to be that way... it's a No-Meg episode."
