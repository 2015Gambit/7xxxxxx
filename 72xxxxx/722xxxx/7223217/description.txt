Metanet Software was founded in 2001 by Raigan Burns and Mare Sheppard. Metanet is a indie game development company devoted to creating fun, innovative, unique games. 

Our first (and award-winning) game, N, is available for download from the main page; it's 100% free, and can be played on Mac or PC. We followed that up with N+, versions of which are available on Xbox360 LIVE! Arcade, DS and PSP. Find out more at The Way Of The Ninja. Our next games, Robotology and Office Yeti, are in development and will be released as soon as possible. Follow development on our devblog, by hitting the Blog button above. 

We've released tutorials, including source code, which cover the collision detection and simulation algorithms used in N. Click on the Technique button above to check them out, plus slides from presentations we've done on various subjects and other tools to help you make games.
