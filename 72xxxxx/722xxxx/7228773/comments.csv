I've been refreshing you upload list for idk, 12 hrs. Just waiting for this. I also read while looking for a link to stream this that they are canceling this show after the season ends. I Effing love this portayal of the Anvengers! They need to give it a better time slot like after school or saturday and not during church hours. Maybe even a dif channel than Disney XD. The Dis Chan is offered more on basic cable and in HD. But anyway I'm sure this is 10/10 A/V cause it always is. Just if anyway possible can it be a priority on Sundays cuz i dont have the option of watching as i'm sure others can't either and i litteraly was refreash crazy. haha. but seriously props man."
