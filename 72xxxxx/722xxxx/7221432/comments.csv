And a special thanks for uploading in AVI format, i am so sick of searching through MP4's for something that will play on my DVD... some of us have big screen TV's that we like to use."
,Occultslayer,2012-05-05T23:34Z,thx!!! :D
,upgradeyourshit,2012-05-14T02:50Z,"PBR-Streetgang, avi is a super old format and sucks balls. MP4 is the new wave man. Upgrade your shit. I have a 52 inch flatscreen and I use MP4 threw my PS3 and my WD TV live. Your DVD player is obviously super old. I'm sick of everyone bitching about MP4s. They are a superior format. Get used to it."
,upgradeyourshit,2012-05-14T02:51Z,"Not to mention your moronic comment about ""some of us have big screen TVs.."" No shit sherlock. So you download shit quality AVIs for that. MP4 and MKV and HD. Stop bitching about no AVIs and get a device that can properly utilize your so called ""Big Screen TV"""
