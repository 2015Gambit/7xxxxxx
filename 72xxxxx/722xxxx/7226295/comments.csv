Flipping homes has never been an easy business, and since the collapse of the housing market it's never been more dangerous. Time is the new enemy as flippers race to rehabilitate properties before renovation costs climb too high and market prices fall too low. This is the type of risk that attracts Russell Hantz, the Master Manipulator from three seasons of ""Survivor,"" where bold moves can make or break you, and the dollar bill is the bottom line.
