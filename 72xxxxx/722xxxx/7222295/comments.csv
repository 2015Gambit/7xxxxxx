,socalpapi16,2012-05-01T07:39Z,I just seeded over 30GB from two different locations. What sucks is I tried to be helpful and leechers took it and then didn't seed. Thanks for contributing for the community arseholes!

What's the year of your Ridgeline, Socalpapi16 ?"
,david626cc,2012-05-18T09:54Z,"Can this just be burned to DL DVD or does it need any of the other special methods that other 4.A2 torrents need? I downloaded and burned to disk but the disk would read in my Acura TL 2007. 
I know I'm burning correctly as the 4.92 works just fine. 
thanks"
