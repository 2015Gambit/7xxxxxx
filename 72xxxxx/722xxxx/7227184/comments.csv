P.S : 50 MB size is optimal imo"

,OldSchoolboy,2012-05-05T08:49Z,"Vitamin_X,Don't Listen to masternik. People who have slow internet like me will want to have HQ Videos in such small sizes. I Still Want 30mb to 40mb Videos,like you've Uploaded before. One can find 50mb or higher videos anywhere, And by the way I Prefer M4A 128Kb/s rather than mp3 320Kb/s. Keep up your Good Work...."
