MaSu is my all-time favorite band, hands down. Their sound, lyrics, vocals...everything just oozes awesome--especially when I listen in FLAC--right into my ear holes. I'm uploading this here so everyone else can have awesome oozed into their ear holes, too.

From Wikipedia:
Machinae Supremacy is a Swedish band that combines modern heavy metal and alternative rock with chiptunes. Self-defined as "SID metal", many of their songs use a SidStation that features the SID chip of the Commodore 64. They have released a considerable number of songs for free download on their site, 32 original recordings, with approximately 100,000 downloads a month.

This torrent includes every studio album released by the band from 2005 through 2010, all in glorious FLAC. To me, the term "discography" refers specifically to albums released on disc. I'll be uploading their webography in a separate torrent later, if I get a positive response for this one.

FROM THE BAND on Reddit:
"Sharing is caring. And don't be selfish. Seed what you leech."

Enjoy. m/
