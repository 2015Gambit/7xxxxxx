From the album information (backside):
* These particular selections have been re-arranged in order to accomodate all 33 pieces onto one double album.

Well, I guess that´s what they call artistic freedom. But strangly enough, Ravel´s Bolero is not indicated to have been re-arranged, despite the fact that the time for the piece here is 5:20. Ravel himself said that the piece lasts 17 minutes.

Anyway, this is yet one example of how classical music can be interpretated in different ways, depending on the performing artist.
So, enjoy and compare.
