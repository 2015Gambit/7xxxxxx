
A crossover of two of Moonstone's most popular titles, bringing together two markedly contrasting fictional investigators from two different eras--Victorian England and early 1970's USA--and from two different media: book and television. Mythological birds, a British historical criminal, Sherlock Holmes, and Kolchak. As unlikely a team-up as only Joe Gentile can make it happen, but with seamless, thoroughly enjoyable results. That's me speaking.
