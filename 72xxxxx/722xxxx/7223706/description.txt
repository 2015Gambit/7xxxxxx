Future Weapons Season 3
Mack goes the extra mile to track down the new weapons and defense systems taking their place in the world's arsenal to deal with the changing missions of 21st-century warfare. There's still plenty of firepower, but you'll get an inside look at many of the breakthrough technologies designed to take on the challenges of terrorism, bomb threats, and close combat urban battlefields.


1)  Firepower 
In this action-packed opener, Mack gives us an exclusive look inside the secret device that uses water power to tear apart terrorist bombs. Next he travels to New Mexico to try out a new squad weapon that might just be your best friend in an ambush. In Sweden, Mack pays a visit to a military test range to get an up-close look at the latest surface-to-air missile. And finally Mack goes back to his roots in Florida to size up the US Army's newest sniper rifle.
