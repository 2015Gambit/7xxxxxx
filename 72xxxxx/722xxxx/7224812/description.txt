It is important not to judge the teachings of Islam
based upon the actions of some Muslims. Like every
other community there are a few 'bad apples' and
it is unfortunate that the media sometimes focuses on these 
individuals in the Muslim community.

    If you are seeking real Truth and Salvation like many 
others before you, give Islam a try.
