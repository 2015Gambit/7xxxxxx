NOTES:

Right video was poor if honest ...AR look wrong,some camera movement,LOADS of noise and worse thing ...bloody auto focus issues.
Audio was nice,but needed some lovin,but was clear and easy too hear.

Video we changed the res,used a HQ smoother,had too remove loads of chroma as the video couldn't handle it.....now looks black and white in parts,but which certain things still full of colour ....pass maybe its meant too be like that lol.
Auto focus wrecks this too be honest with and theres nothing we can do about that ...

Audio cleaned and remastered and then syncd too our encode ....seems in sync but due too the auto focus was hard too guess in parts,but think we did it ;-)
