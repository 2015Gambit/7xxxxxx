I use a Transfer Cap and upload 7 gigs a day. This is why I upload a new torrent every other day or so. I do this to keep my IP off my back as they have initiated a monthly limit. It usually takes me two days to fully seed a torrent so please be patient.

SYNOPSIS:  
When Maggie Gilkesons (Cate Blanchett) oldest daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) is abducted by a witch doctor turned bandit, Maggie enlists her estranged fathers (Tommy Lee Jones) help to find her. But they soon discover that other girls have gone missing -- and that times running out. Father and daughter reunite for a battle even larger than the one they wage against each other in this suspenseful drama helmed by Oscar-winner Ron Howard.

I upload my torrents to The Pirate Bay and Demonoid, if you would like to upload one of my torrent files to another tracker feel free, all I ask is that you upload the same torrent file you downloaded by clicking on one of my links so that more seeders/peers are in the swarm.
