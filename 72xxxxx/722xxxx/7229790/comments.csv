Copy current files to another folder. then delete existing torrent

Use 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7026027/Balls_of_Steel_COMPLETE_Season_1._All_10_Episodes.


start torrent then stop after all files show in new folder, maybe 2 minutes max

Then copy each name and replace with corisponding file from the 1st torrent that you moved.

Force re check in bit torrent then your away

so game that uploader does shit like this . .  nz has small broadband deals so every gig is important"
