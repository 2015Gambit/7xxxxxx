STFU
We are not stupid and don't apreciate the insult to intelligence with your sad pathetic little ploy.. do us all a favor and go get your self a better hobby / job, idiots

Oh and by the way, if you click the number 2 where it says ""Files"" it shows you this torrent contains a .txt file and an .avi file so care to explain to me how a text file or an avi container is going to a prompt a pc user for a password ?

lol get off the internet morons or stfu"
