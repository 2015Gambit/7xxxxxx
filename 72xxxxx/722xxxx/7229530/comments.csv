Fake? lol  why you hating 

@MrStarz
This has no audio sync issues (the other non 3D version did, but is fixed now)

This version is 3D HSBS and perfectly in sync"

,la_cross37,2012-08-15T16:43Z,"Hi, I'm pretty new to downloading 3D movies since I only just bought an 3D TV. The only 3D movie I've downloaded so far is Avatar and it worked great. But I have a question, what is the difference between ""HSBS"" and ""Stereoscopic Side by Side"". The Avatar movie I downloaded was ""Stereoscopic Side by Side"" and I just merged the two images together and switched L-R to R-L or something like that, it might have been the opposite. I've tried goggling HSBS 3D but didn't find anything useful.

I'm thankful for any information :)"
