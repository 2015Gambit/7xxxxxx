Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 64 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum & fakes (after theyve been online at least 60mins)  thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "

,TrashCompaqtor,2012-05-10T02:15Z,"I've 100% confirmed that this is NOT the director's cut.  I wasted my time watching the entire movie waiting to see what is new, yet there is nothing!  Yes, I'm leaving my comment in the correct place... This is a mislabeled copy!  Despite the seemingly longer run time - which means nothing - this is the theatrical version.   This copy's length is 1:29:31.  It's stated as 1h 33m in the nfo, which is wrong.  The 1080p by 26K lists the correct time in its nfo but that copy is also mislabeled as director's cut."
,TrashCompaqtor,2012-05-10T02:22Z,"I just wrote a comment to confirm this is 100% the theatrical version; NOT the director's cut!  My comment suddenly vanished, so here it is again.  The runtime of this is 1:29:31."
,wolfballz,2012-05-18T04:05Z,So I'm dling this thing now... is it the full movie or not?

It is not incorrectly labeled, its not labeled as a Directors Cut, DC means Digtal Copy. Sucks that you wasted your time, but don't blame the uploaders for your stupidity"

,markyyy999,2012-05-23T03:25Z,thanks for this!!!

Are you for real? You didn't just say that DC stands for Digital Copy, did you? hahah

and btw, TrashCompaqtor, if the runtime of this release is 1:29:31 which equals to 89min, then, according to the information on IMDb, this is the ""Director's Cut"".
The Theatrical version runs only for 84min. You can see the differences here: http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=637736"
