I want everyone to know that hanging from a pull-up bar for about 8 sessions of 30-60 seconds a day, three days a week (spread apart evenly on two week patterns), made me grow an inch in 5 weeks.

I didn't know it was going to, so it took me by surprise. I was just up there doing ab workouts. Imagine adding a safe amount of weight to that. (I did all of my height growing years ago so that's not it.)

I recently read an article that stated 10 minute hanging sessions from a pull-up bar a day will help. Although let me tell you, if you're gonna do that, do it every other day maximum, 'cause if you injure a shoulder (which happens to even the strongest, most roided up men), you're fucked bud."
