Tech:
Video: RUSSiAN [thx!]
Audio: UnKnOwN [thx!]

Ok, this one was a tough biatch.
UnKnOwN`s audio, as usually, had like 100 cuts [seriously, dude, wtf?].
It`s definitely watchable and pretty much synced for such shitty audio.
Oh, audio quality is like 5/10 for me, not the best line you might have heard but better that than nothing.
Check sample.
Hopefully someone will get full line with much better quality, but for now, here it is.
If you can do it better - stop moaning and DO IT.
