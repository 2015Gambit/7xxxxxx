,1-1-11,2012-04-29T08:04Z,"I am going to have to say this is fake I have been stuck at 97.2% for over 12 hrs now and everybody in my peer list is also stuck at 97.2%.
So anybody looking to download save your bandwidth and look elsewhere because you wont get it from here."
,Revoli,2012-04-29T12:41Z,"Has to be a fake or something is really wrong with this torrent. I, like everyone else, has been stuck at 97,2 for forever."
,joostinus,2012-04-29T23:45Z,"The torrent is good.  Just skip the ""Sample"" and the ""Read this guide first.txt"".  Those are the missing 2.8%.  The actual episode works flawlessly."
,Shamshel,2012-04-30T00:36Z,"Thanks for the heads up joostinus, I didn't notice that."
,DTake2012,2012-04-30T05:03Z,"Like joostinus said, the episode works fine. Just ignore all the other files besides the main video file."
