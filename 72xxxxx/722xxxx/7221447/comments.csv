,resmith,2012-05-06T05:19Z,A V are perfect. Been watching it on my xbox without any problems or sync problems. If you find the quality not to your liking try burning it onto a DVD with convertx2DVD which will make a 700 mb file into a 4.3 gb.

If you've seen the theatrical release then you'll notice that there's nothing different.... so, this is a 'fake'"

Nowhere did the uploader mention that this is a Directors Cut. 

DC in the title clearly stands for Digital Copy"
