Climate catastrophe? The end of civilization as we know it? Are the current staggeringly expensive actions now being considered really helping to save the world - or are we just burning money? In this "eye-opening" (Los Angeles Times) documentary, author Bjorn Lomborg ("The Skeptical Environmentalist") asks us to question the facts and the solutions. Why in the world are we spending so much money on "green" initiatives for such little gain? Are there better ways to solve the problems? How else could that money be spent? No matter what our opinions are on the environmental movement, Cool It is an "engrossing" film (The New York Times) that asks us to rethink our polarized views. After all, nothing less than the planet is at stake.
