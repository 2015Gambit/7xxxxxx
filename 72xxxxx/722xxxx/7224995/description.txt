Over the last couple of years I have been downloading everything Stephen King. Last week I realized I had about 1 GIG of his books and I then decided that it was time to sort through them. I selected the best of all the copies of each book I had.


There are some classics missing - such as Cell and The Shining - It is because the copies I found were missing chapters or were badly formatted. 

So I'd now like to share my personal collection - here it is - the best I could find of Stephen King

Thank you to the original uploaders.
