[T],eXPer1ence,2012-04-27T19:51Z,Thanks. Anyone know why there is a 3 week gap between episode 21 and 22? What was shown on TV on April 13th and April 20th in place of The Big Bang Theory? The US is weird. I thought the series had ended. It probably has now with 22 episodes. Leaving it 3 weeks before showing the last episode is just ridiculous to me.
,toadbomb,2012-04-27T21:08Z,"@eXPer1ence

I have no idea why the gap, but if you want to keep up to date with when shows will air, use something like: http://www.episodeworld.com/show/Big_Bang_Theory

As you can see there will be another episode of this season aired on May 3rd, which will be the last of the season. I regularly use episodeworld as a guide to know when to look for the next episode of shows. :)"

,AxBattler,2012-04-28T10:01Z,"This show was one of my favorites. Now I watch it mainly bcause of inertia.
It became bad and dull, and this is one of the weakest episodes ever. They are not geeks anymore, they are just ugly."
,arielmercoledi,2012-04-28T11:26Z,"harsh words, AxBattler.

thanks once again, [eztv] - i mean to comment every time but i forget. i'm going to stop forgetting from now on.

,GamingIndustryBlows,2012-04-28T22:22Z,"Another shitty episode from another show going downhill. This actually used to be a funny show until they started doing the whole drama/relationship bullshit. 

Thought this was a comedy about nerds? Not any more!"
,a_r_s_e_n_a_l_1,2012-04-29T22:12Z,thanks
,dexamp60,2012-04-29T22:26Z,thnx
,Zellonous,2012-04-30T02:51Z,"@GamingIndustryBlows

says u.

And besides... that relationship drama bullshit has been there since the beginning. I can't believe a show could be going downhill when it still has millions of viewers. As a matter of fact, it has had increasingly more since it's premiere. You don't know what you're talking about. Fuckin' thing has been renewed for shows til 2014. Downhill? No."
,Lemonyade,2012-04-30T06:11Z,"what do you use to watch this? ""vuze"" says torrent is to big and ""windows media player"" doesn't show the picture "
,Zellonous,2012-04-30T06:45Z,"@ Lemonyade

In Windows I always used KMPlayer. I've never used VLC, but I hear it's good too.

This link goes to a site that reviews many freeware programs (in this case, a media player). One of the players listed is bound to do good by you."
,b0bbie,2012-04-30T17:07Z,"agreed, fucking drama...
is this the deal going down in USA, WHO THE DUCK cares what happened before you met someone.

,lolisnopp1,2012-05-22T19:20Z,"@ Zellonous

Viewer count doesn't have anything to do with the quality of a show. Just look at Twilight and Grey's Anatomy both are pure shit and they still got a ton of viewers, and because they got a ton of viewers, the companies are going to continue milking the shows, just like big bang theory.

And great torrent as always eztv"
