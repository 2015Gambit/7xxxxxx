But the war was necessary to keep the Zionist jew bankers rich in war funding; give them an excuse to steal Palestine to create APARTHEID israel; and keep the US economy going.

Hitler should have forgotten about Russia and concentrated on destroying the true Evil Empire, England. Although, that is what happened in the end anyway, and now Germany once again controls Europe."
,phillipm,2012-05-01T03:32Z,"zakimar, the case the book makes is that ALL sides made terrible and unnecessary policy decisions that thrust their nations into a war that never would've happened otherwise. No, the problem wasn't that Hitler attacked Stalin, it's that England, in a masterstroke of stupidity, decided to commit their people to war on behalf of Poland.

The war SHOULD'VE been between Germany and USSR as Hitler envisioned. He wanted no fight with the British, whom he respected and hoped to ally himself with someday. Had England not committed its fatal blunder of the Polish war guarantee, the two great socialist dictators would've had at each other till they both spent each other out. The Cold War never would've been, and MILLIONS of lives would've been spared.

For you skeptics out there, just read the book first. I think you'll find the case it makes through exhaustive quotation and document citing, almost irrefutable. "

But England wanted war with Germany out of jealousy and greed. Jealousy that Germany was once again becoming the strongest country in Europe, and greed that their ""Treaty"" of Versailles could no longer suck Germany dry and enrich the parasitic English. "
