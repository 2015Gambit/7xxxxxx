,splinter48708,2012-07-15T08:07Z,"FYI:  Avast! and others will always ping on a keygen as a virus.  The best way to handle this if you are concerned is to run the keygen in a sandbox.  IIRC, Avast! has that option.  This way, on the odd chance that the program is actually infected, there is zero probability of it spreading through your system."
