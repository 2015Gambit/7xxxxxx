Buried In Verona's Debut Album (I consider Circle The Dead more of an EP)

This is here so you cheap skates can get a taste of BIV's seed of heaviness before your purchase their new fucking album.

Buy their new single now, they're Australian and the best blokes ever!

Their new album is called 'Notorious', and will be released and I will not upload it, SO BUY IT AND SUPPORT AUSSIE MUSIC AND THE BEST BLOKES EVER. 

They are touring Australia after the release of the new album, so you should come pay $20, mosh hard and destroy some little scene faggots, of which there is hopefully none.

PRE-ORDER THEIR ALBUM IF YOU WANNA FROM JB Hi-Fi OR THE WE ARE UNIFIED WEBSITE, WHICH IS THEIR RECORD LABEL.

PEACE EVERYONE.
