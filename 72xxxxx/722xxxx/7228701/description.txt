This ***DOES CONTAIN COMMERCIALS*** and was encoded by the CARG..................................................................................................................................................................................................The 9th race of the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series the Capital City 400 presented by Virginia is for Lovers took place on a Saturday 04/28/2012. Pole winner Mark Martin leads the field to the green flag on the 0.75 mi (1.2 km) asphalt D-Shaped Oval in Henrico County, Virginia. Richmond International Raceway opened in 1946 and started hosting NASCAR in 1953 and seats approx. 97,912 race fans. Richmond International Raceway is one of a few race tracks to host all of its events under the lights. The track sold out 33 consecutive NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races. The sellout streak ended in September 2008 partially due to the economic downturn, though the major factor in ticket sales was the impact of Tropical Storm Hanna.
 
Richmond has hosted the final "regular-season" race, leading up to the start of the Chase for the Sprint Cup, each year since the Chase concept was introduced in 2004. The race is often referred to as "One Last Race to Make The Chase."
 
In 2010, Richmond International Raceway introduced a state-of-the-art Video Scoring Tower that boasts more LED square footage than any other in the motorsports industry. The cap features four high definition LED screens that measure 38-feet wide by 24-feet high. The screens broadcast live race action and pre-produced video and graphics. The stem shows running order and has the ability to rotate through the entire field.
