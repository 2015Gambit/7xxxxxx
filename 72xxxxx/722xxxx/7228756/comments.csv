,darkizzle,2012-04-30T05:45Z,Oh man it was a shame that Sansa had to die and so painfully! But what could they do Robb had captured Joffrey and Cersei is a crazy bitch without her kids! At least now Joff is sharing a cell with Jaime I cant wait until he finds that he's his real father! It happened in the book so it should be in the next episode! And then that shadow baby killed Loras oh my god I was so sad when Renly started crying and Margaery tried to comfort him! Best episode of the series spillers!
,tetnem,2012-04-30T06:03Z,"You idiot. It not necessarily to tell us what's happening in the episode. thanks anyway, eztv! "
,warutaru,2012-04-30T06:03Z,"@darkizzle 

Lol, I love your spoilers man. Keep them up :D "
,Vegeta9021,2012-04-30T06:04Z,"LMFAO , you're such a DUMB ASS darkizzle, at least read the books

and learn to SPOILER IT CORRECTLY, YOU FUCKING RETARD. THOSE ARE NOT EVEN THE CORRECT SPOILERS, I READ THE BOOKS.

YOU just embarrassed YOURSELF BAHAHAHAHAHAA

What a DUMB ASS, how does it feel to feel like a DUMB ASS?"
,Webberjo,2012-04-30T06:04Z,"Second, woo! Thanks, torrenting immediately!"
,powers987,2012-04-30T06:19Z,"darkizzle is back at it again. I'm sure before long people will know his troll by name, and then we can move on with our lives."
,DemosCat,2012-04-30T06:21Z,"darkizzle,

You forgot the part where Daenerys is shocked to discover her starving people ate her baby dragons while crossing the red desert, dashing all her plans to take over Westeros.

:)"
,Ludio,2012-04-30T06:32Z,"@Vegeta9021 they are fake spoilers on purpose, his intent is to make people think wtf? and then they watch it and it's not as he says. he's not spoiling anything, just messing around. you sir, are the DUMB ass for thinking he's serious"
,sconathon,2012-04-30T06:35Z,"@vegeta9021

,Ludio,2012-04-30T07:42Z,"at this moment, this version(720p) has a seed to leech ratio of 1:8, the regular is 1:5... if ya just want to watch, better bet is regular. you selfish people need to share and not lower max up to like 1k. get peerblock or something if ya scared about ap2p"
,Ludio,2012-04-30T07:50Z,"@vegeta sir, there is no need to get hostile. i was not rude. an example of being so would be like me saying how shocked i am that someone of your intelligence level can read. next time you bash someone, at least make sure you get it right or accept the fact people are going to laugh at you for being a troll."
,Blodderz,2012-04-30T08:57Z,I hate the little fucking cunts who have nothing better than to throw cheap insults. If you can't say it to their face in person don't fuckin bother! Get yourself a fuckin hobby like smashing the granny out a nice bird instead of lickin your granny out and pleasuring your pet with your animal husbandry skills!
,Froglet,2012-04-30T10:04Z,"You do know that darkizzle is just winding you up don't you? Sansa dying? Joff in the same cell? Bullshit. 

I have read all of the books, and I assure you that darkizzle's just having a laugh."
