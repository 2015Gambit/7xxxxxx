Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, April 27 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Laura Pressley in-studio. Laura is running for Austin City Council. She is the co-founder of an Austin, Texas based company that provides clean, pure, fluoride-free and chemical-free drinking water. Pressley worked in the semiconductor industry and has been involved in a number of volunteer activities, including serving on several Austin non-profit boards. 

Alex also covers the latest news, including efforts to roll back the Second Amendment in Florida and the continuing and growing revolt against the TSA and its serial abuses against the American people.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
