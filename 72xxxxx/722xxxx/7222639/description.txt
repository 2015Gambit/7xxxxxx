Rowing the Arctic

Travel Documentary hosted by Mark Beaumont, published by BBC in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Scots adventurer Mark Beaumont (The Man who Cycled the Americas) joins polar veteran Jock Wishart on an expedition to row a boat to the 1996 north magnetic pole, a point only ever reached across solid ice. In their tiny boat, the six-man team navigate some of the world's most remote seaways, taking on fast-flowing sea ice that could crush their boat and roaming polar bears. Nobody has ever rowed so far into the Canadian high Arctic - a first in the world of exploration and adventure, only made possible by the dramatic retreat of arctic sea ice in recent decades.
