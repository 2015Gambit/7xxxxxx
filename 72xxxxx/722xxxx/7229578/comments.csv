,tor12,2012-04-30T17:46Z,"The ep is called ""how big, how far, how fast"". As you might have understood, it's about the size, distances and speeds in the universe.  "
,Masleyko,2012-05-10T22:07Z,"According to imdb.com its S06E08 - how big, how far, how fast"
,Speechless1998,2012-05-22T15:13Z,"How big, how far, how fast 
...is in fact S06E08
There will be one more episode this season called ""Alien Sounds"" - S06E09
Also... if anyone has an episode 04 this season called ""The Moon"" ...it is a mistake from S01.
S06E04 is ""Crash Landing on Mars"" - most know this by now but just in case."
