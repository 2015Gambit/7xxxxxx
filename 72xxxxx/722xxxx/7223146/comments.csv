10 = Blue ray quality

Don't make your first time watching this film a cam experience and then bitch about quality."
,smokie_tonto_420,2012-05-13T05:57Z,"Seriously people... get off your ass and go see this movie. It is worth the money (even though it is high)...3d isnt anything special, so i wouldnt say GO SEE THAT ONE... but thats your choice. But this is a bad ass movie. Thanx for the up. Already seen it twice and gonna download also."
,Angry_Australian,2012-05-13T10:18Z,mate you may as well have been moaning while pullin your dick the whole time cause eating a bag of chips while recording & planning to upload/share isnt cool. 
,manulush,2012-05-13T11:59Z,A: V: anyone?
,jjc09081989,2012-05-13T14:35Z,Lmao I understand this is a bootleg but next time try not eating so much if you want to make a good copy of movies. Hard to get into this when every ten seconds you hear a bag crinkling. 
,KeroLoL,2012-05-13T16:40Z,"Overrated as fuck, just another hollywood blockbuster."
,uneven78,2012-05-13T17:28Z,"Definitely worth it to go see this movie.  I saw it in IMAX 3D because I thought there would be a lot of cool 3D stuff.  The IMAX was awesome, not a lot of 3D though.  If you're going to see a movie this year and you like comics or even just action movies check this one out!"
,excelguy,2012-05-13T18:28Z,Thanks but awful quality. Not watchable. Wait for blurayrip.

,Fritz.,2012-05-14T04:21Z,"ill wait for a dvd rip to pirate, i will not go to a theater and pay full price until this country gets a handle on the economy.

pretty people who do nothing important with their lives worth 100 million or more while professions like teaching that are integral to our continuation and advancement as a species are underpaid?

ill wait until i can pirate it, thanks tho."

,TimWithaT,2012-05-14T19:13Z,"@irelia011 Sorry, but you are such a retard.. The quality rate is decided by how watchable it is FOR the type of video.. 
If a TS is VERY Good the rate is given on the quality it can reach.

,Wybe,2012-05-14T22:20Z,"@Fritz, I agree with your motivation but refusing to trade because the economy is on its ass is a bit contradictionary"

No, YOU'RE a fucking retard. If the scale changes per person and per video type then it is useless. That has and always will be the scale because it MAKES SENSE."
