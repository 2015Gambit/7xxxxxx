Jazz icon Louis Armstrong, always the consummate entertainer, turned a 1971 award ceremony at the National Press Club in Washington DC into an impromptu performanceΓÇödespite recent poor health. It was one of his last concerts before he passed away 5 months later. Joined by longtime band-mates Tyree Glenn and Tommy Gwaltney, Armstrong shows no signs of frailty while singing, and to everyoneΓÇÖs surprise, playing trumpet on classics including ΓÇ£Mack the KnifeΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Rocking Chair.ΓÇ¥ The recording was originally a limited vinyl release by the National Press Club in 1972. Armstrong often signed letters ΓÇ£Red Beans and Rice-ly Yours,ΓÇ¥ which makes for an apt title for the recording especially since his favorite recipesΓÇöeverything from Louisiana Caviar to the SazeracΓÇöare included in the liner notes, as they were in the original pressing. 11 tracks, 58 minutes.

This recording was produced in collaboration with The National Press Club and The Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation.
