,gentoosiast,2012-04-30T13:32Z,Please someone provide a text listing of books in this torrent. Are there many retail ebooks not available everything else?
,senseinai,2012-04-30T15:31Z,It's ridiculous to put files here this way ... It could take forever to download and then turn out to be another password scam.
,nevermore366,2012-04-30T17:12Z,"I can 100% guarantee there is no password. If there is, you can have my scrotum"
,ozky666,2012-04-30T20:09Z,"Sorry mate, but I am not downloading your 13 Gig calibre.rar file not knowing what's in it!
Too bad, as you said."
,rostbif,2012-04-30T20:18Z,"Hello nevermore366, please post a list of the contents of the archive? Thanks"
,majbe27,2012-04-30T20:33Z,"probably free arc.
it's been a while since somebody last uploaded it."
,majbe27,2012-04-30T20:38Z,another thing is what possible use would we have for your scrotum?
,raindr0ps,2012-05-01T00:30Z,This is his only torrent. Why do I smell scam? And why would anyone upload an archive this big? Hard to believe anyone would want all of this losers 12000 books. What's wrong with creating a torrent with just the books...no archive? Thanks but no thanks.
,nevermore366,2012-05-01T05:04Z,How do I create a list of all the books from inside calibre?
,gentoosiast,2012-05-01T08:11Z,"nevermore366,

Press downward arrow right of the button ""Convert Books"" and select menu option ""Create a catalog of the books in your calibre library"". Then upload resulting file to any filehosting and post link here"
,nevermore366,2012-05-01T14:31Z,"I just did author title isbn in the output.

"
,nevermore366,2012-05-01T14:31Z,Oh mah gawd it wont let me submit the link. It's at filedropper dot com slash mybooks
,gentoosiast,2012-05-01T18:03Z,"Thanks for the books, looks like many interesting titles. Downloading now."
,rngtrk,2012-05-03T20:58Z,"Please don't distribute files as .rar files. BitTorrent has many technical advantages that make .rar bundling not needed. It also has the disadvantage that people can't see what files are in there (as other comments say), and it also means that someone has to download *all* the 13GB. If you keep it as separate files, then people can download individual files from within your torrent.

Consider resubmitting this as a folder of files."
,monster.x,2012-05-10T14:25Z,"i am guessing you took 3 or four kindle torrents and combined them in a big library without regard of their quality or consistency, right? there are some titles as authors (and vice versa), which is from the pdf-library, right? there are duplicates, which calibre didnt catch.
in my estimate about half the books in this collection have such poor quality that reading would cause more trouble than enjoyment. i had the same troubles with other libraries as well. especially the pdf-collections, which were piss-poor quality :("
,nevermore366,2012-05-15T17:24Z,"No, I have collected this over the past year from thebooksbay.org, librarypirate.me, and TPB, and have made every effort to make sure the books have proper metadata and there are few if any duplicates. Calibre usually catches that as you are adding them. "
,Pagan8,2012-07-14T13:29Z,Maybe he's putting his scrotum out there to use as a kindle carry bag?
,johnas14,2012-07-22T00:56Z,Would have been better if uploaded in their original files not collectively in a compressed format so we can choose which to download.
,IFuck_JT,2012-07-22T15:11Z,"Stop complaining, take them or leave them, ffs."
