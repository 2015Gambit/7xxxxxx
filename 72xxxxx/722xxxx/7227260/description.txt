THIS IS NOT THE COMPLETE DISCOGRAPHY OBVIOUSLY FROM THE FILE SIZE

There are plenty of them on here already, these are extras and additional songs

The quality is what it is, most of them are 192kbps

Some of the original source files were pretty crap and have been fixed as best as I could do, but feel free to do what you like with them

And Anyman does have some skipping from 00:26 ΓÇô 0:33 so don't comment on it

The quality is pretty good overall and just trying to give back to TPB seen I take so much :-)

My upload speed on ADSL 2+ from Australia is shit throttled at around 100kbs/s, so it will be slow until people from overseas get on it
