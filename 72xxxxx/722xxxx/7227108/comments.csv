PowerISO can open images (compatible with a score of formats), edit, compress, encrypt and of course, create an image.

As for the creation, PowerISO creates images in typical ISO and BIN, but also one of the few programs that is also able to create DDA format. The rear features 'advanced' as compression, password protection and file split into smaller parts.

In addition, to complete the 'supply' of features, PowerISO has a utility to burn images to CD / DVD, another to convert images from one format to another, and finally, a utility to 'mount' the images created in a virtual drive as if it were a CD recorded.
