,godofwrath08,2012-04-28T20:54Z,does the keyboard bindings work with this release coz they dint on the skidrow release i had to use a game pad :/
,klord2010,2012-04-29T07:14Z,"@godofwrath08
Just hover your mouse cursor on the button (don't press) and press any key you want to bind. Yeah, it's tricky. Even if you choose keyboard control it shows you gamepad button in-game. Shame on SEGA."
,widek,2012-04-29T10:50Z,"guys i have a problem. when press setup, it ask me (do you want to allow the following program from an unknown publisher to make changes), when i press yes.nothing happens.help plz"

,Gnob77,2012-04-29T18:59Z,"If you scroll to the bottom of the control settings, you can switch it from Xbox to keyboard, then it will show the keyboard settings in game. I however, cannot get my mouse to function right and w/s will not go up down, very broken so far, gonna try reinstalling."
,klord2010,2012-04-30T04:33Z,"@Gnob77
Ah ha, I overlook that part. Thanks. Gonna play again. :D"
,3Dazz,2012-04-30T12:27Z,"This game is in the wrong section, its obviously an xbox 360 port, but it does'nt even work properly with an xbox controller either. And I cant find the section where your supposedly able to reassign the inputs. If its a pc game, you should'nt need to reassign unless you like a different setup than the usual wasd."
,amerpirat,2012-04-30T17:13Z,configuration file not found please run the configuration tool
,3Dazz,2012-05-01T14:19Z,"Ok call me a dumbass, I figured it out. Right click on the exe and open file location, run the configuration app as admin, and down the bottom change xbox controller to Keyboard and SAVE. Dont know why a pc game is defaulted to an xbox controller, but it is. Follow these steps and it works just fine."
