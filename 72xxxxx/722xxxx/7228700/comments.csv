Also many thanks to this uploader as I was able to get 99.6% off him from the start, rewrite the ID3 tags and fix audo glitches and host my own.

Don't get me wrong, both of these torrents (mine and this uploader's) should be as good as each others'.

Always seed! Their music is awesome!"

My thanks, I removed the torrent to ensure the files were properly tagged and of sufficient quality, and have since re-uploaded the torrent.
