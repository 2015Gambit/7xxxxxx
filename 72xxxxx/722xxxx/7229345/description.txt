Computer Architecture - A Quantitative Approach
John L. Hennessy
David A. Patterson
4th Edition

Through four editions of this book, our goal has been to describe the basic principles underlying what will be tomorrowΓÇÖs technological developments.
...
As with earlier versions, we have strived to produce a new edition that will
continue to be as relevant for professional engineers and architects as it is for
those involved in advanced computer architecture and design courses. As much
as its predecessors, this edition aims to demystify computer architecture through
an emphasis on cost-performance-power trade-offs and good engineering design.
