QUICK STRESS BUSTERS
WHAT IS MULTI┬¡ΓÇÉEVOCATION?

In this busy world of traffic jams, deadlines, and unresolved conflicts, we need all our resources. Multi┬¡ΓÇÉEvocation Hypnotic Cassettes help you find a calm center in a spinning world and expand the vast resources of your unconscious mind to new horizons, new dimensions of fulfillment. Multi┬¡ΓÇÉEvocation cassettes are so effective because of new and unique methods of learning.
Each tape features:

Ericksonian Hypnosis ΓÇôalso called "the new hypnosis", based on the pioneering work of Dr. Milton H. Erickson. This style of hypnosis is gentle, open┬¡ΓÇÉended, and indirect. The hypnotic messages and suggestions are offered in a way that evokes powerful unconscious resources, yet is respectful of your individuality.

Multiple Voices ΓÇôeach Multi┬¡ΓÇÉEvocation cassette features at least two voices speaking simultaneously during hypnosis. This is an innovative method which works especially well for rapid, easy trance induction and to help the analytical thinking mind to let go.

Metaphorical Environments ΓÇôResearch has shown that the language of the unconscious is primarily metaphorical. MultiΓÇÉEvocation uses metaphor in a directed fashion to evoke and support the positive changes and results of each tape.

Special Effects ΓÇôthe cassettes also use music, advanced psychoΓÇÉacoustic techniques, and stateΓÇÉof┬¡ΓÇÉtheΓÇÉart special effects to deepen the reality of your hypnotic experience. Some of Changeworks cassettes also feature 3ΓÇÉdimensional soundΓÇÉspecially processed effects that sound like they are actually happening in your presence.
