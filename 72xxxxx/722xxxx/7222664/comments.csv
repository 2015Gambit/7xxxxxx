,NonyxGel,2012-04-28T05:42Z,"I'm a huge PC RPG junkie. I've played just about every RPG made for the PC in the last 15 years. I really enjoyed Risen. Sometimes the little-known titles go underappreciated. Risen was a solid RPG. I've seen the Gothic series mentioned here. The first two Gothic editions were also superb. Risen reminds me of one of the best RPGs I've ever played - the extremely underrated Two World II.

I already bought Risen 2 because I have no doubt that I will enjoy it. I'm really looking forward to Two Worlds III. These are RPGs that put the fun back into RPG again. Support them!"

TPB uses Magnet links, not torrent files. Magnet links contain a hash of the files included and use what is know as DHT to find the files and the people hosting them.

This means you have to start the torrent client downloading and just let it go for a while before it finds the people hosting the files and then queries them for the actual file information.

After that it writes the files out and starts really downloading. Check the following words in Wikipedia for details:
DHT
Magnet Link"

------------ nVidia fixes -----------

If you start the game and hear the audio but do not see the game, uninstall / reinstall physX!

---------------------------------------

If you start the game and it runs INCREDIBLY slow on the main menu, uninstall your graphics drivers and reinstall the NEWEST nVidia drivers from the nVidia website!

---------------------------------------

If you run the game and it runs fine for a few minutes but then starts to run EXTREMELY slowly @ 5-15 FPS, uninstall nVidia 3D Vision Driver! It is a seperate driver from your actual graphics card driver, so do not be afraid to remove it!

I think a lot of people have been too harsh on this, as I think it's fixed a lot of 'Risen 1's problems.  Shame about the character graphics, but everything else looks great.  I'll be buying this, and hoping they add more PC specific improvements later.  (p.s. if you possess the commandant, it's quite a laugh giving Patty a hard time before you steal the ship) "
