Imdb: 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/

Plot:
Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.

Sources:
video-thnxs
audio-thnxs
subs-greek...

Notes:
the video is new much more clearer than the old video that was out but this has greek subs... which sucks..there is lot of cam movement!!.. iv had look around for a version with no subs could not find any... 

so adjusted the brightnes and colors on the video to make it look nice then rotated and cropped... the video was recorded on very backwards slant.. so had to crop out the left and right parts of the video... then muxed back the audio that was on the origanl source video... may do v2 with cropping the subs off....

added 3 samples showing the cam movement... which can cause the ar to go off... will do a v2 with no subs :)
