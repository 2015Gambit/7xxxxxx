Information
------------------------------

Once on the brink of extinction, Goshawks are now increasing even in the countryside close to Tokyo as the environment recovers. With a wingspan of over a meter, they can streak across the sky at 80 kilometers per hour, capturing doves, ducks, and other birds in the air. Now the thrilling moments of their hunts are filmed with the latest high-speed camera that can shoot 2,000 frames per second.
