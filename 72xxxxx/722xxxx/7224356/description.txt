April 1982. After Argentinian troops take control of the Falkland Islands, the British task force set sail with a heroes' send off. Robert Lawrence, an enthusiastic young officer in the Royal Scots Guards, watches jealously: as a professional soldier; he is itching to join the fray.

Four months later, Robert is recuperating from a near fatal wound he received in the vital battle for Tumbledown, a peak overlooking Port Stanley. A sniper shot has blown away a large part of his brain and left him paralysed down his left side.

Back home, Robert - a physical and emotional wreck - soon discovers a nation honouring the heroes of the war with memorial services and victory parades, is less keen to face the living victims. The authorities want him hidden away, his girlfriend leaves him and even his best friend fails to understand him.
