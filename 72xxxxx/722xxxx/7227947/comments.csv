,pxpierre,2012-04-30T03:10Z,"Thank you Regenzy1 & seeders. Be patient guys, this torrent is not fully seeded yet but Regenzy1 is a top guy, a real racing fan.

Meanwhile I downloaded in parallel the exiting on dry track with treacherous wet spots, fully seeded: Moto3.2012.Round02.Spain.Race.ONE.720p.x264-Nub http://www.demonoid.ph/files/details/2918594/008522825736/"
,pxpierre,2012-04-30T03:16Z,"I forgot to mention about moto3 on Demonoid: select the blue ""Download the torrent"", not the magnet one.

@ Regenzy1: could you do SBK 2012 also? It's much more competitive & exiting than MotoGP this year IMO. Anyway neither are available here in Central America and I'm grateful for any races you can share. Thanks again!"
,rsgibson,2012-04-30T03:30Z,Thanx so much dude for upping these races as I can't get them either - You've been my go to man for 2 years now.
,pxpierre,2012-04-30T03:43Z,"Be patient guys, this torrent is not fully seeded yet. Regenzy1 is reliable and a true racing fan.

Look under the Peers tab in your torrent client and you will see that the % is climbing regularly, proof that it's being seeded.

Don't be basterds and keep your torrent client opened after downloading so you may seed to at least a 1.00 ratio. BTW choking your upload speed DOES NOT make downloading slower, it just slows down downloading for everybody including you!"
,pxpierre,2012-04-30T03:45Z,I meant: choking your upload speed DOES NOT make downloading FASTER!
,ivanovich76,2012-04-30T04:15Z,I don't even understand how this happens.  It shows me tons of seeds but I never connect to any of them.  Are these people with throttled connections (all their upload going to some other torrent) who downloaded it?
,coolnezz,2012-04-30T08:12Z,Thanks.  Keep up the great work!
,pxpierre,2012-04-30T20:11Z,"Plenty of seeds now. BBC sports coverage, A/V/9. Thanks!
