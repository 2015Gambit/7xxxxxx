Tomáš Dvořák (*78) aka Floex - clarinetist, composer, producer and multimedia artist from Prague (Czech Republic).

While Tomáš solo works are released under his Floex moniker, the soundtracks are released under his own name Tomáš Dvořák.

From childhood he has been learning clarinet which later becomes the key instrument for his music - not only as “instrumental signature” but also as way of his compositional approach.
