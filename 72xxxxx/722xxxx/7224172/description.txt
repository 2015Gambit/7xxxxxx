Serious Sam II is the sequel to the offbeat first-person shooter, Serious Sam. You 

can explore more than 40 levels of the game, destroying more enemies than you can 

shake a stick at.

The mirth and mania that comes from a gun-toting man named Sam begin again in the 

sequel to the original Serious Sam and it's expansion, Second Encounter. The game 

still has the wild, structure-unconcerned nature that made the first two games 

such a pick-up-and-play blast, but this edition pumps up the visuals and physics 

by incredible degrees with a brand new graphics engine, as well as integrates all-

new gameplay elements for Sam to cause mayhem. The sequel allows Sam to drive 

vehicles, and the co-op mode returns for multiple players to cause even more of a 

ruckus in the game's open and enemy-filled environments.
