,digitalx,2012-04-30T03:20Z,"Outpost was far better then this movie, it set an atmosphere with silent killing Nazi zombies a good story and nothing to overboard, this movie fails right from the beginning with a heroine? who can't act, who is totally unbelievable in her role, zombies that run around roaring all the time, bad story, bad atmosphere, just plain bad! A/10 V/10 Movie 3/10"
