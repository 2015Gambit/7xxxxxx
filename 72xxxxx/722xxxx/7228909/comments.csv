[T],SecTPB,2012-04-30T10:12Z,"Audio is not in sync. If you want the audio in sync, set the audio delay to -500. That's the best I can get it. You can tune it a little more if you want. Keep in mind this is only for the Brock match. I'm not sure if the rest of the PPV is like this because I'm not watching it. Delay may change throughout the event."

,yousef86,2012-05-04T23:18Z,"A Pretty Good HDTV Rip. A/8 V/9.

The Audio in this release went out of sync twice. First during Sheamus vs Daniel Bryan match, Audio Synchronization needed to be set to -.400

Second during John Cena vs Brock Lesnar match, Audio Synchronization needed to be set at -.700.

During the end of CM Punk vs Chris Jericho match the screen froze a few times for a few seconds.

Despite this, EViLCREW Earns My +1 of Approval!"
