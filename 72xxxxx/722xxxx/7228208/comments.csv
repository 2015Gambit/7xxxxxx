,jumpingphil,2012-04-30T04:01Z,"I love Julie Covington's version of this. I loved her in the TV series Rock Follies with the extremely beautiful Rula Lenska.

Thank you very much for this."
,beaujoulais,2012-05-01T18:52Z,"thanks again ...
Lara Fabian & Sarah Brightman versions are dedicated especially to you, Zlatko, and for dehou from Argentina"
,pupovaczlatko,2012-05-01T21:57Z,"Sorry I made a little mistake 
Dehou is not only ""my"" friend
He is ""our"" friend from Argentina"
,dehou,2012-05-03T02:27Z,"hi guys! thank you all for your words and for thinking in me. the truth is that this song has a political background that i don't share, but hey! itÂ´s just a song now so thanks as always, kind regards to all!"
,pupovaczlatko,2012-05-03T10:08Z,"Hi Dehou
Sorry if I disturbed you
I am living on Other Side Of The World and
I know nothing about political situation in Argentina"
,dehou,2012-05-04T20:06Z,"pupovaczlatko, please don't worry, it's old stuff, it was just a remark, thanks again for this massive collection."
,beaujoulais,2012-05-09T07:42Z,":-) like sports music should not be a battlefield of politics, even many of the songs from the 60s and 70s focus on changing the establishment -
e.g. ""working class hero"" from Bob Dylan & John LennonÂ´
@dehou: would you please give us an idea about the problematic background of this song?"
,beaujoulais,2012-05-09T07:44Z,"Zlatko, just missing the next part of your great series ... :-)"
