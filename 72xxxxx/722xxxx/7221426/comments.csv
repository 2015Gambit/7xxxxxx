,salvistra,2012-04-27T15:16Z,"Other versions of this release can be smaller because they're zipped, but if you deselect the languages you don't need, this version is smaller."
,jstank99,2012-04-27T15:20Z,You can't deselect languages if you're using magnet link.
,Pweper,2012-04-27T15:28Z,I had to make an account to show you that there is actually a real crack out at www dot skidrowgames dot net
,freek111,2012-04-27T15:32Z,j
,CookieMunzta,2012-04-27T15:36Z,Wasn't this JUST taken down?
,salvistra,2012-04-27T15:53Z,"1. Yes, you can deselect the languages if you use the magnet link. Just deselect them after your client got the file list(in the Files tab in uTorrent).

2. I requested the other torrent to be removed because too many people complained about the crack. This torrent has no crack, so you have nothing to complain about :)"
,nightvol,2012-04-27T16:01Z,this is faker than god. 
,GObonzo,2012-04-27T16:05Z,"can easily deselect files using magnets. you have list of files in ""Detailed Info"" pane with Bittorrent and uTorrent. choose Do Not Download for files you don't want. i know it's hard to read details or use program features for idiots."
,Typhoon222,2012-04-27T16:06Z,so is this real or fake? write it finally
,Jukeboxor,2012-04-27T16:31Z,"its real, but the there is no proper crack"
,mvrofiq,2012-04-27T16:47Z,"So, is this fake or not?"
,Typhoon222,2012-04-27T17:14Z,so why so many rate down?
,bazoo.ET,2012-04-27T17:20Z,game works fine
,bazoo.ET,2012-04-27T17:21Z,"thx salvistra

no problem with the game"
,Midorikawa,2012-04-27T17:52Z,Well.... works fine for me but the game starts without any installation so i think this is just cracked beta!! (the size is also very small when you exclude language packs)
,freek111,2012-04-27T18:05Z,does this include the treasure isle dlc ?
,Velious,2012-04-27T18:17Z,So this is just the cracked beta or the full version?
,Devon3r,2012-04-27T18:27Z,Seed this or me is gonna kill of ya!
,Devon3r,2012-04-27T18:29Z,all of ya* ;D
,Midorikawa,2012-04-27T18:33Z,CONFIRMING: this is just beta...
,salvistra,2012-04-27T18:52Z,No. You are using a crack that was made for the beta. The files I uploaded are NOT from the beta. You need to use a proper crack.
,Velious,2012-04-27T18:57Z,So we have to wait for the full version..
,JohnnyRawkz,2012-04-27T18:57Z,"There already was a working beta on the tracker, thanks for uploading one more but calling it a full game, asshole!"
,blaskus,2012-04-27T19:10Z,So any second hand confirmation ? is this just beta or what?
,salvistra,2012-04-27T19:23Z,"What? How can you use a crack that is from the beta and not expect it to tell you that it is the beta? Wow.

The files I uploaded are from the full game, but the crack that you downloaded from another site is stolen from a beta release. That's why I told you to get a proper crack. Understand?"
,Midorikawa,2012-04-27T19:24Z,yes this is just cracked beta...
,TheCrownedClown,2012-04-27T19:25Z,"hey i downloaded the game and found a crack and i have been playing it and i have already finished tacarigua and am at the sword coast map and it still working.
I got the crack from here but it was erased."
,Forgoth,2012-04-27T19:31Z," Not sure what the point of downloading this is,without crack i mean,when the crack is released there will probably be a Skidrow upload with it anyway."
,stbishop,2012-04-27T19:42Z,"Guys, don't comment before you used and checked it. 
Btw, I cant chose which files to download either with uTorrent or with BitTorrent. The info part is jsut empty for PirateBay torrents. But it works for other torrent trackers. Any suggestions how to fix?"
,darkony1992,2012-04-27T19:42Z,"the game files are real, just wait for a proper crack, it's says in the description if you read it."
,salvistra,2012-04-27T19:53Z,Well.. There are cracks out there - they just don't work well for everyone.
,Thunder187,2012-04-27T20:04Z,Can anyone find/make a crack and post a link to it plz?
,Manadona,2012-04-27T21:08Z,"It's the full game, I installed this a few days ago but didn't crack it. Now I'm running this very install with the original DVD in the Rom.

If you use a beta cracked exe file, ofcourse the game will tell you it's beta version, how dense are you people, really?"
,salvistra,2012-04-27T21:14Z,"You can use this crack that was posted earlier in a comment:
It will tell you that it is a beta, but otherwise it will work fine:

,KaizerNail,2012-04-27T21:24Z,Uploader is a fucking retard. Waiting for scene release now.
,LRN,2012-04-27T21:50Z,"OK, i'll explain.

A computer game is a complex piece of software. It consists of an engine and game resources (textures, models, scripts, etc).
A game engine consists of one or more binaries. Usually it has a few shared libraries (.dll) and at least one executable (.exe).
Depending on the copy protection used, it might have some extra .dlls that implement copy protection, and copy protection might be patched into executable(s).

Point is:
As other people commented, this is the full game. It means that all game resources are from the full game, not from the beta.
Also, depending on which files had to be cracked, the difference between beta engine and full game engine may vary. At worst - the whole engine is beta due to beta crack being used. At best - the cracked executable only had some non-critical code related to game startup, and the important engine components were in other modules; which means that while executable will claim that the game is beta, most of the engine is release-grade.

Also, bear in mind that late-stage development usually means that engine only gets bugfixes, but no new features (it takes months for people to implement game on top of an engine; once engine is ready, you have to keep it stable and only fix problems with it, without changing its interface). Because of that you can make an assumption that beta engine and release engine are very similar (i.e. they both use the same resources and use them in the same way). Which means that the game may be fully playable (all quests, all items, all dialogues, etc) even with beta engine. However, beta-grade engine parts can screw up graphics, and they may crash and/or leak memory. It all depend on which parts of the game are implemented in the engine, and which parts are scripted.

That said, i haven't downloaded or run this, so this is mostly speculation. However, people report that this is playable, so i'll assume that it is.

Just wanted for jackasses to SHUT THE FUCK UP, IF YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. Thanks."

,GObonzo,2012-04-27T23:41Z,"running fine a few hours in. not the greatest graphics (bad anti-aliasing on areas, etc) similar to Gothic games and Risen. whether that is because of the beta .exe or the game itself it still looks and runs perfectly fine."
,realtu,2012-04-28T00:02Z,"That crack still got some bugs at the sword island, waithing for proper crack."
,Thunder187,2012-04-28T00:04Z,How to instal this game :S
