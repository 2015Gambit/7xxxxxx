DESCRIPTION

 Set several years after the end of Risen, raging titans have devastated the world 
and pushed humanity to the brink of existence. Subsequently, monstrous
creatures have risen from the watery depths of the sea and their attacks
have brought all seafaring to a grinding halt. The hero, now a membe
r of the Inquisition, is sent out to find out how to stop the chaos caused by
these creatures from the deep. His quest begins with rumors that the
pirates who frequent the southern islands are the only ones who
know a way to get rid of the creatures once and for all and end their
reign of terror.
