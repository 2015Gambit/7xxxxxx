Try moving 1.0.1 to phone storage first. If this 1.1.0 still won't install you'll have to uninstall 1.0.1.

1.1.0 can be moved to SD after installing."

This is probably a stupid question and I'm sorry ahead of time, I beat the first version of this game and this 1 looks the same. I don't see any extra lvl's? Thanx though for the upload!!! Work's great!! :)"
