,Cryonica,2012-04-28T09:18Z,I have been told that the TTC is currently prosecuting anyone who post their courses based on IP address.  Anyone else heard that?
[V],dohduhdah,2012-04-28T12:00Z,I dunno... are they going to sue people globally? Did demonoid remove the new Da Vinci course? I think piratebay is less likely to remove any torrents simply because of an infringement complaint.
,santorus,2012-04-29T15:06Z,"People
there's a fake user called Cryonica that is trying to demove people from sharing ttc lectures. This user is spreading gossips about IP tracing, sues and prosecutions, don't believe him! God bless you people."
[V],dohduhdah,2012-04-29T15:37Z,Cryonica actually uploaded various TTC courses like Mysteries of the Microscopic World at Demonoid.
