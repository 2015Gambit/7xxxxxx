I'm dieing to see them, and much to my surprise there isn't anyone else out there uploading these.  Boggles the mind really."

Hey! Just to let you know (even though it's been almost a month now) the other episodes are titled under just ""Legend of Korra"". Hope this helps ya and probably a lot of others."
