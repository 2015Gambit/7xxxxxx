This strange and hilarious look into the lives of popular grunge band Alice In Chains puts some of rock music's most enigmatic personalities on display. Over-the-top hostess Nona Weisbaum leads the penetrating search for "Seattle Rock Boys," which results in candid interviews with Jerry Cantrell, Mike Inez, Sean Kinney, and the usually terse, brooding singer Layne Staley. In addition to this behind-the-scenes, regular guy action, the band is also shown in music video form, with excerpts of songs including "Over Now", "Head Creeps", "Heaven Beside You", and "Grind."
