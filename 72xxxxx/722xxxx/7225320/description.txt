Narratives:

Fusing together the musical complication and ingenuity of King Crimson with the ferocity and D.C.-sound of Fugazi, Faraquet have created an album of technical, churning, and passionate frenzies collapsed into melodically pleasing atrophy. After several smaller releases of 7" singles and four songs on a split single with the choppy, quirk-filled Akarso, the band moved to Dischord for the release of their first full-length, The View From This Tower. May be considered one of the best debut releases of 2000.
