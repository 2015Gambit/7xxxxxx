 YggRO2 is back and better than ever! I'd like to welcome you all to the new YggRO2 website. There have been some updates between Oct 21st and now but I haven't felt the need to update this page, but with the new site I'll keep this as updated as possible.

The month of November was spent debugging a very finicky problem whose origins still are not know, and now have a far better system than was previously in place. While the debugging put us over a month behind schedule, we never abandoned our plans for YggRO2's Future and have been working on getting back on track without cutting corners.

To that end I am thrilled to present YggRO2's 3rd major update for the server and our second client patch. A rebalanced stat system, a complete overhaul of the boat system from the one Gravity used, Cog_D02's opening as a 2+ player level 75-85 dungeon (adding new armor, headgear and auges), the stat reset cost has been altered retaining the idea that players must put forth effort but now is obtainable to any level player, along with many other things which can be found in the Patch Changelog.
