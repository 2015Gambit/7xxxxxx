An innocent rubbish tip assistant, Gert, is given the task 
of escorting a beautiful mute "princess", Plum, on a perilous 
journey to meet her prospective husband. Their journey is 
fraught with danger, challenges, romance and discovery. 
In surreal action, they encounter a menagerie of characters
and animals in far-flung corners of New Zealand. Written by 
James Hewison.
