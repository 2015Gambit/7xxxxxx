The Sea Wolf Mutiny is a four piece Indie rock band based out of Columbia, SC. Drawing from a wide range of influences such as Neil Young, U2, Bob Dylan, The Beach Boys, Mewithoutyou, and the literary works of Flannery O' Conner, The Sea Wolf Mutiny has fused a Indie Folk sound to ecstatic rock. From their first house shows to their CD release of "The Last Season" their sound has been characterized by a tumble and swagger infused with a tenacious and belligerent joy that is as contagious as it is catchy.
