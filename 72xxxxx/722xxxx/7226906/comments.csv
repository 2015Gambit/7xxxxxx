[V],psspss,2012-04-30T03:29Z,"The first 2 episodes I didnt think much off but
they seem to get better as the season progress

the first 2 they claimed they let the bad entities into their house as both families played with spirit boards :/

looks like they get a new medium after season 4
to replace one"
[V],psspss,2012-04-30T03:30Z,the first episode also  looks kiek it has interlacing.. I didnt notice at time but i should of use a deinterlacing special filter on converter to try to improve it.. others are better sources though
