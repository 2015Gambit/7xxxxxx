"The Girl with the Dungeons and Dragons
                                     Tattoo"

Dick Roman acquires Frank's hard drive that 
contains sensitive information about the 
Winchesters and gives it to an unsuspecting 
brilliant hacker named Charlie telling her 
she has 48 hours to crack the firewall or 
she is fired. Sam and Dean are tipped off 
that Dick has the hard drive and race to get 
to Charlie before she breaks the code. 
Meanwhile, Bobby tries to help the brothers, 
but his rage towards Dick for killing him 
starts to get in the way.

Evolve... or die.

Dumbass rars, the show doesn't even have 
emopires like that other CW shit.

Enjoy  :)
