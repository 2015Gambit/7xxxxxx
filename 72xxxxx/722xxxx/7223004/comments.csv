,eljepeto,2012-04-30T00:08Z,"Yeah its good, i download it too and you just have to extract all them in the same folder"
,ch3573r11,2012-05-01T00:50Z,"jeez, speed.cd sucks like always. ITS 2012 GUYS, ITS A TORRENT, NOBODY HAS ISDN, WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT RAR FILES NOT EVEN THE CORRUPT ONES."
,Tadrio,2012-05-02T00:17Z,What's the deal throwing a fit every time? Just get a half-decent media player. Both VLC and MPlayer play RAR files directly.
,weaping_reaper,2012-05-06T09:42Z,"Thank you man, SUPERNATURAL IS REALLY AWESOME, 

I just wish I didn't have to go to a motel to get these episodes.. Get this.. I recently got a 2 mbs/s  connection with an ISP called CAT-TV .. And they have disabled me from downloading torrents..seriously.. I open them with BITTORRENT, and they stall out...  
So on weekends, I have to rent a fucking motel room, just so I can download things I like :-( , but then again, people may say to me ""GO BUY THE SHIT!!"" but what they don't relize is, episodes like this, HAVENT came out yet.. So I can't just go.. BUY  it!! 
   And some ISPs don't fuckin get it, and they SCREW innocent people like myself!.. FUCK CAT-TV!"
