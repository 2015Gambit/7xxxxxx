To bad there wasn't a hack to get into Catalyst and friends ;-). Love the surge in technology, but it make it hard on us pirates!! Maybe someday someone will be able to crack the cloud. Thanks again!!"

,zapzapzip,2012-05-03T08:53Z,Please upload Fireworks CS6 for Mac. Thanks.
,1st_rate_mate,2012-05-03T17:12Z,I am unsure as to which dll files to replace.  I tried the tool but incorrectly as my trial is now 29 days.  Please advise.  THX
,1st_rate_mate,2012-05-04T19:10Z,"28 days remaining.  The ""adobe tool"" is malware (attempts to provide user identification)  What .dll's and which directories (ie system32?)  thanks"
,xpmule,2012-05-05T03:58Z,"I installed by extracting the files in this torrent with WinRar and then ran setup and launched Fireworks once, as stated in the instructions, then shut it off and copied the amtlib.dll over the one installed in this location..

C:Program Files (x86)AdobeAdobe Fireworks CS6amtlib.dll


Done"
,TimV55,2012-05-09T18:32Z,Awesome! I didn't think it would be available this soon! Crack DLL works :)
,pitatb,2012-05-27T16:22Z,thank u bro!!! 
,ebella,2012-05-29T04:12Z,"No complaints but what happens eventually to the ""trial"" screen? Is it suppose to disapear if the install is correct or does it count down the days and eventually disappear? Thank you for your efforts."
,xpmule,2012-05-29T13:39Z,"what trial screen ?
i don't see one..
you must not have put the crack in the right place.

copy it into your programs folder where you installed and make sure you do it with admin rights if you have UAC on

still keeping my eye out for a keygen though
but cracks is still working fine here for me"
,ttuhttuh,2012-06-01T07:49Z,any 1 got the code for it /
,Derragon,2012-06-20T21:08Z,"@All
Please remember to follow ALL instructions listed in the ""INSTALLING INSRUCTIONS.txt"" file.

You do not need to enter a key, as Step 2 will take care of this for you.

Once you have installed Photoshop as a trial version, all you have to do is copy your respective .dll into the proper folder. For 32-bit, it goes into this folder:
C:Program Files (x86)AdobeAdobe Photoshop CS6
For 64-bit, it goes into:
C:Program FilesAdobeAdobe Photoshop CS6

IF you are on 64-bit, copy the 32-bit dll into the 32-bit folder also, as you have both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Photoshop installed. DO NOT OPEN PHOTOSHOP YET.

Download the torrent listed in the Instructions file. (Adobe Tool 2.1)

Run Adobe Tool 2.1, run ""Check Hosts"", then click on ""Patch"".

You're done! You may now run Photoshop."

Don't be fooled people, filling out surveys isn't gonna get you anything"
,shain2501,2012-08-05T11:16Z,"When I download the file, and I double click on it, it asks me with what I want to open it. I downloaded Dreamweaver and the same happened to it, but when I changed the extension to .exe, it worked, but, In Fireworks, when I click it, just a black screen like cmd pops up and gone. :( Please help! What should I open the file with?"
,shaantmehedi,2012-09-06T18:45Z,it neither shows the RAR file nor the CRACK folder in the File Information.It only includes ADOBE FIREWORKS CS6.exe . how to cracked this??
