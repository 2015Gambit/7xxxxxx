,cawoodie,2012-06-08T02:14Z,MANTESH is the best. Good audio/video quality. You've never disappointed me. Thank you ever so much for this and all the rest.
,at7000,2012-06-15T07:19Z,"This film makes 'The Blair Witch Project,' look as artistic as Citizen Kane.

  Enough said. Okay, let me also state this- Even by horror
standards, which are 98% of the time, lower than the low, this film
kicks it down a notch. Acting was hilarious, plot was ludicrous,
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. I feel totally ripped off and 90 minutes
of my life wasted. I am going to start a movement, to warn people away
from this tripe, whoops, I mean film.

Normally I am very verbose on the rare occasions when I feel compelled to rip a film to shreds. In this case, there is absolutely nothing to say. 
  I would recommend students of film and real cinema, actually watch this sad attempt, to experience an example of ""cinema gone wrong."" Every painful second is something to be learned from, and never repeated.

I rate this film zero stars on a scale of 1 to 10,000 stars. "

,justmindy,2012-07-03T01:49Z,Great movie. My audio does go a bit off towards the 3/4 mark of the movie but it might be something with my machine or whatever. The movie itself is pretty good for a lower budget film.
,wogbabe97,2012-07-08T10:41Z,pretty good copy! thanks a lot. 9/10
