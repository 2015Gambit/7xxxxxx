,KevTPB,2012-04-29T19:14Z,"@thethingy, wondering, do you've got any plans on releasing Adobe PR aswell as Adobe AE -CS6 anytime in the near future?

Thanks in advance and lovin' the torrents! "

[V],thethingy,2012-04-29T20:13Z,"rokibih, coming next with incopy

,barnchad,2012-04-29T20:23Z,"@KevTPB : You don't know the thethingy very well do you. Back off, let the thethingy work, you'll get your apps.......geezz"
,KevTPB,2012-04-29T20:59Z,"@TheThingy, wonderful news, i'll make sure to look out for them!

and @Barnchad, is one, simple, polite question to much? As a new community member i might not be the most experienced on new releases.
Although i'am familliar with the bigger exploiters names, if i may call that term, thus though does not mean i know their excat schedule for uploading. Please, i was just asking one question.

although Thanks once again Thethingy!"
,barnchad,2012-04-30T16:56Z,"@KevTPB : Two, posted the same question on the Dreamweaver upload, but who's counting. No harm, just giving you a heads up. Probably would not have said anything, as TheThingy was answering your question at the same time I was addressing it. Welcome to TPB!! TheThingy is one of the elite members here and is one of the only reasons I come to the Bay. I have memberships elsewhere, but it is always a good idea to stop by and see TheThingy!!"
,adrien-,2012-05-01T22:39Z,"I would be cautious getting this. all his torrents say install as trial then do the patching, well your missing out on features then. For example PS cs6 extended doesn't have the 3d window or capabilities because its ""trial"" and FPcs6 (this torrent) - doesn't have Toolkit for createJS as shown in the adobe videos. Makes me wonder what else were missing from other applications."
,tuckerss,2012-05-03T13:12Z,"I extracted the torrent and started the install as per instructions started trial version
It asks me for an Adobe ID and tells me I need one to continue. I've never done this before so is it safe to make an Adobe ID and enter it as normal or will it detect that it's a pirate and shut it down or something?"
,PJStyx,2012-05-06T09:42Z,"adrien, you must get your facts right ... toolkit for createJS is an additional download from Adobe and wont be available until Flash CS6 is released later this month. Also all trials of Adobe software are fully functional so why you cannot find the 3D window in PS is beyound me as I have been using it without any trouble at all"
,adrien-,2012-05-07T16:35Z,@PJStyx  not sure either I installed 64bit and every time I run the 64 bit it tells me in the about that I am in fact running the 32 bit.... ??? - and I didnt know that it was a seperat download the create JS
,mandawg,2012-05-08T13:57Z,"Maybe you could give us some serials?
I have none."
,misteranimal,2012-05-08T21:16Z,"For this .exe and the ""Fireworks CS6"" one I always get an error reading ""Some installation files are corrupt. Please download a fresh copy and retry the installation"". It gave me the same error with Dreamweaver CS6 a twice before it finally shot through, Photoshop CS6 didn't give me a hastle at all. I'm wondering whether there is a cure for this? "
,mirmeohman,2012-05-09T02:49Z,Where exactly do I get the serial code? Am new to this whole thing.
,Accente,2012-05-10T23:50Z,"I have downloaded and installed it, but I cannot get it to work.

The software will not boot using either start menu or program files shortcut, with or without replacing the DLL file, doesn't matter.

Running Win. 7 Pro. 64bit"
,m0j0m0j0,2012-05-11T08:14Z,"thanks! works perfect!

if you're having problems, make sure you replace every DLL file under all the adobe folders, not doing so leads to many errors"
,ArslanKAS,2012-05-12T07:10Z,PirateBay is nothing without TheThingy !!!!!!
,drmaddogs,2012-05-13T02:57Z,"Brilliant writing thingy..question.. have started opening CS6 pacs, one at a time, cannot believe
I had no problems till this pac, lol,,,, so, and I know someones asked-but I cannot find a response to my current dilema..
Flash pro- my dnload was 1.2something gig, my install was 1.2.. but I am getting only X86 files to open/install.. 3 tries on current dnload am dnloading new torrent. 
Does Flash pro(yours) only install x86, not x64 program(win 7)...I opened AIR in the pac but I don't think that is keeping 'Pro' x64 from happening.
Also, the 'Bridge' reinstalls old .DLL with some of the additional pacs (other CS6 programs installations) coming open.
Speaking of which, in trying to discern where the problem might be, I noticed the .DLL is of same size for each pack(New DLL-x64+X86 respectively).. whereby I'm not asking about propiertaty line code,,, are the same instruction sets in each program pac the same?
Sure would help, not having to chase down the new .DLL for Bridge every time it changes when other pacs were opened...just use the current program pac ""new .DLL"" to change Bridge again would simplfy.
Anywho.. great job(I'm so jealous!)"
,monkiebar,2012-05-14T11:36Z,"You don't have enough seeds, enough respect or enough thanks for what you do for all the pirates. 

From everyone who forgot their piratebay password, from everyone who couldn't be bothered loggin' in. from everyone who can't afford to buy the real program but want to express their artistic needs; I thank you. "
,7deri,2012-05-17T00:22Z,"@monkiebar
*Sniff* That almost made me cry, LONG LIVE TPB :D"
,IkenCu,2012-05-19T08:56Z,Thank you so much! I hope that it works.
,Ikaruga1,2012-05-22T18:44Z,"Okay so I downloaded and installed it (the 64 version) and I followed the instructions exactly. And it wouldn't work. It gave me an error message. So I uninstalled it, reinstalled it and tried again and it still wouldn't work. It said there was a problem with the amtlib.ddl file but I copied the exact file that was provided in the download. Can anyone tell me what's wrong? I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure this out and I'll be very upset if I can't use it. :("
,piefactoryfactory,2012-05-25T01:42Z,Works perfectly.

,Naveek,2012-07-10T02:31Z,"I downloaded and extracted the files, and I can easily figure out how to fake activate it, but I have a problem. On the actual program installer, when I click on ""Sign in"" to enter an Adobe ID, the installer just hangs forever and ever, and nothing happens. How can I fix this?"
,fatlat,2012-07-16T10:05Z,"i have literally been at this for days, im really dumb and suck with computers but want to get this to work so bad, i did method 1 and replaced the dll file, but when i open it it still says continue trail which i press, is this how its supposed to be, like i always just press continue trail and i will have this forever? thanks in advance for any help"

,jlh1976,2012-08-05T14:03Z,"I had problems with Digital certificates.  It kept giving me errors.

I used the thingy method, which is the trial, then copy over the .Dll files....but I'm wondering if this is the reason I'm getting errors.

I might need a key for it."

,NoirTheE,2012-08-18T18:16Z,"It says that this programs file size on my disc drive is 1.27gigs, until i scan it, then it says it's size is 4.1 gigs, seems shady to me. I havnt extracted it yet."
,NoirTheE,2012-08-18T23:15Z,i guess if you have 32 bit like me you're fucked...
,faggot98,2012-08-20T23:01Z,"Where and how are you guys extracting anything? I only have one file and it's a .exe for CS6

Is this just a torrent of the trial version? Cuz you can get that straight from the adobe website...."

,siggibiggy,2012-08-25T15:41Z,Will it work even if the trial has run out?
,siggibiggy,2012-08-25T19:05Z,"Thank you so much for this! But I've come over a problem. After I got this working and after messing around with it for some weeks I desided I wanted photoshop too. So I downloaded that from you too (thnx for that) and then I tried to connect them (so I could edit stuff from flash on ps), but when I did that the timer started again (on flash) and now it's run out. Is there still a way to get it to work? Like resetting the timer or getting it to work somehow else?"
,abobepirate2,2012-08-29T04:04Z,"siggibiggy, I had the same thing happen to me with Dreamweaver.  Just replace the DLL files again and it should work."

Thanks for the opportunity, but it doesn't work for me. I followed the instructions, (Win 7 64 bit), I changed the .dll file, but it is still a trial version. Could anyone help me how to fix it?

Thanks a lot"
,horsepony,2012-09-09T08:23Z,"If you keep getting the trial version error make sure that you change the DLL files in BOTH 64bit and 32bit folders, even if you only use one. This fixed the problem for me."
,ribizligizi,2012-09-09T12:29Z,"Hi

I didn't think that the 32 bit version also was installed. I have found the 32 bit folders, and it works perfectly.
Thank you for your help. :)"

,hatzfeld,2012-09-16T23:03Z,"First of all: thank you for the work, you're like the reference for a lot of softwares dl on TPB!

I installed it in x86 with Win7, and I got some problems.

When I'm creating a shape (let's say rectangle) it is not possible to change the stroke color. I haven't worked on it further but I have the impression that some features are kinda bugged like the transition panel for the shape transformation for instance.

But I was a Flash 8 user so maybe I do not have the good method to work on it yet.
At first I thought of problems solved with the latest updates but... I was unable to update it: the ""Update is not clickable in the 'help"" menu.

Any suggestion?
Thx"
