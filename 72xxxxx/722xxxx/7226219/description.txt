The timecodes below are for people whose players don't switch between 2.0 and 5.1, others just ignore it.


Time Codes : 00:02:06.001
GUIDE: Open up the encode in MKVToolNix by adding
Go to the "Global" Tab.
Tick "Enable Splitting"
Select "After Time Codes and copy and paste the bits in bold, I've put above "GUIDE".
