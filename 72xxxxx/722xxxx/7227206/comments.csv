A/10 V/10 Movie 3/10"
,Akrnines,2012-04-30T09:57Z,"It's a B-Movie with a good budget and director.

Overall, I liked it and was surprised with the quality, the story is so convoluted and asinine that it can only ever be a B-Movie."
,porkor,2012-04-30T12:57Z,"wonderful movie. more fun than the first one.
The first one was more ""creepy"", while this one is more ""actiony"" - which works well imo. This one here has obviously way more budget (= more and larger sets) than the first one and goes more towards stalker (the game, not the movie), COD nazi zombies and indiana jones. perfect combination for me.
A/10 V/10 Movie 9/10 "

Why not just make an audio-cd, when all the scenes are to dark to see what happens anyway."
