There is also available by the way a CE version (multilang) I suppose can use the libraries as I do not trust the exe that is attached to that release.

,AsimOmer,2012-04-30T18:34Z,"Hi thethingy,

I think that the dll files in the original folder and the cracked folder are identical.

Thanks for the release."

,cool1919,2012-05-01T05:43Z,many thanks. it works.

,nwabunnia,2012-05-03T23:45Z,"Please I need help! I've installed every version of Dreamweaver CS6 I can lay my hands on-including the official one from Adobe web site-but I keep getting this problem: after installing completely without any problems, if I start the Dreamweaver, it will bring up a blue screen with error message that I can't read because it is too fast, then shut down and restart my system.

When I saw Thethingy's version, I thought my problems were over. But to my dismay, even this your own did the same thing. i don't know what is wrong. It is only Dreamweaver that does this-I installed Photoshop CS6, Acrobat X and Illustrator CS5.5 and they are all working fine, just Dreamweaver.

Another issue is that I reinstalling Dreamweaver CS5 that I was using before and now when it starts, it close again abruptly. And before you ask me to download Thethingy's tools, I've already downloaded them-Adobe Tools and Adobe Clean Install & Error Toolkit V4- and used them as per the instructions that come with them yet the problem persists.

Please any insight/help will be much appreciated since I need Dreamweaver badly. Thanks"

Disable windows from restarting after the blue screen of death. You can google how to do this for your particular version. This will allow you to see the error code. Write it down, restart and google the code."

,flopeye,2012-05-08T02:25Z,"@nwabunnia,

were you able to install the program? Or does this happen on while installing? try shutting every non-essential program down before running. 

Also, are you running 32 or 64 bit? Did you put the files in their right places?"
,nwabunnia,2012-05-08T15:08Z,"@flopeye

Believe me, I've been through hell and back on account of this issue. I tried reinstalling XP (Pro, 32 bit) then hit a brick wall during the installation process.

I can't even begin to enumerate all I went through during the process. Thank God I have another XP installation on another partition which I created specifically for problems such as this. I booted into the XP installation, then from their, accessed the troublesome partition and restored files from the SIV folder to the windowsconfig folder.

I can now boot into the system again (I'm writing this from there) but the Dreamweaver problem still persists.

I think service pack 3 may be the culprit because it was when I reinstalled it that I had the problem of not being able to boot into the system. I'm now trying to uninstall it, but it is not showing up on the list of installed programs in ""Add/Remove Programs"". Tried Tune Up Utilities, CCleaner and Revo Uninstaller, still ca not find it in the list of installed programs.

trying to use Google to find how else to uninstall it.

Thanks.  "

Question I don't see a 64 dll once I extract all the files.

Is this version for 64 bit?"
,HMSIllegal,2012-05-10T11:14Z,Unlike the other CS6 hacks this one is defiantly running too much CPU. Once the .dll has been installed the program works but runs at a constant 50%  :(  
,flopeye,2012-05-11T01:28Z,"@HMSIllegal,

If you weren't using that Pentium 166Mhz chip from 1996 you wouldn't be at 50%.

Just kidding. :)"

I also tried putting the ""original"" dll back, but it stays the same (no trial flash screen either) Cheers in advance."
,artikweb,2012-05-12T02:57Z,"I'm also having the 50% cpu usage problem! Everytime I open DW CS6, the process just eats up 50% the cpu (and my laptop cooler goes paranoid). 

The problem occurs when I apply the cracked file. 

If I open a menu (inside DW), the process goes back into a normal state, but as soon as I close it... well, back to paranoid mode. 

Is there anyway to fix this? New/fixed crack?"

,m135,2012-05-27T09:37Z,The amtlib.dll replacement has a very annoying side effect. It's always taking 100% of the CPU cores.
,sheeptwo,2012-05-29T02:59Z,"Are there any workarounds for the 100% core usage? (other than paying 400$)

Any ETA on the crack release from CORE?"
,Givinity,2012-05-31T07:08Z,"just note: thethingy was abit unlucky when cracking this program, he makes the license-stuff thread go in an endless, sleepless, 100% cpu-taking (100% of 1 core, eg 50% for dual-core, 25% for quad-core, 13% for hyperthreading/8-core, etc) loop.

thethingy: could you try fixing that so it doesn't eat up so much cpu?"
,sheeptwo,2012-05-31T08:30Z,"No, it isn't that straightforward.
If you open a menu or some window inside the Dreamweaver, the 100% core usage stops, so there's more to it."
,Givinity,2012-06-04T22:40Z,"sheeptwo: it doesn't happen in uncracked/trial mode, so almost defiantly related to the crack;
however you're right, that stops the cpu usage (until you go back to the code), strange o.0"

,JimmayN,2012-06-22T02:00Z,"Got a laptop with quad hyper-threaded i7 and it stays at around 30% cpu no matter what you do unless you click on a menu item which basically pauses the program. It looks like the changed and recompiled amtlib.dll conflicts with dreamweaver cs6 only.

It's a pretty hard fix and only the person who changed the library can really fix it somewhat easily."

It's some kind of Dreamweaver bug. The guy who cracked the amtlib.dll probably won't be able to fix it. So we need to wait either the fix from Adobe (I heard it affects some genuine users) or some kind of keygen from CORE (if that's even possible)."
