Haunting Evidence - USA ParaSeries(2005) S01-S03 xvid various Episodes

I pieced together 9 episodes of this series
from various web stream source
i know theres at least another 14 episodes (with
Swedish subs)
that have been on the web like youtube (
which had them removed) and private trackers
and once on TPB but no one is seeding them
anymore 

Basically its like Sensing Murder Murder
New Zealand but no way as good (at least
they tested the mediums at found only
a handful out of 100s that got their test
facts correct from cold cases)

its also 22min per episode not a 1.5hr like
Sensing Murder except for the S03 specials
and a couple of episodes in S01/S02

Starts of talking about the cold case
of murder victim then Psychics/Mediums
try to sense what they can from the
so called spirit world

If you have more of this series
so we can complete it fully let
me know and provide some links if any :)

converted to xvids 4:3ratio.. most
are 640x480 some are 320x240
and more blurry.. quality varies
but are watchable on Laptop
Use VLC 2.01 and enable the sharpener
real time filter helps a lot!

HELP TO SEED if grabbing

ENJOY
