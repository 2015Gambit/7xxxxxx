,Xeiros,2012-04-28T19:48Z,SD is fine but for fucks sake stop messing with the aspect ratio and cutting out part of the picture. Any idiot can tell something is wrong when even the logos are cut off. 
,dm_punks,2012-04-28T20:45Z,"Yes, please, stop the croppage, {C_P}."
,naga111,2012-04-28T22:15Z,ty!
,axel0c,2012-04-28T22:16Z,"Well since we're all asking, SD is all good but for a series of this scale shouldn't we have moved HD by now? I only ask since there are other series in HD now."
,tran001,2012-04-29T00:55Z,I guess I'm going to have to watch this twice: one in SD and then HD when it becomes available! Thanks C_P!
,rickruin,2012-04-29T03:41Z,Cartoon Palace Releases are the worst shit ever. They keep supporting Xvid. They keep adding their ugly as fuck lower third logo that takes up a 3rd of the screen like the shit we hate from broadcast tv. They are ship and supporting C_P is supporting shit quality period. Fuck their crap!
,dk3968,2012-04-29T05:10Z,thank you {C_P} for sharing with us
,NMatuzic,2012-04-29T08:21Z,"My god, this C_P bunch have to be the most frustrating and annoying bunch out there! PLEASE STOP with your stupid cropping, numbnuts!"
,slybunda,2012-04-29T12:33Z,"retards have overcropped again, must be some 7 year old doing the encoding."
,vemoth,2012-04-29T14:22Z,It's ripped from TV therefor cropping off watermarks to avoid FBI agents or other horrors that knocks on your door.
,Osmosian,2012-04-29T18:04Z,vemoth How dumb are you if you think that's the reason?
,stalker277,2012-04-29T19:00Z,very...
,TheRealAngelMike,2012-04-30T12:18Z,Its weird that the 720 version still not up :S
,maffel,2012-04-30T18:16Z,i'll never get this cropped shit anymore...
[T],despo1ler,2012-04-30T22:54Z,"why oh why do you keep comoplaining about cropping when the only thing that is cropped off are the black bars that CN add to the video in order to air a 16:9 HD AR video on their 4:3 SD AR channel? what is the logical reason for keeping 30 pixels of blank screen above and below the actual picture? the only thing you are losing is part of the CN logo, is it so imprtant to you that you would rather we reduce the overall quality of the encode just to include those black bars and complete the CN logo?
 what is the possible advantage of including empty spaces above and below the video?
 To include the black bars would reduce the amount of the overall bitrate that can be dedicated to the actual picture and so reduce the quality of that picture. 
Please make up your minds, do you want us to try to provide the best possible quality video or do you want us to reduce the video quality in order to include empty screen? 
I am going to ask the encoder, for 1 week only, if he will encode these shows without cropping just to prove to everyone how pointless it is to keep big black bars top and bottom of the picture and reducing the overall quality just to include them"

[T],despo1ler,2012-04-30T23:09Z,"I also notice that the people who are so busy complaining about empty screen being cropped off to improve quality do not have a single upload on the site. If you release and encode your own  uploads you have a right to criticise anothers work, otherwise pls keep opinons on a subject you clearly know nothing about to yourselves."

,Kazu-kun,2012-04-30T23:42Z,"Crying about stuff your getting for free, your joking right?

The facts are YES YJ airs in hd but this is a big but if the capper does not have the hardware or the hd channel how can they cap in hd? 

And for the last time the cropping removes the black bars that are add by CN to air 16x9 in 4:3. So if its missing part of the video its because of CN, not C_P cropping it wrong.

Here is a link to see images taken from the original cap file, before anything is done.

You mean like only singers got the right to criticize Rebecca Black, right? The picture quality of his uploads ALWAYS suck. It doesn't matter at all if we got any uploads, because we are the ones that...duh...download the file?"
[T],helder1965,2012-05-04T18:59Z,"Today teams 2HD and FQM announced that they will adopt formt x264/MP4, finnaly! When C_P will adopt this new format? Do you intend insist on XviD/AVI?"
,megate,2012-05-05T07:18Z,@helder1965 when you  pay for  me to get the hd channels i will but im not doing sd encodes with hd codecs
,dm_punks,2012-05-05T20:42Z,"@despoiler: just looked at those screens you posted of the uncropped raw vids. I didn't realize that the only thing cropped was the black bars. Now I know why the CN logo is cut off that way (because CN places part of it on the black bars).

Please accept my apologies and continue releasing the good stuff. Thanks! ^_^v"
