,ess_tee,2012-05-02T23:16Z,"Hi there,

Looks like a great torrent. Everything I needed downloaded really fast, EXCEPT for the txt files and excel file (which I was particularly interested in). Is there anywhere else I can get them from quickly, please?

Thanks for all the effort that went into this :)"
,valest,2012-05-04T06:47Z,Can you please seed? I've been stuck at 99.9% since last night :(
,pierrick8,2012-05-06T13:21Z,99.9% too pleaaase help us
,ZZeka,2012-05-06T14:39Z,SEED! 99.9% for 5 days.. :/
,W_Irizarry,2012-05-07T03:50Z,"All,

Thank you very much for the kind words.  I have worked diligently on this torrent.  I'm trying so hard to get more seeds but it seems like we've been stuck.  I'll keep seeding and hope more will.  Hang in there."
,lololtiff,2012-05-13T05:08Z,"is this only the expansion packs and not the game itself?

My version of the sims 3 is a pirated version, so how do i install the expansion packs onto my version of sims 3?

thanks :):"
,lololtiff,2012-05-13T17:16Z,"lol hi again. this torrent doesn't really work? according to all the comments i see here, the torrent stops at 99.9% for me as well...

,blahthing,2012-05-14T15:10Z,"Hi! 

I want to say thank you for the upload. 

I am wondering...why is this updated version is ~600mb smaller than the previous version? (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7217107/Sims_3_Store_Full_June_2009_-_April_2012_Sims3Packs___Packages)

Is there something missing?"
,Carochinha,2012-05-15T17:58Z,"I'm pretty sure that, right now, I love you. 
(btw, my torrent is also at 99.9%, but I can still read the Read Me file, even though it isn't done o.o Still, the Excel sheet is unavailable. If you could do a torrent or something with that only, it would be great. Or maybe it's something in your computer that isn't letting us get it?)
THANKS ANYWAY, MUCH LOVE, YOU ARE AWESOME. "
,GoodTunes,2012-06-29T00:02Z,"We're all stuck at 98.5%, someone seed for like five minutes!"
,pandoralice,2012-07-06T22:23Z,"Please seed, I'm stuck at 99,9% !
Thanks ^^"
