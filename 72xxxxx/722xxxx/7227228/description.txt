Hey all,

So, this is my 3rd release of this torrent, as I've been procuring more items and testing packages and Sims3Packs out.  Let me start by letting you know what this torrent is.  It is the COMPLETE Sims3 STORE, from June 2009 up to April 2012.  It includes all store items, bonus items, and worlds.  I have created an Excel spreadsheet that includes all the items included and what month they fall under.  It is very detailed, as I have went through each individual Sims3Pack to make sure there were no duplicate items, or if a pack was not needed because the items were already included in another pack.  Use the Read Me file to learn how to install package files in the game.

This torrent includes Sims3Pack files of items broken down by month, as well as a single package file for each month.  I've also included some pretty cool mods for the sims if you so choose to use them.  Just read the Mods Read Me File to get more details on what they are.

I have noticed a common problem.  The Sims 3 Launcher doesn't like to install all the Sims3Packs.  From the tests I've run, it seems like it's a number thing.  Once you install so many Sims3Packs, it doesn't want to install more.  From what I've noticed, under the "Downloads" tab in the Sims 3 Launcher, it says that the Sims3Packs are installed.  However if you start the game, when you are picking to play a saved game or start a new one, on the bottom left is a button that says "...", select Open Launcher and if you go to the "Downloads" tab in Launcher, it says that not all the Sims3Packs are installed.  This got very frustrating.  I tried numerous attempts to get them all to install, but I think it's a glitch with The Sims 3 that hopefully they fix.

This is why I have included package files.  The easiest solution I have found is if you use the package files to run the store content, but use Sims3Packs to install the worlds.

I have spent countless hours/days working on this assortment to share with the people, as it should be.  I hope you enjoy the work I have put forth, and if you have any problems or questions about this torrent, please feel free to comment and I will check back frequently to provide help.  Enjoy!
