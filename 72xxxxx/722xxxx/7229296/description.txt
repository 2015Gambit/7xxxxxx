Even as developments in photorealistic computer graphics continue to affect our work and leisure activities, practitioners and researchers are devoting more and more attention to non-photorealistic (NPR) techniques for generating images that appear to have been created by hand. These efforts benefit every field in which illustrations - thanks to their ability to clarify, emphasize, and convey very precise meanings - offer advantages over photographs. These fields include medicine, architecture, entertainment, education, geography, publishing, and visualization. "Non-Photorealistic Computer Graphics" is the first and only resource to examine non-photorealistic efforts in depth, providing detailed accounts of the major algorithms, as well as the background information and implementation advice readers need to make headway with these increasingly important techniques.
