,hmr4m,2012-04-29T23:48Z,Pay no attention to the previous comment. This is the correct episode... week 1 room reveal. I think someone must be confused with time zones or something. The show aired in Australia over over 12 hours ago. Downloaded crazy fast for me too!
,egoode,2012-04-30T09:27Z,Argh i don't know why it downloaded so fast for you I've been trying for about 12 hours now and still only have downloaded 40%!

FQM count the ""The Block Unlocked"" behind the scenes episodes as part of the series (but they're not being capped - or if they are I haven't seen them uploaded - just the preview portion on Friday shows) so FQM episode numbers and BF1's episode numbers will differ and continue to get further apart as the season continues.... follow one or the other and you shouldn't miss anything."
