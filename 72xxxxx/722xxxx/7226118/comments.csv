,Sontiago2000,2012-04-29T11:46Z,Might it be at all possible for someone to actually seed>? everyone is stuck at 76.9
[T],bill_214,2012-04-29T19:25Z,Hogwash... I show 40 seeders and I'm uploading this at over 2.3 MB/s myself.
[T],bill_214,2012-04-29T20:37Z,"Make sure that you're not attempting to DL this one, it's not being seeded.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7226111/Baby.Fat.5.2010.XXX.NTSC.COMPLETE.DVDR-ANiPUNK

There's and explanation on that page, however you should be able to simply delete that .torrent file and then load this one and you should be fine."
,Sontiago2000,2012-05-01T06:27Z,50 people at 99.9 percent now for 5 days....
[T],bill_214,2012-05-01T06:59Z,"

Sontiago2000, you must be some kind of dumbass....no, it hasn't been 5 days... the upload isn't even that old, I just uploaded this yester-fucking-day.... can't you count?

People must have hit and run. When I abandoned this yesterday evening there were over 45 seeds."
,Sontiago2000,2012-05-01T08:37Z,sorry... just 2 days... And we appreciate all you do.. You don't have to be mean about people commenting do you? I was just saying no one can get this to finish... 
,Sontiago2000,2012-05-01T08:46Z,"Sorry.... only 2 days so yes I apparently cannot count... We appreciate all you do but you really don't need to be mean when comments are made.. you said this "" Comments are appreciated.... "".. I was just saying there's lots of us stuck.. But again, thanks..."
[T],bill_214,2012-05-01T16:12Z,I apologize for being mean.... sorry
