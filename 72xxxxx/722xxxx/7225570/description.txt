Set several years after the end of Risen, raging titans have devastated the
world and pushed humanity to the brink of existence. Subsequently, monstrous
creatures have risen from the watery depths of the sea and their attacks
have brought all seafaring to a grinding halt. The hero, now a member of the
Inquisition, is sent out to find out how to stop the chaos caused by these
creatures from the deep. His quest begins with rumors that the pirates who
frequent the southern islands are the only ones who know a way to get rid of
the creatures once and for all and end their reign of terror.

With an all-new pirate-based theme, Risen 2: Dark Waters aims to combine the
most loved classic RPG gameplay mechanics of the original Risen with a fresh
theme and setting on a huge variety of themed island locales. A third-person
role-playing game set in a dark and gritty universe, Risen 2: Dark Waters
maintains the most immersive features of the original Risen, with multiple
approaches to every challenge allowing players to shape the game world based
on their own decisions. These choices will serve to unlock new paths,
features and additional skills for the character. Together with a highly
interactive environment and a full day/night-cycle affecting countless
aspects of the game world, Risen 2 will be set in the most immersive RPG
game world so far.
