,nondoleo,2012-05-08T00:20Z,"Strangely, after the torrent was complete and I began the installation software, my Norton software deleted the file immediately.  I went ahead and torrented ThumperDC's torrent instead:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7223787/AnyDVD__amp_amp__AnyDVD_HD_v7.0.4.0_Final_Incl._HD_Key_[ThumperDC]

. . . and had no problems.

Just letting you know, I doubt that there was anything actually harmful."
,ioannisarc,2012-05-09T11:55Z,Thank you very much.
,idiocybiz,2012-05-13T17:49Z,"Why is the package encrypted? I have to execute your code in order to install it? No thanks. 

What happened to just including a separate little credits executable?"
,Flex71,2012-05-13T18:02Z,"I can confirm, Norton detects a threat and deletes file. Before anyone even suggests it, NO I will NOT disable my anti-virus software for any reason whatsoever! I have learned from experience, turning off anti-virus software can and most likely will cause your pc to become infected. I've been hacked, tracked, and hi-jacked, so I know that it is better to safe than stupid."
,drexel75,2012-05-14T22:19Z,"@flex and you guys using norton. I cant stand Norton. Norton/Mcafee seems to put more crap on your computer than it protects you from. As soon as i uninstalled them my computer ran so much better and my new antimalware found a ton of stuff. I recommend using Microsoft Security Essentials as your Realtime Antimalware and also installing Malwarebytes, Superantimalware and IOBit antimalware for just scanning. Get rid of Norton. Youll be so glad you did"
,kalanaka,2012-05-15T05:11Z,don't know why but there are many movies that are not decoding. Anyone know why?
,Jax264,2012-05-25T14:29Z,"@kalanaka,
the new version of anydvd is pretty weird, i've felt the same that it's not handling some discs very well. thank slysoft for that! the most reliable version for me is 6.8.8.0
and this new key is perfect, even works for older versions, thank you chattchitto.
btw give Ideal DVD Copy a try, it's a fantastic ripper."
,mojowoikin,2012-05-31T07:20Z,"Thanks ChattChitto! Easy install, worked great! I appreciate all the awesome software you've uploaded. "
,Simard94,2012-06-13T22:28Z,"""Update request denied, please check your licence and contact Slysoft support!"" is the error I'm getting every time I start AnyDVD, any idea on how to fix it?"
,susi1804,2012-06-15T12:00Z,it works! great man
,tristan117,2012-06-23T07:10Z,"""Update request denied, please check your license and contact Slysoft support!""
I'm getting the same error, every time. Any suggestions please?"
,Darth_Adversor,2012-07-05T00:57Z,"This wasn't working for me, I was also getting the ""Update request denied"" message.  I also tried Thumper's, same thing.  I found a 7.0.4.1 Beta from Sentry, worked great.  Probably not ChattChitto's fault, Slysoft probably did something.  Windows 7 64.

,abelard33,2012-07-08T19:12Z,"Works perfectly, ChattChitto's torrents are good.

Here's what I did: Uninstall your old Anydvd and pull the network cable out of your computer. Run the installer, click setup, and restart when it asks you to. Anydvd will start and say your trial is expired. Close Anydvd. Run the installer again and click Key. It should say it was successful. Open Anydvd and go to the settings and uncheck ""Automatically check for new AnyDVD version"" and ""Use Online Protection Database"". Open your firewall settings (I use Windows' built in one), choose to add another program, choose Anydvd, and uncheck the checkmark next to its name on the left. You can now plug your network cable back in."
,pragette1,2012-07-12T22:19Z,"I was using this since quite some time and now after a restart it says that my version isn't licenced. please put in a valid licence key. and then it says registered on reto ... with serial nr... and updates free for ever?
maybe because they release a new update and i didn't turn something off?"
,al360ex,2012-07-13T02:47Z,"For those having installation problems, add this to your hosts file :

#Slysoft
127.0.0.1 slysoft.com
127.0.0.1 secure.slysoft.com "
,yonatan18,2012-07-17T01:42Z,What is the code? For now all i have is the trial period how do i get the code? Please Help!
