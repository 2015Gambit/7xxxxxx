Took someones request and actually did it, took lossless formatted files and converted them to 320 kbps mp3's for ppl to enjoy on their media player of choice, yes i know lossless is perfect sound quality, and great if you wanna burn it to disc, but most ppl want to d/l the song/album and them pop it onto their player and go. so here ya go

all cd's taken from the lossless torrent, converted into 320 kbps mp3's for your enjoyment
