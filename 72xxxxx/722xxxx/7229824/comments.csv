,chepito41,2012-05-13T06:02Z,I know that maybe this has been ask but I cant find a right answer I google it but I get mix responses. How do I inject subtitles? where can I get them? I'm mainly looking for spanish subtitles. also How is it that this it's 1.95 GB and 1080p. I'm a noob at this movie thing so go easy on me.
,moonerman100,2012-05-24T22:39Z,"chepito41: Just go to google! Put this words:
 subtitles spanish
it gives you some links follow those!

Also, you can search in opensubtitles.org or subscene.com, which both have plenty of movies subtitles in hefty amount of languages!"
