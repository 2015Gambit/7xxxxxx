Whole.Tomato.Visual.Assist.X.v10.7.1901.0.Cracked-BRD

sounds like your implying you cracked this yourself"
,barnchad,2012-05-21T00:37Z,"@unmarkedfaith. I am like a kid in a candy store!! I have bookmarked your torrent list. This is awesome!! I can check out all the great dev tools before I purchase. Thank you!! I hope you keep your Dev Tool Central going, you have created a PRICELESS resource here. One to be proud of."
,unmarkedfaith,2012-06-11T20:00Z,"@xpmule,  I only take credit for cracks or serials I produce.  BRD is a crack by the respective group.  I just release on this front for certain groups as well as our own group."
,xpmule,2012-07-27T11:37Z,"how do you have a group if you simply download releases by real groups and then upload them to TPB ?

It looks like you omit the scene release nfo and add your own information..

first you say buy it.

then you say 3 lines of info about release (carefully hiding the REAL group that you got your download from)

and then you say buy it again.

so what does your group do ? lol

And if you answered my question previously i missed what you were saying..
Is this or is this NOT the BRD release ?
""The Black Riders""

Currently i'm using the build 1903 BRD release. (not on TPB yet) but VA released build 1908 recently.

Knowing what you got from where is important.. obviously no ???
Well this program is usually cracked by BRD but there is a couple other indie crackers that release this also, one of them rips off BRD's crack basicly.
And you may think who cares ?
Well some of the cracks work properly and some don't.. once or twice in the last year BRD screwed up their release and issued a repacked fixed release..
And sometimes other crackers screwed up the release.
So knowing as much info about the release is VERY important !

I have no trust in people that download apps from real groups and remove the scene info and upload them almost implying its their release (aka: a repacker)
But that's the TPB way of doings things..
And 99% of you reading this won't care until you suffer the consequences I'm guessing ;)
Its probably pointless in me posting this also because anyone that thinks like me probably wouldn't even be reading this page in the first place and im pretty sure the rest of the people wouldn't have any idea what i have said AND why.. lol welcome to TPB"
,unmarkedfaith,2012-09-22T04:08Z,"@xpmule,  certain packages I receive I simply post.  I release a lot of api's that me or others have access too.  If they are released by other groups on undernet etc, I have never removed credit.  Their credit files was simply not attached when ""I"" had received this package.  So before going off on a tirade get facts straight.   I do this is a kind service as there is no other places (for free) that has ever released such development api access.   So from time to time things come to me that don't always include their nfo's.   (see new comment/description on newer posts). For 98% of releases though they come directly from us.  "
