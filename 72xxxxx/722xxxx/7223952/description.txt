Rain DeGrey has always been a screamer and that is part of her allure. She really lets you know when you are giving it to her good. There is nothing like a little bit of positive feedback to let you know you are on the right track. She will make sure everyone around knows when she is feeling the pain and that is what makes her so much fun to play with.
