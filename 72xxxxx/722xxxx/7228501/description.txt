Wasn't aware of there would be a season 6 of this show, but here it is :)

Episode 1 - From Hollywood To Hell


A gym friend offers Erik Aude a free trip to Turkey and $800 to bring back leather goods. When the trip goes smoothly, Erik takes a similar trip to Pakistan. But this time, authorities discover opium in the lining of Erik's suitcase - a crime he didn't know he was committing. With nothing but his pride and innocence to hold on to, Erik endures months of torture and hostile inmates at Pakistan's largest prison, refusing to plead guilty. Erik describes his reaction to the brutal conditions and, in a Locked Up Abroad first, he even re-enacts the entire emotional saga himself.
