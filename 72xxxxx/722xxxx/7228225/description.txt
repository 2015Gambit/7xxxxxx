Notes -

Source was very nice.. does have a slight black border every once in awhile.. decided not to crop it out
as its not much there.. cleaned up the already nice vid a lil bit.. denois, slight rgb adjustment, 

contrast
and brightness then just sharpened it up a touch and muxed in INSPiRAL's nice CAM audio....enjoy
