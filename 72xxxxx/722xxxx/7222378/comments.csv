i was wondering if you do requests as I  have been looking for the Wicker Man - the original Robin Hardy 1973 version - which is rightly seen as a great and influential horror film - I am sure this would be a very popular upload as it does not seem that there is a BR rip on TPB - "
,ALAINPAIN,2012-04-27T22:59Z,GoodFilms - just did some research - looks like it was supposed to have been released in 2010 but was withdrawn to be restored and has disappeared? form release schedules 
[V],GoodFilms,2012-04-28T02:13Z,always worth checking if something is available before requesting :)
