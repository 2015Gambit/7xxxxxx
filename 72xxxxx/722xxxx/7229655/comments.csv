Download and extract the .ass file then rename the first part of the file name to the same as the movie mkv file e.g. 

Nobita.and.the.Steel.Troops.2011.720p.BluRay.x264-WiKi.ass
Nobita.and.the.Steel.Troops.2011.720p.BluRay.x264-WiKi.mkv

Your player needs to support subtitles I use PotPlayer http://tvpot.daum.net/application/PotPlayer.do
