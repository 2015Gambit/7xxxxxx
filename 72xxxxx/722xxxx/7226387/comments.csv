,pirataninjas,2012-04-29T22:06Z,"The name of the movie is: ""Tape 407"". Not ""area 407"". THe name of the movie gives a hint of the content. 

Cloverfield, blair witch project, Chronicle, and now Tape 407. If you like these types of movies, this is for you."

,layne17,2012-04-29T22:28Z,"@ pirateninjas... No offense, but you are wrong. Its being released as Area 407. Tape 407 was more of a working title. "
,pimpmobile,2012-04-30T12:00Z,This movie was shot like the blare witch!  So if you did not like blaire witch you wont like this.
,fuzzybrain,2012-04-30T22:37Z,exellent. I'm only interested  in masterpieces
,babybluetits24,2012-05-01T16:24Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2062661/reviews imdb score 4.2/10 

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 1285seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum & fakes (after theyve been online at least 60mins)  thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "

,sonicdevil,2012-06-09T06:30Z,fuck imdb reviews there reviews are so inaccurate lately and according to movieweb The name of this movie is Area 407. 
,gatopemex,2012-08-12T06:38Z,"The video has these glitches that get annoying.  It has nothing to do with the homemade video quality of the movie.  I'm fine with that.

I think it has to do with the frame rate?  Either way, it makes the movie unwatchable for me."

Ummm no...actually look at the IMDB listing...imdb have labelled it Tape 407 but if you look at the original cover the real name is Area 407"
