DESCRIPTION:

This book is intended to be used as a textbook for graduate students studying theoretical computer science. It can also be used as a reference book for 
researchers in the area of design and analysis of approximation algorithms. Design and Analysis of Approximation Algorithms is a graduate course in 
theoretical computer science taught widely in the universities, both in the United States and abroad. There are, however, very few textbooks available for 
this course. Among those available in the market, most books follow a problem-oriented format; that is, they collected many important combinatorial 
optimization problems and their approximation algorithms, and organized them based on the types, or applications, of problems, such as geometric-type 
problems, algebraic-type problems, etc. Such arrangement of materials is perhaps convenient for a researcher to look for the problems and algorithms 
related to his/her work, but is difficult for a student to capture the ideas underlying the various algorithms. In the new book proposed here, 
we follow a more structured, technique-oriented presentation. We organize approximation algorithms into different chapters, based on the design 
techniques for the algorithms, so that the reader can study approximation algorithms of the same nature together. It helps the reader to better understand 
the design and analysis techniques for approximation algorithms, and also helps the teacher to present the ideas and techniques of approximation 
algorithms in a more unified way.
