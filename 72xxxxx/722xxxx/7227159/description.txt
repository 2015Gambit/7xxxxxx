Also known as nVidia Pinball, ripped from a ForceWare CD (v1.1), which was delivered with nForce motherboards back in 2001

Soldier of the Universe is not like any other pinball game. Modelled in stunning detail and rendered completely in real-time, you will have the ability to see and play pinball the way it was meant to be played. Not your ordinary pinball game, Soldier of the Universe was created with over 40,000 polygons and takes advantage of hardware transform and lighting. This game is an incredible site to see in real-time. While using high-resolution textures, this pinball game looks just as good close up as it does from far away.

Note: Tested in Windows 7 64-bit, it works fine but when I apply a resolution higher than 1280 x 1024 x 32 the game crashes

Install: Extract and Play
