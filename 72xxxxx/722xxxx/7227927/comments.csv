Those lunatics think ""life"" begins at conception, but then are for the death penalty, and LOVE sending poor soldiers to kill and die in other countries. They even want women who were raped, sometimes even by family, to keep those children, but once the children are born, they couldn't care less about feeding them or supporting the ones that are disabled - their ilk are filthy HYPOCRITES!

If you'd read the paper first, you'd know that it is not the product of ignorant mind.  Weeks of research went into the production of this work.  This is a well informed abortion-related argument, but it's also more than that.  If you want to know what it's all about, I suggest that you download it and read it.  I'm willing to discuss the paper with you, but trying to provoke me isn't going to have desirable results for either of us."
