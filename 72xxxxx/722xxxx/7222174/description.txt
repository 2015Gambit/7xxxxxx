
Sherlock and Columbo inspire me to be honest. This is posted here and was created entirely because of the upload by neon and neon's comment in response to two people.  

The BD had it as 4 parts with rolling credits at the beginning and end of each part because it is a mini-series (or serial in the UK) not a movie of longer than average feature length. If you think editing the mini-series into a single file is a hack butchering of the programme then this is probably for you. 

If there is a demand for it i can put up the 720p release by GaGE. Since these were made HAGGiS has come out with a DVDrip of this too but they accidentally numbered the parts wrong and so it hasn't seen such wide distribution.
