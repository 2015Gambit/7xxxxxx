[T],iamgreat,2012-04-28T21:07Z,"It will be a little bit but i think i might be able to get King s2e9 up later today. Sadly the episodes don't just pop out of the oven all done. Capping is still an hour. But some equipment changes have editing and encoding much improved. 

I was so hoping for comment on this release though. "
