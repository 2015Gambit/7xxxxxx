,fmhsdylan,2012-04-29T16:59Z,Sorry for the double-post!!! xD
,hstpb,2012-04-30T13:09Z,"Please, check it! Acrobat/Distiller and Flash Builder works only for 30 days if you don't replace the DLL. But if you replace the DLL, both Acrobat and Flash Builder Acrobat/Distiller and Flash Builder WILL NOT work. 

It looks like the provided DLL does not work for these programs but it works for the other ones. Try changing your computer date 6 months ahead, start the programs and then reboot, set the date back and start the programs again and you'll see it failing.

Look at your temp folder (%temp%) and read the amt3.log file and you'll see the reason of it failing.

Could someone crack the DLLs for both Acrobat/Distiller and Flash Builder?

Maybe other programs will need it also. I installed only the 32-bit apps."
,SkyNess,2012-04-30T18:37Z,"@hstpb
Yes adobe acrobat x doesn't work with the dll but if you want it i advise you to use this torrent

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6955640/ADOBE_ACROBAT_X_(10.1.2)_PRO_[thethingy]_

just remove the one installed with this torrent and replace by the one i provided"
,hstpb,2012-04-30T19:02Z,"Thanks SkyNess!

Should I just include Acrobat X during the CS6 install, and then replace the DLL with the ones provided at your torrent link? Is it?
Or should I remove the Acrobat X during the CS6 install, and then use that one to install it?

What about Flash Builder?
Is there a solution to it?

And did you find other programs in CS6 that is not working with current DLLs or other stuff?"
,SkyNess,2012-05-01T18:27Z,"@hstpb
You can install acrobat x and then uninstall, but if you want you can directly install the one of thethingy without install the one who is in this torrent. And for Flash Builder, i haven't got any solution.

Ps : sorry for my english i'm french :p"
