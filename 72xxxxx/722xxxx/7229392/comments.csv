Actually, there is no need of trackers anymore while uploading or downloading, thanks to the development of DHT and Peer Exchange.
So you need not fill anything on 'trackers' column while creating the torrent.
But utorrent fills in some default trackers, don't delete it. Just leave it as it is.
And i see a lot of people requested to seed you torrent file. Since you are the uploader, you have to seed a lot(say a ratio of 5. i.e., upload 5 times the original file size) so that the torrent is alive with other seeders.
Now that i've learnt to manually check my torrent pages in order to see new comments.(i thought i would get some kind of notifications). You do that too. 
Happy uploading and Good Luck :)"
