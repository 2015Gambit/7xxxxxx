Dolls - red or black, capsules or tablets, washed down with vodka or swallowed straight - are showbiz slang for tranquillizers, uppers and sleeping pills. For Anne, Jennifer and Neely, it doesnΓÇÖt matter how or which, as long as the pill bottle is within easy reach. A model, a singer and an actress become best friends when they are young and struggling at the bottom of their professions. By the time they reach the top, they discover thereΓÇÖs no place left to go but down - into the Valley of the Dolls.
