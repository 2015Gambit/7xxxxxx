,Dakota85,2012-06-07T16:14Z,"Hi Bryentheartist! Huge fan of your torrents but haven't been able to get password reset for ages so haven't been able to get in touch with you. I'll admit i'm trying to download when there's no seeds but I was also hoping you might know where I could buy a copy of BB Oz since there's no seeds? Email? By the way, i'm really grateful for all the torrents you comment with""Thanks"" on as I get unsure and seeing your comment shows its legit - has been amazing sometimes! Hope to hear from you! Dak in Oz :)"
