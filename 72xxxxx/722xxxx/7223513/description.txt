An incredible session from the legendary Tribe Records scene ΓÇô an equal effort from leader Doug Hammond and keyboardist David Durrah, who contributes some groundbreaking Fender Rhodes and moog work to the set! Hammond handles drums plus a bit of vocals and synthesizer on the session ΓÇô working alongside Durrah in a groove that mixes electric and acoustic instrumentation into a totally righteous sound with lots of heavy Afro Jazz leanings. A number of tracks feature great vocals from Hammond ΓÇô righteous, and with a beautifully souful message-oriented approach ΓÇô and a few other tracks, such as the classic "Space I" and "Space II", feature a sparer all-electric sound. The whole thing's wonderful ΓÇô skittishly rhythmic, warmly flowing, and righteously beautiful. Titles include "Sea Of Nurnen", "Fidalgo Detour", "Reflections", "Space" (I & II), and "For Real". CD also features 2 bonus tracks from singles ΓÇô "Kai" and "Venus Fly Trap".
