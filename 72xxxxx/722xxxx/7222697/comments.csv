,Xantex82,2012-04-30T02:12Z,"This version has a bug where the townies do not put materials and other goods in stockpiles or barrels. Personally I don't mind seeing tons of bread and junk all over the floor, but if that bothers you. I suggest you guys wait for .45a."

I haven't had that bug but there's a billion other bugs that pretty much make the patch not worth playing without .45a, heros dont explore the dungeon for you and a few others

the tree lag was fixed though, but townies got dumb (they path even worse, starve to death because they make tasks more important than eating)

at least hungerlock is fixed"

Anyways, here's 45b.
