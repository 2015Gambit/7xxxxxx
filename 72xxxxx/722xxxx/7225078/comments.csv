,sammyr2011,2012-05-03T21:27Z,@yendh download either utorrent or bitorrent.  after either is installed does not matter which come back to this pace and click on the magnet that says get this torrent and it will download automatically.  Once its done downloading you'll find the movie in your downloads folder.
