Louis Theroux: Extreme Love
Louis Theroux looks at the extreme pressures placed on relationships by conditions such as autism and dementia, meeting both those diagnosed and the people who love and care for them


1)  Autism 
Louis visits one of the best schools in America for autism. He meets the students and their families to get a glimpse of what life is like for them and to experience the pleasures and the strains of one of the most extraordinary kinds of relationship.

2)  Dementia 
Louis travels to Phoenix, Arizona - the capital of dementia care. He spends time at Beatitudes, a residential institution, and also with those looking after loved ones at home to try to understand the struggle of living in a world of encroaching shadows - and of keeping relationships alive in circumstances that can be among the strangest and most challenging imaginable.
