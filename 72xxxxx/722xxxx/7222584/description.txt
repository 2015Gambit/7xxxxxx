NOTA: This book is not exactly for the general reader but if you are one you may still benefit from the powerful ideas developed in this book by following the author's advice on how to approach it (excerpted from the preface):
"If you just want to get the gist of the argument without simultaneously taking a self-directed course in modern biology, I suggest reading the Introduction plus the beginning and concluding sections of each of the four parts of the book. If youΓÇÖre enticed into reading further, it is best to read each subsection until the discussion becomes too technical and then skip ahead until you land on a paragraph that makes sense. This approach implies accepting that I have accurately reported the science in the skipped material. I assure you that I have done so."
