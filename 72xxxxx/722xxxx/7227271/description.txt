A Marine travels to Louisiana after serving three tours in Iraq and searches for the unknown woman he believes was his good luck charm during the war.

NOTES:
WOW ....what a cam,only if all cams looked this good.Few little faults like some camera shaking now and again so their was thin borders on the sides ...the colours do change slightly in some scenes and also some glare on other scenes ....but overall one of THE best cams for a long time.
Audio was sweet for cam ...had some noise and was only mono,but clear and loud

Work done ,well video was just minor things altered,like brighthness contrast,rgb levels,chroma etc....but only small amounts changed.
Cropped the thin borders the best i could without chipping into the video....
Audio totally remastered and clean that ....had to change to stereo and then alter the EQ bands and then resave,and mux too our encode.

Overall ....for a cam "powerful" too use words of a friend ;-)
