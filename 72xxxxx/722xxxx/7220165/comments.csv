,therezhackerog,2012-04-27T06:59Z,dont freak out it is wbfs so you need the wii backup manager to use this file
,therezhackerog,2012-04-27T07:02Z,if you dont seed at least half i will no longer provide you with uploads
,therezhackerog,2012-04-27T07:05Z,NEVER USE IMGBURN IT WAS NOT MENT FOR Wii GAMES
,therezhackerog,2012-04-27T07:25Z,if you own a pal wii convert the wbfs to iso using wii backup manager then use a iso reagon manager to patch reagon to make it reagon free
,therezhackerog,2012-04-27T07:26Z,also use gecko os or gecko plugin if you need to

,therezhackerog,2012-04-29T20:47Z,i recommend using wiiflow or usbloaderGX to dump your own official Wii discs to a file format not intended for coppyright violation by piracy or for backing up games that you rent you must own them
