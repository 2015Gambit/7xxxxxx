Your video bit rate information is wrong.
The correct is 675 kb/s.

,cheapmonk,2012-07-05T17:06Z,"""Special edition"" means not the real Alien 3.
This version is bullshit :
- Alien is coming from a cow (dog in original)
- The Alien doesn't jump off Ripley at the end.

I hate this special, re-mastered, bullshited edition."
