,Alekvicious,2012-04-29T07:14Z,Thank You so much for this Cerebral222!! I mean it man I really appreciate you taking the time to put the pictures of the set up. For years Ive tried to get this PS2 emulator to work but I never got it to work. It would always crash on start up so I gave up. =}
,Cerebral222,2012-04-29T08:00Z,"@Alekvicious, good to see it kicked over for you, I hope you enjoy the game, Cheers."
,Alekvicious,2012-04-29T19:10Z,"Now I can play all the games I never got to play like Castlevania Curse of Darkness. Was just playing it with your configuration, works perfect. Thanks again!"
,Fernoth,2012-06-11T19:37Z,"it wont let me run the game, ill go into the emulator but i cant seem to find the game, any suggestions?"
,Cerebral222,2012-06-12T18:49Z,"@Fernoth, go to the CDVD section, then click on the Iso Selector, then direct the software to the iso file you want to emulate, after your selection, go to the System section, click on the Boot CDVD (fast) and game kicks over; you only need to do this one time and the next time it will remember the iso path, once you have done this a couple of times, it's like muscle memory; PCSX2 is the most simple emulator out there, once you toy around with the basics, it's very simple, but not all PS2 games can be emulated, so there is a limited range."
,Boodar,2012-06-17T19:57Z,Only complaint I got his fuck that 7 zip shit bro winrar is ftw! no better archiver out there. imo
,GoodGravy,2012-06-18T08:55Z,"@Boodar, Bullshit buddy, 7zip kicks ass over winrar, much better compression."
,Cerebral222,2012-06-18T10:32Z,"Yeah, 7zip is better, I used Winrar for years, but alot of people use 7zip, sometimes winrar gets errors opening 7zip files but I've never had that problem with 7zip opening winrar files, and yes 7zip has better compression, so, less for you to have to download."
,Mrthingus,2012-06-22T23:37Z,"I've managed to get the thing running, but it always tells me that Dualshock 2 is not detected. Is there a way around this?"
,Cerebral222,2012-06-23T13:28Z,"@Mrthingus, I've never had that problem, but try changing the LilyPad plugin:
