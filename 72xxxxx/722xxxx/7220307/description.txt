Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters is a platform game in the Ratchet & Clank series for both the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. It is the first Ratchet & Clank game on the PSP handheld, and the fifth, chronologically, in the series. It was developed by High Impact Games, a company spawning from the original Ratchet & Clank developer, Insomniac Games. The story is about Ratchet and Clank as they are interrupted from their vacation to search for a kidnapped girl and encounter a forgotten race known as the Technomites.

I played this on the PC, and it was better than playing it on PS2 (Sharper graphics), you can play this with on a chipped PS2, or on PC using the emulator, much better using PC with this game, thats why I put this in the PC game section.

Use the settings I have provided, if you have an old rig, you might want to play this game in software mode (Graphics not as good).

Compressed with 7zip, Scanned with Comodo IS, extract and play.

This is the NTSC PS2 version.
