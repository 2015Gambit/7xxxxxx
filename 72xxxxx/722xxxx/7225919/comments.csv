,Waikiki2008,2012-04-29T13:10Z,"baybeh, There is a full dvd Criterion of Spirit of the Beehive available on both TPB, and Demonoid. I downloaded it some time ago and the quality is very good. Take care."
[T],Auge,2012-04-29T18:35Z,"If therre is already a good DVD up here I can focus on harder to find things.
Here is the link Bahbey to the other DVD... it looks like it is seeded.
Let me know if this does not work for you and I will make mine avalable.

Also, Auge, could you upload the Criterion dvd's for The Red Shoes (1948) and Hitchcock's Notorious, if you have them? Many thanks."
