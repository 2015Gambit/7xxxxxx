,SA1NTMaYhEm,2012-04-30T05:10Z,"In your description title, the resolution is 720p.  The file information lists all these files as 1080p.  Which one is it?  I am confused.

BTW

@random-arrow:

Tetra-logy actually is a word in our English dictionary which is a series of four related works, such as an opera or drama.  It comes from the Greek word ""tetralogia"" which i assume would be a close relation in meaning.  Guess it's time to brush up on my Greek!

Look it up in a Websters Dictionary.  There are other meanings for Tetra-logy. "
