Translated from Lelis' bio at his official web site:

"(...) I always understood that what I felt for music
wasn't normal, that I wasn't just another kid who liked
music, but it was only at the age of about 16, when we
bought a PC for our home, that I had in my hands the ideal
tool to venture in the world of music production.

At the beginning it was all just for fun. (...) I carried
on with doing it for a while longer until I discovered, at
the age of 20, the side of house music that still
fascinates me: club or tribal house. (...)

The powerful vocals plus the absurd talent of such
producers as Thunderpuss, Junior Vasquez, Victor Calderone
and others really made me disbelieve what I was listening.
(...)

From that moment I truly found myself. I knew what I
wanted. That was when I started learning more about the
club house genre and improving my musical knowledge (...).
I've always been computer-savvy, which also helped me a lot
and allowed me to begin all the work you know today. (...)"
