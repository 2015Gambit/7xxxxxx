Narratives:

As the frontman and co-founder of rap-rock group Hollywood Undead, Deuce mastered the art of creating a catchy, anthemic song, complete with rebellious lyrics and hooks so catchy, they're stuck in the listener's head for days.

Now, after parting ways with Hollywood Undead, Deuce is going out on his own, and the singer, songwriter and producer has unchained his debut solo album, Nine Lives.

'Nine Lives' launches off with Let's Get it Crackin, an in-your-face, attitude-packed track with a thick drum beat and edgy guitars. Deuce goes in detail about his party-happy lifestyle in this track, and the song brings a brash, brazen mix of hip-hop, rock and swagger that's purpose-made for the club.
