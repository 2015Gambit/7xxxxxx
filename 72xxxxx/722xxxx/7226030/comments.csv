,yabolus,2012-05-01T09:21Z,Real? Is this 3d?
,samir1972,2012-05-01T11:15Z,"Thanks.
CAN SOMEONE CONFIRM THAT THIS IS REAL?
And if someone is capable to downsize the file, please do so. 22GB is quite big one..."
,yabolus,2012-05-02T23:42Z,"I downloaded this, it's real all right. As the title says, it's a remux, so you get the exact quality of the blu-ray, but it's only 2D. 

There are 3 audio tracks, 2.0 PCM, 5.1 AC3 and the monster uncompressed 7.1 Dolby True HD which sounds fucking sweet.

I had a constant 2MB/s, so big thanks to the seeders!"
,guccicar,2012-05-22T14:37Z,Yea I how can I get the Dolby True HD to play on my pc? Using PowerDVD 11.
,Ears14U,2012-08-03T05:52Z,"This was a real bugger to convert to WMV. I personally found Aiseesoft's Total Media Converter to work finally for me. And it is a super vid, with great audio!!! That's if you're a hard core Joe S. fan like me!!! Thanks Anonymous, whoever the heck you are!!! Please seed people!!!"
