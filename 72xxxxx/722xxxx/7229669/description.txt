                               The Complete Season 2


Breakout Kings is an American drama television series created by Nick Santora and Matt Olmstead, which airs on the A&E network.

In order to catch escaped convicts, a squad of U.S. Marshals makes a special deal with several current prisoners. If they agree to help, their sentences will be reduced by one month for each fugitive they bring in, and they will be transferred to a minimum-security facility. However, if any of them should try to escape, they will all be returned to their original prisons, and their sentences will be doubled.
