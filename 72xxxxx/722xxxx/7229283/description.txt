Dictionary of Environmental Science and Technology
Written by Prof. Andrew Porteous
4th Edition

From the introduction:
"This book is written in the hope that it may contribute to environmental literacy, by providing basic definitions and data plus demonstrate the nature of
the issues. Where appropriate, the technology and/or measures that are already
available to prevent pollution and aid resource conservation are outlined. As
our understanding of these becomes clearer, we may at least begin to appreciate
a number of things that we must obviously not do and that is a start of sorts."

From Amazon:
"It is forecast to continue as an indispensable reference." (Pollution, September 2000)

"...is the literary equivalent of a brain transplant." (Environment Business, November 2000)

"...Porteous' book will contribute to better understanding and protection of worldΓÇ▓s environment..." (Photosynthetica, Vol.40, No.2, 2002)
