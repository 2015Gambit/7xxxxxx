,Cor.IanS,2012-04-30T07:24Z,"I imagine most people got to 14.3% like me. The guy didn't seed it long enough for me to get it. If he ever does seed it, I promise to upload it for at least 4 days. Hopefully he does cause I want to watch this right now!"
,ehrlichseb,2012-04-30T16:44Z,"Like Ian, I'm also sitting @ 14% and really really want to watch this, the highlights and goals video only makes it worse!  Need to watch that hat trick in its full glory!  

OP please seed at least a couple more hours so I can get the complete file and I as well promise to seed!

,Cor.IanS,2012-04-30T19:03Z,@ehrlichseb You better be joking otherwise you're a serious douchebag that should delete your comment as to not ruin it for other people since you've ruined it for me.
,ehrlichseb,2012-04-30T22:58Z,"Woah buddy, what did I ruin? Any actual fan would know the results of their team's game regardless of having watched it or not.  

I said hat trick, I didn't say by whom nor the final score, if anything it's something to get excited to see.

I honestly apologize though if you feel cheated or that it was spoiled in any way, maybe hit your head really hard and you might forget you read that!"
,Cor.IanS,2012-05-01T01:40Z,True fans would prefer not to know the score as they wait to watch it on a torrent and not know the outcome. It is however my mistake for looking at the comments. I only did it because I wasn't getting past 14.3% but I should have known that people like yourself enjoy ruining other people's experience.
,ehrlichseb,2012-05-01T07:51Z,"You failed to answer how your experience is ruined. True fans my ass, a true fan follows their team via news sources even if they missed a game.

I know the exact minutes goals were scored and by whom, and I am still excited to watch the game. You obviously have no idea what a true fan is.
