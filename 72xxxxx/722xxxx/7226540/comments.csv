,chapter81,2012-06-19T00:47Z,"I recommend the uploaders to incorporate this hint until the problem is solved (if it's going to be solved, I mean).

INSTAL -> FIRST RUN AS TRIAL -> EXIT THE PROGRAM -> REPLACE .DLL FILE.

Not doing so (patching before first run) will deactivate some functions.

Spread the word!"
,tylerawesome,2012-06-20T20:50Z,can you make one for 32 bit?
[T],Ching_Liu,2012-06-22T07:27Z,@tylerawesome - Oh no! I can not do it. Adobe has not sopported 32 bit in the versions CS6 and CS5. You should use CS4 or lower.
,SkyJizz,2012-06-30T08:15Z,Thankyou so much ching
,Doytr55,2012-07-01T20:45Z,"This torrent is flawless! Thanks a bunch! 

I just turned off my internet before I did anything, then just followed the instructions in the .NFO file word for word and the installation went perfect! 
(I'm running a 64 bit system)

Thanks again Ching_Liu!"
