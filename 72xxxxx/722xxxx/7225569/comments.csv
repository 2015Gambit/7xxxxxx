,undercover1234,2012-04-29T11:40Z,"OcenNanners.. I totally agree somone needs to upload RE/Sail.. It is just a awesome album. Hello, l3endik!

You have two options here: 

1. Upload Awolnation - RE/Sail in 256 kbps iTunes Rip

2. I tip iTunes/apple about someone are uploading their songs to TPB? We donÂ´t want that to happen do we? (I have your iTunes account =P) "
