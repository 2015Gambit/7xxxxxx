Strangeland is the fourth studio album by East Sussex band Keane, and the first from the four-piece since Perfect Symmetry in 2008. The album was produced by Dan Grech-Marguerat and was inspired in part by his work with New York indie band The Vaccines, with Keane aiming for a more back-to-basics sound based on songwriting rather than production. Strangeland features the single 'Silenced by the Night'.
