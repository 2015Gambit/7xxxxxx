Crime Investigation Australia returns with a brand new series,
Families of Crime giving insight into some of Australia√Üs most
infamous   crime  families   who  wielded   power,  fear   and
destruction through the  community. Each episode  will explore
how they became criminals  and look into their  personal lives
and backgrounds  through interviews,  associates, victims  and
the  investigators who  attempted to  bring them  to justice.
Through the  use of  archival footage  and re-enactments,  the
programs will set the scene of where and what they controlled,
how they built their  crime kingdoms, the murderous  lifestyle
they led and the legacies they left behind.
