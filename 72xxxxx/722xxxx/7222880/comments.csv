,Jim090,2012-04-28T18:11Z,":) thanks for your time I really appreciate it!! Well yes there is already a discografy but its not complete... the compilation albums are missing and some of the songs in these albums are slightly different.For example in the song flaming telepaths the intro used to have some sort of keyboard and in    
Don't Fear the Reaper: The Best of Blue Ă&#x2013;yster Cult doesn't have it anymore(better I think).Also some other songs have been digitally remaster.... Most importantly I was hoping for your rips which are way better than others.... anyway thanks again and if you have these compilation albums please upload them!!!"
