Synopsis: Hiroshi Inagaki's acclaimed "Samurai Trilogy" is based on the
novel that has been called Japan's Gone with the Wind. This sweeping
saga of the legendary seventeenth–century samurai Musashi Miyamoto
(powerfully portrayed by Toshiro Mifune) plays out against the turmoil
of a devastating civil war. The Trilogy (whose first part won an
Academy Award) follows Musashi's odyssey from unruly youth to
enlightened warrior. In the third installment, Duel at Ganryu Island,
Musashi reunites tragically with the women who love him, and battles
for samurai supremacy in a climactic confrontation with his lifelong
nemesis.

               Notes: Someone at Criterion should be spanked for this
                      DEFT–Conversion! Unlike other releases, motion is
                      fluent. Only some very few blends remain.
