,kluelos,2012-04-29T06:11Z,"Velvet, that torrent has multiple bogus provenance files included. There's no need to do that unless they're trying to convince people that something is legitimate (allowed on Demonoid, e.g.) when it's really not. Trusted uploader or not, that shouldn't be done by anyone honest.

If nothing else, I appreciate 700daz' stripping all of the ads and extra garbage out, and think he should be praised/encouraged for doing that.

If you don't want your torrents taken out from under you, don't do crap like that to them.  If you insist on it, don't complain when somebody does a public service and strips your crap out, for the benefit of the rest of us.

""Torrent whore"" is about the most ridiculous term I've ever heard, considering that it was all stolen in the first place -- the thief asserting ownership rights where he himself respects none. Please keep the hypocrisy down to a manageable level."
