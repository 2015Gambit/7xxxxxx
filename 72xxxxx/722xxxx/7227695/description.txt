Torus EP and Sonic Router MIX




There are 2 artists with the name Torus:

1. Joeri Woudstra, who hails from the Netherlands. He released his debut, self-titled EP, on the Sonic Router imprint, on the 12th March 2012. 6 tracks long itΓÇÖs a deft exploration of mood that sets a torrent of found samples, ambient swirls and little wayward riffs to post-Dilla drum patterns. ItΓÇÖs hazy, crackly hangover music. A collection of tracks that manage to sound archaic before theyΓÇÖve even been mixed down, fusing WoudstraΓÇÖs unique approach to production with a sense of isolation and introspection.
