I am contacting you on the behalf of Mr. Alan Watt of Cutting Through the Matrix, cuttingthroughthematrix.com.  By persistently & repeatedly posting Anonymously the only FOR SALE material on Mr. Watt's site, one can only assume your intentions are not good.  

There are over 1000 hours of FREE audio and transcripts available at:
http://cuttingthroughthematrix.com/audio.html

And:
http://cuttingthroughthematrix.com/transcripts_Alan_Watt.html

The only reason you would be posting this material, is to undercut the website's funding.    


Thank you, for chosing to be a conscientious, honest individual in advance, by removing this content."

,toridfor,2012-05-09T07:54Z,"Absolutely brilliant reading material.  RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD!

Alan really has taken the time to compile an excellent history with pictures and helpful pointers to aid the reader to get a much better view of the history and the world in the making.

Fascinating book and a great interview video which I keep repeating - Alan is totally on the game, he is so very apt and to-the-point on everything.

If you watch Alex Jones from time to time, if you have heard of David Icke, Charlie Veech, Bill Cooper, George Carlin, the Illuminati or you are just curious of a hidden world history, then this download is for you.

Many thanks to the uploader."
