,uritziel,2012-05-01T00:49Z,"Thank you extremezone, amazing audio and video quality...

The movie though, is not as badass as The Exorcism of Emily Rose, IMHO the exorcism of emily rose is the most proper horror demon related movie that  i've ever seen in my entire life."

,THE_SK1TZ,2012-05-01T08:17Z,"No BluRay yet? I mean, I cannot complain, its is TPB after all. However does anyone think a BluRay rip will be uploaded within a couple days? If so, I will just wait for the High Res file. Otherwise I can just say screw it and download this DVDRip now."

,hopedeny,2012-06-24T04:34Z,"pfft. all these comparisons to the exorcist. people are calling THIS boring? the exorcist is the most boring, plodding, overrated movie of all time. A few good scenes don't make a shitty movie great."
,Pdid,2012-07-20T23:12Z,This movie is not good! It is possessed by a bad movie demon!
,noranium,2012-07-25T13:56Z,"hey guys ,i have the same prob with the PS3 !! yet i realized that it plays 1 audio channel (mp3), everything else ive tried was 2 channel (mp3) ,you can check it when u press select then look at the top right .. im not that good with these things but that could be the problem i guess .. best solution is to get a better version .
