They use 624*352 @ 23.976 fps and the sound is 128 Kbps.
You chose 704*396 @ 25 fps and the sound is 123 Kbps.
Also which file did you use to convert to create this file?"
,Digital_Orfanz,2012-04-30T22:38Z,"To tell the truth I didnt pay that much attention to the settings.  There were 3 shows I was going to post if they were not avail in XviD and I wanted to seed each one to 10 and not take all day about it.  Plus I was still searching to make sure there werent actual XViDs for them.

In my rush, I guess I didnt check the vframe size...it should not matter on most DVD players, it just makes a difference in the file size vs fps balance.   Ditto for FPS.  

The audio though was encoded as 128 VBR, so the AVERAGE is 123.  

I'll try to pay more attention if/when I post any other orphaned eps...like I said I was rushing.

...oh, the encoder is my own concoction I started when they announced they were dropping XviDs.  MP4s CAN be better quality in a smaller file, but they also seem to vary a great deal in vibrancy."
,Tallyortoby,2012-05-01T01:09Z,"Thanks for your answer. I grabbed the 625 Meg file Nurse.Jackie.S04E04.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE.mkv and convert it with eRightSoft SUPER. Want to see if I get a much different size then yours.
Keep up the good work. I did what you did for Top Gear.
What I never understood is why they decided on the change in the middle of seasons.
If the would have done that starting the new seasons I think a lot of people would have accepted it much better."
,Tallyortoby,2012-05-01T03:05Z,After conversion my file was only 208 Megs so I will keep yours
,Digital_Orfanz,2012-05-01T03:05Z,"Wow, I started with a 201MB 720*404 MP4.H263 source.  The goofy size I used is prolly the result of actual DVD VOB mind set - VOBs report a size of 704*480 but the video frames are actually 704*420.  That must have stuck in my mind and set the width to 704 with a proportional height.  I didnt notice the result was 704*396 or it would have rung a bell that something was wrong.

I like the quality in the MKVs but I think the bloated size far exceeds that increase. 

""The Scene"" (actually just a few Big Swinging Dorks among them) changed because they can.  A few like FQM still release XviD, but they dont release everything (at least that I want).  They dont do it as a 'service' for us, they do it for themselves and prolly trade among themselves.  That we get any of them at all is the result of leaks...places like EZTV get them and arrange super seeders.

""The Scene"" prolly have mostly cutting edge media servers and the like that can use H264, so some changed since THEY dont like AVI anymore.  Leaves us with state of t art DivX DVD players a bit in the dark, though.

*I* wonder what the response will be the next time there is a SOPA type thing pending and these same jerks are begging for the public to chime in (again).

Take Care..."
,Digital_Orfanz,2012-05-01T03:16Z,"The file size is not a big concern anymore except for bandwidth.  Originally, a 1 hr show (~42mins actually) was ""supposed"" to be 350MB and a half hr (~20 mins sans commercials) show 175MB so that 2 or 4 of them could fit on a CD.  Since most modern DivX/XviD players now (also) work off a USB drive, size is not important anymore.

When I convert a MP4, I use about the same video bit rate as the source - any LESS and you will lose quality, but increasing the bit rate just increases the file size with no quality improvement.  So, I dont slave to get it exactly at 175/350 because it is pointless unless you are rendering the source capture."
,LizzyB,2012-05-02T11:01Z,"I don't know much about formats and all that, I do know that 264 does not work on my XBOX. So I wanted to say I appreciate you uploading Nurse Jackie and the Big C in xvid. My whole family watches these 2 shows, So normally I would just watch them on my computer. So thank you :) I appreciate you taking the time to upload. I will make sure to seed."
,adamsMR,2012-06-07T20:05Z,"Thanks for this format, I cannot watch .264 / mkv files on my powerBook G4 unless I upgrade my system or convert the files. Much appreciated."
,kodos44,2012-07-06T02:59Z,I think audio and video are out of phase with each other...
