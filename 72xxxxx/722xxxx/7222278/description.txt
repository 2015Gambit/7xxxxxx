Plot..........: He Has Seen War is a documentary featuring surviving 
                veterans of Easy Company and the 1st Marine Division, 
                whose stories are told in Band of Brothers and The Pacific. 
                From their initial steps at reintegrating into civilian 
                life to the lasting impact the war had on each of their 
                lives, He Has Seen War features veterans and their 
                families relaying their own unique stories. Complemented
                by renowned historian and author Donald L. Miller, as
                well as rarely seen archival and documentary footage, it
                captures the struggle and ultimate triumph of a generation
                who, after helping rescue the world from unprecedented 
                calamity, reclaimed their lives and re-forged a country.
