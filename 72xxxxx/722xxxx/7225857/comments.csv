There is this thing out there for your computer. It is called a Firewall. It's really cool. It blocks virus's. *rolls eyes*"

,adyc80,2012-04-29T15:45Z,"thanks uploader, Btw Skirascal your firewall doesnt block viruses from a torrent you download as you have given your permission to download it. Firewall only blocks things you dont ask for."
[V],maximersk,2012-04-29T16:27Z,"The virus... it's you ! LOL
Enjoy this movie, dudes ! "

,kmitak,2012-04-29T19:11Z,"Please don't download and run, People need to seed for a while for others to be able to download"
,prefix911,2012-04-29T20:31Z,"don't you just hate those that download and run.
The other guy is seeding for you to download...
do the same for the next guy."
,Fritz.,2012-04-29T20:50Z,"video 6
audio 4

its watchable, but its not ""good"".

there are a couple sections where they just clipped scenes out, im guessing due to poor audio and video, and then for the rest of the movie you can hear candy wrappers and the audience louder than the movie."
[V],maximersk,2012-04-29T20:54Z,"Yeah, kmitak is right ! People must be seeding all files on Internet ! hee hee
Screw You, ACTA, PIPA and SOPA ! I poo off all them !!!!"

Scarlett's arse was like an inch off my face , could nearly lick it . 
If you have the spare 8 quid , go see it  . If you don't have the money try and wait for a better copy to give it some justice . "
,alanrj1974,2012-04-30T06:57Z,"good CAM, but NO EXTRA SCENE AFTER CREDITS."

,michaelrwatson,2012-05-03T05:02Z,"Hey Hollywood/FBI: I wasn't planning to see this in theatres (and couldn't afford to anyway). Thus, you aren't losing any money by my downloading it (or by most other people who are downloading it). Yes, i might have rented the DVD, but i probably will anyway, and even if i don't (because i watched this free download instead), i'll rent something else instead. So, still not losing any money! Hence, instead of wasting taxpayer money suing TPB, go kill yourself. Better yet, go catch some terrorists or help repair the highways or something."
,arunjs,2012-05-04T07:24Z,Can I please have the subtitle for this movie?
,EduardoRT,2012-05-05T02:22Z,"@michaelrwatson:
I'm now against sharing but I know it isn't harmless, yes when you download a money you aren't robbing them directly but you still watched a movie that should be an income to them, it doesn't matter if they already got a lot of money or not, just imagine that this movie was made by a starting producer and half of their customers are downloading it illegaly, that means that he is getting half profit."
,luciano.duarte,2012-05-05T18:33Z,"V=1

,ChasUGC,2012-05-08T03:32Z,"A=7,V=7 good cam. Definitely watchable. Can't wait to see the DVD rip. Awesome fight scenes. Started slow but finished great. The Hulk was bad ass."
