Bluegrass gospel doesn't get better than this. While Ms. Harris can sing any type of music she chooses to, she is never better than when she does these simple country/bluegrass traditional numbers. I'm sure that city folk will like most of these songs on first hearing. For those of us who grew up in country churches, they go straight to the heart and quickly carry us back to our childhoods. Ms. Harris plays acoustic guitar on this CD and is joined on the vocals by Vince Gill, Carl Jackson and Emory Gordy. These male voices complement Ms. Harris' high, otherworldly soprano voice that is recognizable immediately.
