"Leave it to Beavers"

As Nick delves into the trailer's 
weapons cabinet and his inner Grimm, 
the investigation of a dead 
construction worker leads him into a 
long standing conflict in the 
creature world. Sensing an 
unfamiliar threat, the suspect takes 
it upon himself to summon reapers to 
town to eliminate the Grimm once and 
for all. Meanwhile, Juliette insists 
that Nick invite Monroe Mitchell) 
over for dinner, making for quite 
the interesting evening.
