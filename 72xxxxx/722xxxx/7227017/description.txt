Plot
   In the 4th installment of the Mission Impossible series, Ethan Hunt and his 
team are racing against time to track down a dangerous terrorist named 
Hendricks, who has gained access to Russian nuclear launch codes and is planning 
a strike on the United States. An attempt by the team to stop him at the Kremlin 
ends in a disaster, with an explosion causing severe destruction to the Kremlin 
and the IMF being implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to invoke 
Ghost Protocol, under which the IMF is disavowed, and will be offered no help or 
backup in any form. Undaunted, Ethan and his team chase Hendricks to Dubai, and 
from there to Mumbai, but several spectacular action sequences later, they might 
still be too late to stop a disaster.
