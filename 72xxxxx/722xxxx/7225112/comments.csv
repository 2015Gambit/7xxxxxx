No, this is NOT just an exe file.  Think of a compressed rar file that is made into an exe.

So run the torrent download and it will uncompress into several folders.  There is a file ""installing instructions.txt"" will have all the info you will need to install and get CS6 activated.  This release uses dll files rather than a patch.

Be sure to download ""Adobe Tool"" this patches the hosts file for you automatically.  Nice touch Thingy!"

This also worked for me, on win7 64. Just deactivate internet connection, so when you start PS with the original dlls it won't ask you to sign-in your Adobe ID. Start it, start trial and then close it. Then you can turn on the internet connection again, and change the dll to the provided =) Thanks Thethingy"

__________________

1.  Download the torrent and extract the exe file

2.  Download the Adobe Tool file (as the thingy said this is not ready yet for CS6 so just use it to patch the hosts file)  The hosts file must be patched to prevent Adobe from phoning home. Patch the hosts before installing CS6.  Close the Adobe Tool program.

3.  Disconnect from the internet and install the (included) CS6 trial.  Open photoshop after the install the close it.

4.  Find the (included) dll file.  There will be TWO dll: ONE for 32 bit and and a different dll for 64 bit.  If your computer is 32 bit then use only the 32 bit dll.   

5.  Copy the dll file to TWO different places:

AdobeAdobe Photoshop CS6 folder and
AdobeAdobe Bridge CS6 folder

6.  WHERE you will copy this (included) dll file will depend on if you have 32 bit or 64 bit.  There are instructions included in the torrent download.  Read them then go find where these folders are.  

7.  If you goof this up the torrent includes the original dll files to make it like it was.  Then you can try again.

8.  After copy and REPLACING the dll into the folders you can restart CS6 and also reconnect to the internet.

Hope this helps."

,dpalme,2012-04-30T00:16Z,"1.Download the torrent 

2.Extract the contents with 7zip or winrar

3.Disconnect the internet

4.Run as adminstrator

5.choose the language

6.say I have a key
                 use the following serials:


              1325-0949-2080-9819-3777-3230

              1325-0160-5283-9851-2671-8951

7.it says no active internet connection, say validate later

8.wait till the installation is over

9.edit the hosts file or use the one i have uploaded

10.for x86 run the app it should show the same screen as mine; close it then replace dll file/ 

11.for x64 bit users better replace the dll file for x86 and run the x64 Photoshop and the viceversa it should show the same screen as mine and later replace dll files for both x86 and x64

reconnect to internet 

thats it that should be fine cheers lol

,MonkeyBizz,2012-04-30T08:10Z,sweet i got it working 1 more question wicth DLL do i copy and paste? Original 64 bit folder or the one folder that just say 64bit. sorry im a noob.
,soahs,2012-04-30T09:14Z,"@MonkeyBizz the instructions say to paste the dlls everywhere there is a ""amtlib.dll"" - just to be safe.

Do yourself a favor and get that great great little search program ""Everything Search""

ES says on my computer I have this file in two folders.  So I pasted them in the folders that showed on ES.  

My computer is 32 bit so I had to choose the 32 bit dll file (there is only one 32 bit dll).

For those that have a 64 bit computer, note the folders where ES finds this dll file.  In a 64 bit computer, software programs will go into a certain place.  And 32 bit software programs will go in a different place.

So what you do is choose the 64 bit dll (again, there is only one 64 bit dll to choose from) then install that 64 bit dll where 64 bit CS6 is.  ONLY if your CS6 is 64 bit.  If not use the 32 bit dll.

Now:  besides CS6 you might also have CS5 installed too, or even CS4.  CS6 might be 64 bit and CS5 32 bit.  So what you do is to paste the 32 bit dll in each folder Photoshop 32 bit is installed.  Same with the 64 bit but you must paste the 64 bit file if 64 bit CS6 is installed.

This is why Everything Search is so great.  Just search for ""amtlib.dll"" and it will tell you where these are.  Don't forget there are TWO folders to paste the one dll in.  Read the instructions and with ES you can find these right away and explore the path."

I used a trial version before this version, delete the trial version but keeps the the way you set your PS up. I do not know the word in English, but this worked great, even your actions will still work.

I worked with your tool, this gave me a virus warning, but hey, this is thethingy, so I ignored it. It makes live very easy.

Unless you put the blocks in your hosts file yourself to prevent Photoshop from phoning home, Adobe Tool can do so automagically.  There is a link to download AT in thethingy's files that came along with CS6.

Should you use Win Patrol?  Everybody should.  This is freebie commercial program with the pay version offering several more features.  The one with the little Scottie dog that barks whenever something tries to get into the startup folder.  New browser addons.  Newly installed Window Services.  Changes to hosts file.  And I had to deny several times when installing CS6 as it kept trying to get into the startup..

http://www.winpatrol.com/compare.html

Just a guess, but the error you are getting I googled and it can be caused by dll files.  You could have put a 64 dll in a 32 place and vica versa.  Either with CS6 or another program.  From what I read about this error it sounds like a Windows problem rather than a CS6 problem."

,ilarij,2012-05-02T07:46Z,"First of all, thank you, The Thingy, for this release. Installation worked like a charm.

But (yes, there's always that 'but') when I try to open images from Bridge to Raw Converter (Ctrl + R), Bridge crashes every single time. Or if I try to open Camera Raw Preferences, Bridge crashes immediately. Also, if I browse some folders, where are something else than images, Bridge crashes.

I think that problem is not in the Raw Converter, because it works fine when you open image directly from Photoshop. Maybe it's AMTlib.dll file in Bridge folder, because originally it's not the same in Bridge and Photoshop, but you have to use same cracked file in both in this release."

Never put a 64 bit dll to a 32 bits Bridge or PS.
C:Program Files (x86)(x86) means the 32 bits version
C:Program FilesAdobeAdobe Bridge CS6 means the 64 bits version.
That goes for all your programs. C:Program Files (x86) is the 32 bits and C:Program Files the 64 bits. 

Use the tool to block adobe with your host or do it yourself. Install the trial version, I only install the 64 bits version. Run the trial. Then replace the dll's. 

It is really not that difficult, do not give up!"

1. Disconnet Internet
2. Install the program
3. Open cs6 in trial mode 
4. Close cs6
5. Go to the thethingy dll file and copy the amtilib 32 bits you installed the 32 version of cs6, ot the 64 bits if you installed the 64 version.

6. If your windows is 64 bits and you installed the 64 bits cs6 you have to:

Go to C - program files - adobe - adobe photoshop cs6 and paste and replace the amtilib.dll (when you choose paste it immediately gives you the option paste and replace).
Go to C - program files - adobe - adobe bridge cs6 - and paste and replace the amtilib.dll

7. If your windows is 32 bits, you have to install the 32 bits cs6, and the steps are the same as above.

8. If your windows is 64 bits and you installed the 32 bits cs6, you have to do the same as above but the path are:

c - program files (86) - adobe - adobe photoshop cs6 - paste and replace dll
c - program files (86) - adobe - adobe brige cs6 - paste and replace dll

9. If you have windows 64 bits and installed the 32 and 64 bits cs6, you have to do the step 6 and 8.

then run the crack as given by k0r according to your os type

Being as you have to install this as a Trial you're missing features. For instance all the ""artisitic"" Filter effects are missing when you install this as a trial, and a few other things are missing too. 

The Thingy always does this shit! He done the same with CS5 and it was pointed out then. If you want the FULL Photoshop CS6 then you NEED to install it using a serial. Using Trial mode will install PS CS6 with missing features and filter effects. "
,Dirk_07,2012-05-09T00:15Z,"This is not the real thing. Other dan adobe PhotoShop CS5 Extended and adobe PhotoShop CS5.1 Extended there are missing various capabilities of the program.

The cause of this is the new adobe applicationmanager wich doesn't allow you to put in a serial without internet connection.

Adobe PhotoShop CS5 Extended and Adobe PhotoShop CS5.1 Extended can be cracked without a cracked amtlib.dll ( signature in that file is changed ). This torrent uses a cracked dll file and various 3D functions aren't available and updating of the program or deactivating it is only possible when you have a degree in computing.

When you in the menu System info when adobe photoshop cs6 is installed you can see that it only is an evaluation version in spite of not seeing the 'reminder screen'

In my opinion uploaded to fast without good and flawless crack.

In spite of that thx for your efforts Thingy.

Keep up the good work."

I can assure this the fully functioning CS6 extended with 3d and all filters working(check out jpeg)http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7211/7161321870_b946d2e327_b.jpg
What you have do is disable antivirus and disconect from internet,install as trial close program then open and close.Then copy the dll into the cs6 directory and now copy&paste the host file in system32/drivers/etc/host.

No it's not the full version. Yes the method to install this works, and i have 'extended' version and the 3D effects. 

But theres still missing things like the ""Artistic"" or ""Brush Strokes"" or ""Texture"" filter effects, just got to the Filter menu and have a look! None of these filter sub menu's are there when they should be. The ONLY way to get these effects is to install Photoshop CS6 using a serial. This has been the case with previous versions as well. Using Trial mode does NOT install everything, and it's been this way for years, people should know this by now!"

@diamonddogs

You're right! They've just moved these filters lol. They used to be directly under the Filter menu. I assumed they wasn't there at all because previous versions of Photoshop did not install everything when you installed it as a Trial. 

So anyway, this works perfectly then. Everything is there. I take back what i said before! :)"

,soahs,2012-05-11T18:54Z,"@mboss I'm not sure what to think of your post/ fix.  In case newbies would fall for it, I would advise them and anyone else not to download.  I have an extra computer, downloaded your fix and ran it in a sandbox.

After clicking on the exe file (only that one file was in the download) all that happened a flag appeared waving in the breeze.  That's it.  

Just to be totally safe I put an image of my operating system back afterwards.

I don't know what you are trying to do, but as thethingy has provided us with the original dll files to fix any Extended problem, your fix isn't needed.  And I am suspicious that you would go to all the trouble of providing a flag waving in the breeze when simply restoring the original dll fixes the problem."
,pnonsense,2012-05-11T22:53Z,"First of all, I just wanted to say thank thethingy. All of your uploads are amazing. Thank you for your hard work and dedication. I downloaded the torrent and followed the instructions and everything worked fine at first. However, now it opens up and I get this message ""Photoshop detected graphics hardware that is not officially supported. If you experience problems, please uncheck the Use Graphics Processor checkbox in the Performance panel of the preferences dialog."" After I exit out of that window and try to open up any picture, my computer notifies me that photoshop has stopped working and it immediately freezes up and exits out of Photoshop. I have no idea what is wrong? I even tried to uninstall and reinstall and the same thing is happening. Somebody please help? :/"

,soahs,2012-05-13T18:17Z,"All you have to do is to install Service Pack 3 for XP.  There are two problems however:  If you don't already have SP2 then SP3 won't install so you will have to do SP2 first then 3.  The other problem, if you do install a service pack on top of XP, it will demand to be activated/ registered, whatever.  As you already have a legitimate (probably) XP on your laptop you might not have a problem with activating.  But I would take no chances:

Make sure to get Acronis True Image or Macrium Reflect and make an image if you want to try installing a SP on XP.  If anything happens you can restore the image.

One of the pirate bay torrents also has a working crack for this.  Just do a TPS for ""service pack 3 for Windows""

I think wpa kill is still around too.  But I wouldn't even attempt to put on service packs until I made an image."

,shadesofgrays,2012-05-25T02:27Z,"From what I saw at the link @soahs linked, the video opening problem IS a problem with it being a pirated copy; the site indicated that the error message is a product of a corrupted dll file, specifically ones that fall under the licensing category.

,diamonddogs,2012-05-25T09:26Z,"@shadesofgrays,
You say the video problem is down to it being a pirated copy,so how come i can open up a video and edit it and render it it cs6 with no problem.
I also don't get excessive use of the cpu when using cs6."
,Elbichu,2012-05-25T22:49Z,"For those of you having trouble installing CS6, This is the right way to get Extended
 1. Disable the internet and any antivirus you might have
 2. Install Photoshop CS6 as TRIAL 32 or 64
 3. Run the program as Trial, and then close it.
 4. Replace the DLL file by copy and paste from the DLL folder 32 or 64 to where the CS6 is installed. C:Program Files/Adobe
 5. Reboot your system, and ENJOY..CS6 Extender....
 If you have a CS5, you dont have to unistall it... "
,shadesofgrays,2012-05-26T02:54Z,"@diamonddogs
Interesting. Did you do the install any differently? That was just my opinion from the things I'd read, but it made sense considering how many times I uninstalled and reinstalled and kept trying different ways but never got the video files to open.
Who knows, maybe you just have a special computer."

Copy&paste the host notepad into windows/system32/drivers/host,there is a short video tutorial there.
Nothing special about my laptop os is windows 7 64bit.Maybe if you uninstall and reinstall again you mght get it work,also run some sort of adobe clean tool.Good luck!
The only problem i had was the bridge would'nt open up raw files,but someone told me to replace the dll with the original one and it fixed it."

,soahs,2012-05-26T18:28Z,"@shadesofgrays
From what I saw at the link @soahs linked, the video opening problem IS a problem with it being a pirated copy; the site indicated that the error message is a product of a corrupted dll file, 

I took this link to mean that Dynamic Libraries is a whole subset and any file in there can get corrupted.  Just like sometimes Windows font files can get corrupted and can cause some operating problems.

If the dll in this torrent was causing problems then you would think most downloaders would be having the same problem but that is not the case.

Here is another explanation that might explain things more.  Might be something as simple as the wrong version of a dll.

And here are a couple programs to fix, don't know how reliable they are."
,diamonddogs,2012-05-26T19:08Z,"@soahs,
I'm not sure but i think all the people having trouble using the video option cs6  have'nt edited the host file as per ""thethingy's"" instructions.
It just does'nt make sense that some people like myself and you can get the video option to work and countless other people can get it to work.
But a small minority can't, i bet it's because they have'nt edited the host file."

,chrisdave1,2012-05-27T13:27Z,"@diamonddogs, i just followed everything that 'soahs' said on page 3...

i did it carefully step by step.... yet i still can't open the vid files... can you post your own steps here?

btw, i used 'Adobe Tools' to patch the hosts or w/e that is."
,diamonddogs,2012-05-27T15:49Z,"@chrisdave1,
These are the steps i took to install.
1. Disconnect internet
2. Disable av(but i did leave windows defender on)
3. install CS6 as trial version
4. Open CS6 then close CS6
5. Copy&paste the dll into CS6 directory(64 bit in my case)
6. Edit the hostfile(There is a video tutorial in one of the folders)
7. Restart pc
8. Enable av and reconnect internet.

After i followed all these steps i opened up CS6 and there it was cs6 extended.I checked out 3d and the video editing and all is working fine.
The only problem i had was the Bridge would'nt open up raw files(nef)but was instructed to copy&paste the original dll into the Bridge directory and it fixed it."

Sorry my mistake your right there is no hostfile video tutorial,i got mixed up it was in an elements 10 program i've got.
Anyway this is how to edit the hostfile.
1. Go to windows/system32/drivers/etc
2. Copy&paste the hostfile to the desktop
3. Open hostfile with notepad
4. Open folder in ""thethingys"" upload named ""Adobe CS6 Instructions""
5. Inside is a notepad named""AdobeCS6Instructions""open this
6. Copy&paste the hostfile you've just opened and paste it into the hostfile you've got open on the desktop and click file and save
7. Now copy&paste the desktop host file back into windows/system32/drivers/etc, where you will be given the option to replace the file click that and your done
8. Restart pc."

The first thing I did was download the torrent and  as soon as I did that I disconnected the internet.

2. I installed and then opened and press trial and let it install, I then closed it. 
3. I copied and pasted the 62 bit file (not original) from the DILL folder into the adobe photoshop and into bridge. I clicked ""add and ""REPLACE""

4. I restarted the computer then got a message that said socked #001394 something like that ""HOST NOT FOUND"" I opened photoshop and it worked perfectly and it says photoshop extended version will end in 30 days but at the bottom it says ""continue trial"" and I have NOT pressed that.

IF I DON'T PRESS CONTINUE TRIAL THEN WILL IT ALLOW ME TO KEEP USING IT AS LONG AS I NEVER BEGIN THE TRIAL.
IF NOT CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT I'M DOING WRONG? :d

Like I said I copied and pasted the 64 amtlib.dll to the adobe photoshop and bridges and replaced. 

Let me know please thank you all :)"
,real-d,2012-05-28T07:36Z,"okay, take what I said back, I got how to do it, but what about the 3-D options?
I'm confused do you shut off your computer after you install and open then close p.s.
and THEN you can add the dill files once the computer is restarted?
I'm thinking that's affecting the 3-D options, does anyone know?"

1.Disconnect from internet
2.Install desired adobe program in trial mode (no serial needed)
3.When setup is finished copy cracked amtlib.dll and copy it in installation folder... except for Photoshop it must opened and closed before putting in the amtlib.dll ""internet must be disconnected still and you must start trial and close out"" before you replace amtlib.dll if want to have Photoshop Extended!
4.Encore must be disconnected from internet and then it will ask for serial just copy one of the following serials from above and click next. It will then ask you to connect later, or connect now, click connect later. Then start it trial mode. It will say you have 30 days... Close out of Encore and copy the amtlib.dll to Encore install directory. Done!
5.Open hosts file: Windowssystem32driversetc
6.Add these lines, save it and reconnect after this:

Try it on a 64 bit system with something else than XP.

The 3D option doesnt showe on my XP 32bit..( and didnt tested the video editor.
I think adobe company from now on will release only 64 bit software ..:( Becomes a shit company which forces ppl to use/buy 64bit systems.I wouldnt support adobe and buy their products never because they dont make good software anymore compatible with 32bit..Adobe doesnt care that more than 50% of computers from the world are still 32bit.."

,Roboko,2012-06-04T06:31Z,"Well, I'm having a pretty bad issue right now. Let me tell you my problem:

1- I install Photoshop as said (instal trial, open trial, shut down internet, replace .dll files, add hosts, turn on the internet, open Photoshop again).

2- Photoshop opens well, no trial nor serial number is asked.

3- BUT when I try to open a file/create a new one a message appears 'ADOBE PHOTOSHOP CS6 STOPED WORKING AND NEEDS TO BE CLOSED'.

So, I just can't do anything with it, I have to close it.

INFO: When I installed the program, I only had the 64 & the 86bit options. I have not a 32bit version, so I only changed the 64bit .dll files, obviously.
When I open the program, I open the 64bits one (the one I could change).

Maybe I should need the 64 and 32bit versions only? How could I erase the 84bit then?

Thank you very much in advance, guys. I'm desperated ;_;"

,iMars666,2012-06-08T10:01Z,"This is the EXTENDED version. If you are not getting Extended its because you FAIL. You must copy the .DLL files to ALL the right folders.

When you install the 64bit version, it installs the 32bit version also. So COPY all the 32bit .DLL to the right folder too.

Use your brain for once!

If you do not have 3D its because your Video Card does not support - or you failed at copying the DLL files.

3) Wherever you extracted it to will have all of the files

4) If there is no Adobe folder in either of your program files, put the dll in the directory where you installed Photoshop. Those directories he talks about in the instructions are for if you downloaded PS to the default directory.

,MrTTAO,2012-06-19T06:09Z,"If you are unable to install in trial mode then disconnect from the internet before running the installer. It is not explicitly mentioned in the instructions but needs to be done. Blocking known adobe in hosts does not work, you gotta actually disconnect (or block whatever site they ping to check internet connectivity; probably google or something to avoid spending their own money)

easiest way to do it (without mechanical wear on your plug) is to type ""cmd"" in run box to get command prompt, then type in it ""ipconfig /release"". When you are done just type ""ipconfig /renew"" (or restart computer) to reconnect to the internet."

***CAUTION****CAUTION****CAUTION****
Most mistakes happen when patching, because the dll file was not copied to the correct directory!
The 32bit version is here:
C:  Program Files (x86)  Adobe  Adobe Photoshop CS6
The 64bit version is here:
C:  Program Files  Adobe  Adobe Photoshop CS6 (64 bit)
****LANGUAGES****LANGUAGES****
For all those who have a language problem!

,keithallen,2012-07-20T17:59Z,"You're the man, thethingy!

For those having some troubles with this package, I'll add the following hints. Follow
this order EXACTLY. (Please note and follow all previous instructions, ESPECIALLY disabling
the Internet. NOTE THAT SELECTIVE BLOCKING AT THIS POINT (e.g., Comodo or Zone Alarm or host file)
IS ***NOT*** ENOUGH!)

1. To ensure Camera RAW works in Bridge:

  After installing the package as a trial:
  (a) Allow PS to run in trial mode ONCE.(You should have PS Extended at this time.) Close PS.
  (b) Open Bridge and allow it to display some images. ABSOLUTELY do NOT attempt to run Camera RAW.
      Close Bridge.
  (b) Replace amtlib.dll with the patched version in BOTH Bridge's and PS's program directory.
  (c) Run PS ONCE. Close PS.
  (d) Open Bridge and allow it to display some images. ABSOLUTELY do NOT attempt to run Camera RAW.
      Close Bridge.
  (e) Replace the patched amtlib.dll in Bridge's program directory with the original for Bridge.
      Do NOT disturb the patched amtlib.dll in PS's program directory.

  You should be OK at this point. Remember to turn your Internet back on, with a selective block for
  PS and Bridge (either with selective firewall or host file).

2. For those of you who ran out of ""trial"" days like I did as I pursued discovering the above:

  (a) Internet totally OFF!!
  (b) Uninstall PS.
  (c) Upon reinstallation, when you get the ""00 Days Left"" dialog box, click on ""Enter Serial Number.""
      Do NOT cancel out and substitute DLLs. If you do, you won't have the Extended version of PS.
  (d) Well, enter a serial number! (I know you can find a good one. Check earlier comments on
      this package.)
  (e) Click ""Activate"" or is it ""Connect Online"" (I don't remember). Point is, PS will now try to verify
      or activate over the Internet. But you turned that off, right? Give it a while to try.
  (f) PS should eventually time out on attempting an Internet connection. At this point there should be
      an option to ""Connect Later""; select it.
  (g) PS Extended should now open -- not exactly a trial mode, not a registered mode. Just close it,
      and start at 1(b) above to get Camera RAW up and finish installation."

,blacky08,2012-07-21T19:42Z,"Hahahaha ...and as they say, ""Self Help is the best Help"", I figured out my problems by myself ;)

Here below, I have tried to explain solutions to a lot many problems that I have faced and also that I had seen that remained unanswered!

1. Problem no. 1 : ""CRC failed ...CRC failed ... Some installation files are corrupt ...and other such errors""
Solution : CRC errors occur when there's files missing during download from the internet (maybe due to many interruptions or because of too much wastage!). So best is to download the whole package AGAIN !!


2. Problem/Question 2 : Will this torrent work if you download the CS6 from Adobe's website and then use 'thethingy's' trick of replacing the DLLs?
Solution : YES, it will.  That's what I did, and it's working fine until now (and hope it continues in the future too!). But just make sure you DISCONNECT the internet before the installation.


3. Problem/Question 3 : If you have two or more versions of Photoshop (or any other related software like Elements, Lightroom etc) and want to use the Plugins/filters in all of them, what will you do?
Solution : Simple! Go to the newest installed program (Photoshop CS6 in my case), then Edit >> Preferences >> Plugins. On that window, find the 'plugins' folder that you had installed for earlier versions of Photoshop and make sure to click on ""Additional Plugins Folder"" and hit OK. It will work perfectly!


4. Problem/Question 4 : Is this ""Photoshop CS6 Extended"" or plain ""Photoshop CS6"" ?
Solution : For the Final time, this is ""ADOBE PHOTOSHOP CS6 EXTENDED"". If you still think this is only ""Photoshop CS6"", you need to see a doctor (not so many folks who already said this to be EXTENDED are fools!)


5. Problem/Question 5 : Does the 3D / Video / Filters etc work?
Solution : Yeah, it works! In case it's not working for you, just replace 'thethingy' DLLs from the downloaded folder to the folder in your PC. It will work just fine!


6. Problem/Question 6 : Why is the download file "".exe"" and why doesn't it contain any keys/keygens?
Answer : This is a ""Zipped executable"". That means, once you try running the "".exe"" file, it will unzip and show you all the files and folders, and also the instructions on how you can install CS6.


I just hope this answers questions to most of the users. For others still complaining, don't be a lazy goose and try reading some comments before jumping to a conclusion.
As for ""TheThingy"", my deepest thanks to you! You're a Saviour !! :)"

I have Win 7 64-bit and a working PS5 with all the hosts properly done. 
I downloaded and installed the trial, by mistake I didn't open the program BEFORE replacing the .dll, so it wasn't extended, then I read what I should have done, replaced the original .dll, now the program had 3D etc... I played with it for 5 minutes in trial mode, then I closed it and replaced the .dll (in Photoshop and in Bridge) with the patched one again. Now when I want to open the program I get an error message by Microsoft Visual C++Runtime Library which says: 
""Runtime Error!
Program:C:Program Files [etc etc...]
R6034
An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly.

And this window cannot be closed with Ok, cannot be closed from the taskbar, it keeps popping up again and again, it cannot be closed with Task Manager's main window, you have to close it from ""Processes"", with right click and ""Kill process tree"".

It's an .exe, you have to click on it and it will unzip all the necessary files into a folder. Then go into the folder and read the instructions. You can also try reading the comments above your own. I know they are many, but just the few couple of pages would suffice. So you're not too old, you're just a bit lazy :)"

,axxess22,2012-09-21T12:10Z,"
 This intruction is for poeple who are complaining about NOT being ""extended version""

Here are the steps to solve it.

1) Navigate to the PS instalation for me it was C:Program FilesAdobeAdobe Photoshop CS6 (64 Bit)

2) Copy and paste the ORIGINAL amtlib.ddl(located in DDL FILE you extracted) to your path instalation. Again, for me it was C:Program FilesAdobeAdobe Photoshop CS6 (64 Bit)

3) Open the program! It should be asking wheather or not your going to activate trial(this should be the extended version now), simply click  ""yes"".  

4) !!! Open the program, then close after that!!! 

5) Now, go back to DDL FILE folder, find your version(32bit or 64 bit) of amtlib.ddl, then copy and paste to your instalation path. again, mine was C:Program FilesAdobeAdobe Photoshop CS6 (64 Bit) 

6) Open the PS again and watch the magic.


Tip in finding your PS instalation path easily.

1) click ""start"" - type in ""adobe""  it should pop-up, point your mouse to the program, and then right click-> Properties->""open file location"".


Note- This was done on Win7/vista system. Cheers!


To the uploader-

To verify the issue is with your video card, go to Edit > Preferences > Performance, and uncheck ""Use Graphics Processor"". When you open images after that (changing this setting will not effect any currently open images) and they display correctly, then your video card and/or it's driver is the issue."

,pirbay1958,2012-09-24T10:41Z,"Firstly all hail Sir thethingy !
For those still asking for step by step guides they are in the first four pages of comments.
My only ""issue"" was updates and as thethingy says you can dload direct from adobe product updates . The other method mentioned in included instructions using menu/help/update in CS6 (with internet first disconnected etc) didnt work for me as this is grayed out after amtlin.dll replaced.Workaround was to open a previously installed adobe product ( for me premiere 5.5) and (while connected to internet) use the update function.This automatically updated all adobe progs including CS6.Oddly if you locate and launch the Adobe Application Manager (the update program) outside of an opened app it prompts for an Adobe ID.

Only other comment is about a previous suggestion here to replace all previous versions (CS5 etc) of Bridge/PS with respective 32/64 patched amtlib.dll.Not sure why this is necessary but I did just in case.It does however gray out the update selection when you open that app.

PS CS6 has a few bugs (dont blame the uploader) eg you need to have the windows task bar at bottom of screen or the opened floating tab/photo snaps back to original location on attempting to drag/move it.

here's to thethingy and waiting adobe tool v 2.2 to get CS6 serials/cracks included"

@NoodlyPirate No, you dont need adobe ID (what for?) and why would you think you need a prior version of PS?...(i did post that using a prior version of an adobe product was ONE way of getting around updating CS6 but you dont need to have any other preinstalled product)

Once again,if new, take some time and read through first 4 pages of comments thoroughly,most questions have already been answered"
