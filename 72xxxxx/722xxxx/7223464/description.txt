Carl B Stokes/Oliver Nelson - The Mayor And The People [1970] [Album]

Original Release / Flying Dutchman / FDS-130 / Vinyl

An incredibly interesting record ΓÇô and more of a spoken album than a jazz one, but it shares some great jazz work by Oliver Nelson too! The album's a loving tribute to Carl B. Stokes, the first black mayor of a major American city (Cleveland) ΓÇô and it's one of the strongest in a series of African-American culture albums by the Flying Dutchman label at the time. Side one of the record features a press conference with Stokes, in which he outlines his ideas for revitalizing the Cleveland area. But even better is side two ΓÇô which features a beautiful original composition by Nelson, entitled "A Black Suite For String Quartet & Jazz Orchestra", and which features recitations by Stokes of material by Langston Hughes and Gil Scott-Heron. The whole thing's great ΓÇô extremely powerful and progressive, with tracks that include "Paint It Black", "I Too Sing America", "Mother To Son", "Sit Down", and "I Dream A World".
