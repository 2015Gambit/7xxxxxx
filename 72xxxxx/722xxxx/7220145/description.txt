In late 2010 reports began to circulate that the surviving members of the 
Beach Boys would reunite for a 50th Anniversary tour and album. Despite 
some uncertainty and initial denials, on December 16, 2011 it was announced 
that Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston and David Marks 
would reunite for a new album and 50th anniversary tour in 2012 that would 
include a performance at the New Orleans Jazz Festival in April.

The first single from the album, "That's Why God Made the Radio" made its 
national radio debut April 25, 2012 on ESPN's Mike and Mike in the Morning. It 
was released to the bands YouTube channel later that same day, with 
accompanying lyrics. In addition the song has been released and is now 
available as a single in digital outlets such as iTunes and Amazon.
