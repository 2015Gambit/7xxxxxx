Documentary exploring a 2006 terror plot that aimed to detonate bombs simultaneously on several US airliners departing from Heathrow, which if successful could have killed more than 2,000 people. The programme reconstructs the MI5 investigation that prevented the attack, and reveals how American intervention forced British security services to make premature arrests that might have jeopardised the operation. Featuring interviews with the then home secretary John Reid, former US Homeland Security secretary Michael Chertoff and Michael Hayden, former head of the CIA.
