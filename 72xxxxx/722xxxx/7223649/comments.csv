,wildman1974,2012-07-23T05:13Z,"Excellent Video and Sound quality!!
The Aspect Ratio however keeps switching from Letterbox to Full Screen. After doing some research, I found out that this was the case in the IMAX theater versions also.
It's very distracting to watch, but that's just me. Does anyone know if the same thing happens on a DVD Rip??"
,Mikiah,2012-08-04T23:11Z,"This was possibly the shittiest copy I came across. The video is glitched here and there. The sound is alright don't get me wrong Zen Bud. The video at the start is full screen, then later goes to widescreen. LOL Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan GEY YO SHIT TOGETHER ZEN BUD AND UPLOAD REAL QUALITY."

,Bulbouswhore,2012-08-08T17:20Z,"@wildman1974 and @Mikiah, regarding the switching between the fullscreen (IMAX) shots and the widescreen/letterbox shots:

(from The Dark Knight Wikipedia)

""For its release in IMAX theaters, Nolan shot four major sequences in that format, including the Joker's opening bank robbery and the car chase midway through the film, which marked the first time that a feature film had been even partially shot in the format.

For fifteen years Nolan had wanted to shoot in the IMAX format, and he also used it for ""quiet scenes which pictorially we thought would be interesting."" The use of IMAX cameras provided many new challenges for the filmmakers: the cameras were much larger and heavier than standard cameras, and produced noise which made recording dialogue difficult. In addition, the cameras had short film loads ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes and the cost of the film stock was much greater than standard 35mm film. Nevertheless, Nolan said that he wished that it were possible to shoot the entire film in IMAX: ""if you could take an IMAX camera to Mount Everest or outer space, you could use it in a feature movie."" In addition, Nolan chose to edit some of the IMAX sequences using the original camera negative, which by eliminating generation loss, raised the film resolution of those sequences up to 18 thousand lines.

The BD/iTunes version presents the film in a variable aspect ratio, with the IMAX sequences framed in 1.78:1, while scenes filmed in 35 mm are framed in 2.40:1. The DVD versions feature the entire film framed in a uniform 2.40:1 aspect ratio. Disc 2 of the two-disc Special Edition DVD features the six main IMAX sequences in the original 1.44:1 aspect ratio."""
,Bulbouswhore,2012-08-09T13:19Z,"Dear Zen_Bud, can you please let me know how you ripped this while still keeping the IMAX scenes. I tried making a 1.4whatever gig rip of the 1080p bluray using Handbrake, but it would crop the IMAX shots, which I would not stand for.

Please let me know how you ripped this like this so that I can try with my copy I already downloaded. If it's a trade secret, than email me it please, and thank you.

I found out how to re-encode it and keep both aspect ratios, thanks to a bit of Googling.

Thank you once again for the upload!"
,gagvirus,2012-08-26T00:53Z,"Zen_Bud !!! Thank you for your quality torrents, but i have a question, so could you Please help me.?.?.?.?.... i want to convert a film into a codec that is similar to you... can you please tell me with which codec and which program you have converted... 140 minutes and only 1.3gb is fantastic... i have movies that are bigger than 9gb and so what whom the hell its needed......thanks in advance"
,red2silver,2012-09-02T23:38Z,"Audio is gr8 & earns an 9/10 though the bitrate suggests otherwise.

However video earns only a 7/10. In the bright scenes quality is good @ 9/10, but the dark scenes are only gud enough for 5/10 with large blocky rectangles visible. Mind you this is no fault of the ripping. I think its just a case of the movie being a wrong fit for such compressed rip as the dark scenes lead to huge loss of detail, sharpness etc - no longer feels HD in those scenes, including the IMAX camera footage"
