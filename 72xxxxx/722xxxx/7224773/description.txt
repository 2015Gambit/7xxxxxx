This is an [MAC] emulator pack I threw together.

I had a lot of friends asking where, when, how, why, WHERE?! I got my emulators etc. So I compiled a folder with already extracted, well working copies of a few emulators. I understand there is probably a wealth of emulators out there that aren't included in this pack, this is just a simple thrown together pack of the generic most used ones. 

1) MAME ARCADE
2) VISUAL BOY ADV
3) SIXTY FORCE
4) ROCK NES
5) GENESIS PLUS
6) SNES9X


The file is compressed into a .zip to further speed up your download, if people complain about that being a virus then I'll scrap it and upload the entire folder.


DOES NOT INCLUDE ROMS! links to ROMS included in read me.


As always, please seed.
