Hope lies within is a collaboration of 5 close friends doing what they love most. Each with very similar outlooks, goals, and ideas of what really defines music. They hope to bring joy to the listeners ears by simply making music that wanders from the norm and catches your attention by demonstrating raw emotion and a strong core musicianship all at once. In a nut shell, hope lies within is a melodic Rock/ Hard Rock band that blends elements of progressive rock and classical voice to keep the sound original but also sound very natural. The number one goal for hope lies within is to do what they love and have fun while doing it.
