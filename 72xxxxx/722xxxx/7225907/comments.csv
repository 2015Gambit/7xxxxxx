sorry, I'm not a tutor but obviously needed rhythm skills depend on music genre you play.
there's for instance metal rhythm in 6 weeks etc etc."
,balaguitar,2012-04-29T13:36Z,Sure. will dig that.. Thanks!

but almost any video lesson has to do with rhythm practice.
btw what country are you from? point is I speak French better than English."
,balaguitar,2012-04-29T14:40Z,Yup. Already in my torrent list :) Well I am from the US. Sorry I don't know French. But your English is really good :)

a little ad:
there's a hugely helpful dvd from John McLaughlin and Selva Vinayakram called 'Konokol - The Gateway to Rhythm' with traditional Indian approach to learning rhythm patterns, especially the odd ones. An absolute musthave!
I'll try to upload it tomorrow. So - coming soon."
