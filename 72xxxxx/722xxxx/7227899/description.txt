MoonCalc provides information relating to the position, age, phase,orientation, appearance and visibility of the moon for any given date, time and location on earth. It also provides the Julian Day Number, Magnetic Declination, time and direction of moonrise and moonset, interval between sunset and moonset, interval between sunrise and moonrise, date/time of astronomical new moon (conjunction), full moon, apogee and perigee and predicts the likelihood of visualising the young moon from a particular location. Data pertaining to solar and lunar eclipses in any year are also shown. MoonCalc provides Hijri calendar data including location dependent Hijri date conversion using predicted crescent visibility. Automatic local and regional (tri-zonal) Hijri calendar tabulation is possible.
