,jeffro890,2012-05-01T19:10Z,"Hey mxfanboy, thank you a lot for this... I just have a suggestion... this is taking forever to be ready... nobody is seeding.. and for example IÂ´m just following the 450(MX1) class, so why donÂ´t you upload these on separates files... so this can be faster... thank you again:)"
,Dirtfrog399,2012-05-03T22:01Z,Thanks a lot mxfanboy!!  Great quality and quick download.  @jeffro890 - you need to check your settings - your UPLOAD SPEED - or your internet operator.  This download took just a few hours and already sharing 5:1...
