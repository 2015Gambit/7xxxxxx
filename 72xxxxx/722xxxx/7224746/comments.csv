C_P Vids are not worth your bandwidth!  Vids are zoomed & cropped.  I've seen better video quality on a video tape from the 1960's!  

V= -5/10  {yes that is a Negative 5}

Let's petition to have the skull removed because his quality is not worth VIP status"

There is part of it missing, the bottom you can see the ""CN"" logo is missing half of it and on the top part too.
The quality isn't good either."
