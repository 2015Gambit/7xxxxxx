DESCRIPTION:

Mathematics of Fuzziness ΓÇô Basic Issues introduces a basic notion of ΓÇÿfuzzinessΓÇÖ and provides a conceptual mathematical framework to characterize 
such fuzzy phenomena in Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing. The book systematically presents a self-contained introduction to the essentials of 
mathematics of fuzziness ranging from fuzzy sets, fuzzy relations, fuzzy numbers, fuzzy algebra, fuzzy measures, fuzzy integrals, and fuzzy topology to 
fuzzy control in a strictly mathematical manner. It contains most of the authorsΓÇÖ research results in the field of fuzzy set theory and has evolved from the 
authorsΓÇÖ lecture notes to both undergraduate and graduate students over the last three decades. A lot of exercises in each chapter of the book are 
particularly suitable as a textbook for any undergraduate and graduate student in mathematics, computer science and engineering. 
The reading of the book will surely lay a solid foundation for further research on fuzzy set theory and its applications.
