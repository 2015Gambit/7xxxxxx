,CrackedBlamerFTW,2012-05-01T04:05Z,Nice!! Thanks!
,xDV8x,2012-05-02T04:17Z,"thank you for the attemp to add the DDDK, I too am getting ""Fatal Error's"" directing towards the DefDevelopment.exe itself. My errors do point to the folder that my game is located so its not misspathed. I get 8 Address errors, so not sure if a fresh copy of the DefDevelopment.exe would work or not.

,kompas909,2012-05-02T07:35Z,"ok couple solutions that I think might work:

1st. Try using simpler direction, remowe all those 7.28c and other, try put game like C(D): Dungeon Defenders.

2nd. Check If DDDK not asking about outated scripts (Same happened to me).

3rd. Try do Clean game instalation, and don't updated over 7.30d ver.

If same problem still occurs, I'll upload NewestClean full DDDK. "
