Dungeon Defenders is a hybrid game combining aspects from both Action Role Playing and Tower Defense genres. Players can choose from many hero classes, each with their own defenses, as they defend Eternia Crystals from hordes of creatures. Besides building static defenses, players can fight with a massive arsenal of weapons and familiars.

*For DDDK*
To launch DDDK go to BinariesWin32 and launch "Dungeon Defenders UDK.bat" then, recompile scripts (program wil lask you if you want o that, press yes). Wait until it finish (close it when it show, all done, ignor errors), then launch it "Dungeon Defenders UDK.bat" agen, it will ask for same procure agen, press yes, when it finish, don't close it. Third time launch "Dungeon Defenders UDK.bat" and now, it DDDK should start. (It have some missing files, but it works). Good luck with mapping.
