,Openna,2012-04-29T13:22Z,"@gansuk please Upload RAGE and L.A Noire. I am not the only one thinking downloading 20 gb takes too long. Sure, you may just don't care 'bout this, but a real Compression of L.A Noire or RAGE could really show KaOs's abilities. Anyone thinking the same as i do?
BTW...my screen goes black while starting. How to fix it?"

,Mad4dub,2012-05-06T05:44Z,"Hey Gansuk, I'm decent at downloading/getting most torrents to work but I'm a bit confused as to what to do with this addon pack.  What exactly do I unrar every zipped file and where do I put them just in the Shogun 2 main folder?  Sorry I don't quite understand what the root folder means."
,Mad4dub,2012-05-06T05:53Z,Hey Gansuk I posted a comment but I don't think it's showing up.  I'm a bit confused as to what to do with this addon pack.  Do I unrar all zipped files and where do I unrar to?  That's what's confusing me I don't quite know what the root folder is.  Thnx tons nice upload of the game btw I've gone well past 200 turns with a few ctds here and there.
