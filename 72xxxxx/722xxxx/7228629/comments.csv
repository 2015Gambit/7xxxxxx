,darkizzle,2012-04-30T04:15Z,"Holy crap, did anyone else expect Joffrey marching his entire garrison to meet Robb's host? Probably the dumbest move ever and now he's captured and sharing a cage with Jaime. You'd think the Lannisters are done but they still have some surprises, like when they capture Stannis' ships and almost obliterate Robb's army. Poor Sansa though. The way Cersei killed her because they wouldnt give back Joffrey. I've read all the books so I know exactly whats going to happen but its still so exciting spollers!"

,proffejor,2012-04-30T04:27Z,"Well said, Darkizzle, But you left out the part where Voldemort appeared riding Shadowfax and struck Katniss down with excalibur, while Edward Cullen tounged the Hamburglar's bung while he screamed ""DON'T POST SPOILERS, EVEN FAKE ONES."""
,darkmoves,2012-04-30T04:29Z,"lol, darkizzle, none of that happened in the books nor will it happen in the tv show. . . (Btw, what actually happens is much more interesting :) )"
,Bambikilr,2012-04-30T04:29Z,"Thanx! Always dependable, always great!

@darkizzle : Very funny... Your so called ""spoilers"" aren't even correct... I'm amazed that some people haven't got anything else to do. "
,Hunun,2012-04-30T04:30Z,Please keep a 1:1 ratio guys. If everybody limits upload we get nowhere.
,HardcoreWrapper,2012-04-30T04:32Z,"@darkizzle.

This is how much of an asshole you are.
I stopped what I was doing.
left my snack in the microwave 
made a pirate bay account 
logged into my pirate bay account
found this torrent without fully reading your comment again and went out of my way to call you an asshole.
nobody cares if you've read all the books most 7th graders could accomplish that fact.
everyone else just became a little more awesome in comparison to your spoiler spreading, likely HBO-funded ass."
,KOBKED-X,2012-04-30T04:32Z,Thanks. .Can't Wait t o see it!!!! and..I will Seed!! really!!
,Ch4kito,2012-04-30T04:34Z,Thank You!!
,mysticdragonwolf90,2012-04-30T04:34Z,"@darkizzle,
Did anyone come here to download the episode only to see someone decided to spoil the episode?  At least wait till the episode has been out a few days or weeks before asking spoiler questions or even alert people ""SPOILER ALERT""."
,AlphaPrime01,2012-04-30T04:35Z,"ettv, i wait to get this from you or eztv every week! you guys are awesome! will seed for next 2 weeks "

,HardcoreWrapper,2012-04-30T04:35Z,"@ darkizzle.

,Hardwir3d,2012-04-30T04:36Z,On top as always. Excellent job ettv.
,whakx,2012-04-30T04:47Z,If you read @darkizzles comments dont have fear because GRR Martin never wrote anything so stupid. Sounds like the ravings of a teenager who fancies himself a novelist.
,mikebogina,2012-04-30T04:50Z,ettv =/= eztv?  O.o

,sandiplace2,2012-04-30T04:57Z,"Personally, I'd like to know what comic book the idiot is reading !!!  I've read the series twice and it's actually kind of depressing in how they tore apart Martin's excellence !!  

ETTV : thank you for the awesome uploads each and every week !!!"

,Panda47,2012-04-30T05:30Z,"LOL @ darkizzle and the guy who dropped everything to get an account and make a post.  Thar you are!

I love fake spoilers. I call them anti-spoilers.  It's where you think you're spoiled, but then suddenly it's not like what you thought, like a double surprise!"
,RaffysRevenge,2012-04-30T05:32Z,Oi ASSHOLES FUCKING SEED YOU COCKSUCKING CUNTS

,mrvon42,2012-04-30T05:50Z,"This is fake, right? It looks fake. There was no video or audio metadata, even after downloading 16% of it."

,GracefulEase,2012-04-30T06:01Z,"1. It's an mp4, check the files list in future.
2. It's ettv, and he even has a helper symbol by his name.

No it's not password protected, and no, it's not a fake.  Wise up."
,The_dude9,2012-04-30T06:03Z,The password is gameofthrones_s02e05_3545351344t53. What a cunt that uploaded this.
,Couter,2012-04-30T06:10Z,IT'S A TRAP!

,Whyttedragun,2012-04-30T06:26Z,"Okay, just to clear this one up, you DO NOT need a password.
@Those that said you needed to go to a survey site, I'd suggest scanning your machine for malware.  Sounds like something is redirecting your torrent D/Ls."
,Xeiros,2012-04-30T06:31Z,They manged to go an entire episode without adding any unnecessary nudity. Truly a feat worth sings tales of for generations to come.  
,Scilli,2012-04-30T06:37Z,"Perfect quality, no shitty surveys, thanks!"
,mendota,2012-04-30T06:37Z,eztv has posted their episode 5 rip. i suggest you all go there instead of risking yourself here.
,pirategus,2012-04-30T06:52Z,Seed people. I'm gonna enjoy the comments every week. I love you all.
,roadside1,2012-04-30T06:56Z,"Looks and sounds gre. Fast DL too.
If you think this is a  fake, step away from the pipe and get yer mind right.
If yer a spammin' liar, step up to the pipe and hit it 'til yer heart grenades. Don't forget to have a remote to post pics of yer death girly men."
,nVidiosos,2012-04-30T07:32Z,Anyone knows where to download english or spanish subtitle for this? Thanks in advance
,SystemFolder,2012-04-30T08:23Z,I'm on a Mac and the mp4 in this torrent works perfectly fine for me without any sort of password. Thanks again ettv.
