Unlike all of Spencer Davis albums before and since, this one took a more hard-rock approach. It reunited the previous line-up including Eddie Hardin and Pete York, after they released 3 albums as "Hardin & York". Unfortunately all I could find was a now-dead torrent of this single-file version, and I wasn't able to split it into individual tracks.  It isn't as good as their 1960s albums, but definitely worth saving :
