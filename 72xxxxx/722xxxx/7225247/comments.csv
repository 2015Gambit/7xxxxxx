,dcsscd,2012-04-29T20:54Z,"Thanks for all you work/upload thethingy, i just wanted to ask if these cs6 releases are the same that has been around for a couple of days in some websites taken from the adobe servers, or if this are your ""rips"" (for calling them some way) ?

Thanks again."
,BlkAsian,2012-05-01T03:12Z,hey thethingy i get tryout in illuscs6 when i open i tried put back the original dll open hit the 30day close then put back the other dll from the 32 and 64 folders but i still get try out any ideas thanks in advance.
,WarRobe,2012-05-01T04:05Z,"@BlkAsian, for illustrator you only have to put the .dll for version you installed (32 or 64 or both) in the folder especified in .txt, if you have a 64 machine I recomend you install only the 64 version."
,BlkAsian,2012-05-01T05:49Z,ok will do thanks ill have to uninstall and reinstall then.
,BlkAsian,2012-05-01T06:00Z,is it ok for it when loading to say tryout?
,miksteppenwolf,2012-05-01T06:58Z,"Great tks, works fine. For those who are seeking for ME version i.e. localized :ger. span. port. usV) and ME lang. support, just logoff from any google service, and then search...youll find it. The problem is that only two of the download links are reliable (in term of speed and/or download broken).Patience and a little work and you'll succeed. 
Use T.Th. tools and methods instead of those offered in these releases.  "
,WarRobe,2012-05-01T15:05Z,@BlkAsian Mine does not show nothing here. Maybe if you try to put the original dll file provided in download and then put the cracked one. I did this for photoshop and worked. theres no need for reinstallation. Hope it helps
,anshluz,2012-05-01T21:27Z,"-firstly - thanks a ton.
-questin is - Bridge (64) is installed as well and there is a amtlib.dll too. should it be replaced by illustrator's dll?
-update is desabled in illustrator after dll replacing. pity."
,BlkAsian,2012-05-02T04:49Z,"i did that one but still loads with tryout. but if i copy the original dll i get the 30day, i dont get it with the other dll no errors or anything i just see tryout in the loader box."
,anshluz,2012-05-02T07:24Z,i have =tryout= on the wellcome screen too. so what ppl ? just do not pay attention ?

,DaDangle,2012-05-06T21:49Z,"hello sir thingy. first, thank you for all the hard work you go through for us. youre the black beard of the piratebay. but, i dont really know what im doin wrong here. after the install i get this error oxcooooo7b and the app wont start. im on windows 7 64bit, patched the hosts, replaced dll's, wanked for good luck, and still i get this. and to be honest this happens every time i attempt an adobe cs? install. any help would be appricated. 

dadangle"
,flopeye,2012-05-07T02:43Z,"Da Dangle,

Not being a wiseguy here, but google adobe install error oxcooooo7b and you will find the problem is probably a registry issue. Try Thingy's install cleaner upper and reinstall. 

As a final note... all hail TheThingy. You rock!"
,DaDangle,2012-05-07T10:20Z,"hey mr wise guy. thanks for the half asses response. not every problem is googlable. yes, other people have gotten the same error, but none of their fixes have worked for me. ive used the tool and re installed multiple times. narinada. "
,flopeye,2012-05-07T14:39Z,"DaDangle,

haha. I seriously wasn't being a wiseguy. I googled that exact phrase and thought you might find it helpful. I know, though, too many other people like the ""Try google dumbass"" response. I actually tried finding the answer for ya. :)

I think you have to make sure you use the 32 and 64 bit dll's in the right files. Other than that, don't know what to say. I haven't installed these or had that problem. I just like to follow thethingy. He/she/it/they are my hero."

,NiTrOcALyPsE,2012-06-08T23:53Z,"HEADS-UP to others! If you've already installed and patched another Adobe application (such as Photoshop), installing Illustrator seems to revert the amtlib.DLL file found in Adobe Bridge to the original. I noticed and corrected it before I actually ran any Adobe applications so I don't know what the result would be if you ran Illustrator or something else without re-patching the DLL in Adobe Bridge.

That aside, I followed the instructions for the DLL files and swapped the PNG graphics, double checked with Adobe Tool 2.1 to make sure my hosts file was patched, and everything went just fine. Rebooted, and everything is still working perfectly."
,dookiebd,2012-06-09T08:33Z,"@mtrz i was having the same problem.. before installing, go into your device manager, then network adapters, and right click/disable it so that when you start the installation, adobe thinks you don't have a way to validate your adobe ID so it doesn't even ask during setup."

,trntz_j,2012-09-02T00:16Z,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For those who can not figure out how to install file
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am surprised so many people haven't responded to this yet.

If you go to the top of this PirateBay site and go to the ""Files:"" in the Torrent Description (next to the flag image on top, below ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 [thethingy]), if you click the ""1"" it will say that the file you are downloading is an .exe (ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6  [thethingy].exe).

When I finished downloading the file was labeled as a ""file"" and when I clicked it it asked which program to use to install. The problem when you downloaded it, you probably lost the .exe extension. 

In order to turn it into a valuable file you will need to go to the downloaded file and add .exe to it (change to ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6  [thethingy].exe). This will make the file usable.

This may happen sometimes when downloading torrents. So if this happens again just go to the files list and fine out what file extension it is (.avi, exe, etc.) and correct it."
,Klaklastrophe,2012-09-02T02:26Z,"Hello,

I'm sorry but I don't know how the files work... I start in this!
