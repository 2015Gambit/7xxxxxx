"Shadow Walker"

Nikita (Maggie Q) convinces a 
reluctant Birkhoff (Aaron Stanford) to 
use 20 million dollars of his own 
money in a plan to bankrupt Percy 
(Xander Berkeley) and Division, but 
when Percy ends up stealing Birkhoff's 
entire life savings, Birkhoff and 
Nikita clash. Team Nikita has one last 
chance to hit Percy again, but 
Birkhoff is arrested trying to regain 
his millions and Nikita realizes she 
must break him out of jail before 
Division gets to him. Michael (Shane 
West) and Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca) go 
after Birkhoff's stolen money while 
Nikita goes to save Birkhoff.
