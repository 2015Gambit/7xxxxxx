,compccs,2012-04-28T21:04Z,any plans for a 720
,assfacefromhell,2012-04-29T00:28Z,This was easily one of the worst episodes I've ever seen. They need to get back to the creepy abandoned places and drop all the stupid celebrity bullshit.
,timewarped,2012-04-29T00:38Z,"Luv, luv, luv your stuff :) Thanks heaps!"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-29T00:58Z,720p will come out tuesday as i have exceeded my monthly limit
,pins,2012-04-29T00:58Z,"I agree with assface. I am so sick of their guest stars. I get that they're 'famous' now and it's got to be incredibly exciting to make friends with your idols, but jeezus, Zak, I really don't want to watch this."
,pins,2012-04-29T00:59Z,"Oh, and thanks for the upload! How rude of me D:"
,mularkey,2012-04-30T15:53Z,Great quality!  Thanks.  I hope they at least got their cover waved at his new strip club in Las Vegas.

I've experienced it myself and they are everywhere trying to bring us to sin and away from God. This is just ONE of the reasons why we should turn to Jesus Christ, as he is the only way to reach GOD and our spirit salvation. Death is not the end, we are here for a reason. Faith is not against intelligence. READ THE BIBLE."
,dragontwist1080,2012-05-01T10:02Z,"I agree with DriftBR!! Don't get me wrong I love this show and it's awesome the stuff they usually catch on camea, but I pretty much think almost all of these spirits or manifestations are pretty much demons. Weather they are kid spirits to some spirit they catch on EVP saying they are this person who was murdered in that location. I believe these spirits are not the actual spirits of these ppl who died there, b.c. if you think about it these demons could easily pose as a kid,man,or woman to throw you off and make you think that after death you just float around on earth. Of course demons want you to think that so that it might contradict what The Bible says. That way people will question their Faith in the Bible and their faith in their religion. People always say the Devils biggest ploy was fooling the world that he didn't exist. That way people will go to Hell! And Zak and another guest on a previous episode even talked about wondering if these spirits were real or just all demons posing as these people! God Bless Everyone!"
