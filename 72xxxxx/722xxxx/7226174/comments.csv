I'm thinking you must not be downloading the torrent file from the page after you upload.

That's a very important step and you can't simply choose ""add the trackers to the torrent"" that you already have.... you musyt delete the one you uploaded (not the daa, just the .torrent file) and load the one from the page after you upload."
