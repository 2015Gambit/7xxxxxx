*** 
I use a Transfer Cap and upload 7 gigs a day. 
This is why I upload a new torrent every other day or so. 
I do this to keep my IP off my back as they have initiated a monthly limit.
It usually takes me two days to fully seed a torrent so please be patient.

SYNOPSIS:  
Director D.W. Griffith's historical saga recounts the genesis of the U.S. Civil War, the destruction it wrought upon the populace, and the social ills spawned by Reconstruction, including the ascent of the Ku Klux Klan. The story plays out in the intertwining fates of two fictional families -- the Northern Stonemans and the Southern Camerons. Though the film's legacy is stained by its racist content, it remains a landmark in filmmaking technique.

I upload my torrents to The Pirate Bay and Demonoid, if you would like to upload one of my torrent files to another tracker feel free. 
All I ask is that you upload the same torrent file you downloaded by clicking on one of my links so that more seeders/peers are in the swarm.
