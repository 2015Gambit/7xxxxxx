Storyline

Brilliant LAPD detective Charlie Crews has survived the extreme abuse befalling an innocent cop in prison, and was exonerated for the murders and released after 12 years of hell in jail. He could retire on his settlement, but chooses to resume police work. Nevertheless, the grim experience has made him more philosophical and tempted to put justice - especially for the innocent - above chasing the presumably guilty and legally by-the-book, as his new partner Dani Reese must experience and learn to cope with.
