,oblachubs2,2012-04-30T17:51Z,"I put this on an original XBOX 360 with JTAG.  all other XBLA games work except this one.  It tells me to try downloading it again.  What's the difference between my JTAG and a RGH console.  Not sure what a XBLAPlus is either.  Thanks for the help in advance.
OB"
,HawkguyTK,2012-05-04T01:28Z,Game doesn't work. I have a JTAG and all other games work and I think this is the first game that hasn't worked which you have made boobsman
,HawkguyTK,2012-05-04T01:30Z,@Oblachubs. RGH stands for Reset Glitch Hack and it's basically the same as JTAG except for the way you exploit the console to run unsigned code. 
,HawkguyTK,2012-05-04T23:25Z,Updated dash to 14699 and it works now. Sorry for doubting you boobsman. Keep up the good work!
,azuziel,2012-05-05T19:31Z,"RGH is like JTAG yes, however newer mobo's aren't freeBOOT compatible, XELL only with RGH. So it does make a big difference. Choose wisely. "

,charincol,2012-05-27T02:22Z,"Really Azuziel? That must be the reason why the latest version of Xell, also known as Xell-Reloaded, and the latest FreeBOOT, run perfectly fine on my Jtags. You're a dumbass and don't know what the fuck you're talking about."
