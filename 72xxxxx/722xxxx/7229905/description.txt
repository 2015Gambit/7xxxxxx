With their infectious alt-pop sound, uplifting yet clever lyrical sensibilities, and huge hearts for youth, Attaboy has emerged from the Midwestern music scene as a band with a distinctive and personable presence.

Vocalist/pianist Amos Caley, guitarist Jeff Edgel, and drummer Micah Beckwith began their musical journey while studying at Huntington University in Indiana, and were joined shortly thereafter by Huntington native Chris Brumbaugh on bass. Now, four years later, they've honed their songwriting and on-stage magic, but they've also evolved into a band with a very clear purpose: "If we could sum up our mission as a band, it would be to address the deeper questions regarding life and spirituality, while offering very real hope," says Caley. "While recording new, thoughtful music is part of that, our favorite part is to pack it all in a van and hit the road in an effort to meet and interact with as many people as possible."

And that's exactly what they've done for the last few years. While touring the country from New Hampshire to Nebraska, Ohio to Oklahoma, playing high-energy shows and spreading their message of acceptance and hope, Attaboy recorded and self-released a full-length album, So Much for Today, in July 2007, and worked with Ian Eskelin (Stellar Kart, Everyday Sunday, Eleventyseven) to produce a four-song EP, California, in April 2008.

The band's progressive guitar and piano-driven sound won't merely get stuck in the listener's head; with the tenacity of a still, small voice, it will edge its way into the heart.
