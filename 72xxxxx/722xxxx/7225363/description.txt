Disclaimer: 
I did not make this Patcher. I cannot offer any support on it. It worked for me, and that was all the proof I needed.

Note: 
This patch ONLY works for version 1.0.1204.1301!

Installation:

1. If Xsplit is not installed already, install it using "xsplit_installer_v1.0.1204.1301.exe".
2. Run Xsplit Patcher.exe
3. Click "Patch"
4. Select "XSplit.Core.exe", which is located in the Xsplit install path. ( "C:Program Files (x86)SplitMediaLabsXSplit" or  "C:Program FilesSplitMediaLabsXSplit" )
5. You're done. That was easy, wasn't it? :)

Do NOT update Xsplit, it will undo the patch.
