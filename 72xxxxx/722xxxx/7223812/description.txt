Viz Magazine UK May 2012

Viz has been gracing British newsagentsΓÇÖ shelves since 1979. Its irreverent mix 
of bad language, childish cartoons and sharp satire has seen its creators hauled 
over the coals by the United Nations, questioned by Scotland YardΓÇÖs anti-terrorist 
branch and exhibited in the Tate Gallery. VizΓÇÖs comic characters, such as the Fat 
Slags, Sid the Sexist, and Roger Mellie the foul-mouthed Man on the Telly, as well 
as its hugely popular Top Tips and Profanisaurus sections, are firmly established 
as national institutions, just like Broadmoor Hospital for the Criminally Insane.
