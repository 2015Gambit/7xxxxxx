Complete walktrough from download to playing Dead Island coop.

Have Steam & Tunngle installed on your computer, if any of these two are missing i left the installers in the folder.

1. Copy 'Dead Island' to your 'Program Files' folder.
2. Launch steam and login with a fake account, create one if you don't already have one.
3. Copy the contents from the 'SmartSteam' folder to your steam folder, shutdown steam and launch "SmartSteam.exe".
4. Run Tunngle, enter the Dead Island room, launch the game 'deadislandgame.exe'.
5. Play the game singleplayer untill you see a text saying that you have entered 'ACT 1'
6. From there on you can press escape and select gamelobby, make sure that the game is set to LAN via the options menu.
