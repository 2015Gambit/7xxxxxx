[V],thetorrentlord,2012-04-28T16:53Z,Hang in there. I get the same results and it's probably because there are not huge numbers leeching or seeding.  I also believe that the torrent clients do not reflect a true representation of the actual people sharing the files. I watch my uploads and on some only one leecher gets the whole upload bandwidth for that file and they will complete way before anyone else and then it will still show only myself seeding. It is what we have to live with if using a public site. I get more hits at my private site. As Nike says: JUST DO IT!!!!

[T],alien99,2012-04-29T22:23Z,"Torrent has a flaw will only upload to 99% complete
shows episode 03 and 09 not complete, i have 
played both these files in numerous different players and has worked in them all for me.  if any
one has a problem let me know can upload them
by there self."
