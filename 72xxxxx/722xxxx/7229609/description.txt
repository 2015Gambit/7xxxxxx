STORY

Shortly after taking a job processing obituaries, a young man becomes
inadvertently involved in the death of an old woman. Only when he
reads about the accident in his own newspaper, days later, does he
come to realize that he was a critical detail in the turn of events
that led to her demise. After encountering another person who
presumably goes missing, he is convinced that he has been wound into a
plot for which he has been cast as an agent of Fate. ( Written by Otto
Buj)
