,NateAH,2012-05-11T22:26Z,"You do realize that there is no season 7, yet, right? According to IMDB:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1051155/episodes?season=6

This is season 6, episode 8."
,Speechless1998,2012-05-22T15:39Z,"S06E08 - How Big, How Far, How Fast (April 2012)
S06E09 - Alien Sounds (May 2012) - end of season

According to Wikipedia ""The Universe"" will be returning but it's the only show without a link on their ""Current & Returning Series"" column so they may be referring to the tail end of season 6."
