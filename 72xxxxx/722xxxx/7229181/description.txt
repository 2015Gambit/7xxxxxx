Travel Channel brings explosions to the world of sand in ΓÇ£Sand Wars,ΓÇ¥ a competition special where the losing sand sculptures are blown sky high!  Each one-hour special, premiering on Thursday, March 29 at 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., ET/PT, pits four two-person teams against each other in a three-round sand sculpting competition.  In each round, not only do the teams face the chance of being voted off, but they may have to watch their work-in-progress be demolished with a powerful blast!  The teams eliminated in the first and second rounds will combine into a four-person comeback team to compete in the third and final round.  The winner of that round will be crowned champion and awarded a $10,000 grand prize!
