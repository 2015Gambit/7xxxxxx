been playing online (multiplayer) with a friend 2 days ago on the 1.08...

did they patch the multiplayer for pirates or maybe their multiplayer is just fucked up? 

any information would be appreciated =]"
,Machine4578,2012-04-29T18:14Z,just tried playing and the game connected to the server.. guess the server was just down:)
,Yomiyo,2012-04-29T19:55Z,"@Machine4578 
Are you able to connect to other players?
the game connects to its server and I can see costume player maps, etc.. but when I try to start a multiplayer game it just keep searching for a game and nothing happens =[

anyone else has that problem?"
