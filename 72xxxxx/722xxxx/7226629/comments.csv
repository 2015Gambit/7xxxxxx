Thank you for uploading so many games Nepotu!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-04-29T17:09Z,"You're welcome! This happened because of magnet link. The TPB policy had change and from more than 10 S+L you can't download the torrent file directly, only a magnet link to this file. Since you don't have the torrent file you don't know that information."
,baffled77,2012-04-29T18:59Z,"I see the change to magnets, but I've been running the torrent for 2 hours and it still doesn't see anything. I am running with PeerBlock 1.1, do you think that would interfere? My torrents from other sites work fine, but I can't seem to get the magnets here to load. I'll go see if I can try a torrent off a site where most things work for me."
,baffled77,2012-04-29T19:05Z,"Tested another torrent off demonoid with magnet link and had it running in about 10 seconds. The format isn't hard for me, but magnet links off TPB don't seem to be working for me :(

Would it have anything to do with the tracker status being set to ""disabled""? Only thing I can think of is that the demonoid tracker is running."
,baffled77,2012-04-29T19:41Z,"Nevermind, it was my fail. I hadn't configured my clients properly to work with TPB. I'm now downloading the game. Thank you!!!

PS. An extra thank you for having a ****ing awesome layout. Saying names of teams, seed numbers, year, and the players and resolution without saying anything about the outcomes. Perfect."
[V],Nepotu,2012-04-29T19:51Z,"I don't know, but one of the trackers status must be active. If isn't, try to change some options or change port, or try to delete it and reload it, I don't know... I use utorrent and it works fine."

A 10/10
Once again spot on."
,baffled77,2012-04-30T06:56Z,"I finished downloading this file and watched the game. Video was perfect, audio was clear and synched.
