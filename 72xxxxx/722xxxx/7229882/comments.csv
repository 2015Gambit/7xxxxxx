,Swining,2012-04-30T18:23Z,I heard the audio is terrible and cuts often. It seems like good quality LiNE's are hard to come across now
,Swining,2012-04-30T18:24Z,"Video does look great though

,ziishady,2012-05-01T03:47Z,"pain in my ears ,, very bad Audio quality "
,spifkitten99,2012-05-01T13:56Z,"No, R5 does NOT usually mean bad audio.

R5 means dvd video and dvd audio.

What happens though, is that R5 is sometimes not in english, and then someone switched the audio with an english cam audio instead.

That shit SHOULD BE CLEARLY SPECIFIED in the title and description.

R5 with cam audio is unacceptable, unless it's clearly specified that it's with cam audio.

R5 does not by itself mean cam audio!"

,cyberria,2012-05-02T02:25Z,"  Don't even bother downloading this. I haven't seen sync issues this bad in about 10 years literally.  I'm only 15 minutes in and I've already had to readjust the audio about 8 times and it seems to be getting worse.

  You can also hear a lot of robotic squeeling from an overzealous attempt at cleaning the audio but you likely won't even notice it since all your concentration will be spent on trying to adjust the audio synchronization in real time."
[T],immagical,2012-05-02T23:45Z,"guys r5 is nothing to do with quality, it is ""region 5"" (russia)  normaly with a english audio mixed in and russian audio took out.   thats why some have great pictures but bad audio, because the uploader had to use english cam audio..."
,sun2244,2012-05-04T11:47Z,the uploader should have stated it is cam audio.
,teyorya,2012-05-11T07:54Z,"to the people complaining about the cam audio not being stated , there is a tag ""Line"" included already. read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R5_%28bootleg%29"

Thanks for the images. Never seen anyone do that but I'm also fairly new to the world of torrents."
