"The Inheritance"

Isabel's friend Joyce asks Walter to find 
the men who murdered her father, a 
racetrack aficionado. With the help of 
some horse-whispering, Walter discovers 
links to an inheritance Joyce was 
supposed to receive from her father, and 
to some mysterious men at the track whom 
Walter suspects are involved in her 
father's death. Meanwhile, Willa decides 
that she wants to apply for college.
