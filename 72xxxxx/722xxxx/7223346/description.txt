The title sums it up pretty well, but if you still need convincing: A 4-player co-op run-n-gun action shooter that throws you into a tidal wave of degenerate robots with an array of weaponry that would make any mama proud. A classic 2.5D side-scrolling shooter, revitalized with modern game design.

You take control of P. Walter Tugnut (The ΓÇ£PΓÇ¥ stands for ΓÇ£PicklesΓÇ¥), a regular guy who stockpiles guns, ammo, and beer in his dilapidated RV awaiting the inevitable robot apocalypse. When the abandoned factory in the distance begins producing robots on its own, Walter sets off in his RV on a robot-killing rampage, hoping to save humanity from an onslaught of robot hordes.

Developed by Demiurge Studios, collaborators on BorderlandsΓäó, Brothers in Arms┬«, and Mass EffectΓäó.
