Tarot Scholar Christine Payne-Towler's metaphysical readings combine an encyclopedic knowledge of tarot with an enlightened viewpoint. The software contains 16 essays, representing the latest in tarot research and the history of the cards. Authentic card shuffling captures the exact mathematics of shuffling and cutting, while providing animated feedback. It can fan the cards for you to pick from, or you can use a physical deck if you prefer manual shuffling. Either way, Tarot Magic helps you interpret the way the cars land. Whether you use it to receive helpful insights and relieve stress around decisions, problems, relationships, money, career, and health--or as an encyclopedia of esoteric tarot history and wisdom--Tarot Magic provides the resources.
