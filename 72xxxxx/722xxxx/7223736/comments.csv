,lattari,2012-07-25T18:51Z,"I want to take the time to really thank you.  First of all, I love the amount of subtitles and that my native language is among them.  I've always wondered why they are so rarely included. Since these rips originate from retail discs, you would think that basically all that is required is to not take them away? 

I also like the two different audio tracks. With the massive developments of recent years in the home a/v system techonoly, its nice that here are options in this rip. Often people rape the audio tracks in an effort to save space from the final file size. I can't say I appreciate that. 1,5 MB DTS audio is about 700 MB for hour. AC3 640 (Dolby Digital) is half of that. This is hardly at all significant in terms of dowload size or disc space. People who go for 1080p rips do not care about differences of one or two gigabytes. They care about video and audio quality. Therefore you can easily put both in for a copy this size. In fact, I would encourage to put even larger audio tracks.

Thank you once again for this fantastic copy.  "
