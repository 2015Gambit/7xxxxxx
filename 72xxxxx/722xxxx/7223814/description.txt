Soulstorm (CF 184) brings Levin together with tenorman Ivo Perelman and bassist
Torbjörn Zetterberg on a two-disc set of trio improvisations. While the presence
of heavy-hitting tenor might signal thoughts of a typical power trio, this
threesome is decidedly different. The presence of Levin also speaks to
Perelman’s history, for he’s also recorded doubling on cello. The set is divided
into a studio and a live disc, with all pieces collectively improvised. What’s
paramount in this set is the way in which Perelman and Levin work
together. Rather than crisp exercises in contrast, they draw from a similar
palette, long lines of burnished vocal tenor dovetailing with a fine, meaty
drone and liquid crags. Perelman plays the tenor soft and thick, spry and
swirling with material hue. Levin’s arms and bow match fingers and keys
complementarily, his jousts a hum of declamatory gestures. Though it’s clearly a
show for reed and cello, Zetterberg adds a constant foundational undercurrent;
rather than matching wits with Perelman and Levin’s fluttering buzzsaws, he’s a
quietly creative motor. With surges of raw emotion and humanist abstraction,
Soulstorm presents a heady brew even in the sparsest moments.
