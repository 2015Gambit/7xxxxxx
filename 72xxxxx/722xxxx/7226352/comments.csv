@sujaidr, its easy for me to take sample rather than taking screen shots. i thought sample will be  more helpful than screens....."
,nahtnas,2012-05-12T21:37Z,"This print needs some more brightness... :(

I Recommend VLC mplayer to play mkv files

To change the brightness of the Video.....

1. Click ""Effects and filters"" in tools menu
2. Click ""Video effects"" Tab
3. Check ""Image adjust"" Check box if it is unchecked.
4. Drag the Brightness Bar to the right until u find its perfect

Enjoy :) "
