Defcon: Everybody Dies

"DEFCON is a real-time strategy game created by independent British game developer Introversion Software, developers of Darwinia, Multiwinia, and Uplink. The gameplay is reminiscent of the "big boards" that visually represented thermonuclear war in films such as Dr. Strangelove, Fail-Safe, and WarGames.

The game has been available by download since September, 2006 through Introversion's webstore and Steam. In the UK it was released for the high street shops on June 15, 2007 and for a limited period included the developer's first game Uplink. On April 5, 2007, US publisher Encore announced they would be publishing the game in the United States, and had ordered an initial 50,000 copies of the game for retail."

Good game to play in Lan Parties or via Hamachi like systems, as this is a cracked version and you'd need an authentic game key to on the game's online.
