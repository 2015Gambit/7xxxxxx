If you want to play with your buddies who also downloaded this torrent, add them to your friends list on steam and invite them to join your game on the right hand side of the screen.

On a side note, I haven't been able to join any quick matches lately, and figure the game must have been updated. You should still be able to invite your friends and have them come play with you, just not everyone who has purchased the game on steam like you used to. If I can find the updated version and crack it I will post a link to it here."
