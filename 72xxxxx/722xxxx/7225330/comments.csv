,JD911,2012-04-29T00:02Z,"Whoever ups these when the bigger sites miss it (as they often seem to), I really appreciate it. Thanks!"
,rcoldks,2012-04-29T00:11Z,Thanks for uploading this.
,PKSMEAT,2012-04-29T00:18Z,"After I started watching the show, I got a virus warning for ""HackTool:Win32""

Not sureit's from this torrent, but be advised"
,daddyjerz,2012-04-29T00:38Z,"Thanks to poster first and fore most... Can anyone confirm that the torrent is clean?  I typically stay away from none ""skull holders"" but have been waiting for this all damn night lol.. thanks"
,Ayasugi,2012-04-29T01:34Z,"Thanks for the upload, i wasn't able to find this on any of my other trackers. 
Scanned with Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essentials, both files are CLEAN."
[H],politux,2012-04-29T01:34Z,This is legit.  Checked by me.
,daddyjerz,2012-04-29T01:46Z,"the 2 comments after mine arent showing up for some reason.... if you answered my question, thank you but I can see it lol"
,daddyjerz,2012-04-29T01:47Z,nevermind I see them now!! thanks polutix and ayasugi for your quick responses and thank YOU Anoymous :D 
,eigosensei,2012-04-29T02:06Z,Good quality download
,baybreeze,2012-04-29T02:09Z,I used the avast and I didn't get any negative results. I am watching the show now and it says its okay. 
,shonangc,2012-04-29T02:12Z,"The same torrent on the other sites has the extension ""exe"", not ""torrent"". 

Also, yesterday's larger torrent of the same show was rar'ed, and then rar'ed again inside that rar with the inside rar having a link to get the password.

I'm waiting for a new torrent."
[H],politux,2012-04-29T02:34Z,@shonangc this torrent is clean.  Read the comments.  I know what I'm talking about.  But if you don't like it I guess it is your loss.
,zygarch,2012-04-29T03:24Z,"Anon, I was on the verge of panicking-- I get very grumpy without my Maher. Thanks for coming to the rescue ~  : ) 
Files are A-okay! "
[T],theburningbush,2012-04-29T04:09Z,"Thank you, anonymous! I'm glad you came through with this when everyone else dropped the ball.

As to your files being suspect or suspicious: what a load of BS crap stirred up by a bunch of know-nothings!"
,lovelylogic,2012-04-29T04:34Z,geez glad I wasnt the only one in a panic.. seriously wondered of the show ever aired... THANKS!
,seancl,2012-04-29T04:48Z,"Thanks.  Really appreciate.  We don't get Real Time on tv here, so I rely on torrents"
,jickle13,2012-04-29T05:26Z,thanks stranger!
,shonangc,2012-04-29T05:56Z,"@politux, I did read the other comments, but what I said is true. If you search for the show on torrentz dot eu you get a listing of a half-dozen or so sites. Two of them I tried, and in both cases the ""torrent"" that was going to be downloaded had an ""exe"" extension. Why would that be?

After reading your comment, though, I did finally get my linux system to open piratebay's magnet links in azureus, and the download went fine and the video appears legit."
,extraTom,2012-04-29T05:59Z,"Thanks for this, you're a hero for upping this when the scene forgot. Thank you!! (Also thank you to the scene for all your hard work, muchos appreciations from here!)"
,cipherpunks,2012-04-29T06:13Z,"I couldn't get this to play, it had glitches. Looks like a corrupt file to me."
,jickle13,2012-04-29T07:14Z,came back to say great episode!
,cipherpunks,2012-04-29T17:44Z,This file is corrupted and has many glitches in playback. The Overtime part seems to play OK but not the main show. Do not download. Get some other version.
