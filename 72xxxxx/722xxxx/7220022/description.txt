"Noosphere Rising"

Jack attempts to find Teller's 
mysterious workshop and winds up 
aiding another professor, Logan, to 
win big at poker. Meanwhile, a young 
Italian man creates a viral video to 
track down the love of his life, whom 
he only met in passing, and a city 
slicker who plans to sell off his 
dead father's ranch, winds up 
learning a lesson from a horse that 
makes him appreciate the rural life 
his father chose. Then, Martin's 
sister-in-law, Abigail Kelsey, visits 
Clea and Jake at the board-and-care 
facility, much to Martin's dismay.
