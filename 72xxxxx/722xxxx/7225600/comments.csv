Remember, all seeders go to heaven!"
,ToasterStrudelz,2012-04-29T04:24Z,"Hey, I haven't had the chance to test this wrapper yet. I've been busy working on my own port of a different game. Anyone wana tell em if it works?"
,lorand7,2012-04-29T11:52Z,"I get the following message:

 Program Error

The program WalkingDead101.exe has encountered a serious problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience.

This can be caused by a problem in the program or a deficiency in Wine. You may want to check the Application Database for tips about running this application.



... What should I do?"
,jonne.zoide,2012-04-29T12:48Z,"Thanks for the up, it worked great for me, until I started changing resolution, then it went crazy, and couldn't figure out how to get it back again. Still, until I started messing with it, it worked great."
,ToasterStrudelz,2012-04-29T15:41Z,"@lorand This message appears when you try opening the game?

@jonne.zoide Which resolution are you trying to change it to? I had no issue changing to 1280x800, but haven't gone higher yet.

Also, I forgot to mention, some ports have compatibility issues with OSX Lion. This is a Wineskin port, so that may be the issue. I'll work on making my own port of the game using CiderX so it can be more compatible."
,MLPwny,2012-04-29T15:56Z,"Downloading now, hopefully this works! "
,Gekkieaap,2012-04-29T16:02Z,Works Great! Only the sound is not working. Beside that it's a freaking greaat game!
,ToasterStrudelz,2012-04-29T16:11Z,"Okay, I've ported using CiderX. Torrent here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7227219"
,jonne.zoide,2012-04-29T17:12Z,"@ToasterStrudelz: I had 1280*800 to begin with, wanted to go all the way up to 1920*1200 fullscreen. I'm running 10.6.8 so it's not Lion. But I'll give your other torrent a go, thanks for that one as well. 

As I said it looked great, before I started messing with it."
,joaolonas,2012-04-29T17:38Z,"Hei, thanks so much for uploading this wonderful game and thrilling story. Its working great on OX 10.7.3 . Had only a couple of times where it froze momentarily and I thought I was gonna get eaten but it carried smoothly after.
Im seeding and looking forward to nr 2!!"
,ToasterStrudelz,2012-04-29T17:47Z,@jonne.zoide I don't have a monitor that support 1920x1200. :/ Only 1920x1080. Otherwise I'd see if it could be fixed. Sorry.
,jonne.zoide,2012-04-29T17:58Z,"No problem, I understand. I'll try your other torrent hopefully that  will work, and I won't touch the resolution. ;)"
,elleadnih,2012-04-29T23:21Z,"Works great on Mac OS X version 10.7.3.

,superrkoman,2012-04-30T00:34Z,"the game lags, ( and no its not my mac, my mac runs skyrim smoothly) its the game "
,Demondays1,2012-04-30T02:44Z,"Ok guys listen, people thought I took the wrapper from portingteam, but I didnt take anyones wrapper, I know hot to port my own games. Just because someone uploaded the wrapper, doesnt mean I took it. Look at the date the wrapper was posted and look in mine, mine was uploaded first before him. Get some proof before you acuse. I can no longer seed games, internet been acting weird lately. I do not take anyones port without asking for permission, I test out my ports to see they work 100%, my the walking dead game works great. I probably wont upload any more torrent games af of now, ill only upload them once my internet acts unweird."
,ToasterStrudelz,2012-04-30T05:29Z,"I apologize, Demondays1, also, DanIsTheMan has told me he doesn't want his port to be associated with piracy. Therefore, I would like to let all of you know that his wrapper was only a way to package the game that I'M distributing. He has no part in this activity whatsoever. :)"
,Gekkieaap,2012-04-30T07:10Z,"Guys its work for me great, sometimes its hanging, but thats for 3-4 seconds and the sound is not working, but its not laggin for me. I have every settings on Low and Screen Resolution is 1280x800."
