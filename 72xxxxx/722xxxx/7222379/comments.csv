Συνέχεια του debtocracy πολύ καλό."
,sxizo,2012-04-28T16:07Z,"Hi, and thanks for uploading. Is there an srt file available with Greek subs for the non-greek audio parts of the film?"
,thanost,2012-04-28T23:19Z,"@victorache1979 
It's not only Greek. The spoken languages in the documentary are Greek, English, French, German and Spanish (Luis Sepulveda). 
As described in the title, this torrent has English subtitles. We are working on Spanish, German and French subs.

@sxizo
We just uploaded this torrent

with greek subtitles.

thank you"

Thank you, I was aware of this torrent as well. I am just seeking an external subtitles file. My opinion is that the original -embedded- subs are using a small font size. 
Nonetheless, thank you for responding, and for distributing this extremely interesting piece of work."

by tomorrow there will be a complete download site which will include the Greek and English srt files separately.

FYI
The following Greek torrent has bigger subtitle font than the English version or the one streaming.
