,Serravax,2012-04-28T23:24Z,"Seems clean and it's working, thanks."
,mwalsher,2012-04-29T23:32Z,"Hmm, FOSI doesnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t have the latest version on his site yet (or maybe itâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s already been replaced with something else)."
,mwalsher,2012-04-29T23:33Z,"Nope, wait; there it is. I just had to refresh a couple of times to rotate it in.

Thanks anyway."

,Viciously,2012-05-18T20:24Z,Has stopped working. I downloaded again yesterday and installed again. Not working at all. Doesn't even start. Comes for like 3 second in the task manager and then disappears.
,Bean-Bandit,2012-05-18T23:43Z,Same here. Matter of fact this just happend today. It was working for me yesterday or earlier this morning but not now.
,ravenrappy,2012-05-19T01:42Z,"For some reason, it won't load if the date on your computer is past may 17th, so you have to set the date back. You're welcome."
,Bean-Bandit,2012-05-19T06:29Z,They have a new version out 3.5.1
,Viciously,2012-05-19T10:34Z,"I am using 3.4.6 after yesterday when this one wasn't working. Going to stick with it until a proper version is out. 3.5.1 or any. AND no!, we wont shift our clocks back."
