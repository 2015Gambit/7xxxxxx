I only upload the ones I buy for class. I don't have sources to get free SM/TB. If you can't find it anywhere on the web for free, I would recommend buying it and uploading it here on the bay. "

where do you test banks?"

I usually get my test banks from this site in Canada. They are quick and cheap. I am not stuck on any one supplier just mainly who is the cheapest. "

anyhow, I ignore it since my PC is full of viruses already....... this file contains all chapters but answers are somehow mixed up...or wrong.
dont rely on the answers."

There is no virus on this at all. I personally purchased it and uploaded it. Also the answers were fine for me. Got me a A+ in the class so idk if I should trust the solution manual or some random troll on tpb... thanks for the input though"
