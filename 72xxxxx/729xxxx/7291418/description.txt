In today`s world, peace is hard to come by. When personal desires are followed, serenity is forfeited. By submitting one`s life to God, a peace-filled life is ensured. Maintaining peace is a choice, says Joyce Meyer, as she discusses how to be at peace with yourself, the importance of having peace with God, and the paradox that peace equals power. Joyce says peace is one of the greatest gifts God has given us, and is the only way to true happiness.
