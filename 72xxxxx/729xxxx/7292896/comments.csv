This definitely contains a virus in the keygen. 

One of the things the keygen virus does is create a hidden/system DLL file called bassmod.dll, which cannot be deleted, at least not easily, and which appears to contain malicious code. "

The keygen with this will disable your computer's ability to BOOT. Only if you have a good system restore point will you be able to recover. 

I tested this in a virtual box virtual machine and it is very nasty. 

If you do download this, BE CERTAIN to set a Windows restore point just before you install, so that you can recover your system if the keygen trashes your machine. 

Ironically, the keys created by the keygen are actually valid. So, if you create keys within a safe virtual machine, save them, then you can download the main install direct from the manufacturer and use the keys you made inside the virtual machine."
