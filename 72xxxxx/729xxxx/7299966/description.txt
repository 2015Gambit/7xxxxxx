Seventh Day Slumber is a Christian rock band from Dallas, Texas formed in 1996. They were an independent band for five years. until signed to BEC Records in 2005.

The band's name Seventh Day Slumber comes from Genesis 2:2 where on the seventh day, after creating the universe, God rested.

Seventh Day Slumber's lyrics mostly focus on issues such as suicide, drugs, home abuse, drinking, sex, and general feel good party songs. For example the meaning for the album "Finally Awake" was quoted by the band as "The message of this album is clear. We want to empower kids to stop looking to the media, to what the world tells them they have to be, to find identity. You donΓÇÖt have to be what everyone else tells you to be or even what we think you should be." One song (Caroline) is about Rojas's mother in law, she went through hard times after a divorce.
