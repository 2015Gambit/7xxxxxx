BritainΓÇÖs favourite building?

Few buildings inspire as much affection as the BBCΓÇÖs Television Centre in West London, and as they like to say on MTV Cribs ΓÇô this is where the magic happened.

Where else in the world could you walk out of Swap Shop and straight into an episode of It AinΓÇÖt Half Hot Mum?

Contributions come from former BBC2 controller Sir David Attenborough, ex-TOTP dancers PanΓÇÖs People and a trio of Doctor Who companions, who reminisce about how the place positively fizzed with energy.

Or where else could you look out of your office window to see a world tap dancing record being set or even a hovercraft performing a three-point turn?
