,alex22408,2012-07-03T11:40Z,these are all safe to download right??
,Whiskrs,2012-07-27T22:20Z,"alex22408: piratebay is the only torrent site that I trust everything is real and not fake from copyright holders or with viruses.  Also, look to where it says who it is uploaded by.  In this case it says ""exmnova"" and there is a pink skull next to the name.  Hover your mouse over the pink skull and it says ""trusted"".  This means it is a trusted uploader who everyone knows is down.  So, in future you can check this and not ask if every single torrent is safe."
