,onozelder,2012-05-22T21:25Z,"anyway the content of this Whale Wars series is already extremely poor ... what have we seen the first 3 episodes ???? 
nothing more but blablabla

if this is going to be the same I will have had it with ""Whale Wars"""

,tjugoettnollnoll,2012-05-23T23:17Z,Why does no better release come up?
,bengan148,2012-05-26T06:31Z,"Pretty cool that nothing actually happened in 5 episodes.
Still funny to see that somethings never change, Sea Sheppard remains insane."
,thecat18,2012-05-27T06:44Z,Thanks for sharing.
,iPlunder,2012-05-30T11:23Z,"Pimp Twzt posted Viking Shores S01E05 & S01E05 on Demonoid in MUCH higher quality: 1.15 GB and 1.34 GB.
You'd have been more appreciated if you'd re-posted them here in the same quality or at least a 300 MB file instead of this poor quality.
Now you know, so step it up next time.
Thanks for trying.

As for bengan148 saying ""Pretty cool that nothing actually happened in 5 episodes.""
I haven't yet watched the final 2 episodes, but even if ""nothing happened"" as in killing whales, SeaShepard accomplished a lot by raising awareness of the slaughter and drawing the eyes of the world upon the practice. That's a damn good start!
Slavery was once practiced for generations, and there used to be a wall imprisoning the citizens of East Berlin. Those are now a part of history, and hopefully soon the grind will be too."
,bengan148,2012-05-31T11:04Z,"iPlunder: I take it as you actually approve of Sea Shepherd actions. If you want a whole island to stop gathering their own recourses and culture you are definitely stepping into deep water. Hell lets stop breeding cows, sheep and trout...

Sea Shepherd and Paul should just suck it up and stop with their terrorist actions.  Still funny to see how weird their minds are, could actually call it a cult."
,axp0460,2012-06-05T21:51Z,come on i watch this on a 42'' and it looked like perfect quality for whale wars 180mb cant beat it next time though 128 on audio
,allmypeople,2012-07-15T20:57Z,download the ep from demonoid.. this is unwatchable
