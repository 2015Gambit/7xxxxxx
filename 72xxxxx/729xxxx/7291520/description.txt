DESCRIPTION:

History buffs love to immerse themselves in the details of past eras. But sometimes, one can get bogged down in the minutia of times gone by and 
fail to grasp the significance of the bigger picture. This volume from historian James Johonnot is the antidote to overly compartmentalized history texts, 
offering a broad perspective on the major events that coalesced to shape the world we live in.
