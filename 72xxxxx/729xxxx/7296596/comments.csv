,Amosis,2012-05-25T00:33Z,I can't see anyone with more than 0%. What's up with that?
,Amosis,2012-05-25T00:46Z,According to utorrent No one has any of this though Piratebay says there are 22 seeders.
,lev6970,2012-05-25T02:49Z,Still at 0.0% after 90 minutes...
,snowdreamer,2012-05-25T05:07Z,Same here very strange
,blackchap,2012-05-25T05:32Z,I remember a few post ago they mentioned a possible block from the UK side that may stop the download of this.
,blackchap,2012-05-25T05:36Z,"Here is what he posted back in april ,wonder is this has happened now

The Pirate Bay must be blocked by UK ISPs. 

If i get blocked it looks like you'll have to go to demonoid to get Corrie
