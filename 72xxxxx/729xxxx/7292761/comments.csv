http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7278976/Autodata_3.38

I installed latest C++ re-distributional 2010 
I burned to DVD and ran install.cmd 
I selected Yes when prompted for dependencies
Files copied to hard drive OK
Downloaded AutoData 3.38 crack by crash01gl 
I ran crack.bat - successful
I run cmd as admin by pressing ctrl+shift+enter
I changed directory to cadcda2
I ran regsvr32 ChilkatCrypt2.dll - successful
I changed compatablity of ADBCD.exe to windows xp sp2

I run ADBCD.exe (also as admin) - ERROR

ERROR 1 - small box with red cross (no message)
ERROR 2 - ""please insert DVD""

This works on windows xp no problem so why is it not working on windows 7?
Someone must be able to work this out!!

If anyone could help us out we would really appreciate it!"
