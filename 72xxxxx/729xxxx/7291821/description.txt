Johnny Robinson's sole studio LP remains a lost classic of Memphis soul. Produced by Willie Mitchell during one of his rare sabbaticals from the Hi Records stable, Memphis High captures a rougher, earthier sound than Mitchell's landmark work for Al Green or Ann Peebles but proves well suited to Robinson's gritty, impassioned approach. Robinson is a quintessential deep soul balladeer, rooted in gospel and haunted by demons. Mitchell's slow-burning arrangements mirror the intensity of his subject, evoking the purity and turmoil of his psyche. [The CD reissue also includes six bonus tracks comprising Robinson's three subsequent singles for Okeh, most notably the poignant double-sided effort "Poor Man"/"When a Man Cries."]
