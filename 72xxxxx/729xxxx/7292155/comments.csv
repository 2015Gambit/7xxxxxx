,disnfab,2012-05-24T14:37Z,In Canada Y&R episodes are shown a day in advance so: May 21 Canada = May 22 US! :)
[T],MsFenmore,2012-05-24T17:38Z,"Exactly...and I safe my episodes with the Can-airdate...thatÂ´s why I put ""US-Show2 in the description""...I know itÂ´s a little bit confusing though..."
,LittleMama123,2012-05-24T20:00Z,"Thanks for that, I actually had no idea that here in Canada we were a day ahead!  Thanks for the clarification!"
