When New York State's Gandalf Murphy & the Slambovian Circus of Dreams issued its self-titled debut album in 1998, the outr√© rocking folk ensemble (or is it the other way around?) merely hinted at what they would get up to as they continued to play out in small clubs and tour coffeehouses around the East Coast near and far from their Hudson River Valley home. They grew not only in their ability to command the craft of songwriting, they learned to be entertainers, a show band that could deliver musically, stretching itself to the limit and branching out musically and lyrically. As evidenced by their sophomore offering, Flapjacks from the Sky, Gandalf Murphy & the Slambovian Circus of Dreams is simply one of the finest American bands out there on the road.
