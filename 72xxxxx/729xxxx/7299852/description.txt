From PAD's web site:

"Because they bring back and update the grand tradition of
the Lee Hazlewood/Nancy Sinatra duet, seasoning it with a
syncopated and direct style of vocal interpretation;

Because the musical past of each member and the frugality
of means and arrangements are the recognizable, yet always
fresh ingredients of solidly built songs, undressed of
musical will-o'-the-wisp gimmicks; (...)

Because they baptize the band with a resonant, mnemonic
name that eases one's conception of a symbolic context
(narrative and contemporary) for the project's sound and
its songs;

Because they wrap up the musical object in a graphical work
that is simultaneously allusive and elusive; (...)

Ladies and gentlemen, let us salute the debut of Dear
Telephone, and the birth of Birth Of A Robot."
