1. Villagers will trade items (they are cheap bastards, though!)

2. Added a currency item

3. A few minor terrain changes

4. A new useful block/item (requires obsidian)

5. Added a /seed command for showing the map seed

6. Added sandstone stairs

7. A lot of smaller changes and fixes
