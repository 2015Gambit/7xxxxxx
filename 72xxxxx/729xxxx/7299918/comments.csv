Thanks anyway."
,FatFreddy491,2012-05-30T03:07Z,"MarqueeUltra, i have all the versions of this movie, vhs, dvd, the two different blurays, these scenes are rough cut, rushes, and will remain as separated bonuses forever.BUT this version ya downloaded was just an essay, in two days top, i'll upload the new extended cut, i've fixed all the sounds fx glitches, the music (now the music fits when he starts running, and fits to the scene where he runs before falling in the water.you'll see, it's so much better.
I did this version because fox will never do it."
