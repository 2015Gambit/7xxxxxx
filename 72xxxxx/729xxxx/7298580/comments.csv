,heenan420,2012-05-29T23:14Z,Downloaded and just viewed .... Video is great but audio is    echo- E ( heh ) and out of sync i readjusted to about -350 ish dont remember and resynced (not a prob for that) but the audio id give a 3 to 4. Thanks for the upload. my kids will watch it reguardless Thanks again
,coolaspen,2012-06-01T18:05Z,R5 is region 5 for DVDs so when audio is cam them this is a CAM copy and not a DVDRip nor an R5. The title is quite misleading.
,Le Wobbler,2012-06-02T11:19Z,Great picture awful audio V8 A3 actually changes into Russian (I think) at the end of the film - from what I saw looks a very amusing and very well animated movie.  Must find a decent copy to watch again.

AUDIO - 1 or worse

Actually i made my acc thanx to you "" boobsman "" ... because i just wanted to ask.. WHY the F**K do you need to eat at the same time.. As if it's bad enought audio but you HAVE to eat .. :) That ruined the movie for me... -.-

I don't recommend it to any1 :) Rather wait the DVD rip :)"
,AnonymousBasterd,2012-07-07T03:05Z,"For those people who doesn't read the description:

Note: 
This release has CAM audio, if your not happy with that please wait for another copy :)

Video: GREAT!
Audio: SUCKS!

Alternative: Wait for a clear audio and embed/re-sync it to this one."
,tpbpolo,2012-07-20T07:27Z,"Why do people tag their releases with something it's clearly not? Tagging it with DVDRip when there is CAM-audio is simply wrong. People can smell a rat, and if anything it just makes WBZ look stupid. "
