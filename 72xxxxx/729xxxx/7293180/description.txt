FSX RNZAF A-4K Kahu Package & Repaint

The RNZAF strike capabilty came to an end in 2003 when the combat wing of the RNZAF was disbanded due to being 'clapped out'.

At the time the RNZAF A-4K Skyhawk was the most up to date and capable A4 still operating in the world. Unique to this model was the head up display and weapons system that coupled with the aircraft nimble nature, made for a worthy opponent to allied aircraft of the time worth millions more. It wasn't uncommon for the RNZAF pilots to oversome adversaries in 'Beat Ups' during multi nation exercises.
