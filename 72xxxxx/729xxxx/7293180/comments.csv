The .Air File in the airplane directory works to fix some issues on the RAZBAM Skyhawk Vol 1, Vol2 and Vol3 packages when porting them from FS9 to FSX. I'm on it right Now."

,rhys6666,2012-05-24T01:09Z,"Now, it's not, LOL, I'm only using it .air file to fix the FDE of the old FS9 Razbam Series!!

I think I can use The Skyhawk Vol 4 too but not sure, i'll give a try both ways."
