,nairobi19,2012-06-08T23:27Z,"piece of crap, no way to uninstall it, no sound, crappy adverts for some arabian shop in-game, does not work with vice city multiplayer - WASTE OF TIME"
,MrAwesomeLuis123,2012-06-23T21:25Z,"this works. if you dont know how to install then just extract installer then click on it where you extracted it too,. that is already 2 copies of the game you'll have. then you choose where to install and after you do install it, took me maybe 5 minutes at most didnt feel long. the click on the .exe with the picture. 3 copies in total but no worries this game is only like 1 gb and 3 copies that 2 are compressed only will take up 2.5 gb at most"
