This Computer Based Training (CBT) course, teaches the subject of Aeroplane Mass and Balance up to the standard required by the EASA Air Transport PilotΓÇÖs Licence syllabus.

After completing the course the student pilot will be able to understand, construct and check an aeroplaneΓÇÖs load and trim sheet. In order to assist students in their preparation for the ATPL Aeroplane Mass and Balance exam, this course includes many worked examples as well as a large number of EASA ATPL-style questions and answers.

Though the course is meant primarily for student professional pilots, we hope that general aviation pilots who wish to expand their knowledge will find much to interest them, to this end single and multi piston engine aeroplane mass and balance is fully covered.
