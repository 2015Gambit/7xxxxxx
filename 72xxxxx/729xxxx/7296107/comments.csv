,anouarino,2012-09-20T17:08Z,"I have finally managed to get Airframes and Systems CBT working ! Here are the steps :
1 - Download Alcohol 120 %
2 - Download Mass & Balance CBT from here h**p://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7296107/ATPL_Mass_and_Balance_CBT
3 - Install the Mass & Balance CBT, mount the MDS file with Alcohol and then disable the dvd drive from the control panel
4 - Install this CBT normally, then just copy the file MB-Menu.exe (Program FilesOAAmediaATPL Mass and Balance/system) and paste it in (Program FilesOAAmediaAirframes, Systems and Emergency Equipment/system)

That's it ! It's working 100 % ! Please upload all the CBTs from Oxford Aviation Academy... Especially the Principles of Flight one. "
