Coney Hatch is a Canadian hard rock band who released 3 albums in the 1980s. Based in Toronto, Ontario, the band consisted of vocalist and guitarist Carl Dixon who would also go on to play with April Wine and a Burton Cummings-less Guess Who for several years, as well as touring solo and releasing at least two solo albums; vocalist and bassist Andy Curran who had his own solo album featuring the semi-hits, "License to Love" and "No Tattoos"; guitarist Steve Shelski who has written several instrumentals for TSN; and drummer Dave 'Thumper' Ketchum. They released their first album in 1982. Ketchum left the band in 1983, and was replaced by Barry Connors who formerly drummed with Toronto. In April, 2008 Carl Dixon was very seriously injured in a car accident in Australia. On August 5, 2010 the original Coney Hatch line up including the now recovered Carl Dixon played a reunion show at the Phoenix Concert Theatre in Toronto. It was the first performance from the original line up since 1993. A further live date was scheduled for the Firefest rock festival in Nottingham, England on 23 October 2011.
