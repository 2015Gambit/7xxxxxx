You wanna see what a real discography looks like, check out either The Rolling Stones or Kiss."
,UnderworldDemon666,2012-05-22T21:52Z,"@BaronVonWatermelon: I hear what you're saying, but I take requests, and this group was on the list.  If you would like me to put together a Kiss or The Rolling Stones discography, please email me.  But please do not start a flame war."
