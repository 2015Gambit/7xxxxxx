,HezelSon,2012-05-24T10:34Z,Crack doesnÂ´t work!
,arainc,2012-05-30T06:06Z,"hezel, yes it does, at least win 7, 64 bit.  But there are no directions with the rar file.  

disconnect from internet prior to installing.  Or use firewall to block the installer.  It seems to take about 30 extra seconds during initial install phase and at the very end of the install as the program auto-detects internet connection.  When the program FINISHED installing, it will automatically launch and prompt that you have 7 day trial, or you can register email address and get 30 days trial, or enter activation code. 

Exit out of the program completely, then copy the crack into the XaraXara Web Designer MX PremiumProtein folder.

Then relaunch the program.  it should load with no problems.  And you can connect to internet."
