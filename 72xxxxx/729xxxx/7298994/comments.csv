,ChasUGC,2012-08-04T17:26Z,"This makes no sense. If it is a free Anti-virus program, as described in your title, then why do you need a serial key? You don't need serial keys for free programs. Better yet, go to AVast, download the ""free"" version there, use it free until 2099, and avoid trojans, spyware and possible viruses that you will most likely get here.
