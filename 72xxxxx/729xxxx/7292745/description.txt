Sportsman's Best Offshore Fishing Guide

If you're not paying attention, finding a fish in the ocean can be a lot like finding a needle in the haystack. If you are paying attention you'll learn exactly what to look for to make your next bluewater trip a success. From outfitting your boat and cockpit, to learning the key offshore strategies that offshore skippers from the Gulf, around Florida and up the east coast, need to know. If you're an offshore angler, or want to become one, and want to learn how to fish with a kite, or rig up for swords, or set up your cockpit for fast speed wahoo trolling, seeing it done is a far easier way to learn than reading about it. Climb aboard with the editors of Florida Sportsman magazine as they fish with some of the best bluewater captains trolling and fishing our offshore waters.

Filled with excellent offshore strategies, this combo set brings together a comprehensive guide written by Florida Sportsman's pro staff along with a bonus DVD that makes the book come to life.
