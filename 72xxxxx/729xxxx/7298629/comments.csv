,MAA11792,2012-05-28T21:58Z,"This is a spot on release, everything works and the game runs great and smoothly and for that I'm or rather are we all grateful for. On the other hand this game sucks so hard and I can't honestly comprehend why Codemasters would choose to screw this series of games up even more in the ass buy creating something that is simply full of shit and flaws and I’m happy to say that I will never ever again buy anything from Codemasters in my entire life – thank you all pirates out there for releasing this piece of shit game so that we actually have the chance to try it out before spending our hard earned money on [no offence towards my fellow American pirates or its citizens] an Americanized piece of shit software that would be better off in Mrs. Biebers room alone!

DiRT – Was worthless, cheap graphics and bad handling.
DiRT2 – Was worthless, better graphics and handling but too much of this baja and advertisements everywhere which just looks silly.. not to the actually gameplay.
DiRT3 – Was worthless, nothing really new was added except more advertisements and useless baja and more of them fake rally stages (like running the same stage more than 25times in a row forth and back with a few sets of cars, even more advertisement).

To be honest, the several previous rally games that were been made by Codemasters was not really that good either, nor the handling but you had at least a hundred stages to rally on, several real rally team that were up to date and almost no advertisement.

Fuck you Codemasters for releasing this piece of shit game and I’m glad that I DID NOT BUY IT!

,figssss,2012-05-28T22:40Z,"Ok. I registred myself just to say:
 THIS GAME SUCKS!
I'm not an hardcore critic, usualy I can always find something good in the bad, and normaly I play  the game for at least 1 hour before I have an opinion.
 But in this case, this is one of the wrost car games I ever played. I prefer Destruction Derby wich was released in 1996, than this pille of crap!"
,figssss,2012-05-28T22:42Z,BTW: Thank you extremeszone and FAIRLIGHT. The instalation and gameplay were perfect.

,SlinkyInc,2012-05-28T23:05Z,"Thanks E-zone!! The game runs great, but it wont let you enable auto save, so it dosent save when you quit, so you loose all your progress and settings every time. And as they say in here the game is bad, has nothing to do with driving. Or cars for that matter :-))P.s In my book there is only ONE rally gamesim, and it`s the late and great ""Richard Burns Rally"" it`s old and very difficult to master, I know, but so is a real rally car if you want to go fast. Thats real rally experience "
