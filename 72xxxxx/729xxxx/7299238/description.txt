Heroes of WW II 
The heroes on the battlefield, were matched by their civilian counterparts, who helped to liberate the free world by deciphering enemy codes, designing better aircraft and inventing war-winning machinery and ordnance. From pathfinding pilots to scientists, from the officers confronted with Hitler's atrocities at Belsen to the inventors of radar ; they all played a part in hastening the end of the most cataclysmic conflict ever.

Weapons of WW II 
In 1939, the world went to war using obsolete weaponry. In order to gain supremacy it was necessary for an army of designers, inventors and manufacturers to develop and manufacture more and more sophisticated killing machines. In this series "WEAPONS OF WORLD WAR II" the development of each weapon system is addressed from the outbreak of war through to its peak in 1945.

Episode 17 : The Battleship

At the beginning of World War II, battleships were seen as the key weapon at sea, their huge firepower dominated the waves but over the next six years their vulnerability was exposed by the submarine and aircraft. This programme looks at the great clashes of the ships such as Bismarck and King George V and the way in which the battleships' role changed to that of shore bombardment and escort work.
