,Dr.Gonzo1982,2012-05-24T07:57Z,Thank you so much for Transformers. Keep it up.
,DracoRincewind,2012-05-24T08:03Z,"Hank you for all the great uploads. I have just stated on reading the  IDW Transformers comics and you have been a great help.

Now I hate to ask this but I don't know where else to turn. I was wondering if you had Stormbringer,  Escalation, and Devestation. And if you do would you be willing to post them. I only ask because out of all the IDW titles I have looked for so far these seem to be the only ones not currently available through torrent. And the only DDLs I have found are incomplete. So any help would be appreciated. "

My previous post was supposed to say ""Thank you for all the great uploads."""

That should be what you need Draco."
