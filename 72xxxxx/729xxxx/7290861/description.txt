Published: 1996-06-27 | ISBN: 0415144205 | PDF | 264 pages | 9.29 MB

In this authoritative volume, Patrick Ottaway draws on his extensive experience of urban archaeology to show how our conception of the early history of British towns has been radically changed over the last twenty five years.

Based on his day to day involvement in the field, this study highlights some of the most important discoveries and research themes of recent years, showing how long term urban research projects have revealed new information about towns and the lives of their inhabitants.
Well illustrated and highly readable, this volume offers a series of engaging and evocative case studies. It also highlights the work of the urban archaeologist, and the problems inherent in preserving our past, when the interests of archaeology and property development clash.
