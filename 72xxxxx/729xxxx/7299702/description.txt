SYNOPSIS
--------
I usually do not mess with apps. that others have made.. out of respect. But
PortableAppz does such a shitty job with is apps., and i've been waiting long
enough for him to fix "NeroPortable". It doesn't work .. either x32bit systems
or x64bit systems. 

Of course.. we all know Nero... and there have been plenty of "ThinApp'd" 
versions.. but i have a fetish for "PortableApps.comFormat"! I love my apps in
that format.. it's much cleaner. 

If you do not know the difference between "ThinApp" / "PortableApps.comFormat",
than you don't need this.

DOWNLOAD NOTE
------------- 
if you don't need x64bit.. skip it.. to save yourself some bandwidth.
