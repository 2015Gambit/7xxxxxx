Powerful tool to help you easily migrate a Windows-based computer to a virtual environment (P2V) of a major virtualization software vendor, regardless of how or where the computer is being backed up.

Virtualization Manager Compact allows you to:
P2V Copy - Migrate a physical system to a virtual machine or convert a backup image to a virtual disk. Migrate from 2TB+ physical drive to smaller virtual drive (it's very helpful as most of hypervisors do not support 2TB+ virtual drives).
P2V Adjust - Recover the OS startup ability after an unsuccessful virtualization by a 3rd party tool.
Create VD - Create a virtual disk with a simple wizard.
Support for Major Virtual Machines - Oracle Virtual Box 4; Microsoft Virtual PC; VMware Workstation; VMware Fusion.
