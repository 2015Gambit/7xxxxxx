,illusion121,2012-05-26T03:04Z,"Thanks so much for your hard work Yify. I just realized the language is in French, but I'm guessing it can be changed. Thanks again :)"
,illusion121,2012-05-26T04:17Z,Hmm for some reason I only get French with this version. Unable to switch language for audio at all :(
,dboechat,2012-05-26T21:04Z,"This is the second time I'm having problems with a 3D movie, it seems that the depth is inverted?? What's supposed to be in the foreground is far from the screen and what's in the background is on the front?  :(

Any help with this? My TV is a Samsung 55"" 8000 Series 3D 1080p LED HDTV..."
,OmniusPrime,2012-05-26T22:59Z,"I noticed the same thing - not only is the soundtrack French, but the SBS is flipped - what's on the left should be on the right and vice-versa."
,dboechat,2012-05-27T04:21Z,"Just solved it, my TV has the option to flip the SBS..."
,OmniusPrime,2012-05-27T04:54Z,"@dboechat: Good to know, I'll look for it on my Samsung as well. Doesn't fix the French issue, though ..."
,Pvt_Haskins1,2012-05-27T16:33Z,"Nice uplaod thx

Problem is the 3d is reversed as the other posters said.
I have downloaded alot of your work but this is the first time the sbs was opposite.  I cant find a option to switch this on my 7000 series Samsung.

Any programs out there that can do this for me? "
,dboechat,2012-05-27T23:03Z,"OK I'll explain where the option to reverse SBS is on my Samsung TV. I suppose the option is available for all Samsung 3D TVs.

Go to Menu>Mode>3D>Picture Correction

If it doesn't work the first time, select the option again.
"
,DA_J0K3R,2012-05-29T06:55Z,"@dboechat

I have the 55"" 8 Series 3D LED TV aswell and had the same problem with the image, and tried the picture correction thingy but the image is still messed up.. Didn't fix the problem for me.. did you adjust any other 3D option as well? 

Anyways, YIFY it would be awesome if you could upload it again with the right picture settings.. "
,hamadasco,2012-05-29T17:31Z,is it really french or english?? i wanna know b4 i download
,dboechat,2012-05-30T01:35Z,"@DA_J0K3R

No, it's the only option you have to adjust. Start the movie, turn the SBS 3D on and then go to Picture Correction.

In my case I've paused the movie right on the Disney logo, so I could see when the logo was ""behind"" the castle before and on the front after the correction."
,rypalz,2012-05-30T16:37Z,"guys can u help me solve my problem ,when i play this on vlc i got 2 screens appearing ...the same with the screenshots shown ...solution will be much appreciated tanx..."
,thomasburns,2012-05-31T18:41Z,"Hi, can anyone recommend software for playing 3d files from my PC via HDMI to 3D Samsung TV? 

Many thanks as always to YIFY for the continued hard work and awesome uploads."
,dboechat,2012-06-02T13:18Z,"AFAIK you can use any software provided that the video is full screen on the TV.

I'm currently using Media Player Classic."
,san222,2012-06-05T19:33Z,"Movie quality is good but Left Right is reversed,works better on Right Left setting on LG 3Dtv"
,tigitank,2012-06-11T10:38Z,"Hello. I just bought VOX 3D LCD 42950. Took me few day to download 14gb Avatar movie and i was soo happy when i saw how good it work. Then i found you YIFI and your 1 hour downloads. Cant tell you how much that made my g/f and me happy. But when i tryed your movies i found out that sides are fliped and that i can watched them only if i turn around my glasses. Any chance to fix this, i dont think that fleeping sides is supported on my TV, soo i am asking you to help me solve this problem as its realy killing my plesure and hurting my nouse to watch with glasses turn around. Thx vm on your effort and work you are doing. All best."
,nbfkjlh,2012-06-11T19:47Z,FRENCH AUDIO ONLY!
,mad_madhav,2012-06-17T03:37Z,"Is this French? Though there is a comment saying it is English, there are many more comments saying it is French. I have already wasted 2+GB download for another Spanish torrent YIFY. Just hope if the tagging handled more carefully, for the ones accessing these valuable shares over slow connection..."
,dboechat,2012-06-19T22:51Z,The audio is in English here.
,gokuu79,2012-06-20T00:37Z,hey yifi are your 3d movies a real 3d dvd rip or are you using a program to convert them to 3d yourself?
,gokuu79,2012-06-20T00:40Z,hey yify are your 3d movies real 3d dvd rips or are you using a program to convert them to 3d your self?
,davin_g,2012-06-22T05:25Z,I have a question. All of YIFYs videos are all pixalated after I burn them and watch them on my Samsung Tv. I use visual hub to convert and burn. Is it just his videos are low quality or is there a trick when burning 3d movies because all other movies I burn the quality is fine. TY YIFY...just wondering if I'm the one doing something wrong.
