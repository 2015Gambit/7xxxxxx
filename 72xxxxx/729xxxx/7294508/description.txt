Panic of Girls is Blondie's first album since 2003's The Curse of Blondie. The album was recorded between OctoberΓÇôDecember 2009 in Woodstock, New York, and May 2010 in Hoboken, New Jersey, being the second album in the band's history to be recorded outside of Manhattan, after 1980s Autoamerican which was recorded in Los Angeles. The band's drummer, Clem Burke, also said that about 35 songs were recorded during the sessions for the album, with only 14 that are going to make the album.[1] He has also said that all band members have contributed to the release, with vocalist Debbie Harry writing most of the lyrics. Original Blondie keyboardist Jimmy Destri planned to contribute to the writing and recording of this album, but was ultimately not a part of it.[2]

The album name came from the lyrics of a demo track recorded for the album: "The End Of The World", which ultimately did not appear on it's final track list. The former names of the album were: Songs From The Red Coat and Panic Of Truth. Finally the album name was eventually changed into Panic Of Girls.

Guitarist Chris Stein has revealed that the band is pushing for a 15-16 track album, with 3 or 4 songs being cover songs, one song in French and two in Spanish, with all English language lyrics written by Debbie Harry.

Two tracks from the album, "What I Heard" and "Girlie Girlie", were included on a special release of the band's 1978 album Parallel Lines that came free with the British newspaper The Mail on Sunday on December 5, 2010. Another song, "Mother", was made available as a free download from the band's website. It would later be announced as the lead single, available for purchase on May 23rd, 2011.
