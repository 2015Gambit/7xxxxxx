 Shame my test of the new capture method didn't work out too popular, would have meant being able to release much sooner after airing but I will keep quality a priority and go back to tried and tested methods"

The problem with the 720p is that Amazon, Itunes and everyone else did not have it available till last night! Im sure it will be up soon! So quit being a bunch of babies! "
