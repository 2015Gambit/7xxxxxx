Far-thinking genius from Tim Buckley -- and one of his most experimental albums ever! Lorca really takes off from the sound of earlier albums -- pushing the jazz side of the spectrum even more, and stretching out on longer tracks that have his vocals riffing a lot more than usual. Backing is relatively spare -- with some nice use of pipe organ and electric piano -- and Tim himself is playing 12-string guitar on the sessions. Tunes are all long, and feature some really haunting, echoey vocals. Bizarre but brilliant.
