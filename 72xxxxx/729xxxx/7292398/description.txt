Ren MacCormack moves from the city of Boston to a small southern town, where life is very different. An accident, in which five teenagers were killed after a night out, shocked the small town's community. The local councilmen and Reverend Shaw reacted to the incident by banning loud music and dancing. Ren stands up to the ban and, in the process, falls in love with the Reverend's daughter.
