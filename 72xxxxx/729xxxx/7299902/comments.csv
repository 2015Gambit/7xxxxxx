It is not found any file specified for ISArcExtract


Can you guys help me, its really annoying. I already tried run it in safe mode."
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-05-27T02:22Z,@driftxkid: Seems like blackbox guys were drunk while doing it. Maybe a fix will be out soon. :)
,driftxkidd,2012-05-27T02:58Z,@BidyaTPB looks like FLT release is this way too... maybe patch from them soon too
,3Dazz,2012-05-27T08:41Z,"The 1st pc I installed this on, had no issues with the names. but when I put it on my games rig, it came up with all this ""avast and yarr"" stuff. Maybe a way of id'ing pirate version?"
,hashuboy,2012-05-27T10:14Z,"well im having some stupid problem dont know what,iv tried installing this game 5-6 times and it doesnt extract to 9gb something it just gets to like 6gb and when i run the game its just sits there ""not responding"" so i have to end it through task manager so anybody else has this problem?????

installation takes around 12 mins for me and i have Win7 32bit please help me guys!!"
,hashuboy,2012-05-27T10:16Z,"to all who r having language problems,u need ""language selector"" by FLT they released it soon after the game goto sceper or rlsbb and search it after installing that ur game's language problem would be gone!"
,maliandro,2012-05-27T11:41Z,"actually its in comments on other trackers that this version had very low quality audio and even worse quality music what totally ruins the game, i would check for myself but it sounds like nobody can even get this version started lol"
,kurimaw14,2012-05-27T11:57Z,good torrent but can't pass through dirt showdown loading screen and then auto closes.. My drivers are all up to date. Any suggestion would be helpful
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-05-27T20:03Z,"Okay Peeps, here is the Yaar Yarr Fix :D

HOW TO


Step 1: Access Windows Firewall settings

http://www.imagehost.co.za/image-6F3E_4FC264F8.jpg

Step 2: Choose ""Allow a program or Feature through Windows Firewall""

http://www.imagehost.co.za/image-5A1F_4FC264F8.jpg

Step 3: Here I chose ""Allow another program"" because Dirt Showdown's exe file was not part of my list

http://www.imagehost.co.za/image-CAA7_4FC264F8.jpg

Step 4: Make sure that the box to the left of ""Dirt Showdown"" is unticked

http://www.imagehost.co.za/image-870A_4FC264F8.jpg

Step 5: Go to ""Advanced Settings""

http://www.imagehost.co.za/image-F1D9_4FC264F8.jpg

Step 6: Now ""Windows Firewall with Advanced Security"" will open up, select ""Inbound Rules""

http://www.imagehost.co.za/image-67A1_4FC2664E.jpg

Step 7: You should see four (4) entries for ""Dirt showdown"" as being greyed out in the list 
PS: If you don't have 4 entries, don't worry, just do the steps below for each of the entries you have.

http://www.imagehost.co.za/image-7B8E_4FC2664E.jpg

Step 8: Right-click the first one and choose ""Properties"" from the popup menu

http://www.imagehost.co.za/image-5542_4FC2664E.jpg

Step 9: Next, the ""Dirt Showdown"" properties window will open, here you need to select ""Block the connection"" radio button, then click on ""Apply"" and ""Ok""



Step 10: To make the rule active, you need to right-click the first entry again and choose ""Enable"" from the popup menu



Step 11: Repeat step 8 - 10 for the other 3 entries

Step 12: Delete the ""showdown_avx.exe"" file if it's still in your directory (VERY IMPORTANT)

Step 13: Once finished, launch the game again, it might still show the info next to your Profile Name as ""Yarr yarr"" but everything else in game should be normal now. You should also be able to select an appropriate audio name too.

Upon exiting and relaunching for a second time, it also removed the last ""Yarr yar"" text next to my profile name.

And that's it, enjoy a ""Yarr yaarrr"" free game  :8=)"

Thanks for that great rip.

Fix for rapid audio extraction/black screen/6GB Size :

By: Farvahar.
OK. I found the fix to the 6gb problem. its cause by user names that have spaces. when you go to C:users if your username is Dr x or anything else with space, the BB.exe file wonâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t work properly. so make a new user(If you know how you can change the name the tell me XD) and reinstall the game in that user. All will be fine."

,afaqahmed43,2012-08-16T14:56Z,"EVERYONE
CANNOT PLAY THIS GAME BELOW WIN 64Bit
that's why you get the message d3d11.dll is missing
it means it needs minimum of DIRECTX11
so dont bother doing anything to run it if you got an OS under win 7 64 bit BTW 32 bit will work i think"
,mobile94ever4,2012-08-18T09:23Z,"         :::ATTENTION EVERY ONE::: 
I have found the BlackScreen Problem which is due to the size which is 6gb.Just Login with administrator account (if u dont know how http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/enable-the-hidden-administrator-account-on-windows-vista/)   Then Simply install the game and play.
