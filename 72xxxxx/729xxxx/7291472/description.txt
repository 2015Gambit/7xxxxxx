 The first magazine devoted entirely to do-it-yourself technology projects presents its 30th quarterly edition for people who like to tweak, disassemble, recreate, and invent cool new uses for technology.

 Until recently, home automation was an unfulfilled promise ΓÇö systems were gimmicky, finicky, user-hostile, or potentially unsecure. But today, thanks to a new crop of devices and technologies, home automation is useful, fun, and maker-friendly. Using smartphones, wireless networks, the internet, simple microcontrollers, and even gesture recognition, DIY-style Smart Homes can now do everything promised and more, for much less ΓÇö and MAKE shows you how in Volume 30.
