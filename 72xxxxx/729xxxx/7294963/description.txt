Primo Ramdisk - Powerful RAM Disk Emulator for Windows
 
http://www.romexsoftware.com/en-us/primo-ramdisk/


Its Ram disk software so that self explanatory ;)
(or go to author's site for more info)


Release Notes:
So I found a patcher for this program from group REPT
but it seems to only work with the 32bit version.

So the 2nd patcher I found and that is included here @ TPB
is from group LnDL and this one works for 32bit AND 64bit installs.
At least I think so anyways, I only tested the 64bit version.
Note, the installer will detect what version you need etc
so if you are running 64bit you get the 64bit version installed etc
I don't see why this shouldn't work for x86 systems,
but if it does not post a comment and I'll upload the 32bit patcher.

This so called patch included simply adds some registration data
into your registry it does NOT actualy modify ANY files on your PC.
I verified this by checking the patcher in a sandbox.

Thanks LnDL :)

PS: looks like we'll have someone to crack FancyCache
once it goes out of beta ;)
I was looking @ cracking FancyCache already and its a bit of
a pain in the ass in my eyes + it comes with a 180 day beta trial
and you can always download a new key file from the forum over there
so not much point in cracking FancyCache yet..
I mention this because these two programs i mentioned are similar
and go well together and are both from Romex.
To get FancyCache go to the Ramdisk link I posted and go from there..
Its a free download (for now)

SuperSpeed Ramdisk seems to destroy peoples computers and they have to reformat to repair the damage and its usualy only the 32bit version
that gets uploaded, so this upload is a better option I think.
