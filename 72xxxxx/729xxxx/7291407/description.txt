Déjà Voodoo is an album by the southern rock jam band Gov't Mule. It was the first Gov't Mule album to feature Andy Hess and Danny Louis as permanent members, and it was also the first album that Gov't Mule did not play live before its release. The title is a reference to the fact that the band believes it rocks just like it used to before the death of former bassist Allen Woody.
