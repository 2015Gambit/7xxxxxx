Afzal Hamid, the lone surviving terrorist from the compound in Afghanistan from where Brody was rescued, has been captured.
Estes wants Saul and Carrie to find out everything he knows about Abu Nazir's plans to attack the US, but there's a catch: Estes wants Brody to help with the interrogation, noting that he's in a unique position due to his previous history with Hamid.
