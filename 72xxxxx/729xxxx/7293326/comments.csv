,MadiZone,2012-05-24T16:22Z,Who broadcasts this show without commentary?
,VladBin,2012-05-24T18:03Z,The video file that was used for creating this video was recorded directly from FEED. Due to this it does not contain any logos or commentaries.  
,andreyyshore,2012-05-24T19:35Z,"@VladBin
So anyone can record the feed, provided they have the equipment? I'd expect the transmission to be encrypted."
,keymakh,2012-05-25T12:47Z,This was awesome! Please upload the next semifinal the same way.
,iceqbeic,2012-05-25T19:46Z,"Hmm... Am having severe sync issues and that's something new. My PC isn't new but it can still handle a heavy lead and the CCCP/media player classic, despite realtime processor setting, I'm losing audio/video sync and have to pause and wind/rewind now and then."
,iceqbeic,2012-05-25T19:46Z,"By the way, that's prolly me! Quality otherwise is great, both audio and video so thank you Anon!"
,ICONOCLAST,2012-05-27T13:11Z,Has this upload been cutted? Is this the full show from beginning to the end?
,dalib0r,2012-05-27T23:28Z,It's cutted. It misses 15 minutes during the voting. So there's no recap of songs. Interval act and revealing finalists are included in video.
