,ironfootx1,2012-06-23T08:41Z,"V 9?  More like V:4.  Looks like total fucking trash.   Hey Sam, leave ""BRRip"" out of the title if you're going to do a shitcan 640*272 encode that's not even suitable for an iPod"
,iwatch,2012-06-28T02:32Z,Hey guys I heard that the piratebay was shut down recently for fbi piracy matters. Is it okay to download now? I don't want to get penalized for a movie dvd release download.
,GunbikeZ,2012-07-02T16:31Z,"Thanks for the UL!



For anyone saying TPB keep getting shutdown its not, TPB doesnt host illegal files nor does one person upload a file, TPB just hosts torrent files thats it, nothing illegal about that"
