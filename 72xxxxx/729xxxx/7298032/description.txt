Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry, Second Edition (10 Volume Set)The ultimate resource on inorganic chemistry ΓÇô new and completely revised, 10 years after publication of the First Edition

The first edition of the Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry treated the elements of the periodic system in alphabetical order, with multiple entries for key elements. The articles from the First Edition were written more than 10 years ago and all areas of inorganic chemistry have seen such a vigorous development that it was necessary to update most articles and to add a considerable number of new articles. The result of this major work is the proud Encylopedia of Inorganic Chemistry Second Edition (EIC-2).

New ΓÇô now includes colour
30% growth on previous edition ΓÇô now 6,640 pages, published in 10 volumes
EIC-2 continues to present articles in alphabetical order, but the content has been slightly reorganized to the following subject areas: Main Group Elements; Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Solid State, Materials, Nanomaterials and Catalysis; and General Inorganic Chemistry, Theoretical and Computational Methods.
