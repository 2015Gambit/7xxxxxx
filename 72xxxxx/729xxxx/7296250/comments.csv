,megarafael,2012-05-24T21:08Z,Working.Playing here.Than you only need to follow the instructions on the readme file.Remember its only a BETA version and only works online.
,nox150690,2012-05-24T21:41Z,"Actually, the included file is a server file. So LAN play is possible. Just tried on my bros pc with net turned off.
Enjoy :D"
,NanoEntity,2012-05-24T21:46Z,"you know you cant play the game without a valid runic account that has TL2 beta code on it.

So yeah this is useful as a toilet paper to wipe your ass with."
,nox150690,2012-05-24T22:18Z,"NanoEntity, thats why it says ""cracked"". It DOES NOT require a beta key, nor the internet. Download it before making assumptions."
,Yamcha67,2012-05-24T22:20Z,"@ NanoEntity Your wrong, I don't even have a runic account and I was able to play this.. It was originally released from SKIDROW so it is legit..

The only thing is It's not a complete game I believe you can only go up to Level 21.."
,snowgoons,2012-05-24T22:29Z,"is this working?
I have a beta (weekend) key, but i forgot to use it
:( so can i just download this and play with my key?"
,nox150690,2012-05-24T22:47Z,"Yamcha67, correct, the BETA only allows you to level up to level 21. Where I downloaded the file from, it said nothing about SKIDROW, however, props to them for the game.

snowgoons, that key is useless now, just download this and you can play, no key needed."
,gianijoker007,2012-05-24T23:42Z,so no single player only multi on internet?
,nox150690,2012-05-24T23:56Z,"gianijoker007, it has singleplayer and multiplayer. Run the suprise.exe

follow the readme

 then choose ""internet"" mode. use any username and password to connect.

This mode just connects to the server file ""suprise.exe"" so you are not really connecting to the net, although multiplayer maybe possible through hamachi."
,nox150690,2012-05-24T23:57Z,LAN Multiplayer is possible without any other software though.
,Brandonx187,2012-05-25T00:16Z,"I'm typing ""start recognition"" in the cmd and it's giving me an error."

,FrostBack,2012-05-25T00:26Z,"Well, seeing as you deleted my comment, I'm going to assume it's a fake."
,Brandonx187,2012-05-25T00:26Z,"Never mind it's working fine, just had to run ""surprise.exe"" as admin mode, thanks for this.

Sorry about triple post."
,FrostBack,2012-05-25T00:26Z,"It disappeared for a bit, sorry about that."
,nox150690,2012-05-25T00:50Z,"FrostBack, it's okay. 

1: I cannot delete comments :D The comments sometimes do not update, especially if you are using a proxy or VPN. It can look like they are being deleted. us the 194.71.107.80 address for faster updates.

2: I never post fake stuff, take a look at other torrents. I try my best to make sure it's legit before posting.

I'm not so sure about LAN Multiplayer capabilities. I have been trying to run 2 clients on my pc, but cannot get them to connect to each other, will try on my bros pc tomoz."
,nox150690,2012-05-25T01:00Z,"FrostBack, if you are having trouble still, make sure you run the program as admin.

i did that allready i was just confused with the server etc.
i had to make one virtual server to play by myself
...
tnx working great and no its not a fake
and about the error just close the suprise.exe and open it again.... the first time i got error too..."
,gianijoker007,2012-05-25T02:09Z,"i think i found the first bug 
the pet doesnt seem to get the health from

and shotgonna ftw :D"
,RonShad,2012-05-25T02:50Z,What is the chance I'll get caught for downloading this?
,gianijoker007,2012-05-25T03:16Z,"oh and also if u exit the game it gets saved 
but u start again from the village
even if u had town portal open it will be gone..."
,ThatTruth,2012-05-25T04:37Z,"@gianijoker007: Why would it? It's a potion, it's not a Heal All spell. Which brings me to my point that it's a shame that spells are less significant in this game with the apparent lack of defense and supplementary spells and the ability to equip pets with spells.

@RonShad: None, if you're too scared to pirate.

I'll be testing out whether or not LAN is possible with the provided software. Hopefully it is, it's definitely a fun game, although it lost a bit on the way from Torchlight 1 and some of the charm of Fate.

Thanks nox150690. I initially had issues because the readme instructed to place the Surprise.exe in C:, though it meant to put it in the root directory where it was automatically downloaded. Everything runs smoothly although I'm getting regular 1-2 second freezes which may be the game or crack."
,Castlemania,2012-05-25T05:01Z,"HELL YES! dont care that its only til level 21, put it on veteran or hardcore and make this game last! this is a instant buy when it comes out for me. im done with blizzard, runic you have filled the void for me"
,FrostBack,2012-05-25T07:50Z,"Still getting the same error, tried running as admin, didn't work. Does it matter that I have UAC disabled?"
,epordwerk,2012-05-25T10:06Z,works very well you can start game with suprise.exe and writ there start recognition and thats it you can play ive already made a video too on youtube but its uploading right now so you can later see gameplay if you want username is :MrN1GG4
,nox150690,2012-05-25T11:47Z,"hi guys, i'm back.

ThatTruth , I have yet to experience the freezes, and I am about to test LAN Multiplayer capabilities. Will post results.

FrostBack, the only things that I can suggest is try changing the directory from the c drive to somewhere else. That may fix the issues."
,gianijoker007,2012-05-25T13:01Z,"@ThatTruth actually the potions work if u take one from inventory and drop it on the up left corner to the ""pet box""   ...also no freezes or other major problems here......  
and btw u dont need to type start recognition but just type start ...
game is great so far hope for a full release soon..
@FrostBack maybe i stupid idea but when i started the first time i got error then i pussed the torchlight.exe and got in the game but couldnt play and then i got out and used the suprise.exe again and had no error ...."
,gianijoker007,2012-05-25T13:16Z,@frostback also someone says that it needs dotnet 4.0 dont know if its true and if it can help u but.....gl.
,Fractal11235,2012-05-25T13:51Z,"Got an issue here that doesnt seem to be covered in the readme or comments anywhere. 
Whats happening is I launch surprise.exe, start recognition seems to work fine, game launchers launches and it brings me to a screen that says ""Beta Activation, Enter TL2 beta key in the box above and click the submit button."" Nothing I do here resolves it. No matter what I enter I get invalid beta key. Any thoughts?"

,FrostBack,2012-05-26T04:13Z,"Still isn't working for me, no matter what I do.

I could try repairing .NET, but I doubt it will help. Well, I'll just have to wait until July or whenever the hell this game is coming out."
,soulcry420,2012-05-26T05:32Z,was wondering how i can get the lan working. any way i can get it to work?
,NitrogenUA,2012-05-26T09:49Z,"This actually works. If having error in Surprise.exe just start the game first, then quit it. Then try Surprise again. It worked for me. Thanks to gianijoker007 for suggestion."
,greylion,2012-05-26T12:11Z,"Just FYI: You might have a sound issue on Windows XP - sound effects mostly don't play, possibly if you have a Realtek sound chip or old audio driver.
Playing in window mode (not fullscreen), or turning down the audio hardware acceleration (from Full) to Standard or Basic seems to fix it:
Control panel - Sounds and Audio Devices - Audio tab - Advanced - Performance tab - first slider.
Don't choose None, it can cause a buzzing sound.

Also, don't expect to be able to Alt-Tab back to the desktop without everything starting to produce ""Program is not responding.."" messages."

,AznAssassin,2012-05-28T06:05Z,"This is how to get the game to work (for those of u having errors etc)

1). Extract folder to wherever (C Drive for most of us)
2). RUN THE GAME FIRST. DO NOT USE THE SURPRISE CMD EXE JUST YET. Just run it via the torchlight 2 exe (NOT the beta exe launcher exe)
3). Go the menu and attempt to log in. You wont be able to (you'll get an error as you should unless u are legally a beta tester and have an account)
4). EXIT THE GAME
5). NOW RUN Surprise cmd exe. Type in 'Start Recognition'. 
VOILA. 
Game now runs according to the crack server. Just login using anything (Just type anything in) and create a new server. 
ENJOY!!!!!

Hope this helps for those of u that are still stuck.

p.s. This is an amazing game. Gameplay wise, this is BETTER than Diablo III (the game D3 should've been)."

,noobzor99,2012-06-04T08:40Z,"Not sure about you, but when I clicked surprise.exe, windows 7 shut down a few seconds later and gave a blue screen, notifying that they will reboot to prevent software damage.

It's not like I blame the coder who made it, but this workaround to get the beta working locally seems to be quite intrusive.

If you've already played the beta I'd say this isn't worth downloading, you'll only get bored of the game and won't be able to enjoy the real thing.

If you haven't, might as well give it a try."
,noobzor99,2012-06-04T12:09Z,you can pre-order the game on steam or perfectworld btw

Wrong, try again. Interestingly, the file you linked has been uploaded anonymously....good luck with that...

I'm sure that people will try it out, however, with the amount of downloads this torrent has got, not to mention the fact you can check out my other torrents, and I always try to help with the programs, I think it's safe to say that my version is legit. Unless you think SKIDROW or myself intentionally upload viruses..."
,nox150690,2012-06-05T21:09Z,"For those asking about the modified server files I was working on for LAN. I have been trying to force the two clients to see each others games, but without any success. I can get both clients to connect to a single server, both through the web and through traditional LAN, however they cannot see each others games. 

I have been rather ill lately, so work on the files has been minimal. tbh, it is probably for the best if work ceases, as I want torchlight II to be a success and I will not be uploading a cracked version of the full release. If anyone ever finds a way of forcing the clients to connect, feel free to share the info and remember to buy the game, it's REALLY worth it :D"
,z0mfg,2012-06-05T21:35Z,"@nox, i doubt you made suprise.exe, however, i found it attacking my local router. This is not virus behavious per say, but it is alarming. The file i linked to did not. 

Regarding linking several clients to the same server has proven futile, i will investigate it further, but so far only experienced the same results as you. Seems like the clients aren't communicating with the server while in game, just through the auth/create game process.."
,S7ryd3r,2012-06-08T00:05Z,"@nox

Runic can apparently see when you try, because in addition to the Lobby server a UPnP/NAT connection attempt is apparently made to Runic's server as well. We tried this over the LAN with a few different computers. Log shows that the client connects to the ""server"" on the other computer on the local IP: ""Net Attempt to connect to server at [192.168.100.100:4549]"", ""Net Client 1 successfully connected.""
Then it shows: ""Lobby Making NAT test connection to 66.151.133.115:4175"". That would be Runic's server, which for some reason the game still tries to connect to for a NAT test even if you changed the IP address like mentioned above. Runic's server promptly sends a Close and NetDisconnect message and the two local computers lose their connection to each other before they can ever see the game. So while the connection is successfully made, it's closed during that NAT test connection immediately after. Games not visible at all.

You can see that in log files in documents, my games, runic, tl2, logs"

,Cbeatse,2012-06-12T02:39Z,"I think a few things need to be reiterated.

1- unless someone manages to figure it out, multiplayer doesn't work with this version

2- The full version of this game has not yet been released, nor has a release date been announced as of yet.

3- To make the game work you need to use something to convince the game it is within the trial period (i.e. prior to June 1), I personally used time stopper, google it.

4- You have to run surprise twice to clear the error, I run it in administrator mode just in case.

5- @S7ryd3r I typically disconnect my system from the internet before trying multiplayer, so I happen to know it's not runic killing the connection that's causing the trouble."

- Turn the date back to anything before June 1 2012, as stated before in a comment. I set mine to May 1. (if you don't do this it will ask for a beta key...which no one has!)

- Run Surprise.exe, type ""start recognition"" the game should prompt (you shouldn't have to click Torchlight2.exe or the Beta.launcher)
