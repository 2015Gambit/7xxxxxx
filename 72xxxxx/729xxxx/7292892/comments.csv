,Agent666,2012-05-31T15:59Z,"# KEYGEN IS USELESS!

# NO PATCH WITH DOWNLOAD

# CAN'T GET THIS TO WORK. RAN KEYGEN CLOSE TO 100 TIMES AND ASHAMPOO REPORTED 'KEY ALREADY ENTERED' - WOULD NOT ACTIVATE!"
,Agent666,2012-05-31T16:27Z,"IT WORKS!

I GAVE UP ON TRYING TO ACTIVATE, WAS GOING TO REINSTALL A PREVIOUS VERSION. ASHAMPOO ACTIVATION CRAP WAS STILL RUNNING, USED TASK MANAGER TO KILL. AFTER THIS, I NOTICED THE GREEN SNAP MENU BAR AT THE TOP OF MY MONITOR, IT WAS WORKING! CONFIGURED AND IS WORKING FINE!

HOPE THIS HELPS (IT STILL DIDN'T ACTIVATE VIA ASHAMPOO, SO HOPEFULLY THIS ISN'T A TRIAL PERIOD!)

# THERE IS NO PATCH INCLUDED WITH THIS DOWNLOAD."
,Agent666,2012-06-01T19:19Z,"JUN 01: THIS APPEARS TO NOT WORK. I ENDED UP WITH AN INVALID COPY. I HAVE A PREVIOUS VERSION, THAT, CAME WITH A REGISTRY PATCH. I RAN THIS PATCH AND THIS NEW VERSION (v5.1.3) WORKS PERFECTLY!!

THE CONTENTS OF THIS REGISTRY PATCH ARE AS FOLLOWS:

[HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareAshampooAshampoo Snap 5ash_inet]
""firststart""=dword:00000000
""regKey""=""AMS5A1-77TE3E-TET9FE"" 
""state""=dword:00000001
""license-error""=dword:ffffffff
""license-counter""=dword:ffffffff

#NOTE: YOU CAN MANUALLY ENTER THIS DATA WITH A REGISTRY EDITOR OR YOU CAN COPY THIS INFORMATION AND PASTE IT INTO A NEW/BLANK NOTEPAD FILE. SAVE THIS FILE AND NAME IT Registration.reg

(copy from [HKEY_CURRENT THROUGH dword:ffffffff)

WHEN YOU DOUBLE CLICK THIS FILE, WINDOWS WILL INSTALL THE CHANGES FOR YOU!

THIS WORKS PERFECTLY FOR ME - HOPE THIS HELPS!"
