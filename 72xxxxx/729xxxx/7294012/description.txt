The Fastest Movie Capture

Dxtory is a movie capture tool only for DirextX/OpenGL application.
In order to acquire data from Surface Memory directly, It operates very much at high speed.
Arbitrary cropping and free scaling are supported by hardware.
Non-deteriorated Capture

The codec of Dxtory can record original pixel data as it is. A quality can be pursued to a limit with video source without degradation.
Moreover, since the third party VFW codec is also supported, the user can choose a favorite solution.
Distribution HDD Writing


The bottleneck of No. 1 of the speed of capture is a write-in speed to HDD.
If it is the environment of two or more HDD, this function will accelerate writting speed.
Preparation is completed only by specifying two or more holders which save data, and performing speed setting, without using a special file system.
Dual Audio Recording

If there are two or more audio input devices, two sound sources are recordable, like game sound and mic input.
It is possible to edit it individually later because it is preserved respectively as an independent stream in AVI file.
Only voice changes volume or there is small only game sound, by the conventional mux recording, it becomes possible for it to have been impossible.
If CoreAudio is effective environment (Windows Vista/Windows 7), since game sound can also be recorded from an output, only by 1 audio device, two lines are recordable. (* There is also a thing which cannot record sound depending on application.)
