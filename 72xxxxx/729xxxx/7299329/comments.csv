,geo2024,2012-06-04T04:01Z,As good as DVD-rip. Best one I tried. A9 V9
,jcvdfan83,2012-06-04T22:38Z,"V/9 A/8 very watchable, and probably the best quality that I have found by far, especially it being a movie that was just released not too long ago. If you can't wait for the dvd/blu ray release then this one is worth the download.

M/8 the movie was actually not that bad, if you like syfy epics!"
,klacker,2012-06-05T18:28Z,Great copy A/V 9 Thanks so much for the hard work!!!!!!!!
,tee_bee,2012-06-06T23:07Z,"Wow looks great, sounds great -- just ff'd through it and played at 3-4 places.  Based on what I've seen from these small peeks, this gets 10 on A & V!  "
,thenaughtons,2012-06-06T23:19Z,"Sounds great. will download and comment.
thanks maxmersk"

This is the best copy out now. well worth the download. the only thing missing is the opening title sequence, but the actual movie is 100% intact, so you miss nothing.

Thanks maximersk!"

,thenaughtons,2012-06-07T22:05Z,Oh wow! the family and i just watched it. what a fantastic movie! absolutely awesome!
,Icyman01,2012-06-09T17:02Z,"This is a great TS. 10/10

IMO this is an example of a 9-10 rating for a TS copy. watch and learn. The UL should post the methods/equipment used to get this great capture.

If it was any better it would have to be a DVD rip."
,MiscFoxes,2012-06-10T11:53Z,"In addition to the opening sequence, it's also missing the after-credit sequence. 

A/V is 9/9 (slightly grainy/dark). It's an excellent TS."
,dfl3506,2012-06-11T02:48Z,"A9, V9. What a horrible waste of money! Movie is absolute crap. Stupid, trite and Hollywood at it's worst. "
,mathewmcdonnell,2012-06-11T04:16Z,"excellent copy, but for some reason sound is about 3 seconds ahead of video.  Anyone tell me why or how to fix??"
,uheardmebitch,2012-06-11T10:04Z,"quality is passable. it's a little pixely for the size. audio is out of sync now and again, and keep ur fast forward button ready. the sub plot about the guy at the start is 20 minutes of your life totally wasted"
,uheardmebitch,2012-06-11T10:25Z,omg there's a hilarious bit in this movie [several maybe] when these huge machines the size of towns come flying out of the water and drop back in the ocean and it doesn't even make a wave. people in a rubber ducky 50 feet away are watching and completely unnaffected. funny stuff
,Aussiestyle1975,2012-06-12T09:28Z,Totaly AWSOME DVD QUALITY the best version 10/10
,cgalloza,2012-06-12T21:32Z,"Thank you sir. As always, a job well done"
,atikauy,2012-06-13T04:07Z,Thanks Man! :)
,snowbirds,2012-06-15T08:25Z,"Anyone who says this is just Hollywood American propaganda is full of shit.  This movie shows EXACTLY what it is like to serve in the US Armed Forces.  It's an awesome experience.  Even people who have their legs blown off are still heroes who get medals and lots of pussy for the rest of their lives!

Okay, now that I've defended America, I'll comment on the video quality.

Pretty amazing for a cam.  Probably the best cam I've ever seen.  I don't usually watch cams, but I was fine with this one the whole way through.  It's like a mediocre dvd rip.  A couple of times the audio is out out of sync.  A couple of times it stutters.  Not a big deal.  Only one scene was too dark for me to see what was going on for about 1 second.  Not important.

For a dvd rip I would give this an 8.5/8.5
For a cam I would give it a 10/10

Definitely watchable on a laptop.  Most of the time you will forget it's a cam..."
,klip1,2012-06-16T11:02Z,"I agree that it is the best out there, but clicky audio threw the film, anyone else same issue...?"
,gavranpero,2012-06-17T15:46Z,great
,Aly1369,2012-06-18T09:16Z,"agree since it IS the best on the bay atm i must give it an: a9v9 also an awesome Movie, will be buying the DvD when its released as well, thx a ton :)"
,mrnow76,2012-06-18T22:43Z,great rip!!! 8.5/8.5 on any scale
,marimans9,2012-06-20T21:36Z,As for cam... this is a very top 10 for a/v! :) keep up the good work

,TrabbiPower,2012-06-23T15:49Z,"Great cam. I don't know who was filming this, but he needs to get a legitimate job in Hollywood."
,Aussiestyle1975,2012-06-23T17:21Z,Use avs converter to a dvd the audio will synch perfectly !!
,linux2010,2012-06-24T00:11Z,thank man .good job 
,VanDecker,2012-06-24T20:47Z,"Very good video quality, could pass as an R5"
,mvfreeman,2012-06-25T03:57Z,"""happily aliens attack only USA....""

That's because we and our allies are the only ones on the planet that have a snowballs chance in hell of defeating them."
,catfly,2012-06-25T11:22Z,"Best cam i ever seen in my life. You won't need to watch the DVD after this. Specially once you seen how crap the story is... but its a bit of fun, worth a look if u bored. Sound is OK, and really the dialogue ain't Shakespeare."
,thewizardchrist,2012-06-26T06:48Z,"I wish all cams were this good. Audio out of sync for a bit in spots, but very good quality all in all.

That being said this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life."
,sixox,2012-06-27T18:05Z,"2.1mb/s download. (wohoo) Compared to my normal 790mb.
I forgot it was ts, really great quality. 
Movie 10/10, seen it before :) 

Thx"
,LittleAlienRobot,2012-07-02T22:37Z,"To bad the file has that stupid - blocking - when you play it on PS3.. ..you know after 20 minutes of play.
any solutions??..  im changing it to MP4 - that might not help.. but ill try still.."
,KNOOB3R,2012-07-03T09:38Z,very good ts almost like a dvd except for a few video glitches where its gets pixelated for a second then its good

Probably the best one i've seen. The audio does glitch for 1 second but it only happens about 4 times not to bad. Video is great too. The only thing I didnt lik about the movie was the massive use of lens flare used."

Good for a camera, audio is just fine - there is bass.
Watching on my 24inch no problem, slight pixelation, but not very noticable."

,milkster1984,2012-08-01T03:42Z,"The best copy yet that i've downloaded. However there are still some snyc issues that happen throughout the movie. Using VLC if you adjust back and forth by 0.10 seconds when the snyc is slightly out it does the job. Apart from that i'll give ratings of;

V: 7
A: 6
M: 7.

Very good copy for a TS"
