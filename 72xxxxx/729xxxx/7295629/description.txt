Now Rogawski's Calculus returns in a meticulously updated new edition, in a version designed specifically for AP courses.  Rogawski's Calculus for AP*, Second Edition features a new coauthor, Ray Cannon, formerly AP Calculus Chief Reader for the College Board.  Among other contributions, Dr. Cannon wrote this version's end-of-chapter multiple choice and Free Response Questions, giving students the opportunity to work the same style of problems they will see on the AP exam.
