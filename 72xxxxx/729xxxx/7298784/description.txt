Tarantula: Australia's King of Spiders 
A revealing look at the very large and hairy group of spiders known as tarantulas. In spite of their fearsome reputation, these curious creatures are often misunderstood. Tarantula reports on the 'Daddy' of the spider kingdom. Australia is home to some of the fiercest tarantulas in the world and it is here that expert Dr. Robert Raven guides us through his on-going mission to identify new species and protect them. He painstakingly searches Australia's vast outback and remote rainforests hoping to find, capture and identify new species. A species that has been roaming the planet for over 350 million years, the tarantula is the biggest, hairiest and scariest spider on the planet with venomous fangs to rival many snakes. This documentary gets up close and personal, shedding new light on the hairy tales of these extraordinary creatures. Beautifully filmed with every single intricate detail of the spider's existence captured from beginning to end, this fast-paced, fun and educational documentary leaves no stone unturned and is recommended to kill or cure any phobias you may have.
