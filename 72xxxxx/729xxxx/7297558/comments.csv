Happy game ."
[V],globeplus,2012-05-25T09:33Z,"Hi gamers and general resident evil series fans ...

I am working in games for the moment from fantastic well known series because start to be too many games from the same series 9,10,11 and probably with more new games coming up in some time and i want them organised with the best work possible .

This particular game file was worked by me a couple of years ago but unfornatly i was unhappy 
with the work because compressions and without all the necessary tools and information that i getted now to do this work and in consequence of that a better complete well structured file with the introducing for the first time in my game files of a starter executable that do the arc extraction then the necessary conversion work (this work always saves lot of size for downloading) and finally launching the game , just perfect everything the only thing it is really the close 20 minutes wait for both necessary tasks beeing processed but just that and the game get total portability and everything perfect with normality after that and only 3.25 gb to download what means great for 4.7 gb disks recording , flash drives transportation and of course less game size to download , the ripping work my friendly users are a real piece of art when well maked and absolutly no bullshit saying that ...

Expect from me more nice work in games of great games series in a near future , like i said with this series having many years now with games , they start to acumulate a little bit more and i want them organised and easy accesable with the best possible competent work and at this moment in time , this procedure makes sense and of course with that a big welcome for the future great games from this great games series ...

Happy gaming to all of you and making real good ripping work is a kind of an art ... see you . "
,Machine4578,2012-05-25T14:31Z,thank you GLOBE. I love your work.. have many of your rips too. all of them work perfect as does this one. keep up the awesome job ur doing and im looking forward to ur next release!
[V],globeplus,2012-05-25T18:26Z,"To machine 4578 : 

with a comment like that , certainly you deserve a good bonus tip , i hope soon have the GTA 1 Dos pack that i already uploaded for only 42 mb and for the first time in a file with the 2 missions packs (1969 and 1961) working perfectly without glitches like it happen on the windows versions of the same games having now addicionated the GTA 2 all available by a click with a very friendly interface  and with the best soundtrack available around the net fot that games playing at the interface background ... just a pure pearl of a file for the first GTA games in series history and Resident Evil 4 is beeing looked with attention after having with perfect works , the latest Operation Raccoon City for only 2.5 Gb and now this perfect rip work on the Resident Evil 5 for an amazing 3.25 Gb , in a game full of models files tough to work but a good compression with a great conversion work helped reducing positively the final file size independtly of how much work was necessary ... see you and now you are familiarized with my next possible work .

,bayshafe,2012-06-04T07:43Z,"I'm fairly new at this and wanted to ask what I had to do to get this to work. It get to the loading screen but then this thing pops up and says ""Resident Evil 5 GLOBERESIDENT EVIL 5nativePCArchiveCoreResource.arc"" 2. Do you have any idea what this is, anything I should have done?"
,Thanada,2012-06-04T17:57Z,"I just downloaded it and the game crashes whenever I command my partner to do anything telling me the sound file is missing, Ill try re downloading it and hope it works. "
,phelps320,2012-06-06T04:08Z,"Hi, 
first of all i would like to thank for all of your work !
You're always a handy.
Second, every time i get a voice error,my game crashes. The thing is in emo_voice folder, i already deleted it, but somehow it keeps crashing. Any tips ?
Thanks in advance !!"
,crion1,2012-06-06T18:20Z,"The sound crashes are caused by files in nativePCsoundbgmotoemo_voice. Change the file extensions from .ogg to .sngw and the crashes will stop.

I've encountered another problem though, certain melee attacks cause the entire computer to freeze, requiring a cold reboot. Specifically, one of Chris's ""rescue"" attacks triggers it. I haven't figured out how to fix this one."
,gunpla,2012-06-08T03:12Z,Is it possible to play online? im new at this..

,dieagain20113,2012-06-21T14:20Z,"this file size is great for collection, is it possible to apply ""unlock everything save file, infinity ammo"" to this version?"
,mokhammad,2012-06-24T12:30Z,"i got problem ""fatal error can't load coreresource.arc""......please give link for download this file......"
,reg321,2012-06-30T04:02Z,"Does not work; not worth downloading.

1) You need to go through windows live in order be able to save games. Doing this will make it ask for a product key.

2) You can skip windows live but the game crashes after 10 min every time. No way to go back to where you were. 

Bummer
