,thane37,2012-05-23T03:16Z,so is this a stand alone version?
,dksunny,2012-05-23T03:29Z,only 2.58 gb ... how ??
,Kleppemeister,2012-05-23T04:57Z,"@dksunny gog.com version is 1.95GB in size. And this truely is great work from Reloaded. 
Managing to release a game that got a DRM free version. Pirating this is pathetic. "
,mek01,2012-05-23T06:11Z,"@Kleppemeister: This is the GoG.com version, it was just packed by Reloaded.  The main game is 1.95GB but inside the .iso are also some extras in .rar archives (Dev diary videos, wallpapers, avatars and the Night Spring videos) that is why the 2.58 GiB size.

There is no crack in this release, since it's the GoG.com version just install and play."
,LaNPaRtY1987,2012-05-23T07:57Z,works! win7 ultimate 64x i7 2600K  ATI 6970 CrossfireX

,Usernamez,2012-05-23T08:58Z,"Hey, is it possible for you to upload Max Payne 3 even though it won't be out for another 7 days. Thx.

In all seriousness, though, thank you for this!"

,RIggsta,2012-05-24T04:37Z,"Works fine, doesnt work its on your end!!"
,mek01,2012-05-24T12:25Z,"I really enjoyed this game and Alan Wake's story as a whole, and since It's really cheap on GoG.com I'm just going to buy it to support Remedy. "
,amine640,2012-05-24T15:33Z,"thank you man.
Btw, can you get a torrent of COD WaW with multi please ?
I really would like to Dl it :-("
,DUDE1404,2012-05-24T16:29Z,"It doesn't work for me on windows XP. I just get an ""send/not send"" type of error right after the black screen when I started the game. F*CK."
,brsoares,2012-05-25T01:44Z,"Thanks for the up! 
But I have a problem, when I open the game, it runs frame by frame with audio stuttering, the initial ""remedy"" logo, the menu, the game... someone with same problem?
My spec: Win 7 64, 8GB, GTX 560 and PII X6 1090T"
,sputnikwood,2012-05-25T10:49Z,"I mildly enjoyed the original alan wake, most redeeming factor was the graphics. The story was so-so and good concept of incorporating light usage.

however for this stand alone game, it is mediocre. i didn't care two much about the story. The whole game practically takes place in three environments and in three acts. each act goes through the same 3 environments and same places. (no wonder the game is so small at 2.6gb).  the game is relatively short too (about 4-6hours), beat it in two night's of gameplay.  

There is also an Action mode where you just fight the enemies (the Taken) but ive already uninstalled the game after i beat it.

I did like using the nail gun though and the controls seem to be respond quicker compared to the first game."
,asafmiara,2012-05-25T21:30Z,thanks extremezone love alan wake and please uploud max payne 3 and ghost recon future solider
,preda96,2012-05-25T22:07Z,"Works Great! So much love for Alan Wake! Cant wait for alan wake 2, and I hope it will come on pc"
,brsoares,2012-05-25T23:26Z,"Found the solution, game runs only with audio 16 bits, so I had to down from 24 to 16 bits and the game runs perfect..."
,prafull,2012-05-26T09:47Z,extremezone plz upload gta 4
,yakirvo,2012-05-26T17:35Z,"AHHHHHHHH PPL HELP ME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IM CRAZY I WANNA PLAY THE GAME AND WHEN I OPEN ALAN WAKE's
ITS doin THE LOGO OF
REMEDY
AND AFTER THAT QUIT THE GAME AND GIVE ME A ERROR ITS SAY

..
Could not read from file ""File residing in memory"".


HELP ME !!!!!!!"
,Justdead,2012-05-26T20:28Z,it is possible to play the game over steam? and a non steam game? i download from u all the time ;) 
,Ninjen,2012-05-28T19:57Z,"I have the same problem as yakirvo, where the game crashes after the remedy logo and the error pops up

Could not read from file ""File residing in memory"".

The game originally worked for me the first time, and then I can't get past this on the next day.

I've tried a restart and still no dice, so I'll try a reinstall next, since I haven't gotten far ingame."
,Ninjen,2012-05-29T00:25Z," @yakirvo

The game needs administrator access (at least for me). right click > Run as... > Administrator

I figured this might be the problem after an ""Access Denied"" error during installation. In any case, you don't have to reinstall the game, just run as an admin on your PC. "

,markunt,2012-06-07T12:38Z,"AVG claims there's a virus in one of the wallpaper images, be warned."
,buttfacejr,2012-06-09T01:07Z,"@markunt

AVG is crap and if anything would be a virus it would be the exe's or the crack, and also extremezone doesn't upload viruses, hence the VIP symbol."
,RaW-D-Coy,2012-06-10T15:41Z,"is this GFW protection or steam protection ? could some1 tell me
