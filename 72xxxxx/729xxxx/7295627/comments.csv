,crazedmasta,2012-07-17T08:44Z,"Hey y'all, having the same problem as kysounagi here. I first got the game and it would go through the intro movie and I could not skip it and when it ended, couldn't use my keyboard at all. Seemed like I needed to install the patch and then when I do when I run .exe get the same error message WETF!"
,CTR-3000,2012-07-18T17:13Z,Since it worked for me i don't know how to help. Try updating GFWL.
,SirOsborne,2012-07-21T20:29Z,"For the ""Ordinal 5377"" error, the xlive.dll actually comes in the 'Games for Live' package installer. I was getting the same error problem, but after I installed the WindowsGamesForLive package, it worked fine. Try this link:

Obviously, you need to remove the parentheses."
,SirOsborne,2012-07-21T20:34Z,"If you are getting the ""Ordinal 5377"" error, Google: ""games for live package installer."" I was getting the same error issue, but after I installed the GFWL, the game worded perfectly. "
