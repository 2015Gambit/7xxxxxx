It bugged me for a long time that there wasn't a single AVI upload of Neon Genesis that was dubbed. So I converted a bunch of MKVs and made this. It's for all of you out there (like me) that watches your downloads on your Xbox/DVD player (which generally require AVIs) and enjoy your animes dubbed.

This is my first upload so bear with me if there are any problems... constructive feedback is always appreciated.
