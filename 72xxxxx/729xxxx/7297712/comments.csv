,rjcripe,2012-05-25T21:45Z,"Sure is.

Just a heads up every night I need to shut my computer off so there are about 8 hours a day I won't be seeding. Soon as there are a few finished downloads that shouldn't be a problem."
,rjcripe,2012-05-26T19:18Z,"Hey everybody, I didn't realize till last night that I had made the resolution 1280 and I know that, for at least mine, DVD players require 640... I went through and converted all of the episodes again to a size that will play for me and I can upload that if anybody prefers or, if you all don't care, I can just keep seeding this guy."
,Iknwthetruth,2012-06-07T21:52Z,"yo bro thanks for the upload its good hey think u can upload some more anime 
thank"
,fmlol,2012-06-22T07:58Z,"@rjcripe: DLing now, will let you know if there are any resolution issues. Planning to seed if you keep the torrent up."
,johnjohnperry42,2012-08-18T02:58Z,Couple episodes missing/mislabled such as episode 15 which for some reason is a copy of episode 12 or 13 and episode 11 which is a copy of episode 10. Shit sucks
