17. Only The Horses [video]
18. Only The Horses [Behind The Scenes]

Thanks for the upload!"
,stealnwhine,2012-05-25T04:45Z,The standard/normal release only has 12 tracks.
[T],FatFreddy473,2012-05-25T10:53Z,"the standard cd version has 13 tracks, but all digital has 16 tracks or more i believe"
,stealnwhine,2012-05-25T19:23Z,"Wait, you just stated that this is the normal version. Now you say there should only be 13 tracks?

If you look at the band's website, you'll get that there are multiple versions released in both the US and UK, and none of them align the same from one shop to another.

From Amazon in the US the standard release has 12 tracks, the deluxe 16 plus the two videos. It's not stated in this torrent what the actual version is by location, but if this is standard then it matches the Amazon UK listing, whereas the deluxe version comes with a CD and DVD.

No offense intended, but I couldn't care less what the digital releases contain as this is about a retail CD rip, and iTunes and Apple can go fuck themselves with their proprietary behavior."
