Hey people, why is no one seeding? Don't just download and disconnect, keep the connection open for others!!!!!"
,nikita566,2012-05-23T10:14Z,"Sorry to be nasty, but what is wrong with you scumbags? Hundreds of seeds and peers, and only a total of 8 online after they download? What's up with that? You like the show? Other people also want it. STAY ONLINE. DON'T TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTERS WHEN YOU FINISH DOWNLOADING."
,Smeddie,2012-05-24T06:55Z,The audio is awful .. 
,10cefiro,2012-05-24T14:33Z,"Seconded, there's tweaking audio I thought I was only the one hearing."
,d.d.dudes.dad,2012-05-25T05:58Z,What is that background tweak?  Some kind of cell ringtone? Fucking annoying...
