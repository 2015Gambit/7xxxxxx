Everyone from Roth to editor George Folsey Jr. through to Tarantino and Harry Knowles chip in on the film's evolution from a conversation between Knowles and Roth about weird and warped websites right through to the film's release and the apparent debates it went on to spark about audiences' new-fangled blood lust for torture cinema.

Ripped from 2-disc Dungeon Deluxe release.
