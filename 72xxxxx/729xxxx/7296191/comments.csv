,manishmeena44,2012-05-25T05:24Z,"Hi mini_grt, I got a problem. I have already installed FIFA12. But whenever I try to install this UEFA EURO it says install FIFA12 first. I redirected the directory but no results! can you help me?"
,lisapower,2012-05-25T06:08Z,Is there also Spanish as Audio Language?
,Mini_grt,2012-05-25T07:53Z,"@ manishmeena44 

The procedure is First the installer search in the registry for Fifa 12 and its install dir.

If u are using Fifa 12 ripped version or something else which didnt created registry entry , then this installer cant locate your fifa12 and that results ""I try to install this UEFA EURO it says install FIFA12 first.""

Check your registry and see if there is fifa 12 entry or not..

and @lisapower
Its only english.."
,CoWBoYWWE,2012-05-25T12:19Z,hw to check the registry ?and if it is nt in registry den hw to register it ?
,Mini_grt,2012-05-25T14:06Z,"When you install the game the installer register that game in registry automatically..

you dont have to register it manually..

and to check the registry go to start-> run->regedit-> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> Ea Sports

there you can find the registry entry"
,Yozer34,2012-05-26T21:40Z,"Mini, I have downloaded the registry fix and followed the tutorial on how to install this fix. I checked my registry and everything was perfect, except that I could not find the folder ""EA Sports"" under SOFTWARE -> Wow6432Node. 
I even reinstalled FIFA 12 into C:Program FilesEA SportsFIFA 12 , as the tutorial directed.

Any ideas on how to fix this issue?"
,Mini_grt,2012-05-26T23:42Z,"@ Yozer34
