This is a SELF EXTRACTING file that contains all of the files needed to run this  language in Rosetta Stone.

You MUST use it with the "Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe" file I have UL'd
If you don't, the activation process may not work right (or at all!)

DL this file, extract it, allow it to extract to the default location (C:/)

It will create the "C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/content" folder.
It will then copy the language files to the "content" folder

THAT'S IT!

(for more information, read the comment I wrote in the "Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe" torrent index.)
