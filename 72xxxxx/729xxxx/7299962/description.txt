Todd Agnew is a Contemporary Christian musician and songwriter. Agnew's best-known song is a version of the hymn "Amazing Grace" called "Grace Like Rain" that was featured on his first album, Grace Like Rain, released in June 2003. Agnew wrote this song with his friend, Chris Collins. Since then, Agnew has released four label albums. 2005's Reflection of Something introduced the popular songs "My Jesus" and "Unchanging One", which are often featured on Contemporary Christian radio stations. In late 2006, after the two highly acclaimed studio projects, he wrote a retelling of the Christmas story on his album entitled Do You See What I See?. His fourth studio project, Better Questions, was released in 2007 and featured the hit single ΓÇ£Our Great GodΓÇ¥ (a duet featuring CCM artist Rebecca St. James).

Agnew's current label is Ardent Records. He was among the twelve artists selected to be a part of the Big Shiny Planet Bible study released through LifeWay and Family Christian Stores.[3] Paralleling his song "Still Has a Hold" with Romans 7, Agnew elaborates on the subject of the faithfulness of God.

Agnew is known for performing his concerts barefoot.
