[H],NZPirate,2012-05-24T12:56Z,"Where's the seed? Whole bunch of us all at the same percent downloaded. It's a bit stupid IMO to make everyone else wait, its almost like ""kiddy's games"". Your initial seeding, I disagree with, and I'll be staying away from your torrents in the future.
Thanks anyways"
,ore-sabre,2012-05-24T16:07Z,nothing wrong with my seeds mister
[H],NZPirate,2012-05-24T21:14Z,"You missed the point in what I was saying. I didn't imply that your torrents weren't well seeded.

My gripe was your initial seeding. The initial seed disappeared when a couple of us got to 67% so anyone that downloaded the torrent there after could only get to 67% until the initial seed decided that we could have the rest of the file (33%). So something I could have had in 5-10 minutes took better part of 12 hours, which I could have gotten elsewhere.  Anyways thanks for the album..."
