Movie: Sankirtana Movement or Hare Krishna Movement, Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu lived approximately 18 years in Nilachal, Jagannath Puri, between the years 1510 and 1534 during the reign of Gajapati Prataparudra Maharaj, the King of Orissa. This film, made in Bengal, India, in 1959, though historically not fully accurate, is an effective dramatic and devotional presentation of the LordΓÇÖs activities.
