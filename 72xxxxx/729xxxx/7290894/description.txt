The V-50 Lectures are a powerful epistemological and observational scientific identification of the causes and effects of civilization's social problems and the decentralized, non-political conditions within which our society must function for genuine freedom to flourish, without anarchy, and enable unprecedented productivity, security, and wealth.  The V-50 Lectures further innovatively sharpen the definition of ownership, or 'property', and build upon the intellectual works of Isaac Newton, Ludwig Bolztmann, Thomas Paine, Frederic Bastiat, Ludwig Von Mises, Robert LeFevre, and many others.  The V-50 Lectures were first innovated by Dr. Andrew J. Galambos and greatly expanded upon by Dr. Jay S. Snelson, the principal V-50 lecturer including the popular MP3 audio set digitally remastered from high-quality tape recordings produced and distributed by Chas Holloway.
