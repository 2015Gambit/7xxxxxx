,Vicar in a Tutu,2012-05-27T21:45Z,"I downloaded the other torrent 'Avatar (2009) extended 1080p extras multi [mkvonly]' just a few days ago. Grr!

I wanted to compare the releases before thinking about redownloading so I matched up the screenshots. Then I uploaded them here for others to see.

I converted the screenshots from PNG to JPEG at full (12 on Photoshop CS6) quality. Pixels are identical to PNG but files are less than half size. Note that the overall bitrate is the same in both releases (6000kbps video)."
