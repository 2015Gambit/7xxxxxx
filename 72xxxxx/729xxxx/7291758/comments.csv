[T],jmanwf,2012-05-23T12:18Z,yeah for some reason itunes hasn't released them bizarre considering now i am getting this weeks episodes i have contacted them again don't know whats going on.
,Heather4201976,2012-05-23T12:25Z,Ok Ty. Well maybe you will get them then. If not oh well it is not hard to figure out what happened on them. Lol. Ty again!!!
,disnfab,2012-05-23T14:24Z,Thanks jmanwf! I've found the two missing episodes on youtube and downloaded them using keepvid but I'm sure the quality of your files is much better. I will download them from you if you can get them from itunes because I'm two months behind in all four soaps... I have too much TV shows to watch!
,Dimmis80,2012-05-23T15:28Z,Yeah if our friend @jmanwf can't find them @disnfab it would be nice to upload them here mate so we will watch both two episodes to and then go for Mondays.I hope u will do it.Thanks in advance.!

[T],jmanwf,2012-05-24T09:09Z,"I have decided to still upload but i will be uploading In MP4 File format at less MB at 180mb from now uality might not be that great but at least you can watch it it is free after all.

FROM NOW ON YOU WILL NEED VLC MEDIA PLAYER TO DECODE MP4 WINDOWS MEIDA PLAYER WONT DO IT"
,SoWErA3,2012-05-24T12:35Z,Thanks but saddens me to hear you will continue with the rest in lesser quality instead of higher then again Itunes ain't offering it in HD like some channel does now days :(
,kitty56,2012-05-25T18:52Z,i hear ya about having too many tv shows to watch im way behind on days and now i have to stream general hospital cos nobody uploads them.  i watch my soaps at work and the other guard just rolls his eyes when i watch them.  thanks again for the uploads guys makes my 3rd shift go faster.
