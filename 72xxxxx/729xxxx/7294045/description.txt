"The Wedding"

Frankie and Mike are surprised to receive 
an invitation to Mike's brother Rusty's 
(Norm Macdonald) fast approaching wedding. 
But their surprise turns to panic when 
they discover that he has listed the Heck 
house as the site of the ceremony. 
Meanwhile, Axl and his friends decide to 
become their own bosses and set out to 
form their own company to garner summer 
jobs, and Brick is upset with Mike when 
he finally accepts an invitation to a 
fellow student's party but is not allowed 
to go because it falls on the same day as 
the wedding.
