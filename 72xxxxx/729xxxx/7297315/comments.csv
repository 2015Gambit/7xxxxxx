Men at Work follows the misadventures of four buddies who work together at a magazine. Masterson plays the recently dumped Milo, whose friends are determined to help him get back in the game. Lesure is Gibbs, a photographer and successful ladies man. Cassidy plays Tyler, a features writer who brings a dose of style and sophistication to the group. And Busch is Neal, a somewhat nebbish reporter and the only one in the group with a steady girlfriend. Together, the four serve as each other's wingmen as they help each other navigate work, friendship and women. (Source: TBS)
