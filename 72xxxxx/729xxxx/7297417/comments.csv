,woodbooger,2012-05-25T14:55Z,I'm assuming a season 4 mate. I guess it all depends on the ratings. Who knows. 
,maddogeleven,2012-05-26T23:36Z,It's the character personalities that keep people watching.  Most of the hunters on the show are easily likeable and have their individual charm and quirks.  =)
