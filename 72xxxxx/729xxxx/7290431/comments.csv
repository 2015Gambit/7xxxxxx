Look inside all of your archives as if they were ordinary folders in Windows Explorer. It doesn't get any easier than this. Use your favorite habits to manage archives: Copy and paste, or drag and drop to seamlessly extract/compress all plug-in supported formats. Double-clicking any file inside an archive opens it. You may even update the archive with the new file when you save your changes!
Use MagicRAR Drive Press to safely compress your entire disk using proven NTFS compression. Unlike built-in NTFS compression, MagicRAR Drive Press compresses your entire disk even when your edition of Windows wouldn't allow it. Best of all, all your files and settings are preserved and can be accessed normally, as if your drive wasn't compressed. Of course, Drive Press safely decompresses your drive if you want to go back for any reason."
