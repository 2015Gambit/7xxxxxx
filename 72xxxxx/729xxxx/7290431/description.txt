Why is MagicRAR special? Its the magic...
MagicRAR is based on "non-rooted shell namespace extension" technology. Leaving technical jargon aside, this is what makes MagicRAR so easy to use, that you think it must be magic. You will not find any other data compression utility featuring this technology, because it is based on largely undocumented Microsoft interfaces that are extremely difficult to implement. Our team has spent tens of thousands of hours researching and implementing this technology, making us the first to offer you the convenience of obviousness when working with archives. But please, take a look at what else is available only with MagicRAR...
