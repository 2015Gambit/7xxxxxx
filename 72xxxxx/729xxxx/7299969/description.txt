7eventh Time Down is an American Christian punk metal band. They are best known for their single "Alive In You." The band is from Mount Vernon, Kentucky. Secrest said "it only takes about two seconds to like the band members from 7eventh Time Down. These Kentucky boys will welcome you at once with their good-natured banter and laid-back persona. But don't let them fool you. On stage, they mean business."[1] They are "Straight up rock 'n rollers, they blend classic rock tactics to make their sound aggressive with enough melodic hooks to lodge their choruses into the mind long after the show is over. They pull from the best of timeless bands such as Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Doors, AC/DC and even Johnny Cash, infusing a raucous yet carefully-crafted musical landscape with lyrics that shoot straight-from-the-hip."
