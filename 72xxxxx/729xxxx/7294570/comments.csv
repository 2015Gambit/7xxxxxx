,uzzi38,2012-06-08T18:06Z,"hoe long does it usually take before the unzipping application start working? I've disabled AVG etc, but it hasnt asked for permission etc after 10 minutes"
,uzzi38,2012-06-08T18:08Z,"never mind, it will take a long time to start. Before it does, you wont be able to do anything, and the application will freeze depending on how good your computer is."

,ACE3CGL,2012-06-17T03:22Z,"Ok,so I downloaded this and ran the application I saw when I first opened the folder.I copied the new SR2_pc.exe from the 'cracked' folder and replaced it with the old one,and then I started the game,but when I tried,it said I was missing a .dll file.This happend  3 times,and everytime,I found it of of some website and installed it.Now,I try running SR2_pc.exe and a window pops up for a few seconds,and then the entire thing crashes.Any advice?Am I doing something wrong?"
