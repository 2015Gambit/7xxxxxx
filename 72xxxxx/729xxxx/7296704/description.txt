"Country Wine" and the hard-rock song"Powder Blue Mercedes Queen" 
I got from a Paul Revere & the Raiders compilation album, 
so those tracks are at 320K.

I also included "Song Seller" , which is a post-album single that's also at 320K.

The 192K unremastered tracks sound like they're from a vinyl copy of Country Wine, the only Raiders album that may not be available on CD.  It was the band's last LP before Mark Lindsay quit the band a few years later.
