How to use Trial Version software forever

How it Works
 
┬ªOpen Time Stopper
 ┬ªBrowse and select .exe of required trial software
 ┬ªChoose the new date (Any date which occurs in between your trial software time period before expiration, suggestion: set it to two days before trial software expiration date.)
 ┬ªChoose any time
 ┬ªClick open software on your selected date
 
If you wish to create an icon for your modified trial software and do not want to open Time stopper every time then use last button in software to create new icon. open that trial software after that from that newly created icon always otherwise it can expire.
