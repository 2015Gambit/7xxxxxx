,ClipperCigars,2012-06-09T07:39Z,"Thanks.

BTW: Don't you mean re-uploaded because of a mistake while making the pdf's that caused the wrong issue to start appearing after the first 2 pages? ;) "
,tavery80a,2012-06-10T16:04Z,More like Re-re-uploaded.  I originally uploaded this corrected file back in July 2011 under a different name.
,tikobob,2012-07-25T19:13Z,"Huge thanks tavery80a for all the efforts on the entire Playboy uploads. One of the best efforts in the P2P community EVER! 

I have noticed two of your torrents uploaded here under tavery80 have no seeders:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6568348/Playboy_magazine_August_1999 is stuck at 98.1% with 7 leechers, and

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6536153/Playboy_magazine_-_repaired_PDFs is stuck at 96.5% with 11 leechers.

Given all your work on this, I really feel bad asking if you, or someone else, could re-seed these two torrents for just about 5 minutes so we can complete the entire set. I am totally grateful for all the others but it would be nice to have these few issues fully seeded.

Also you truly went beyond the effort to upload the Centerfolds in the Large Size format, which is awesome by itself. The 1950s and 1960s were uploaded under tavery80. Just wondering if the 1970s and beyond have been uploaded under a different user name or on another website? These large-format centerfolds are exceptional and it would be wonderful to have the rest.

In one of your comments you mentioned that all your pdf files were from the C2C hard disk. If you have stopped doing the conversions for the centerfolds, would there be any way you could upload the C2C as an ISO torrent and then others could help finish the large format centerfolds?

Frankly it would be nice to have the C2C ISO image anyway for the search capabilities. The PDFs are great for reading, though, and in the long-term will be more compatible than the Bondi limp-ware. I have the 1950s Bondi DVD and find the interface nice to just find the right issue, and then use your PDFs because the quality and navigation is easier with the PDFs. Also the print quality is infinitely better with your PDFs.

Again, many, many thanks for all the PDFs. They are awesome and your P2P spirit is beyond awesome!"
