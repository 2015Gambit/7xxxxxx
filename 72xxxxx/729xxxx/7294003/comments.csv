,Mikey320,2012-05-24T03:18Z,"@pjones452
 Lol who buy's movies these days!? Pirates for life!!"
,5981430042537,2012-05-24T03:18Z,"i thank thee, dear ovh."
,chrisc4m,2012-05-24T03:55Z,omg finally.
,TyMod,2012-05-24T03:56Z,"Saw it in theaters and have been waiting for it to be released. I was just looking for this to be released for this too which is kinda ironic.

Thank you so much man!"
,YoungStunna,2012-05-24T04:12Z,looks like a cam to me.. I wish someone would post  a real blu ray rip already.
,S-gray,2012-05-24T04:31Z,"judging the images, the quality seems weak.
tell me your opinion ""any body saw it"""
,TyMod,2012-05-24T05:23Z,"Yes I actually ""saw it""

The film grain is natural and not a biproduct of a bad rip. I compared it to extreme's DVDRip upload of it and the difference is noticable in quality.

Ofcourse the audio sounds great. :)

V=8.5
A=10"
,Elkubiak,2012-05-24T05:31Z,Quality doesn't look like a 720 BlueRay rip. IMO.
,YoungStunna,2012-05-24T05:37Z,"ok definitely not a cam, probably a dvd rip. its probably the best quality so far"
,oorenotsoo,2012-05-24T06:45Z,Thanks.
,YoungStunna,2012-05-24T06:59Z,SAMPLE VID: sendspace_com/file/3at8ka replace _ with a .
,chrisc4m,2012-05-24T10:04Z,The quality is pretty good actually. v 9 a 10
,pirateabag,2012-05-24T11:14Z,the guy that makes screens should be spanked
,downloader29,2012-05-24T12:53Z,"them images dont look to healthy to me,haha"

HELL YEAAAHH :D     ahrrr"
,BleepinBleep2000,2012-05-25T18:37Z,"Thanks man, not top notch but definitely good quality both audio and video"
,Elkubiak,2012-05-26T04:05Z,"@eoroto22: fuck you, spammer!"
,Pioneer41,2012-05-26T13:13Z,"V=9.5
A=10
M=8

Close to perfect imo. A little grainy, but i seem to remember it being that way in the cimema."
,leucocitos,2012-05-26T14:44Z,does it have subs?
,jperez2003us,2012-05-26T15:30Z,Why 720p and not 1080p? You think you will lost quality using a higher resolution?
,tor12,2012-05-26T21:14Z,"WARNING!!! Black screen on media players. Does not convert in MKV2VOB. 

FAIL!!!!!"
,xrhstos-10gr,2012-05-30T16:37Z,"The movie is too good for me, the film is at 10 this year I have seen too many movies and impressed no not this really is a movie that has it all to see ...!!!!"
,InsanityCrescendo,2012-06-04T12:22Z,5.46 Gigs?! Isn't that a bit too much? Even for two hours.
,kamakla2,2012-06-06T00:41Z,"@pjones

I tend to buy movies of russian itunes(cheaper than american) if i have enjoyed the torrent.

i would recommend everyone to do the same"
,mosi2012,2012-06-06T01:13Z,it is workin........ just its slow in downloaing.. like 400kb/s

,drunk-mon,2012-06-09T01:18Z,Just got done wathin this one.as usual good quality rip from BOZX!good movie; not great but good.thanx man.
,hxxq,2012-06-09T07:21Z,"First thanks for all ur great effort on Rips.. i humbly request in you plz upload THE ABYSS 1989 Blu ray.. one of the missed movies on pirate, some idiots upload the crappy 4:3 letterbox version of same, since blu ray of abyss is available, a ANAMORPHIC version will do JUSTICE... great thanks in advance"
,herniator,2012-06-14T05:27Z,"Dunno about the quality of this rip, but I saw the movie in a theater, and it was a let down. Action was average at best, acting was poor, and shaky cam annoying as always.  Bourne movies were much better, even with Matt ""Maaatt Daaamon"" Damon."

,flash_os,2012-06-23T09:27Z,Thank you king BOZX!
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-09T10:56Z,It's a good movie. Better than other junk out there.
,ArctiGurl,2012-08-23T16:21Z,"I had to go through 4 other torrents that all were not nearly good enough to enjoy this movie on before I got to yours BOZX... but I am so very glad I did not give up because this is not only an awesome movie, but the work you put into getting this torrent into this condition has made it almost indistinguishable from something I might have bought retail.
Your colour is close to perfect, sound is dead on from first sec to last and picture clarity and quality is basically retail bluray.
A-10
V-9.999 (I will never say that a copy is a 10 simply because it is a copy and something must always be lost)
M-10 one of the best I have seen this year

I want to thank for this one and also make note that even when you release a torrent that is not up to this standard I always know there will be another, much improved copy coming from you in the near future...

So thank you very much for the hard work and keep it up because you are doing this right.


(Oh... and to all the pb users that keep putting up comments that simply bash the person and forget that the comment is supposed  to be a guide for those looking for the best dl... jam something large and immovable into your keyboards ok? You help NOBODY with the crap you continue to spout and it is really really annoying... I would swear at all of you but you just are not worth that level of care and anger...)

Nuni"
