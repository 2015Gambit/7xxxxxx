I didn't download this but i grabbed it from the official site and i tried the generic FFF patch released for 3.57 and it works (same thing in torrent ??)
Also the Peter Zuma key floating around does NOT work anymore.

Want to patch this yourself ?
Nop the jump @ 00273522
Change EB 02 -> 90 90"
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-05-27T05:53Z,"I was able to use the generic patch too [Zuma key no longer good].

@xpmule
What does
""Nop the jump @ 00273522
Change EB 02 -> 90 90""
mean?"
,xpmule,2012-05-27T21:00Z,"It mean if you hex edit the TagRename.exe at the address I stated it will be registered like the patch.

nop mean nothing / null /zero
and in asm is 0x90 in hex

and a standard jump (asm instruction jmp)
is 0xEB in hex

So if you went to the address I stated in a hex editor say UltraEdit for example you change the 2 bytes mentioned and save the file and run it and it should be registered now.."
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-05-28T06:11Z,"@xpmule

If I understand you, the patch will do this for you?"
,SwimclubOphelia,2012-06-03T18:33Z,"Hmm.

I'd like to try your hex edit method, but I guess I need a more detailed explanation... this patcher doesn't look too good..."
,SwimclubOphelia,2012-06-03T19:06Z,"I got it! :)
Downloaded FlexHEX, but had to go to adress 0027355A."
,SwimclubOphelia,2012-06-03T19:07Z,One more question: How do you find these things out? I mean: How do you know that these bytes are responsible for this function?
,magogogo1,2012-06-06T00:47Z,"Thanks xpmule & TheEmpathicEar! 

BUT I have tried to Search/GoTo the  string using UltraEdit and TinyHexer and cannot locate it at the address you specify? Can you help?

What exact string do I specify in UltraEdit: Search/GoTo? "
,magogogo1,2012-06-06T01:04Z,"OK I got it using SwimclubOphelia method. 

Found the string right away..thanks SwimclubOphelia!!"
,xpmule,2012-06-09T12:33Z,"i used ""Beyond Compare"" in Hex compare mode to show what is different.
After i ran the patcher in a sandbox ;)

If you mean how do you find the spot originaly ?
I'd have to say look for some basic cracking tutorials.. OllyDBG is a good place to start and to jump to an address in OLLYDBG hit ctrl+g and past in the address

There is MILLIONS of hex editors out there but i almost always use UltraEdit
after years its become a habit more than anything, I also think WinHex is pretty damn good hex editor..
UltraEdit is convinient for any format just right click any file and select open with.. and whats nice is the customizable syntax highlighting.
Most text based stuff though i ""Notepad2"" 64bit version
Its very light weight and yet still has lots of features and its free and open source and supports syntax highlingting, VERY good program i think :)"
,torrentic,2012-07-05T16:02Z,"Thanks to SwimclubOphelia  and TheEmpathicEar !!

To sum it up:
open TagRename.exe,
goto (ctrl+G) addressQ  0x0027355A
and change EB 02 -> 90 90

It works like a charm!!!!"
