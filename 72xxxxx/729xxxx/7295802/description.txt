ItΓÇÖs late in the day, just hours before Victoria and Joey are supposed to go out to the theater then enjoy a romantic dinner for two at JoeyΓÇÖs place. ThatΓÇÖs when Victoria got a call from her ex lover, Goeff. It was a harmless call about something stupid, but when Joey saw her hiding the call from him, Victoria and Joey began to argue. Even though they both got dressed for the evening to go out, the argument got so consuming that they never made it out of the house. Now estranged, they sit quietly at the dinner table picking at their food, each one just wanting to hold the other, each one not knowing how to fix what went wrong. Watch as this true life couple learns that true love is more powerful than any foolish jealousy.
