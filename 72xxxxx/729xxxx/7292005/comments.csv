Keep these full episodes coming if you can."
[V],TheExecutive,2012-05-24T05:44Z,"This is NOT a full episode at 38 minutes !! A complete Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carsojn from the 1960s and 1970s is 90 minutes with commercials ( 77 minutes without commercials )
and also the videotape was transferred to film , so the video and audio quality here are poor.

Johnny later cut back his schedule for The Tonight Show and it was a 1 hour show in the 1980s and into the early 90s when he retired.

I downloaded this partial show elsewhere -- don't bother."
