I haven't FS9 installed now, so I can't check it, but it's look like it should work.

1. Go to C:Documents and SettingsUsernameLocal SettingsTemp and scroll all the way down
2. Start the Anchorage installer
3. Select a language
4. Go back to the Temp folder. Two new folders will have been created. Open the bottom one.
5. Inside this folder there is another folder; copy the .dll from the crack folder to that first folder and overwrite.
6. Now proceed with installation; fill in anything or nothing when you get to the registration screen.

It's readme text, but there is no point on what to do whith .rar BGL files. I think need to copy ot and overwrite whith the original as usual.
