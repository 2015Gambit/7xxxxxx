[for people above]

- you need to have a jailbroken iPhone, currently Absinthe jailbreak does the trick (its super, super easy)

- once you have cydia you will need to get ""Appsync for IOS 5.x+"" & Installous 4.

- once installed you will be able to put IPA files on your iPhone which are cracked apps.

- you can do the easy way of looking for the apps in installous (but the download speed is a lot slower) or access your iPhone through the root method. follow these instructions to do so:
