great game but underestimated
Haemimont company work,focus it`s work to SPAIN
the creator of the game and the main developer is Spanish 
http://www.haemimontgames.com
and for that a little people know there work
we play in the past some of there game like....
tzar...Celtic king....Rising Kingdoms

i found EXE highly compressed take 2 hour to install...convert wav to hpk etc....
so i repack it with larger size to make it faster to instal
original scene release size 255mb=expand to 2000mb=finished size 905mb
my repack 544mb 7.zip=unrar size EXE 905mb=installed size 905mb
no difference and no missing thing from the original work
is there anything missing compared to company release?
honestly i don`t know
i only found it in my old DVD collection not in the web
i used "Smart Install Maker" to create the setup
no credit to anyone all credits goes for me :)
