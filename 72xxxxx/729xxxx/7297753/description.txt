DESCRIPTION:

 Suck at Girls is full of his dad's patented brand of wisdom. But it's also full of new characters just as funny as his dadΓÇöfrom his brother, 
who provides insights into wedding night rituals ("You stand in one corner of the room, and she stands in the other. 
You each take off one piece of clothing at a time") to his first boss, who warns Justin to man up: "That's what a man does. 
He takes his shots and then he scrubs the shit out of some dishes." The result is a pilgrim's progress through the landscape of sex and loveΓÇöby one of the funniest writers at work today.
