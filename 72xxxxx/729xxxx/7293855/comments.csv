,lovespiratebay,2012-05-25T02:00Z,This movie is holarious. Most of YIYFY's movies are great for the beautiful pictures and small size. However the sound isn't always up to par and half of them wont work on my PS3. I'm gonna download this one and try it out. If it's bad I'm going back to extremezone. Will seed 2:1 thx YIFY.
,lovespiratebay,2012-05-25T02:03Z,Also I'll try to comeback and give a rating within a couple of days.

NO audio problems
NO video problems
HAS english subtitles
IS a brilliant quality"
