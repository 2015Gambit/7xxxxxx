*********************How Can I Check My Dongle is Clone or Real ***************







Install True Blue dongle firmware v2.7 or later. Then in the PS3 XMB, navigate to
 
Settings -> System Settings -> System Information. Next to the "System Software" 

version will be information relating to your True Blue dongle. If your dongle is 

authentic then it will display something like "True Blue v2.7" (this will vary 

depending on the version of the dongle firmware you have installed). If your dongle 

is a clone then it will display "True Blue CLONE" as shown in the following image:
