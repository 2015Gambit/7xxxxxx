First off this is an installer made by the uploader.
2nd what is Business edition ?
Do you mean this ?
http://www.piriform.com/business/ccleaner-network-edition

3rd i ran this in a sandbox and it makes one hell of a bloody mess !
I lost count how many different shortcuts were created in various places. Highlights include a shortcut to some installer program I'm guessing you used. As well as a Startup entry to load a web page on every boot..
(Link is added to start up folder in start menu)

I don't know what web site is loaded and frankly i don't care.
And since i refuse to run the actual program after seeing all that I can not report anything about the program itself..

My first clue things were weird is the installer icon and then the strange properties on the installer.. i knew right there it wasn't made by Piriform lol"
,xpmule,2012-05-25T10:16Z,I forgot to add this is only the 32bit version
,xpmule,2012-05-26T07:06Z,"Im an idiot Business edition is shown on the download page which IS different than the Network edition.

I forgot to mention that the programs .exe installed does have a digital signature And i think its clean and safe to use.

On one hand I don't want to be a jerk but on the other hand I don't apreciate people trying to slip things into my windows startup or the added and un-needed shortcuts everywhere

I think you meant well so..
Advanced computer users will want just the .exe
And i guess noobs will insist on an installer otherwise their lost lol

I still and always will just use the free version but people should post the differences in the versions when adding these torrents.. I'll do it for you ;)

Basicly people the only real reason to use this version is for automatic background updating which is not in the free edition.
Other than that its the same as the free version."
