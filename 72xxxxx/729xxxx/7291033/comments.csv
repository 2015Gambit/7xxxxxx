Rates for CAM

A:8/10
V:4/10

the audio is not bad, but video goes out of focus a lot, the quality of image is not the best (for cam) and you can tell the camera is
not positioned horizontaly... is more like in diagonal. but still, watchable imo. :3 "

,randallytxt,2012-05-23T05:20Z,"Watchable, good sound, eats away some image but is OK, I would say V5 A6. Enough for me, the movie is funny but no big deal, so enough. Thanks."

,randallytxt,2012-05-23T08:59Z,"This nig no seed, just hit and run, very expensive and slow local wide band, sorry, you rich badass whitey folks...

I can only say I started laughing my guts out when he was born with a beard, his mother was smothered (childbirth death) and he won many medals at his own olympic games .... by shooting rivals. Then it goes not so funny but always giving you a smile. I enjoyed it."
,Kole97,2012-05-23T11:01Z,"Watchable,~~ only thing is not a full screen or picture.what ever you wanna call it.v/7 a/7 for a cam. Movie is funny, but need full screen for subs."
,luketheapple,2012-05-23T13:37Z,"I shall torrent as high as my bandwith will allow for the next 12 hrs, 24 if movie is gooodd"
,W_Inter,2012-05-23T14:34Z,"The audio is easy to listen to, the visual isn't the best but then this film is only just out in the cinema so it would be silly to expect DVD quality. I think it misses a few minutes of the film, but then again its much better than nothing, and much better than watching it in Stalinese."
,Hazard21,2012-05-23T14:43Z,"We want Greek Subs..!!! Did anyone find them?
Greek Subs teams translate this movie..!!
I know it's still fresh.. but make it happen asap!! :D"

,yoya8d,2012-05-23T19:29Z,"just download both...russian and english, and play and mute the russian one, and play this one just for audio...and there you go...you have good audio and good video quality"
,Lonepup,2012-05-24T09:40Z,"Just finished watching this - not bad for a ""cam"" flick! This is probably the funniest movie I have ever seen, a bit crass at times, but only Sacha can pull that off!"
