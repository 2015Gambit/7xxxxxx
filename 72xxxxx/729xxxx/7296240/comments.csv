I've downloaded different playstation emulators but could never get it to work. Thanks Kokotinka. Works almost perfectly. I just started playing and the opening cut scene had no sound.. not sure if it's an isolated issue, just hope it doesn't happen again, even if it does I could deal with the cut scenes having no sound. the game works fine other than that. I'm not that great with hacking the psp either. I probably need updated homebrew firmware or whatever you call it. "
,Kokotinka,2012-06-08T15:46Z,"hey jtata, glad you like it... I've no issues according to missing sound in cutscenes, I'm running on 5.50 gen-d3... You just might want to try to upgrade your firmware or you could use POPS loader plugin which can load older fw as default. I've few more JRPGS from PSx if you're interested just let me know."
,alecuy234,2012-06-08T20:14Z,how do you run the game?
,Kokotinka,2012-06-09T16:05Z,Just copy folder to your ms0:/PSP/GAME/ *place folder here*
,PSPSPSP,2012-08-04T09:17Z,If this is a PSN release then it shouldn't require pops to play as it is a psp port not a psx conversion. In other words square will have done the hard work getting it to run on an ofw psp so it should run on any cfw psp without any problems.
,Kokotinka,2012-08-16T17:34Z,"yeah, ya right about that... it doesn't require pops"
