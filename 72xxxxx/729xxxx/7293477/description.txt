Urban FreeStyle Soccer 



Game modes set to be included in Urban Freestyle Soccer are home turf, versus, freestyle, challenge, and training. There will also be a number of minigames. The gameplay will be fast and furious, with many different showboating tricks, including volleys, flicks, juggles, and scissors kicks. Rules in Urban Freestyle Soccer will be few and far between, and there won't be any offside rulings or fouls to get in the way of the game's arcade-style pacing. The game will feature a dynamic two-layered combo system, as well as supercharged netbuster power-up attacks, for earning high scores. Each environment in the game will be tailor-made for its representative gang, presenting specific objects and boundaries that will increase the level of home-field advantage.
