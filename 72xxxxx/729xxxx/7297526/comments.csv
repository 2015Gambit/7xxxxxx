,spunkster,2012-05-30T00:13Z,"I don't get it. Where do you insert the keys?
""insert license file"" needs a lic file, ""insert activation code"" needs a valid email, city and country, and the code needs to be in 3 6-character strings - none of which describes the ""serial keys"" above. I tried using the first 18 characters before the hyphen and just inventing the rest and that doesn't work."
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-06-01T05:03Z,"You idiot, this is AVast FREE Antivirus. Its free to use, you dont need any serial. Its not Avast Internet SEcurity... So dont download it here, you can get it at AVAST for free."
