,GeerGoros,2012-05-24T04:49Z,"It was a nice, smooth download. It installed and appeared on my desktop, but an error pops up when trying to run it.
""No JVM could be found on your system.
Please define EXE4J_JAVA_HOME
to point to installed 32-bit JDK or JDE or download a JRE from www.java.com""

I have a feeling is painfully easy to fix, but I don't know where to start. "
,GeerGoros,2012-05-24T06:12Z,"Of course, that was a simple fix. Thanks for the torrent!"
,TrueTro,2012-05-25T04:57Z,It puts a Minecraft.exe icon on your desktop
,midnightisis,2012-05-27T01:06Z,Can i go into other ppl servers? if so im trying an i can't
,midnightisis,2012-05-27T01:18Z,i go to ur server an im not even getting any help there. im deleting this
,k3bunqren8,2012-05-27T11:47Z,Did my comments got deleted? :(
,TrueTro,2012-06-13T08:14Z,"No comments were deleted, you can go into other server with this client. That's unusual to get no help."
,Sunny_Dia,2012-06-30T03:33Z,"I'm having the same problem as midnightisis. I can access the Breadcraft server just fine, but I can't access any other server (other than my own, although my friends can't join mine). Is there a way to fix this?"
,TrueTro,2012-07-01T20:45Z,If your friends cant join yours that's something not related to the client. There are many people who connect to many servers including myself. Maybe you have old files or are trying to access a non cracked server with a cracked client.
,supergoat2,2012-07-21T16:00Z,THX 4 upload worked like a charm
