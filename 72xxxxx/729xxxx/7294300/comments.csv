,coin22,2012-05-24T08:50Z,"Why not avi file, cant use the mp4 once!!"
,BoonesFerry,2012-05-24T08:59Z,"@cuttah no fucking spoilers ass hole.
hope you and your ip are banned from this site and added to the torrent swarm shit list. "
,THEcondor,2012-05-24T18:39Z,"@cuttah... very bad taste indeed, but don't come down on him too hard, I can't believe anyone would NOT know who won by this time.  AI needs to rethink it's voting system to give an equal chance to the people who can't hide in their bedroom from their parents and vote until midnight on their cellphone.  132 million votes sounds good but actually it just makes it possible for the teenyboppers to ""Vote For The Worst""."

you should be shot with balls of your own dung."
,traffer,2012-05-25T02:03Z,"@Cuttah Major asshole. @THEcondor When you live outside the US, you definitely rely on the download and definitely do not know the winner until viewing it. "
,cuttah,2012-05-25T05:40Z,"by then, if you had googled ""who won american idol"" you would have known who the winner is. also youtube would have the video. once you  have internet. anyway, now looking back at my action I can see where I went wrong and it was not my intention to spoil the fun. am sorry.
