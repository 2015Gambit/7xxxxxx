The series centers around a group of rookie cops. Rookie Blue is a youthful, heartfelt, one-hour, character-driven workplace drama about five rookie cops plunged into the high stakes world of big city policing - a world where even the smallest mistake can have life-or-death consequences. The series follows them just out of the police academy where they bonded together, fought together, drank together, worked together and slept together. And now they're on the job together. They're kids with guns, learning firsthand the hardest kind of policing there is. They are first responders and they are about to learn that no amount of training prepares you for life.

,lynx_ca,2012-05-26T13:27Z,"Watched it since it first came out. Based and filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. They aren't just out of the academy anymore, though idk what this season has in store. If you haven't watched the first 2 seasons I recommend downloading those first. 
If you liked NYC 22 or if you liked Third watch, you will like this. "
