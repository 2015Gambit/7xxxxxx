its pretty okay you can see it, but its a okay cam version."
,SweetResilience,2012-06-26T13:11Z,"Cute movie. Pretty good theater camera. Pretty blurry at times but not crystal clear either. The worse parts where when the sound would go out and sound like it was in a concert hall/old timey type of thing and a few people walked on the bottom of the screen but overall a pretty good, well worth watching camera version. Thanx."
