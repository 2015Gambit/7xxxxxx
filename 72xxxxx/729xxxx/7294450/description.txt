Apologies for packing a torrent file within a torrent but at 220gb the only other way to upload this on TPB is to pack it all in RAR files (yuck) or split up the set, both of which defeat the whole purpose of packing this all together.

This torrent is already posted on a certain other torrent site, where I am able to upload much larger collections. I feel the current limitations of the Pirate Bay upload system quite acutely.

I've devoted a 250gb drive to this torrent, and intend to seed forever. Last check I had three peers over 25%, one of those over 32%.
