,ProphetZarquon,2012-06-20T18:35Z,"5 seeds and counting!  Thanks for uploading folks, every seed and peer helps.

Still wishing I could upload larger collections without nesting Torrent files inside each other.  I have more to share!

I'm seeing a lot of good peers (%50 complete or so) who are sharing like mad.  Thanks guys!  Hopefully a few seedboxes will pick this up because I haven't found a collection this complete anywhere else."

TNG - Awesome
DS9 - EPIC
Voyager - Slow but good
Enterprise - Scott Bakula killed the franchise."

No comment on The Animated Series with classic original cast?

The idea that you'd rate DS9 as somehow better than either of the two previous series hurts me.  That show was a soap opera.  I only included it because it has to be there for a complete collection, and I only downloaded it so I could locate Sisko's totally horrendous overacting in the episodes where he's a writer in an asylum.

""I can SEE it!  It's REEEEAL!  In my MIND.""

Scott Bakula was sappy as a captain, but how can you ignore characters like Trip and Jolene Blalock's T'Pol?

I don't really see how Voyager was slow, unless you mean the series' overarching plot arc, for which I'd have to say TNG takes the cake for taking the longest time to get to each point.  Each episode and season had it's own issues.  I really wasn't happy with Kes until they matured her, and then poof she was gone!  But 7 of 9 came in so no loss there as far as I'm concerned.

Seriously, Enterprise was pretty weak, but I'd in no way say it killed the franchise.  Lack of writing budget did that, as it did with so many other shows at that time.  Reality TV, ghost schlock and stock-footage crockumentaries are much cheaper to produce.

I really like your uploads, but seriously, rating DS9 as your favorite calls my entire sense of your judgement into question.  That show never went anywhere.  Wasted potential with every major character.

;)  Just a little jibe and jabbing between Star Trek fans."
