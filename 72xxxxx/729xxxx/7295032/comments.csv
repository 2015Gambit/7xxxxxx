,ssshonky,2012-05-26T08:12Z,"Hmm. This took a LONG time to download and the image quality is good but not quite what I expected. On a large screen is looks quite "" dotty"" for lack of a better word. Oh well , just an observation after all how can you moan when its free?"
,Beowulf6666,2012-05-27T05:01Z,horrible video quality
,Jonasx,2012-06-07T23:22Z,"PublicHD usually do good rips. The quality isn't bad, but the sound... It's very quiet. I'm guessing this is not 5.1, and the DTS is 2.0 (stereo) or 2.1. More comprehensive tech info  would be appreciated in future releases."
