First of Three live performances by Les Claypool and the "Fungi and Foe" band. Recorded March 21 2010 @ "Jam in the Dam" in Amsterdam. Its a good recording with hilarious crowd banter and awesome jam-outs. 

The files are .wav files.... Don't complain, thats how they were given to me. 


ENJOY!
