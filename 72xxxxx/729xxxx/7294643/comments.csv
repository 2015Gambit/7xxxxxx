,Tim_Kuik_Brein,2012-05-28T19:17Z,@beowolf6666: all 1080p MKV is high quality. NLupper002 is the best and i only download drom him. Try it and have fun. 
,Beowulf6666,2012-05-30T03:28Z,@Tim_Kuik_Brein if the quality is as fucking horrible as the publichd.eu guys...i might as well not...thats why i ask for screen shots to check for quality (have a look at their 1080p upload shots and ull notice how horrible it is)
,Handicapped_Ent,2012-06-05T06:56Z,I'm almost exclusively getting my torrents from NLUPPER. Superb. Thank you.
,Beowulf6666,2012-06-09T02:17Z,"i downloaded it and immediately regretted it!
