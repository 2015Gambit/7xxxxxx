,shav00,2012-05-23T22:54Z,And the imdb link :p
,psychoacer,2012-05-24T00:56Z,I still don't get the point of a 1080p release at such a low bitrate. If the pixel density isn't even in the ball park of a 1080p image why not just make it 720p at this file size. You are bound to see less blockies in something like that. Do people just see 1080p and assume it's better then 720p?
,Applegrenade,2012-05-24T08:30Z,"Any idea why this movie keeps freezing for me, it'll freeze for about 30 seconds to a minute and then it'll skip about 20 seconds and play normally for a couple minutes and then do it again. really pissing me the fuck off."
,millennium5,2012-05-24T09:49Z,"@Applegrenade: there can be various causes for the problems you describe, first the source, the movie your playing itself it could be corrupted, since noone else complains about it it could be that you got some faulty bits, try rechecking the file.

If that's does not help dl a file with a similar dense compression ratio ( a similar small 1080p movie file) If you have similar problems it's your computer, possibly software (virus/Trojan/crappy software) or hardware, if you have an old grafix card its time to get a new one, even e cheap one will do compared to a more than 5 years old one.

It can also be a codec problem in witch case you need to reinstall K-Lite codec pack with I use or your pack whatever you use.

That's a few hints on what you could try, most likely you find the cause there."

,greydawg,2012-07-07T12:50Z,v=10 a=10 as always... thanks yify
,crcfail,2012-09-20T05:13Z,This was very hard to find since you have spelled the name of the movie incorrect.
