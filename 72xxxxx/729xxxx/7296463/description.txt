Synopsis: this version is for minimalists who prefer portable apps. but would
like to have Photoshop + Bridge..

Note: 
* this is a revision to my previous releases.
* instead of releasing a patch, which causes confusion, i decided to repack
everything.
* do not use if you have PS installed.

Revison 1.0:
* massive performance tweaks
* cleaned up coding
* faster load-time
* added support for Visual C++

FOR ALL THE WHINERS THAT KEEP COMPLAINING ABOUT 3D NOT BEING AVAILABLE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Note that all 3D features are unavailable on Windows XP in Photoshop CS6
* You must have a compatible Graphics Card for 3D & most high-intensive plug-ins

Why Use PAF?
* no virtualization
* runs naturally, as if installed
* leaves no trash behind

Shout out to CORE & EMBRACE:
* please release a "Proper" keygen & crack.. 
* current cracks do not provide all features .. i.e. Language Packs, etc.
