Henry IV Parts 1 and 2 from Shakespeare's Globe Theatre captured from Sky Arts 2.

This 2010 performance features an Olivier Award-winning performance from Roger Allam as Falstaff alongside Jamie Parker as Prince Hal.

Part 1:
Shakespeare's gripping account of the rise of Hal from idle barfly to monarch-in-waiting combines compelling power politics with the hilarious antics of Falstaff - Shakespeare's greatest comic creation.

Part 2:
Includes some of the greatest moments in Shakespeare: the deathbed scene of the old King, when Hal contemplates the crown; the reunion of Falstaff with his old boon companion, Justice Shallow; and Hal's devastating rejection of Falstaff himself.
