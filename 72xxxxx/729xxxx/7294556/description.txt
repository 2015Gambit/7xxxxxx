Full Modded GTA IV ORIGINAL Xbox 360 [NTSC] DEADLY FISHES 

wonder how those people in gta 4 online have modded cars?
they can spawn special cars in full parking lot mode 
drive super fast?

well i bought the multi player mod from these guys
there the best they compile the best mods into one,
its 40 bux so hey why not give it to the world for free

U DONT NEED A MODDED XBOX !!!
YOU NEED THE ORIGINAL DISC GTA 4 !!!
TIP:When opening the magnet when u open the cd rom do not 
pull the magnet and break it u gotta twist it softly when u 
open up the cd rom for the first time 

WHEN PLACING MAGNET BACK IN AND DISC UNDERNEATH IT BE CAREFUL 
I SCRATCHED 2 DISCS OF GTA TO DEATH WHEN I PUT IT IN CROOKED OR WRONG 

instructions in there i burned the entire mod disc directly to a image file so u would get it UNTOUCHED DIRECTLY from them 

its a direct image file jus burn the image file directly to ur blank dvd thru alcohol , if u have any questions comment here, hey were all  a community
