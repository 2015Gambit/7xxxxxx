Thanks a lot"
[T],Snowhiter,2012-05-23T23:05Z,@pbpet - 2nd Episode up now...
,pbpet,2012-05-24T13:36Z,"Awesome! Thanks! Keep them coming.
Thanks again"
,drhulez,2012-06-03T23:42Z,"One thing you may wish to do in the future: turn off the clicking sound that your browser makes every time it goes to a new site. That ""click"" got recorded along with the Hatufim audio :D"
[T],Snowhiter,2012-06-04T18:55Z,"@drhulez - Yep - I discovered that too after I uploaded it. E02 onwards are 'click free' as these are taken direct from DVD. If you want me to re-upload I will.

Thanx for the comments - much appreciated"
,manpatio,2012-06-10T15:31Z,"You are absolutely astonishing. A plain ""thanks a lot!"" does not suffice. 

If you have the time, please reupload this without the clicking sound.

Again, thanks."
