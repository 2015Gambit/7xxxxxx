,nipunb,2012-05-22T21:12Z,"kinda weird, the first Alan wake game was 7.6 GB in size, but this one is straight 5 GB less than that....
I've read reviews that the XBOX version has even more longer gameplay that the first game, does that mean they ripped or removed some things from the PC port....  hope not
downloading now, will see....."

This isn't a sequel.  It's more like a standalone expansion."
