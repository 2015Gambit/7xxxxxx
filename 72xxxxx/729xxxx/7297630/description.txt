Brooks Grinder

This torrent contains the complete plans for the Brooks Tool and Cutter Grinder. The Brooks is often referred to as the Brooks Stent as it is heavily influenced by the Stent grinder. The main difference is that Brooks designed his grinder to be built without needing dovetail construction and without needing castings. Which makes manufacture easier. Another advantage to this design as compared to the Quorn is the capiability for rapid traverse which facilitates using this grinder as a "poor mans surface grinder".

This design can be modified to use the Broadley spindle, the plans for which can be obtained in the yahoo quorn usergroup.
