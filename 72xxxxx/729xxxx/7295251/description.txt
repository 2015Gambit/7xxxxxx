From Baylor to Baylor preserves the legacy of the ACM-ICPC World Finals. The book contains all the problems used during the 1991 to 2006 competitions, carefully typesetted and formatted to the highest standard. Also, almost 100 figures have been completely redrawn to improve their printed quality.
Prefaced by William B. Poucher from Baylor University (Texas) and coordinated by Miguel A. Revilla from Universidad de Valladolid (Spain), this work is the definitive guide to 16 years of history of the International Collegiate Programming Contest, published thanks to the collaboration of the Competitive Learning Institute and the Competitive Infrastructure Initiative.
This book is tribute to all the staff, contestants, judges and volunteers that made it possible.
