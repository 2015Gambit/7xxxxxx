An international panel of 25,000 scientists, who
belonged to 130 countries, was formed under
the aegis of the United Nations, the greatest
international institution in the world. Head-
quartered at Paris, this panel was formed to
investigate the causes of climate change. It
completed its research and submitted a report
to the United Nations. This sensational report
was covered at length by the media, and was
published in detail by the Times of India on
February 3, 2007, titled ΓÇÿWarning SignsΓÇÖ. I think
it would have been more appropriate to call it
ΓÇÿWarning Signs of Doomsday.ΓÇÖ
In the context of recent deliberations by
scientists from all over the world on this
subject, the Times of India, published a report
on May 18, 2007, titled ΓÇÿBy 2050 the Earth
Will be Arid and Empty.ΓÇÖ
