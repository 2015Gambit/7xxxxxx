Movie: Stupid, implausible, cynical nonsense. The message of the movie is that the government and its institutions are capable of policing themselves, that despite tremendous adversity, they can be relied upon to do the right thing in the end. Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the history of U.S. foreign policy will know how utterly ridiculous this is. 

People who actually try to blow the whistle on State corruption are demonised by the state propaganda system and are systematically victimised; Julian Assange is an ongoing case in point.

But it was easy for me to over look your cry for attention with your pitiful attempt to use ""caps lock"" to intimidate others. FYI... Your simple single key stroke does not frighten anyone. in fact, it just makes people hate you. not only on this forum but most likely in life as well. so go some where else(preferably some where without internet access)and be a douche bag there b/c its not wanted or needed here. but i do understand the anger.... id be pissed if i had to wake up every day being you"

,SrMLove,2012-05-27T05:06Z,"RETARDER..... Based on the comments I had to sift through in order to find the relevant info I needed about the torrent.  Which is... the quality of the torrent and is it safe to download. I don’t need to read about, in essence, how mommy and daddy didn’t pay you enough attention. As for the smart phone….. to debate if in fact it is smarter than who ever you were threatening.. I don’t know. But for what you have demonstrated it is definitely smarter than you…. Probably even when its powered off and the batteries are out of it. b/c at least it is not being a dumb ass all over the internet wasting peoples time and causing aggravation to anyone and all it comes in contact with. As for any comment you posted that has been deleted, was most likely and act of kindness by TPB or someone w/ TPB. But you wouldn’t know anything about acting in a manner like that or anything evenly remotely close…. Essentially everyone hates you. But that can all be ok; now you have a goal(s) to accomplish … or let natural selection take care of one of its mistakes overlooked. Im not sure if that name was chosen as an excuse to act like an idiot or your just waving a red flag trying to warn every body. But you really have no excuse…. You are fucking stupid and no one is to blame but yourself. You need to change your domain name from RETARDER to something more politically correct that states that you are in fact a moron. And has nothing to do with being insensitive to those with retardation. That makes you not only ignorant but a jack ass too. Reflect on that… or keep using your “smart” phone to make up for your “dumb” self. So id suggest changing your ways before you piss someone off in real life and they slam that phone through your skull(if you even have the balls to talk shit to anyone closer than a computer forum away).

In fact, not to down play your situation, but your saying this is your worse your life as been and could ever be, but i know of people who had it much worse and took care of the situation or atleast got out of it. i say that out of encouragement and to help you see some more of that light at the end of the tunnel. there are many actions and solutions (some ive already listed) that can be done before begging on the internet for money from complete strangers. you informing everyone of your bad situation and then going directly to asking for money makes it sound 100% like a scam. not saying it is... just appears that way. and i dont think its the best method for achieving what your trying to set out to accomplish. you are waiting, hoping, and expecting for everyone else to do the hard stuff while you sit back and wait for your paypal account to stack up. you said you 20 and a college student, well unless your on drinking or on drugs you can get a job some where. and at that age things are only going to get harder in life. things dont get easier magically..hard work... not only in school which you said you've  shown but all areas of your life. but you sound like a good person in a bad situation. so no matter how hard dont give up... it sounds like although your mother isnt there for you, you have friends who love you and a sister who needs you. some people dont even have that. one day at a time, one problem at a time. and your only 20 and law student with good grades. do what you need to do to get that bright future you deserve. definitely try getting all the government aid you can get your hands on. its out there... and its meant for people like you who desperately need it. im not discouraging others from contributing to your cause and sending money to your paypal account. i just personally dont trust it, dont think others will, and i am just trying to offer any bit of knowledge that i think could help you.(including suggestions on the best way for you succeed with the ""payp"

The ""government"", plays checkers

The CIA and MI5 play 3d chess (3 for triple agent) and no, they don't answer to anyone but themselves. I wouldn't be surprised if Mila Jovovich was and double agent given her gift for colloquial pronunciation of middle English.

I think you have all missed the point though; the story was about personal gain through honesty or betrayal and how to decipher the difference. I'm probably reading to much into an action movie. "

This is for writing comments what you think of the movie,quality and so.

,spifkitten99,2012-06-20T22:49Z,"and I'm not interested in what people think of the movie.

This is for what you think of this release.

Quality of video and audio, errors, etc.

Go to imdb to talk about the movie."

Movie's not as bad as people make it out to be its a MOVIE its for entertainment purposes. If you wanted a realistic movie then you should only watch documentaries and shit"
,LordHumungusNOS,2012-06-24T09:41Z,I agree with janeDough. Just got done watching it. The movie was good and the ending was great. As far as all this anti-amercan bull sit and people acting like this is a documentery. Get a fucking life. It's just a movie.

Vidoe would be a 10 but DVD rips just can't compare to Blu Ray on the my main TV nowadays. Perfect quality to watch on my iPad though! Audio is very quit during dialogue and too loud during action sequences, but nothing a little volume control can't handle. Thanks extreme, you're a PB hero!"
