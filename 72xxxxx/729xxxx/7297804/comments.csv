,Bombjacker,2012-05-25T12:34Z,Is this Cinavia protected?
,ALuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,2012-05-25T18:38Z,"Worst movie EVER! OMG I was like forwarding the whole movies to the Ghost Rider scenes and even those where fucking bad.

The director and scripter should be fucking hanged and Cage should quit the fucking role..

They've killed Ghost Rider twice, idk how much he can handle but I hope than in the near future some brilliant man will remake this project into a sparkling gem.."
,kibles77,2012-05-25T19:05Z,Does this version has the hardcoded subs as well ?
,m_malyszko,2012-05-25T20:49Z,"@ kibles77
I havent downloaded this yet, but from the files it looks like the subtitles arent hardcoded."

Yes, this is Cinavia protected. Was about to see the movie before going to bed on the PS3, but the Cinavia message muted the sounds."

,Powerslave0,2012-05-28T07:11Z,"You must use DTS to not get Cinavia messages.  When you convert to AC3, or other audio track, you will get Cinavia.  Your receiver must be capable of DTS over HDMI.

All SONY pictures will have Cinavia."
