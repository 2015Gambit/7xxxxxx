,tor12,2012-05-26T03:17Z,This stopped at 93%.. Zero seeds. maximerks torrent went down fast. 
,Vulcan219,2012-05-26T09:54Z,"Checking it out, as scenebalance has always been one of the better few who posts movies. "
,Vulcan219,2012-05-26T10:18Z,"Well was going to check it out, seeding just dropped off and stuck at 94%"
,eXore7,2012-05-26T12:13Z,"BEST COPY EVER.

V:10

Totally recommended!
I wish there was a copy like this for The Avengers :("
,Swining,2012-05-26T19:23Z,"Yeah, its stuck at 94% with 0 seeders and I've tried finding other trackers for the same file.

Come on, I bewieve in yew!!!"
,Vulcan219,2012-05-26T19:51Z,Still stuck at 94% I know others can start reseeding to make it work. But why Rar files this time Scene?
,Swining,2012-05-26T22:37Z,Aren't they the same rar files released by ADTRG? You would think somebody would be seeding the same rars.
,Swining,2012-05-29T03:19Z,"Just don't bother guys, seedbox/the guy isn't coming back."
