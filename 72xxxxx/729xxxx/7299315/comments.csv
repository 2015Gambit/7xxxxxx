,snowpea29,2012-05-26T04:27Z,SDDont Bother getting theres only one crappy copy  out and everyone is claiming its theirs and to download it....And its a cam not a TS
,Spawn73b,2012-05-26T04:55Z,"It's a CAM. Looses picture once in a while.

And the last 10 minutes or so is not there, huge let down."
,pinzmoo,2012-05-26T08:46Z,"watchable, but about 5 times through out the movie the camera is pulled down, missing some scenes.

and as last poster said missing ending very sad about that but thx for the effort upper.

all and all very watchable, but for someone that wants to see the full I would wait, and all the mib3 torrents out there are this one.

,QWESTSUX,2012-05-26T10:18Z,Thanks for the feedback we'll wait
,beachbum37,2012-05-26T11:47Z,"I have been a silent watcher of PB goings on for a very long time. I have spent 20 years of my life in the army, and i am having a very hard time understanding one thing:knowledge is free, the desire to LEARN  is taught. So instead of complaining shut up or learn. BTW i am only making this post simply because i am tired of whiners PEOPLE TAKE THERE TIME TO GIVE YOU THIS SO ACCEPT AND BE HAPPY OR FRACK OFF."
,nesperi,2012-05-26T12:13Z,Thank you
,metalvegetax,2012-05-26T18:09Z,i second that STOP crying like little b1tchez
,Got_Bud,2012-05-26T18:57Z,"it isn't crying or whining when people are saying the ending isn't there. Why even bother to upload when there isn't an ending? Seriously.
It is just a waste of time/bandwidth all around."
,Ripper85,2012-05-26T19:05Z,it's good to get all the info u can b4 downloading it though... bad or not..
,K1bbler,2012-05-26T19:37Z,"I agree with Got_Bud. Why doesn't the uploader just up the trailer and tell us all to go f**k ourselves if we don't like the quality. 

Understandably the quality is bad but there is no excuse for chunks of the movie to be missing."
[V],maximersk,2012-05-26T21:43Z,"@K1bbler AND Got_Bud 
Guys, get money and Go to the cinema !"

,CRichards9,2012-05-27T18:22Z,uploader... do me a fav... dont EVER upload shit again 
,K1bbler,2012-05-27T20:19Z,Uploader is worse than a pirate. They are an upload credit stealing dumbass.
,depth-mod,2012-05-27T20:42Z,"Am I the only one noticing how the folks who complain the most vehemently aren't ""Trusted"" or ""VIP"" ?  

And has the meaning for ""TS"" changed in a year or two?  It's like commenters expect perfect cinema quality video from that tag in all the torrents.  "
,tfcdan1234,2012-05-28T04:54Z,"@CRichards9

Do everyone and stfu. Damn all anyone does on here is complain about the quality. ITS FUCKING FREE, if you don't like it than get off your lazy ass and go buy a ticket to see it!"

,andrewed,2012-05-31T03:52Z,"Thank you for the effort. I'll never bitch about the quality of an upload because it costs me nothing and I can't/won't do it myself. My only suggestion would be if the torrent is missing a large portion of the movie or the ending, I think the uploader should mention that in the description. That way they, and we, wouldn't have to listen to everyone bitching about it. "
