,MrDEA666,2012-06-25T22:02Z,"The keygen is the black .exe file in the folder that you downloaded. Of course if you anti-virus hasn't auto deleted it, because it thought it was a virus. Which of course it isn't. It's just a false positive.

P.S. Great torrent. Thank you for uploading it. It works perfectly."
