,ClipperCigars,2012-05-24T14:00Z,"Someone needs to learn how the hell to use their ripping app correctly.

All 29 episodes are combined as a single .MVK file 22gigs in size, not as individual episodes."
,somms,2012-05-24T21:21Z,"To ClipperCigars,

I'm sorry that this is sized to fit onto a blu-ray as a single .mkv file, feel free to edit it to your particular liking and split into individual episodes if you choose and you can then upload this as your torrent to share with others."
,ivancro1,2012-05-25T09:08Z,are the eisodes addes as chapters?
,RJ86_HU,2012-05-25T13:25Z,"Okay, question... how do you have episodes that have never aired yet? 
I'm really eager to get episode 73-74 as they aired already a few weeks ago and they're not  on any torrent sites..."
,fsmulder,2012-05-26T14:40Z,"@RJ86_HU if you go to the History Channel website, you will see episodes 65 - 78 have already been released on DVD/BluRay for Season 6. @ClipperCigars I'm like you I'd prefer the individual episodes but only because I have the 720p downloaded up to episode 71, I'm only interested in 72-78 (got episode 75 as 720p yesterday). Had to download 22.5GB when I only needed to download 6-7GB for what I was missing. Normally I seed 3x back but for a 22.5GB file I will probably not seed this 3x. @Somms - Thanks for the upload, as of right now this is the only way to get Episodes 73-74 and 76-78, until released as individual files. I'm happy to get them, beggars can't be choosers.  "
,polarbearable,2012-05-26T19:03Z,"Thanks. But now I have to separate this into individual files. Sure, VLC will jump chapters (episodes) but my media player won't do this with a .mkv file. I do not understand why all these episodes are bundled into a single file. Thanks for your effort. Cheers."
,bobkool2012,2012-05-26T22:55Z,"Forget all these people who complain. so what if the episodes are crammed together? Somms, YOU ROCK!!! You do the BEST quality. If it was not for you, this series in 1080p would be at least over 200gb. I love this series and I love you! (no homo) "
,movieboy_5280,2012-06-07T16:44Z,"I got it for the hard to find S07E02, ""Alien Sounds"" but the entire file's audio is unfortunately out of sync.

It's a flashback from the classic episode from the old series Bewitched ""Out of sync, out of mind"".

Too bad too as I have episodes 1,3,4 & 5 to add it all to my Dad's father's day present - possibly his last :(.

I'll try to correct it and post if successful.
Otherwise the search continues.

Thanks for trying though."
,movieboy_5280,2012-06-10T15:18Z,"""I'll try to correct it and post if successful.""

I did and it worked.

,IsoSucks,2012-06-17T14:22Z,"Any chance you have When Space Changed History, not blue ray ?"
,ClipperCigars,2012-06-21T06:20Z,"@ Movieboy. Hahahahaha.

There is nothing wrong with the sync on this torrent. The only failure is somms not splitting episodes up as per standard convention. 

The only episodes that have audio issues are YOURS. 

Get a better computer and quit talking shit."
,Speechless1998,2012-06-25T16:37Z,"movieboy....go to your local (not in the mall) music store where actual musicians go and get yourself an entry level USB 24 bit 48kHz analogdigital audio unit and take the load off your CPU. On-board audio chips suck. You need an uninterrupted CPU to process video properly. Your audio chip is cutting in on the action and therefore inhibiting the fluidity of your video. Also on-board audio is unbearably noisy.
As for this monster file... Nobody wants to handle a mammoth like this. I know I have better things to do than sit here splitting it up.  
Also... just because the BluRay listed the show's in this order doesn't mean it's the network's or the creator's intended order. I'm pretty sure ""God and the Universe"" was the intended Season 6 Finale."
