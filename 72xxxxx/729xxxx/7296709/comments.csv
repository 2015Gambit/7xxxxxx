,Kazooper,2012-05-28T07:43Z,"I will seed as much as I can. My internet is spotty during the day sometimes but stays on throughout the night. I'm not sure if its letting me seed all the shows at once either, some of them say ""queued seed"". I could force start them but I feel like that may slow the rest of them down even more.. Hopefully once others start seeding them as well it lightens the burden on me and the rest of the uploads speed up as well.

Also if anyone is interested, if anyone would like to send me a flash drive and the cost it takes to ship it back, I would be a glad to fill it up with whatever years you like and mail it back. I know some peoples connections might not be able to handle all this. Pre71 to 79 is 52.5 gigs total, so a 64gb flash does handle it all, but if there are only certain years you want, and you have a smaller flash drive, that works too. Also have all the dead soundboards 68-81 I could put on flash drives as well.
