Small request tho, maybe you could start upping the SD version again like you have done earlier this season? For those on laptops and bad harddisc space, just annoying to wait for a 1 or 2 gb upload when the 14 gb upload came 6-7 hours ago. 
Either way, thanks for sharing. "

I have specified this (and how it's make) in my oldest comments. Please, guys, read those comments. In my beginnings of torrent's user I've read all the comments and I've learned from there. u r welcome too!"
