This needs about 1.5GB of video card memory to play at above 1080p which you should have if you have gtx 560 or greater"
,cschrille1,2012-05-24T22:59Z,"Will GTX 580 Twin Frozr II, 8gb RAM and i5 2500k run this well?"
,Maous1,2012-05-24T23:28Z,Yes very well im using a Evga gtx 580 hydro copper 2 3gb version and i have no issues in even the most graphical scenes and my supersampling is cranked up to 4x

,Maous1,2012-05-29T22:42Z,"Theres a couple files causing conflicts for various users that are in the rar but not in my installation.

Please navagate to the skyrim folder and then navagate to the data folder and delete the following.

Balanced_Alteration.esp
Balanced_Conjuration.esp
Balanced_Destruction.esp
Balanced_Illusion.esp
Balanced_magic_data.xls
Balanced_Magic_Novice.esp
Balanced_Restoration.esp
ApachiiHairStyles.esp
ApachiiHairStylesELVES.esp
DeadlyDragonsSpells.esp
DeadlyDragonsSpells.bsa
DYNAVISION Dynamic Depth of Field.bsa
DYNAVISION Dynamic Depth of Field.esp
Extended Colors - Selection.esp
Extended Colors.esm
HighResTexturePack01.esp (do not delete the bsa's)
HighResTexturePack02.esp (do not delete the bsa's)
MidasSkyrim.bsa
MidasSkyrim.esp

These effects are covered by other better mods and having these extra's was causing strange behavior and crashes.

Lastly to optimize mod load orders and ensure stability please download and run BOSS here

http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6

USE Nexus mod manager or open skyrim launcher manualy and navagate to data files and move perky.esp back to the bottom right above the multiple SC_Modular Magic mods.

THIS IS NOT FOR CRACKED VERSIONS OF THE GAME PLEASE READ THE MAIN POST

This is for steam users only or those that know how to merge these folders and replace these files manually without my instructions.

The Skryim Script Extender will not work with cracked version so it will cause unfixable stability errors crashes and graphical glitches

Enjoy Jacking up your skyrim experiance!!!"
