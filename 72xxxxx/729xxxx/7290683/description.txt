KILLERS didn't ivtc leaving dupe frames for ~95% of the show.
The only small parts of the show that are 29.97 are some flash
cuts of archive footage. Everything else need ivtc.
All interviews, all segments with Kurt himself, the new 
reenactments and some of the archive footage was shot at 
23.976 so how you figure this is close enough to even be up 
for debate is beyond our imagination.


As a second note for the proper attempt of E01 about stripped 
headers that only goes for the sample which is unfortunate but 
not a nukeable offence. It was the sample cutters fault and 
has now been corrected so for future reference you might wanna 
leech the entire release when trying to release bogus propers.
