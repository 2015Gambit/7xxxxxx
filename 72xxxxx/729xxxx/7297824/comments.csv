My 1st ever request, please could you consider the major classic from 1983 ""Scarface"" (Al Pacino et al) in 1080p. I ask because there are some 1080p versions on TPB but they tend to be very big file sizes.

Thanks again"
,fofo141,2012-05-27T03:34Z,Thank you so much YIFY

,novafox,2012-06-19T08:10Z,"This isn't even HD, this is some whack aspect ratio. Remove the 1080 tag, it's false advertising."
,firexninja,2012-07-20T20:35Z,thank you!
,peterparkerdatsme,2012-08-07T21:59Z,"@novafox : Go buy the movie, dude. HD starts at 1920 x 720. This rip is 1920 x 800, which is perfect size. 

*Note to complainers: Do you guys even realize how fucking big these rips would be if they were just straight rips--full resolution and full audio? 20+ GBs. Do you all even realize how long it takes to re-encode a fucking Blu-Ray after it's ripped? Ungrateful bastards.

Thanks for the upload YIFI. 1920 x 800 is the exact res of my Nexus 7 and these movies rock on it."
