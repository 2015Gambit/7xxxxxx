,texmaam69,2012-06-26T19:31Z,NETAI  - subs are rendered by the video player.  Look at the docy for your player. 
,agungsp2000,2012-06-26T19:39Z,"@netai find a subtitle file from engsub.net or other subtitle's site

then, make sure the name of the subtitle is the same as the video file, but different extension usually .srt"
