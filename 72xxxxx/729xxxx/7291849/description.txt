Times are hard for everyone. Even Johnny can't provide for his girlfriend and himself. In fact, today, she's taking him into a Sperm
Bank to donate his soldiers. Johnny is willing to do it, mostly after Darcy, the nurse, offers to lend him a strong hand and a little more. The only
problem is that in the heat of the moment, Johnny and Darcy forget to put his donation in the cup and she gets it all over her.
