File is compatible with XBOX360, PS3, etc...

Clip is from American Idol.

2-pass encoded as always!


Original file had a LOT of block noise because of all the laser lights, even though it was about over 500 MB MPEG-2. I cleaned up the block noise very much with 2 VirtualDub filters. I also remapped the audio properly and normalized it to loud volume too, without clipping.

I also changed the framerate to 29.97 from 59.94.

So if quality is not to your liking, it's not my fault! lol I did really well with what I had to work with!
