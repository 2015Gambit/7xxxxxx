English full subtitles are the ones for deaf people so if you want normal subs you can use:

or

, timings are identical. 
About the movie it was really awesome. Visually stunning, entertaining, fast paced, great music, gorgeous lead actress,... I really don't understand why it didn't perform better at the box-office because it's way better than most movies. Definitely worth seeing."
