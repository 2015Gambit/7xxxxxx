The Trial of the Moke is based on the real life story of the humiliation and anguish suffered by Lt. Henry Ossian Flipper, the first black graduate of West Point. Assigned to serve at Fort Davis, Texas in 1881, Flipper became the object of a conspiracy to rid the base of its only black graduate. Flipper, portrayed by Franklyn Seales, was framed by white officers who accused him of embezzling government funds. Ninety-four years later, Flipper was vindicated only a week after "The Trial of the Moke" ended its world premiere run at the Milwaukee Repertory Theater in 1976. A military reburial with honors followed in 1978.
