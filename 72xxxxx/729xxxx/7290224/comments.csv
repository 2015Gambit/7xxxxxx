,soundscape,2012-05-24T15:04Z,don't waste your time with this download.  requires password not given.
,zsegiff,2012-05-24T15:40Z,Helló. Te ki írtad a DIRT SHOWDOWN-t? Mert nekem 2.0 flash van a gépemen és vissza pecseltem el is inditja de hiba üzit ír. Tiszitsam meg a lemezt és inditsam ujra és le áll. Kiírtam simán pecs nélkűl is de az kuka. Neked működik? Mi lehet a baj?
,ryunax14,2012-05-24T16:08Z,i get unreadable disc but i burned this with ihas with philips  but dragons dogma worked but sometimes get unrwadable but its very playable
[V],boobsman,2012-05-24T18:36Z,"@ bert48 this is a codemasters game, they have online activation via a card that comes with the game, you'll need to check ebay etc... if you want to play online."
,wazster,2012-05-24T22:09Z,Boobsman I keep getting Game error 'Failed to authorise disc' when I get to the player profile setup screen. Any suggestions my friend? Do you have to use an Ihas burner?
,wazster,2012-05-24T22:12Z,Boobsman I keep getting Game error 'Failed to authorise disc'. Any suggestions my friend? Do I need an Ihas burner for this one?
,zomaxeren,2012-05-24T22:36Z,"Hey Boobsman.
I patched this to work with LT 2.0, but keep getting the unreadable disc, both with this and Ghost Recon Future Soldier. Patching it has worked previously with Prototype 2 being the latest succesful result.
I updated the dashboard with the Sniper Elite V2. 

Any idea what is wrong?
I also wrote this on Ghost Recon Future Soldier torrent, because it's exactly the same problem."
,jamesfludgate,2012-05-25T01:11Z,"Dirty Disc Error

Is this an iHas burn?"
[V],boobsman,2012-05-25T01:40Z,"@ wazster you should be investing in an ihas burner anyway, i've not burned using truncate but this works 100% with i has so maybe that's you problem :(

@ zomaxeren again not using LT2.0 anymore, you really should think about updating to LT3.0, anyway are you using i has or truncate? maybe that's the issue."
,jamesfludgate,2012-05-25T02:02Z,"Boobs

U got a FB/Twitter/email/profile?"
,zomaxeren,2012-05-25T12:32Z,"@ Boobsman 

I'm using truncate"
,wazster,2012-05-25T19:39Z,thanks for replying boobsman. What firmware do you recommend installing to the ihas and is it a complex process?  Once installed do you still use imgburn or is a different program required? many thanks for all your efforts

,djbillyb,2012-05-26T18:42Z,hi boobsman thanks for upload but keep getting Game error 'Failed to authorise disc' i have 3.0 and burned with ihas 1st time i have had this error any suggestions cheers again m8
,kalimnos5,2012-05-27T10:14Z,"@djbillyb To solve the ""Failed to Authorize disc""

Unistall the game from your console. Thats what I did with Ghost Recon Future Soldier and it worked for me.

Just play the game from the disk and not the hard drive. Hope that helps."
,djbillyb,2012-05-27T15:53Z,@kalimnos5 cheers will give it try m8 will let u no the out come
,djbillyb,2012-05-27T17:51Z,@kalimnos5 cheers m8 working now 
,djbillyb,2012-05-27T19:10Z,no its not still getting same error 
,pirates4eva,2012-05-27T19:51Z,@ djbillyb this game is never going to work as it has not been ripped properly it has been ripped using the old 0800 firmware v 1.6 and not the one required wich is v 3.0 0800 this version is needed 4 all XGD3 games. when you run the iso in abgx360 click the options tab then select display iso file system at the bottom in blue it tells you the drive used to rip this game wich is 1.6 0800. then if you run one of your XGD3 games wich you know work through abgx360 selecting the options as above you will see the drive used to rip that one is V 3.0 0800. just w8n 2 c if a real rip gets put up anywer if not by the end of the bankhols im goin 2 rent this from bb and i will do a real rip using corect fw and upload 4all hope this helps you.
,pirates4eva,2012-05-27T20:41Z,"this game does NOT work using ihas or truncate so that is a load of s..t it cannot work has it has not been ripped using the correct firmware it passes the topology data to boot game as abgx patches it for that but it fails the CIV checks as you play then will reboot console after displaying the ""failed to authorise disc"" msg. you should stop lieing 2 ppl saying ihas works making them go and buy a drive to burn this same BAD rip  they will get 100% burn but will still defo get the dreded msg. its the actual rip of the game the  muppet that riped it  used the wrong fw. i cannot actualy believe this has the complex scene name as they are normaly the most trustworthy scene with no probs!!!"
,gunnersct,2012-05-28T07:42Z,"@pirates4eva.. absolute nonsense. This game works perfectly well. I have burned this on a iHas524 burner, using topology data from LT3 to LT2 with the latest dashboard. It burned perfectly with zero errors and works flawlessly. Because you are an anus and cannot follow simple instructions, you are spreading your inability to others for no reason other than you are a retard. Thanks Boobsman"
,Swining,2012-05-28T08:16Z,"pirates4eva: It's been ripped properly, but I can unfortunately confirm that THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH A TRUNCATED BURN. Must be burnt with iHas. Game will constantly give you the ""Disc not Authorized"""
,pirates4eva,2012-05-28T11:39Z,@gunnersct hey dickhead you have just stated you are using lt 2.0 u fucking retard im on about people using lt 3.0 u fuckin smackhead u dont know what ur fukin talking about u fukin prick ur fukin old school usin that tell ur mum thanks 4 lastnight u shuda said shes a rite dirty whore!!!!!

,MAA11792,2012-05-29T01:23Z,"Thank you for putting all your effort into this release.. but the game itself is shit (please read below and make up your mind before purchase):

This game sucks so hard and I can't honestly comprehend why Codemasters would choose to screw this series of games up even more in the ass buy creating something that is simply full of shit and flaws.

I’m happy to say that I WILL NEVER EVER AGAIN buy anything from Codemasters in my entire life – thank you all pirates out there for releasing this piece of shit game so that we actually have the chance to try it out before spending our hard earned money on [no offence towards my fellow American pirates or its citizens] an Americanized or rather CockbBlockanized software that would be better off in Mrs. Bieber's room alone!

DiRT – Was worthless, cheap graphics and bad indeed very bad handling.
DiRT2 – Was worthless, better graphics and handling but too much of this baja and advertisements everywhere which just looks silly.. not to mention the actually gameplay.
DiRT3 – Was worthless, nothing really new was added except more advertisements and useless baja and more of them fake rally stages (like running the same stage more than 25times in a row back and forth with only a few sets of cars and of course even more advertisement).

To be honest all the previous rally games that were made by Codemasters ''Colin McRae Rally'' was not really that good either, nor the handling but you had at least a hundred plus stages to navigate you way throw, several real rally teams that were up to date and almost no advertisement.. 14years later and all we actually pay for is being brainwashed and commercialised buy some stupid energy drink companies who believe they own the whole world - believe me they're all doing it wrong because some of us (even if were are weak) dear to stand up for ourselves online.

Fuck you Codemasters for releasing this piece of shit game and I’m glad that I DID NOT BUY IT!

[T],razalgul1979,2012-05-30T22:07Z,The game works fine in Ritek media burned at 4x with ihas burner.
,gumph1688,2012-05-31T20:30Z,"@anyone. when i get unauthorized disk, i install game to HDD then deleted it. turned my box off then back on then they work fine, i did this with Prototype2 & Future soldier. try it ("",)"
,n_u_k_e,2012-06-17T02:15Z,"Hi, I'm trying to install (because while playing from the DVD it gives an error) and at 65% it shows an warning, ""Can't read this disc. It may be scratched...."".
I used an iHas with the iXtreme firmware, ImgBurn and Verbatim. The disk verification its all ok.
I already checked a lot of configurations for abgx and ImgBurn, but it seams that none works :|
Could someone provide me with a tutorial that is updated and works? And is anything I can do to correct the errors? Thank you in advance."
