 Lord Rama's life is one of perfect adherence    
 to dharma (righteousness) despite harsh tests   
 of life and time. Sri Rama Rajyam movie         
 explains how poet Valmiki, the author of the    
 epic Ramayana narrates the script in general.   
 The movie further showcases the incidents in    
 Lord Rama's life and how his journey goes on    
 after he saves Sita from Raavana and also       
 highlights the main principle's of Ramayama     
 and Lord Rama i.e. How An Ideal Son, An Ideal   
 Brother, An Ideal Husband and An Ideal Emperor  
 should be. The film starts with the arrival of  
 Rama and Sita to Ayodhya after vanquishing      
 Ravan in Lanka. Rama is now the king of Ayodhya.
 Under his rule the people are happy and         
 prosperous. Just when everything seems to be    
 going fine, a comment by a washer man makes Rama
 to send Sita away into the forest. From here the
 real story of Sri Rama Rajyam begins.
