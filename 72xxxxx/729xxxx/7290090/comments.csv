,thecat18,2012-05-27T06:43Z,Thanks for sharing.
,iPlunder,2012-05-29T00:33Z,"I'm not downloading this because your quality is too low; I'd rather wait for a decent copy than download a poor one.
An hour long show (45 min. without commercials) should be at least 300 MB, 350 is a good target.

Thanks for the effort, hope this helps with the quality of your future uploads."
,rlywndr,2012-06-06T00:12Z,The audio is just terrible.  The first 10 seconds of video looked watchable but very blocky.  Try doubling the bitrate on both audio and video.

I have not heard audio this bad since the 90s."
