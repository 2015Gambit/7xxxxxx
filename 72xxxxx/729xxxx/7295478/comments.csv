-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In torrents, RAR and ZIP don't save anything when used with already compressed
formats like videos, mp3s, jpegs, DVDs and so forth.  All they do is cause your
users to unpack the files then look at the now useless rars and zips and delete
them... which means they stop seeding.  Most of the time there is absolutely
nothing to be gained by using rar or zip in torrents.

Please, don't be a Rartard!
