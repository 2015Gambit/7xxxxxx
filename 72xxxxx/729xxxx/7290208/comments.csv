xp said it could not find xpmule.exe after executing."
,xpmule,2012-05-23T04:08Z,"I don't understand what you said at all.

But installing it should be like ANY other program that does not come with an installer.. Extract the rar to a folder and put the folder some where and double click the .exe
""Program Files"" in your root drive is common usualy C:Program Files

No offence but this is VERY basic computer stuff here and if your not comfortable ""manualy"" installing a program i would advise either using the official emule installer or one of the other many emule mods that come with an installer.

So just to recap, This does not require any special actions aside from maybe needing admin rights on UAC in windows.. other than that it should be a simple process to get going"
,sven_svengali2,2012-05-23T13:13Z,"Now you´re talking !
Why not include that simple instruction in the info box instead of rambling about how wonderful your little product performs.
I´ve used emule for quite some time and understand your concern with it´s sometime shitty performance."
,xpmule,2012-05-23T20:20Z,"LOL wow your reply is shocking !

95% of what I said is valuable information.
I explained what it is and why...

The fact that you couldn't extract an .exe from a rar file and double click it with out MY help is hillarious.

I can tell everyone reading this right now that If you don't know what an eMule Leecher MOD is then this probably is not something interesting to you.

Oh and by the way I was not bragging as you were implying I was stating the facts and WHY someone might bother using my mod instead of one of the other millions of other mods available..
Google it there is TONS of them out there.

There is many people that have been using this software for over 7 years and I have never EVER seen anyone with an attitude like yours, you've been a complete jerk buddy"

I quote:""The fact that you couldn't extract an .exe from a rar file and double click it with out MY help is hillarious."" End quote.

I´m not exactly sure it really was my comment you were refering to.
All I wrote about was windows commenting when
double clicking en .exe file after decompressing.

I have it in my mind you´re still ""under the influence""."
