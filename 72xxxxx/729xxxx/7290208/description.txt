This is a mod I made based on the file sharing program emule.
It's basicly a "Leecher Mod" that runs on the edonkey / emule network.

The major difference between this mod and others is I created
options to enable or disable Leecher functions where as all others
i could find when I first released this mod did not let you do that..

I have released a few versions of this mod a few years ago
but lost interest and other people took over basicly.
The last version I made I never released to the public (0.48a)

So..
I was hoping to do some more work on the graphics and icons etc
but I figured I would release this mod as it is for now.
It seems to work fine and I can make it look prettier some other time lol

This includes a new updated skin/theme (designed for 1080p viewing)
Updated icons / graphics
Based on emule 0.50a with some bug fixs used in the morph xt mod
Also new with this version is the first 64 bit version
Major features include the option to switch between the official
credit system and Dazzle's reverse credit system.
You can also shut off and on sharing of files.
Flags and or country names have been added to various places in the program.
Many restrictions or speed enhancements have been added..
Some older documentation explaining things in detail is included.


Lastly I figured if I didn't just upload this now I'd never get around to it..

I hope people enjoy the mod and I may post up the source code too
I just would like to clean it up some first

If people don't know ? the official emule version does not have
a 64bit version available so my x64 version I made took a hell of
a lot of work to make, including conversions of a lot of 3rd party c++ libs.

I'm rammbling now.. LOL
Questions ?
