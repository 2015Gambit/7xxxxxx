,shizusan,2012-05-31T12:29Z,someone should hack all uploads from http://moegirltouch.com/ like all ones from http://uk.androlib.com/android.developer.digicharaworks-intE.aspx  bastards stole my money had to factory reset my phone and now the backups I did won't install and you have to buy them again and they aren't available on market either so scammers deserve getting full hacked
,blakscrib,2012-06-07T17:05Z,"I needed Titanium Backup Pro. This torrent didn't help me (Got some message like ""Failed Market license check""). But... Lucky Patcher did the trick. Google it.
