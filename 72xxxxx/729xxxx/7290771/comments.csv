,Hancock79,2012-05-23T08:51Z,"yea it's supposed to be small, it was more of an expansion pack than a sequel.  i think the full release was 3gb max"

,WackyBacky2K12,2012-05-24T23:04Z,SigmaSq is talking out of his ass or doesn't know how to simply install a game. It's working and running fine and I'm not the uploader just obvious that there'd be more complains myself inclluded if something had gone wrong.
