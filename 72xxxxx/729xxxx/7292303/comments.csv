When Turner bolts from police custody and thwarts a murder attempt, Murdoch, Inspector Brackenreid and Constable Crabtree demand to know where he got his information. He calmly explains he saw the events happen when he travelled to the future."
[T],ajaxen94,2012-05-23T14:25Z,"well my friends that was the end of S5 of Murdoch Mysteries S6 will be shown on a different channel in Canada in late Septemberand then probably later on Alibi in the UK so i will not need to upload anymore unless no-one uploads it before it is shown in the UK, thanks to all you good people who seeded religiously and kept the series going for others and i know there was a lot of you so goodbye for now"

,abj642,2012-05-24T14:21Z,thank you very much madam. In my country this series is not aired on any channel. Very few know about the series. I think you will have to upload the season 6 as well as no one  uploads the series even though its aired in UK and Canada and I dont know which other countries..
[T],ajaxen94,2012-05-24T15:31Z,@abj642 you can rest assured that if no-one uploads S6 by the time it is shown here in the UK i will most certainly upload it for my friends no matter how few download it
,wicwillie,2012-05-24T23:22Z,"ajaxen94 : that's right ! no one else upload this program and I will be glad if you do so for season 6. By the way, I was so happy with the end of season 5, I really cried with joy !!!"
[T],ajaxen94,2012-05-25T01:26Z,@wicwillie i agree with you the ending was great i wondered when someone would knock their heads together and give them some sense 
,pipo64200,2012-05-26T23:01Z,"Nooooo you have to continue uploading!!!
I'm french and I really need and love your torrents!!! Especially since, here, every good series is shown like a year after it was shown in America...
;)
And Murdoch Mysteries isn't broadcast anymore...
And, I hate french voices...
Well, thanks anyway. You were my sunshine^^"
