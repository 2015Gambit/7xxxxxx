Finally this month - and for the series - Detective Murdoch is suspicious of Gideon Turner, who claims he has knowledge of soon-to-be-committed crimes but refuses to say how or why. When Turner bolts from police custody and thwarts a murder attempt, Murdoch, Inspector Brackenreid and Constable Crabtree demand to know where he got his information. He calmly explains he saw the events happen when he travelled to the future.
