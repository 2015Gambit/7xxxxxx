The trail leads from the beleaguered Estherian Steppes, through the war-torn Mana Wastes and the haunted ruins of an ancient dwarven city, before descending to a realm where no mortal has set foot for thousands of yearsΓÇöand where an even more terrible evil struggles to unleash itself into the world.
