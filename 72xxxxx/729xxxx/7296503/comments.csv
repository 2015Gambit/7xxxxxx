,chris54,2012-05-30T15:55Z,"Hey, now the US version has been released, can you get the extra track or is it still unavailable? Dont mean to annoy. 
There's also Paloma Faiths new album 'Fall to Grace' which was released on monday, any chance of you uploading that? Other people have uploaded it but their bitrate isnt as high, nor have they got the full version. Plus i trust you much more than them. Thanks :):)"
