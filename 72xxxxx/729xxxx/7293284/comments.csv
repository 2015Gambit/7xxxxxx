,DavidVArt,2012-05-23T21:58Z,"Great torrent!!!  You guys do the best work ever.  Definitely a high point in my week.  Anyway you could put up Spawn 215-current, Super Dinosaur, and some of the newer Haunt?  Been trying to keep Spawn pieced together and I've only found 1 Super Dinosaur.  If not I get it, you guys already do more than enough.  Please keep up the great work!!!  Thanks for the amazing work!!!!  :D"
