I've been looking everywhere for a torrent for this, but couldn't find any.  When I finally got it, I decided to upload it to TPB so everyone else can use it too.

This is a modified version of the popular game Minecraft that makes griefing a lot easier.  Griefing is basically razing your enemy's buildings and towns.  However, it can be pretty difficult when you're bound to the normal rules of Minecaftia.  In this torrent, I have included both the modified Minecraft client, as well as a batch file that automates it's installation in Windows (sorry Mac and Linux users, but you'll have to follow the instructions manually). 

Here's a few of the abilities this client gives you:
- X-ray vision that lets you see through everything but ores.
- Not Pushable mode which prevents other users from pushing you.
- Click Nuker allows you to take out a good sized area with every click.
- FullBright which removes all darkness for you.
- Moon Jump abilities  reduces gravity's effect on you.
- NoFall makes you immune to damage inflicted from falling a large distance.
- And many, many more.

I included this in the README as well.  Anyways, here's how to install Nodus Griefing Client:

Windows:
Run "install.bat"
If that does not work you can do it manually:

Go to the location NodusUpdate.jar was saved
Copy/cut NodusUpdate.jar
Open the start menu
Type in "%appdata%" (Type in "Run" for XP, and then type %appdata% in Run) and hit enter
Open the folder ".minecraft"
Open "bin"
Paste NodusUpdate.jar into bin
Delete "minecraft.jar"
Rename NodusUpdate.jar to "minecraft.jar"


OSX Lion (Mac):
Go to the location NodusUpdate.jar was saved
Copy/cut NodusUpdate.jar
Go to "Go"
Click on "Go to Folder..."
Go to the folder "~/Library/Application Support/Minecraft"
Open "bin"
Paste NodusUpdate.jar into bin
Delete "minecraft.jar"
Rename NodusUpdate.jar to "minecraft.jar"


Linux:
Open Terminal.
Type "cp [path]/NodusUpdate.jar .minecraft/bin" but replace "[path]" with the actual path where the file is located (e.g. "cp Downloads/Nodus_Client/NodusUpdate.jar .minecraft/bin")
Type "cd .minecraft/bin"
Type "rm minecraft.jar"
Type "mv NodusUpdate.jar minecraft.jar"
Finally type "exit"
Don't actually type in the quotes, they are just so you are aware of where the command starts and where it ends.


I hope everyone has had as much with this as I have!
If you have any questions, feel free to PM me.
Special thanks to Stonecold1995 for making the quick installation program for Windows (yeah, I know it's simple but I can't into even batch files) and of course, Nodus for making the client itself.
