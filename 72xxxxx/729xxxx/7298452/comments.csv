Thanks!!"
,caincha,2012-05-28T04:36Z,"For those still wondering, this is the real deal.
GREAT quality!

,Ma_Ares85,2012-05-29T07:30Z,I downloaded this and it does not work with my media player classic. All the other files in this format have worked before. I wondering if this file is corrupted.
,JamJulLison,2012-05-30T10:50Z,I didn't even bother to watch the lq version of this when you uploaded it cause immediately when I saw it start playing I could see it was crap. Compared to your other lq eps it sucked. Been waiting for this one and I am glad to see you got it up. Thanks. 
,JamJulLison,2012-05-30T20:57Z,I take back what I said about thank you. I downloaded this. Went to watch it and I can't. Had the same problem with one of your other hd vids.  I think something may have gone wrong in the encoding process. I would just reencode this myself but I can't even get my converter to recognize it.  I suggest testing all your vids after you encode them to ensure they work.

VLC wouldn't work when I tried it. Neither would media player classic with the k-lite codec pack. The file seemed corrupted. I couldn't even load it with any of my video converters.  I am going to attempt to download it again just to see if perhaps he has reuploaded a fixed version of this since then. Though I won't hold my breath on it working. "
,JamJulLison,2012-06-11T21:32Z,Also about your comment about windows players.  This here shows your lack of knowledge. I said Media Player Classic.  That is not Windows Media Player. Lots of people use it.  Anymore it is used more then VLC by people.  Especially with a good codec pack like K-Lite.
,JamJulLison,2012-06-11T23:25Z,It is still acting up. Not sure how those who are claiming this is working are even able to play it. I know it isn't my media player classic or vlc though. Handbrake won't even read it. 
,Racoon,2012-08-15T22:35Z,"@despo1ler can you upload a link on where to get all the episodes of you without having to search them,, not one link the link of the torrents  all of the season 2 HD like this one please"
