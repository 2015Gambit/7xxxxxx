,NexiumCore,2012-05-24T18:19Z,This application is not an updater. It is an archive of the original binary releases from Mojang.

,Menchii,2012-05-30T14:20Z,Thanks for this. I own Minecraft but they make it so hard to get older versions of the game.  I would like to try out some of the really old versions.  I started Minecraft in Beta 1.2.  I haven't finished downloading yet but I hope I can get the jars out of the program and have separate installations per version.  Yes I am a Minecraft addict.
