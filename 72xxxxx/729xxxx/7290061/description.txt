 Sandboxie runs your programs in an isolated space
 which prevents them from making permanent changes to
 other programs and data in your computer.

 This can be used for free, the major difference with the cracked version
 is you get 2 major features not available on the free version
 and there will be no windows nagging you to register after 30 days.
