Plot..........: Stefano, a young journalist, buys a used 
                typewriter and accidentally sees that some 
                text is still readable on the ribbon. He 
                manages to reconstruct the story of a scientist,
                Paolo Zeder, who in the 1950's discovered that
                some types of terrain have the power to revive
                the dead that are buried in them. Stefano's 
                investigations bring him in contact with a group 
                of renegade scientists that are still making 
                experiments to prove Zeder's theories. 


Notes.........: Former release was cut and also there are 
                several things about the picture.

                On the former release the picture looks
                grainy and washed out, it does have print damages, 
                several picture informations were missing 
                (seems cropped or matted). Also there are 
                10 seconds of music missing at the end.
