,SheikYerbouty,2012-05-24T23:18Z,"Just downloaded, started watching it and stopped after 15min because I'm sure there is much better.
This is not a rip! The guy played the movie in quicktime (proof in the first seconds) and used a screencast software to record his screen. The result is you lose a lot of sharpness and 'frame skipping' is now hardcode for you pleasure. The skipping is happening because his Mac is not able to cope with the load, playing a movie fullscreen while recording the screen.
He should buy a beter PC or he could actually rip the dvd as the title says. If you rip, even low end PC's could produce hight quality rips. Not this crap.

'A' for effort, 'F' minus for execution."
