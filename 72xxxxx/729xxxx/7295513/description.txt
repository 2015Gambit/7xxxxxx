I mainly upload programs from BBC1/2/4, that will only appeal to a few viewers.
 
I do most seeding overnight, so I have no way of knowing how many take downloads, I have to depend on feedback to know whether I should continue uploading. And whether the quality of the uploads is good enough.
 
So please take a little time to leave some feedback on The Pirate Bay, TPB. 
 
And please keep seeding !!
