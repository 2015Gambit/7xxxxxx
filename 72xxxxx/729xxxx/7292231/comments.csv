,FRivera,2012-05-25T18:26Z,aw c'mon lice-m some TSs are almost like a dvd copy I'm betting this is sht quality (no disrespect to the awesome scenebalance) why don't you rate it on an overall scale so that it's clearer what the quality is. example v2 a2 or v4 a4. my humble op is that it'd be more informative.
