Polena Records is proud to present the new Gaiatech release!

This new album represents an experiment, a search of new sound dimensions. A fresh psychedelic progressive sound, with reggae/dub and minimal/techno influences, in a range between 121 and 130 bpm, with deep basses and crunchy sinths, addition of arps, sinthetic dub voices and gated melodic arrangements. A must to put in the car and in the new style dj bag.
	
A new journey to the future of psychedelic progressive music. A meltin' pot experience around the globe of sounds. Enjoy the music!
