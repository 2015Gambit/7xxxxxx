,babybluetits24,2012-05-24T17:05Z,psspss im told theres no point using peerblock if we use a vpn as utorrent automatically blocks ip's sending fake data so do we need peerblock/peerguardian ?
[V],psspss,2012-05-25T01:43Z,"you always need peer block.. you dont want bad people connecting and seeing more stats then you want too..

and hows a vpn meant to stop bad chunks? all it does is change your ip and encrypts the data being sent.. doesnt stop the data being bad thats send

think about it"
[V],psspss,2012-05-25T02:17Z,"VPN only gives you a IP where the vpn server is located.. people still send the data to it where it encrypts it and sends on to your pc. it has no way in knowing if the data is bad from a faker.

what they are saying is if using VPN.. you dont need to worry about blocking cos IP has changed.. but that not true.. you want to block bad people and data in any way possible :)"
