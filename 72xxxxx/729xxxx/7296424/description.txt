Crystal clear psychedelic beats, individual acoustic samples mixed with fantastic Goa Trance melody make this album a real treat for everyone who likes a diverse mix of what's.

The development of electronic music in the mid 90's has been clearly shaped by a lot of Uk based artists, amongst them Dejavoo (Francesco Mura/Plastic Vibe and Kristian Vinales) and their constant influence in shaping the sound of Trance and Psychedelic Trance.

After 2 Album releases on the legendary Transient label, Dejavoo presents his new offering 'Defiance', a full length Album and milestone in the world of psychedelic movement.
