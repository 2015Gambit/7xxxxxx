,disnfab,2012-05-23T21:30Z,"I forgot to give credit for the files, so I would like to say thanks to DaysOfOurLivesFan28-or-29 from YouTube."
[T],jmanwf,2012-05-24T10:04Z,Thanks for that mate itunes a crap thanks for helping me out
,SoWErA3,2012-05-24T12:52Z,It's clearly DaysOfOurLivesFan28 that should have the credit since he uploads 2 days before 29 and 29 is probably same user just second account in case youtube feels like deleting just my guess ;)
,disnfab,2012-05-24T13:06Z,"jmanwf: no problem, but you don't have to thank me. Your uploads are more than enough. I will try to help out again if it's needed or possible.

SoWErA3: You are right, but I didn't take any chances because I felt bad for not giving credit sooner."
