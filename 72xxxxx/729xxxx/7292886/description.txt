One of our local farmers Oni Boa is appearing on the BBC2 Landward, Scotlands farming and countryside program tonight, Friday 18th May at 7.oo p.m. Oni was interviewd by the program earlier this month, so weΓÇÖre all very excited to see more awareness about the local famning community on the Isle of Mull being brought into the media spotlight.


I mainly upload programs from the BBC, that will only appeal to a few viewers.
 
I do most seeding overnight, so I have no way of knowing how many take downloads, I have to depend on feedback to know whether I should continue uploading.
And whether the quality of the uploads is good enough.
 
So please take a little time to leave some feedback on The Pirate Bay, TPB.
