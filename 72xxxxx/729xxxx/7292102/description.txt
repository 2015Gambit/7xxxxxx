Whether singing or toasting, Charlie Chaplin is one of reggae's most versatile performers. This CD includes a clever reggae adaptation of an old B.B. King tune retitled "Singin' the Blues" and a less successful cover of Hammer's "U Can't Touch This" called "Don't Touch Crack." Chaplin also offers a take on James Bond with "License to Kill," his thoughts on contemporary romance with "Modern Girl" and some other notions on life and love. His vocals and interaction with backup singers are engaging, while his verbal quips are often thoughtful and catchy.
