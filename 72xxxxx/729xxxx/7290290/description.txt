Excerpt from Amazon UK's review by Paul Tonks:

"The Matrix Reloaded soundtrack comes on two discs packed
to the gills with as much diverse entertainment as
possible. There are trailers for the movies, The Animatrix
and the video game; there are bonus songs apparently
inspired by the movie; and, as if that weren't enough, they
even found space for music featured in the film. Despite
the glaringly overdone all-markets marketing gloss, the
good music, thankfully, really is worthwhile."
