2-on the second screen choose the big button down right

3-when the game starts go to option 3 then change options 1,3,4

,maryanne007,2012-07-03T22:17Z,"Okay, I have a bit different problem. I tried ACRSP.exe, ACRPR.exe, and AssassinsCreedRevelations.exe, and only the last worked. I downloaded some kind of update for the 1.0 and 1.1 version, but this one is a 1.3 so it can't be installed. After all I aborted the session cause the program did nothing and when I clicked on AssassinsCreedRevelations.exe again it started all over again. I tried to start the other 2 exes too, but nothing happened. At last when I tried to start UbiLauncher I had an error and the sotware asked me to try to start the game instead. Please, help! What should I do?"
