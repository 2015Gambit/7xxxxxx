,reconite,2012-05-26T17:11Z,"All but centipede are the real deal, studio quality from upcoming EP. Could you not get your hands on the real version? Either way, thanks a lot. :D"
,Thyrai,2012-05-26T22:44Z,"No, sorry. It hasn't been released yet, so finding leaks has been an interesting challenge.  I suspect we'll have a bunch of real versions on the 28th though!"

Use the other upload for this torrent. This one's the leak that I found a few days before the album came out, and Centipede isn't finalized. Thanks!"
