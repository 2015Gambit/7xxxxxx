Volume is very low."
,buddahsu,2012-05-25T07:20Z,"@sporo
Audio is usually not very good on YIFY's releases; instead he sacrifices it to make EXTREAMLY small HD.
I personally love his versions over other because it's a much faster download (20minutes usually), but I wouldn't recommend it for an audio freak."
,concord72,2012-05-25T07:44Z,"GREAT AS ALWAYS YIFY, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!

,ILPB,2012-05-25T09:23Z,"@ buddahsu

You are absolutely right about the audio part in YIFI releases, But i wish it could be improved a little bit. I love YIFI releases but i don't like it when i have to turn on the volume to 100%.

Anyways, i'll keep downloading YIFI movies ;)"
,sipthe69er,2012-05-25T15:38Z,fuck i just jizzz in ma pantS!!

,heyyouguys,2012-05-25T22:26Z,"@eeeemir  dictator still in theaters, yify only does bluerays

@ILPB  still in theaters, yify only does bluerays

@joycedebs95 once there are bluerays available the rips will come, give it a few more months."
,Shadow416,2012-05-26T00:00Z,"to be honest, this was a good movie, i hate shaky camera work (like..during action scenes the camera shakes all over the place, stupid as hell).

The subtitles were legit useless, didn't make sense, and didn't even tell you what they were saying in foreign languages, it would just say (speaking in foreign language) LOL....

Ryan Renalds did great, for once"
,arnold_al_qadr,2012-05-26T03:09Z,"i'm sorry, but why mp4??"
,Snakesmash81,2012-05-26T04:11Z,"Excellant copy!!!  Thank You Yify!!!!

V-10
A-8

,Starcrossed49,2012-05-26T04:31Z,"Good Movie. 
The volume I guess is low to save file size, but I don't mind that. The file size is f'ing awesome. Thanks. "
,nuraishida,2012-05-26T14:55Z,"hey yify, can u upload Operation Endgame

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1268987/

,concord72,2012-05-26T21:08Z,"im always able to download at 1.0 MB/s or higher with YIFY, always a pleasure man!"
,sporo,2012-05-26T23:58Z,"@buddahsu

I am a big fan of YIFY ups (thanks BTW), but it seems like the audio on more recent uploads are a lot lower and unbalanced. 

I had to adjust the volume up and down in order to hear the conversations, then to avoid blowing out speakers during action scenes."
,amagg87,2012-05-27T04:11Z,"Yify, you have the best selection around! When i put these on my external hard drive, half the movies come up with audio codec not found? they work great on my computer, just not on my TV... anyone know how i can fix this?"
,MasslV,2012-05-27T07:24Z,"Sound volume tip for Windows users:

Turn on Windows loudness equalization. For films instant mode is ok, but for music set it to slow (instant off).

Use the Google..."
,Razhan,2012-05-27T10:35Z,"Thanks Alot Yify U r Awesome !!! 

Plz Upload The Dictator , SOON"
,CrAcKeZ,2012-05-27T21:43Z,"@robotbountyhunter mkv is WAY superior container than any other

of course you need probably a computer to play it, but convert it and don't be an ass about it

P.S. mkv has many extra features like, putting 2 or more audio channels, put many many subs and all that in one mkv container!"

,sqzinn,2012-06-07T05:24Z,"@amagg87

Check which audio codecs are supported for your TV. MP4 are generally encoded on AAC or DTS audio codecs."

,SerSpec-V,2012-06-15T06:12Z,I usually don't have a issue with the Audio with YIFY rips but this has the worst sounding audio of any YIFY movie I have seen. 
,PauloFran,2012-06-21T09:04Z,"Excellent video quality.
