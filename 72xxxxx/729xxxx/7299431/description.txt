This text presents the fundamentals of criminal investigation and provides a sound method for reconstructing a past event (i.e., a crime) based on three major sources of information - people, physical evidence and records. More than a simplistic introductory text, yet written in an easy-to-read, user-friendly format, it offers a broad approach to criminal investigation.

    Dozens of photographs, graphics, table, charts and diagrams supplement the text.
    A glossary elaborates on terms found in the text, gathered into one handy reference.
