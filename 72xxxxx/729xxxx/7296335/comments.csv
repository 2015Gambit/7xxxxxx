I m having some bad news right now... due to brein blokking TPB here in the netherlands I have to start using mirrors. ATM i have jet to find a mirror that lets me log in AND lets me upload what my current one is stopping me from thanks to a verification code not showing up "
,dusanng,2012-06-01T07:01Z,"Hello Ichiroyoung,
I really appreciate your torrents, so thanks. Have you tried hotspot shield? It changes your ip adress to american ip adress. It's free program. Read about it on internet, that's how i go on TPB because it's also blocked in my country ."
