.: Plot :.
The odds were stacked against Ramon (Manuel Lozano) from the start. He was always an outsider, and to keep himself sane, he lived by a strict mantra: Don't Fight, Don't Snitch and Don't Cry.

When his family settles in Seville, Ramon becomes victim to the attention of the school's most notorious crowd. As the death of dictator Franco sends shockwaves throughout Spain, the hairline cracks of rebellion and independence begin to appear.

A budding romance, a covert Religion teacher and a mythical Native Indian all collide in Ramon's world as he ultimately learns that one of the most important and enduring things in life is true friendship.
