[V],GunningHawk90,2012-05-23T18:07Z,"If you check Wiki, it tells us, that Astonishing X-Men always ignores major story arcs of the Marvel universe. So, it doesn't really matter whether this is before AvX or after it."

[T],MrDowntown,2012-05-23T21:43Z,They should say that for some of the DC titles... Just ignore that whole relaunch thing :D
