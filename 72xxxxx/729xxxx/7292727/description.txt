Lord Rama's life is one of perfect adherence    
to dharma (righteousness) despite harsh tests   
of life and time. Sri Rama Rajyam movie         
explains how poet Valmiki, the author of the    
epic Ramayana narrates the script in general.   
The movie further showcases the incidents in    
Lord Rama's life and how his journey goes on    
after he saves Sita from Raavana and also       
highlights the main principle's of Ramayama     
and Lord Rama i.e. How An Ideal Son, An Ideal   
Brother, An Ideal Husband and An Ideal Emperor  
should be. The film starts with the arrival of  
Rama and Sita to Ayodhya after vanquishing      
Ravan in Lanka. Rama is now the king of Ayodhya.
Under his rule the people are happy and         
prosperous. Just when everything seems to be    
going fine, a comment by a washer man makes Rama
to send Sita away into the forest. From here the
real story of Sri Rama Rajyam begins.
