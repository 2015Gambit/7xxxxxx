,Ozdl,2012-05-24T10:49Z,"Unpacking a rar too hard for you, kelethin?  If you don't appreciate sceneline's excellent uploads then go somewhere else, you shit.  Don't shout ""fake"" when you don't know a file from your arse, dickhead.
Thanks as always, sceneline.  I have appreciated being able to get the entire series in true HD."
[V],spastik64,2012-05-24T13:38Z,"LOL with people saying ""fake"". How a VIP user would upload a fake ? really ?

Scene groups (DIMENSION, IMMERSE etc) release shows with .rar and sample. Some uploaders unrar it before upload and others no, but is same file, and it works same!!

Learn about scene."
,Ozdl,2012-05-24T14:00Z,"Well said, spastik64.  I just get really annoyed at people who show no gratitude for the efforts of uploaders yet never upload anything themselves.  I have always appreciated your uploads as well, spastik64.  Keep 'em coming!"
