The second album from Osakan, Antarctica EP is a bridge between the guitar-based ambient music of his debut album, Music For Astronauts, and the synthesizer-heavy drone of the forthcoming follow-up album. Musical influences and points of vague similarity include: Aidan Baker, Stars of the Lid, Hammock, Loscil, and Casino vs. Japan.
