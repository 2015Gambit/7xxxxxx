,Canastos,2012-05-25T22:06Z,"Diet Soda should is available in installous (iOS).
I dont cracked any version of Coda xD I only shared with us :D

Coda is not compatible with any version previous to Lion OS X :/ Sorry..."
,Canastos,2012-05-25T22:22Z,"I was wrong. Coda if it supports 10.6.6 and higher ... Rarely, people who have the same version that you also do not work ... :/ Sorry I can not help you...:S"
,lipe_009,2012-05-28T23:36Z,"Coda isn't in installous (yet).

Could someone cracked it?"
,Viduus,2012-05-31T07:57Z,"Hmm, removed previous demo version of Coda2 with appcleaner, double checked for any lingering files. Tried to run this and application becomes unresponsive, bouncing leaf and spinning rainbow :(. Running Lion 10.7.4"
,Capic,2012-06-05T18:40Z,iCloud? Like I'm stupid enough to give my Apple password to a cracked app.
,maximocozzetti,2012-06-06T00:54Z,"you shouldn't give a non-cracked app your apple id password neither, apps use APIs to access iCloud. Coda or any serious app won't ask you your apple id password"

,pevensie,2012-07-04T02:21Z,"When i install this, it works in 15mins then it says that the trial period is over and want me to buy the software or close it. What have I done wrong?
( i did not have any coda installation before, OS X 10.7.2 )"
,nirrek,2012-07-26T04:55Z,"I am getting the same problem as @pevensie. Coda 2 will eventually give you an error saying that the trial period is over. Eg. I installed it 5 June, and today I can only use it for 15 mins before Coda prompts me that the trial period is over. It gives me options to either buy the program or quit. Auto-updating was disabled and I haven't manually updated in any way. I'm running OS X 10.7.4"
