Audio Sucks!!!"
,marcusn,2012-06-19T13:34Z,"@phasar - of course the quality is bad.

R5 movies differ from commercial releases that you might buy in stores in that they are usually a direct Telecine transfer of the film without any image processing and without any special features. This allows the film to be released for sale at the same time that DVD Screeners are released."
