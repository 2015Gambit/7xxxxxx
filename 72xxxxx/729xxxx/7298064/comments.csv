,ALuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,2012-05-25T19:45Z,"Worst movie EVER! OMG I was like forwarding the whole movies to the Ghost Rider scenes and even those where fucking bad.

The director and scripter should be fucking hanged and Cage should quit the fucking role..

They've killed Ghost Rider twice, idk how much he can handle but I hope than in the near future some brilliant man will remake this project into a sparkling gem.. "

,wizzard4all,2012-05-25T23:04Z,"@Aluuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
I have to laugh when someone like you comes on here to put down a movie. Who the hell ARE you? Are you a famous reviewer? Have you made your own blockbuster movies? WHY should we listen to YOU?
Perhaps instead of running down other people's hard work, you should see a psychiatrist about that Superiority Complex of yours........"

,pilot234,2012-05-26T02:26Z,"@Wizzard4All- Actually, the real cunt here is you. Aluuuu only stated his opinion and a review of the movie. Last time I checked, that was allowed. And btw, who the FUCK are you, some sort of Internet police? You worthless piece of dogshit, go rave about your menstrual cramps elsewhere.
Unless you're related to the Director or you're Nicholas Cage himself, STFU and GTFO!

,ratm11,2012-05-26T11:12Z,"@wizzard4all
so you have to be someone famous or be apart of a ""BLOCKBUSTER"" movie to have an opinion about a film? can you honestly give any of the morons running hollywood any credit for anything other than cycling out shitty movies one after the other like its a joke? dont give people shit for speaking their minds even if its a little harsh at times. and if your going to stand behind and defend something, make it something that matters. not the idiot crooks running hollywood.


p.s. go fuck yourself."

,ALuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,2012-05-26T15:12Z,"Most of the movie was made in my country, that was their first mistake even though I should be somehow proud of this?!

@wizzard, I just shared what all famous reviewers said with my own words. Just warned everyone about how bad this is and how, finally imdb got this right with their 4.1 rank.

If you can't tell how bad this is then my friends.. you lack something.."

,nclokieg,2012-05-29T01:28Z,"I really don't care about folks opinions of the movie...I want a quality download and comments on the quality of the upload.  The rest is just backround ""static & chatter"" that I have to put up with from mostly juvenille, racist, bombastic, and pontificating ass clowns.  I will use movie review sites and close friends to make determination of whether I want to see a movie.  And now I just added to the ""static and chatter"".  Sorry to the 90% of folks that use the service quietly and politely for adding to the noise.  Feel free to go ape-shite on this post...I couldn't care less...I won't waste my time checking back to see if my statement is popular or unpopular.  Oh cudos to the uploader...thanx man."
,stylerstar,2012-05-30T10:50Z,"Great quality. 10/10...
I would say it was a good film. Not as good as the first but still good. Looking forward to Ghost rider 3 :D"
,Phrozenjib,2012-06-01T11:59Z,"Gah Cinavia strikes again, fuck you Sony..."

,HenkzorBergz,2012-06-02T17:43Z,"Audio: 6Â˝/10
Video: 9/10

The quality of the video is fine, but it seemed a little hefty at times.
The audio was gritty and unsatisfying. Perhaps it would be better with a different sound-setup.

Overall, a descent download... NOT the best I've seen, but fully watchable!"
,rolfosten,2012-06-03T17:01Z,"1 one was great.This was crap.
How the hell did they get Nicolas Cage to act in it ??Was he druged?"

,Biglite,2012-06-13T12:59Z,"Person shares his cynical opinion about people sharing their opinions. Neato.

And that ""it's"" doesn't need an apostrophe. Normally I wouldn't bother as I knew what you meant, but seeing as you tried to slight someone's intelligence in the same sentence, I just had to. "
,EastBayNut,2012-06-15T07:33Z,"I agree, Crap movie. Should have canceled it before it started."
,Video_Veg,2012-06-15T07:37Z,"Was not expecting much because of bad reviews here, but found it fun to watch with OK action effects; quality good too. Not too much drawn out 'human drama' scenes either; though it does have the manditory hostage situation required by federal decree."
,Chiitah,2012-06-16T20:19Z,"Guys - wizard4all has a point.  That point is that people come here looking for visual / audio data of how this copy/rip turned out.  Nobody is coming here to read movie reviews - and if they were they certainly wouldn't listen to a few lines of swears and some drunk mumbling about how some random pirate hated it because - in his own ""professional"" opinion, it was ""gay"".

People come here knowing exactly what the movie is and just want to hear comments on quality, not what you personally think about the movie itself.  So no, this absolutely is not the place to come and bash the movie.

Please keep your movie reviews to IMDB or some other site made to discuss the movie itself, here we just want to hear the quality of the rip.  This is common sense.  People come here looking for something that they know the details about already, they don't come here to decide if they want to see the movie or not they just need the specifics of the quality of this copy."
,R0tten,2012-06-22T16:45Z,"I love all the people bitching about how no one is interested in someone's opinion of the shit they torrent when it's no different than if someone gave their opinion on a product they got on Amazon, or an opinion on the seller whom they bought the product from.

Just shut the hell up and stop crying. I know I personally want to know if the content of the movie sucked because depending how many people say it does, I won't be pissed off if it does truly suck if I decide to download it anyway.

No one wants to realize that when people give A/V, they're opinions as well.

So stop crying, you fucking losers."
,deaderweterdog,2012-06-24T02:01Z,stupid wizardcuntass so you think only the director of the movie or nicolus cage should be alowd to coment on pirate bay about the quality of the movie that is shit brained stupid on so many levels and to all the other chat cops i know i cant spell worth a shit so no reason to tell me yo should still be able to figure out what the hell im saying

,armlocks101,2012-07-30T23:20Z,"Great, high quality rip. Thanks SaM. 

For those interested, it is Cinavia protected so you have to keep changing the time every 20 minutes so you can watch it.

As for the film itself, I'll add my two cents. I believe they've done Ghost Rider very poorly considering other great movies out of this genre. I liked the first one though friends didn't and I thought I would enjoy this one but I was a bit disappointed. It wasn't as bad as some are saying but it was far from the level it should have been. I mainly attribute this to the story being poorly written.  "
