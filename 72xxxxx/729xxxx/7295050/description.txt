Hi, 

Here i've gathered some of the most famos trumpet concertos with play along simphonic version as long as piano version.
Haydn and Hummel are with a simphonic orchestra accompaniment.
There is a piano version from Hummel and Haydn as well as (Hindemith, Arutunian, Bohme, Wieniavski tarantela) A Midi from the Brandemburg N2, paganini tarantella.
And some ridiculous version of Carnaval from PARIS with accordeon acoompaniment (which sound a lot like the carnaval from Venice :D )

Hope you like this torrent :)
Enjoy
