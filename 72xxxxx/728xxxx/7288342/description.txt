QM 08 - Leptons

The Tetryonic [12pi] equilateral geometry resulting from similarly charged fascia in Fermions in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The repulsive geometries formed by Matter quanta as it forms Fermion Matter through quantum mechanical interactions are revealed.

With elemental Tetryonic charges of [-12,0,+12] a geometric foundation is paved for the understanding of Lepton geometries and their role in macroscopic  Matter for the first time in recorded history.

An updated version of the eight chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Leptronic geometries.
