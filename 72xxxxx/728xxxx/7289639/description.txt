Narratives:

Bad Veins' sophomore effort The Mess We've Made, vocalist and principal songwriter Benjamin Davis sets the tone almost immediately: This album is most definitely a break-up record. Opener "Don't Run," which ostensibly serves as the title track, is a soaring, sugary pop smash that's equally as potent, if not more so, than anything the duo wrote on the self-titled. "Don't Run," is followed by the equally strong "Nursery Rhyme," a layered affair that's also probably one of the band's strongest to date. 

As a whole, The Mess We've Made is a more sweeping and majestic album ("Chasing" and "Doubt" for example). But for all its arena-ready moments, there's a good dose of simple, understated gems ("I Turn Around,","Kindness."). Bad Veins' strength is vocalist Davis, whose timbre and utterances have a way of making each song sound sincere and authentic. His yearning and pleading is easy to relate to and one gets the feeling his songs actually stem from real life experiences.
