,theo23rd,2012-05-22T19:33Z,Will someone else besides me please seed this torrent? I'm getting zero download and it would be nice if someone in the 55 leechers who is eating my bandwidth would reciprocate.
,slasherman,2012-05-22T20:14Z,be patient

it was hard as hell to get 1-6 considering how slow my internet connection is

thank you"
[V],rr-ne,2012-06-01T08:31Z,"slasherman, what other Food Network shows do you like?

i really like watching this, Chopped, Diners drive-in and dives, and Unwrapped"
,slasherman,2012-06-01T12:44Z,I have not seen all of them but I really liked Dinner Impossible
,merckkk,2012-06-19T06:32Z,Thanks for uploading this. Any chance you'll be uploading ep 11-13 (or any other newer ones) ? I wonder if the network takes it as a bad sign if a show isnt popular enough to be easily found as a torrent ;)
,slasherman,2012-06-24T19:36Z,i got 11-13 ...is that the rest of season 3 or will it be more after summer?
,slasherman,2012-06-24T19:40Z,i looked at the website and it looks like 13 is the end of season 3...so I will upload it soon
