Also, I would like to state none of us have to go to war.

I know WW3 seems pretty close.

But theres more humans than leaders.

We dont have to do what the leaders demand.

I say spread the word to all humans.

That war should come to an end by not enrolling in no army.

Lets teach our sons this new way of living.

I am in America and do not aprove of the war.
