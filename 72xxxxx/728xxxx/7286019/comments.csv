A - 10/10
V - 8.5/10
I would rather go for HDTV x264 release. That has more clear video."
,CristopherHD,2012-05-21T17:24Z,Your gonna release HDTV 720p x264 or not?
,SCSA420,2012-05-21T19:03Z,Well I have also done a 720p version and tried to upload it here 20 minutes after the show was over but the TPB was down for me in the USA from 11:15 pm - 6:00 am EST and I couldn't upload it here. I even tried using numerous proxies from around the world but none would work for uploading it. So I gave up on this place which can't even keep themselves operating properly anymore like they used to be able to. IF you want my WWE Over The Limit PPV 2012-05-20 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH version I am uploading it on the usenet at alt.binaries.pro-wrestling and my release also includes the Pre-show as well in 720p.
