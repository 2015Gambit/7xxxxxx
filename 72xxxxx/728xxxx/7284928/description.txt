Plant field guides.  This torrent includes all the books in Nature Field Guides #1, with many additions and some improved versions.

UtahWildflowers and grassGenera are html books, so you'll need to unzip the file in those directories to expand all the files.  Note that grassGenera is broken into two pieces - the html files (small) and the image files (almost 400 MB).  You can skip the image files if you have limited bandwidth or disk space.

If you find a book useful, please support the author, especially for the small-scale and self-publishing authors!

You can see titles and authors of all the included books in the file NatureFieldGuide#3.txt
