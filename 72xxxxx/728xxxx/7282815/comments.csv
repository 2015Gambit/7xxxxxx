,maliboo1,2012-05-27T03:24Z,"TS (Telesync):

A telesync has the same specs as a CAM, except it uses an external audio source (most likely an audio jack in the chair for hard of hearing people). A direct audio source does not ensure a good quality audio source, as a lot of background noise can interfere. A lot of the times a telesync is filmed in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a professional camera, giving a better picture quality. Quality ranges drastically, check the sample before downloading the full release. A high percentage of Telesyncs are CAMs that have been mislabeled."

,claiho,2012-06-13T07:37Z,"Video a bit blurry, audio fine. Quality good for a cam, but not so great for TS.

Watchable, but not so great.
