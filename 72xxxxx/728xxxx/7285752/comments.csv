,SULTAN_201,2012-05-21T16:26Z,"is there a 550 xvid avi release ???

or i should just download this !!"
,cinemaniac905,2012-05-21T17:11Z,"this is an absolutely garbage rip, AFG you suck. 

we need PROPER rippers, this should be ripped with same fps and AR but to 700mb....even 550 would be pretty small for GOT because it is so dark."
,cinemaniac905,2012-05-21T17:12Z,this looks shitty on my laptop....will look really horrible on standalone.
,WoundedWolfgirl,2012-05-21T18:29Z,Thank you so much for the avi!
,BuzzDave,2012-05-21T19:06Z,"Nice rip and not too small too bad there always some bitch who wines like cinemaniac095, if you don't like it why not rip it yourself instead of complaining, it free after all and AFG took the time to rip this for us I can't say the same about you."
,STAY-AT-HOME-GAMER,2012-05-21T20:39Z,Thanks for avi up load
,mojowoikin,2012-05-21T22:55Z,"Thanks ettv! I appreciate the rip and upload. The quality seems perfectly OK to me viewing on a 22"" computer screen. And it's free! 

@ cinemaniac095 - Read the descrip. This is an XviD (AVI) If you want BRay quality then download it. I can see from your uploads - oh wait!! You don't have any??? Then who the fuck are you to be telling ettv, or anyone, how to rip, and to act like a fucking dickhead when you do it?? "
,Hipolytos,2012-05-21T23:13Z,"thanks for the xvid/avi, now I can see it on my ps3"
