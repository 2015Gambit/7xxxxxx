,Kraize_FuCkEr_80,2012-06-03T21:50Z,Seriously! 23 files? Do you really need 23 files for something like this? Don't make torrents if you don't know what you are doing. Please remove the files that aren't NEEDED.

""Subtitles included: Arabic, Chinese, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English, Farsi, French, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Portuguese-Brazilian, Romanian, Serbian, Slovenian, Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese.""

It's also included  in the description !!
Right in front of your eyes!

If you don't know to read or how to see what is the content of the torrent you really have to learn. 

Not for me! I don't care. For me you don't exist Kraize_FuCkEr_80.

Have a nice day,  as nice as you intended  to do it for me.
