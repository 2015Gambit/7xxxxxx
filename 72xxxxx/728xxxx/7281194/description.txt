   Infamous 2005 US Grand Prix.  2 hours 21min. ITV F1 Sport broadcast. James Allen, Martin Brundle, Mark Blundell, Ted Kravitz... Interviews with DC, JB, MW, Bernie, Christian, Ross... Actually quite interesting. Last year of the 3.0L V10.

   This is a rework of Superbird426's/LOL's upload. I really wanted to see this however CD1 would not open due to an "index problem". Repaired CD1 (Repair Video Master 2.62), joined CD 1 and 2 (VirtualDub), re-coded (Handbrake)... Video has some -AUDIO SYNC PROBLEMS-. Seems to Vary between +100ms and +750ms. Currently beyond my abilities to fix.

   I'll initial seeding at 100kB/s, afterwards maintain at 10kB/s. Please help seed.

   Thanks should go to the original uploader and the single part time seeder that kept his torrent alive.
