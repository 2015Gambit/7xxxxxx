QM 02 - The geometry of ENERGY

The equilateral geometry of mass-ENERGY behind Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Expounding  on the quantised equilateral geometry of mass-ENERGY a geometric understanding of quantised mass-ENERGY is achieved.

Applying it to the physical concepts of mass-ENERGY and EM fields a quantum geometry of ENERGY arises along with its relationship the ΓÇÿSpeed of EnergyΓÇÖ, providing a  for the first time a view of the true quantum geometry that underpins classical & relativistic mechanics.

An updated version of the second chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to equilateral quantised mass-ENERGY geometries.
