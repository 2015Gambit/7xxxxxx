The Paranormal 5: a team of investigators whose aim is to prove ΓÇô or disprove ΓÇô the existence of paranormal activity. Together they visit various public and residential locations which have experienced unexplained occurrences and seemingly paranormal disturbances.

In each episode of the series, the Paranormal 5 check for logical explanations, running technical tests which detect fluctuations in temperature, and measuring electro-magnetic force with sensitive recording equipment. Their medium, Paul, then tries to connect with spirits.

Through long journeys of intrigue, investigation, tears and laughter, the team uncover some remarkable tales from the past, such as the fate of a pregnant maid murdered by her employer, a young boy trapped up a chimney, and an entire family killed by TB.  Believers will find it irresistible; sceptics must watch and judge for themselves.
