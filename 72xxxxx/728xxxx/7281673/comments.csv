rescue mediums is way better then this..

but good to hear some of the INN stories from guests staying in the old places of bed sheets being pulled off

they need some real paranormal investigators to do their places and stay in the rooms over night for 3 days :)

so on episode 2 he talks about her mom having cancer.. but in the end it wasnt confirmed if he was right or just another BS medium making up stuff"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-05-20T11:58Z,"im really loving this paranormal stuff u keep finding,cant wait to watch this one.although,i hope they dont start saying thank you after every little sound like the chic in the last ones"
[V],psspss,2012-05-20T12:09Z,"well almost gave up on it.. when watched episode 3

at least they got some hard evidence and less BS medium"
[V],psspss,2012-05-20T12:14Z,"
Note.. the middle of each episode you have to fast forward

as they left a blank bit in for editing for inserting ads being a
studio episode leak your see what i mean when watch it

the quality is amazing for a web rip though"
[V],psspss,2012-05-20T12:17Z,"no its not like taps..

they only show evidence if they find it.. 

they just set up trigger objects and sound recorders

i dont think they even use thermal or IR cams !

for 30min show with most of it for story and BS medium 

your see... for being 2008 UK.,, need to step up
how they do paranormal shows as they havent a clue..

irelands greatest haunts is the only show where they do a proper investigation.. more so in series 2 if not seen it.. grab it. (can be found on demon)"
