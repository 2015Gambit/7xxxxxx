Hello there, I've decided to upload my current Calibre Library for all of you!

Now a bit of backstory: All books have been collected over time obviously, some have been purchased by myself. The quality of the books have been looked over and fixed if necessary. I would say that 95% of what I have available are considerably close to or are retail value. Now there are some that may seem a bit off (Janet Evanovich, Sue Grafton in particular) because when I looked over them they were acceptable in the sense that they had a Table of Contents and the formatting was about right but they aren't fully complete. They don't have a copyright page or a "Thanks from the author" sort of pages etc.

The file itself: its one big folder but EACH and every author has been zipped so download the author as a whole and then unzip for the books for that author. I have included a "Book Catalog" which is in ePub format separate from the file itself that will hopefully encourage you to download the ENTIRE folder because if you open the "Book Catalog" in Calibre and view it, you will be able to see Authors and their books, the series' that are attached to their name, plus a description of each book. If your wondering though, MOST books included are up to date series wise. Some might have been mis-numbered (Agatha Christie) but they are still in order and what not.

Most of the books that I have in here are Mystery, Supense, Thriller. I have though included a couple of humor books, and fantasy books (Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia to name a few) but 99% of this upload is Mystery/Suspense/Thriller.

This is a BIG file so I would encourage each and every one of you who download this to download the full size of it. I will seed this for a while obviously so please help me out with your patience and persistence because there might be some hours where it dies because I have work and family duties where I have to shut down my computer
