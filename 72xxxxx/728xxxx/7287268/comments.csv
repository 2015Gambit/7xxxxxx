,999razor,2012-05-22T08:06Z,How about listing the books
,nas.ebooks,2012-05-22T11:19Z,"Thanks for your effort, but this torrent hangs at 32.3% downloading every time..."
,TxJag,2012-05-22T13:23Z,"@999razor There is a book listing its call ""Book Catalog by Calibre. Read my torrent description it gives enough detail about the books involved in the torrent.

@nas.books I just turned to torrent back on. I explained that it would die. I apologize for the delay. Family and work life take priority sometimes."

,TxJag,2012-05-24T19:11Z,"@Hodges53 Nope, they have to be released first and 15 Seconds isn't out till July and Survivor isn't even released till August so not yet."
,hodges53,2012-05-24T20:49Z,cheers thanks for looking my mistake i thought id seen them advertised
,TxJag,2012-05-24T23:05Z,"@Hodge53 you did haha, just as pre-orders. I hope what I have of Hurwitz will suffice for the moment though."
,kayz86,2012-05-25T01:11Z,"this is an awesome torrent, got books i been looking for 4 ages, thanks millions!!!"
,cur37ious,2012-05-25T01:37Z,"Excellent job, TxJag.  Exceptionally clean looking files, well groomed in Calibre.  Now that there are 67 seeders, folks (and there's sure to be no less than 10 or 12 for years to come), this d/l is a true gem for mystery/suspense readers."
,TxJag,2012-05-25T06:31Z,"Your all welcome for the quality, I aim to give top quality at all times. Remember, download the Book Catalog first, it will help with information on the books that are enclosed."
,zoebanks,2012-06-04T17:04Z,"Hello.

Do you know what has happened to Karaokeking123.  Someone has posted that he got busted by the FBI.  Do you know if this is true?"
,TxJag,2012-06-06T19:10Z,@zoebanks I have no idea. The same with bookeek. Me and bookeek collaborated on a few releases. Can you give me some info about this?
,Saints4Life,2012-06-13T12:01Z,Can you upload The Darren Shan Saga in ePub with good quality? I've been looking everywhere for it!
,TxJag,2012-06-13T17:37Z,@saints4life I'll see what I can find. No promises.
,Saints4Life,2012-06-14T08:11Z,Ok thanks man.
,nedand,2012-07-07T11:13Z,Thanks a lot!
,TxJag,2012-07-25T16:22Z,"I will be updating this over the weekend possibly. I've added almost 500 more books in 2 months. I should really get to reading some of them though haha. Some books from this one will be updated in the sense I had them, thought they were okay but they weren't and purchased them brand new."
,Jaymark_prs,2012-09-02T22:23Z,thank you sir!
,ithetruth,2012-09-16T00:23Z,"new to the ebook thing, but great stuff!!!! how do i seed??"
,TxJag,2012-09-16T17:34Z,@ithetruth just keep the torrent active once you get what you need (hopefully the WHOLE torrent).
