,TedDekker,2012-05-24T20:18Z,I was trying to download some of your older torrents but I think about 167 of them are down. I have a list of them but I could only post 1 page of them in the comments. Do you think you have re-posted a lot since then or they forever gone? 
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-05-26T00:02Z,"Lingerdog, I'll throw those up for you tonight. Stay tuned."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-05-26T00:04Z,"TedDekker - Many of those older torrents would be extremely difficult for me to breathe new life back into. I've upgraded bitrates for some of those albums, changed file names, etc. So sure, I still have them all. But to revive the old torrents would be a whole lot harder for me to do than simply creating new torrents at this point.

Was there something specific that you wanted to see?  You know me, I'll be more than happy to torrent anything and everything you want."
,truh8r,2012-05-26T04:33Z,"Hey thank you for this....loving what you have done thus far.  Do you have Smokie Norful and Stephen Hurd.  Also The hawkins family, and rev milton brunson and the thompson community singers.  That it LOL thanks for 2011 and 2012"
,TedDekker,2012-05-26T12:28Z,"Not at the moment. I think I pretty much have everything plus some of the older torrents I believe have came to life; a few here and there, only a handful are probably missing. I was just wondering if you repackaged them sometimes. I think the ones that are still dead are mostly 2nd Chapter of Acts, Apologetix, Big Tent Revival , Crystal Lewis, DC TALK, Jaci Velasquez, Mercy Me, Petra, Revival Generation, Rich Mullins, White Cross, and Winds of Worship. Some of these I am sure you have reseeded.

Thank You! For everything! High Five! "
,lingerdog,2012-05-27T20:57Z,Thank you so much! Awesome as always!
