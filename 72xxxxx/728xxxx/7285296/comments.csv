,nm_z,2012-05-25T18:47Z,I've got a bunch of people up to 97% with what I already had.  We just need like 1 or 2 seeders to get the rest.
,Reefman37,2012-05-25T19:46Z,"Yeah, I'm at 97.4% now, though it's showing 6 seeders on the tracker, but availability is showing 0.974. Hopefully I can get this last 2.6% and I'll be seeding for a good long while."
,jackiebooboo,2012-05-26T12:43Z,"Yooooo Scumbags. So, I'm the one who uploaded this torrent, but I really have no idea why it's getting stuck at 97.4%. As a test I tried downloading it myself, and it did the same thing to me. I'm no torrent expert. This is actually the first one I've ever uploaded. If anyone more knowledgeable than myself can let me know what's wrong, I can try to fix it. My apologies...."
,Reefman37,2012-05-29T02:32Z,"Yeah, don't know what's happening. Currently there are 10 seeders, but I'm stuck at 98.1% along with pretty much everyone else. I'm glad there are a handful of people who have finished, I just hope that the rest of us get a chance to finish it as well."
,Skline494,2012-05-30T01:32Z,Glad to see it wasn't just me that got stuck 98.1%
,Reefman37,2012-06-04T23:53Z,"Come on people, seed. Still stuck on 98.1%. I've seen as many as 13 seeders, and now there are only 2. I'm currently connected with 15 our 44 other peers also at 98.1%. "
,Reefman37,2012-06-14T16:55Z,"What's the problem here people? 10 days later, still at 98.1%. What do you have against seeding?"
