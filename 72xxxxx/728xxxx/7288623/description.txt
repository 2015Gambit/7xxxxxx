Show description:
Gastown Gamble is a docu-reality series following a group of idealistic Vancouver restaurant owners, lead by Mark Brand and his wife Nico, on their quest to make an impact on the neighbourhood known as ΓÇ£CanadaΓÇÖs poorest postal codeΓÇ¥: VancouverΓÇÖs downtown east side. 

By re-opening the neighbourhood icon, a butcher shop known as "Save On Meats", they hope to provide opportunities to the unemployed and disadvantaged members of the community and inspiration to others. It would be a huge undertaking for someone who has experience revitalizing a downtrodden community, but for Mark, Nico and the gang it may be more than they can handle.
