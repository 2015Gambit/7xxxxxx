Get the 6.60 update from here:

Update the PSP then download 6.60PRO-B10 fix1 and install it

When i tested these files on all my hacked PSP's the licence files I didnt know you needed were still on the memory stick so they worked. If it is safe to upload these files without getting b& from PSN I will. sorry for the inconvenience.
TL;DR You need License files for these to work try goggling for them or I will upload mine if they don't have account info in them."
