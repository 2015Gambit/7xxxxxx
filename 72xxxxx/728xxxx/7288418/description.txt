QM 14 ΓÇô Quantum Kinematics

The equilateral geometry behind Classical Kinematics and mathematics developed by Sir Isaac Newton and illustrated using the geometry of Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter].

The geometry of momenta as the geometric SQUARE ROOT of ENERGY is revealed.

Inertial frames of reference and new geometric views of common kinematic equations are revealed (along with their geometric relationship to equilateral mass-ENERGY) for the first time in recorded history.

An updated version of the fourteenth chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - 
The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as a bridge between the classical kinematic formulas and Tetryonic mass-ENERGY momenta geometries in the Science of the new millennia.
