It just seems that the magnet links take a long time (sometimes a day) to talk to my seedbox. I don't know why this is !?
Please remember that I when I publish a torrent at that point it starts to be uploaded to my seedbox

This is not an advert, I'm just trying to help plus I watched some poor sod trying to download via a magnet at 0.9 kBs and someone dowloading at 11MB/s via pod-zone.

Anyway only a thought, Have a good one mateys :)
