,amoulak,2012-05-21T03:07Z,"The Japanese troops responded to Chinese resistance to their invasion by embarking on an orgy of murder, rape, and looting that shocked the civilised world at that time, although it has now been largely forgotten in many Western countries where the rigorous teaching of history is becoming a neglected discipline.let's remember the victims of Japonese crimes during ww2."

,Sharak,2012-05-28T08:59Z,"This movie makes me want to kill myself. I want to go back in time and give my life to save these courageous selfless women.  This was a good, but sad, film. The war in Nanking was real, and the Japs ran around raping young girls and when they were done they would slice them open with their bayonets.  I am glad that US dropped not 1 but 2 nuclear bombs on Japan."
