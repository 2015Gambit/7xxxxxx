DESCRIPTION:

The book presents a new science of semiotic linguistics. The goal of semiotic linguistics is to discover what characterizes language as 
an intermediary between the mind and reality so that language creates the picture of reality we perceive. The cornerstone of semiotic linguistics is the 
discovery and resolution of language antinomies contradictions between two apparently reasonable principles or laws. Language antinomies constitute 
the essence of language, and hence must be studied from both linguistic and philosophical points of view. The basic language antinomy which underlies 
all other antinomies is the antinomy between meaning and information. Both generative and classical linguistic theories are unaware of the need to 
distinguish between meaning and information. By confounding these notions they are unable to discover language antinomies and confine their research 
to naturalistic description of superficial language phenomena rather than be concerned with the quest for the essence of language.
