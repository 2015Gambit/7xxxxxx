,Vulgeek,2012-05-20T04:04Z,"Hey Daman4Iife, Great torrents first off, but I was wondering how people like you got this down to about 200 MB in size. Usually after the video is on TV the first uploads of 720p are off 600MB+. Do you convert the other uploads to a different format to make the overall size smaller? If so what do you use. Thanks :)"
,Ziggyxs,2012-05-20T04:10Z,Checking it out now! Thanks for the upload!
,jsniper34,2012-05-20T04:13Z,thanks so much!  really appreciate it!
,Rezeys,2012-05-20T04:23Z,Great as always man. +1
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-20T04:31Z,"vulgeek, i do not convert other peoples uploads, the first upload was up 9hours ago, and it only takes my computer 10mins to encode a 720p video.
i was super late this time because my stinking DVR mess up the file and Sony vegas,Adobe premiere were having some trouble, rendering."
,QborT,2012-05-20T05:15Z,"You always put these rips in the wrong section, they should be in the Highres>TV show section since they are 720p."
,Vulgeek,2012-05-20T05:17Z,"I was just wondering how you did it, I did not know you did it with a DVR. I was thinking about doing it with a HD TV tuner so I could record it as it is shown on TV. Anyway great upload (: was probably the first to download it xD. Thanks Daman4Iife."
,J0SH37,2012-05-20T06:26Z,"Please tell me how you make these videos such small file size with AMAZING quality, a 10 min video in 720p for me turns out at 1gb (I am new at this stuff)"
,J0SH37,2012-05-20T06:28Z,what are your sony vegas/adobe premiere settings? i really want to know how you make it such small file size
,Leiss,2012-05-20T10:38Z,gj man :)
,rikipy,2012-05-20T15:45Z,oh thanks i like u rips 
,rikipy,2012-05-20T15:53Z,"hey u can get the .ts from NickHD put on the MeGUI for encoding, and put in the x264 Setting DXVA_HD Cartoon HQ and get normally 250/300mb in 720p, and please dont use other software for encoding."
,KryptonautO,2012-05-20T16:19Z,"I've usually had really good experience downloading from you, but this one's video quality is actually kind of messed up when I play it on WMP at least"
,CombustionMan1,2012-05-20T16:57Z,Thank you for improving the audio quality. V10/A10 for me. Makes a world of difference. Takes the show from amazing to orgasmic. Is there any way you could upload all the earlier episodes with this quality? I would really appreciate it.
,lem0nade,2012-05-20T17:11Z,"I wait specifically for your ULs of this show because they are perfect, thanks a bunch"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-20T18:11Z,"kriptonat, for this episode i used High5.0 so winanp will have problems playing it. use VLC"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-20T18:12Z,"oops i mean dont use windows media player, that player is one of the most crappiest ever. 
Download VLC or MPC. anything else will do better than WMP"
,Wazabbi,2012-05-20T18:17Z,"Fantastic as always, thanks!"
,zafforrian,2012-05-20T20:49Z,Spot on thx
,williamvirkis,2012-05-20T21:41Z,Yeah! What are the general settings you use to get this quality and this size? :D :D
,3htthe,2012-05-21T01:42Z,"V:10
A:9.5

Video is perfect, audio is perfect, but I've still heard a bit better. It's not noticeable unless you're as picky as me though. Best torrent on the internet. Thanks a bunch Daman, I appreciate it!"
,GodboyJamal,2012-05-21T01:53Z,"I have to admit Daman, I'm very impressed.  I don't know how you get the audio and video so right and it fits into so small a package, but well done.  If you need someone to help you seed early, holler at me."
,Orangefab,2012-05-21T03:17Z,"Daman, when I upload your video to iTunes and sync it, it has an error message that says the video cannot be sent to the iPod...idk all of your previous vids worked perfectly fine.  "
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-21T03:55Z,"orange fab, this wont work on an ipod, since it has 10Frames making it High lvl 5.0 instead of the usual 4.0. It break ipod compatibility, for the sake of the same size but more quality."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-21T17:47Z,"For those wondering what i use to REcord. I use a Black Magic Shuttle. Requires a Pc with at least 4Cores and it records in Loseless/Raw meaning the files are huge.
2mins=2GB "
,Orangefab,2012-05-22T02:58Z,"Daman, wait are you saying that it will work for iPod with a 5th gen?  Cuz I have 4th gen (w/ 5.1.1 iOS), or do you mean the quality is too great for the shitty iPod?"
,Vulgeek,2012-05-22T22:24Z,"Daman4Iife, So you only use the Shuttle for capturing TV? I'm guessing you might also use it to capture console gameplay, but besides that I have a question about the Shuttle. Does it act as a tuner? Like you can set the times of when it should record or not? I'm already guessing it does not from what I have read/seen about it. Do you sit at your computer with the TV input in the card and wait for the show to come up and hit capture as soon as it starts, I know with actual TV tuner cards you can set what shows and what times to record when not even being present at the computer. Just wondering thanks :D"
,Bahiyya,2012-05-23T19:31Z,Awesomeness!!
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-24T19:30Z,"Vulgeek your are correct, i have to wait till the show comes on and record, but either way the time thing wouldnt work for me since after recording it still needs to be edited to take out the Comercials and stuff"
,omersang,2012-05-27T02:53Z,Waiting for Episode 08. :D
,Orangefab,2012-05-27T02:56Z,"Lol daman, did you record the most recent episode? (8)"
,3htthe,2012-05-27T03:21Z,"Guys, Episode 8 hasn't even aired. Apparently its Memorial Day in the U.S. So Episode 8 is showing next week. Sorry guys."
,3htthe,2012-05-27T03:21Z,Memorial Day weekend** sorry
,felidae18,2012-05-27T16:12Z,Where's episode 8? :(
,FoDeyzZ,2012-05-27T20:17Z,Hey bro what are your specs? It seems you have a pretty nice PC.
,TheDogs96,2012-05-28T08:13Z,"Yo! Wonderful torrents from you; all are good in quality but packaged in a small file. How is it that you accomplish this?

I experimented around with Handbrake, trying to reduce the file size from ~500mb to ~300mb but when I try to reduce the file size by altering the bitrate to those of your videos (~1000kbps) the quality plummets.

Thanks for your wonderful torrents though, my request is for personal purposes :) Keep em up!"
,ShiroDream,2012-05-28T13:38Z,Guuuhh! Memorial Day?! I want to cry! I wish they just aired the next day and pushed Spongebob out of his time slot or something TT^TT
