,torrentlol,2012-07-23T23:11Z,"Hey. I have installed and its still in french. Altso the quality on the images that I'm creating are so bad quality, i am not sure if its just the CS6 or my PC, or the install that makes the quality that bad. I hope there is a fix for these two bugs. Like i can use photoshop cs6. Thanks."
,tezzilicious,2012-09-01T00:09Z,"I want to get it in Swedish, but I have read both help and comments but I do not really understand how to do. tw10428.dat where do you want it? Should I move it to the plug-in, or should I have left it where it is and just rename it to. bak as someone wrote earlier. Or am I completely in the wrong and will move it to App/PhotoshopCS6/AMT/sv_SE? Please help me as I would really like to get this!"
,pras92,2012-09-06T19:53Z,"@tezzilicious

You need not have to move the .dat file. Just rename it to .bak and leave it in its location.
But, If you have the folder as sv_SE you should be having it in swedish already.
What language are you getting now?"
,tezzilicious,2012-09-06T22:02Z,"Oh when I installed this, it was in French. I can not work in any other language. So therefore, I thought if the folder was wrong or was positioned wrong."
