Glad the hill has been dealt with!"
,Ginkmonk,2012-05-27T19:55Z,"Thanks a bunch, Salutations, you're a lifesaver! Do you by chance have the answers to the AAMC MCAT Test z however? Thanks again!"
,Salutations,2012-05-28T09:35Z,"Oh man, I'm sorry, I've tried looking around, couldn't find it. Sorry!"
,tamal25,2012-05-30T22:02Z,Salutations... THANK YOU SO MUCH!! You're a LIFESAVER! Will seed for a long long time!!!
,frozenx207,2012-05-31T23:57Z,Words cannot express my love for this.
,Brazilronaldo,2012-06-11T17:34Z,Does this have the Princeton review Verbal workbook?
,Salutations,2012-06-11T18:12Z,"Re-read the description.

""- Princeton Review Lecture Books (Phys Sci. + Bio)""

Another important note: The AAMC practice exams are in the previous MCAT format with phy sc - 100 mins, verbal - 85, bio - 100. I still believe their are helpful. Also, I'd recommend that you buy a couple AAMC practice exams from the AAMC website to see where you OFFICIALLY stand.  - Cheers."
,chaverta,2012-06-28T06:29Z,I am soooooo grateful for everything in this torrent- BUT: the EK 1001 chem is missing a chunk of page while 58-66 is repeated in its place- not sure if this is also in others- just noticed it in EK 1001 chem today: any chance you have these missing pages? Thanks!!
,Salutations,2012-06-29T04:48Z,"I'm still going through the material, thanks for the heads up. If it's not in the torrent, then I don't have it. =[ 

Oh well, if you really want to know those questions, just go down to chapters and sit down and do them and put the book right back. Hehehe."
,zagaman,2012-07-06T22:06Z,"This is amazing!  Salutations, you deserve a Nobel prize for this, or at least some sort of prize.  
One question, how do you use the content in the 10 week ExamKrackers Schedule?  I'm not very computer literate, so all I see in the folders are the java scripts, and when I open them all I see is the code.
Thanks again!"
,Salutations,2012-07-07T21:36Z,"@zagaman

You can find the files you need to open at the ""10 Week ExamKrackers Schedule"" folder. To answer your question, lets use Week 2 as our week. Just go to the FILE named Week 2 and open it in your internet browser. DO NOT try to open it from week 2_files."
,Salutations,2012-08-18T03:21Z,"UPDATE: when you're selecting the torrent and are waiting for the pop-up menu to show you the files within the torrent, just give it a couple minutes (THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THIS TORRENT IS SCREWED UP, BILL!!!!). It's just that this is a magnet link, which basically uses a peer to collect information about this torrent rather than TPB, and since the peer is using all of his/her bandwidth on the torrent, collecting such information will take some time."
,Salutations,2012-08-18T03:26Z,"My friend took the MCAT based off studying the material from this torrent. He wrote it July 6, 2012. He mentioned that, AND THIS IS FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW (IT PROBLY WILL OR WILL NOT WORK FOR YOU), EK stuff was great for setting up the foundations you need to approach the passages for physical and biological. He felt he got 10+ in both of'em. As for verbal, I gave him a hard copy of the EK ""MCAT 101 passages"" book (digital copy can be found here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4659811/ExamKrackers_101_Passages_in_MCAT_Verbal_Reasoning_Book) and he said that you should keep at a 8-9 minute/passage pace. However though, in the exam... he felt as if he got destroyed by the verbal reasoning, not even sure he got a 7. However, results aren't out yet and that 'bad' feeling in verbal is normal apparently. Bottom line is that, this torrent CAN'T really TEACH you or help you IMPROVE your verbal skills but only can provide resources to TEST YOURSELF in the topic. As for written, don't fret too much about how much it's worth as in 2013 it will be removed. But if you're worried about, grab a Princeton Review book for the written (WHICH IS NOT IN THIS TORRENT SO DON'T EMAIL ME). It basically gives you a formula and it makes it a whole less stressful.

Happy studying my fellow pre-Meds.

Special note to Arts majors... you'll rock the verbal reasoning hands down. "
,throwawayacct,2012-08-21T22:15Z,"Strong work, really appreciate it!"
,indiaman,2012-08-24T18:13Z,Thanks for these lectures and books.
,Salutations,2012-09-09T22:41Z,"Alright, I wrote the mcat a week ago and... VERBAL REASONING WAS THE BIGGEST BITCHES OF BITCHES AND I GOT RAPED BY IT. It was 60 minutes of pure WTFness.

As stated before in a previous comment, this torrent does have what you need for Physical Sciences and Biological. I had no issues with those. I'd spend 60% of my studying for MCAT on verbal reasoning next time."
,chxmilan,2012-09-20T05:32Z,"I don't why people have problems with verbal reasoning. That's my biggest strength amongst biology. The one problem I know I'm going to have trouble with is organic chem. Its so stupid, why do they even have it?

Anyway salutations, do you know the publication date for these books? "
,Salutations,2012-09-23T04:59Z,"@chxmilan

Don't bother studying the Organic stuff too hard... it's only about 3-5% of the whole exam. Just know it briefly.

Publication for EK is 2005, there isn't a new version the last time I checked chapters, which was about 2 months ago. Princeton stuff is also the lastest.

I think they will have a new version out when they have to add in all that biochem + socio + psych stuff."
