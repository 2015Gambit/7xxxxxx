,oki111,2012-05-22T03:39Z,"Hi guys! Im new at this 3D thing, and i just need to know how do i play these 3D torrents on my 3D TV. When i try to play the files i get 4 screens on the TV. How do you guys play these torrents? Thanks for all answers!"
,3Dazz,2012-05-22T05:09Z,"More detail of the codec would be nice. This is an AVC codec, and while that's playable on a PC with VLC, it wont play on anything else I have. An awfully big d/l only to find I cant play it."
,pjones452,2012-05-22T05:22Z,hell yeah thanks
,pjones452,2012-05-22T05:23Z,no one better than publichd!
,fin2,2012-05-22T05:36Z,"The movie resolution is 1920x800 and not 1920x1080, because this movie was filmed with a 2.35 aspect ratio, so you are seeing it in the way it was designed to be viewed. Only movies filmed with 1.77 aspect ratios will use 1920x1080 resolution. You can look up the technical specs on imdb to find out the original aspect ratio."
,Bren0,2012-05-22T05:48Z,"@Beowulf6666 
because the movie has been originally shot using an aspect ratio of 2.39:1, the ripper has cropped the image, removing the black bars located on the top and bottom (there are numerous benefits to this and no detriments that I am aware of). 
As a result of this process, the resolution is inevitably changed to 1920x800.

@asimsh7
wrong, see above. and if you'd be silly enough to maintain that only a rip that contains the black bars is 'true', then good luck finding one cause i don't think i have ever seen a rip where they leave them in. 
as far as the quality is concerned, it is difficult to say with 3D screens, and as i have not downloaded this rip, i cannot comment.

,madmin,2012-05-22T06:08Z,"Its 1920x800 instead 1080 because most movies aren't shot in 16:9, they're shot in 2.35:1, wider than wide screen so to speak. Thus 1920/2.35=817 ish pixels"
,pjones452,2012-05-22T06:54Z,"I fucking hate when they rip a movie with the black bars, its fucking widescreen on an already widescreen go figure. Then when you enlarge the picture, you lose the sides."
,pjones452,2012-05-22T06:58Z,"Thanks for the up the quality is great, and the movie I thought was under rated. Definitely a good movie."
,thecommander79,2012-05-22T11:11Z,"Hey guys, thx for the upload, can anyone help , always when i download big 3d file like this one I can't hear a thing, what I can do? I have LG 3D smart TV.
 THANK YOU"

And I fucking hate when they cut a portion off the movie to remove the black bars. I want the whole movie, uncropped, to show on my projector."
,asimsh7,2012-05-22T22:54Z,"@Beowulf6666 , @fin2,  @Bren0 ,  @madmin, Thank you very much for the information. I really learned a lot from the info provided.
Now I understand why I do not get full screen in most movies."
,Bren0,2012-05-23T08:11Z,"@asimsh7
happy to help! also, you probably already guessed this but i accidentaly got your names mixed up. I addressed your comment to Beowulf and vice-versa. My bad! lol. 

@Groovejet
i've never seen a movie from a projector other than in a cinema. what benefit is there to having the black bars present? with the lights off, everything should be dark other than the image itself :O "
,Bren0,2012-05-23T08:25Z,"@oki111
hard to say but it sounds to me like you have your TVs 3D function set to stack the 3D images vertically, instead of horizontally (ie. side-by-side or 'SBS'). i believe trying to watch an H-SBS movie with your display set to vertical stacking would produce an effect similar to what you describe. "
,pjones452,2012-05-23T11:33Z,"Movies are either in fullscreen or widescreen and the black bars make it wide screen so you lose have the fukcing picture which sucks ass. This movie is supposed to be mostly native 3D and it looks converted. Thanks though. But that journey 2 3D movie is great quality, too bad the movie sucks, go figure!"

THANKS"
,tewgwhwhtwerhweh,2012-06-17T18:41Z,never mind... prob solved.. use 3D subtitler to convert srt to sub amd voila...
,dlight430,2012-06-22T05:12Z,"For those having trouble playing the movie through their PC, try this copy of Power DVD; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6821031/Cyberlink_Power_Dvd_Ultra_11.0.0.2114.53_UK_NLT-Release. Open the video file from the program and it will automatically start 3d mode, along with all the proper audio and sub decoding."
,shaitand,2012-07-01T14:16Z,Not a complaint but a genuine Q. Why does everyone do h-sbs? If you are going to do half qual why not top/bottom same for active 3d but gives full res for passive since they interpolate this way anyway?

,Weissling,2012-09-20T23:26Z,"DESPITE everyone saying you need a 3d system, it's SBS (Side by Side) this was designed so you don't even need glasses, just cross your eyes to turn the two images two one, instant 3d."
