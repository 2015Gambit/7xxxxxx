DESCRIPTION:

Against a backdrop of virtual intercourse, online porn, and burgeoning Viagra sales, Sex, Lies, and Pharmaceuticals reveals how womenΓÇÖs sexual difficulties 
are being repackaged as symptoms of a new disorder. In this compelling book, award-winning journalist Ray Moynihan teams up with drug assessment 
specialist Barbara Mintzes to investigate the creation of female sexual dysfunction or FSD, and the marketing machine that promises to "cure" it. 
The authors go inside the corridors of medical power to visit drug companyΓÇôsponsored scientific meetings and medical education events where doctors 
are being trained to see womenΓÇÖs sexual problems as the symptoms of FSD ΓÇö a pharmaceutically treatable condition. Moynihan and Mintzes explore 
the underlying causes of sexual dissatisfaction among women and expose how global drug companies exploit those problems in an attempt to create 
the next billion dollar disease.
