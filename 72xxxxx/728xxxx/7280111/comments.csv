,dapidc,2012-08-27T06:11Z,"@ItsADanceWithDeath: I also wonder why, but I think it is because the creator put all information in one file, like sound track other than master track it includes 7 other tracks. And also subtitle info for more than 20 languages.
If the unused information can be ripped off, I think it will become around 10 GB only."
