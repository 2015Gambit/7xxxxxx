,warefox,2012-05-22T12:10Z,Season 2 begin June 3 2012 and the first episode is called Omega
,DngnRdr,2012-05-22T12:49Z,"warefox... if it claimed to be the first episode your comments might have been valid.
It's a MTV special summarising the first season in prep of season 2 for people who didn't watch the first or want a refresher. It also has a sneak peek at season 2. Hence the ep number 2x00 and title ""Origins Special""."
