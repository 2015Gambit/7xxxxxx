Battle of the Arctic Giants
As springtime dawns on the frozen landscape of Canada's high Arctic, Adam Ravetch sets off in search of one of the region's most massive and misunderstood animals - the walrus. Known as Man " The Walrus Man" Ravetch has devoted much of his career to documenting the lives of these tusked giants. Ravetch is on a mission to capture on film the drama when polar bears and walruses meet face-to-face. He also captures the unique and rarely seen behaviours of mother walruses and their newborn calves. At first glance, the eastern Canadian Arctic seems to be a place of frozen desolation. But, here amidst the ice floes, walruses live an arctic existence, battling with the elements and against predators for survival. Weighing up to two tons, walruses paint a familiar picture with their characteristic tusks and bristly moustaches. But amazingly, much about these animals remains a mystery. It is Ravetch's goal to unlock the secrets of these unique creatures. In Battle of the Arctic Giants Ravetch captures what is believed to be the first underwater footage of a female walrus as she nurses and protects her newborn calf.
