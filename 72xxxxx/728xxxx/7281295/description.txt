MUST LOVE CATS is a celebration of fascinating felines and the fascinating people who love them. From cats that saved their owners' lives to swanky cat-only hotels, the series spans the realm of all things "cat." It offers a potpourri of amazing feline stories, jam-packed with interesting factoids and trivia bits. The show is hosted by musician John Fulton, who combines his love for ditties with kitties. He is on a mission to prove to himself and the world that America is filled -north to south, east to west - with cat lovers, and is in fact a Cat-nation.
