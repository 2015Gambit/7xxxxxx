DESCRIPTION:

Acquire the accounting knowledge and skills to become a top-performing Project Management professional
Project Management accounting involves much more than just understanding how project income and expense impact the general ledger. 
To truly succeed in today's competitive business environment, project managers must also understand how to budget resources, determine ROI, and 
track costs and expenses for projects as well as become adept at strategy and executive decision making and portfolio management. 
With its focus on accounting, Project Management Accounting: Budgeting, Tracking, and Reporting Costs and Profitability, Second Edition is designed 
to enhance the business skills of project managers at all levels of experience.
Now in a fully updated second edition, Project Management Accounting clearly explains step-by-step how project expensing (for both internal projects 
and outside vendors) should be capitalized or expensed in order to keep the budget on track and improve profitability. 
The proficient author team of Callahan, Stetz, and Brooks culls their decades of experience to show readers how to achieve the greatest tax/cost savings 
by helping them determine what portion of the project can be capitalized.
