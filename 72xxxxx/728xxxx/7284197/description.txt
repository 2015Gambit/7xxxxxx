DESCRIPTION:

The concepts of cyberwar and netwar encompass a new spectrum of conflict that is emerging in the wake of the information revolution. 
Netwar includes conflicts waged, on the one hand, by terrorists, criminals, gangs, and ethnic extremists; and by civil-society activists (such as cyber activists or WTO protestors) on the other. 
What distinguishes netwar is the networked organizational structure of its practitioners ΓÇö with many groups actually being leaderless ΓÇö and their quickness in coming together in swarming attacks. 
To confront this new type of conflict, it is crucial for governments, military, and law enforcement to begin networking themselves.
