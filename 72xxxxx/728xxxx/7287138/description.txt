Gid Tanner & the Skillet Lickers - Complete Recorded Works, 1926-1934 [Document] (6CD128kb)

Review by Steve Leggett

The Skillet Lickers were a multi-fiddle powerhouse in the 1920s, the old-timey equivalent of a feuding rock & roll supergroup, whose jazz ensemble flash made them arguably the greatest and most exciting string band of all time. Ace fiddlers Gid Tanner, Clayton McMichen, Bert Layne, and one-handed Lowe Stokes were all members, in various combinations. Anchored by Riley Puckett's steady bass runs on guitar, they blazed a path through the dance reels of the day, taking them to soaring heights. This six-disc set is the most complete collection of the Skillet Lickers currently out there, covering sessions recorded in Atlanta and San Antonio between 1926 and 1934. Fiddle standards like "Hell's Broke Loose in Georgia," "Cripple Creek," and "Sugar in the Gourd" are all tackled here at breakneck speed, which is pretty much how these guys did everything.
