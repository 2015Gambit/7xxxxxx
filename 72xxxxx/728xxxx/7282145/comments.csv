,xfishx,2012-05-20T11:24Z,"why do you insist on cropping these every week? I mean the quality is already shit as it is, but why do you insist on cropping? makes no sense whatsoever, but whatever, I just download these every week to see if you'll ever realized you're just making the videos worse by cropping them."

I hope you mean left and right...

and nobody cares about the bars, if they do, they can crop it themselves; most people would prefer it non-cropped"
