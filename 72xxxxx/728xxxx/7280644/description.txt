Kicks Online has the distinction of being, as of this writing, the only free-to-play soccer MMO currently available.  There are several others in early stages of testing, but for now, its Kicks Online or bust.  It is important to note that Kicks Online has a very informal gameplay style ΓÇô think of it as ΓÇÿstreet soccer.ΓÇÖ  There are no out of bounds, no fouls, no yellow or red cards.  This doesnΓÇÖt mean the game is simple, as itΓÇÖs actually quite complex.  A ten minute tutorial explains all of the gameΓÇÖs various moves; long kicks, short kicks, side kicks, tackles, dodges, steals, and so on.  Even character creation is in-depth, there are literally seventeen different stats and three positions for players to chose from.

 Forward - This position has the highest ball control and is the best at preforming short shots.
 Midfield - Midfielders have higher endurance, stealing, and tackling stats than forwards.  They are the ΓÇÖroundedΓÇÖ position with decent stats in all areas.
 Defender - The best at stealing, tackling and long passes.  Defenders lack the endurance and ball control to play offensive, instead they play defense (obviously).
