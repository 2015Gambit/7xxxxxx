QM 00 - Tetryonic Math

The equilateral Maths behind Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter].
Building from a simple geometric premise the geometry of all Quantum Mechanical particles and quantised fields are revealed.

Elaborating on a new geometric view of common maths terms such as Integers, Square numbers, Square roots and extending it to the equilateral geometry of Quantised Angular Moment a unification of Classical and relativistic mechanics is achieved for the first time in recorded history.

An updated version of the first chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
