[T],drock232,2012-06-09T19:09Z,"For about 2 weeks I had to down grade from 50mb speed to 5mb.(They would limit it to 100gb a month but, with 5mb it's unlimited so it may be a little bit slower but, I will be seeding all my torrents 24/7.) Sorry fellas I ran into some finacial trouble. Once I move in a couple months I am going to buy another server just for seeding, this has become an awesome hobby of mine.) Btw thank you to everyone who seeds my torrents. "
