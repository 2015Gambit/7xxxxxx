The artists formerly known as Bridges (vocalist/guitarist Tom Clarke, sticksman Liam Watts, Andy Hopkins on bass) hail from Coventry, where they once won BBCΓÇÖs Coventry & WarwickshireΓÇÖs Band of the Month. Impressive stuff - but not many would have foreseen back then the dizzying pop heights the band would soon achieve; namely a slew of pop savvy tunes ("ItΓÇÖs Not OK"; "Away From Here"; "40 Days & 40 Nights"), a deal with legendary Stiff imprint (home to Elvis Costello and Ian Dury), and -ΓÇô now -ΓÇô a triumphant debut album. WeΓÇÖll Live and Die in These Towns foams with the same youthful vitality that has informed The EnemyΓÇÖs singles to date, and showcases their key influences: The Stones, The Jam, Oasis among them. The album starts off with the blistering "Aggro," which melds heavy bass riffs and drums with an Oasis-style sing-a-long chorus. Tracks like the chugging "Had Enough" boasts an added catchiness with its doo-wop style backing vocals, while the title track could be considered as something of a Jam tribute. The band veer towards the mediocre with "You're Not Alone" and "Technodanceaphobic," but the stronger material easily overshadows the fillers, making this an accomplished debut. --Danny McKenna
