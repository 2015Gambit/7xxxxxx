This is edition number two with recordings of Kenny Everett as the legendary radio disc jockey which many of us wish we still had in the contemporary radio, Kenny Everett died too young, but perhaps it was best for him not having to experience the radio of today.
 In the previous edition, it was mostly recordings from the BBC, but here it is primarily recordings from Capital Radio and a few other stations. The sound of the recordings in the two editions vary and in many cases they are top quality - in some cases the recordings come from the studio originals and have been transferred with care to preserve the top quality to the digital audio file. In a few other cases, the sound has suffered badly when others have chosen a much too low bitrate. I am sorry that some do not realize that sound has an important role in radio, and the sound quality is important for the experience. Kenny Everett was obviously very concerned about sound quality, but unfortunately there is not always this concern among his fans.
