Retagged LP with nine extra tracks of Reaves White County Ramblers: Top Knotch String Band from the Ozarks.. Recorded: Chicago, IL Friday, April 27, 1928. Isaac ''Ike'' Reaves, f; Ira Reaves, f; Lloyd Reaves, o/v; Ed Rumble,g. ..also used 'straw beating' on their recordings (beating straws on the fiddle)..which, at that time, had not before been recorded...also the piano they were to use was broken..so they borrowed the pump organ from the local church. One band member stated ..'we went up to yankee land in our shirts, being April, but we froze our asses off..' The recordings stand as some of the loveliest string band music ever recorded.
