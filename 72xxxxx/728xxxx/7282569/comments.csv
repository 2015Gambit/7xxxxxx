,ffsihateu,2012-05-30T19:29Z,What is the point of a screenshot if you're going to save it in a lossy format?
,TabascoQuesadilla,2012-06-06T07:50Z,"Is this not the extended version of episode 13?  It's only 4 seconds longer than my WEB-DL...or was the WEB-DL the extended cut already?

WEB-DL: 50:23
This torrent: 50:27"

,igby,2012-06-12T06:34Z,"Hi there!

I was wondering if (since you ripped this from the blu-ray discs) you could do me this HUGE favor and upload the extras and commentaries.

I'm dying to listen to those... plus I like to do marathon every year before the new season starts, and while I'm at it, watch all the goodies from the DVDs. But, since I live in Brazil, there's still no releasing date for this here!

thank you very much!"

Thank you anyway for sharing."
