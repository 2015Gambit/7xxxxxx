Beyond the Cosmos - Nat Geo Docu Series (2012) S01E01 xvid avi

more BS about the big bang.. space time etc theories
like they are trying brainwashing us :)  with all the other similar shows in recent years. like the one with morgan on it
did any one watch the docu whats wrong
with the big bang? and the other info out there on web showing the problems
with all these theories? they ignore the problems it seems

nat geo and discy are really running out of ideas arent they..
bring us more decent bbc horizon ones :)

anyhow.. I share this rubbish docu
