,Alcyras,2012-05-21T04:36Z,FAKE
,Revisionist,2012-05-21T04:45Z,lol.... even if it isnt a fake... if im dowloading HiDef files I expect 5.1 not stereo.  
,agk47,2012-05-21T04:45Z,"bah...dont know if fake, but going by other [secludedly] releases i'm not bothering...comments
are mainly negative.
Also it uses the AAC sound codec which is uber-gay and for wankers who watch on their mobile phones...
I'm gonna pass on this."
,.Leto.,2012-05-21T04:45Z,"All his other torrents are legit so I don't see why there would be a problem with this one. 
Thanks."
,.Leto.,2012-05-21T04:51Z,"Al his other torrents are legit so I don't see why there would be a problem with this one.
Thanks."
,HouseKoumoray,2012-05-21T04:58Z,Doesn't look real. But I'm not testing it.
,BurferTheGreat,2012-05-21T05:02Z,"partially dlled 15%    a=10 v=10 so far
For the resolution size is right.    IMHO=good file-
will continue to dl and seed."
,BurferTheGreat,2012-05-21T05:06Z,"Good file a=10 v=10
Not fake  (see SecTPB other ups)

For the resolution size is correct, watching partially dlled file on MPC-HT, will continue to dl and seed."
,agk47,2012-05-21T05:15Z,"someone says partiay dl'd at 15% with a/v 10/10

FAKE !!!!

,yusufak,2012-05-21T05:17Z,ITS NOT fake nice quality 9/9 downloading 7mb p/s fastest torrent ever :D
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-21T05:31Z,"No, it's not fake, never going to be fake no matter how many spam bots write a comment that it is. It's just the industry hired by the company who owns the rights to the show leading you to believe it's fake. They get paid to do that. Simple solution: Look at the files. If you question an uploader, just look at their previous files. It's a slap in the face to rippers, uploaders and seeders, like me, for you to criticize without  verifying things or reading up on something you do not know about.

Two channel stereo is chosen for people without five speakers. It's very annoying watching five channel audio on two speakers with certain sounds being higher than others. You always end up playing tag with your volume button.

AAC-LC is a superior audio codec simply due to it having better conversion options and sound quality than MP3. AAC is also well-supported on all devices, including some phones. It's basically a high-end audio codec. AC3 lacks playback support and is equal to AAC.

For those who appreciate and support, thanks.

I swear, it's like a damn game on here to call everything fake when nothing on here is ever really fake. Maybe 2% of the stuff in torrents is usually fake. Blows my mind how easily people are manipulated by silly comments, especially when the file is listed in detail in front of your fucking eyes."
,357MAGNUM,2012-05-21T05:34Z,"It's legit.Haven't finished downloading, but previewed it and the V/A seems relative to any other previous 720p release."
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-21T05:35Z,"@agk47: YES, you CAN watch partially downloaded files to test its validity. Torrents download in ""pieces,"" and the pieces that get downloaded can be viewed in many media players before the download is even finished. If a piece is missing in the download while watching it, then that section(piece) of the video will be skipped and continue to where the next downloaded piece is. "
,.Leto.,2012-05-21T09:25Z,"I just finished downloading and it's legit, picture quality is really great."
,eeeboy,2012-05-21T13:26Z,"I've downloaded the file and seeding. Quality is great, no doubt- though a little bit heavy than other same quality release, but that's not a problem at all. The problem I'm facing is subtitle. So far I've found couple of subs (ASAP and IMMERSE) and none of them matches with this.

Can anybody help me ? Some accents are really hard to follow for non-native English listeners like me. A sub would be of great help.

Again, the release is great, cheers :)"
,Kiriyama87,2012-05-21T14:21Z,"@ SecTPB

I appreciate your work, and thanks!

About the fake calls. Specially with game of thrones, every monday near release, a shitload of fake torrents of the latest episode comes up. In password protected rar filed. I guess that's why people are so paranoid."
,unaplaya,2012-05-21T14:25Z,"this is not a fake!! quality is fine, enjoy everyone"
,Torrenad000,2012-05-21T20:10Z,Thanks SecTPB You friggin rock. Give this man A skull please!
,Egregius,2012-05-21T21:02Z,"If you use these english subs, in VLC set sub-resync (under tools-track synchronization) to +19.3

[V],spastik64,2012-05-21T22:07Z,"This is legit, I checked it. SecTPB I hope you'll get trusted skull soon :)"
,geoweo,2012-05-21T22:07Z,"Just gonna add my voice to the others saying that THIS IS NOT A FAKE. Anyone who has says it is is lying or just assuming it without even testing. The quality is great for me, if it isn't for you that's your own problem but doesn't deserve to be called fake. "
,dfcham,2012-05-21T22:27Z,great torrent. good quality rip
,sofakingevil,2012-05-21T22:48Z,Thanks for getting this up so quick..Your the shite..
,saufen,2012-05-21T22:56Z,seed you motherfuckers
,ddcookie,2012-05-21T23:13Z,It's in a password-protected archive and links to a site that requires you to fill out a survey of some kind in order to download. I can only fill out the ones that require money/credit cards in my country. Can anyone tell me the password or is this fake?
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-22T01:57Z,"^lol @ ddcookie's comment. 
How the hell do you get those colored skulls so people can trust me without these comments scaring everyone?"
[H],NZPirate,2012-05-22T11:23Z,"Please dont be phased by the comments people, legit upload...."
,geoweo,2012-05-22T15:37Z,ddcookie - WHAT are you talking about? It just downloaded in a single video file for me. Are you trolling to discredit the uploader or something?
,Andropolov,2012-05-22T21:13Z,Downloaded at 11.5 MB/sec. I lolled.
