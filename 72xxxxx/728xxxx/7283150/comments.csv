I would gladly share my ISOs of the DVDs I get before I either give them to someone or sell them on. Either that or you can have the DVDFab encoded MKVs I will make (I'm not an experienced man at this so don't expect awesomeness).

You did mention your willingness to share them in a comment and I see a bunch of active torrents when I browse your name.

You can message me at tuplewitt@hotmail.com."
