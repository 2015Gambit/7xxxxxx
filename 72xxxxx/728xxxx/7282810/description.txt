NOTES:

OK sources ...video,very nice indeed,some HC chinese subs here and there ....also has extra footage thats not in the other
releases,so it might be a case of different versions for different countries,unsure on that lol.
Audio same audio really thats been doing the rounds ....which is not too bad for cam audio

Readnfo ....well too let you know there is 3 different audios used and one is the chinese audio that came with the source...used in a couple of parts for a few secs,to cover the extra footage scenes.

Work done ....well done the video ages ago but never got round too fully syncing it,but checked 26k repack and is dam close,so opted to use that audio and made another 8 cuts too sync it even closer....might see an odd 100ms slip if that now and again.
Video wise filter really nice in our honest opinion and the only thing this release is lacking it some line audio
Oh also remastered the audio file changing the EQ levels and also lowered the volume on it as on some parts it was mega loud.

Late too the party AGAIN,but thought it was still worth releasing it
