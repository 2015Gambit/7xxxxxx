Double live album released on November 23 1999. The album was the first official Guns N Roses release since The Spaghetti Incident released on the same day in 1993. Former guitarist Slash notes that the album is, not pretty and there are a lot of mistakes, but this is Guns N Roses, not the fucking Mahavishnu Orchestra. Its as honest as it gets.
