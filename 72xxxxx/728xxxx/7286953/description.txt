The genteel bluesman ΓÇô if that's not a contradiction in terms ΓÇô is in danger of spreading himself too thinly, with three albums last year alone. Happily, he hits his best form on an album recorded in Louisiana and permeated by deep southern flavours. A gentle bayou beat propels the title track and alongside subtle touches of banjo, accordion and harmonica, Creole fiddler Cedric Watson excels. Bibb's tone is characteristically dignified, ranging over traditional pieces such as "Sinner Man" and originals like "Money in Your Pocket" that display his social conscience, with Dylan's "The Times They Are a-Changin'" reimagined as a reflective, banjo-plucked crawl.
