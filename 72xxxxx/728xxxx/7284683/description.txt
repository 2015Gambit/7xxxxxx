Dreams is a 1989 four disc box set of a compilation of material taken from not only The Allman Brothers Band, but also from throughout musical careers of the Allmans and the bands other members prior to and following its formation. The set was compiled by Bill Levenson (who had put together the Eric Clapton box set Crossroads the year before) and released to coincide with the bands 1989 reformation.
