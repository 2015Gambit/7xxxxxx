,pinzmoo,2012-05-20T07:55Z,"when uploaders do this shit, we as forum users need to use the forum as intended. see the +/- well minus this shit so they get the picture to actually put info next time."
,Lonepup,2012-05-20T12:32Z,But this guy has a green skull - and I've downloaded good videos from him before.
,Lonepup,2012-05-20T13:36Z,"Well it's official. This fucking movie is in Russian. I had to d/l 95% before my movie player was able to sample it.

To add insult to injury, the fuck head holding the camcorder in the movie theater appeared to be drunk. Lopsided view.

This was a surprise to me - I won't d/l TVSCENE either (Torrent #3) with the green skull.

These two idiots should at least loose the TPB skulls - or maybe those don't mean anything anymore."
,bismarket,2012-05-20T17:09Z,"Unlike scenebalance to be so dishonest, maybe they don't care about their reputation anymore?"
,Lonepup,2012-05-20T18:06Z,"@bismarket I can fanthom maybe one green skull going nuts, but two at the same time? TvTeam was also a trusted uploader to me. While everyone is pissed of here, the bulk of the TPB action seems to be here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7281152/The_Dictator

Again, I can't understand two TPB green skulls going crazy at the same time. But I will no longer trust either."
