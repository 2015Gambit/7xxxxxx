He also demonstrates that you can take these techniques as far as you wish, employing the power-user features he describes in later chapters.

Each chapter includes a sidebar with review questions and exercises as well as a ΓÇ£Closer LookΓÇ¥ section that examines some of the principles behind the techniques.
