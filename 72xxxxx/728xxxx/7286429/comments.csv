,otrivin1,2012-05-23T23:51Z,"Thanks for fixing it mate! If I recall correctly, the second episode, the one where they thought they were racists, had this issue as well. Any chance you will be re uploading it?"

I'll need to do some digging.

If anyone is curious what I did to fix the audio timing on this ep ?

I used Avidemux and i trimmed the video down to a small clip where they were talking (so conversion would go quick) and I watched the video and checked wether the audio was ahead or behind the video and then made a random guess how far off the timing was and I lucked out with 500 ms.
Video & Audio was set to copy mode and ""smart copy"" was not enabled to try and preserve frame accuracy.
Most people know re-encoding videos should be avoided I was happy i could do this with out messing with the content.
Ohh almost forgot.. Anytime I use avidemux for .mkv's I use MKVToolnix to rebuild the container, I do this because I've had problematic videos in the past and MKVToolnix always repaired my videos, so I do that now as a habit i guess..

Avidemux can be very buggy with x264 based files so I spent more time double checking videos than I did actualy editing anything lol"

Lets just say Avidemux is a buggy pos !"
