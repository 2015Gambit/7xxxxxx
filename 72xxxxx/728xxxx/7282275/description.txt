This is a collection of some albums (all in high quality mp3) with the music of the American composer of Armenian and Scottish descent, Alan Hovhaness. His music gently incorporates many Armenian, Celtic, Eastern, Asian and other folk tunes. Recommended to all those, who like classical and folk music as well.
