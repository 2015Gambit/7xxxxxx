 "The name Prophet Jones goes back to our image," group member Goldee recalls. "When people see us in the mall, they look at us as just some young thugs 'chilling on a corner.' We don't look at ourselves like that and we don't feel like anyone else should either." Prophet Jones also holds their fans in high esteem. "We see all our fans and friends as royalty under one divine king," P. Rowe says. "That's why we call all of our supporters majesty."
