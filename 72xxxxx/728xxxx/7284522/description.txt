Doraemon and Nobita get together to create the perfect toy robot. Little do they know their creation can do much more than be the object of kido admiration and entertainment...

After years of admiration for Sueno's robot, Nobita finally convinces Doraemon to create a similar special robot. What next? The two are out collecting bits and pieces to assemble the robot toy of their dreams. However, the raw material gathered actually belongs to a special robot who dismantled once from the heavens.
Naturally then, the toy robot is no longer a toy; it's the biggest robot ever, Zanda Claus. And big is his role too -- not just entertaining, but also to save planet Earth from the Robot Army that plans to capture all Earthians.
