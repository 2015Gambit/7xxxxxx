That docu is really superficial with too many actors scenes some repeated many times, guillotine shots and overstating Robespierre importance.

Learn much more searching Wikipedia with: French Revolution.

Note for Republicans: you would like pre-revolution conditions with the top 5% (aristocracy & clergy) not paying any taxes!"
