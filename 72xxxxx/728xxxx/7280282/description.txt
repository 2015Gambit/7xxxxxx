Sometimes, it just has to be an upright, with that thick sound. For those times, these pianos are good bets. This is Vintaudio's Upright Piano Collection. Vintaudio appears to have closed up shop, and subsequently, these pianos have been hard to get, with at least two dead torrents out there. But they're here now, back from the dead.

This package includes two upright pianos: a Steinway Boston and a Clinton 1908. Both sound excellent. They're good pianos to reach for when a grand just won't do.
