SUMO - Natsu Basho -Day 15- 2012 May
Tokyo - Day 15 2012

Languages : English and Japanese
Day 15 of the Natsu (Summer) Sumo Basho from the Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo, Japan.
 The *.AVI recording was made from digital cable through S-cable, then reprocessed to 720x480 Xvid *.AVI from its original *.MPG format.  It is not HD.  There are two AVI files, due to a PVR mishap.  I was not able to save the English Broadcast of day 15... so I have supplied the Highlights edition which does have the English Commentary.
Files included;
-	Natsu.2012.15N.avi  (Japanese language)
-	Natsu.2012.15ES.avi  (English Highlights)
-	This description  (Natsu.2012.15.docx)
-	Torrent downloaded from Dxxxxoid.me.txt
