QM 15 - mass-ENERGY

The Charged equilateral geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter as developed in Tetryonics.
Highlighting the equilateral geometries and relationships between mass-ENERGY momentum and Matter.

Providing geometric derivations and explanations for PlanckΓÇÖs constant, mass-Energy quanta, Compton frequencies and numerous other mechanical quanta via a geometric understanding of established mathematical processes for the first time in recorded history.

An updated version of the fifteenth chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric relationships behind quantised mass-energies .
