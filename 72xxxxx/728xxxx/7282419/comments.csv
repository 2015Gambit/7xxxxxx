,xenoFLASH,2012-05-20T08:26Z,"These movies work great on my 360. thanks. Could you please start converting at a higher bitrate? Also, you have said that a few JLU episodes have been done; if, by any chance, S02E05-Flash and Substance is done, could you upload that? I'm a greedy cunt. Thanks!"
,portydert,2012-05-20T16:36Z,Cheers!

@PatrickDevaney - I'm afraid I don't even know how to set up a torrent subscription feed. I quick google came up inconclusive.

@xenoFLASH - what do you propose in terms of bitrate? Is *specific* in need of improvement? Point me to something.

No, Flash & Substance isn't ready yet. Sorry to be Captain Cold right now..."
,afranc,2012-05-22T07:51Z,the bitrate you're using is very good for 720p
,xenoFLASH,2012-05-23T18:07Z,"@tr108- anywhere between 3000-3200 would be excellent. I was wondering; what settings do you use in handbreak? Any chance of a torrent containing those?

Also, this movie sucks. Looks and sounds great.
It's the whole movie part, with the characters and plot, that deserves a hanging that only a good lynch mob could do.

Thanks!"
[T],tr108,2012-05-26T17:55Z,"@afranc - thanks. Can I ask how you're watching these? AppleTV?

@xenoFLASH - that's a little higher than I would like except for the most demanding (read: grainy) films (like the SW original trilogy, which should be done in June) but I will try to experiment with bit rates a little on my 720p encodes..."
