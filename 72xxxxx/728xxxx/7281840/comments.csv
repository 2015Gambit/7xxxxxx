,SnufHazTorrentz,2012-05-19T23:03Z,"Second that. Best quality out there, but I was wondering: how come there is a difference is between this WEB-DL and the 

The Legend of Korra S01E06 And the Winner Is,,,,720p Web-DL-AVC 
torrent
?"
,mek01,2012-05-20T12:29Z,"For a moment I was scared that the best version of Korra wasn't going to keep coming out, thank god SLOMO publicHD is back."
,Cigala,2012-05-20T13:17Z,"Bad RIP !!

The resolution is 960x718, 4:3 and not HD"
,SnufHazTorrentz,2012-05-20T15:41Z,"What Cigala states is correct according to mediainfo, but not according to my 50"" PX-GT30E Full HD plasma, because i had no side/bottom bars on it.

I think mediainfo is wrong, although it still is weird."

,mfassys,2012-06-03T07:13Z,"I've downloaded your previous torrents of Korra, and they are excellent because despite being super HD AND without the Nick logo, it plays so smoothly on my computer that usually can't handle 720p or HD files. My only problem is with this particular torrent of episode 6: the audio is not that good, it's crackly in some parts (like the opening with Avatar Kyoshi). Is there a way to fix it? Thanks. Otherwise the rest are all great uploads!"
