New version of this audio set, from about 2010, on 8 CDs.

Most books and audio programs about nature skills require that you have access to wild lands to hone your abilities. But Jon Young gives you awareness skills for the country or the city. Jon's programs are especially helpful for hard-working people who have the desire to learn but not much time to spend in the woods. Listening to these CDs on the commute to work will refresh your perception of the world around you. The Seeing Through Native Eyes series bears some resemblence to the material presented in the Tom Brown's Field Guides, but through Jon Young's fresh perspective. The programs are excellent resources for the beginning naturalist.

      Because they lived close to the land, native cultures the world over spoke the language of their place. They knew how to navigate and find shelter and food. They had an intimate understanding of plant and animal life-styles. Above all they knew how to move with grace and ease through the wilderness. Practicing routines that made them invisible, they could read the language of tracks and interpret the stories birds told. Seeing through native eyes means immersing the senses in the natural world and discovering heightened spiritual awareness and a sense of belonging.
