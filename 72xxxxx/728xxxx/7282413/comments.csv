,piratewrestler171,2012-06-21T07:18Z,"tr, you the man. Just curious tho, how come you upload all full hd's as 1920x800? Not that beggars can be choosers, I was only wondering... "
[T],tr108,2012-06-21T16:06Z,"@piratewrestler171 - the movie wasn't produced in the 1.78:1 ratio (or 1920x1080), it was produced in 2.40:1 (1920x800) just like this director's last film (WALL-E).

If you find this film as 1920x1080 anywhere, somebody's doing something sketchy..."
,piratewrestler171,2012-06-22T00:42Z,Thanks for clearing up confusion tr. I'm kind of a noob when it comes to movie formats (and related aspects) so I was just unsure. I appreciate your work on here!
