The phrase ""everything's bigger in Texas"" has never rung more true. Big hair, big attitudes and big drama all come together in The Style Network's new docu-series ""Big Rich Texas"" Following five mother-daughter duos, the show gives viewers a unique look into the competitive and privileged lives of these movers-and-shakers as they cement a place for themselves in Dallas's high society. From grand Texas estates to an exclusive country club, ""Big Rich Texas"" gushes with tons of shopping, cocktails and indulgence. Yet, at its core, the focus always returns to the surprising and wonderful relationships between mothers and daughters. It's universally relatable, no matter what club you belong to. The 10-episode one-hour series premieres on Sunday, July 17th at 9:00pm ET/PT on Style. (Source: Style Network)
