Penthouse - Adriana Luna (Lil' Lustinas 1: Making The Most Out Of Nothing)


Adrianna is a poor peasant girl who works in her father's cantina serving ice cold beer and other refreshments to weary travelers. There isn't much money in it, but there isn't much of anything in this place so Adrianna has to find comfort wherever it presents itself.
