[V],globeplus,2012-05-22T13:21Z,"Hi everyone and this comment it is to say that i was hanged to make the work on this game for a couple of weeks because a 50 kb xlive.dll helped run the game , the executable got troubleshooting to run the game properly with the game beeing kicked off to the desktop after just a few seconds with a black screen , i tried many things including games for windows live stuff but nothing works , finally the refered dll showed up and solved the problem ...
maybe this dll can be helpfull who knows for future games for windows live pc games ...

I want to finish the comment just to say that an optional fantastic trainer tested with this version it is included on the file .

Happy gaming ...  "
[V],globeplus,2012-05-22T13:33Z,"This new comment it is to say that for the first time i included an arc extractor to the game file and to say that somehow because the xlive.dll the players can have problems in use the controllers but the keybord playing still absolutly normal , because of this the users can try to remove the xlive.dll and give it a shot to run the game anyway and trying to play with the controller , if for any reason the game doesn´t start right like it happen to me after the xlive.dll removing put him again on the folder but knowing that playing with a controller can be a problem but just that ...

Happy gaming ..."
[V],globeplus,2012-05-22T15:22Z,"EVERYTHING ABSOLUTLY PERFECT AND TESTED : 

THE TRAINER , THE SAVES AND THE WORKED VIDEOS ALL LOOKING GREAT AFTER PLAYING A FEW LEVELS ...

THIS IS JUST A WONDERFULL RIPPING WORK !!!


Happy gaming to all of you ..."
,andre_amaralc,2012-05-23T00:45Z,"This is bullshit, this game doesnt run. In fact im almost certain its a virus. I did what said in the instructions and the game does not run. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT"
,gaurav01,2012-05-23T10:37Z,"dude its a GLOBE File it should work
thnx globe  we trust u 
im downloading it
"
[V],globeplus,2012-05-23T14:44Z,"To andre amaralc : i think you are as i was borred to have a black screen after launch the executable and in a few seconds after that watching the game crashing to the desktop ... i searched everything for a understandable solution but nothing then i was focus on the Games For Windows Live and with everything correct and trying to install older versions and diversous things i remained with the same problem , when finally somone shows up with a 50 kb xlive.dll to aplicate on the game folder and like a miracle everything was solved, just the god damn controllers issue because of that but well at least now it is possible to play the all game in a nice way with saves and everything fine but with the keybord , i suggest to the users that want to play with controlllers to check if the game runs fine without the xlive.dll on the folder and then maybe getting a shot to play with a controller if don´t well play with the dll on the folder but probably with the keybord ...

well you know , just another circunstancial episode in running games that sometimes can happen here and there ...

happy game to all of you ..."
[V],globeplus,2012-05-23T14:58Z,"This comment is to help to run the trainer (optional) :

Start runnning the trainer executable and it will be on stand by with a message that the game not working yet then run the game and the trainer will need a recheck probably (with me happen that) , what we do then : we click on the windows button of the computer to go to the desktop and confirm the version on the message of the trainer and we will have the trainer ready to go , then we click on the icon of the game at the computer toolbar and the game will be up again in the point that we stopped when was clicked at the windows button , now finally before start choosing all the available trainer options with the numpad keys , we can hit a couple of buttons just to put the trainer completly ready and this keys are : the HOME button to clean all the before choices , it work like a trainer restart or the NumLock key to alternate to Num pad keys in case of the keybord be direccionated to the normal keybord , after using this keys when you click in any Numpad available keys with cheats to the game a little funny sound will be listened but only click once because very quickly in just instants can the same key be pressed twice without notice , so when pressing the keys click on them lightly getting the perception that only was clicked once and here we go full of nice cheats stuff to play the game ...

Happy game to all of you ..."
,gamerkills_86,2012-05-24T01:10Z,"this is shit game! after i extract game and lunch globe extractor and start the game then my game stopped working, its stopped working and i stopp my virus progress but its not working :/ what is the problem? "
[V],globeplus,2012-05-24T17:49Z,"To gamerkills_86 : if necessary and i say it on the Read Me.txt on the file , disable the antivirus and windows defender if necessary in case of any indication of a false positive from the mentionated programs , we all know already that for worked executables to help running the games the antivirus programs can indicate a false positive for this worked executables , in case of them disappear from the folder for example we have to disable all antivirus programs and make a new file extraction , one thing it is for shore : none of the worked executables presents on this file can damage the computer in anyway , they are totally innofensive but with a little different structure that can give suspicious to the antivirus programs and with that the posiible indication of false positives virus .

This comment is valid for the great generality of the games files  ."
,crossebby,2012-05-25T03:41Z,"andre_amaralc 

I think U must follow the instructions, I am using globe files since years I never found problem while installing and don't blame globe for virus shit he is not that kind, I think Ur newbie. Thanks globe this file in my Q. "
,crossebby,2012-05-25T03:49Z,"U know what my NIS 2012 gives every suspicious file as virus and deleted it doesn't mean that its going to hurt the windows. Yeah Globe is write Ur AV giving false positives, and U might need to update ur direct.x, GF drivers, and install windows live to run the game properly."
,crossebby,2012-05-25T04:00Z,"Globe: I got a question, earlier I downloaded mass effect 3 and alen awake but due to some problems in my HDD I was unable to seed, but know I got those games files and I want to seed can U tell how to add these files to Bit torrent to seed, I mean these magnetic links won't let me do so. "
,gamerkills_86,2012-05-25T21:13Z,Jag gör precis som det står att man ska göra! jag inaktiverar virus program och windows defender och sen trycker på globe extractor och sen extraherar det och sen är det klart och sen klickar jag på globe.exe sen klickar jag på spel ikonen men sen så får jag felmeddelande av windows :/ vad ska man göra? vad för ny mapp skulle man göra??

,aswqaasxza001,2012-06-02T05:32Z,"if your globe extractor is not working, then maybe your worlds.globe file is broken.
try extracting again or do it manually, go to Resident Evil Operation Raccoon Citydlcpack1,
you'll see the globe file there and an unrar.exe,
open cmdgo to that directory, type unrar x worlds.globe and let it extract."

i can run the game but can only get player models to display not environment.
give it one more try, just add .rar to file worlds.globe then open with winrar and repair the archive. extract from the repaired rar file. hope it works. and yeah extract the worlds folder in the main pack1 folder."
