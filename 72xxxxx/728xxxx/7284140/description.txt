Lean, green supply chain management combines the efficiency that lean technologies deliver with the environmental and cost benefits of sustainability. The Lean Sustainable Supply Chain illuminates the business benefits of combining "lean" and "green," and offers start-to-finish guidance for redesigning company infrastructure and technologies to achieve these benefits. Palevich introduces the essential concepts of lean green supply chain management, illuminating them with a comprehensive case study showing how to manage change, innovation, talent, execution, inventory, warehousing, and transportation. He demonstrates how to integrate supply chain sustainability into business scorecards; make more effective use of third-party providers (3PLs); drive more value from information; build a state-of-the-art forecasting system and share it with suppliers; and much more. He then systematically addresses the full spectrum of technical issues, including forecasting methodologies, the nitty-gritty of supplier integration; business intelligence in event-driven supply chains; carbon tracking; quantifying lean savings; and much more. This book will be an invaluable resource for every business and technical manager, decision-maker, technical specialist, and consultant concerned with lean and green supply chains.
