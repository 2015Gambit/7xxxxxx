,kenobi42,2012-05-25T16:19Z,I've downloaded this twice now and it won't play.  I haven't had any problems with other YIFY torrents....
,LevelIV,2012-08-11T20:15Z,Same thing like kenobi I put it in my WDTV WDBHG70000NBK and only plays a black screen with amazin' sound but no image :-(
,SoulEvans,2012-09-07T02:13Z,Try using VLC player plays everything the logo is an orange cone.
,dee60,2012-09-13T20:01Z,"This won't play on WD HDTV player. The YIFY group prides itself for keeping it's files small by using AAC audio which WD HDTV player likes but this encoder used AC3 with 6 channel audio which doesn't agree with WD HDTV. Use a converter to change the audio to AAC and it should play fine on WD HDTV.
Don't convert to MKV with a srt in the same folder or it might hard code the subs like I did."
