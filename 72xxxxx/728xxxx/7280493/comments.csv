Anyone who hasn't seen this game should probably not read any comments below this one.  There's this little punk who likes to give away the game's result in Nepotu's comment section.  It's alright, though.  He's 40 and lives in his mother's basement and likes to tough-talk on comment sections on websites like this.  

Just watch...."
