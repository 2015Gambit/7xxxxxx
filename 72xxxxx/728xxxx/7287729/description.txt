My first torrent, hope it goes OK!


From IMDb:

Level-headed son Michael Bluth takes over family affairs after his father is imprisoned. But the rest of his spoiled, dysfunctional family are making his job unbearable. 

IMDb score: 9.4  


I converted (from DVD rips) this brilliant series to .mp4 files for my Sansa MP3/4 player and thought that, for quickness, others' might like to download something that was already converted.  Many MP3/4 players with screens between 2ΓÇ¥ and 3ΓÇ¥ use this resolution, including the current generation ipod classic (my Sansa has a 2.4ΓÇ¥ screen and these look great) and that is what these are for (i.e. DON'T leave me comments saying that the quality is terrible if you tried to play these on any screen bigger than about 6ΓÇ¥ - of course it's terrible!)  I tried to find a decent compromise between quality and file size and, in case you want to know, I converted these using the following settings:

Video codec: x264
Frame size: 320x240
Video bitrate: 512
Audio codec: aac
Audio bitrate:  64

NB:  Except for a few of the DVD extras, these were all originally widescreen (16:9 ratio) and therefore for playing at 320x240 resolution (4:3 ratio) most are in a ΓÇ£letterboxΓÇ¥ format with thin black borders top and bottom.


If people download these, I have other conversions for mp4 players/ipods that I can upload, so let me know if you would like that.
