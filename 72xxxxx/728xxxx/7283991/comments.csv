[T],despo1ler,2012-05-27T12:42Z,"@najp, I only upload these Reaperza encodes, I have nothing to do with them otherwise I just have the encoders permission to release his stuff as torrents but {C_P} also release the show in avi format for every1 who feels the same as you about mkvs.
 my own releases are the 1s with the Oj tag which are mostly avi and recently an occasional 720p mp4."
