This outfit was formed in 1970 in Auckland by former Challenge members Ricky Ball and Eddie Hansen. After making little head-way in Auckland, they relocated to Christchurch, where they developed their own brand of acid rock over the next year. Returning to Auckland, they worked the university circuit and opened for Elton John's debut New Zealand show at Western Springs. They also had a spell in Australia before returning to Auckland, where they disbanded in 1972.
