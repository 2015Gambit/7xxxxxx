,ikot111,2012-05-22T17:36Z,Is this on English? I mean the game
,synesthesik,2012-05-22T20:54Z,"I try to avoid commenting on torrents that I have not downloaded but this is obviously fake.  The PC version of this game is not being released until May 29th.  If it somehow had been leaked, the uploader would certainly be someone more well-known like extremezone and the original cracker/ripper would be someone liked RELOADED or SKIDROW.  Sorry but this torrent is fake and most likely contains some form of maleware.  I would recommend avoiding downloading this torrent in fear of possibly infecting your PC with some rather nasty things.  If someone downloads this torrent and can confirm something contrary to my opinion, please comment and explain because I'd love to know if there were a legit copy of Max Payne 3 for PC available now.  Thanks.  "

Correction:  Malware not Maleware.  Thanks :)"

Are you retarted?

When you view the the actual files in torrent, you can see it contains a DirectX8 Setup while.

This is the old Max Payne 1 for PC,  where did he say this is Max payne 3?"
,synesthesik,2012-05-23T18:57Z,"Oops!  Looks like I am ""retarted"" i.e. I have been given additional ""tarts"".  Sorry, this torrent does not claim to be Max Payne 3.  I guess it's just on my mind right now.  "

Don't feel bad, dude. I've been on edge about finding a working copy of Max Payne 3 too, lol. Did you manage to catch the ""SKIDROW"" version that was posted? I started downloading it and I got back on the Bay to see if any new comments had been posted about the torrent being real or fake and it had already been deleted. After not even being on the site for 30 minutes. 
So, obviously, I QUICKLY deleted my download, haha."

,smknjoker,2012-08-05T05:11Z,"Game in English and works for me : )

Easy install, just open the Disk1 folder and double click Setup.exe. No crack. No CD-Key."
