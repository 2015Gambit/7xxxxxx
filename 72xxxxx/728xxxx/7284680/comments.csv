,caincha,2012-05-20T21:00Z,"Since you asked I got to be honest: I don't like the low quality and would rather wait a little longer to get something worth downloading.
Watched the first seconds and deteled without watching the rest."
,Red_Mars,2012-05-20T21:01Z,Hey despo1ler any news on Motorcity e02 and 03 720p?
,psychogenesis,2012-05-20T21:52Z,Perhaps I was a bit too kind with my video rating.
,DuckBharma,2012-05-21T00:16Z,"Yeah, the quality is not great even on a 15"" laptop.  On my 50"" TV it's close to unwatchable.  I say go with higher res.  Not much to be gained by this method--keep it HD."
,teeehaaa,2012-05-21T07:41Z,Your quality is kinda dull why don't upload a better quality this video quality sucks.......
,zr92,2012-05-21T11:17Z,"I'd rather watch the show so soon after it airs than wait for a 720p/HD copy. Not sure if I'm a minority or not but this is definitely better than watching uncut livestreams (with commercial breaks, etc.) 
So fuck the naysayers :)"
,jh445,2012-05-21T14:53Z,Thanks for the fast upload!  
,seemovies,2012-05-21T17:35Z,"unwatachable, shame lots of cartoons released on a monday and this is the only show which causes me trouble "
,psychogenesis,2012-05-21T21:21Z,"I compared this release with a lot of the previous stuff and stuff that's streaming online and I change my grade to:

Audio = 6
Video = 4"
,caincha,2012-05-22T13:16Z,Sad thing is that I could not find a good encode yet... =/
