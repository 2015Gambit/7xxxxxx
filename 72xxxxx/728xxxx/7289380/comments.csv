,xpmule,2012-05-22T21:02Z,"I'm not trying to be a jerk anything but why thank ""Thumper"" for uploading this and then re uploading it again your self ?

And it was posted by mrriser007 before thumper too..
Then later Maherz posted it
Then scene4all posted it..

I don't get guys why ?
Wouldn't it be better to have one torrent with all the seeders seeding on one torrent rather than spreading them out over a many different torrents ? Doesn't that make sense ?

And i mention that because this is extremely common at TPB..
Look at say WinRar or Fraps for example, they are re posted daily for some reason lol

This is a Really weird community at TPB"
