,Shraria,2012-05-22T01:01Z,"@abba149 - If you think this site will get taken down because of this then you must live under a rock. Also, if you EVER get viruses from torrenting then you're doing it wrong.

,ZoolooCH,2012-05-23T14:56Z,Some thousands of botnets are going to be born from this torrent. Happy hackers....
,nixoninajar,2012-05-23T15:26Z,"@AYN333 Doesn't seem like it. I don't think that this fuckshit is legit, who would compress emails first as jar and then as tar.gz? I extracted it using tar, got a gzip extraction failed error and a jar.
If I extract the jar, I just get a java.io.FileNotFoundException .
Maybe the jar was supposed to do something nasty on Windows."
,danwat1234,2012-05-23T20:25Z,Guys just uses winrar or 7zip to extract the archive
,nixoninajar,2012-05-23T21:29Z,"@danwat1234 Mister supersmart, did occur to you that not every fuckhad is using windows these days? 
Also if you extracted it successfully, why did you not show us a sample?"
,cullN,2012-05-23T21:50Z,@nixoninajar you are possibly correct. My AV is flagging 6 files inside the .tar as a decompression bomb. I wont be opening it to find out.
,newton8573,2012-05-23T21:55Z,So is it just text ?
