Greetings world,                                                  

We are Anonymous.                                                   

Today we are releaseing 1.7GB of data that used to belong to the United States Bureau of Justice, until now.
Within the booty you may find lots of shiny things such as internal emails, and the entire database dump.
We Lulzed as they took the website down after being owned, clearly showing they were scared of what 
inevitably happened.                                               
                                                                     
We do not stand for any government or parties, we stand for freedom of people, freedom of speech and freedom of information.                                                     
We are releasing data to spread information, to allow the people to be heard and to know the corruption in their government. We are releasing it to end the corruption that exists, and truly make those who are being oppressed free.                                                    
The price we pay very often is our own freedom. The price governments pay is the exposure of their corruption and the truth being revealed, for the truth will set us free in the end. 
So once more we call on you.  Hackers, activists, and freedom fighters; join us in our struggle against these corporate hypocrites.
