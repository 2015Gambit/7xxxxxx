""To fix it go to the Audio MIDI control (just search Audio MIDI in spotlight) and change the quality to 480000 htz. Next open the D3 launcher and from the menu bar at the top select options>reset game options. Launch the game and everything should work. Hope this helps!""

,Bay2459,2012-05-21T01:37Z,"hello i just downloaded this
i was wondering if this was the full version of the game and do i need a cd key to play 
because i don't have one "
[T],User_01,2012-05-21T02:23Z,":) Full version?! It's just 40MB in size.

It's ONLY the installer that connects to the servers and then installs the FULL game. And, YES, needs key to play.

(I can upload the ""full size"" of the game, but i don't see the point; since it's not ""cracked"" or anything.)"
,Bay2459,2012-05-21T05:46Z,"do you have the cd key

,hazeriff,2012-05-21T17:36Z,How do i get the key??
,Undbeebs,2012-05-21T17:41Z,"@poffik
Why would it be retarded to look for a full version of a game for free on a pirating website? This site is based on boot-legged material and you think it's retarded to assume there's a free version of everything on here? Lol. Who's the real retard?"

,yotomyo,2012-05-23T05:39Z,"@pofflk: A $60 game? Lol you're one of those pathetic idiots who thinks games are worth $60. Lol. Fucking fuckwad. Very rarely are games worth $60. I figure $10 = 10 hours of gameplay. Like Fallout 3 and New Vegas, Skyrim, etc... you can easily get 50+ hours of gameplay, so those games are definitely worth $50. Diablo 3? Yeah maybe so. But not all games are worth $60, so don't give me that shit nigger. And I'm counting single player only. Call of faggy duty doesn't count. Cunts."

,Mithriad,2012-05-24T23:57Z,"Guys, there is no 'key' for this game. You have to login to Battle.net in order to even play the game. Annoying though it may be, this keeps it from getting hacked. Go buy it if you want to play so bad, because you're not going to find a hacked version.

Gotta say the Battle.net sync is annoying (what if I want to play when I don't have a net connection?), but it's effective."
,Nephanor,2012-05-25T05:42Z,"There will be NO KEY. There is no such thing. There will be NO HACK. Again, no such thing. This game is part of the new trend of requiring an online connection in order to play. Don't waste time whining in comments about a missing CD key, because THERE ISN'T ONE."
,Tank3,2012-05-25T05:47Z,"Buy the game! Is awesome and really worth it.

Thanks for the upload anyways! ;)"
,xhollywood,2012-05-25T22:49Z,idk why all of you are arguing. I see it as ill pay for a game if i have to but if i can get it for free i will. This download is USLESS! people post PIRATED material here thats cracked so people can get it for free. dont like it get off PIRATE bay....

,moebius22,2012-05-27T22:24Z,We may have to wait a while.
,thedjentleman,2012-05-28T11:57Z,The game is definitely worth it. It might suck that you need an internet connection but besides that the game rocks. Just go out and buy the game or find a guest pass to try it out. There is no way that this game will be available via torrent that is cracked/hacked/etc because of the need to connect to battle.net and if so it's going to be a while and in that time maybe you'll find a fucking job to pay a measley 60 bucks for the game. Just go out and fucking buy it. 
,jlwccpc,2012-05-28T14:45Z,"""I need a key, can you help me? I live in my mom's basement, and any money she gives me gets spent on near-beer, oregano errrr pot, and porn sites. I have nothing left to PAY for a key, so can you give me one?"" REALLY? How about you cut the umbilical cord, move your hairy, 30 year old ass outta your mom's house, get a job flipping burgers or something, and BUY THE DAMN GAME YOU INTARD! If you hadn't spent your childhood trying to molest your cousin you wouldn't be so fr behind the curve now, you mouth-breathing, knuckle-dragging neanderthal.

,moebius22,2012-05-28T17:58Z,"WOW was hacked, just not right away, so STFU with this ""Diablo 3 can't be hacked"" BS!"
,yotomyo,2012-06-08T04:15Z,"@Swining. Okay that's cool. you can waste your money on $60 games that aint worth it... it's your money lol. and video games aren't my life. they may be your life which is why you're still a virgin... but hey, who am i to judge? i can wait for games to go down to $20 unlike virgins like yourself.

,axinte,2012-07-01T12:37Z,"I got tired of fake cracks and I looked for an alternative.

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "
