help to seed if grabbing

enjoy


The season is short ΓÇô only 100 days from the first thaw until 

the ground and rivers freeze up again. Determined men and women 

suffer through physical and emotional pain as they head out to 

remote locations to mine for gold. They will either strike it 

rich or go broke trying.

Among those ΓÇÿgoing for the goldΓÇÖ are: John Reeves, one of the 

largest private landowners in the state. With gold prices 

soaring, John is taking a second look at the properties he 

owns. Helping him in hunt for treasure is an archive of old 

maps that will hopefully point him to where the gold is on his 

vast property. He brings in his city slicker kids to help him 

prospect and hopefully find the mother lode.

Then thereΓÇÖs Doug Baker. Part brilliant mining engineer, part 

mad scientist, Doug leads his family mining operation: the 

down-and-dirty Mudminers. Doug is half a million dollars in the 

hole after a disastrous season last year. If this season isnΓÇÖt 

his best, it will be his last.

Finally, we have CCR Mining, a company started by two young 

upstarts, Creighton Lapp and Chuck Tillian, who are looking to 

join the big leagues. They have leased a mining claim that is 

supposedly ΓÇ£gold richΓÇ¥ from Clark Durant. CCR has high hopes 

for the season, but get off to a slow start amid a series of 

miscommunications. (Source: National Geographic Channel)
