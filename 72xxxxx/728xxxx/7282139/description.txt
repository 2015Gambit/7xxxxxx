Storyline
Djamila, Ana Maria, Zoé and the others; Anne, Marta, Pierre and the others ... they all meet in God's offices, or in terms less metaphysical, in the premises of the Family Planning. The former are women or teenage girls who have trouble with their sexual lives; the latter are counselors or medicine doctors, who support and help them when families, partners or even the whole society tend to complicate matters... Written by Guy Bellinger
