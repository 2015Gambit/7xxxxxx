tried using windows xp compatibility mode and other modes and got similar syntex errors.. 

Is there a file missing or can it be fixed. by applying a value = 1 type thing within the program to get it passed the syntex error ? "

click on start - control panel -clock language region -> region language -> Administrative tab.
change system locale to Japanese for unicode programs. then restart and run noah.

and after all that.  the negs are the 12 videos are'nt worth the 1 gb file size.

however its good to finally figure out how to run these and the 3d vids are not bad.. :)
but if your expecting dragon age + porn.. this isnt it.. ;)
