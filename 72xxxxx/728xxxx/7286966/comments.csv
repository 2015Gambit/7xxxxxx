,CTR-3000,2012-09-01T13:28Z,"OK it turns out newer PSN eboots are signed with newer keys (even if the games are old) so CFW cant decrypt them without the license files. When i tested these files on all my hacked PSP's the licence files I didnt know you needed were still on the memory stick so they worked. If it is safe to upload these files without getting b& from PSN I will. sorry for the inconvenience.
TL;DR You need License files for these to work try goggling for them or I will upload mine if they don't have account info in them."
