[V],smbdownload,2012-05-21T17:28Z,"hey brother ~ can't wait to hear them myself ~ I typically grab them myself, but funds are tight so I will wait till I can get them from 'other' sources :-)

As soon as I get them I will get them up ~ I did just get tickets for the show in saratoga with santana can't wait :-)
