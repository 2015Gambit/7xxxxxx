Notes -

K well for the READNFO.. VOBS were very nice.. made a script to crop, resize, denoise..

then dropped that into VDUB where the real work was... Denoised sum more, no color adjustment

at all was really needed just altered brightness, contrast,intensity, and a few other 

minor things... Then HARD cODED all English subs.. all 3 different languages.. they are on time

then the fun part was the 2nd extra scene it does have CAM audio but oh well there is no talking

on screen anyway.. then just synced up ADTRG's LiNE to my encode and appened it all together...

enjoy a FULL PROPER RELEASE........

Enjoy!!
