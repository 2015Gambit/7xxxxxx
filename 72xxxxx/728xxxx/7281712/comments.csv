,klon0pin,2012-05-20T02:45Z,the video looks better than any of the other copies that I have seen. The audio appears to be out of sync. adjust to 1.2s
,vvvvv_five,2012-05-20T04:08Z,"Comparing it to https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7273735/The_Avengers_2012_TS_XViD_DTRG
This one's more blurry but brighter.
DTRG's is darker but crisper.

DTRG's audio is also much better. It sounds like they have a direct feed from the audio."
