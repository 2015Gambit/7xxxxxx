,aPPleFaNaTiC,2012-05-21T23:13Z,"Hello! Please note that the following is not meant to put you down in any way:

I am not sure if you know anything about transcoding or generational loss, but please be aware that making a low quality song and converting it to 320kbps does not make it sound better. In fact, it will make it sound worse, because MP3 is lossy and will make it sound worse going from lossy to lossy. This is NOT 319kbps.

P.S. There is no such thing as 320kbps VBR in LAME."
,Phntzm79,2012-05-22T08:04Z,"Wrong, the track was encoded from a 44Mb AIFF[Audio Interchange File Format] file with a bit rate of 1536kbps at 48000kHz The File was encoded using LAME 3.98 Hydrogenaudio encoder. The original file was encoded in AIFF  which is a non-compressed format and not Lossy and was converted to 319 VBR MP3 which is Lossy. Phantazm"
,Phntzm79,2012-05-22T15:37Z,"I'm not sure you know anything about Transparent encoding and the human ear's structure and sensitivity to various frequencies and bit rates! Transcoding a Lossless audio format such as FLAC, AIFF, DolbyTrueHD, Monkey's Audio[APE], Apple Lossless Audio Codec[ALAC] etc. can produce transparent encoding when bit rates are above approximately 190Kbps. What this means is that the human ear in 95% of people, cannot detect the difference between the original Lossless format track and the Lossy track. Transparent encoding means that the original data track and the Lossy track are indistinguishable from each other! Only monkey's deer, dogs and other animals have an inner ear structure and sensitivity capable of detecting audible differences between the two formats! Your assertion that there is no 319Kbps Variable Bit Rate In Hydrogenaudio LAME3.98 is incorrect! My encoding Program has custom settings and allows me to multipass encode to higher VBR than Vo[~245] V1[~225] and V2[~190]. These VBR settings produce Transparent encoding using the LAME 3.98[Hyrogenaudio] encoder! The only thing you wrote that was correct was that encoding an inferior bitrate song and converting it to 320 doesn't make it sound better! That is true because the data was lost in the first conversion! If you want Lossless encoding then use FLAC or another Lossless format for true archiving bit for bit! But the human ear can't detect the difference so why are you wasting your time? Millions of years of evolution cannot be overcome with encoding software! Phantazm"
,Phntzm79,2012-05-22T18:18Z,"Not meant to put me down in any way? You're clearly challenging my knowledge about encoding and it is clear that you have not read my old posts about encoding and quality! When you make a statement you better know what you are talking about! To know is science, otherwise it's just opinion and speculation! Phantazm"
,aPPleFaNaTiC,2012-05-23T00:51Z,"The whole transparent encoding thing has no grounds here. I just want to make sure that people are getting what they are expecting. This was not meant to insult you. While there are some cases where it is possible to get to 320kbps VBR, your encoder may be lying to you. Also, this is DEFINITELY 100% A LOSSY TO LOSSY TRANSCODE. Placing the file under spectral analysis shows that the kHz cutoff point is far below the 320kbps standard of 20kHz, I saw lower than 10kHz. Please refrain from posting similar items in the future."
,aPPleFaNaTiC,2012-05-23T01:09Z,Please remember I am NOT trying to insult you.
,Phntzm79,2012-05-23T05:26Z,"I did a frequency analysis on the source file and it shows that you were correct, the file shows a profile that is indicative of a Lossy file! I didn't create the original AIFF file, It was sent to me so I trancoded it to VBR MP3. My analysis showed a frequency cutoff at 11000Hz. I have found a superior quality track and will upload it! Phantazm"
,aPPleFaNaTiC,2012-05-23T12:52Z,Great! Thanks so much! Sorry again!
,Phntzm79,2012-05-23T16:17Z,"No Problem, I don't usually do a frequency analysis of my music tracks and am usually satisfied with V0[~245] V1[~225] or V2[~190]VBR LAME encoded files. Hard core audioPhiles usually want Lossless encoded formats like FLAC but I need the versatility of MP3 for my ipod and smart Phone. Peace, Phantazm"
