Description:
Terminator: Future Shock is a first-person shooter computer game, based in the fictional Terminator universe. It is notable for being one of the first games in the first-person shooter genre to feature true, fully texture-mapped 3D environments and enemies, and pioneered the use of mouse-look control. The story begins in 2015 with the player's character escaping from an extermination camp with the help of the resistance. Once the player fully escapes during the first mission the character is introduced to John Connor, the leader of the resistance and a young Kyle Reese.

SkyNET was originally developed as an expansion pack to Future Shock, but it eventually became a standalone product. Its major features are an updated version of the Xngine allowing for play in a higher resolution (and the ability to update Future Shock to the same), a new single-player campaign, and a new multiplayer deathmatch component. In the single-player game you must stop the machines from launching a recovered nuclear weapon.
