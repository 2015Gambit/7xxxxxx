A cast member of the reality TV show ΓÇ£Swamp PeopleΓÇ¥ died Monday, a Louisiana sheriff said.

Assumption Parish Sheriff Mike Waguespack said Mitchell Guist was pronounced dead at a hospital. He had fallen while aboard his boat on the Intracoastal Waterway, near Pierre Part.

History, which produces the reality show with Original Media, said Guist would have turned 49 on Friday.

ΓÇ£We are extremely saddened to report that our friend and beloved member of the Swamp People family, Mitchell Guist, has passed away. ΓÇª Mitchell passed on the swamp, doing what he loved. We appreciate your respect for the Guist familyΓÇÖs privacy and hope you join us in sending our thoughts and prayers to his brother, Glenn, and the rest of the Guist family,ΓÇ¥ the network said in a statement.

Initial reports from deputies in neighboring St. Martin Parish are that Guist was traveling on the waterway around 9 a.m. when he fell, Waguespack said. The boat returned to a nearby landing in St. Martin and Guist was taken to a hospital. The cause of his fall is unclear, and there is no word yet on the official cause of death.
