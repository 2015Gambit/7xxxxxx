3. The Scandinavians already have a lingua franca (leaving English aside) in the sense that Norwegian (both varieties), Swedish and (to a lesser degree) are mutually intelligible, at least with a teeny weeny bit of good will. However, Icelandic is to speakers of these languages pretty much what King Alfred's English is to modern English speakers: unintelligible without training.

Reason 2 is indeed valid, and the only reason one needs. Reasons 1 and 2 are just misplaced wishful thinking. Claiming that Iceland is replacing the US as the main trading partner of most European countries is a laughable exaggeration."
