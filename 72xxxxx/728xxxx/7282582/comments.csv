,gfox485,2012-05-20T02:32Z,"Thanks man, but maybe name them part1, part2 part 3 ect, instead of 'extra time' and 'penalties'.  Makes it pretty obvious what happened :P"
[V],spastik64,2012-05-20T02:41Z,"Part 3 = Extratime.

Obviously for me as same than Extratime.

Anyway the parts have to be named good, if there is an extratime, it will be named extratime.

Sorry for spoiler but it's requiered to."

,Big10indc,2012-05-22T05:26Z,"Does anyone have a copy of the Pre game build up, there was an awesome copy for the semi final against Barcelona, it must have been even better for the final and i can't believe there is not one here. It would be brilliant to see all the build in in the TV studios in England. Come on Chelsea , you did it. "
