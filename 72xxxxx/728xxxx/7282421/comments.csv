,oversoultriggerhappy,2012-07-27T11:39Z,"It did not work for me. :( Can you please give me the serial number? It requires serial number, but it is not included apparently. Appreciate it mate."
,UA-07,2012-08-02T04:07Z,"@oversoultriggerhappy , you don't need a serial (period) Uninstall audition the reinstall it again as a trial while your internet connection is disconnected . Then open it once to start the trial and close it immediately also ignore an pop ups about an adobe ID .

After that copy the .dll file in the crack folder and replace it with the original one which is found where you have installed Audition .

Thats all . :)"

,LAFRESH,2012-08-12T04:24Z,"lol im not real tech savvy and even i figured it out. i just downloaded it, hit trial from what you said. then before it told me to commit to the trial or to buy now, i X'd out and replaced the file with the crack and then re-opened the program with no trial message, it just opened 100% :) thanks again bro, this is actually super simply, im seeding for a couple nights that I can, hope you all do too"
