Akashik Record presents Explosive Diorama, the debut album from Secret Society (Greg Williams & Kevin Coe), a psytrance duo from Portland, Oregon, USA. Originally released in the summer of 2011, this album is a continuous journey through sound patterns of a different vibration. Prepare to cruise beyond jaw-dropping natural and man-made wonders across BPMs ranging from a chill smoke with friends to complete and total activation and loss of self. Much like the way of the world today this album is filled with beautiful intensity, bringing listeners to a place where the light bursts through the darkness and laughter disperses the slaughter. Ultimately the makers intend to bring humanity a message of multidimensional harmony of unconditional love and high vibration! Mastered by Tim Schuldt with artwork by Jacob Cordova and Squee.
