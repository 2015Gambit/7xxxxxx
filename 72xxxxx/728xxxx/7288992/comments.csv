[V],psspss,2012-05-22T07:41Z,"so this is a tvrip to a multi part webrip back to xvid !.. 

again note if use VLC and its sharpener will improve it a heap also
i know other players have a sharpener filter but vlcs is the best"
[V],psspss,2012-05-22T07:43Z,"opps sone typos again.. I meant sharing not charinf and person not personal.

shame TPB dont allow re-editing torrent details like other engines :/"
,poopp00p,2012-05-22T08:05Z,"hey psspss. you stupid cranky asshole, Transmission BT client has been around for ages and is one of the best clients there is. 

You're a fucking asswipe. But thanks for the ups!"
[V],psspss,2012-05-22T08:39Z,"thats nice.. with people like this here.. i seriously thinking to post stuff to demon from now on

at least demon have rules and banning

btw the 86 fake seeders on this..
"
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2012-05-22T08:40Z,"WTF has client got to do with it?
tpb dont allow editing of torrents 
why does that make him an asshole?

get a grip man"
,KeiraTG,2012-05-22T09:01Z,"I don't mind you moving to demon only, i'm a long time member there =) But i do find it hard to find new stuff there somehow."
[V],psspss,2012-05-22T09:06Z,"its cos on demon I ban certain clients connecting to my utorrent while im seeding it cos most people that use those clients tend to leech and drag out seeding out times and consume more of my data.. so I ask anyone using bitlord bitcomet and other weird clients to wait until its seeded out
so it can seed out faster. 
however i wasnt blocking them until he reminded me just then :)
after all its my expensive data so i need to reduce leechers. 

no reason people cant use vmware and run windows in it with p2p anyhow. or just wait for 10 real seeders.. stats wrong here.. so have to judge on the 100 percents in the peer list on client

cos someone owns a mini car dont mean its the best.. since it been around since a jap import
old clients dont mean they are the best.
anyhow"
[V],psspss,2012-05-22T09:19Z,"he prob was the rude person on demon.. posting comments.. others reported him and got him banned no doubt.. I didnt report but always reply where time allows.

and I know transmission in only one for unix 
at moment but maybe a few bad ones use it and leech as i said can always use vmware and get best of both worlds.

i block leechers regardless of clients anyhow when I see them with high percentage and over other peers.. which means they leech or not sharing as fast as should be."
,Random-User,2012-05-22T10:04Z,"Thanks for the up, ignore the wanker."
[V],psspss,2012-05-22T10:10Z,"

cut of the credits but the episode is  all there 47min long

U just watched it.. video i give a 9 and audio a 9..

enough said here now"
[V],psspss,2012-05-22T10:11Z,i mean wont.. arr
[V],psspss,2012-05-22T10:52Z,"i meant I.. not U too :)

ok.. its now well seeded.. 120 seeders when last look 

leave you to it.. while I seed out the other torrents now"
[V],psspss,2012-05-22T10:52Z,so any client can now connect ok
,twice72,2012-05-22T11:31Z,"v 6(ish)(also to note-it's not full screen-black bars around all sides)
a 7 or 8/10
I'm not complaing psspss. just saying...for people wanting to know.
I thank you for the effort. And I very much appreciate it. 
It is watchable. 
Thank you."
[V],psspss,2012-05-22T11:54Z,"

i dont think you understand.. tvrips are never full screen.. havent you noticed?

theres always blank bars top.. they normally
add more logos and promos on tvrips too


your rating is very low. its not that bad..
cam rips get higher.. think you must be in the world of 720p users and not using

VLC with the sharpener as I have stated many times.. it really makes a big difference if you try it over other players.."
,twice72,2012-05-22T14:06Z,"@ pss, i was just stating it's not full screen for anyone who wasn't aware. 

My rating. hmm. it was based on like a cam being a 1 and a 1080 being a 10, it wasn't just relative to tvrips only. I think that why it's confusing, some cams get a 6,7 or 8, but then a dvd/or bray might get the same, i assume because they base the rating relative only to the source, not to all the possibilities. if that makes sense. I wasn't saying it's bad quality. And I'm not a 720 or 1080 user, one or two of my favs i get in 720 but sd mostly.
I am using VLC, I tried the sharpening filter, perhaps i did it wrong, not used filters in vlc before. 
Anyways. again I do appreciate your torrent, and your effort. thank you."
[V],psspss,2012-05-22T14:31Z,"i think people dont care mostly here as long as they get to see it.. I dont see many HD usa cappers coming forward. the source was worse then this. I had to run it through sound forge and resync it.

the sharpener is simple.. you tick it on and slide the knob to the right until it looks the best.. not too much then it get worses.. find the sweet spot. it will enhence the logos and whites in a unique way"
,twice72,2012-05-22T17:24Z,"@psspss, you are correct, I am just glad I get to see it. and it's because of you! That is most important.  
I only stated my rating because it seems people often like to see numbers. I wasn't trying to be insulting by my numbers. I feel they are fair-relative to all the possibilities. 
I think it's very commendable that you took the time to do your best to improve it as best you could-I appreciate all you do. no disrespect meant. 
I'll try playing with the sharpening slider more, it's just a little touchy.
Thank you. if not for you I'd not have watched=most important fact."
,poopp00p,2012-05-22T23:59Z,"@ whale - I have a grip. Just venting a little. 

psspss started his career at demon by ripping others off and never giving credit. The current rant is about a disclaimer on his current demon torrents where he says he's banning clients including ""Transmission and other weird ones...""

It just shows his ignorance. And psspss is right- I can't insult him on demon because I'd get banned there. I'm a long-time member and ULer with several TBs of UL. I just always hated psspss with his ignorance and ripping people off.

psspss is a good contributor, but he's an asshole. If I saw him choking on a chicken bone in a restaurant, I'd stuff more chicken down his maw. 

His repsonse of ""threatening"" to stop ULing here at TPB because his panties are in a bunch over my insults  is a perfect example of what a childish, spiteful little priss he is. 

psspss - stuff some cotton twixt yer legs and man the fuck up. Sorry if I hurt your widdle feewings.

You stomp and cry because instead of heaping praise on you, I insulted you, but in your early days at demon you had no problem ripping people off with nary a thanks, let alone crediting the source. 

Fuck you and yours, psspss, you shit-stain motherfucker.

LONG LIVE TPB AND FREEDOM FROM CENSORSHIP!

great speed and quality."
[V],psspss,2012-05-23T03:20Z,"again mr rude is wrong...

I started on demon back in 2008 my first rip was nz ghost hunt and sensing murder no one sources there

i take the time (lots of it)also to find missing stuff and fix it (in editors) and share it to the community at my own expensive

I dont have to tell people I block ahole leechers who seem to use particular clients I could of just kept quiet no one the wiser."
[V],psspss,2012-05-23T03:23Z,"your obvious tnes gay mate.. Ive never bitched about peoples work just made a comment about clicking sounds.. or the source i had to work with

its caleld trying to educate people and alert them to issues"
[V],psspss,2012-05-23T03:25Z,as for uplding here.. i do so for a backup as tpb and demon go down reg. but with nobs like you I think its better the people who really want my stuff to go to demon at this rate
