DESCRIPTION: 

Absolutely terrific set of lectures. Should be models for professors! September 4, 2011 By P. Costello VINEΓäó VOICE 

This book is a very readable translation of the sets of lectures by Merleau-Ponty. It includes very important pieces on how 
Merleau-Ponty understood the relationship between psychology and philosophy and on the reasons he sees Husserl's work as evolving or as maturing. 
What I find as I read this, not having read Merleau-Ponty's lectures before, is that Merleau-Ponty attempted to organize and present his work to 
his audience in ways that permit a variety of people to understand him. Of course these materials presuppose familiarity with 
an entire set of texts--mainly Gestalt psychology, existentialism, and phenomenology--but even so the points he makes are accessible to the 
serious undergraduate and graduate student. I highly recommend them!
