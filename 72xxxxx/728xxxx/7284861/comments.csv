,Vikingman1111,2012-05-21T02:51Z,"Phyllis Schlafly and her ultra right Catholic fascist-minded family have been anti-liberal warriors long before anyone knew about those ideas. Her first love affair was with anti communist sentiments voiced by one of her heros, Senator Joseph McCarthy. Her writings have included such intellectual insights such as the craziness to possess a Cabbage Patch doll are linked for people's search for the lost Christ. There isn't a lunatic idea too fantastic for her to rationally discuss and claim as truth, and like an energizer bunny, she just keeps hopping along. She resides in a mansion in Illinois overlooking the Mississippi River, but incredibly her public hatred of gays doesn't include her gay son. All of this nuttiness goes back to the days of Father Coughlin in the 30s and a rabid hatred of FDR. I could go on, but why bother. In a bit this isolationist maven will join her 40 studs in the sky, and the world will quickly forget her. For someone so fierce, she could have been a great advocate to make people's lives better. Instead she savagely pursued objects of her hate, thus linking her to such historical killer flame throwers such as Savonarola and Robespierre. "
