High quality album recording of an Extremely Rare audio album of ghost stories for young people hosted by Alfred Hitckcock himself and narrated by John Allen with music and sound effects. Very Well produced.
I had this album as a young boy (1966) and I still love it today.
I suggest listening to this one with no-one under six years old on a dark, rainy, candle-lit, October night!
