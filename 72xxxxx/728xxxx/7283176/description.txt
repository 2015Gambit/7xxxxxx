Sometimes it's difficult to comprehend just why Mick Flannery is as popular as he is in an era when a musician's persona can do as much for their career as their product can. The cantankerously quiet man from Blarney isn't widely regarded for his charisma - notoriously shy, both in interview mode and when indulging in banter (or lack thereof) between songs when performing live. But as his platinum-selling second album White Lies proved, Flannery lets his music do the talking - and it's well able to sell itself. Three and a half years on from the release of White Lies comes Red to Blue - the part-time stonemason turned troubadour once again carving and chiselling a collection of songs which are rooted in misery but triumph through the adversity.

Opening track 'Gone Forever' sets the tone as the first of four amped-up tracks on this instalment of the Flannery discography - his voice in top form, bluesy rock at its finest, with a killer harmonica solo to boot. Similarly, his soaring chorus vocals against a background of brass on 'No Way To Live' impress greatly. Title-track 'Red to Blue' is probably the closest we'll ever get to an all-out anthem from Flannery - and surprisingly, it's a style which works well for him. But the real allure of Mick Flannery continually lies in the angst-laden ballads - and they're in no short supply on Red to Blue.
