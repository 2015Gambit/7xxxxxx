Note: Although most of these two albums' tracks are 320K, I included M4a 
copies of some of the band's most popular mid 1960s songs in enhanced stereo 
and also alternate versions. Those lossless tracks are the only ones I 
could find from "The Essential Paul Revere & the Raiders" compilation album.
