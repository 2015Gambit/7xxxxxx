Enjoy, everyone! :)"
,fayfay12,2012-05-19T19:32Z,"Cool, thanks!"
,Mis99,2012-05-19T19:54Z,waited for it ^^ please download from this for good quality and seed torrent
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-19T19:55Z,"Before anyone asks, yes, there's a Nick logo on the bottom right because it comes from TV. The episode without logo appears later in the week. This is from the first broadcast of the show on TV in its original HD quality that aired 2 hours ago."
,JLegends94,2012-05-19T20:02Z,Thank you so much!
,korralove,2012-05-19T20:08Z,Is this similar to http://www.avatarchapters.tv/watch-chapter/legend-of-korra/7-the-aftermath.php
,poffik,2012-05-19T20:10Z,right on time
,a4nat12,2012-05-19T20:14Z,@SecTPB Why do people care about the nick logo?
,Clairdevries,2012-05-19T20:15Z,If this works you are awesome for putting it up so soon :)
,iCondemned_88,2012-05-19T20:17Z,Thank you SecTPB!
,seatides,2012-05-19T20:36Z,@a4nat12 because they gif the episode and the nick logo takes out about 1/3 of the screencap
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-19T20:36Z,"@a4nat12: Honestly, I don't know. It doesn't bother me at all. I don't even notice it. I guess people see it as vital to enjoying the show. Not me though. I admit, Nick's logos are very intrusive, but to not watch it because of a logo is their loss imo.

@Clairdevries: Of course it works. lol. Hope you enjoy. I'll be uploading the show an hour or two after it airs every Saturday. Look forward to it."
,Poviq,2012-05-19T20:39Z,C'mon guys . you need to share. Seed a bit. im downloading 60kb/s! and uploading for the other peers 2mb/s up!
,evrel,2012-05-19T20:40Z,"legit but for some reason it doesn't work with me.
it asked to use windows media player but didn't work neither"
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-19T20:41Z,"@korralove: Yes, this is 720p HD in high quality. Much different than an online stream. "
,Revrant,2012-05-19T20:44Z,"Can't recommend it, for some reason I can't connect to a SINGLE seed out of 367 and the leechers aren't seeding, so we'll just have to wait for a better up."
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-19T21:07Z,"@Poviq: This torrent is still new. I don't own a seedbox either. The file should be able to be shared fast in the next 10 minutes. People are sharing, but right now, there's far more people downloading than sharing because not many have finished their download yet. Be patient.

@evrel: Be sure to have CCCP installed, and that you're using Media Player Classic - Home Cinema, or VLC VideoLAN Player.

@Revrant: Try again in 6-10 minutes. The file isn't even fully uploaded yet. That's no reason not to recommend this torrent. Right now there's 5,628 people downloading and 452 seeding what they have. Of course it's going to be slow. Patience, my friend."
,evrel,2012-05-19T21:07Z,"@a4nat12
some care about the nick logo because of subtitles."
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-19T21:10Z,"There, it finished uploading and went from 452 seeds to 1,418. The file is fully downloadable and people are sharing now. Download should be faster now. :)"
,Aonoo,2012-05-19T21:47Z,When i open the map  my explorer crashes and restarts how can i fix this?
,Rouyakan,2012-05-19T21:49Z,"Excellent torrent!! This is ripped off Nick HD, so the quality is very good.

V: 10
A: 10"
,Scyrthis,2012-05-19T21:55Z,"Perfect quality :D
Epic Episode!!!!"
,CanzonE,2012-05-19T22:25Z,"Seeding :)
Great quality! TY"
,theshape31,2012-05-19T22:48Z,"Cheers, buddy!  I very much appreciate the quality!  Keep up the great work!"
,mad0moon,2012-05-19T22:51Z,it doesnt work right for me :(
,yoonchink,2012-05-19T23:32Z,"video's great, but the audio lags a bit. does anyone know how to fix this?"
,firexninja,2012-05-20T00:13Z,thank you!
,screwmkvfiles,2012-05-20T00:37Z,Fuck you guys and your MKV files! They don't play worth a shit and they don't convert well either. You snobbish bastards are like those Apple douchebags who think they're better than everyone.
,Toemme,2012-05-20T00:48Z,"something's not quite right with this rip. watching this with windows media player is no problem, but divx player cant play this at all (screen is all green) and vlc player starts juddering at approx 13:00 min. doesnt happen with other videos."
,williamvirkis,2012-05-20T02:27Z,"The quality is superb, the problem for some of us is the bitrate, not every computer is capable to play such amount of data per second :S

For those who have a have a not so powerful computer you might want to wait until another lighter version comes out."
,3htthe,2012-05-20T03:28Z,"Wait, 60 fps? That's a shit load."
,jj441,2012-05-20T03:53Z,works perfectly on my macbook pro. problem PC fags??? but in all seriousness dude don't upload mkv's they are shit. stick with avi's or mp4s cause they are reliable
,Jeroen502,2012-05-20T04:00Z,"Woo! Finally I found a good one!
I mean awesome one!
Lets download this at my max speed of 2 to 6 MB/s.
Atleast my PC can handle these big files."
,Jeroen502,2012-05-20T04:03Z,"After my last message: Downloaded at some awesome rate of a steady 3.3 MB/s and got it after 2 mins.
Quality: AWESOME!"
,syuvial,2012-05-20T04:14Z,"To the people complaining about bitrate and audio lag: 

Get VLC. 

To the guy whining about .mkv files: There's nothing wrong with .mkv, except that a lot of players don't support it. They convert to other formats fine, and they play fine. "
,kotaro_14,2012-05-20T04:31Z,"@jj41 Wth are you talking about?! You could never achieve the equal amount of quality if he encoded it in .mp4 or .avi, which are both compressed formats while .mkv is completely uncompressed, allowing for maximum quality."
,3htthe,2012-05-20T04:54Z,"V:8
A:8

Quality is good, but a bit blurry in parts. Audio is also good but seems like its missing bass, or sounds like it was recorded from a speaker"
,cnc3freak,2012-05-20T05:42Z,"to everyone complaining about .mkv format, .mkv is not a filetype, it's a CONTAINER, the video itself is formatted in MPEG-4."
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-20T11:39Z,"This is a non-encoded transport stream(.ts). I wrapped it in MKV because more people recognize it. This is the quality Nickelodeon HD broadcasted it at. 

A transport stream(.ts) is a portable copy made from TV turned into an executable data file for PC. I can adjust the bitrate if I want, but choose not to simply due to the enjoyment in quality. I can increase or decrease. I leave it at steady.

If you want to extract the transport stream(.ts) from the MKV container, get MKVToolNix and use MKVExtractGUI to demux and obtain the original file.

,cloudsora,2012-05-21T01:22Z,"http://www.cccp-project.net/
DOWNLOAD THIS YOU STUPID IDIOTS
MKV is better you just need to have shit to run it.
Although I will agree with the one comment about apple douchebags."
,naughtydogmom,2012-05-21T23:08Z,"Use VLC media player, not DivX. "
,Time_Devourer,2012-05-22T12:43Z,"Are you shitting me?  People are bitching about mkv?  wtf, lol"
,Shadow416,2012-05-25T04:04Z,"for the folks who are having problems with audio syncing. It should be fine, but if its really an issue then 
I say convert to avi, then use the free YAAI program (yet another avi info) and then you can align the audio and video even if its a millisecond apart. I did it for a couple movies and it worked perfectly and was very fast since its not doing any converting or anything"
,ziggywig,2012-05-26T18:25Z,"Perfect rip,good job and thanks."
,mahmoudspeedo,2012-05-27T12:03Z,i cant find e 8
