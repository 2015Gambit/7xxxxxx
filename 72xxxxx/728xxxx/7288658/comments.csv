,5p1n47,2012-05-22T04:52Z,"yeah but its sposed to be a 2 hour series finale, and the ettv is only 45min and no s08e23 so i'mgonna DL this, will let u know"
,5p1n47,2012-05-22T04:55Z,"kk first half is swan song, which is a behind the scenes sorta look back.....my bad I thought when they said 2 hour finale they meant 2hour episode"
,bananane,2012-05-22T05:40Z,"@aolrich I usually don't upload House but there weren't  — by the time I checked — any on piratebay.se so I uploaded mine… I totally understand your point of view (I only download only from verified sources :D).

Though, I am not a verified source and I don't plan to be…but if I have something to share, I will share it!

Still, enjoy if you want!"
