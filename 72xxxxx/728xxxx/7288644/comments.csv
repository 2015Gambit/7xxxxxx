HOWEVER, being as it's a folder in my Season folder, in a couple days, I WILL be moving the file, which will render my unable to seed.
[IF the uploaders would STOP putting extra files (which causes them to create a folder where I select the download to...) than I'd be glad to leave the files available to everyone for longer.]"
