Junco Partners formed in 1964, took over from the Animals at the famous "Club A'GoGo" and "Downbeat Club" in Newcastle and Sunderland's "Blue Note". The band enjoyed fanatical local success almost immediately and turned "pro" to go to Hamburg's famous "Star Club" of "The Beatles" notoriety, but were turned back at the border as being too young to get visas. They then spent six years playing the national club and college circuit alongside "The Who", "Rod Stewart", "Jethro Tull", "John Mayall Band", "Jimi Hendrix" and many others. They personally backed Blues giants "Howlin Wolf" and "Freddie King" on international tours. The band made single and album releases, but split in 1971. Individual members went on to play with "Robert Palmer", "Elkie Brooks", "Mick Ronson", "Mick Abrahams", "Bell & Arc" and "Lindisfarne".
