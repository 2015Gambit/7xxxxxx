,Kelson42,2012-05-20T15:09Z,"Everything is in the torrent, if you want to download separatly the software and the content, go directly to http://www.kiwix.org"
,vctrt,2012-05-21T20:20Z,What's the point?
,joetimmy,2012-07-31T15:30Z,The point is to have an offline encyclopedia in case you're without the Internet for an extended period.
,joetimmy,2012-07-31T16:49Z,"Does this come with images?  I've noticed the rar says nopic, but this torrent is ten gigabytes larger than another Jan 2012 Kiwix torrent."
