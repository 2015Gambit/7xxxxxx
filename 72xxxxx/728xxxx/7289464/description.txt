This is the only Paul Revere and the Raiders album in which the other Raiders and Paul only contributed to one song : "Peace of Mind", and there are 2 similar versions of that here.  Lead Raider Mark Lindsay still dominates this album like those that came before and after it, but the style is different than the rest.  
It combines hard rock with R & B, soul, and even funk. It's also the first time female backup singers appeared on a Raiders album on some of the tracks...and that's a good thing, baby.
