This show was recorded on, the second of two nights at the New Victoria Theatre as the band were touring to promote the soundtrack LP from their feature film Flame which had been released to critical acclaim in their homeland. Many of the songs here are from that album including "How Does It Feel," widely regarded as the band's finest moment. The classic hits are represented too, including "Gudbuy T'Jane," "Far Far Away" and "Mama Weer All Crazee Now" as well as long time stage favorite "Just A Little Bit," which features the blistering bass of virtuoso Jimmy Lea.
