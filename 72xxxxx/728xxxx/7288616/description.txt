WHAT IS STEAMFUNK?

Steamfunk is a sepia comic which is a bit of steampunk (duh), a pinch of diesel punk, western, and fantasy. Obvious influences are Wizard of Oz and Firefly, but the "funk" serves dual purpose referring to the musical references throughout the story as well as the state of the world the characters exist in.
