,Ryokan76,2012-05-21T04:27Z,@addee12: The green skull next to the uploader's name means it's a trusted source. That means it's not fake.

,TPB_King,2012-05-21T04:29Z,"@ addee12 - As far as I know, green skulls don't upload fakes."
,Revisionist,2012-05-21T04:29Z,still with the RARs... am i the only one that isnt just annoyed but thinks the Rars have trojans or malware.  I just avoid Rars altogether

It's not fake you fucking idiot. 

Consider that the poster has a green skull indicating that he is VIP! "
,thebeav111,2012-05-21T04:34Z,why would it be fake?  green skull

,drmurai,2012-05-21T04:34Z,"Revisionist 

You moron. Go hide under your bed."
,jocaka929,2012-05-21T04:34Z,sceneline doesn't do fake...
,AtomicPizza,2012-05-21T04:35Z,i doubt it its sceneline
,Victoriasantos,2012-05-21T04:37Z,@addee12  You do not earn a skull with fakes.

,.Leto.,2012-05-21T04:38Z,"this can't be a fake, it's a trusted uploader"
,sabesm,2012-05-21T04:55Z,Ok some body downloaded tell is it fake or real?
,thebeav111,2012-05-21T05:03Z,there a reason I can't connect to any of the seeds for this torrent?  just peers?
,thebeav111,2012-05-21T05:10Z,"there's always the possibility someone hacked the account, but this guy looks legit looking at his history...  maybe he just got the copy first this time and decided to upload it since no one else had?"
,agk47,2012-05-21T05:21Z,"i've had past IMMERSE releases and they are not fake...they are also not rars...
go figure...
this is probably fake and anyone with any sense will steer well clear."
,BurferTheGreat,2012-05-21T05:24Z,"Get the same version from DibyaTPB, no rar.   2 files.    i don't know why there's usally two versions of immerse, one from sceneline RAR and the other from Dibya, which I prefer."
,agk47,2012-05-21T05:28Z,"never trust rars
especially for new releases

btw...why are my negative comments always deleted."
,Dakins,2012-05-21T05:46Z,I skimmed through the file. It's legit. Calm down everybody and just enjoy the show.
,Indexy,2012-05-22T13:42Z,"This is working and legit...
So what it has RARs, just scan it and it'll say it safe. 
No reason to assume RARs contain virusses, it's just a different way of uploading. The guy is a friggin VIP for crying out loud, just download it and enjoy the show. Great Q!"
[V],spastik64,2012-05-29T23:47Z,"Stop!

Do not be noob. Scene groups made releases RARing:

http://x264.nl/tvx2642011-2.nfo

Unraring only takes 2 minutes. You dont like rar's ? Download from another uploader, but rar's are more trusted than no rar's. Rules of 720p scene groups:

- Releases must be packed in RAR file format
- Rars must be in multiples of 50 MB, no more than 101 files (.rar-.r99)
if using old-style naming, or 99 (.part01.rar-.part99.rar) if using new-style naming. 1MB = 1,000,000 bytes
