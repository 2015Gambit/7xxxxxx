On first listen, Field Songs may seem more related to the concerns of his earlier trilogy of recordings; one whose focus expresses only the necessity of returning to life's basics as seen from the front porch of a farmhouse. It's where this album begins and ends geographically. That said, Field Songs, structured as an eight-song cycle to be taken in one sitting, has implications that are far wider--it contains the entire world. With the sound of actual field recordings of birds and crickets chirping throughout these songs, a grander vision unfolds. It begins with "Lay Your Burdens Down," where Whitmore urges the listener to shed what holds her back and uses his own history to illustrate the consequence of not doing so. His strummed banjo links a chain from ancient griots and farmers to survivors of war and poverty, to prisoners and all oppressed people in asking the question: "How long can this night time last?" In "Field Song," driven by a choppy, percussive guitar, Whitmore remembers "three square meals and a livin' wage" as the "good old days," before the "Manifest Destiny of the factory farms." He even asserts "much was lost when the West was won," that the gilded age is over; the best of times have yet to come if only we get into the field and do the work. What work? It may be building a house with our own hands, or it may be organizing with others.
