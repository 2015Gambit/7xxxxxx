,hubble6,2012-06-16T18:10Z,"Ok, here's what you do:

1. Mount the ISO file using MagicISO
2. Run the setup
3. Open crack file and click on rld-sim3.exe, generate serial key then copy paste when asked during the setup
4. Open file location
5. Replace TS3.exe with TS3.exe located in crack folder
Hope that was detailed enough :)"
,laylatyler,2012-06-20T14:47Z,the registration code doesn't work! I re-reentered it 12 times. my registration code is QADM542K7NG5C7N89RLD 
,Fire_Beast,2012-06-24T22:40Z,Guys does this work? I wanna download the file right now... is this the full complete version of the sims 3?
,A.Y.R.E.N,2012-06-26T14:40Z,"Yup guys, this works very well. It works with Windows 7 32-bit also.

Just follow @hubble6's instructions and the install should be no problem for you.

I don't understand what kind of registration codes are you all talking about, though. All you need to do is generate serial key when asked, and it can be found in the crack folder, just double click rld-sim3.

And as for mounting the ISO file, Daemon Tools works great, too.

@Fire_Beast - Feel free to download, it works brilliantly :)
Yes, it's the full version base game of The Sims 3."
,bekiemma,2012-06-26T18:42Z,"i've followed all of @hubble6's instructions, only i don't understand the bit asking me to replace the ts3.exe with the one in the crack folder? if anyone could help that would be great. the only ts3.exe i could find is in the crack folder so i'm not too sure what to do.

,piggy_123,2012-07-06T12:45Z,Brilliant torrent! Works perfectly! Thanks!
,Brob90,2012-07-08T21:08Z,"Replacing the TS3.exe folders

After you have installed Sims 3 replace the TS3.exe file in the new folder (The Sims 3"
,Brob90,2012-07-08T21:10Z,replace the TS3.exe in the Sims 3 folder after you have installed it with the one in the crack folder.

,Maggynerd,2012-08-02T01:15Z,Thank you very much for the upload. works nicely on win 7. i do have occasional blackouts but i know its cuz of my old graphic card. tnx again. =)
,Maggynerd,2012-08-02T01:19Z,"leno and ert, i dont know if you guys figuered this out already but, in both vista and win 7 all you gotta do is copy the crack from CD and once you try to paste it its gonna give you the option of COPY AND REPLACE. so just do that. :) hope that helped."
,ert91,2012-08-02T18:43Z,it is not working. it says that i have to reenter my registration code.
,ert91,2012-08-02T19:07Z,"everytime i try to replace the file it says that there is not enough space. when i try to delete the file and then paste the other one, i can't delete the file."
,Maggynerd,2012-08-02T21:28Z,"@ ert, you know when i start the game in the starting menu it says i have an unathorized copy and blah blah but it let me play it. hmmm, im not sure about this one but how about if you try and just paste the file and rename the original one.forget about deleting it. or have you tried reinstalling it? :/ 
it would be a shame if you cant play its a good game."
,ert91,2012-08-03T13:32Z,"i already reinstalled it, but it's still not working. 
when i try to start the game, it says, that i need a registration code.
and i can't paste any file in the order... :("
,Maggynerd,2012-08-04T20:57Z,"have you tried to put the same ""key"" that you install the game with as yoru registration key? or maybe try to generate a new key?! its under crack file rld-sim3.exe, generate serial key then copy paste when asked. hope this helps >."
,442781,2012-08-06T01:18Z,this shit sucks you gotta put in a fucking code
,ert91,2012-08-07T20:53Z,"thanks for your help, but it is still not working. i tried everything"
,Aerryx,2012-09-12T00:28Z,"I installed and it ran perfectly, did a scan, no malicious items found.  You can use PowerISO or MagicISO to ""mount"" the file, both work great.

Instructions for people that don't quite know what to do:

1. Mount The Sims 3 iso file using a program like MagicISO or PowerISO.
2. Go into ""My Computer"" and click your extra drive that should have The Sims 3 icon on it.  Install.
3. In the ""Crack"" folder, run rld-sim3.exe and hit ""generate"" to get a CD key.  Copy and paste it into The Sims 3 install wizard when prompted.
4. After installation, go into the ""Crack"" folder and copy or move ""TS3.exe"" into the folder the game was installed to (which for me - since I used the default install option - was Program Files (x86) > Electronic Arts > The Sims 3 > Game > Bin) and select ""Move and Replace.""  Use the TS3.exe you just moved into Bin to run the game."
