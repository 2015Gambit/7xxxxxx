,Dimmis80,2012-05-20T11:55Z,Hey Nepotu my friend.I have a sugestion dude.I was watching game 3 of Thunder vs Lakers  and like other games i have seen the screen with the other results that drops and i learned the score of an another game that i wanted to see game 4 Celtics vs Sixers.And now i kinda lose my interest about that game that i wanted to watch but btw i will watch it to see how they went there but there is not the same thing that when i did not know who wins..!So can u tell to the Rippers if they can  dellete from the game-videos that screens for the other games.?I think those screens with the other results are fun killers or something.??Thats my sugestion and congrats for the weekends releases to u and for the rippers.Cheers.
