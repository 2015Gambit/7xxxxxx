,iamsiaho,2012-05-22T23:38Z,"hey! HEADS UP PEOPLE:

i got an e-mail from my internet provider. included was:

Copyright infringement level: 2 
Notice ID: 315-6052296 
Title: Game of Thrones 
Protocol: BitTorrent 
IP Address: [deleted]
DNS: [deleted].bflony.fios.verizon.net 
File Name: Game.of.Thrones.S02E08.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE [PublicHD] 
File Size: 1409456779 
Timestamp: 05-22-2012 15:53:18 UTC 

it basically wanted to inform me that my IP knew i downloaded the file, that it was a copyright infringement, and that i should stop.

they also stated: ""Protecting Your Privacy: The copyright owner has not asked Verizon to identify you, and Verizon will NOT provide your identity without a lawful subpoena or other lawful process. However, if the copyright owner does issue a lawful subpoena or other lawful process that seeks information about your identity or account, Verizon will be legally required to provide the requested information to the copyright owner.""

forum is down, so i post this here because it was this torrent. when i can get into TPB forum I will post my concern there.

until then, BE CAREFUL with what you download"
,thebeav111,2012-05-25T05:47Z,iamsiaho...  you need to learn to be anonymous
