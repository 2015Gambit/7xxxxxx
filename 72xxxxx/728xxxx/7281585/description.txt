Notes:
All songs were actualy lost on a broken HDD (hard drive) which is waiting to be recovered, 
the drive is damaged and will cost a lot to send it off for repairs, so one day i hope to find the other recordings we did, about 3 months worth are lost on the Drive.

All songs improvised and never played before!
