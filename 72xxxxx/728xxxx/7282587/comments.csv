,Default_GIU,2012-05-30T16:05Z,"Hi guys, 

I'll found the issue. You need to download the 2 available updates. 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. Install the first file at the right folder location. The patch will make a new short cut appear on your desktop. Now, the second one. Use only the new short cut to begin the game. Thats it. I'm also running it with out any bugs and in English. Thanks for the upload Justin :)"
,silverking789,2012-05-30T18:47Z,so you just install that 2 patches then you got english??
,silverking789,2012-05-30T22:50Z,Guys can anyone confirm what Default_GIU said it is true...about that english
,JUSTIN166,2012-07-03T22:20Z,Stop spamming Silverking.
