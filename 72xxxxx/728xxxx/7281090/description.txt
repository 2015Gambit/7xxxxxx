Kenny Everett (25 December 1944-4 April 1995) was an English radio DJ with unrivaled comic talent, combined with a sound technical ability and tremendous ambition. This, above all, could be experienced in his sci-fi comedy series titled Captain Kremmen, which was done both as a radio series and an animated TV series. The radio series was also published in a number of LPs.
 Kenny Everett soon became one of British radio's best institutions but he also had an ability to make himself uncomfortable with a few radio executives, yet also enormously admired by many others. He died at a premature age and is very missed by many. Here in this first edition is a collection of programs from his involvement in the BBC Radio 1, 2 and 4.
