This book concentrates on the epidemiology of corruption and disease transmission as a saturable interaction as well as case studies of infectious diseases of global public health concern, namely drug resistant TB, influenza and malaria. It gives the students and researchers in related areas ample information on disease epidemiology and transmission dynamics, and well-elaborated mathematics useful in analysing the proposed models. Great emphasis is not only placed on describing the models, but also on analysing and bringing out results of great epidemiological meaning for public health control and planning.
