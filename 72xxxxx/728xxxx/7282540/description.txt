In 2005, Solutia left the acrylic yarn market.  They took down their large web site of crochet patterns. We whined and they put it up for a couple of months so that everybody who knew about it could get all the patterns that they wanted.  I wanted afghan and shawl patterns, so this file reflects things I thought I might make in the future.  

Each pattern is a separate file that I copied and pasted from the web site. They are saved in rich text format so that you have a photo along with the instructions.  

Please, be sure to read the pattern to be sure no chart is missing before you buy yarn or start the project.  I tried to be very careful, but ya know, things happen. Enjoy these patterns!
