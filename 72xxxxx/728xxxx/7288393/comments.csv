,drgnbrth,2012-08-23T03:30Z,"Thank you! WOW!  I am new to torrents, too.  But have a ton of young adult and teen books.   When I figure this out I will upload some.  Anything special you are looking for ABCD2012? If there is a way to email me thru here, I can lead you in the right direction to get the protection off your B&N books. ~ drgnbrth"
