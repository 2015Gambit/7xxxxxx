
The final update of Total Uninstall PRO has been released. Martau seems to make it quite hard for users to register this program. However the newly updated key turned up so much faster than expected indeed. Please read the rest of the article about how to get it to work properly.



install notes:


Install the program. Before running the program disable internet (pull out a plug or disable via control panel).
Register the program with this serial: (Included inside the file)
Thereafter you need to block the program with firewall. In Windows 7 firewall you need to create rules for tu.exe and tuagent.exe to be blocked. When done enable network access
Enjoy! ;) (Thanks to Sternog and Nsane board for the installation steps.)
