this video is poorly made. just look at the preview links of the video to understand. The entire video is split screens so you're watching two half screens on top of one another. FUCK THIS GUY BOZX HE FUCKED IT UP."

What the heck do you mean it's messed up? that's how 3d movies work, 2 images for left and right eyes...your 3d tv should know how to handle the images."
