FCOM SuperPack v6.4.2

Shortly said, a GREAT modpack with 2 simple idiotproof instalers. 
1 main + 1 patch = Start having fun!

Note: I am NOT the author of this modpack or ANY of the mods included.

This is the last known publicly released version of the FCOM Superpack before the project suddenly vanished.  The documentation, including what exact mods are included, whether meshes have been pyffi optimized, etc, is rather lacking.

This is my very personal taste based modpack, you can like it or not, all mods added are intended mainly for immersion, realism and roleplaying, I do not want add content for content's sake mods like fancy body / location replacers / non-lore-friendly quests. I've even forced myself to do not keep much more than 100 Esps actived, so stability is assured.

FCOM SuperPack includes a clean FCOM installation plus some mods you (well, I actually) cannot live without, and that are intended to do not break the FCOM game balance. The main difference with other modpacks is that this one is auto-installing, you won't even need to rebuild the bashed patch, just install and play!! Lot of esps have been cleaned, meshes have been pyffied (optimized), many compatibility fixes, even those not available on the Nexus but made by myself (SUPER Patch.esp), have been introduced, and overall everything is improved in the best way.
