I am not blaming you TejasNair, but this book is completely awful. It has some of the worst writing I have ever come across and I read a lot of books. Like lots. I have nothing against erotica or porn either, this book is just plain bad. Extremely repetitive, boring and silly. It started life as Twilight fan fiction and you can tell. It reads as if it were written by a 13 year old girl with no idea of what sex or love are or what erotica is or what good writing is for that matter.
Read at your own risk. "

,joew771,2012-06-09T11:16Z,"If you want to read a book because of how bad it is you picked the right one. This is ""The Bad Writer Who Wrote a Boring Book"". It is awful. I would rather read ""The Poop Who Took a Pee"". Even though the South Park boys wrote that as a joke, and it isn't real, it has to be better than this.

If anyone wants to read real books, actual controversial sexual and well written books, look here -

Also...this book is laughably bad. Actual excerpt (and I swear I am not making this up):

""'You're very beautiful, Anastasia Steele. I can't wait to be inside you.'

Holy shit. His words. He's so seductive. He takes my breath away.""

...awkward."
