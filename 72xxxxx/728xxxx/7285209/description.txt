Marilyn Manson - The Complete Collection*

Everything is properly tagged with artwork using itunes. I've spent the past 5 years compiling this stuff from various sources on the internet. The B-Sides and Rarities compilation is something I put together myself over the past few years, I even made my own artwork for some of this stuff when I couldn't find any online.

Everything is at least 160kbps but most are 224, 256, or 320 or variable.
