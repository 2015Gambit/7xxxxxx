,jojobee,2012-06-02T00:07Z,"It's actually missing the last 42 minutes or so. This was a double-length, season finale episode, so ep 19/20 in one. "

,PCdoc7,2012-06-08T18:23Z,"So we spend months following this series through 18 Episodes - and then get the shaft on the final, most important Episode ??  WHERE IS THE REST OF THIS SHOW ????"
