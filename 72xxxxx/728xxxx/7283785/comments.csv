,Ipmark,2012-06-10T07:49Z,"Unlocked IMG:
Full format a SD with filesystem FAT32, create a folder named Garmin and copy on it the unlocked gmapsupp.img file map.

Masource version:
Install the package on the PC (CNNANT2013_10Update.msi), then apply the patches.
Then install and patch Mapsource too, it will be useful to select a specific part of the map to send to the device (GPS)."
,sonnytwins,2012-06-21T04:38Z,"This worked for me on my 7 year old Nuvi.  
I had to delete the original map file  (gmapprom.img: 1 GB)  in order to make space on my 2 GB Nuvi for this new file.  I renamed this new file to gmapsupp.img (it is 1.7GB) and put it in the /Garmin/ directory on the Nuvi.  I also had to delete some unused languages and mp3's to make enough room for it to fit.  It worked like a charm.   Thanks so much for the upload!"
,edmitchell,2012-06-24T17:15Z,"I do not have a garmin device, I just want to be able to view the maps using mapsoource or basecamp ( it doesn't really matter which.)I'm just looking for an offline mapquest sort of thing here. Anyways, I have downloaded this torrent and am unable to view the maps in mapsource or basecamp. I have already installed both programs and have put in the patched exe's. I have ran the mapset toolkit with cgpsmapper and keep getting the error: E032 Layer 0 cannot be empty. What does this mean?? I have also tried splitting the gmapsupp.img files with Gmaptool and then tried to load each of those files, but have had no success. I have already tried everything posted in this and other torrents' comment areas with similiar luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
,Ipmark,2012-06-24T19:08Z,"As I already wrote in the description, ""This map can be viewed on the PC using BaseCamp (USB drive, Garmin folder).""
In other words, copy the map in a Garmin folder of a fully FAT32 formatted pendrive and start BaseCamp with the USB drive plugged in and select the map in the upper left corner of the program."
,BeemerBiker2,2012-06-26T21:34Z,"When updating a 2720 or Garmin with no external memory, use sendmap20 to delete the existing map then use the webupdater to upload the unlocked map.

,daveh65,2012-08-04T19:05Z,"Hi Ipmark, I have just downloaded this torrent and wanted to delete the old file from my Nuvi 610, but my Garmin has only 415mb and the download is way larger. I have a micro sd card and an old Europe map that I don't use any more (2 gig), how do I put it onto the sd card. Many Thanks."
,Ipmark,2012-08-05T08:28Z,"Decompress with Winrar the package.
Copy the new gmapsupp.img in the SD's Garmin folder (replace the old one).
Insert the memory card in the Nuvi's USB slot and switch on the GPS, check the new map in (wrench) System > Maps > Maps Info"
,daveh65,2012-08-05T18:17Z,Thanks Ipmark. I think I found the problem. I did everything you said and my old map I mentioned was on a sd card that I can update with your download. I also have a sd card that I cannot update as it is write-protected and the tab is broken. So I now have a working update and a sd card that needs to be renewed. Thanks for your help.
,Ipmark,2012-08-07T17:03Z,"Have you tried this repair method for your SD ?

,daveh65,2012-08-11T16:44Z,"Sorry, I meant to say the adapter (not sure what it is called) that the micro sd cards goes into is broke. The sd card is fine but when I put the sd card into the adapter then into the pc card reader it does not recognize it. I tried to transfer the files straight to the sd card but it won't. I have the maps now on a card that works great, even though it isn't fully updated as a street near my home in Denver isn't on, even though the street is 2 years old!!!!! But again thanks so much Ipmark."
,daveh65,2012-08-12T01:18Z,"So I bought a new sd card (without the micro sd card) transfered the downloaded file and it works great.
Thanks."
