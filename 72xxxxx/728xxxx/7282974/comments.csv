,xaminmo,2012-05-20T14:40Z,"Video is better than all but one other torrent.  Still filtered and a little dark, but much better.  Has some Chinese subs hardcoded, but not bad.  For CAM/TS, Video is an 8+

Audio is TS audio, no echo, very clean.  Audio includes the starting intro, which the other mid-may TS doesn't have.  Audio drifts a little, about 1/2 second by the end of the movie.  This might be codec related, since skipping around seems pretty good.  Calling Audio a 9.

To the other commenter, this is a CAM/TS.  There's no way this could/would be truly High Def."
