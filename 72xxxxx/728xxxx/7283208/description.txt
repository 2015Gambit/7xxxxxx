Timbercreek, a young band of ruffians who hailed from the small town of Boulder Creek (pop. 4081), nestled deep in the Santa Cruz Mountains of Northern California, recorded this lost country-rock gem with a for-real-not-ironic-rural-vibe in 1975. The small California indie label Renegade Records released the lp, and depending on whoΓÇÖs story you choose to believe, somewhere between 100 and 3,000 copies of Hellbound Highway were pressed. Needless to say, this record is very rare, and very, very good. If youΓÇÖre a fan of The Flying Burrito Brothers, The Band, The New Riders of the Purple Sage, or WorkingmanΓÇÖs Dead/American Beauty era Grateful Dead then today is your lucky day.
