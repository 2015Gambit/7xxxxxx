Life on Fire
Volcanoes are one of the most spectacular and powerful forces on our planet. They create new land, change landscapes and destroy civilisations, but more than two billion years ago they also breathed life into our world. From the ocean abyss to snow-covered summits, this ambitious series paints a detailed picture of the struggles and amazing intimacy required to survive around volcanoes. Spectacular scenery provides the backdrop for the extraordinary animals and plants that have learned to juggle with fire. Fragile and engaging, these creatures teach us lessons in survival in a world as fascinating as it is dangerous.




4)  Phoenix Temple 
Nicaragua, in the middle of Central America, is home to Masaya; a huge volcano that has been active for over 30,000 years. During its long life it has caused some of the largest eruptions in history. The surrounding landscape has been created from lava, ash and gas while at the centre lies a desolate, empty land. Each time the Masaya volcano destroys everything around it, life returns, re-emerging from the ash at its feet.
