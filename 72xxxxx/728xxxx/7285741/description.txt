The largest of the Ryukyu Islands that dot the Pacific Ocean to the south of Japan, Okinawa's serene natural beauty works in  harmony with the beats and bass lines of its thriving roots music scene, reflecting an independent spirit which has survived centuries of foreign influence. Ryukyu Underground takes this principle one step further by using samples of original recording from local labels and transporting them into uncharted territory, creating dance, electronica, jungle, soul, jazz and hip-hop swim in the mix with elements of Indian, Afrobeat, and Japanese traditional music, to create a uniquely globed sound direct from the Ryukyu Underground.
