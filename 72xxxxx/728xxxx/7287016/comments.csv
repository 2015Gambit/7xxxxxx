I was looking for that race searching with MotoGP 2012 and it was not coming up. Maybe next time you could name it something like:

04.MotoGP.2012.France-Le Mans.Moto2.Race as the series is named MotoGP in one word. ;-)"
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-22T00:16Z,"You are welcome bro! But I have something to tell you. I hope you don't mind. If I can put my work to up these things, you can make at least 2 searches with ""motoGP"" and/or ""moto"". My work it takes more than 2 searches. I can't think of all possibilities of your searching. Right? Enjoy it! ;-)"
