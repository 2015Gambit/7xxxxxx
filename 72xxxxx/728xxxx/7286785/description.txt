At the beginning of your card set you display a blue backed deck and place it into your pocket for later. You then remove a red deck and blow everyone away with all your hottest stuff. Just before you end you suggest an experiment, a long shot if you will. Something that, should it work will guarantee many a sleepless night. You ask a spectator to just THINK of ANY CARD. Then you ask them to just THINK of ANY NUMBER between 1 and 52. The choices are written on the back of a Joker and left in plain view for all to see. You propose that you will, through shuffling and cutting, position the card they thought of in the exact position they named. They seem unimpressed. ThatΓÇÖs when you ask them to think back to the blue deck from way back before any of this began. That deck is removed and handed to a spectator. She counts cards to the table face up, one for each number. Everyone holds their breath as the last card is reached. When it is turned overΓÇªit is the thought of card!
