,Jblanch91,2012-07-20T19:19Z,"Hey, I was wondering if anyone knows how I can get this to work when I'm already using CFW. This seems to only be for upgrade OFW to CFW but nothing on CFW to updated CFW. Currently using 5.50 GEN-D3 but Birth By Sleep seems to need something higher. Any help would be appreciated."
,SoraFan96,2012-07-22T23:08Z,"Upgrade your PSP to the newest version and follow the steps below, all who have had the firmaware you have, haven't gotten kingdom hearts birth by sleep final mix to work, but this will do it for sure :)"

,Rax603,2012-09-20T03:23Z,"Hi, my problem is similar to Jblanch91`s but I can't update my PSP in any way. I tried network update and I downloaded the OFW and put it on the PSP but it won't update neither it always says it doesn't need to update because it's on version ""9.90"". I try to run the game but the PSP shuts down in 7 seconds after I launch the game.  Please help, I`m running on 5.50 GEN-D (Full) I have been dying to play this game. I hope for a reply as soon as possible, Thanks!"
