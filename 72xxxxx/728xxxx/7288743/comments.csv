btw, what converter do u use? u always seem to get them to be the right size.

I use winxdeluxe and sometimes they become so big."
[V],psspss,2012-05-22T05:45Z,"i use various.. umile does it quick and simple
but sometimes have to resync them using avidemux.org

depends if you do 2 pass or constant bitrate

bitrate 1008 seems to work out the right size "
[V],psspss,2012-05-22T12:30Z,"just watching it now.. bumma again.. seems to loose some sync for about 1min after first ad break..
must of been some dropped frames where it was cut and converter
didnt like them. its minor though..
seems correct soon after though.

another great episode.."
[V],psspss,2012-05-31T03:49Z,"to be safe from media coys

get yourself a VPN in a safe country most cost $5 a month

some vpns dont keep any records at all and some pass on the notices
but not your private details

see a list on torrentfreak
iots a good site for news and how tos

peer guardian 2 can help reduce fake data and stop them connecting
but wont hide ip/.. but best to use that with a vpn also

dont know whats wrong with these tv makers.. they dont offer
the content to buy and download online from any coutnry and bitch eve when the quality of a video is
worse then a fvf or blu ray

anyhow nbc? doubt it.. its syfy beware some fake notices get emailed too."
