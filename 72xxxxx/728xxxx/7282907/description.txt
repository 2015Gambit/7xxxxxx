Description

With both defensive midfielder Luiz Gustavo and left back David Alaba suspended for the Champions League Final, an irregular starter for Bayern Munich could find a starting place. Croatian international Daniel Pranjic only has nine starts and 16 total appearances for Bayern this season, but due to his ability to play either central midfield or left back, Jupp Heynckes will be tempted to put him in the lineup.

The question is, where? Who does Heynckes have less faith in, Anatoliy Tymoshchuk or Diego Contento? Could he opt to start Pranjic in midfield just so he doesn't have to take Toni Kroos out of his preferred No. 10 spot? None of Bayern's options are idea with Luiz Gustavo and Alaba unavailable, but Pranjic's versatility means that Heynckes won't have to play a completely makeshift lineup.

Thomas MÃ¼ller is one of the 11 best available players for Bayern, so it makes sense that they would rather move Kroos deep to fit him into the lineup, rather than starting Pranjic, but moving Kroos might alter the team significantly. Bayern Munich has struggled when Kroos plays deeper in midfield, alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger, and Pranjic could allow them to keep Kroos in his preferred place.
