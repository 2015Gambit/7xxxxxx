Anyone...?"
,0rochimaru,2012-05-20T00:37Z,"Game works.  Just install and play - already cracked (Win7).

Notes:
- seems to be poorly optimised, fps -wise
- no local multiplayer or LAN
- comical Arnie commentary option
- visuals are nice-ish
- HDD hog (6.2Ggb)

Verdict:
5.5/10. Download Split/Second instead."
