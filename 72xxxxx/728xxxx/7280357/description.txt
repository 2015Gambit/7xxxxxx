Packed with a range of DJ bag essentials from original vocal tunes, hands-in-the-air anthems to instantly recognizable (but retooled) classics and deep club tracks, SERGE DEVANTΓÇÖs appropriately titled second album REWIND (Ultra Music) takes a trip back in time to those wild nights of his youth, and the sounds that made them come alive.

ΓÇ£When I came to New York, it was the mid-ΓÇÿ90s and the club scene was simply amazing,ΓÇ¥ remembers the Russian native of his entry into the legendary nightlife scene of the times. ΓÇ£I really dove in headfirst. Tunnel, Sound Factory, Twilo, Palladium, Limelight ΓÇô all of those clubs were open and driving dance music. It inspired me to get my first set of turntables and start DJing when I was 17 and still in high school.ΓÇ¥
