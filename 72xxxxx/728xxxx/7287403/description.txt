This is the first book to be devoted exclusively to rare tumors in children and adolescents, and its aim is to provide up-to-date information on their diagnosis and clinical management. The opening section addresses general issues including epidemiology, risk factors/etiology, biology and genetics, early detection, and screening. It also discusses solutions to assist in the management of rare tumors, such as international networking and internet platforms. In the second section, specific malignancies are described, with practical guidance on diagnostic workup, multimodal therapy, follow-up, and adverse effects. Discussion of differential diagnosis encompasses both frequent and rare tumor types, which should enable the clinician to take rare entities into account during the diagnostic assessment. Each chapter goes on to provide detailed therapeutic guidelines for specific rare tumors. The authors are a multidisciplinary group of specialists who have dedicated themselves to this group of tumors.
