,MasslV,2012-05-23T00:24Z,Wasn't Snowwhite supposed to be the pretty?
,t2BeDLaM,2012-05-23T00:44Z,"peeps complaining about the lag in audio. Trust me. its you. Download the ""combined community codec project""  just google it.
But installs all the codecs to play anything and installs the windows media hacked version 6. Awesome.
Never have a prob. 
Fair warning, I would uninstall any codecs you installed before you install this one."
,HelloMynameisV,2012-05-23T02:42Z,Thank You Hackulus!!! Live long and Prosper! 
,Kiriyama87,2012-05-23T05:55Z,"Thanks for the torrent!

Or you can just install VLC media player. lul.

,sudopinion,2012-05-23T18:41Z,Good movie. Smells like bollywood.
,darki699,2012-05-23T19:55Z,"Upside - Definitely R5. Very watchable. Good going Hackulus. =))

Downside - Audio is out of sync by 100ms
Also some audio hiccups during the movie, but still very good job ^^.

I rate this in comparison to other R5 I've seen:

V - 9
A - 7
M - Pretty good, not unexpected."
,mavrick-ace,2012-05-24T04:27Z,"OK,
V 10
To fix audio sync when playing movie on WD Media centre, use VirtualDub- a free program, and set the ms value to -300.
look on youtube on how to setup- use.

,epicfrog,2012-05-24T07:25Z,"the music to the movie sounds pretty out of key, audio is slightly out of sync, I personally prefer the kmplayer but vlc seems to play it just fine. video is really good. also, I burned it to a dvd and the audio is just out of sync enough to annoy you. "
,bon_bon80,2012-05-24T14:12Z,"Awesome picture quality - 10.
Sound was a bit off in a few places, but it didnt stop me watching it and I'm not complaining because i got to see this for free.

Keep up the awesome work Hackulus!!!"
,Copyleft2P2MAGE,2012-05-24T21:27Z,"the audio has parts out of sync and small gaps with no audio at all. but watchable

V-9
A-7

M -4 sucks balls... the end most of all :D"
,realawesomedude,2012-05-24T23:45Z,"A JUST WANNA FUCK SNOW WHITES BRAINS OUT OF HER HEAD !!!! , ITS LIKE SWEET TEEN PORN BUT WITHOUT THE ACTUAL PORN SCENES ONLY THE FOREPLAY , SHE IS LIKE A SWEET BARBY DOLL READY TOO GET FUCKED "
,highlander888,2012-05-25T09:43Z,"Thanks for the upload!

The sound keeps dropping out or repeating/echoing in several places though.

V: 9
A: 4

Movie was OK except for eyebrows and the Bollywood ending. WTH? :)

,minastirith,2012-05-25T15:41Z,Audio is out of sync. use VLC and hit 'l' or 'k' till its right. 
,QWESTSUX,2012-05-26T09:32Z,Why all the Snow White craze lately. I'm waiting for Charlise Therone and her horrific british accent
