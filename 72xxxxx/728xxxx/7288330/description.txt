[color=red]Plot[/color]

You have to admire the ingenuity of this low-budget British film written 
and directed by musician Johnny Daukes: it is spoken entirely in rhyming 
verse. Set almost all in one place  a hotel, where a too-nice salesman 
(Iain Robertson) has been sent on a motivational seminar  Daukes's film 
is certainly likable, but can't quite get round the static, stagey nature 
of the material. Much of the action is marooned in the seminar room and 
hotel restaurant as it flits between one supporting character and another, 
with narrator Simon Callow provides light relief of varying effectiveness. 
Things only properly kick off in a frantic farce-like finale; by then the laboriousness of the plotting has taken its toll.
