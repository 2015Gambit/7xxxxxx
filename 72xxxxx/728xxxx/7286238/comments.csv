I had to fix that release myself though.
Its another 2HD release with audio out of sync.
It was out of sync exactly 500 milliseconds (half a second)

This video seems perfectly fine to me
And i think I did an awesome job fixing ep 3"

Metalocalypse is my all time favorite TV show i think :)

I know its popular so I'm suprised how long it takes for people to rip the show and upload it.. sometimes it takes days.. mean while lame ass tv shows are up'd within minutes of airing lol"
