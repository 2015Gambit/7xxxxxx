,coolbeans69,2012-05-25T08:26Z,"Video plays choppy on pc, ps3, and tv. Somethings off with this rip. I've downloaded others from Feel-Free that didn't have this problem and were very high quality. So thanks and keep up the good work but as for this one..

A/9
V/6  Very good clarity but frame rate is bad and I know its not my hardware."
,LemCaution,2012-06-04T07:22Z,"Vouch for what coolbeans wrote, which is too bad because it was sharp as hell otherwise.

Choppy on WDTV SMP and in K-Lite."
,fillinthisspace,2012-06-09T14:50Z,"Yep, as mentioned this encode isn't smooth. There's repeated frames which makes the motion choppy in places. I'm not sure why.... but I'd look for an alternative."
