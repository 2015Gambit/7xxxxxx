You will need Unarchiver or UnRarx or something to unrar the rar file. This DEFINITELY works on Snow Leopard, not sure about Lion. And yes, it is only 800 mb and not three gigabytes because it is the NON-STEAM version and does not have the entire source engine. I will be seeding for a long time. If you do manage to download the file be nice and seed."

,omgfb,2012-05-22T04:45Z,"Comment if it works or not :)

And yes, it DOES work on lion, tested on sis's laptop, when she wasn't looking, naturally :)

SEED SEED SEEEEEED"
,L3gitJA,2012-05-22T05:39Z,Works perfectly!!! Except there's one problem. I can't see through the portals. Any way to fix this?
,omgfb,2012-05-22T13:28Z,"If you can't see through the portals its most likely your graphics card's problem. Try to change the portal render settings in ""options."" Or try to google the answer :)"
,PurpleStuff,2012-05-24T00:19Z,"Same prob.. can't see through portals :(
everything else works fine!
but the game is not playable like this... :("
,Darkvern,2012-06-05T13:01Z,Forgive my ignorance but i just downloaded the torrent unrar the file slid the app into my applications folder when i double click on the app nothing happens doesnt open .. am i missing something i need to get this working ?
,Darkvern,2012-06-05T13:32Z,never mind please ignore my previous comment turns out my problem was i didnt use UNarchiver i used ZIPEG ( tho it unrar's files ) the app only worked after using Unarchiver ... great torrent thanks
,francismcgvrn,2012-07-02T18:01Z,"Ok, the game was working good and then I clicked 'run in a window"". Now it is still fullscreen but small in the corner with black around it. I don't mind that, but the game is flashy and i can see through walls. I cannot go back to fullscreen because the options won't click. Everything else I can click. The portal gun works also but the options will not click. Help?"
,Dr_Cyborg,2012-07-08T07:12Z,***THIS IS NOT THE MAC NATIVE VERSION!!!!!!*** Its the WINESKINNED WINDOWS PC version!!!!!!! Just right click and goto to show resources on the binary to see what I mean.  I don't have a problem with wineskin or wrappers but I DO HATE IT when someone claims its NATIVE when it MOST certainly IS NOT!!!!!! 
,omgfb,2012-08-06T20:26Z,"@Dr_Cyborg My bad, I didn't create this torrent, my friend did, and I didn't bother to check (XD) but it's waaaaaaaaaaaaay better than the other wrappers and does not have ten million graphical bugs. It runs really well, even on my weak little Macbook Air."
,jcl94,2012-08-12T18:26Z,"Did anyone solve the ""can't see through portals"" problem?  Im having the same thing happen, only I noticed that sometimes I have a floating portal than I CAN see through to the other side of the portal.  Like, I have a portal on the wall that I cant see through, but I have a glitchy floating portal 5 feet off the wall that I can see through but can't interact with.  Anyone know how to fix?"
,Cradlejack,2012-08-13T02:39Z,"Tried all the settings for portal rendering, still does not work. I'm getting the same glitchy portal 5 feet away. Great quality otherwise, I would appreciate a way to fix this."
