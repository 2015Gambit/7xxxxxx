A Little Deeper is the platinum selling Mercury Prize-winning debut album by English R&B/hip hop singer and rapper Ms. Dynamite, released on 10 June 2002. It has sold 495,000 copies in the United Kingdom since its release.

Dynamite made her name as the UK's best female garage MC. She was single-handedly responsible for making Sticky's Boo! a top-twenty hit in 2001 and looked set to become the next big thing from the UK's two-step scene. Instead, the 21-year-old North Londoner shipped herself off to New York and made an album of R&B. While A Little Deeper is good it pales alongside competition from artists such as Lauryn Hill, Mary J Blige or the similarly youthful Alicia Keys. Dynamite's natural blend of ragga, hip-hop and garage chat has virtually disappeared to be replaced by a semi-decent nasal singing voice. The only thing that now differentiates Dynamite from her American contemporaries is that she swears more. The addition of played-out US rapper Nas on "Afraid To Fly" is another sign that A Little Deeper is a prepackaged product for American consumption. The album has a couple of outstanding moments, particularly on "Dy-na-mi-tee" when this oldest of 11 brothers and sisters soulfully narrates the tale of her upbringing. "The Natural High" interlude is also spine-tingling as she slips back to her pirate-radio roots in a tirade against drugs. At 55 seconds it's not enough, leaving the album more sparkler than Dynamite. --Jake Barnes
