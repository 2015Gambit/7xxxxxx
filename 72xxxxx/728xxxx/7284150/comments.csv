,Obake9,2012-05-24T14:13Z,"Hey Slicknick. First of all, Thank you so so much for always uploading the races!! Makes my week, every week.

Also, I know a lot of other people are having trouble finding moto 1. Any chance you'll be uploading moto 1 for this race? Or possibly any future races?

Not complaining, I'm grateful for all that you do for the community. But I miss being able to download the races straight from you. Thanks!"
