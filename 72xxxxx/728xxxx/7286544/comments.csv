,McPay,2012-05-23T14:55Z,"Please, stop asking me about SD-Versions!
I never did and never will be uploading SD-Stuff.
I only do HD quality uploads!
If you want SD, use Google!!!"
,2ndzone,2012-06-09T08:08Z,"The uploader, you could simply convert this to .MKV format using formatfactory to reduce the size to 200MB with loss of quality"
,stgclawson,2012-06-19T18:33Z,"Thank you for the great upload!  Episode 6 aired on a different night than usual (6/15), but no one has uploaded it yet.  Is that something that you could upload for us?"
