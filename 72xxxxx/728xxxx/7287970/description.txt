Synopsis: I used to be a bedroom DJ a while back. I have used multiple software
for mixing as well. From a DJ .. i can honestly tell you. .. this is the best
mixing software out there. The competition software are too bulky, and more
worried about the appearance. MixMeister is simply the most user-friendly, so
you can worry about the mixes and not working the software.

As for the video aspect.. i have no experience on that.. 
MixMeister Fusion supports audio & video mixing.. thus the price differential.

Note: you can search "MixMeister" on YouTube to see this in action.
