and whats the solution? can u help me?

thx, and sorry for bad english"
,krisrdj,2012-06-26T13:15Z,Can you tell me which os version you have? It doesn't create an emulated hard drive. Try installing newer if this one doesn't work and follow the instructions as written. When everything is installed correctly when running zemax it will display some warnings and messages but it will work
,ItsMeFck3rs,2012-09-13T22:03Z,"Hi, thanks for this torrent. The installation goes fine, but when I try to launch the program it gives an error window: ""Invalid temp directory path: C:Program Files (x86)ZEMAXTEMP
Please create this directory!"" I checked, the temp directory is there and the permissions seem all right. I click ok, another window pops up: ""Can't open File C:Program Files (x86)ZEMAXGLASSCATARCHER.BGF!"" One of these windows appears for each file in the glass catalog. After I click through every damn one of them, the Zemax splash screen shows up, then another window: ""Cannot find ZEMAX key.
The driver may not be installed.
Would you like to open the ZEMAX Knowledge Base for assistance?"" But the program doesn't launch. Actually, it looks like something launches momentarily but immediately closes. What should I do? Any suggestions would be appreciated."

I also tried copying all the Zemax program files from a school computer and bringing it to the computer where the key was installed. But since the school has the latest version, I get a window that says ""Enter the license code for Version July 10, 2012 Serial 23452 Standard Edition."" This seems to indicate that the key is installed correctly but Zemax isn't. But I didn't see any errors when installing.

 What should I do? Any suggestions would be appreciated."
