Talks at Krishnamurti Brockwood 1978

Its me again pushing as fast as I can to make available such good talks with Krishnamurti.

1. Can I Strip Myself of the Network of Language size. 20.6 mb, 1h:30m:20s

2. How is Freedom to be Understood and Lived size.     17.7 mb, 1h:17m:42s

3. How is One to Have Complete Order.                  15.7 mb, 1h:08m:38s

3. The Beginning of Meditation.                        18.8 mb, 1h:22m:09s



I really like the fact that these talks come in such a small file size.

War is no good. This has nothing to do with peace. Its just a fact.

To see through the eyes of a God is to become a second hand human being.



The past is only what is stored in the mind. And there is no such thing as future.
We need to understand that the only thing that exsist is the present. And has always been the present.

We dont need the past to see what is dangerouse in the present.

It doesnt take religion to understand that sleeping with another mans wife is no good. And very dangerous.

The creator has set a clear and unshakable reality set of rule. 

One rule is it doesnt take a bible to know that killing another man is no good whatsoever.

There is nothing in our body parts that we are born to murder another man.
We are not born with a nife comming forth from our hands.

The knowlege of the past destroys man kind.

We are humans. Not Solders. 

Those who understand spread the word.
