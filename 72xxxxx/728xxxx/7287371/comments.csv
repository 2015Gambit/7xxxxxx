,vivacissamamente,2012-05-22T08:25Z,"This will sound stupid, but in terms of picture and sound quality, what's the difference between this file and the 5.34 GiB version, also by DibyaTPB?"
,cayrikan,2012-05-22T14:52Z,"this is compressed and made progressive. properly mkv. dont know how it fares compared to the other, only that this file is less problematic. "
,thebeav111,2012-05-25T05:44Z,where is the 1080 source coming from?  I thought cable companies only transmitted 720p?
,bg10,2012-05-28T06:26Z,Thanks! I'll seed for a couple of weeks!
,vivacissamamente,2012-06-02T09:05Z,"Thanks, cayrikan. I looked at both but couldn't tell the difference by sight alone.
