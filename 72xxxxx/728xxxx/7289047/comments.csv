,SandRunneR,2012-05-22T11:33Z,"Why don't you upload the individual games only? It's a little difficult to download every game over and over, since I can't choose which game to download over magnet links.

Anyway, thanks for the effort, waiting for the Lakers @ Thunder game."
,skyvillage,2012-05-22T11:59Z,"Sandrunner, you can go to another torrent site and get the regular torrent links--just search over there for this torrent"
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-22T12:01Z,"You all are welcome, bros!
@SandRunneR: I have wrote about that many times, but you, people, don't bother to read the description of the game and/or my/other's comments. I have wrote why I do upload that way and how do you can download only the last game of the torrent, even with magnet link. Cheers bro!"

[V],Nepotu,2012-05-22T17:52Z,"@Dimmis: I decided to ignore any comment of him because he insulted me. I don't read anything from him and I don't comment his action. When you talk to a resonable person and you ask him something decent, that person will understand, but the garden of God is very big and many jumps his fences. I advice you all not to read comments until you have seen the game. Cheers, bro!"

,mentallyours,2012-05-23T11:56Z,"lmao. THE FACTS: Brandon Bass had 18 of his 27 points in the third quarter, keying a second half comeback for the hosts as the Boston Celtics defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 101-85. With the win, Boston takes a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series. Bass matched his career high with the 27 points, and Kevin Garnett added 20 points and six rebounds as the Celts' cooled off a hot-shooting Sixers team in the second half, limiting them to just 35 points after the break. Rajon Rondo (13 points, 14 rebounds) added a double-double as Boston broke open the game in the fourth quarter, leading by as many as 20 points before coasting to the win. Elton Brand had a team-high 19 points for the Sixers in the defeat"
