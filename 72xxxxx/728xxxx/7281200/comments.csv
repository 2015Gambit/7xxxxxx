I miss the ""raw"" John Mayer from earlier in his career. I miss the rock and pop, a small mix would be better. Still a good album though, thx l3endik"

There is a new, more spiritual John Mayer and you hear that so clearly in every second of this album. Astonishing!

The music from ""Continuum"" where amazing in a pop-rock context, in that I agree with you. However this album is more organic and made of true deep love and compassion. 

Thanks for uploading!
