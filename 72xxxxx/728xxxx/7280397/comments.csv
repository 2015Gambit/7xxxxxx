,Vulcan219,2012-05-19T10:19Z,I hope to find an all english version soon and will post that as well if I find it soon enough.
,spara666,2012-05-19T13:03Z,"Downloading now, just watched the sample and its pretty good. I'd give the sample 7/10a/v"
,Vulcan219,2012-05-19T14:46Z,"Thanks for the input, I did what I could with it and hope it works well when you get the whole thing, I tried to sync the audio a little better than the version I got it from, I am currently working on bringing the audio from this one to another Chinese version of it I got that has a little better video, but its audio goes in and out of Chinese, unless people think this one is good enough. I am going to keep working on ripping the audio from this one to use on the other one, and re-encoding it with the Subtitles I made, I don't know yet if I am going to compress it down to a smaller size yet, I want to see how it turns out with the complete audio transfer, also working on cleaning up the audio a little more too."
,Vulcan219,2012-05-19T14:47Z,"Forgot to say this, let me know how it plays when you get the whole video, again thanks."
,spara666,2012-05-19T16:54Z,"It plays well Vulcan, thanks very much! :)"

,Vulcan219,2012-05-19T20:44Z,"@ Xandror

I am working on a better one with better video, and so far most all I have found has audience laughter in it, they are cam rips, not DVD rips, one can only clean up so much when encoding and re-encoding, but I am working on a better viewable copy now, but it takes time to encode videos and to hard code the subtitles."
,grphdsgnr,2012-05-20T01:31Z,course you won't find a freakin dvd copy!! it JUST came out yesterday ya jackhole!!

,Vulcan219,2012-05-22T08:13Z,"Almost have the better version ready, it is better on the visual and I tried to clean up the audio a little more, and working on the subtitles, when done i will upload and hope all like it better, also anyone need custom subs made for their movies in any particular language, get with me and I wil make the subs for you as well. And thanks to all who helped to seed this for me, I hope the next version, you will like better."
