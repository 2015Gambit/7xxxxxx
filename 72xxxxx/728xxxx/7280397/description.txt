My first upload, I took one of the better Chinese cam rips and re-encoded it,and compressed it some to take up less room, also I hardcoded the English descriptive subtitles where there is writing and such so english speaking and reading people can understand what is written or what is shown that has the Chinese text in it. Couldn't remove the Chinese text as it was hard coded to the movie.

This isn't a fake or contain any virus, it doesn't send you to a website to get the code to unlock the rar or zip, to me people who upload movies in that way are lame. This is a legit upload and will guarantee it, besides why would I risk being banned when I am using my Username to upload?

I hope all enjoy the movie...
