Antiques Uncovered
When we look at an antique, we often don't look much beyond its surface beauty and appearance, apart from maybe questioning its value? Some of these Antiques started life as purely practical objects, whilst others were purely for decoration and an expression of wealth. But whether they're from a stately home or a two up and two down, they unlock a fascinating history of the way we lived then and now, of our lives past and present In Antiques Uncovered (working title) historian, Dr Lucy Worsley is going to uncover the stories behind some of these remarkable objects and how they relate to our lives today. Antiques expert Mark Hill will be looking at why some items have become priceless, while others are waiting in the wings to become the collectables of tomorrow.
