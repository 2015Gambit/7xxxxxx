"The Telling"

It seems like Frankie truly has eyes in 
the back of her head when she busts both 
Sue and Axl for making some bad choices 
that they thought no one would ever find 
out about. But when it turns out that 
she's using Brick to be her snitch, Mike 
is completely against it. Meanwhile, 
Axl's weekend getaway to the lake is in 
peril when Sue discovers him sneaking 
into the house in the middle of the night 
and coerces him into doing whatever she 
commands -- otherwise she will tattle on 
him; and when Frankie is stuck at work, 
Mike is forced to attend Parent Day at 
Brick's school.
