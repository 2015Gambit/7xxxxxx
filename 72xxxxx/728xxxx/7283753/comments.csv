,Dimmis80,2012-05-20T12:52Z,Hey Nepotu my friend.I have a sugestion dude.I was watching game 3 of Thunder vs Lakers and like other games i have seen the screen with the other results that drops and i learned the score of an another game that i wanted to see game 4 Celtics vs Sixers.And now i kinda lose my interest about that game that i wanted to watch but btw i will watch it to see how they went there but there is not the same thing that when i did not know who wins..!So can u tell to the Rippers if they can dellete from the game-videos that screens for the other games.?I think those screens with the other results are fun killers or something.??Thats my sugestion and congrats for the weekends releases to u and for the rippers.Cheers. 
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-20T17:03Z,"Dear friend, I have put some work to up these games with his own descriptions like starting lineups, photos, including # of playoffs game. It's not mine or rippers fault that you don't have patience to watch those games in that order (the order that they've played). Sorry!"
,Dimmis80,2012-05-20T17:52Z,Dear friend its not that i don't have the patience but i don't have the time to watch all the games in order other teams than i watch and i only care and support Lakers-Celtics and Heat..Anyways if u can't do or if rippers can't do its ok.It was just a sugestion.No wories.
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-20T18:05Z,Great game!
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-20T18:42Z,"But if you won't watch all the games then what's the problem? Only you have to watch the game who is played first and that's it, even if those games are Lakers, Celtics or Heat's games. The rippers won't change anything. I know that was only a sugestion, but I can't change anything, my friend. I'm not mad at you. Cheers, bro! ;)"
,Dimmis80,2012-05-20T18:50Z,And ofcorse i am not mad at u to my brother..Here at home we love u mate..Cheers dear friend.:-)
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-20T21:44Z,":) I'm glad to hear that! And I love you all, my friends."
