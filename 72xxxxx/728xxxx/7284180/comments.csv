,X111,2012-05-22T16:46Z,"tar is a compression technology used to create a Tape ARchive. The resulting file is known as a tarball.

If you have Window, this is the same as a Zip file. You use winzip to compress and uncompress .zip files.So its the same idea.

BTW  Great torrent a million thanx :)"

,SuspectZero,2012-05-22T23:19Z,"You can also use a free open source program called p7zip. its also called just 7zip. Then to read the comix, get yourself a comic book reader. For linux I use Comix, it works great."
,SuspectZero,2012-05-22T23:25Z,"use p7zip to open the archive, then use a free comic book reader such as Comix to read the .cbr files. (comic book files)"
