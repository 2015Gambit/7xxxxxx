Welcome to the glory that is SFTBH! or, Songs From the Black Hole. It was intended to be released before Pinkerton, but never was.

This is a rock opera created by Rivers Cuomo of Weezer that tells the story of Jonas and his love for Maria. Also in the story are his 2 fellow cadets named Juan and Dondo.

I realize that this is not the original track list. in fact there are 2 track lists created by Rivers. What i did was meld the 2 together to create a proper story. (You might note that i removed 'Lisa' from the list because that song is not directed towards Maria like the rest of the album.

This is my first torrent. Enjoy!
