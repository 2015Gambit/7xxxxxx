Marshall is turning 30 and working at a dead-end job with a boss who doesn't recognise his talents. After seven years with his boyfriend, Gabriel, Marshall's love life is stuck in a rut and he is desperate for something new. 

He goes looking for it online, where he comes upon a mysterious app that guarantees to find true love. It scans every inch of his online world and suddenly turns his life upside down. Marshall suddenly gets everything he thinks he wanted.

Newly single and ready for adventure, Marshall is overwhelmed with sexy guys at every turn, each promising to be the man of his fantasies. But too much of a good thing may not be a good thing. He soon finds that all the attention is more than he bargained for. 

With the help of a wise and mysterious waitress, Marshall is given one last chance to listen to his heart and figure out what (and who) is really important.
