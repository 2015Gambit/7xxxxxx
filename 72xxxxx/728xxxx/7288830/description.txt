General Hammond summons Colonel Jack O'Neill out of retirement to embark on 
a secret rescue mission. O'Neill confesses that he disobeyed orders to 
destroy the Stargate on Planet Abydos, and that scientist Daniel Jackson may 
still be alive. Arriving on Abydos with his team, O'Neill meets up once again 
with the scientist, who has discovered a giant elaborate cartouche in hieroglyphics. 
All signs point to the fact that this is a map of many Stargates that exist 
throughout the galaxy - a development that makes the dream of the SG-1 team 
to travel throughout the universe in time a reality.
