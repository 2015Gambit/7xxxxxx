While the genre of Lithuanian sung poetry may not be one you would commonly come across within the British record industry, a step towards a rectification of these matters was made this week with the UK release of the debut album from singer and musician Alina Orlova. However, for anyone who has been following the progress of the 22-year-old singer/musician, the release will no doubt be accompanied by a sigh and a cry of 'Finally!'; Laukinis Suo Dingo, a title drawn from a teenage romance novel by Soviet Russian writer Ruvim Fraerman, was in fact released two years ago in Orlova's native Lithuania where she is now considered something of a celebrity.


Despite producing wonderfully accessible music, Orlova still possesses the rare ability to surprise her audience. Take, for example the dissonant touches in 'Vasaris' or the emphasis placed simply on the chords and melody in 'Paskutinio Mamuto Daina' when a full blown orchestral explosion might tempt a less refined musical mind. It's adventurous flourishes like these that make the listening experience that little bit more thrilling. If Alina Orlova wants to grace us Brits with her presence then perhaps it's time we brushed up on our Lithuanian. This one's for keeps.
