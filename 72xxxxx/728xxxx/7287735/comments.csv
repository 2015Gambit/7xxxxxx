Just a wide circle question:
Does anyone know a way to get V8 Supercars races, in any quality. The first two race weekends were uploaded in full length to youtube but no more of that. So I've missed the last three races, it's so thrilling though, anyone who enjoys racing coverage will enjoy this. But I can't  find any normal downloads besides superslow restricted account ones (2GB/12hrs)"
