What a time. What a place. What a showman. The late 40's to the late 60's, Chicago's south side, the incomparable Junior Wells... Muddy, Elvis, Wayne Cochrane, Sonny Boy all rolled into one tough little cookie. This album is one sweet treat after another. If you can stay still listening to "Stomach Ache," you are clinically dead. It's a true joy listening to Junior and Buddy Guy but I really envy people in the future; they might be able to transport themselves back to 1964 and see Junior live in Pepper's Lounge.
