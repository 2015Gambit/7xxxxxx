,shaydock,2012-05-20T05:17Z,"""spastik"" is an appropriate username for you my friend.
let me give you a hot tip, if you are going to upload a torrent for thousands of people to download, then don't section the torrent off into ""1st half, 2nd half, extratime, penalties"". it's called a spoiler. just divide the whole file into 3 parts to download.
it's hard enough not being in english!"
