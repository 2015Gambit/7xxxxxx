Assalam-O-Alaikum !!!

Just thought to share this beautiful Qur'an software. It has 3 languages, Arabic,Urdu and English.
You can not only view it But also Listen to it.

It is a software based program which has many options. It is really good for those who want to learn Qur'an, may be best for Old people who want to listen to it.

Also i shared those Books in Previous thread. Plz note that if you come across any doubtful Hadiths, plz confirm it from those Books.

Plz remember, all those who contribute, in your prayers.

JazakAllah .... plz seed

Regards.
Health and Peace
