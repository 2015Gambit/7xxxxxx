                                   House

                            The Complete Season 8


An antisocial maverick doctor who specializes in diagnostic medicine does whatever it takes to solve puzzling cases that come his way using his crack team of doctors and his wits.

New plot points that have been shows already or are coming up include:

- House serves time in prison for his various misdeeds. It appears his total absence will lasts about one year: long enough for things to really be shaken up at Princeton-Plainsboro.
- House meets his new fellow to be, Jessica Adams, while in prison and brings her onto his team after his release.
- The shape of the team forms into something completely different, marking the biggest shift since Season 4. Both Dr. Adams and Charlyne Yi's new character Dr. Chi Park become fellows.
- It appears Thirteen moves off the team at least temporarily, and Olivia Wilde leaves the series to pursue other career options.
- Eric Foreman is acting as the new Dean of Medicine after Cuddy's resignation.
