Thanks, even if you can't get it as you have uploaded many amazing films of the finest visual quality and I am truly grateful."

[T],tr108,2012-05-26T17:50Z,"You're welcome everyone!

@supertje2011 - I won't be able to get to either of those flicks for a while, but remind me in August (when I suspect I'll have more time)

@andybenz - Ratatouille will def be upped - I'm gonna do all the Pixar flicks out on BD - but it'll take a minute. Please be patient. :)

@rogerguy01 - yeah, my gf wants to see The Lorax, so I'll def be doing that when it's available.

@dabadguy69 - I will be providing a step-by-step guide... um, eventually. Stay tuned."
