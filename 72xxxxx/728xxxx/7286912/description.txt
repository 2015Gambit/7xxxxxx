 DESCRIPTION:

 From Jakarta to Leiden, from Buenos Aires to New York, architecture provides much more than shelter it provides considerable cultural, political, and 
 philosophical meaning as well. With Cities Full of Symbols,Peter J. M. Nas brings together internationally renowned sociologists, social geographers, and 
 historians to debate the role of architectural symbols in the urban landscape. Looking specifically at 9/11 memorial designs, the design of the 
 city of Cape Town as a remnant of Dutch colonialism, and the image of the ship washed ashore by a tsunami in Banda Aceh, this volume will be of 
 interest to scholars of architecture, urban design, and policymaking.
