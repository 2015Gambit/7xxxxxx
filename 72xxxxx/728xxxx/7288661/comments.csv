,Gh057man,2012-05-22T04:54Z,What's the quality on this? The file size is significantly smaller than even an average Q 350Mb.
,Halizar,2012-05-22T05:09Z,"It's eztv. It will be good a/v. Also , the smaller size is due to it being mp4 and not avi file. That's how things are going to be now."
,driver-8,2012-05-22T05:32Z,The quality of the rip is dependant on the quality of your comment
,highpriest93,2012-05-22T05:49Z,any torrent that has LOL in the title will report your download to your internet provider.
,robrobweb,2012-05-22T05:56Z,"It was lupus the entire time???

Well that was freakin lame!"
,nic198419,2012-05-22T07:10Z,I know you must be kidding......you couldn't possibly be that big of an a-hole to ruin it for me. Downloading now will report back if he's really a jerk off or just frickin hilarious.
,acsmith1972,2012-05-22T07:18Z,"Hey Rob you dipshit, why don't you put ""spoiler alert"" before you post a comment about the end of the episode? Or better yet, go post on Suprbay if you need to talk about it so much. People like you need a good hard slap for posting stupid shit on here. "
,acsmith1972,2012-05-22T07:19Z,wtf?
,daeloki,2012-05-22T08:44Z,"@highpriest93 Wouldn't matter, they can report all they want, an IP address only narrows it down to a few thousand users of that ISP, they can not actually tell who exactly downloaded it out of the thousands who utilize that specific IP, Florida just had some Case Law on this issue backing this."
,theyfloatdownhere666,2012-05-22T10:18Z,final episode of house im gonna miss this show
,SayWhatNigga,2012-05-22T11:26Z,Is this a final episode? I thought it will be 2 hours?
,AlexGant,2012-05-22T12:54Z,Thnx eztv!!! :)
,tdawg2345,2012-05-22T22:06Z,"lol

NO SPOILERS HAVE BEEN POSTED, everything is fine"
,robrobweb,2012-05-23T02:41Z,"acsmith1972, sorry I ruined the show for you. 
"
,Polymathj,2012-05-23T06:14Z,"Okay, so this was only 44 minutes and I just checked, the final episode was 120 minus commercials.  Where did we lose the extra time?  

I just watched it and it seemed like a regular 60 minute show with commercials edited.  

What gives?"
,Polymathj,2012-05-23T06:22Z,"Just a little more effort showed there is the "" Swan Song"" that aired directly after.  It's a behind the scenes look at the characters and the talented actors who portrayed them.

Gonna miss this show...."
,cacomorales,2012-05-23T21:44Z,"as always great upload, thanks, just big bummer the series are finished"
,thc404,2012-05-23T22:12Z,"Rob is still waiting on an apology from those who called him names!

,Youdthinkso,2012-05-23T22:42Z,Best episode.. ever.
