Wake Up! is the fourth album by UK alternative rock band The Boo Radleys, released by Creation Records in 1995.

Although the band had received critical acclaim with their previous album, Giant Steps, Wake Up! was their first true commercial success, reaching number one in the UK album charts.[2] This was due in large part to two factors: the emergence of Britpop as a driving force in mid-1990s British music, and a catchy Top 10 single, "Wake Up Boo!"
