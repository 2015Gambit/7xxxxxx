1- Unrar
2- Install avc-ultimate.exe DO NOT start program yet after installation!
3- Unrar patch.davlat.rar
4- Create patch with any.video.converter.ultimate.4.x.x-patch.exe
5- Copy the avcultdrm.dll you just created to the program's installation folder & replace the original one:
- Windows 32-bit: C:Program FilesAnvSoftAny Video Converter Ultimate
- Windows 64-bit: C:Program Files (x86)AnvSoftAny Video Converter Ultimate
6- I went to > Edit > Options > Advanced and disabled ""Check for New Version of Program when Startup"".

Works great on my Win 7 64-bit Ultimate."
