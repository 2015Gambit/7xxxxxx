I just finished downloading this and everything seems to be working just fine, howerver I don't know how to switch the language of the movie. It's in japanese and I would like it to be in french or at least in english. Can you help me, please :) ? I'm using Final Media Player, wich plays MKV files."
,PYR4T3,2012-05-23T23:27Z,"@GrozoursVaniteux 
I would recommend any POPULAR FREE media player. 
VLC, MPC-HC, KMPlayer, GOM player, Jet Audio, Totem, BSPlayer, Zoom player, Core player etc. 
Can be easilly Switch Audio/Subtitle streams in normal players. 
As i believe one should have at least two of above players :) 

I have no experience with ""Final Media Player"" which should be AVOIDED as i know! 

Default audio track is set to ENGLISH in MKV settings, if u hear japanese that means ur player's default language is japanese or Jpn > Eng.. :)"

Install VLC or KMP 
Right Click Audio --> Audio Track :) 

Download

(My fav is Media Player Classic - Home Cinema but above two is good for Any general user!)"

,kotuwa,2012-08-22T20:09Z,"For KMPlayer and PotPlayer Users.
When switching AAC audio tracks, sometimes SKIW playback speed issues occur. (In any MKV with multi AAC streams).
To avoid it use Morgan Switcher.
(""Options → Preferences → Filter Control → Multi-Audio Streams"" and select ""Morgan Stream Switcher"". Or ""System Default"" may also work)"
