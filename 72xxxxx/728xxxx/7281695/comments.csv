forget all other crap"
,Llwynog,2012-05-21T03:37Z,"Thanks a lot for this. Naked AVIs are, by far, my favorite kind of TV torrent.
----------
As much as I love EZTV, and the functionally-equivalent VTV, they have started favoring MP4s and my PS3 refuses to play them for some reason so I need AVIs. So anyone who's willing to upload AVIs with no other crap included in the torrent ranks right up there with EZTV and VTV in my list of favorite uploaders."

My Xbox 360 will play MP4 format, so it seems odd to me that the Playstation will not. Something of a minor but unfortunate over-site. There are a number of MP4 to AVI converters available on this site, although it takes extra time on your end, if that's any help."

Now I use VLC and don't care what file extension is on the videos."
