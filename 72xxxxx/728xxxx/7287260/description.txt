Legendary duo John Doe & Exene Cervenka have been singing and playing together since 1977. As the primary writers for the seminal punk rock band 'X', together they've recorded some of the greatest albums in rock & roll history. They have two albums listed on Rolling Stone Magazine's ''500 Greatest Albums of All Time'', Los Angeles at #286 and Wild Gift at #334. For Singing and Playing, John & Exene wrote some new acoustic tunes and dug out some old X classics done in a completely unique way for this release. X will be opening for Pearl Jam in 2012.
