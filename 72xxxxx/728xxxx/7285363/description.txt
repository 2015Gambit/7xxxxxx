Like other psychiatric disorders, sexual addiction is a condition that affects peoples' relationships with others as much as it affects their own mental state. Individuals suffering from sexual addiction typically pursue sex through any means possible and often engage in risky forms of sexual activity such as exhibitionism, promiscuous sex with multiple partners, online sex, etc. It's easy to see how a couple's relationship may be challenged by the manifestations and reality of a disorder like this one. "A Couple's Guide to Sexual Addiction" discusses common relationship issues within the context of sexual addiction and provides the reader with exercises, information, and advice on the following topics: Trust; Communication; Healthy sexuality & sexual behaviors; and, Family. By understanding the reality of sexual addiction and what it means for a relationship, couples will be able to better relate to each other and plan for a successful future.
