[T],Snowhiter,2012-05-22T21:52Z,"If you're interested I will now also be uploading the original Israeli series 'Prisoners Of War' aka 'Hatufim' here on TPB with Hardcoded subtitles
This was the inspiration behind the US hit 'Homeland' but is a much more complex story.
Will upload 1 per week along with Season 2 of Braquo ;)"
