,Matibaba,2012-07-04T23:23Z,"i've extracted the meshes in the HB_Auth application, replaced the hosts then i run HB_Auth and honorbuddy but when i try to login he says invalid account details.
and in the HB_Auth comes: Do(1, ""accountname"" ""6b1b36cbb04b41490bfc0ab2bfa26f86"" ""2"" );
I really don't know what I must do"
