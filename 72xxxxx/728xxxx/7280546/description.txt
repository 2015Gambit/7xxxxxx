Includes some coverage of the FB IPO at the end. Haha! It gyrated up into the 40s and sank back to 38 by the close, such that their underwriting bank was forced to step in and support the price with buying per a prior agreement. Wonder what the stock will do once that stops? For all the roadshow hoopla, its welcome was tepid on the secondary market.
