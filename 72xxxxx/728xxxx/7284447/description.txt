This is a DVD-rip (x264 high-profile) of this torrent: 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7276310/BBC.Earth.Frozen.Planet.2011.4DiSC.SE.DK.Fi.iS.PAL.DVDR-TV2LAX9

The torrent above requires you to unpack each of the four DVD images in order to burn to DVD or mount as a virtual drive (extra time and software needed).


This torrent is ready to go (i.e. download and watch).

This torrent doesn't include subtitles though. And the spoken language is English.
But it does include extra DVD content (video commentaries).



BBC nature documentaries are awesome! This is one is narrated by David Attenborough (not a Discovery version narrated by Alec Baldwin).


Enjoy!
