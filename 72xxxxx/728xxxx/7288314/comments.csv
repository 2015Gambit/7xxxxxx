sigh..guess its really gonna take 10 years for the comic to even catch up to book no 5 aye?

the tv series is slow enough as it is..but with good visual effects

guess the comics will be for nostalgia sake and those hunger for more details..lol"
,kinger77,2012-06-15T09:14Z,Could you post issue 8 of this and the others as they subsequently come out as it doesn't look like anyone else will be? Please and thanks! :) keep up the work! I truly appreciate it! :)
