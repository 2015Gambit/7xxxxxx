there are only 3 albums the rest that i have are all redy on here all links are safe if u like steve green and steve camp there is anther bloke u may like steve grace he is an Australian i wont put his music up here because he only gets moony from donations. the 2 stores have different stuff the skypilot are a good duo at least 1 of them is steve grace's son they bot may be but I'm not certain. u will have to get rid of the 4 in the file name so it goes from this Steve Green 4 to Steve Green


if you have any albums that are not on here or that are on here that are corrupted can u please upload them.
