Film-noir. No subs.


I NEED YOUR HELP !!! (Bis)

I canΓÇÖt carry on uploading my collection of film-noir and trying to seed at the same time the old dead torrents I uploaded a month or even a week ago. I donΓÇÖt have the bandwith nor the time for that.

The result is that it takes a ridiculous amount of time to upload only ten movies, since it takes two to three days for people to download them. Morever, only a bunch of people can enjoy these movies (unless of course thereΓÇÖre available elsewhere) because the links become dead after just a few days. I try to seed them the best I can but again, I donΓÇÖt have the time for that.

So I might have to stop uploading those six hundreds film-noir because it is too much time-consuming; also, I donΓÇÖt see the point of all these efforts when only a bunch of guys can enjoy them. Unless you help me. Please, seed more. Seed more while you download the movies, accelerating tremendously this process, and seed more once your movies are downloaded. As you all probably know, the correct ratio Upload / Download is around 1.5, if you want to keep a torrent alive.

We can have here a great comprehensive list of film-noir, around 600 of them, if you help me build it. Sorry for the speech, and thanks in advance to those who understand the purpose of that. After all, thatΓÇÖs what all The Pirate Bay is about. Making entertainment and culture available to the largest number of folks.
