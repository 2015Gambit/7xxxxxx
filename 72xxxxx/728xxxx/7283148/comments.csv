,getting_there,2012-05-20T08:43Z,Can't believe this tournament didn't fall apart... Well it sort of did but anyways. Thanks!
,y3n007,2012-05-20T09:09Z,"what I can't believe is the size of this file, but I should not bitch I am getting to see it thanks to your upload....."
,The_Trancemaster,2012-05-20T10:05Z,6.88gb hahahahaha Wouldn't touch it with yours!!
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-20T11:46Z,"It's 720p, non-encoded transport stream(.ts) at 60FPS, and is 2 hours and 24 minutes long. That's almost two full movies. Yes, it's big. Of course. The file is unedited. Only thing I did was mux it into an MKV after cutting out the ads. This file can be used as a source to encode a smaller copy. Either that or simply just enjoy the beautiful quality 60FPS gives you. If you want the original .ts file, just extract it from the .mkv container using MKVToolNix's MKVExtractGUI."
,MMA-Enthusiast,2012-05-20T12:42Z,SEED PLEASE EVRYONE!
,Bellingham,2012-05-20T19:48Z,"badass Thank you..!! dont complain about file size, dont download if u cant handle it."
,mentallyours,2012-05-20T22:39Z,slo mothufukin download. always with these mma fights
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-20T22:49Z,"In 40 minutes, the file will be full of seeds and will be flying. "
,mikedongs,2012-05-21T20:27Z,"thanks! hey people quit bitching that it's 7 GB. this is full 720p quality, no bullshit. of course it's 7 fucking gigs! go get one of the other lower quality smaller torrents. and guess what, just because you see ""1080"" or ""720"" on a torrent title DOES NOT mean it's in the full resolution. they're usually shrunk."
,mikedongs,2012-05-21T21:50Z,"just fyi, i have some tiling going on when playing this video. it's pretty frequent and annoying. this is using VLC, i will try it in another player and report back.

it certainly isn't my CPU being weak, i have an AMD FX-8150 8-core running at 4.6 GHz."
,mikedongs,2012-05-21T21:57Z,"MPC-HC won't even play it at all, it says playing, but the time doesn't change and theres no picture or audio. great job with this torrent. wtf!"
,mikedongs,2012-05-21T22:02Z,"yeah, the AV stream is confirmed for missing data. my hashes for each chunk of the torrent match, so it's a bad stream.

thanks for the upload and all, but did you even check it to make sure it played back properly? i would stay away from this torrent folks. can anybody else confirm these problems?"
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-22T02:06Z,"@mikedongs
You may want to Force Re-Check in your torrent client. Seems to be only on your end. You probably downloaded it as a broken file. Sometimes torrents don't fully allocate and break during download. 

Check the CRC of the file you obtained. It should read 952c1122. If not, Force Re-Check and continue downloading it. The file works perfectly. Verify you have the proper codecs installed if playback issues continue to occur."
,banman,2012-05-22T02:55Z,"Fucking difficult for you just to make a normal file that plays on a highly competent media player?? (of course it plays on my computer, VLC) But for the growing number of people using mediaplayers in their livingroom, this is crap. Thousand of other uploaders manages to make playable files on every damn mediaplayer! 
Now you can curse me"
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-22T03:22Z,"If someone has such a big problem with the fucking MKV container, then extract the damn files using MKVExtractGUI and mux it into an MP4 using MP4Box or MeGUI. It's only a transport file. There's no encoding. .ts file are supported on everything. "
,mikedongs,2012-05-22T04:16Z,"SecTPB: it turns out the missing parts of the data are only in the first 5 minutes. after that the whole thing was fine, not one skip or tiling happened during the fights."
,mikedongs,2012-05-22T04:19Z,"i just want to tell everybody ignore what i said before, you'll be fine with this torrent. excellent picture and audio quality.

i noticed that VLC says the file is 120 FPS. i thought that was interesting. is every other frame just a dummy in the stream, or what?"
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-22T21:03Z,"I encoded a smaller-sized 720p h264 copy of this file in mp4. Still quality, but half the size and playable on all media players:
