,A.l.x.,2012-05-20T19:11Z,No 250 moto 1?
,KAR_1,2012-05-20T20:18Z,Thanks
,snakesweat,2012-05-20T20:21Z,1st moto or 2nd moto?
,A.l.x.,2012-05-20T21:28Z,It's moto 2
,slicknick610,2012-05-21T04:04Z,Watch the 1st motos live every week on allisports.com and they archive them http://www.allisports.com/motocross/event/hangtown/news/did-you-miss-1st-motos-want-watch-them-again
,Blueoctober712,2012-05-21T17:13Z,"The ""archive"" you speak of is fucking bull shit. You have to scroll through a ton of shit to find the moto 1 video and by the time you find it you saw already the title of a video that tells you who won. o yea and there is no 250 moto 1, just the start. Its fucking 2012 and yet the coverage of our sport is still blatantly retarded as ever. Can we just watch ALL the fucking ass shit on TV? The cover god damn polo and golf for crying out loud for hours"
,slicknick610,2012-05-22T00:09Z,I watched the 250 moto 1 last night. But yeah it is horrible design that you see who won first.
,KAR_1,2012-05-24T07:15Z,"Were you guys able to watch the full first moto in one continuous video?  I sure can't find it.  It just says ""full motos from Hangtown coming soon""  All I can find are a bunch of highlights and recaps.  I don't want to watch a race one pass at a time and out of order.  Very frustrating."
,Onkel_Micha,2012-05-26T23:45Z,YO Slicknick you def got this shit down and its awesome since it's not on the air here. I recently started to watch alot of this and Im wondering if you cant make packs of whole seasons as it would be wicked redonkulos great.....
