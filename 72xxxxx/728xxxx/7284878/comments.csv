,CrazyChef1,2012-05-22T02:07Z,"Nice App and Runs no prob.... BUT

AND IT IS A BIG BUT...

This App Requires 'ADMIN RIGHTS'...

It works GREAT, but to need Admin... WELL!!!!

Thanks for this, Fuken Gruven (get the funk down)... I love your work (and I don't say that often... trust me)

I'm guessing that the original app needs the same rights, but I do not know. It doesn't make any difference to me but it may to you!!!"
,Proud2bPirate,2012-05-22T23:16Z,"CrazyChef1, that's no probs, just right click and away ya go, admin rights......"

I just got this, photoshop, and illustrator cs6 all from you and they work great. I hope you could upload adobe contribute, or flash catalyst? "
,Hockeyboy946,2012-06-06T02:32Z,"Works as advertised :) For me I had to open the .paf by running as admin, but that's not a big deal. 

No problems to report thus far. Probably the best upload of this so far and the file size can't be beat. Thanks a lot uploader."
,batman79,2012-06-27T06:26Z,"It works, but it will also use 100% of one of your CPU cores due to it being cracked by a crackhead. 

So if you're on a 2 core system it will use 50% all the time. 4 core 25% etc. :"
