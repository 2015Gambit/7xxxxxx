,Namorax,2012-05-22T01:06Z,"a = 9 v = 7

This is about as good as a TS gets. Sync is out very slightly in parts, but the audio is definitely line. Video is nice, just the usual darks are too dark you get with a cam, but the focus is crisp as a cam gets.

Nice work, and someone might tweak it a little, but I would download this"

,FieroGT,2012-05-22T20:48Z,"i do appreciate this file. but have to say, the audio sync is all over the place.... i have to constantly adjust it every few mins.... video is nice. if only the sound were as trouble free. "

,senssuiy,2012-05-24T07:10Z,thanks man great movie..
,athren1988,2012-05-24T11:14Z,"Hey man thank you for a great upload. Decent for a TS, can't wait for the dvdrip. For those of you wanting finer audio, if you sync the audio -100ms it should be more in-sync with the movement of the mouths. "
