Facial contouring procedures are used to alter facial structures that have been damaged by aging, surgery, or trauma, and to correct facial areas that are congenitally misshapen, malpositioned, or un-esthetically proportioned. Vividly illustrated and written by prominent international authorities and pioneering experts on the topic, this unique reference acquaints surgeons with the most recent surgical approaches to enhance the face and neck, and provides an authoritative overview of the latest innovations in the development and utilization of facial implants, imaging technologies, and pre- and post-operative skin care methods.
