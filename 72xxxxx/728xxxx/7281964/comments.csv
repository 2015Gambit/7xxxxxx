I still think the jpeg is funny.. The pic has been added to a LOT of torrents.
Obviously somebody doesn't like you taking their releases / bandwidth extremezone ..but You know that already don't you lol

And can you nerds stfu about Diablo 3 please ?
How on earth do any of you expect an online role playing game to be cracked ?
Even it was I still wouldn't bother..
RPG style games are utterly retarded !
Excruciatingly boring lame nerdy BS .

I thought you guys were busy pulling it to SKYRIM ?
Every second topic on the net has the word Skyrim added to it and i guess we know what the new topic is lol

,deaderweterdog,2012-05-20T19:42Z,oh and for you stupid born of incest pig fuckers the way you crack a online game is caled private server   google it before you try to spread your ignorance on PB like you do crabs at your local uneducated hillbilly McDonalds squaredance

,OmniNegro,2012-05-21T02:22Z,"lets spend some time talking about Diablo 3 for no reason other than to annoy virtualretard258.

No one cares about that shit. But everyone with some sense hates idiots like him/her/it.

I hate the entire Diablo series. They suck almost as much as the retards saying they are uncrackable and we should all go buy a copy to live up to their own asshole standards.

And by the way, there is *NO* Skidrow website. That is a scam site. No scene group has a site anywhere. If they did, they would be shutdown overnight and spend the remainder of their lives in prison."
,xpmule,2012-05-21T05:08Z,"yup your right (about the skidrow site)
the fbi spends years tracking down group members and throwing them in jail.

@deaderweterdog
Your full of shit.. Private servers do NOT count as a crack.. thats stupid lol
And yeah I do know what I'm talking about because I'm a retired PC game cracker and I know some people that have put out some of the worlds best private servers / emulators and pc game cracks.
One of my associates is the guy that made the first WOW private server.

All I can say is the internet isn't gonna change.. I see the EXACT same stupid comments over and over and over forever

First off why does this topic have to converted into a ""insert current RPG pc game name"" topic ?
Go find somewhere else to spam about Diablo.. believe it or not, Not everyone like MMORPG's. Personaly I can't stand ANY of them.

Anyways when people are talking about a skidrow Diablo 3 crack I REALLY doubt they are asking about a ""Private server"" crack lol

Thanks for high jacking the topic with Diablo 3 garbage kids ;)"

,govermint,2012-05-21T23:40Z,"Wow can you all fuck off about diablo 3, this is a torrent about ""Gas Guzzlers Combat Carnage"", period end of story.

Okay ACTUALLY ON TOPIC: so this game is interesting, it could be alot better, it looked cool, started off cool, until I played it, the graphics were on high when I started, should be nice and easy for my system, but nope, the game lagged a bit, the lag between hitting the button to turn and the actual car realizing you pressed the turn button is about a good 2-3 second difference, which makes this game a serious pain in the ass, holding the turn button is even worse because your car will just spin out.

I tried all settings, medium and low still had the same lag for turning, is it just me or is this happening to others too?

my system specs are:
windows 7
intel core i5-2500k 3.3ghz
8gbs of ram
amd radeon hd 6790 1gb"

,sudchau12,2012-06-09T22:47Z,"@JK425 Thanks for the heads up man. The game gets exponentially better with explosive guns and kewl cars.

So I restarted the game, fixed it. I had this occur about 15-20 times before reaching the second grand tournament (tier 2) - it's just stuck on spinning cars on blue sky.

I do consider buying this game, though. It must be a lot of fun in multiplayer!"
,LuxiusDK,2012-06-19T14:24Z,"Anyway, where the hell can you buy this game? Except GameStop? I mean ... I tried Google, but it's almost impossible to find any outlets.
Even Gamepires have dead links (Origin does not sell this game ... anymore?)"
,LuxiusDK,2012-06-19T15:17Z,"UPDATE: It was bad map files. I re-installed the game (and even patched to 1.1, doesn't need crack) and now everything works fine again."
,LuxiusDK,2012-06-20T17:19Z,"This game rocks! I'm in late tier 2 (out of 3, as far as I could tell), cause I restarted the campaign twice. I had to try how hard hard could be - and I'm still winning races!

I'm old enough to remember Death Rally (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Rally), and few games of the kind have since given me the same euphoric experience. NFS came close with police chases. Destruction Derby for the PS1 comes to mind, as well. Honestly, this game gets a 10/10 from me, and I'm most probably going to buy and go online when I finish the campaign on hard. It's only about $20."
,LuxiusDK,2012-06-22T15:06Z,"I bought the game and I can only hope you do the same. This awesome racing experience has been developed over the course of 13 months by a team of only 8 Croatian guys! Compared to the 200 employees that made Gran Turismo in two years, that's an accomplishment - especially as this is their first retail publishing.
Anyway, the game rocks, although there are a few lag issues in multiplayer which are being corrected as we speak. A multiplayer profile will be added to 1.2 with cars and upgrades for the online part.
Seriously, no matter what you do, upgrade the damn game! There's no copy protection, at all!"
