Brooklyn experimental pop outfit Dinosaur Feathers released its debut LP, Fantasy Memorial, in 2009. At the time, the albumΓÇÖs tropical vibe and sunny instrumentation were right at home amongst similar-sounding acts also on the rise. Since then, the group has toured relentlessly and reconfigured their own sensibilities for their latest LP, Whistle Tips, due out April 10th via Ernest Jenning.



According to press for the LP, the band havenΓÇÖt left the beach-esque sound behind entirely. Rather, theyΓÇÖve infused it with influences from The Soft Boys, The Olivia Tremor Control, XTC, and Paul McCartneyΓÇÖs Wings. For a signpost as to where theyΓÇÖre headed sonically, the band has shared the album track ΓÇ£UntrueΓÇ¥. The jangly guitar line and saccharine harmonies fit right in with the bubbly cuts off their debut, but thereΓÇÖs a clear maturity to the track, thanks to some slight infusion of noisier elements, and songwriting thatΓÇÖs relatable without being overly mushy.
