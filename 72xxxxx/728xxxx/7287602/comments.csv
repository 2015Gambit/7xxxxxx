Ever heard of 'initial seeding up to a decent ratio?'"
,PiratCali,2012-05-23T21:19Z,"Not my problem. I submitted the file, and if more people want to seed, they can. Not my fault if people are leeching greedily & not giving back. "

,jbanes,2012-05-26T02:27Z,"Dude, it would be really great if you could seed this torrent until we have enough other seeders to make it viable.  I understand that it's not your problem, it's just that it would be a stand-up thing to do."
,PiratCali,2012-05-26T14:50Z,"I'm somewhat new to filesharing, so I've got no idea how to do that, unfortunately. Plus, I don't have a VPN, so I don't want to risk getting caught."
,jbanes,2012-05-26T16:24Z,"I sympathize completely about not wanting to get busted. The internet Nazis can be cruel.

As I understand it, and, please, someone correct me if I'm wrong, when you upload a torrent to Pirate Bay, you're not uploading the movie, ebook, or software itself...just the information on where to download it from. If you upload the torrent, then immediately stop seeding it yourself, nobody can download the file.  We can download the torrent, but not the file the torrent points to.  You have to leave it available long enough for some of the rest of us to get it and start seeding it ourselves.  Once there are enough of us, then you can stop seeding.

I do not blame you at all, however, for being concerned about your security.  If that is an issue for you then by all means do whatever you feel necessary to protect yourself.  Just know that you have to seed your own torrents for at least a little while, or no one will able to download them.

And I do sincerely appreciate the effort you made to try and share what you have with the rest of us.  All Pirates are cool."
