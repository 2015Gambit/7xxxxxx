***Note***
This is for PlayOnLinux suite, i.e. for WINE.

You SHOULD not use proprietary software, for alternative to Microsoft Office check  
https://www.libreoffice.org/.

I uploaded this for people that can not use open source alternative on their work/school computer but don't want to use Windows.

This should work on modern Linux, BSD and MacOS X, PlayOnLinux 4+ recommended.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Included:

Microsoft Office 2007 (Home/Student) with SP3 (.odt support) and stripped of all redundant stuff. MS Word, Excel and PowerPoint only!
Also all packages need to run Office are included, also MS fonts.

Language: English

It is fully activated, it will not complain about anything. It should run just fine!

I also took care and disabled internet access for this WINEPREFIX so Office can not call home to Redmond.
So this is sandboxed suite.

This is brutally compressed with xz-utils, so when decompressed it will use about 622MB of disk space.

README included, check it for info how to install.


Please donate to LibreOffice project or help them code. 
So we do not need to run M$ software via WINE.
You could also donate to WINE project and help them perfect their software.
