Hm, strange. Is there output in log files?

However, I'm working on Office 2010 package.
This one will work without playonlinux and will have installer."

there is one more thing to mention: in shortcuts folder edit each file and change ""/home/cookie"" so that instead of ""cookie"" there is your user name. :)"
