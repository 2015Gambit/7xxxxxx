I really like your posting here. Do you have more Violine?"
,Translation_pirate,2012-05-22T16:53Z,"Suprbay is out of the air just now, in a day it should work again :P

I also didn't mean that I don't react on comic requests here, only that it takes on average a week to get a response here, and two days max on suprbay :D

I sadly don't have more of Violine yet.
I can, however, reassure you it's coming :D
Since I'm not associated with the project, I sadly can't give you an indication how long it will take..."
