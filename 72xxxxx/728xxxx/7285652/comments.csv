Sorry this is my first time rating a torrent so the numbers might not be completely accurate. Speaking of first times I almost threw up when Joffrey raped Sansa. It was so bloody and graphic even in the books I wasn't sure how HBO was going to adapt it, but they did a disturbingly great job. The king always gets his rights, and not even the Hound could say a word when Joffrey forced him to watch! Don't worry though he's going to snap and cut Joff's head off next season so he's really gonna regret that.  "
,TheQueenIsDead,2012-05-21T04:16Z,BOUT DAMN TIME
,walkerion,2012-05-21T04:17Z,Thanks ettv. I hope this episode isn't as depressing as the last xD

,GrokkoW,2012-05-21T04:19Z,"LOL spoiler. obviously haven't read the book, not that the show really stuck very close. 

I would understand if you got to see the looks on everyone's face when they realized you're just joshing them with bullshit spoilers..... but why bother otherwise?"
,theleapfrog,2012-05-21T04:19Z,yay! waited the whole night for this!

Better try some new tactics, these are getting old and have a fishy odor"
,schmim64,2012-05-21T04:24Z,spoiling what happens in a comment isn't going to stop people from purchasing HBO just to watch it :D
,celticfc12345678,2012-05-21T04:24Z,Are HBO all over this tonight or what?
,gorm4660,2012-05-21T04:24Z,"Why is there always some little prick like ""Elzzikard"" trying to tell the plot and atempt to ruin it for some one else? Really do not care as I read these books years ago, and anything that he might write down here is of no account. No way can he possibly cover this show no matter how much he writes down, Nice try you ""little Tard"""
,Powerbyte,2012-05-21T04:24Z,Thank you--- there are so many pretenders!
,thedeathbee,2012-05-21T04:25Z,"Haha! If elzzikrad is indeed just messing around then I take back my heated blurt. Sorry

,noezienoe,2012-05-21T04:31Z,"Elzzikrad, if you're gonna come up with a bullshit lie like that, at least don't claim it was in the book - because those who actually read the book will immediately know youre full of shit."
,5p1n47,2012-05-21T04:32Z,"seriously could we hold spoilers off till at least one day after we air....buddy with the first comment goes off for a paragraph thank god all I got was Joffrey and I looked away.

,gAMBOLz,2012-05-21T05:42Z,"Personally really disappointed with Season 2 overall. I mean they don't just massively diverge from the book, they also completely make stuff up that never happens every show. Then they waste so much time on pointless scenes. They did such a good job with Season 1. Oh well I'll keep watching anyway. "

,ShadowSkiller,2012-05-21T15:28Z,"The spoilers posted are fakes.  Please don't post spoilers even if they are false.  They still spoil the show for those who haven't read the books yet.  Sure what you are posting might be amusing to us who read the book, but it will ruin for those who didn't.  They might believe what you said and lose interest thinking that they know what will happen already.  Personally I wish I haven't read the books so that the show would still have more suspense as I watch them."

,Viriatus2,2012-05-23T21:02Z,"Excellent series.

Can't wait for the part when Renly reappears as a white walker, goes in a killing frenzy with his army of undead in Westeros, kills his brother and his red bitch and then Daenerys comes  with her dragons and melt all of them and becomes the ruler of the 7 kingdoms along side with the Martel Prince and have many babies. And of course killing in the path every Stark, Baratheon and Lanister in revenge.

Oh and seeing Jon Snow as the new King of the North because Robb is killed in his wedding day.

Oh and Tyrion getting more wet pussy."
