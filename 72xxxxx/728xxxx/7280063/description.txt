Females in rock received a massive push toward the end of the '90s thanks to the spirited effort of Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair and the fierce drive of urban female artists such as Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill. During the new millennium the door remained open for other female singer/songwriters, including Emiliana Torrini. Torrini's beautiful vocals match the translucence of Beth Orton and Kate Bush and the undying passion of Bj√∂rk. Her debut Love in the Time of Science is a shimmering delight of gossamer lyrics and swooning instrumental imagery. Tears for Fears' Roland Orzabal assists with production and songwriting, enabling Torrini's voice to soar over intricate basslines and synth programming. In addition to her dramatic roar, Torrini brings a subtle hush to her songs as well. "Tuna Fish" and "Dead Things" are deep reflections of emotional pain and social frustration. Elsewhere, the album further explores the creative core of this artist who's aching for an answer, begging for an explanation through song. But Torrini isn't entirely absorbed by heavy moods. She's refreshing on the cathartic "Unemployed in Summertime," a breezy seascape of jazzy bass loops and delicate string
