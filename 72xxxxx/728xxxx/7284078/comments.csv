,droddel,2012-05-23T20:22Z,"My N端vi 350 doesn't recognize this map. It's called gmapsupp.img and I've put it in a Garmin folder on the SD-card.

Tried the same thing with one of the separete img-files from http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7246157/Garmin_City_Navigator_Europe_NT_2013.10_Unlocked_IMG_Maps and that did work. 

Is this img in some format that the 350 can't read maybe?"
,torckar,2012-05-23T21:14Z,"Droddel:
Try to rename the Garmin folder on your SD card to GARMIN. I do not know 350.... but try. This download works for me as well as http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7246157/Garmin_City_Navigator_Europe_NT_2013.10_Unlocked_IMG_Maps"

Try to rename your file on your SD-card from garmin, to GARMIN.  Works for me."

It was validated ok on my Kenwood DNX7240BT but to update it asks for the unlock code.

Does anybody have it?"
,edmitchell,2012-06-24T17:17Z,"I do not have a garmin device, I just want to be able to view the maps using mapsoource or basecamp ( it doesn't really matter which.)I'm just looking for an offline mapquest sort of thing here. Anyways, I have downloaded this torrent and am unable to view the maps in mapsource or basecamp. I have already installed both programs and have put in the patched exe's. I have ran the mapset toolkit with cgpsmapper and keep getting the error: E032 Layer 0 cannot be empty. What does this mean?? I have also tried splitting the gmapsupp.img files with Gmaptool and then tried to load each of those files, but have had no success. I have already tried everything posted in this and other torrents' comment areas with similiar luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

Could you tell me the difference between :

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7261170/Garmin_CN_North_America_NT_2013.10_Unlocked_for_Mapsource

They are all named ""North_America_NT_2013.10"". How can I choose ?"
,Ipmark,2012-07-14T11:32Z,"CNEUNT - CN EU NT = City Navigator EUrope NT
CNNANT - CN NA NT = City Navigator North America NT

Unlocked IMG = Map ready to use

For Mapsource = You have to select the area you prefer to send it to the device.

,TkNeo,2012-07-19T16:27Z,"PLEASE HELP. I unrare'd the IMG file and saved it in Garmin folder with a name gmapsupp on my SD card. Now when i try to go to address, GPS is able to find roads and addresses but I am not sure if it will work once i am in Europe (i am still in US). I want to make sure it will work when i am in Europe. Is there a way to check? People say you can zoom in and see roads etc but when i open the map all i see is US. Please advise anyone !!"
,Ipmark,2012-07-22T09:49Z,"Check in ""Maps > Info Maps"" section of the Nuvi if the the European map is detected.
If you can search the european addresses the map should work correctly.
Finally you can un-zoom and drag the GPS touchscreen until the europe to see roads and POIs."
,fezon,2012-08-03T12:07Z,Hi! I have a Garmin 3790 and i use this map and it works except the voice control. Is the voice control removed from this map or is there anything else i should do to make it work?
,Ipmark,2012-08-04T10:56Z,"You need ASR files.

,fezon,2012-08-04T15:04Z,"Thanks Ipmark! In the future, where can i find these asr files to download? I supposed that i also need update GMAP3D and JCV. Is there something more i need to update? Do you know where i can find these files?

Thanks in advance"
,Ipmark,2012-08-04T15:49Z,"Additional files for Europe 2013.10 release are in an another my torrent

In the future, use G00gle to search the right words (europe 2013.10 asr, in this case), there are many interesting f0rums, I suggest n_o_e_m_a_n. "
