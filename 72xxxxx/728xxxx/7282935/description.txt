	This is a little something I made to pay my dues back to the torrent community. I found there really was no good Knife Party torrent, so I made my own. 
        This contains   all of the music I could buy on iTunes that was made by Knife Party. The songs from "100% No Modern Talking" were free on Soundcloud, so those are from there. All of the others are iTunes mp3 copies (converted in iTunes) of the songs I could buy. 
        One problem is that "Crush on You (Knife Party Remix)" cannot be bought on iTunes US due to Apple being an asshole. Also, the whole Antidote album says it's by Swedish House Mafia, but Knife Party collaborated with them on that one, so I included it. There are many more live only songs they have that are not on iTunes that you can get yourself. I just got these because I know 100% that they are all 320Kbps. 
        You can change the ID3 tags if you like. They are all the original tags. This was compressed in Keka for Mac on Ultra in .zip format to make it a bit smaller. 
        Enjoy. I hope it all works. I never checked for the DRM stuff. Comment if you have any problems.
