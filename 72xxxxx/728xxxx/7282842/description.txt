A decorated Vietnam veteran becomes a local hero after standing up to a pair of skinheads on a transit bus, and he later takes the law into his own hands after the police fail to investigate the brutal murder of his best friend. When Frank Vega (Danny Trejo) returned home from fighting for his country, he should have been hailed as a hero. Instead, he drifted into the margins of society after failing to find a job and being abandoned by his high-school sweetheart. Decades later, when Frank sees a pair of skinheads harassing an elderly black man on a city bus, he knocks them both out as the incident is captured on video. An instant viral hit, the widely circulated video turns Frank into an Internet celebrity. But his fame comes at a high price when his best friend Klondike is killed and authorities sweep the murder under the rug. Meanwhile, Frank's biggest battle is yet to come. Ron Perlman and Charles S. Dutton co-star.
