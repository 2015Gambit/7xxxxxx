,Wartz,2012-05-22T15:58Z,"@mikeike65 Well sometimes when you said ""thanks"" 20 times to someone who never answers back, you kinda...stop saying it, you don't see the point, even if you're really, really greatful like I am. eztv does a great job, but I'm not sure who ever he is (they are?), he minds reading the comments. thanks anyway."
