TLC brings viewers inside the rarely seen world of plural families with the premiere of ""SISTER WIVES"", an engrossing seven-part series following Kody Brown, his three -- soon to be four -- wives and their many children. Premiering on Sunday, September 26 at 10 PM (ET/PT), ""SISTER WIVES"" explores the complex daily life of a polygamist family. ""SISTER WIVES"" introduces audiences to husband Kody -- along with his three wives; Meri, Janelle and Christine and their combined 13 children -- showing how they attempt to navigate life as a ""normal"" family in a society that shuns their lifestyle. From their unconventional family structure and living arrangements to financial challenges, each half hour episode exposes the inner workings of a polygamist household, revealing the unexpectedly tight-knit and loving relationships between Kody's wives.
