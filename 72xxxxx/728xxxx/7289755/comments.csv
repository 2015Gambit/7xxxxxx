,MAA11792,2012-05-29T01:26Z,"Thank you for putting all your effort into this release.. but the game itself is shit (please read below and make up your mind before purchase):

This game sucks so hard and I can't honestly comprehend why Codemasters would choose to screw this series of games up even more in the ass buy creating something that is simply full of shit and flaws.

I’m happy to say that I WILL NEVER EVER AGAIN buy anything from Codemasters in my entire life – thank you all pirates out there for releasing this piece of shit game so that we actually have the chance to try it out before spending our hard earned money on [no offence towards my fellow American pirates or its citizens] an Americanized or rather CockbBlockanized software that would be better off in Mrs. Bieber's room alone!

DiRT – Was worthless, cheap graphics and bad indeed very bad handling.
DiRT2 – Was worthless, better graphics and handling but too much of this baja and advertisements everywhere which just looks silly.. not to mention the actually gameplay.
DiRT3 – Was worthless, nothing really new was added except more advertisements and useless baja and more of them fake rally stages (like running the same stage more than 25times in a row back and forth with only a few sets of cars and of course even more advertisement).

To be honest all the previous rally games that were made by Codemasters ''Colin McRae Rally'' was not really that good either, nor the handling but you had at least a hundred plus stages to navigate your way throw, several real rally teams that were up to date and almost no advertisement.. 14years later and all we actually pay for is being brainwashed and commercialised buy some stupid energy drink companies who believe they own the whole world and believe me they're all doing it wrong because some of us (even if were are weak) dear to stand up for ourselves online.

Fuck you Codemasters for releasing this piece of shit game and I’m glad that I DID NOT BUY IT!
