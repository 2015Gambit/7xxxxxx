,nikita566,2012-05-19T20:46Z,"THANK YOU!!!

On my computer, this game's volume is about a second or two behind the video. I am using the newest version of VLC. How can I fix it?

Thanks!"
,nikita566,2012-05-19T21:23Z,"It seems to happen when I pause and restart or I jump to a different time in the video. Anyone have any ideas why?

Thanks in advance for any help. It seems the sound takes longer to load than the video. When I load the game, the video comes on, but there is a small delay until the sound starts. I never noticed this before. "
