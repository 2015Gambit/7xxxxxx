,Felixer86,2012-06-14T22:12Z,can i also mount it with daemon tools or something?
,MW2366,2012-06-15T19:13Z,"You can, but you'd still need the disc in which to burn it. 

Now, I'm gonna speculate (or go out on a limb, here, don't take offense to it) to say that you want a crack to it, and I'm sure there are experienced program crackers out there, but the thing is, I've probably experienced more crashing with cracked programs than with just burning it to a DVD.

Granted, Oblivion isn't exactly the most STABLE of Bethsoft games, but at least you have insurance that it's not passing the disc-check to where something crucial to the program might want to access (say, the Levelup/Attributes menu, or the loading screen/cards, that seems to access the disc alot).

Of course, if you DO want to crack it, by all means, do so, I have no control over your decisions, I'm just lookin' out for the actions and consequences."
,TBear420,2012-06-18T07:24Z,Runs like charm. thanks a lot man :)
,DzunjaBien,2012-06-26T04:46Z,"Hope this will work. I got 2.57 gHz processor (Intel i3), 2 gigs of RAM and 750 MB Graphics Card (Intel (R) HD Graphics. Anyone? I bet this game will lag horribly. >.<

BTW, this is a nice torrent. :D"
,MW2366,2012-06-27T17:43Z,"That should work, I have an Intel 2.66 GHz Core Two Duo Processor, 4 GB RAM, and a nVidia GT220 1 (or 2) GB Video card.

Runs perfectly fine with mods, so long as you don't mess with the LOD meshes (In other words, don't generate new LOD meshes, makes Oblivion lag like crazy, stick with the ones you got), and it should run perfectly smoothly.

I also have a modified INI that can put actor/object/specular/shadow fades waaay above the normal limits, while running everything on max (well, except HDR, that seems to be broken for me, auto-adjusts the skybox all white).

Again, I'm sure you'll be fine, it is a fairly old game by now."
,stidza98,2012-06-27T21:24Z,Tnx a lot :)
,Resilience777,2012-07-28T03:13Z,"Hey, thanks alot for sharing. This is a golden classic with endless replay value, and it has the greatest and most dedicated modding community I have ever seen. Also, if you want the expansions, check out this guy: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6754164/ALL_DLC_for_The_Elder_Scrolls_IV__Oblivion-_PC

I have an AMD 2.60Ghz Phenom2 Quad-core, 8GB of DDR2 Ram, and a nVidia Geforce GT240 with 1GB of DDR5 VRam, and overclocking all of it :P"
,MW2366,2012-07-30T19:39Z,"@Resilience777 Ah, thanks, that should help with getting the seeds up on the expansions, especially to that one which this doesn't have.

Install instructions in of themselves on that torrent seems simple enough, too.

Ya don't really need to overclock your tower if ya got that much power in it. :D"
,codelancelot,2012-08-24T02:32Z,mine is the colectors edition and i was wondering if i could get people to download and seed mine https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7562403/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_Of_The_Year_Deluxe_Edition_wi
,MW2366,2012-08-24T17:59Z,"I would also recommend that you get the older construction set, v1.0... v1.2 has a bug in that the lip sync files will freeze if you make any dialogue changes to plugin files, at the cost of being the most functionally working, compared to v1.0.

To make it more useable, I would also download the Construction Set Extender which utilizes both v1.0 and v1.2, so you have working lip sync files, while still having the support of v1.2.
