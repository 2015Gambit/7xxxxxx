Now for instructions
--------------------

1. After downloading this file, proceed to BURN the file to DVD with any of your favorite ISO programs.
2. Install the game, after burning it to disc.

Enjoy your crack-free Oblivion, all you need is the disc.



Uploader's Note: Now, as I write this, I have my own burned copy of Oblivion which is taken straight from the disc itself after being physically cracked by my older computer's CD-Drive. So luckily I had these files on my computer at the time as it became unscannable, I still have that disc, and thankfully there's no 'write-protection' (IE DRM, no cracks here!) to Oblivion's retail version.

Also, this is THE ORIGINAL TES IV: Oblivion, there are NO expansions to it, not that the expansions are hard to find or install either.
