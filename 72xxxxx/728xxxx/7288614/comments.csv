For what it's worth, I rescanned every file and Avast found no threats.  I've done this a few times.... "
,Strecky,2012-05-25T08:00Z,"Yeah, I was really surprised that ESET would show it infected. Coming from a trusted member here, I knew it would/should be quality. I just turned off ESET and downloaded it that way.  Thanks for sharing!"
[T],rjordan21,2012-05-25T14:11Z,"ESET NOD32 Antivirus shows no infected files....

In any event, enjoy the music.  Steve Hoffman is a Master at what he does."
