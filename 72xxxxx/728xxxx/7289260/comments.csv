File managers are useful for moving files between folders, making backup copies of files, viewing pictures and playing sounds,
running other utility programs on lists of files, deleting unwanted files and many other ""housekeeping"" tasks. Directory Opus goes beyond the simple file manager metaphor, and offers you a complete replacement for Windows Explorer and many other utility programs for handling FTP, ZIP, viewing files and images, running slideshows and more. It provides you with all this within a user-friendly and fully-configurable environment within which you can access and manage your important data with a minimum of effort. Harness the power of your computer like never before!"
