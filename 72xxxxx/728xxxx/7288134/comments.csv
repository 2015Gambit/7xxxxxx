Behind the America you know lies another world, where people live outside the law. For the new Discovery Channel series ""KURT SUTTER'S OUTLAW EMPIRES"", premiering Monday, May 14 at 10PM ET/PT and produced by Studio Lambert and Sutterink for Discovery, Sons of Anarchy creator Kurt Sutter enters the realm of the gangs and families who have dominated our streets and helped shape our nation's history. Steered by Sutter's compelling insight, each episode of ""KURT SUTTER'S OUTLAW EMPIRES"" tells the complete story of an iconic American outlaw dynasty - directly from the mouths of people from the inside. Through their no-holds-barred accounts, the series takes an unvarnished look at moment-by-moment experiences that were not only pivotal for the organizations themselves, but life-changing for the individuals telling the stories.
