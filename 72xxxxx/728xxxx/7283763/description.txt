Cd Universe

After a monster debut, Simply Red's follow-up album...featured an uneven batch of songs and
lacked the kind of standout single Hucknall had enjoyed on the previous album with "Holding
Back the Years." It wasn't a half-hearted effort by any means; Mick Hucknall's crackling vocals
were just as exuberant, and the band's Stax/Volt-influenced lines were effectively played. They
did turn in an interesting version of "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye." ~ Ron Wynn

2008 digitally remastered and expanded edition of Mick Hucknall and the gang's 1987 album
featuring six bonus tracks. The bonus tracks on this special edition were all only released
as B-sides before and on 7" or 12" vinyl (except for the live version of 'Ev'ry Time We Say
Goodbye' which was a B-side on their first ever CD single). Hucknall re-invented 'Broken Man'
in 1998 for the Blue album, but this was how it sounded originally. 16 tracks. Rhino.
