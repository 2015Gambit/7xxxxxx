Squishees allegedly contain no natural ingredients (not even pure water), create dangerous cases of brain freeze, and are even described as ""a thick, gloopy, tooth-rotting mixture of crushed ice and syrup"". Flavors include: blue, red, lime green, Chutney, Wheatgrass, Champagne, cherry, and the Twenty-One Syrup Salute."
