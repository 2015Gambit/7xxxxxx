read what the user mean about that ""tool"":

This app is completely unnecessary. Mac OS X does a great job at automatically freeing memory when you need it.

If you really think it makes a difference manually freeing some memory, you do NOT need to buy a program like iCleanMemory. Just install the developer tools and type ""purge"" in the Terminal application."

Did you mean this comment?> 

This is one of those neat little ""does one thing and does it well"" type of utilities. Sure, you could use the ""purge"" command in Terminal as suggested below but I like the convenience of having the utility in my Menu Bar so I can quickly check the amount of used/free memory and purge it if needed. I don't want to think about opening Terminal and typing in the command.

I also like to support indie developers who come up with nice solutions as this."
