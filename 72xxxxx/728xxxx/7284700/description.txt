Life on Fire
Volcanoes are one of the most spectacular and powerful forces on our planet. They create new land, change landscapes and destroy civilisations, but more than two billion years ago they also breathed life into our world. From the ocean abyss to snow-covered summits, this ambitious series paints a detailed picture of the struggles and amazing intimacy required to survive around volcanoes. Spectacular scenery provides the backdrop for the extraordinary animals and plants that have learned to juggle with fire. Fragile and engaging, these creatures teach us lessons in survival in a world as fascinating as it is dangerous.




5)  Pioneers of the Deep 
In the vast emptiness of the Pacific Ocean, tectonic movements construct or destroy islands. In the Tongan archipelago, two little-known animals have learnt to cope with these ephemeral lands: the sooty tern, a seabird that never dares wet its wings for fear of drowning and the Alvin shrimp, a blind crustacean that nonetheless manages to find its way around the abyss. When an underwater volcano becomes an island, the fates of these two living paradoxes are linked.
