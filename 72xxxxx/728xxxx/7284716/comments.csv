Even though it's 693.26 MiB, when the burn process is almost done, it stops and says there is not enough room on disc. The disc is 4.7 gigs!!!!"

,BPeppy1,2012-07-30T17:14Z,"Surprised to see that there was no data about the file.  Downloaded (it was slow but complete).

AVI file has a resolution of 624 x 352.  The audio and video quality is 10 out of 10.

The program is very good.  Its a touching, poignant  look at this amazing icon of American late night talk show.

For some strange reason, the file name is misspelled in an odd way.  But don't let that stop you.

Big thanks to the uploader!"
