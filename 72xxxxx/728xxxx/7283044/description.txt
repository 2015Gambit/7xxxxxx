The Debut album from SoundLift.

Drawing from sonics as far away as the edges of Asia, the sands of the Middle East, the mountains of Armenia, the sparkling shores of Portugal, and the beautiful beaches of Mexico, SoundLift presents a sound palette of the world's most exotic musical influences.

Differing from track to track, the value of this release is found in the strength of the compilation. The title track kicks off the album with soul-wrenching melodies and pulls us in from the first few bars. 'Windmill' brings a fresh melody and cool synths mixed with some soft strings. 'Take My Guitar', 'Give You My Love' featuring Adrina Thorpe, 'Acapulco' and 'Oriente' each bring a different flavour, stretching the boundaries of what trance music can be.

An added benefit, Yerevan's release is further bolstered by the addition of two of SoundLift's classics. 'Horizonte' and 'Nakhti' are presented on this album along with the full plate of fantastic new work!

Release date: 30th September 2011.

These are only 128kbps as I reduce all my albums to this bit rate so that I fit more music onto my iPhone.
