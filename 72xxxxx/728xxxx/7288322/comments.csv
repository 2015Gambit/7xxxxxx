[V],Nepotu,2012-05-22T07:48Z,"ok! I want to ask you to seed, for all this games, until there are no leechers, please. This way you can return the favor. Thank you!"
,woogiezoozoo,2012-05-22T17:23Z,"Of course I will seed everything I get off you - I too just need to sort out some HD space and then I will probably seed them for 6 months - 1 year... People need Barca!!
BTW 34. is done now..."
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-22T19:31Z,"Thank you my dear friend. And I'll help you with your collection. Cheers, my friend!"
,ohess,2012-05-25T09:17Z,"Hey Nepotu, thanks for all the moto gp races you upload.Can you do me a favor and upload this weeks race at Lemans in the regular TV-Video format. My computer has small RAM ,and I can't watch races in high res. Not enough memory , and the picture and sound stick and there's blocking in the picture etc.  Thanks ... Bud Hess"
