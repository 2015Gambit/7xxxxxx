To play USE VLC player which is free and good. 

Right click the disc folder you wish to play and select Play with VLC media player,
and after a few moments the disc opens up just like a DVD.


I have included a very unofficial soundtrack with some of the music played SGU,
both by the big dawg Joel Goldsmith and other music samples which are played in the show.
