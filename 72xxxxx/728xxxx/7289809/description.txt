The Tangled Skein by David Stuart Davis.

A threat to HolmesΓÇÖs life, murders on Hampstead Heath and a deadly phantom lady lead Holmes and Watson into the most dangerous investigation they have ever undertakenΓÇª An encounter which brings them face to face with evil itself, embodied in Count Dracula, the Lord of the Undead.

'From Baker Street to Devon (and Baskerville Hall), The Tangled Skein hurtles along at an unholy pace, twisting and turning itΓÇÖs way to the final battle between Dracula and Holmes. Nicholas Briggs and Richard Earl are as reliable as ever as Holmes and Watson and leap into the story with gusto and bravado...' Mass Movement

'The Hound is nail-bitingly exciting, as it should be, and the same can be said of The Tangled Skein, adapted by Richard Dinnick from David Stuart DaviesΓÇÖs sequel ΓÇô which also completely rewrites the story of Dracula. For full-blooded gothic excitement this pair would be hard to beat.' The Sherlock Holmes Journal
