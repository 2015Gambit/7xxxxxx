,cromwelld,2012-05-30T04:11Z,It would be great if whoever originally uploaded this torrent would actually seed it to 100% instead of the  99.86% it is stuck on right now!!!
,kevinanon,2012-06-01T17:57Z,Works fine at 99.8

When you say it works fine at 99.8%

Do you mean, I can stop the download and just rename the file (take away the .part)?

When you say use this link to complete, I have downloaded both files and both stop at 99.86.  How would I merge the files?"
,kevinanon,2012-06-03T16:09Z,"Either should work,   you should be able to rename and it will work fine or add the torrent with the iso file in the same download directory.  I use Vuze,  Vuze automatically checks the existing iso file and then completes.  should not be a complete new download"
,kevinanon,2012-06-03T16:12Z,P.S.   remove the old torrent from your client
,cromwelld,2012-06-04T02:48Z,"how do I do this in Vuze.  I re-downloaded this torrent (and again it stopped at 99.8) with Vuze.  I also downloaded the torrent you say to use this link to complete, but it is trying to download the complete file again.  I am new to Vuze, so forgive me..."
,kevinanon,2012-06-04T13:43Z,Make sure you are saving the file for the new torrent to the same location as the old file
,mr_ktr,2012-07-07T03:02Z,Please seed the last 0.1% (2MB)!!!
,mr_ktr,2012-07-20T03:25Z,"Yo one seeder, you ain't connectable. "
,mlewarski,2012-08-16T23:00Z,can`t someone please put the full 100% file up again.
