In the summer of 1968 after the demise of his last band THE ATTACK, JOHN DU CANN formed ANDROMEDA. For the next year they gigged up and down the UK at clubs,Universities and prestige London venues such as The Round House and The Lyceum.
Having caught the eye of the late JOHN PEEL Radio One appearances followed. John Du Cann and his colleagues recorded their first album which they presented to their then record company who promptly dropped two tracks (too long for an LP) and remixed it as the original was considered ΓÇ£too heavyΓÇ¥.
The band was gutted and John moved onto ATOMIC ROOSTER - but that as they say is another story.
Now released for the first time ever in its original form, remastered from the original acetates is one of the classic heavy psych, underground albums of the 60ΓÇÖs. John Du Cann said ΓÇ£I had actually forgotten that I had these recordings. This is how I had first laid out the album and it was only listening to the remastered version that I realized how much material had been lost on the LP released back in 1969ΓÇ¥
