,livv38,2012-05-29T20:55Z,"Cyberlink Media suite 9 use Power Director 8,Power2go7,etc. Its a huge difference. Media Suite 10 use Power director 10 and Power2 Go 8. "
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-05-30T12:05Z,"Yeah i agree bud,sorry forgot to tell this.
My bad ok !
powerdvd 12,power director10,power2Go 8.
Exactly,and they are all included in this new one.
I mean setup is still named media suite 9,but all i have described there up more is really present.
So what's the problem bud ?
Does not work for you so ?

,livv38,2012-05-30T20:19Z,"I cant't install because i have already instaled Media suite 9,and i want upgrade this. I have read Media Suite 10 in title name,""full,retail"",and i want this. Retail version must named Media suite 10 in setup. If you said only setup is still named Media Studio 9 and the rest of software is in fact Media Studio 10,i try to install this. Thanks for informations."

,Adriesk,2012-09-15T07:12Z,"Thanks alot for the working software, however, its definitely not exactly officially produced as the real product should be. This is not the actual Media Suite 10 Ultra. Its Media Suite 9 and you just added the latest products into the msi installation pack (eg. Power DVD 12) and you upload it here as Media Suite 10. However, though it is not fully actual and official, i still do appreciate it and hats off to you. Needless to say, when an official release of Media Suite Ultra 10 appears on TPB, i will download that one."
