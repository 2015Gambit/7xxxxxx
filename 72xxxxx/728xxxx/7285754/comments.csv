,SULTAN_201,2012-05-21T16:28Z,"is there a 550 mb xvid avi release ???

,cinemaniac905,2012-05-21T17:09Z,"doubtful dude, FQM was ripping at 550 but these dont seem to be done anymore, or arent being aggregated...this is absolutely TERRIBLE quality though...if you are going to rip JUST DO IT FUCKING PROPERLY FFS.

you suck AFG."
,cinemaniac905,2012-05-21T17:15Z,"notice the blue lines that go across the screen...super noticeable at 12:20 mark.
