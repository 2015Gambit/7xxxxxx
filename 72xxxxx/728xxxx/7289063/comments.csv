,sooshicat,2012-06-14T04:29Z,"EVERYONE. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE TINYEST DETAIL. THEY WORK.

To install the expansion packs I did this:
open DMG
right click
select 'show package contents'
then contents>resources>.pkg file

,sooshicat,2012-07-01T09:41Z,"@kanyewest
To uninstall, look in the ""The Sims 2 Read Me.rtfd"" located where you installed the game. It has uninstallation instructions. If you delete ANYTHING of what the torrent downloaded you won't be able to seed. If you deleted the Read Me I will post the instructions. Once you uninstall, just go through the instructions again that came with the torrent and make sure you do it all correctly."

You do NOT copy the crack to the sims directory.

,sooshicat,2012-07-05T22:08Z,"@Kitty989
Hi,
I'm sorry I can't help you much as I have no experience with using Pseudo. The only thing I can think of is that you don't have a root user enabled maybe? 
Go to the finder and click on the Go menu and select Utilities. Open up Directory Utility. Click on the lock and enter your password. Then from the edit menu click on ""Enable Root User"" Set the password and bam you've now got a root user if you didn't already."
,Kitty989,2012-07-05T22:47Z,"@sooshicat
Thanks for helping, but I'm not sure what the root thing does... I set a password for it, and when I tried to put the patch on the app file, I got the error message again."
,sooshicat,2012-07-06T09:28Z,"@Kitty989
The root thing is just setting a root account up on your computer because lets put it this way.. If you don't actually HAVE a root account, then how is the program going to launch it as the root account? :)
I will look around for solutions for you and will post them on this page if I find an answer.
I'm sorry this is not working for you. Once you find a way to launch it as root then it will work 100%."
,sooshicat,2012-07-06T09:36Z,"@Kitty989
Try going to The Sims 2.app, Right click the file and Get Info and change its sharing permissions to 'read and write' for all users.
Then try Pseudo again. "

,Anonidaus,2012-08-03T06:57Z,"@eam100 I'm having the same issue:

**SYSTEM**

Macbook (polycarb white)
OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8
    (Running on external 30 GB HDD)
2.16 GHz  Intel Core 2 Duo
2 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM
GMA 950  GPU (shared memory)

SIMS 2 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
http://uoem.com/forums/threads/sims-2-system-requirements-for-macintosh.4187/


**INSTALL**

- I first had to install Snow Leopard on an external drive with space  for the install (updated to 10.6.8). 

- I copied over 'The Sims 2.dmg' to the applications. 

- I then installed all the expansions in the order specified by 'Installation Guide.rtf'.

- After installing the Seasons pack, I opened up the 'LaunchAsRoot.dmg' and ran the program.

- I then opened up 'Patch No DVD (etc...)' and dragged the Seasons UBCrack to the LaunchAsRoot window. The patch installer automatically opened (now with guaranteed admin privileges I assume).

- I dragged 'The Sims 2' app into the patch installer window. The installer prompted me to change permissions, which I accepted, and then ran the installer to completion. Green text told me the patch was installed successfully. 

- I closed everything down and unmounted the disk images.

- I clicked on 'The Sims 2' app in my applications folder and it started up just fine. It gave me the little EA bit and ran the intro movie.

**ISSUE**

After the intro movie, when a blurry blue square (I assume the main menu) is attempting to load, the screen flashes out to the desktop in like 640x480 resolution and the Sims 2 crashes. 

I get an error message telling me the app crashed with the standard options. I can't make heads or tails of the error log, but it's rather large. 

I'm not sure if my game file got corrupted somewhere along the download, if the patch doesn't work right anymore, or if I'm just unlucky; but, since someone else seems to be having the same issue, I figured I'd give a good description of my problem. 

I see this download has worked for some and it looks like the author put some time into getting it right. I'd hate for all their hard work to go to waste. Will seed if I can verify it works on my machine..."
,sooshicat,2012-08-08T11:25Z,"@Anonidaus
Why did you install Snow Leopard on your external harddrive?
You are able to install Sims on your external harddrive but still run it from your computer you know? This is probably why you are having issues.
30GB of harddrive space is really not enough to install the whole snow leopard system plus sims 2 and NOT have issues.
I would recommend you reinstall, but when it asks for an install destination, just install onto your HD.

@andyou2
I am not 100% sure about sims2packs.. because I only ever use package files. I would suggest you convert your sims2packs to package files (check modthesims.info for programs to help you do this) or just see if you can redownload the content in package form. Sometimes the authors have it in both forms depending on where you download from.
Meanwhile i will check my Sims and see if I can install sims2packs. I will comment back if i can solve your problem."
,sooshicat,2012-08-08T11:26Z,"@angelicam1
I only ever get this issue when I try to patch the wrong file. Make sure you are patching your base game .app and not an expansion"
,sooshicat,2012-08-08T11:30Z,"@Anonidaus
Maybe find some way to send me your error log? I will probably better be able to diagnose your problem if I know what is going on with your system"
,Kniteed,2012-08-09T10:09Z,well HELL you could have added somewhere that it only runs on Leopard and below before making me download it for a whole 2 hours. Dammit.

but now I'm just mad at myself."
,sketchycreeper,2012-08-10T17:24Z,"@sooshicat thanks for the download.

Anyone who might be having any issues with Launchasroot... I'm using OSX 10.5.8 and Launchasroot only works with 10.6.6 or higher so I had to download Pseudo.  Most Pseudo downloads I found were in .sit format and needed to download Stuffit Expander in order to open in.  Once I got past all that, I opened the Patch No DVD The Sims 2 Seasons.dmg and dragged the image for the crack onto the Pseudo window.  I immediately tried opening the Sims after that and it didn't work.  I gave it a few minutes and it worked just fine.  Guess it just needed a few. The first load screen was so slow.  I thought I was screwed like everyone else.  I started clicking around on the screen and just sat there and waited and it finally started moving.

I hope everyone else can get it figured out.  Keep at it.  It's a good download.  Seeding."

Hahaha maybe the big comment in capitals at the top of this post ;)
@Meowhai666
It most likely won't work with that expansion. This torrent comes ""as is"" and is probably incompatible with any other expansions. However your welcome to give it a go! And no I don't have Bon Voyage sorry :("
,sooshicat,2012-09-04T10:06Z,"@sketchycreeper
Yes, I probably should have added in the description that it takes quite a while to load on the first time opening. Setting up all the files etc, first runs are almost always slow.
Glad it's working for you"

I've tried everything and I'm at a loss, getting stuck at patching the Sims 2 app. I open the Patch No DVD dmg file, and then I drag the crack from inside the dmg to the Pseudo window, but when I get to the end I get the exact  ""Error"" that you document in your installation notes. I read your earlier comments and made sure that I've got a root account enabled and I've changed the Sims 2 app so that it's read and write enabled... but I still keep getting the error. BTW, I followed your instructions to the letter. I've been working at this for over an hour and I can't figure out the problem. Is there anything else you can think of that might be causing the problem? I'd appreciate any help you could give me. Thanks."
