,ajnsd,2012-05-20T00:18Z,Well done Chelsea! Champions of Europe!!! Sounds good saying/writing it. Your fans in San Diego will celebrate into the night.
,Hello2011,2012-05-20T00:42Z,@ajnsd are you serious? why do you think I wanted to download it to watch the game and not know who won thanks a lot you asshole you ruined the match for me
,EdoSensei,2012-05-20T00:43Z,"ajnsd you are a COCK!!!!

People download from here and a majority don't know the result. If they want to know the result they can go to any number of news sites!!!

Whoever has the ability to do so, delete the above fuckwit's comment asap so as not to spoil it for others!!!"
,Ubadoo,2012-05-20T01:44Z,Thank you ajnsd. You spoiled the whole champions league to me. Just because my TV broke the day before the match so I had to download it.
,fisa2001,2012-05-20T02:57Z,"ajnsd - Lol, dumb fucking Americans at their best. Do you really think people would download it if they knew the score? The game started at 4:45am in Australia and I got up at 10am just to download and watch the game and you fucking ruined it. Well done you retarded fuck for ruining the game for everyone in the world who hasn't seen the game yet. I just registered to write this comment because that's how much I'm mad at you. Delete your fucking comment. Love from Australia xoxo"
,woopwoot,2012-05-20T06:16Z,"Don't read the comments then

,floody08,2012-05-20T06:30Z,"FUCKING CUNT!!! RUINED THE MATCH!! WOTS THE FUCKING POINT IN COMMENTING AND SAYING THAT? I AVOIDED EVERY FUCKING NEWS ARTICLE ONLY TO BE SPOILED BY A PIECE OF SHIT!

,muhu88,2012-05-20T19:30Z,@ajnsd: You r an ahole...stupid americans
,drew1972,2012-05-21T02:19Z,"Hey ASSHOLES! It's one (1), a single, stupid American.  Why are you reading the comments from the second half file anyway?  Dumb ass Europeans!"
,drew1972,2012-05-21T02:22Z,"I managed to download this file, discover that it a giant piece of shit that was not worth my time and bandwidth.  All of that without reading a single comment about a game that I hadn't seen yet.  AMAZING HOW THAT WORKS!  If you don't want to know anything about a game, maybe you shouldn't read any comments about it, you dumb ass, mother fucking, retarded, broke ass European shitholes!"
,drew1972,2012-05-21T02:25Z,"Think before you spout your ass-backward, ignorant, diarrhetic, absolutely useless minds!"
,EdoSensei,2012-05-22T05:49Z,"Obviously then,  American's have no peripheral vision!

Fortunately for me, I knew the result because I watched it live but not everyone can. Work, family, however many reasons!

I didn't even try to read it but the VERY FIRST comment is ""Well done Chelsea!"" right under where it says GET THIS TORRENT."
,shabbamanuk,2012-05-22T06:56Z,"im from the uk living in the usa,i can must say that most americans are pretty dumb.thanks for the up."
