Thanks so much, TVTeam, can't find this series anywhere else."
,uv9z,2012-05-21T15:54Z,S02E03 ? 
,medusa07,2012-05-21T17:17Z,"0203 was supposed to be broadcast a Sunday ago, but real life events (British soldier killed in Afghanistan) were too like the episode, so, it'll be shown sometime ""this summer"", apparently."
,gilliegirl,2012-05-22T03:59Z,"Thanks for this, cannot find S02E03, does anyone have, PLEASE!!!"

,whoomp22ca,2012-05-25T04:14Z,"Thanks so much, but any chance we could get either an avi or mp4 version?"
,a1b32369,2012-05-28T20:08Z,"Audio and video are fine, plays very well with VLC, but there are embedded subtitles in English. Any thoughts on whether they can be eliminated somehow?"
,far_kit,2012-07-01T09:34Z,"Yes the English Subs are hardcoded
cannot be removed
I've been waiting for 5 weeks now for AVI without subs :-("
,far_kit,2012-07-01T09:47Z,"I just converted it to AVi with 'converterLite'
I dont know how but it removed the Subs yee haa
you can search for converterlite its a free download and easy to use"
,micron66,2012-07-04T21:37Z,"the subtitles are not hard-coded,you can easily disable them in VLC player or any other multi-media player."
