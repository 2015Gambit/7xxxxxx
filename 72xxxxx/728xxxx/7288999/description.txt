“De Glauber para Jirges” (From Glauber To Jirges)

Short film, 35mm, 16min, 2005.

A flim based on the letters Glauber Rocha sent to Jirges Ristum in Italy. It presents a very intimate view, as the film was directed by Jirges' son (Andre Ristum) and edited by Glauber's son (Eryk Rocha).

Director: André Ristum
Editor: Eryk Rocha

Through letters sent by Glauber Rocha to his friend and collaborator Jirges Ristum in the sizzling mid 70’s, we get to know a little about how Glauber related to Italy and to cinema, and also about his perspective on Brazilian social, cultural and political scenarios at that time. A tribute from the director to his father Jirges and to Glauber Rocha, both deceased in the early 80’s.
