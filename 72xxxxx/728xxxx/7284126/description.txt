This book provides engineers with the safety and risk assessment tools and techniques they need to work effectively in any safety or reliability critical environment. These tools are primarily statistical. Where David Smith's book succeeds is by meeting the needs of an applied audience by setting these tools in the context of the design and operation of safety related processes and systems. Now in its Eighth Edition, this is regarded as the core reference in this field, and the success of its approach is reflected in the popularity of this standard work.

It deals with all aspects of reliability, safety-related systems, and the assessment and management of risk in a simple and straightforward way, pre-supposing no prior knowledge and dealing simply and realistically with numerical data by using the minimum of mathematical and technical jargon.

8th edition of this core reference for engineers who deal with the design or operation of any safety critical systems, processes or operations
Answers the question: how can a defect that costs less than $1000 dollars to identify at the process design stage be prevented from escalating to a $100,000 field defect, or a $1m+ catastrophe
Revised throughout, with new examples, and standards, including must have material on the new edition of global functional safety standard IEC 61508, which launches in 2010
