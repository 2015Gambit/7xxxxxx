Stars of CCTV is the debut album by English indie rock band Hard-Fi. It was first released on 4 July 2005 on Necessary/Atlantic and Warner Music UK. It was nominated for the 2005 Mercury Music Prize, and reached #1 in the UK albums chart in January 2006, taking it about 5 months to reach #1 mainly due to the preceding single "Cash Machine" catching the sellers' attention; its original peak position was #6. It has reached sales of 1.2 million copies worldwide,[1] with over 300,000 in the UK alone. The single "Gotta Reason" is included on the soundtrack of the football video game FIFA 06. The cover of Stars of CCTV does not bear the "Parental Advisory" sticker, despite the profanity used in the single "Living for the Weekend".
