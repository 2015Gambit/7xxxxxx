,ragna03,2012-05-23T08:22Z,@Hegemoney pls seed!!!!!!!!!!!
,Hegemoney,2012-05-23T09:12Z,"@ragna03

I just connected and there are over 60 seeders with over 120 peers with almost 33 full copies.  Was downloading at 1.24 mB/s.  If you are having issues it is somewhere on your end.

I uploaded 20 full copies of this release before I stopped seeding.  I can't dedicate all my bandwidth to just one torrent as I am behind on my releases already.

In the very near future I will be putting my releases up on a dedicated http or ftp download."
,ragna03,2012-05-23T11:46Z,@Hegemoney there ara only 26 seeders at the moment and im getting only 2kb and i have a fast internet i have been downloading this for 14 hours already :(
,ragna03,2012-05-23T11:50Z,and im only at 36% :(
,Hegemoney,2012-05-24T03:54Z,"Since this is an open tracker,

Make sure your client is using a port between 60000 - 90000

Go ahead and turn on DHT and Peer Exchange

DHT and Peer Exchange both have quite a few seeds of this torrent."
