,Hrom1,2012-05-20T03:48Z,"First of all, thanks for this. Is this the same as all the other trial versions that have the amtlib workaround or is it a proper cracked copy? I've noticed that even going through all the steps on trial versions, there are missing sequence presets in Premiere Pro. I think it has something to do with those presets not authenticating with adobe's servers when Premiere launches. "
,clarkewingh,2012-05-20T10:13Z,"@Hrom1: This torrent does use the amtlib.framework workaround. 
If you want to have all those presets from Premiere Pro, just launch Premiere Pro and select ""continue Trial"" before applying workaround. I haven't included this in the instructions for Premiere Pro, but you should do this right after step 6."

Using the mouse allowed me to finally  'see package contents' and continue from there.

Don't know yet whether it will make the program work indefinately but it' a start in the right direction.

I've just spent 2 days installing Win 7 on the Mac in order to use the CS4 that I had (for some reason I couldn't get Illustrator to work

Hope this helps someone. Stupid Mac"

It's all good now, even though the programs still wants to phone home. The tryout is gone from the splash screen. I think I'll investigate that little snitch thingy. I also found when I renamed the amtlib folder with bak at the end, stopped the programs from opening, so I changed it back to the original name. Don't know yet how that will effect things.

,Feenixx,2012-06-13T16:37Z,"@ Shun_Di:

Sounds like it's not a problem with this torrent, the install or the crack, but rather that your version of Mac OS X isn't updated/recent enough for you to run CS6. If you are running an older version of OX X like Tiger (with is 10.4) or Leopard (which is 10.5), or a version of Snow Leopard (10.6) that isn't updated enough, then you can't run CS6. 

Adobe's official system requirements for CS6 state that you need OS X 10.6.8, or any version of 10.7. Make sure your system is updated, then try it again. "
,Feenixx,2012-06-13T16:40Z,"Quick question . . . If I use the tried and true Adobe Blocker with this, along with a CS6 serial, will it work? So far, every where I look everybody describes these install methods where you have to remain offline when in use after install, or replace certain files, etc. 

I know from personal experience that CS4, CS5, and CS5.5 all had the same security flaw that allowed you to use the exact same Adobe Blocker to keep it from phoning home. And after running the blocker once, you never have to do it again, or worry about swapping out files, or worry about staying offline. Does this not work anymore?"

### END OF THE crack_cs6.sh

3) Open Terminal app ( /Applications/Utilities/Terminal )

4) Drag&Drop crack_cs6.sh into Terminal window and hit Enter. That is all.

Note: If you have your CS6 installed in deferent location then /Applications, you have to Drag&Drop your installation directory into Terminal window before hitting Enter in step 4)"

Check with the developer to make sure Photoshop CS6 works with this version of.... blah blah.  

When I remove the folder and rename the .bak to the original again then I can open the app and continue my 30 days trial.. Have tried everything. Keeping it off the net. Have installed 4 times and even watched youtube videos to make sure not being silly. Any ideas???"

If we follow the instructions and have replaced all the amtlib.framework files for each application, can we then reconnect to the internet without any other steps to block Adobe?  Does this take care of that issue?  Thanks again."

,mysticav,2012-08-29T04:23Z,"After to much troubles, I found the definitive solution, and I would like to share it.

My problem was that no matter all the domains I added on /etc/hosts, somehow Adobe was able to connect and revoke the serial number.

So my solution is:
After you enter serial, offline activation etc. Follow this:

1) Disable adobe updates:

(This tutorial is for windows, just change note that the path in mac is The path in mac /Library/Application Support/Adobe)
http://www.ehow.com/how_8381056_disable-adobe-update-manager.html

2) Block adobe_licutil:
Just open Security & Privacy (Mac Firewall), add this application:
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/OOBE/PDApp/P6/adobe_licutil
And block incoming connections.

3) Also add at least these domains to /etc/host

127.0.0.1	lm.licenses.adobe.com
127.0.0.1	adobeid-na1.services.adobe.com
127.0.0.1	lm-prd-da1.licenses.adobe.com

There's an application called Privacy Eye. With that app you can monitor incoming and outcoming traffic. So you can detect the domains to which adobe is connecting to for validation."

,elvakan91,2012-09-07T18:10Z,is this working with Mt Lion?
,digitus78,2012-09-12T09:17Z,"If anyone is still having problems with the activation even if you followed every step to the letter.  Here is another solution that might work.

You dont have to reinstall Adobe CSMC either.

1.  Download a app called TexWrangler and install it.

2.  Disconnect from the internet via disable your connection or pull your cord.

3. Open up your keygen and follow the steps of getting the serial then the request code etc etc. 

4. Now go to terminal and type ""sudo edit /private/etc/hosts""  without the quotes.  This will bring up TextWrangler and open your hosts file.

5.  Now put in your adobe links you want to block.  I used :
127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobeid-na1.services.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lm-prd-da1.licenses.adobe.com

6. Here is a important step.  IF you have a line in your hosts file like this fe80::1%lo0     localhost ... make sure any addresses you want to block or reroute are above this line or it wont work.

7.  Look at the the very bottom bar on the app it will have options like changing your unicode and file format type.  It must say Unix(LF) so select it and then save the file.  

8.  Make sure the edit worked by reopening the file or using terminal to take a peak.

9.  Reconnect your Internet and launch your favorite adobe program.  Photoshop is the app that calls home alot so use that one just to be sure.  

10.  If everything worked then update to the latest and enjoy your apps :)."
,whaletail935,2012-09-15T09:54Z,"Unbelievably, this worked for me immediately with the posted directions (except for Illustrator, which I don't need anyway).

A tip for any that should need it: You must rename the amtlib Folders for each application (add bak), then duplicate the provided amtlib Folder and copy it into the Frameworks folder for each application. 

The provided directions confused me a bit as they refer to amtlib FILES (as opposed to FOLDERS).

Also, for me, when installing, I didn't get a ""Continue with Trial"" prompt, but rather a ""Connect Later"" (or something similar) prompt.  In any case, I simply hit return and it installed.

Finally, unlike with so many of these torrents, I WAS ABLE TO UPDATE WITH NO PROBLEMS.

Thanks so much for this user-friendly torrent."

,reget222,2012-09-21T20:10Z,"For those who notice that the ""About Illustrator..."" (Illustrator > About Illustrator...) says ""Adobe Illustrator CS6 Trial""- 

Don't worry it's not a trial version... i freaked out but then realized that it's simply because in the text instructions including in the torrent file it doesn't mention it in step #8- 

8. ""Show Package Contents"" of Adobe Illustrator CS6 and navigate to Contents/Resources/
   Delete ""ai_cs6_splash_tryout.png""
   Rename ""ai_cs6_splash.png"" to ""ai_cs6_splash_tryout.png""

that you should also so the same to the file ""ai_about_trial.png"" (in the same folder): 

1. Delete ""ai_about_trial.png"" file
2. Rename ""ai_about.png"" to ""ai_about_trial.png""

Info: I just successfully installed Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign on my Macbook Air, Mac OS X (10.7.4), followed instructions included to a T, don't forget to select trial version, and also turned on firewall in system preferences > security and added adobe_licutil.app to list, select ""block incoming connection"". also for added measure, opened up terminal (sudo nano /etc/hosts) added suggested blocked sites. I used specific instruction for MAC OS X here: http://www.leftcolumn.net/2009/07/04/adding-an-entry-to-etchosts-on-os-x/. 

THANKSS!!!!!!"
,syzgia,2012-09-23T21:41Z,"Thanks so much! I'm so grateful I registered to let others know that this really worked. 
My OS is Mountain Lion and it appears to have installed fine.

I actually did the exact same thing as whaletail935 and hit register with serial number rather than run as trial. The instructions weren't very clear on which option we should have chosen, but I figured if we were given a file with two serial numbers that I should choose the first option. (By the way the first serial number worked fine for me)

After that I followed the rest of the instructions word for word, hitting Connect Later as opposed to Continue with Trial. 

I'm a little worried this might not have worked because whenever I click 'Help' on any program and bring down the drop down menu the options for 'Deactivate,' 'Update,' and 'Product Registration' aren't selectable. I'll check back in 7 days since that's when the installation said the programs would stop working if I didn't properly connect to the adobe server.

If this does in fact become a problem, I'll be cleaning Adobe off my laptop and try installing it with reget222's method.

Thanks!"
