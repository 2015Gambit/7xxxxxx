Microsoft Office Word 2010 allows you to create and edit personal and business documents, such as letters, reports, invoices, emails and books. 

By default, documents saved in Word 2010 are saved with the .docx extension. Microsoft Word can be used for the following purposes:

To create business documents having various graphics including pictures, charts, and diagrams.

To store and reuse ready-made content and formatted elements such as cover pages and sidebars.

To create letters and letterheads for personal and business purpose.

To design different documents such as resumes or invitation cards etc.

To create a range of correspondence from a simple office memo to legal copies and reference documents.

This tutorial has been written keeping beginners as prime readers, though there are various topics which will be beneficial for advanced users as well.

I also assume, you have basic knowledge about a Personal Computer like mouse, keyboard, Monitor etc.

I minimized most of the window screen captures just to reduce the size and fit in the area of the this tutorial. Practically you would work with maximized windows of your word application.
