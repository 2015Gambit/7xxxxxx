,1playboy1,2012-06-03T00:28Z,masshorde. you need a usb stick which is a chip called jailbreak. but first to use it your firewall on your ps3 needs to be 3.41. then get a program called multiman and install it to your ps3 via a usb stick. then buy a external hard drive and format it to fat32. this can be done only with windows xp. then download the games and transfer them to the external hard drive. conect the hd to your ps3 and you will find your games listed in the multiman section. if the game is more then 5g then you need to copy it to your internal hd of the ps3. make sure you have an original game in the ps3 drive or it wont work.
