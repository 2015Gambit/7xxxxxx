Part of BBC Four's Handmade in Britain series made in collaboration with the Victoria and Albert Museum, treasures are drawn from all corners of the UK in a celebration of the best of British decorative ironwork.

2)  Knights Tale 
As part of the Handmade in Britain season, in conjunction with the Victoria & Albert Museum, art historian and curator Tobias Capwell celebrates the great age of armour. Referencing the unstoppable rise of the Royal Almain Armoury at Greenwich, he tells the forgotten story of how Henry VIII fused German high technology with Renaissance artistry in the pursuit of one aim - to become the very image of the perfect knight. Using the talents of foreign craftsmen and his court artist Hans Holbein, Henry transformed himself into a living metal sculpture. His daughter Elizabeth I further exploited that image, making her courtiers parade before her in the most innovate and richly decorated works ever commissioned in steel.
