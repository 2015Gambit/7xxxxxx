[T],Snowhiter,2012-05-22T21:49Z,"As this season is now over - I will now also be uploading the original Israeli series 'Prisoners Of War' aka Hatufim here on TPB with Hardcoded subtitles

This was the inspiration behind the US hit 'Homeland' but is a much more complex story.

Will upload 1 per week along with Season 2 of Braquo"
,redcoatfrench,2012-05-23T00:10Z,"Thanks again for uploading this series and for the recommendation of Braquo - started watching series 1, only episode 1 so far - quite different from the Swedish show but seems to be good. Certainly better than the American rubbish!!"
,redcoatfrench,2012-05-23T02:06Z,"One question though - is it just me, or why is it on all downloads for The Bridge, under trackers I have 4 listings that say ""invalid URL"" and then there are 0 seeds and peers. I'm still new to this so trying to figure it out! Thanks."
,mistersix,2012-05-24T02:24Z,Great work Sno! Really enjoyed the show. 
,max_i_girl,2012-05-27T17:02Z,Thank you very much! 
,bb123x,2012-06-09T01:16Z,"Snowhiter, your files are truly a gift to all mankind.  Thanks very much. "
