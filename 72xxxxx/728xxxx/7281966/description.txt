"Two Birds" 

Detective Britten doesn't know who to 
trust when the truth behind the 
accident begins to reveal itself and 
a high-ranking conspiracy threatens 
both of his realities. In a moment of 
frustration, Britten decides to take 
the law into his own hands and goes 
after Detective Hawkins, putting 
himself and Bird in the crosshairs of 
the conspirators. Captain Harper is 
instructed to clean up the mess. 
Later, when questioned about his 
partner, Detective Vega begins to 
have concerns about his Captain's 
intentions.
