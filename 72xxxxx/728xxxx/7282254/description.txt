Brief Highlights
-----------------
* extremely fun to play
* great for all ages
* extremely light: can be played on all systems
* portable: can be carried with you on your USB/Portable Media Device
* stealth: leaves no trash behind
* i used to copy into Windows 7's program files directory, but had to do that
every time i did a re-install.. With this.. i install to "D" partition and
it continues to work even after a clean install :)
