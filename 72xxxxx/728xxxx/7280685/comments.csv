,Matinator10,2012-05-19T20:03Z,title is incorrect...should be to 7.34b
,hwangtinglee,2012-05-19T20:37Z,"Thank you for the update, really appreciate everything you provided. The problem with the Ă&#x153;ber Lifestream Hollow Monster Fest has finally been fixed with it. However the Oasis map (for pvp and monster fest as well) stilll cannot be accessed, the game will simply crash (which also started to occur after update 7.33.) Will there be a fix for this, or should just wait for the up coming update patch 7.35?"
,hwangtinglee,2012-05-19T21:03Z,"I apologize for double post, but the crash mention above only seems to happen when loading the ""Oasis Monster Fest"" challenge but not the ""Oasis PvP,"" sorry about the misinformation."
,kompas909,2012-05-20T07:07Z,"Yep, fail, it's 7.34b, sorry for that.

I'll look into that map"
,kaz050,2012-05-20T07:50Z,Well a few of the maps crash more then just 1
,kompas909,2012-05-20T15:28Z,"Hmm, with next update I'll uplaod full client agen, cus i don't have any crashes :/"
,kaz050,2012-05-20T17:08Z,then maybe its a bad download so i will redownload and see what happens. i know all the maps worked from 7.32 7.33.
,kaz050,2012-05-20T19:39Z,same maps crash few of them as far as i know
,luck221,2012-05-20T19:40Z,"Thanks for the speedy updates!

However, I've noticed that the Summoner class is unlocked and playable already? Aren't they to be released a little later this week?"
,kaz050,2012-05-20T22:24Z,luck221 can you play on all the maps or you just crash?
,luck221,2012-05-20T23:03Z,"I crash on all the Eternia shards maps, hopefully it's fixed with the next patch."
,kompas909,2012-05-21T06:12Z,"Ethernia shars crashes, cus its still haven't been updated, I'll release patch later today for fixing it.

About the summoner class, it haven't been realsed officialy, but our crack, unlocking all contest so it unlock and summoner, well i think it still have lot of bugs, but you free to play with him ;)"
