    P.S. to any devs who made this game that watch these torrents: Great game, will buy as soon as my check comes in next month :P"
,Xantex82,2012-05-01T07:51Z,"Wanted to tell the devs that watch these torrents. I know it sucks that some of us pirate. I am currently unemployed after being laid-off from the hospital. Money is tight atm, but as soon as I secure another job, purchasing your game will be one of my top priorities. Thanks for all the great hours of entertainment you supplied so far. :D"

@Xantex82
I've talked to one of the devs on one of my older uploads, and he actually seems fine with pirating for testing games or being short on money. Glad to hear you both plan on buying the game later on, I'm sure they appreciate it :)"
,Lenhoy,2012-05-04T18:58Z,"I tried to buy it at desura but, i can't pay with my card... i'm only 13 and i can pay online when i'm 14 or 15..
And my parents didn't want to buy the game :("

,nicholas678,2012-05-12T23:09Z,sorry for the double comment
,ChezTehL33T,2012-05-17T10:08Z,"For those of you wondering why it closes after 5-10mins, it's because Towns is not compatible with AMD graphics. There no patch or fix for this. So either so don't play it or save a lot. "
,grafx1,2012-05-25T18:37Z,upload 0.56 please
,skelaturi,2012-05-26T03:20Z,"@nicholas678

@grafx1
Yes indeed give us 0.56 but first give us 0.46 wich is already released ^^"
,skelaturi,2012-05-27T21:46Z,"ok screw 0.46 give 0.47

Fix: Added specific code for ATI users to solve the nasty crash"
