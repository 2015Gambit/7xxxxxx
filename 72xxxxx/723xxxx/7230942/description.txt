You may be reading this book for many reasons. It could be because you heard all about
Hadoop and what it can do to crunch petabytes of data in a reasonable amount of time.
While reading into Hadoop you found that, for random access to the accumulated data,
there is something called HBase. Or it was the hype that is prevalent these days ad-
dressing a new kind of data storage architecture. It strives to solve large-scale data
problems where traditional solutions may be either too involved or cost-prohibitive. A
common term used in this area is NoSQL.
