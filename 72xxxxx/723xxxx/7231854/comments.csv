[T],bzingaz,2012-05-03T16:15Z,i have seen sometimes this problem..sometimes if its low config pc..then when u skip forward or backward screen flickers..or sometimes i have seen that it may be a software bug..so formatting pc may solve this..if u have a low config pc ..try upgrading it or try to get a graphic card..hope this helps..
