NOTES
Well Well Well......

Same story as our last INT. GNVR released
the WEB version of this years Qlimax
anthem.

And again some other group released the
"vinyl" uhum some time ago. Compare the
GNVR web with the other groups "vinyl"
and see that they are identical twins

To make your life easier we included 
a pic that shows you the above

How nice and real :) ow yeah this release
also has a vinyl PROOF pic again........

End of statement.....beep
