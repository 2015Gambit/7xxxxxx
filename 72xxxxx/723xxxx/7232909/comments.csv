Your other upload of this has been deleted."

I was planning on uploading the full season 2 of ALL ZR's files -- his versions of ep. 1-11 have better colours and slightly fewer compression artifacts than my Luna Eclipsed and the old PA files.

I'm also in the middle of fixing the iTunes-included English subtitles (and I'm nowhere NEAR done, lulz).  I was planning on adding that to my S2 torrent, among other goodies."
