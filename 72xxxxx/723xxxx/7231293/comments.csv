Come on, really? Typically it hovers between 10 and 20kb/s down, but has no problem instantly maximizing my upload bandwidth...

Seed, you selfish pinheads."
,Wendie52,2012-05-01T07:11Z,Thanks
,steffipeterson,2012-05-01T08:59Z,it came down slower than usual for me too.... normally i can get it down in less than a half hour but it took almost 2 hrs tonight!  If ppl would simply seed for a few hours even after they download it.... or until you have more seeders than leechers.... too bad piratebay doesnt penalize you for not seeding...
,LCFer,2012-05-01T09:31Z,the upload is set to unlimited on my bitorrent but it never gets above 5kbps even with things that I already are at 100%. anyone know why?
,ManchesterIsRed,2012-05-01T10:54Z,Cheers eztv.  Will seed.  Keep up the good work.
