,nmourtos11,2012-05-01T22:41Z,"Froggie100, you continue to get warnings to stop posting CAM's in the high res section. You're videos get re-categorized, you get negative postings and quality ratings, yet you continue to do it, why?

To all looking for BR rips and HD content, you mind as well ignore all this users uploads.

[V],froggie100,2012-05-06T03:23Z,blame the site.. not me..... i put this is non high res type..... the stupid bot keeps changing it to high res.. all becasue it has 720p in the title..... so.. not my fault here...
,Neonridr,2012-05-06T17:51Z,"Don't blame froggie100 on this one.  His torrents are always amazing.  Anytime I am looking for a high res video, I always look for froggie's.  Keep up the awesome work froggie!"
,m00se1207,2012-05-07T03:05Z,"@Neonridr
Either you are froggie100 or you know him personally, or you must not have good eyesight, Saying that he always has quality uploads is total BS I have NEVER downloaded a copy of anything good from froggie100 all of his rips are no good. 

@froggie100 if what you say is true then stop putting 720p in the titles, when were looking for high res movies we are obviously not looking for a cam version. Don't get me wrong I appreciate the effort and maybe some people enjoy your rips, but the rest of us don't and don't like seeing your cam uploads every time we look for a high res movie"
,keallineage,2012-05-09T02:28Z,Froggie does an amazing job but sometimes crap happens... lighten up ppl! 
,SSJASON,2012-05-09T22:58Z,"@ironymon if you don't like it GTFO stop bitching about free shit.

As always thanks for the upload Froggie"
