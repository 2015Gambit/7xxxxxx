,Morachi51,2012-05-05T10:47Z,Worked for me. I advise to look in the crack folder for the txt file and change the hosts because blocking the app with firewall or little snitch will be not sufficient.

4. replace the ""amtlib.framework"" with the one you found in the .dmg file.

Steps:
1) Run install and install in trial mode. Do everything it asks you, including providing an adobe ID.

2) Run the program after installation and then completely quit the program.

3) Replace the cracked file in the frameworks folder. I had to open the PS CS6 folder in my applications folder, then right click on Photoshop CS6>Show Package Contents (near the top of the list)>Contents>Frameworks>amtlib.framework. DELETE EVERYTHING IN THAT FOLDER AND THEN COPY THE CONTENTS FROM THE CRACKED FOLDER TO IT.

4) Before you open the program, go to your system preferences>security & privacy>firewall>unlock to make changes>firewall options>click the ""+"">select the photoshop CS6 app>then click the two arrows to the right of the program in the list and select the red ""Block incoming connections"".

5) Open the program and all should be good. If you get an error, run the uninstall script and be sure to remove the preferences. Then just try installing it again."

,temperament97,2012-07-17T22:50Z,"If you follow all instructions, this torrent works amazingly well. Make sure to have your internet connection OFF throughout the WHOLE process and when you're done installing and before opening it up, make sure to do the amtlib.framework thing, and to use your firewall to block all incoming connections to Photoshop CS6. This way you can use your internet while also using photoshop."
,Muffin_Top,2012-07-27T09:06Z,WOW! this really worked! GREAT TORRENT! i didnt really get how to make it into extended version but i dont care cuz i got a few 3d text making programs
,nbmatt,2012-07-28T01:32Z,"Thanks for the upload, muchacho! 

For anyone that may have trouble with the included instructions, maybe I can be of some assistance:

1. Mount .dmg found in the folder you just downloaded
2. Inside that .dmg you'll see Photoshop_13_LS16.dmg, mount it as well.
3. Before you begin to install Photoshop you should edit your hosts file to prevent it from phoning home if you don't have Little Snitch to do that for you. If you do have LS skip to number four.

3a. With Finder in focus (as in it says Finder by the Apple on the menubar) chose ""Go to Folder"" from the ""Go"" menu.
3b. Type /etc and hit enter, it will bring up the /etc/ folder that is normally hidden.
3c. Find the ""hosts"" file and duplicate it. Rename the duplicate something like ""hosts-backup"".
3d. Open ""hosts"" in TextEdit (you'll have to authenticate a few times during all of this) and paste this information [ http://pastebay.net/1069307 ] at the end of the document. DO NOT ERASE ANYTHING, ONLY APPEND. Save the edited file and make sure to uncheck the ""if no extension assume .txt"" box near the bottom of the save dialog.

4. Run the installer located in Photoshop_13_LS16.dmg.
5. Once the install is complete launch the application and choose the trial mode.
6. After it has launched completely quit the application.
7. Open the Adobe Photoshop CS6.app file (not just the blue folder it comes in) by right-clicking it and selecting ""Show Package Contents"".
8. Navigate to Contents/Frameworks
9. Duplicate amtlib.framework and rename one of them ""amtlib.framework-bck""
10. Finally, drag the amtlib.framework from the ""Adobe CS6 OS X Crack"" folder that was in the first .dmg into the Contents/Frameworks folder.

Voila, you're done. Hopefully this will have been specific enough to stop all of the stupid questions."
,nbmatt,2012-07-28T01:41Z,"I forgot to include that you must flush your DNS from Terminal after you edit and save the hosts file. 

To do that you need to open Terminal once you're done with the hosts file and input the following command: 

sudo dscacheutil -flushdns

It'll ask for your password and when you're done with that continue on with the instructions."

,FThisSht,2012-09-01T16:03Z,"Doesn't work for me on my MacBook Pro OS X (V 10.7.4).  I don't know what I did wrong.  I followed all tgt55's directions, but when I tried to run it, I got this: 

""Adobe Photoshop CS6 cannot be opened because of a problem.

Check with the developer to make sure Adobe Photoshop CS6 works with this version of Mac OS X.
You may need to reinstall the application.  Be sure to install any updates for the application and Mac OS X.""

Any ideas?"
,FThisSht,2012-09-01T16:07Z,"@tgt55:  Followed your instructions and got an error message.  You said, if that happens, to uninstall it and make sure to remove the preferences.  WHAT preferences?"

It worked for me on Mountain Lion. I've just followed the crack instructions.

• Disconnect from the Internet (or block outgoing connections) and install the trial version.
• When installing, select ""Trial""!
• After installation, launch and complete the application once, blocking any outgoing connections.
• Replace (keep a copy of the original just in case) amtlib.framework located in Application_Name.app / Contents / Frameworks / with [k'ed] one.

,darknebula,2012-09-21T18:31Z,"Everyone. 

I did exactly as described. Several times. Somehow it doesn't want to work. As soon as I replace the file to the crack file, the PS CS6 doesn't want to launch the program, said some kind of failure message. 

I tried to uninstall and reinstall. Doesn't work. 

And trial to add the code to the hosts failed because the hosts file didn't want to unlock despite terminal usage. First time terminal did ask for the password (the trial failed) the second time error message popped up. 

Irritated and disappointed. 

If there is anyone out there who has time to help me, I'd appreciate it. 

Sad Liz from Sweden."
