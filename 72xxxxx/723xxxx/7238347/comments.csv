Do you have the latest video drivers? Often this is the issue."
,Tigellinus,2012-05-04T08:54Z,"This game is so unstable its freaking unbelievable! And it doesn't have proper autosave/quicksave system so constant crashes are even more painful.

Shame, cos game is great and I would even consider buying it but yeah CTDs ruin it all."

,Dimmis80,2012-05-07T17:42Z,@Dennmell did u try the update/patch-crack from @scene4all.!?http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7242121/Port.Royale.3.v1.1.Update-SKIDROW.I have not played the game without the patch and for my system it looks very stable plays very smooth and no CTD at all.!Also if the CTD continues after the patch u might have to update your graphicks-sound-motherboard drivers with the latest there are.Give it a try and post later.Btw @extremezone the Best Video PC Games Uploader in the net..You are the best dude and Green/VIP scull well deserved.So be cool and always safe keep up the awesome work and keep the games rolling.Cheers mate.:-)
,Moonshaft,2012-05-07T22:29Z,"@ BZant

In order to block the game from having access to the internet from Windows Firewall, follow these instructions (if you are running a Windows 7 OS) :

Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Firewall > Advanced Settings (on the left) > Outbound Rules (on the left) > New Rule (on the right)

-- Make sure Program is bubbled in
-- This program path: (guide it to the .exe directory)
-- Block the Connection
-- Domain, Private, and Public should be checked
-- Name it whatever you want (description is optional)


And you should be done!"

,dennmell,2012-05-08T15:22Z,"@Dimmis80
Yes all the things u said is already done
I don't have CTD I'm having the very frastrating crash when you enter or leave cities not often but happens a lot!!!Any solution on that yet??The affinity solution just stop the continious crashes but it doesn't solve the issue!
PLEASE forgive my english"

I intalled the game twice and am still having the same problem. 


Problem = white boxes over all text, buttons, and cities inside the game..........anyone have an idea what the cause of this is "
,Tyl0rC,2012-05-09T20:59Z,"If you're crashing, you probably did something wrong.  I'm running Windows Vista and a Radeon HD 4650 (haha) perfectly fine.

The game sucks though, seriously.  They don't explain anything to you in the tutorials ""We'll talk more about that later..."" and it's just...not fun.

Thanks again, extremezone, another great torrent, although not a recommended one."

,MrCorrect,2012-06-19T20:49Z,"IHUSTLEU, are you just a newbie? Or are you just really a ding-dong? The SKIDROW folder is in the ""mounted"" ISO image. But that takes mounting it with Daemon tools, or some other ISO image manipulator. And some pure common sense. And we all know that ""common sense isn't common""."
