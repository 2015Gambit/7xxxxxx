[V],Nepotu,2012-05-03T15:24Z,The real Jazz @ Spurs game here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7238081/NBA.2012.Playoffs.WCR1.G2-1(02_may).UTA.Jazz_SA.Spurs.720p
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-03T15:30Z,@aannddii: This is the way that the ripper put it in the torrent. You don't have to DL the first game again. You have to deselect the first game from the torrent list and DL only the second game.
,aannddii,2012-05-03T16:43Z,Thanks my friend
,aannddii,2012-05-03T17:03Z,Can you give more specific discription on haw i can do that????
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-03T17:12Z,"I use utorrent, but other torrent clients are the same.
1. Get the torrent
2. Start the torrent
3. After the torrent shows his lenghts (4.65 GB) stop the file DL, and in the window from below open the File tab (you have File, Information, Peers etc tabs).
4 Select with mouse the first file, click right and then select ""Don't download""
5 Possibly you have to click right on the torrent file and select ""Force verification"", something like that. "
