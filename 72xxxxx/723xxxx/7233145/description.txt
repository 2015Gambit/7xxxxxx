Where these came from before thebox.bz that is unclear. There are issues
with aspect ratio and letter boxing. VLC and other modern video players will
allow these to be corrected while viewing. It appears that Windows Media
Player will not.

To re-encode these risked losing quality, and would have prevented others who 
already have these files from seeding this torrent without downloading again.

The aspect ratio flag for the series 1 files is set to 16:9. But it should
have been set to 4:3. It seems that these were was captured as a 16:9 video
letter-boxed (black bars above and below) within a 4:3 feed. These bars got
encoed into the video files. So view the video with the aspect ratio overridden
to 4:3, and then also "crop" the video to 16:9 to remove the black bars to get
it to display full-screen correctly on displays wider than 4:3.

The aspect ratio flag for the series 2 files is set to 4:3. But it should have
been set to 16:9. So view the video with the aspect ratio overridden to 16:9.
It is not necessary to crop the series 2 videos.

OVERVIEW

Distant Shores is a comedy-drama first shown in the UK on ITV1 in January 2005.

Peter Davison plays high flying London plastic surgeon Bill Shore. His marriage
is on the rocks and his wife Lisa played by Samantha Bond has got a six month
research job on a small Northumbrian island called Hildasay. Bill reluctantly
agrees to relocate on the island with his wife, goth daughter, son and dog.

Series 2 was produced, but has yet to air on ITV. It has aired in Canada and in
some European countries, but not in the UK. And ITV has said they have no plans
to screen it.
