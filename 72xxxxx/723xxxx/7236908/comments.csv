,OButton,2012-05-03T14:04Z,Thanks for all the great ups. May I please request Supurbia #3?

they needed a way to reintroduce PG, does anyone else miss the old uniform?
I just don't get Robin sorry Huntress or what ever she will become, the new dcu is too confusing, it's starting to look like a soap, need to get all issues to understand a strange story line.
In the new 52 Animal Man looks decent."
