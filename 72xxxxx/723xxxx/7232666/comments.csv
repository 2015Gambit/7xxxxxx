When you upload a video this size, it takes several days, 5-10 to download at the slow pace of some ISPs. With last weeks race, the seeding stopped after a couple of days and a week later, yesterday, I dumped it with it stuck at about 10% for several days. Us overseas fans, that usually don'e complain need xvid or avi files of less than 1.5 gig, and someone to stay on and SEED!"

When I do upload there is usually a swarm of around 100 leechers (minimum at start) and after 30 or so brake through I abandon it. If a few out of the 30 or following 300 cannot find the time to share and seed maybe I should just find more appreciative things to upload. Cannot baby sit these if others are unwilling to share and want to hit and run. I have taken my files from over 20 gigs of HD per race to suit some (and many want those back). Going smaller is not an option, sorry."
