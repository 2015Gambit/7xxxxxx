"The Guidance Counselor"

Sue finds a kindred spirit in her awkward 
school guidance counselor, Jane Marsh 
(Whoopi Goldberg), who inspires her to 
reinvent herself. Meanwhile, Frankie is 
ecstatic when she and Mike buy a much 
needed new bed but is gobsmacked when her 
stubborn husband insists on assembling it 
himself; and Brick attempts to call the 
President to outlaw the Presidential 
Fitness Challenge, which would force him 
to accomplish some strenuous physical 
exercises at school.

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
