,LionOfGod,2012-07-13T09:50Z,"Excellent torrent, finally got vmware workstation :D
Notes:
If you have an older version of Workstation installed and the installer cannot uninstall it, run
vmware-installer -l
it will list installed products
Then
vmware-installer --uninstall-product PRODUCT
Also, some may have trouble installing the vmnet module, the error I had was 
""Failed to compile module vmnet!"", it was in the log file, try running the patch at 
http://weltall.heliohost.org/wordpress/2012/01/26/vmware-workstation-8-0-2-player-4-0-2-fix-for-linux-kernel-3-2-and-3-3/

just modify the script for vmware 8.0.3 and remove the .patches file which was already present for some reason (It will list the directory the patches file is in).
Thanks scene for excellent torrent."
