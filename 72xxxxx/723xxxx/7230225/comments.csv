Love to have your stuff but you must have some settings wrong as not one of your torrents has uploaded at all, from what I can see."
[T],bill_214,2012-06-14T19:57Z,"Again... 

note that if you have the files you want to upload somewhere other than the default folder that your bittorrent client downloads to you either need to move it to that default folder 

OR 

set the ""download"" location to where the file you want to upload is (or in this case the ""upload"", however it will probably still say ""download"" location)

So for instance IF when you downloaded the file you either moved it to another folder or you burned it to disc then you need to reset that particular ""download"" location to where the file is NOW."
