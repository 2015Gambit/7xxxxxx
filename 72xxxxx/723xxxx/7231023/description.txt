In the far distant future, people live in large, domed moving cities, because the outside air is poisonous and bug like monsters known as Contaminoids wander the earth. Zuelleni is an academic city where pretty much the entire population is made up of students and everything is run by the student council president. Layfon, a teenage boy with a mysterious past, comes to Zuelleni to escape said past. He wants to start his life anew, as a regular, average student. But too bad for him - upon arriving at school for the first day, he is immediately forced into the military arts program. He is assigned to the 17th Platoon, after leader Nina asks for him to fill a recently vacated spot on the team. The rest of the platoon consists of mechanical ace Harley, sharpshooter and ladies man Sharnid, and ne'in operator Felli. However, it is pretty soon evident that Layfon isn't in any need of military training.....
