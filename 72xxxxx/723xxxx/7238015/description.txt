American.Digger.S01E07.hdtv.xvid-wrcr][ Blood, Sweat, and Money (Tombstone) ][ 03-May-2012 ] avi


Ive rebundled and named correctly the episode listed as s01e01 so people
dont get confused..

tvrage was wrongly calling this episode 1 but now have updated their
listings to match spikes listings here 
http://www.spike.com/shows/american-digger/episode-guide

you can see clearly its listed as 107 ans 101 is ice cold cash
and was promo-ed in Ep6

hope that clears things up.. perhaps they used this episode in a short
pilot promo which caused much confusion? I dont know

anyhow this one they visiting the old west..
some really hate these cowboys digging up the place without proper
documenting the process and trying to get the show banned so to prevent
more cowboys trying to make the fast buck out of this idea :)

help to seed if grabbing and if you got the other ep1 perhaps chip
in as a seeder after renaming it to match :)

enjoy
