However, just a suggestion, it would be good if you provided a bit more info on (1) the characteristics of the file, i.e., video/audio properties, and (2) a brief description of the contect even though I realise it is easy enough to look up."
,poitras,2012-05-04T11:05Z,"This movie is a piece of crap. Only reason I stuck in to the end was because it's just over an hour long. If it was any longer I would have bailed pretty early. It's not scary, funny, or campy. It's just bad.
