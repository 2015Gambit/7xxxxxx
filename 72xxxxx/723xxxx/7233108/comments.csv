I tried to re-encode it with Pinnacle Studio 15 so I could get it down to the file size most other half-hour shows usually are (174MB) but it didn't work out so well. If anyone can recommend a conversion program that allows me to set a custom bitrate, let me know. I'm still learning the ropes with encoding. :) In the meantime, I'm going to post the original (280MB)"
,_alphonse_,2012-05-01T23:03Z,Thanks for the upload! To bad the audio is out of sync... Read that you are new to encoding so some glitches are probably to be expected in the beginning. Just keep it up and you will become better with time. Thanks again!

And before anyone else points it out, the program caught parts of my desktop with it! :/ I'm using new programs I've never used before, and I'm still not able to find the right settings to keep it from getting pixelated at 175MB, so I'm gonna resubmit it in a bit at the original size. It took 5 *more* tries but I finally got it right! :)"
