Surely, you'd like to know where the Earth ends, what surrounds the Earth, how far it is to the Moon and the stars, why the stars sparkle, why a ball you throw up always falls down, why it's warmer in the Sun in summer, why the Moon is round┬╖one day and crescent-shaped another, and what other planets there are besides the Earth. The answers to these and many 'other questions are contained in P. Klushantsev's book All About the Telescope
