,BradMacPro,2012-05-03T16:50Z,"It works for the most part, unless you deal with Camera Raw and probably there are other issues."
[T],NoggintheNomad,2012-05-03T23:18Z,"Look, this isn't even released yet. Grow up guys and be patient. What's the point of PS without RAW? OK, we all know Adobe is overpriced, bloated and totally incompatible with Macs. And we all know that apart from PS and AI it's utter crap. InDesign has nothing on QXP. I'm sticking with CS5 until the 'real' thing is available. Even then, Adobe hasn't got its head around 64-bit yet. Doubt if it will with CS6. Look at the Flash fiasco. Not Mac-friendly software."
,phenix88be,2012-05-04T01:49Z,"Well it s true, not released, but its not the first time we have a software before the release.

I like this CS :) http://d.pr/i/okak"
,nunztorrent,2012-05-05T04:01Z,"I have now finished this download. Prior to installation, I have a question: Why is it necessary to replace ""amtlib.framework"" even after you alter the host file?"
,phenix88be,2012-05-05T20:02Z,Because it s a trial version ;)
,tubeamp,2012-05-05T20:33Z,"Best Adobe Rant(tm) goes to @NoggintheNomad, I could actually picture your mouth frothing while getting your hate on.

What are the options though? GiMP or Inkscape?  I'd rather put my nuts through a rusty cheese grater than use GiMP (inkscape is ok, now that the x11 constraint has been dropped)."
,nunztorrent,2012-05-06T03:04Z,"Installation is complete and the [k] works beautifully. So far, I have used Acrobat Pro X, Dreamweaver, and Photoshop Extended. And, they all work as expected. I am very happy."
,verne1964,2012-05-08T00:16Z,"Works fine, thanks a lot! But i have a problem with indesign. I can't install folio builder, overlay creator and adobe content viewr for the digital publishing suite. 

Installing the DPS Desktop Tools (InDesign CS6)
 In InDesign, choose Help > Updates, and update DPS Desktop Tools.

The DPS Desktop Tools installer installs the Folio Overlays panel, the Folio Builder panel, a required InDesign plugin, and the Desktop Viewer.

somebody knows the solution for this?
Thanks!!"

,hllw2010,2012-06-07T00:11Z,"With the risk of sounding like a dumbass, was there an option to install the English version which I somehow missed? And if not, will I have to live with the French menus for the rest of my days? I hate that language. I speak it, yes, but by God, I also hate it with a passion."
,hllw2010,2012-06-07T00:48Z,"Update: Bridge allows you to change it in-app, Photoshop is kinda easy, u just rename tw10428.dat to tw10428.bak or just delete it from the Locales folder. Still working on the others. Will let you know..."
,jonjon831,2012-06-20T06:17Z,Do I install the MasterCollection dmg first? Or do I install the trial version first? Thanks...
