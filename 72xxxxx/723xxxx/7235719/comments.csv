,marabalos,2012-05-02T22:51Z,Hi! do you know anything about the White Stripes Outtakes? The new vault pack is ready and those songs still aren't on internet

Yeah sure I do.. its a 7 Inch from Vault 11...

..which I'm still waiting to be delivered... I guess us people who don't live in the US just have to wait and wait and wait.. it took 12 weeks for my vault 10 to get to me.. so I guess I will get it when I get it....   and yes I will rip it and upload it... keep watching this space  "
,teo3rid,2012-05-03T15:41Z,"First of all, a big thanx for all the uploads. I open the Dead Weather mp4 with Windows Media Player and there's no audio in that. Do you know why? "
,Beolab1700,2012-05-03T19:49Z,"@teo3rid 

Yes, Windows Media Player does not fully support the MP4 format.

Simple Solution.  Download VLC media player from videolan.org

It free and THE best media player on the market... if VLC don't play your files nothing will."
