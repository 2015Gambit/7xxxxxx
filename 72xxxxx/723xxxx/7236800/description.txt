As the older episodes of stargate are becoming hard to get i thought i'd share all i have of Stargate SG-1. All 10 seasons complete plus the movies from 1994 and 2008.

seasons 1-5 and 7-10 are in SD quality, but still sufficient quality to enjoy.
Season 6 is of a better quality, approx. DVD quality.


S08E18 is the extended version of the originally aired version of "Threads"

Not sure if the Pilot in season 1 is the extended version.

Enjoy!
