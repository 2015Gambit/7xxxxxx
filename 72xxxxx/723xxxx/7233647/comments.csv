,davidsask,2012-05-02T10:35Z,This torrent I swear took a whole day and at end still flopping back and forth at 95 percent and over. There is no stream either you try start what is there and then no volume. I think tonyisaac you should dump this show if this is how it will be torrented and stick to American shorter shows. I am waiting it out but won't bother again with yours.
