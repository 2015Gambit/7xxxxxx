Like I said, I hope that issue was just a one off.
Otherwise, it will be arriving that late in future :("

[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-05-03T11:07Z,"Free TV without ads will always be available! Also, The Pirate Bay has survived many times when people said it was gonna shut down!! In the words of Public Enemy ""Fight the Power""!!! 
It has been a bit frustrating for me over the last few days getting these shows. But, that happens from time to time. Still looking for TOWIE :)"
