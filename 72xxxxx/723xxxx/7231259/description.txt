"Boys Will Be Boys" is an English-language dance-pop song by Mexican pop singer Paulina Rubio. The song was produced by RedOne, which makes this song his fourth collaboration with Paulina. It's expected to be the lead single of either a new Rubio's English studio album or a re-release of her tenth album, Brava!. The song was released on March 24, 2012 on iTunes and Amazon in Europe countries first and then internationally. "Boys Will Be Boys" is Rubio's first single in English since 2002.

"Boys Will Be Boys" is the third English song in which RedOne and Paulina Rubio worked on, after "All Around the World" and "Heat of the Night," and fourth overall, also including Brava!'s lead single "Me Gustas Tanto." It is mainly based on guitar riffs and synthesizers. The bridge has been compared with the one on Vengaboys' song "Boom Boom Boom Boom", and the overall production to Jennifer Lopez's hit single, "On The Floor", which was also produced by RedOne.

Backed by a dance squad and armed with the sensuality that has always characterized her, Paulina presented the song for the first time on television on the Billboard Latin Music Awards on Telemundo. 

Paulina traveled to London, UK, to film the music video for the song. The video was Directed by Yasha Malekzad and was produced by Jacuzzi Films Limited. The video was released on April, 27.

Blogger Perez Hilton gave a good impression of the song, commenting that "We just got a preview of latinalicious hottie Paulina Rubio’s new English dance track, "Boys Will Be Boys" and we’re already playing it on REPEAT." he also called it "Infectious". In contrast, Enric Zapatero from Cromosoma X gave a somewhat mixed impression, commenting that it was a weird move to promote an album with a song that's not featured on it, and stating that "'Boys Will Be Boys' has been selected by the Mexican singer as a new single and it's pretty good, [the song] is very catchy and castañuelas always sound good in a latin song". He also stated that Rubio had the "idea of sound like [Jennifer Lopez's] 'On the Floor'".
