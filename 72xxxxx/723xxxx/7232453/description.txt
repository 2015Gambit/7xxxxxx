It's a pdf of the instructors solution manual for the book Calculus A Complete Course sixth edition.

It includes answers to even and odd questions from the book. So in other words, it's better than the book you can buy from your bookstore which only has the answer to even questions only.

Hope it's comes to good use for some of you who are studying math on university :)
