I got the Idea for this torrent when I stumbled upon Jonathan Harnum's 'Basic Music Theory, How to Read, Write and Understand Music' while browsing my favortie newsgroup (a.b.sheet.music). I swept the usenets uncriticvally for every ebook I could find relating to the subject, weeded out the dupes and fakes, and wrapped it up. I haven't read even a percentage of it yet, so don't blame me if some of it's crap. I have skimmed quite a few of them, and there are great lessons to be had even for advanced academics; read Schoenberg's Fundamentals only if you are in a daring mood. However the complete basics are covered as well: both dummies' and complete idiots' guides are included. There are some great listening excersises for both singers and guitarists and even thought I havent been labelling the books by difficulty, it sohuld be the simplest task to read them progreessively judging merely by the titles. I will however recommend Harnum's 'Basic Music Theory' as a starting point for anyone who is already aquainted with an instrument.
