,festisio,2012-05-03T23:43Z,Nice one.
,Mikey320,2012-05-04T00:50Z,"The video quality is awesome, but the audio is not HQ, it is dubbed over with english audio from an R5 copy, so it does not represent Bluray sound, I would recommend waiting a couple of days for a US rip! But thats my 2 cents, Thanks for the upload anyways :) "
,rschrake,2012-05-04T02:47Z,will this play on the ps3?
,Shadow416,2012-05-04T07:57Z,"rchake, mkv is not supported by the PS3 unfortunately. (i wrote a comment already but it didn't post i guess was to long lol)

there are ways to get around it though (converting/streaming/hooking laptop/pc to tv via hdmi)"
,thomasphavong,2012-05-04T11:04Z,"Video is okay, but could still be better. Audio sounds like one of those really bad theater/camera recordings. I recommend waiting for another download if you really want to enjoy this movie. Thanks for the upload though!"
,sena940,2012-05-04T19:28Z,........seed plz.......
,jtata,2012-05-04T20:25Z,"If your trying to play this on a ps3, downloand mkvtovob. Just google and find a link to download that program. It works 90% of the time. Great for short tv episodes. Messes up on big movie files.. should work on this.  You will want to set it to either 2gb (flashdrive) or 4gb because ps3 can only read FAT formatted hardrive/thumbdrives. and you can only fit up to 4gb on FAT formatted drives."
,skutts,2012-05-04T21:13Z,"Shit quality

Video 6/10
Audio 4/10

NOT RECOMMENDED"
,nellypaal,2012-05-04T22:00Z,"I appreciate the up, but would recommend waiting for a proper BluRay rip.  Video is not up to 720p standard and audio is not much better than a cam.  Probably the best up available right now if you can't wait, but I'm going to."
,Lightness13,2012-05-04T22:39Z,"Video 6/10
Audio 4/10

Bad Quality, better just wait for a good release ^^
anyway Thx for uploading :D"
,festisio,2012-05-05T01:06Z,"Yeh the quality fucking sucks.  Absolute shit.  Juddery as fuck, overdubbed CAM audio.  I shouldn't have downloaded this until more people had commented."
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-05-05T04:33Z,"I agree this is absolute SHIT.

VERY misleading.  Don't waste your time and wait for a true 720p!

,Newguy70,2012-05-05T12:43Z,"Watched 1 minute worth,  it's veryyyyyyyyyyyy laggy. Why even upload for people to download."

,aznknight82,2012-05-05T22:25Z,"I think what's even more mysterious is how this is supposed to be a PublicHD release.  Everything else up to date have been nice releases.

But yes.  Just read the source information.  It's not a real BR-rip, as most other BR-rips go.  Not sure what CM8 THX is supposed to be referring to .... maybe the theatre that the audio was recorded had THX, but the audio almost sounds like mono."
,JokoASP,2012-05-06T05:02Z,"yes, it's sucks. A : 3 V : 3.
far from 720p. I think it's 240p or something. The top comments was misleading."
,mmmfafa,2012-05-06T13:50Z,720 my pale white ass. LAME.
,viemaillot,2012-05-07T16:17Z,"Shitty audio and video quality!

Not a decent 720p release, WASTE OF TIMEEE! >"

,Evilution,2012-05-10T01:51Z,protoyu you say look at the screenshots... they tell nothing about the crapfest of twitchyness in the video. It feels like watching a 10fps video.
,xXRubenXx,2012-05-11T11:30Z,"wtf is this, the frame rate is at 25."
,xXRubenXx,2012-05-11T11:32Z,dont waste time and space on this shit
,bigshot2,2012-05-13T23:11Z,This is rubbish.
,hah024,2012-05-15T14:27Z,21 jump street is cinavia protected and will not run on ps3.
,lilniggerboy,2012-05-19T00:16Z,Don't download this shit. The frame rate is all fucked up and the audio is fucked too. Nice try tho.

This is just a good cam version not a true BR rip."
,hc32king,2012-05-24T16:38Z,if its not bluray then how did you make dvd format to mkv??!
,INOYB1,2012-05-24T22:41Z,"1, MOVIE QUALITY:

As a movie, it is rougher in (course) language then the original TV series. LOL.  I guess in a way - maybe it makes it a bit more realistic.  Justin Nguyen's character is now a female part.

Overall, as a movie, it was fun and intended (atleast this version) for an adult audience.  Please check out the IMDB rating before showing this to youth and children under 14 or 15 years.


2. RIP QUALITY:

Unfortunately, I found this rip to be more like a better DVDRip - quality is not quite upto other 720p rips.

If you just want to watch this regardless of quality, this is fine enough.

Frames flow seem to be jerky. I expected better quality. Sound is not exactly HDef.

I will definitely be looking for a better rip to watch again.

Like some other have already said.  The Audio and Video quality leaves much to be desired; however, I think the movie itself is enjoyable. Especially, if you have every watched 21 Jump Street the TV Series, I would recommend you sit down and watch this movie and you would more than likely enjoy this updated version of the story in a contemporary setting.

Cheers :)"
,vjule,2012-05-25T23:32Z,choppy and pretty bad rip...pass
