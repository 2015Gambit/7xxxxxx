Maldia is a Band from Lugo (Spain) formed in 2006 that have been always proposing themselves new goals everytime, to finally reach the point they are right now. There have been lots of concerts (good and bad ones) in Galicia, that made them record their own homemade demo on 2008
Nowadays, Maldia wants to keep improving as a band; that's why they worked hard on their first studio Demo, recorded in the Ultra Sound Studios in Braga (Portugal) that will be available very soon in both digital and physical format
