,Dimmis80,2012-05-01T12:42Z,Hey best friend nepotu mate.Congrats for this release and a big thanks goes to chris11 and to the other great rippers.Now i have a question.I only use your 720p version of the vids that normaly are 1.5-2-2.5 or something GB and i was cool.Now i can see that u upload an 4.38 GB vid.So how come u upload a larger file vid.?Is far better quality than the other 720p or something else.??Because it will take more time now to download it and stuff.???
