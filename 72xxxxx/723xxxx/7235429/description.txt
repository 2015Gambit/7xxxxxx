Family Reunion
Released Apr 29, 2012

Without family around, Khloe and Lamar are still having a tough time adjusting to life in Dallas. But that doesn't last long when Kris and Rob come to visit--and even bring along a huge surprise for Khloe! However, when Khloe and Lamar find out that Rob won't be hanging around  long, they give him an offer he can't refuse. Or can he? Meanwhile, Kris starts rubbing shoulders with the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and Khloe's not happy about it.
