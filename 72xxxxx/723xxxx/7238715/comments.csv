,truthy,2012-06-28T17:59Z,thx for sharing! the included english subs are quite terrible (same as for the MySiLU release) bad english out of sync and with a lot of lines missing.
[T],mclevels,2012-06-29T08:14Z,"The Subtitles have typos and are out of sync, so in VLC Media Player, you can go to Tools ---> Track Sync. Then set Advance of subtitles over video to -6.000 s. I tried to look for better subs but this is the next best option I guess, hope it helps.

If you don't use VLC media player, it's worth googling and downloading, it's easier than finding working subtitles trust me."

,truthy,2012-07-31T17:41Z,"the 2 hd releases MySiLU/WiKi are the CUT version of the movie that's why all available english subs don't work (additional lines/scenes) even if you change the delay 50 times during playback!

comparison 25fps: uncut: 1h41m51s cut: 1h38m12s

you'r better off watching/downloading the uncut dvdrip here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6327659/Carne_de_neon%5BDVDrip%5D%5BAC3_Spanish%5D with these slightly corrected english srt subs: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4629624/carne-de-neon-en

at least they'll be in sync."
