,catpuke,2012-05-02T22:57Z,perhaps you'd like him to take 0.013 of a second to click your fucking mouse button for you too.
,rsl87,2012-05-02T23:38Z,And where exactly am I clicking to find all this information out you fucking jackass? If you're going to take the time to upload a movie you can take the additional moment to put the info for people like me who like to know what they're downloading for specific reasons. But thanks for your input you ignorant prick
