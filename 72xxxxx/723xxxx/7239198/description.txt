************


Using the pretense of needing a prescription refilled while his own doctor is away, Finch is able to initiate the electronic surveillance on his and Reese's next case, that of emergency room physician Dr. Megan Tillman. In following Dr. Tillman, Reese learns that she is leading a double life. While she spends tireless sixteen hour days at the hospital, her precious time away from the hospital is not spent sleeping, but rather trolling the singles bars at night.
