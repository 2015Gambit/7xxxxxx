"Southern Accents"

Jules has a hard time accepting that Holly 
is part of her life, a situation that does 
not improve after she finds out that Holly 
and Travis made out; Andy wants to run for 
mayor so he can change the town rules 
against weddings on the beach (something 
Jules has her heart set on), but Ellie 
won't let him; and Laurie tries to 
convince Bobby he's just socially inept, 
not prejudiced, after he blurts out some 
awkward comments at the cake shop.

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
