These elements, together with all the real tracks and riders, will be part of the official videogame. Straights, corners, jumps, slides: there is nothing smooth about Motocross but riders are there to shape it up. The ending is always a surprise. This is why bike enthusiasts get excited, and this is why gamers will love the videogame.
