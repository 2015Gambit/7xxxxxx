,smithy125,2012-05-01T05:17Z,Many thanks for these uploads :)
,Soulketcher,2012-05-01T05:29Z,"Pink Taco, you're more like a brown crater .. Did you even read the description? The 52 Games he mentions are a generic footnote to OTHER online playable titles..
"
,Pink_Taco,2012-05-01T07:08Z,Just saying more info would be helpful 
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-01T07:49Z,what more info is needed? all u need is to know that it is EVERY Nintendo 64 ROM/GAME and Emulator. what the hell more is needed to know? do u expect me to sit here for hours and compile a list to add in the description?
,Pink_Taco,2012-05-01T08:55Z,no i just expected a number since I have seen dozens of these so called complete packs when there is so many not there that's why i said how many are in the pack. dont matter any way it is downloading at 0.4k 
,Jayzen_Freeze,2012-05-01T09:11Z,Mehh slow speed so far how many files are actually in here?
,k4m1k4z3_pt,2012-05-01T14:15Z,Thanks in advance. Is there a rom of World Driver Championship working in this torrent?
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-01T20:11Z,"whomever the hell marked this with a -1 two times might want to stop. you havent even finished the fucking download yet.... idiots. (all eyes on pink)

@k4m1k4z3_pt yes there is

there are almost 500 games in here."
,Jayzen_Freeze,2012-05-01T22:47Z,yea. everyone can only vote once so yea piss off it is not just me here that doing it. lol
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-01T23:20Z,"no, u can vote as many times as you want, but now i see u and pink are the same guy on 2 different accounts..... "
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-01T23:28Z,it is only you and im about to report you for trolling like a bitch. ppl can vote as many times as they want and u already know that and how cuz ur doing it.
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-01T23:29Z,when i report you im pretty sure they can see how many times you've voted too.
,Jayzen_Freeze,2012-05-01T23:57Z,the problem is is people are asking simple questions and you are being a dick.  I just wanted to know why it was only downloading at 0.7k so what ever and if i wanted to be an ass i would go to all your torrents and make it negative but I am not like that. oh and I CANNOT vote more than once I tried once after you started acting like this! 
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-02T00:16Z,"you are the only one whom asked a question, u did it over 2 accounts that belong to you. also every time u comment there is a new vote so stop lying. im not an idiot and...let us just say i have my ways of KNOWING it is you. :)

oh and im not being a dick, im being truthful...guess you can't handle the truth....

cya Pink Vagina...taco"
,Jayzen_Freeze,2012-05-02T01:29Z,What ever fella how old are you acting like a child read my comments they asked the number of games and remarked/ asked about the speed.
,Jayzen_Freeze,2012-05-02T08:01Z,Also I am grateful fore the torrent other than the few extras and game identifier  etc it is always good to add something to my collection so +1
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-02T09:43Z,"ok so right there u just contradicted urself bro....u said u just +1'd this though earlier u said u -1'd it. saying you could only vote once....u just gave yourself up basically.

anyhow im not the one trolling therefore im not acting like a child.

either way, glad u liked it. peace."
,CarbonYT,2012-05-02T15:29Z,"Great collection of games, thanks. 
Only problem I had was a Trojan virus detected in the Rom renamer folder. "
,Jayzen_Freeze,2012-05-02T20:55Z,You are still being a childish dick I did not know about the vote thing till you mentioned it be for this I never even tried to vote twice ans when you said I could I gave you the +1 back because it is about the torrent not the way the seeder is acting.
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-02T22:00Z,"like i said, ur the one trolling, stop coming this way. the fact u wont go away means u r acting childish. simply go away and that will solve this problem. this is my upload therefore im not going anywhere as im looking for comments of ppl that need help...but all i find is ur bs childish blander.....

@CarbonYT it's not a trojan. look up false positive bro."
,Jayzen_Freeze,2012-05-02T23:24Z,"I guess there is no point asking simple questions since you are acting irrational to a simple question 
WARNING!! don't ask this guy simple questions about his torrents he gets real pissed off for some reason grow up kid, I'm out. "
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-03T00:33Z,id call u an idiot but that's an understatement....the understatement of the year.
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-03T00:35Z,and watch...i bet this idiot will come back too. :)
,Jayzen_Freeze,2012-05-03T01:36Z,you are still the one talking garbage AGAIN GROW UP.
,IndigoAK,2012-05-04T10:11Z,"The were only 387 games released for the Nintendo 64, so if there's over 500 ROMS in this collection, a vast portion of them have to be regional variations of the same title."
,Rraa,2012-05-05T02:17Z,"FuCtUpPuNk FTW
I've downloaded some of your torrents, no problem at all...
Thanks...
Ignore those moron trolls..."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-05T09:23Z,"@Rraa you're right, Jayzen_Freeze is just a troll with no life, whom dwells in his mothers basement, has no job, no real friends, no girlfriend, and most likely dropped out of school at a young age.....i come to this conclusion due to the way this fucktarded loser is acting and the fact he keeps coming back. obviously hasn't a life. :)"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-05T09:26Z,"myspace com/376133716/photos lol looks like a faggot. bro trust me as i tell u, you need to stop trolling. i'll troll you 10 times harder."

[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-05-09T00:10Z,lol bro already have it almost ready to upload. already had planned on upping it :) then i have a few others things up my sleeve too.
,lithussabbat,2012-05-15T09:32Z,Great job man! Everything is working perfectly. Thanks a lot. Seeding now.
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-05-23T10:52Z,"This contains 466 roms.
However, it has a ton of duplicates in different formats.
I'll recount after i arrange them better."
,smknjoker,2012-05-24T04:13Z,Love the old school shit. Fucking awesome man
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-05-24T09:43Z,"Alright - update.
This contains 466 rom files.
Many are duplicates.

Contains 
320 different roms,
12 are Japanese exclusives.

Working.
All roms seem to be legit and work to a point...
However i got these results...

(Using Project 64 1.7.0.49 - Jabo's video and audio - default settings)

150 (8 Japanese) work (Don't produce errors, or have stand-still fps)

170 (4 japanese) don't work (90% produce break point error which will crash pj64, 5% less extreme error that will halt the game, and 5% fps too low to play)

However i know many of these games will work with some changes to the settings.

Other problems - Compressed as 1 file - which saves space yes, but takes forever to extract a single file.
Also, with 145 duplicates (different extensions), there is a tonne of waste. (2.2 GB uncompressed)"
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-05-24T10:29Z,"Another Update!
Dont use project 64 1.7 versions - they just hate everything.
Pj64 1.6 seems to work perfect with all the games that didn't work on 1.7."
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-05-24T11:49Z,"Final update:
All games work with PJ64 apart from the following.

All Star Baseball 2001 (Works with 1964)
FIFA Soccer 64 (Works with 1964)
Nagano Winter Olympics '98 (Works with 1964)
NFL Quaterback Club '98 (Works with 1964)
Re-Volt (Works with 1964)
Star Wars Shadows of the empire (Works 1964)
Taz Express (Works with 1964)
Top Gear Overdrive (Works with 1964)

The rest don't work at all.

Indiana Jones and the infernal machine
Mia Hamm Soccer 64
Michael Owens WLS 2000
Star Wars Rouge Squadron
Starwars Ep.1 - Battle For Naboo
Stunt Racer 64
Top Gear Hyperbike
World Driving Championship."
,DarkSilhouette,2012-06-08T17:56Z,"Yeah i knew from past experience that N64 roms would act up and heeps wouldn't work. Thanks for the info BDM.

Thanks for the compile FuctUp, you're taking time out of your life to bring us these fine compilations so dont worry about these dip shits that keep ridding into you for no reason. +1."
,bobby2012,2012-07-01T16:09Z,"I downloaded this torrent a few days ago and scanned it with AVG (30-day trial of the paid version) about fifteen minutes ago. Five trojan horses were found.
I created this account just to make this comment. Peace."
,xblindsidex,2012-08-12T12:15Z,"thanks! awesome collection :)
just want to make a comment about your description.
""a Rom is a console game but converted to pc"" actually if it was converted to pc, we wouldnt want a program that emulates the console to play the rom. so as you can understand, since we want something that emulates the console, it means that a rom is the exact game file that the console plays. if you could connect a n64 cartridge to a usb, you would see a *.n64 single file inside, just like the rom :)
so no conversions done, they just using a method to take the rom from inside the cartridge (you can find some adaptors to ebay, like for example, connecting a super nintendo cartridge to a usb).
Anyway, thanks again :D"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-08-16T06:29Z,"uh actually it was converted to pc. how do you think it got onto pc to begin with? look at it this way, do you think all ps1 games are iso's? or .bin files? nope... do you think the files on a n64 cartridge are all .z64 files? no, like ps1 it's not just 1 file but many. now yes all the original files are copied withing the iso, z64, bin, etc. but the file type is not what it originally was. so yes it was very much converted to pc. and the emulator is used to emulate the games that were converted to the pc. i mean sure you can burn the bin, iso, or w/e to disc but it's still not the same thing. cant run them without a mod chip :)

understand yet?"
