Trainspotting.1996.Bluray.1080p.x264.AC3-CHD


Decided to upload it myself, since there were only direct downloads available. So, credits to everyone who made this. I'm only allowing people to download it.

This include no subtitles, and only one spoken language (English).
I keep my computer on 24/7, so there should be no problems for downloaders (my internet is insane) :D
And, oh.. This is my first upload, so please tell me if you like it or if I did something wrong :P

Let me try to get to the technicals (never done this before! :P)!
