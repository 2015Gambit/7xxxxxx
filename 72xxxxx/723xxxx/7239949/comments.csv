,lonewolf265,2012-05-04T05:22Z,"they are both separate people, eztv is legit.  they upload the same because they both do tv torrents.  this is 100% real."
,Toby196,2012-05-04T05:35Z,"Thanks eztv!  Quick upload, as always.

To shizanky:  Everything I've ever downloaded from ""ettv"" has been legit so far.  I just question why he/she chose a name so similar to eztv, knowing that eztv is a legend (and has a spotless reputation) on all the torrent sites.  To me it just seems like a shady attempt to ""steal"" downloaders (if that even matters)."
,Toby196,2012-05-04T05:39Z,"Thanks, eztv!

And to shizanky, so far everything I've downloaded from ""ettv"" has been legit.  I do find it shady though that he/she would choose a name so similar to eztv."

,reowner,2012-05-04T18:59Z,thanks will seed
,DngnRdr,2012-05-05T12:33Z,"Neither ettv or eztv actually create the files... they get them elsewhere and share them with us lowly peeps. Higher up the food chain are the groups who do the actual encode (in this case LOL) but they care little about what we think.

Btw love this show and so glad it's got a second season.. shame this season is almost over though."
,caribou24,2012-05-07T07:48Z,Just saw on NET another season of this comming back. Great to hear love the concept and the show
,giggedyguy,2012-06-24T09:48Z,Sound only coming through one speaker. I see this a lot with x264 formatted videos for some reason.
