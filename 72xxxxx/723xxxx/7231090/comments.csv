Game partition CRC does not match the verified ini! There are 4 possibilities:

1. This is a bad rip (the most likely cause). If you're checking a DVD backup
and have AnyDVD or a similar app installed, make absolutely sure the process is
killed! If this is a scene release, search for it on abgx.net and look at the
column ""Bad CRC or Needs Fixing"". If you see a  icon, hover over it with
your mouse to read the alt text. If it says something like ""Bad game data CRC""
or gives the name of a fix (PPF patch), we already know about it. It's also
highly recommended to run abgx360 again with AutoFix set to level 3 if you
applied a PPF to make sure stealth files haven't been corrupted. See ""What is
AnyDVD style corruption?"" in the GUI Quickstart tab for more info on game data
corruption.

2. Your CPU/RAM/HDD/data bus is unstable and corrupted the data during
extraction/burning or while checking the CRC. Make sure to run the sfv and try
extracting it again (assuming you have the sfv/rars) and recheck the ISO/DVD to
see if you get the same CRC.

3. Game data was intentionally modified for some reason. Microsoft does not
take kindly to modifications for any purpose, and even benign changes to game
data or settings will get you banned from Xbox Live!

4. The verified Game CRC in the database is wrong (very unlikely).

Stealth was verified but game data wasn't
