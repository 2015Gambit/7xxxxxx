,Hippox88,2012-09-17T22:18Z,"This is a fix for the x0ffffff error, no probs:

1: Make sure Windows update service is running, this is very important!

2: Install GfWL - or just install 'Windows Live ID Sign-in Assistant 6.5', if you already have GfWL installed.

3: Delete any 'xlive.dll' you may have downloaded and put into the game folder.

4: Reset if required, then play the game. Also, EASY. :p"
