,piraticezi,2012-05-01T19:46Z,maybe i missed something but why do you upload free sw here?
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-05-02T00:55Z,"@piraticezi :
the true question is :
Why do you think that doing torrent is reserved only for seeding illegal stuff ?
...
should i judge any seed coming from any people so ?
Even if i can understand what do you mean but doing torrent consists to share at first,but it doesn't care if you share free legal stuff or not anyway...
Don't you think so ?
