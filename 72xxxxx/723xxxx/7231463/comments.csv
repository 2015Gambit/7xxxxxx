I can hardly believe what people are complaining about... there was no sync issues at all and the movie was pretty good... the plot was obvious but the dialogues and other stuff made it pretty decent... Lastly to those complaining, go to a cinema if u want it perfect rather than shouting at those who do something for us... Besides there is no subtitle requirement in this movie, just a few russian dialogues but if all u want are the subtitles then go search for it...

There is a copy of this out that doesn't have any sync issues and the reason I know that is because people on the forum pointed it out. People shouldn't however result to insulting those that go to the effort of providing torrents, but then again, others shouldn't show themselves up to be just as bad by using the same type of behaviour. Sync issues aren't that hard to sort out and takes a matter of minutes, so hardly worth blowing a gasket over, but it is annoying.
