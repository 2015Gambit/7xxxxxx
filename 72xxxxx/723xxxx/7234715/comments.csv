[V],Nepotu,2012-05-02T13:45Z,"You gave a ""friend"" of mine, instead you were full of frustration, so you decided to fuck Nepotu. I have upd here from many years, including NBA games, you being one those who downloaded my files. When you came over to my source, by respect for you, I moved on and never I uploaded from there anymore. Now you come back on me with frustration and disrespect like a annoying fly, seen by the fact that you have been uploaded all versions that you could, only to fuck me. Well, it's time to me to move on again, frustrated and disrespectful man, and let you to be a hero. I'm happy that you'll never rich my level of professionalism, because you don't like to work a little, only copy-paste. Good luck and shame on you, ""my friend""!"

Ok mate.. for the sake of your hate, i will stop uploading NBA games on this site.. I'm not trying to be a hero, I have just found this one site the releases fast NBA torrents and i thought its good to share it here.

And I have just thought that you are creating your own torrents and not copy-paste the same as what I am doing..

Cheers mate.. I hope you feel better now.. "
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-02T16:19Z,"I don't hate you, man. And I don't want all for me. That was the reason why I told you to put the credits in the description, because isn't our merit. I thought you are a friend. But you came over me with your frustration. Why I think that? Because you have uploaded all the torrents you could find. And I mean all of it. And don't pretend like you didn't knew where did my torrents came from, when I have mentioned the credits! And we are not the same, I have put some work in theseuploads, not just copy-paste. Anyway, I will do the same as before. I'll let you do what you want to do and I'll move on. I don't need your mercy. I'm not a child. But I think that, friends or not, we need to show some respect. Don't you? And without pretending that we are telling the truth when we actually don't. Good luck and respect, mate!"
