,kompas909,2012-05-03T19:48Z,"Try roll back to 7.31, I had similar problem cus of crack. Anyway, you can try somthing. Create desktop icon from win32/Dundefenders.exe (or smthing), then open icon properties and in target box, at the ending write -TCP (it's should look like DungeonDefenders.exe"" -TCP). Write if that helps."
,xMagic17x,2012-05-03T22:09Z,yea the -TCP didnt work. how do i roll back? just put the 7.30d to 7.31 in? or do a full reinstall?
,kompas909,2012-05-03T22:48Z,"well try do 7.30d to 7.31, dunno, I don't realy remeber, what files been changed in those updates, if that dosen't help, reinstall"
