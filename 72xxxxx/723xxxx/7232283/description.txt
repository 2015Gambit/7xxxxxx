Storyline


Karan Kapoor, Tanzing and Chandu complete their college studies, 
join hands with a black-marketeer, Archie, who gets them to travel to Bangkok for money-laundering purposes. 
En route they meet with leggy Jaipur-based Bulbul Singh, and after the completion of this mission, 
the foursome decide to put their heads together to get rich quickly. Karan disappoints his father, 
Sajjan, by giving up on getting an MBA Degree, and 
the four re-locate to New York where they proceed 
to scam businesses with considerable success, 
and Karan and Bulbul fall in love with each other.
 Money pours in, resulting in abuse, alcohol and bitterness; 
differences surface between the four, especially when a pregnant 
Bulbul finds out that Karan has married a woman named Pamela Sahni.
