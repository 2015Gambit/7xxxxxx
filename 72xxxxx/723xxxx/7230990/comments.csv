A more thoughtful representation of your criticism should be rendered upon or within your much superior alternative eastern southern or northern society's information distribution systems.  WESTSIDE RULEZ!!"
,Minerva7101,2012-05-01T07:25Z,"Yes, the Western world is not perfect, but it's about a billion times better than any other society that has ever existed."
,ImSoJaded,2012-05-01T11:12Z,"So, let's accept that Western society is better than than the rest: does that make it immune to criticism? With senators and MPs on the paylist of corporate lobbies, with governments chipping away your privacy, with economy's run by plutocracies and public opinion shepherded by the media controlled by the same plutocracies, do you really think there is nothing to criticize in the Western world?"
,Minerva7101,2012-05-02T10:42Z,"You may indeed criticise those things in the West that deserves it, but what these authors are doing is bashing the West and ignoring the rest of the world, which suffers from far worse problems. You need to keep things in perspective."
,MySecrets,2012-06-13T19:18Z,So why criticize this torrent when there are much worse torrents?
,MySecrets,2012-06-20T14:53Z,"I spoke too soon. One can't get much worse than an unseeded, compressed, partial copy of another torrent.

These 14 books, along with ""Thurow & Kilman - Enough. Why the Worldâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Poorest Starve in an Age of Plenty (2009).pdf"", can be found in the root folder of http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5610584/Criticism_of_the_Western_Society__amp__Civilization_-_A_Collection"
