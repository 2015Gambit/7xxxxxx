,Tjezee,2012-05-03T20:54Z,"Yeh not only is this version totally messed up, I got the ping.exe virus after installing this. So if you haven't yet downloaded this, don't."
,Brooce,2012-05-04T10:48Z,"I found a temporary way to get the patch to work until SKIDROW upload a proper version. Uploaded the files here : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7240894

Enjoy! Make sure you read the description though, as there is one small issue."
,Brooce,2012-05-04T10:54Z,"Tjezee, I can guarantee that you didn't get that virus from this torrent. I ran the files through multiple scanners and they all came up clean."
,Brooce,2012-05-04T11:24Z,"The last torrent had the old files. Sorry!

Fixed : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7241035"
