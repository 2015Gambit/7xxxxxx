That isn't the problem. These magnet links work sometimes, sometimes they don't. I seem to have no control over it."

But thanks for the torrents, keep em coming and I'll download and seed when I can."
,malagent,2012-05-02T16:43Z,"I found a work-around for the magnet links not working. Apparently logging out of and back into window allows them to work. But after a few downloads they stop doing so.

Oh well."
