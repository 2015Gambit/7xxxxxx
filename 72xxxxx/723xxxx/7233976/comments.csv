1. Mount the .iso file to daemon and whatever you use to mount them.
2. Install/setup the game
3. The crack is IN the .iso image. Go to 'my computer' right-click on the image with 'open'
You'll find a folder that either says ""CRACK"" or ""SKIDROW"" The crack for the game is in there."
,FrediSan,2012-05-02T13:45Z,"For people asking, yes, DLC is included. I have not seen it ""in game"", but DLC folder and available content can be located in game's folder.

@Erecose and ayone with audio problems, you must hit ctrl+alt+delete then cancel and then it should be fine. if not then try running it in a older version as i have listed above for video problems. and if that does not work then try this.

1.In Windows 7, go to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Sound

2.You will see your default sound device. Click it, then click properties.

3.Go to the Advanced Tab, make sure the default format is set to 44.1Khz 16-bit.

4.Hit Apply/OK, then run it.

Finally I have managed to run the game. Damn baby you are gonna love it. I am providing with the instructions again and see if this works for you.
1/ Make sure you have the latest direct x
2/ Nvidia or Geforce - Make sure you have the latest drivers
3/ Go to Control Panel Hardware & Sound - Nvidia Control Panel - Manage 3d Settings - High Performance Nvidia Processor
4/ Do what @kidlonewolf suggested -
A. right click on shortcut then truoble shoot compatibiltiy mode.
B.click on that it worked on older modles.
C. click on windows98/windows ME
D.hit start program.
E.play the game
5/ And finally, when you run the game immediately press Alt + Enter for the screen to become a little small. Worked for me but not necessary.
6/ The game saves and sound quality is also fine.
Good Luck. "

But its still not very simulator, so its pretty much a bad action game with some pseudorealism pasted on.

Are all the maps going to be just houses and streets? And the protagonist alone? Im guessing no large battlefields, no supporting regular GI's and none of that stuff. sigh... Guess Ill keep playing anyway because I dont have anything better to do...

Try changing the mouse smoothing @ acceleration settings.  I had mouse smoothing on at first and it was shit, turned it off and it was alot less clunky.


Also anyone have any updates on the whole ""save only works as long as you don't exit the save""?  I would rather not have to sit down and try to beat the game in one go."
,buttfacejr,2012-05-08T01:47Z,"OK, Listen up, here is a fix for the SAVE GAME issue where if you exit the game, your save is gone.
STEP 1 : Have this problem
STEP 2 : Go to where you installed the game, normally this is in Program Files/SniperEliteV2/bin
STEP 3 : Open the Skidrow.ini file in Notepad or something similar, not fucking Wordpad.
STEP 4 : This is the fun part, find where your game is saved. 

Example, mine is in C:UsersAccount NameAppDataLocalSniperV2PC_ProfileSaves>big ass number<

STEP 5 : See that big ass number?  Your going to need that.  So copy it or write is down, whatever.
STEP 6 : Find this line of text in the Skidrow.ini file. 
# Environment Application Id.
AppId =

STEP 7 : That big ass number you copied?  Put it after the ""="" 

So it should look like this

# Environment Application Id.
AppId = >big ass number<

Now, save the file.

ENJOY THE GAME."

1. Mount the .iso file to daemon and whatever you use to mount them.
 2. Install/setup the game
 3. The crack is IN the .iso image. Go to 'my computer' right-click on the image with 'open'
 You'll find a folder that either says ""CRACK"" or ""SKIDROW"" The crack for the game is in there
Copy all the files and placed in
C:Program FilesRebellionSniperEliteV2bin
and its Will work fine"

The first time downloading I had corruption errors, but clean download again and all good on Windows 7 64b. If you're not sure, go into the ""REDIST"" to find directX and VC++ 2008 setup files just to make sure. If your versions are higher/not needed, it will auto bypass and complete installation.

,OguzDastan,2012-05-30T01:34Z,"Guys. I solved the problem. When you install the game, the game folder is automaticly placed in My Computer C: harddrive. You should have a folder named ''Sniper.Elite.V2-SKIDROW''. That is not the game folder you put your crack in. Because when you install it, you probably forgot to put it on your desktop.

First thing to do

1. Install the game again. (dont worry about deleting it or something, just run the setup, AND REMEMBER TOO RUN IT AS ADMIN)
2. When your done installing, you copy the files in SKIDROW(not the BIN folder, you copy the FILES not folder) and then you put it in the game installation folder. And this installation folder should be in your desktop. If not, its in My Computer - Harddrive C: - Program Files (x86) - Rebellion - SniperEliteV2, and then you put the copied files in. 


Once its there, you simply press at the SniperEliteV2 file and the game should work.

This is pretty commonplace in torrents, but crucially, the three files in the skidrow folder all work as one; you cant just copy two of them, it must be the whole BIN folder.

Click the View tab.

Under Advanced settings, click Show hidden files and folders, and then click OK.

2) Go to C/Users/YourCUrentUser/AppData/Local/SniperV2
3) There you should be able to see a config. file named Settings.Open it :)

4) First of all, change the game resolution as your required Display Hardware (Monitor or LCD etc…)

Launch game as you normally would and press alt+enter.

Just 1 issue; when I close/open the game, my only option when I click Singleplayer is to make a New Game; the ""Continue"" is grayed out...so if I get to the 2nd mission, exit the game, open it again, my only option is to make a New Game; there's no option to continue the 2nd mission..."

Mount it with a program like daemon tools or poweriso

Or if you feel like it you could burn the ISO file to a disc and it will play as if it were a real disc.

Or if you don't feel like any of that, extract the file with winrar and just press install from wherever you extracted it to."

If the game crashes anywhere in the game or after Rebellion its because you have to many programs running. Do the following it worked for me. 

1)Start 
2)Search: System Configuration
3)Click: Startup
4)Click: Disable All
5)Then Just Enable your Virus Protection
6)Restart your computer
