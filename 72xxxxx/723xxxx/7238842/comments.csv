,twkopie1218,2012-06-02T16:59Z,why is it 6.9 GiB??????
,natvv,2012-07-08T04:10Z,"@twkopie1218
Because there are a LOT of issues.  6.9GB is a good size for the number of comics in this torrent."
,j0nnyboy,2012-07-25T10:39Z,"I appreciate the torrent. But by numbering them in this way you make things very confusing.

For example-
    Instead of Volume 4 # 1 you title it #504. 

NOBODY else does this. Not Marvel and not other uploaders. Otherwise, would be an awesome torrent."
