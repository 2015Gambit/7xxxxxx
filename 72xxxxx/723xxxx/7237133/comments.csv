[V],psspss,2012-05-03T12:45Z,"very odd their site they didnt even list this episode,, not as episode 1 when I looked

most assumed tvrage was wrong and included a special promo in the listing

so maybe since Ep1 is a premier dont that make this episode E00 ? a pilot?"
[V],psspss,2012-05-03T12:46Z,so this is surely episode 0 if E01 is a premier
[V],psspss,2012-05-03T13:29Z,"well after some research this is actually 107
according to their website not episode 1 at all
but ep7
have a look..

its even pomo-ed at the end of episode 6
the bowels of NY

so tvrage is still wrong"
,Majty,2012-05-03T13:41Z,"I archive them and I would love to have complete offical WRCR set! :)
I got 1 and 5-7 so far."
[T],xgimpyx,2012-05-03T18:19Z,"psspss,
I don't understand why you are trying so hard to justify your position on the episode numbers. No matter what you want to believe this is episode 1. It was listed as episode 1 the night it first aired and was still listed as s01e01 on Comcast last night. Tvrage is correct and so is the listing I posted above. If you want to continue changing the episode numbers feel free to do so. However, please source the episodes that you are changing elsewhere and stop changing mine. Thank you"
[V],psspss,2012-05-10T09:59Z,"well considering you listed E08 tonight seems
that i was right

if you read what i said and followed the link
to the tv site that airs them you would of learned
instead of being ignorant"
[T],xgimpyx,2012-05-12T06:08Z,"psspss, The episode you are referring to is labeled ep 8 BECAUSE IT IS EP 8. There have been 7 previous episodes so what do you think it should labeled. Did you put any thought into that comment?"
[T],xgimpyx,2012-05-12T07:00Z,"This will be the last I will address the issue of numbering. As I stated in my other comments I watched this episode the night it originally aired on Spike which was before the night they were calling their premiere night. If Spike made a mistake by airing it then or for whatever reason they choose not to acknowledge the original airing I have no idea but ""Blood, Sweat and Money"" still aired as episode 1. Even Xfinity still has it in their database as episode 1 the same as it was listed the original night it aired. Here is a link to see that for yourself. 

I'm pretty sure I can't enter the link so go to tinypic and enter this after the web address /r/11l2zit/6

So do whatever you want with naming and consider this subject closed."
