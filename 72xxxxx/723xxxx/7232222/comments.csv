,madmocha,2012-05-23T21:31Z,"    Tyr3ll, Been struggling with finding something to play my vid files that doesn't stutter, jerk, freeze or...  What I used before (vlc) worked great until I tried to add codecs that would help with mp4.  Now nothing works.  I spent hours uninstalling and reinstalling all combinations of codecs and media players.  Nothing wants to work any more.  Even the combination I had in the past.  I'm commenting this here because I've seen you try to help others in your uploads.  Any ideas why I can't get good video playback any more?  I don't know alot about codecs, I just tried to follow directions in their installation, but some of the choices they give you in setup I don't really understand.  I tried leaving it on the 'default' options, but still no success.  Would appreciate any thoughts you may have."
