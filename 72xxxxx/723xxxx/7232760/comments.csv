,mlyles,2012-06-15T18:53Z,What if i dont have anything that says Mods? or packages?
,chizzyoi,2012-06-16T02:44Z,"A more extensive explaination of how to download would be lovely for us newbs, we have to learn somehow

I have no ""Mod"" or ""Packages"" section either. And im not sure what you mean by ""create and copy resource.cfg from the torrent"". Good fight me..."

Thanks for downloading this torrent!
Here is the instructions HOW TO INSTALL .PACKAGE FILES!!!
Do the following:
1) Go to ""Documents"" folder,
2) Then, ""Electronic Arts"" folder,
3) Then, ""The Sims 3"" folder,
4) Then, ""Mods"" folder (if you don't have it, CREATE it and COPY Resource.cfg from the torrent there)
5) Then, ""Packages"" folder (if you don't have it, CREATE it and COPY inside all your .package files)
6) After that, reboot the game and here you go.  		"

Any advice on how to solve this issue ?"
