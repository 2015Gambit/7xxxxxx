    
Loved this movie since I was young, still do.  Recently found out a DVD was finally released in 2010 in Italy?

Bad news:  It's one of the shittiest DVD transfers I've ever seen.

Good news:  It's better than any VHS tape or VHS rip out there, looks about like a TeleSync, and somewhat widescreen.

Language:  English (as originally filmed), no dubs or subs

It should play in 16:9, that's what looked right to me (the DVD source was screwy, it plays worse than the rip, not just the aspect ratio but with skipping, artifacts, and interlacing).
   
Surely I'm not the only one who thinks this movie is hilarious and awesome, let's seed it forever!
