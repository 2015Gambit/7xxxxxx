INSTALL NOTES:

1. Unpack the archive in your location of choice.
2. Copy the file com.zend.php.core_9.0.2.201202240955.jar into the plugins dir and
overwrite the existing file with my cracked one.
4. Run the program and register with one of the keys from Keys.txt

Note: Use this same file using ZendStudio 32-bits or 64-bits edition
I only tried on Linux versions. It will probably work on Windows and Mac version.
These keys don't work without the hacked file. 
No virus or rootkit. I just like to use this eclipse distro to code so i hacked it.
