Krakatoa - The Last Days

History, Science Documentary hosted by Sam Miller, published by BBC in 2006 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

The volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 was one of the most deadly in history. It set off a series of terryifying tsunamis, destroying entire towns and islands and devastating the coastlines of Sumatra and Java. 
Now, in an ancient cycle of death and rebirth, the offspring of this legendary volcano is growing at the spot where its parent was destroyed. For decades, all that marked the site of the original 2,640-foot-high island was a tiny islet that survived the explosion. But in 1930 a new volcano broke through the water at the centre of the old, where, over 70 years on, a build up of pulsating magma is now pushing upward at an astounding pace. 
The latest scientific and historical research combines in this powerful docu-drama to reveal what really happened in the build up to, during, and in the aftermath of the disaster, and suggests what could happen if the child of Krakatoa lived up to its mother's explosive reputation.
