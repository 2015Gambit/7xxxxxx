I'm sharing these to contribute to this collection of Xbox DLC: http://digiex.net/downloads/download-center-2-0/consoles-homebrew/675-xbox-offline-xbox-live-downloadable-content-dlc-installers-downloads.html

The discs are untouched because although I'm pretty sure I know how to remove everything that isn't DLC from the discs, I would rather be safe than sorry.

If Harcroft can use these to make the DLC into an installer, there may be no point in seeding these further, unless you really want it for a collection (there may be some interesting videos or demos that have differences from the full retail versions).

My upload speed isn't great, so please be patient. If there are no seeders, don't immediately remove the torrent because I will come back online to seed. I have 29 discs total, and I'll be adding them each as seperate torrents.Thanks.

Scans are included that detail what is included on the discs (there may be Easter eggs too - some, if not all are listed here: http://www.oxmonline.com/oxm-demo-disc-archive )
