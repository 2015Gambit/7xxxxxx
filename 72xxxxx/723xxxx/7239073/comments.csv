,jammingme,2012-05-05T08:39Z,I am glad to help people. But if you do not like my torrents do me a favor and do not comment. The book and solutions manual cost me almost three hundred dollars and to me THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY TO GIVE AWAY TO UNGRATEFUL PEOPLE.... PLEASE DO NOT LOOK AT MY STUFF AS I SPENT THE LAST YEAR DOING THIS BOOK IN COLLEGE.I WAS BEING HELPFUL YOU UNGRATEFUL WASTE OF SPACE.....
