The Supremes was an American female singing group and the premier act of Motown Records during the 1960s.
Originally founded as The Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, The Supremes repertoire included doo-wop
pop, soul, Broadway show tunes, psychedelic soul, and disco. They were the most commercially successful of
Motowns acts and are, to date, America's most successful vocal group with 12 number one singles on the
Billboard Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motowns main songwriting and production
team, HollandΓÇôDozierΓÇôHolland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, The Supremes rivaled The Beatles in worldwide
popularity, and their success made it possible for future African American R&B and soul musicians to find
mainstream success..
