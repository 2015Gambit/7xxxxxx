,agodel,2012-05-01T17:04Z,"Dude, it's really awesome you are uploading this many nba games can you please please please NOT cut out the half time and preferably the pre and post game shows? Why do you do that? The TNT half time show for example is like half the entertainment value."
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-01T18:43Z,"Dear friend, agodel, I know that but, like I wrote, I'm not the ripper, only the uploader. I can't do anything to change that. Sorry, mate!"
,agodel,2012-05-02T05:27Z,"Ah, that sucks. Oh well, keep em coming anyway :). But if you have any way to influence the ripper this would be highly desired."
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-03T01:28Z,"No, I don't, man. Sorry!"
