,crappo,2012-05-18T03:04Z,SyFy never was very smart about renewing good shows.
,arildus,2012-06-27T13:57Z,Thanx:)
,mroosterg,2012-07-24T04:26Z,That's because SyFy has to make lots of room for fake wrestling and Mega-Two-Headed Shark vs. Piranha-Bear-Octopus starring former 80's pop stars or Carmen Electra. There is no room for hit series like Stargate.
