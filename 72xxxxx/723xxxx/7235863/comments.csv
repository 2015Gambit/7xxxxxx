,teenspiders,2012-05-03T16:12Z,"Dj_Ziio, I like this quote: ""In a few seconds, such gag undermines any dramatic tension, that was being built up for minutes; it messes up the pacing of any action scene inserted into; resets suspension of disbelief back to zero; and reminds the viewer, that caring about any characters OR plot points is pointless, because SPIDERMAN ON JETPACK LOOOL"".

Personally, I think they are fine, and I heard they are getting better with each episode."
