It had said, a while back:::: 
And I quote:::: 
""â&#x2013; The anime will end its run in TV Tokyo's 6:00 p.m. Tuesday timeslot on March 27. Following March 27, the following episodes will begin to air on TV Osaka's 6:30 p.m. Tuesday timeslot."" 
End of quote.


In short:: Bleach is MOVING FROM One Channel to the Other !!!!!!"
,Ichigo0Soul,2012-06-16T05:27Z,"Yes, and now the site you referenced says this in its news feed: 

Episode 366 was the last anime episode, but the manga is still ongoing and has entered its final story arc. The English dub continues as normal."
,Mandabar,2012-08-20T07:02Z,"SGKK has released all episodes up to 366 now as well as ""The Hell Chapter"""
