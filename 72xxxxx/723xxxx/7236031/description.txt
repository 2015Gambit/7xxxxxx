Useless to say anything about the movie which inspired The Great Escape and the famous La Marseille scene in Casablanca. One among Orson Welles' "ark movies," it's Renoir at his best. Erich von Stroheim's performance alone is the reason enough for me to watch La Grande Illusion again and again.

Intense drama, comedy, thrill, romance all rolled into one perfect blend, La Grande Illusion was Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels' "Cinematic Public Enemy No. 1." What more does one want?

I have limited bandwidth. So please be patient. I'll make sure that first 3-4 peers get to 100%. I'd highly appreciate if they keep the ball rolling and keep the torrent alive.
