Las Vegas punk quartet, Battle Born's debut album.  Released in the summer of '09 and Produced by Paul Miner (of Death by Stereo), "Stick To Your Guns" is a scathing tribute to aggressive music and life in Las Vegas. The album is characterized by fast and melodic rhythms, complimented by Chad's masterful shredding and fierce growl.
