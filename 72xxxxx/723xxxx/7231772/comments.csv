,KevinCostner,2012-05-01T23:28Z,When I burn it disc the audio is slighty off.  When their mouths move and the voice is delayed a bit.  Great video quality.

I tried watching this with the latest XVID codec on VLC player but it did not help."

,DanZg,2012-06-21T21:18Z,"I find African American dull term , i don't get what is wrong with term ""black"" i am white and i wouldn't get offended if bunch of black fellas call me or white. it's nothing wrong with that, the visual stuff is  first information we get when meeting someone and we notice differences, not the equall stuff, we have to embrace differences because without it it would be one misserable, dull, and gloomy world, enjoy =)"
,vmjyogi,2012-07-20T21:11Z,"@ DanZg I am black and I hate the term African-American. First of all, I've never been to Africa so I'm not really African. That's like calling white people European-American. I say either we're white and black, or European-American and African-American. And since I was born in the US, what the hell is the point of being a hyphenated American anyways."
