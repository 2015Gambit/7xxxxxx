NOTES:

Ok here we go we our version which is not a re-encode of the dvdrip but ripped straight from the DVDR
The dvdr was ok but was a bit lifeless and also had a faint line 2pixels under the top black border.
Audio is new and different too all other releases and is 10x better aswell.

Video ....made a script too crop the dvd inc the 2 etxra pixels too remove that faint line,
resized, changed contrast,brightness,chroma and rgb levels.
Also used a heavy noise filter and finally added some sharpness back into it.

Audio ....wow, top line audio and even better after some lovin in AA.
Sync was pretty easy .... 1 cut hey presto.
