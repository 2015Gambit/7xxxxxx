The final episode of the second series of Scott & Bailey aired 29th April 2012.

Review / Spoiler alert :


"Helen Mirren may be cringing a little at revisiting her 1975 performance on the Parkinson Show (though not as much as Parky) but there's no denying sex equality has moved on since the 70s. From Charlie's Angels to Scott & Bailey (ITV1) is a huge advance for women. And for viewers, as Janet, Rachel and Gill are by far the most compelling cops on TV. The second series ended with Janet being dumped by Adrian and Rachel going on a bender and finding herself under suspicion for murdering Nick. It turned out to be her idiot brother wot dun it and the mixture of shock and horror in the final scene as she finally met her mother (Who is she? Was the brother there too?) left us with a pleasing cliffhanger for the next series."
