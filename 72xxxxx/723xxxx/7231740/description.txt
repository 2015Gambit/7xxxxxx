Episode 403- the two-parter in which the guys RETURN TO THE NIGHTOSPHERE and meet DADDY'S LITTLE MONSTER. 

altogether a pretty great episode, i think, and in 720p. MATHEMATICAL.

MarcelineΓÇÖs dad banishes Finn and Jake to the Nightosphere, and it stinks. Literally. Now, they must find a way to escape.
