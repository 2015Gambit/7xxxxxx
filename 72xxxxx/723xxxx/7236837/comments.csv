[V],psspss,2012-05-04T16:11Z,"no worries .. I know some dont like to convert other formats so might as well share my work.. I really only upload paranormal stuff and rip stuff from streams for missing episodes and collections
so I might cut back a bit as 140bf sharing a month is getting to much

you can read the crap I get about converting TNEs stuff here
