,5zigia5,2012-05-01T05:01Z,Thanks very much for avi!
[V],psspss,2012-05-01T05:10Z,"its 800bitrate and since no fast movements scenes in house
like water or race cars you wont notice much of a difference
from 1000bit or 1500bit rates no pixels like from what I saw

not sure why some mp4s wont convert how you want
but I think the soft drops some frames not needed
or perhaps its a bug in the soft lol.."
