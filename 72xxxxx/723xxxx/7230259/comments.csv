,johne86,2012-05-01T01:39Z,Did cartoon network start broadcasting this series in 2.35 or did 2HD fuck up the crop?.
,Porksauce,2012-05-01T03:10Z,"The aspect ratio seems fixable by switching your media player to 16:9, but then the trailer at the end is displayed differently, so maybe it was a problem with the actual broadcast."

i'm guessing it's the usual ""cartoons compress well"" bullshit

I think the scene is screwed in the head
Why on earth do they pump out max quality audio and then butcher the video quality ?

This video for example looks extremely artifact'y like saving a jpeg at like 50% quality vs full quality. And if you can't tell the difference i bet your not using a 1080p desktop resolution

As far as I;m concerned the scene is dead.. they pump out sub par garbage wether its TV rips or DVD rips..

And YEAH I am thinking I can do better and i just might"
,zr92,2012-05-08T14:39Z,"xpmule, who the hell cares? If you want to see it in uber-HD wait for the DVD rips, otherwise quit your whinging. Yes I can see the difference on my screen, no I don't give  a shit and I'm just glad I have something to watch. If you don't have something nice to say, STFU."
,bibowns,2012-05-12T11:32Z,"zr92: fuck off. We have a right to complain if the quality isn't up to par. going ""ur all entitled"" or waiting isn't an excuse for having to deal with bad quality releases. Fuck off."
,xpmule,2012-05-21T09:39Z,"The point is if you don't complain nothing will change. Speak up and be heard or sit quietly take what ever is thrown at your feet.

Don't complain lol
I'd like to complain about the people saying I'm not allowed to complain.
What a second, zr92 arn't you ! complaining about me complaining ?

Doesn't having a video @ 720p with obviously bad video quality defeat the very purpose originaly intended ? And don't everyone that comes along deserve to be informed about a video's quality before they choose to download ?

You guys know as well that if someone complains about any 480p tv releases quality people will get angry aggressive and mouthy and say ""download the 720p"" version. Can't count how many times I've seen that.."
