,gps1976,2012-05-02T16:52Z,"Thanks for the upload, but x264 doesn't play on on external digital media players - please go back to .avi."
,wenex,2012-05-02T19:39Z,"x264 absolutely does play on external digital media players, it just doesn't play on *your* external digital media player. If it's not working for you why not just convert them to avi's yourself?"

Works great."
,PBR-Streetgang,2012-05-03T01:21Z,"@wenex it doesn't play on mine either.
VTV please go back to MP4, there a no other uploaders doing this show and AVI is good for everybody, not just those that choose to watch it on their computer."
,Greyhaime,2012-05-03T04:19Z,Pretty please go back to .avi

Thank you for uploading these, no matter how many hours ater."
