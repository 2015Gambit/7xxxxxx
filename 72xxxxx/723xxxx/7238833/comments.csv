,ninth1der,2012-05-18T21:11Z,"Okay I'm confused, why would you rip and encode a BR and not include the 5.1 audio?  I have a medium quality display (Panasonic  50"" 720 plasma) but I have a $4500 audio system (Harman Kardon head, JBL surrounds and Klipsh mains)

Good sound + great picture = good viewing experience
Great sound + good picture = great viewing experience

I'm going to start following public.org since they rip the audio."
