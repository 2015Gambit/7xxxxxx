,highlandsguy,2012-05-04T20:05Z,will you upload the 5.1 violator mix?
,Mr_Stewart,2012-05-04T21:12Z,"@highlandsguy

I will have it up within the next few days."
[T],rjordan21,2012-05-04T23:35Z,Thanks.  This smokes the original release and is slightly more laid back than the 2006 CD remaster.  Would've been nice to include artwork though.

I'm glad you like the sound of this release.

The SACD I own is a copy of the original, therefore I do not have any available artwork to share."
,lepoussi,2012-05-05T22:25Z,"The Dynamic Range of the remastered version is 9. The original is 12â&#x20AC;Ś

If you take a look to the spectrum in Adobe Audition you see that the 88.2kHz is totally useless !

The noise is higher to the original version.

So it MAY sound better the first time but if you egalise the volume, it's not as good as the original CD version !!!

Thanks for the upload anyway. ;)"
,Mr_Stewart,2012-05-06T08:42Z,"@ lepoussi Thank you for the feed back.

I'm aware of the lack of dynamic range, although I would say these are slighty more dynamic than the 2006 audio CD release. These aren't brickwalled to quite the same extent.

I hope they release a remaster in the future without any dynamic range compression.

Perhaps MFSL may work on one in the future?

Here's hoping."

In the high parts clearly hear the crackling ...why ?
Dynamics of a very weak compared to the original: ("
,Mr_Stewart,2012-05-08T23:37Z,"@velchinaski

I haven't noticed any crackling in these recordings.

Have you checked your soundcard settings to ensure that there is no volume levelling or other enhancements turned on?"
,martinzzitto,2012-07-28T17:33Z,Gracias!!!!
,freddellmeister,2012-08-04T10:27Z,"Dear Mr Stewart, how about the other Depeche Albums? I have the reisssue SACD versions but no means to rip them to my streaming solution in hires. Did you use ""saracon"" to remove DSD noise in the conversion process?"
