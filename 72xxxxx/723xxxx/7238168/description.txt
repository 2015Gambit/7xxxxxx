This is an SACD-DSD rip of "Violator" by "Depeche Mode". Tracks have been ripped professionally.

This is the 2006 remaster and is in "Stereo".

I May upload the 5.1 surround album, if there are enough requests for that.


Enjoy! And please seed.

Please also comment on the audio quality, so that I can get feedback. Thank you.
