Intolerance (1916) FULL DVD (ISO)

*** 
I use a Transfer Cap and upload 7 gigs a day. 
This is why I upload a new torrent every other day or so. 
I do this to keep my IP off my back as they have initiated a monthly limit.
It usually takes me two days to fully seed a torrent so please be patient.

SYNOPSIS:  
Many film historians hail director D.W. Griffiths monumental epic as one of the greatest movies ever committed to celluloid. Griffith powerfully interlaces four parallel tales linked by a recurring shot of Lillian Gish symbolically rocking the cradle of civilization. The stories, which span two millennia, collectively illustrate how intolerance has played a pernicious role in such historic events as Christs crucifixion and the fall of Babylon.

I upload my torrents to The Pirate Bay and Demonoid, if you would like to upload one of my torrent files to another tracker feel free. 
All I ask is that you upload the same torrent file you downloaded by clicking on one of my links so that more seeders/peers are in the swarm.
