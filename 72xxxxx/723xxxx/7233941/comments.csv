,garfiel,2012-05-03T03:09Z,"Well mikeike65 thanks for your comment, so I assume you upload lot's of stuff in the old standard format???  Oh hang on you have never bothered to upload any torrents."
,ladyemerald,2012-05-04T00:02Z,"always be greatful! without the hard work all the angels out there uploading and sharing, there wouldn´t be anything to download! Appreciate! Never complain, download or not that´s up to you Mikeike. Thanks Garfiel, you make the world a better and more enjoyble place!"
,mikeike65,2012-05-06T15:10Z,"@ladyemerald Always be grateful? Grateful for shit? Thats makes a lot of sense. Better idea, always call a spade a spade and not hide behind some sort of PCness. "
,garfiel,2012-05-08T13:46Z,"IGNORE, IGNORE trolls like these 2 below that go around bagging other peoples uploads.  They probably have such a sad life they have nothing else to do.  They certainly don’t upload any torrents.

Download an episode if you’re a fan of the stooges and decide for yourself if it’s worth downloading.  Both of the people below seem to want people to go to another site where you either pay one way or another for videos you can get right here on pirate bay free and possibly only available here.

Yeah right I really believe you 2 down loaded and actually looked at an episode

No, they dont ""play quite nicely"". They're all wonky. Every scene looks stretched out and very wide. 

no, no, no, no
Don't waste your time downloading this shit. They look awful. Spend the buck and get it from redbox.

Hey, what sort of crap is this? Call it a film internet site; you must be joking, I've noticed much better ones created by kids. Forget it and Google watchfreemoviesonline.4mvtv.com for some actually good stuff.
