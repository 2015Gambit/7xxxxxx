I'm upping these 3 episodes so that all of the first 7 episodes will be available
on my page with the correct numbering. Episodes 1-5-6-7 are all on my page with the correct numbering already and are still being seeded. If you have any "wrcr" caps from somewhere else they may be improperly numbered. The list below is correct.
