They call it outdated 80s record, a puffy new wave, They call it standard and smooth but unimaginatively lacklustre. This is far from the fact. Upbeat glamorous tunes and lyrics full of broken hearts. A masterpiece of new romantism! This is a new and better rip than the one I had posted in 4 rare 80s series, albeit still with pops and cracks, . By the way in the above picture, please meet the turntable that has been providing you with the majority of what I have been posting in the past two years!
