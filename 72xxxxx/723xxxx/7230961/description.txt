Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, April 30 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with attorney Bruce Fein, who specializes in constitutional and international law. Mr. Fein is an ardent critic of Bush, Clinton and Obama and has singled out the government's so-called terrorist surveillance program. Fein proposed impeaching Obama in connection with the 2011 military intervention in Libya. He founded the American Freedom Agenda with Bob Barr, David Keene and Richard Viguerie. Bruce Fein is the author of American Empire: Before the Fall. Alex also covers the news, including Obama's grandstanding over the unsubstantiated death of Osama bin Laden and the outrageous government plan to evacuate Chicago during the globalist and NATO summit.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
