Future Weapons Season 3
Mack goes the extra mile to track down the new weapons and defense systems taking their place in the world's arsenal to deal with the changing missions of 21st-century warfare. There's still plenty of firepower, but you'll get an inside look at many of the breakthrough technologies designed to take on the challenges of terrorism, bomb threats, and close combat urban battlefields.

Future Weapons tests the amazing revolutionary armour for combat rubber raiding craft; the new longer range ammo for the awesome Milkor multiple grenade launcher that can reach out a half a mile; the latest generation of the A10 Thunderbolt ground attack plane with new "Precision Engagement" upgrades and the assault rifle round that stays supersonic out to 1200 yards.
