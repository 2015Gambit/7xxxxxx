@mywifelovescorn .... I had the same problem, and downloaded 'Freemake Video Converter', I'm a bit of a beginner with all this so struggled a little at first, but followed a Tutorial on Youtube posted by Baggywandas, I found it through the'help' button on FVC, it's very clear and easy to follow, and now I can watch anything by converting to AVI. Good Luck :)"

,mywifelovescorn,2012-05-03T02:38Z,@neeliesu thanks a million for the Freemake suggestion - it worked like a charm and I no longer need to grit my teeth when I see MPEG4. Wonderful!!
