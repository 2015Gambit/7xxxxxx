 Windows Enabler
 _______________


 Windows Enabler allows the user to enable disabled windows and controls such as buttons and tick boxes

 and choose menu options that would normally be disabled. This is obviously a very dangerous practice

 if used recklessly but having said that, youâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;d be surprised at how often it comes in handy. 

 Windows Enabler has a very simple user interface; it appears as an icon in the system tray and can be

 turned on and off simply by clicking on it.

 Window`s In A Box
 _________________

 Access all the features of windows xp on your desktop

 Written by Elena Opris on February 29th, 2012 


 Windows In A Box is an application that allows you to quickly access important functions found in Windows.

 This software does not require installation, so it is portable. It means that you can place Windows In A Box

 on a removable device and run it on any computer. Also, your registry entries will remain intact.

 The user interface of the program is plain and simple. You can access options found in the ""Functions"",

 ""Hidden XP Functions"", ""Other"" and ""Folder"" menus.

 So, you can initiate Paint, Log Off, Restart, Shutdown, Scan Disk, Notepad, Modem Settings, Sound Recorder,

 Command Prompt, Computer Management and Add/Remove Programs.

 But you can also access Event Viewer, Task Manager, Device Manager, System Monitor, Performance Monitoring,

 Text to Speech Narrator, Removable Storage Management, Windows Local Security Settings and Signature

 Verification Tool.

 Furthermore, you can go to Check Disk Utility, Windows XP Tour, Windows Automatic Updates, System

 Configuration Utility, Scanner and Camera Wizard, Driver Verifier Utility, On Screen Keyboard, Windows

 Utility Manager, System Restore, Memory Stats and Microsoft Magnifier.

 In addition, you can open Task Scheduler, Appearance, Folder Options, Windows Movie Maker, Windows

 Temp Folder, Downloaded Installations, Program Files, Screensaver, Display Settings, and many more.

 The program takes up a very low amount of system resources. No errors have popped up during our tests and

 Windows In A Box did not freeze or crash.

 We would have liked the possibility of adding and deleting functions from the menus, so the program would

 be customizable. Also, it would had been an added bonus if Windows In A Box could have minimized to tray. 

 All in all, the program is designed for users who want quick access to the most important functions

 (and even hidden ones) found on your operating system. We strongly recommend it.

 CROA

 Overview

 CROA is a handy utility that will clear the read-only bit of all subfolders and files in a specific folder.

 This is extremely useful after copying the contents of a CD to your hard drive.

 Note: Modern versions of Windows have this functionality built-in, and CROA is not needed.

 However, it provides an easier to use interface that some people prefer, and therefore will remain available.
