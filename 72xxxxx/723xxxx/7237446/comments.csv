well at least they used a thermal in this one.. perhaps mr josh
gates gave them some pointers

they caught something but man why didnt he keep the
darn thing stable

very hard to see the darn shadow they saw on deck
might of help if they had a full spectrum and thermal in their
hand for that one.. but didnt.. sigh"

[V],psspss,2012-05-04T16:08Z,"no worries .. I know some dont like to convert other formats so might as well share my work.. I really only upload paranormal stuff and rip stuff from streams for missing episodes and collections
so I might cut back a bit as 140bf sharing a month is getting to much

you can read the crap I get about converting TNEs stuff here
