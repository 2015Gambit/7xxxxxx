,nomad1980,2012-05-03T21:01Z,"I got tired of looking for 5, 6, and 7 and bought them through Comixology.  If anyone know how to convert them, I will happily share them.  "
,tantonj,2012-05-03T22:41Z,"the best way to copy from comixology would be page by page, and you would want to access your comixology account on a pc not android, then printscreen and paste and make the jpgs needed"
