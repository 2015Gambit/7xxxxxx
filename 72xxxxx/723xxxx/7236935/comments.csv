,CAesuoMykcM,2012-05-14T06:58Z,"The first time I watched this movie I had to rent it, but now I won't have to do that anymore. Thanks. Will seed for sure."
,solanus,2012-06-03T06:58Z,"WARNING: This is the EXTENDED EDITION. Not the ""Director's Cut"", as the director has said that he prefers the original version. They added some scenes, including some *after* the ending of the original, which, IMO, diminishes the emotional impact of the ending. No doubt, this is still an excellent movie, but I recommend watching the original version first if you haven't seen it yet.
