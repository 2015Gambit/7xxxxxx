The first release in the Celestial Bodies series, a 12-month galactic collaboration between Ruined Machines and artist Michal Brodka spanning the entire Solar System and beyond. 

Over the next 365 days, twelve otherworldly artistic journeys will take shape through strict monthly production deadlines, with each collaborative result being shared with the world via the Ruined Machines Bandcamp page on the first of every month. 

"Largely an experiment, the idea behind Celestial Bodies is to see what we can come up with as a unit in a small amount of time. There is no pristine mixing, perfect technique, or completely pre-planned production. A stream of consciousness. We are creating maniacally; we enjoy the final product as if we're hearing it for the first time. We're on the journey just as much as everyone else is, and we can't wait to see where it all leads." 

We are next in space.
