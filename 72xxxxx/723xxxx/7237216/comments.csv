I realize I'm shooting for the moon, but do you have any of Freeman's solo stuff? I've been curious about it for a long time, but can barely find any acknowledgement that it ever existed.

Thanks again. I love this album!"
[V],80zforever,2012-05-03T21:49Z,"sultitan_itan, you're welcome. Noone knows if Freeman's solo stuff really existed. I have also heard he had made some solo but noone could point to even a single song/title etc. So it could be all rumours. Cheers"

Apparently they sell for zillions on eBay. You'd think something would've made its way online by now, but no such luck... Six albums, the last a two-disc'er. Hate to think of that much material getting locked away forever."
