The Lover Speaks was a New Wave duo formed by David Freeman and Joseph Hughes, two former members of the Punk band The Flys. Often stylistically compared to The Human League, the group released only a single self-titled album in 1986. 

Although they had minor hit in the U.K. with the song "No More 'I Love You's'" (later covered by Annie Lennox), a second album, The Big Lie, was recorded but never released. The duo broke up in 1988.
