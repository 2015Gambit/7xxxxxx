This is a more RESPECTABLE collection of the Patrik Hedstrom series by the very beautiful Swedish author Camilla Lackberg. This includes the just released U.S Version of The Stonecutter as well as the U.S. Version of The Preacher. The other books are the U.K. releases since the rights for her other books haven't been sold in America yet. They are considered retail quality, with U.K. and U.S. book covers. Complete and up to date metadata and Calibre ready. The dates are the U.K. publishing dates in parentheses. Only The Preacher (2011) and The Stonecutter (2012) have been optioned for U.S. printing house rights.
