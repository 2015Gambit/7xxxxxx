=======

Originally put together in 2009, the EP features covers that would have been
relevant and topical had they been released in that year.
Kid Cudi's "Pursuit of Happiness" is a shining spot on the album. A live staple,
Lissie's version of the tune is energetic and solid. The live recording here,
cheerily, starts with Lissie laughing with the crowd as she says, "I think I'm
gonna take a shot of tequila before I do it."
