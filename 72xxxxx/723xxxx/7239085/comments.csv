• Do not enter an Adobe ID > Select 'Connect later'
• Once installed, replace (keep a copy of the original just in case) [b]amtlib.framework[/b] in Application_Name.app/Contents/Frameworks/ with [k'ed] one.
• Repeat for any other applications from the suite you have installed.
• Block outgoing connections.

 A similar torrent to this one online a few days ago was pronounced a fake."
,theblackthumb,2012-05-04T02:26Z,It's not fake. Its the trial you would get directly from Adobe with a crack
,senseinai,2012-05-04T02:50Z,"Okay ... then why not let people download trials from Adobe and just put the cracks here, which would make for a smaller file?
I'll pull back on my intimation that this might be fake and wait for other downloaders to comment."
,soliday1,2012-05-04T03:48Z,thanks it works great had no problems doing it this way and as for senseinai you can download it did. from adobe site but u have to disconnect from the internet after u download it b4 u install it

,UrakiIsaac,2012-05-07T17:00Z,"Hi Guys, i reported earlier regard to the 3D menu.
I've an update on it. For those applied the amtlib.framework[K] to photoshop which does not run as extended version (no 3D menu). This is what you need to do. Revert the original ""amtlib.framework"" to photoshop and run it, it will prompt you to sign in Adobe ID (ignore it), with trial extended mode running, re-apply the amtlib.framework[K] and quit Photoshop and restart it > voila!! You got extended version now."
,iamasith,2012-05-07T19:08Z,"@ theblackthumb. Thank you very much for this torrent!. All are working with no probs.

@ Tower1122. I had the same issue as you when trying to launch Encore. So, after doing some searching, I came across this instruction on how to get Encore up and running. This was posted by theblackthumb at another CS6 torrent for Win version. But first uninstall only Encore. Reinstall it again by selecting Install and NOT Try and then follow the instructions:

4.Encore must be disconnected from internet and then it will ask for serial just copy one of the following serials from above and click next. It will then ask you to connect later, or connect now, click connect later. Then start it trial mode. It will say you have 30 days... Close out of Encore and copy the amtlib.dll to Encore install directory. Done!""

Thanks for helping me with your torrent...

I am a little dumb, I guess... :-)

I could download from Adobe.com but not in the way you stated ""canceling...""... I could download, actually it is downloading while I write you, from the link trials2.adobe.com/AdobeProducts/STAM/CS6/osx10/MasterCollection_CS6_LS16.dmg but FILE NOT FOUND from trials2.adobe.com/AdobeProducts/STAM/CS6/osx10/MasterCollection_CS6_LSen_US.dmg for example... If is what you meant... Where do I find the  Once installed, replace (keep a copy of the original just in case) [b]amtlib.framework[/b] in Application_Name.app/Contents/Frameworks/ with [k'ed] one.?

I couldn't get the trial mode with the 3D running. The Adobe app manager shut me down after I refused to enter the id info. The trial extended version never came up with 3D on it."

Once you've installed Photoshop CS6, go to Applications>CS6 folder>right click on the CS6 app icon and select ""show package content"">click the Content folder followed by the Framework folder. The original amtlib.framework folder should be in there. Just copy it and put it somewhere else i.e your documents folder or external drive. Then copy & paste the [K'ed] amtlib.framework folder that Framework folder.

,iamasith,2012-05-08T05:37Z,"@ zuttty. You have to uninstall PS CS6 and reinstall it using the TRY mode and not INSTALL. This is just for CS6. Once you've installed using TRY mode, do not replace the original amtlib.framework with the [K'ed] one. Startup CS6 first. Once it had started, quit CS6. Only then you can replace the original amtlib.framework with the [K'ed] one. You're good to go using CS6 Extended."

What I mean is, right-clicking on all the individual application and replace original amtlib.framework file with the [K'ed] file. You have to right click on all the application individually and paste over the [K'ed] file. By the way, K'ed is short for Kracked or Cracked. :)"

However as others have noticed some apps are very buggy. Not sure the cracks are ready for prime time. The most obvious I've seen is Acrobat Pro does not open a PDF if double clicked from the Finder. Also PDFs do not open if dragged and dropped on the Acrobat icon as they should. Makes me wonder how many other bugs are lurking the 13 other apps. BTW... I downloaded the trial directly from Adobe and used the cracks found here. Hopefully someone will post some serials so we can avoid the issues with the crack. Like not being able to do updates."
,jyurba,2012-05-13T07:12Z,@iamasith Thanks for the reply. Mine also says 7.14GB - I'm not sure the issue. recently I installed dreamweaver CS5 and it wouldn't work either - install kept failing no matter which torrent or even using an old one I had previously been using.

thanks for the upload"
,benjymoto,2012-08-27T16:35Z,"Hey Dillin!
Are you trying to transfere just the .dmg? because if so you can't.  It's probably because the external HD is using the exfat or MS-DOS (FAT) format, which actually tends to mess up larger files in transfer (happened to me all the time).  You can't transfer a file larger that 4 gig, so you could try installing the files into a folder on your desktop and transferring it that, since all the Adobe files are smaller than 4 gig.

(Or you could reformat your external HD to the Macintosh format that your OS runs, I think that should work too, I'm sure you know reformatting erases all your data, so be careful)

Hope that solves it for you, Cheers!"
