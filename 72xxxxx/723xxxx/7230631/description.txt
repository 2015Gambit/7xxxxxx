NOTES
We like to give a BIG FUCK YOU to hardstyle.com

Here is why:

2 weeks downtime without backups is a shame 
Artist complaining why their music isnt sold

Now its a bit running again and guess what:

highest quality for this track is 192 Kbit !!

What the fuck hs.com are you guys retarted ?

Learn how to run a descent shop
Learn how to make backups
Learn how to make a disaster recovery plan
Learn how to add tracks in all qualities to your site.
Learn about competitive prices and not charging 1 euro for paypal transactions

I rather see your site go down again so the music gets sold on descent web shops


Like ?? = Buy !!
