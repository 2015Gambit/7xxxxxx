2 Brides #1-4 (1996) [Complete] [Repost] English | 4 issues | CBR | 62.1MB Snappy, sassy, and fearless, the 22 Brides are a girl gang living a precarious existence involving them with mobsters. Artist Scott Lee has an appealing anime big-eye style and creates commendably grimy and realistic locations. He also knows which parts of girls he likes, and manages to emphasize them throughout. LetΓÇÖs hope he sees some real ones some day. Fabian Nicieza writes up a storm. ThereΓÇÖs wit, imagination, and some very funny dialogue, especially from an erudite enforcer who quotes from Bertrand Russell, and a gangster who takes Huggy Bear as his inspiration. DonΓÇÖt expect much beyond girls and guns and youΓÇÖll be pleasantly surprised, but come expecting anything more and youΓÇÖll be disappointed
