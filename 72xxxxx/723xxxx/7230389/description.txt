And it goes out with a full Disney-esque musical spectacular. When will we see the Broadway stage play?!?

ALL THE FILES INCLUDED IN THIS TORRENT WILL JUST BARELY FIT ON A SINGLE STANDARD DVD-R.

     This is the entire second season of "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic." These are from web and iTunes sources and are without badging and advertisements. These files are constructed to be computer, digital television, and portable device friendly. These will not play with iPods or iPads (they don't accept .avi files) until VLC or another player is available for them (again)... Somebody else is already making them specifically for iPod use. Sorry if that is what you are looking for.
     These are also aimed at being of a reasonable size. If you really want files that are a gigabyte or so in size, you might as well just wait for the official blu-ray release. And seriously, unless you are using raw 5.1 or higher sound, there is no absolutely no reason you should be anywhere near a gig, even for 1080p.

     This encode job is a favor for my friend and her husband, and like other jobs for my anime club, is being upped here in the spirit of sharing work with others. So be kind, but please comment and/or rate the material. I do take constructive criticism well, and it does help future endeavors.
