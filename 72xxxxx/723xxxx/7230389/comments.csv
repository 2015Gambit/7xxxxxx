,berneh,2012-05-06T05:52Z,"great torrent, V9 A9 
I'll keep seeding and where is that password for ep. 24?..."
,nastykoga,2012-05-11T17:58Z,the size of ep 24 is only 127 kb so i guess that one is fake. so i guess you will have to DL ep 24 individually 
,nastykoga,2012-05-12T12:30Z,my bad there is 2 copies disregard my last statement  
,IotIP,2012-06-15T06:23Z,"First, ALL the episodes are here... it's amazing how many people jumped to erroneous conclusions, and didn't even bother to check anything...
For those that are confused about the small passworded file.  It is a single picture, of questionable suitability (NSW), that my significant-other threw together in a couple of minutes.  If you read the text file in the torrent, it will indirectly tell you exactly what the password is.
Even if you don't open it, you are not missing anything, and it's not a fake, it's an ""extra"" -- just like the audio files."
