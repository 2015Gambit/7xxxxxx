Programming Massively Parallel Computers - A Hands-on Approach
by David B. Kirk and Wen-mei W. Hwu

For those interested in the GPU path to parallel enlightenment,
this new book from David Kirk and Wen-mei Hwu is a godsend, as it introduces
CUDA, a C-like data parallel language, and Tesla, the architecture
of the current generation of NVIDIA GPUs. In addition to explaining the
language and the architecture, they define the nature of data parallel problems
that run well on heterogeneous CPU-GPU hardware. More concretely,
two detailed case studies demonstrate speedups over CPU-only C
programs of 10X to 15X for na─▒┬¿ve CUDA code and 45X to 105X for expertly
tuned versions. They conclude with a glimpse of the future by describing the
next generation of data parallel languages and architectures: OpenCL and
the NVIDIA Fermi GPU. This book is a valuable addition to the recently
reinvigorated parallel computing literature.
