David Tennant and Patrick Stewart star in this critically acclaimed production of ShakespeareΓÇÖs masterpiece from BritainΓÇÖs renowned Royal Shakespeare Company. No recent stage production in Britain has attracted the excitement and nearly unanimous critical praise as this Hamlet. Tennant's interpretation was recognized as defining the role for a generation, and StewartΓÇÖs complex Claudius won the Olivier award, BritainΓÇÖs highest stage honor. In this specially-shot screen version, filmed on location rather than in the theater, Tennant and Stewart reprise their roles. Dynamic, exciting and contemporary, it breathes new life into Shakespeare's greatest play.
