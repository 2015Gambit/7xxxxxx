,WinterGale,2012-05-01T12:09Z,nope...this is the wineskin port
,AppRipper,2012-05-01T12:43Z,Yes it is a Mac port. Some say the port runs better than the native.
,AppRipper,2012-05-01T13:20Z,Just to make this clear I am using the porting team's wrapper. I am giving all credit of the wrapper to the porting team. Just so no one has the urge to bitch.
