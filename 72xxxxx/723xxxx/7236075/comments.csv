,SoFarGoneAhead,2012-05-03T02:29Z,Thanks man.. Hope you can post World's Finest (2012) soon
[T],MrDowntown,2012-05-03T05:55Z,That was pretty epic and show promise. The Trinity from this world were SO much better than the main universe - why dont they adopt those ...
,OButton,2012-05-03T14:12Z,Thanks for the great uploads - as usual.
,Street_Disciple,2012-05-03T15:16Z,Thanks a lot! Been looking forward to this one
,OdinsBeard,2012-05-03T18:18Z,"I too am getting the invalid rar file message when I open the file in Comical. All the other files I picked up from MirrorMaster have opened easily. 
thanks"
,OdinsBeard,2012-05-03T19:08Z,strange. Opens with ComicRack. Windows XP.
,lapis2,2012-05-03T20:26Z,i had to change the extension to cbz to get it to open
,garouterry,2012-05-04T08:02Z,Looks real promising. Love that Reis' cover. 
,Akercoke,2012-05-11T18:18Z,"It left me tantilised, however a lot of DC comics I read and tend to finish them thinking 'IS THAT ALL I GET after a month of waiting??'

I suspect this might be one of those."
,ili2882,2012-06-06T22:26Z,"#01 showed promise #02 is looking bad :/
too much political correctness?
will this post flashpoint dcu last?
I think not, flash #2 or Barry (now he is the first flash ) still remembers it as it was, and there is a mysterious character lurking in all new 52 issues, btw where is Wally or Flash #3?"
