Synopsis: from my own personal experience.. Photoshop CS6 is much faster, 
responsive, has 65 new features, and boasts a brand new/beautiful interface.
You'll love it!

PortableApps.comFormat:
In order to keep the load time/size at a minimal, i've removed everything 
non-essential... without losing the essence of Photoshop.

i.e. Switchboard, Service Manager.

Plug-ins:
- CameraRaw 7 CameraProfiles
- CameraRaw 7 LensProfiles
* i've separated these into plugins to avoid long load time, and make it
available for people who need it.
