,KevinCostner,2012-05-01T03:08Z,How does this compare to the cropped version which was pretty darn good?  Is it the same audio with people laughing in the background?
,Zagr0s,2012-05-01T07:47Z,Someone seed this for like.. 3 more minutes and ill finish it out for the night.... jesus
,Neraforesta,2012-05-01T18:23Z,"Really? No one on the peers list including myself can get past 99.6%.  Does this mean that the file is corrupt, or possibly is a fake? Been DL'n since last night, and it was going well till about 88%, then jack."
,Vegeta9021,2012-05-01T22:29Z,"Thanks for posting screens, unlike that FAG called scenerelease who's a noob and amateur at uploading.  "
,theeccentrik,2012-05-02T06:53Z,"Thanks bone, the guy who filmed this should see a dr about his narcolepsy as he slumps to the side every few mins! lol

I'll wait for r5."
,MiscFoxes,2012-05-05T14:58Z,"A/6, V/8

Image is slightly tilted down to the left throughout most of the film and, like it says, the subs are present throughout. There's some mild contrast issues here and there, dark scenes are pretty damn dark.

Audio is fairly clear, but there are still audience reactions present (though I have to say the reactions are mild to what they were in the theater I went to).

All in all, this copy is very watchable, audio is only slightly tinny and everyone can be heard well. "
,MiscFoxes,2012-05-05T15:20Z,"Also, it does NOT contain the clip at the end (as you can see our brave cameraman quickly hiding the camera as the credits begin). "
