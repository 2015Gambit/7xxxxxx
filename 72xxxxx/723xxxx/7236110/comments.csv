Get ready to sparkle, baby! Seven-year-old Eden Wood rocked the child pageant world when she announced she would be retiring from the competition circuit after six grueling years of dominating her rivals. Over 300 crowns and a legion of adoring fans were great, but being the natural entertainer that she is, Eden needed more. At the top of her game, Eden and her high-energy, show-biz loving mother Mickie Wood were eager to share their secrets with a new crop of girls striving to achieve their beauty queen dreams. ""Eden's World"" will follow Eden and her mom each week as they coach a child beauty queen and her mother at a pageant somewhere in small town America while also pursuing Eden's career as an actress/singer/model in New York City. But it's not all glitter and spotlights, as making it in NYC proves to be a bit tougher than Eden, or her team, anticipate. And in between all the auditions, catwalks and meetings, she's still got homework to do! The new docu-series, comprised of 8, 30-minute episodes, will prove pint-sized powerhouse Eden is destined to be the center of everyone's attention. (Source: Logo TV)
