Jimmy Jimmy was a duo consisting of vocalists/guitarists James O'Neill and Jimmy Kemp. This is a must have if you're looking to recollect the neglected past. Jimmy Jimmy would be seen busking in the UK around 1984 and the sad thing is that you'd still see them busking if you are ever in Coventry city. Great record and highly recommened. By the waym this is a new and better rip than the one I had posted before.
