Uppgrade to 2.0

Thank you for supporting this Ultimate AIM-Professionals mod vers. 2.0

Unzip it to: steamsteamappscommonjabia

The 2.0 release have many new configs files as the game was patched a major patch (1.13)

The style is again very hard, you get alot of enemy and they are bad, very bad.
I have test played this now for few hours and it is so great when using the FOW on.
(enemy is not seen if you really dont see them)

This version has a new music set. I hope you love it as much as I do.
The name of the musician guy is Matthew Pablo and he is doing a great job.
