Who is this Learning English Book meant for?
This Learning English Book is meant for those English American Students who are able to read it, for those English American Students who cannot get enough, for those who are the most experts whom are always learning (whether these ones are English teachers or not); of course, these ones not being native speakers of the English language, and specially for those who are BADASSES English students.  


This is the lesson's plot:

 
Weeks after the events that led to Lex LuthorΓÇÖs arrest, the impeachment of his presidency, and BatmanΓÇÖs success in saving the world from the impact of an arriving meteor, a spaceship lands in Gotham City Harbor and a young girl with no knowledge of English or any other human languages emerges.

Upon arrival, she accidentally causes all sorts of havoc with her Kryptonian-like powers until the Dark Knight catches her with a piece of Kryptonite from the ship. With SupermanΓÇÖs help, they discover that the girl is Kara Zor-El, the niece of Jor-El and Superman/Kal-ElΓÇÖs biological cousin. While Superman welcomes Kara with open arms and teaches her English and how to behave in society, Batman remains suspicious. 

Tipped off by Batman, Wonder Woman and Lyla ambush Clark Kent and Kara in a park and take Kara to Themyscira, on the basis that only there can she learn to control her powers. Superman reluctantly agrees, but still prefers to watch over Kara himself. Elsewhere, on the planet Apokolips, Darkseid learns of KaraΓÇÖs presence on Earth, and orders her to be captured and brought to Apokolips as a possible candidate to lead the Female Furies since the departure of Big Barda.
