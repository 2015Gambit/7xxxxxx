This is Digger Simulator 2011 ... ENGLISH

This I have translated from German into English, have spent four days on it now.
speak out if it's something.

I had some problems but this is Digger Simulator 2011 English BETA.

The reason why it's beta is because I have not completed the translation.
I am missing some programs on my PC when it got virus so I can not complete it yet.

option and the menu is in German. but the game itself is English, the help text is English, and it says what to do.

like I said, this is a beta .... until I get hold of my applications again.
