""The C-Word""

When the team takes on the case of 
Emily, a six-year-old girl who has 
numerous preexisting health problems, 
they must work with her mother 
Elizabeth, who happens to be doctor 
herself, specializing in her 
daughter's condition. The team must 
also deal with the battles raging 
between Emily's mother and father who 
have conflicting views on how to 
handle her health issues. When 
searching the family's home for clues 
to Emily's illness, the team realizes 
that Elizabeth's determination to

thing that is killing her. Meanwhile, 
House and Wilson take a little 
vacation."
