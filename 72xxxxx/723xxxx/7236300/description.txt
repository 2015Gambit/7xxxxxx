With the begining of world wide government censorship, each and every person
has the power to help. The Piratebay team has created a cgi-proxy
that can be hosted on any home computer or server, to help people
around the world access thepiratebay where it is being blocked. Recent
blocks in Holland and the UK that we CAN do something to help. This software
is not illegal to use. Create your own proxy today.
