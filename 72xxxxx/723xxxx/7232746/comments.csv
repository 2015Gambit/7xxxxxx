,Kamianbu,2012-05-01T22:32Z,"Really? It's one of the worst?

I've read dozens of comments like that one on many of my favorite games."
,groundonrage,2012-05-13T02:54Z,"I got the game to work fine but the activation code doesn't work, perhaps it's because everything is in capital letters when I typing in the game but I can't seem to change that function."
,sourchild,2012-06-08T05:01Z,"Poor quality torrent; doesn't work. 

I got the game from this page, and it works fine: http://sinisterdesign.net/?page_id=267"
