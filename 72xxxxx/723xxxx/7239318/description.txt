IMPORTANT! THIS WEEK?S SNAPSHOT IS EXTRA EXPERIMENTAL!
 
This week we?ve started working on separating the server logic from the client. The 

purpose of this is both to make it easier for us to add features (since we don?t have 

to implement stuff ΓÇ£twiceΓÇ¥), and also to make it possible for you to invite people to 

play on your local computer without setting up a server. In other words, more like 

how it works on Minecraft: Pocket Edition.

The work has not been completed yet, though, but a snapshot?s a snapshot. However, the game should still run fine, and we?ve also made some other tweaks:


1. More fixes to silk touch and block picking
2. Wooden tools work in furnaces
3. Villagers spawned from spawning eggs will get a random profession
4. Updated language files
5. EtcΓÇª
