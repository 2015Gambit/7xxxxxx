,bumba2,2012-05-08T08:08Z,"@team_xrg-thanks for all ur hdrips.afterall ur the best in hindi hd rips in tpb!!!

i got a suggestion for u as regular downloader of ur torrent.

aac/ac3 codecs are more universal than dts.but majority of ur torrents contain dts audio codec.guys downloading hdrips hardly play them in computers.we love to watch ur rips on hdtvs.but believe me 90%of hdtvs dont support dts.(i got a 40"" sony bravia and searching through net i came to know that sony never build any firmware that support dts,not even in high end models).so unfortunately i have to rip ur movies again.

please pay attention to my suggestion to rip in aac/ac3.ur our only hope especially we indians expect a lot from u!!!"
