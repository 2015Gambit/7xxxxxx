Is this a prob w/ tha game or tha patch or wut?  

btw it is set to run as admin privileges & blocked tha executable on my firewall, so thats not tha issue."
,tweakmode,2012-09-18T18:09Z,"Ok so I tha crack for tha update only, and then had issues where it wouldnt reload tha gun. I quit out then reinstalled tha patch & tha crack both & finally it had no issues. Gun reloads again, and cutscene error didnt happen. I have no idea why a patch is so inconsistent but reinstalling it seemed to work."
,tweakmode,2012-09-18T18:12Z,"To clarify: 
First time installing this patch & crack: Cutscene error w/ automatic force quit of game
Second time installing crack only: gun would not reload
Third time installing patch & crack: all fixed."
