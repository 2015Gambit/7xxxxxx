Black_Adder_S05E01_back_and_forth_widescreen_edition_audio_fixed

ENGLISH no subs

also known as millennium special

Sci-Fi Plot Comedy totally funny and hasnt
been air-ed on tv in most countries
and once in UK

but its really a pilot for the 5th series
which wasnt produced or to leave it
open for future expansion
where they miss up time lines more and more
 and have
to undo it

its nothing like the other specials
like xmas coral one

this is a RESEED request

seems all the copies out there
have hard subs or poor VHSrips or
out of sync or NON widescreen !!
so this is really missing from
the ultimate collection
