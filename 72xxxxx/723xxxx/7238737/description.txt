My collection of William C Dietz books. They're in ePub format. I ran them through Calibre and they all have the correct metadata and covers. I'll seed when I can, but I'm on the road a lot. That being said, please help me seed. I have a huge collection of books I'd like to get out there. This collection is fairly complete.
