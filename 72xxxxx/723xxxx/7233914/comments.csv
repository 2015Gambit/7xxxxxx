,demonet,2012-05-02T20:38Z,"Not sure what happened.... But neither of the two keys in the .txt file seem to work.  Using internet activation.

Anyone have any idea what happened?  Is this key now invalid?"
,Carrot_Bottom,2012-05-07T16:18Z,Both of the serial numbers do NOT work!
,sayara69,2012-05-10T18:49Z,have a problem key not work
,RearVue,2012-05-23T22:49Z,Are you not going to respond Anacondaz????
,Damien74,2012-05-26T22:49Z,"It's true, it doesn't work.
The activation key is fine. But you also need a serial number to register, and that is NOT included.
I searched on the web and I can only find this release, no new with serial/reg name.
So it doesn't work at this point.
I followed the instructions as well, but again, needs a serial key, not just activation code."
