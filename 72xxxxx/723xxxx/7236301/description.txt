ItΓÇÖs vampire politics as usual around the town of Bon Temps, but never before have they hit so close to SookieΓÇÖs heartΓÇª

Growing up with telepathic abilities, Sookie Stackhouse realized early on there were things sheΓÇÖd rather not know. And now that sheΓÇÖs an adult, she also realizes that some things she knows about, sheΓÇÖd rather not seeΓÇölike Eric Northman feeding off another woman. A younger one.

ThereΓÇÖs a thing or two sheΓÇÖd like to say about that, but she has to keep quietΓÇöFelipe de Castro, the Vampire King of Louisiana (and Arkansas and Nevada), is in town. ItΓÇÖs the worst possible time for a human body to show up in EricΓÇÖs front yardΓÇöespecially the body of the woman whose blood he just drank.

Now, itΓÇÖs up to Sookie and Bill, the official Area Five investigator, to solve the murder. Sookie thinks that, at least this time, the dead girlΓÇÖs fate has nothing to do with her. But she is wrong. She has an enemy, one far more devious than she would ever suspect, whoΓÇÖs set out to make SookieΓÇÖs world come crashing down
