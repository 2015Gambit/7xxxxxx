,CCRLH85,2012-05-03T20:07Z,This file won't open with either 7-Zip or Windows built-in .zip handler.  Either the zip file is broken or this is a fake.
,sprnto,2012-05-03T21:36Z,I also cannot get the second file to open. Anyone fine a solution to this?
,Silverhandhealer,2012-05-04T01:31Z,"This file is reported as either a broken archive, or not really an archive. Beware "
,reaganFF,2012-05-04T15:38Z,"Scan of zip file says it's clean, but it wouldn't extract for me, either."
