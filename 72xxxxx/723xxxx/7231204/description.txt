Big money and big media have coupled to create a ΓÇÿDisney WorldΓÇÖ of democracy in which TV shows, televised debates, even news coverage is being dumbed down,

resulting in a public less informed than it should be, says Marty Kaplan, director of USCΓÇÖs Norman Lear Center and an entertainment industry veteran.

Bill Moyers talks with Kaplan about how taking news out of the journalism box and placing it in the entertainment box is hurting democracy and allowing special interest groups to manipulate the system.



Later on the show, Bill talks about Florida Rep. Allen West and shocking modern-day McCarthyism. WasnΓÇÖt this lesson already learned?
