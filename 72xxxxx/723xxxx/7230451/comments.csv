Shill reviews?, 29 April 2012 [stars awarded] 1/10
Author: eggbertsmith from United States

The two other reviews (at the moment) give this 10 stars.
The reviewers have never reviewed another film.
Do the math.

""a very stylized, introspective chronicle of a artist's life and his work."" Oh really? Please, ignore what I am about to say in the next paragraph....and download this film. Then watch it. You might be sorry, but you'll not doubt my future reviews as being the rantings of a lunatic.
Once again I've been assaulted by a sub student-grade film. By ""stylized"", I think the previous reviewer meant to say....""shot on consumer equipment by a student attempting to draw attention away from his complete and absolute lack of talent with vast amounts of nudity"".

Sure, a clever game plan. It got me to watch it. And it was painful.
This LEGITIMATE review, unlike the others, is the price this film must pay for masquerading as a real film, wasting my time, and offending the Gods of film.
As I've said before, and it surely applies now.....I have seen MUCH better student films. This film is the result of too little talent, and too much motivation.

Excuses for showing tits, 30 April 2012 [stars awarded] 2/10
Author: ReyLagarto from Montevideo, Uruguay

It's silly how nowadays some people look for excuses to show boobs (for me Game Of Thrones is one example). This ""movie"" is irritating in that sense. Also it's a bit offensive. Let me expand on that. On one hand, all the nudity he filmed (not the ""documental"" part of the thing) was exclusively women showing their boobs. Do you really need to make an excuse for that? You could easily have made a porno, and you could have banged your cast mates. That was all you wanted. Men can also be nudist, duh. On the other hand, it pisses me off the way the naked body of a woman must always be used as a way to sell things (PETA's adds are always with naked women, men are always dressed). Halfway through the film I had to stop, so, I just endured about 50 minutes. That's to say a lot IMHO.

What kind of fu***** movie is this?, 1 May 2012 [stars awarded] 1/10
Author: Resalat Rahman from Bangladesh

It was just a waste of my time and bandwidth. I live in a country where internet line is slow, content bandwidth is limited. I downloaded a 700 MB size version of this film which took me 4 hours, and to finish the film it just took me roughly 15 minutes, because after 10 minutes I had no other choice except to fast forward it to the end. By the name of the movie, I got interested in watching, thought it would be something like American Pie. But it was a absolute disaster. Just telling awful would be less. There is nothing to tell about this movie. It cost me almost 5 hours (thanks god I didn't watch the whole movie) and 800 MB content bandwidth which I will never get back.

If you like to see bullshit, you can watch this. This review system won't let me vote under 1, so still this title is getting some marks.
