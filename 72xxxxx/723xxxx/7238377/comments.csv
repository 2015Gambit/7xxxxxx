Hopefully the Irish people will be able to embrace a secular, science based future and turn their backs on this hideous mumbo jumbo!"

Inquisition and crusades do not mean much for common people, so perhaps we can make them change their minds a little bit through another kind of emotion, through the horrible scenes of children being raped and abused by these men - with no divine punishment."
