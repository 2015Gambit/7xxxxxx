Thanks Nepotu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

@Kole97: :) Than you and you're welcome!"

You could pull a hamstring even by walking, so that has nothing to do with sports. And yes, Baseball is a sport where they compete on a physical basis. Even chess is considered a sport by many.
If you don't like it don't watch it, but accept that others like to watch it...

@Nepotu
Thanks for your effort. It's good to finally see some MLB games here on TPB. I'll keep seeding the games for some time to support your cause. Maybe a few more will follow this so there can be more games in the future.
If it's possible and you like to do it, maybe you could even mix the covered teams up a bit but that's totally up to you. I'm gratefull for any game posted here and even like the Yanks, so it's nice to keep track of them this way."

I also like the quality and filesize very much. Nice work."
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-06T03:16Z,u r welcome lechuck! Look! In the NYY torrents you ask me what baseball game you want to watch and I'll see what I can do! I don't promise you nothing but I will try to help you. Ok?
,Lechuck93,2012-05-07T15:42Z,"Yeah, will do that in time. Thx again."
