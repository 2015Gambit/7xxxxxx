,MechaMonkeyz,2012-05-07T04:52Z,i play the game and it wont save my characters
,kompas909,2012-05-07T11:43Z,"1st. be sure you choose GameSpy, not a steam, for MP.
2nd. you can try run DunDefGame.exe as administrator.
3rd. Change your game location."
,5bux,2012-05-08T03:38Z,"Kompas909, excellent work. This torrent works out of the box :-) W7/64. My kids love this game, it is slow to begin with, learning what you can do. You know any good beginner tutorials? How to build mana quickly? Look forward to 7.33 patch."
,G00kyMaRv,2012-05-10T11:43Z,"hey everyone...sorry i'm kind of new to this, but i was wondering how to install the game. i downloaded the files already and it's on winrar

,Sonic_778,2012-05-10T22:52Z,"Just to clarify, will this torrent update any version of the game to 7.32 or is it just a 7.31 to 7.32 update? For example, will I be able to update my game from 7.25c to 7.32 using this download alone? Thanks in advance."
,oorenotsoo,2012-05-12T19:09Z,Thanks Kompas. Haven't play since like 7.04 so I'm looking forward to seeing the new stuff.
