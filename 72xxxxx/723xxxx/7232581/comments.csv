[V],Nepotu,2012-05-03T01:20Z,"Thank you my dearest friends for these great words. To respond at Dimmis80: The problem is: You guys know that I am here for many years, first like a leecher, then like a Barca games uploader, then like many other things uploader etc. Once upon a time, I found a site who put BBall torrents in it. I brought them here. A little while, appeared Gondy who found the same site and take the charge of these torrents. I didn't say anything. The contrary. I congratulated him for his speed and I thought he is a friend who can help us. I left him alone to do this further and I searched other site. I found it. The site where this torrents comes from now. Yesterday he found it too, and because of his frustration he uploaded all the versions of the yesterday's games he could find so that I can't up nothing. And I mean nothing at all. What you call that? A friendship? Disrespect, man! I don't hate him, like he says, only I think that he was disrespectful about my work, because my job wasn't only copy-paste, but puting the roster, the starter lineup, the photo and many hystorical dates on the old NBA games - that it means some work. Finally, if he would asked me to share some work, with respect I would not told him no. I'm not the owner of those torrents, I'm not the owner of this site, the world is big enough for anybody but what he did gave me a bitter taste. So, I don't need mercy, I don't cry; if he wants to talk to me, fine; if he don't, the same, who was wrong is he. I treated him like a friend. Always."
