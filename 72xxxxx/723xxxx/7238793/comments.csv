,cvvutg,2012-05-04T20:22Z,"Yes, something weird has happened so I'm going to produce a replacement torrent. So far as I can see the files with problems are:

Handbook of Set Theory
Herrlich - Axiom of Choice
Jech - Set Theory
Shelah - Proper and Improper Forcing
The Princeton Companion to Mathematics

Are there any others?
Thanks"
