Simon Reeve visits the tropical Indian Ocean Islands of Madagascar, Mauritius
and the Seychelles on the second leg of his journey.

Amid the paradise of coral reefs and jungles full of spectacular wildlife,
Simon witnesses some of the threats to the Ocean. Off the coast of Madagascar,
he goes spear fishing with the Vezo people, whose lifestyle is at risk from
their own population growth, and in Mauritius he sees the vast industrial tuna
trawlers unloading their catch. In the Seychelles, Simon meets an eccentric
Englishman who is fighting back by turning his private paradise island into the
world's smallest national park - largely populated by giant tortoises who start
their life in his bedroom.

But there is no escaping the problems of the world even here, and Simon joins
Dutch special forces training to board ships on the high seas controlled by
pirates.
