They were some moments, like 1 second where there was no sound. But it is not a problem.
I am sure you will do the same hack with the Film 
'' The Avengers 2012''. 
Thanks a lot for the films."
,Thor97,2012-05-17T11:28Z,"Could you say me how do you hack these Blu-Ray Films and then turn them into Itunes compatible Films?
Waiting for your answer."
,TF746,2012-05-20T18:39Z,"Thor97: There are freeware applications that allow you to edit the tags on the films that you can't add in iTunes, such as the film's rating and the High Definition tag. These applications are called MetaX and Subler. And as for getting the film into the iTunes .m4v file format, it's the default format when ripping a Blu-Ray Disc or DVD film to your computer using Handbrake. I hope this clears up any questions. And for anyone else,
