Deadlocked [Sookie Stackhouse Series: Book 12] ΓÇô Charlaine Harris

With Felipe de Castro, the Vampire King of Louisiana (and Arkansas and Nevada), in town, itΓÇÖs the worst possible time for a body to show up in Eric NorthmanΓÇÖs front yardΓÇôespecially the body of a woman whose blood he just drank. Now, itΓÇÖs up to Sookie and Bill, the official Area Five investigator, to solve the murder. Sookie thinks that, at least this time, the dead girlΓÇÖs fate has nothing to do with her. But she is wrong. She has an enemy, one far more devious than she would ever suspect, whoΓÇÖs out to make SookieΓÇÖs world come crashing down.
