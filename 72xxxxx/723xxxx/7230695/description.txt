Plot..........: The year is 1945, the closing stages of WW2, and 
                a German scientist by the name of Klausener is 
                working on a frightening new technology that has 
                the power to create an immortal Nazi army. Flash
                forward to present day, and a NATO task force is
                hurriedly deployed to Eastern Europe, where a 
                sinister enemy appears to be mercilessly killing 
                everything in its path. But this is no ordinary foe.
                Only Helena, a gutsy investigator on the trail of
                the notorious war-criminal Klausener, accepts the 
                reality of that they are facing a battalion of Nazi 
                Storm-Troopers, a veritable zombie army on the march.
                With the help of Wallace, a man who's been chasing Nazi
                secrets for years, the two of them team up with a Special
                Forces Unit to venture deep behind enemy lines. Their
                mission to fight their way back to the source of this 
                evil army and prevent the seemingly inevitable rise of the 4th Reich.
