,BigLloyd,2012-05-02T05:15Z,any comments on quality of THIS release?? or is it the same?? NOT complaining just asking. thanxs uploader for your effort!!!!
,hollowbackholloway,2012-05-02T06:51Z,"thanx guys I have a membership to scenebalance before they closed.  Also thanx for the info.  Also, I see alot of demonoid reposts on this site so you are probably right.

There's a reason why 90% of the torrents you get from this site say (Demonoid) on the download...  Seriously.  I just ping between the two depending on my mood.  I've never found a torrent on this site that wasn't on demonoid, or the other way around.  Just saying."
