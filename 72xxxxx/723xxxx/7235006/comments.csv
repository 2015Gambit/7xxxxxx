,friend55,2012-05-05T02:20Z,"The media and the race hustling industry keeps re-inventing myths about the Tuskegee Airmen being invincible fighters.

Tuskegee University has published a paper on their website that tries to show a balanced and realistic portrayal of the black pilots during WWII.

The first mission assigned to black pilots was to strafe Axis fighters on a tiny Italian island. Their performance was considered poor because the black squadron fled from Axis planes, while members of two white squadrons engaged. Their was a congressional hearing on weather or not to disband the project. However, activist members of US congress protected the project. They believed that the pilots would serve as role models for black Americans.

However, for the duration of the war, the black pilots continued the same pattern. They would rarely engage or pursue enemy aircraft.

When you compare the records of fighter groups flying the advanced P-51 planes in the 15th Air Force, we see that white fighter groups scored 2.26 victories for every plane lost. This is 3.5 times the rate of the black fighter group.

In other words, white pilots flying the same planes and the same missions were 350% more effective. Think of this as an investment. For every dollar you invest in the black pilots yields $.66, while every dollar invested in the white pilots yields $2.26.

There were three black pilots who were awarded for having four or more victories. However it is a myth that any black pilots scored five victories, but were denied being recognized as an â&#x20AC;&#x153;Ace.â&#x20AC;?

,GeniusAnomaly,2012-05-06T16:01Z,"Part of the reason that may be so 'friend55' is that they were hated by the country that they were fighting for because the color of their skin, they were under-educated for hundreds of years, treated like shit, treated like second class citizens, they hadn't been training as long as the other pilots, some being from WWI. They still had the courage to try even if they weren't very good at it, because it was their fucking country too! By the way I can't help but notice that you seem to think that it was because they were white that they did better (the pilots) as you only mention race and the the pilots stats, humans have the same capacity to learn throughout, the only reason there is a difference in race is due to SOCIAL ISSUES. Your whole point that you made is essentially racist, if you truly believe that race was the deciding factor, that makes you a racist!"
,GeniusAnomaly,2012-05-06T16:02Z,Thanks for the upload BOZX!

,oldbreadbutt,2012-05-07T09:45Z,"@GeniusAnomaly don't listen to a word friend555 says, especially if he gets his facts from cofcc.org,  it's just a white supremacist website dressed up to look like a conservative news blog."
,MitchAllen,2012-05-07T22:15Z,Dont know if he was lying or not but was fun to read lol. Also if true thats so funny.
,CakeMonster,2012-05-18T02:42Z,"@friend55

You are comparing apples and oranges

Their mission was not search and destroy, their mission was to protect the bombers

You can shoot down more enemy airplanes if you forget about your bombers

The Tuskegee has the LOWEST losses of bombers that they were protecting."
,irishjig,2012-05-27T09:20Z,"@oldbreadbutt

Actually his post is correct. The numbers are even posted on the Tuskegee Airmen website. A site that honors them. You can find this going into history and clicking 9 myths. 

@CakeMonster

They lost the least bombers and shot down the least planes? Listen to how that sounds. I would venture a guess and say that they could just as well have been in less heated combat. Having less fighters to shoot at would give the exact graph of the Tuskegee Airmen. 

I salute them for fighting for their country. Sadly the their story is wrapped up is a lot of false facts."
,CakeMonster,2012-05-29T03:38Z,"@irishjig  

What it sounds to you does not matter that is FACT

They lost the least number of bombers AND that is included all the factors such as numbers fighting etc


IF you stay with the bombers you will shoot down less planes because once the battle is over you can choose to FOLLOW the enemy retreating OR stick with the bombers

IF YOU FOLLOW the enemy then a second group might fly in and kill more bombers

IF you stay you will not be able to shoot down the fleeing enemy making your kill ratio less BUT FACT IS FACT

They lost the least number of Bombers propertionally to their numbers and how many fights they were in

And what you think and your oppinion does NOT matter"
,CakeMonster,2012-05-29T03:46Z,"@irishjig  Also they were never given any free seek and destroy missions which is where you flying over enemy territory looking for enemy fighters

Their mission in Germany was to protect bombers

So again comparing kill ratio is pointless because you will get a much higher kill ratio with seek and destroy mission, than you get from protection missions

And again they had the LOWEST numbers of loss proportionally to the number of missions and bombers they protected"

,ninth1der,2012-06-09T03:12Z,"@yuiooooot: about the kiddie level plot: remember the target audience.  Urban males ages 10 to 25.  Lower socioeconomic status and lower education, pervasive violence in popular entertainment (rap and hip/hop) and under developed ability to grasp thematic subtleties.  

So, Hollywood's answer: dumb down the plot; hype up the violence; hyperbolize the characters; re-invent the antagonist from Axis Powers to ""White America"" and viola you have a critically acclaimed cinematic turd.  

Critically acclaimed because if you point out the historical in accuracies: ""That's RACIST.""
Critically acclaimed because if you point out the oversimplified plot: ""That's RACIST!""
Box office success because the target audience has the highest ratio of discretionary spending to income.  But If I point out that someone in the ""'hood"" is rolling on $5000 of ""dubs"" while his children get neglected: ""That's RACIST!""

I will watch this film right after I watch Justin Bieber in concert with Rebecca Black.  And Wiz Kalifa opens.  When that happens it won't matter what I think of this film, because the zombie apocalypse is here."
