I borrowed my friend's copy for a very serious case I was involved in. I went through the whole program and I knew nothing more about what to do for my case than I did before the program. Fortunately, I was able to find the info on my own. What you need to do, until someone produces a program that teaches what you need to know, is to find a university law library and spend A LOT of time there.

Every state's laws and rules of procedure are different, so no program can tell anyone in any state exactly what to do. What you need to learn is: 1) How courts are organized, 2) How to find the laws and rules of procedure in your state, and 3) How to research the law. These are things that can easily be taught in one program for anyone in any state. But this Jurisdictionary program teaches NONE of that. I could speculate on whether this is intentional or an accident, but it doesn't change the outcome. 

So if you don't want to believe me, go ahead and download this for free so you at least don't throw your money away.

I haven't downloaded this torrent, so I don't know what's in it, but I will list everything that should be in the program and if it's not all there, post here and I will upload my friend's copy.

,FunnyJ0KE,2012-06-27T23:51Z,"Hi, R9k6wh0naIK.

Please upload your friend's copy.  I found a copy, but the contents don't match up to what you describe.

Thanks in advance."
,R9k6wh0naIK,2012-06-29T00:39Z,"Hi FunnyJOKE, As I said, I'd be glad to upload, but can you confirm that THIS torrent doesn't match to my description? You sound you ""found a copy"", so I wasn't sure if that meant this torrent.

I really want to confirm this because this could take me some time, as I have never uploaded a torrent before and I would have to learn.  There will be no problem learning, but it will take me some time and effort. So if you tell me that THIS torrent isn't right, it will take me some time--maybe a couple of weeks? Just letting you know!"
,FunnyJ0KE,2012-06-30T19:26Z,"Hi, R9k6wh0naIK.

I must have been really tired or something when I made the previous post.  Yes, the copy I referred to was from this torrent.

Let me say, I really appreciate your feedback on what Jurisdictionary does and does NOT teach.  Your feedback makes me wonder a bit about the usefulness of Jurisdictionary.  I would like to communicate with you about some of that, being a student of law myself.  As a side note, I'm trying to find an electronic copy of Corpus Juris Secundum (CJS), which is many volumes and $10,000 to buy.

This torrent has a 808 MB file named 'Juridictionary Legal Tutorials.rar'.

The following is contained in the RAR file:


There is a folder named '090624_1020', which seems to match the contents of what you say 'DISK 4' should have.

There is a folder named 'Audio Disk 1' with 25 MP3 files, each named '(Jurisdictionary) - 01.mp3' thru '(Jurisdictionary) - 25.mp3'.

There is a folder named 'Audio Disk 2' with 25 MP3 files, each named '(null) - 01.mp3' thru '(null) - 25.mp3'.


There is a folder named 'Disk 1 copy' containing the following:

- folder named 'images'
- folder named 'movies'
autorun.inf
balance.ico
config.xml
Install_Flash_Player.exe
Start.html
video_lawsuit_seminar.swf
+ image.ccd
+ a duplicate of all the files from the 'movies' folder


There is a folder named 'Disk 2 copy' containing the following:

I asked you to upload your friend's copy because this torrent doesn't seem to match up with what you described, but on closer inspection, it probably has everything, it just isn't/wasn't organized very well, like the person that made the folders and the rar file didn't know what they were doing or got a bit careless.

Since Disk 1 plus Disk 2 should be a total of 25 audio tracks (files), I'm wondering if the 'Audio Disk 1' folder in this RAR file is all of the 25 audio tracks (files) in one folder.  Even if that is the case, what is the 'Audio Disk 2' folder in this RAR file.  The SHA-1 checksum hashes of the files show that the files in these 'Audio Disk 1' and 'Audio Disk 2' folders are NOT the same, it isn't just that they are named differently.

Therefore, it would be greatly appreciated if you could make images of the four discs and upload them so that we have a good, accurate, and unaltered copy.  That said, if I like what I see, I plan on buying the full Jurisdictionary set myself for what it does cover.
