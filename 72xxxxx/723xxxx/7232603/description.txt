Narratives:

Brad feels like a longshot that came in. This 20-year-old side project somehow managed to skirt the perils that doomed so many of their Seattle peers: the decline of grunge, flannel shortages, Courtney Love. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Brad guitarist Stone Gossard (Pearl Jam) attributed their longevity, in part, to the band being an outlet for making music with no expectations. On United We Stand, this anything-goes atmosphere yields what could be leftover Rage Against the Machine cover art and a record that begins with quintessential Brad and ends in side project B-sides.
