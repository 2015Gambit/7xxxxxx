,ProphetZarquon,2012-05-05T08:17Z,"ONE bad frame in the very final scene.
I was gonna USE that scene...

Anyway, thanks for yet another great upload, here's me hoping for an XviD repack for this episode."
,ProphetZarquon,2012-05-08T03:06Z,"Well, I tried
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7240834/The.Big.Bang.Theory.S05E23.HDTV.XviD-2HD
and the Video glitch in the final scene is gone in that version, BUT there is an Audio dropout in the same spot instead!

I've now tried two x264 and two XviD uploads under two media players (Media Player Classic & VLC) on Win7 and Mac (Quicktime & VLC) with the same results.

Every file I find has an error or cut frame in the same spot!  Is it possible the Master which was sent to air had a bad frame?

Still hoping for a quality fix for this episode."
