,zvengar,2012-05-03T15:35Z,"Like Most of the copies already downlooaded,theres the fight scene with THOR and IRONMAN that goes blurry.

Still thums up.

oh,yea;....try turning the auto-focus off,"
,Vegeta9021,2012-05-04T04:28Z,"Since the Uploader is too stupid and lazy to post some screenshots, then I am too lazy to download ""thumb it up"" so I've just thumbed down the torrent instead and will say this is a 0/10.  Don't download this folks."
,Wolfenbane,2012-05-04T08:30Z,"@Vegeta9021

Oh wow, you want to be such a little prick about the torrent information? Look at that skull, see that it exists? Means he's doing something right. He's got other torrents to take care of uploading, and not to pander to the childish wants of every pathetic leech who acts like this is a service industry. You get what you get, nothing more."
,violetflame,2012-05-04T23:58Z,"Nice one, Wolfenbane!"
,JoniBanks,2012-05-05T01:49Z,Not Working -- downloaded today & it says file corrupted. :(
,Iceman196744,2012-05-06T13:33Z,"Vegeta9021 Your a self centred, selfish little dick who's got there head stuck so far up their own behind you can only smell the shit your speaking, well give me your address and I'll come round and help you remove it, who knows you may just grow up and get some manners when your smelling fresh air, then again youâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;re so used to people doing everything for you, I don't think you would, you probably can't even tie your own shoe laces let alone wipe your own arse dick head."
,luapttam85,2012-05-09T03:52Z,"@Vegeta9021 Took a look at your account. Noticed you haven't uploaded anything. Why don't you actually do something for the community before you bitch about someones torrent. 

(My torrents are currently on Demonoid but headed this way in case you decide to hurt yourself thinking of a comeback)

Once again, thank you drunkbob!"
,XBlueInsanityX,2012-05-09T12:52Z,"Thanks for the upload Drunkbob. Been waiting for this film lol. I wondered if this was converted to dvd format, would it work correctly on a DVD player please? 

Oh and Vegeta9021. Im going to try and put these words across without trying to offend you in any way, shape or form.......... Go fuck yourself."
,mr_emito,2012-05-10T02:26Z,"Pretty good CAM 
A:5
V:7
Thanks for the upload"
,TRDRacingS,2012-05-10T07:25Z,Good for a CAM A5 V7. A few blurry scenes and you can hear often a person rustling through a bag o candy or nachos lol. Over all a very good and very watchable copy but like the title says its a cam so don't expect to much.

,bismarket,2012-05-10T22:04Z,"Sorry if this seems a dumb question to anyone but i'm using linux mint & VLC, will i have any prob's playing this? I'm thinking ""No problem"" but not sure?"
,luapttam85,2012-05-11T01:59Z,^^You should be just fine. I have a laptop with a Linux partition and have never had any problems playing these files. 
,wezo667,2012-05-14T21:15Z,brilliant quality sightly blurry in the iron man and Thor fight scene but over all fantastic seriously recommend watching this film  
,Zero236,2012-06-10T02:32Z,"@drunkbob
