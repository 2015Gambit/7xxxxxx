,byronbay,2012-06-14T02:55Z,"Don't quite understand why there aren't hard-coded subtitles for the Dothraki spoken parts, fairly annoying!"
,Joaric,2012-06-15T09:04Z,"Please seed people, if the download doesn't speed up, this will take a year. Seeders unite pls!"
,byronbay,2012-06-17T20:02Z,"Thanks for the effort, but I don't want to watch the whole episode with english subs just to understand what's going on in a few minutes worth of Dothraki scenes.. Great quality but I will be deleting and replacing with a version that offers me this choice."
,TheHairyCat,2012-06-19T05:35Z,I have seeded to 3 times ratio. if you d/l don't seed then it will be dead soon.
,wndead,2012-07-01T17:52Z,"Down speed at less than 5kbps, please keep seeding guys! thank you!! This looks really promising"
,skywalka,2012-07-13T10:14Z,"Another torrent with no subs for the non English dialogue. The subs mentioned in the comments are for ALL the dialogue, even English.

Find another torrent."
