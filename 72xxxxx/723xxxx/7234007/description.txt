Over on the Nintendo DS, Drawn to Life hit the system's cartridge slot about two years ago and cast you as the Creator, an omniscient being who could create a hero, weapons, and more just by doodling on the touch screen. The title found success with its creation aspect and platforming mix, and just this week spawned the sequel, Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter on both the DS and Wii.
