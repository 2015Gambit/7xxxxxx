Light the Ocean
Light The Ocean is an entirely new perspective on the ocean world. By combining data from scientists around the globe with specially developed computer animation software we are able to turn the waters of the ocean crystal clear. We reveal spectacular underwater landscapes and hidden structures in the ocean itself. We show how landscapes and water interact on unimaginable scales to create an ocean world as diverse in habitats as anywhere on dry land. Our camera crews have also travelled the planet, from the Antarctic to the deep waters of the mid-Atlantic to capture spectacular new footage of the creatures that depend on these ocean habitats. We follow sperm whales as they dive into the dark depths of the Kaikoura Canyon off New Zealand and we descend to the underwater mountain ranges of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to find creatures never before seen.
