Johnson: What if we made Superman ... black?

DCE: You mean like bring back John Henry Irons? Or pull a Marvel and create a new multi-cultural character to take on the mantle of Superman? Or do you mean a kryptonian that just happens to have a different skin color because he was from a different part of krypton?

Johnson: No I mean, we take superman ... and we make him black.

DCE: Johnson! ...

Johnson: Yes sir?

DCE: You're getting a raise!

Johnson: Oh and we should make him president!

DCE:...and a company car!

Johnson: And he can accuse Lex Luthor of being racist!

DCE: Come sit in my chair son..."
