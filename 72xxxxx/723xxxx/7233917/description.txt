2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

As it turns out, this is my 1000th torrent here on The Pirate Bay today.  Because many of my torrents are bundles and discographies, 1000 torrents is not just 1000 albums.  In fact, I did a little math a short bit ago, and of the 1000 torrents, it adds up to 4,046 Christian albums, and 392 God-inspired sermons.

My first share was back on April 20, 2009.  Following that, I took a small hiatus from The Pirate Bay.  Slightly more than three years later, GodΓÇÖs being glorified with this 1000th Christian Torrent today!  Amen!

I'm not mentioning any of this to gloat.  It's all in His glory.  1 Corinthians 10:31, right?  WeΓÇÖre all doing great things for Him here on The Pirate Bay, as He calls us to do so.  He plants the seeds, we serve Him in whatever way we can to help those seeds grow.

I was surprised to see that many of those older 2009 torrents are still going strong today.  They're blessed with great seeding support.  So I would be remissed if I didnΓÇÖt take a moment to thank everyone whoΓÇÖs been continuing to share what was shared with them over three years ago today!
