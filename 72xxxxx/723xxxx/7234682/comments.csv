[V],Anacondaz,2012-05-02T17:37Z,its false positive mate
,lol9765,2012-05-02T20:18Z,"@cawoodie1234

It's a false positive - which means your anti-virus is detecting it as malicious, but in reality it's not. Lots of anti-virus or anti-spyware software will detect pirated software as malicious - don't worry, you're fine. "
,nitrojunkie007,2012-05-02T22:11Z,I disable My kaspersky Pure 2 before installation but it deletes the crack file again and again after re enabling without asking me...
[V],scene4all,2012-05-03T00:33Z,"Hmm, that's weird, I scanned it with Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 and it came up clean, yet ur Kaspersky Pure 2.0 is deleting the crack. Anyways just add the crack to ur exclusions list.

,j5ize,2012-05-04T14:23Z,"Works great, Trojan warnings are false positives.

Thanks scene4all. I've DL'd a lot of your stuff, all of it works great and DL's fast. Keep up the great work!"

,Countdesade,2012-05-13T11:41Z,DONT WORRY. IT ALWAYS SAYS VIRUS OR TROJAN WHEN FILES HAVE CRACKS AND GENERATORS
,Arachne,2012-06-09T05:38Z,No problem whatsoever.  It works great.  Thanks.
,skulldragon,2012-06-09T09:42Z,"Ok, now this works! Even backup creation. Dunno, why A4's crap is on top...

Yea, this one is clean.
But it's not ""always do include"". Some really do have similar sig. or a superior defense, but some do actually have real viruses.
The golden rule is to have a good firewall instead - to monitor things - if nothing goes nowhere and no suspicious processes are resident in memory, then it's all good."
