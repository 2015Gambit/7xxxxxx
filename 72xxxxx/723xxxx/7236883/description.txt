Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday, May 2 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the Osama bin Laden assassination hoax perpetuated by the government and other topics. 

Alex also covers the latest ominous warnings over CISPA, the internet spying bill working its way through Congress, and the denial of Cass Sunstein as he tries to run away from his past and his call to infiltrate the truth movement. 

Alex takes calls from members of the military and covers the latest news.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
