DESCRIPTION:

What is the relationship between philosophy and organization theory (OT)? While at first glance there might appear to be little, a closer look reveals 
a rich pattern of connections. More than any other type of human inquiry, philosophy helps make us self-aware of critical assumptions we tacitly 
incorporate in our organizational theorizing; it creates a deeper awareness of the "unconscious metaphysics" underpinning our efforts to understand 
organizations.
