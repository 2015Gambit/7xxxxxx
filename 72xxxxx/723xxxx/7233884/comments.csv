13kb/s here"
,bagelhunt,2012-05-02T07:03Z,"You're telling me to be grateful it's free? I don't have to download from this shitty public tracker. If not for the mostly retarded seed point system on the private tracker I use I wouldn't be here for 99% of you faggots to free leech off of. 

If you're going to bitch about how there's ""only a few seeders"" maybe those seeders should, hmm, you know. 

SEED"
,Leapus,2012-05-02T07:22Z,SEED I'm at 2h:35m and only 4.1% downloaded. The more people that seed the faster everyone downloads. Help the community. 
,bannoura,2012-05-02T07:38Z,"iam gonna run this all night, after i finish downloading, it will seed all day tomorrow as well, enjoy :)"
,Squall_L,2012-05-02T07:50Z,Only thing left to do is for someone to do a Windows XP Patch for this game so that I and many people can play. *.*

,joshfb,2012-05-02T11:15Z,"what does this torrent contain, i just downloaded skidrows and all it gave me was the iso to the game.."

to all who are sayin to do an xp patch i feel sorry for you guys but i do hope there is a patch out other wise jus upgrade to win 7!!"
,Kamianbu,2012-05-02T13:36Z,"@bagelhunt

That Seed Point system on private trackers have a purpose to ensure that people like YOU don't just leech, you have to SEED as well.

And as at the moment, 250 seeders seeding it to 2300 people... Yes, it's probably going to be slow.

Why? Cause the internet ain't all filled with rainbows and frilly colors. Things take time and the more that download 1 thing, the longer it takes.

And yes, you should stop your bitching. Why? This is free and if you don't like the speed...

Go buy it instead and then bitch to the cashier on how long it's taking him/her to ring it up and see what that gets ya."
