Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, May 1 edition of the Alex Jones Show, talks with political scientist Joel Skousen in-studio. Mr. Skousen will delve into the history of May Day and expose its roots in communism. He is the founder and chief editor of World Affairs Brief, a weekly news-analysis service. He has authored several books, including Strategic Relocation: North American Guide To Safe Places, now available at the Infowars Store. 

Alex also talks with Peter Glidden, a doctor of Naturopathic medicine. Mr. Glidden is an outspoken advocate of wholistic health. He has lectured to thousands of people over the last two decades and is a regular speaker at Health Freedom Expo and Youngevity regional meetings. Glidden is the author of The MD Emperor Has No Clothes, a book that describes how society is on the verge of a health care meltdown.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
