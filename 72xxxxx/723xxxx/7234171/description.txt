This is definitely not folk music for the faint of heart, but itΓÇÖs heaven for fans of gothic Americana. Tim Eriksen is one of the worldΓÇÖs more fearless performers: long admired as a singer, steeped in Americana and particularly the eerie northern New England tradition, the multi-instrumentalist is no stranger to singing a-cappella. WhatΓÇÖs most impressive is how this album was made: Eriksen sang all fourteen songs solo with neither band nor instrumentation, in a single take, in a tower along the wall of the Benedictine Abbey in Jaroslaw, Poland. His slightly twangy baritone is a potent instrument, but he doesnΓÇÖt overdo it: this is an album of interpretations, a voice alone setting and maintaining a mood with the lyrics. Yet it also doesnΓÇÖt offer the impression that heΓÇÖs holding anything in reserve, waiting til the end when he knows he can empty the tank and blow out his voice if he wants. And what technique! Eriksen is pitch-perfect, working those blue notes with a sorcererΓÇÖs subtlety. Tenacity in the face of hardship, mourning and even gruesomeness is the feeling that links most of the often centuries-old songs here: many of them, even a hymn like Son of God, are absolutely macabre. Most of them are in minor keys; and to EriksenΓÇÖs credit, he doesnΓÇÖt sing them all in the same key. The tension lets up a little at the end of the English folk song Gallows Tree, where the prisoner at the end of the rope is finally rescued as the hangman is paid his bribe (for another, absolutely lights-out solo vocal performance of this song, check out the version on Robin OΓÇÖBrienΓÇÖs album The Apple in Man).

By contrast, Eriksen gives the narrator of Drowsy Sleeper ΓÇô dying of food poisoning ΓÇô a chance to make a forceful last stand. He works segues between several of the songs so seamlessly that itΓÇÖs hard to tell when one ends and another begins. A couple of them are traditionally sung by women, but Eriksen pulls them off, notably the ominously gleeful A Soldier Traveling from the North, where the girl begs the traveling soldier not to leave (the implication is that sheΓÇÖs pregnant). Eriksen recasts Amazing Grace as rustic Appalachian folk, and finally lets the clouds dissipate with a rousing, revival camp-style version of Better Days Coming to end the album. This ought to appeal to a wide audience, from fans of groups like the Handsome Family to otherworldly Balkan-Applachian singers
