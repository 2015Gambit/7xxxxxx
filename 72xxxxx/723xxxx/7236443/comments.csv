,buggaton,2012-05-03T01:13Z,Only been up for 15 minutes and I'm already getting 150kb/s DL.  As this is a reasonably obscure show as far as torrents go I would recommend people seed this as much as they can (I aim for a ratio of 5+) to get more people watching it so we can have quicker and better uploads and seeds!
,GrandiaKnight,2012-05-03T11:10Z,Anyone else having problems with the sound on this torrent? I get to certain point and the sound goes choppy no matter what player I play it in.
,flashasaurus,2012-05-03T12:46Z,"audio becomes incomprehensible aroun 11min 10 second mark, only briefly, but you miss some pretty important dialogue"
,buggaton,2012-05-03T14:05Z,"yep, same here.  there's a 30 second chunk of this episode that is properly choppy due to bad recording :("
,uncletufty6,2012-05-04T15:23Z,"I have to agree with other comments, at one point its as if its gone into fast foward mode, the video and audio speed up to the point where its impossible to understand.
Wait for a better copy."
