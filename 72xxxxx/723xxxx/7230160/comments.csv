,icepax,2012-05-24T17:10Z,@TakSlak: It takes about 6 minutes... Seven if you have a slow computer. :)
,TakSlak,2012-05-24T17:30Z,"Thanx alot @icepax. Also, I had some trouble with Odin. But I changed the order of the steps given and that seemed to have sorted out the problem.

FYI Here is the sequence of the steps that worked for me:
4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6, 7."
,icepax,2012-05-25T06:45Z,"@TakSlak: Sorry, mate. Glad you figure out the sequence. :)

Hope one day soon I can edit my torrents. Currently, this feature has been removed from TBP."

The tablet is not from samsung, its small company i just bought it for fun and trying out android. Or if someone can help me to find out a standard ICS 4.0 which will work on a tab.... Currently i am running 2.2 on this tab; can any one suggest how to upgrade if this is not the correct way of doing it?"
