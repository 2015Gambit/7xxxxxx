In the early 70s as the UK got to grips with the new coinage and decimalisation and braced itself for strike after strike, a group of young troubadours were hanging out in Laurel Canyon and the environs of California USA having a ball and creating music that would define a generation. In this third programme from the Sounds of 70s series it's time to kick back and relax and enjoy performances from the long hairs: Crosby and Nash, Neil Young, America, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Carole King, Eagles and Seals and Crofts.
