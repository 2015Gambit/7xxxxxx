RR 14. Violet vs MC - G1 MC PoV is the same file of G3 (missing actual G1 MC PoV).

Any chance you could upload more PoV videos? FLV is okay if converting to mkv takes up your time. Here's some requests:

Round Robin:
03. DongRaeGu vs MC (both pov)
15. DongRaeGu vs Parting (both pov)
19. MarineKing vs MC (MC pov)
20. Parting vs Ganzi (parting pov)
22. Parting vs Violet (parting pov)

Bracket Round 1:
MC vs DRG (DRG pov)

Bracket Semifinal B:
Ganzi vs DRG (DRG pov)

Final: MKP vs DRG (DRG pov)"
,cfrank,2012-05-13T08:12Z,"Thanks, lysergic1. Indeed, I like the quality MLG puts up, just not the format. Also, they often split replays in two parts. The only way I know to make them one file is to convert them to mkv (lossless) and then use mkvmerge to join them.

PoVs are cool. I was thinking of uploading them. Yet they're almost as large as the replays. That would lead to an 80GB archive, kinda got me scared :) I'll try and put them up as well, but Spring Arena 2 is coming on the 18th, I'll be busy :)

Cheers!"
,lysergic1,2012-05-22T23:47Z,"will you be uploading a spring arena 2 torrent soon?

doesn't converting FLV/MP4 to MKV make the file larger and slightly reduce the quality? what's the point?"
,cfrank,2012-05-23T09:44Z,"@lysergic1: I'll be uploading Spring Arena 2 as soon as I download the VoDs. That's what takes most of my time. I use a script for conversion so it doesn't take long. 

I don't reencode the video/audio when converting, I just change the container, so there's no loss of quality, the video is exactly the same. The MKV files come out slightly smaller than the FLV files.

There are several reasons behind this conversion, among which the fact that not all players support FLVs, especially if you watch it on a media streamer on you big plasma TV, like I do. FLV does not allow for easy seek within the file. Also, I like stitching together multipart games in one file, I've no idea if that's possible with FLV files.

Stay tuned for the latest Spring Arena 2 guys! And please seed! I'm the only one seeding right now, not fair..."
