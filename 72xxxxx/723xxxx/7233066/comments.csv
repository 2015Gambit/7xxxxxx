Your welcome. I'm glad you like the sound of them.

Please ensure you seed everybody, even if you just seed for 1 round. Thanks.

I'll be uploading ""Violator"" by ""Depeche Mode"" next.

You're welcome."
,]eep,2012-05-04T02:17Z,"I checked it: sound is excellent. It goes beyond 20kHz too. Not many rereleases do.
The DM does not, but sounds way better than cd (I have the SACD-ISO's).

Thank you for your effort. HD >24/88 sounds awesome. 

Hoping to see more like this!"

You're very welcome.

I'll be uploading more when I have more time.

Next will be ""The Dark Side Of The Moon"" by ""Pink Floyd""."
