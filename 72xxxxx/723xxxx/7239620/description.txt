Are you craving a way to eat killer food without killing yourself, animals, or the planet? Is your brain bloated from watching cooking shows that present recipes youΓÇÖre never, ever going to make? Have you been searching for a way to prove to your friends that vegan food can be just as delicious, hearty, and satisfying as the meaty meals theyΓÇÖre accustomed to? Then this is the book for you.

Of his journey from watching food porn on his parentsΓÇÖ couch to cooking in Hollywood kitchens to becoming vegan, author Brian Patton writes:

My roommate said he didnΓÇÖt know what made me a bigger loser: that I was painstakingly preserving episodes of 30 Minute Meals or that I was trying to conceal their existence by labeling them Star Trek....Once I discovered that I could not only survive but thrive without taking the life of another being, I was sold. I was a vegan. For good.

And thatΓÇÖs how an ΓÇ£ordinary dudeΓÇ¥ became the Sexy Vegan and started creating ΓÇ£extraordinary foodΓÇ¥ with a decidedly real-meal appeal. On every page, Brian proves that seriously good food neednΓÇÖt be too serious.
