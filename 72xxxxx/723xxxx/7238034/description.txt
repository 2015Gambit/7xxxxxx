SEED, SEED, SEED
As my upload speed is only 100kb/s maximum I rely on others re-seeding it once its up so I can put up all the other seasons.

Once a season has enough other people seeding it to stay alive I will then upload the next season.

Okay here is season 3

Now these are DVD rips that I downloaded from a Newsgroup originally 576 x 432 which was probably the originally transmitted 4x3 format.

I trimmed 30 pixels off the top and 60 of the bottom and resized them to 720 X 412
So they look and play quite nicely on current wide screen TV,s .
