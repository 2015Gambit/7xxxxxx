,Darkdragontc,2012-05-03T16:34Z,"The Keygen/patch doesn't work, the program won't even open, i did this many times to make sure of it.

You need to get the latest keygen/patch for it, so it's fixed up."
[T],Ching_Liu,2012-05-03T22:06Z,@Darkdragontc - This is 64 bit and XP is not supported anymore.
,NeonCross,2012-05-03T22:31Z,Thank you Ching_Liu! :D
,Darkdragontc,2012-05-04T16:19Z,"I'm not using XP, using windows 7 64 and i did follow the read me and for some reason it won't open after everything i done.

And i did even a clean install. (In meaning uninstall the lastest build which was 5**) and install the newest version.

and it won't open up after that. So either i'm missing something or there is something i'm not seeing lol."
,Darkdragontc,2012-05-04T16:31Z,"Found out the problem , it's good now , thank you again LOL."
,jgwJGWii,2012-05-06T22:38Z,"IF PATCH FAILS

I sometimes have brain cramps and forget to run Keygen as Administrator. This always makes the Patch step fail for me. So, just a reminder that if the patch is failing, RUN KEYGEN AS ADMINISTRATOR. :)"
,Ejilol,2012-05-07T10:40Z,"For the life of me, i can't render on any setting with my gpu. Is the GTX 680 not working with this build? Rendering with cpu only is killing me."

,ryannayr140,2012-05-20T00:37Z,It worked but whenever I import a video file sony vegas pro 11 crashes.  I installed this 64 bit version on my windows 7 64 bit system.  Can anyone help?
,ryannayr140,2012-05-20T00:39Z,Update from previous comment:  actually it is just .mp4 files that have an issue.  
,ryannayr140,2012-05-20T00:41Z,When I try to import a .mp4 file it crashes.  Can someone help?
,Bennemann,2012-05-25T04:15Z,"I already had this installed and working before but removed it for some reason I can't remember, I tried reinstalling it following the same instructions, but it will not accept my final activation code. When I click the ""Register Vegas Pro.htm"" file, I can see in the URL the Machine ID and serials used but I cannot insert those to the keygen so that it gives me the correct activation code. It seems to have the serial and shit from the original installation stored away on some data file. I want to delete it but I cannot find it. Does anybody know where it would be?"
,Daeshan,2012-05-25T08:11Z,"why do people say ""seeeeeed"" or ""need seeds"" when they never give their IP address, let alone their skype, or some bullshit to hack their ip through?...

(see what i did there)"
,goodeye64,2012-05-29T02:13Z,I found that the instructions seemed to be slightly wrong. If youre having problems on the keygen use the 'Vegas Pro 11.0 (64 bit) Series' setting rather than the one the instructions says
,flarehl,2012-06-10T04:23Z,"Just gonna point out that the title should be build 382, not 383. Typo? "
,rob90991,2012-06-14T13:01Z,if your gonna use this 64bit version your gonna need to have 64bit video codecs installed to open video files. Better just use the 32bit version and save the hassle
[T],Ching_Liu,2012-06-15T08:31Z,"@flarehl - It is ok,  11.0.683 for 64 bit  -  11.0.682 for 32 bit. "
,C0MMANDAH,2012-06-16T04:59Z,"Alright, here's my issue- Vegas is crashing when it starts. Yes, I ran EVERYTHING as an admin. I had some stuff open in the background but I highly doubt that would effect installation, as my computer is pretty good. The patch worked and it installed and registered perfectly. Is there something keygen and stuff to do that I could undergo to fix it, and would it be safe to contact Sony to see what's up with my Vegas?"
,C0MMANDAH,2012-06-16T05:04Z,"Oh, info I forgot to post that may be useful:

Gateway NV55C Laptop
Intel i3 Dual Core total 4GB RAM 4.2 GHz
OS Windows 7 Professional SP1 64 Bit

Vegas is crashing when it says it is creating file I/O manager. My computer's sound mixer has been fritzing recently, which could be the cause of my issues but i'm not sure."
,boyznacne,2012-06-27T04:49Z,Works flawlessly!. Big thanks to the uploader. Much appreciated!
,skinnylee11111,2012-06-29T23:55Z,Does not work. Server cannot complete registration process. Authentication code (from the keygen) is always invalid.
,skinnylee11111,2012-06-30T00:06Z,And I did select the correct program version in the keygen.
,C1hrisin,2012-07-01T18:50Z,"Amazing worked fine thanks
- Don't forget ALWAYS RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR"
,f0xz,2012-07-04T01:25Z,"dont work for me, i install when i apply the patch say error dont know why any sugestions?"
,sapa2ler,2012-07-11T15:05Z,Learn to crack first!!!! Then only download torrents!!!!
,Kingsdown,2012-07-12T21:59Z,"Well I followed all the instructions, but when I try to patch it makes me select the place i want to patch then it makes me select the plugins installation... and every time it fails. I've tried just using the activation code and it says its invalid."
,cybersteel8,2012-07-13T07:34Z,"Thanks heaps. Fast download, and works great if you follow the instructions exactly! Remember - run the keygen with admin privileges and in case you were wondering, the install directory is in your C:Program FilesSony and your shared plugins directory is in C:Program Files (x86)Sony

Thanks and good luck!"
,Lireal,2012-07-16T17:36Z,"Vegas Pro 11 REQUIRES Quicktime 7 to be installed. If you are having a crash at startup right after installing, make sure you have Quicktime 7 installed. Will fix it right up. Found this fix while digging through forums. It worked for me."
,ryansox,2012-07-25T23:07Z,"Ok so I followed all of the instructions. When I click patch in the keygen it asks for instillation file and then shared plugin file locations I click on those and it gave me a patch failed error.

Anyone know how to fix?"
,facepalmm,2012-07-29T01:46Z,"Every time I'm about to finish registering, I click finish, and it says there's an error for no apparent reason, then I put in the authorization code and it doesn't do anything! Anybody know why/how to fix this?"
,xny675,2012-08-24T05:32Z,"Works great.  

You have to remove any other installed version for this to work, though [as with previous releases of SV11].  You can't install this side-by-side with the 32-bit version, for instance.

This version works WAY faster on my system than previous V11 releases.  Lots of small fixes to GPU support et al but the GPU rendering blue or green frames bug is still there.  Two fixes for that: either disable the GPU in the main preferences and rely on CPU only rendering, or only use 8-bit mode in the project preferences.

If you're struggling with the stabilizer plugin, that will also only work in 8-bit mode - you can switch to it, run the stabilizer, then switch back to 32-bit.

Thank you for seeding, Ching Liu."
,xny675,2012-08-24T05:36Z,"Also: 

Yes, all versions of Vegas require a version of Quicktime to be installed.  If you don't want Apple's destructive installer pwning your machine, download Quicktime Alternative or Quicktime Lite from free-codecs.org.

For other codecs [such as XVID] ffdshow x64 works quite well and reliably.  "
,bbdgamer,2012-08-29T00:36Z,Norton found a trojan in the keygen...
,yusszx,2012-09-02T17:38Z,"after you reach instruction no.8, put fake name & email, click next, select this directory, ""C:Program Files (x86)Sony"", click ok."
,madlibyio,2012-09-19T07:06Z,"Patch fails me: admin rights check, sony file check, patch loading queue...error message. "
