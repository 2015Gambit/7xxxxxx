ΓÇ£FisherΓÇÖs first novelΓÇöfirst of many, I hopeΓÇöis both sweet and savory, built on the foundations of a quirky Texas town that feels like itΓÇÖs always been hiding out there in the desert, woven through with genuinely clever storytelling. The story unfolds like a tale told on a wraparound porch to the clink of iced tea glasses. Fisher creates a world where angels and demons are as delightfully believable as the perfect peach pie, and IΓÇÖm eagerly looking forward to the next slice.ΓÇ¥ (Dianne Sylvan, author of The Shadow World series)

Empathic pie baker Gracey Daylittle has lived a quiet life in the desert of Love & War, Texas, for ten years. But when she and her sister unwittingly rescue an insatiable Japanese demon from the side of the road, her world descends into a maelstrom of mythic chaos that threatens to destroy her town and the foundations sheΓÇÖs built her life upon.

A delicious fusion of Mexican and Japanese mythologies, the first book in the Love & War series is sure to delight urban fantasy and magical realism fans everywhere.
