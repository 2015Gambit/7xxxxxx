Story (IMDB)

Favraux, an unscrupulous banker, receives a threatening note, signed
by "Judex", demanding that he pay back the people he has swindled. He
refuses, and apparently dies after a midnight toast at his masked
ball. However, he is only drugged by Judex and locked away. Judex
spares his life when the banker's widowed daughter, Jacqueline,
rejects the inheritance. Meanwhile Diana Monti, the former governess,
kidnaps Jacqueline to try to get the banker's money. But Judex is hot
on her trail.  (Will Gilbert)
