Future Weapons Season 3
Mack goes the extra mile to track down the new weapons and defense systems taking their place in the world's arsenal to deal with the changing missions of 21st-century warfare. There's still plenty of firepower, but you'll get an inside look at many of the breakthrough technologies designed to take on the challenges of terrorism, bomb threats, and close combat urban battlefields.



5)  Guns 
Future Weapons goes big on guns starting with the rapid-fire cannon that are fast becoming a huge hit with the U.S. armed forces. Next up, Mack takes a helicopter ride where he unleashes a firestorm with the lightweight Dillon Aero Gatling gun. On an Arizona firing range, he tests a new multi-calibre combat weapon that's lighter and tougher than any other weapon in its class. In the finale, Mack checks out a new breed of personal defence weapons that have the stopping power -- and amazingly, the accuracy -- of much bigger weapons.
