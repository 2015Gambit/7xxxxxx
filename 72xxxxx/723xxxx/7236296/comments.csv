,lee.mabar,2012-06-30T21:55Z,"hi velvet.

i've made some mistakes categorising my torrents. 

I've put my music albums in the audiobook category without knowing, because the translation in portuguese made me do the mistake. 

In portuguese is written 'audiocd' that make me understand full CD, and music, made me wrongly understand some kinda single music. 

Sorry. 

You have already modified one of my torrents, that i've put in audio>audiocd to audio>other [http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7262037/Ed_Motta_-_2__amp_eacute__Demais_%281996%29]. 

So, can you help me with the other torrents i have that i've made the same mistake? 

Got to put them all to audio>music, and the audio>other one. Can you do that for me please? 

I thought i will help, but in the search people cant find my stuff, so sad. 

Thanks a lot from brazil, 
Lee Mabar.  "

,citizend,2012-07-23T10:11Z,"Hi Velvet, sorry to be off topic but I don't know how else to contact you. You just deleted a duplicate torrent I uploaded yesterday, leaving a scolding note. Well, I tried to delete it myself, because I made a mistake on the first attempt, but the delete function didn't work. I get a pop-up confirmation window, and when I answer ""yes"", nothing happens. I've tried to delete my old obsolete torrents, but the delete function never works. Perhaps you can inform the tech staff. I don't know how."

,huwazad,2012-09-02T17:34Z,I need to delete this torrent to re-upload it. You deleted my most recent upload. I don't why didn't u remove the old one and how it did come to your mind that I re-upload it due to a mistake as I was advised in the piratebay email. I tried to delete it but it won't delete...and there is no other way to contact you or rename the torrent to set it up for deletion.  Please delete the following: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7588481/Medical_Biochemistry_The_Big_Picture_2012_epub
