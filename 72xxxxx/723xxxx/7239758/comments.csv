,3htthe,2012-05-06T00:11Z,How did you make it only 5 gbs?
,BlackandBad,2012-05-13T06:08Z,"MP4 are smaller than avi thats why, how's the quality ? i already have all of these but they were all C_P rips.... 480P 720P ??? please let me know :)

thanks for every upload"
,anishrestha,2012-05-13T08:31Z,"Its already mentioned Its a 640*480 video, not 480p as it is not widescreen, what matters is bitrate and I think its fine~550(regarding the video resolution). It's near DVD quality. I dunt think there is a Widescreen version of this series, however i head somewhere that folks were doing frame by frame recreation of the sides to make it widescreen, dont know the truth though"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-13T15:18Z,"it is 480p, avatar was release in 4:3 instead of 16:9"

Where did you hear such? Doing that would be very very tedious and time consuming and not mention hard since you need to create artwork, and if doing it frame by frame, it would take ages just to do 1 episode, nevermind 61 episodes."
