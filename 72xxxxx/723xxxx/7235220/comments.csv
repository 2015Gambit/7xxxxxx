spastik64 DID NOT TAKE CAP CREDITS..in fact, spastic included the scene releaes group's name,""2HD"", followed by the name of the person or group (in [ ] brackets) who uploaded the torrent to tpb. This is the norm. YOU also do not know where spastik obtained the file...maybe magzcrib/tellymad, rlslog, rlsbb, ftp, usenet, newgroups, or other. "
,notinmontreal,2012-05-03T23:18Z,"my, my children....just say thank you and get on with life...it is excellent that people take the time to upload"
