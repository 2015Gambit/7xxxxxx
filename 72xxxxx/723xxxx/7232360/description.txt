BloodRayne is a 2002 third-person action-adventure video game and the first game in the BloodRayne series. In addition to a sequel, BloodRayne 2, Bloodrayne inspired a series of films and self-contained comic books. It was developed by Terminal Reality, and was strongly influenced by their previous game Nocturne.

The PC Emulator is already set for this game, just copy the PCSX2 folder over to your My Documents folder and run the pcsx2-r4600.exe; setup your gamepad using the LilyPad plugin. If you already have PCSX2 on your PC, use the Config Pix I have provided.

I have tested this on 2 PCs, 1 using a 19inch monitor, and 1 with 52inch LCTV, both worked perfectly with very nice graphics.
