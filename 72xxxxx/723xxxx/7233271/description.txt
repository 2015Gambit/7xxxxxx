Jonathan Hayes - Edward Jenner series (Thriller)  

Precious Blood (2007)
 (The first book in the Edward Jenner series)
 
 
New York City medical examiner Edward Jenner thought he'd gotten out, turning his back on forensicsΓÇöand lifeΓÇöafter the nightmare of September 11. But when a young student is found murdered, her mutilated body hanging on the wall of an East Village apartment, Jenner is forced out of retirement. One look at the victim and Jenner is sure there's a serial killer on the looseΓÇöa hunch confirmed when he uncovers a second horrific murder. And when a friend asks him to look after a beautiful girl threatened by the killer, Jenner can't refuse.
 
Dragged back onto the dark streets of New York City, Jenner is pushed to the limits of his physical endurance, pitting his sharpest intuitions against the elusive maneuverings of a psychopath. He's getting within inches of the answer, but the clock is ticking and the killer is just too fastΓÇöten steps ahead of the police, two steps ahead of Jenner, and always just out of reach.
 
As the killings continue, Jenner's desperate chase brings him ever closer to the man behind the grisliest murders he's ever seenΓÇöand only one of them can survive.
 
This is real-world forensic investigation, where fingerprints lead nowhere, DNA doesn't help, and serial killers aren't always caught in the nick of time. . . .

As a criminal pathologist, Dr Edward Jenner has seen many bad deaths in his day, but none as crazed as the ritual slayings perpetrated by Robert Farrar, The Inquisitor. He survived the final denouement of Farrar's killing spree, but not the fall-out from the authorities which saw his medical license suspended and him banished from New York.
