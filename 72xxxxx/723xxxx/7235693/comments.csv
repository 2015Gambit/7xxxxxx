,Gingasnapz,2012-05-08T07:27Z,the name of the show is dead talk?

,Frater88,2012-05-09T23:29Z,Thanks. I'm keen 
[V],psspss,2012-05-12T17:24Z,"nope when I search for a collection its
the intense.. so if missing episodes none
could be found any where..

voodoo is kinda boring I would of though..

and clairvoyance.. hmmm..

the best were the poltergeist ghost hunting
and dead talk episodes"
