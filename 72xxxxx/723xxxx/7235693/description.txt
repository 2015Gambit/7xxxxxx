Heres another paranormal series from UK I spent days sourcing what
I could find on the web and re-edited them cropping and enhencing
as best I could with the limited web streams
if you have better copies or 3 of the missing episodes then
let me know or share on demon/tpb to complete :)
1 has russian voice over which is annoying I had hoped
I could find a subtitles file so could turn down the volume and read
screen instead but no joy but if you listen hard you can hear
the people talking english in the background .. better then nothing!

covers tops from UFOS, Aliens to Ghosts and tarot cards

help to seed if grabbing! its over 5gb !@ and will take ages to
seed out.. stop with the hit and runs too.. if you want the other
shows Ive yet to share still you best to help seed this and
previous shows

the quality is medium quality some pixelizing.. but its watchable
on laptop its not too bad and seems interesting watch

enjoy

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
===================================
Ps/3 , phone and xbox users may consider grabbing
the free tool umile encoder 3.1.1.2 it can convert
to most devices to make compatible in 8mins
on dual core or higher. as some of my converts may
fail for certain devices.. you will need a pc to run it
though. no link just google it..
