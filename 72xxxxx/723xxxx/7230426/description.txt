Trevor McDonald: Mighty Mississippi 
Trevor McDonald embarks on an epic 2,000 mile journey along the great Mississippi River to discover why it is the most important river in the United States. His journey begins in the Gulf of Mexico where the river flows into the sea, and ends at the river's source near the Canadian Border. Throughout his voyage, Trevor uncovers how the river has helped define America. In the Deep South he sees how the legacy of slavery still affects life along the river today and witnesses a colourful Jazz funeral in New Orleans. In Memphis, Trevor meets Rev. Kyles who was standing beside Dr Martin Luther King when he was assassinated. He visits Hollywood star Morgan Freeman who reveals why he returned to his roots in Mississippi after forty years away. And Trevor's in for a surprise when he reaches his ultimate destination, the source of the Mississippi River.



3)  St Louis 
The final leg of the broadcaster's journey sees him in St Louis, Missouri, on Independence Day, where he meets one of the country's richest baseball teams. On an island in the Mississippi he visits a weapons factory that has made guns for every conflict the US has ever fought in, before getting behind the wheel of a paddle steamer in Hannibal, the home town of Huckleberry Finn author Mark Twain. Trevor's next stop is Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he discovers business is booming at the enormous Mall of America, and a surprise awaits him as he reaches his ultimate destination - the source of the Mississippi River.
