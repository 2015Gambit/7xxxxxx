Ten Popes Who Shook The World (2007-10-22 - 2007-11-02)

Professor Eamon Duffy presents a series on ten great pontiffs.

For nearly 2,000 years, the Catholic Church has turned to the Pope in Rome for spiritual leadership. From the remains of the Roman Empire, through the Renaissance and into the modern era, the papal office has played a central role in the history of Europe and the wider world. Popes throughout the ages have had to deal with political crises, from Attila the Hun to Adolf Hitler, while shouldering the spiritual burden that comes with the throne of St Peter. 

In this new series for BBC Radio 4, Professor Eamon Duffy profiles 10 men who have led what is arguably the most powerful institution in history ΓÇô the papacy. Each of the 10, he argues, helped shape the world today. Starting with St Peter and ending with Pope John Paul II, Professor Duffy explores what we know of the characters who have held that office, and asks which of them has made the greatest mark on history. 

Father Robert King, the University of Bristol Chaplain, listened to the first programme. He said, "The first episode sets the standard for what promises to be an impressive series reflecting on the influence of great popes through the course of history. Eamon Duffy's genius is for making Church history accessible and I look forward to following the series."
