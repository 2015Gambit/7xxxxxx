Ok mate.. for the sake of your hate, i will stop uploading NBA games on this site.. I'm not trying to be a hero, I have just found this one site the releases fast NBA torrents and i thought its good to share it here.

And I have just thought that you are creating your own torrents and not copy-paste the same as what I am doing..

Cheers mate.. I hope you feel better now.. "

I thought you are a friend. But you came over me with your frustration. Why I think that? Because you have uploaded all the torrents you could find. And I mean all of it. And don't pretend like you didn't knew where did my torrents came from, when I have mentioned the credits! And we are not the same, I have put some work in theseuploads, not just copy-paste. Anyway, I will do the same as before. I'll let you do what you want to do and I'll move on. I don't need your mercy. I'm not a child. But I think that, friends or not, we need to show some respect. Don't you? And without pretending that we are telling the truth when we actually don't. Good luck and respect, mate!"
