well at least they used a thermal in this one.. perhaps mr josh
gates gave them some pointers

they caught something but man why didnt he keep the
darn thing stable

very hard to see the darn shadow they saw on deck
might of help if they had a full spectrum and thermal in their
hand for that one.. but didnt.. sigh

even being a mp4 didnt help seeing it clearly :D"
,sweetchuk,2012-05-03T14:40Z,"psspss, spam up your own upload for all your worth, but try to help yourself on other people's torrents.
Bad enough you claim ownership of tNe's torrents in Demonoid without proper recognition or mention of tNe in the descriptions - keep his uploads here free of your 'advertising'.

tNe, many thanks again for your superior and much appreciated efforts"
[V],psspss,2012-05-03T17:44Z,"lol idiot...

some of you people need to grow up

tne is meantioned in the descriptions on all converts.. cant you read.. chunk

im not here for egos.. just providing good torrents and shows not available.. if you dsont want more ghosts shows then you can miss out

i dotn see how you claim spam.. tne also posts to my stuff.. i call it informing

nob"
[T],trialNerror,2012-05-03T20:56Z,"lol pss talkin about egos again

i saw the shadow on the flight deck; watched this on a 42"" lcd.  it's there about middle of the plane's wing then drifts to the left and vanishes. not a great vid clip since adam was standing probably 200 feet away with the camera.

but there's no effing way you can miss that thermal clip j & g got below deck of the being leaning against the wall, standing up and walking to the right.

uss yorktown has some serious activity"
[V],psspss,2012-05-04T00:57Z,"yes the thermal was good ruined by
their sloppy handling though
GA would of done it better even enhanced
the footage to make it clearer

yeh teeny egos of some people tne

all this hating gains nothing.. 

whats funny some nob comment on demon
dfor a ext torrent torrent to your mp4
you were seeding not me.. of not
giving you credit LOL"
,sweetchuk,2012-05-04T01:37Z,"psspss it's not about hating, but any look at any of tNe's torrents you poach and upload to 'Noid shows only his tNe nick at the end of the torrent name - huge.
There is NO acknowledgement in the description at all for tNe's original work, no matter what way you wanna slice it.

You go on insulting people all you want - it'll win you few friends and although you do upload some nice stuff from time to time, you'll always be a follower to the true uppers like tNE.

Seriously, if tNe hasn't got a problem with you parasiting his comments of his torrents, or from nearly all appearances, leeching hiss stuff then upping them under your ownership on other sites, then fine.
But by doing so, have you ever stopped to think that maybe if other people are calling you on it, which they are, then perhaps it's you who is the nob? "
[V],psspss,2012-05-04T16:04Z,"never ends does it
no point in me commenting further.. on this no sense
i think your find i have a big following not that I asked for them.. i find and fix many rare and missing episodes and I dont need thanks and recognition and tags on any on it.. I know many of my files get reupped to private trackers

i give tne not only thanks for his work.. im often the first and sometimes only one to thank him in his torrents. in the descriptions I say converted TNEs mp4 and ext torrents are left with his naming.. "
[V],psspss,2012-05-05T07:17Z,"serious TNE and other you should have a watch
of the dead talk in that torrent
ive upload.. so cool shit they
captured with evps.
each episode had stuff in it ive
heard for the first time

and yes I did rip them from the web
and spent days fitting them into
nice xvids. the quality isnt hd
but watchable and is enjoyable series"
