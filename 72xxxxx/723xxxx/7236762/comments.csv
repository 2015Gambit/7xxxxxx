,lilsean23,2012-05-03T13:03Z,"Thanks!!!
Please add Spanish Subs
Please!!!"
,justneustis,2012-05-03T13:15Z,Awesome job. Thanks for these.
,VladDj123,2012-05-03T15:38Z,"Hey man ! Nice torrents, love them. Seeded 90% of your uploads. Thanks a lot!!!
Also I would really apreciate if you could upload batman (the first 2 movies) ! Thx a lot"
[T],tr108,2012-05-03T19:30Z,"@whitee_rabbit - The Ocean's Trilogy probably won't happen. Sorry.

@lilsean23 - I hate to disappoint but I won't do subs for other languages. Everything about subs is too time consuming (making sure the timing is correct, whether it's a true translation or not, and finding/waiting for good ones to be available, or having to OCR them myself).

I ask that those who need other subs -- I've got requests for other languages, besides Spanish, on a different site -- add the SRT files themselves. You can use YAMB on a PC and Subler on a Mac, and there are google-able instructions. It's basically re-saving file -- NOT re-encoding -- so it takes very little time or CPU power. You just need (temporary) hard drive space.

@justneustis - you're very welcome. I'll call on you for encoding help when the time comes :)

@VladDj123 - If you mean Batman Begins & The Dark Knight, I will (hopefully) do those in July, before The Dark Knight Rises is in theaters."
,thefan23,2012-05-03T21:36Z,Thanks for all these movies. Excited to see the Avengers.
,portydert,2012-05-04T07:11Z,"Thanks for this...

My preference but I prefer the foreign language subs to be muxed in with the forced subs flag set to yes than hardcoded into the video :)"

,TacTic28,2012-05-04T11:38Z,"Hi tr108,

Love your work!!

Any chance of uploading the Alien Quadrilogy before Prometheus comes out please?
"
[T],tr108,2012-05-04T15:28Z,"@portydert - I would do that if forced sub tracks were supported by iTunes & Apple devices. Unfortunately, they're not.

@TicTac28 - I probably won't be able to do the Alien films :("
,arslanistic,2012-05-05T01:06Z,i want the 2 latest batman movies as well... its strange they dont have any decent torrents here...
,portydert,2012-05-05T01:16Z,"but if you can switch between normal & SDH subs with the remote (i think since you have embedded 2 sub tracks)

why not just embed the foreign language subs as the first sub track and the full SDH sub as the 2nd sub track?

if you have ATV set to displays subs, wont it automatically display the first sub track for the foreign language parts only when you play the movie?"
[T],tr108,2012-05-05T02:13Z,"@portydert - Not really a forced track, per se, but yes AppleTV & iTunes can be set to display a sub track by default, allowing you to set the BD's forced track as the first sub track. Sadly, I only know one person (offline, that is) whom I share movies with that chooses to do this besides me. Most of the other peeps I share movies offline with prefer to keep subs off, so it's up to them to know when to turn it on.

And there is no equivalent option for iPads, iPhones or iTouches (those only have default On/Off setting for closed captioning tracks, not subs).

So, it's just simpler for me to burn them in when it's an English film with a smattering of subs. (If this was, say, Pan's Labyrinth or Brotherhood of the Wolf, I wouldn't burn-in the subs)."
,portydert,2012-05-05T05:46Z,oh okay. i hope you dont take my comments the wrong way. i am totally appreciative of your work and if i came off as a jerk i do apologize...
,nextgenex,2012-05-07T10:40Z,"tr108, thanks for the uploads on all your offerings. As an educator from a underfunded school district, I rely on any of the media resources I can get. Whether they be popular movies with archetypical themes and symbols (such as this one) or current ebooks that our district doesn't purchase...thanks for making it available.  "
,PatrickDevaney,2012-05-10T15:53Z,Will you be uploading 'The Avengers' when it's released on iTunes?
[T],tr108,2012-05-11T02:42Z,"@portydert - I'm very picky myself (I hope that shows ;) ) so you're only asking the questions I'd be asking if our roles were reversed. No worries man. :)

@nextgenex - You're very welcome!

@PatrickDevaney - tho I wouldn't expect it for a few months, when The Avengers is made available online, I'll most def encode in 1080p & 720p"
,PatrickDevaney,2012-05-14T00:02Z,"You may have noticed, the selection of your uploads that have over one hundred seeds happen to be MarvelStudios, hopefully you follow the obvious pattern of public preference and upload the Spider-man trilogy....and then maybe move on to DC Comics :D Im sure alot of other TechRod Fans will agree with me :D Also may i request a the ability to subscribe to you, so i can set all your upcoming torrent to download automatically "
,hanamichi189,2012-06-01T08:32Z,Great torrent! Thanks
,bollotoral,2012-07-02T03:05Z,"so great to see you have added the subs!!

I personally prefer mkv but m4v is also an awesome format!! at last more and more people are leaving behind the avi format!

thanks!
