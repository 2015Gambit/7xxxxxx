"Planes, Train, and Cars"

The Dunphys are in the market for a new car 
and Phil makes a spontaneous purchase without 
Claire. Will he have buyer's remorse? 
Meanwhile, Jay is determined to get to his 
high school reunion with Gloria and Manny in 
tow, and Lily loses her favorite stuffed 
animal on a public metro train, leaving 
Mitch and Cam with an inconsolable toddler.
