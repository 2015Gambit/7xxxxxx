[V],Nepotu,2012-05-03T22:58Z,"You're welcome, my friends, mofo & Dimmis! I won't abandon you. I think that all we make a great family, rippers, uploaders and seeders. The same merit. Also, I'm sorry about Gondy. I didn't want to argue with him and upset him. He could do what he did but he should talk to me first, because both previously have been talking eachother. But I think that I made my point. He decided to turn his back on me/us instead to respect other's work of years. "
