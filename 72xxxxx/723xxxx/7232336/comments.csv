[V],Nepotu,2012-05-02T04:15Z,"You're welcome, mate!"
,baffled77,2012-05-02T05:12Z,Thanks Nepotu. My client is showing 0 seeds and only 10 peers total in swarm. Did something happen to this? I'm considering downloading the larger one since the swarm speed is higher.
,vinotauro,2012-05-03T11:11Z,This is great stuff mate. Pls can you make it into avi file?
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-03T23:07Z,"Well, I don't know! Depends on trackers, nods, seeders, I don't know.
@vinotauro: I can't because I'm not the ripper. But you can convert the file with some converting programs in what format do you like."
