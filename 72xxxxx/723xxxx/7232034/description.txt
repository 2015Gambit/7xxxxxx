Hi there

Here it is the very latest unofficial version of vlc media player 2.0.2 nightly build dated from :
March 27,2012
developed and based on Win32 exe only,however this version should work quite fine on Win64 edition also. 
Might not work in certain circumstances or more so.
untouched and delivered "as is" for personal testing purpose...
Use only at your own risk so.

full changelog is still unknown for this specific version anyway,sorry.

Note :
important tip

You must always Reset your VLC media player preferences and cache files before installing any new minor/major update/upgrade version anyway.
highly recommended and highly suggested anyway !!!
This should fix certain playback problems for certain users so.
(hopefully anyway...) 

Btw :
stop complaining as it is a free stuff because as far as i know this is not forbidden anyway and therefore it is a full legal torrent so ;)

enjoy and seed,please

regards
