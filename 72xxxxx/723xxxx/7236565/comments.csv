,Bennemann,2012-05-25T19:01Z,"I already had this installed and working before but removed it for some reason I can't remember, I tried reinstalling it following the same instructions, but it will not accept my final activation code. When I click the ""Register Vegas Pro.htm"" file, I can see in the URL the Machine ID and serials used but I cannot insert those to the keygen so that it gives me the correct activation code. It seems to have the serial and shit from the original installation stored away on some data file. I want to delete it but I cannot find it. Does anybody know where it would be?"
