,clh83,2012-05-07T01:20Z,"The usual dark cam (albeit watchable), French language dub, widescreen (640x264). 

A: 6 (French)
V: 6"

Oui Oui indeed."
,pierocha,2012-05-28T23:23Z,"Well, in case you didn't know, some people in the world speak other tongues than English !!! "
,siamthai,2012-06-05T21:45Z,"True, but it's always best to have original language (not dubbed) wih subtitles. So dubbing a movie will probably b e for people who are blind or o lazy to read (^_^)"
,mamayr,2012-06-15T15:23Z,is this cam version?
,Macbeth_0,2012-06-27T05:54Z,"Yeah I agree, dubbing movies should be prohibited, a LOT of people worked in the sound engineering, mix and other stuff, so dubbing is like shitting on those guys work!! (include English dubbed films too) "
,cagi994,2012-07-12T22:46Z,"A:0
V:0"
,...TPB...,2012-08-12T06:03Z,"So Macbeth, you want to get the movie for free - you don't want any laws stopping that - but you want to prohibit dubbing? What about you ripping off all those people that you care about so much by stealing this movie? Strange thinking. "
