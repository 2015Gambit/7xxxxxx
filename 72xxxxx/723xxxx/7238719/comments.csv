,p.m.t.,2012-07-25T19:38Z,"I have an error with this AI, but this one doesn't effect my existing PORTABLE Photoshop CS6.

My error is with this AI, after extract this works fine on first run (or second). But after that I'm getting an error message showing ""Configuration Error: Please reinstall or contact Adobe support"". The older AI CS5.5 worked fine for me. I got another release of portable AI-CS6-paf of 208MB. Both have same problem. Reinstall every time is the only solution :(
Please help me..."
,luisfsn,2012-07-26T17:47Z,"I could solve the errors in existing Adobe applications, after using this software. Just go in your folder and rename the folder c:Program FilesCommon FilesAdobe.Ilustrator.Portable to c:Program FilesCommon FilesAdobe"
,p.m.t.,2012-07-28T09:25Z,"SOLUTION!!!

While starting this Portable AI (IllustratorPortable.exe) all existing adobe directories are backup'd to 'Adobe.BackupByIllustratorPortable' on EACH current directories. So existing Adobe products may not run WHILE the Portable AI is running. On exit of Portable AI, the 'IllustratorPortable.exe' running in the backogroud will restore all backup'd files and folders by renaming 'Adobe.BackupByIllustratorPortable' to 'Adobe'. But this only happens if it was a safe-exit. Otherwise you have to to this ALL manually. Then only exisiting intallations will work. Even Adobe reader won't works when Portable AI is running!!

(Now I am analizing to merge the all 'Adobe' folder together to works on a fixed drive (Not on a USB) I will post here if it succeed."
,p.m.t.,2012-07-30T11:39Z,"Finally I fixed the error!!
Now it will not cause any error for existing Adobe products.
