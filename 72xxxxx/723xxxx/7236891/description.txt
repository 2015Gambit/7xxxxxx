Scrambler
a simple encryption app for the Mac

Instructions: Using Scrambler is simple. Just drag a file on ScramblerΓÇÖs icon in the menu bar, type a password, and encrypt. To decrypt, just drag the scrambled file back on Scrambler and type in the same password.

Terminal Decryption (Expert Users Only): To decrypt scrambled files in the Terminal, please follow these steps: On the Terminal, first run

echo -n "yourPassword" |openssl sha1

to obtain the SHA-1 hash of your password. Then run

openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in file.scrambled -out file.tar.gz

and paste in the hash when prompted for the password. Now you have a tar.gz archive that you can unarchive by double-clicking on it in the Finder.
