,JeffRelf,2012-05-02T00:30Z,"To play this .MP4 file using GOM Player 2.1.37.5085,
I had to uncheck, exit, relaunch, and recheck:

    Right-Click -> Preferences -> Filter [ a button ]
    -> Codec [ a tab ] -> [ all codecs ]

By the way, I updated to GOM 2.1.40.5106 [ April 19, 2012 ].
GOM 2.1.40.5106 plays this .MP4 file.

To avoid unwanted side affects ( from ""sponsors"" )
chose ""Custom Install"".
