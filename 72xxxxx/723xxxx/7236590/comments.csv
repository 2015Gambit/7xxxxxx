,TF746,2012-05-19T21:05Z,"Your torrents are the best on the web... Thank you for the effort... Just out of curiosity, what do you use to put the extra tags on movies, such as the rating and HD tag? Also, do you take requests?"
[T],tr108,2012-05-22T01:45Z,"@TF746 - I use Subler (Mac-only) to tag my videos. The Windows parallel -- at least for tagging, I'm told -- is MetaX."
[T],tr108,2012-05-22T01:46Z,And thanks for the kind words :)
