,simmer1234,2012-05-10T10:50Z,"This one is still not the complete collection.
It has the first issue upto December 1985.  In 1986, this one only has Mar, June, Sep, and Dec only.  Does anyone has the remaining issue.  I missed some of the issues in the late 80s and 90s that I owned but already thrown away when I moved."
,simmer1234,2012-05-10T10:53Z,"Anyway, this one is really nice torrent you're sharing.  Thank you so much, harmonfarms.  You're great.

Please upload more if you have. 

Anyone who has Compute! Can you please upload? Thanks."
,jim02762,2012-06-17T22:51Z,"These PDF's are apparently downsampled versions of ThumpNugget's and tosteve's scans (visit http://www.atariage.com/forums/topic/167235-byte-magazine/ ) along with Marcus B's scans which unfortunately must be re-scanned due to various errors but are usually better than nothing. (His scans have his name written in various spots on both covers.)

The full resolution PDF's would run about 34GB as nbrazil stated. However, after checking a few issues I am *very* impressed with the quality of these downsampled conversions. If you're tapped for disk space I'd recommend checking these out. (But this torrent should have a more descriptive name and should have had a README thrown into it!)

If you're interested in the full resolution scans that are available then visit the URL I gave above or wait a day or two and come back here. Making a torrent right now for them. Should basically be the same but full resolution and Marcus B's will be segregated but included until they can be replaced."
,jim02762,2012-06-23T23:14Z,"A full resolution torrent can be found at https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7380688 . It's 32.9GB so if disk space is tight use this 11GB torrent instead. The PDFs are smaller but look really, really good."
