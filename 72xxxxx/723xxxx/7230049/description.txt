Future Weapons Season 3
Mack goes the extra mile to track down the new weapons and defense systems taking their place in the world's arsenal to deal with the changing missions of 21st-century warfare. There's still plenty of firepower, but you'll get an inside look at many of the breakthrough technologies designed to take on the challenges of terrorism, bomb threats, and close combat urban battlefields.




3)  Close Protection 
First up is the top-secret scanning device that will stop terrorist attempts to smuggle liquid bombs and guns on to passenger jets. Next, Mack takes command of the newest rapid-fire naval gun as he tries to take out waterborne suicide bombers. Back on land, he wields the very latest security detail carbine when he goes head to head with the Roswell SWAT Team during an exercise to protect a VIP from assassins. Then he gets to test the newest remote-controlled weapons station for armoured personnel carriers.
