Notes
_____
Lets start off by saying this movie is a B rated movie.
The source was kinda sketchy to begin with, we resized and
adjusted levels as they were off. We also sharpened a little
and smoothed out. Not 2 much was done to this as its a dvdrip
but being low quality film we tried to adjust and sharpen it up
a little. Take it or leave it

No imdb or trailer found

Looking for cammers or suppliers who can bring unreleased movies/games/etc
