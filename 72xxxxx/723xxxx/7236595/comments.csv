,stuntpeo,2012-05-10T10:14Z,"Thanks everyone, hope you enjoy this one. It's my first feature, so it's goofy. Original title was Contour. Cost me five thousand bucks to make, and shot it over the course of a year after I graduated and was unemployed.

We're finishing the next one, a $100,000 film called Death Grip, which is releasing in June or so. That one's a real movie, I like to call it my Contour-killer :D

Oh and I'm happy you guys are pirating my movie. It's getting lots of views, and I'm not doing this for money. I'm certain some day I can still make a living off making films even if Pirate Bay exists.

Eric"
