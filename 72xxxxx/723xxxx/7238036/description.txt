Le Salaire de la Peur or The Wages of Fear (1953)

Director: Henri-Georges Clouzot.

Cast: Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck, Folco Lulli.

Two trucks. Four men. Enough nitrogylcerine to blow up South America. These are heady ingredients for any thriller, but the genius of Clouzot's downbeat stunner lies in its murky, masterful characterisation. He invests the first half in developing his quartet of desperate men, each willing to risk it all for a stack of oil company greenbacks, so that by the second, a nerve-ripping ride up mountain passes and through tortuous jungles, we're right there in the cab with them.



I have limited bandwidth. So be patient. You'll get it in the end.

Seed as much as you can & let everyone enjoy one of the greatest thrillers of all time.
