I got a 1080p, 8000kbps, 8gb filesize to crossreference frames with your upload... Your 4gb upload is 99% identical in quality as the 8gb I found.

I wish everyone knew this. I wish every uploader used your settings. Just wanted to thank you, techrod!"

Things will be quiet for about 10 days (sorry) but I'll be back with a vengeance..."

[T],tr108,2012-05-13T21:25Z,"@iclouds - yes, I'm gonna do ""The Grey"" when I'm back home but that means it probably won't be uploaded for at least 6 days (in case it matters)"
