,BostonAl2012,2012-04-22T15:47Z,Well what shows are they?  How bout some names instead of just your opinion?  :)
[V],psspss,2012-04-22T15:48Z,"ive added this re-edits too

collections Ive added before..

,BostonAl2012,2012-04-22T15:48Z,"Neat stuff though, all torrents/links"
[V],psspss,2012-04-22T15:51Z,"you click the files link and it tells you the names
of the torrent

sorry I havent any info on each of the files in torrent 

but they have been on web before 

i think i did some editing on these to improve them.. cant remember

the 3 in it

are 

Proof of Alien contact

Out of the Blue

and

The best kept secret or something like that

just keeping the info alive and spreading the word"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-04-23T06:54Z,"@rambo107 alot of ppl say their ""wackos"",they say the same about ppl that beleave in the spirit world.its all about proof & from what i've seen theres enough on both sides to make me beleave,not to mention what i've seen with my own two eyes.for all we know the aliens could be monitering the spirit world & dont even care about us....now THAT would make a good episode of Ancient Aliens"
[V],psspss,2012-04-23T13:05Z,"ok seems most have hit and run on this one

im seeding what I can again on this one.

i have made a new copy of out of blue
to fix the corruption of video at begging
and audio sync"
[V],psspss,2012-04-23T13:49Z,"im reseeding this torrent for people with one exception

i have not this file below.. as ive edited and fixed
the corruption at the beginning

so grab this new copy here
out of the blue - fixed
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7209385/UFOs_-_Out_of_the_Blue_-_THE_DEFINITIVE_INVESTIGATION_OF_THE_UFO

you still need to grab the other 2 great docus in this torrent

Proof of Alien contact
&
Greatest story ever denied

that has some interesting stuff about critters in it
thats not visible to human eye

I think they are a living creature.. if we cant see them
then we would see then dead either

or perhaps the dissolve in the sea or explode into bits
being gas creatures :)

wondering if these are mistaken as ghosts even :)"
,rasher78,2012-04-23T20:40Z,"Greatest story ever denied have already been uploaded here. I've seen Out of the blue 2002 documentary, got it of emule.

Not seen proof of alien contact."
,rasher78,2012-04-23T20:45Z,"I'm trying to get this file but it has no seeds. If anybody has it can they seed it?

[V],psspss,2012-04-24T02:01Z,"i did say in the title these are old ones that been about

however you will seen if search theres no well seeded

versions up any more and all are the same tvrips as well.. with the same video damage

would be good to find new sources of out of the blue and greatest story

hence why ive reposted them to keep the info alive..

theres prob 100 new ufo fans that have never seen the old docus and

Out of the blue clashes with movies with same title and confuses people if they seen it or not"
[V],psspss,2012-04-24T02:05Z,"i think that 2006 mexico one is same to what i posted on demon.. maybe I even made the avi from various sources.. cant remember now.
i know some grabbed of demon-od stuff and reshared here before I made an account and added stuff directly. so go to demon and search
i only share the best docus and videos not everything some are plain bad or nutty or not believable.. you want to show the best to new comers not everything :)"
