,Lanyus,2012-05-29T06:16Z,"Okay so, I never had issues with any torrent so far, games, movies, music, etc.
I'm far from a noob.

I'm using Media Player Classic - Home Cinema.
After the nuclear blast intro, I hear music and the screen goes black.
No Menu... 

hmm... What kind of fuckery is this? ._. 
Am I drunk? "
,Lanyus,2012-05-29T06:27Z,"^ Solved. 
On Media Player Classic -Home Cinema;

Fullscreen.
Options -> Navigate -> Root Menu. 

Then the Image on the Menu appears as well and not just the background music. 

Played lots of DvD movies (With the Video_ts folder) and even Image Files, and nothing like this ever happened...

Owell, Minor glitch (:
