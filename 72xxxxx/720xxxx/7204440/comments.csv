,nobodynever,2012-04-22T03:42Z,Thanks from the deepest part of Canada.  You footy are my only means of connection to F1.  Thanks for doing both standard and HD.  
,mutineer,2012-04-22T05:16Z,"Yeah, thanks Brother. As always.

See, @nobodynever, there's more than a few Canucks craving F1. You are not alone bud.

First comment already said the other thing I was thinking. Wonder if that Knob will grab this version or if he gave up on F1 altogether..
