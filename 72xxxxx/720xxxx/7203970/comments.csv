Very watchable. I actually normally wait until good dvd copy is released. But this is a good copy, probably a screener.. Has Korean hardcoded subs but other than that is good copy. not 10/10 which in my opinion should mean 1080p perfect quality. On the scale of V1-10 V1 being old cellphone camera quality and 10 being bluray. VHS would be around a V4. DVD V8."
