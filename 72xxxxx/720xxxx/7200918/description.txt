The War Next Door 
National Geographic Ultimate Explorer host Lisa Ling gets extraordinary access - including a rare one-on-one interview with Colombia's President, Alvaro Uribe - as she journeys to Bogot√° and beyond to investigate America's increasing role in Colombia. Through interviews with people on both sides of the conflict, including U.S. embassy officials and military advisers, ordinary coca farmers and even a former assassin, who would only speak under the condition of anonymity at the grave of former drug lord Pablo Escobar, Ling discovers what this complicated situation means to the people on the front lines. Alongside an elite unit of the Colombian police, Ling ventures into the rebel-filled countryside on a mission to find and eliminate clandestine coca fields and cocaine labs. She sees signs of progress, but learns that Colombia may have far to go before it emerges from its turbulent past.
