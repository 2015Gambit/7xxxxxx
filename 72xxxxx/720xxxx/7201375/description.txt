Job For A Cowboy - Demonocracy 2012-CR

Demonocracy roars to life it is wholly evident that this is a far tighter, 
meaner, and more musically accomplished beast that takes their signature 
sound to the next level. From the abrasive blast of opener "Children Of 
Deceit" to the disconcerting strains of "The Deity Misconception" or the 
brooding, epic closer "Tarnished Gluttony" everything is drenched in equal 
parts misanthropy and naked rage, and from start to finish they hold the 
listener by the throat.
