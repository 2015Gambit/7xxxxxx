Greatest Hits (2008)




Despite never having had any substantial hit in the U.S., Dr. Alban nevertheless has become one of the most recognizable faces of the '90s Euro-dance scene with his dancehall-inflected take on the style. He released his debut album Hello Afrika in late 1990, with both the title track and "No Coke" becoming million-selling European hits in 1991. In 1992, second album One Love earned him a sizable hit in the title track and unleashed another two million-selling-plus Euro-smashes in "It's My Life" and "Sing Hallelujah," cementing his place as one of Euro-dance's brightest stars.
