For some reason this episode never aired on ABC in 1966, but it was included on the First Season DVD set for The FBI. Yes, I uploaded those here before last year, but if you missed them I didn't save those copies....sorry.   
I didn't get this one until I found it today. 

Aging actors Keye Luke and Philip Ahn later co-starred in the KUNG FU series 
in the 1970s.
