Description:
Mercedez is a gal who just under went surgery. The operation was implanting new eyes from a previously deceased host. The cause for her surgery is unknown. While she is told by her doctors that the operation has been successful in the past with no problems, little does she know the truth. These doctors tend to use the eyes from dead prostitutes, which leaves Mercedez seeing life in another manner. She becomes more sexually aware of herself and her desires become something uncanny. But as it turns out, she enjoys who she has become.
