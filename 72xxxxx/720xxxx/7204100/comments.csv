,DeIaney,2012-04-21T22:01Z,Looks legit. Haven't downloaded the whole thing yet but when i play it it works. 
,DeIaney,2012-04-22T00:04Z,"Yep it works. Good quality A/V: 9. Its too bad really, I would have paid to see this yesterday but its not available in Canada until May! Considering we smoke more pot than every country except amsterdam, Jamaica, and a few Polynesian islands, it seems a bit ridiculous...

One love. "

You do know that Denmark smoke more than Amsterdam, the same goes for the UK. Canada is placed high on the list, but you don't smoke that much. And just to let you know. The % of smokers in Holland (Amstrdam) is really low compared to the rest of the world. We can se the pattern all over the world, that when a country passes the law on cannabis the % of the people who smoke decreases. But nice of you to let us know that this torretn was good ;) peace!"

In another study, Canada is ranked 8th, Netherlands 9th, and Denmark is 15th. "

,slurpeebox,2012-04-26T07:05Z,"So this is my encode and upload. I just wanted to comment on the artifacts. I reencoded this from the source file I have for a couple reasons.

A - because it was in a format that gave me a few problems in different players. If I left it that way I'm sure there would be lots of people saying ""how do i play this"" or ""this is shit, doesn't play. FAKE!!"" etc. So I reencoded to XVID since its so widely supported. I'm no pro at this so, sorry for the artifacts.

B - In case there were any sort of personally identifiable bits in the original encode. I somehow doubt this but better safe than sorry.

Yeah theres some artifacts due to the reencode to xvid but I figured someone would upload a better quality copy eventually. It took longer than I thought considering this is offered on VOD and facebook/itunes. But ViP3R looks like they have a good quality copy up now.

Additionally, I think it's funny that the NoGrp upload (which is identical to this) has way more peers than this one which is where I originally uploaded it. Also its funny how much praise there is on that upload but theres more people being critical on this torrent. But oh well whatever.

The people that complain about it not being bluray quality or whatever is what really gets me. Even with the encoder artifacts, I think its better than a lot of the early copies of movies that hit the internet. I never claimed this was HD quality and it's more than watchable for a documentary in my opinion.

Oh well I guess I learned my lesson from this uploading experiment. Go download the ViP3R release instead and get off my lawn."
