,Jowy88,2012-04-20T20:30Z,"Your releases generally never work to stream/play via USB on LG Blurays :/ I wonder how you encode them differently not to work. It's too bad, really."
,shelbylab,2012-04-21T06:03Z,Thanks
,shepj78,2012-04-21T12:22Z,seriously... seeding rate sucks :( 7.9% in 12 hours

,vacario,2012-04-22T00:54Z,"Aspect ratio is off ,, everyone's tall and thin "
,shepj78,2012-04-22T01:29Z,@vacario u actually got it? im at 8% after 25 hours... and i hav a fast d/l rate
,shepj78,2012-04-22T01:31Z,"lmao @vacaerio, u actually got it?? im at 8% after 25 hours and i have a decent d/l rate"
,vacario,2012-04-22T01:52Z,"You need 5% to view a clip , using VLC"
,Raptor5,2012-04-22T19:26Z,For Christ Sake...for all you LG 3d tv owners stop friggin moaning..just use MKV2AC3 or Xvid4PSP to change the audio to AC3 which is compatible for all LG tvs. Works for me.
,Raptor5,2012-04-22T19:46Z,The only ones I find that dont work are the ones that have an incompatible framerate...ie working = 23.976...Not working framerate = 48.000. If anyone knows if the framerate can be adjusted without messing up the movie Id like find out.
,Raptor5,2012-04-23T03:47Z,"Dont listen to what anyone says about this torrent being crap..its just NOT TRUE..Finished DL and converted audio to AC3 using Xvid4Psp...took about 5 mins..Quality is fantastic..no stretched screen (Vacario fuck knows what youve been smokin pal, or maybe your just a fucking noob without a cunts clue,stop blasting torrents and other peoples work till you know what the fuck your talking about)..plays amazing on my LG 47"" 3D TV."
,kubanored,2012-04-23T03:58Z,Seed!!! thanks Great upload Perfect quality!
,kubanored,2012-04-23T03:59Z,One of the best 3d movies quality!!!
,kubanored,2012-04-23T04:00Z,Thanks great quality!
,Raptor5,2012-04-23T05:12Z,"Raptor5's Guide To Fast Conversion To LG 3DTV's

DL Xvid4PSP www.winnydows.com

Install it then follow my guide.

Drag n Drop your MKV to the grey bar below the Add Media file / Save File icons..let it parse
At the right hand conversion options select the following.

Under Format: Preset have MKV   Standard
Speed as in source  0
Select Copy  Smart sync 
This is the video and we only want to copy it

Next Select the audio you want to convert for example;
Audio ticked..You will have something like
Audio:DTS 1536kbps 6ch 48000hz English  0 (make sure you have 0)
Next from the drop down list select AC3 then choose what kbps you want ie; 640kbps Multichannel
Dont use filters (advanced if you know what your doing)
Next go to the Save As icon...Save where and what you want to call the new MKV.
Hit Start Encoding......And thats it..the file will high speed encode to AC3 and will be playable on your LG 3DTV. If it still doesnt work try a program called MKV2AC3 that one is fully automated but much, much slower. Hope this helped you guys.

,255neo255,2012-04-23T10:04Z,Same problem as vacario with aspect ratio
,Raptor5,2012-04-23T10:50Z,"Problem is with your setup m8, as Ive already stated, the torrent is perfect."
,Raptor5,2012-04-23T10:54Z,"Check your settings..remember this is a Half Side By Side meant for playback on 3d tvs or monitors, not really for vlc playback. Case in point Ive streamed it from Ps3 Media Server and it had no playback issues whatsoever."
,Raptor5,2012-04-23T11:16Z,"As Ive already commented..Any problems with aspect ratio is down to your own setup..Ive played this back on..Ps3 Media Server, Lg 3d blueray Player via usb, Lg normal blueray player via usb, samsung blueray player via usb, windows media centre, Lg 3d tv usb port..every one plays back perfect..no ratio, freezing, stuttering issues. Please check your shitty configuration before talking pish."
,255neo255,2012-04-23T14:45Z,"I played it with Samsung 3D LED. I've watched about 30 3D mkv files, it's the firts time I encounter that kind of ratio problem."
,vacario,2012-04-24T04:23Z,Even the screenshots are incorrect ratio 
,damo2000,2012-05-08T18:28Z,"Had the same aspect ratio problem when connecting directly to my samsung 3d tv, then i watched the movie through my wd tv live media player and it was perfect.3D is not that great, nothing really jumps out at you but still great."
