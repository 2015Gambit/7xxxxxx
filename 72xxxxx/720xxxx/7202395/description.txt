What is it about? This item has been discontinued by the manufacturer. But thats not true for the fans. Here is the extended combination of Tarantinos 2-part martial arts extravaganza into one epic film.

How to get it? via RAPIDSHARE.

original film name: Kill Bill 1 & Kill Bill 2
new film name: Kill Bill The Whole Bloody Affair


Original Run Time: 247 minutes (including all end and starting credits)
New Run Time: 242 minutes
Date edit was released: July 2008

Cut/added scenes:

    * end credits of Kill Bill 1 cut
    * beginning of Kill Bill 2 cut
    * extended anime scene
    * extended House Of The Blue Leaves scene (colored)
    * extended scene where beatrix and Sophie are talking
    * additional scene with Bill kicking ass

Intentions for this fanedit: This fanedit was created early 2007, but with the official release of THE WHOLE BLOODY AFFAIR still being possible, it was held back for some time now. Now that this official release is cancelled, fans migth never get the full movie to watch in one piece. This fanedit corrects that issue and presents also an even more extended edition with additional scenes and the uncut colored battle against the Crazy88 (only available on the Japanese uncut DVD).

Fanedit details for the xvid avi:

    * NTSC 2.35:1 widescreen presented in 16:9 in a size of 608x272
    * Dolby 5.1 surround Audio: English only
    * English subtitles
