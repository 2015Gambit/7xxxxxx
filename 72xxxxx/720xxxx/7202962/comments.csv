,Jakzba,2012-04-21T09:46Z,Any problems with downloading for example song Auroua is just a glitch because the song seems fine to me but im sure you can download it form somewhere else
,patrickl96,2012-04-21T09:53Z,"It appears the song 'Aurora' from Blocking the Sky doesn't download properly but it actually does (try listening to it in VLC is fine..) 

If it still causes issues just get the mp3 from my MediaFire (provided it hasn't been deleted)
web url: (remove spaces and paste it in)

=============

I will also work on getting the whole album on my Dropbox account so you can download from your browser.

Thanks! -Uploader"

remove all brackets [ ] and go to that link if Aurora from Blocking the Sky doesn't work"

Remove brackets and follow the link - download should just start automatically.

This link is for the whole album inside a .zip file if you want to download without uTorrent or other client.
