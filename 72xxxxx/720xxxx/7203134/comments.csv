,bocok,2012-04-23T08:23Z,"thanks man, can i update normally ?"
,iPlunder,2012-04-23T14:30Z,"There seems to be something wrong with this file - it has frozen Finder and Path Finder several times.

Every time I double click or right click on it, Finder or Path Finder freezes.
I got it to mount by using arrow keys to select the file, then pressing â&#x152;&#x2DC;+O, but I didn't try installing.

Sophos anti-virus says ""no threat detected,"" so there's something else wrong with it.

Anyone else have this problem?"

,christiankittens,2012-07-11T06:58Z,Excellent torrent. Worked perfectly. The only thing is that it wants me to update to 10.0.5 from the App Store and I can't without logging into macotavio@mac.com. Any work around?
,JonteOahu,2012-07-23T18:24Z,"I took the liberty of updating my own copy to 10.0.5 for those of you interested here's the share: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7468323/Final_Cut_Pro_X_10.0.5
