,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-24T02:43Z,"i'm seeding now, it should work? If you are actually getting downloads can you post a comment so I know its working"
,rff118,2012-04-24T03:11Z,I've been waiting for this ever since it came out on the mac store! thanks so much! hope it works on my laptop. I'll seed after i'm done downloading!
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-24T03:16Z,This isn't the one of the App store Its a different one. Its Tales of Valor not Campaign complete.
,rff118,2012-04-24T03:17Z,no seeders!!
,rff118,2012-04-24T03:28Z,im not getting any download :(
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-24T05:07Z,"There were 4 seeders before, where did they go?
other than rff118 is there anyone else with difficulties?"
,cocodevil23,2012-04-24T06:11Z,does it have skirmish ?
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-24T07:22Z,"I don't think it has skirmish, I think its only campaign. I haven't had much of a chance to play it though yet, been busy."
,cocodevil23,2012-04-24T10:35Z,can u tell if it has skirmish so i can start downloading it
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-24T11:07Z,unfortunately it doesn't. It only has campaign
,mycophage,2012-04-24T13:09Z,"I'm not seeing any download activity; ran the torrent overnight. My client sees seeds and peers, but I am not able to download even a partial file."
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-25T01:47Z,"@mycophage are you saying its like (0)2 seeds
and (0)30 peers in your torrent client? that might mean there is something wrong with it. It happened to me as well i don't know what to do. that is strange.

Has anyone managed to download anything, plz reply
"
,rff118,2012-04-25T21:44Z,"no one can download anything, lets try re-uploading the torrent, what torrent-sharer are you using?"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-26T07:54Z,"I'm using uTorrent, i followed all of the instruction on http://torrentfreak.com/how-to-create-a-torrent/ it never seems to work, any ideas?"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-26T08:16Z,"OK FOUND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS, that tracker was discontinued so u need to put lots of different ones. Will re-upload tommorrow"
,alexanderotero,2012-04-27T04:15Z,no seeders :(
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-27T11:08Z,"After Trolling and Lurking around the great expanse of the internet
 I found that I was using a  bad tracker, it should work NOW"
,mycophage,2012-04-27T14:32Z,"That seems to have done it - thanks for following through.

For our education, could you elaborate on how you solved the problem? How did you know it was a bad tracker, and how exactly did you fix it? "
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-27T14:49Z,"I trolled and lurked... ;)

I looked on the suprbay forums and found that the TPB tracker was deleted. On the website i found on how to create the torrent it still had the old TPB Tracker in the instructions which was the one which I had used. Since the website was old it still had the old TPB tracker. I found some new trackers created a new torrent file, then seeded it, now it works. By the way it says there are 33 other seeders??? but not online."
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-28T09:34Z,"@FIRST PERSON to complete the torrent, can you comment so I know everything has worked ok. thx"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-29T13:46Z,"If you want a good First person shooter, get brothers in arms earned in blood. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7125083/Brothers_In_Arms-Earned_In_Blood_Mac , if the link doesnt work search it"
,BMXS,2012-04-30T13:00Z,i finish it finally for two days and a hour 
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-30T13:36Z,@BMXS ok good now seed please
,mycophage,2012-04-30T21:34Z,"Now that the download is complete, I can verify that this is working well (OS 10.6.8, 2.3 GHz Intel core i7, 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3). There is some choppiness to the sound on the very first cutscene, but it doesn't seem to persist. 

I will continue to seed to a ratio of > 10. Thanks again to the uploader!"
,alkwef,2012-05-01T00:42Z,"taking a while to download, but I'll be sure to leave a review. thx in advance!"
,alkwef,2012-05-01T23:10Z,"it's AMAZING!
I bought CoH a long time ago for PC, but now I can play it on Macs! I didn't want to pay like $50 for a game I already owned... especially since this ones limited (see below).

The game: 4/5
The graphics are pretty bad if you're zoomed in, but they look good from the normal viewpoint. 
The gameplay is probably the best you'll find if you're into strategy games. There's tons of weapons and armor and lots of planning involved. It's not just a mindless ""shoot nonstop"" game. 
The one thing that really annoys me is that they left out Skirmish mode and Multiplayer. I can't believe they didn't bring them to the Mac. But oh well. 

The torrent: 5/5
Works perfectly! No crashes, no random errors--no problems of any kind. 

Thanks so much! I'm at a .883 ratio and will seed until I need the hard drive space back (I'm at 5 GB free :( ).
Thanks again!"
,BMXS,2012-05-02T11:23Z,its all missions no skirmish 
,BMXS,2012-05-02T11:24Z,is it only campaign or what??????
,alkwef,2012-05-02T12:55Z,"@BMXS
see my comment above

the developers decided not to bring Skirmish to the Mac version. this torrent isn't ""missing"" anything (AFAIK). "
,cim623,2012-05-03T06:33Z,"I was in one of the first peer groups to complete the torrent (everyone was on the same percent the whole time, LOL). The game works perfectly. I am even able to play it PERFECTLY on my MacBook 10.6.8 on the HIGHEST settings. Can't wait for someone to post the other two games that come with COH Complete Campaign Edition."
,BMXS,2012-05-03T11:59Z,dam it why but its a good game all mission finish in 6 days only 
,ernestagramunt,2012-05-03T21:01Z,"hello,

I have an imac with snowleopard.
I wonder if you can find the game ""Company of Heroes""
for installation.
I've seen ""Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor"" is the second expansion, you can tell me where I can download the game and the first expansion?
thanks"
,alkwef,2012-05-03T23:52Z,I really need the hard drive space back so I'm going to stop seeding within a few days .I'm at 1.179 and I'll let it seed overnight or to 1.25  (whichever takes longer). maybe even 1.5.
,teh-cheeseman,2012-05-04T11:24Z,"@ernestagramunt This is the only company of heroes I could find, and without paying money to one of those dodgy download websites I wont be able to find another one anytime soon."
,ernestagramunt,2012-05-05T01:22Z,"teh-cheeseman 
thanks"
,uneven78,2012-05-05T09:07Z,"Hey thanks for the up, i've been wanting to try this for a while.  Never had a nice enough computer.  Got this mac through my school, but won't get Windows 7 for a little while.  So its nice to be able to try out these games!

Anyone know where I could get a good copy of Dead Island?"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-05-06T07:06Z,"@uneven78 here is a copy but im not sure if it works
Z)&2x%V7Go"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-05-06T07:09Z,"its not there anymore, dont know where it went?"
,BMXS,2012-05-09T13:28Z,can some one upload company of heroes in mac with skirmish 
,teh-cheeseman,2012-05-12T08:25Z,@BMXS The Mac version does not have skirmish...
,welderch,2012-05-18T23:19Z,game works had no prob will seed as much as possible with bad internet but i have no movies its all in white when i start the game and when i start a lvl but when i beat a lvl i see that movie only any one able to help???
,alkwef,2012-05-20T06:48Z,"@BMXS
doesn't exist. they didn't make a mac version with Skirmish or Multiplayer or anything. Just the Campaign. 

@welderch
Reinstall. My copy works w/o ANY problems. It's actually 100% perfect--no exaggeration!"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-05-23T14:03Z,@welderch what type of mac are you using? what year? and specifications? (eg. 2.3ghz) and graphics card etc
,sodaty1,2012-05-25T20:57Z,love
,DaGuBear,2012-05-27T18:59Z,"Is it possible to get trainers for this? if so, how?"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-05-28T10:06Z,@DaGuBear what do you mean by trainers? tutorial?
,sasorus,2012-06-26T18:15Z,Is it posible that someone could convert the actual Pc CoH tales of valor or Opposing fronts to mac? that would be charming.
,Daath666,2012-06-27T01:54Z,Is this just campaign?
,teh-cheeseman,2012-06-27T13:41Z,@daath666 yes it is just campaign
,teh-cheeseman,2012-06-27T13:43Z,"@daath666 READ THE OTHER COMMENTS....
 I WILL NOT REPLY TO PEOPLE WHO ASK QUESTIONS WHICH ARE ALREADY ANSWERED IN OTHER COMMENTS"
,dallen171,2012-07-02T05:44Z,"Ridiculously Awesome!! is actually Company of Heroes Complete which includes the Original, Tales of Valor, and Opposing Fronts. Install exactly as advertised, just dropped into Applications and clicked to open. Runs perfectly, no problems at all. Thats even on a 2011 Macbook Air- OSX 10.7.4, 1.6GHz Intel Core i5, 2GB 1333MHz DDR3. Run game on medium-high and average 38 fps.
Such a sweet game."
,jarzyn5g,2012-07-14T12:51Z,Running on Mac Mini Server 2.66 GHz. Can only play the toutrial. When lunching campaign application - the game closes itself. Any ideas whats wrong?
,jarzyn5g,2012-07-17T11:59Z,This game is not supported on volumes formatted as Mac OS Extended (Case Sensitive) !!!
,teh-cheeseman,2012-07-19T12:23Z,@jarzyn5g it will probably be because it is a mac mini and does not have a specification it needs
,prolland,2012-07-31T00:22Z,"Doesn't work in mountain lion, but i used in lion. i love this game. Guys please do it in mountain lion.

(sorry my bad english)"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-07-31T08:48Z,"@prolland sorry I don't know how to, someone else may know how?"
,prolland,2012-07-31T12:22Z,"When I installed the mountain lion, it was still a good game, but I did a clean install with Time Machine and now not start :/ / /."
,teh-cheeseman,2012-08-01T10:09Z,@prolland because you did a reinstall from time machine sometimes apps don't work after you transfer them. You will need to get the original COH-TOV.dmg and install it again
,prolland,2012-08-16T21:44Z,"i did, but not good :///

already the icon no longer appears in the dock.. :/"
