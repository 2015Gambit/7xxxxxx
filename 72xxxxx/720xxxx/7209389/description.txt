MX Superfly, released in 2002 as MX Super Fly in PAL regions, is a motorcross racing game developed by Pacific Coast Power & Light and published by THQ for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. 

PS2 emulator included with my configuration pics that gives excellent PC graphics and performance, beating the PS2 graphics by a mile, thats why this game is in the PC games section rather than the PS2 section.

NOTE: Best played with a game controller. Use lilyPad within the emulator to set up your controller or keyboard configuration.

Scanned with Comodo IS, compressed with 7zip, output size 1.77 gig. 

This is PS2 [PAL] version.

                                                                    
                                     ENJOY.
