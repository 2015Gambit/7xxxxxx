Yep, 1.7 BABY FINALLY ITS HERE SINCE PEOPLE ARE LAZY!

Ok so first of all, just extract and play.

YES IT DOES HAVE DER RIESE IN IT, MULTIPLAYER, AND CAMPAIGN IN IT!

How to add maps:
Right click on the game > drive_c > users > Wineskin > Local Settings > Application data > Activison > CoDWaw > Mods > extract the custom map here

Custom maps can be obtained from customcod.com

Issues:

If it says "Codwaw.exe closed unexpectly whatever whatever" move the game into a appications folder, if it still doesnt work, move it to the trash then back to your desktop and try launching the game. remember, keep moving the game into different folders till it keeps working.

Remember, this port is NOT obtained from anywhere, I Ported this myself!

Please seed, I cant seed because of my slow internet connection.

Note: if you are having issues of any kind, you can message me on Skype.

Also, feel free to drop me a game you want me to port into the mac.

PLEASE DONT REQUEST BATTLEFIELD 3 OR ANY OTHER TYPES OF GAME LIKE THIS, ITS BECAUSE WINESKIN DOES NOT SUPPORT X11 YET AND BF3 REQUIRES X11 SO IT WONT WORK!
