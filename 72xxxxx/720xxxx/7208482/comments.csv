,XxNARWHALS1xX,2012-04-24T04:14Z,PLEASE SEED!
,Demondays1,2012-04-24T05:00Z,"Come on guys, please seed, I would seed but my download rates are like an average of 60 kb/s so I can hardly seed. (My highest speed to seed it about 1.0 kb/s)"
,mycophage,2012-04-24T13:06Z,"If this torrent was posted on 4/23, there hasn't been time for the file to have been uploaded, especially if the original poster didn't seed at all. So, this one is probably dead.

Demondays1: Not to be confrontational, but it sounds implausible that your best upload speed is 1 kb/sec. In any case, something is better than nothing."
,Demondays1,2012-04-25T06:39Z,"Guys please seed, If I dont get lots of seeders soon, Ill probably take of this torrent, please, lets get AT LEAST 13 seeders please."
,mycophage,2012-04-26T13:33Z,"Demondays: You know that no one else can seed until after you've uploaded at least one full copy, right? "
,Changochon,2012-04-29T16:19Z,"Demondays1, i think you must seed 24/7 untill more people get the full game so  they can seed too. I really want this torrent as is the only way to get Waw 1.7 on mac, plz seed your own torrent. Thanks."
,Grapeflavouredpop,2012-04-30T06:33Z,Wow i really want this. only 1 seeder though :( They go by so quick * Sobbs* 
,alkwef,2012-05-01T00:43Z,"@Demondays1
Just to make sure, have you seeded it yet? Because if you don't, then no one else can..."
,Demondays1,2012-05-02T07:28Z,"guys, my internet is acting all bad, i wont be able to seed until i resolve this. wait at least 1-3 weeks then try downloading again."
,LNG33,2012-05-02T23:47Z,"Im seeding this today in hope of an answer, cant get the app to launch- have moved it around heaps but nothing is working, hope someone can help, thanks."
,Demondays1,2012-05-03T01:24Z,"@LNG try moving it too applications folder, if it doesnt work there, restart your computer then try running it, usually it will work somehow."
,LNG33,2012-05-03T02:06Z,"yea hey mate, tried moving from folder to folder to desktop to app folder, rubbish and back again, and restarted computer too, wont even land on the dock, no error message, just wont launch. Its like trying to start a car with no spark plugs, wants to fire up but needs something to give it a spark. any other ideas?"
,LNG33,2012-05-03T04:20Z,"@Demondays1 think i resolved one issue i had (it obviously aint gonna work on a DP version of OSX, duh) but now on 10.7.3 lion it still aint working, going thru rebooting and all the other steps still tho. Now it just bounces on the dock and fails to launch. Will advice if i get it working."
,Demondays1,2012-05-03T17:20Z,"Your on 10.7.3? well, it could be that problem, just use skype to talk to me, its in the description above ^^"
,bryan983,2012-05-03T23:53Z,Nobody can seed? :/ I can not find this for mac anywhere else.
,LNG33,2012-05-04T12:56Z,"ill seed if i can get it working, how can being on the most current OS be the problem? it aint working on the latest DP for 10.8 either, and im really not going to downgrade my os to run a game, im not that desperate.....really"
,menymen,2012-05-06T04:27Z,"Since Everyone is going To Be A-Holes , I Will Seed For You When im Done Downloading ,

,Demondays1,2012-05-26T17:41Z,@puke No I will not port killing floor since its mac-native (meaning its already available to the mac).
