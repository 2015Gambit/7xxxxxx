
Recorded and released after a mutiny by most of James Brown's late-'60s band, Doing Their Own Thing contains 12 slabs of superb early-'70s style funk. 
Mostly instrumental, radio play for the album and subsequent singles appears to have been blocked by Brown himself. (Credited to Maceo Parker.) (AMG)



Fantastic album of hardcore funky cuts, with a great jazzy tip on the righteous solos laid down by Maceo and the band. Recorded in the time that Maceo was away from James' band, with a crack lineup of players including Melvin Parker, Jimmy Nolan, Bernard Odom, and L.D. Williams. 
Nearly every cut is a lost funky gem, with funky bass, hard drums, and cool horn solos with a large sense of humor. Highlights include "Southwick", "Got to Get 'Cha", "Maceo", and the fantastic "Funky Women". This one was hard to find in the old days -- so grab it while you can
