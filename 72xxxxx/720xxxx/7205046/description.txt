     Alex is boarding his plane to France on a school trip, when he        
   suddenly gets a premonition that the plane will explode. When Alex      
   and a group of students are thrown off the plane, to their horror,      
     the plane does in fact explode. Alex must now work out Death's        
      plan, as each of the surviving students falls victim. Whilst         
   preventing the worst from happening, Alex must also dodge the FBI,      
                which believes Alex caused the explosion.
