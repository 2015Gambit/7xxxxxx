[V],psspss,2012-08-12T17:26Z,"sorry I cant afford to keep reseeding it..

many are scum leechers

ive got 120gb per month data cap and its expensive

it still says 3 seeders.. 

i suspect someone would of upload this on a private tracker by now though if can find it"
[V],psspss,2012-08-12T17:39Z,"you might be blocked for some reason..

normally happens if your isp is included in the peer block 1.1 that everyone uses even if they use a vpn
as it stops antip2p sending fake data slowing you down and wasting your bandwidth

you could find a cheap vpn for liek $5 a month at torrentfreak they have a good list


also add this track helps find more peers and seeders
