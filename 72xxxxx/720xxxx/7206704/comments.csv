If it was either English or Spanish I would still go for it. Thank you to the uploader!!!"
,raymond_u,2012-04-22T20:50Z,If only there was a 1080 upload of the race in English... sigh. Anyways - top work for uploading a 1080 copy of the race!
,Seemann80,2012-05-14T01:47Z,"Yess, at least again.. I watched F1 via RTL many years long and I was very happy with the quality (just like bbc, they got high standards, no bastards..) and of course I speak enough german to understand quite everything..
Well... yes, it's a ""well-sized"" piece of torrent... but i want it at least once.. :)
Danke!!"
