┬╡Torrent 3.1.3.27092 Final+Portable[Team Nanban][TPB]

DESCRIPTION:

┬╡Torrent is one of the most popular BitTorrent clients, with plenty of features such as bandwidth prioritization, 
RSS auto-downloading, scheduling and Mainline DHT (which is compatible with BitComet, another well-known BitTorrent client),
 Protocol Encryption joint specification (used also by Azureus 4.7.0.0 and above, BitComet 1.30+) and peer exchange.

┬╡Torrent was written with efficiency in mind. Unlike many torrent clients, it does not hog valuable 
system resources - typically using less than 6 MB of memory, allowing you to use the computer as if it weren't there at all. 
Additionally, the program itself is contained within a single executable less than 750 KB in size.

Features of ┬╡Torrent:

- Multiple simultaneous downloads
- Configurable bandwidth scheduler
- Global and per-torrent speed limiting
- Quick-resumes interrupted transfers
- RSS Downloader
- Trackerless support (Mainline DHT)
