Gary Lineker introduces highlights of the day's Premier League games, with expert analysis from Alan Hansen and Alan Shearer.

Arsenal played host to Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium in the sequel to what was one of the matches of the 2011/12 Premier League season. The Gunners ran out 5-3 winners at Stamford Bridge back in October with Robin van Persie scoring a hat-trick. At the time Alan Hansen called it - one of the best matches you will ever see - and claimed it could have ended in a 10-10 draw. Can the two sides chasing Champions League qualification for next season serve up another classic?

Elsewhere, Tottenham travelled across London to take on QPR while Blackburn played Norwich dreaming of a similar result to their first ever Premier League meeting with the Canaries 20 years ago, when they prevailed 7-1 at Ewood Park.
