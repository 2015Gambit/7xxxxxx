Plankeye was a Christian alternative rock band and one of Tooth & Nail Records' greatest successes during the 1990s and early 2000s. Plankeye's style could be defined as melodic post-grunge combined with indie and alternative elements. Their first few albums also incorporated a fair amount of punk rock elements, but this aspect faded when original singer Scott Silletta left the band.
