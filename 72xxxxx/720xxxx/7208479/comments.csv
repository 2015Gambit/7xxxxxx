,rjamesbe,2012-04-23T14:13Z,"as with certain files that appear to be corrupt I can not open, transfer or look in the folder without crashing windows explorer. 
Anybody else have this problems? I gratefully download dayly HD series and did not have this with any other file the last months.."

,Knurk,2012-04-26T15:43Z,"A question: I never downloaded a TS-file before, so it's probably my inexperience, but when I want to convert this file with Xilisoft Ultimate it doesn't find the 5.1 surround sound. And yes, I did cut off the first few minutes because HBO doesn't start broadcasting in 5.1 until the openingcredits begin. Do I need to use another program or does this specific file lack the 5.1 track?"
,Knurk,2012-04-27T02:11Z,"Never mind, I already see it's got 5.1 as soon as the intro starts."
