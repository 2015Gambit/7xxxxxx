,chromepony,2012-04-23T20:18Z,"TxJag, When you see an u/l by Chromepony, don't click on it because it is not meant for you, since you see fit to trash anything from me.  By the way, I checked out your post of Post Mortem and aside from comments in the beginning that are worthless, it's the same as the one I posted.  I download books, read them when I can and pass them on so others can enjoy them.  I don't need anything to hang on the wall next the Picasso's so if there is an edit problem I don't care.  If I want retail quality I'll pay the auther for it instead of stealing it from a Pirate site.  When getting things for free you have to accept what you get and not trash the person that is trying to help others.  I guess you can guess how I feel now.   CP"

with all due respect - These books are retail quality.  NOT THE SAME as you posted. Why lie? 

AND If you issues with pirating please don't post anymore - BECAUSE NOW we all know that chromepony posts SHIT to encourage people to buy the ebooks. 

thanks for sharing that"

[T],Spetses,2012-04-24T17:35Z,TxJag -  Thanks for these I have not read the complete set of Scarpetta.I think I will start from the first book and go all the way.You seem to have caused a bit of a storm with a few posters and I do not wish to add any fire. All I can say is that any person that takes time to post virus free content should be thanked.
