,giddieon,2012-04-21T19:47Z,C_P you rock we don;t get this show in Canada and you are right on the money every Saturday thanks...
,wesrk,2012-04-21T21:10Z,"Great upload, unfortunately this is missing the last couple of seconds at the end. Not much lost when compared to the broadcasted version. Just putting it out there. It cuts right after Batman says: Whatâ&#x20AC;Ś"
,teeehaaa,2012-04-21T21:29Z,The video code are bad another ZOOMED VIDEO AGAIN lol.......................
,craddle,2012-04-21T22:36Z,Bad quality as always. :(
,omarrrio,2012-04-22T01:15Z,there are no better quality sadly :/
,slybunda,2012-04-22T02:18Z,badly overcropped and the last 40 seconds or so of video is missing which explains a very large part of the whole episodes plot. need to redownload this when a proper one is out
,perplexicide,2012-04-22T02:54Z,This is the wrong episode. I believe the file is actually episode 22. I remember watching it last month.
,wesrk,2012-04-22T04:11Z,"@perplexicide 
NO. This is not a repeat episode and is NOT wrongly numbered, this IS the episode that was broadcasted on Saturday, April 21st, 2012. Whatever you remember in your mind could NOT have possibly been this video. There are about 30 seconds of flashbacks in the episode and that is the ONLY way you could have been confused. Enjoy the show."
,Lennnny,2012-04-22T13:35Z,"all batman says at the end is (Minor spoilers)




""what did we do?"" and it cuts to credits"
[V],{C_P},2012-04-22T14:08Z,"We know about the missing 1 second at the end.
A fixed version will be releases in a Batch torrent on Monday.

To you that complain about the quality, we are a SD TV release group. If you want HD you better go some where else."
,Lesman,2012-04-22T15:51Z,"First time I've downloaded/seeded a {C_P} torrent. Shit quality. Feels like I'm torrenting in 2001. Thanks anyway, though."
[T],MrDowntown,2012-04-22T16:29Z,"I watched this on TV, only missing final line which is Batman saying, ""What did we do?"""
,slybunda,2012-04-22T16:54Z,"i can forgive the poor quality upload and the last few seconds missing, but why have the video overcropped so much?"
,naga111,2012-04-22T17:43Z,ty!
,dm_punks,2012-04-22T20:59Z,"To those complaining about the quality, stop downloading SDs and watching it on your HD monitors.

Reliable as always, {C_P}. Keep it up!

The batch download on Monday will include all the episodes for the current season of Young Justice, right? Waiting to dl that. Thanks! ^^v"
,drkmagic5,2012-04-22T22:08Z,"""To those complaining about the quality, stop downloading SDs and watching it on your HD monitors.""

that's not the issue at all, many of us would suffer through SD if its the only thing available, the issue arises in C_P cropping a 4:3 video to 16:9, essentially cropping out 10+% of the video (of an already 'cropped' video)."
,torjak,2012-04-28T03:52Z,"yo C_P, any chance you could upload the fixed and better video of this episode? thanks mate!"
