Jim Capaldi got to work with former Traffic band members
Steve Winwood and Dave Mason on some of his albums.

The first 3 were above average, but the quality of Jim's
music went downhill over the next 30 years after these.

He and Steve were fine with their Traffic reunion in 1994 though :


1. Oh How We Danced

2. Whale Meat Again

3. Short Cut Draw Blood
