I am just a poor old widow, with only a small pension to live on. 

I spend most of my money on seeds for the birds, nuts for the squirrels and food for my cats !!
 
I put the rest in the electric meter, to keep my PC running, so that I can seed EE for all the pirates that want downloads. 

But I can't afford to keep it running all night
The selfish pirates who get the first downloads will not continue to seed, so the rest must wait until I get up the next day, and feed the damned meter again !!
