,darkizzle,2012-04-23T05:32Z,"Thank you ez! This show is the best ever. I’ve already seen this episode, buts its worth at least 10 viewings. So good! I almost cried when that white walker killed Samwell, and he was just trying to protect Jon! I didn’t expect him to die so soon! And then Jaime escaped from his cage and almost beheaded Robb! Best scene in the show and what an awesome fight. And I cant believe Daenerys rode her dragon into the city when they refused to let her people in! That wasn’t in the book but so badass! I cant wait for when she marries Joffrey so she can have the iron throne! Best episode in the season easily!

I'm getting exhausted."
,Namorax,2012-04-23T05:45Z,"***jesus christ douchebag spoiler alert***, what kind of fucking spoogewipe posts a spoiler on a brand new upload"
,powers987,2012-04-23T05:45Z,"darkizzle is trolling. Trolling hard.

It's always a legit copy when it's uploaded by EZTV. I trust no other source for my TV shows."
,powers987,2012-04-23T05:47Z,"Namorax- I'm pretty sure he's lying like hell, making up stuff as he goes. I've read all of the books and nothing he says happened at any point in time. Think about it, those dragons are little babies, no person can ride them. He's being a tool, just ignore him."
,bokhaddah,2012-04-23T05:48Z,"@darkizzle Please do everybody a favor and remove your comment, no one likes a spoiler"
,BreakingBadFan,2012-04-23T05:49Z,@ darkizzle come on douche! thank god i actually saw the spoiler at the BOTTOM of your comment. asshole move
,HaoleGuy,2012-04-23T06:01Z,"@darkizzle No, the best part was when we leaned it was all a dream Bran was having, and that he can still walk but also turn into a crow or a wolf. "
,neurosisx,2012-04-23T06:01Z,"you can always trust a torrent uploaded by eztv, so this is legit. but jesus, the cloud health is fucking terrible."

,tetnem,2012-04-23T06:19Z,"Thank you eztv, you are the best. I have waited long enough for this episode. Nice TV show! "
,Marclee,2012-04-23T06:22Z,"lol...I read darkrizzle's fake spoiler and started cringing thinking he just spoiled one of my favorite series right now...Well, forgot that I have already read the books and and noticed he is making stuff up anyway.

But kudos...It's funny : D"
,kamokeq,2012-04-23T06:22Z,"Well done, darkizzle. I raged pretty hard."

,zuluhead,2012-04-23T07:00Z,AWSOME!! thanks
,gAMBOLz,2012-04-23T07:01Z,"Agreed darkizzle. Sucks also when Daenerys ends up dying in the house of the undying because the dragon she rode in on was too big to go in with her and burn it so she could escape.
Now Mormont will never get to make out with her.

,enkilleridos,2012-04-23T10:04Z,"@powers987 While nothing he said happened in the books, I would like to point out that there is a lot of shit that happens/doesn't happen in True Blood compared to the books that show is based on. So already we know that HBO likes to change story elements based on books. That gives a little bit of credibility up to where he says Dany rides in on a Dragon. 

Mark my words HBO is gonna change the series and to those that are fans of the books. And some of the fans are not gonna like it. Or they will leave out some character that is cool and somewhat crucial to the story. Like killing samwell is something HBO would actually do.

My proof? Okay Claudine was known in Bon Temps by everyone. Elvis is a vampire, and was  introduced before the witches. Lafayette doesn't exist in the books.

,N4mb3r5,2012-04-25T01:01Z,"HBO already changed lots of things in this series...

I won't list them in case they were only slightly changed and HBO plans on wrapping the story up later on.


But anyways...

Incredibly good book series.
Awesome TV series.

Gonna keep reading and watching.
So should you all."

,CrimmyP84,2012-04-26T12:27Z,also having trouble with repack version. the sound is not in sync and media player cancels it out. wtf???
,_ink,2012-04-27T19:37Z,"Don't bother downloading, it skips a portion of the episode (perhaps only a minute or two) and goes out of sync thereafter.
eztv is usually really good though, I'm grateful for the countless others I've downloaded without issue in ridiculous quality from the user :)"
,aP1LGR1M,2012-04-30T01:05Z,"EVERYONE...dont any of dare say anything to poor little darkizzle.
@darkizzle - I'm with you buddy, i feel your pain. If my daddy sodomized me twice a day i'd be pissed off too and will naturally wanna ruin it for everyone by posting comments such as you did. 
So im gonna let it slide this time.
HOWEVER - If you ever share your insights in a forum like this again....Next time your mother is being ridden by my rottweiler - he wont be wearing a condom.
So shove that keyboard up your constipated asshole and dont use it again. You'r not getting another warning.
To everyone else - guys it's cool, i've read all five books none of the stuff this rotten dick aka darkizzle ""shared"" with us is in the books."
