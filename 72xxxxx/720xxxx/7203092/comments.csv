[V],psspss,2012-04-22T01:40Z,"yeh celeb ghost hunters was good and could easy replace boring old taps who have much more funds now
and the gear just they dont use it

they dont even use torches any more to communicate

i find it odd they havent try a qwerty keyboard
with emf buttons on it
and a speech unit that says the letter said

they if its a real ghost it would spell out stuff

i think celeb ghost wasnt taken up as a series
was just a one off special"
[V],psspss,2012-04-22T06:46Z,"this is the full episode

I was talking about the S01 special alcatraz
above if you got confused"
