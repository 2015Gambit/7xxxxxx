But it's surprising because 99.9% of eztv's shit is in avi. Why is this not?"
,frijj_2000,2012-04-21T11:22Z,They switched to mp4 a month or two ago.

Coz the admin novaking on the eztv site is a self satisfied turd, who went like a lemming with some of the 'tv ripper scene' and has become anti avi.

Eztv site used to be good for craig ferguson (now hardly evr posts mainly BECAUSE they are posted in avi's)

he has also closed registration to eztv (god knows why) i had an old posting account banned there for 'being so bold as to question his administration of the site' many many moons ago.

I personaly love piratebay and am waiting in anticipation for Nova of eztv toi get his ass handed to him by maffiaa"
,ty_uppers,2012-04-21T20:56Z,"mp4 files are for those geeks who never leave their computers. Those of us who enjoy watching television shows on our televisions find that mp4 files cannot be detected by our PS3's or XBox360's. I shouldn't complain about things I get for free, but I have noticed the absence of free things that I used to enjoy. I don't get this mp4 fanaticism around here. I think it sucks."
,JeffRelf,2012-04-21T22:40Z,"Mr. eztv does it right everytime; .MP4 is better than .AVI,
the quality is great and the size is small."
,gps1976,2012-04-22T18:07Z,"Hardly any external digital media players will play the x264 format.  The size vs an xvid/ divx .avi is negligible.  The video quality doesn't seem to be as good either, and I don't like to watch all my TV/ movies on my laptop.  Thanks anyway."
,alenglish,2012-04-23T06:41Z,MP4s work fine on the PS3....thanks eztv
,7roj4n,2012-04-30T19:44Z,"torrent is great like always.


quit crying, it's not that hard to connect your pc to a tv via hdmi or vga..."
,cruelty1001,2012-05-03T12:41Z,"""mp4 files are for those geeks who never leave their computers""

Speak for yourself.  My Bluray player plays MP4/MKV files but not AVI, so I'm perfectly happy with this.  MP4/h264 is better quality than DivX anyway (at the same file size).

""mp4 files cannot be detected by our PS3's or XBox360's.""

Then something is wrong with your PS3.  PS3 supports mp4/h264 files.

If you really need the files to be a certain format for an external player just get AVS video converter, and you can convert to whatever file type your player supports."

I couldn't disagree with you more, for me it's quantity over quality in this type of torrent. WMV's come out as MASSIVE files and I don't really like spending hours downloading a huge file when I just want something to listen to.

EZTV is the most active torrenter for me. TvTeam are great though, love their torrents."
