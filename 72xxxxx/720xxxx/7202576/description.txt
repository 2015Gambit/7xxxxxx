Researchers in Antarctica are abducted by a team of masked stormtroopers.
They are dragged deep underground to a hidden continent in the center of
the earth. Here Nazi survivors, their bodies a horrifying patchwork of
decaying and regenerated flesh, are planning for the revival of
the Third Reich.
