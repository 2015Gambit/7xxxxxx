Words Of Farewell - Immersion 2012-FiH

Words of Farewell were founded in early spring 2007, made up of the 
remains of a former rock band called Deviance and some acquaintances 
of the main songwriters and core of the band – Phillipp Olivier (lead 
guitar) and Erik Gaßmus (lead guitar). After writing several songs
which lead to the disbanding of their former band due to musical 
differences, they looked for some metalheads who were willing and 
able to play the songs and form a band.
