It's a 24/7-'ish' show from PensTV online called "In The Room." It's producted by Leo McCafferty who has done work with NFL Films in the past. There will be 10 episodes in total.

On Friday, a multi-part series in the spirit of 24/7 called ΓÇÿIn the RoomΓÇÖ will debut on the team website. The series wonΓÇÖt have the monster budget of an HBO production (or the soothing voice of narrator Liev Schreiber), but it will take fans behind the scenes with the team like never before. Players will be wired for audio, cameras will be present behind closed doors, and fans will even get a look at players lives away from the arena.

The producer of the new show is Leo McCafferty, a Pittsburgh native who spent time with NFL Films under the tutelage of some of the industryΓÇÖs best sports storytellers. McCafferty says he sees great potential for a series like this in his hometown. ΓÇ£This is a great hockey market and Penguins fans in general are clamoring for more information and media to digest. Our goal is to appeal to those hardcore hockey fans, but also to someone that doesnΓÇÖt know a thing about the sport.ΓÇ¥

This is exactly the sort of thing that the NHL needs more of. Pretty much everyone agrees that HBO's 24/7 was excellent television and a great way to market individual NHL players and the sport of hockey as a whole. We're definitely looking forward to the rest of the series.
