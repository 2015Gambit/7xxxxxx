However. I now get a window that says ""Please enter the session number that was given to you. you will appear in the session under the name:"" 

and I have no clue what the Session number should be..... "
,aeriam,2012-04-30T05:42Z,"NEVERMIND! I was being an idiot. It works now.

downloads are running. Starts fine. Patch works great.

Now I'm off to make music and re-watch Yuru Yuri XD"

,madmaxdeadly,2012-05-22T10:36Z,"Just to let you know, that as this Magix Software is cracked, you cannot download the packages. Magix servers check to see if it is real or not. You can however download soundpools using this site."
,armchair.53,2012-06-11T11:07Z,"works fine... just as described on VISTA 32 bit.

NOTE: as posted by the author, you cannot download packages.  However, there are 2 instrument packages you can download before you use the patch and still have the trial version"
