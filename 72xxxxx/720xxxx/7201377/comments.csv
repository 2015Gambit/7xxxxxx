,spazz0ut,2012-04-21T09:08Z,"So, it was a little weird, but the video caused Plex to crash to desktop after hiccuping on it for a few seconds. I tried it with VLC and Quicktime, and it played fine.  Went back to try Plex again, and it worked on the second try.

Apart from that, it is a beautiful encode: V10/A10

Thanks for this!"
