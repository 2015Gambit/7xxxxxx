,guyfromskys,2012-04-20T21:06Z,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1532384/
,casstin,2012-04-20T21:11Z,"If it's not on IMDB, chances are it's a low budget independent film or documentary."
,ALuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,2012-04-20T22:08Z,"So many leechers, yeah, it's probably porn in nature ;)"
,dubblue4,2012-04-20T22:37Z,thank you
,ch4rm3r,2012-04-20T23:30Z,"This is what I could find about the movie : In Jeff Pickett's new film titled Nature, a young couple is going through that exact problem. After a failed attempt to revive their love life via role playing, they decide to give a week long sex-centred camping trip a try. Really, what could be better than a week in nature with nothing but each other to keep you entertained? Sounds like a good plan but things go drastically wrong when the couple encounters a drifter who won't leave them alone â&#x20AC;&#x201C; guess a threesome is out of the question?"
,Morphesto,2012-04-21T00:36Z,ch4rmr Thx for the info. Sounds a bit gay for me...
,coolhanddool,2012-04-21T04:06Z,"it is on IMB AT : 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1532384/"
,botcrawl,2012-04-21T05:22Z,"Just in case you have not heard, it's on IMDB @ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1532384/

Oh btw: I read comments 1-2 and stop at 3. 
It's just the way my life has always been.
Sooo if there is a link to IMDB on the third comment, I didn't see it and I'm the first to actually post it becuase if there is a IMDB link on the third comment it simply does not exist to me because I only read comments 1-2 and avoid any text that may appear like a link.
Luckly TPG has green links which are harder to avoid than blue.
I reinvented myself watching this movie. I did not watch it though.
I also did not download it but the quality is
A 10
V 10
M 10.5
Plot: So many surprises.
Well written dialogue, I'm bored."

,st0gey,2012-04-21T10:20Z,"Meh! I'll stick with Xhamster .com thanks




btw botcrawl, why don't you 'reinvent' yourself into something that makes sense. Twat!
"
,deebeef,2012-04-21T12:27Z,botcrawl you are a dildo
,QWESTSUX,2012-04-21T15:09Z,"Ape. Man. Angel. Gay.
"
,phxsea,2012-04-21T15:18Z,"why is this so high up on torrents?

this shit was stupid 

i got 30 mins in and stopped"
,botcrawl,2012-04-21T21:19Z,"I am a dildo. I like to go inside vaginas and buttholes.
"
,broxter,2012-04-22T02:32Z,"hey botcrawl dont you mean buffalos ya dildo,we all know thats what you meant to write. "
,dude_wasted87,2012-04-22T08:05Z,"I can't believe this is so high up on the top 100. The quality is good but the movie was awful. I couldn't even finish it. Like a real shitty softcore porno with a barely thought out story to it. That's just my opinion though. I mean if that's your thing it might be worth your time downloading it I guess lol

Anyway thanks for the effort! TPB kicks ass!"
,dekz26,2012-04-22T17:10Z,ron jeremy movies have better storylines than this piece of cinematic crap
,pxpierre,2012-04-23T07:02Z,"Funny comment by aroundsound on imdb:

""If I was in charge of selecting movies to be shown in care facilities for head trauma victims or hospital wards full of heavily medicated people, this film would definitely be on my list"". :-)"
,mattm2047,2012-04-23T09:15Z,"Unwatchable! The chick is average looking at best and the plot, acting, and directing make this unwatchable! Dont waste 1 1/2 hours of your life."
,OhMyGod001,2012-04-25T06:45Z,"Wtf!!!!! Worst acting, story and movie itself... the man who acted(acted??) in negative role is the cheapest of all actors in the industry... He shouldn't have got more than 1$ for his ridiculous acting.. Such a shame.. A/V = 9/9.. Thanks for the work HeroMaster.. ."
,Soulbend,2012-04-27T11:35Z,Shitiest movie ever...
