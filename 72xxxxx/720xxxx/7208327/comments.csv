,halomodfreak,2012-04-27T02:24Z,From a brony... i love you for uploading this. also rarity is best pony
,Mr.Boulregard,2012-04-27T16:36Z,Could anyone verify if these are watermarked?
,MrREDPONY,2012-04-28T07:18Z,"Mr.Boulregard: the .mkv files aren't, but the others are. As I said in the description, when I'll re-upload it, they'll all be in .mkv and hopefully, without watermark. You'll have to bear it for now (the Hub logo is subtle though)"
,Mr.Boulregard,2012-04-29T09:56Z,"honestly I didn't know what .mkv meant in terms to watermarks, if the hub logo is all there is then that's no big deal, it just irritates me when there would be pop ups for ""You are watching...""/""Up next is..."" and etc. 

and thank you. *("
,superdavee,2012-04-29T21:39Z,"good quality, thank you "
,Mr.Levy,2012-05-01T01:54Z,"Epic I've been looking for a Good S2 torrent

I'll Seed the crap out of this."
,FuRrY321,2012-05-06T04:20Z,"The heck. I watched episodes 1-4, all was good besides massive artefacting that didn't happen a lot, but when it did, it made it impossible to see WTH was going on.
Then, I tried to watch episode 5, and the dialog track was missing! The BGM was there, but no voice overs!
I really wanted to avoid watching it on YouTube, but looks like I have no choice..."
,MrREDPONY,2012-05-07T05:29Z,FuRrY321: I don't understand. I checked episodes 1-6 and everything works fine. I'll check the rest of the season but it's supposed to be fine
,nitebomber51,2012-06-30T14:03Z,"@halomodfreak NO YOU LIE!!!! LIES ALL OF IT LIES FLUTTERSHY, APPLEJACK AND RAINBOW DASH  ARE ALL TIED FOR 1ST WHILE TWIGHLIGHT SPARKLE COMES A VERY CLOSE 2ND

@MrREDPONY Thanks for the great torrent, TPB doesn't really appricate bronys like us and all the other commenters/downloaders"
,NeonMan23,2012-07-17T13:25Z,"Guys, I downloaded this entire thing, but VLC isn't playing it right. The video stops but audio continues. And, GOM player lags like crazy when it does. Please, someone reply to this.




Also, Fluttershy is best pony"
,NeonMan23,2012-07-17T13:38Z,It seems that only the .mkv files are working D:
,MrREDPONY,2012-07-22T08:11Z,"@NeonMan23 Like I said earlier, all my files are working fine. If there's a problem, it's with the torrent, but I don't know what it would be or how to fix it."
