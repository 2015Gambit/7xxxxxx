QM 19 - Quantum SPIN

The quantitative modelling of nuclear SPIN in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

The source of all Magnetic magnetons resulting from Spin-Orbital coupling and Leptronic rotations in quantum mechanics is revealed.

The source of all Nuclear magnetic moments are illustrated as is the clear definition of the Bohr magnetons [Electron spin UP & spin DOWN] as referenced to the Nuclear magnetons for the first time in recorded history.

The nineteenth chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an overview of the Tetryonic explanation of nuclear magnetons.
