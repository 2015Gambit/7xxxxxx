now why average home users with cheap gear
can capture this over all these ghost hunters teams
beats me :)

well worth a watch.. this is the best show on paranormal evidence.. even the evps are clear
well most of them"
[V],psspss,2012-04-23T10:04Z,"man theres been some poor seeders/peers on this torrent
i had to block a few took much longer to seed out and
30 percent more data to seed out.."
,GrayFox22,2012-04-23T12:19Z,"True, this show does get some of the best ghost videos I have ever seen. People who are into the paranormal need to download the 3 previous series of this, it's the best show out there for ghost videos imo. Good thing about this show is it covers multiple stories in each episode, with great videos to back up the stories. Really glad it's back on air.

Thanks for this upload, I can watch this on my PS3. My preferred way of watching these downloads."
[V],psspss,2012-04-24T09:35Z,"looks like the titles tne supplied are wrong though

as the title THE UNINVITED is actually in E02

oh well

perhaps someone can find the proper titles..

normally I just use the first segment title
in the avi myself"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-24T14:31Z,"@ GrayFox22 and all with a PS3 or Xbox360-

the hdtv.x264 mp4 files out there play perfectly on your game consoles

just give it a try, please compare the videos side by side, you'll notice the difference in quality

they also play perfectly on iphones, ipads, ipods, smartphones, tablets, and some portable media players

there are inexpensive (~$60 micca mplay-hd or nbox v3) hdtv media players that will go on top of your divx dvd player (or replace it entirely) which play the x264 mp4 and 720p mkv files. they're compact, too, about the size of a couple dvd cases

@ pss - you may have it confused with another ghostly series as you can see there are no previous mgs eps titled the uninvited

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Ghost_Story#Episodes

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7114485/My_Ghost_Story_-_Season_1-3#filelistContainer

the official name of these eps have always been a random title of story from the ep. as you can see there's not much info about season 4 on the www so i'm flying blind and guessing by picking the most intriguing sounding story title"
[V],psspss,2012-04-24T14:56Z,"actually the 2nd episode name is correct just the
first one"
[V],psspss,2012-04-24T15:01Z,"no im not confused
if you watch E02 your see
the title from E01 used in
it..

so the title in E01 is wrong
and should of been on the
the segment names inside
the episode

its not biggy though i kept the names as is

i was told to f-off in one of your torrents
so i thought I wouldnt be talking any more
to you about this stuff

this mp4s ripped fine this time.. not
sync issues at all.. but i think I moved
it by -100ms is all for the whole
not random sync issues at ad breaks
see you killed your first ones and re-upped
but they came out better then the last GA
one"
