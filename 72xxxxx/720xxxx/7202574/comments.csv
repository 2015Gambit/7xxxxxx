,DamnitDoll2012,2012-04-21T06:15Z,Can you also upload the the dead files special  that came on after ghost adventures!! Please EVERYONE missed the first one they did!!
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-21T07:39Z,i'd love to see that old xvid stuff get this kinda quality at this file size
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T07:43Z,did the audio drift after the first ad break? seems to hit the xvid convert but its minor and comes back in soon after
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-21T10:08Z,"uh... you could just watch the .mp4 yourself to see that it does not drift after the first ad break

on my pc's and ps3 it's all in sync"
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T10:37Z,"it drifts in 2 places not sure how your soft splices together each segment where ads when but sometimes it throws the same soft I use on other mp4s which always works on pretty flawlessly..
so something odd happens at ad breaks..
no biggy I cut it up resync and get a proper xvid up.. sometimes you dont notice things until fully watch a video

I dont have the mp4 anymore.. so cant compare"
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T10:39Z,"but making small mp4s is pointless tne
proper 720 or 1080p will always be 1gb or better

I cant see why xvids cant be made by you (stop following the pack:) and a 720p or higher for big screens. "
,ElGiddorah,2012-04-21T15:17Z,psspss: You do know the new scene rules when it comes to x264 SD-material right? :)
,ElGiddorah,2012-04-21T15:18Z,psspss: You do know about the new scene rules for x264 SD-material right?
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-21T18:03Z,"i don't use any software for encoding or merging

it's command line

i have watched this 3 times already on 2 pc's and a ps3

in sync all the way thru on all of them

it's your xvid that's out of sync not my mp4"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-21T18:15Z,"and ""proper"" is technically crf 21 or better by scene rules. crf 22 is close enough and i'm p2p so don't really have to abide those rules. even MOMENTUM will use crf 22 for some shows to keep the size under 400mb. the 720p of this episode is crf 20 and still under 1gb...
so ... yeah ... 

i have told you before why i don't do xvids; oversized, lack of quality, takes too long to make

you say i'm following a pack and guess what numbnuts so are you it's just my pack is much larger than yours. you plus a couple people are the only technologically declined turds that can't cope with x264.  i bet psspss doesn't even watch these; just converts it to xvid and trashes it without even noticing how great this looks at such a smaller file size.  and since he doesn't watch these if there's any fuck ups in his xvid he immediately blames it on the mp4

what a fuckin idiot now just piss the fuck off you annoying shithead"
[V],psspss,2012-04-22T04:32Z,"not so.. if you used some windows converters
you can knock out mp4 and xvids as fast
takes me about 8 min to convert to xvid
most files.. even 8gb mkvs

once you got a mp4 720p it would take you
8min to make a xvid from it.

but theres is a problem with the encodings
cos you dont see it dont mean others dont
there was some drop out in the ad break
the software saw it and it tried to fix and
resync putting it out by 100ms

if the same sof tworks fine on other cappers
mp4s then it cant be me.. is what im saying

not blaming you its prob a soft cliche
happens"
[V],psspss,2012-04-22T04:38Z,"and I do notice mp4 quality why I said
its good for 720p but as not just me
saying it.. making small mp4s is pointless
calling them HD. 360-480p .. xvid is better
but most of us dont need that better mp4 quality

and I dont have to swear and be nastey
like some either :)"
,Rizaria,2012-04-22T09:27Z,"Glad you're still recording these for those of us who need them. (Especially myself in Australia.)

These filetype squabbles are a tad silly.

I do have a problem though. It's not that I'm stuck in the past or anything, but I tend to watch Ghost Adventures with my family each week and the only method is via their DVD player which only supports .avi and .wmv. Otherwise mkv or mp4 would be fine for me, honestly on this computer or my PS3.

Noticed the DVD player supported iPod connection, so thought I'd download this MP4 and try that. It doesn't appear to be an iPod-compatible one. So regardless whether I download a release from you these days it seems I have to convert them? Bit of an annoyance. psspss' conversions aren't great, but at least the end result works.

Anyways, thought I'd put in my two cents. If you make a more iPod/iPhone compatible mp4 that'd be sweet though. Currently converting it myself but it's taking time I didn't want to waste."
,ldMdd,2012-04-22T20:59Z,"I normally don't post stuff on sites like these since I know most people here are just retarded and troll around but.....

I want to say (despite what others say) that the videos you bring out are of superb size and quality. So I'd like to thank you trialNerror that you bring great quality to us even though there are a lot of whiners on this site.

Psspss, just shut up, i got nothing else to say troll. Just because you don't know how to properly solve your problem its not TNE's fault. Better yet TNE gives you something for free...i can't see how you can even cry about it. If you dont like it just shut the fuck up and move along.

Rizaria, I quote ""Currently converting it myself but it's taking time I didn't want to waste. "" I bet TNE is thinking the same about not wasting time on reconverting everything just because you can't handle something your own. If you don't want to waste time Rizaria and be able to watch this with your family either buy a proper dvd system or buy the actual dvd (they are being sold on lots of places)

So please, shut up, stop QQ and move on....im so sick of you people.
I sometimes wonder why trialNerror is still uploading torrents here with all of you annoying cunts.

Thanks trialNerror, i hope you can forgive me for polluting this page...."
,driftBR,2012-04-23T16:11Z,"I watch this tv show but﻿ people should be aware these manifestations are mostly demons. They are everywhere trying to bring us to sin and away from GOD because there is no return for them. This is just﻿ one of the reasons why you should turn to JESUS﻿ CHRIST, since he died for all of us in order to save all people from sin and let us know how GOD really loves men, his creation, no matter what. READ THE BIBLE."
