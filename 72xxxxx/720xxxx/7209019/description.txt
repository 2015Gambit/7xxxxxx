t's been six years since their last release and the expectations grows high when Värttinä prepares to release new album entitled Utu (Mist) on 1 February.

The beloved group hasn't been on hold these past six years: they have been actively touring and they also made the music for the Lord Of The Rings musical. 

The line up has gone through some changes as the group today consist of Mari Kaasinen (vocals), Johanna Virtanen (vocals), Susan Aho (vocals), Matti Kallio (accordion, keyboard etc.) and Hannu Rantanen (double bass). The new record features appearances from Wimme, Sakari Kukko, Jaska Lukkarinen, Kukka Lehti and Matti Laitinen

If you like your folk in Finnish then these Finnish folk give it to you.
