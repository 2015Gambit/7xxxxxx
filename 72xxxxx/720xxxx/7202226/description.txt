Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with first-time filmmaker Kristin Canty on today's broadcast. Canty is the director and producer of Farmageddon: The Unseen War On American Family Farms, a documentary available at the Infowars Store. CantyΓÇÖs quest to find healthy food for her four children turned into an educational journey to discover why access to these foods was being threatened. What she found were policies that favor agribusiness and factory farms over small family-operated farms selling fresh foods to their communities. Alex also talks with Linda Faillace, author of Mad Sheep: The True Story Behind the USDA's War on a Family Farm. The book documents one family's struggle against a bullying and corrupt government agency that long ago abandoned the family farmer to serve the needs of corporate agriculture and the industrialization of our food supply. Faillace appears in Canty's Farmageddon. 

Alex also talks with journalist and author Paul Craig Roberts.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
