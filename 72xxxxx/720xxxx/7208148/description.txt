Beginning with Woodstock ΓÇÿ99, director Michelle Esrick has spent ten years documenting the life of Wavy Gravy.

Saint MisbehavinΓÇÖ journeys from the hills of California to the Himalayan Mountains to reveal the life of this one of a kind servant to humanity. The film blends WavyΓÇÖs own words with magical stories from an extraordinary array of fellow travelers both cultural and counter-cultural, revealing the man behind the clownΓÇÖs grin and the foolΓÇÖs clothing.

In Saint MisbehavinΓÇÖ Wavy is revealed more than the tie-dyed entertainer and ice-cream flavor namesake that often defines him in the popular imagination. Audiences will come to know the activist, the optimist, and the healer who reaches beyond political, economic, and cultural divisions in his commitment to social change and the alleviation of human suffering.

WavyΓÇÖs life is his message, serving as deeply needed inspiration that we can change the world and have fun doing it.
