Jack White - Blunderbuss 2012-BriBerY

Produced by Jack White and recorded at his own Third Man Studio in Nashville, 
Blunderbuss has been described by White as ΓÇ£an album I couldnΓÇÖt have released 
until now. IΓÇÖve put off making records under my own name for a long time but 
these songs feel like they could only be presented under my name. These songs 
were written from scratch, had nothing to do with anyone or anything else but 
my own expression, my own colors on my own canvas.ΓÇ¥
