Avengers Mythos [Marvel]


The origins of Earths Mightiest heroes collected! Marvel has produced some of the most mythic heroes of our time. Much like the pantheon of the gods cast a spell over the Greeks, the stories of the Marvel heroes and their populist underpinnings have become legend in the hearts and minds of generations of fans. But behind the adventure, action and pathos, who are these heroes? Why do they exist? And how did they come to be? These stories all capture the essence of Marvels most heroic and iconic characters. AVENGERS: MYTHOS captures the essence of Marvels most high-profile and iconic characters: Hulk, Captain America, Ant-Man & the Wasp, Luke Cage, Quicksilver & the Scarlet Witch, Vision and Thor.[2012]
