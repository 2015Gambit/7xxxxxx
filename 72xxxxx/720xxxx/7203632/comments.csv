@mentallyours...unfortunately YOU struck again too.  Listen, the purpose of posting comments is to either discuss the quality of the file or thank the uploader.  You have done neither, but yet you have spoiled the ending of the game for the rest of us.

Smarten up and have some respect for the community.  And yeah, there are Celtics fans here...namely me.  The reason they sat the starters is because the outcome of the game didn't matter as they had already won their division and clinched the #4 spot in the East.
