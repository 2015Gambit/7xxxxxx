Excellent book by Microsoft veteran Charles Petzold (author of "Programming Windows").

This books is about "how computer works". It covers electricity and electronics basics (like lamps and transistors), logical gates, boolean algrebra, microprocessor architecture, buses and bridges, assembly language and operation system basics. 

For those, who really want to know more about computes but not ready to read a lot of books:)
