Kiki RPG: Premium v1.0.3
Requirements: Android 2.1 and up
Overview: A new, beautifully rendered action RPG from the makers of the highly acclaimed ΓÇ¥Exitium: Saviors of VardoniaΓÇ¥. This cutely styled and wonderfully crafted RPG gives you the chance to utilize the powers of different creatures in your fight against a monstrous, re-awaking force of evil...


The land has been at peace for fourteen years, since the defeat and banishment of the Demon King. Young KiKiΓÇÖs parents, who were among the group of legendary Heroes that went to face the Demon King, never returned. But the peace is becoming increasingly uneasy; creatures are beginning to terrorise peaceful townsfolk and villagers, and there are rumors of an ancient evil emerging in a distant land.
Join KiKi on her adventures to find her missing parents and defeat the emerging threat, and, in the process, become the Hero sheΓÇÖs always wanted to be.
