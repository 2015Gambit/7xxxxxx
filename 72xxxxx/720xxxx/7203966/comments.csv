,sport762005,2012-04-25T22:25Z,i found a virus when i tried to install this game
,7f1pd0,2012-05-27T01:52Z,"Not a false positive.  A positive positive.

Got the notification that the files were virused as I ran them, like a fool, and then immediately my computer locked up, and guess what?  Wouldn't boot.  Luckily I had a recovery disk, but this is no false positive.

BEWARE."
