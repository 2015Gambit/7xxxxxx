 2011 | PDF | 450 pages | 2,9 MB

DESCRIPTION:

Every linguistic theory has to come to grips with a fundamental property of human language: the existence of exceptions, 
i.e. phenomena that do not follow the standard patterns one observes otherwise. The contributions to this volume discuss 
and exemplify a variety of approaches to exceptionality within different formal and non-formal frameworks.
