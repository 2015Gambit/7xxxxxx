,ahac00,2012-05-19T14:13Z,It seems to work! No viruses detected. Why do we have to overwrite the existing maple.dll with the older one? Thanks a lot.

,kf6d3,2012-08-29T20:55Z,i am also having problems with activation if i moved the license files why am i still being asked to enter a purchase code?
,zandbera,2012-09-23T22:22Z,"for those having trouble installing:

during installation, DO NOT select Activate. Select activate later and finish installing. Now go to Program Files > Maple 16. Put the license.dat file from the torrent in the license folder for Maple 16. Then, replace the maple.dll in C:Program filesMaple 16bin.X86_64_WINDOWS with the maple.dll from the torrent. Now when you start Maple, it should work fine. :)"
