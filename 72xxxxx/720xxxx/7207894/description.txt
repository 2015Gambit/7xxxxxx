The Spring 2012 anime season is kicking into high gear. Some shows have already started airing and a glutton will be arriving this week. This season has more shows that I want to check out than usual and as they air, I plan on writing a quick first episode impressions on them. Now, it's important to note that these are not reviews of the entire series. They are simply my quick opinion on on the impression that the first few episodes gave me.

Quick Summary
A high school graduate moves into an apartment building filled with crazy college kids.
Quick Thoughts
"It's only 3-minutes? Nooooooo!"
The opening theme was incredibly short for this series. That should have been the first sign. Anyways, this episode kicked off decent enough. The animation was good enough, the art style reminded me of Hanamaru Kindergarten a bit, which was a bit of a let down due to me having seen an image somewhere that looked like it was ripped straight from Scott Pilgrim. Anyways, things seemed decent enough to continue on and just at it seemed like it was going to start getting to the funny, the screen went black and I saw the familiar Crunchyroll "replay" symbol. I had no clue whatsoever that this was a three minute anime series.
Quick Verdict
2/5 Dropping It
Nothing really grabbed me, but it did seem like it was about to get pretty good before it ended. I'm not interested in watching a three minute series though and, unfortunately, I'll probably have completely forgotten about this once there are 30 minutes worth of episodes that could be watched back-to-back.
