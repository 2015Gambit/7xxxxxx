,WHIESNAKE,2012-05-20T13:43Z,"First - Thxs for all the great downloads Extremzone.

Any idea why this one triggers a Cinavia Message 3 and mutes audio?  This is the first of likely 100+ movies that has done this -- never seen it before.

It plays back just fine on the computer, but mutes the audio when playing back through our networked Samsung DVD player.  Just to be clear -- I'm accessing the video over a wired network connection.

Any chance someone could point me in the right direction to learn how to deal with this?

Cheers"
