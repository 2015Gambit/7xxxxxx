,johnson_lnrd,2012-04-21T16:21Z,"Hi Inspiron, I'm a big fan of your torrents since a long time ago but this is the first time I post a comment in your torrent, My country has bad internet speed so if it is possible can you please put the split and unsplit version in a different torrent? I really like your links as most of it are split but if this goes on my internet might not be able to support the download, sorry for bad english and thank you for reading it :)"
,petra7436,2012-04-21T18:30Z,"Hey Johnson, you can select what files to download and what not... if I am not wrong when using uTorrent... "
,erich.2312,2012-04-22T20:09Z,what does it mean that it is split?
,soccernamlak,2012-04-22T22:48Z,"As always, thank you inspiron!

erich.2312, ""split"" means that each track is a separate mp3 file, so while this is a mix (and thus continuous) CD, it's easier to navigate between songs in your music player.  This contrasts with ""unsplit"" which is where you have typically a single mp3 file per CD that includes all songs.

Hope that helps!"
,ashiman,2012-04-23T18:20Z,"hey guys, anyone knows a download link for unmixed version please??? and thanks alot inspiron! great work as always..."
[T],-inspiron-,2012-04-24T03:32Z,"GUYS THANKS SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING :) i really can count on you helping me in each way :)

@petra7436 : you are totally right, needs few seconds using Magnet link to download the list of the files then you choose not to download certain files :)

@ashiman : follow my fb page, the link is posted there, one of the followers helped and posted the link for the unmixed version :) cheers

@soccernamlak : thanks mate"
