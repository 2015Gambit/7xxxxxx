,GeerGoros,2012-04-23T07:04Z,"I was able to open the MPT.exe.

,IvanaCC,2012-04-23T10:54Z,"OK,I have done that.It says ok.So should I just close it now?"

,punchinbitches,2012-04-30T03:48Z,"Okay so I did everything y'all told me to do, installed, right click on Desk icon, open file loc., copy the MPT.exe activator into that folder. I run as administrator on the MPT in the desk folder and then open up FL10.5, it says it's a demo. So I click on the activator and the bottom left corner box says Reg, then C:/, then *** in blue, and then I go to the about thing to verify and it says it's still a demo, I go back to the activator and it doesn't respond (fails/crashes/etc.) it only crashes when I click it though, then it takes 5 minutes and the bottom box turns blue and says Reg C:/ and ***, i don't know what to do with that though? How do I fully register it?"
,frastard,2012-04-30T22:34Z,I copied MTP.exe into the installation dir and it still says it's searching for a file or something that it can't find.
,SpoogeBot,2012-05-09T20:37Z,"Can someone help me?
I moved the activator into the install directory, but it still asks me to find the file manually. When I select flstudiowhatever.exe, it pauses for like a minute, then tells me again to find the file. I tried all the executable files, just in case, and it gives up on those ones immediately. I'm confused."
[T],mdusanjay,2012-05-15T19:08Z,run in the activator in admin mode if u had any problem..right click and choose it.
,wakantanka7,2012-06-06T21:40Z,after u do everytin. close and open the software. It ll automatically change from demo. 
,wakantanka7,2012-06-06T21:40Z,@ mdusanjay. It works beautiful. Thanks dude. Bless
,CVPO677,2012-06-07T19:47Z,I can not find the activator. I apologize I am not very tech savy when it comes to this stuff.
,tsk351,2012-06-17T00:18Z,"Here's the solution to the problem I had..

With MPT.exe open, click the blue text that says ""junlajubalam"". That will crack the program. Then wait for the text in the bottom left hand corner to say ""OK"". Then close it, and start FL Studio."
,WickedMente,2012-06-18T00:32Z,"Or If You Got XP And You Can't Find The ""choose file location"", You Can Drag The MTP.exe On:
My Computer>Local Disk>Image-Line>FL Studio 10.5 BETA And Just Open The MTP.exe File When You Have Dragged it. THANKS."
,notospam,2012-06-20T08:10Z,"I can't get it off Beta. I've copied and pasted to MPT to FL file. Still have Beta ver. I tried opening MPT, and can't do that either. Any suggestions??? Please!! I want this bad and can't afford it."
,nicho1385,2012-06-28T10:09Z,thnx dude mdusanjay working 100% on my win 7 great upload... now seeding :)
,krofet,2012-07-03T04:55Z,"i downloaded this a month ago,it was working fine until yesterday!! but now is not working everytime i want to open it a window pops up saying that the program(fl studio) has expired!!!what wrong now!!!!"
,EgoRiot,2012-07-03T06:25Z,@Krofet me too! i was working on the zedd remix when this problem occurred! I would like for this problem to be fixed but the easiest way to temporarily fix it is simply changing the date on your pc or mac to before July 1st
,masternater,2012-07-05T05:49Z,this is expired beta version does not work
,pokejoey97,2012-07-07T00:12Z,"PLEASE READ! THIS IS A FIX TO THE EXPIRED PROBLEM!

Alright so FL Studio's beta uses a simple date check to protect the beta. The beta ended on July 1st. To fix this problem I created two batch files. One of them you use to change the date and then it runs the program. The other one you use after you are done using the program to change your date back to what it should be.

Just click the following link then extract the two files to your desktop. Double click ""launch.bat"" to launch the program and then when you are done double click ""time.bat"" to change the time back to how it should be.

https://www.box.com/s/5cf31110515db8ac6ea8

if FL.exe isnt saved to the location listed in the file then you will need to change the location in ""launch.bat"" to where you do have fl.exe 

Hope this helps!~"
,serjante,2012-07-19T09:33Z,"for WIN XP not working (This versin has expired, please check the lastest version.)... and yes i changed the location in ""launch.bat"" to where you do have fl.exe "
