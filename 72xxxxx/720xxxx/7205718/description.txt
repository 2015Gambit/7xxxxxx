5 selected episodes from Season 1 of the quirky sci-fi/horror series "WAY OUT" that was broadcast originally on CBS just before "The Twilight Zone."

These episodes were apparently created on a film chain, transferring original CBS affiliate film to videotape.  The original national commercials are included, mostly L&M cigs and Breck shampoo.  There are also some spots for "The Ed Sullivan Show."  The commercials are almost as entertaining as the series!

Quality is about as good as could be expected considering the source material and the fact that it's an obscure TV series over 50 years old.  If anyone has any more episodes I would love to add them to the torrent.

Enjoy....
