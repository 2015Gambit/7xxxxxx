,peacetin,2012-04-23T09:03Z,Let's hope this one doesn't have the same problem that the other one has.  
,RexRexroth,2012-04-23T09:11Z,"OK!  After some pretty disastrous uploads this morning, we finally seem to have a good quality .mp4 file.  I burn the shows to DVD in batches of three, and .mp4 seems to be the most reliable container.  .mkv files actually become larger when converted with DVD Flick and often exceed the capacity of a blank DVD, and I have synchronization problems with both .mkv and .avi.  I hope this helps someone, but this torrent seems to the best and most reliable for ""Mad Men"" S05E06.  Beware the Swedish torrent of SE05E05 which is mixed in (hard-coded Swedish subs and last week's program) and the corrupt .rar files - listed as SE05E07 (next week's program!) - as they will try to get you to ""unlock"" the files with a password which will really fuck up your computer.  I'll shut up now."
,RexRexroth,2012-04-23T09:13Z,"To peacetin: my computer shows a run time of 47:51 for this torrent, which means the Lifetime Channel stuff has been deleted."
,holyfool,2012-04-23T10:17Z,"eztv madness madmen torrents.

thanx!"
,ezup,2012-04-23T10:23Z,"I can never understand why eztv puts out files that are so small.  You need a least around a 1 gig file for decent HD quality.  I will wait for someone to post a real HD file. (Sometimes eztv puts out a bigger file later, so props for that)"
,blazblaz,2012-04-23T11:03Z,"Does anyone knows where subtitles can be found, I use to search them on tvsubtitles.net but they haven't the fifth season..."
,oblio4,2012-04-23T12:12Z,try Addic7ed.com for tv subtitles.
,The_bay_is_clear,2012-04-24T05:15Z,"This one has a weird unrelated vid interrupting the show in the middle of it. It resumes back to Mad Men after about a min of this other show. The odd show is also quite a bit louder than the Mad Men episode. Quite odd, but I found the same vid on a streaming ver of this vid too, so it's not unique to this torrent."
,AnimalLeopard,2012-04-24T10:11Z,Thanks! :)
,el8one,2012-04-24T16:22Z,"Garbage. This needs to be edited and resubmitted at minimum. Unless you enjoy being forced to deal 36 minutes into it with an intrusive infomercial for some trashy southern red neck corporate whorehouse Lifetime channel drama. 

It's hard to believe there are people that actually watch that shit, much less fill enough demand that it's actually recorded for download."
,deathtax,2012-04-26T05:16Z,Totally sucks ass. The channel is turned to LIFETIME in the middle of the show and the volume goes apeshit. It's not for a minute - it's for about 10.
,mwdr,2012-06-13T15:45Z,Thank you (eztv)
,molucid,2012-06-22T04:43Z,"molto grazie to the eztv folk(s) for your major body of work on so many series.  You all have done some *serious* work.  To the nit picking trolls bitching about some piss ant issue or another: buy the bloody DVD or STFU. Fools bitching about people's hard work, to provide *free* material, piss me off.  Thanks again, I do appreciate all the hard work."
