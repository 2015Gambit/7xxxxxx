my first upload was a remaster of a hifi video audio  tape, my next upload was upgraden of the same tape ,


I find now the original master cassette tape of a show of Johnny thunders and heartbreakers of 1985-11-08,

is a cassette SA-c90 TDK , the recorder is a sony wmd6c the mic is homemade model 1983, I listen both versions,
