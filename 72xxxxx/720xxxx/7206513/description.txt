Plot: When Bryan Brown, one of Cleveland’s most respected street hustlers, takes the wrap on a drug deal gone bad, it forces him out of the game and out of his family’s business. As his father Red struggles to rebuild their street credibility, his disappointment in Bryan lands him a one-way ticket to Atlanta. Bryan meets Ms. Bee, a shrewd club owner, who introduces him to a different kind of hustle. Impressed with how simple everything seems, Bryan is tempted, but not convinced. Eventually, Bryan finds gratification in using what he’s got to get what he wants.
