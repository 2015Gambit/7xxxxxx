Can a trusted person verify this please? I would greatly appreciate it. [Frankly the music DLC and Ruler Designer is all I need]"
,mkecr,2012-04-20T19:49Z,Any chance you could upload the DLC and patch by itself for those who already have the pre-DLC game?
,Itchiga,2012-04-20T21:10Z,"It says (when trying to edit) ""You need ruler designer DLC to do this"" or something like that ... Any help? "
,clamschop,2012-04-20T21:59Z,Anybody who downloads this deserves to get a virus for their stupidity.
,eurused,2012-04-20T22:29Z,If it says you need ruler designer just restart the game if that doesn't work then disable the all the dlc in the launcher and enable again worked for me
,Shintien,2012-04-20T22:54Z,Install it and it works with no virus but it'll just change the version to 1.05B. You can install the 1.05C from the launcher
,opaleg,2012-04-20T23:12Z,seems to work fine for me.. as far as installing and no virus. I scanned it too. Not even a false positive. That's a good sign when it comes to torrents.
,cannabian,2012-04-20T23:23Z,"Good torrent, just untick DLC's, start the game, quit, start again, tick DLC's, and enjoy :) (all hail pirate brothers!)"
,opaleg,2012-04-20T23:39Z,"the whole ""tick and untick"" thing isn't working for me. Whatever ends up working, how do I access the ruler designer anyway? "
,Valamyr82,2012-04-20T23:59Z,"Looks a little shady, probably clean but I wont risk it for now.

Regarding the music DLCs the 6 dlc songs are up on youtube! You can search for them and rip them out with http://www.clipconverter.cc/ as I did. Ive thought about torrenting them but its probably better to wait for someone who brought them to do so to avoid youtube-conversion quality issues."
,MP4SS,2012-04-21T04:56Z,"Great torrent! Works fine and updates from the launcher to 1.05c no probs, has the same checksum as the patch notes on Paradox forum.

Installer is in Russian, but it doesn't take a genius to work it out.

@opaleg

To untick you have to click the box to highlight then click again to remove the tick. make sure all boxes are not ticked and start the game then exit. After that you should see that the banner has gone when you restart the game again."
,opaleg,2012-04-21T07:39Z,"thanks MP4SS

Then I figured out that when choosing a ruler you can click the wrench-like button to design a new ruler.

All in all this torrent works perfectly. Please uprate this everyone that tested it out. There aren't any false positives either for me so there is nothing to worry about unless this has a super virus. Works 100%"
,TehZikel,2012-04-21T09:11Z,"Appreciate the effort for an installer like this, but could have really done with just the DLC. Other thank that it works perfectly, waited 2 days for someone kind hearted to upload this."
,Itchiga,2012-04-21T11:25Z,"Working nicely :) Norton didnt found any virus 


Anyone know how to bypass age limit while designing? :D"
,gfv1ct0r,2012-04-21T12:58Z,Works perfectly
,MP4SS,2012-04-21T16:20Z,"@itchiga

Cant go below age 16 cos of the educated trait in the bottom left corner of attributes, there isn't an option to remove it only change it.

I hope they change it the next patch :D"
,mayfist,2012-04-22T00:48Z,"@MP4SS

Well the patch launches ok for 105.c but when i start game i'm still stuck at 1.05b.... "
,greenleg,2012-04-22T03:10Z,"@mayfist
what the patch 1.05c do is make a new game folder inside your original folder, effectively having no effect whatsoever

Here is what you do. 
-You manually get the 1.05c patch from the game launcher, download it somewhere (desktop, etc...). 
-Run the patch, when it say where you want to install the patch file, choose your desktop
-Once patch finish, you should find a new folder on your desktop. It called ""Crusader Kings 2"". Go into this folder and COPY every file and folder you found.
-Now locate your game folder, mine is located at CProgram Files (x86)Crusader Kings 2. Yours could be different. 
-Once inside your game folder, PASTE every file you has copy before from previous step.
-???
-Profit"
,MP4SS,2012-04-22T16:39Z,"@Mayfist

As Greenleg has said you have to make sure the update goes to the right location. The update has probably installed into a different location to the main game.

Its best to uninstall the update via control panel and then re install the update to the right location or you'll have problems updating."
,daledenton,2012-04-22T17:35Z,"Works perfectly, thanks a lot!"
,halfchaos,2012-04-23T18:19Z,If someone could kindly upload the Ruler Designer DLC separately that would be great. Not a big deal though.
,halfchaos,2012-04-23T18:28Z,actually I do not suggest anyone download this. this installer is very strange. something doesn't seem right about it. it's not the same installer I used from other sources. DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK.
,gfv1ct0r,2012-04-24T16:38Z,"Why is it strange? Because of the letters? They are Russian, and your system writing style is Western or Central European, so you see different symbols. If you change it to eastern style, you will see cyrillic
There is no viruses.. I checked it with NOD32 and with some other antivirus programs.. No virus and works perfectly"
,falcie,2012-04-25T05:20Z,"World anyone mind being king enough to help me? I've downloaded the torrent, mounted the file and run the installer, but whenever I click the desktop icon for the game the evil, ever present error message comes up: ck2.exe - Unable To Locate Component: 'This application has failed to start because MSVCP100.dll was not found. Re-installing the application (which I've already done) may fix this problem.'

Does anyone know why this happens, and how I can fix it? I'm a bit of a noob and I'm desperate to play this game!! Thanks!"
,falcie,2012-04-25T05:30Z,"Woops, didn't do enough digging before posting and have fixed this now. If anyone else is having the same problem (Error message: MSVCP100.dll (or similar)) you can fix it by installing thing: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en...s.aspx?id=8328
For error message: 'd3dx9_41.dll (or similar) is missing' install this: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35
The difference between error messages is that the latter usually contains d3dx somewhere.
:)"
,falcie,2012-04-25T06:03Z,"One problem out, another in.
Not I've got a runtime error when the game first boots up. Can't get past the loading screens, I've updated, and tried running without the DLC and that doesn't help either :/

Can anyone help me? "
,sergio_sos,2012-04-26T18:06Z,"This torrent works fine mates!
Now I'm downloading the new version 1.05c to see if it works."
,halfchaos,2012-04-26T19:08Z,yeah this works fine. i just thought the installer was strange. sorry. I put up a repack for people that just want the dlc.
,NephilimNexus,2012-04-30T09:58Z,"Works fine, just like the last version.  Install screen isn't in English, but anyone with more brains than a carrot should be able figure out what the buttons do without any trouble.

Not too troubled by lack of separate DLC - at only 370megs, you'll have this downloaded in no time anyway.  Just erase your old one and/or do and overwrite.  No biggie.

Good torrent!"
,Moxthiro_Xeli,2012-05-01T06:23Z,"Guys I downloaded the game, mount it and when the ""strange"" installer appears I can't press anything... It's not stuck but it's impossible to click at russian ""next"" or the ""exit"" or whatever.
Anyone with this problem? :s"
,halfchaos,2012-05-07T06:35Z,neph the russian text wasnt the strange part. the installer looks like its 3rd party. its different from the skidrow release. thats why I thought it was strange.
,sergio_sos,2012-05-29T01:54Z,"Guys, the torrent is excellent. Once you install this, you can download any new update, patch or fix and keep the game up to date.
And the installer worked fine for me the two times I installed this. Mount the image with Daemon and execute the installer, just press the button and select the folder and that's it!"
,ndonic,2012-06-02T12:03Z,perfect upload thanks
,Krakk3n,2012-06-04T18:39Z,"Haven't had much activity for awhile on this torrent -- but I just installed the 1.05g patch and it looks to be running fine!

Great torrent, thanks for the upload!"
,kaeim,2012-06-07T19:58Z,"In response to Krakk3n, I would advise strongly to anyone installing patch 1.05 to not do it. The patch does work, however, the game consistantly crash at random times, sometimes almost as soon as you start the game, sometimes for years (ingame obviously).

Unless anyone knows a way to install the patch in a way that doesn't screw the game up (or knows a torrent with 1.05 installed)?"
,Panzer4183,2012-06-07T20:04Z,"I have installed game from this torrent , but i have a problem with text in game and colors , text is filled with black dots and colors are wired,like rainbow splash on a  map . I have Ati Hd 7450 M 1gb ddr and i5 processor  Any help?"
,magnum1234,2012-06-09T05:40Z,Which is the ruler designer dlc I don't see it and dlc 005 is only 1 kb with nothing in it
,kentcave,2012-06-10T05:24Z,Thanks mate. What a wonderful complete torrent..absolutely PERFECT!
,OGCroflAZN,2012-06-15T10:21Z,"i'm having and issue. It's not really a big deal, but it's bugging me. I like starting at this specific county. I made my character and got everything set up and when i go to play, my character's hairstyle is something different than what i chose. I reinstalled and did everything exactly the same but this time my character is coming out bald. Does anyone know how to fix this? If not, does anyone know how to edit the save to change my character portrait?"
,Sathyro,2012-06-17T17:47Z,"So i downloaded everything but the game doesnt detect the dlc. do i need to do something with them? install them? copy them? 

sorry for my english"
,sergio_sos,2012-06-30T01:36Z,"Report: since the new patch 1.06 the coat of arms of the main dinasties are ok, but the rest are messed up, just ugly.
Anyone experiencing the same issue? Any solutions?"
,kentcave,2012-06-30T07:47Z,"Yes..coat of arms changes or might be errors. The text report of patch 1.06 mentioned these changes..and probably its actually not graphical errors, but intended as the ""return"" to ""real"" historical coat-of-arms, instead of the previous ones of modern interpretations. At least I am speaking from the Kingdom of England experiences. Look over it, from Anglo-Saxon kings till Sweynd and back to Wessex Kings and HCnuts till ""the Confessor"" and Harold Godwin. Its actually more historically ""correct"". @,-p.."
,sergio_sos,2012-06-30T20:21Z,"@ kentcave thank you for your answer. I will take a look at that more carefully.
But the ones I checked out are now incorrect, i.e. Boulogne dinasty (first kings of Jerusalem)
And I also see that this CoA change in every game I start, so that can't be rigth.
Let's hope the russian friends would come out with a new repack and a solution.
Cheers!"
