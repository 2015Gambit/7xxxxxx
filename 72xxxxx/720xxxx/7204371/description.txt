    Henry Hill is a small time gangster, who takes part in a robbery       
    with Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito, two other gangsters who have      
    set their sights a bit higher. His two partners kill off everyone      
   else involved in the robbery, and slowly start to climb up through      
   the hierarchy of the Mob. Henry, however, is badly affected by his      
    partners success, but will he stoop low enough to bring about the      
                      downfall of Jimmy and Tommy?
