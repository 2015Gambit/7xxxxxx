,aprentiso10,2012-04-23T15:37Z,"Doesn't nessecarily have to be a fake. It's just not the movie you guys think you're looking for. It's on TPB yet. This is actually a remake (or repost) of the old cartoon version. Not the one where all you're favorite actors are in. ^^ And if it isn't compatible to play with windows media player then fuck it, not worth the download. "
,aprentiso10,2012-04-23T15:38Z,It's not on TPB yet** :)

@aprentiso10 

You people are fucking idiots, a .cbr is a standard comic book archive, IT'S NOT A MOVIE YOU FUCKING RETARDS, stop calling shit fake just because you're morons."
,noraku,2012-04-24T19:02Z,"@aprentiso10...windows media player is crap,try using VLC player.A much better player than WMP....:)"
,spaceballz2010,2012-04-25T06:52Z,"i KNOW, my bad, i had two windows open at the same time, and i was checking the uploader for the avengers the movie and leaving comments on the fake ones, i am a total dick idiot, i admit it, i left the comment on the wrong torrent and i apologize to the uploader.  I was searching his other uploaded torrents and when i clicked back i think i went back to many times and left my comment on wrong page, so let me have it guys.  I will take it like a man because i did screw up bad.  Please accept my apology mdusanjay this comment was not meant for you.  "
,spaceballz2010,2012-04-25T06:54Z,"I always warn people of fakes, and i swear this is the first slip up ever.  I searched avengers the new movie and this was one of the ones i went to, but i went past it and found a real fake but my back button is right on the mouse and clicked it to many times, and should of double checked before leaving that comment.  Again sorry guys/gals.  So i will not get mad at any comments you all throw at me because i really disserve it."
,spaceballz2010,2012-04-25T06:59Z,"i didn't look for movie in comic section i searched the movie title and got a ton of fakes so was leaving comments for the real *** holes who disserve them, This guy does not disserve a bad rep.  I even just downloaded it so i could say it is legit.  So please disregard my stupidity.  How many people would come back and admit their mistake though so please dont be to hard on me, there are a lot of dicks on here that for one have crashed my computer many times with their bull shit.  I try to call the fakes out as i see them so people dont run into the bull**** i have."
