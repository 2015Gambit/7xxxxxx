,tflagger997,2012-07-11T17:16Z,"This is not 1080p.  It may have come from that source, but this is only 800p (1920*800).  

Also, in the info you say that it came from 720p, and even have 720p as a tag.  I think you originally were correct since 800p is much closer to 720 than 1080.

For everyone - The resolution = X * Y where Y = 720, 1080, etc.  So if you see X * 800 then it is a bit better than 720 but not 1080.  If you see a X * 544 it is not a 720 (many claim it is).  Check Wiki or Google if you want, then make sure to drop a comment when you see the wrong labels.  

We appreciate the posts, but without proper labels, this site would be a total mess full of flames and fakes."
