This is a GREAT documentary (also freely available on YouTube and elsewhere) about what a scam the modern college system has become in the past few decades.

Everything from the textbook scams, to the insane debt, to the media lies about how college grads make "A million more dollars over the course of a lifetime!" are thoroughly and convincingly exposed.  

Please watch, enjoy, thing about it, and then share it with others.  Today's youth should be learning productive crafts and trades which you can usually do for free online.  They should not be wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars on useless degrees!
