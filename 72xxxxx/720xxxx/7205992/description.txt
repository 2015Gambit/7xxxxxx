"PM me for a torrent link to the full set of high quality art. I am missing HE5 rare Wasp Archers and Pre-Imperial Motto Seiki art. Otherwise there is a high quality image for every card in the database. If someone can setup the torrent link on this site, I will be happy to seed for a long time. It was 10 days of work to get the missing data!"
