Greg Hampton (producer of the Tommy Bolin Whips and Roses CDs) and Warren Haynes (GovΓÇÖt Mule, Allman Brothers) have co-produced sessions with some of the worldΓÇÖs most famous and revered guitarists and singers for their Tommy Bolin tribute 2-CD set titled Tommy Bolin and Friends - Great Gypsy Soul. Fabrizio Grossi (Whips & Roses I & II, Glenn Hughes) was also on board as Associate Producer/Mix Engineer. ItΓÇÖs been inspiring to learn that all of these legendary guitarists are all fans of Tommy, and were excited to add parts to original Tommy Bolin multitrack tapes that have never been made public.
