I use a Transfer Cap; I upload 7 gigs a day. This is why I upload a new torrent every other day or so. I do this to keep my IP off my back as they have initiated a monthly limit. It usually takes me two days to fully seed a torrent so please be patient.

SYNOPSIS:  
Propaganda notwithstanding, director Sergei M. Eisensteins masterwork remains a cinematic landmark, charting events that ultimately led to the Bolshevik Revolution. Fed up with the ships officers brutalities and with maggot-infested rations, the crew of the battleship Prince Potemkin revolts. The rebellion ignites an uprising by the citizens of Odessa, resulting in czarist troops infamous, systematic slaughter of insurgents and bystanders.

I upload my torrents to The Pirate Bay and Demonoid, if you would like to upload one of my torrent files to another tracker feel free, all I ask is that you upload the same torrent file you downloaded by clicking on one of my links so that more seeders/peers are in the swarm.
