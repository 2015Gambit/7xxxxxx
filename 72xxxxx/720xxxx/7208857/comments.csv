,ccoltmanm,2012-05-18T01:52Z,"How is this torrent? Quality +1, or -1?"
,Krisiun,2012-05-19T22:40Z,Works just fine
,arkymarky,2012-05-20T16:49Z,"cant get this thing to work....having this ""software license  checkout failed"
,xmarioz25,2012-06-03T07:12Z,"Why is it 9.28 GB if you say ""Dimensions / Size: 3.5 / 3.63 GB"""
,touto360,2012-06-05T19:54Z,"9.28GB= x32 + x64   
get it xmarioz25 you stupid fuck :D"
,xmarioz25,2012-06-06T07:33Z,"touto360, you at math.
I know it's x32 and x64 but 3.5 + 3.63 = 7.13 not 9.28"
,xmarioz25,2012-06-06T07:34Z,you fail*
,Knight_Auron2,2012-06-13T00:13Z,Can you upload 3DS Max 7. I want it to be english please.
,ragecorn,2012-06-13T01:39Z,Tried to install 3 times with both x64 & x86. It prompted for a 2nd disc and there is no 2nd disc. Maybe I'm just stupid or there really is no 2nd disc/iso. It's pointless.
,ragecorn,2012-06-13T01:47Z,"Edit: To anyone using powerISO

1. Mount the image file
2. Copy the disc's content to your hard drive
3. Start the installation.

Very important: If you try to install from the actual/virtual DVD, it will ask you to insert disc halfway through installation, so you should copy all the contents of the DVD to a folder on your HDD and run the setup from there. 

//got it from a website//"
,lif3isfr33,2012-06-13T04:55Z,lol at all the noobs. Who burns stuff to DVDs these days? All I do is open the .iso with .7zip.. or any unrar extraction tool and save them on my computer inside a folder. I do that with all my .iso downloads. I been poweriso free for 3 years. Thank you very much. My life has been easier. :)

Wow congrats on being retarded!"
,lif3isfr33,2012-06-17T00:00Z,I'm retarded cause I chose not to use DVDs or iso programs like poweriso or daemon tools? FU
,Conchas,2012-06-24T21:23Z,"Almost fine!

I'm installing it on a VM.
However the patch doesn't seem to work. It says I must do it after the activation window to appear, which is exactly what I'm doing...
The the generated key seems to be a few characters short and of course it doesn't succeed. Anyone can help?"
,stiv100,2012-06-25T13:07Z,"Try running the keygen as administrator. Turning UAC off might be also helpful. 
 As for the length of the password I have no idea what to do with it. So I am also stuck.
 (Hopefully) I faced another problem of an error that appeares once I launch the 3ds max. 
 It sais
 ""The software license check out failed. error 20""
 so at least I have something to occupy myself with and not to bother with password length."
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-06-29T05:46Z,"@ lif3isfr33
Yeah, that does make you a retard.

Why download an iso and unzip it, when you can download an iso and run it?

Just open the iso, and bang - you have the contents on a virtual drive.

Also, many installers don't give you the option of selecting where the iso is. So if you download something with 2 iso files, when it asks for iso 2, what the fuck are you going to do?

Also, what if the software requires the iso to be mounted? Still plenty of software that checks for a cd - which works when mounted. And no-cd cracks don't always work for the versions you have.

So yes, it makes you retarded. 

Each iso is around 4.49GB. Not sure why its been declared less."
,DrOfDoom,2012-06-29T22:39Z,"Just curious, does this use multiple cores efficiently? I have a multi-core AMD CPU and don't want it to render slowly because it only utilizes one core."
,xeno12,2012-07-03T00:22Z,Small word of Advice. I mounted the x64 Iso and started to install. It said I needed Net 4.0 And I clicked update in installer. After 1 min things starts to shut down and then it did a typical crash/reset. I couldn't boot. I fired up my backup partition finding that my entire bootPartition of C: was gone. So be cautious. It could be a crash failure of my SSD disk but the behavior before it went down was a bit suspicious. Just to let you know. 
,winklaura,2012-07-18T23:12Z,"Thanks for the torrent!  I could use a little help   installing...I have powerISO and am getting the same error as everyone else, asking for the second disk.  So I followed ragecorn's advice and that is not working for me either.  

Any ideas anyone?  I'd really appreciate it."
,winklaura,2012-07-19T00:09Z,"I went ahead and downloaded DT and that solved my problems.

,xdisciplex,2012-07-25T21:10Z,guys does this work??
,ZombieMonkey23,2012-07-28T21:34Z,Hey I got a solution for the people that can't get the crack working. Make sure to copy the crack you need onto your computer. Don't run it from the cd!
,kakuzu,2012-08-11T04:45Z,"The generated code from keygen does not work. I've tried it like atleast 10 times but it hasn't worked, is there another program to be used? Also below are instructions to get this going till I couldn't get any farther.


For those still clueless about the process I'll write it out. I however and also stuck on a part to, I'll stop there.

1. Make sure you have a virtual cd program like daemon tools, or something like that. Once this is done downloading if your computer is 64 bit it can use both 32 and 64, if its 32 it only uses 32. So mine is 64 so I chose 64. Once its mounts the cd go to ""my computer"" and you'll see it there. Something will pop up usually asking if you want to run it or view files, DO NOT RUN IT PRESS VIEW FILES. After that copy everything you see in this folder and make a another folder in your harddrive and past it all in there.

Now in this folder in your harddrive click set up and install from there. Not from the virtual mounted thing. From here in that same folder you'll find another thing that says ""Crack"". Open that for the next instructions on the keygen and getting the code."
,madleafs,2012-09-10T18:48Z,"d/l and install but keygen doesn't generate a key when running as administrator.
says 'paste request here'
what do we put?
thanks for help"
,PC101,2012-09-22T05:13Z,"Webchella, can you fill us in with a more thorough tutorial if our keygen says we don't have ""permission to access this file"" when selecting x64 keygen plz? Tried running as admin"
