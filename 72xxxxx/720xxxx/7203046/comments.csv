Sorry, i cant seem to find that."

This torrent:
-gives you some free credits so you can buy 2 color packs
-removes ads

Would be nice to have an exploit to keep adding credits by re-activating the full version or something along those lines, but it might not be possible.

Thanks again Alex!"
,ksnewland,2012-04-22T20:41Z,"Hmm, maybe it's only 50 free credits and I already had ~500 somehow? Not sure how I would... but I tried activating on my friend's account and they only got +50 credits, not enough for anything. Oh well!"

It would be hard to somehow cheat and get free coins.

On iOS, there was an exploit you could use, but then was quickly fixed.
The coins are server side so there's no easy way to go about it."
