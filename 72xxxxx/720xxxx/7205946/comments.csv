Patch the fucking thing and then use the serial!

Wow!

,senseinai,2012-04-22T18:24Z,"I put the app on my desktop and didn't run it; ran the  keygen, it automatically filled in my name; clicked 'patch' and then generated/copied s/n; ran the app, it accepted the serial and all is well."

,kidvilla,2012-05-06T03:16Z,"on a macbook pro 10.7.3, fresh install:
drop Path Finder in Applications
run CORE Keygen, select ""patch"" option
locate Path Finder in Applications folder and patch
launch Path Finder, it asks for name and serial
CORE keygen has name, so just generate serial
insert name/serial in Path Finder activation dialog
Path Finder opens without a hitch. 
======
just for fun, making an applications subfolder for ""other utilities"" and dropping Path Finder in there. 
launch it from this ""moved"" location and it still works fine."
,pruizw,2012-07-05T22:28Z,"Followed kidvilla's instructions. Other than the fact that Path Finder ""knows"" the serial provided by the keygen has been registered to thousands of people, it runs fine."
