In depth interview with former D.o.D. research librarian Douglas Dietrich. Douglas was exposed to highly secretive documentation as part of his role to catalogue and destroy items at the Presidio Military Base in San-Francisco. This base was essentially the venue for the creation and hosting of the United Nations until it moved to New York, where it remains today.

This 3 hour discussion was divided into 3 sections:

   A new take on the 'UFO crash' at Roswell in 1947 and it's role in the post-war era.
   The fate of the Axis powers, British and US roles in Antartica and 'Operation High Jump'
   Roots of narco-trafficking as a black-budget source, Opium Wars, Tesla and Yugoslavia

Although some of his perspectives and historical revisionism may appear suspect to some, there is no doubting that Mr Dietrich has an unparalleled ability to process a given context highly fluidly with the ability to weave connections seamlessly between them. If you follow-up this discussion with some of your own research, you'll find more often than not that his ideas are valid. Where possible we attempted to clarify what was found in the documents at Presidio and what elements were from his additional investigation or experience of the various points made.
