Fix Febuary - March

Lime Wire Pirate Edition Version 5.6.2

I am not sure if you need the older fix as well, if you do, just let me know and I'll post the torrent

Hopefully Limewire will eventually stay up.

Basically, it is a still a good way to sample radio quality music.

Bought music on cd still rules, getting original with cover and inserts is great.

You are a sucker to buy on itunes.  They only have mp3 quality same as lime.

If they had a loss-less format on itunes, that would be different.


I have included both win and mac versions here, no sense in having 2 torrents
