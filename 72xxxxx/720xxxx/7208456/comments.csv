,Zakaseq,2012-04-23T22:39Z,"This won't play on my BDT 210 on a USB stick! Episode 1-3 worked great with IMMERSE, but NONE of these AVS encodes work. WHY? :("
,tjaffz,2012-04-24T00:39Z,This AVS release can't be played with any of the ordinary players that I have used with > 400 MKV files before. IMMERSE works but not AVS releases.
