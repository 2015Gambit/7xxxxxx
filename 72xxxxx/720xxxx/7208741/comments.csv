,Toil25,2012-04-23T13:58Z,"Well, it's not fake, but the link to retrieve the password directs users to a bogus site. Avoid this torrent. "

,storvesir,2012-04-23T17:02Z,"Thanks, finally one that plays on xbox!"
,tflagger997,2012-04-23T17:55Z,"Everyone is saying it is a fake because the second person to post this episode yesterday used EXACTLY THE SAME NAME.  All of these people were scammed into DLing a POS with a RAR and TXT file in it, that asked for them to fill out a survey to get the pass for the RAR.

TvTeam just re-upped the torrent and stripped the RAR-crap.  If they had labeled it differently then there would be no confusion (such as adding - No RAR to the tiltle).  

So is this legit - Yes.  Just start the DL and click on your Files tab to see there is no RAR (and no password needed - unless some A-Hole figures out how to pass protect an avi)."
,MMusic123,2012-04-23T18:11Z,"You people are silly calling this fake  It is NOT fake, it's a proper HQ 549 mb avi file.  I downloaded it and it plays fine.  So cut out the nonsense. If you are concerned...then just download the main avi file only.  and let these chumps chew on it!   Thanks TV team  I appreciate it."
,csabaxb,2012-04-23T18:46Z,"Good torrent. Clean avi file. A/V-9. NO PASSWORD, NO RAR. Thanx uploader and seeders."

,McKosto,2012-04-23T19:33Z,"The torrent is just fine. The avi, a sample, and 2 txts. No codes or anything.. F@cking spammers..."
,chin0,2012-04-23T19:42Z,"those who know the password, please say it."
