,spockdaz,2012-04-21T23:20Z,"I would seed if i could get it, also stuck at 2.3%."

,LaurynasG,2012-04-27T16:55Z,Can someone help me? I'm stuck on 99.7%. 
,MrJuglar,2012-04-27T21:50Z,"Im stuck too in 99,7%... damn it"
,LaurynasG,2012-04-28T15:58Z,Don't download this torrent. It is much like a fake.
,waves_user,2012-04-28T22:48Z,"@laurynasG
No, it is not a fake, I would not waste my time or yours uploading garbage, why is the download slow? I have a hard time seeding, but I am doing my best so everyone be patient"
,spockdaz,2012-04-29T00:26Z,"Laurynasg, the reason why it takes so long with a torrent initially is because it is a lot of bandwidth for the uploader to seed everyone, that is why waves user has been uploading in sections. Thanks waves user, seeding...."
,westcoastst,2012-04-29T04:52Z,"Don't bother with this version.  The Main install appears to be Waves 9v2, but the crack clearly says Waves 9v1. The plugins are the same versions as The waves 9r1 I had.  "
,LaurynasG,2012-04-29T12:40Z,"Sorry for a bad comment. I was realy nervous that Day, when I stuck 99,7%.
In any case is beter to wait for a while.
Thanks and sorry again. ;)"
,spockdaz,2012-04-29T17:06Z,"The main install is v9r2, the crack is v9r1, that's why the extra cracked non linear summing (nls) files are there, which makes it fully cracked v9r2. Installed, all unlocked and working perfectly in windows 7 32bit, cheers."
,waves_user,2012-04-30T09:01Z,"@westcoastst
I cleared the misconception on Demonoid and I will clear it here too, i renamed the crack, because i created several torrents for here and other sites, it is the v9r1 repack crack from assign and yes it is the v9r2 offline installer fro waves.com"
,spockdaz,2012-05-14T04:56Z,"Thanks again wavesuser for the great upload. Could you or someone from demonoid send me an invitation, I would like to register and thank some of the uploaders there too, thanks... spockdaz@hotmail.com"
,spockdaz,2012-05-18T14:49Z,"Awesome, thankyou."
,jlird808,2012-06-15T05:21Z,"I got it all installed and it looks right, but in Cubase I can SEE the plugins but when I click on them...nothing happens. Only NLS plugins work ironically. 

Does this have something to do with the Waveshell thing lol...Idk much about that :(

Windows 7 64bit"
,jlird808,2012-06-15T05:48Z,"OK I dropped the waveshell.dll on the waveshell.exe and it looked like it made all the necessary .dll's. Still nothing happens when I select them as inserts in Cubase.

Also, no King's Microphone?"
,waves_user,2012-06-15T07:58Z,"@jilrd808
ok lets see if we can fix this. The Kings Microphones would be under an EQ fx category, also when you select what to install choose the SSL Mercury, and the kings (its under the single plug-ins at the bottom of the list) try re-installing cubase (lets cover all our bases) then re-install waves"
,waves_user,2012-06-15T08:09Z,"... I also found this ""if it's not seeing the plug-ins, go to Devices>Plug-in Information, click Update Plug-information"". If necessary, refresh the plug-in path. Try jBridge program, and try using the 32-bit versions if you can, switch the cubase directory for waves"
,jlird808,2012-06-15T23:03Z,"@waves_user Thanks for replying. I've ""Updated Plugin Info"" several times, restarted Cubase, ""updated"" again, no luck. I feel like I'm close bcz I can SEE all the delicious Waves plugins in Cubase when I click on an insert to select an effect plugin. Something to do with the shell not linking the .dll to the actual plugin?

When I first installed Waves V9.exe was I supposed to install the License Center? Bcz I didn't. 

The NLS install process was slightly different from every other program...NLS works great!

I'll look for King's Mic under EQ...at work right now.

Thanks!!! jlird808@gmail.com if thats easier ;)"
,waves_user,2012-06-16T06:10Z,"@jlird808
try running compatibility mode for cubase,have you used older versions of waves and what cubase are you using now?,also I did some research, have you upgraded you graphics card drivers?that might help with ""hang"" issues. I thing the WLC installs either way, but having it installed does not effect ""licensing"" or usage the crack takes care of that! let me know if that helps"
,waves_user,2012-06-16T06:15Z,"...this might also help shed some more light:

,jlird808,2012-06-16T23:47Z,"@waves_user Using Cubase 6.5.1 in Windows 7 x64bit. Im just operating the 32bit version of Cubase though to keep things simple. I suppose I should at least try the 64bit version.

I tried to restore my PC to an earlier time to retry the whole process. I still see the API and GTR3 bundles there and I CANT uninstall them 4 some reason. I may have had these bundles earlier too...I had them b4 and am not sure if theyre my origs or from this Mercury bundle.

When I uninstalled the ""previous version"" of Pro Tools, there were still some lingering Waves stuff I didnt uninstall. I think it was just like some smaller Waves bundles I had from before.  Should I have uninstalled EVERY Waves folder completely? Should I delete anything associated with Waves from my PC and start again?"
,jlird808,2012-06-17T00:12Z,"Idk what Cubase ""compatability mode"" is...I dont think there is one. Ive been using Cubase about 7yrs now. 

And so yes, I def have had older versions of Waves bundles on my PC and I didnt uninstall some. I think my big Mercury bundle was v5? I uninstalled that and deleted the registry thing. But yes, some Waves folders were lingering...."
,waves_user,2012-06-17T03:59Z,"@jlird808
I meant the windows 7 comp. mode, try an earlier xp version, and just to be on the safe side, try getting rid of every waves associated file, and then re-install  "

These dont work in ptools 10.2...dae error comes up 3512. They do work, but when i opened older sessions with several instantiations of waves plugs it disabled existing plugs and said running out of system resource, had to load v8 back on..."
,waves_user,2012-06-18T07:47Z,"@proof2
I'm running Pro Tools 10.2 with waves 9 flawlessly, I had a similar problem like this with BDF Lite, I had to delete 2 fxshared.dll files that conflicted with loading the plug-in. if you really want v9, try re-installing PT and Waves. Trash EVERY file from both programs and try again."
,jlird808,2012-06-19T01:49Z,"Hey waves_user...thx for all ur help but I gotta finish a couple projects b4 I try to tackle this again. Reinstalled my older version of Waves for now....

I'll keep u posted! BIG thx again for helping us all out!!"
,waves_user,2012-06-19T08:09Z,"@jlird808
Yeah no problem, let us know if you end up finding a fix"
,Pre1990,2012-06-23T17:44Z,"I installed and everything worked fine...until today! I used 3-4 plugins from waves and then the fifth plugin it appears in a blank box.....any idea plz ???

THX"
,waves_user,2012-06-25T07:46Z,"@pre1990
what DAW are you using? Sometimes I have a similar problem with FL Studio 10.5 and jbridge, in Pro Tools everything works fine, but its VST thats sometimes unstable. I open plugins and some ""close unexpectedly"", the one thing that helps( if you are using VST) is to switch from 32-bit and 64-bit (VST 2-3 also help)"
,Pre1990,2012-06-25T09:43Z,"I use cubase 5 and I have windows 7 64-bit ! I unistalled the waves complete and installed it again!  I think it's ok now !!! 

THX anyway :)"
,jlird808,2012-06-26T04:51Z,"Hey waves_user...I'm back lol.

I got it all to work ;) Just took my time and deleted EVERY waves file on my PC, ran registry cleaner, then deleted the registry keys u mention.

BUT...NLS isnt working this time. I didn't drag over the folders like I did the first time. I just dragged the two .dlls. I think before I dragged over EVERYTHING that was in the NLS folder. Should I drag everythin g over again? Afraid to jinx the other good stuff!!

So NLS asks me for licenses...but everything else is DOOOOPE!!!! THX AGAIN!!

W7 x64 Cubase 6.5.1"
,waves_user,2012-06-26T08:29Z,"@jlir808
Well, ideally it would be best to do what you did before that made it work, in this case the entire NLS files, if worst comes to worst, waves stops responding like before after you install NLS then you know what caused the problem the first time, then you can find a new work around if that does happen"
,jlird808,2012-06-27T00:35Z,"@ waves_user......we're in business!!  

Maybe the language in the .txt was a little hard cuz it said to drag over the files, not the folder. I dragged over the .dll files AND the NLS.Bundle folder from within the Waves NLS folder...kinda confusing.

THX AGAIN!!! Now I just gotta figure out how to use all this stuff ;) !!!!!
"
,Pre1990,2012-06-27T11:35Z,"@jlir808

It's not that difficult bro....you only have to copy the files from the folder that says NLS content or bundle I don't remember and then paste them in the folder that you have installed the NLS and then everything will work fine! ^_^ 

@ waves_user 

sorry my friend but I still have the same problem with the waves 9....after using 2-3 vst as an insert the fourth one appears in a blank window...actually I'm working in a specific project and there is where my problem appears...I'll keep your file in my pc and hope that I'll use them in the future, for now I'll have to use waves c. 8

THX for this torrent my friend

P.S If anyone has a problem with unistalling the waves files you can download 'Your Uninstaller'. This program deletes anything that you want from you pc very easy, I used this program to unistall waves c. 8  in order to install waves c. 9 ^_^"
,ktuba345,2012-07-27T07:07Z,"I just installed it as per the instructions. It is working just fine on Cubase 6.5. THANK YOU, THANK YOU so much to everyone who worked on this torrent!! "
,cccira,2012-08-26T15:33Z,"Can anyone explain this... yesterday a few sites denied access to my ip adress (project honeypot etc.). I did a full system scan with Kaspersky endpoint 8 and it found a bunch of trojans in waves .rar and installed files. I don't know how since I scanned the files when I originally downloaded them.
Besides that, everything was working fine through Cubase 5."
,waves_user,2012-09-04T07:28Z,"@cccira
Well, I have had issues with viruses in the past, and a some point of infection even the most trustworthy exe files (iTunes install..ex..) were detected having trojans, I have not experienced any issues with my torrents, this may be something outside of this rar."
,Oathstalker,2012-09-17T13:18Z,"By the way, anyone has a cracked version of Pro Tools 10? There seems to be only Pro Tools 9 available"
,X_LARGE,2012-09-17T17:58Z,"@waves_user Hey bro, I did everything as instructed, even tried some of the things people tried on the comments. Everything installs fine and it comes up on my DAW (adobe audition 3) but when I refresh the VST list it asks for a license. Any Help?"
,X_LARGE,2012-09-17T18:07Z,"@waves_user also, i noticed there was a crack file, but the instructions mention nothing about using it? thanks again, appreciate your help!"

Im having a problem with the plug-ins. I followed all the instuctions, I was using Verson 8(i think) and worked perfectly. Cleared the registry, deleted all the Wave files in the hard drive. I followed all the instructions for installation, the plug-ins are there in Sonor 6 Producer, and they do work. BUT i can only see a small parts of the plug-ins, and when i drag open the window its just blank, the plug-in does in fact work. i just cant see it"
