I see you're taking requests - would you be able to get the Curse Workers series by Holly Black (White Cat, Red Glove, Black Heart)?
Or maybe Graveminder by Melissa Marr?

Any of these would be GREATLY appreciated! 
Thanks"

Would you have
The Lost Wife by Alyson Richman"
,reservoirdog00,2012-04-22T08:45Z,"Thanks for all of your uploads, I can't find any other uploader that has quality ebooks like yourself.
You said you take requests, does that apply to the B&N digital comics as well?  If so would it be possible to get any marvel nook comic books? They average $10 a book!  The price for an entire series would be outrageous.

Thnx "
