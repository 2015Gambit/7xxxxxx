,[khemist],2012-04-23T05:30Z,i am always buying the newest blu-rays and need the most recent version of this program to keep up with new security. thanks for the regular updates! this version works for a few disks that 7.0.2.0 would not do.
,rjb3353,2012-05-06T11:07Z,"hello, I must be doing something  fundamentally wrong.  when I try to install I get the  following error. ""can't write: C:Windowssystem32ElbyCDIO.dll.tmp""  I am on Windows 7 64 ultimate.  I  have tried installing by right clicking on the program launcher and selecting  Install as Administrator.  Any Ideas?
thanks,"
