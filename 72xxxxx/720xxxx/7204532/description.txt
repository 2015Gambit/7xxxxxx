An old man walking his dog in New York City near the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge is horrified 
when his dog retrieves a decomposed human hand. It is identified by the police as belonging 
to Ann-Lynne, a local prostitute. Lieutenant Fred Williams (Jack Hedley), the burned-out 
police detective investigating the murder, interviews the young woman's nosy and obnoxious 
landlady, Mrs. Weissburger (Babette New), who tells him that during her daily spying and 
eavesdropping on her tenants, she overheard the girl last week over the phone arranging to 
meet a man who spoke with a strange, duck-like voice.
