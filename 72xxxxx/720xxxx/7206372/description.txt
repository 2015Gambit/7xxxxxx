This is a Highlight reel of Nick Diaz that shows detailed information of the MMA career of the UFC Top Welterweight. Created at Maximum High Definition 1080p for the best quality possible. The video is short but worth having for any MMA or Nick Diaz fan. I will be uploading the rest of the NICK DIAZ career pack within the next week and it will contain 31 of Nick Diaz's professional fights and a rare jujitsu match. Until then, here is the intro video to the Career Pack. Enjoy!
