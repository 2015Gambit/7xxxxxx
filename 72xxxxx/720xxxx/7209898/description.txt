The incarcerated girls and young women come from troubled - often violent - backgrounds. According to DJ, "They come in here so broken...These are girls 
who've been abused and objectified their whole lives." The film illustrates how many of the young women achieve salvation through joining an elite band of volunteers tasked with battling forest fires, building hiking trails in remote areas and assisting during natural disasters.
