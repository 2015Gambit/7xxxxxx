,SLoneTiger,2012-04-22T22:15Z,"1.- I install as admin.
2.- I copy files from folder.
3.- I load game but takes me to a black screen and cannot get out of it unless I reset computer.
Using latest nvidia drivers.
Any idea why this happens?"

,onimusha410,2012-04-24T15:51Z,"Black Screen Problem work-around
================================

1. Download the NO INTRO FIX from http://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_insanely_twisted_shadow_planet.shtml (this step may not be necessary)

2. After replacing the files: Right click the ""Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet"" icon

3. Select ""Run with graphics processor"" --> ""Integrated graphics""

4. Play the game until you end up outside where you see the sky and a meteor falling from the sky (it'll only take a few seconds)

5. At this point the game should autosave 

6. Exit the game

7. Start the game using the High performance NVIDIA processor

8. When the game starts, select ""Resume"" & you should begin from where you left off.

================================
The black screen may occur after cutscenes. If that happens, alt+f4 the game and follow steps: 3, play game until autosave, 7, 8.

Maybe there's another way, hopefully there will be a fix, but for now this works for me."

,SLoneTiger,2012-04-26T03:22Z,">>onimusha410:
Do you mean the desktop shortcut?
Or the program folder main icon?

Under Win7 I could not see: ""Run with graphics processor"" --> ""Integrated graphics""

Thank you in advance."
,BigTown,2012-04-26T08:23Z,"@ onimusha410

Thanks, unfortunately same problem. It's not just a black screen, PC freezes up and you have to power off and reboot. 

Also, in order to right click and choose ""Run with graphics processor"" I think you need an NVIDIA card? Don't have this choice with my Radeon, but I tried lowest settings and it still crashed."
