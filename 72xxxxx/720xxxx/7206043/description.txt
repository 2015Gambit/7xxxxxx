I converted all of the files to a basic .avi format, easier for you to run them and in a reasonable good quality. The last two episodes are still .mkv but a VLC player will take them.
The english subtitles are not perfect, but barely anyone will notice anyway.
Don't forget to seed this torrent for everyone to see this amazing series!
