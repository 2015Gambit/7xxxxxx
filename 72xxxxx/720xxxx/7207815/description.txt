2012-04-22 FIM MX1/MX2 Motocross Bulgaria

After a week-break, the FIM Motocross World Championship is back to celebrate the second round of the season in the awarded track of Sevlievo, Bulgaria, where Antonio Cairoli and Jeffrey Herlings will give their best to keep the red plate on their KTM.

In the first Grand Prix of the season, held in the sandy track of Valkenswaard, there was a clear favourite in the MX1 class, the multi-champion Antonio Cairoli. However, this weekend the races might be more disputed, as there are at least up to six riders who can fight for the win in Sevlievo.

In the MX2 class things are very similar, as Jeffrey Herlings did not have any opponent in Valkenswaard, so it is time now for the Dutch rider to defend the red plate on the hard pack of Sevlievo. However, there is another clear favourite to claim the victory this weekend, the British rider Tommy Searle.
