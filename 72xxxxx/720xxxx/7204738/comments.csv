[T],MrDowntown,2012-04-22T16:03Z,"To add Comic Cover Thumbnails to your torrents:

Google the issue to find the Cover image, copy and go to:

http://bayimg.com/


Make sure to Mark:

Settings
[X] Resize to:
300x300 TPB - Torrent Image

It will give you an address with a 9-digit code at the end, JUST copy the 9-digit code and put that into the torrent image field. Make sure there isnt a space before as TPB loses its mind about that.


Thanks for all the Ups"
