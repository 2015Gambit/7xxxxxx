Get torrent file allows me to choose what to download, get this torrent does not. This upload has both, your last WA post didn't. Just wondering if it's just my browser being stupid or if there is a reason."
,shallow2,2012-04-21T00:55Z,"If I get both WMV and MP4 downloaded at the same time I include both in torrent. If one or the other is finished much sooner the files are upped separately.

Get torrentfile/get torrent is magnet link vs 'old' torrent file. TPB has set up downloading so that when a torrent is downloaded X amount of times the torrent link (get torrent file) is removed and only the Magnet link remains (get torrent).

You can still selecrt  which files to download, but when downloading with torrent file you get the filelist immediately, but with magnet links it takes a few moments for your torrent client to generate the index. But once Utorrent (or which evert client you use) has decrypted the file index, you are free to select 'do not download' on either the mp4 or the wmv or the pics or whatever..

Hope this helps :) "

,philsfan5,2012-04-21T01:29Z,"thanks for the info shallow. although for me, when I click get this torrent, it shows a blank list. No matter how long I wait, it remains a blank list. I can click OK and get everything, but it forces me to download the entire thing everytime. Not the end of the world, but I never want the pics and on some torrents it makes me unnecessarily download both video files."
,shallow02,2012-04-21T01:44Z,Have you tried utorrent ? Works like a charm :)
,chaostastic,2012-04-21T02:08Z,"philsfan, upgrade your client. I use Transmission 2.22 from early 2011 — that is way old — and I have never ever this problem of yours."
,chaostastic,2012-04-21T02:09Z,Thank you Merzedes for this fine post!
,philsfan5,2012-04-21T02:13Z,"yeah, I use Utorrent 3.1.3. Maybe a certain setting?"
,DuckBharma,2012-04-21T03:04Z,"Cool, thanks!"
,FelatioSucks,2012-04-21T08:34Z,"Once the files have shown up in utorrent, when the file size appears you know it has downloaded the torrent file from the magnet link) highlight them all (control a) scroll to the file(s) you want to download. hold control key and left click the files you want to download. release control key, right click the highlighted area and select don't download."
,FelatioSucks,2012-04-21T08:35Z,"forgot to mention, you need to be in the ""files"" tab at the bottom"
,nemez505,2012-04-21T23:49Z,"Utorrent has a bug with file skipping, if you choose files and skip it and don't download at same times, next time you will have failed hash check and whole or a part of file can be lost. it's my situation."
,nemez505,2012-04-21T23:52Z,"FelatioSucks
