[T],tr108,2012-04-21T15:08Z,"I appreciate the votes. :)

Things'll be quiet for a second after I put up The Vow (hopefully this weekend). I've got 3 Bruce Lee films (Big Boss, Fist of Fury, and Return of the Dragon) in the queue and I'm trying to do the Star Wars films but the alien subs are giving me issues. Ugh."
,justneustis,2012-04-22T00:19Z,"Any chance you could do the super hero movies? Iron Man 1-2, Batman Begins, Batman The Dark Knight, Superman Returns? "
[T],tr108,2012-04-22T15:44Z,"@justneustis - I hope to get to all those flicks, just not sure when. Things have gotten much busier for me than I expected..."
,ftservd,2012-04-23T19:07Z,Thx for picking up were HR left off I tried coming in for HR when he or she was gone for awhile really hard to keep up since I only had a duel core macbook to do the encodes lol.  I have since moved to Roku now for my videos.  But my dad still useses the APTV.  He loves ur stuff so keep up the good work!!
,justneustis,2012-04-23T23:53Z,@tr108 Need some help?
[T],tr108,2012-04-26T01:32Z,"@ftservd - I always wondered what happened to you! (I had you bookmarked) Glad to see you're still around. Your encodes were pretty nice, btw.

@justneustis - boy do I ever need help! I would certainly enjoy someone else doing iTunes encodes as well :) I wish I could clone myself so he could sit and package these torrents (choosing screenshots, prepping the info-- all that stuff takes too freakin' long)"
