As his father Red, struggles to rebuild their street credibility, his disappointment in Bryan lands him a one-way ticket to Atlanta. There Bryan meets Ms. Bee, a shrewd club owner, who introduces him to a different kind of hustle. Impressed with how simple everything seems, Bryan is tempted, but not convinced that he should go from, “Gang bangin' to cock slangin'.” Eventually, Bryan finds gratification in using what he’s got … to get what he wants. “Shake” is an erotic thriller, with an intense overdose of passion. This urban drama combines the grittiness of “Hustle & Flow” with the sensuality of “Players Club” and “Trois.”
