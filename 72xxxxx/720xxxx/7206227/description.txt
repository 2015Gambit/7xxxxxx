Gharaonda explores the lives of Sudip and Chaya (Amol Palekar and Zarina Wahab respectively) who belong to the middle class in Bombay and work in the same office. They plan to get married as soon as they have a house made for themselves. In this process, they save every penny to build a corpus for buying a house. They go house hunting looking for an abode which will suit their budgets. After finally investing in one, they are all excited about their future. After a few months, the builder who is constructing their building runs into financial difficulties and commits suicide. The building project is abandoned and all the money of investors goes down the drain. The couple is shocked and does not know how to react. They just cannot imagine having to start once again from scratch.
