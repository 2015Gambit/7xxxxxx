,casualsx,2012-04-25T16:58Z,PLEASE SEED THIS:  I have an activation code from my bud at Kia dealer.
,casualsx,2012-04-26T04:10Z,"THANK YOU whoever is seeding this, MUCH APPRECIATED!!!"
,casualsx,2012-04-26T14:39Z,74.5% downloaded and no more seeding ... please seed again so I can complete the download. I'm tipping my hat and raising a glass to ya for the 74.5% so far but it's useless unless I can complete it. Many thanks in advance.
,casualsx,2012-04-27T04:54Z,"Downloading now, presently at 77% @ around 340kb speed - awesome! With any luck it will finish tonight and my 2011 Optima will know where I'm going when I don't cause even the cheapest Garmin is better than the maps in this car. Thanks again for seeding and many thanks to Stonywall for the up ... and the seeding?"
,casualsx,2012-04-27T05:51Z,"Got it all!  Thanks Stonywall, hope I can return the favor. Post here if you need something and if I have it I will upload. Doubt it will be as unique as this but ya never know. "
,Stonywall,2012-05-03T06:14Z,"Sorry it took so long. I was trying to seed using a linux seedbox and wasn't able to.  So I went back to the tried and true Windows server.  Not as elegant, but it works.

Right now linux and I are not on speaking terms. Hopefully the roses and chocolate will smooth things over.  LOL


I'm glad you enjoyed the upload.  :)"
