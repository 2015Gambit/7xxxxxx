Death Of A Snob

It's Christmas time in Lochdubh village, where Hamish Macbeth continues to serve as the town's only policeman. Feeling lonely and put upon as usual, Hamish accepts the invitation of the gorgeous Jane Wetherby to spend the holiday at her health farm on the remote island of Eileencraig, perhaps to find what's behind two nasty accidents Jane has recently survived.

The islanders are hostile and his fellow guests are none too friendly. When one of them, the insufferable and snobbish Heather Todd, is found dead on the shoreline in what appears to be an accident, Hamish's instincts go into overdrive. With the help of fellow guest Harriet Shaw, he discovers a distinctly unconvincing motive and modus operandus for a rather unlikely killer.
