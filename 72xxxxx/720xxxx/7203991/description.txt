Howlin' Wolf - Smokestack Lightning: The Complete Chess Masters 1951-1960 [2011] 

Original Release / Hip-O Select / CD

After issuing Complete sets dedicated to Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Little Walter, and Bo Diddley, Hip-O Select finally got around to the titanic HowlinΓÇÖ Wolf in the fall of 2011, releasing Smokestack Lightning: The Complete Chess Masters 1951-1960, a 97-track, four-disc limited-edition box set containing everything the Wolf cut in his first decade of recording. Although the first years of the ΓÇÿ60s treated him exceptionally well -- many classic sessions arrived in the first few years of the decade, many showcased on 1962ΓÇÖs peerless ΓÇ£rocking chairΓÇ¥ album -- this is where his legacy lies: with the spooky, primal howl that kicks off ΓÇ£MoaninΓÇÖ at MidnightΓÇ¥ and the scores of earthy boogies and down-and-dirty grinds that followed. Smokestack Lightning stacks up plenty of alternate takes, a good chunk of them never released in the U.S., but the repetition doesnΓÇÖt slow the set down or turn it repetitive. Instead, the repeated alternate takes sit well with the treasures -- many justly celebrated, some unearthed -- all adding up to a testament to Howlin' WolfΓÇÖs unearthly, mighty force. --Stephen Thomas Erlewine, AllMusicGuide
