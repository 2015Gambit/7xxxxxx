,tomreedtoon,2012-04-20T14:53Z,"First of all, this film NEEDS spoilers. Everything I've heard says that Joss Whedon has thrown away his career by making a piece-of-shit slasher film. These spoilers are the first indication I've received that he has not.

Second, this had better be a legit torrent. The first one to appear on TPB involved a ""password"" that was a clear indication that they wanted to send users a Trojan or a worm. (The other torrent has apparently been deleted from TPB, thank the FSM.)"
