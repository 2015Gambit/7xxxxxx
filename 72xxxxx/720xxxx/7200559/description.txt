Plot
 
Two technicians in a sophisticated industrial facility ΓÇö Richard Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Steve Hadley (Bradley Whitford) ΓÇö are getting ready for an unknown operation, one of several taking place around the world.
 
Meanwhile, five college students ΓÇö Dana (Kristen Connolly), Curt (Chris Hemsworth), Jules (Anna Hutchison), Marty (Fran Kranz), and Holden (Jesse Williams) ΓÇö drive out for a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods, while the technicians keep an eye on the students with hidden cameras. Each student is manipulated into a fairly common horror archetype by the organization, a point which is made several times in the film itself.
 
At the cabin, the friends divide up rooms and settle in while the observing technicians place bets on which scenario the students will unwittingly select. Once the students enter the basement through a trap-door, they discover a number of artifacts, each of which hints at its own sub-genre of horror, ranging from a sphere which is reminiscent of Lemarchand's box from the Hellraiser series to a scarab-like pendant. Dana reads an incantation from an old diary, which is the trigger for a scenario involving a family of zombies which rise from the grave.
 
Curt and Jules go outside to have sex, under the influence of the technicians who remotely administer drugs via a ventilation system. Zombies attack the lovers and Jules is killed. Meanwhile, in the cabin, the paranoid Marty begins to feel as if things are being controlled by "puppeteers" (it is later stated that his use of marijuana, treated with additional mind-altering chemicals by the technicians, has made him resilient to the drugs being used to guide the students' actions) and goes outside, where he runs into the fleeing Curt and a zombie. The friends attempt to barricade the cabin against the zombies while the technicians attempt to bring about their deaths. Marty finds a surveillance camera in his room, confirming his paranoid fantasies, but he is attacked and presumably killed off-screen. Holden, Dana, and Curt flee in their RV.
