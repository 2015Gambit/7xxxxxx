,Yakobo,2012-04-23T13:14Z,Eps 1 & 3 seem to only be 720p
,kenniki,2012-04-23T14:12Z,"Thanks for the up, I'll seed for approx. 1 TB after it's finished."
,Mr.Boulregard,2012-04-27T16:04Z,Could anyone verify if these are watermarked?
,Yakobo,2012-04-27T18:12Z,"They have the Hub/TV-Y logos/pop-ups appear as they did in the show, other ads are removed. To my knowledge (and vision) they don't have anything else."
,Bombastuss,2012-05-03T09:52Z,Is it only me or does the first ep have a kind of bad framerate?
