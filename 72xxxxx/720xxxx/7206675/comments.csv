,tlita,2012-04-22T18:27Z,"Radi, radi druze.. Bas sam gledao da li ima neki vredan torrent, i nisam naso, pa sam izbacio. :) Samo je dosta komplikovana instalacija, ali mora tako. :P"
,tlita,2012-04-22T18:43Z,Ne vidi mi se komentar.. o.O wtf..
,tlita,2012-04-22T18:44Z,"Aha.. Ok, vidi se.. Trip trip.. :D"
,tlita,2012-04-23T11:05Z,IT'S TESTED ON WINDOWS 7 32 AND 64BIT.. :D
,tlita,2012-04-24T19:34Z,"Should I just delete this torrent, yes, it is my first, but nobody cares..? I'm seeding for nothing.. :/ Apparently.. Tell me.."
,PurplePaperplane,2012-06-29T16:15Z,"It works fine. 
But you forgot to say one thing:
before placing ""Vca.bin"" in ""/Tages100663362"" you'll need to run game once (it won't really play but will create this directory and some other files).

If you don't there will simply be no ""/Tages100663362"" folder."
,tlita,2012-06-30T20:47Z,"Yes, that's right, I forgot. :) Actually, I tried to delete this torrent, but I couldn't. :P"
,tomcraftman,2012-08-20T19:09Z,Thanks for sharing this superb game.I already played it on Vista but now I do have a problem installing it.Can't install the TagesSetup_x64.Do you have any idea why? 
,tomcraftman,2012-08-23T13:26Z,"It's me again.Have found the solution to my problem (had to use Tages 32bit).The game works well.Thanks again for sharing it.Tamas from Serbia.
Cheers"
,tlita,2012-08-26T01:26Z,"I'm deeply sorry, I didn't see your comment.... I guess it's logic to use version according to your OS. :D I don't know how you download it, it has only 2-3 seeders.. :// Cheers from Serbia.. :)"
,tomcraftman,2012-08-26T22:32Z,"Actually,your torrent is very fast to download - over 300kB/s.The number of seeders can be deceptive,don't worry about that.It works fine,plus I'll seed it at least for a month in repay for your effort."
,tlita,2012-08-27T13:50Z,"Thank you, you are very kind.. :)  People like you are rare in my country.. "
,tlita,2012-08-30T23:18Z,"I forgot to mansion... It isn't just Dark Athena.. When you enter game, and New Game, you can choose between Escape From Butcher Bay, or, Dark  Athena.. :D Cheers"
,Dumi23,2012-09-01T14:24Z,"Hi, thanks for this! I can't seem to get past the ""Activation Code"" screen. Please help me with that area. What do I select? I've even tried getting the code by ""submitting"" online and got ""invalid serial"" message. I hope I didn't ban myself!"
,tlita,2012-09-05T12:26Z,"I'm 100% sure that you didn't do some step.. Did you start the game, and close, just to create the folder like PurplePaperplane said..? I just finished playing both parts Escape FBB and Dark Athena.. :D If you do everything ok, no serial should pop.."
