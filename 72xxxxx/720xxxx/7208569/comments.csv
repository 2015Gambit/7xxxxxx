,Alliha,2012-04-23T12:37Z,Great upload! Even the quality of the songs from the royal wedding is great! Thanks a lot. 
,brainstew_33,2012-04-23T15:58Z,"The only other ""official"" song that I can think of is the ""MLP1 Hop Skip Jump Song (original)"" demo song."
,brainstew_33,2012-04-23T16:19Z,"By the way, thanks! All songs are of superb quality. :D"
,tangence,2012-04-25T12:37Z,God amongst men. Cheers.
,Phaux_The_Fox,2012-04-26T14:51Z,awww no Equestria Girls?
,castor.sky,2012-04-28T04:55Z,But why is this FLAC? This audio is MPEG quality: http://pastebin.com/TPhXGTm9
,zwarm,2012-06-19T14:38Z,"I can confirm that these tracks have been trans-coded to flac. The original source is most likely hd youtube videos. Either way, quality is still good, and getting all the tracks in one bundle is nice."
,Zoiflite,2012-07-23T20:34Z,Great compilation of all the songs from the show! Tons of thanks!
,Green.Banana,2012-08-08T21:57Z,Flac:  Apparently now an audio file type.  
,Tosh_The_Cupcake,2012-08-24T08:25Z,YAY! I just finished season 2 and fell in LOVE with all the music so glad i don't have to download all these songs separably now much less PAY xD HOORAY!
,ymom2,2012-09-22T05:13Z,These FLAC files definitely have a compressed audio signature.  You should have uploaded the original files.  Re-encoding them is just a waste of space.  Hopefully in the future we will have the opportunity to listen to official high bitrate or uncompressed soundtracks.
