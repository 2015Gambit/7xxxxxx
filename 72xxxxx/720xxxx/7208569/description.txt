This is my second MLP:FiM soundtrack release.

If you have previously downloaded the Season 1 soundtrack I created, DELETE IT AND REPLACE IT WITH THE ONE CONTAINED HERE. This version is not only much higher quality, but it has two additional tracks that did not make it onto my original release.

Also, enjoy the sounds of Season 2!


Be sure to check back at the end of Season 3, I have no plans to stop making these :D.
