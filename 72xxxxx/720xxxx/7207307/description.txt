Kathy Harrington (Laura Lazare) is a junior at Bristol State University. Kathy is also beautiful and pursuing a L.A.S. degree in Journalism. She applies for and gets a job as a night clerk in a motel so she can get extra money and also gather material for her writing. Through Kathy's wandering eyes, the audience can explore the physical pleasures of those who pass through the motel doors. At times even Kathy is tempted to succumb to a moment of heated passion, but her strict Ohio upbringing will not allow her to respond. And so the stage is set for "Purely Physical", a film that captures people overpowered by the feeling of a sudden wanting, an out-of-the-way motel and the press of time that makes loves so intense
