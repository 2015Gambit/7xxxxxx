,TunaHead,2012-06-12T10:25Z,"Download this program and if you find that your Chrome browser is acting up then download another browser ie. Firefox. Safari, Opera, etc. etc.
Thanks uploader."
,Bean-Bandit,2012-07-08T05:42Z,"Not sure about a virus but everytime you use this program it erases your Google Chrome. lol

Well if you like Google Chrome then it's pointless to use this program, wouldn't you say?

If you like Google Chrome then stay away from this copy of Google Earth as it will delete your Chrome. If you don't mind installing it over and over make sure you make a account with Google and sync your bookmarks, apps, and so forth cause if you don't you'll lose it all.

Sorry but I have to give this a Thumbs down."
