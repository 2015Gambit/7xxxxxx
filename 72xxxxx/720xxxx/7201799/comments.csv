,mikebogina,2012-04-21T20:29Z,"lol I'm one of those ppl who got the problem with the Setup just stopping at 70%.

I hope this works :)"
,DiVinE7,2012-04-21T21:00Z,"Doesnt work for me followed every instruction, ran the setup exe after extracting and copying over the files in this torrent, setup just dissapears as usual, so i tried setting the compatibility to windows xp service pack 3 and it loads up the launcher but now i have to redownload the whole fuckin thing over again, well whatever setting to windows xp service pack 3 works. This torrent is useless as it seems."
,bobrownik,2012-04-22T00:09Z,"just want to confirm that this works, what i don't like is that it has some adware in the temp files, i renamed the exes, and also there is always a possibility of battle.net account theft, but as far as the program itself it works fine, i got to the account login part, but the servers are down at the moment, follow the directions in the torrent, and use the exe file included to start the game"
,ffejrxx,2012-04-22T12:05Z,"this works

the temp.zip isnt needed at all
just unpack and run Diablo III.exe

it will patch to the latest update and play"
,bobrownik,2012-04-22T17:27Z,"temp.zip is needed, and the provided exe is also needed, if you do what ffejrxx says you just going to get an error"
,2800aaa,2012-04-23T21:44Z,"It works fine. There are many problems with beta.
DiVinE7 i had the same problem it turned to be graphic card driver . Then i instaled the game and the mouse cursor wasnt able to move but at the same time had fantom cursor. I went to the forums then read the problems of the Diablo 3 open beta etc. i solved problem by reducing the size of fonts from 150 to 100%."
,Morphesto,2012-04-24T21:17Z,"Hmm... I dont trust this. I followed the instructions in detail. Now I´m at the part where I´m suppose to log in but i dont dare to use my account because it´s connected to starcraft. Thoughts like ""what if i login in with my account, they track me and my starcraft account gets blocked?"" I´m also gonna buy this game later so I dont want to mess that part up either. You guys that are playing it now. Are you using ure normal account or what?"
,aname1990n,2012-04-25T20:37Z,"What should i do when i come to the login screen?? It says i don't have a valid battlenet account.

BTW: shouldn't this be very legal, because it's just a beta, a beta that was free just some days ago, if i understand it right."
,ffejrxx,2012-04-26T16:21Z,"the open beta was from 4-20-12 to 4-23-12
"
,Mr.Wave910,2012-05-18T07:55Z,Is this still able to be played and tested??
,GamersUnite23,2012-05-19T07:37Z,Beta and Demo are the same right? my stupid friend here keeps confusing me....
,SGMV,2012-05-26T02:42Z,"Ok i downloadet it and followed the intructions everything went nice, i started the game and as i was logging in it said it needed a patch and will close and start downloading, and that i could play afterwards. Then it closes and said ""diablo 3 has stopped working"". 
Same thing every time. 
PLEASE HELP"
,axinte,2012-07-01T12:07Z,"I got tired of fake cracks and I looked for an alternative.

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "
