- INFO:
Santana formed in 1967 in San Francisco and was originally known as the Carlos Santana Blues Band. The first members were Carlos Santana (lead guitar), Tom Fraser (lead vocals & rhythm guitar), Mike Carabello (percussion), Rod Harper (drums), David Brown (bass guitar) and Gregg Rolie (organ). Its breakthrough began two years later, playing in the Woodstock Festival.
Over a career spanning forty years, Santana exemplified Latin rock, while diversifying into other genres.
In 1999 the band released the extremely successful Supernatural, which reached number one in several countries.
Santana has sold over 100 million records and in 1998 was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.
