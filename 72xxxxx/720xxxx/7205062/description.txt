    Riggs and Murtaugh are at it again in this sequel to the original      
      Lethal Weapon in 1987. When a red BMW crashes while they are         
      chasing it, they discover the trunk is full of South African         
    Krugerands. Their boss assigns them to protect a federal witness       
      named Leo Getz to try and keep them out of trouble. When the         
     witness reveals he has been doing business with South Africans,       
               the story evolves into a fast moving chase.
