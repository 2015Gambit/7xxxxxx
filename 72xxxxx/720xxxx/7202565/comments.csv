,Pijlie,2012-04-21T09:19Z,Odd file. Saved on my harrdrive and is now impossible to remove or paste. Any explanations? 
,mr.maxout,2012-04-21T11:27Z,It just means you have the file open in a program such as your torrent download program or vlc or any other media player that you're using. Close it and then you can modify it move it and delete it.
