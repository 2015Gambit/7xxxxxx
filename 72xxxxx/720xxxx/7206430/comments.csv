Thanks."

These are valuable releases, with much bonus material that are NOT fillers. It's worth the prize of the remastered cd's itself.

But to the sorry part. These remasters are compressed to death. There are not much dynamic listening joy left. Sorry, but I hoped the Japanese would be to clever to fall into this destructive trap.

Anyway, thanks, and still all bonus materials are worth the prize."
