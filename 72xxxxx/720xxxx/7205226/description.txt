Tomoya Asahina taken over as the acting manager of Noël, a coffee shop, while the owner recovers from the injuries he sustained while saving Tomoya's life. To regain the business lost due to his inexperience, Tomoya has converted the restaurant to a cosplay café—the waitresses, who are all married women, now wear sexy costumes. The women of Noël admire the young, handsome, and kind Tomoya, and each takes her turn at sampling what he has to offer.
