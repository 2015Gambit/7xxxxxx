This documentary film takes place around the world and particularly in Brazil, India, Kenya and Cambodia. It begins in the favelas of Brazil, where we recognize the huge posters of JR and the reactions they provoke in women. Then in India, where we discover women caught between traditional customs and modern day. Then Kenya, where, again, women must live in a more chaotic and unstable that. Finally, in Cambodia, we will face the violence of the ultra violent expropriation against households headed by a matriarchal system that attempts to resist the face of real estate giants ΓÇª

Each woman in the film amazes us with her courage and faith. It took three years for JR to make this movie.
