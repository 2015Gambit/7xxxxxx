,matteo882,2012-06-12T00:05Z,"ben, i'm gonna step in and help you here before some of the vets jump all over your ass lol.  first, as for the resolution, it's only going to be 1920x1080 if the original movie was recorded in a 16:9 aspect ratio.  most feature films are a smaller ratio than this.  protoyu could have ripped it in 1920x1080 but he/she'd only be encoding the horizontal black bars and then we'd all be complaining that the file size is too big.  

secondly, if your picture is skipping every 9 seconds, your processor/graphics are too slow to manage the 18.5Mbps bitrate.  you'll either need to upgrade your computer or stick to lower-bitrate files (less than 10Mbps is a safe bet).  i had this same problem with a pentium T5870.  now i use an i5-2520M with Intel HD graphics and a 15mbps rip will only use 20-25% of my CPU."
