Bravo Media premieres "Kathy," an all new one-hour weekly pop culture talk show hosted by two-time Emmy award winner Kathy Griffin on Thursday, April 19th at 10:00 PM ET/PT. Every Thursday night, the original gossip girl will have a whole hour to deflate the egos of everyone who is anyone and those who think they're someone. "Kathy" will showcase Griffin's unique take on celebrities, co-workers, friends, politicians, and yes, even her own boxed-wine swilling mother, Maggie. She'll be burning the last of her already very few bridges all while enforcing a clothing optional work environment.
