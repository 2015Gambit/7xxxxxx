Since people have asked: I use HandBrake -- http://handbrake.fr/ -- (freeware; available for Mac, Windows, Linux) to produce my files. The team doesn't do proper snapshot releases often (only about once a year) but they produce Nightly Builds -- https://build.handbrake.fr/ -- where they provide bug fixes and try out new features. If you want to do your own encodes, I'd start by downloading a Nightly Build. 

As of this writing, the HandBrake team hasn't built presets for either the AppleTV 3 or the new iPad, so I created some 1080p iTunes presets that I use. Download them at http://bayfiles.com/file/8ds9/CziuC5/1080p_Presets.zip "
,doubleaa25,2012-04-21T18:39Z,"Thanks for the upload tr!

However I am having problems downloading the preset file from BayFiles..."
,doubleaa25,2012-04-22T08:43Z,"tr, how do you get the metadata for your encodes? I would love to do the same!"
[T],tr108,2012-04-22T15:50Z,"@doubleaa25

I've been trying to respond for the better part of two days but keep getting a database error. Hope this FINALLY goes thru.

Being a stickler for details, I enter most metadata manually and cull it from IMDb, iTunes Preview (http://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/movies/id33) and http://getvideoartwork.com/"
[T],tr108,2012-04-22T15:53Z,Hmm. It seems whenever I try to place the other link for my 1080p presets is when the db error occurs. Even a shortened link is no good. Ugh.
,doubleaa25,2012-04-22T18:50Z,"Thanks tr for the info. Yea, tpb does not like shortened links for wtvr reason. I guess to prevent spam or something.

And do you just enter the info through iTunes? I am a stickler for details as well ;)"
,dencre,2012-04-23T11:02Z,"@doubleaa25

Are you on PC or Mac? If PC, have you tried MetaX? It really is a great piece of software. The interface is butt ugly, but it gets the job done in an easy way :)"
,BlueTak,2012-04-23T23:02Z,"Thanks again. You'll be due a skull soon, I'd hope."
,doubleaa25,2012-04-25T07:08Z,"@dencre

I have heard of MetaX. I will definitely give it a go. Thanks for the info!"
[T],tr108,2012-04-26T01:34Z,"@doubleaa25 - MetaX might work out better for you but, to answer your question, I'm on a Mac and use Subler to tag my files."
,doubleaa25,2012-05-03T23:23Z,@tr108 thanks for the help man! My first encode finished and it looks great! Just need to tag everything now...
