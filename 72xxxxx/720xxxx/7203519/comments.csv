For that matter, a trilogy, tetralogy, etc, should refer to a completed series of the given number of works, not a series in progress.  I would assume Underworld will be back with a fifth and probably a sixth entry.  In cases where the series is yet open ended, simply use the word ""series.""

OK, rant over.  I'm sure you did a fine job with the upload."
