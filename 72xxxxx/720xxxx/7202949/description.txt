COMMENTS:
This is a "no label" 2CD release of the Seattle 1975 show.
Performance in Seattle is excellent! Terrific energy - and everything clicks
The "no-label" used the JEMS torrent for their release; in other words: it's from a lower generation source than for instance "Alive In Seattle" (DAC). It's taken from the master tape.
But this bootleg release is EQ'd, and it sounds different from the JEMS torrent because of that. You decide whether you liked their work or not.
