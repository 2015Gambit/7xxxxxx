,muff1nman,2012-05-30T06:32Z,Next time you do a release don't make the images shitty. I hate having to get a separate program from Daemon tools just to open them. I can't even open the third to get the included release of Virtual CD so I'm torrenting that separately. Thanks for the release but seriously don't make shitty files.
,muff1nman,2012-05-30T06:53Z,Forget my last comment. I can't even open it with Virtual CD 10. I know I'm not making noob mistakes. It says it can't recognize it as an image in both that and Daemon Tools. I rechecked and everything. I can't stress enough to not make a shittily packaged release. Just use rar next time if you can't keep from fucking up the images. I'm going to have to use YET ANOTHER program to even open the isos At least my bandwidth won't be wasted then. What a hassle. Was going to spend the money on it so maybe I should. Only wanted it for DayZ mod anyway. To anyone downloading I suggest not risking the waste of time. Look for another release or wait for a better one here.
,NanoEntity,2012-05-30T07:53Z,"WORKS :)

Downloaded all 3 ISO's

Installed the game, took 4 ever, needs like 40GB free space.

! ! !   Using this solution involves editing system settings so watch out what you're doing   ! ! !

(32bit OS only)

Windows XP

Menu Start -> Run, type sysdm.cpl and press ENTER
a window should open, go to tab Advanced -> Startup and Recovery Settings -> Edit
at this point you're editing your boot.ini file. Don't mess things up.
Look for the line with your operating system mentioned and add ""/3GB /USERVA=2990"" without quotes. Should look like this:

[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)WINDOWS=""Microsoft Windows XP Professional"" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect /3GB /USERVA=2990

just add only the ""/3GB /USER..."", don't erase or add anything else as it may corrupt your booting file
save changes and reboot


Windows Vista / Windows 7

        if you are running as an Administrator go to Menu Start -> Run, type cmd and press ENTER
        if not go to Menu Start -> Programs -> Accessories, press RMB on Command Prompt and select Run as Administrator
    in Command Prompt type ""bcdedit /set IncreaseUserVA 2990"" without quotes and press ENTER
    reboot

,Mijomike,2012-06-06T18:27Z,"DAY-Z COMPLETE INSTALLATION GUIDE:

Many people have been asking on if it is possible to play Day-Z with the torrent, the answer is yes. But as far as I know the only was you can play is single-player, or using tunngle. Here is how!

Programs needed:
-UTorrent
-DAEMON Tools Lite
-Virtual CD Demo
-WinRAR

After you have all these programs installed follow the instructions below.

Step 1: Download this torrent.. obviously.
Step 2: You will now have 3 ISO's located wherever you saved the torrent.
Step 3: Using DAEMON Tools mount the first ISO and install the game, during installation you will be required to insert the other disks, to do this simply unmount the current ISO and mount the next one and click ok.
Step 4: Once the installation is finished decompression and extraction should occur, just wait until that finishes.
Step 5: Navigate to whereever you installed Arma 2: Combined Operations and open the #JIMBO folder.
Step 6: Inside that folder open the mini-image folder.
Step 7: Using Virtual CD mount the image to a physical burner, you may have to do this before every time you play Arma 2.

Now Arma 2 should be installed correctly.

Ill explain how to install Day-Z in the next comment."
,Mijomike,2012-06-06T19:42Z,"Heres how to install Day-Z.

Step 1: Go to this url http://dayzmod.com/downloads.php
and select the mirror closest to your country.
Step 2: Download all the files to a folder you can remember.
Step 3: go to your Arma 2 directory and make a new folder named '@DayZ' inside that folder make a new one called 'addons' 
Step 4: Now extract all the files you just downloaded to the addons folder. 
Step 5: Go to http://kronzky.info/missions/arma/dayzsp/
and download the mission.
Step 6: Open the RAR you just downloaded.
Step 7: Go to your Arma 2 directory and open the 'Missions' folder.
Step 8: Drag 'DayZ_SP.Chernarus.pbo' from the   RAR into your folder.
Step 9: Start OA and open the extensions menu select @DayZ 
Step 10: Click single player, scenarios and select DayZ SP.
Have fun "

This is quite frustrating, I'm down to my last resort I'm re-downloading the torrent using another torrent program this time and we'll see what happens....will update in like 10 hours with the current DL speed, hopefully it shoots up to 1 MB+ like it did yesterday a few percent in."

 2 4.37 GB (4,703,232,000 bytes)
 3 602 MB (631,357,440 bytes)

Just do Force Recheck on the torrent in utorrent, that should fix the bytes 

Each of my iso files were off a few million bytes. I originally DL'd with BitTorrent, I'm now DLing with utorrent. If the numbers are correct again, I'll do the force recheck as he suggests. *crosses fingers* Just under 2hrs left on my DL currently at 1.5MB/s"
,Triton8719,2012-06-10T18:23Z,"Holy mother of god it finally works. Ok, here's what I concluded. If you get the LZZ7 error on the black screen install (it stops around 35%) and you don't have the .exe files. 

Uninstall the game, go to page 3 and to Dalek21's comment (Thank you so much btw Dalek21!!!). Follow it to the letter...reinstall and if you make it past 35%, you know your golden. The black screen install DOES take awhile, so wait until you see it past 35% and go for walk, eat lunch, go grocery shopping lol. 

After it installs fully, reboot, use VCD to mount the mini-image file, keep VCD running in the background and go to the ArmA II exe. Enjoy. Now....to get Day Z installed and hope it works."

,moeburn1,2012-06-27T00:05Z,"works 100% offline (which is all I've tried) with no FADE whatsoever!

Just make sure to:

- use VirtualCD 10 (I downloaded the newest version, not the one included), and mount the image to your PHYSICAL cd/dvd drive.  If you don't have an actual DVD drive, I'm not sure how it works for you.
- run the .reg file included in the jimbo folder.  You may need to change your cd key using the options.cmd file, as I got an ""invalid cd key error"" after running the .reg file.
- remove all deamon tools drives, and then exit daemon tools (many DRMs check to see if DT exists/is running, I wouldn't be suprised if FADE does)"
,IcanInternet,2012-06-27T18:49Z,"I believe i found a fix for multiplayer and the invalid cd key error. do what moeburn says, run the .reg file in the jimbo folder, then run the options.cmd file in the ArmA 2 folder.

,Bean-Bandit,2012-06-28T20:22Z,One other reason why you don't want to use anything from GQNP is that the key gen is already in there and you can download the DayZ mod free from the source without having to do a stupid survey which will most likely not work out and you just give him money.
,Bean-Bandit,2012-06-28T22:11Z,I got the game to work but didn't use the virtual cd cause the mini came back as being corrupted and daemon doesn't know this image. Also and I'm not to sure but doing the gun range didn't offer any great results as I could only and sometimes not even that hit the up close targets. Even taking my time shooting didn't give any good results.
,moeburn1,2012-06-29T03:01Z,"For anyone looking to play DayZ online, or just trying to install the beta patch, it is possible:

First you need to edit the .reg file in the #jimbo folder and change all the ""D:\Arma 2"" to your Arma 2 installation directory, then run the .reg file.

Next you need to change your CD key using the options.cmd file.

Now the beta patch should install correctly.  Don't forget that in order to run the beta version you need to edit the Arma 2 shortcut to run the beta patch as if it were a mod!"
,moeburn1,2012-06-29T03:04Z,"Bean-Bandit:  You have activated the FADE DRM, that is why you can't hit shit on the shooting range.  It is a very annoying DRM that makes it difficult to tell when you've actually activated it or not, until the game slowly fades into being unplayable.

Either recheck your torrent to make sure the image isn't corrupt, or just download a newer version of Virtual CD.  Make sure to mount the image to the PHYSICAL drive.   Not only will Daemon Tools not recognize the image, but you need to actually remove ALL daemon tools drives, AND exit the program.  Fade is looking for signs of DT being installed on your computer."

I need the answer 'cuz I really don't want to reinstall this game. It needs 1,5 hours to install. ..


alfaromeo, make sure ,you disable EVERY programs what uses much much of the memory. I mean , torrent, nero, steam,xfire,skype and so on.. maybe, turn off the anti virus ,too.

And for the end to other downloaders, DO NOT USE 7zip, Alcohol 120, daemon tools, magic iso and others mount programs .. I used winrar to extract the 3 files (two 4,5Gb and the last one 600mb)

When it extracted, just run setup.exe and wait. Don't close the .net 4 installer!

and don't setup the #JIMBO -> Virtual CD program. I didn't understand the installer (when you run the setup.exe the first page says how to install the game)
It is not necessary.. I run the game without this!"

go to dir /bs #JIMBO and run the keygen
5. Open options.cmd
6. Choose language then cd-key, then insert new (or something, write ""10"")

9. Go to dir /bs Expansion /bs beta and make a shortcut for arma2oa.exe.
10. In the shortcut change ""start in"" to ""D: Program Files (x86) ArmA 2"" or wherever your ArmA 2 is installed, and change the target to ""D: Program Files (x86) ArmA 2 Expansion beta arma2oa.exe"" -beta=Expansion beta;Expansion beta Expansion -mod=@DayZ -nosplash

-WHERE I'm suppossed to insert he Cd-key there is MORE than ONE command line!!!!!
-also WHERE I change language 

The DIR I was referring to was the install dir, which means that it probably should be in 'D: Program Files (x86) ArmA 2 #JIMBO'. There you have a file called ""keygen"", run it, choose ""arma 2"", insert that one, then go to the keygen again and choose ""arma 2 OA"" and insert that one as well.

Also, change language of what? The game? You do that in the start, if you want english that is, if you want something that isn't english I can't help you.

In the install DIR ('D: Program Files (x86) ArmA 2' if you forgot) you will find a file called ""options.cmd"". Run that file, you can then choose language for the options, press 1 for English and 2 for Spanish. Then choose 'Change the key of the game' by pressing 3. Now comes what seems to be the hardest part so I'll slow down.
Press 1, then 0, since you know, that spells out the letter ten, then press enter. It will ask you for the ARMA 2 cdkey, run the keygen in (No, I won't say the entire path again) and press 'generate'. Now select the lower of the two keys in the keygen, the one without lines or capital letters, and copy the text with either ctrl-c or 'rightclick and select copy'. Now to back to options.cmd and rightclick, then press paste followed by enter, now the ARMA 2 cd-key has been entered and it asks you for the arma 2 OA cd-key, go back to the keygen, select ARMA 2 OA, copy the lower cd-key, and paste it into the options.cmd, then press enter again, done, now the cd-key is entered, please don't make me explain regedit if this didn't work.

Also, Sergeant_Mark_IV, check your temp folder, when you extract things you get a copy of everything in your temp folder, the temp folder can be found in %AppData% Local Temp.

As previously stated, it's only 16 GB when everything is done, but when it's de-compressing it can't toss away the 15.5 GB file before the 16 GB folder has been extracted, therefore you will need 32 (or so) GB free, now, you CAN theoretically place the temp folder on a large HD and install on a smaller but that's just over-doing it, unless you're using an SSD drive in which case you already have."

So I had originally followed all the steps for both ArmA 2 and Dayz 1.7.1.5 Cracked Server FIXED...I had originally tried using the top key produced in the keygen, and that got me into the game.  However, when running my patched beta server on LAN mode for DayZ, it would try to connect but return that alot of files in my ExpansionBeta folder had keys not signed by the server.

When trying your suggestion of using the bottom key, it won't let me into ArmA 2 at all.  I tried a few different keys and it let me in, but again, the beta DayZ server won't let me in still."

,Germies,2012-07-09T22:01Z,"knightterror:  

I don't know about your second problem, but the first one is due to your server file in your @DayZ folder.  In your DayZ folder, go to cfgdayz.  Then right click on Server.cfg and edit it.

There will be an area called ""Joining Rules"", with requiredbuild:  in it.   Change that number to the beta patch number you have and your version will match.

You'll know the patch number, i think, when you install it will say which number you have, or during the game it will say a version number and perhaps the patch number.  These need to match the requiredbuild number.  

For the second thing, just make sure the following is after the target in the shortcut: -mod=Expansionbeta;ExpansionbetaExpansion


For my own question, the error the server displays is ""No Entry.  '.profilePathDefault'.
This is in addition to the problem that when I try to join the server thru the beta patch shortcut it says my Keys aren't signed."
,Bean-Bandit,2012-07-10T00:12Z,"This worked for me and hopefully this will work for you. If you don't feel comfortable about doing this then either find somebody that does or just walk away. If you change anything else then don't look at me cause I didn't tell you.

Ok well I finally got this to work and yet I had to go to a different torrent and follow there instructions since the ones here aren't very good. Now for you people that are having problems with installing I can't help you on that since I never had any problems at all in Windows 7 64bit.

Now as far as the mini image goes it does work but for some reason on the way it was made there's nothing inside so don't worry. Just make sure you use the VirtualCD and use one of the physical drives to mount the image, don't worry if you try to look inside and there's nothing there or it comes up as a error. Don't ask if you don't have a CD/DVD drive. BTW the mini image is in the install directory on your computer and not the images you used to install the game. You'll find the mini-image in the Program Files (86)ArmA 2#Jimbomini-image

Now as far as the cd key's. The instructions that people have given are vague and thanks to a different torrent with people giving proper guide on how to do this. I tried using the options.cmd in the jimbo folder but never got it to work properly so I used regedit to make my changes.

Go to ComputerHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeBohemia Interactive Studio

Now in here you'll see ArmA 2, ArmA 2 BAF, ArmA 2 OA, and ArmA 2 PMC. You'll also see when you click on each one of these folders on the right hand side a file that sayz KEY. That's the one you need to change and I did it for all the above that I just stated. You want to right click on the KEY file and select Modify Binary Data... It will open a new window and that's where the cd key goes. Now go to where the install was which should be by default on a 64bit OS in the Program Files (86)ArmA 2 and then go to the #JIMBO folder and you'll find the keygen.

DON'T DOWNLOAD GPNQ KEYGEN. You don't need his keygen cause the one in the folder I just gave you works fine and his link leads you to a survey page where he gets money for something that you already have and works.

Now double click on the keygen file and click ok on the window that appears. Now for each folder in the Regedit you'll need a key from the keygen so for the ArmA 2 folder in regedit you want to make sure that it says ArmA 2 in the 1st box to the left in the keygen window, if you have then click Generate and it will pop a new number out. Now you DON'T WANT the 1st row of numbers, you want the 2nd row. The ones without the - marks. The 2nd row should have numbers and LOWER CASE ONLY letters and that's the key you will be using for all the keys. So when you have the key go back to your regedit window that has the Modify Binary Data and make sure you delete what's inside of it, you can use back space or delete and the only thing that should be left is 0000 and after you've done that then enter the row of numbers and letters in the row I told yea into the window. After you have entered it in double check it and hit OK if it's correct.

While your in that folder you'll also see a File called MAIN and a location for ArmA 2, for some reason it's not pointing to where it's installed or at least that's what I think this is. So I went ahead and changed it to C:Program Files (86)ArmA 2 Not sure if this is needed but I did it anyway and I did it for all the other folders.

Ok so now you need to do the same thing as you did for the ArmA 2 folder in your regedit to the other folders I listed. ArmA 2 BAF, ArmA 2 OA, ArmA 2 PMC. Follow the same instructions as before BUT MAKE SURE IN THE KEYGEN THAT YOU CHANGE THE 1ST BOX ON THE LEFT ON THE 1ST ROW TO THE FOLDER YOU ARE CHANGING. So lets say your gonna do ArmA 2 BAF which should be the next folder. So in the keygen change the ArmA 2 to ArmA 2: BAF and then make sure you click Generate to make a new key for BAF cause if you don't it's still the same key from the 1st one you did which was for ArmA 2.

,Bean-Bandit,2012-07-10T00:13Z,"This worked for me and hopefully this will work for you. If you don't feel comfortable about doing this then either find somebody that does or just walk away. If you change anything else then don't look at me cause I didn't tell you.

Ok well I finally got this to work and yet I had to go to a different torrent and follow there instructions since the ones here aren't very good. Now for you people that are having problems with installing I can't help you on that since I never had any problems at all in Windows 7 64bit.

Now as far as the mini image goes it does work but for some reason on the way it was made there's nothing inside so don't worry. Just make sure you use the VirtualCD and use one of the physical drives to mount the image, don't worry if you try to look inside and there's nothing there or it comes up as a error. Don't ask if you don't have a CD/DVD drive. BTW the mini image is in the install directory on your computer and not the images you used to install the game. You'll find the mini-image in the Program Files (86)ArmA 2#Jimbomini-image

,Bean-Bandit,2012-07-10T02:20Z,Sorry for the double post. Thing wouldn't let me post.
,Bean-Bandit,2012-07-10T02:21Z,"Cont....

Now with the changes you made and VirtualCD up and running with the mini-image mounted in a physical drive you should be up and running and shouldn't have a FADE effect or be turned into a Black Crow flying around like I did. One other thing is that don't have Daemon Tools running at all cause it seems this game doesn't like DT.

Now this for me was just to play the game without FADE or without being turned into a crow. As far as the mod's that's a different story. I tried one of the others but I could never get the mod to run just even in single player which is what I wanted to try out. I tried one of them following there instructions but could never get the server to run to play single player. If somebody would like to help explain this I think alot of people would be thankful including me. Mainly talking about the DayZ mod.

One last thing. Does anybody know what the Launcher 1_4_0.msi file is?

Make sure after installing you run the registry.reg file after it's installed. It's in the #Jimbo folder with the rest of the stuff. I wasn't in the instructions at all on doing this and I guess they assumed you would know but that help.txt file a very vague.

Don't ask about anything else that I haven't just told you cause I won't answer you cause I don't know. This whole torrent has been nothing but a nightmare. Oh and don't run the ArmA2.exe it won't give you all the rest of the expansions. Run the Arma2OA.exe instead."

I am very disappointed that most of you are just downloading this to play DayZ.  DayZ is so incredibly lame compared to A.C.E..  

By not playing the A.C.E. mod, you are missing out on the most realistic military simulator available to civilians that ALSO manages to be fun!  But I guess if zombies are your thing, then stick to DayZ, cause its the only zombie mod there is for Arma 2."
,moeburn1,2012-07-15T00:28Z,"VitorCZ, you sir, are retarded.

Yes, this mod works with DayZ and the latest beta (94444), I have tested it myself.  But it does not include any legitimate serial numbers, so it will not work on anything but LAN games, and DayZ is multiplayer only.  So if you aren't playing DayZ on LAN, this will not work for you.

But why are you only playing DayZ when you could be playing A.C.E.?"
,Pea_Shooter,2012-07-15T03:15Z,"moeburn1
Yes, I have just did a force-recheck, and everything was 100%. Although, I downloaded it in one computer, then pasted it on my External hard drive, to a better computer, in which I have had that error during the installation. It never happened before, but maybe it got corrupted, in the hard drive. I really don't know. I'm going to be honest, I will play DayZ mod, but not only that one, and I'll play it through tunngle, so i can go multiplayer."

JKing732 at 2012-05-31 18:13 CET:
Heres a guide for installing ArmA 2 CO and DayzMod:

What you need: 31GB free space on HD and a program to mount .iso (like: Poweriso,Deamontools etc.)

1. Mount ArmA2_160_JimbusEd_DVD1 and open Setup. Follow instructions on Setup

2. The Setup will ask you to ""insert"" dvd 2, Mount ArmA2_160_JimbusEd_DVD2 on the same Disk Drive you did to Dvd 1. (It will ask later on to insert DVD 3 Just mount ArmA2_160_JimbusEd_DVD3)

3.After installing it will start extracting ArmA 2 CO files so be patient it will take quite long. (i recomend to do something else because it can get a little slow.)

(Continue if you want Dayz MOD)
4. After extracting Open up ""DayZ-1.6.0.1"" and extract ""@DayZ"" to your ArmA 2 Main file. (This is my one: C:Program Files (x86)ArmA 2 (it can be diferent for you.)

5. After extracting Right click ""arma2oa"" and Send to - Desktop (create Shortcut)
Go to the shortcup and right click and open properties. AT the end of Target Change the END
at the end of taget: it will be (arma2oa.exe"") Add this to the end ( -mod=@Dayz -nosplash) WITH THE SPACE.

6. Open and Play, to play Dayz go to multiplayer change to Lan and host your on you will be alone and able to play. If you want to play online look for some Hamachi servers to play or Tunngle.

Questions please ask, ill try to awnser, correct me if i did something wrong.

,HsKing11,2012-08-15T14:04Z,"@shamnow

go to your arma 2 directory.

look for a file call ""options"", run/open that.

Select 1/2 for your language, then follow what ever it says by pressing 1/2 again (sorry don't remember what it says) , then pick a key by typing a no. between 1-9.

Anyways.. It should resolve your problem...

I've already uninstall the game and am going to do a reinstall the nxt day so I can't tell you the exact steps."

Single player campaign stuff working just fine, decent game, pretty hard though. The Day Z mod, well I have been trying, I might get it to work. If you read their forum, arma 2 free edition supposedly works with Day Z, so why wouldn't a repack right? Thanks again."

,AimDown,2012-08-25T04:43Z,"To be honest this install was fairly easy for anyone who knows what theyre doing when it comes to torrents but the game it self, actually worked great (when it worked) it does play DayZ if you install everything correctly on that side but i had some game freezing issues, i mean it would lock up my entire computer, no Alt + F4 (to quit the game) no task manager, windows key didnt work mouse didnt move i mean the freeze was bad! had to manually turn my PC off with the power button.

& NO it isnt my PC, this baby runs battlefield 3 on ultra settings just fine, i just think there was something up with the game, i dont know exactly but there is.


overall though like i said when it ran great, the game was flawless, thanks for the torrent anyways! it was fun while it lasted lol"

,Cartonofmilk,2012-08-27T14:13Z,"My god what a piece of shit this pirated version is. the thing is it seems to be th eonyl one around (i got a different download but it was the same thing actually)/ When i tried to install it on anything but default it didn't extract anything. So i decided to clear space on the default drive. It went through the WHOLE extracting process. I still don't get exes though. And yes i tried to do the described in one of the comments, opening the start menu run and entering some command than rebooting. That didn't work either. I give up. I don't think this will ever install the exes on my computer no matter what i do. I've never NOT managed to install any cracked game in the last ten years ever. I think this one has won. Sure it works for some people so i won't tell anyone not to dl it, but be aware the odds seem to be at about 50/50 whether it will work for you or not. I WISH i had any understanding of what the trouble might be. I'm on WINDOWS 7."

It installs easy enough, but I'm not much of a computer guy, so when it went into my command prompt after installing, to install again(?) I thought I had been hacked or something... won't be downloading from Anonymous users again lol

The game itself seems ok. Couldn't tell you for sure, though, since I keep turning into a bird every 10 minutes, and have to restart."

1 problem. (1 giant one!)

as of 24-09-2012 it is after my bealive NOT possible to use this torrents included key-gen!

You receive a Battle-Eye Global-Ban #3065.

#3065 is:

A cheater/hacker used this exact torrent with a cd-key stealer also known as a ""fake hack"" to play on the servers through Tunngle and got caught! resulting in the Global-Ban.

In short terms.. No matter how many times you press GENERATE with the key-gen it will still give you a global-ban.... DAMN YOU CHEATERS!"
,tobu1211,2012-09-24T17:27Z,"NOTE!!!

My comment above is for DayZ!
Been playing DayZ for 3-5 days now and absolutely loved it! awesome mod!

Again it wont work no matter what I do! Get Global-Ban #3065 whenever I join a server through Tunngle. after the global-ban.... NO lan servers show up.

change key and they show up again just to receive another global-ban. lifes good :-"
