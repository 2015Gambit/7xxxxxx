Israel psychedelic and sensual classic, often referred to as a "Israeli new wave" film.

Plot: An Israeli girl, played by Hillit Yeshurun, (at the time Hillit Katmor) is spending her day with a self indulgent successful and amusing copywriter. 
Hillit, highly critical of herself, and body image in general, and the copywriter talks about many different subject mainly revolving sex, death, art and more. 

Images are sometimes shown in what would be well described as a "video clip", to the sounds of an American style 60's rock n' roll music by the Israeli band "The Churchils".

Still art images of the director Jacques Katmor are combined in the film. 

The movie shows the 60's Israeli urban mindset, clubs and drugs scene, and is a one of a kind glimpse to an era from the eyes of Katmor.
