At present I'm seeding a Barney Miller series for the next couple of weeks then I'll upload a torrent file with over 40 books about UFO's abductions, crashes, cover-ups etc., from 1950 to 2011. 
This file will also include 7 books by the late John A Keel, possibly one of the best writers in the genre."
