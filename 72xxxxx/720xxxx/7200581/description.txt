Re-upped by me because not enough downloaders continued seeding after I posted it. It's only a small file, please consider seeding it for a lot longer, thank you.

Long out of print, copies today can still be bought but not cheaply (check out Amazon for instance). 
This is one, if not the, first books about UFO’s to discuss in some detail about crashed saucers and their retrieval.
This book, and the journalist author Scully, was ‘debunked & discredited’ in TRUE magazine a couple of years after its publication by another journalist, J. P. Cahn, who ran a so-called exposé on Scully’s sources. 
Since then however, there has been a train of thought that the exposé was possibly engineered by the US Military Establishment because Scully was getting being near to the truth about saucer retrieval.  
Whatever one’s opinions are, this book is still an entertaining read about the ‘golden age’ of UFO’s from Arnold’s 1947 sighting to the early 1950’s when the USAF were literally floundering in what response to give to the public…..something that some believe is still the case today.

I downloaded this as a word document from the internet and cleaned up, I hope, the spelling, grammar and formatting to make it as good as the original book was, and then converted it using Calibre into epub and PDF formats.
Please seed.
