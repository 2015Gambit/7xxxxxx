,mutineer,2012-04-21T18:05Z,"Thanks again Footy,
Didn't thank you for P1 & P2, was grabbing at work (mybad) and couldn't log in.
So anyway, THANKS!!
All your hard work is much appreciated Brother.
Watching F1 in North America is pretty tough, too many mesh-head NASCAR fans here so the networks don't bother with it or have it on at 3am in the morning with no repeats.
Guys like you help out LOTS of F1 fans so thanks again,
Cheers "
