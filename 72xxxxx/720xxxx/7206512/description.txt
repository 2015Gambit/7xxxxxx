This show elevates the role of television to its highest potential for intelligent, informative entertainment. Congratulations to the producers and network that continue to offer this "hall of fame" brand of television to a wide audience. Even though I don't own a dog at present, I find this show smart, touching, amusing, and vastly instructive. Cesar Millan is a charismatic modern-day hero and his love for dogs is so pure, and so productive, as to make the rest of us gaze in awe at his accomplishments. Cesar clearly identifies the source of the dog-plus-human problems and solves them with plain talk and learn-able fixes. His true leadership genius is apparent when both dog & owner are motivated to make the changes that will ultimately bring happiness to both. Ah, imagine the results if only we could find political leaders with the same insight and ability.
