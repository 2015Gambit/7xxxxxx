QM 18 - Magnetic moments

The equilateral field geometry of KEM fields that creates magnetic moments in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]
Following on from the geometric clarification of Kinetic EM fields of charged particles in motion a simple geometry is established for the creation of Magnetic moments.

The quick, intuitive illustration of the magnitude, orientation and source of all magnetic moments is provided using the equilateral geometry of Kinetic EM fields for the first time in recorded history.

The eighteenth chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric modelling of charged particles in motion.
