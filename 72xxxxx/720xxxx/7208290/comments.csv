,kornspell,2012-04-23T06:56Z,Don't download this...it cuts to some show with Jennifer Love Hewitt around the 35 minutes mark. Proper needed...
,CarbonX,2012-04-23T07:15Z,What Kornspell said...don't bother with it.
,RexRexroth,2012-04-23T07:53Z,"36 minutes into the show, it switches to the Lifetime Channel!  ""Mad Men"" resumes about 6 minutes later, but I don't know if we're missing anything.  This is on BOTH uploads from ettv.

Gee, thanks guys."

,RexRexroth,2012-04-23T08:35Z,"Of the eight choices to download ""Mad Men"" this week (so far), two are .rar fakes with passwords which screw up your computer, two have about 8 minutes of the The Lifetime Channel stuck in the middle starting at 36 minutes (although ""Mad Men"" resumes in full afterwards, there is one .mkv file (I hate that format!), and the other three seem to be reliable .avi files."
