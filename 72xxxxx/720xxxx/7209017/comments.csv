,JamJulLison,2012-04-24T02:26Z,I have downloaded this twice now. Neither time would it load.  I tried with both mpc and vlc. Also tried converting with no luck.
,csdmy,2012-04-24T03:36Z,"after complete downloaded, the file went missing. I tried download few times, still same...wat is the problem???"

,HelloMynameisV,2012-04-24T21:49Z,"This file suks i cant open it nothing, please start doing it in AVI bro ? "
,corvo000,2012-04-24T23:34Z,"HelloMynameisV, two free tips:
1) Use a real SO, like Linux or FreeBSD;
2) Use VLC;
Bonus tip:
*) Use Google;"
,GODOKUNODAN,2012-04-25T16:34Z,"UPLOADER is a fucking ass. Thanks for converting it using bulshit linux.  This crap doesn't work for WINDOWS users, you know, 90% of the world , you useless motherfucker.   UPDATE the god damn description to say video is for linux or MAC only, you ass.   Thanks for wasting everybody's time.  Thumbs down.  "
,GODOKUNODAN,2012-04-25T16:36Z,"Since  despoiler is a useless tool,you can watch this episode of the Avengers streaming online at videobam.com"

,Navs08,2012-04-26T22:21Z,"For all those saying that it doesn't work on Windows,it does!
Just use VLC Media Player,its the best player out there,plays everything and its free!! Get it from here:

,JamJulLison,2012-04-28T09:13Z,"For those saying use VLC, that doesn't work.  If you bothered to read my comment you would see that I tried both it and Media Player Classic.  The Codec Pack i use for MPC is K-Lite.   Between the 2 of them I have never had a problem loading an undamaged video and even some damaged once I can load with VLC.  When you right click this one even it doesn't give you the normal right click option. This download is just a waste of time. "
