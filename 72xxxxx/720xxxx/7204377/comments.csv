,DrBromberg,2012-04-22T15:43Z,what is the source of this rip? if you still have it can you rip it in proper FLAC (uncompressed)? since this basically looks like a transcode of a web stream.
,ExitTheSpine,2012-04-23T19:20Z,"@Dr. Bromberg - It's ripped from the video Rush put up on their YouTube page, which as far as I can tell, is currently the only available source, and might be until the album comes out. They are releasing the single in MP3, so I'm not sure if there will be a TRUE lossless track until someone gets a hard copy of the album in their hands."
