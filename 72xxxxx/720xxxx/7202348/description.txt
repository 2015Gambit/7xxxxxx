Summary

Big Coat Productions announces production of an original series that will leave audiences wondering who or what they share their homes with ΓÇª

Paranormal Home Inspectors is a provocative factual series that follows a team of experts from different disciplines deciphering bizarre phenomena in outwardly ΓÇÿnormalΓÇÖ homes. Inside, the lights flicker, faucets turn on by themselves, and doors slam and lock on their own.

Is this paranormal activity? Or can a conventional home inspector debunk the inexplicable anomalies that make things go bump in the night?

The Paranormal Home Inspectors include a renowned psychic (Nadine Mercey), a certified home inspector (Brian Daley) and a paranormal researcher (Michelle McKay). The team uses everything from a hammer and flashlight to electronic voice phenomenon recordings to infrared video documentation and psychic abilities to differentiate structural defects from spiritual manifestations. Who will the homeowners believe; the certified home inspector and his plausible explanations or the psychic and paranormal researcher? And if the homes are truly hauntedΓÇªwill the owners stay?
