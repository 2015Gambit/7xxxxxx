,leander3932,2012-04-21T02:40Z,why is the file so big?
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T03:12Z,"small chunks so hit and runners who join and go before its seeded out complete dont take big shared chunks with them..

many connect and stay a few hours and leave 
slows it all down

also I will be blocking direct connections with me
if your not using utorrent 2,x
so be warned"
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T03:14Z,"already tba says theres 11 fake seeders on this

which is silly as only a few connected to me

and so magnet links all you get here

your best to get the torrent from demon
where im at mostly

they dont restrict to magnet links

and also have textfile downloads if isp block torrent files"
,coolhanddool,2012-04-21T04:21Z,"plse seed....
got no seeders...
this is a tv series...  7 episodes...
1 to 8 but missing the 7th 
so downloading just the first 6
if I can get some seeders"
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T04:50Z,"no its 12 episodes of which I have managed to source 7.75 of them

im the only seeder.. it will speed up soon
once other torrents seed out.. i seed more bandwidth
to more popular first

read above.. trest are fake seeders if your
seeing more then 1 at 100 percent then they
are antip2p-ers"
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T05:16Z,"

That BLACK DUDE is funny.. totally useless too
some investigator
debunked everything as faulty doors lights and
vibrations"
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T06:19Z,"some UFOs not just ghosts in some episodes it seems.. but then could shadow people be
aliens with invisibility cloaks or 5th dimen
or maybe orbs are ufos which are energy who
knows :) all fun stuff

did everyone grab the last 2 UFO torrents I shared
one greer and other USOs both have some interesting stuff in them
both special edits i did.. only sources about
in that case too :) Im surprised at the lack
of downloads on those 2 and lack of seeders
many hit and runs!"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-21T07:43Z,"do you know any canada based scene cappers?
or ANY cappers at all in canada?
this show was aired ONLY in canada so that might be why nobody got it
we couldn't "
,torcida123,2012-04-21T08:24Z,thanks mate good to see some different shows that are out there
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T10:33Z,"well im not in canada and I got it :)

one man band strikes again..

when a big group of scene cappers hackers failed

so I dont think thats a reasonable excuss TNE"
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T14:37Z,"
OK 46+ real backup seeders.. I have to leave you to it

while I complete who do you think you are AUSSIE etc"
,metalcore.,2012-04-21T15:19Z,"trialnerror, try theempire.bz they (like thebox.bz but for commonwealth countries...AUS, NZ, CAN etc.) should have lots of canadian content on there...not sure what you are looking for."
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T15:45Z,"he dont mean where to find stuff.. anyhow thats a ratio site priv tracker.. and since its open registrations makes it a target media spies
so its as dangerous as public trackers maybe more so since they dont allow proxies and vpns etc

tne is referring to my comment no scene capper got this series hes trying to ask perhaps theres no cappers there but I think theres one group since ive seen some stuff leaked out of canada
thats not re-aired in usa like discovery"
[V],psspss,2012-04-22T01:51Z,"aliens are real we definitely not the only beings
alive in the universe its too vast 

they prob been around much lonmger then us and had millions of years to travel across space
so those saying it take them long time to reach us
so its impossible they visited are clear religious
scientists who cant think outside the box

i know atleast 3 people who have see ufos

one a german couple in their 70s out doors smoking in the yard when a big silver craft lifted int he woods behind the house and shot up at
super fast speeds

they are the kind to be pot smoking and makign up stuff either and I dont see why a usa secret ctraft would want to be in their back yard LOL"
[V],psspss,2012-04-22T01:57Z,"as for ghosts... theres several scientific
ideas on this

1) energy in us slowly impacts on
the environment we live in
rocks soil metals etc (metals are crystal
are all)
and some days the right air pressure
and static can cause a playback

not to be visual but influences the human
brain which causes them to see it
when the camera dont

2) like in that UFO video (see the 3
best collection I upload) i think its
out of the blue
they show critters
these arent energy only but look like
clear jelly fish or rod creatures
that have a heat signiture and show
up on special camera
now these are in a sense a ghost
and could easily be all around us

some could be like parrots even and 
copy human behavior

3) could be so called energy of real people
somehow captured and live on ,we yet to understand still"
[V],malestrom_HH,2012-04-27T09:55Z,"First of all thank you for the torrent.This is a bunch of bull$hit though.These people are the lowest of amateurs...

1.They use non-existing equipment.
2.Out of the total runtime of 22 minutes,they investigate only 2 MINUTES (episode 2)
3.The so called ""home inspector"" Brian is just sadly a low level knowledgeable person.

In ep.2 he says that a ""cheap"" thermostat (an electronic thermostat is NOT cheap and is very accurate) just changes it's settings by itself! He is so ignorant that he says""because the thermostat is placed across an exit door that it could change the temperature and give a false reading"" .Yes,a reading of the current temperature,not CHANGE the SETTINGS!

In the same episode he says that the switching of the light in the hallway maybe due to wrong wiring.Is he drunk?A wrong wiring would NOT light up the bulb (for God's sake)......

He says that the footsteps heard in the hallway could be caused by the cats.Did he prove that,by taking the cats and letting them walk?Also he mentions that it could be by the laundry machine in the basement.WAS the laundry machine on at the time the footsteps where heard.Did he recreate it?

All in all this is just a cheap TV show with no whatsoever ""investigation"""
