This is the complete patch of Grappler Baki
the series rip by A~A
and the OVA rip by No Group
i loved the soundtrack so i include it here

when you search for Grappler Baki you well find...
Grappler Baki Eng Dub,no sub
Grappler Baki jap sound,Eng Hardsub
even the RAW is messedup
Avi extension...season one only...balh blah blah

but here you well find official release
no invalid CRC
original patch
Dual Audio
Eng softsub
decent quality for me
High quality by anidb
official episode name by A~A

am not an expert when it comes to quality checking
but i can tell that the quality is not very good,i dare to say it`s SD without explaining
it`s still the best in the web
anyway
this is the best deal you can get,take it or not

note...
when i compare the episode name given by A~A with anidb i found difference
i think it come from translation
the arrangement is ok and the story not conflict so don`t panic

my request
the size is huge for me to upload
it well take more then 20 days for you to finish
i get the file from directlink with captcha one by one with speed 30/kbs in 45 days,"the link is broken so don`t ask"
don`t complain,i suffered enough to get it so you should to :)
i will try to give the file to my friend to seed it with me to have 80/kbs in total
so please don`t be hasty and say: too slow..SEED..more speed is needed.....
if you insist,wait for 10 days and then start leeching from the others but not me
