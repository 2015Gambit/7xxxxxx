Released March 2012, with over 4500 additions and enhancements, Maple 16 reinforces our track record for consistent innovation and industry leadership in areas like ease of use and symbolic computing performance.

Over the years Maple has evolved towards a platform for interactive mathematical applications. Countless apps have been developed both by us internally as well as by our user base and shared with both Maple and non-Maple users through deployment tools like MapleNet. Seven years ago we launched the Step by Step Integration Tutor with Maple 10. Release after release we then introduced hundreds of applications, interactive assistants, tutors, and task templates. Starting today you will find over one hundred additional interactive Math Apps in Maple 16, providing insight into concepts from mathematics, physics, science, finance and engineering.
