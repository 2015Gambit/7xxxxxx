[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

I'm on day 8 of my 20-day book tour to promote No They Can't.

It's exciting to see and hear people talking about why individuals succeed where government fails. My show tonight was filmed with an audience at Florida State University.

Some students shared how my Stossel in the Classroom videos helped teach them economics. They learned more about free markets from their professors, Joe Calhoun and Jim Gwartney, who join us to explain how politicians disregard the laws of economics.

We also cover free speech on campus with Greg Lukianoff of FIRE, along with Eric Philips and Chris Morbitzer, students who faced censorship at Auburn University and the University of Cincinnati.

Brian Yablonski shares another counterintuitive idea that I write about in No They Can't: the best way to save animals is to kill them. Yablonski, who's on the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission describes how hunters are the best environmentalists. They do a better job preserving land and animals than government.

Elizabeth Foley of the Institute for Justice joins us to shed light on stupid laws in Florida--like the one that shuts down businesses that provide teeth whitening services. The state dental board claims that's illegal "unlicensed practice of dentistry."
