Reboot your PC normally and ESET should be activated. Run ESET Update.  "
[T],Hyperdrive25,2012-04-22T06:35Z,"Those of U having extraction problems:

Download Freearc: http://www.freearc.org/Download.aspx

Then right-click the SFX package and under the freearc sub-menu click on extract and type the name of the folder where you want to extract.

[T],Hyperdrive25,2012-04-28T11:09Z,"I don't think so. This patch ""activates"" the product. 

I am still using  ESET 4 on my DESKTOP.

I installed ESET 5 on my laptop. 

Personally from my experience you can continue using ESET 4 unless they discontinue support and updates for that product. (I've never had any problems with ESET 4.)

,Kartos,2012-04-29T00:47Z,if i uninstall Eset whether windows firewall still work
[T],Hyperdrive25,2012-04-29T20:58Z,"@Kartos: Eset Smart Security 5 uses a FIREWALL. ESET Antivirus 5 does NOT implement a FIREWALL.

WINDOWS 7 has a firewall by default. So for some reason or another the firewall on your PC is not working check to see if WINDOWS FIREWALL is ENABLED.

GOTO CONTROL PANEL, WINDOWS FIREWALL and check. "
,kentcave,2012-08-06T12:10Z,"Had trouble extracting this one..stopped at 52%.
I thought it must be in safe mode.
Went to safe mode and same problem.

Following instructions and getting freearc now (why oh why must make a simple extraction be so troublesome? Aint nothing wrong with winzip or 7zip =)

After extraction, will go back to Safe mode and try again. Report back later on."
,kentcave,2012-08-06T12:14Z,"Such a simple process. Instantly extracted using freearc. 

And now I hate freearc and this uploader..just because I was needlessly forced for something that should not require such a step.

Nothing personal..just against principle. lol"
