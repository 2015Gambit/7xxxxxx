VA - Club Life Vol 2 Miami Mixed By Tiesto 2012-QMI

Club Life: Volume Two Miami is Tiesto’s second installment in the Club Life 
series inspired by Miami, one of the world’s premiere dance music cities.

Club Life – Volume Two offers unique access to Tiësto’s Miami, a city renowned 
for its world class night life, beautiful party goers and everlasting summers. 
Tiësto crafts the Club Life experience masterfully, using his own exclusive 
original productions and remixes as the driving force behind the album. 
Exclusive songs, written by Tiësto specifically with the Miami club culture in 
mind, include the enormous Wolfgang Gartner collaboration “We Own The Night,” 
the aptly titled “Chasing Summers,” and a high energy team up with Russian trio 
Swanky Tunes on “Make Some Noise.”
