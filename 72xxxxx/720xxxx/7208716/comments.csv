,tzahry,2012-04-23T10:38Z,my sincere apology - when I've started downloading  and checked the file the preview got mixed up with kungfu panda. don't ask me how and why - now it shows everything ok...

Then when you go to look at the preview your media player played the data in that spot, which happened to still be a panda of the kungfu nature. "
