Theis the oxford advance dictionary8 crack file,tested and confirmed by me.
You will need to download the installation file from this up-loader http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7134415/Oxford_Advanced_Learner_s_Dictionary_-_8th_Edition
His crack does not work, so you will need mine.
Run the setup.exe in the dictionary folder, after installation, copy my crack i.e the oald8.exe to the program file folder program file/oxforad/oald8 replace the original file you are good.
This is not a bluff, I personally went through all this step to get mind working so I'm just helping anyone who will appreciate it.
Note: strictly for version 8. good luck.
