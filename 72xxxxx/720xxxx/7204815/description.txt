Richard C. Hoagland presented his contention that the success of the new movie John Carter [of Mars]:

 is being deliberately sabotaged by a "cabal" that is against the public learning the truth about Mars' ancient civilization and technology. Based on a 1912 Edgar Rice Burroughs novel, the movie's depiction of Barsoom (Mars) correlates with NASA's data on the actual ancient ruins of Mars, he said, adding that Burroughs placed the capitol city in the same geographic location as Cydonia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydonia_(region_of_Mars)
 

Hoagland, who is planning a new book to be titled The Heritage of Mars: Remembering Forever, believes that Mars' civilization suffered from a huge cosmic war that brought about its end. Elements of a secret, suppressed technology that could be used for either regeneration or destruction are shown or alluded to in John Carter, he noted.

He also talked about issues concerning America's current space program, and reacted to Robert Zubrin's editorial:

 which is critical of the Obama administration's lack of funding for Mars exploration. The new rover, Curiosity, which is due to land on Mars in around 4 months, may return atmospheric data supporting the presence of microbes, as well as photos of artifacts, Hoagland suggested. Though the White House is cancelling robotic missions to Mars, it's possible they may yet push for manned missions to the Red Planet, especially if Russia and/or China start planning to do so, he commented.

Quakes & Strange Sounds

First hour guest, author and earthquake sensitive Cal Orey talked about the connection between quakes and the strange sounds people have been hearing. She believes the sounds are not man-made but "an act of nature without explanation." Orey intuits that the sounds could be heralding a huge earth event such as a pole shift that will make something like the Japanese quake/tsunami seem small by comparison.
