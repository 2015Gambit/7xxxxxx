,Twilight-Sparkle,2012-04-20T20:05Z,"@ sumosmurf, kind of yes, it reminded me of the show and inspired me to go find my VHS copy, and since there wasn't a good quality version online I decided to upload this"
,melzipan,2012-04-25T05:36Z,"I'm encouraged by the promise of better quality, but we need seeders! "
,melzipan,2012-04-27T06:56Z,"Seriously, there is no seeder that has 100% of the data. I'm more than willing to seed for a couple weeks, but I'm going to need 100% of that data. What's it going to take? 

Op? Anyone?"
,Twilight-Sparkle,2012-04-27T13:30Z,"I'm uploding as fast as i can, most people seem to be at about 80 percent atm. at the current speed the first few people will get it by monday"
,melzipan,2012-05-03T14:26Z,Seeding now.
