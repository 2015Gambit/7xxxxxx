Overview:

War and Peace broadly focuses on NapoleonΓÇÖs invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men.

A s NapoleonΓÇÖs army invades, Tolstoy brilliantly follows characters from diverse backgroundsΓÇöpeasants and nobility, civilians and soldiersΓÇöas they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most movingΓÇöand humanΓÇöfigures in world literature.
