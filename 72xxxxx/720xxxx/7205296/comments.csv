,crisvincent,2012-04-22T08:51Z,"..and to follow up my last comment.
V = 10
A = 10..
if you downloaded the 01-02 of Daman4Iife, then you can expect the same quality.."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-22T11:05Z,Might Consider Uploading my Copy of Avatar The last Airbender. 
,WobSawd,2012-04-22T12:49Z,"Great quality, thanks for uploading. Episode 1 and 2 were released on the season premier, right? And from now on it'll be just 1 episode a week?"
,lonewolf265,2012-04-22T13:18Z,"A/V: 10/10!  

@WobSawd yes, now it will be released weekly.  "
,kaosturtle,2012-04-22T20:27Z,"This is fantastic quality, same size as the top seeded episode but perfect quality instead of low quality like the most seeded one"
,bag_14,2012-04-23T09:27Z,Daman4Iife Thank you! Please upload your copy of Avatar The Last Airbender please O please!!!! :)
,Leiss,2012-04-23T14:13Z,Great quality on both audio and sound :) Thanks
,punkfac3,2012-04-23T16:36Z,"Please do upload your Avatar the Last Airbender. I keep looking for decent quality ones all over and you're stuff is good, just don't blow it up to 1080p like others and then say that it is. The show never played in HD i just want good standard 480p"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-23T17:32Z,"theres no reason to upscale avatar the last airbender, is a 4:3 show so upscaling would be unreasonable for it."
,mattnoble6,2012-04-23T20:50Z,"@Daman4Iife this is awesome quality upload, thanks, if you can keep them at this size it will be greatly appreciated thanks again"
