Misty Edwards is a Christian musician and worship leader. Since May 1999 she has been a worship leader and song writer at the International House of Prayer in Kansas City, Missouri where she serves as a staff member and intercessory missionary. Closely affiliated with Mike Bickle and other International House of Prayer Leadership, she can also be found teaching and leading classes at International House of Prayer University. Misty shares much of the International House of Prayer doctrines and theology.

Edwards is a favorite in the IHOP prayer room as well as at the annual Onething conference and is known for her intimate approach to worship and songwriting. Many allude her worship style to that of Jason Upton as being very spontaneous in nature.
