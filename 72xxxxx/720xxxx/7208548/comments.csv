,upskirtsniper,2012-04-23T20:10Z,"Just finished downloading. Excellent quality as always
TY"
,otnemem,2012-04-23T22:07Z,"Actually this one still had the glitch for me.
Will download another release for archive purposes."
,otnemem,2012-04-23T22:08Z,Oh forget it. My RSS downloader got the previous version. This one should be fine.
,sawatts,2012-04-23T23:59Z,"No sound at all on this one for me - using DLNA Home Cinema system.
...nor when using DivX player on PC...
...Windows Media Player refuses to play it...
...same with VLC...

,rmonkey4,2012-04-24T00:23Z,Does this thing work or is it the same piece of crap which fails at aprox 37 min
,tjaffz,2012-04-24T00:34Z,"This is the first MKV that I can't play with my DLNA server & client. Samsung All Share doesn't find the file but all prevoius S01 and all IMMERSE S02.
No go with DivX Plus and the MKV codec."
,vafler86,2012-04-24T00:49Z,"@swattas: ive got the same problem. No sound when i try to play it on my tv. thats why im looking for another file to download.
That said, the video was 10 and i havent try to play the file on my pc. 
thanks to the uploader but it just didnt work out for me."
,wcotaku,2012-04-24T02:47Z,"If the audio cuts out after the 'previously on Game of Thrones', try installing the AC3 Filter 2.1 - worked for me."
,int7777,2012-04-24T07:24Z,You da man ez.. much appreciated as always
,FulciLives,2012-04-24T09:36Z,"I had no issues playing this at all. For the record I use Linux Mint 12 and SMPlayer. Again it played back A-OK without any issues or glitches.

Quality is excellent!

Thank you for the upload!"
,FulciLives,2012-04-24T10:08Z,"Follow Up To What I Wrote Above:

Tried it in VLC (Linux version) and it works fine. I played it from about 35 minutes through to the 40 minute mark. It played without any glitches.

I then remuxed the MKV to a M2TS using the Linux version of tsMuxeR and it created the M2TS without errors. I've found that when there is an error in the video stream that tsMuxeR will error out during this process and yet here it did not.

I file seems to be 100% A-OK

I really hate losers who rag on perfectly good files !!!

Again thank you for the upload!
"
,FulciLives,2012-04-24T10:12Z,"I wanted to make a follow up to my statement above.

I ran the MKV through VLC (the linux version) and it played A-OK. I played it from approximately the 35 minute mark to just past the 40 minute mark. It was smooth as butter with no glitches.

Also I ran it through the linux version of tsMuxeR. I used to use this program for making M2TS files when I used a PS3 as a media server (the M2TS file format is native to the PS3). I found that if there were any glitches in the video file that the M2TS remuxing would error out. It created the M2TS without any issues. I then played that file in VLC from roughly 35 minutes to 40 minutes and once more it played fine.

The file seems to be 100% A-OK.

I really hate it when people bitch about perfectly good files. Thanks again for the upload!"
,voltaire64,2012-04-24T13:54Z,The English subs go out of sync about 3/4 the way through using vlc.
,Ezel,2012-04-25T00:16Z,"This release worked fine for me in VLC 2.0.1 on Windows 7. No audio/video/sync glitches at all what I could see.
@voltaire64: There are no subs in this torrent. If you downloaded it from another place it might be that it's not for the REPACK-version, but instead for the other glitch version that makes the subs out of sync."

,CortexiJay,2012-04-28T05:04Z,No sound here when I tried to play it on my blu-ray player. A real shame :(
,Thor-csf,2012-04-28T11:04Z,"F**king AVS, doesn't know how to encode a file?! The audio is in STEREO!! Not in 5.1 channels as in all IMMERSE releases! >:(
Moreover, the audio is with Header Stripping, which makes it unable to be played in most Home Cinema players (Blu-Rays, HD TVs, etc.) and some PC media players too.
All IMMERSE releases had 5.1 audio and NO Header Stripping.
Please, IMMERSE, do all the ripping from now on! Or teach AVS how to do a proper encoding."
,Thor-csf,2012-04-29T01:39Z,"For everyone that is having issues with the sound (no sound) when playing on Home Cinema systems, here's what you can do to fix it. You will have to remove the Header Stripping by remuxing the file (not re-encoding, no quality loss!). Don't worry, it's easy!

1- You will need 'MKVToolnix' (free software) {Google it, first result [bunkus dot org]};

2- click on 'Downloads' link (up there, after 'News');

3- If you use Windows, click on 'Windows' button, under the 'Downloads' title; click on the link 'an installler' or '7zip archive', which one you prefer;

4- install it and open (it's name will be 'mkvmerge GUI'); click on 'File' and then on 'Options';

5- check 'Disable reader removal compression for audio and video tracks by default'; hit 'OK';

6- In 'Input' tab, click on 'add'; select the movie file and open it (you will notice the audio and video tracks in the 'Tracks, chapters and tags' box - leave all checked!);

7- click on 'Start muxing' down there. Just wait a few seconds and a new movie file will be created with NO Header Stripping on the audio;

8- now you will be able to play it on regular Home Cinema players WITH the sound! Enjoy! ;)"
,davipc,2012-05-07T03:37Z,"Thanks for your guide @Thor-csf! Since we don't have a better file out there, I used your instructions and am finally able to watch it on my home TV set.

AVS, thanks for the upload! But on the next ones, please use the 5.1 audio, and absolutely NO stripped audio headers!"
