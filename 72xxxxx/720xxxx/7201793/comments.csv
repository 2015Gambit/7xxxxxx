Copy then Paste  from the included downloaded  folder : aerosoftdangerous airports 1barrascenery .bgl files into: 
FSXaerosoftDangerous Airports 1BarraScenery  Folder .Do this for the rest of the files into there respective Scenery folders
That way, this ensures they are all in there correct folders(i did it this way)
Start FSX and go to your Settings,Scenery Settings to check Dangerous Airports is there at the top and click ok.Hope this helps"
