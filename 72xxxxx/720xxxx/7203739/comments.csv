Nepotu, NOT to you usual standards:

* Sound cuts off every other minute
* This nagging Logo screen pops up out of nowhere and you have no idea who long its on the  screen:
  Logo for NBA.TV

Surprised no one has complained.

Again, thanks for the up, but some many sound cut-off, no watchable."
