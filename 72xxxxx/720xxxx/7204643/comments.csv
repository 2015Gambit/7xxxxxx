,briebee72,2012-04-23T19:14Z,Does this have ciniva protection? you know that new copy protection craop that is that audio watermark that cuts your sound off after 20 mins.  Man that new protection crap is a mess for people with newer equipment that detects it.
,vacario,2012-04-25T19:40Z,"How come the screen shots ratio is off ? Tall and thin ? When I play the movie it looks just like the screen shots ,, Is it normal to look like that or is the movie suppose to look stretched ? I'm trying to figure this out in my settings , my results are the same :-("
[T],honchorella31,2012-04-25T19:50Z,u do realise that this is 4 a 3dtv u press the 3d button on your remote n select the side by side option and your done
,vacario,2012-04-25T21:12Z,"Yes I do ,, I have a 2011 Samsung 3D ,, press the 3d button ,, looks just like the screen shots tall and thin ? Its in 3d , just stretched ,,, "
[T],honchorella31,2012-04-26T09:00Z,thats your problem samsung 3dtvs internal media player is shit at playing movies that hav had the black bars cropped off i had 1 n had 2 sell it because of that i went n got an lg its loads better picture quality is 100 times better and the 3d was far better.
,vacario,2012-04-27T01:07Z,"Curious ,, why are the screen shots not in ratio?"
[T],honchorella31,2012-04-27T09:12Z,the screen shhot r in ratio they look like that because it half sbs n not full sbs if it was full sbs your tv would not play it because there would be to much resoution. when u select the sbs option on your tv it overlaps the 2 images n they become correct at least they do on my 3dtv anyway

You do not know what you are talking about. Fist I did a lot of research that took over a year to decide what 3D TV I will buy and decided to go with a Samsung, 3D which now has one of the best ratings on the web. Second I don't know why vacario, is having that problem because I DO NOT! as a matter of fact I have almost 200 3D movies MKV, MP4, AVI, etcetera and all of them play perfect. I will say I do appreciate your upload very much it was very kind of you if you did upload this file however please do some research on which 3D TV's are are good and which are not before you make a ridiculous comment like you did."
[T],honchorella31,2012-05-19T20:38Z,@kenbad i dont need 2 research i had a samsung 3dtv and it was crap so i bought an lg n av never had any problems thats y i said it.
