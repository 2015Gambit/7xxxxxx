,halfchaos,2012-04-23T19:03Z,Don't unzip the files. Just copy them to your DLC folder.
,Leviathan07,2012-04-24T00:29Z,"Can anyone confirm the integrity of this upload? Currently it's sitting at +1/-1, which is suspicious."
,Arathian,2012-04-25T12:00Z,"Clean from my virus scan. Works fine. First time it won't work, second time you open the game, it works.

Props for the uploader."
,halfchaos,2012-04-26T19:07Z,"I just repacked this from the other CK2 1.05b that was torrented recently. So thank our russian brothers, not me. ;)"

,cindrellig,2012-04-29T23:22Z,"Where is the DLC folder supposed to be? I searched the crusader kings II directory on x86 and couldnt find a dlc folder, then when i made one and put the files in it there was nothing new about the game"

,magnum1234,2012-06-08T04:52Z,Which one is the ruler designer? folder 005 is empty for some reason and the others are music mongol and dynasty ones
,halfchaos,2012-06-12T17:43Z,@magnum1234 dlc005 is ruler designer. the dlc just activates it. it shipped with the game deactivated so they could get money from it.
,magnum1234,2012-06-17T05:37Z,do i have to update it to the new version?
,DadeRoyal,2012-06-23T16:17Z,"@magnum, no just copy the Ruler Designer DLC file into the 005 folder. Open the game, exit out then open it again and it will be working. I did the same thing from the other torrent. The one this guy ripped the files from."
,pontusdef,2012-06-26T21:41Z,"Could anyone upload the new Sword of islam, songs of chaliph and african unit pack please? "
,SanicK,2012-06-27T04:09Z,"@halfchaos thank you very much for this wonderful torrent! can you please upload the new Sword of islam, songs of chaliph and african unit pack please? from the same source. thank you very much!"
,kentcave,2012-06-30T07:42Z,"Beware, as far as I know..its a hassle to re-activate Ruler Designer, caused of SoI dlc. Your choice then.."
,halfchaos,2012-06-30T17:22Z,sword of islam has been uploaded by someone else. you can find it if you search. :)
,kimmj,2012-07-26T06:36Z,"can anybody who got this dlc tell me where they got their crusader kings 2? I did exactly what halfchaos told me but it didn't work and i am suspecting there might be something wrong with the one i got. I got it from here:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7201402/Crusader_Kings_II___1.05b__amp_amp__Ruler_Designer_DLC

Is there other people who got their dlc working when they got their crusader kings from here?"
,Vilkaras,2012-08-25T23:28Z,same here i can check and uncheck the dlc but it still acts as if i didn't have it
