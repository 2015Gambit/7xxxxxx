,Cryonica,2012-04-23T09:29Z,The TTC now says the videos for downloading contain an encrypted watermark that makes it possible to trace the original uploader.  Does anyone know how to remove this kind of watermark?  
[V],dohduhdah,2012-04-23T16:34Z,"It would be interesting to buy the same course twice with different customer accounts, to compare the two versions to see if each download has been made unique and traceable with a watermark. 
I've heard that re-encoding might get rid of the watermark (for instance with the free program AVIDEMUX)."
[V],dohduhdah,2012-04-23T16:36Z,"I wonder if they can really sue you though. Suppose you buy many ttc courses and you have them on a usb disk which you happen to forget while travelling on a train. Then you don't bother to retrieve it, since it's only a backup copy and these courses end up on p2p. Does that mean you can get sued by TTC?"

If you find the following courses, please up them when you can, I'm sure someone else is wanting:

Origins of Great Ancient Civilizations (Harl is amazing and this compact course must be awesome!);
Era of the Crusades (following your great uploads of History of Ancient Rome and Rome and the Barbarians, also The World of Byzantium, specially this one);
Money and Banking: What Everyone Should Know (there's already an audio version available, but someone said there's a lot of remissions to graphics and visual stuff, so...)
Cheers!"

""Will to Power: The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche"" must be interesting! I already read two of his books, he is awesome!"
