This audiobook is the first book of the Bailey Weggins mystery series by Kate White.  There are 11 files in this unabridged version recorded by Karen White.  Ripped from Audio CD.  I don't have a total hours, but each file is about an hour of running time.

Bailey Weggins is a crime writer for Gloss magazine in Manhattan. Smart and savvy, she's got a sixth sense when it comes to seeing the truth in a story. The action starts when a dead body is found in the editor's home.
