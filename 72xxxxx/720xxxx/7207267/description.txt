The breathtaking beauty of the Swiss Alps provides the backdrop for smoldering
sensuality in HoBo. Roland, a handsome forty-year old businessman, is quite
fond of his lovely wife, Doris - but that doesn't stop him from taking advantage
of the lovely young girls who are always attracted to him. Not that Doris isn't
open-minded, however - after seeing an erotic movie with her husband, the couple
ends up going with a lovely young woman and engaging in a torrid threeway affair.
But this erotic interlude leaves Doris with a bad taste, and she gives Roland the
perfect opportunity to bring home all the girls he's ever wanted; and Doris gets
a chance to live it up with Didier and his best friend. But too much of a good
thing is the downfall of this liberated couple. They will catch themselves
indulging their hot bodies in some very hot sex!
