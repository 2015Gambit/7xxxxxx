[V],globeplus,2012-04-22T19:45Z,"To pyhunter101 : hi my friend and thank you for telling me about the inconvenience of some executables to run the games on the other version , the true is that i trusted a little bit to much on the program that i used to make the executables , i looked to the distribution of the worked executables on the free version of the tool with some indiference but i guess that i was wrong then my friend i got angry in a positive way with that and started searching the best easy way around to really give in a pratical way all the dosbox games included and my general search tells me that the DosShell frontend for the DosBox games with my complentary nice screenshots style maked the perfect team to the tool and in 3 days i got this new version ready , of course that the preliminary 15 days on the basic Easy DosBox was important because i already had all the screenshots alphabetically and in the correct place for not speaking all the games ready to go without protections and more light and easy to run as possible and that was a really great contribute for the work with the DosShell environment , it was delicious work but of course 3 days anyway , i hope all of you like and specially you enjoy all the games in 1 click way because i really didnÂ´t like knowing that was necessary to run the games inside the folders and maybe not on the best conditions ...

Happy EasyDosBox to all of you ..."
[V],globeplus,2012-04-22T19:54Z,"This comment it is just to say that the installer is multi-11 but of course the EasyDosBox is in english but the tool it is very visual , so not really important that , the games is the games normally in english with a few exceptions for other languages and some games can be multi-5 , i suggest the users to click on the ConfEditor when starting the tool because have general important information to help run the games and important games notes beside the common configuration that it is usual on the conf file of the dosbox ... it is a pleasure work in nice new creative tools  , so happy gaming to all of you ..."
,pyhunter101,2012-04-22T23:16Z,Thanks for your hard work.
[V],globeplus,2012-04-23T11:31Z,"To pyhunter101 : thank you for telling me about the problem on the first version and yes i do care that the files beeing better as possible to the users but just talking between us , i checked 2802 zip dosbox files , many not ok , other repeated and other getting ununexpected problems on the executables for this or that reason and in the end i get a little more than 850 then when i maked this 2nd version i repaired a few more games now integrated on the tool and i got with some collections close 890 games , reference to the Lemmings Collection that it s a great old work for the DosBox that i did and because it is a special collection that was worked separatdly i decided to include her in a particular button outside the main DosShell context to the games , i am proud about the work because i got the feeling that if i needed to started again all the work i probably do exactly the same thing , so it was really the correct work for this fantastic tool for the DosBox games , i finish this comment telling you and all the other readers of this comment a secret , somehow beside the number of zipped games checked to prepare for this tool , maybe canÂ´t be not to much ambicious reaching the 1000 games mark but the real difficulty that makes this objective tough to achieved is the fact that i also excluded poor games that i think no one want to play because poor graphics or things like that , so what we have for the moment is close 890 games with the available collections included with a nice possible selection of games ...

See you around and enjoy your EasyDosBox with DosShell integration on the tool ..."
[V],globeplus,2012-04-23T14:52Z,"QUICK NOTE :

At the Zelliard game on the letter Z of the DosShell , right mouse click at the game icon then select edit entry then choose game.exe to run the game , the game.bat file that it is the current indication not doing the read of the game correctly .

Only detected this little inconvenience on this game , nothing else to report . "

,pyhunter101,2012-04-26T16:59Z,"Globe, I know this is probably me doing something wrong but I still can't get it to work.I'm getting the message ""The specified file was not found"" this time in the dosbox menu."
[V],globeplus,2012-05-05T00:19Z,"Hi and the installation must be at the C drive and that it is the only thing essencial , if your main computer hard drive have the C letter it will be no problem , i think maybe you can be needing a new operative system installation if this type of problems keep happening , if the computer hard drive is the C drive i canÂ´t see any problem otherwise run the dosshell and check the availaibility of the games on the letters and correct if it is case but that it is not supposed to happen because works 100% on a C drive installation !..."
