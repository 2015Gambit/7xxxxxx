,illusion121,2012-05-12T12:53Z,Yify your 3d movies are the best. Nobody can compare in quality and size... Thanks so much for all your hard work once again!
,davin_g,2012-06-22T05:28Z,I have a question. All of YIFYs videos are all pixalated after I burn them and watch them on my Samsung Tv. I use visual hub to convert and burn. Is it just his videos are low quality or is there a trick when burning 3d movies because all other movies I burn the quality is fine. TY YIFY...just wondering if I'm the one doing something wrong.
