The passing of Levon Helm, drummer and singer for The Band, affected me more than I would have thought. I was immediately taken back in time to when I was 14 and I had snuck into the local drive-in movie theatre to see Easy Rider. One song in that movie touched me was "The Weight" and Levon's soulful county influenced voice struck a chord with me that changed how that teen boy listened to music. It opened up new vistas that expanded my musical tastes and allowed me to explore a lot of new music.

Rest in peace Levon. Heaven gained a beautiful voice and soul.
