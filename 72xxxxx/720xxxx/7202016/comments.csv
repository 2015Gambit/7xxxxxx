,metalcore.,2012-04-28T12:38Z,"hey mac.moe....i downloaded this to check the quality for you

i have some suggestions to make for when you rip :)

you should be able to make this widescreen by shifting the dimensions of the aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9 when you are encoding.

if you changed the frame-rate from 29.976 to 23.976....this will allow you keep the same filesize but increase quality.

also be sure that you are doing 2 passes when encoding.

hope this helps, if you need any more direction im happy to help....ill check back here to see if you comment ...mc."

I do usually change the aspect to 16:9, but the default is 4:3 and I do sometimes forget to change it
I'll try the frame rate"
