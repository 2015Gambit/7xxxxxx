In this drama based on the novels by Henry Sienkiewicz, the border between 17th-century Poland and Turkey comes alive as the two regions wage bloody battles -- Poland in defense of its land, and Turkey as the invaders. Polish colonel Michal Wolodyjowski (Tadeusz Lomnicki) is remembered for his gallant attempts to gather his countrymen for one last stand-off with swarming Turkish troops. Jerzy Hoffman directs.
