,majmi,2012-04-21T21:44Z,Thanks Ameet! Great upload!!!!

Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows (2011) 720p BRRiP x264 AC3-AMEET6233

,muLineZu,2012-04-22T14:40Z,"@bobbysg: I agree that is not an academic term and is not properly used in a literary context, but as a community uses it, it becomes legit - at least in that community. Feel free to call it as it pleases you: collection, box-set, first + sequel, or whatever. For more info see: en.wiktionary.org_wiki_duology
I don't think that ameet invented the term - if you try a search on TPB, you'll find a lot of ""duologies"" - and it would take the same typing effort just to write thanks for the upload..."
,bobbysg,2012-04-22T17:55Z,"Good point, muLineZu.  I should have thanked for the upload.  Well done, ameet6233.

(But duology is still not a word, despite its usage.  If you want to create a word, it would be more appropriate to call it a ""diology,"" combining a greek prefix with a greek suffix rather than mixing latin and greek.  I realize ameet6233 isn't the first to use the term, and I also realize that duology is commonly used by this community.  I'm just trying to do my small part to make the community more literate.)"
