it is not re-airing anytime soon
when it does i'll post it"
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T06:35Z,"ta.. I didnt think you going to do this

odd ai thought they said on their site was re-airing
SP01 before this one.. guess they changed it again

think someone posted a comment about air times on
my extended recap of SP01
"
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T06:37Z,"i thought sp01 was part of the old season
and this one was Sp01 of S02 rather then sp02 .. but I dont know
just seems odd having 2 speicals as a lead in
for a new season"
,CaptainCaustic,2012-04-21T06:43Z,"Thanks, man!"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-21T06:52Z,why would 2 specials at the start of a season be odd?  ghost adventures has done it a couple times
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T06:55Z,"no doubt some will call it E01 and mess up the naming lol
cheers"
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T06:57Z,"well when I looked about.. the guides was calling the first special S01E09 i believe.

so I think I decided to call it S01E09_SP01

which covered all bases.. but now it could be S02SP01 for alcatraz.. 

who cares I guess. prob have to rename it all later
regradless as long as special 2 is in the title theres no confuse"
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T06:58Z,is anyone seeding this im getting 0 seeding it but 4 in the list :)
,yinyang1968,2012-04-21T07:03Z,Thank You so much for this upload :-)  I was worried no one would catch the show and share it. 
[V],psspss,2012-04-21T07:03Z,"this is part of a paste my my ext recap rip
comment.. this was reported in a press release.
they say s02 kicks off with a special
so that means last special was ending with s01?

[T],trialNerror,2012-04-21T19:54Z,how is a crazy bitch that's going to places other people have already investigated the hell out of and there is ample amounts of documented history she can feed off of before going there legit?  fuck psychic mediums nothing but a cheap circus side show act
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-21T19:56Z,"i only did this cap as per requests of users on my blog.

psychics. not my thing. 
evps, thermal anomalies, apparitions, objects moving by unseen forces in controlled environments... now that shit is sexy good"
