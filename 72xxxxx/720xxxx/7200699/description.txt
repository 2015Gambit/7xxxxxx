Overview: Live wallpaper with mountains reflecting in the waves of a lake.


Breathtaking mountains reflecting in the calm relaxing waves of the lake. Flowers and grass in the foreground, birds in the air and a live sky with clouds, sun and moon depending on the time. Supports horizontal scrolling on all devices.

While the free version is beautiful and fully functional, most settings are locked. The full version is highly customizable with loads of settings and offers "real time" mode with seamless color transitions between all times of the day.

Based on the extraordinary photo "Mount Shuksan, Picture Lake" by JoAnn Zheng (edited by Michal Osmenda).
