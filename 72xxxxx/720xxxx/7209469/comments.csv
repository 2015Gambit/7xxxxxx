,NarutoNamikaze,2012-04-23T18:28Z,"@ sid4455442
Underworld Awakening story was shit. It should have gone for longer. why do you want in 3D then. I was very dissapointed with the film"
,OyskyBoysky,2012-04-24T01:51Z,"Everytime you upload something I sing out loud ""go east go west YIFY is the best ""!

,kabir01,2012-04-24T21:11Z,"Hey..thanx for this movie..!!!
Can u upload THEY GREY 2012"
,8ax_,2012-04-24T23:20Z,"A little tutorial on how to make rips similar to YIFY's for obscure/foreign movies:

1. Download StaxRip
2. Load movie
3. Audio : Edit : AAC HE-AAC 48 kbps
4. Codec : H264 Two-Pass Slower
5. Size : 700MB OR bitrate : 1250kbps (the 1250kbps will be a bit larger, but better quality, about 850-900MB)."
,geez_r1,2012-04-25T06:56Z,YIFY never seems to disappoint..... 
[T],FatFreddy473,2012-04-25T15:29Z,will 1080p come or not? thank you :)
,gloteron,2012-04-25T17:47Z,Thank you!
,BDPound,2012-04-25T20:28Z,"I am thankful for everything on TPB, and for the great uploaders. But I have to ask, why is this in Highres? At 650MB, the only screen this will look good on will be too tiny to watch effectively. When speeds are averaging 30Mbps and harddrives are measured in Terabytes, why release pixelated crap? Just sayin."
[T],tta854,2012-04-26T06:04Z,Can you rip Lion King 2 or Joyful Noise?
,masterpiece007,2012-04-27T04:47Z,Superb!
