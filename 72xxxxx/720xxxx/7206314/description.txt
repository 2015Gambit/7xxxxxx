I do not own this song. All rights go to the original artist. I just REALLY love the song, and I want to share it with all of you. Excellent quality, MP3 format, artist and genre information included. No album info or artwork, sorry!

                                        LYRICS
When will you come home
When will you be mine
I have waited so long just to see you smile
So tell me why do only these feelings in me
Calling for your name
Why do all these dreams with in me
Always end the same?

When will you come home.. 

ENJOY AND BE SURE TO SEED!
