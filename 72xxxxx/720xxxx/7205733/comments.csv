,user087,2012-04-22T10:28Z,"What are you guys talking about. 
There is no rar in this upload, only a txt file and a avi file. "
,killerkayla187,2012-04-22T10:28Z,Its .AVI not rar you dumbass trolls
,killerkayla187,2012-04-22T10:32Z,How are my comments being hidden and only the trolls are showing?  This is .AVI and NOT password protected
,falena1122,2012-04-22T10:54Z,thank you so much for all ufc uploads
,oneleggoalie,2012-04-22T10:58Z,Network TV spies and special ops. Or they just don't know the alphabet very well. Thanks for the upload dude.

Hey....scfindy, maybe you should stop trolling on every upload you stupid fuck!

Big thanks."
,markien,2012-04-22T12:24Z,"killerbee, there is no password. go eat som honey"
,bondjing,2012-04-22T13:20Z,"Normally the dl's are fairly fast.

Be warned this dl is super slow."
,pilot234,2012-04-22T13:50Z,IS NOT PASSWORD PROTECTED. ITS PROBABLY SOME ASSHOLE TROLL TRYING TO DETER PEOPLE FROM DOWNLOADING. GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD  AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED!
,Cyberjanne,2012-04-22T13:56Z,"No password, scene4all don't do that stuff I think, playing with VLC player, no problems at all!"
,DeeOneMe123,2012-04-22T15:44Z,It is password protected and it is zipped into .rar format. Whats worse is the read me file gives you a link and Avast picked up the link as a threat. I would be careful of any file that has a password or .rar file.
,DeeOneMe123,2012-04-22T15:52Z,"Why would you idiot dumb asses say this is not passworded? It comes with a read me file that has a link for you to use to ""get the password"". Download the fucking thing and try it before you comment. Otherwise your just as bad as the shit head who uploaded this piece of shit virus. This doesn't work for shit STOP SEEDING!!!"
,DeeOneMe123,2012-04-22T15:54Z,"Cyberjanne at 2012-04-22 13:56 CET:

No password, scene4all don't do that stuff I think, playing with VLC player, no problems at all!

You think??? what a fucktard..."
,DeeOneMe123,2012-04-22T16:03Z,"For some reason my last comment was deleted but long ass story short... Whoever says this Upload doesn't have a .rar file and a read me file which gives you a link to ""get the password"" is a fucktard. Also Avast picked up the link as a threat. Stop saying this is good. Why would you waste peoples time. Don't think or guess. Download and then comment...I'm not a ""Troll"" or trying to fuck up this uploader. Hell I registered an account just to comment on this upload. STOP SEEDING!!!"
,Sojin,2012-04-22T16:56Z,"Normally I don't complain, but after seeding the entire night, to wake up and find this password bullshit, it's pretty weak. Ya 
I know that when you check the files on the website, it shows no protected rar, but wait until youve DL'd it."
,pablojuana,2012-04-22T17:13Z,"password protected rar.
..deleted"
,bobster0007,2012-04-22T17:19Z,you will pe pissed off after you download and have to do survey crap ....i just deleted this crap and remember the uploader as to never trust his work again....you have been WARNED
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2012-04-22T18:21Z,"All these idiot Zuffa employees lying about it having a password (It doesn't) justifies getting it for free in the first place. If they've got money to waste on something so stupid as an army of guys to post fake comments then they're obviously rolling in cash and downloading their shit for free isn't hurting them one bit. In fact, it's even created new job opportunities in their company."
,DaddyBob,2012-04-22T18:43Z,"I have always looked for Sir.Paul when I dl the UFC events and have always been happy with what I got. I don't understand the password protection this time. If someone can use this without doing surveys, it sure would be nice if you told us how."
,daffybas44,2012-04-22T19:05Z,"Thank you scene4all, excellent upload as always! Always fast upload and perfect!  
DonÂ´t know what these folks are talking about? NO PASSWORD here, just download it and enjoy, VLC is da shit by the way! ;)"
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2012-04-22T22:17Z,"@daffybas44:

It's just a bunch of Zuffa employees posting fake comments. I gotta' hand it to them, they're better at it than some others. Some of their fake comments sound appropriately pissed off. But it's all bullshit and they really should give up. The skull system at TPB renders their efforts null and void. But once again the simple fact that this company has the spare money to hire and actually pay people to do something so asinine proves that downloading from torrents like this one helps the US economy. We're creating jobs right here at TPB... even the president has a tough time doing that these days."
,bigoledude,2012-04-22T22:21Z,"There are multiple versions of this torrent up, some are a scam .RAR file some an AVI.  I know, Loaded the AVI first an then found another.  Check the file format on your HD as soon as the download starts and you""ll know what you have coming in.  Sir Paul is usually the dogs bollocks with his uploads so the other fake one can suck a bag-o-dicks. "
,Ouzotime,2012-04-23T02:25Z,whats up with u ppl 28 worthless comments not 1 about quality...
,pjatgv,2012-04-23T02:59Z,VLC player is a worthless piece of shit compared to Gom player. see for yourselves
,pjatgv,2012-04-23T03:07Z,and another thing. fuck you trolls that say this has password. you are dumb for not downloading the right torrent or you are zuffa employees. so why the fuck zuffa is paying you to do this shit so you can suck their money too? get a real fucking job. the money that zuffa is paying you is maybe more than poor ppl trying to have some entertainment u capitalist fucks. is that what u want? one day i will have to pay just to piss u fucking leeches but that won't happen cuz when that day comes the world will burst in civil war all because of you lowest of the lowest scum alive on earth. fucking leeches.
,klip1,2012-04-23T04:02Z,agreed on the download speed. shit speed. i was getting maybe 80kbps
,casadenada,2012-04-23T04:03Z,so confused .. .. is this by Sir.Paul or scene4all?   or are they one in the same?
,casadenada,2012-04-23T04:04Z,"why didn't someone ""spoil"" wiht the .rar pswd? 

of course i knew who'd win ... i still want to see ... 
"
,trigah,2012-04-23T04:45Z,Great!!!! Thanks for uploading!!!! I'll rate the V and A later.
,trigah,2012-04-23T04:53Z,i'm having a problem downloading it though... it's so slow... SEED PLEASE...............
,Jackylz,2012-04-23T08:47Z,"Idiot trolls, no .rar and no password. Its just one .AVI and one read me as always."
,falena1122,2012-04-23T09:57Z,just downloaded. thanks scene4all. no rar file of course.
,arubinhansamu,2012-04-23T10:53Z,"what is the password,,say complete the survey but no password after finishing the fucking survey,,"
,Os7,2012-04-23T23:34Z,"listen everyone.
like the guy above said, there is something fishy going on with this torrent.

i am not even in america and my mate downloaded this and it did in fact have a password.
but, i do not doubt some other people have downloaded this and got an avi.

i dont understand how this can happen but that does seem like that case.
but i do know the version we got had a password and we had to get it elsewhere.

and i also only created an account the day we did that to comment and as soon as i looked at the comments some cunts [they were probably zuffa employees] had posted the results to the main event.
not sure where those comments went, deleted id say."
,JRaiden,2012-04-23T23:55Z,"LOL ZUFFA

Now I will happily download all UFC 'til the end of time. Or until I'm bored with it, which pretty much already happened."
,guanakito100,2012-04-25T04:38Z,thanks for the upload had trouble with audio but it but worked when I hard decode it. thank you again
,guanakito100,2012-04-25T04:43Z,thanks for the upload had trouble with audio but it  worked when I hard decode it. thank you again. DON'T LISTEN TO THOSE THAT SAY YOU NEED A PASSWORD >>_>_

,MoviesR101,2012-05-15T17:52Z,"Thanks For The Up Scene4all!

@ Eddiehjjjfcfjfc - That was Funny! I could not have said it better myself! You are absolutely right, those Idots are waisting their times posting fake comments and yes TPB is helping to create new jobs!"
