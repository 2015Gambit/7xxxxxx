Labiaplasty or labioplasty is a surgery to reduce your vaginal lips. I had it a few years ago and am pretty happy. My lips were getting in the way. They hurt. Now they are fine. 

Here are some images of Before and After and a video of the process for women who might be thinking about it. This was not available when I had mine. 

There are good and bad labiaplasty surgeons. Make sure you get a good one. Good luck!
