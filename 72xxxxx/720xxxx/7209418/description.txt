The recording of this concert seems to have been one of the unofficial
bootleg releases originally, however I couldn't find a proof for it -
except for the slight scratches you can clearly hear. I am really glad I
have at least a tape copy of it, because it's one of the better concerts
they gave. The four parts comprising this recording are one to one copies
from two C60 tapes, played back without noise reduction and "ripped" as-is.
Thus you may feel the need to post process the sound in one way or another,
but that's up to you.

With the exception of the first track, which is cut off at about two thirds
of "At Night", all other tracks are overlapping in one or two seconds, so
you can glue them together for a complete concert impression. Besides: this
version of "Forever" isn't only one of the longest, but definitely one of
the best ever!
