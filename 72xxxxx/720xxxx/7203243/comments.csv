[V],psspss,2012-04-22T01:45Z,"im not tranny dude:) not a queen haha

i use umile mostly.. if theres syncing problems
i manual edit it using virtualdub or avidemux.org
or i use them to fix headers or edit out ads
or sharpen or color it etc

i sometimes use avs converter 8 for dvd rips
and joining flash together

plus a few other tools for odd ball things

mp4modifier is good to fix display aspect if its wrong
without re-coding stuff"
