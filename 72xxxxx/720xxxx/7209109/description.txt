Note: thanks to lum for the cam proper
jus changed the saturation, contrast,
resized, smart smoother once i finished
the video got straight on to syncing the
audio pretty sure it doesnt fall out but
you tell me , this does look better in the
dark scenes the people are actually visable
still lol i did a comparsion to show you the
diffrence plus no jumpy framerate nd less croped
at the top but abit more at the sides nd bottom
