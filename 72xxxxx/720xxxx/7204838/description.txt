Coast to Coast AM 2012.03.02 A Skeptic's Perspective, Open Lines

Host: 	George Noory
Guests: Guy Harrison, Open Lines

In the first half, George Noory welcomed author and skeptic Guy Harrison, who shared his take on a wide variety of paranormal phenomena and conspiracy theories. "I've probably got the heart of a believer, but the mind of a skeptic," he said about his stance on the unexplained. To that end, Harrison expressed hope that things like extraterrestrials and life after death turn out to be true, but stressed that, until proof emerges, he remains unconvinced of their reality. While advocating an open mind rather than hardened disbelief, Harrison explained why he is doubtful about the veracity of phenomena such as alien abductions, reincarnation, and ESP.

Regarding Bigfoot, for example, Harrison contended that it is "very unlikely" the creature exists, since it would require a sizable population to perpetuate the species and, in turn, the large number of hunters and hikers in America should have stumbled upon one of them by now. On conspiracy theories, he suggested that they are a cognitive version of pareidolia, where one sees patterns that don't exist, often in the hopes of making sense of inconceivable events. "Just because something may not have a rock solid explanation that satisfies you," he mused, "that, in itself, is not proof of something grand and bizarre going on behind the scenes." Harrison also detailed how studies into eyewitness testimony as well as memory show that they are both highly fallible and, thus, do not constitute strong proof for paranormal events.
