Stay-at-home mom Inari Vachs isn't so sure she approves of her daughter getting involved in a serious relationship in her first semester at university, but Alyssa convinces her mom to invite the young business student home for dinner. When Inari and her boyfriend, Nick, sit down with Alyssa and her boyfriend, Joey, a strained tension keeps Inari and Joey on edge. Did he make a poor impression on his girlfriendΓÇÖs mother, or is she disturbed by a deeper longing. Despite a strong caution from Nick, and the flighty advice of her promiscuous friend Nica, Inari dares to let herself be taken by the young stud.
