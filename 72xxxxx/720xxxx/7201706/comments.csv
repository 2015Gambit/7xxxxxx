,Just486,2012-05-01T00:14Z,"I had a release named similar as this one, which was containing a malware (causing the CPU to run at 100% and played random stuff on speakers). As the source of the virus was embedded into the installer, this time I only downloaded  the .reg file, and used it with the retail installer. Its seems to be OK so far, so I want to say thanks
THAAaaNKS.
(I hope the malware release was just a fake one and it wasn't by you, Ching Liu)"
,quible,2012-05-15T18:39Z,@Just486 did you manage to get rid of the virus? I know its a pain to do cos it's different to the usual stdrt.exe bug. get back to me if you need more help. I'll see if I can remember how I did it.
,Shamankra,2012-05-21T18:16Z,hello please I have the same problem with my fl studio you tell me how to fix this problem? I can not work in any song
,HollyFang5784,2012-06-08T16:11Z,"@xjh420 Epic Hail
@Ching_Liu THX!! So much appreciate :P"
,krille470,2012-06-18T20:38Z,never trust chinese
,CrazyAaron84,2012-06-21T19:12Z,just download the 10.0.9c demo from image line's official site and just download the .reg file from this torrent and enjoy! :P
,DHSDunner,2012-06-25T20:05Z,Where exactly shall I copy the .reg file if I've got FL already installed?
,PirateEm,2012-07-11T20:11Z,"Judging by the comments, I passed on using the installer just in case. 

10.0.9c is still on the website for download. Grab that and just back it up somewhere if you plan on holding on to it or putting elsewhere.

I started downloading this. Super fast download, but I cancelled early on. Used the registry file, deleted the rest.

Worked fine. Thanks"
,Xhow8,2012-09-01T01:38Z,it's a demo D:
,KaworuIIDX,2012-09-03T07:03Z,"Read people

(from NFO)

1. Close internet connection
2. Install application (with admin rights)
3. Double click on registry key.
4. Use firewall to stop internet connection of the application. "
,TastyTeo,2012-09-15T00:49Z,"Works Perfectly!
1. Install FL Studio running the setup
2. When Install is 100% don't run FL Studio (if you run it's demo, just close it)
3. Open the .reg file and write the serial to the registry
4. Open FL Studio and it should be Producer Edition"
,Ohyah123,2012-09-15T04:53Z,while it does work it does not have all of the (FPC) DLC so if your serious about it will not get you very far because while it does have some drum packs the better ones are in the (FPC)
