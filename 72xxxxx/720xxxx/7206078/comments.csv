,bitchybutcher,2012-04-22T15:17Z,"Fantastic! Everybody please seed the shit out of this. 
@griid; the subs are most likely in the mkv file already ;)"

,mjl_79,2012-04-26T08:31Z,Where we can get the subtitles... It is hard to see the movie with not understanding of what they are saying...
,stalker277,2012-05-10T18:34Z,"Subtitles posted by phatwarez, alt links:
goo then dot and then gl slash n4ebQ

,vivatpb5776,2012-08-18T23:51Z,"For all that care, this is what I get when I clicked on the subtitle link, ""

The requested file could not be found.

This can happen for one of the following reasons:

    The link is incorrect
    Make sure the spelling is correct and that the link ends with the file's extension (.zip or .mkv for example).
    The file you requested has been deleted
    Files get deleted after 30 days of inactivity unless they're uploaded by a premium member. Files can also be deleted by the uploader.""

More than likely, this file was deleted because of inactivity. I will download the .torrent and see what is within the .mkv container."
,vivatpb5776,2012-08-20T00:10Z,"There are no subtitles within the .mkv container. Unless you understand the native language, it is pointless to download this .torrent.

There is only one other 1080p version available on piratebay.

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7421230/Warriors_of_the_Rainbow_S.B_%282011%29_1080p_AC3_DTS_HQ_Multi_Subs

As the title states, this .torrent has multiple subs. I am using MKVMerge to remove the unwanted subtitles and will comment within that .torrent on audio and video quality."
