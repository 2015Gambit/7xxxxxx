[V],joshua13,2012-04-21T14:43Z,LOL!  Good luck selling your books. Don't hold your breath for that Nobel Prize in physics though. Extra credit for a ridiculously large slow loading flash animation. Flashy graphics are THE sign of true scholarship

,Occular,2012-04-22T16:41Z,"Angular momentum already has a limiting component, its called speed.  Another major problem is a limit of 2-directionality.  Force charges such as up, down, bottom, top and strangeness, along with baryon and meson number each drag (in an elastic sense) the system in a given dimensionally unique direction.  Using a 3x3 matrix to establish a more dynamic system graphically is admirable, however I think you might benefit from reading a text on abstract algebra, notably matrix algebras.  Also some reading on particle physics may help, notably the angles in most beta decay [forming right angles (multiples of 90) and not 60 which would make up an equilateral triangle.]  It is also strange that electricity is in its own subject, as opposed to electromagnetism, and that gravity is not quantized.  The most predominant issue to me is its incompatibility with string theory, super-string theory, or m-theory, as well as an overexerted assumption of all the current standings in the standard model of physics being correct simply because they are currently approved in society at this time.   

Also there is no God, certainly not in science.  The concept of God is about belief and assumption, whereas science is much the opposite, seeking knowledge through experiment; the two cannot coexist.

The torrent is clean though. No viruses, it is just the picture listed in the thumbnail."
,Tetryonics,2012-04-22T20:35Z,"Great comments..I suggest you stay tuned for QED and Q-Chemistry.  In fact it is 30 degree angles that are dominate throughout Tetryonic theory (on obvious but natural oversight). 

This image is only here to serve as a re-direct to my website or the FLVs on Tetryonics that I have uploaded. 

The reason on overemphasis on the Standard Model is observed is that is where the FACTS of Tetryonic theory led (not Mathematical suppositions as is the case in String etc), however there still remain some marked departures and corrections to the Standard Model as well.

Re: Religion and Science, after you get you head around what is contained in Tetryonics (and how it explains QED, Chemistry and Quantum Gravity [yet to be released]) from a single premise I am confident you will begin the see the 5,00 year old clues left for us by GOD on your own.

Electricity, spectral lines etc. are obviously going to be covered in detail in QED, periodic and allotropic elements (along with 3D models of each element) in the 3rd book, and the quantisation of Gravity in my fourth book [but baby steps first]

Again, all I have done here is follow the facts from the single foundational premise of Equilateral geometry of ENERGY, the detailed furthering of the maths involved, and stemming from this theory, I will leave up to Mathematicians as they get their heads around equilateral vs. spherical geometries [there is a lot more ahead of us].

And as you get accustomed to viewing mass-ENERGY-Matter you will no doubt find yourself seeing solutions to many intractable scientific problems that currently pepper scientific theory as I have (perhaps even more)

Happy to correspond in detail on any issues you need clarified."
