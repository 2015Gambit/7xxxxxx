MP3 128K

Quality is horrible. 512x384 !!!! Guys, we are in 2012 not in 2002 !!!!!!!

512x384 was the resolution at what I encoded movies at that time. In 2012 encode at DVD resolution so 720x512 PAL or 720x480 NTSC.

The video is a bit blocky at times, in other words not enough bitrate, of course considering the very low resolution, video is fuzzy.

Can't you learn how to encode? Ask in forums how to do it. It is incredible in 2012 we still see people encoding at 512x... And the most astonishing is when you state that this show is for you one of the best. Didn't it deserve to be treated as such? A great show, completely massacred by a poor encoding.

Same for MP3. At least encode Ă  192K or 320K or even put the AC3 stream in the avi. But please, 128K in a 2012 rip."
