,bobbydevis,2012-04-23T19:08Z,Just a heads up voice actors have all changed and its quite jarring if you have watched the other fairy tail torrent.
,catatonicloki,2012-04-25T00:41Z,"I'm pretty sure this torrent is the lame fan dub and not Funimation's official dub, thats why its so different. Thats why it says in the description ""Fairy TAil Episodes 49-70 english Dub By Animax"" bobbydevis. The dubs pretty bad, so bad its a little funny, I suggest waiting for the official dub."
,musclestud1,2012-04-28T22:10Z,"Dub is bad (fuzzy but in sync).  I don't care.  I can't wait for the slow funimation peeps to dub.  Thank you!  You ""da man"" ""4 life""!"
,IKKI1258,2012-05-05T12:16Z,Nice going!
,trainheartnet444,2012-05-17T14:00Z,"Why are you guys crying over something that is free thx daman this torrent is great.

just to let you dipshits know that there is only 48 dubbed episodes by funimation and the rest are japanese subs.

so I very grateful to get these even if they are fan dubbed"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-18T23:21Z,"Not fan Dub, is an English Asia Dub by Animax "
,kouzsam,2012-06-14T01:18Z,"hi , i have been downloading your torrents for a while and seeding as much as i can , thanks alot , hope you have more fairy tail eng dub soon"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-17T04:22Z,as soon as Funimation releases there 5th Blu ray Disk ill upload it.
,MJ_G23,2012-08-19T14:25Z,daman im waiting for ep71+ when r u going to upload it ???
,MJ_G23,2012-08-19T14:33Z,daman r u still going to upload 71+ dubbed by animax?
,nisse_DK,2012-08-27T09:11Z,thanks for the upload Daman4Iife its great and all but i think you made a mistake putting episode 62 in the torrent as both 62 and 63 or is it just me ?
,nisse_DK,2012-08-27T09:19Z,and becourse of that there is no episode 63
