CallClerk v4.3
CallClerk is an application that allows you to manager your incoming calls using yor PC and your existing telephone line.  But, CallClerk will run without a phone line modem (either internal or external) connected to your PC; however, in this case CallClerk will only be able to report incoming calls if it is linked through a network to another version of CallClerk running on a PC that does have a modem attached to it.
