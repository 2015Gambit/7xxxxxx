,PandaMD,2012-04-24T07:17Z,"Here's a tough one...

Please post if anyone know where to get the Chinese (Traditional Writing) subs for this file specifically.  I've looked on Shooter.cn

They only have ones where the two CDs are combined together.  I need Chinese subs that are made for this file specifically (2 CDs for Part 1)"
