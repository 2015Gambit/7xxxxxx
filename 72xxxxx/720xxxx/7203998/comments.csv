Create environment variable SPACECLAIM_LICENSE_FILE with a value 27581@yourhostname

Should I edit the Spaceclaim.lic in the installation folder or the SC.lic from the CD ?"

But that is not the real problem. Who has navigated through the Flexlm license (the files held in the sc2012.rar) and got it to work? How?"
,Nylock,2012-04-25T11:58Z,"It works. Instructions for getting this going are now on

1. install software ( but do not run the program )

2. make a folder called ""C:SpaceClaimFlexServer""

3. unrar the files sc2012.rar 

4. copy all the files from the sc2012.rar too C:SpaceClaimFlexServer

5. make a > new text file < rename it to "" lic.log "" and save it inside of the folder C:SpaceClaimFlexServer
CAUTION: When saving a blank *.txt as lic.log, do not delete the highlighted blue sugestion *.txt in the box. Instead
change txt to log and * to lic and it should read as lic.log and save it it to your C:SpaceClaimFlexServer folder

so you have 5 files called > lic.log , lmgrd.exe , lmtools.exe , sc.lic , SPACECLM.exe

6. Now you need to find your local host ip and you MUST be connected to the internet

a. click on on ""windows start button "" click on all programs ( from start menu )
find the folder called ""Accessories"" then click on the ""Command Prompt""
up comes the console type in "" ipconfig /all ""

you then need to find the line - IpV4 ..... Address you will see on the right a number eg 192.0.155.0 
yours will be different 

from mine , Make a note of that number.

7. click ""windows start button"" move you mouse to ""computer"" """"right click """"select"" Properties 

""Control PanelAll Control Panel ItemsSystem"" 

on the left you will see ""Advanced system settings"" click on ""advanced system setting"" 
another window pops up you will see at the bottom of that window ""Environment Variables"" > System Variable >> TCP >> when you get a Windows Secuirty Alert for lmgrd.exe and SPACECLM.exe <

for both of them you want have 

Private Networks ON 

and 

Public networks OFF

If you don't get the Security Alert, it is fine keep going.


9 go back too C:SpaceClaimFlexServer folder run lmtools.exe 

goto the tab ""Config Services"" 2nd from last tab 

in Service name box put ""SPACECLAIM_LICENSE_FILE"" in it 

Path to the Lamgd.exe file put ""C:SpaceClaimFlexServerlmgrd.exe""

Path to the License file put ""C:SpaceClaimFlexServersc.lic""

Path to the debug log file put ""C:SpaceClaimFlexServerlic.log""

click the box ""Use services"" 
click the box ""Start Server at Power Up""

go to the tab ""Start/Stop/Reread"" 

press ""start Server"" button.



10 run ""SpaceClaim 2012"" 


should take you round 5 mins todo it all 

remember this all for windows 7 64bit
