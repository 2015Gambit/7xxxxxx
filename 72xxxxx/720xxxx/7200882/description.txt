Chicane - Thousand Mile Stare 2012-QMI

2012 release from the British Electronic artist. In the past, he has been dubbed 
the ΓÇ£godfather of the Ibiza anthem,ΓÇ¥ but Chicane mastermind, Nick Bracegirdle, 
has come a long way since the sun drenched Balearic shores first throbbed to the 
archetypal chill out classic, ΓÇÿOffshoreΓÇÖ. The expression, ΓÇÿhot off the pressΓÇÖ 
does not apply when talking about the timing of ChicaneΓÇÖs albums; the last 12 
months has been spent crafting, caressing and encouraging the tracks into shape. 
The albumΓÇÖs emotive power is sublime, and as Nick sums it up, ΓÇ£a collection of 
lifeΓÇÖs soundtracks.ΓÇ¥
