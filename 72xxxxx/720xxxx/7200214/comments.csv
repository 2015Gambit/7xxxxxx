For my contribution, aside from my usual 3x upload ratio, I would like to mention that there are good subtitles available at Addic7ed.com, which have the added benefit of providing the correct title for each episode. The subtitles come with the hearing impaired text, easily removed with Transcript Annotations Cleaner (TAC) by Kerensky (free)."
