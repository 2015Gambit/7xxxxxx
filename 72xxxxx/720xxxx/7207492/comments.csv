,Bubbers83,2012-04-23T03:34Z,"Mooba, when the comics come out they are posted the day of or the next day after release, just type in the title and issue number in the search bar and you'll find the posting. Please stop cluttering up the comics section with reposts."
[T],mdusanjay,2012-04-23T03:35Z,hum i am really bad with piratebay search :(
,Silvak,2012-04-23T03:52Z,"Yep, pointed out the exact same thing when he uploaded ASM 684.  Getting annoying."
[T],mdusanjay,2012-04-23T04:10Z,hum then i will stop uploading in comic section..bye
,kingkirby,2012-04-23T05:06Z,please don't stop posting comics..you are the only one who posted the last two issues of new mutants. I can live with the mistakes. You are not the only one who post torrents that are already out there. Thanks for the efforts and time spent. To all out there..why discourage someone from posting stuff that we are all getting for free. I used to spend about 45 bucks a week for comics. Now there are some really nice people making them available for all of us. Lets try to be a little more grateful. I am sure mdusanjay did not repost comics just to annoy you guys. 
[T],mdusanjay,2012-04-23T10:03Z,i am not double  posting to annoy anyone man..but unfortunately i am new to TPB comic section and i have no idea about the previous release..i totally rely on the tpb search to prevent double posting..unless the previous authors have properly added the tags..they are not showing in the search..thus double posting..from today will depend upon google to check the content of tpb..let me c..untill then happy reading
