,w00tbie,2012-09-25T10:44Z,@A_Dying_Baby lol tru I gritted my teeth through a lot of this book. she had two modes: gentle and not pissed off or sarcastic and pissed off. oh yeah and haymitch (pissed bastard). this book and its characters deserved way better. I'd actually pay to hear it again by someone else.
