FasterDownloads is a DOWNLOAD ACCELERATOR that avoids Android's limitation when downloading files and gives you a much needed speed boost when you enable it's built-in Multithreaded Download! (Check the video for an example).
Note: Many file locker services with paid accounts block multithreaded downloadsFileSonic, Fileserve...). This is a limit set up by themselves and there is nothing I can do to get it working.
This app will register itself as a handler for most well known file types, allowing you to download them however you want, whenever you want. It is specially useful on phones using Touchwiz (the Samsung Galaxy line), since their browser has a mediocre download manager (Have you ever tried downloading an APK? It won't let you. Don't ask me why, I don't get it).
You can also send your links to a Mac or PC running JDownloader with its plugin "JD Remote Control" or see a complete list of the downloads in progress.
Note: If you want to download with a PremiumRapidshare oraccount, you only have to log in using the app's integrated browser. It will automatically use your cookie to enable premium downloads :)
