Description:
KILL BILL: THE WHOLE BLOODY AFFAIR was the same print that was shown in 2004 in Cannes complete with French subtitles and intermission intact.  The variations from the originals range from the subtle (alternate takes used) to the impactful (no revelation â&#x20AC;&#x153;The Bridesâ&#x20AC;? child had lived).  Most of the changes came during Volume 1 although there was a subtle change I noticed in Volume 2 where The Bride arrives in Acuna to talk with Estaban (More shots of the whores are shown)."
