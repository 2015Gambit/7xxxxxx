As I was watching the series after recompressing and got to S05E10 I noticed it somehow got cropped to 4:3. So I redownloaded the original scource mkv, took me a hole lot of doing to get a good recompression out of it. Clearly there is someting different/wrong with the scource. Anyway here is the corrected file.
