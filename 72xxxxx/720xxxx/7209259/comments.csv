,MrNapGeo,2012-04-27T04:57Z,"I'm on the same boat as ""amaketa"".
Downloaded, copied onto disc, and installed succesfully. Searched files its there but I just can't seem to find the actual program."
,Cr4kk3n,2012-04-27T05:35Z,"Might be easier for you to mount it using Daemon tools, it usually installs to  C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Office if I am not mistaking
(Or Program Files if you are on a 32 bit OS) and then I believe in another folder Office(Something, I'm  going off of memory) should be your executable files"
