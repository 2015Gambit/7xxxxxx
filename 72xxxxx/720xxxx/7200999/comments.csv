,lynfree,2012-04-20T16:40Z,can anyone tell me how to download to my reader? it always opens in abobe digital editions and i can't figure out how to do anything with it. thanks if you can help me.
,jrmcd49,2012-04-20T18:15Z,"Thanks for this. 

Any chance you have ""Gods of Gotham"" by Lydsay Faye?"
,TxJag,2012-04-20T19:00Z,"@lynfree uninstall Adobe Digital Editions, and open in iTunes. Best thing to do is change the file attributes in Windows. When the file finishes downloading open the folder say the folder will say Roberts_Nora then find the book file Witness, The or whatever it says. Right click and look for ""Open with..."" then look for iTunes as one of the options or if iTunes isn't one of the options select Choose Program and find iTunes and change it to default in the options menu."
