   This is the true story of the most highly decorated British patrol      
     since the Boer war: an eight man SAS team inserted behind Iraqi       
     lines during the Gulf War in January 1991. Their mission was to       
      take out the scud missiles which Saddam Hussein was using to         
   terrorize his enemies, as well as to sever strategic communication      
   lines between Baghdad and North West Iraq. This top secret mission      
    was called "Bravo Two Zero" and it was commanded by Sergeant Andy      
                                 McNab.
