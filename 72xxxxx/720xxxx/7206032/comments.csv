,burt007,2012-04-23T08:41Z,"Totally misleading, this book was originally uploaded by me. I have the original book in paper format, purchased in 1990, I am the one who scanned it and uploaded it years ago. This is not translated by sir Richard burton. The cover is wrong the description is wrong the whole time wasted by downloading this. Please correct or remove this."
