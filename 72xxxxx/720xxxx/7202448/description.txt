"Wrath"

When Nikita (Maggie Q) worked for 
Division, she targeted a man named 
Nicholas Brandt (guest star Rick 
Ravanello) and infiltrated his inner 
circle. She captured him and he's 
been behind bars ever since. However, 
Percy (Xander Berkeley) springs Brant, 
and his first mission is to capture 
Nikita for payback. After he has her 
in his clutches, he tortures her, 
forcing Nikita to face a side of 
herself she thought she had long 
buried. Meanwhile, Percy continues to 
play mind games with Michael (Shane 
West), Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca) and Sean 
(Dillon Casey), pushing one of them 
to the brink of death.
