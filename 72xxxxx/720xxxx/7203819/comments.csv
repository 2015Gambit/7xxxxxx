,muLineZu,2012-04-21T17:56Z,"Hey John (you better edit the MediaInfo file, if you don't wanna reveal your name...) could you please mention the source? I presume, as the blu-ray haven't been released yet, that it's HDTV Rip. Is it so? Thanks!"
,RooJo4342,2012-04-21T18:38Z,"Source:Bicentennial Man (1999)HDTV m720p 2.75gb TwIzZy

size:2.75gb

there you go, i have compared my encode and original and there is no noticable differance whatsoever  in quality and by the way, how did you know my name??"
,muLineZu,2012-04-21T19:11Z,"Relax! I'm not KGB or something... As I mentioned in my first comment if you don't wanna reveal your name, you should edit the MediaInfo file, which keeps in mind the current location of the video (in this case) file. So, look at the file info that you provided, and it's not so hard to see that the file is on user's John desktop: C:UsersJohnDesktopBicentenial Man 720p Eng 5.1 RooJo434 (1).mkv
Thanks for answering. Hope it will be released on blu-ray soon..."
