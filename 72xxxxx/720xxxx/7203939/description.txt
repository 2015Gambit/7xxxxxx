These are audio books collected in different places and sites over the last decade.
None are my rips.

Before the fall election, it is my intention to rip the other 16 or 17 Sowell audio books and post them in two more collections.

I have been collecting audio book sources cassette (for old books not digitized) as well as digital audio versions of the missing 17 books.


In this collection

A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles
Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One
Basic Economics - A Citizens Guide to the Economy
Black Rednecks and White Liberals
The Quest for Cosmic Justice
Economic Facts and Fallacies
The Economics and Politics of Race
Intellectuals and Society
The Housing Boom and Bust


thanks to the rippers of these great books.
