Demons invade the Carnival at Venice, horrible nightmare-reflections of beloved fairytales characters, determined to tear a permanent hole from their twisted world to ours. Demon Hunter Gabriel must force the demoness Cinderella, monster Little Mermaid, and countless others back through the portal before the last night of Carnival, or no one will live happily ever after.
