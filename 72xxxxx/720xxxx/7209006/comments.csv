[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-23T20:15Z,"Oh Wendie, the only way I might get better at that quiz show is if I were to watch each episode 3 times! Then I might have a chance of getting an answer right! When I asked a friend from Manchester what an ""ASBO"" was, the speed at which he replied lead me to think he was a very naughty child!!!"
