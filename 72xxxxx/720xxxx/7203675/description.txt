On a red eye flight to Boston from LA 10 people wake up to a shock. 
All the passengers and crew have vanished. When they try to contact 
the ground they make no connections. They land the plane only to 
discover that things haven't changed. But its like the world is dead. 
No one is there, the air is still, sound doesn't echo, the food is 
tasteless. And a distant sound is heard coming closer. A race of 
monstrous beings bent on their destruction is heading for them, 
eating everything in sight.
