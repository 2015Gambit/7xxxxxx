Alone in the Dark 4 - The New Nightmare (PSX)
--------------------------------------------


*TORRENT content:


- BIN/CUE image files (CD1 & CD2)

- PSX BIOS file (scph1001.bin)

- FPse for Android v0.10.62 (older version of the best PSX emulator for Android which doesn't need patches or root access)

- FPse for Android v0.11.18 (newer version of the emulator which needs root access and the LuckyPatcher)

- LuckyPatcher.1.2.6.by.ChelpuS



I had some trouble to find this game on the net... After some research I found it on a torrent with almost no seeders and in MDF/MDS image files, which are not compatible with PSX/PS1 emulators for Android. So I decided to convert them into BIN/CUE files using PowerISO and to seed the game with the apropriate BIOS and the best PSX emulator dor Android.

I've tested the game and the disc swapping (with FPse v0.10.62), everything seems to work just fine! Altough I haven't completed the game to see if there are any glitches...

ENJOY!!
