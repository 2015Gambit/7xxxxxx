,KenxirC,2012-04-21T21:22Z,"First and last torrent... unless people start uploading for real!
It's ridiculous what happens with torrents, everyone benefits but anyone wants to share!
I have lots of good old games in packs containing covers, manuals, walkthroughs and other relevant files to true collectors. As I hate the idea of ​​seeing these games disappear, I was thinking of uploading them too, but after this experience I don't think I'll do that anymore...
And the funniest thing is that people with the largest dowload rates share the least, or absolutely nothing..."

,KenxirC,2012-04-22T06:56Z,"Hey there!
The seeding of this torrent was really bad, but now it seems to be Ok... good =)

matg7, first you have to activate the option in your phone to allow the installation of unknown files.

After that, you need to copy to your SD card the emulator, the bios file and the CDs images (4 files, 2 CUE and 2 BIN for CD1 and CD2).

To avoid any complications, use FPse for Android v0.10.62, it's an older version but you won't need root access or the LuckyPatcher, so it's easier to use and the game works well with this version.

Use the file manager provided with your phone or download one from the market, find the files in your SD card and install the emulator. After that, run FPse and locate the bios file under settings, than you just need to locate the folder where you put the CDs images and choose a game to run!

Hope you understand my explanation!



Cerebral222,
Não emula analógicos, não conheço nenhum emulador de PSX para Android que faça isso... Mas dá pra usar perfeitamente, o FPse é o melhor que existe até o momento!"
