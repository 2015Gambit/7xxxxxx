[V],psspss,2012-04-23T14:04Z,"note there is some minor audio sync drift
about 25 to 30min in the video I couldnt
fix though.

its a 1.30hr long though .. pretty small file
for size but its 4:3 recording too.

was from sci-fi channel.. 

perhaps someone has  a new rip for 16:9 from
a dvd of it somewhere out there :)
and could share on here"

NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE MOVIES CALLED
OUT OF THE BLUE 

think theres 2 of them.. one is a NZ film and the
other to do with the sea?"

THE ORIGINAL RIPPER SOURCE OF THIS DOCU
must of had some fat32 corruption when he
hashed it and uploaded to the web as
you can see some video of terminator show
ad break through where the minor syncing happens

at least this copy can now scroll in vlc and not loose the sound now until a better DVD rip
source comes to light.. if ever"
