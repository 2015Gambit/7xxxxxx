- INFO:
Simon & Garfunkel is an American music duo consisting of singer-songwriter Paul Simon and singer Art Garfunkel. They formed the group Tom & Jerry in 1957 and had their first success with the minor hit "Hey, Schoolgirl". As Simon & Garfunkel, the duo rose to fame in 1965, largely on the strength of the hit single "The Sound of Silence". Their music was featured in the landmark film The Graduate (1967), propelling them further into the public consciousness.
They are well known for their vocal close harmonies and were among the most popular recording artists of the 1960s. Their biggest hits peaked at number one in several charts. They have received several Grammys and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.
Their sometimes rocky relationship led to their last album, Bridge Over Troubled Water, being delayed several times due to artistic disagreements and as a result the duo broke up in 1970. Simon & Garfunkel have, at times, reunited to perform and sometimes tour together, most famously for 1981's "The Concert in Central Park", which attracted more than 500,000 people.
