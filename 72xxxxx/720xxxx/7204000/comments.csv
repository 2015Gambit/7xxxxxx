,wzrsa,2012-04-21T18:53Z,"@VuDu4000 fuck off man, do you see any other torrents for this one yet? You post it or stfu and respect the people who start torrents for things you want. Honestly we live in 2012 where has our respect gone?"
,novsan,2012-04-21T18:55Z,Thank you footy
,mutineer,2012-04-21T19:03Z,"Geez, what an A-Hole VuDu4000 is..
Patience child, first up is always smaller file size.

Anyway, thanks again Footy, ignore the morons.
Lots out here just being grateful.
Cheers"
[T],V100,2012-04-21T19:24Z,Thank you.
,resonator,2012-04-21T19:27Z,"@VuDu4000, you a a first class idiot, why don't you upload a better copy yourself then ?"
,MissAlice,2012-04-21T19:40Z,"VuDu4000 should be banned from downloading F1 on PB. Let him get he's free HD from somewhere else, OMG the arrogance thinks he should get it free and also the best quality. Must be on drugs, rich parents, best internet speed, FHD TV you know the type I got this I got that. Or works for Star sports. Bet they, are really mad. Thanks footy mate for uploading so quick please do all the calender, if you can. So glad I can make comments on here now. It's been blocked till recently."
,MxLuvr,2012-04-21T20:45Z,"vudu4000 is clearly a 14 year old that thinks he's too cool for his own good. Uploader please ignore the demands of the obnoxious little pricks.

Most of us don't want to waste 2 days to d/l a 5 gig file. If some non F1 race fan needs that kind of resolution, let him ask his parents to pay for cable or satellite. Keeping the files around the 1gb mark means true race fans get to watch the qualifying the same day, not the day after the race.

Some kids..."

You prick, you have the ignorance to come and say this while you only do the fucking whining. The difference is, you watch F1 because you're too dim witted to understand any of it, you just look at the fast moving slicks and think wow, it's better than in the video game in which you spend your life away - course you want it to be HD. But for people who actually care about the sport, it is far more important to hear what all time legends of racing have to say like Herbert, Hill or Brundle and how they help us get to the very bottom of it, because in 4 hours or so, they understand the essence of Formula 1 racing a million times faster than most of us. We don't watch F1, we live and observe it. The side of life you will never get. Probably you will bitch back about my post and say that we're all accepting with obsolete formats cause we live in Africa (which, again, is something you don't know anything about) but you know what? I don't really care. I stopped caring about people like you a long time ago, just not worth it. So fuck you and your HD, why don't you just roll it and stick it up yours... or you know, pull it over your head like a condom. 

@footy
I raise my hat and salute you! Thanks a million for doing this, I hope you get enough appreciation and gratitude for your contributions. 
By the way, a small suggestion of mine would be that if you could stick to Skysports throughout the season, it would be awesome. I don't care if it's camcorder quality but I think a lot of people are with me on this one, it's a bit annoying to switch between broadcasts, I think the majority thinks that Sky is on a better vibe than BBC right now, they've really nailed it for this year. Of course BBC is a lot of fun but they lack in coverage quality, it seems to be humor only in their case. So if it's not a difference for you, I would suggest sticking to Skysports. But that's not whining, I, as many others, are only grateful to you. Thanks again."
,jb4thewin,2012-04-21T21:12Z,"Sorry for the double post, I just downloaded it in 18 minutes or so. I think we should applaude to footy or something, this is just great. I would kisssss yoouuuur aasss (and I'd like it)!"
,mysticsquee,2012-04-21T23:52Z,cheers footy. 
,SerSpec-V,2012-04-21T23:54Z,@VoDo4000: I have unlimited high speed internet but I still don't feel the need to DL everything in HD. Grow up you child and keep your mindless opinions to yourself. 
,qraak,2012-04-22T01:50Z,Thanks footy. I'm sure that you know that we all (except for an irrelevant dipshit) appreciate your efforts.
,manga19882006,2012-04-22T02:15Z,cheers footy great job but no intro?
,Abawcom,2012-04-22T03:37Z,"Thanks for the Upload brother, but two quick things.  1. Why no Intro show on the SD version?
2. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE upload the Sky Sports coverage of the race. F1 with no Martin Brundle is lame!. Thanks again!!!"
,digimike50,2012-04-22T04:33Z,"Thanks very much, footy. I just can't believe some of the negative comments, here. SOME of us (living overseas) don't have ANY choice about download speeds - want to pay or not. The internet service in Thailand is extremely poor and it has taken me ages to get a 500k (wireless) link in our apartment building! (from the telephone to USB adapter before, giving 150k at best). Yes, it's wonderful to watch it in HD, but that will take a week or more! Besides, REAL F1 fans will watch anything that they can get their hands on (as quickly as possible)! Keep up the great work, footy, and regards to all real F1 fans out there!"
[T],smokkedog,2012-04-22T07:24Z,"For those of you who like to complain about bad quality video, just read the description and move on!
If you want HD then you will have to wait. The smaller and lesser quality videos are for those of us who don't want to wait. If you just waited a little while you could see for yourself there are some out there. 
You see? you just got yelled at by everybody for running your mouth. :)"
,EdoSensei,2012-04-22T09:45Z,"VuDu4000 = COCK!

And a punch in the face to the above idiot from everyone else here.


Thanks Footy."
,nyran125tk,2012-04-22T10:29Z,"@VuDu4000 Hey fckwit, theres people that dont have unlimited downloading with high speed broadband still in this day and age. OK? So FCK OFF!!!!

Some people have caps of like 20Gb's or 60Gb's and thats all they can use in an entire month, ok? what about them? "
,angh_rock,2012-04-22T16:35Z,footy...thank u man...thanks a ton
,TurnonLoud,2012-04-22T17:14Z,Thanks you are the best
,Padsta6,2012-04-22T18:02Z,"do we have an eta on when the race will be available?

,farhan_raja,2012-04-23T09:16Z,"Thanks again for the awesome job footy. one thing though, will there be a separate torrent for the Pre-quali intro? "
