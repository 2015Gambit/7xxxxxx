The Eagle's View (Sight)

Nature Documentary hosted by Jeff Corwin, published by Discovery Channel broadcasted as part of DC Corwin's Quest series in 2005 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

In this episode of Corwin's Quest, Jeff explores how animals use sight to avoid predators, pinpoint prey and navigate their surroundings. His main quest is to locate a golden eagle in the wilds of Scotland and put its pre-eminent eyesight to the test. Does this avian predator really have the sharpest eyes of any bird?

Along the way Jeff encounters various critters, including a spitting cobra that nearly turns the lights out for our intrepid host.

But that's not all. In a series of side quests, Jeff gazes deeply into the giant eyes of a giraffe, demonstrates how rattlesnakes see in complete darkness and meets a swivel-eyed Jackson's chameleon.
