QM 17 - mass-ENEGY-Matter

The geometric relationships between mass-ENERGY and Matter as developed in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

A clear, concise definition of mass and Matter is revealed.

Providing quantifiable definitions of 2D geometry of mass-ENERGY against the 3D geometry of Matter, a scientific understanding of mass-energyΓÇÖs role in Matter is established for the first time in recorded history.

The seventeenth chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric distinction between mass & Matter in  the Science of the new millennia.
