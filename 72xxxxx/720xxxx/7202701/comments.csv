,saint84,2012-04-21T09:33Z,so what's the story?
,SiL3N0Z,2012-04-21T10:35Z,"Researchers in Antarctica are abducted by a team of masked storm troopers. They are dragged deep underground to a hidden continent in the center of the earth. Here Nazi survivors, their bodies a horrifying patchwork of decaying and regenerated flesh, are planning for the revival of the Third Reich."
,Tech-Noir,2012-04-21T12:00Z,"Asylum production, filmed late 2011, looks like someone was inspired by Iron Sky and wanted something with the same theme, but Nazis below earth rather than on the moon. Asylum generally produce knock-offs of ""real"" movies, with generally poor to laughable results."
,sgleder,2012-04-21T12:24Z,"@BOZX

,morlok,2012-04-22T21:05Z,"I know it's too early, but ... Do any of you have subtitles for this release?. In English or Spanish, so I can do the translation and upload it."
,Lepryy,2012-04-22T21:32Z,This movie was such a fucking joke. could have been much better. I couldn't take the HORRIBLE animation anymore and quit halfway through. Guys... they use NERF GUNS for the Nazi guns and cheap ass pew pew sounds... fuckin ridiculous 
,lassik2,2012-04-23T00:54Z,"@Lepryy Seriously? You expected more from a movie titled ""Nazis at the Center of the Earth""? You're expectations were actually higher??"
,SergioFCPorto,2012-04-24T04:19Z,thanks
,lucius79,2012-04-24T08:16Z,Yeah this movie soo laughable - anyone got IRON SKY?
,meskiman,2012-04-24T11:45Z,This was a really bad movie.
,stevogaleb,2012-04-25T00:30Z,It baffles me as to why people would waste their bandwidth on something like this.
,solidsam22,2012-04-25T15:49Z,Don't confuse this with the Nazis from the dark side of the Moon flick. This here is some lame-ass low budget crap :)
,aiigghht,2012-04-27T06:52Z,"@stevogaleb. unlimited bandwith here.
