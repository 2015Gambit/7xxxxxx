  keep  up  the  good  work "
[V],psspss,2012-04-27T09:55Z,"havent watched it yet so cant confirm


i did random check it.. all seemed ok in the hops

i did (using VLC 2.0.1 though which does use codecs)"
,x86,2012-04-27T12:00Z,"It  turned out  the  older k-lite  codecs  i was using was  to blame so i updated and it runs smooth , i also tried with latest vlc  and it works ok now.


Have a nice day"

I see what ive done wrong .. I didnt upload
the right one with the proper audio

TO FIX SYNC just +300ms should do the
trick in VLC tracker option

else use avidemux.org and load it and tick
time shift on side under audio
and enter 300 then go file pulldown and
say save avi with new name

shoyld take 1min to make a new fix avi without
re-encoding"
