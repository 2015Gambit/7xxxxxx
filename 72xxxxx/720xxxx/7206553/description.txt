Kon-Boot is a bootable piece of software which hooks the DLL of a booting operating system and bypasses the password authentication in Linux and Windows.

The developer of this software decided to sell-out and pass the rights on to a corporate entity who, you guessed it, decided to make a buck off of it.

$15 wasn't enough to deter me from sharing this, though.


From http://piotrbania.com/all/kon-boot/ :

"Kon-Boot is an application which will silently bypass the authentication process of Windows based operating systems.Without overwriting your old password! Easy to use and excellent for tech repairs, data recovery and security audits.

"Commercial Kon-Boot version works with both 64-bit and 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems and also include privilege escalation feature.

"Free Kon-Boot version is still available but it does not support 64 bit systems and Windows 7. It also does not include privilege escalation feature."
