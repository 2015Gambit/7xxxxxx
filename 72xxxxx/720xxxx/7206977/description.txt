Mac OSX Lion Users PLEASE READ:

How do I get IGT Slots Texas Tea to work on Mac OS 10.7 (Lion)?

We will have patches for this problem, but in the meantime here is a workaround for the problem with Lion not running Masque IGT slots games:

On Mac OS X 10.7 Lion the Library folder is hidden. The easiest way to go to that folder is by clicking the Finder icon in the dock, pressing CMD+SHIFT+G and then typing this into the box that appears:
/Library/Application Support

Once you have that folder open, create a folder inside called Masque.

That is all that is necessary. The game will work then.
