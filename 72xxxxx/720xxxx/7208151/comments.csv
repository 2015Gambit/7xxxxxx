,micron66,2012-04-23T05:45Z,"all you people asking whether this is real or fake,check the sites that release info about files released by scene groups,if they are listed there,then it means it's real - 

http://www.orlydb.com/s/tv-x264

http://www.orlydb.com/s/tv-xvid

and yes,this release is REAL as it is listed in the above site."
,NonyxGel,2012-04-23T05:46Z,"Do you people not see the GREEN SKULL after DibyaTPB's name?

No need to question whether the torrent is ""real"" or not when you see The Pirate Bay's green skull.

And for those who still don't get it... YES, ITS REAL!"
,fragomatic,2012-04-23T05:49Z,"THIS IS A REAL TORRENT.

I downloaded 5% of it and tested with VLC media player, I saw some medieval stuff so this is a real torrent."
,LackThereof,2012-04-23T08:38Z,Skip in the audio/video right in the middle of the Qarth scene.  Re-verified the file twice.
,VampireMuffinMan,2012-04-23T08:51Z,"I had the out of sync audio as well, so will be looking for a diff. file but the short sync problem didn't make it at all unwatchable, though.  Great quality otherwise."
