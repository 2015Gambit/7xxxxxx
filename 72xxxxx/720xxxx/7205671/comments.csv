,HermanHermes,2012-04-22T09:16Z,"This comment is addressed to all spoilers here.

You are fucking stupid. Whats the point of telling the results to people. Nobody cares what you have to say about the match. People are here to download. People read the comment section mainly to know if the quality of video is good and if its complete. But you just SPOIL! Stop destroying other peoples surprises."

,erantal52,2012-04-22T09:17Z,"You are all a bunch of assholes!!! nobody asked to know the score and how it finished!! next time write a comment for how the movie ends and then go and kick some small underprivileged children and run over an old lady.
You've disgusted me!!"
,cheesehammer,2012-04-22T09:17Z,FYI Shit torrent go somewhere else.  Thanks also to the assholes who posted the results in the comment section.
,erantal52,2012-04-22T09:20Z,"wetpussy4u2lick-
I guess you really didn't want anybody to enjoy this since you posted the result 3 time!
Fuck you man!!"

go kill yourself you worthless piece of scum."
,DirtyMicky,2012-04-22T09:37Z,"wetpussy4u2lick: re spoilers, You are an absolute nugget, seriously your old man should have blown you across the sheets, you have to post your shit 4 times which is probably the amount of times I'd skullfuck you for your ignorance dumbass.  "
,LeonDawson11,2012-04-22T09:37Z,SPOILERS NEED TO GO KILL THEMSELVES.
,LeonDawson11,2012-04-22T09:37Z,"SPOILERS NEED TO GO KILL THEMSELVES. 

Pirate Bay need moderator's to ban anyone who's stupid enough to post spoiler comments!"
,Ruben6277,2012-04-22T09:38Z,anyone got the password?

,MNat04,2012-04-22T09:39Z,"Man, I already watched this earlier at a friends house, but want to add it to my collection. If I didn't already know the results, I would NEVER read the comments. You'll soon know better too. Just look for a trustworthy source and you're good. I like how the one person keeps posting spoiler comments. It's actually rly sad, bc it's the same username 4 times. Not only does he sit around waiting for this moment, but he's not even an MMA fan. Three 5 minute rounds in a championship fight? Not so much. It hurts to see someone so neglected as a child that they have to try to get any attention, any place possible. And also attempt to make others feel as empty inside as them. I can't empathize tho, bc my life is fuckin awesome lol.

Anyway, remember guys, for future notice, beware of spoilers if you don't already know the results!"
,MNat04,2012-04-22T09:42Z,"Also, anyone responding angrily to the spoiler is exactly why he does it. Don't feed the troll."
,jetli2020,2012-04-22T09:42Z,what is the password
,DirtyMicky,2012-04-22T09:43Z,@wetpussy4u2lick I hope you choke and die on your dads jizz tonight when you sucking him off u cum junkie. 
,Ruben6277,2012-04-22T09:46Z,I did the survey and i got this pass: ufc_145_3545351344t53 can't get it to work tho
,jimijimijimi,2012-04-22T09:50Z,"Congratulations to the dumbasses who spoiled the results. Are you lives that pathetic and meaningless?

@wetpussy4u2lick - that's exactly what you are - a wet fucking pussy. Fucking cock smoker."
,jimijimijimi,2012-04-22T09:52Z,password needed? for real? Fuck this - deleted and getting a different torrent...

,pilot234,2012-04-22T11:10Z,Thanks Rush. All these other assholes who're calling it fake and saying there's a password detract us from downloading. Appreciate your advice.

thank you"
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2012-04-22T12:46Z,"Will it play on Xbox 360? I'm guessing not. :( This move away from xvid and to x264 has been a real bummer for me. Still haven't got to see episode 5 of TUF because of it. Yeah, I realize it's a better codec than xvid but most of the time these x264 files aren't configured to work with Xbox 360. And I'm guessing it wouldn't be hard to do. Just change a choice or two when doing the rip. Watching with VLC on my laptop isn't an option because this thing gets hot after around 10 minutes of playing video and gets so choppy that it isn't watchable. Am downloading hoping this may be one of the rare instances of these types of files that will play on 360. But I'm not optimistic."
,bondjing,2012-04-22T13:22Z,WARNING: Super slow download. Every UFC 145 torrent at TPB is downloading at turtle like speed.

,ZOMGTiger,2012-04-22T21:59Z,"Video Quality: 9
Audio Quality: 6

Audio constantly has robotic skipping noises.

BTW, if you don't want the results spoiled, don't read the comments because some troll ALWAYS posts who the winners are."

,You_Muppet,2012-04-24T12:23Z,"Thanks Dibya, nice torrent.

God knows what the 'password' comments were about, my file opened no probs.

Must echo all the other comments on evading spoilers ... pick a trusted UFC uploader (Dibya or Scene4all) and download without reading. "
,p00-ping,2012-04-26T13:04Z,"Thanks Sir.Paul for all your effort with UFC rips although 100% of my UFC downloads from you have resulted in the speed of the video not being smooth, it very briefly speeds up every 5 seconds or so.

 My media palyer is an AMD Asrock ION factory built running XBMC openELEC.
