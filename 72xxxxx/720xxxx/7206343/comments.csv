[T],Biomechanical,2012-04-23T21:37Z,"No new security, i think! What program do you use to download the torrents??"
,dragonbandit314,2012-04-24T07:52Z,"Yet again, an awesome collection. How about those socks??? Thank you. I DO appreciate your efforts.
@Beeda2004, I think you may be having a problem with the magnet link. If your torrent client does not support it you will have problems. I am NOT an expert, in any way, but I find I have no problems. I use Vuze and I am on version 4.7.0.2. Java also needs to be up to date. I hope this helps as TPB seems to be moving to Magnet link only. Cheers and be well."
