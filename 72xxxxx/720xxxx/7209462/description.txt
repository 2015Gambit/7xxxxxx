Description:
Filmed and directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle in the unique interiors of Vicenza's Teatro Olimpico in 1986, this DVD offers an intimate glimpse of Mozart's first major opera, written when the precocious composer was just fourteen. Nikolaus Harnoncourt leads a stellar cast in portraying the inner circle of the Roman Empire's fiercest enemy: Mithridates, king of Pontus.

Synopsis:
The story is built around the historical character of Mithridates VI Eupator (c. 132-63 BC), king of Pontus, a Hellenic kingdom on the southern shores of the Black Sea. Much of his reign was spent in fighting the growing power of Rome in Asia Minor. The action of the opera is set in the port of Nymphaea in the Crimea, and takes place after Mithridates' final defeat by the Roman general Pompey in 66 BC.

Bonus: Introduction by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, Mozart Showreel, booklet, disc & covers scans.
