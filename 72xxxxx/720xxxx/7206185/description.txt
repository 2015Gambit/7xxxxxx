Antigravity Research Documentaries Seminars (The Best Ones) (UFO technology?)

free energy anti gravity ufos zero point

this is a torrent I upped on demon years ago.. one of my fav collections
with so top notch videos from aussie and UK presentations

Antigravity maybe reality soon after having watched these documentaries
from new and lost research from various scientists and hobbists
from around the world its got to change your mind what the
main stream TV are telling us.

recommend watching the ABC (aussie) doco you will see a wheel rotate on its own and ball bearing that just keeps on rolling in a circle..
skeptics try to debunk it.. but I feel he did a bad job and theres more going on...

seeing is believing .

2nd one to watch first is Case for anitgravity is a brilliant Power point seminar with supporting videos showing known research. This is what I saw first and made me hunt for the other videos I included here


NOTE: Kmplayer latest seems to play these flawlessly but VLC does as well but can loose sound on scrolling forward. 

a copy of the videos is better then no copy after all. (with video flaws)
