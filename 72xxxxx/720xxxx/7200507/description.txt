=======

With the help of government-issued pamphlets, an elderly British couple build a shelter and prepare for an impending nuclear attack, unaware that times and the nature of war have changed from their romantic memories of World War II.

A beautiful story of humour, drama and innocence.

In 1984 the graphic novel was animated into an 80 minute stop-motion and painted-cell cartoon.
