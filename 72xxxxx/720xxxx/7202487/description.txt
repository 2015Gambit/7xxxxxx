ATTENTION: If you are looking for the movie Top Gun WITHOUT the RiffTrax commentary by Mike Nelson and Bill Corbett then DO NOT download this torrent. Please download one of the other hundred or so torrents of the movie itself so you can watch the oily men marathon of towel-snapping each others asses and acting macho without people making fun of it. In other words, if you don't know how to use your eyes and read descriptions of what you download and end up with this torrent by mistake, do not leave comments bitching about the commentary!! This torrent is ONLY for people looking for the RiffTrax commentary synchronized to the video!
