QUALITY of pic.

I replaced my previous 680mb version with this one just for the videp quality.

Its wll done and with yesterdays passing of Tony Scott, enjoy this version of a true 1980s classic.

ablabab, thank you for the time and effort to post this great quality torrent.

BTW, R.I.P. Tony Scott.  :("

Forgive me.

I'm still in sad times for Tony.

TY."
