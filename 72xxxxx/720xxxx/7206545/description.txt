
FACT: It's the 21st century, and every day, the world's largest crop of opium is harvested from the fertile fields of war-torn Afghanistan. It is rushed through Iran to processing labs in Turkey where it is turned into what is, pound-for-pound, one of the most valuable substances on earth: pure-grade Heroin. FACT: The incredible amounts of cash generated from this dark enterprise are deposited in the West's largest banking systems. From London, New York and Washington to Paris, Amsterdam and Istanbul, our banks wash and protect the profits from prisonous enterprise. FACT: "Businessmen" from Iran have purchased an airstrip north of Hamburg, Germany for their "exporting" needs.

FACT or FICTION? With the profits from these dealings, Iran has acquired six nuclear weapons of mass destruction from a retreating Russian army and stands poised as the newest player in the deadly poker game of world domination. The line between fact and fiction is so tight in Larry Collins' new thriller, The Road To Armageddon, that readers will find themselves short of breath trying to separate the reality of this tense yarn from the evenings' headlines.
