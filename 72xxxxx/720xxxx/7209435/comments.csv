,opaleg,2012-04-24T12:59Z,"nobody is stupid.

ANyway, this game is great! Quite a good game for what sort of combo it is. I wish there were more genre benders out there. Thanks to the uploader and to the people involved with developing the game!"
,MagicNic,2012-04-25T01:44Z,I cant find the keygen....
,adam.hear,2012-04-25T13:55Z,"I have tried to extract this file a few diff ways, but I cant...is it split and can someone give me a pointer plz, thx"
,adam.hear,2012-04-25T14:05Z,I am using Winrar
[V],ontotita,2012-04-25T17:40Z,Adam.hear winrar will not help you with bin and cue files. you need software like daemon tools .They are used to emulate a dvd rom.check google for that.
,chmpoure,2012-04-26T14:11Z,thanks!
,Nekro1900,2012-04-26T22:18Z,I can't find the keygen?? I'm sure it's easy to find though.
,adam.hear,2012-04-27T02:06Z,"thanks ontotita, I used power iso and worked really great, thank you for this."
,Seluecos,2012-04-27T23:09Z,"Having issues with the Keygen. It won't open, have it mounted and installed, but the keygen isn't starting. Am I just doing it wrong? Do I need to take the Keygen out of the .cue/.bin first?"
,flatgun719,2012-04-28T10:47Z,"I dont no how to make it work. :C

Can someone help me?"
,RezMar,2012-04-28T15:16Z,"Ok here is the instruction how to have your game working in full.
PS: Sorry for my English

1. First u must have any Image Virtual program, like DAEMON Tools or something like that (you can have it free version).
2. Mount your image file to that program (DAEMON) and u will now install the game.
3. When u install the game u can start and u will see he will ask u for serial number.
4. Go to your opened image disk (for me is G: drive) and there u will see TiNYiSO folder. Open that folder and u will see keygen program. Run it and click generate to have your code. Now just use copy paste.

That's all..."
,finicalwolf,2012-04-28T17:17Z,"me and my friend have both tried to run the keygen in all sorts of windows compatibility modes and it just won't run, could someone please post a few keygen'd codes on here?"

,GObonzo,2012-05-01T03:31Z,"fuck the generic FPS and crappy type RPG that's been the majority these last few years. if developers can't figure out how to put good story, graphics, and gameplay together anymore give us more of the Sword & Sorcery, Legend of Grimrock, and Valley Without Wind we've been seeing this year."
,Clutchoid,2012-05-01T16:44Z,"Working with rezmar's codes, thanks matey.

Im with GOBonzo, there's a very hollywood situation with games right now where the high budget games are the same polished unimaginitive crap we've had repeated over and over since 2004. Indy games from small developers is where it is, where they're forced to think outside the box, hope this is good if it is im buying it, only way small developers will survive."
,Deimos91,2012-05-02T18:09Z,Do the updates work with this? I'm following the developer's blog and he's already put out a few updates with more to come.
,gbad11,2012-05-03T00:22Z,is there a way to make it so you don't have to mount/install it?
,Barbaroto,2012-07-02T19:15Z,"seeed, im downloading in 10kB/s, will take 10 hours lol"
