I am contacting you on the behalf of Mr. Alan Watt of Cutting Through the Matrix, cuttingthroughthematrix.com.  While given your reading list, I can only assume your intentions are good, but unfortunately your unsolicited distribution of this FOR SALE copyrighted material makes it impossible for Mr. Watt to continue disseminating his message.  There are over 1000 hours of free audio and transcripts available at:
http://cuttingthroughthematrix.com/audio.html

And:
http://cuttingthroughthematrix.com/transcripts_Alan_Watt.html


If you don't remove this FOR SALE copyrighted material, one can only assume that your intentions aren't good, and that you are purposefully undercutting Mr. Watt's financing.  

Thank you, for chosing to be a conscientious, honest individual in advance, by removing this content."
