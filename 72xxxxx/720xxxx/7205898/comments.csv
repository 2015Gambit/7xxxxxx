,zakimar,2012-05-04T11:56Z,"^ You are retarded. Krugman is just another Zionist jew that wants the government to keep giving BILLIONS of dollars to his real ""homeland"", APARTHEID israel. Ron Paul loves America and wants to break the hold the Zionist jews have over his country by getting rid of the Fed and saving his country billions every year."

IMO (notice I left out the ""H"" because I'm NOT humble) the only reason many kids are supporting Paul is he wants to legalize drugs and pretty much end military funding and intervention.

There has to be some middle ground on these issues... and considering the GOP wants to increase the military budget by one Trillion beyond what the Pentagon has asked for (yes, I said ""Trillion"") there's a LOT of middle ground there between being the ""policemen of the world"" or cowering under our beds.

Also simply legalizing pot and taxing it wouldn't really help the gov't as far as increased revenue, however the imputed income of NOT spending untold amounts of money to pursue and imprison non-criminals (or what should be non-criminals) which devastates families for no good end would be enormous. 

Do you hear me Democrats?

Ron Paul wants to pretty much de-fund all of government which is well, fucking stupid (it's a technical term) and also de-fund Pell grants and student loans as well as the Department of Education.

Get off your asses, register and VOTE!  AND write your representatives/Senators.

We can NOT allow the Idiot Right OR the Ron Paul crowd to ruin our country.... that means making your voices heard by the DNC and the government."
