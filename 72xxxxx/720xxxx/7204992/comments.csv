,sylant,2012-04-22T16:33Z,I'm trying to seed as much as I can. Please be patient for the first few days. Thanks
,Syne_,2012-04-23T19:03Z,"Thank you for a great upload.

Video & Audio quality are both great :D"
,narayan12,2012-04-27T10:41Z,"Hey, are there any english subtitles? I'm so sad because i can't watch the anime without english subtitles! xD"
,narayan12,2012-04-27T14:45Z,Are there any english subtitles? I need them to watch this :'(
,morasthite,2012-04-29T07:15Z,"Perfect quality, 10/10 for video and audio. On episode 6 there is some censorship. I was wondering if every version was like this or if this is a cut version."
,sylant,2012-04-29T17:03Z,@narayan12  as far as i know there are subtitles. what video player are you trying to use to watch the videos.?
,sylant,2012-04-29T17:05Z,"@morasthite - There is censorship in the whole series and it is usually when someone is bleeding heavily ex: having an arm cut off or an eye gouged out. I don't know if there ever will be a fully uncensored version, but if it is that will come much later. For now these are the highest quality that were broadcasted on Japanese television."
,munecho,2012-04-29T19:34Z,Im having the same problems as narayan. No subtitles are showing up for me. I tried using WindowsMP (perfect video and quality :) ) and both DivX and FLC player. Do i need to download a 10 bit player in order to see the subtitles?
,taters153,2012-04-30T10:48Z,"These are perfect... I made an account just to show my appreciation. I found this show today and immediately fell in love with it. I will be sure to seed as much as possible. 
Everything works perfectly, my only suggestion to people having problems is download VLC media player. /shrug"
,taters153,2012-04-30T10:52Z,"In fact now that I read all of the problems, that is what should fix your problem. VLC media player. There are subtitle options you should be able to load up. If they are not already showing up.

http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"
,sylant,2012-04-30T14:04Z,"@taters153 - Thanks for showing some love and trying to help with the subtitle issues. A side note is that these are the 10bit HD versions and sometimes require a lot of computer processing power. That aside inside of the torrent i placed a readme for this very reason. I used to use VLC, but now I use MPC. Inside of the readme of the torrent is a link to a guide that will show you how to set everything up so that you get the maximum quality out of the videos.

Before doing that i was using CCCP codec pack with MPC and I was able to play 10 bits, but after using the guide to explain what the proper settings are, things have been just great.

Also for everyone check out my other torrents http://thepiratebay.se/user/sylant/"
,narayan12,2012-05-03T12:16Z,"Thanks for replying! I use MPC, really don't know why it isn't working >:( I'm going to try out VLC and see if that works... My videos are saved in a .mkv format, is that normal?"
,sylant,2012-05-05T05:23Z,@narayan12 - yes .mkv is normal now. In my opinion it is becoming the new standard like how avi did. Is it just one video or is it every video with no subtitles.?
,narayan12,2012-05-07T15:31Z,"I tried watching it on VLC and it works perfectly! Amazing quality and very good subtitles.
Finished the anime in 2 days >.< Thanks for uploading!"
,sylant,2012-05-07T16:15Z,"@narayan12 - no problem, just glad you enjoyed it."
,Hellmet1988,2012-05-13T19:31Z,awesome! works perfect with the klite codec pack
,gentleonion,2012-05-20T15:59Z,"people...please seed so i cant watch this in HD, thankyou "

,TacoYaki,2012-06-11T18:52Z,Excellent torrent. Thank you! Will be seeding for three days XD
,Sinidra,2012-06-16T22:04Z,"Exellent quality and just because you made such a little ""poem"" along with the torrent, I decided to make an account on TPB finally and give your torrent a ""+"" :)"
,Satori22,2012-06-21T17:21Z,Great Torrent
,sylant,2012-06-22T06:10Z,"@Sinidra   Thanks, much appreciated. I am looking for the next thing to upload, I just havent seen anything good lately. Any ideas?"
,dementor101,2012-07-10T02:04Z,"This is 100% great quality upload!
Thanks for uploading! I will also try to seed more.

For those having problems on how to play the video or missing the subtitles.

For those having problems playing the video, just install CCCP on your computer using the default settings. Make sure to remove codec conflicts before installation, aka. having other conflicting codec packs. Play the video Windows Media Player Classic Home Cinema that comes with CCCP in playing the video. And then viola! HD quality videos!

For those having problems with the subtitle not showing up, open the Windows Media Player Classic Home Cinema that comes with CCCP. Click the VIEW then OPTIONS. Under the PLAYBACK tab in the OPEN SETTINGS section, you will there a check-box that says AUTO-LOAD SUBTITLES and make sure that is checked. And then viola! You will now see the subtitles!

Hope it works for you since it worked for me! :)"
,ares2020,2012-07-12T23:30Z,"Many thanks for uploading this, i downloaded in in 2 days (bout 7 hours total) and watched in in one day because its just that GD good, this is now in my top 5 favorite Anime's ((that are under 50 eps). I did have problems with playing the videos but after reading the comments i found that updating my VLC player fixed that really quit."
,RoflWafffles,2012-07-16T21:33Z,Everyone please seed as much as you can! Really wanna start this anime ^^
,RoflWafffles,2012-07-16T21:48Z,"Please people seed, I'm at 40kb/s!"

Thank you!"
,halfchaos,2012-07-22T09:14Z,thank you
,Lost_Leaf,2012-07-27T08:25Z,"I know this has been asked a lot but I got a kind of vague impression of uncertainty, so I just wanted to clarify. Does this torrent come with English subtitles? This will be the first Anime that seems good enough for me to break my rule of only watching well English dubbed Anime; I'm excited :D"
,HellsProblem,2012-07-29T20:13Z,"Well, was sitting without internett, when i remembered I downloaded this for later. 
Love the quality,sound and the download went very fast :D
Good english subtitles, so no difficulties there either ^^"
,casanova808,2012-07-31T07:04Z,excellent show thanks for all the seeds plan on seeding for a while thx
,FerociousNova,2012-07-31T16:49Z,"Fantastic quality, thank you for the download. I will be seeding for one week."
,AnotherDeadDream,2012-08-04T03:04Z,"I had the lag issue with VLC, so i checked the official VLC site, redownloaded, (there was a new version), and with the new fancy VLC everything works just fine. Don't use any other players. VLC can play all formats without problem."
,iiREDRUM,2012-08-22T22:55Z,"Great download, but please remember the PS3 users, ""cant get the subs to work on ps3"" "
,iiREDRUM,2012-08-22T22:55Z,has anybody figured out how to get softsubs to work on ps3 ?? 
,MAA11792,2012-08-23T04:24Z,"@iiREDRUM it's rather simple. You download (or buy) a video converter tool, I recommend ""AVS Audio Converter"" but I'm not a hundred percent if that specific software will do that for you, another option is for you to stream your videos directly from VLC to your TV or PlayStation."
,MAA11792,2012-08-23T05:04Z,"My man, the quality and sound is superb. Thank you!"
,Crazy Bastard,2012-09-03T00:04Z,"Great quality, great torrent, awesome show!"
