QM 20 - Matter- antiMatter symmetry

The equilateral charged geometry of Matter ΓÇô antimatter symmetry as explained by Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

A clear, concise scientific explanation of the observed Matter ΓÇô antimatter asymmetry is provided using the Charged geometries of mass-ENERGY-Matter.

In addition to Matter ΓÇô antimatter a new form of Matter [Neutral Matter] is revealed along with an explanation of the spectral emissions from Neutronic Matter for the first time in recorded history.

The first chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
