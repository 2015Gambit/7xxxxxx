William Parker continues to churn out CDs on a pace that might rival Steve Lacy,
Satoko Fujii, or David Murray's epic proportions. While each project reaches
ever higher levels, this recording from the twelfth annual Vision Festival in
New York City might be close to his zenith. Three long compositions allow his
some 16-piece band of horns, woodwinds, and strings to not only cut loose with
potent solos as you would expect, but exist as a single crystalline entity with
multiple and equal facets of ethnic, improvisational, and modern compositional
forms. The music is as stunning as any Parker has devised in his career, but
there are some caveats. For one, Parker plays no acoustic upright bass, leaving
that to Shayne Dulberger. The oud of Brahim Frigbane and electric guitar of Joe
Morris adds a lean and sparse element. But the music is generally broad ranging,
expansive, and layered, thanks to the immense talents of accomplished modernists
like trumpeter Lewis Barnes, alto saxophonist Rob Brown, tenor saxophonist and
clarinetist Sabir Mateen, violinist Jason Kao Hwang, Jessica Pavone on the
viola, and twin drummers Gerald Cleaver and Hamid Drake. Of the three long
pieces, "Lights of Lake George" is a true magnum opus...
