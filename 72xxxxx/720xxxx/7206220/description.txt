::Plot::
The evil Garlic Jr. is gathering the seven Dragon Balls to wish for immortality. Then Garlic Jr. plans to take over the world and make the entire human race suffer for the death of his father. Goku rushes to save Gohan, but arrives at the fortress just as Garlic Jr. summons the Eternal Dragon. Krillin and Piccolo try to help Goku, but their combined strength is no match for Garlic Jr., who creates a "Dead Zone" (black hole) to suck our heroes into oblivion. Suddenly Gohan starts to show his hidden power, but will it be enough?!
