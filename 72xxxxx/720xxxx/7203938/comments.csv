[V],twentyforty,2012-04-21T19:01Z,"It was. Moderator moved it. Any objections? Contact The Management, However, it is 720p and is where it should be uploaded to - but I choose plain ""Movies"" category to avoid stupidities like yours, dummy."

[V],twentyforty,2012-04-22T15:40Z,"@ani12: Almost a year ago (March and June 2011) I had two hard drive crashes and lost several thousands of encodes. The Mechanic duo was one of them, sorry. What survived I seed either here or on my home site (SU). Sorry."
[V],twentyforty,2012-04-22T15:46Z,"@x5x5x71: SU was up and down whole yesterday evening, right in time when I decided to upload this torrent. After upload here, I hit the bed and forgot to upload same to SU. It would be done."
,ani12,2012-04-22T17:19Z,@twentyforty: hmmm... i somehow got confessions.. hav been seeding it since.. hope some1 seeds.. thanks for replyin :) i was on SU.. was thrown out by some1 for my seed ratio being low i guess.. wish i got another shot at being a member man.. thanks for d movies anyway :) u rock :)
,supcena,2012-04-22T17:25Z,thank u ..really appreciate your work :)
[V],twentyforty,2012-04-22T18:48Z,"@ani12: Open some new free e-mail than contact me on gmail.Address you have or can get from older torrent Descriptions. Old, busted account is tied  to e-mail you used to register back then. I can send you a new Invite when registration become possible. However, problems you have regarding the ratio would stay, and I cannot donate GB to hold your back because on SU that god-given function is either disabled or broken. You should use some new uTorrent or Transmission, get VIP status there and forget about ratio related problems.

Regarding downloading older torrents, I seed what have been on seedboxes before HDD crashed and newer things - over 2500 movies and TV shows, some here (maybe two dozen) and mostly on SU. So..."
,abj642,2012-04-22T21:19Z,thanks 20-40 for all your efforts
,ani12,2012-04-23T11:23Z,"@twentyforty: if i get back on su, i'll seed bro... for a long time... will tat be enuf? i hav no idea how2 become a vip :("
[V],twentyforty,2012-04-23T17:02Z,"Private sites act as clubs. By doing Donations (every site has ""Donate"" button, so SU has one on main page) members can get back - privileges. 

It is useful for people who cannot seed back, to maintain ratio over 1:1 in best spirit of true file-sharing.

This place differs very  much (TPB and other  few remaining public torrent-sites), people just download and seed nothing back. Here, I hit constantly ratio over 100 in first few hours (because my files are so small) and it means that over hundred people actually downloaded encode - but immediately run away. 99.8% perform Hit&Run. Grab and go away. My torrents here look sad having few seeds (usually same people seed and majority act as idiots).

On private sites, it cannot happen. ""Paying the price"" for seeding nothing back can be done by donating few bucks every how and then and by that, making site running and getting in return Gigabytes of Upload credits.

Other way is to get seedbox and fast line for uploads (seeding back). "
[V],twentyforty,2012-04-23T17:04Z,how and then = now and then
,ani12,2012-04-23T17:35Z,"right now i'm a student... cant afford to pay @twentyforty.. sorry.. isn't it fine if i jus seed wen n if i get back on su? pls tell me, its fine.. i really miss ur uploads to say d least...."
[V],twentyforty,2012-04-23T19:02Z,"It is perfectly fine if your line/connection has no problems of own, member as you use new and approved program, get torrent early enough (not been 36th of 40 downloaders), keep every torrent active for weeks and gather Bonus points for that and later Trade that Bonus for Upload Credits and - download exactly how much he can seed back.
People who cannot seed back must control temptation to get as much as hearts desire.

I usually help, donating GB, but I said right here, why is that not possible right now. When that function get fixed, simple PMing is all one need. 

Point being, it is the club and as every club - have rules which members must respect."
[V],twentyforty,2012-04-23T19:14Z,"By the way (I missed to say) - I have NOTHING with site donations, never ever have, and I have no interest at all in anything alike. I am just a member there. And uploader, same as here.

It was advice given to you how Ratio related problem on any private tracker torrent site can be avoided."
,ani12,2012-04-23T20:17Z,"hmmmm... thanks a lot man @twentyforty :) got a new gmail acc jus for su:D do tell me wen d registrations r available :) cant wait to meet u thr :) u wudn't believe, but i actually go 1000's of pages  backtracking, jus2 c wat u hav uploaded :) hope i get a chance soon :) n thanks a lot for replyin to all my questions man.. n lastly pls do upload a bit more on tpb than now.. miss ur uploads man, tats d only reason..."

[V],twentyforty,2012-04-26T15:40Z,"@ani12: I don't think so. Check Spam folder too, in case gmail blacklists torrent sites."
