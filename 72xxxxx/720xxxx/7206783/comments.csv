,MissAlice,2012-04-22T20:34Z,"Footy. Thanks again for the uploads and even more for deleting the adds.

That 4000 toerag is a real nice piece of work. Bet his parents are so proud of him, wait did he have any? No wonder the world is like it is with ass holes like that. He should jump off the nearest tall building, asap. Would make the world just a little bit better without him in it. Herr's to his short life, it already been going on far to long. LOL.
From just a poor person, so not a better one like VUDU4000."
,MissAlice,2012-04-22T20:39Z,"PS. Noticed he did not deny being on drugs after I suggested it. Guess he's really someone to pity more than anything else. He's got a lot to lean being so young, lets hope he don't lean it the hard way, like me. But he will sure have to lean. Brother."
