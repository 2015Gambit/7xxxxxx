QM 16 ΓÇô Constants

The equilateral geometry behind the Constants of Nature as developed in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

Building from a simple geometric premise the geometry of all Quantum Mechanical Constants is revealed.

Elaborating on the established geometric view of Tetryonics the Natural constants are revealed as a result of the geometry of mass-ENERGY interactions for the first time in recorded history.

The sixteenth chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an geometric explanation for the quantum mechanical source of natural constants in quantum mechanics for the Science of the new millennia.
