,MrDouglas,2012-04-22T16:53Z,"Thanks for the upload, I'm a rather huge fan of this terrific sf/fantasy author (even have most of her books in paperback) and hope more people will discover her. 
About the only thing I can see missing is the terrific two-part novel The Awakeners (Northsore and Southshore) , I have this in somewhat older formats (doc, lit and pdf) from some other torrent, can upload if people want to complete their collection.

At first I thought that After Long Silence was missing also but it's there under another name, The Enigma Score. Once again, thanks for the upload!"
