Narratives:

The 2012 album of STbastien Tellier, a multifaceted instrumentalist/singer from Paris, France's 17th Arrondissement, an elongated arts-and-culture-rich territory located near the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs +lysTes. After Tellier's "Fantino," a forlorn and beautiful pop confection, appeared on the Source label's 1999 Source Material various-artists compilation, it caught the ear of fellow labelmates Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoet Dunckel, better known as Air. The duo and their management team eventually signed Tellier to their own Record Makers imprint.
