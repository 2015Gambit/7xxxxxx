,e0je,2012-04-23T06:39Z,do not download it has a password protected rar file directing you to some site to get password where you have to click ADs to get the pw ..  you suck uploader
,koka3,2012-04-23T08:13Z,"This is not password protected, ettv does not password protect"
,RexRexroth,2012-04-23T08:28Z,It's not a .rar upload: it's a plain old .avi.
,RexRexroth,2012-04-23T08:34Z,"Uh, then why is it downloading as an .avi file on my computer.  Of the eight choices to download ""Mad Men"" this week (so far), two are .rar fakes with passwords which screw up your computer, two have about 8 minutes of the The Lifetime Channel stuck in the middle starting at 36 minutes (although ""Mad Men"" resumes in full afterwards, there is one .mkv file (I hate that format!), and the other three seem to be reliable .avi files."

,PBR-Streetgang,2012-04-25T10:52Z,"i have seen some uploads that would be .rar files at the start and then change to .avi. i would not have thought it possible that it changed but they did, and also explained why 2-4 posts would be made saying it was a passworded RAR and then many more stating that it was fine.
One was a EZTV upload.
anyhow, thanks for the AVI upload ettv."

,tuhcoolyuh,2012-04-30T19:41Z,"This file is good.  Those who say otherwise are probably trying to steer traffic toward their own password/ads scam. Thanks, ettv, for always being reliable and super-quick to upload new shows.  I typically only download files from ettv."
