But I had to delete this game because it screwed up my Mac App Store apps I paid for. What was CORE thinking leaving a mas receipt inside this? Me and a friend spent hours trying to figure out why we couldn't download updates from mac app store until we deleted this dumb game. We got a message over and over again to log in to another Apple account.
CORE's game releases lately have been shite. First Civilization V: Campaign Edition - 1.0.7 was broken and nuked. Then Anomaly Warzone 1.2 was broken too!
And now this newb move. Come on CORE test your games before releasing and don't put mas receipts into apps like newbs!"
