,jimmyb123,2012-05-14T07:42Z,"Wight guy with goatee and shaved heads, and lots of black actors . Not fucking likely back then.  the US hasn't event got slaves yet, never mind them living amongst every one, and sailing the big blue see. sorry i just like the long hared scurvy dog, looking pirates of the time. makes the movie more real. other then that the movie was alright.

,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-05-23T01:23Z,"Personally I don't understand why everyone on this site feels the need to be a f**king movie critic.
If the quality's good, say it's good. If it's shit, then say so."

,QWESTSUX,2012-05-26T10:07Z,"I, like most of the community, still rate comparatively based on the source. I just rated an HD cam an 8/8 because of the relativity to other cams i've seen.

Your scale means nothing out of context"
,village1diot,2012-05-26T11:19Z,"I don't understand why everyone has to be a dick to someone who is just trying to help out. Big deal if it wasn't thought out very well and is pretty much a useless system. 

He is probably American, so give him a break. Most of them don't like thinking."
