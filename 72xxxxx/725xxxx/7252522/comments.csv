,sassysizzle,2012-05-08T23:20Z,"A MASSIVE THANKS TO YOU MATE!  I'm in the US and Female and don't have an issue calling you one!  How warm and cozy would it be hear in the US if we all naturally regarded each other as mate, brother, sister etc.  Thank you very much for all of the uploading.  I don't know a thing about saving as a torrent, but appreciate your diligence.  Your service has added value to my family time and viewing!  "
