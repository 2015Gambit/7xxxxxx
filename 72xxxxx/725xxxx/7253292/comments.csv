,Zirop92,2012-05-08T21:09Z,Emuparadise Has a Nice collection Of games For The Dreamcast and Romhustler does also have some But their Host is slower so itl take a while longer to download
,Zirop92,2012-05-08T21:11Z,And there is Seeders on the torrent.. Im currently behind a 50mb/s Upload line so Speeds wont be any problem
