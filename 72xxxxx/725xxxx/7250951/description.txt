"Post Mortem"

The team takes on the case of Dr. 
Peter Treiber, a pathologist at 
Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching 
Hospital who knows too much about the 
hospital staff to trust any of the 
physicians. The only person he does 
respect is House, who has 
mysteriously gone missing. With House 
in absentia, the team has to figure 
out how to treat Treiber while making 
him believe that House is calling all 
the shots.

18/Slower+
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
