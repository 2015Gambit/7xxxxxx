James Blunt you are beautiful mp3 file with cover, album name, album artist and everything you will need for a song :) almost like iTunes bought


As a friendly advice if you happen to download music which doesnt have a cover or anything like that, download mp3 Tag, its a good program, you just need to download the cover, preferably 500 by 500 or 300 by 300 and link it :)

PS: this is my first torrent and i dont really know how to operate things very well, if anyone would care to help thatll be pretty much appreciated :)
