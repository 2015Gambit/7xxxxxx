,WuzzlePopple,2012-08-20T01:08Z,"epub is a better format i think than pdf, just download the torrent, and once downloaded, send the epub format to your email. go and open the epub in your email and once open it will ask if you want to open it up in your ibooks. if you don't have ibooks, it's free in the app store, or if you are not through itunes, there should be some book reading app that works for you "
