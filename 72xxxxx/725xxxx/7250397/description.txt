ReleaseNotes:

All-female trio SWV (or Sisters with Voices) had a series of new jack swing hits
during the 1990s that earned them a Grammy Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

SWV met when they were at school. They found they had a mutual interest in music and sung together in the church choir. It was there that they decided to make a career in music and recorded a demo. The tape came to the attention of producer Teddy Riley who was so impressed he took control of production of their debut album. It's About Time went double platinum, helped by several singles.

Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.
HHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.
We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
