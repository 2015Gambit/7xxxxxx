Breathless by Dean Koontz


In the stillness of a golden September afternoon, deep in the wilderness of the Rockies, a solitary craftsman, Grady Adams, and his magnificent Irish wolfhound Merlin step from shadow into light and into an encounter with enchantment.

That night, through the trees, under the moon, a pair of singular animals will watch GradyΓÇÖs isolated home, waiting to make their approach.
