He belongs in a labor camp for the rest of his life, being raped daily by ""non-pure European"" people. I think he's a closet queer and that is what he hopes for anyway - wait until he gets the AIDS he deserves."
,Luciphage,2012-05-09T18:07Z,"I agree with zakram (a rare thing). People like this don't deserve the privilege of existing. I have a feeling that this manifesto is just the usual paranoid racist tribal ranting. I'll pass.

As a side note, does anyone else think this tool looks like Phil Collins?

No offense to Phil, some of his songs rock. "

Emotionally intelligent? Yes."
,RitterGF,2012-05-11T00:38Z,"Al-Quaida has stated that they are different terrorists and can not be compared to Breivik. 

We completely agree. He is absolutely different than Muslim terrorists.

First off, he is much smarter than Muslim brothers.
Secondly, he did not cause the death of thousands.
Thirdly, he has far more intellectual personality while compared to Muslim ""freedom fighters"".

He had a clear political agenda of how he wants to shape Europe. This is something a delusional psychopath is incapable of doing.

Everything is described in detail in the Manifesto and it's quite interesting to read actually. You can find many rational sentences and thoughts in there. Islam has never been a race. It is therefore not racism to oppose it.

It is important to know that immigrants are not the ones responsible for this extreme cultural and demographical shift. The corrupt politicians are the ones to blame for the caused misery of multiculturalism.

End of topic!"
,johnniebrasco1,2012-07-28T03:09Z,"RitterGF: Yes i agree that the politicians are to blame for both the multiculturalism and breivik. But you don't need to be insane to be fucked in the head!! And his political agenda involved concentration camps for the non-christians. Norway is not fucking christian??? I'm an atheist (norwegian), did he want to put me there too, or was it just the muslims and the brown ones? It should have been solved by one shot in the head at UtĂ¸ya. Would have saved us billions (milliarder, altsĂĽ). I have read the manifesto, and i must say he's full of shit, except for the fact that the politicians have no control of the borders anymore. Integrate the ones who are already there before taking in more!!! Hard?? There's an election in Norway in 2013, use the vote to change the government. Fucking pussies they are."
