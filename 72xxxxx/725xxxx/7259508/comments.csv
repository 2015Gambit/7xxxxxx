,anderooB33,2012-05-11T15:10Z,"Overall 6/10 (for CamRip)
slight rustling
some audience laughter
its focused, but its scratchy
worthy enough to watch if you really can't wait for DVD/BR rip
[film is mediocre - marvel ain't what it use to be]"
,cacciatore,2012-05-11T18:29Z,if you really cant wait for the dvdrip go to the fuckin cinema then!
