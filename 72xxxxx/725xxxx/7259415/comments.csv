,mojo84,2012-07-09T06:40Z,Works Great (BTW block WShelper.exe) it is the program that checks if the serial is used too much(which it is) Block that and set autoupdate to never and it works GREAT
,Pryor06,2012-08-23T22:06Z,"Mine was working until now. After successfully registering using the keygen the first time last month, I suddenly got the ""...registration code has exceeded the limitation"" tonight. 

Keygen no longer works for me. I get ""Improper registration code"". I think they're using the same keygen for the different versions of Wondershare here. 

From what I've read from other users, After your registration pulls through, you should start blocking WSHELPER.exe because it the one which detects if you have an original copy.

Is there a workaround for users like me? another keygen perhaps?"
