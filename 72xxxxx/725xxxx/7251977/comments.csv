Unfortunately for everyone, this is stuck at 69% for all of the peers - no one has the entire lot of this package, so if you have the whole package, please put it back into seeding!"
,AardvarkFirefly,2012-06-08T23:47Z,"OK, I appreciate the boost - but now we are all stuck at 99%.  So close!  Don't give up!"
,bozanian,2012-06-12T11:30Z,Please seed for this. I am also stuck at 99%. Thanks. 
,MySecrets,2012-06-17T12:16Z,"Go to this site:

The material is there, I believe.

,MySecrets,2012-06-17T12:25Z,"Specifically, the four missing files from this torrent are:

http://files.gamepub.sk/Bakalar/Bakalarka/Materialy/ITIL/ITIL/Mock%20Exams/answers.pdf

http://files.gamepub.sk/Bakalar/Bakalarka/Materialy/ITIL/ITIL/Module5/Service_V_Model.pdf

http://files.gamepub.sk/Bakalar/Bakalarka/Materialy/ITIL/ITIL/Module2/ITIL_V3.pdf

http://files.gamepub.sk/Bakalar/Bakalarka/Materialy/ITIL/ITIL/Module8/CSI_Improvement_Process.pdf

I cannot upload these to complete the torrent because the one missing piece also contains an 826 byte file titled Readme.txt. If I had that, the torrent would be 100% complete.

You can get all of the torrent content by downloading those four files files and placing them in the appropriate folders."
,AardvarkFirefly,2012-06-24T10:42Z,"Hey MySecrets: You rock!

THANK YOU!!!!!  

I hope the ReadMe file wasn't too important!"
,newbsos,2012-07-18T03:39Z,"It's been repackaged and uploaded at http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7453038/ITIL_v3_-_The_Art_of_Service_Online_Learning_Videos_-_Complete doesn't have the readme.txt, that's all. Thanks to MySecrets for posting the missing files."
