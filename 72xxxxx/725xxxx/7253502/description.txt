Dr. Rocket is a exciting, addictive, fast paced physics game.

You control a wacky flying professor with rocket boots attached to his feet. You can choose your controls between, "Tilt" or, "Touch".

Your objective is to launch him as fast as possible into the stratosphere through a riveting and challenging obstacle course. You will encounter and overcome many hurtles throughout your journey into space. The gripping gameplay will keep your on your toes while you enjoy the exhilaration of extreme flight.

After a vertical blast off, you will collect coins and fuel while slipping and sliding through turns. You can fly even faster when you pass through the rocket boosters. But watch out for planes, asteroids, menacing space junk and deadly spikes!

Collect every single coin and complete each level with the fastest time possible.
