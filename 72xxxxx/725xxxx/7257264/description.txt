Los Angeles-based symphonic black metal band, Sothis, originally formed in late 1999. The founding members conducted an exhaustive search for Los Angeles' best, seeking like-minded musicians to complete an impressive line-up. Five years later, the band produced a complete line-up and entered the studio to record a four song self-titled demo. This demo would prove to be a critically acclaimed masterpiece that would land the band features in major magazines such as Revolver, Zero Tolerance, and Pit. The demo received nearly unanimous stellar reviews, even landing Sothis the coveted "Best Independent" release of 2005 in Canada's own Brave Words and Bloody Knuckles. Sothis embarked on a Southwest mini tour in support of the release of the demo and this successful tour would spawn the release of two limited edition live DVDs.
