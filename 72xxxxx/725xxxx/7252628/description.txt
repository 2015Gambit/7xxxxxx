I ran across this when my ex Brother-in-Law retired an old People PC Win 98 machine and gave it to me to play with.It include a disc,(Genuine as it turned out) Windows 98 SE !PLUS with the CD key.)

Anyway the image for the jewel case(which has the CD key on it) and an ISO copy of the disc are here together.Use this on 1 of those old Pentium MMX or AMD k6-2 super socket 7 machines.Have fun.
