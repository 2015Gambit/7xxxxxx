,randallytxt,2012-05-08T18:12Z,"In fact, I AM STILL USING WIN98, this email is written in such a computer. If properly installed and duly preserved (scandisks, defrags, etc.) it never gives me any trouble and with the many tricks to make it go faster, it runs fast in any PC more than P3. I hate  "
,randallytxt,2012-05-08T18:16Z,"(I was cut off) Win XP with all its stupid warning messages and later versions, I only use it now for programs that dont run in 98.

I dont plan to upgrade unless forced to by circumstances. Win98 was the stable, excellent final version of Windows as far as I am concerned. "
,keywest33,2012-05-08T18:55Z,I have an old pc p3 here and gonna put it on that

,randallytxt,2012-05-08T19:13Z,"... and I forgot two of the most important advantages: win 98 runs in TEN TIMES less space, 250 Mb and 2.5 Gb for XP, besides, old versions of ghost work beautifully with Win98, I have ten small disks with the full version of my PC with all programs, etc., if anything goes wrong with my disk, I just replace it and I am back in business as if nothing had happened, with other systems you have to re-install everything, a nightmare. Friends with Win 7 and others have seen my P3 or P4 with Win98 and 400 Mb RAM and they were surprised is almost as fast as theirs..."
