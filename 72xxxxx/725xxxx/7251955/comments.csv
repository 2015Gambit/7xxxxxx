[V],twentyforty,2012-05-08T13:16Z,"@wish123: I honestly have no idea. It depends on many factors. Currently I am here, even if this place allowed bullying me out year ago.

@HDrocks: I love that comedy series from day one, but - HiDef sources are not available for older seasons (HD airings are relatively new stuff) and I need that  as the source. Season Four I have lost in two HDD crashes last year."
[V],twentyforty,2012-05-12T12:13Z,@HDrocks: On SU I would upload seasons 1 to 3 as DVDrips and fourth as HDTV.
