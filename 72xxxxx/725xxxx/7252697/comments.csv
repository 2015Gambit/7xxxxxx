I was therefore quite surprised that when I clicked on the first image, I got the page unavabilable message... and then when I clicked on the second image, I got multiple and I think fake ""virus"" messages.  I think they were fake because it was found by MS security essentials which is not even installed on my machine... what's going on?"

There is nothing wrong with the image links
What i think that happend is the website with the images is full of Ads and because of that you probrably got send to a website that fakes a virus scan 
I use ADBlocker pro with Firefox to prevent Ads from popping up"
