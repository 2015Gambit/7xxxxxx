Buena Vista Fishing Club

Cuba - arguably the world's most fashionable travel destination, is also one of the hottest places to go fishing in the whole world. Matt Hayes, a professional fisherman and journalist, visits Cuba on a journey of discovery. With an old Lada for transport, he starts out West in the province of Pinar del Rio and finishes, some eight hundred miles later, in Cuba's second capital city, Santiago.


One of the best fishing series I've watched, glad to be able to find a decent copy again! Really interesting locations and some excellent fishing.
