,Calel1234,2012-05-10T22:19Z,"MrDT, how many uploaders are there? 

I know of mirrormaster, GunningHawk, you, wowcabbage, Xpatriated, GIANISS511, and now mdusanjay. Sometimes I can't find certain comic uploads only to discover there is a new uploader. Do you know where I might go to keep track of this? "
