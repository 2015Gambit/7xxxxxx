What am I doing wrong? I have The Sims 3 installed on my computer. I purchased it awhile ago from my hometown in USA."

,momocoal,2012-07-04T09:02Z,"for all the people who are getting the regional install error i found a fix: go to your registery (home button and ""r"" key) and go to HK_LOCAL_MACHINE. then click on software then wow6432Node. then click on the Electronic arts folder. then right click on the sims folder and find SKU make sure you click ""match whole string only"" double click on the SKU file and type in either 1 2 or 7

,Zzeino,2012-07-22T10:56Z,"Alright I tired clicking on the Damn ""The Sims™ 3 World Adventures Installer"" and it just bounces and does nothing, then I tried using Crossover Games to open the ""Autorun"" and it says: (This Product requires an installed copy of The Sims™3. Please install The Sims™ 3 before installing this Product). The same goes for the The Ep1 thing. So then I tried using the installer in the Game folder and it says: (There is no Windows Program configured to open this File) So WTF?! What do I do?"
,tv13,2012-08-17T06:41Z,Mac Users: Rename the file from .rar to .dmg. Then double-click. Try launching the installer. You have to get a key from SerialSeeker or using the included .exe on a Windows machine (or using Crossover).
,sanpatwod,2012-09-01T23:15Z,i download and when i try to install it says my current sims version needs to be updated so i do that and then install the expansion but it keep always asking me for cd even when i do all the no cd stuff help plz
