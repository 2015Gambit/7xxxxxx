                             The Complete Season 1


Unforgettable (previously titled The Rememberer) is an American crime/mystery television series.

Former Syracuse, New York police detective Carrie Wells has hyperthymesia, a rare medical condition that gives her the ability to visually remember everything.[1] She reluctantly joins the New York City Police Department's Queens homicide unit after her former boyfriend and partner asks for help with solving a case. The move allows her to try to find out the one thing she has been unable to remember, which is what happened the day her sister was murdered.

The opening narration by Poppy Montgomery as follows:

    "I'm Carrie Wells. Only a few people in the world have the ability to remember everything. I'm one of them. Pick any day of my life, and I can tell you what I saw or heard: faces, conversations, clues (which comes in handy when you're a cop.) If I miss something the first time it's okay. I can go back and look again. My life...is unforgettable."
