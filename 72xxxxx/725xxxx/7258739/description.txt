This is yet another MW2 mod, much like alterIWnet, which was KIA by craptivision, but better. This is a legit project by NTAuthority, who was the initial creator of AlterIWnet. There are other "Rip-Offs" of alterIWnet such as AlterRevolution, which will be down eventually. This has been known by craptivision for much time now, and they cant seem to do anything about it. In order to use this you must make a forum account at fourdeltaone.net to login. Those will be your credentials for IW4M. Note: This version doesnt have an auto updater yet, but you may look for updates at fourdeltaone.net. Another Note: IW4M is for LEGIT VERSIONS ONLY! But this version is special, so dont go on the forums asking about anything related to warez, patches, torrents, etc. You will get banned from IW4M. This is MW2 Online for PC, its also been ported for Linux, but this version is for PC. Have Fun and YOU ARE A PIRATE!
