Excellent Ambient/Dungeon Synth album by the Satyricon musician, Sigurd Wongraven.
One of the more underestimated albums in the history of humanity.
I recommend this heartily to every fan of more folky/romantic Black Metal.
As usual, this is in 320kbps and ID3-tagged correctly, and includes the cover.
