Pee Wee King - Pee Wee King & His Golden West Cowboys [6 CD set]
Bear Family
BCD 15727 FI
1994

(6-CD LP-Sized Box Set with 66-page book, 152 tracks) One of the
strangest stories in country music is how a polka bandleader called
Frank Kuczynski from Wisconsin became Pee Wee King and led a big
band on the Opry, then wrote several of the biggest hits in country
music history. The story is here, and the music is here, including
the original versions of Tennessee Waltz, Slow Poke and Bonaparte's
Retreat, as well as lesser-known classics like Tennessee Central #9,
Ten Gallon Boogie, Jukebox Blues, Bull Fiddle Boogie, Birmingham
Bounce, Plantation Boogie, and even the first cover version of Blue
Suede Shoes. All told, there are 151 songs cut for RCA and Bullet
between 1946 and 1958. Nothing swung harder than the Golden West Cowboys!
