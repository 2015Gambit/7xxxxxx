,thunderbum,2012-05-11T04:48Z,"I tripped over an alternate URL when I googled today's podcast. Still can't catch a magnet link.

I looked under the General tab and the 'associate with torrent files as well as the install IPv6/install Teredo' are greyed out. No amount of fiddling in the Preferences changes that. Is this because I'm using a laptop with Window 7 x64?

Thanks for any and all feedback. Much appreciated!"
