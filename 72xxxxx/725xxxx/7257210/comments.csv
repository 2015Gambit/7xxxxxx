,AnonVE,2012-05-27T20:08Z,This is the cracked english version or the cracked japanese with the english DLL?
,tpbkid-24,2012-05-29T23:25Z,"@AnonVE not sure, I think it is the English version, but either way the database is in english, so either way its good."
,glixtcher,2012-06-05T19:59Z,"Thank you bro for a working torrent! Very simple too. Just follow the Instructions; you can't go wrong.
Once again, thanks. I'll be seeding."
,Kiramaru,2012-06-06T07:19Z,"Finally, finally, finally! Thanks, been looking for somewhere to get my hands on this for a while now."
,AnonVE,2012-06-22T07:14Z,"meh... I downloaded this. The crack converts the english version on to the the japanese one. I can't see the tile ID's on the japanese version with the english DLL. Is the same crack that is rolling through youtube and all forums. But anyway thanks, someone should try to hack the english version"
,AmuLight,2012-06-23T04:08Z,"AnonVE
That isn't true. If you used the files from the torrent from install of RPG Maker VX to the cracking process, it works great. I tested it several times before I released it."
,taarna23,2012-07-02T08:57Z,"Make sure you have no previous install in place, and simply follow the instructions. The register screen will still be in Japanese (which won't display properly on most systems), just fill it out with whatever, it will accept the info regardless of what it is and allow you to proceed."
,ijoaum,2012-07-03T03:51Z,"Works ok for me.
Just make sure you have installed .NET Framework 4."
,nevermask7,2012-07-04T14:30Z,Followed instructions to the tee.  Not working.  Critical Error C0000005 Error at 00401721
,Shquishay,2012-07-19T12:40Z,Didn't translate the database to English. Had to DL a separate template file.
,Tosh_The_Cupcake,2012-08-12T09:59Z,"So I've followed the Read Me up to the crack but whenever I get to it a thing pops up that says ""Where is RPG VX Maker Ace?"" and I hit browse but no matter how hard I look I can't find the file it wants me to give it! Help please!!! As added info I did have a RPG Maker VX but I uninstalled it though I did keep my created game files. Will I have to delete those to complete this torrent download?"
