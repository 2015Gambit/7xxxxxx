want to burn so you have the game for another time.
You most have dual layer DVD ROM 8.5 GB 
1/ clean the disk create ISO file with GOG exe installer + the next 4 bin file
the last BIN file number 5 is on side of normal CD 700 MB also create ISO file for that then copy 
8.5GB DVD ROM and 700MB to where you want so you have 1 installer and 5 BIN files at same 
place allow integrity to run first and then make your install    "

I GOT IT WORKING NOW!!!  SOOOO SIMPLE ...AS USUAL


After install, You just NEED patch 1.5 here:

http://downloads.atari.com/TheWitcher/patch/DirectorsCutPatch.exe

6. Run the game


Also you might want Director Cut and install this

This patch fixes some bugs, adds 5 extra adventures & removes the disc check for the game.


the crack for this game in not needed now and is no good anyways
