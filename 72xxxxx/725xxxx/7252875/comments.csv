[V],psspss,2012-05-09T09:46Z,"theres a 720p on news groups I believe but not
seen it on pub trackers.. maybe on private ones now

but I do xvids (converts)

if you use VLC and its sharpener the weakness vanishes/foggyness

(no other player sharpener comes close to vlcs method
try it)

it almosts like upscaling even works well on HD sources

else it can appear foggy on other players or if not using it"
