Synopsis:

After the terror unleashed on Lake Victoria in PIRANHA 3D, the pre-historic school of blood thirsty piranhas are back. This time, no one is safe from the flesh eating fish as they sink their razor sharp teeth into the visitors of summer's best attraction, The Big Wet Water Park. Christopher Lloyd (BACK TO THE FUTURE) reprises his role as the eccentric piranha expert with survivor Paul Scheer (THE LEAGUE) and a partially devoured Ving Rhames (PULP FICTION) back for more fish frenzy. David Hasselhoff trades in the sandy beaches of "Baywatch" to be a celebrity lifeguard at the racy water park.
