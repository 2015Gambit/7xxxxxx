Bad Company was an English rock supergroup founded in 1973, consisting of two former Free 
band members ΓÇö singer Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke ΓÇö as well as Mott the Hoople 
guitarist Mick Ralphs and King Crimson bassist Boz Burrell. Peter Grant, who, in years 
prior, was a key component of fellow British rock band Led Zeppelin's rise to fame, managed 
the band. Bad Company enjoyed great success throughout the 1970s. Many of their singles, 
such as "Bad Company", "Can't Get Enough", "Good Lovin' Gone Bad", and "Feel Like Makin' 
Love", retain popularity with rockers of both the past and present decades. To this day, 
their songs remain staples of classic rock radio.
