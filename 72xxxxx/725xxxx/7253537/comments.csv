,Shadow416,2012-07-03T21:51Z,"excellent quality!

My only issue is the movies Bardock The Super Saiyan and Eradicate the Super Saiyans cannot be converted to another format. I tried Mkvmerge Gui with mkv2vob and even xilisoft video converter also tried .h264 extract, non seem to work.

The movie plays brilliantly in VLC as mkv format but I wanted to watch on the ps3 or on the blue ray player with the bigger tv.

Any suggestions? I tried streaming to ps3 but I don't know how to do that properly since it keeps failing on me lmao"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-05T04:12Z,Try Ps3Mediaserver or Use Format Factory/Handbrake to re-encode the files

,weaping_reaper,2012-07-17T06:28Z,"@ Shadow416  .. If you have a flat screen, just get a VGA cable and awesome pc speakers.. that's what we've always dun :-D "
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-18T13:39Z,"and do not use VGA cables, if you have VGA there is no reason for you to even play HD videos since VGa is SD Use HDMi or dVi."
