Reese is able to track his and Finch's next case, a woman named Zoe Morgan, when she uses his vehicle for hire service. In watching her as he drops her off from place to place, Reese learns that she is a high priced "fixer", which often places her in potentially dangerous and precarious situations. As such, Reese figures she is the target of someone associated with one of her current or past clients. When the situation arises, it becomes apparent that she is being targeted by Mark Lawson, one of her clients, the CFO and heir apparent to Virtanen Pharmaceuticals.
