Tony Robinson's Superstitions
Tony Robinson explores the weird and wonderful history of belief, superstition and religious experience in Britain -- a terrifying world of walking corpses and evil spirits - the world that our ancestors thought they lived in. For 2000 years, Britain has been a Christian country. Or has it? In fact, our ancestors actually kept many other dark, fantastical beliefs alive. It was a world underpinned by outlandish, dangerous and plain weird beliefs. Ideas that today seem unbelievable, but were seen as uncontroversial and hugely influential, with some having shaped our history as much as mainstream religion.........aka Gods and Monsters

2,000 years ago, religion was vastly different. Join us as we investigate some of the darker rituals of our pagan ancestors. Tony Robinson delves into Britain's past to scrutinise the diverse religious belief systems that were practised by its inhabitants centuries ago.
