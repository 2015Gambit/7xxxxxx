I couldn't find this soundtrack anywhere on the web, and obviously not in music stores, which are darn near obsolete.  Found one online vendor selling a cassette, so I bought it, digitized it, and hopefully made it easier to find for others wanting it.  

One of my favorite movies, and I love the soundtrack, as well.
