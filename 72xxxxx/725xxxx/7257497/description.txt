"Legacy"

The year is 2002 in the Hamptons. 
Emily, who is still Amanda Clarke, is 
wayward and reckless until Nolan 
convinces her to read her father's 
journals. It is then that it all starts 
sinking in, and Amanda starts staking 
out the Grayson home, identifying all 
the Grayson Global players her father 
described, and piecing together the 
truth. Her anger builds into 
determination and focus; this is where 
it all begins - the genesis of Amanda's 
ultimate plan to bring justice to her 
father.
