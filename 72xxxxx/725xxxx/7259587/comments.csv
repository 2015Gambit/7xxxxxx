,ht0fff,2012-05-10T21:38Z,"@YIFY: Is there any chance you can add some info on the audio (codec, bitrate, channels)?
Last time I downloaded a movie I found out that it was at 31kb/s and 2 channels only. A movie like this one should be in 5.1 with 192 kb/s."
,SerSpec-V,2012-05-10T23:37Z,Waiting for 720p.
,dbkumaran,2012-05-11T18:42Z,"720p please..,"
,ht0fff,2012-05-11T20:16Z,Has anyone info on the audio?
,ht0fff,2012-05-11T22:14Z,"Audio: AAC, 92.0 Kbps, 2 channels. YIFY encoded movies seem to have all crappy 2 channels audio at a low bitrate."
,voldman99,2012-05-13T01:29Z,"Video - good
Audio - poor
What a let down. Had to crank up the volume just to hear the dialogue :-("
,ht0fff,2012-05-13T19:54Z,"@voidman99: I stopped downloading YIFY movies. they have brilliant picture quality, but they are unwatchable because of low audio bitrate and 2 channels only."

,kurtlane,2012-05-27T06:40Z,"If it 1080p BRay rip, why is the res only 1920x800?  Should be 1920x1080!"
,woody5,2012-06-03T02:29Z,"it's widescreen dummyhead
would you prefer having the black bars included?"
,bfc2012,2012-06-04T15:30Z,"@ht0fff: wow, you're amazing! please tell us more about yourself!"
,Nogyy,2012-07-11T12:45Z,"Excellent torrent, 10/10. I always look for YIFY uploads first"
,BlameHoffmann420,2012-07-19T04:29Z,"YIFY is a dumbass. 

If you don't know what 1080P MEANS, then don't put it in the god damn title. 

1920x1080 =/= 1920x800"
