Review by Scott Yanow:
The music on this quartet date (which features vibraphonist Milt Jackson, pianist Horace Silver, bassist Percy Heath, and drummer Connie Kay) is excellent, but the playing time (31 minutes) is on the low side, particularly when one considers that Jackson did a lot of recording for Prestige. The music itself makes for an enjoyable straight-ahead set, with Bags and Silver making for a good combination on five standards and Jackson's "Stonewall."
