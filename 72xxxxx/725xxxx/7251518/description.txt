The Tibetan Book of the Dead: A Way of Life / The Great Liberation (1994)

This was the companion piece to The Tibetan Book of the Dead: The Great Liberation. I preferred it. First, I am a softy on grading films on Buddhism. This "Way of Life" had no cheesy special effects and used no obvious actors. It looked at the death of an old man in a village in Ladakh, has early footage of the Dalai Lama and a (somewhat) recent interview. Perhaps the best bit was the street interview with local citizens who, unlike most Westerners, are very accepting of death and suffering. Ram Dass and others share their ideas for use of the book in the West. I enjoyed the Tibetan Book of the Dead being read at a Western hospice. Again, a bit basic, but a good introductory piece. The Ladakh scenery, homes, etc. were fascinating when the film plodded along.
