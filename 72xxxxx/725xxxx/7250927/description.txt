This time around we look at one of the craziest 80's action films ever made. It's a cross between 'First Blood', 'The Hunger Games' and 'Contra'. A group of sadistic mercenaries kidnap people off the streets and set them loose on the grounds of their secret camp, so the "students" at the camp can learn how to track down and kill their prey.
