Almost as big as a battleship yet lighter than air, giant airships remain the largest flying objects ever built. From the makers of 'The Battleships', 'The Airships' series reveals the dynamic role these remarkable flying machines played in history, peacetime and war in 3 enthralling episodes. Steeped in the dramas of international political intrigue, it is a saga of extraordinary men and nations in a quest to dominate the skies.

Airships pioneered aerial bombing; made the first around-the-world passenger flight; carried explorers to the North Pole; established the first aerial passenger services between Europe, New York,and South America; and became flying aircraft carriers in the US Navy.

The Hindenburg disaster all but destroyed their credibility. But today, more airships are flying than ever before, designed and built by a new breed of aviation pioneers. Craft designed to rival satellites in the stratosphere, to transport enormous cargoes, and to act as surveillance and communication platforms herald a new age for the air.

Episodes include:
1. Lift off (1890-1922)
2. Ship of dreams (1923-1930)
3. Forced Landing (1931-present and beyond)


==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
===================================
Ps/3 , phone and xbox users may consider grabbing
the free tool umile encoder 3.1.1.2 it can convert
to most devices to make compatible in 8mins
on dual core or higher. as some of my converts may
fail for certain devices.. you will need a pc to run it
though. no link just google it..
