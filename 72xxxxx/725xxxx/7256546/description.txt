This is the game guide that came with the original Fallout game.
It has lots of fun information that can be used to play fallout 1 or 2. Plus post apocalyptic recipes in the back and the standard dark fallout humor. Do enjoy.

This is my first attempt at making a book copy, I used a Dslr camera to take photos of every page, so bare with me all of the pages are a little slanted but its still 100% legible.

Thanks for looking and please let me know what you think of the book.
