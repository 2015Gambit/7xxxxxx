Willie Nelson delivers his first new album, Heroes, as part of his homecoming to Legacy Recordings. No themes or gimmicks to this album, just 13 brand new recordings produced by Buddy Cannon (Academy of Country Music' producer of the year 2006).

Scheduled for release on May 15th, just in time for Willie's 79th birthday, the songs take on a reflective, emotional tone and move from heartfelt (a stunning rendition of Pearl Jam's "Just Breathe") to humor (on "Roll Me Up" with guest vocalist Snoop Dogg). Other guest vocalists on the album include Kris Kristofferson, Merle Haggard, Jamey Johnston, Billy Joe Shaver and Sheryl Crow. Sons Lukas and Micah Nelson also feature prominently, making this a real family affair.

This beautiful album, sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, should have broad appeal among Nelson's core fans and followers and beyond.
