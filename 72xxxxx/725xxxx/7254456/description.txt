Season 1 and 2 of the widely acclaimed children's cartoon, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, in 720p color corrected iTunes rip! No watermark!

Sorry I can't give credit off the top of my head, but you can thank the kindly folks down at!

I'll also upload DVDRs for those interested :) But I don't own Celebration at Canterlot, I don't have $40 (no seriously, go check Amazon right now) sitting around for two freaking episodes. I also don't have the new DVDs that reportedly come with the Lyra and Trixie brushables, but I'll keep my eye out for those. If I find them I promise you rips! But I do have Friendship Express and the wedding one pre-ordered, so rips soon!
