STORY (Moria)

In 1918, Felicien Pascal, a French doctor who is a scientific adviser
on miracles to the Catholic Church, travels to a small village in
Portugal where miracles and appearances of the Virgin Mary have become
so commonplace that they are regarded as a nuisance. There he
befriends Anthony, a manufacturer of artificial limbs for war
veterans, as well as Ellis, an artist with a penchant for burying
people alive who is identical to one of his psychiatric patients. As
he tries to make sense of the miracles, he discovers how Anthony and
his wife Ines have both managed to incarnate inside the body of the
local Marquis.
