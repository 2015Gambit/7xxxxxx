Scotland: The Edge of the Land Series Two

The eastern edge of Scotland - a coastline of great drama, variety and historic resonance. From the towering sandstone cliffs of Orkney and Caithness, down past the fishertowns of the Moray Firth, the long beaches of Kincardine, Angus and Fife, the seascape around Edinburgh all the way to the City of Berwick-on-Tweed, once part of Scotland and now the most northerly outpost of England. This is a shoreline decked out with all the traces of humankind; stone-age burial chambers, Pictish brochs, land fortresses, royal castles, millionaire`s palaces, ancient harbours, North Sea drilling rigs, soaring bridges, medieval churches, gun emplacements and the roar and flare of modern petrochemical plants. The helicopter-mounted cameras of Edge of the Land reveal the unknown - and endlessly surprising - seascape of the east, the other half of Scotland`s enchanted shore.
