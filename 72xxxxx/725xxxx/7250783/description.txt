In October 2009 Bobbys 2nd album hit the market NET VIR JOU (Only for You if translated). This cd has 13 tracks all written by Bobby himself music and lyrics. The production of the cd was done by Coleske Artists (South Africa). It is nice sing-a-long songs, but the lyrics are food for thought. CD sales hit Platinum Status within 8 weeks.

In February 2010, the album NET VIR JOU was nominated for a SAMA Award South African Music Award - a very prestigious award in South Africa in the category BEST AFRIKAANS POP ALBUM.
