Courtney Crumrin #2 [ONI Press]


Courtney Crumrin returns in her first ever, full color series! Welcome to a world where magic and Night Things lurk behind every corner and nothing is as it seems. This is the world introduced to Courtney by her dear Uncle Aloysius - a master mage of unknown age and even more mysterious motivations. What started the Crumrin clan down the dark path, and is Courtney strong enough to follow it all the way down?
