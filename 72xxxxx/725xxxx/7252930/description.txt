His revolutionary program adjusts your body metabolically so that you burn fat day in and day out. The program is structured around four 17 day cycles:

AccelerateΓÇöthe rapid weight loss portion that helps flush sugar and fat storage from your system

Because of the diversity that you are allowed from the very beginning of the program, there is a way to make this diet work with almost any food allergies you might have or what cuisine youΓÇÖre used to eating.
