While in prison, Ryan (guest star Noah Bean) discovers patterns that reveal how Oversight gets its funding. Ryan arranges a meeting with Nikita (Maggie Q) to fill her in, but Amanda (Melinda Clarke) intercepts their coded messages to each other and alerts Oversight, who sends in one of their own to interrogate Ryan. Nikita and Michael (Shane West) scramble to break Ryan out of prison before Oversight gets to him. Meanwhile, Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca) is being tailed by Gogol, and comes face to face with someone from her past.
