[V],psspss,2012-05-10T18:26Z,"beginning and ending only.. I say they made quality so bad
so youtube didnt deleted it under copyright"
,Madz..,2012-05-10T18:38Z,"Thanx, but...
Any chance of getting the full episode in good quality?
Really no point in watching pixelated images of a custom car.. Looses all appreciation purposes."
[V],psspss,2012-05-10T18:41Z,:D
[V],psspss,2012-05-10T18:41Z,nope im not in usa.. I find this from hard looking on the web and converting it from flash
,goodolandy,2012-05-11T00:40Z,"All parts can be watched at: http://watch.spacecast.com/dream-machines/season-1/dream-machines-episode-105-john-cenas-incenarator/#clip675582

I have been trying for the past hour or so to find a browser add-on that will save the videos but so far everyone that I have tried do not seem to see the video as being present.

Maybe someone out there has something that will capture the video and will upload it for the rest of us."
,curtiscyber573,2012-05-11T01:42Z,What is up with no one posting up this show? 
,Madz..,2012-05-11T01:51Z,"@goodolandy:
Try something like flashget that works independently from browser and automatically detects flash videos cache. Or just google ""save flash video"" for more results.
I tried your link but isn't broadcasting atm.. Thanks anyway."
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T02:29Z,"tubedigger is only tool that can rip all sites

I see if I can grab and convert I guess"
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T02:31Z,"i think if you wait a proper hd ver will show though

not good to post urls.. if you have a link pm me on demon is better then its anon

its prob already been banned by the antip2p nobs"
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T03:23Z,ive almost got the full version and the qualitu is very good.. will convert and piece it together and upload soon
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T03:25Z,seems they block based on country ip so get a weird error they too busy :)
,digital69,2012-05-11T03:54Z,know where I can get a good copy of tubedigger?
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T04:21Z,"its updated on a monthly basis so works with sites.. its cheap enough buy a copy and support the guy for his good work :)  it does a web check for licence so hackign it will be a pain each release

hmm I have all parts. but i think the stram cliched while recording in places.. have to check it out more.. becoming a headache this"
,Madz..,2012-05-11T04:33Z,"psspss - Thanks, your work is deeply appreciated.
i'm waiting anxiously for that good quality release :)"
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T04:35Z,"opps made a mistake capturing will have to redo it

going to take a bit longer to upload full one now :/"
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T06:24Z,"now up

,digital69,2012-05-11T16:21Z,"I don't mind buying it but I just want to make sure it works on all the other sites other than utube like 98% of the ones that so call work on everything. hule, amazon, hbo etc..."
[V],psspss,2012-05-12T06:22Z,"can see it worked as i up the rips.. but I had to join and convert to get a final xvid.. using other soft

it always works.. it has 2 modes record as you watch which always works and
dl mode which is like savign the whole file some
streams let you and others send bits only

why I took longer as still learning his soft.
i made a mistake of trying to fast forward while
it was in rec mode..

so waste another 500mb as repeated it

learning curve"
