Dream.Machines.S01E05.LQweb.xvid-][ John Cena - Incenarator (Beginning+End Parts only)][9-May-2012].avi

I found a couple parts of the missing episode and assembled them into
a mini episode.. which covers the intro of the episode and the final
build.. but lacks the middle part of them building it

the quality of it is not good but watchable on laptop.. pixels and
clipped sound.. think the guy camcorder the tv screen as ithe screen sizes are off.. but if you can not wait to watch then heres the clip
until full hd version comes to light

so dont blame me for the quality

I see next weeks is seasson finale.. and they build the
battleship 2012 movie robot shredder (if not seen the movie.. download it
its not a bad movie.. fill of effects)

help to seed if grabbing

enjoy

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
===================================
Ps/3 , phone and xbox users may consider grabbing
the free tool umile encoder 3.1.1.2 it can convert
to most devices to make compatible in 8mins
on dual core or higher. as some of my converts may
fail for certain devices.. you will need a pc to run it
though. no link just google it..
