Lyrics:

Here I am
Feels like the walls are closing in
Once again
It's time to face it and be strong

I wanna do the right thing now
I know it's up to me somehow
I've lost my way

If I could take it all back, I would now
I never meant to let you all down
And now I've got to try
To turn it all around
And figure out how to fix this
I know there's a way, so I promise
I'm gonna clean up the mess I made
Maybe it's not too late
Maybe it's not too late, oh

So I'll take a stand
Even though it's complicated
If I can, I wanna change the way I've made it

I've gotta do the right thing now
I know it's up to me somehow
I'll find my way

If I could take it all back, I would now
I never meant to let you all down
And now I've got to try
To turn it all around
And figure out how to fix this
I know there's a way, so I promise
I'm gonna clean up the mess I made
Maybe it's not too late

I'm gonna find the strength to be
The one that holds it all together
Show you that I'm sorry
But I know that we can make it better

If I could take it all back, I would now
I never meant to let you all down
And now I've got to try
To turn it all around
And figure out how to fix this
I know there's a way, so I promise
I'm gonna clean up the mess I made
(Mess I made)
Maybe it's not too late

I never meant to let you all down
Now I've got to try
To turn it all around
And figure out how to fix this
I know there's a way, so I promise
(Promise)
I'm gonna clean up the mess I made
Maybe it's not too late
Maybe it's not too late
