This is NOT movie but short clips edited and combined into a larger file without all the credits and start bit that takes up about a third of each little clip.

They are also not just clips from existing movies or adds but small separate Tinker Bell clips that Disney makes and puts out on it's site for entertainment.


I located the best copies of each one and trimmed  and combined them into a 17 min long clip, much more entertaining for the little ones. The quality overall is generally quite good but a couple are not great but I doubt the kids will notice.

The 4 minit one is new clips straight from Disney that wern't up there 2 months ago when I did the 17 minit compilation, and there is a clip from the upcoming movie in there.


They are funny clips that are released by:-

You can go there and see some of them.

or see the larger file I posted on youtube


You could just download the larger one from youtube but they reformat it when it's uploaded and there may be some quality loss or not??


Anyway if the little one's like Tink then these will entertain them for a little while.
