Status: New Series
Network: MTV ( USA)

Hosted by comedian Jeff Dye, the series is a new take on the hidden camera show, in the grand tradition of classic series such as ""Candid Camera,"" up to today's revival of MTV's pop culture phenomenon, ""Punk'd."" How far would you go for $1,000? Find out when comedian Jeff Dye snares unwitting contestants off the street to perform interactive impromptu pranks on a variety of unsuspecting victims, in the new series ""Money From Strangers."" MTV, with its legacy for combining comedy with hidden camera hijinks on shows like ""Punk'd,"" will once again have viewers busting their guts with this new take on candid camera prank shows. Jeff, along with a rotating pair of comedians, uses a secret earpiece to communicate to contestants while watching all the action. If contestants can successfully complete the prank they win a $1,000 prize and maybe some lost dignity.
