,Bubbers83,2012-05-10T03:57Z,"i know it's been mentioned before, but plesae stop the repeat uploads when it is clear as day someone already uploaded that week's issue. No need to clutter up the site, It has been going pretty good for a while now.."

,Akercoke,2012-05-10T17:43Z,"bubbers, I can see why that would be a problem but I tried the previous upload and several other titles last night but no matter what they wouldn't come down.  This one seems to be working perfectly for me; infact I started this message straight after clicking the magnet and it's already through, while the other hadn't downloaded after a full night of sleep.

Thanks, mdusanjay :)"
