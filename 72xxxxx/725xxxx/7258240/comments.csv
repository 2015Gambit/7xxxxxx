,anarchist9027,2012-05-10T20:57Z,"^^If you are going to admit that this is your torrent, why upload it anonymously? PWND!!
I also wouldn't doubt that there might be a virus inside until someone comments on it"
,anarchist9027,2012-05-11T04:36Z,"Alright, I do have to say. This is legit and has all XP related patches up till may. Just needs .Net 3.5, 4 and some others. I have v'fed this ISO and Serial in VMWare. Best thing about XP 64 is that there is NO WGA so you can not get blacklisted :)"

I install vista and my PC just rebooting at 3/3 update 0%, do not turn off computer, so I'll install x64 xp, before vista I try with win7 but my pc it's to old and I'm going back to xp. I have try all versions of xp (2011 new look...) but now I'll try x64 :D"
