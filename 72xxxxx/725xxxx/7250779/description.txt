"The Suit on the Set"

Brennan and Booth head out to Los 
Angeles to consult on the production 
of "Bone of Contention," a film 
based on Brennan's latest book and 
the work of the Jeffersonian team. 
While on set, Brennan intervenes 
after finding flaws with the actors' 
performances, not to mention the 
film's total disregard for science. 
Then she discovers that the prop 
cadaver being used is an actual 
murder victim, forcing her and 
Booth to launch an investigation 
that has real-world consequences in 
the land of make-believe. 
Meanwhile, Booth is offered a job 
on the studio lot, and embarrassing 
information is revealed about Cam's 
past.
