Today, while the atmospheric converters causes thunderstorms on the surface of the red planet, a group of terrorists, the Titans Space, takes advantage of the chaos to steal an important manuscript in the Martian capital Museum of Terraforming. 
Lara will do everything she can to recover the precious manuscript through caverns and underground Martian facilities and use the energy from the Shrine of Time to activate the teleporter which will allow her to get back to Earth.

The Shrine of Time is an important complex of tombs and crypts.
A legend says they were built in the future and launched into the past.
Many people talk about effects of lighting and strange apparitions and even monsters they saw inside the funeral network and a mysterious small gold key. We don't known who is buried in those tombs and whether the occupants are human or not. 
To make a long story short, this place is dangerous and for this reason the keys to enter were lost...
