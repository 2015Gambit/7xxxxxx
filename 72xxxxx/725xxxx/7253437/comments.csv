,b92719,2012-05-09T05:25Z,"I get the following when attempting to run the game, even after deleting, re-downloading, and copying it over this several times. 
""The game couldn't start. Try downloading the game again.""
I have no problems with other XBLA titles though. 
Any ideas?"

,XLeech,2012-07-30T20:37Z,"Does it work. And is it able to download.

Is this game really worth playing. For the trailer I just watched I'm wondering why there are so many seeders and so few who comment on this site below. "
,Hawk_Talk,2012-08-04T08:33Z,in god's name i've looked everywhere. How can you play the game from a flash drive. 
,icedavejr,2012-08-17T19:00Z,all of you having such a problem playing this on your jtag or rgh and getting the redownload error make sure your on the latest dashlaunch and that you have xbla patched through it it works great for me
,vaultboypiratebay,2012-08-22T23:29Z,"Works flawlessly! To those saying otherwise: update your fucking console! 
I was on 13604 and it was returing the ""game could not start"" error. Updated to 15574 and it works."
