I mean, look how young adam, grant, and tory look.  on a related note, look how much they aged in just 5 years >_"
,betting,2012-05-08T22:07Z,"Why so many dl on this?

This is from season 5. Right now they are running on season 10.

People don't look on what they dl. If many seeders it must be good :)"

A - 10
V - 5 (at best) 

Plus. as stated earlier.. its an OLD episode.  "
,nike1981,2012-05-15T18:19Z,Yeah? Where is ep 8? please upload it !
,assfacefromhell,2012-05-24T19:06Z,"@nazgull2k10 - Stop being so dramatic. It's a bit blurry but calling it ""hard to watch"" is absurd. I remember watching videos on the internet when the best connection was 56k dialup modem. Now THAT was hard to watch. Don't worry everyone, while the quality isn't crystal clear 1080p HD, it's certainly watchable."
