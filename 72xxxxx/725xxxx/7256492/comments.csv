Great Movie. 
Appreciate the upload EZ. "
,Fritz.,2012-05-10T22:27Z,"excellent audio and video.

not sure why the movie is getting such high reviews. its not bad, but its not really good either. its basically ""payback"" part 2 and Gibson does some really stupid things like shoot his gun sideways with the gangsta lean when hes supposed to be a military sniper..."

,mattydogz,2012-05-15T19:17Z,hay i luv ur suff man and ur the best on this site but this dose messup 4 a few seconds at least once at 37mis 4secs but apart from that its the best copy out THANKS AGAIN 4 THE UPS :)
,clt_lqr,2012-05-17T10:13Z,"@techi602 : it's ""chambacu"" by aurita castillo & su conjunto on the album paradas continuas. if you have a smartphone download the app ""soundhound"" and all you have to do is open the app and put your phone up to the speaker/tv/etc. and it listens and it will tell you all the info about the song and even let you buy it...works great.

now, about the movie, it is driving me nuts bc you can't fucking hear a word they say and then in the action scenes the volume goes up so much it almost blows my speakers. i fucking hate that shit. are there any audio programs to level the sound? i have vlc if there is anything i can do in that program???"
,netrek,2012-05-20T08:17Z,thx! GIBSON IS BACK!
