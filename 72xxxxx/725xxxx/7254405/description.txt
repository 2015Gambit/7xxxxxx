IMDB:
Four teenagers escape to a deserted beach for a weekend of discovery, only to find that their dreams turn into nightmares

I really enjoyed seeing this Australian horror movie many years ago but lost the copy I had. In the end I had to buy the movie from overseas because buying it in Australia was next to impossible. Due to the lack of availability and this being a pretty decent movie I'm now going to share the copy I made for as long as possible.
