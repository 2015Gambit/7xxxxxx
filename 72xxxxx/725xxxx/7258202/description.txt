Portion Control is a British electronic and industrial band from South London. The band calls its music style electropunk or hard rhythmic electronics. They have been name checked by Depeche Mode, Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, Orbital, The Prodigy, and others and copied by many other artists. The band pioneered the use of sampling and used, to great effect, the Apple II computer based Greengate DS3 sampling and sequencing system
