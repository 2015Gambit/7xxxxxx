This is my first torrent, hope you like it.

It's a MultiEmulator for the PS2 with a total of 9196 roms for Atari, Genesis, Master System, Nintendo and Super Nintendo.

I also included the super-useful uLaunchELF in the DVD.
You can use it to backup your Memory Cards to PenDrives, transfer files between them, etc.
The CD version dummy file (~25 MB) is on the DVD root as well.

I believe you need to have a ModChip-ed PS2, or use Swap Magic or something else to get this working.
I have a Matrix Infinity on my PS2 Slim and it works just fine.

Note on the Master System emulator, PSMS:
Before entering this emulator, you need to press circle in order to change to version 1.33!
You also need a Memory Card inserted in your PS2 for it to work!

Note on the Super Nintendo Emulator, SNES Station:
In-game sound is disabled by default. 
To turn it on, enter the options menu in the emulator by pressing triangle in the rom selection screen.
The first option there is a sound toggle.

This work is intended to be completely free!
Credits go to the coders and developers of the ELF files included.
Special credits go to Arcanjo.eb, the first one AFAIK to create a MultiEmulator based on Multiloader.elf.
This MultiEmulator I made is just a much more complete version of his.

Download it, keep seeding it and I hope you enjoy it a lot!
In case of other doubts, feel free to ask me or Google it. :)
