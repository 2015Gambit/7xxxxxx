,joew771,2012-05-20T09:51Z,"Thanks for the upload.
I am not blaming you avianflu, but the first book is completely awful. It has some of the worst writing I have ever come across and I read a lot of books. Like lots. I have nothing against erotica or porn either, this book is just plain bad. Extremely repetitive, boring and silly. It started life as Twilight fan fiction and you can tell. It reads as if it were written by a 13 year old girl with no idea of what sex or love are or what erotica is or what good writing is for that matter. I didn't even bother with the other two.
 Read at your own risk. "

,AvianFlu,2012-05-22T19:18Z,"i don't read 'em, i just seed 'em. not my kind of reading material, but happy to share what i've got."
,dwiss,2012-05-24T05:53Z,"I second what joew771 said.  The writing is atrocious.  The subject matter aside, this reads like it was written by someone with a very poor command of the English language and because of that I found it boring and annoying.

Good writing can make even dull subject matter come to life!"
,ZoPunde,2012-06-01T02:54Z,"joew771 Copied and pasted the same comment on three different 'Fifty Shades of Grey' torrents. You must have a personal vendetta with the author of this book.

What a cocksucker. "
,univ_code,2012-06-02T01:17Z,He's probably afraid that if he reads them his latent homosexual desires will surface again.
,joanmcbitch,2012-06-05T15:59Z,"Hmm, joew771 might be trolling but he has some valid opinions. I read all three & I do feel it started to become really repetitive. It kept me interested enough to finish reading but lost me intellectually. Honestly, it is closer to soccer mom porn than the bizarre limit-pushing erotica people assume it is from its media created legend. "
,joew771,2012-06-09T11:05Z,"I did copy and paste the same comment on different torrents of this book. I don't have a personal vendetta and I'm not gay. This book is just really, really bad. I love books, I read constantly. I know what a good book is (not that I am special or anything), and this book is awful. If this book wasn't so popular and so hyped I would not have said one word about it. I am only trying to warn people who think that they are going to read some sort of masterpiece of erotic literature. They are not. Not even close. There are many books that fit that description. This one doesn't. I recommend (among many others), the books of Henry Miller. You will be far better served, erotically and literature wise with those."
,joew771,2012-06-09T11:48Z,"If anyone wants to read a serious book about sex and sadism and domination and erotica and philosophy that is well written, instead of this piece of crap- 

Look here, though you should be careful and read the warnings.

,vampi11,2012-06-12T22:13Z,Thank you! AWESOME!!
,psychedelesis,2012-06-22T07:01Z,"I seriously made an account on here just to comment on this.

I don't think the writing itself is as bad as a few on here have made it out to be. I've seen worse. What makes the writing bad is the excessive use of words like ""crap"" and long outdated cliches and colloquialisms. I have literally never heard anyone say ""double crap"" or ""my inner goddess""; not even jokingly.

Character interactions made me feel embarrassed on behalf of the main character. She is so awkward and unnatural with EVERYONE. Clearly the author has no social skills and doesn't understand basic human exchanges. I'm awkward. I read books to get away from this. I don't want to experience it while reading a poorly written book.

Then there are the sex scenes. Kind of boring. I think it's supposed to tend towards masochistic but it's just your typical whips-and-chains-let-me-have-my-way-with-you sort of thing. If you want something seriously sadistic, well-written with natural character dialogue I recommend Clive Barker. Women busting their clits open fucking snakes and shit.

On the bright side, this would be a GREAT book to parody, and I'm going to try and plow through the rest of the book because I've got one in the works."

,WallCoop23,2012-06-27T21:04Z,"These are the worst books I've ever read, and I've read Twilight... Let me tell you, this makes the Twilight books look like masterpieces. I've even read fanfiction better than this!
I've read A LOT. I've read thousands of books, and it disturbs me that people like these books so much. Seriously? I can't even process how this is possible. My mind wants to convince me that people are only into them because of the ""erotica"" aspect?
I kept reading, hoping they would get better, hoping that the plot would evolve, hoping that the writing would magically get better...um, they did not. They are simply awful.  

Thanks for the great upload anyway, AvianFlu! :)"

,ZombieCupcake,2012-07-19T13:42Z,"I have to agree that the writing was lacking, it started as fan fiction but it shouldnt have stayed that way once it was going to be published. Other then that i love these books, but if you want erotica that will also stimulate your mind check out the Kushiel's series by Jacqueline Carey those are great and there are around 6 books! Plus her Naamah's series."

Download utorrent (google search it to find where to download it) 
Install utorrent
Click the link ""get this torrent on your desired torrent""
Wait for it to download.

Any more problems jump on youtube, there are HEAPS of walkthroughs regarding downloading torrents. 

Hope that helps."

,joedasan,2012-08-13T22:48Z,"fviera208- 

The best way to download a torrent is to install a program such as Vuze. That's the one I use it works great and it is free. You just go to google and type in fuze free download, then install it. After that you come here and click on the GET THIS TORRENT link and it will automatically start downloading in your Vuze library. Then once the download is complete you just double click fifty shades in your library and it will give you a pdf of the book! Good Luck! "

,MaxKohler,2012-08-29T16:51Z,"omg.... you gotta be shitting me... how the fuck is this book so popular.... DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND BRAIN READING THIS GARBAGE BOOK. There are MUCH better erotica books out there.

The book feels like it was written for and by an immature, young, sheltered little girl. The main female character gets angeringly annoying.. she seems to have the emotional and intelligence level of a 3 year old.

I am absolutely STUNNED that this book is so popular..... wtf is wrong with people?!?!? If you don't believe me go read the amazon reviews for it."

Im listening to What Every Guy Needs to Know About 50 Shades of Gray by Mark Cunningham, so I can better understand this, because this is crazy lol."
