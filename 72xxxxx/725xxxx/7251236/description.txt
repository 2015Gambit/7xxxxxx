While niche theme that push the boundaries of WordPress are great, WordPress's core purpose has always been blogging. With PersonalPress I decided to return to my roots, and create a traditional blog-style theme with a personal touch. PersonalPress is a great design for those looking to give their blog a fun and light hearted feel.
