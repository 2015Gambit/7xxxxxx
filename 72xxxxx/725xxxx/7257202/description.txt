The fox ignites passions like no other predator. Vilified as vermin by some and admired for its pluckiness by others, the fox divides public opinion. This live event, broadcast from the wastelands of LondonΓÇÖs Battersea Power Station, will launch a nationwide campaign to investigate BritainΓÇÖs most controversial carnivore. 

We will be asking viewers from across the country to take part in the biggest urban fox census ever attempted. WeΓÇÖll find out if our cities are being over-run by foxes. Are they becoming increasingly brazen? And are they a danger to our pets and children?
