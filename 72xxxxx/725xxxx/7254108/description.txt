There are certain haunted places where the restless spirits of the night linger. They manifest as eerie voices and strange perfumes; they move things about; they creep out of the shadows as apparitions. Sometimes they even attack. 

These are the places, through years of experiences and unnerving reputation, that are considered the most haunted places in the world.
