,inojackshit,2012-05-07T23:55Z,dumbest movie ever
,paperclipeo,2012-05-08T03:43Z,"There is nothing dumb about this movie, it is a Shakespearean play, if you don't understand it that is on you. The video quality is an 8/10 at least, it is very good but not perfect, and the audio is 8/10 as well. The movie is spectacular. Thanks for this, if only it wasn't 2cd. Thanks though, for now to watch it this will do very nice. "
,FilthyAnimalNL,2012-05-08T12:57Z,"@paperclipeo:
If he thinks it's a dumb movie that's his OPINION.
Stating that this is not a dumb movie because ""it is a shakespearean play"" is dumb.
He also didn't write he didn't understand it, you just assume.
I think you are a little pretentieus (based on what you wrote).

Didn't see it, so I don't know if I like it yet."
,gratefulforthis,2012-05-08T14:23Z,"lol @ FilthyAnimalNL

Oh the irony.

Haven't seen it either! hahahaha"

,spankdaddy,2012-05-08T19:25Z,"Its crazy how people react sometimes on here. I think where it went south with jackshit was he said it was the dumbest movie ever... he never said he found it dumb, he just made a who gives a shit comment... if you dont like a movie who gives a fuck just comment on the quality sheeeeesh, taste changes with each person. Now maybe if you were PAYING???? then a comment like dont waste your time I think its lame might be helpful but its fucken FREE jesus ... but ok Ill come down because im sure jackshit is 14 maybe? hehehehehe damn lets fire some peeps up :)

,Finan82,2012-05-08T20:06Z,Ambiguous trolling comment! 
,japhater,2012-05-08T21:30Z,"@ Spankdaddy.. I have not even signed in to this site in months, let alone comment. But people like you do my fucking head in. NOTHING in this world is free, little shite bags like yourself post that nonsense all the time. It may be a hell of a lot cheaper but its far from fucking free retard. You pay for a internet connection dont you? I wonder what you would have to pay if you were caught illegally downloading???? Cant stand it when people post that shit, could no be more far from the truth. Little cunt "

,Fritz.,2012-05-09T00:03Z,"@japhater ...  i really doubt anyone is paying for their internet connection for the sole purpose of using piratebay. Also downloading is not the illegal part, uploading is... and if you have and sense you would run a free program called peerblock...

if you are going to insult people like they are stupid, you should at least attempt to sound less like a moron yourself."
,kiwibrandon,2012-05-09T01:38Z,"Jesus. How about a comment on the quality of the A/V?

Too much to ask, perhaps?"
,spara666,2012-05-09T04:20Z,A/V??
,spara666,2012-05-09T04:24Z,"@Fritz. Heard bad things about Peerblock, personally i wouldnt touch it. "
,Chased911,2012-05-09T04:30Z,"Any movie with the word ""anus"" in it has to be good."
,japhater,2012-05-09T21:37Z,"@fritz your a fucking mentaly retarded moran LMFAO of course it is illeagal to download. Who said poeple pay for internet for th sole purpose of downloading???

,Diedelmon,2012-05-20T06:18Z,"Can you people please focus on the quality of audio and video and leave the trolling to... I don't know... Facebook? That's where trolls go nowadays. 

Please, head that direction. "
,Diedelmon,2012-05-20T07:21Z,"There is no audio for most scenes, which is really sad. This has DVD quality for video, a 10 in my book I'd say. "

Anything with Ray Fiennes is awesome."
