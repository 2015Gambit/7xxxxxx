Thanks YIFY.

@rkh1977
You can open the .srt file by drag & dropping it in notepad. Delete all dialogue for the English parts and leave only the Spanish. Then save changes in notepad & close. The .srt file will retain those changes and only display subs for Spanish dialogue. If you want, you can post it in ""Opensubtitles or Podnapisi"" for others who want the same thing. Hope that helps."
