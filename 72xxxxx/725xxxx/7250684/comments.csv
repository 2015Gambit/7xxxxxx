,Saki33,2012-05-08T02:38Z,How is this possible? It's 20:36 in US and this episode doesn't even air until 22:00. Has VTV's account been hacked?
,Saki33,2012-05-08T02:40Z,"Never mind. I see other trusted uploaders have it too, so no way all those accounts could be hacked."
,cindy25,2012-05-08T03:08Z,Canada probably has earlier air time
,gboom66,2012-05-08T04:14Z,it's good watched it already
,Saki33,2012-05-08T05:35Z,"It doesn't make sense that an earlier air time in Canada would be the reason. Why not early every week then and not just tonight? I checked CTV's schedule. Airs same time as in US, 10 PM. It does have the CTV logo on it so obviously there was an early feed that was picked up. "
