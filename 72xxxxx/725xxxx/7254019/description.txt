This is a .cbz file of "Comics Made Me Gay", the NSFW comics essay form of a talk/presentation that gay erotic comics writer Dale Lazarov did at the 2012 Toronto Comics Art Festival.  It's got multiple safe and not safe for work images and language so use your best judgment about when and where to read it. It's formatted in tablet-friendly 2048h x 1536w portrait dimensions.

"Comics Made Me Gay" illustrates and explains how and why the comics/sequential art form is uniquely suited for representing both the objective and subjective experience of homoeroticism. It features both panel excerpts and full comics page samples from classic superhero comics, from Tom of Finland gay erotic comics and from contemporary gay and gay erotic illustrators and cartoonists.  

Dale Lazarov is the writer/editor of GOOD SPORTS (drawn by Alessio Slominsky), NIGHTLIFE (drawn by Bastian Jonsson), MANLY (drawn by Amy Colburn), and STICKY (drawn by Steve MacIsaac), collections of gay erotic comics that Gay Vox, among others, have called ΓÇ£the best gay erotica comics everΓÇ¥.
