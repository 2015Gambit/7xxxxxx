I can't seem to figure out what the key number is, could someone please help me??? :("
,nabs_008,2012-05-11T20:49Z,"Serial number I mean... please help! 
The download was pretty good and fast but now I can't seem to find that number! :( the readME file appears to be in Russian or some language similar to Russian :("

,dude_bud,2012-05-17T12:06Z,"mine still says it's in tryout. Is that ok or will it run out after 30 days? PS CS6 changed to ""extended"" after I changed the framework folder"
,anna.z,2012-05-19T05:19Z,thanks thanks thanks!!! it really works!!
,sq01neo,2012-06-11T08:46Z,@dude_bud: same issue here.. still on tryout even after replacing the framework file.. photoshop works.
,EthanKnop,2012-06-13T21:56Z,Worked perfectly for me! Thank you!
,jeff_11,2012-06-14T04:24Z,"So once you mount the disk image you will find a ReadME with Russian at the top and a list of about 45 hosts below. Open your /etc/hosts file with a text editor and add the listed hosts to the file. It will prevent the app from communicating with the authentication servers. Do this and change the framework folder, and everything should be working. Older versions of this software family found on this site provide more thorough documentation of the host blocking process. Cheers."

2) Click Show Package Contents
3) Go to Contents/Resources

,IG1991,2012-09-17T00:30Z,"Worked for me!

For anybody having trouble this is what I did step by step:

Download torrent. 
Turn off Wifi.
Go to Finder.

In Finder double click the blue folder you just downloaded (adobe illustrator cs6 16.0.0 final).

Now double click ""illustrator CS6.dmg"".

A new window will pop up, in this new window double click ""illustrator_16_LS16.dmg).

A small window will pop up saying ""opening illustrator_16_LS16.dmg"".  Let it do its thing.

Once thats done, a new window will pop up and there will be a dark brown box that will have ""Adobe Illustrator"" written next to it. Double click this box.

Another window will open, double click the red ""install"" box.

Wait for the shit to load, then it will open a new window that says ""welcome"". This window will have 2 options: ""install"" and ""try"". Select ""try"".

Agree to the Terms.

Next Select ""install"". Make sure you have English selected as your language!

Let it install itself.

Once it's done installing go to your applications and open ""Adobe Illustrator CS6"". Once its finished opening Quit out of it.

Now open Finder.

Open the blue folder (adobe illustrator CS6 16.0.0 Final).
Now double click the blue folder labeled ""cracked"".
Double click ""Adobe CS6 azr+.zip""
It will unzip and make a folder labeled ""Adobe CS6 azr+ [k]. Double click it.
Inside there will be a folder labeled ""amtlib.framework"" (this is the cracked folder). Now you have to use this cracked ""amtlib.framework"" folder to replace the same folder located in my instructions below.

In Finder go to Applications
Right click on Adobe Illustrator CS6
Now click ""show package contents""
Click the blue folder labeled ""contents""
In the folder labeled ""Frameworks"" there is a folder labeled ""amtlib.framework"". Replace this folder with the cracked ""amtlib.framework"" folder i mentioned earlier. 
And that's what I did.

I didn't do any of the route blocking.

But if you go System Preferences/ Security & Privacy/ click the tab ""firewall"" and unlock the lock (located at the lower left of the window) to make changes. Then click ""Firewall Options"". Click the ""+"" symbol on the left. Now under applications tab select Adobe Illustrator CS6 and click Add.
Once illustrator is added, to the right of it there will be a small up and down arrow. click it. and Click ""block incoming connections"". 
That will keep illustrator from sending info out.

I did the same when i installed Photoshop CS6 and Lightroom 4. (which all work fine) 

Hope This Shit Helps!!!
