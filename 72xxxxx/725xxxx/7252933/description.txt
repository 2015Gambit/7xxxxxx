Narratives:

Greg Feldwick is 23 years old and from Bath. He makes noises as Slugabed. His first releases were on Stuff, Ramp and then Planet Mu but now he is signed to the mothership, Ninja Tune. His music is suffused with a unique mix of humour, next level production, dancefloor smarts and melancholic emotion. ôTime Teamö is his debut album and we think itÆs a belter. The album opens with ôNew Worlds", a heroic trudge across a vast space landscape, followed by the single ôSexö, a place of wildly suggestive synth squelch. He then takes us deeper, delving into the disembodied anime of ôAll This Timeö and on to ôMoonbeam Riderö which combines digital lyncanthropy with a kind of deep funk groove that ought to come with a warning label. Along with the nervous squeals of "Travel Sweets" and the widescreen spangling of ôUnicorn Suplexö this is a record that evokes a very particular, very peculiar, but never less than beautiful worldview. An album highlight is ôMountains Come of The Skyö, which has a wonderful rolling rhythm and uplifting vocal, whilst the synth melody goes stratospheric at the mid-point. ôGrandma Paints Nice,ö distills yet more warmth and emotion from supposedly synthetic sounds, and ôClimbing A Treeö sounds like the slow and wonderful death of a computer clinging on to its last, implanted false memory. Crowning the album, electro jam "Earth Claps" takes you on a field trip to the very core of the earth, melts you down and spits you out of a volcano. Lastly, the mood of dislocated melancholy is pushed almost to a nervous breakdown on the closing track ôItÆs When The Future Falls Plop On Your Headö.

Asked to explain ôTime Team,ö Feldwick responds that ôit's to do with deep feelings about mostly inexpressible things.ö It is indeed an album full of feeling and warmth and humor, a remarkable feat for a record composed mainly on synthesisers and drum machines. You will be hearing a lot more of Slugabed.
