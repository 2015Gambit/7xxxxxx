Why do you think the video should be uploaded in AVI?
I chose MP4 because H264 provides better compression. 
Or would it be better to use the MKV container?

These Masterchef uploads are my first torrent uploads so all advice is welcome.
Enjoy.

,missworld,2012-05-21T21:24Z,Thanks Appen... and btw.. your uploads are fine in mp4.. if somebody wants .avi. then they can convert themselves.. only takes a few mins. Keep up the good work and cheers again
