,Translation_pirate,2012-05-17T15:36Z,"I have more, but not of Voline sadly...
I'm now busy with Wake 12 (see http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5839887/Wake_1-11__amp__Navis_1-5 for the other eleven parts :P)
After that I was planning on translating another album of Soda. After that, Violine is now on my list :P
IÂ´ll keep you informed if another scanlator finishes Violine 4 in the mean time however!"
