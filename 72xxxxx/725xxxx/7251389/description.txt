ePhoto was created for those looking to turn their blog into a photo gallery. While the theme was created with photographers in mind, it can certainly be used to display any type of digital imagery. While the main content of the theme is image based, I have also added the ability to create a separate blog page where normal blog posts can be integrated alongside your photos.
