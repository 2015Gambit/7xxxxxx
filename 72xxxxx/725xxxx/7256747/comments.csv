Thanks for the effort.

But wtf? 4.81 GB? How many innings did this game have? Well, don't tell me, I'll see. ^^

If you'd come across a White Sox game once in a while, maybe you could post it too. That would be great. But if you don't it's no problem, your posted games are great."
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-10T18:35Z,"It's so big because is 720p (wrong labeled 540p). And I'll try to help you with the White Sox. I'm not a MLB fan, so I don't know anything about this game. But if you'll ask once in a while what game you'd like to see I'll help you, my friend."
,Lechuck93,2012-05-10T22:55Z,"Wow, allready White Sox games up.
You sure are fast. But don't stress yourself puttig too many games up. Even one game a day is an incredibly high ratio. I don't know if I can download an watch them all but those I do I'll seed for at least 2 weeks or so, probably longer. Depends on my remaining diskpace. :)"
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-10T23:22Z,You're welcome my friend! Then 1 game/day it is. If I don't forget... :)
