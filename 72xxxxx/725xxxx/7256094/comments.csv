,NJNightmare,2012-05-10T02:39Z,This is the Video one needs with the audio from another source and you would have something pretty damn good.. I wish I had the skills I would do it myself. 
,fearsome,2012-05-10T13:29Z,"Hard to sync this with other releases since this has been censored by the Chinese goverment. 
They need full control it seems. Poor people. 

Anyways the quality is the best so far :D"
,thrac,2012-05-10T22:11Z,What about subtitles in english or other language?
,battuck27,2012-05-11T08:27Z,"Thanks for a nice upload...
A-10, V-10...
but chinese language...
no english subtitle or audio..."
,colorz1,2012-05-11T12:27Z,This release has missing parts to it.Because I tried to sync this with the english release and the english release doesn't have missing parts like this one does so makes it harder to sync it. So far I got half of it done but takes time to perfect it...
