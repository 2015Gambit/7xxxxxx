This includes tracks mainly recorded in 1976 for "Hoodoo", 
an album that Fogerty didn't feel was up to his standards to release. 
To this day it's only been available as a bootleg, which is why 
the audio quality on the FLAC tracks is less than stellar.

Ironically the Mp3 tracks of the singles from other years are 
much better, although all of them are clear.
