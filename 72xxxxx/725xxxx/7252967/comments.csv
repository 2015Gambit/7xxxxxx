Agreed... some parts are very dark, and thus hard to follow. And I didd,t even think about the Alien Language subtitles, good point, it would have been nice to know what they were saying....

A/ 7.5, V/4.5


Look.... I know I'm a NOOB, and that I have't been a 'member' for this post, but I ain't stupid neither... I know enough to NOT comment on the story-line, plot, characters, or the Emmy worthiness of the film itself.

After dl-ing, and watching.... I shoulda waited for the BRrip. :("
