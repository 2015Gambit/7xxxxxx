Numbers tell amazing stories. Every second we record raw data on everything from the calories we eat to the energy we use, from the number of texts we send to the amount of money we make. Using innovative graphics, ""UNITED STATS OF AMERICA"" will crunch all this data and visualize these surprising facts about who we are in a surprising new way. Produced for HISTORY by Left/Right Productions. (Source: The History Channel)
