All this does is automate the process."
,tt54,2012-05-12T05:27Z,"Notice to Master Collection CS6 trial customers

The trial version of Master Collection CS6 does not include Adobe速 Encore速 CS6 and some features of Adobe After Effects速 CS6 that depend on codecs and plug-ins from third parties. If you decide to purchase Master Collection CS6 after the trial period, support for these components, codecs, plug-ins, and presets will automatically be added via a simple update once you enter a valid serial number."
,sgt_schultz,2012-05-13T02:21Z,Is Acrobat crack included or have you just missed it off your list of products above ?
,gerardthe,2012-05-18T22:55Z,"All works perfect with exeption of Encore which ask for a serial.
Any suggestions, will there be a fix?"

,sepp0o,2012-06-13T15:07Z,"Does this allow updating of the CS6 programs? I had a activator for CS5 which allowed for Adobe updates.

Encore and After Effects plugins aren't installed in the trail versions and we need the updates for those to work.."

,marxm,2012-08-31T10:25Z,"I figured out why this wasn't working, at least for me. I could only see the mf.dll file and the .info file in the activator folder. There's a third .exe file that's supposed to be there but Comodo automatically deleted it as a false positive. Turn off your anti-virus, firewall, and anti-malware software and download it again. Worked like a charm :)"
