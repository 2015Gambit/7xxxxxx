eGamer was designed with video game blogs in mind, however, it can certainly be adapted to any niche. This theme contains advanced features, including a custom author review system, video embedding (from video sites such as youtube), thumbnail resizing, and more. eGamer also gives users control over many of the themes functions, making the banner ads, recent reviews section, recent video section, popular/random articles section, and post-page thumbnails optional. You can also choose between the default magazine style layout and a more basic blog style design.
