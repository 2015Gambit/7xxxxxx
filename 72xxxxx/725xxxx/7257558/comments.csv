Thanks!"

,iamnotlouise,2012-05-10T16:56Z,Torrent kept insisting I needed to fill out a survey in order to get password for the torrent.. Not sure if this is the case for anyone else.
,lovecat66,2012-05-10T17:13Z,"THX ! Actually lately many times they are frauding, falsifying eztv and VTV's TV series torrents, so it's useful to confirm originality."
,minastirith,2012-05-11T02:06Z,For me the .rar file is password protected. WTF.
,minastirith,2012-05-11T02:12Z,"Disregard the previous comment. My mistake, I was dumb enough to download a VTV fake yesterday. 

Thank you VTV. Great as always. "

,tomatoobatt,2012-05-11T21:31Z,"oops. sorry, ignore my previous comment :s"
