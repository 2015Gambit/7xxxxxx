I do not condone pirating my game.

But the fact of the matter is that I'd rather have people pirate and play my game than not play it at all. I'm also aware of situations where you have no way of paying for the game.

For me, games are the most important artistic medium worth exploring. Digital games are a culmination of almost every digital medium, and to be a lone developer like myself you need to work on mastering them all. Independently developed digital games, free of any outside financial or creative influence, are leading the exploration of what games can actually be.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that by buying this game, you aren't really paying for a game "product". You're paying into the ideals you share with independent game developers. Every single cent payed for this game will be just put into my next project. I just want to be able to make more games.
