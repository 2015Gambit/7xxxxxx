,jmp1989,2012-05-24T08:35Z,"I am always seeding, even when it doesn't say anything. lol And since this is a magnet torrent, just begin the torrent download, then when it recognizes the files go under the item list of whatever torrent program you're using and choose to only download the FF games and emulators. I choose not to create zip files or other compressed formats cause some people are retarded and don't know how to properly utilize em. lol So whenever it's available, just choose the items you wish to download."
,jmp1989,2012-05-24T08:38Z,"If anyone wishes to contact me personally, just let me know and I'll send a link to be able to contact me."
