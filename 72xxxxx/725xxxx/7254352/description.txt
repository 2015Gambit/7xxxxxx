This is the COMPLETE emulator package, including the newest ePSXe emulator with ALL bios from every region and ALL plugins possible. Every game has been tested and verified working from front to back and every game is either in ISO or BIN format, so there's no need to worry about all these other torrents with "parts" of the games you have to put together. These are all complete and ready to play. Here's the list of games:

Alundra 1, 2
Armored Core
Breath of Fire 3, 4
Colony Wars-Vengence
Crash Bandicoot 1, 2, 3, Bash
Darkstone
Dragon Valor
Final Fantasy 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Chronicles, Origins, Tactics
Gex1, 2, 3
Gran Turismo 2
Legacy of Kain-Soul Reaver
Legend of Dragoon
Namco Museum 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Pac Man World
Spyro 1, 2, 3
Star Ocean-Second Story
Star Wars-Phantom Menace

The only downside: The entire download totals 27.6GB, so it will take a while to download unless everyone SEEDS. You should also be able to take individual parts if necessary, like just the emulator or just a certain game. Be patient. I promise it'll be worth it in the end. :)
