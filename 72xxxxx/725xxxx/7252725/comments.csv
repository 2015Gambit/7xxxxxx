,ahoi1,2012-05-08T17:39Z,Why is it 876MB? The release is 674MB according to rlslog.
[T],Sunblock.,2012-05-08T17:48Z,"rlslog shows packed files size. because they use ""file hosting"" and there for all files are packed.

packed = smaller
unpacked = bigger"

,brutal_product,2012-05-08T22:27Z,"thx HeroMaster!
will seed 1:1"
,Doowangle,2012-05-09T10:03Z,"Works flawlessly, simple instructions. Can't believe such a good game is so small file size. This is like a cross between CIV V and Warcraft. VERY fun!

Thank you HeroMaster! "
,stewman8888,2012-05-09T13:01Z,Can someone pls tell me how to play this game in basic terms once downloaded. 
,Gnob77,2012-05-10T01:11Z,"stewman8888 - There's this CRAZY (little) thing called ""google"", you should really check it out."
,vindicatedxx,2012-05-11T08:01Z,"Anyone have suggestions for why it won't start up? I just get the logo and nothing happens. I did everything in the instructions and I'm not foreign to pirate bay so I already knew what to do, but it isn't working on this one. thanks!"
,ronza149,2012-05-11T18:49Z,"overall not bad game,could be better if they add some good stuff from civ 5,at least they should inform u how to win this game"
,slaneesh,2012-05-11T23:19Z,"Paradox is a good developer, if you like the game and actually pride yourself as one who only pirates to try you should by it"
,fALCONUAE,2012-05-15T15:19Z,this game reminds me of Sid Meier's Civilization V allot

,gendermorph,2012-08-09T13:29Z,"I also got stuck at the logo after installing all the 3 runtime packages (Windows 7 64).
A reboot helped, although the runtime installers didn't mentioned any need for a reboot. Now it runs."
