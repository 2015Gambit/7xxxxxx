,FulciLives,2012-05-18T03:23Z,Thanks for fixing this Gabe. I had downloaded the original torrent only to be stuck at 99.8 percent or some such figure. I deleted the torrent and downloaded this one and pointed it to the same folder and it did that file check thing and then picked up where it had left off and so it only took a few minutes to finish. Glad to have it 100% now. I grew up watching this on TV every Easter and once owned a VHS pre-record but I can't wait to watch it in 720p quality from Blu-Ray so thank you again!
