Birkoff tells Nikita and Michael that a black box file reveals that an international terrorist named Ramon, who has been taking credit for some serious political assassinations, now works for Division. This news upsets Nikita since she was the agent that captured Ramon years ago and turned him over to Percy. Amanda convinces Alex to kill Anton Kochenko, a man who used to work for Alex's father, and plans to let Ramon take the credit for the murder. However, when Nikita disrupts Amanda's plan, Amanda fights back by taking what Nikita loves most.
