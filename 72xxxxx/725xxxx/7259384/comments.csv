but crimson and a couple others normally release a HD version.. so watch out for it 

im sure they will now try to out do this low quality rip ive mine :)"
,TheRealAngelMike,2012-05-10T19:47Z,"you mean trialnerror ?

wel duh you shoul not steal other peoples work, seeingyou just admitted you did...

plus its only been 1 day......"
,doctorhjorth,2012-05-10T22:33Z,sharing is caring
,sweetchuk,2012-05-10T22:50Z,"psspss - you're just a  disrespectful, dependent, borish twat who loves the sound of his own text.

You're a parasite on here and 'Noid and you think people don't know what you do or what you are?
You exist because of other people's work - just a punk ass plagiariser who feels the need to be seen commenting everywhere, yet saying nothing.

What a pathetic joke."
[T],trialNerror,2012-05-10T23:03Z,"had nothing to do with you doing xvids of my mp4s fool. i don't care if you do that cuz you have the right to do that and rename it however you want since you totally re-encoded the video - you were even kind enough to put my name in description... that was all cool, so that wasn't the problem.  it had to do with you always knit-picking every little detail about an upload.  annoying as hell. if i don't upload them then you can't be so damn criticizing about them.

but you are right, i don't plan on doing much p2p anymore.  if you're a follower of my blog you might be able to get a link to download something i've put together.  hey psspss how do you think you got this episode of gh?  i bet you it was from some youtube channel of a user that follows my blog and got that download link.  you can call me a sissy but you know damn well you can't do all you use to do without me.

anybody want the new american guns?  i noticed there aint a dang thang for it out there.  hmm.  i have it.  but nope i'm not gonna make a torrent out of it.  maybe some time later i'll post the download link for it on my blog.

if anything i do ends up as a torrent again it will be under a different label.  not gonna say which label but it is one you have seen for years.  tNe will become ??? ahh I can't say. that will ruin all the fun. "
,sylaurian,2012-05-10T23:07Z,"Thanks for uploading! I have been trying to find this video EVERYWHERE! A bit fuzzy, but otherwise good!

[V],psspss,2012-05-11T00:35Z,"lol you people are a joke.. really

you talk about stealing and claim facts
that are plain wrong.. despite yoiu tag
is always in the description as credit for
source
why should your tags be in names
and why should i give you credit 
when you refuse to do xvids and have
the right to name it how you want so I dont have
to waste my bandwidth and time sharing it instead

ive been providing paranormal shows
even before tne was on the web

and sweetchuk has a no darn right to
complain as admits to downloading many of my collections (even on demon)"
,infiniphonic,2012-05-11T00:36Z,@trialNerror I have always enjoyed your releases. No complaints. Ever. How do i find your blog?
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T00:38Z,"as for knitpicking..

well if we got upset about someone
saying the video was shit quality
(and I always admit it is
when it truely is like this one)

and we decide to quit cos of
so called knitpicking,..

then it be easy job for media defenders
to insult us so we leave
and be no cappers then.. :)"
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T00:45Z,"tne you ego shows 

who cares if someone got it
from your blog etc

for you info your not always the
first to release a show
just look at some on my releases
they arent all from you
as you submitted 6 hours
after one I added a couple of
times

remember every is replacable

you go then someone will replace"
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T01:10Z,"if he posted on a blog or add his url he
be a target for FBI wouldnt
he

hes brave considering whats going on lately
less safe posting to blogs then just adding he
with proxies etc :)"
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T01:12Z,"check out the torrent freak news on
stuff going down

if the main reason hes leaving is
cos of that not cos I asked him
if he about his mp4 have a clicking
sound :) which upset him blah blah"
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T02:27Z,"well got more uploads to do.. had 5 hours sleep
so forgive the typos etc.. i was up to 5a putting this and other shows up as many requesting something

again this is not tne source if it was i would
of uploaded after him.

and ive been uploading many missing shows and episodes from all over the world not just usa for many years on demon

i think we can live without taps now and the other minor shows tne does anyhow.. i put up this lower qual xvid cos of requests
nothing stopping other people finding
converting the missing episodes.. I dont have to do it."
[T],trialNerror,2012-05-11T02:41Z,"ya know for egos lets just agree we can both be egotistical about this shit sometimes. deal? deal. cuz this ep wasn't from me. from what i read for comments on other sites about video quality it can't be from me.

hey it wasn't just that one comment about clicking ""old LP"" sound on dead files. that was just the straw that broke the camel's back. it was all the comments - more like complaints - about mp4 ever since x264 happened. a couple months straight of that is annoying as hell and almost like you were ungrateful even if you did put a simple ""thank you"" (ta) for comment.

but no matter. things are evolving. it's actually a great relief to step away from the p2p stuff.

as for the news articles on torrentfreak. yep. got a feed to them. i'm aware. but the riaa and mpaa aren't going after aired tv shows [knock on wood] i'm not worried about the blog and fbi. there's not that many daily hits. totally under the radar. i have a list of all the members. it's a f2f network. only a few people i know will get something and it won't be available for long unless another member decides to post a dl link for it.

cheers bro it's been fun arguing with you have fun doing what you're doing with p2p"
[T],trialNerror,2012-05-11T02:47Z,"minor shows? pardon me, sir...

ghost hunters, ghost hunters international, ghost adventures, my ghost story, ancient aliens, finding bigfoot, destination truth, dream machines, river monsters, bomb patrol afghanistan, sons of guns, american guns, and some other stuff scene doesn't always get out...

yeah, real minor shows nobody will want to see

hah"
,Charlie117,2012-05-11T02:47Z,"So there will be no 720p version?

:/

I enjoyed your torrents a lot Trial, thanks for everything."
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T03:21Z,"tne either share and stop spamming nonsense to my torrents or just go away ok.. you had your say
already

im here to share content and missing episodes
what are you here for..?"
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T04:38Z,"and tne i always thanked you.. read your comments ta=thanks alot if dont know abbrevs

be a man and keep sharing your content

but if you dont.. im sure scene cappers will or someone else.. they only dont do it im sure as they think you had it covered"
,n00best,2012-05-11T04:44Z,"You sound like a pissed-off, little, spoiled child. Why not have some more respect for yourself and learn to conduct yourself properly? I'm only aware of you because I noticed you spamming other people's comments section..

,tr0under,2012-05-11T07:00Z,"wtf, still no real version of this episode up? trialNerror, you were doing a great job man, I always got your stuff."
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T08:08Z,"im sourcing a hdtv one now.. will have it up
as soon as get it... web is slow"
,ToneZone,2012-05-11T08:52Z,"FK... I always get your vidz tNe.  I'd love to continue getting videos from you.  Your mkv, mp4, whatever format it's posted in is fine with me.  The new wireless BluRays play tons of new formats so I roll with technology.  No complaints except I can't find your videos anymore.  :("
,sweetchuk,2012-05-11T11:02Z,"""and sweetchuk has a no darn right to

LIAR! Name me ONE .. just one torrent (and please provide proof with the hash) of yours I have ever downloaded.
You cannot, because I have NOT. They've either been lesser quality (usually the case as judged from your typical torrent stats) or released later than those I already grab.
I only ever said you have uploaded some ok stuff because a lot of people may not have what you up ... but how the hell does that make me a multiple grabber of your stuff? 

You're completely deluded and self absorbed, and now MULTIPLE people are calling you on that too!

Has your egotistical need to be worshipped sunk so low that you now have to make up stories or make outright lies up?? 

A liar as well as a 2nd rate upper. You're about as believable as Jack the Ripper (no pun intended). 

You'll always play 2nd fiddle to hard working uploaders like tNe - but hey, you bask in your Fool's Paradise believing otherwise - you're the only one on that island chump."
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T11:07Z,"i never had a problem with tne.. he seems to read too much in what I said as always.. someone pass him a chill pill
i dont see why its a big deal to ask if his source lost sync or click etc. as was trying to resolve the problem with the rips and soft.. but whateva

almost got a hdtv ver now.. its a bit 400mb file"
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T11:10Z,"opps big.. thats how tired I am.. been busy sourcing and uploading in recent days.. 

i just try to share the fav shows.. its meant to be a community thing p2p but here i dont know
im almost considering not posting any more stuff on tpb and sticking with demon only again"
,sweetchuk,2012-05-11T11:13Z,""".. im almost considering not posting any more stuff on tpb and sticking with demon only again""

Do everyone a favour and don't threaten it, just do it. Believe me, you won't be missed by many at all.

Thing is, you've been called on the same behaviour at 'Noid! Oh, wait a minute... that's right .. the world according to psspss - ""they're all wrong and I'm right""...

None so blind as those who won't see. Bye bye fool - don't let the gangplank hit your a$$ on the way out."
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T11:16Z,"sweetchuk stop being a idiot

you know you grab hard to get shows
of me.. espc the Canadian and uk ones

most people that followed me
say they have 1tb of stuff all from
my uploads from the years

if you havent been downloading then
you missed out on some great shows
on paranormal indeed (sensing murder
nz came from me and now its all over
the web.. was my first effort and looking
back kinda was sucky but thats the soft
back then)

i think we heard enough from you
now.. go on your way"
,sweetchuk,2012-05-11T11:25Z,""".. you know you grab hard to get shows
of me.. espc the Canadian and uk ones ..

You're a two bit liar and I'm calling you on it. I have NEVER - do you understand what I'm saying here - NEVER downloaded any of your shows!!

As a matter of fact, if you were the sole source of any episode I didn't have, and knowing your attitude like it is evident to anyone looking at your actions on this and other comments (especially other uploaders like tNe's) , I'd happily go without and I mean it.

You are the lowest of the low dude - a LIAR, Thief, 2nd rate upper & self deluded worship wh0re, all rolled into one .. and you are an utter failure at a decent human being."
[V],psspss,2012-05-11T11:31Z,cos i dont use tags you prob didnt know it came from me.. cos many private trackers grab and upload to their servers ... ive been uploading fixed videos and webstreams to xvids for many years now. in fact some added their own tags to my work but never bothers me.. cos im not as you say in to egos and credit and wanting praise nonsense like so many cappers
,TheRealAngelMike,2012-05-11T12:04Z,"Bout the ive been uploading before.

Dunno much about other sites, but here.
On TPB.

It clearly shows TrialnError from 2010 and you 8-2011.

So on TPB, TrialnError was here first...

And thats how I remember it to..."
[V],psspss,2012-05-12T03:43Z,"i said in prev comment.. not here bit on web in general been uploading stuff for many years

I only joined tpb as poeple were uploading my stuff on demon-oid to here so I decide to do it directly"
[V],psspss,2012-05-12T03:49Z,"heres just a few that came from me directly

ghosts on the underground
creepy canada
rescue mediums
sensing murder nz (although some of the last
season some other capper joined in)
haunted australia
decoded (many missing episodes)
scream team
ghost hunt nz
enfield poltergiest collection

heaps more too many to remember
and they are just paranormal stuff
ive uploaded other shows like battle castle

thats just a few.. I have over tb shared on demon if never heard or been following me
then you missed out on some good stuff
but you may of gotten it else where
indirectly"
