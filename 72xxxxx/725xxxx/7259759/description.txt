All credit goes to the original ripper of this

This is a Western Series  parts narrated by Kris Kristofferson

Each episode revolves around a revolver that changes the lives of the person who receives it.

I would relate it to Night Gallery or Twilight Zone maybe.

2 seasons in all will upload each season in 2 parts
  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140735/  is totally wrong on this
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Man%27s_Gun  has it right for the discs episodes

Use Review:

A dark and depressing Western repertory series centred around what appears to be a beautiful S&W Russian (or Schofield) single action revolver, probably .44 Russian calibre. This in itself makes it worth watching at least once to see a Western featuring something other than the ubiquitous 1873 Colt Single Action Army revolver. "Dead Man's Gun" comes off as something bred from old 1950s Western morality series, Richard Boone's repertory series and a large chunk of "Twilight Zone" or "Outer Limits". Several episodes have a twist at the end with a sting in the tail. Strong stars such as John Ritter,John Glover and producer Henry Winkler turn in fine performances, but maybe the handgun is the real star. The cynical and often sardonic look at human nature may well be accurate but can get one down after a few episodes.
