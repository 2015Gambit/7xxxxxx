Amar Chitra Katha- Abhimanyu (ACK DVD 008)

"The Kurukshetra war spanned eighteen days of battle between warring cousins, the Pandavs and the Kauravs. One of the most heroic story is of Abhimanyu, the young son of the brave Pandav warrior Arjun and Subhadra, Krishna's sister. Even when he was a young child, he was asked by his mother to set right the great wrong done on the the Pandavs, by their cousins, the Kauravs. In the fateful war, Abhimanyu broke through the dangerous battle formation created by the Kaurav guru Dronacharya and single-handedly went to fight the mighty Kaurav army.".
