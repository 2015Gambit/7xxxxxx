My mod file of Call of duty - World at War custom Zombie maps.


Select the files you want if you dont want all and add them to your own mods folder.


Start - Your user folder - appdata (**) - Local - Activision - CoDWaW - mods



** = if you cant see your appdata folder you need to be iin your user folder and press, ALT which opens another taskbar - select OPTIONS - then - FOLDER OPTIONS and tick in the second tab SHOW HIDDEN FILES, FOLDERSS etc.

You will see Appdata now.



ALSO, if you DONT SEE A MODS FOLDER, just create one called 'mods' and place the files in there.

Dont rename any of the folders or it wont work.

After that, ENJOY!!
