Hi,

While compiling, i need something to think about. Can be anything. A feeling, a recollection, a person. This time it was PR. Obama. And something strange happened. I realized I created a way to reach this guy. I have a plan and he must hear it. But this can only be told when asked for it. Someone has to wake up. With music I can wake him. But I need your help spreading the list so that this sound-massage reaches him. Music tells a lot. If he hears (feels) the same honesty, I do, he will come up with the right question.

Maybe a strange thought, but is it? Say our future depends on it. You may start laughing. But letΓÇÖs just say. Would you then download these magnificent playlist, prepared with the most care, my most loved VHQ tracks, Sweet and classy and spread this sound-message. If we believe, it will be done. Yes we (still) can.

I only have to let go,

Enjoy, Dutch Treat.
