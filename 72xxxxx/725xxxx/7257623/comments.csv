,ImSoJaded,2012-05-10T20:29Z,"Okay, here you go:
I'm stuck at 10.4 percent with 72 seeders (0) connected and 234 peers. Initial seed should be much longer."
,ashweeter,2012-05-11T04:52Z,"Thanks for commenting ImSoJaded. I tried seeding it initially, and no matter what I tried I couldn't get it to work. I created the torrent, uploaded it to TPB, and couldn't get it to seed. Any suggestions?"
,ashweeter,2012-05-11T05:33Z,"Finally got it seeding properly. It's good to go now :) Please seed everyone, that way this torrent stays around. It's hard to find textbooks as is."

Torrent: Slow start but it went well.

Content: Good - appreciated.

Seeding."
,ashweeter,2012-05-11T17:21Z,"Thanks madcap12! Like I said, I think the problem was I was having a really hard time getting it to initially seed. But we should be good now :) Thanks for commenting."
,warfusion,2012-08-03T01:42Z,thanks man I needed this for school to put on my kindle i don't like to carry textbooks with me when i go to work so this helps a lot. its not easy to find ebooks as you know.
,ashweeter,2012-08-18T15:20Z,"No prob :) and yes, I know how much it sucks having to lug HUGE textbooks around with you everywhere you go... it is definitely hard to find ebooks nowadays. Thought I could contribute somehow, and someone would get some use out of it :)"
