This is a copy and paste from your lasted upload but still holds true. We could use you as a seeder on your Mafia 2 upload ""http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7253218/Mafia_II-SKIDROW__Updates__All_DLCs__And_Fixes"" We got about 500 leechers with probably 400 of us stuck at 70.2% for at least over a week and only a few seeders that dont seem to be seeding and it seems alot of people want that torrent thanks much appreciated"
,thejackal98,2012-06-07T19:11Z,Needs Seeders NOW I'm stuck at 70.4% and I'm anxious as a jack russel to play this NEEDS THE SEEDERS
,Koinzeel,2012-06-09T14:44Z,"i have 99,8 % and download was stop ;/"
,crystalfrog,2012-06-11T04:30Z,what i want to know is does it actually works? 
,waging_war,2012-06-12T08:15Z,Took 6 hrs to DL and it was all for nothing. Installed the game fine but my anti-virus removed all the updates because they're 'unsafe'. My computer doesn't seem to like this game and Knights of the Old Republic for some reason.
,SpaceCadet6969754,2012-06-14T01:52Z,"""Copy DLC Packes in DLC Folder""
To where? 
There is no DLC folder in game install directory!"
,SpaceCadet6969754,2012-06-14T02:53Z,"Do not download it does not work it has retarded instructions from a fuckwit, half of the things he tells you to do you are doing the same thing 3-4 times.Don't waste your time."
,ChromeZX,2012-06-23T16:38Z,"Well..erm..all the files are here but instructions on where they go are vague!  Uploader: How hard is it to write out detailed instructions?

Anyways, I'll keep the torrent on my computer until one of the good people of the pirate bay can provide instructions better than the uploaders."
,humdidum00,2012-07-02T18:38Z,"Come on guys, you're complaining about the uploader  being stupid, but none of you actually managed to look inside the folders and see where it matches in the game install directory?

Instructions : 

1. Install by mounting ISO ( poweriso or daemon tools ) 

2. Install updates 1 - 5 ( I copied the crack over every time just in case )

3. copy the content of the dlc folders ( for example Jimmys Vendatta folder includes ""Edit"" ""pc"" and ""launcher.exe"" copy these to inside the ""Mafia II"" folder. ) Simply look at the content inside the folders and look which folders it matches in the mafia 2 directory. 

4.  Copy the Update 5 crack to your ""Mafia II"" folder.

5. Done! 

If your screen goes black right after you set the brightness. simply alt + tab, and alt + tab in to the game again."
,Resilience777,2012-07-07T02:20Z,"Why did this guy try to sneak a Nirvana album in here? To inadvertently get us to listen to his favorite music? Lol whatever bro, the album's been out for 20 some years now, I'm sure countless people have already listened to it.

A badass game though, thanks alot for sharing it and the expansions."
,jerefms,2012-07-25T19:37Z,is working
,Alexandros1011,2012-07-27T14:11Z,Where is the dlc folder?
,V8_Man,2012-07-29T01:53Z,If you Follow what humdidum00 explains and you still can't get it either your computer sucks or you do... P.S. I only copied crack 4 and 5 and all works great
,alres3,2012-08-02T22:57Z,Ok could someone tell me all of the instructions on how to get all the dlc's working and the game because i'm new at this. 
,Gaminggloves,2012-08-06T00:45Z,"Everything works fine, thanks : )"
,beso140,2012-08-29T19:49Z,100% works
,Gatian,2012-09-01T17:46Z,Ok so i followed humdidum00's instructions but i can't get joes adventure setup to run.
,Gatian,2012-09-01T17:50Z,nvm it just took about ten minutes to run it
