Welcome to Tag Team Tuesdays. Totally non-scripted, all in front of a live audience, all broadcast live to members. Today's update is RD 2 of 4. 

 

Tension are high going into the 2nd round. Team Purple is in the lead with a score of 313 to 275. Both teams are determined to win, but only one team can come out on top! This is an extremely close match-up that you don't want to miss! Brutal submission holds, style point, and sexual lesbian wrestling at it's finest!!!!
