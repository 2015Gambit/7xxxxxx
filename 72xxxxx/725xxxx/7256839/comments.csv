,ben7530,2012-05-11T21:24Z,"@ SpoonWielder: You gotta seed your own stuff, man! This torrent took off like a rocket, and now everyone is stuck at 59%.

Please Seed!
Someone!"
,Skemer051,2012-05-12T03:57Z,Seriously someone seed!!!!!
,ben7530,2012-05-12T17:09Z,"SPOON WIELDER: The universe wants you to seed your torrent. I see that you hopped back on at some point, because now we're all stuck at 60.2 percent, as opposed to 59.1

That's progress, but:

YOU HAVE TO LET *AT LEAST* ONE OTHER PERSON REACH 100% FOR PEOPLE TO SEE AND APPRECIATE YOUR WORK!

That's how torrents function."
,Douglas777,2012-05-12T20:20Z,Come on guy seed your own torrent! I want to get further than 60.3%  :/
,SpoonWielder,2012-05-13T19:32Z,"I appreciate all the interest, however I'm not at home for the weekend. It's Mother's Day. I'm visiting my parents. That is why I have not been seeding. Seeding will continue when I get back. Again I appreciate everyone's interest, but I ask please be patient, and please respect that I have a life outside the internet. By the end of the week this won't matter anyway, someone else will have the full file and downloading will go much faster."
,ben7530,2012-05-13T21:32Z,"@ SpoonWielder: I have much respect for RL; tell your Mom ""Happy MD!"" from me, but if you would have simply left your comp. on overnight seeding (one time!), from the 10th, someone else would have finished by Saturday morning, and we would all be watching your awesomeness.

I dunno; simply seeding a BIT longer would have really enhanced today for a lot of people, like me, who took their moms to go and see the Avengers today. 

Keep up the good work editing, *I'm sure I will love the end result*, but the timing of the seeding: what a naughty tease! 

P.S. By the end of the week?!!? Good lord man; you seem to seed quite quickly: leave it to seed overnight one time ASAP, please! Don't make us wait till the end of the week to enjoy your work!

,nextcut,2012-05-14T00:51Z,"I was happy to see this edit - I guess I wasn't the only one - just spent several days in Final Cut Pro creating my own ultimate edit - you can find my cut here - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7267799/Avengers_-_Phase_One_(Chronological_Edit)_(720p) 

I watched this last night and am very impressed with how fast this edit goes by - still feels like a 2 hour movie even at 5 hours, 45 minutes :) - check it out - seeding until it is out there :) "
,chuckufarley,2012-05-19T21:56Z,"Video: AVC (High@L5.1), 1920x1080, 29.97p
Audio: AAC LC, 2 channel, 44.1khz

Borders are still uncropped, the video is still jittery (although no longer interlaced).  Sometimes it is 29.97p with 1 in 5 frames a duplicate, sometimes 2 in 5 frames are a duplicate(?)

No additional total bitrate is used over the 480p version, although the audio is now 44khz (instead of 48khz) with a lower bitrate.

More macroblocking, but an improvement in detail and aspect ratio accuracy.

Modify your excitement accordingly.

Thanks for the effort SpoonWielder, but I'll stick with the 480p version."
,lljb3,2012-07-17T07:15Z,"I am downloading this version regardless of the video jitter render. Reason being is that I'm playing this off my VLC player and certain scenes not properly rendered caused the videos to glitch and freeze up during playback. The HD version doesn't.

Plus I like the fact you inserted scenes back that should have been inserted in again, like Thor and Loki's storytime with Odin.

Also, check this:
http://marvel.com/news/story/18766/view_the_full_marvel_cinematic_universe_timeline

I linked this because I felt the last film should have ended with Cap's scene. Classic closing comic book style line and big time because Cap's awakening happens right before The Avengers starts. And that film happens a full year after anything Iron Man 2 according to the fact that Tony most likely had time to build a full tower in New York and officially switch the company over to a new business model.

But I see why you did that there so you can lead straight into your credits."
,SpoonWielder,2012-07-18T02:48Z,Yeah this was edited before the official timeline came out. But thanks for the reference. This is the timeline I use; http://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/5395/A-Marvel-Cinematic-Universe-Timeline/#!date=0774-07-21_06:12:44!
