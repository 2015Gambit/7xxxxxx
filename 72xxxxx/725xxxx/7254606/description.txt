 This is the old four volume version from Princeton , that I tried to seed before.
 William Smith's work is far beyond any Dictionary of the Bible you can find.

Giving you accurate information on History of people, animals places, customs of the time, all the Flora and fauna.

Its a great Bible Dictionary, and it will help you in your studies into the Bible. 
This is for the serious Bible student.  I added a Modern PDF version of the Dictionary for reference .

 3 good PDF readers are,     Sumatra PDF , Foxit Reader , and KooBits 4.0 .

There is sort a a big file, and it takes time to load the pages. 



Enjoy I will be seeding, this is public domain material and the copyright expired a long time age.  So please keep seeding, so others have a chance to own this as well. 


I will be uploading one for file containing other , old versions of this Dictionary as well
