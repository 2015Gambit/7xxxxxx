,icknchicken,2012-05-09T22:07Z,Don't bother uploding this.  The song bit rate is 54 or less. It's like listening threw a tin can on a string.

How about a thank you instead of complaining?  It clearly says VBR.... Variable bitrate.

You can not expect a bootleg to be 'remastered' and encoded @320kbps.

I'm so sorry but I already 'uploaded' it... I guess you shouldn't have 'downloaded' it....

....and just how far did you manage to 'throw' that 'tin can and string'? :)
