,evilg0d,2012-07-07T12:40Z,"Thanks for sharing this. I truly appreciate your work, I particularly love the quality to file-size ratio but I am curious as to why the volume on your rips is so low. Not bitching, just curious. Every time I watch one of your rips and forget about the volume I then blast myself out of the room when I go back to normal TV. Usually gives me a laugh anyway."
,inthejzone,2012-07-24T12:56Z,"can u upload ""cabin in the woods""? thanks..."
