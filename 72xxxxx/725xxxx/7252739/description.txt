Rocky Babb goes missing after breaking into lawyer Frank Rabe's desolate Forrest home with his girl-friend Gilda Darner, who escaped and urges the PPD to investigate. Nick believes her and Grimm-senses Frank's adolescent son Barry can change into a bear. Eddie Monroe Blutbad accepts grudgingly to guard aunt Marie Kessler in hospital while Nick and Hank check out Barry and his motorbike buddies, Jason and T.B. Colbert, who kidnapped Rocky for a grim sunset initiation hunt.
