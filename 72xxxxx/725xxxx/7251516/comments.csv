@ Auge .... ( I'll try to be brief, LOL ) ....

Sorry to say ....  I could see that 5-6 computers ( during your Upload-seed here ) took a lot of 
seed-material directly from you, WITHOUT FILESHARING IT OVER TO OTHER COMPUTERS ....
( ... or very, very, very slow .... those bastards ) ....

When i looked at the ""availability-numbers"" during your upload-seed ( i'm using client uTorrent ), i could 
see that more than 50 percent of your Upload-seed were almost ""confiscated"" by these bastards ....

.... Meaning that you have to Upload-seed probably twice as long as you should have, 
just because of this really bad behaviour from 5-6 computers .... ( Not your fault ) !

These ""bastards"" really have a strange way to saying thanks to the uploader .... !

=====================================

There are two great work-arounds against these kind of ""trouble-makers"" .... :

1)  ( The hard way ) .... IP-Block them out from connection to your computer .... !

2)  ( The smart way .... really the best solution ) .... Using the ""Initial Upload / Super-seed"" .... !

In client uTorrent .... right-click ( or double-click ) on the uploaded torrent in your client, and go to ""properties"".
Go down to ""Other Settings"" .... and choose : .... ""Initial Seeding"".

=====================================

IF you also lower your ""block-size"" from 8 MB / per block ( Which is very big ) 
down to size 1 - 2 MB / per block, you should gain a lot from that, too .... !

=====================================

You decide !
You're doing a Great Job !
/ Thanks a lot for Linda Darnell here ....

Thank you, I will try out your suggestions."
[T],Auge,2012-05-11T07:58Z,"Agentbay,
I have two other DVDs with Linda Darnell:
Fallen Angel (1945) & Unfaithfully Yours (1948)
Let me know if you want them."
,Agentbay,2012-05-11T16:44Z,"@ Auge.

Fallen Angel / Unfaithfully Yours are both in my Darnell - Collection, 
but thanks for asking. I have a thing for Linda Darnell, Gene Tierney, 
Joanne Dru, Frances Farmer, Olivia De Havilland, etc ... etc ... etc ...
( I think i need help .... Probably too late .... LOL ).

Short note about ""Initial Seeding"" :  The uploader can always go ""back and forth"" between 
""Initial seed"" and normal seed ( it just takes a couple of seconds to go to ""properties"" and
check or uncheck the Initial seed, and then click Okay ) .... Limited bandwidth will love it .... 
.... Downloaders who dont want to fileshare to others will hate it .... 

... but at the end of the day ... its always the Uploader who decide.
/ Have a nice Weekend.
