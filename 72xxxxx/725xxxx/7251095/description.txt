2 Broke Girls (stylized as 2 BROKE GIRL$) is an American television sitcom that debuted on CBS during the 2011ΓÇô12 television season.

Set in the Williamsburg neighborhood of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the series chronicles the lives of two waitresses in their mid twentiesΓÇöMax (Kat Dennings), who comes from a poor working-class family, and Caroline (Beth Behrs), who was born rich but is now disgraced and penniless due to her father, Martin Channing, getting caught operating a Bernard Madoff-esque Ponzi schemeΓÇöworking together at a Brooklyn restaurant. The two become friends and build toward their dream of one day opening a cupcake shop. Among those working with them at the restaurant are their boss, Han Lee (Matthew Moy); Oleg (Jonathan Kite), an upbeat but perverted Ukrainian cook; and Earl (Garrett Morris), a 75-year-old African-American cashier. Also featured starting late in the first season is their neighbor and part time boss Sophie (Jennifer Coolidge), a Polish immigrant who runs the cleaning company Sophie's Choice. During most of the first season Max was also a part-time nanny for the twin babies of Peach Landis. At the start of each episode Max is shown serving a table and at the end of each episode, a tally shows how much they have made toward their goal of $250,000 needed to open their business.
