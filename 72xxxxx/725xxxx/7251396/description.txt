eVid is a theme designed for video bloggers. I have set it up to easily integrate videos from video hosts such as Youtube, Vimeo, Veoh, MetaCafe, and so on. This theme does not have a native video player, but it does include a custom video interface with added "blogger-related" functions. This theme is only for sites that plan to showcase videos within their post pages. I have test the theme with all the most popular video hosts, but I expect that it will work with any website that offers a flash embed code.
