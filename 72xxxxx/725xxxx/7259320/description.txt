In 1911, as a prelude to Captain Scott's ill-fated expedition to the South Pole, three men set off in the darkness of the Antarctic winter from Scott's over-wintering hut, to secure examples of the eggs of the Emperor Penguin. With temperatures of minus 60 or 70; hurricanes stuffed with snow, and a lack of fuel to thaw the food, their survival can only be described as astonishing courage and, in the end, willpower.
