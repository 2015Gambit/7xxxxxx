Excellent quality. Four thumbs up."

It is, however, the BEST 720p version of Episode 6 out there by far.  In fact, these 720p EbP releases are the best for all of Season 2 in general.

So thanks very much to the uploader, and fuck off HBO - let me pay for HBO Go without cable/satellite TV and I won't have to resort to infringing upon your copyright!"
