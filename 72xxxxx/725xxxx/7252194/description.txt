Prager 20120507   2 Biden Endorses Love

Prager H2 Vice President Biden comes out for same sex marriage. It’s just about love for the VP. 
 The only person who doesn’t endorse same-sex marriage in the Democratic Party is the President. 
 He’s the last Mohican… Dennis returns to Europe’s addiction to socialism.


Prager 20120507   1 Austerity, non!

Prager H1  Sarkozy est finis. Long live the socialists! The new French President plans to tax all millionaires at 75%.
 Corporations won’t fare any better. Since he promises to balance the budget in five years, 
 he should pray that they (the millionaires and corporations) decide to stick around. 
 But this is all an unsustainable fantasy. Reality will intrude and probably soon.
