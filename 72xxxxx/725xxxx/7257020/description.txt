In 2002 and 2003 Peter Gabriel went on the road with his "Growing Up" tour, 
collaborating with Robert Lepage, performing in 32 cities across the USA,
Canada en Europe.
This film was recorded over two nights at the Filoforum, Milan, in May 2003.

I stripped all extra's from the original DVD-9 and ended up with a DVD-5 disc.
