	This is the same thing as:
	MythBusters.S04E22.More.Myths.Revisited.720p.HDTV.x264-MiNDTHEGAP
	
	Dates in tv-listing fooled us into thinking this was from
	S04 and episode title was the same. Instead of just dirfixing
	and add on to the confusion of the mythmess we just release
	the same content with the proper name and grp.req the old one.
	But if you already leeched the old there is no use downloading
	it again unless you want to archive it.
	
	INFO:
	
	MINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all
	the gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing
	of unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the
	show is really old and the hope of finding the original
	release is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. 
	
	This of course makes our releases a bit random and some
	might think we are mad but there will be a reason behind
	the madness.
