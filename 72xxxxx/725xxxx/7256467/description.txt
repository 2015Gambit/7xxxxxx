   Are you young, sexually confused, just trying to get by? Do you 
   sing, dance or possess some other talent? Welcome to the world  
   of Garden Party. At the center of the story is 15-year-old      
   April (Willa Holland). She is running from one bad situation    
   into another, hoping to find an answer that doesn't involve     
   taking off her clothes. As April navigates Los Angeles, she     
   falls in with a group of confused kids struggling to chase      
   their drea,s. The black widow at the center of this web is a    
   sexy, pot-dealing realtor named Sally St. Clair.
