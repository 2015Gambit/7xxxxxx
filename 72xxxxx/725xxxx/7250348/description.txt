This radio show, hosted by David Mitchell, sees four players giving a lecture on a subject
The majority of their speech consisting of fabricated lies. 
However, each contestant must attempt to smuggle five strange-but-true facts past the rest of the panel, 
hoping that no-one will notice what they have said is the unbelievable truth


www.comedy.org.uk Review: 
An entertaining series created by two of the people behind long-running BBC Radio 4 panel game I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, specifically ISIHAC panellist Graeme Garden and producer Jon Naismith.

The show contains great moments from host Mitchell - well known for his talent in the panel show genre - plus has the added bonus of being educational as well as entertaining. However, it should be noted that some criticism has been levelled at the show for its 'over-reliance on scripted material'.

However, it still looks like The Unbelievable Truth has the potential to join the ranks of the likes of Just A Minute and I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue as one of Radio 4's long-running popular panel game formats.
