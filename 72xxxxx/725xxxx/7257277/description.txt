Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday, May 9 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Douglas J. Hagmann, founder and director of the Northeast Intelligence Network. He is also the CEO of a private investigative agency serving a roster of Fortune 500 clients. Due to his expertise in covert surveillance and counter-terrorism, Mr. Hagmann has been used as an operational asset by the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI, as well as the Pennsylvania and New York State Police agencies. Earlier this month, Doug said high-level, reliable sources told him the Department of Homeland Security is preparing for ΓÇ£massive civil warΓÇ¥ in America as a result of a collapse of the dollar and the hyperinflation that will result. 

Alex also continues his coverage of the Army's re-education camps and the upcoming Bilderberg confab in Virginia.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
