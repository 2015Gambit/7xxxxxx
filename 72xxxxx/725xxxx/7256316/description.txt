Chemistry, Second Edition, by Julia Burdge has been created to bridge the gap in the McGraw-Hill general chemistry offerings. This textbook offers a clear writing style written with the students in mind. Julia uses her background of teaching hundreds of general chemistry students per year and creates content to offer more detailed explanation on areas where she knows they have problems. 
Sitting down with the art house, Julia Burdge worked with the artist to create the style and major art pieces in her text. Out of these discussions, came the creation of the Visualizing Art two-page spreads which detail a process for the students and provide them with the answer to "What is the Point?" Due the success of the art with students, this offering has been doubled in the second edition. 

With outstanding art, a consistent problem-solving approach, interesting applications woven throughout the chapters, and a wide range of end-of-chapter problems, this is a great second edition text.
