We Will Never Stop ΓÇô new singel release on Monday May 7th

ItΓÇÖs the first single from our upcoming album and weΓÇÖre back with just the tough, passionate afrobeat as you can hear on our sweaty and funky concerts.
The music is a result of that we locked our selves up in a cottage on the beautiful Swedish west coast, and recorded a follow up to our self-titled debut album.

What you will hear is the Nordic response to the brash message and sound of NigeriaΓÇÖs Fela Kuti. On ΓÇ¥We Will Never StopΓÇ¥ we rip through this rousing anthem, offering a blisteringly funky alternative to the mainstream.

So friends, only two days left!!!
