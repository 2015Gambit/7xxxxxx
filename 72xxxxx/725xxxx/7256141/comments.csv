,hoosierdaddy522,2012-05-09T19:25Z,Thanks 4 this re-sized set. Words can't express what I feel about the mnova situation. I just hope you can find somewhere you can continue posting without being censored or banned.
,Who-He-iZ,2012-05-09T21:38Z,Thx 'daddy' for your support. I'm not the kind who gives up easily. I'll be working on it.
,slowquin,2012-05-10T11:27Z,"WHZ damn I read your rant, what the fuck are they thinking  providing links to pthc torrents....sounds like interpol needs to investigate"
,hotjoke,2012-05-10T12:42Z,"There are alot of preteen video links on Mnova -for example the showstars videos- and nobody deleted these links or the users who uploded these links
So why did they delete your account and didn't delete these links???????? "
,Who-He-iZ,2012-05-10T22:22Z,"@ slowquin. To prove my statement, if any user thinks that i'm just a liar, i tell you what i and everybody can see on their page. Go to :
http://www.mnova.eu/subcat.php?id=157
Then just scroll to the bottom of the page. There you can see some tags that you can click. Look for yourself, pthc is there as a clickable link !! Now clicking on that link gives a list of Usenet stuff with the word pthc. Now, they may not be really pthc at all, but that's not the point, they are sponsored links... meaning that MNOVA.EU is making MONEY with their pthc-links - that's really too much and should be investigated at once by authorities !"
