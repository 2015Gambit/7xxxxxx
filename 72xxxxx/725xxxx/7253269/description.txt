Missionary Conquest, The Gospel and Native American Cultural Genocide by George E. Tinker

"With incisiveness and honesty, the work of four
proselytizing missionaries and their drive to convert
American Indians to Christianity are convincing!)┬½
linked with Euroamerican political and militaty
strategy. The result: a continuing genocide, unmatched
in historical literature, a brutal fantasy confounded
by contradictions. With unmistakable indignation
and a keen awareness of contemporary politics,
Tinker reminds us that these myths have held sway for
so long that we - Indians and non-Indians - must
now open our eyes and refuse to participate in the
marginalization and threats to American Indians and
iheir diverse ways of life."
