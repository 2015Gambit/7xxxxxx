Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On this Monday, May 7 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers more startling information on the U.S. Army's manual that describes how "political activists," including American citizens, are to be indoctrinated in re-education camps and also includes rules on forced labor and separating political prisoners by confining them in isolation. 

Alex covers the elections in France and Greece that appear to be opposed to the banksters, their bailout and draconian austerity plans. 

Alex also talks with Dr. Katherine Albrecht, an expert in the area of privacy and technology. She is the founder of Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering and hosts "The Dr. Katherine Albrecht show" on the GCN Radio network.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
