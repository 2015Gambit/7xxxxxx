,fankoosh,2012-05-10T15:39Z,"here some info , u need the both disk to play the game , the minimum kernal required is DB 14719 , so game will need DB update if u havnt done it yet , u better update DB from USB , if u have LT+2 & old DB & ur console is always been offline , u can do the update from usb & second thinf is to patch ISO file from LT+3 to LT+2 iso (remove topology data) then burn after patching , this patch is available everywhere just read & do it , goodluck "
,Prodagee,2012-05-10T15:50Z,There is no reason why u shouldn't be on the latest dash with the newest cfw. It is live safe (well as safe as possible) online reason u shouldn't have lt 3.0 ie because u have a old hitachi drive or a newer drive in which it's not available.

[V],boobsman,2012-05-10T21:35Z,"@ khuman please read my previous comments! This game does work 100%. You need to patch with abgx360 as the master topology files don't work with this game! Download the latest version of abgx and use it to patch topology, then burn as you normally do with xgd3. Sniper V2 is NOT xgd3 and does not need to be patched, please do not cry fake when it is you that are in the wrong due to lack of knowledge!"

I trust boobsman becouse 80% games i have is his isos. Now i have new dashboard and none of my ''verbatims'' work on it. I dk what to do and really please help somehow people becouse it is just sad. I know i am not specialist in this stuff but can someone instruct me with the solution? Please.. im seeding max 1mb/s whenever my pc is on btw.

Try the Tu Method(Title Update method)

Manually restart your console and launch all your xgd3 games"
,truemaster,2012-05-13T00:19Z,what new silent update? millsie2 what drive do you have? and what dashboard you had before update? c4e has said that topology data and ltplus firmware is the silver bullet it kills the need to repatch and reburn after any update the only case that problems ocur after dash updates are when the drive is sammy it always reflash again and again

utorrent:
options>preferences>bandwidth
then increase the global maximum connections to 1000 and the maximum number of connected peers per torrent to 500 is the ideal.

i only put in mine, max number of peers per torrent to 250, because somehow it disconnects my router when i use 500.

I shut it off and tried to play it again but i cant get past the m.p.3 loading screen(other games work). The disc2 is bad or maybe my game save is corrupt. I'm thinking about trying to load a new game save(never did it b4) and launch 1st chap on disc2. I would delete my game save but don't want to play over again."

How did you create the disks ?

Burning tool ? Use ImgBurn

Type of DVD Burner ?  Use iHas burner"

,Prestafisluktailla,2012-06-02T01:32Z,"I can confirm that both discs works! 
The game works without LT3.0!

How to make them work:

1) Download ""Patch LT3.0 ISO to LT 2.0"" 
2) Run CD 1 with the patch.
3) Burn CD1 with ImgBurn (Truncate)
3) Put a MP3 song(just pick one) on a USB-stick.
4) Play the song, then start CD 1.
5) When the game starts, stop the song and enjoy the game!

You have to play the song before starting the game otherwise you will get "" unreadable disk"" 

Thats should do the trick. Just repeat all 4 steps with CD 2, and enjoy!

Thanks Boobsman for the upload!"

,TabishX,2012-07-23T02:27Z,"Anyone who had trouble burning it. I shall share my experience:

I have Xbox 360 Slim with LT 2.0 dashboard 13719

Download Xbox Backup Creator, latest version I used v2.9.0.350 and download the LT 2.0 topology .bin file from thepiratebay

then from the Xbox Backup Creator: Go to Image Tools, click Action = ""Inject"", and then click AP25 Sector and select your .iso image file and then it will ask for the topology LT 2.0 .bin file, select the topology_for_lt2.0.bin file then it will say that it patched the ISO file.

Now you can burn your .dvd file in ImgBurn using the Optimal layer break and Truncate.

I tried this method, it worked flawlessly :)
