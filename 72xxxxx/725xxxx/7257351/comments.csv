,F1WilliamsJeff,2012-05-11T02:40Z,Thanks man....I am going to miss you because The Netherlands ISP's must block TPB :S....we end up like Korea or Syria
,strathmeyer,2012-05-11T03:17Z,"The blocks are extremely simple to get around. When governments put the blocks in places, more traffic comes from those countries because of people hearing about the blocks."
