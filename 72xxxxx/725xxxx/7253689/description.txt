        Release Notes:

        New album by one of my favorite gospel duos Mary Mary. The packaging is
        not very helpful and did not specify which tracks are remixed versions
        from the original... All the other older tracks have been remastered.

        Featuring 2 new tracks, the single "Go Get It" and "Sunday Morning."
        Enjoy!
