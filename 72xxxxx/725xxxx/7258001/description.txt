
This is an older copy that perhaps is not offered ells where. I tried to seed before, But now this one should work.  The other one dose not, I will seed this for some time.

This book is a MUST for all those who are true seekers of biblical truth, and is excellently written and considering the content, easy to understand. Author E.W. Bullinger spells out the biblical meaning of the stars and the zodiac, in their spiritual, uncorrupted state.


Providing the intellectual tools to see the deception which today's so called "astrology" attempts, Bullinger fascinates readers showing them how "the Heavens reveal the glory of the Lord." The many scripture references contained in Witness of the Stars can serve to assist you in your study of the Bible.


 Enjoy.
