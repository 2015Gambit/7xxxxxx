The Irish Catholic Church once had unquestioned moral authorityΓÇönow it is in tatters with rape and torture of children having continued almost unabated until now. Sixty years of official reports confirm this. 

Journalistic, judicial and political pressure may finally bring the Church to its knees. But the leadership is still in a state of deep denial, coverups and buck-passing so the problems are not yet resolved. 

A government report said Bishop John Magee falsely told the Irish government and the health service that his diocese was reporting all new cases of child abuse to the authorities. Bishop Magee stood down in March 2009 after serving as bishop of Cloyne since 1987.

In May 2012, The BBC reveals that despite being told about other children being abused and other children at risk of abuse, Cardinal Sean Brady did not alert their parents or inform the police and says he will never accept responsibility or resign unless told to by the Pope.
