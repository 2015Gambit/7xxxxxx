,stevogaleb,2012-05-10T21:57Z,"I think you have her mixed up with Amanda ""big juicy boobs"" Seyfried."
,mudpoet,2012-05-10T22:17Z,thanks bro!
,drakic,2012-05-11T01:37Z,are there any subtitles? for any version?
,toffeeapple2010,2012-05-11T02:10Z,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1838544/
,cake0110,2012-05-11T02:31Z,Meh. She's a blonde in this one. She looks better as a brunette... (ex. In Time)
,Fritz.,2012-05-11T06:13Z,"excellent quality.

its a good movie if you like suspense films. it keeps you guessing all the way til the end.

i agree she looks much better brunette, and there is no reason for subtitles."
,techneck,2012-05-11T07:58Z,Thanks mate.
,mooe1965,2012-05-11T09:25Z,"Come on, robin9872, she's not that bad. Imagine her staring at your junk with a little thought bubble saying ""Oh my GOD it's so BIG!"" and the frog eyes become endearing."
,warrior44,2012-05-11T12:51Z,Thank you SaM

,muntao,2012-05-12T05:28Z,"@wakkaflakka you need to remember that there are different kinds of uploads and people are rating them on the type of upload. so i could give a 10 for a cam, that could be a really good quality cam but not necessarily as good as what a blu ray version of the same movie would be. This would, in turn, render your scoring system useless.    "
,cheesy211,2012-05-12T08:43Z,"I agree with muntao, I rate based on the expectation. "
,int7777,2012-05-12T11:38Z,I agree with wakkaflakka.. the only thing that gets a 10 from me is a solid Blu-ray rip (probably about 2.5 Gigs minimum to get a 10 from me). I don't watch or rate cams anyway.
,jameses,2012-05-12T15:54Z,good copy. thanx mate

,Biglite,2012-06-07T22:11Z,"wow-wtf, if it sucks, it sucks. If I were starving you'd bet your ass I'd eat burnt bread, but that doesn't mean the bread isn't burnt. 

You don't have to accept or be thankful for free things, especially when there are alternative free things that are even better."

,QWESTSUX,2012-06-14T03:16Z,"AV: DVD quality, some suspense and at least had a decent looking main char"
,blombardo,2012-07-06T00:25Z,"lmao - to all those scoring systems - if you want to be picky - then be sure to include AUDIO in your scoring...  heck take it a step ahead and get all companies to actually use the two standard hd resolutions instead of the countless other resolutions on the planet - have all touchpad, laptop-phone and other lcd providers only make those two resolutions - then maybe we'll see fewer low quality options...
Thx for the movie!"
,blombardo,2012-07-06T01:29Z,"Beautiful, talented Amanda does a great job in this - and SaM encoded it quite well - clear image and decent stereo sound."
