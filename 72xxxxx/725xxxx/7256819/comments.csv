,MaxPayne-OV,2012-05-10T21:05Z,Thank you very much for uploading. I really appreciate it.
[T],iamgreat,2012-05-11T09:25Z,"You know i do XviD versions of other shows from WEB-DL because i have no use for the .mp4 format and i very passionately hate LOL releases. If all you want is the show without the snipes of Much Music i could make these XviD and they would seed a lot quicker. If you want the 720p and the no-snipes then the preceding offer is not what you are looking for.

As for 18 To Life, the first season is on DVD. Both seasons were released by 2HD though one ep that widely circulated had a bad unpacking from the .rar files (someone had checked the box to ignore errors during extraction - idiot - and then preceded to post it everywhere). I do have a good copy of it but i would have to look up which episode it is. If you are looking for a WEB-DL release of the show i can tell you you would be looking in vain. Maybe one day but at this time there is no such release.

Glad you enjoy it. A small but appreciative audience is nicer than a larger audience who are silent.  And no, still not available on CA iTunes so i can't get the other 3 eps. Sorry.  Ep 16 of The Firm was shown last week and it too is not on CA iTunes but the first 15 eps are. So strange this show is not available domestically on iTunes but is available internationally. "
,dansmutboy,2012-05-11T19:03Z,"Oh, I generally hook up my laptop to my TV to watch these, so I definitely prefer 720p h.264 to SD XviD. Thanks again for making them available in the former format, even if it does take longer to download."
,MaxPayne-OV,2012-05-11T21:57Z,"Don't worry about the download speed, took me like 6 hours but I am patient. Personally I am all for quality so please keep the 720p's coming."
,cindy25,2012-05-13T05:34Z,"any chance u can post ep 17 of the Firm

the idiots at the scene posted the NBC ep 16 in all forms"
[T],iamgreat,2012-05-14T07:33Z,"Cindy, the scene aren't idiots. Maybe 70% of them are but not the whole of them. Surely there are a few who realise that .mp4 w/ AAC is silly. Trading one partial compatibility for another is not the most sensible of moves to make. But in the English groups the percentage is probably higher. Telling you you suck for downloading The Voice in xvid whilst bidding a fond farewell to The Secret Circle shows even they are somewhat conflicted. 

2HD did put out The Firm and if i look at timestamps it was probably about the time you asked me for it. My PVR again refused to record it so something is off about the guide info apparently saying the new eps are repeats. I could get the Tuesday repeat if you really need it but as this is Sunday night there would be some waiting first."
