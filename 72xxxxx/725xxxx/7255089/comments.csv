This has been made into normal dvd like files using convertxtodvd-4.
There is no audio sync problems and picture quality is perfect.

1.  to use this all you have to do is if watching on pc, you ""right click the file"" 
and ""select play"" or play with"" and choose what media player you wish to use.

2. because this has already been converted to video -ts vobs files,
you can also just burn striaght to dvd disc so you can watch on any player or 
anything that you have that plays dvd's,  Just use a burning software and select ""burn already converted files, 
then select this folder.

3. any question about burning if your unsure how to do it just leave comments and i'll answer them or direct you to a 
software suitable for the job as there are many free ones out there."
