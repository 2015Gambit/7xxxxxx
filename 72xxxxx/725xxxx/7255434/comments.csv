,Tgod420,2012-05-09T22:25Z,Thank you!
,initialgt,2012-05-10T14:03Z,"Please buy this album and support strange music, its only 19USD for a signed copy with free t-shirt from strangemusic.net as a pre-order.  Its worth 20 times the price, real hiphop music.  Obviously im a huge strange music fan, i want music like this to keep being released so do your part and support the artists, life wouldn't be the same without abit of strange!  Thanks for hearing me out, love the album 10/10 for me, NZ out.."
