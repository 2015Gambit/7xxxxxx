[T],Spetses,2012-05-10T16:50Z,Sorry but service is going to be a bit slow and patchy for the next couple of weeks. We are having major renovations including power so all our PCs are out at the moment and I have grabbed the nearest laptop.Please be understanding if your regular mag is late. But I will do my best.
,thorhammer2000,2012-05-10T22:04Z,Spetses - you do a terrific job which is much appreciated by many of us. No need to apologise if it's a bit late!
