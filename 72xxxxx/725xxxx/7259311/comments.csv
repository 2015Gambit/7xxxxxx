,ghalib86,2012-05-28T08:35Z,"I know it's blasphemy to say anything negative about M... still, I want to get it off my chest... there are passages which have absolutely no sound, and I mean NO sound... not even a scratch when one is supposed to hear footsteps & whispers... I have no idea whether Lang does this deliberately as some form of cinematic device or what... anyone?"
