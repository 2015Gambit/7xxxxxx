M (1931)

Director: Fritz Lang
Cast    : Peter Lorre, Otto Wernicke, Gustav Grundgens, Theodore Loos, Ellen Widmann

Behind every great suspense thriller lurks the shadow of M. In this, Fritz Lang's first sound film, Peter Lorre delivers a haunting performance as the cinema's first serial killer, a whistling paedophile hunted by the police and brought to trial by the forces of the Berlin's underworld.

Inspired by a real life manhunt for a serial killer in Dusseldorf, M is the best chase-the-serial killer movie ever made. At once a creepy character study of a psychopathic child murderer and a riveting portrait of a community doused in fear, Lang deploys an arsenal of filmmaking fireworks in league with a progressive attitude towards his subject that is complex and still relevant.
