Plot: The plan: Kidnap your wife’s lover. Take him to a remote warehouse. Hurt him a little. Scare him a lot. Keep your hands clean – hire a detective for the dirty work. Simple? There’s no such thing as simple. The detective reveals he also has the wife tied up elsewhere in the warehouse. He thinks it’s in the husband’s best interests to confront her as well. The husband goes along with the plan and the sight of his wife tied to a chair, her head covered with a bag, makes him feel suitably strong and powerful.However this is no simpering prey. The only thing this woman is unwilling to do is be a victim, or lose.
