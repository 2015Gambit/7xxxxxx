===> btw Pulsar recordings is doing it barely, check out their website or their youtube/facebook page. It would be a great loss for the trance community!"
,scrawl91,2012-05-11T09:28Z,"Great torrent as always, I love these!

Please seed, we are stuck at 99.8 % :)"
,NathanReal,2012-05-11T19:07Z,"Noooo! FUCK YOU DR_HOUSE! You think that uplaoding releases from a label is gonna promote the label ? No, cause people are not gonna buy anything.. the best thing to do would be to upload 1 track per EP (1 remix for exemple), and if people like it, there is more chance they buy the whole EP... "
