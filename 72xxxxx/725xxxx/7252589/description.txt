Storyline  
*********


A mysterious woman seduces men, then kills them in a way too gruesome to watch. Nick must uncover this new and rare creature's secret and find her before she kills again. Concurrently, Nick takes (admittedly belated) action to stop the (Wesen) creatures from rumor-mongering and stalking his home; in this show of power, Nick is slowly coming into his own as a Grimm - and defending house and home.
