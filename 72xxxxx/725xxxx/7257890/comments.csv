,IAmXerXes,2012-08-14T05:36Z,"Nothing against spuddybuddy, but this isn't the best Frankenstein recording around.

I'm somewhat of an audiobook freak (450+ books), and this is (a) low quality, and (b) from libravox (a.k.a audiobook amateur hour). 

I would advise searching elsewhere - no offense spuddybuddy - you didn't record it! :)"
