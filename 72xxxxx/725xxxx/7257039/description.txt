I was lucky to get this show on DVD+R, because lately my old Panasonic DVD recorder has been faltering........or is it the discs themselves? Some work, others don't. That's why instead of recording the entire 3 hours only to find at the end that the disc was suddenly "unreadable", I recorded the first hour and stopped it as a test. When it properly saved I did the other two hours, and that also saved. Then I finalized the disc so my computer's optical drive can read it. So this show is complete, but in two files.

Since Hal Sparks hasn't been on the show for a few weeks now, "Humpdays with Hal" has left a void on Wednesday, so now Stephanie's in-studio guest for what she calls "Coffee with Carlos" is comedian Carlos Alazraqui, famous from Reno 911.

Two of the guests on the phone are Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur and weekly regular commentator David Bender.
