Thanks for the upload :D"
,pdrpdr,2012-07-05T06:59Z,"@Lierrah... well, thank you for doing the same. I didn't read the description, read the comments looking for info about the ebook quality and had to read your spoiler :("
,DaSqurlyOne,2012-07-15T18:49Z,"Thanks you, it's a great download.  Works well on Android and iPod. "
,ap88,2012-07-31T07:27Z,@Lierrah: Thanks for the spoiler you fucking asshat.
,MyKrossini,2012-08-10T10:24Z,@Lierrah... So you understand people don't read the description but pretty much everyone who clicks on this torrent will read the comments. They will read YOUR comment and YOU will ruin it for them. YOU are an ass hole and should never ever comment on any torrent again. EVER. Dick.

I hope you die from brain tumor."
,MyKrossini,2012-09-11T05:32Z,@cookies0... I second that.

I wasn't even a registered member here, but I just had to sign up to tell you what a douchebag you are.  What the hell were you thinking?  I don't even know if I want to read these books now.  People like you should be banned from posting comments.  Anywhere.  Ever."
