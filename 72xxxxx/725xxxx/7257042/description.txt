SEED, SEED, SEED, SEED

As my upload speed is only 100kb/s maximum I rely on others re-seeding it once its up so I can put up all the other seasons.

Once a season has enough other people seeding it to stay alive I will then upload the next season.

Okay here is season 5

I will stop seeding the first few seasons soon. (Just wish I had a better upload speed)

Now these are DVD rips that I downloaded from a Newsgroup originally 576 x 432 which was probably the originally transmitted 4x3 format.

I trimmed 30 pixels off the top and 60 of the bottom and resized them to 720 X 412
So they look and play quite nicely on current wide screen TV,s .  (They don't look squished or stretched)


IGNORE Comments from idiots who go around and comment that torrents are crap and then suggest you try a link thats not on Piratebay, as they are useually just trying to keep people off Pirate Bay or send you to a pay site.

Two people left negative self serving crap on all four previous seasons I listed.

mikeike65
and
Pamela22

Pamela22's have gone and so probably has her account.

If you see anyone rubbishing a torrent, especially one you have downloaded and found to be okay and you suspect they are only there making comments to keep people from downloading torrents etc, you can report them to Piratebay and they will look into it. 


Anyway Enjoy and SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDD
