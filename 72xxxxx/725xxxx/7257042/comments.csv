Just posting some info for others that might need to view these.
The videos are encoded with a DAR (display aspect ratio) of 4:3
So depending on your player the video may look wrong.
I tried the three below:
Media player classic will display it in wide screen format (roughly 16-9)
Windows media player 11 will also display it in wide screen.(roughly 16-9)
VLC media player 1.1.11 follows the DAR info and plays it at 4:3
So using VLC you would have to click VIDEO then ASPECT RATIO and select 16:9
I only tried to view this on a computer. 
So I can't comment on stand alone players other than if it displays incorrectly see if you can overide the DAR and  change your aspect ratio to 16:9
The audio is standard MP3
