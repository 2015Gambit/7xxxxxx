Description:
The game takes place in France during the 14th century, when the Holy Inquisition reigned over the populace and poverty and wide-spread hunger were commonplace. You play the part of Matthew, a young thief who is captured by the city guards and thrown into prison. While trying to escape, Matthew finds out about the so-called treasure of the Templar Knights and becomes involved in a quest to find it. Stealth and fighting are a major part of gameplay as you make your way through the treacherous streets and underground sewers beneath Paris. Only by using various weapons, lock picks and other tools will you be able to dodge the numerous sentries and other menaces lurking about. The tiniest mistake could mean your death. As you advance through the levels, enemies become more numerous and more difficult to beat.
