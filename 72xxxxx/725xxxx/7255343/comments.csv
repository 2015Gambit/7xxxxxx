BUT the question is :

Is this the TRANSLATED ENGLISH version ? or the Released Chec republic version ?"
[T],esharoth,2012-05-09T21:41Z,The game is in English. 
[T],esharoth,2012-09-09T15:39Z,Just so there won't be any confusion: this game has nothing to do with the newly released RPG called Inquisitor.
