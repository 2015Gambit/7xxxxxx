,fhaffar,2012-05-10T17:41Z,"I am a bit reluctant to download, as it says on description it is by MAHERZ and I know that MAHERZ does not do Win 7 yet, you can check all his downloads on his user

maybe someone else can comment or MaherZ can tell us"
,fhaffar,2012-05-10T17:52Z,"OK, I retract my comments, it is indeed MaherZ and he confirmed it is and has already got it on his website, but unusually for him to have Win 7 on TPB, it is a safe file guys, just seeeeeeeeeeed"
