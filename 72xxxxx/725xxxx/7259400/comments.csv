Still reopens every single time with the box that says I'm using an unregistered version and need to register it....  Have tried it 6 times now, with none being successful."

I posted a comment maybe 30 minutes ago explaining it, but it STILL has never shown up here, so.....just in case, I'm posting it again for the others that might have downloaded this!"

I agree UltraISO is much better..

However some people like this application.
When it comes to the Serial its 100% working, I have tested it myself twice.
And that's why I recommended in the release ""How To Use Guide"" to block it from accessing the Internet using your FireWall"

What you provided is not a crack...
It's the same Serial that I have provided only imported directly to the registry (which is not recommended..)"
,Bean-Bandit,2012-05-13T17:54Z,"Perhaps I was doing it wrong which I was simply copy and pasting but after installing and asking to Buy It, Register It, or Try It I picked the register it and it would never take the user name or serial number so I hit try it and then tried inside there and it worked.

So what makes UltraISO so much better. I don't mount the images even though I could but this thing works fine for me and what more could you want for just extracting the files from inside the image.

Now granted I've used the MagicDisc Mounter and it's kinda annoying for me, but that's MagicDisc and not MagicISO."
