,xk3nvel0x,2012-05-28T21:44Z,"try this steps:

1)uninstall 
2)re-install the game
3) when prompted explore the iso from daemon tools (or whatever you use)
4)go to PROPHET dir
5)install the patch
6)copy Crysis2.exe go to install folder (main of the game)/bin32 and paste the crack (overwrite the existing Crysis2.exe file) (for example my destination is ""D:CrytekCrysis 2bin32"", for you whatever you choose when you install the game)

Go to hell !! Enjoy & seed and support (+1)"
,xk3nvel0x,2012-05-28T21:45Z,"*D:/Crytek/Crysis 2/bin32

,iHustleu,2012-06-06T16:19Z,Where is the 1.1 update in the dir?
,iHustleu,2012-06-06T16:37Z,"Where are the update and crack? By ""dir"" do you mean directory? Cause i searched in the game folder for update and crack and came up with nothing."
,xXxSweedwaterxXx,2012-06-09T11:51Z,but I need the pruductkey 
,xk3nvel0x,2012-06-12T15:03Z,PROPHET dir (directory) is located on the iso file (image) from the torrent not from game installed directory and you don't need a serial key copy and paste the crack and the game will work for you
,killha123,2012-06-17T19:05Z,"I downloaded Crysis 2 in the past and I think it's affecting this.

Whenever I'm prompted to install, instead of asking to install, it only gives me the ""play"" option.

I think it still believes I have the game files which I do not.

Any help??"
,Meboling,2012-06-28T19:37Z,"Ok, so i followed instructions precisely, but when i start up the game, it freezes on a weird looking eye. is it just my PC, or did the instal go wrong? i reinstalled it, with same results."
,xk3nvel0x,2012-06-28T23:17Z,"@Meboling 

You have launched game from Crysis2.exe (the cracked one copied from PROPHET directory) or from Crysis2Launcher ??"
,the_prime,2012-07-16T17:42Z,"when i try to open the file ""crysis 2"" in the bin32 folder it asks me for a serial number? do i have to download one or is there one in there or even hhave i done something wrong?"

Hi dude, i will show you how to install the game for work corectly.

1) Uninstall the game installed by you (using ccleaner or whatever you want)
2) mount iso using daemon tools or power iso (examples)
3) run autorun.exe and install the game
4) when prompted DO NOT OPEN THE GAME !!!
5) browse the iso image (on my computer click explore) and search for the folder named PROPHET
6) install the 1.1 version patch (from PROPHET folder) (obtional)
7) copy Crysis2.exe (from PROPHET folder)
8) Go to main install folder of the game (defaut: program files/crytek/crysis2
9) go to bin32 folder and paste Crysis2.exe (overwrite existing crysis2.exe file)
10) open the game using crysis2.exe (from bin32 not from iso image!!!) or create a shortcut on desktop for crysis2.exe

And now all need to work for you very well if you have system requirements"
