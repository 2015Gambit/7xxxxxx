,alveolate,2012-05-08T20:12Z,is there some reason for tpb to disallow editing the torrent? it's so silly when uploaders are forced to live with their occasional mistakes.

,tflagger997,2012-07-11T15:44Z,"Too bad it was not actually in 720p.  Since YIFY seems to have an issue with it - let me explain.

720 mean that it MUST have a height of 720.  This is 1280x544 which is an HD ratio 2.3, but not 720 (means black bars on sides).

So most of YIFY's stuff that is labeled 720p, is not actually.

What really detracts from this particular encode is that it is only has a Data Rate of 809kb/s.  So you get a lot of screen tearing in active scenes.  

Thanks for the Up, just hope you label them correctly in the future."
,aquaepulse,2012-07-21T19:48Z,"actually tflagger997, you don't know what you are talking about, 720p means maximum resolution of 1280x720. for ARs > 1.78 horizontal resolution must be capped at 1280.

you are wrong on the internet. congratulations."
