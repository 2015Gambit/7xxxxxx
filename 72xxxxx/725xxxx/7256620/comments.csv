I've been using the Printopia 2.0 torrent for quite a long time, but there were a few glitches that REALLY annoyed me with 2.0 but were fixed in later versions (a big one was that a folder named ""Printopia"" was always placed in your Documents folder, and if you deleted it, it kept coming back!!!).  It's so great to have the latest version with all the latest fixes.  Thanks again."
