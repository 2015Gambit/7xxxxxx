National Geographic Wild - Snake Underworld: Punk music legend and snake enthusiast Henry Rollins is on the trail of slithering species in Snake Underworld. Revealing how millions of Americans have welcomed the creatures into their homes as pets, Rollins meets some obsessive serpent lovers who deliberately seek out the most dangerous breeds they can get their hands on. From illegal snake smuggling, to underground breeders creating snakes not found in nature, to people who "self-envenomate" in the hopes of building up a tolerance to snake venom, Rollins uncovers those on the fringe of America's secret snake subculture.
