Hey YiFy Act of Valor please!"

I'd take a larger file size YIFY if you'd be able to tweak the audio up in your 1080's. For now, I'll stick to your BRILLIANT 720 work.

Thank you for your hard work sir!"

And just how exactly do you expect him to upload it WHEN IT'S STILL IN THE CINEMAS YOU MORON
jesus christ if you're so fucking poor and hellbent on seeing it download a shitty cam rip if not pay 5$ and go see it in the cinemas for fucks sake it's worth it "
,peterparkerdatsme,2012-08-01T22:15Z,"Excellent. I always appreciate you guys' great work and the time and effort it takes to share with us but, I just have to say: THIS is the resolution you guys should do your 720p at--true 720p. This image quality blows the 544 (height) stuff out of the water. Love it. THIS is how you rip a Blu Ray.

This movie looks fucking amazing on my Nexus 7."
