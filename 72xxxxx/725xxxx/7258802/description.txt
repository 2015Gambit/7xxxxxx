Water Wars: when Drought, Flood and Greed Combine
The nation of Bangladesh is prey to every threat from water known to man. To understand the plight of this downriver delta nation is to understand what all of us will face in the coming years. Water Wars tells the story of this land at war with not only rising seas, but devastating floods and droughts -from India's dams dumping their excess in the wet season and siphoning off river water in the dry season. And as Bangladesh sees less and less river water during the dry season it is forced to dig more wells going deeper, encountering arsenic poisoning that is filling hospitals and graveyards.
