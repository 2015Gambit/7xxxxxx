Nick Burkhardt, a promising Portland homicide detective, told nobody he gets visions of people 'transforming' into monsters when he looks at them. While investigating the murder and disappearance of two girls, he realizes it's a Grimm family gift, which his grandmother Marie Kessler wants to pass on along with a mysterious key when badly wounded. Nick becomes her attacker's next target, but barely and wisely discretely uses his gift to track down the postman, who turns out a descendant of werewolf line, yet helps him find the violent monster.
