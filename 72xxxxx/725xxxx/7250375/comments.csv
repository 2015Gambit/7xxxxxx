,WalterWhite05,2012-05-08T00:16Z,I only have 2% downloaded but I can affirm this is indeed 720p HD. Can't say anything about censorship and loops though.
,aryasneedle,2012-05-08T00:33Z,"Don't be dicks, guys. Seed!"
,shpongles,2012-05-08T00:50Z,the screenshots are 1080p not 720p... which one is it?
,GugaLanik,2012-05-08T00:57Z,"Just finished watching it. Nice episode, but those who didn't read the book will enjoy it more. "
,mihai_s14,2012-05-08T01:09Z,"looks great, but it needs seeding"
,GugaLanik,2012-05-08T01:44Z,"@shpongles: it's 720p. Screenshots were taken while playing the episode with the KMPlayer in fullscreen on a full HD monitor using the Print Screen button on keyboard. 

I didn't know if there was a proper way for taking screenshots, so I did it the easiest way. Sorry for any conflicting info regarding the resolution. 

And sorry about the speed, everyone. Let's hope it will improve as soon as more people get the episode"
,juskoviak,2012-05-08T02:00Z,"This is censored, at the begining of the episode when Cersei suposts to say´s ""whore"" it´s cuted!

The quality it is good at least but i repeat again, this release IS CENSORED."
,aryasneedle,2012-05-08T02:01Z,...so many stupid leechers. Sigh.
,aryasneedle,2012-05-08T02:21Z,"@GugaLanik
I don't guess you could link to the site where you got this, could you?"
,GugaLanik,2012-05-08T02:39Z,"@juskoviak: watch it again, it's not censored. Cersei clearly says: 

""Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?""
"
,GugaLanik,2012-05-08T02:47Z,"@aryasneedle: I don't know if that's allowed here, but search for RapidMoviez on Google. I downloaded from the rapidshare links, using rapid8 for better speed

Nice nick, btw :)"
,aryasneedle,2012-05-08T02:59Z,.
,juskoviak,2012-05-08T03:39Z,"@ GugaLanik: My apologies by what i´ve said before, i only had 10% of file down and coldn´t listen the part when she says whore, i has only able to listen ""Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common..."".

I stand correct now and afirm that this file IS LEGIT, IT IS NOT CENSORED AND DONT HAVE BLACK BAR´S OR HBO CANADA LOGO.

The quality is very good like a 720p must be.

Once again my apologies  because of my mistake.

Cheers m8 and keep up the the good work."
,igota33,2012-05-08T04:45Z,"PLEASE SEED, flatlined @ 84%.

Thanks to the uploader, looks like your the only one with a decent 720p copy atm on public sites.

PLEASE SEED EVERYONE, get this copy out there for everyone to enjoy."

Thanks.   Will look for future ups."
,keyser_88,2012-05-08T07:32Z,"this looked like a grat torrent, too bad leechers are assholes, started dl not so great, then just went down to 1 kbps, after a while when i my upload number was higher than my download i deleted and went to dl a normal repack, im dling at 360-400kbps. i repeat, sadly leechers here are asshole (ik cause i was connected to + than 40 seeds and still not getting any dl from them)."
,aryasneedle,2012-05-08T12:10Z,"Things that are literally perfect: this torrent. :) Thanks so much for uploading, the audio and video are both beautiful. I'll be seeding for a while. :)"
,deodac,2012-05-08T12:43Z,"GugaLanik, you rock ! 

Too many problems everywhere around with the sixth episode, but it seems those minor faults will stay away from your rip... BRAVO."
,Sceptrum,2012-05-08T14:28Z,Thank you for this version. It was hard to find a non-censored 720p version. Keep up!
,GugaLanik,2012-05-08T19:02Z,"Thank you guys, for the feedback. Just wanted to mention that this is not my rip, I simply found it on another site and uploaded it to the Bay. 

Please keep seeding and if you like this episode, leave a comment :)"

,Rizzle033,2012-05-09T10:18Z,This is one hell of a first torrent. Very nice work GugaLanik. You have my thanks.
,LupinII2,2012-05-09T10:52Z,"topk is right, the audio is out of sync, I cant believe nobody else notice this or wrote anything about it -_-"

A few things to mention.

It doesn't jump.

It's not censored.

It's not out of sync, my copy plays perfectly.

@LupinII2

It's not out-of-sunc. Stop using shit players and stupid codec packs. Use a proper player like MPC-HC."

720p! No censored parts, no lags.
Now english sub I can't find anywhere :("

,eddlang,2012-05-10T22:47Z,I forgot. Remove the * signs from http and www for it to work.
,powers987,2012-05-11T04:48Z,"Great video quality, but yes, the audio is slightly out of sync. I just adjusted it (-.100) with VLC and it synced up near perfect."
,eddlang,2012-05-11T13:39Z,"@powers987

If it's out-of-sync, then so is every other video out there. It's not out-of-sync and even if it is, -100 is in the margin of error. It's just that some people FEEL it's out-of-sync, just like those who claim can tell the difference between 61 fps and 63 fps in games."

,dhirallin,2012-05-14T01:47Z,"So.. If it's possible to cram AC3 and high quality 720p into a 1.4gig file, why aren't all releases AC3? There has to be a tradeoff somewhere."
,dhirallin,2012-05-14T01:48Z,Nevermind.. I erroneously assumed AC3 was 5.1
,Valtieri,2012-05-14T06:44Z,"omg, thx a lot for this upload mate... please keep going your work with this, had bad times looking for uncensored and non-glitch version!"
