The hero is a German soldier during World War II named Heinrich Augsburg, who is killed on the Eastern Front facing the Soviet Army. He is sent to Résurrection after his death and is attacked by a mob of zombies. During the confrontation he meets a vampire who calls himself Otto von Todt and befriends him. Otto reveals he is a vampire and explains that now Heinrich has become a vampire as well. As the story progresses, the hero discovers the world of Résurrection, its peoples and politics. He is however only interested in retrieving a woman he loved during his lifetime and who he knows by the name of Rebecca.

This is part 2. I hope you all enjoy. In this part at the Battle of the twenty-third century in London that materialized on Resurrection, a monster gathering all existing diseases is freed to fight the vampires. His features are reminiscent of King Kong. Moreover, the monster is shown, in some way, at the top of Big Ben (as King Kong on the Empire State Building) fighting off a swarm of flying machines controlled by vampires and bombarding it with bullets.
