I don't usually come back to comment on the movie itself, but this one was a really good imo.  Adrien Brody gives another great performance(one of the best actors out there).  There's a reason this movie won the awards it did.
If your looking for a movie w/ car crashes and buildings blowing up, you might as well just move along;  this one has none of that.  thx for the upload!"
