Hiya Guys

This is a re-upload of my first torrent as I lost the files and the .torrent file and through extensive searching on Google discovered I couldn't re-seed it, mainly because there were no seeders *sighs*.

Here's the original torrent if you want to take a look: 
 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7100207/Slipknot_Volume_3__The_Subliminal_Verses_%28320kbs%29

So, this was converted straight from the disc using DVD Videosoft's conversion software, and has played flawlessly when I tested it :)
