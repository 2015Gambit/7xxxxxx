Favourite Bulgarian Folk Songs
Artist: Duo Sladko Medeno
All Folk Albums

Folklore in the form of music has strong messages from the past of a nation.
Each generation of musicians give their interpretation and broadcasting in this
area. Duo "Sweet Honey" in their own specific style makes the transformation of 
the tunes coming from the history and the texts - to sound like an intelligent 
game and fluidity of the subconscious. Pleasure is that - to feel the spirit of
tradition combined with modern range of feelings. New voices and new artistry.
New magic! Great edition! I wish pleasant listening to submitted discography.
