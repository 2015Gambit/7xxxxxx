"Windy City Heat" is a movie-within-a-movie - a real-life "Truman Show." Perry's friends/tormentors/co-stars, Don Barris and Tony Barbieri, have been promising Perry a starring vehicle for more than seven years. Cameras record Perry's every move as he wins the lead role of "Stone Fury," a hardboiled "sports private eye" in a movie called "Windy City Heat." What Perry doesn't realize is that there is no movie called "Windy City Heat." Everyone from actor to PA is in cahoots to manipulate our susceptible, fame-hungry star. Adam Carolla and Actors/comedians Don Barris and Tony Barbieri have been laying the groundwork for this mother of all pranks for more than 10 years. 

Starring Perry "Stone Fury" Karavello, Tony "Mole" Barbieri, Don "Big Lou" Barris, Bobcat Goldthwait, Jimmy Kimmel, Adam Carolla, Dane Cook, Carson Daly and Lisa Kushell.
