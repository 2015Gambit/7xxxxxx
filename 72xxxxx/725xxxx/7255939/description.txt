Sorry to ask you like this but otherwise people just do not read. 

Please download Dear Mr. President too, to make a point and give (a small) chance a chance. It is not hard and even free. If we do not believe in a small chance (for a better future)..ΓÇª..; well connect the dots.

Anyway, sometimes I like to go through my old records while my mouse is leading the way. This was not possible 20 years ago. All tracks I had more or less forgotten. Mostly because the sound quality did not invite me to play it in public but I kept them available, just because they were too ΓÇ£goodΓÇ¥ to be ignored.

Along the way I picked up a few tracks that resulted in an interesting Pop / Folk playlist.

Enjoy

PS If you do not want to hear or think about this kind of stuff please ask yourself, Why?
