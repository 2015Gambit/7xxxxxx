.::[The Eye of Judgment Trading Card Scans]::.


ALL card scans from Sets 1-3, including Phantoms (Both blank and with text) and promo cards. Ready to print and play!

Also included is a blank template (.PSD so you can choose which cards to print) and a deck box (To keep your cards in).



[Tips for printing]

- Print onto thick (220+ GSM) high quality photo paper (Semi-Glossy/Satin), others will work but I've found these to work best.

- Make sure you print from within a program which allows to print to scale (No resizing) as these are already the correct size when printed.

- DO NOT print in greyscale as the camera will not pickup the bar codes and green orientation triangles.



HUGE shame Sony/Wizards of the Coast stopped supporting this, but it's really the only way to play now as the cards are almost impossible to get hold of!

Set 2&3 are available as DLC on the US Playstation store for $19.99, the European store no longer has the download. Anyone outside of the US will need to get a NTSC copy of the game and download the US DLC to use it. The PAL version WILL NOT work with the US DLC.

Enjoy!
