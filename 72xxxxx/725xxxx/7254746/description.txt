What started out as adventurous bluegrass quartet is becoming a sharply focused roots music band that owes as much to The Band and Blue Rodeo as it does to Bill Monroe. Now, with Heartwood, The Breakmen plough fertile new ground.

The Breakmen formed in 2005 when four of Vancouver BC's best young songwriters and acoustic musicians got together to work on each others songs. The band's sound has matured into a distinct voice in Canadian roots music; Roots Soup to be exact! - well stirred and seasoned to create a blend of roots, americana, vintage country, bluegrass, and delicious rock and roll music. 

Known for tight vocal harmonies, creative instrumental work, and contagious stage energy the band has attracted both national and international attention.

The Breakmen were nominated twice for the 2009 Canadian Folk Music Awards for Emerging Artist of the Year and Vocal Ensemble of the Year for their second studio effort, When You Leave Town. The Band was also nominated for a 2009 Independent Music Award for Americana Album of the Year.
