"Previews"

"Bombshell" faces its first audience 
just as a major crisis hits Rebecca 
Duvall. The team of Tom and Julia 
scramble to fix the show when the 
first preview falls short, and Frank 
must adjust to the unwelcome return 
of Michael Swift to his life. Dev 
seeks reconciliation with Karen, but 
explosive information about Ivy 
lurks just beneath the surface.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
