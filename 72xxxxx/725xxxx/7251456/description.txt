Not typical, but exceptional. Director Raoul Walsh presents all that you look for in a western. An outlaw(Joel McCrea)has two things on his mind after getting out of jail. One is another railroad heist and the second is romancing "bad" girl Virginia Mayo. Fast moving action with great images of Colorado Territory. Super supporting cast includes: Dorothy Malone, James Mitchell, Henry Hull and John Archer. One of the best of the genre.
