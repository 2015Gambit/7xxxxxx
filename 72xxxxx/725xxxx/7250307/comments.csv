,mattymcc,2012-05-08T00:44Z,Thanks for the quick upload! I was beginning to worry on Friday thinking you got blocked. Respect from Canada!
,Bazza19,2012-05-08T04:39Z,Cheers Dean. Any chance you can upload the HD versions again? Really enjoyed them.
,flood218,2012-05-08T05:34Z,"Hi Dean, firstly may i say a huge thankyou for keeping this up, it is a great relief for my wife to know she can still keep up to date with Corro here in Australia.

My question for you however is would it be at all possable to name the files in a format that meta scrapers regognise (Coronation Street S55 E22) this would just be the icing on the cake."

[V],albiondean,2012-05-08T08:18Z,"flood218, naming the files such as (Coronation Street S55 E22) is not practicable mate, its better to put the date of the broadcast."
