I converted mp4s in to a new 1200bitrate xvid... mp3 128bit all in sync

i wasnt happy with afgs xvid rips.. they drifted out of sync more and more as
it played and they used 64bit for mp3 not 128 so decided it needed to be
better. as the big opera singer at end was good

i noticed even the mp4s were 100ms out at the end.. in VLC.. so can
only work with what sources are out there

help to seed if grabbing

enjoy

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
===================================
Ps/3 , phone and xbox users may consider grabbing
the free tool umile encoder 3.1.1.2 it can convert
to most devices to make compatible in 8mins
on dual core or higher. as some of my converts may
fail for certain devices.. you will need a pc to run it
though. no link just google it..
