Dean Koontz - Velocity


Bill Wile is an easygoing, hardworking guy who leads a quiet, ordinary life. But that is about to change. 

One evening, after his usual eight-hour bartending shift, he finds a typewritten note under the windshield wiper of his car. 

It says - If you donΓÇÖt take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher
