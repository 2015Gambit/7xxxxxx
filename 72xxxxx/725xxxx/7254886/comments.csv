,Dimmis80,2012-05-09T14:41Z,My good friend Nepotu congrats for this latest release.And congrats to RayAllen34 for his great work.It looks like to be an another great game between the Legent Celtics and the very young Hawks.I hope if i am right that Celtics if will win in this game the will won the First round series and continue from there.The old timers you know the big 3 Ray-KG and Paul still got it for sure and they are hungry for moreAnd if Razon plays the way he plays they are Big 4 and ready for anything..More power to them..I would love a final with Celtics vs Heat but i think is very early to tell.Also just to let u know the solution that u told me for that to choose what i want to download is working just great mate.And btw great speeds all the time bro.27 Seeders and i have 1.7MB not bad at all i think..Cheers mate.:-)
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-09T16:32Z,You are welcome! Thank you Dimmis for your comment but please don't post spoilers! Great speed indeed and I'm glad that I've been useful to solve your problem.
,nikita566,2012-05-09T17:05Z,"Thanks dude!

One day you have to explain to me why you have re-upload the old games each time. I right-clicked and cancelled the download for games 1-4, but there has to be a better way. Maybe we can figure it out together. I work with a bunch of pretty crazy programmers, they know more than me.

Again....THANKS!!!"
,nikita566,2012-05-09T17:12Z,"Seed people, SEED!

Nepotu is going through all the trouble to give us these games, the least we can do is seed. Leave your computers on and don't close your Torrent program when you finish downloading. We also want to see the game some time this week. I am fluctuating between 21k and 1MB, it is obvious people are connecting and disconnecting. Download the games and leave your computer and programs open so the rest of us can get it.  

THANKS"
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-09T17:31Z,"My dear friend nikita, I'm not the ripper, only the uploader. The rippers thought that this is the best. Some of them. Others no! So, we have to thank them for their work and take it how it is. We We have luck to have them among us, whatever. And u r welcome, my bro!"
,nikita566,2012-05-09T17:50Z,"I agree, thank G-d. If I have to watch another blurry game via firstrowsports I will throw my screen though the window.
:)

I am new to this. You mean that someone else ""rips"" the game? How do you get it from them?

I want to help.

I have teams of programmers at my disposal.

How can we talk to make this better for all of us?

Aside from the problem with multiple games, please ignore everything I said.

This is the first file I actually downloaded and the quality is SICK. Unbelievably great.

Go to firstrowsports to see how I (because I am an idiot) used to watch the games.

I just need now to figure out how to avoid the news and game results until I can download.

GREAT......AMAZING QUALITY.

Thank you my friend!!!!!"
,Dimmis80,2012-05-09T19:09Z,Yeah my friend Nepotu i might accidental and not ofcorse deliberately post something..!My bad and sory goes to u and to all of the people that using this torrent..!I was kinda exhitement and stuff.It will not happen again.:-(
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-09T20:03Z,"@nikita566: Yes, I'm not the ripper. You can't help more, because the great work is ripping, that mean you must have a quality connection to the game to rip it. Anyway, thank you, and keep in touch. Who knows, one day I will need you and your crew. Cheers bro!
@Dimmis80: I understand U and I forgive you! :) I know don't mean it. Cheers mate!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-10T04:59Z,Great game!
,mentallyours,2012-05-11T16:48Z,"@nikita lol.u mus b related to that other dude cuz he wanted to break his ""keyboard"". i use firstrowsports too. the only good thing about that is that u get to watch it live for free. but alot of bullshit comes along with it. u get the advertisments playing in the background, pop-ups, and like u said blurry picture. very fukin annoying, but still gotta watch it. how can u not?
