Thanks again. 

It's amazing to me that you are the ONLY person uploading NBA games. 

I guess most of the geeks that upload many TV shows every single day just aren't into sports.
:)

So...THANK G-d for Nepotu!

I try to watch the games on firstrowsports, but the quality is horrible (last year was better for some reason).

What time do you usually upload last night's games? It's hard to stay away from the news all day to see who won.
