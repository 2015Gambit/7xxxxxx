Plot: Cowboys & Indians is a breathtaking, raucous, Wild West adventure; a no-holds-barred story of the humor, action, and courage that encompasses the West. The epic tale centers around Captain Bugle, a former cavalryman, who must rescue Patricia, a beautiful frontier maiden, and her greedy, gold-struck husband from a band of renegade Black Claw Indians, who have broken away from the tribe against the wishes of their Chief. The band, hell-bent for war, is led by a frightening medicine man that believes Patricia is the key to driving the settlers from their sacred land. The fragile peace on the frontier hangs by a thread. Only Bugle, and his sidekick Hoot Cartwright, can scrap their way through outlaws, gunmen, gamblers, and the renegade Black Claws, to parlay for peace, rescue the girl, and prevent a frontier war.
