There's not much to write about it... 

I couldn't find it anywhere on TPB. So I bought it, i've enjoyded it ever since so i tought... Why not let all of my fellow simmers enjoy it too. So I present the Carenado Piper PA28-181 Archer II for FS9. Enough of my gay-speech. You can find info about the plane

It should be free of viruses and such stuff because this is the "Stock" Zip I've downloaded from simmarket just five minutes befure the upload of this. I'm not gonna say like all(many) of you guys out there... :P
"If you like it, buy it if you want to. Or get this instead. Because what I upload is excatly what you get if you buy it"

Enjoy. I wish you soft landings with this classic bird!
