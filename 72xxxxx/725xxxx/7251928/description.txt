The Himalayas
Documentary looking at the wildlife of the most stunning mountain range in the world, home to snow leopards, Himalayan wolves and Tibetan bears. Narrator Sir David Attenborough. 
Snow leopards stalk their prey among the highest peaks. Concealed by snowfall, the chase is watched by golden eagles circling above. On the harsh plains of the Tibetan plateau live extraordinary bears and square-faced foxes hunting small rodents to survive. In the alpine forests, dancing pheasants have even influenced rival border guards in their ritualistic displays. Valleys carved by glacial waters lead to hillsides covered by paddy fields containing the lifeline to the East, rice. In this world of extremes, the Himalayas reveal not only snow-capped mountains and fascinating animals but also a vital lifeline for humanity.
This large mountain range spans the borders between Pakistan, India and China and is a part of the greater Himalaya. Although living in the harshest of landscapes, the animals of the Himalayas have provided natural gifts to humanity. From the scent of musk deer impregnating the walls of mosques to the incredible strutting displays of the monal pheasant influencing the rituals of India and Pakistan's border guards, there's much cause for wonder and amazement.
