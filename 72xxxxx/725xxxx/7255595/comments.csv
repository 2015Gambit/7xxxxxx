dnt get da comic where i live"
,QuasarDeathRay,2012-05-09T21:47Z,Thank you. The show can suck my balls. I will still watch but my expectations for season 3 have dropped significantly.
,shonuffx,2012-05-09T23:00Z,Thanks! This comic still rocks! It's hard to understand how such great source material could be twisted into that crap-heap of a disappointing tv-show. To think that Kirkman is involved with it makes it a lot weirder. Tv-audiences/producers are an ignorant bunch of .......! All hail to the nerds! 
,DreamingFar,2012-05-10T00:13Z,"You guys should play the videogame, it's based in the comics universe and the writing is actually really good. They also fill in some areas the comic only mentions and never explores, like the prison murderers backstory."
,muckymucks,2012-05-10T08:25Z,Thanks for the up! Not much happening in the pirate bay on the comics front. Not even Mirror Master is around. Weird.
,wolfymain,2012-05-10T08:51Z,Thanks mate!  Much appreciated
,MuserClair,2012-05-10T11:39Z,thanks for the ul! :)
,Bubbers83,2012-05-10T15:09Z,"Hey GunningHawk90, thanks for all the terrific uploads. Not sure how to contact any administrators on here, but ""Piratenio"" is uploading videos, movies, programs, etc, to this section at an alarming rate: I've counted 10 pages of his crap alone, all minutes apart (he must have a fast computer). Know what to do about it?"
[V],GunningHawk90,2012-05-10T17:15Z,"@Bubbers, the helpers and admins are prowling all the time, so they generally get it done. But you can report in the forum too (bottom right cornerof the page), for some quicker action :)"
,panzent,2012-05-10T20:59Z,thx man
,creep2maniac,2012-05-11T12:42Z,matsalams!!!!!
,Damorte,2012-05-12T03:12Z,"Finally carl died, ive been waiting for that since like forever. annoying creepy fucking kid...."
,otnemem,2012-05-13T02:10Z,lol Damorte.
,Danljohn,2012-05-13T03:30Z,"@Damorte, you are an idiot, "
,NobleBear,2012-05-15T04:50Z,"Fuck you very much for the spoiler, Damorte."
,kata1111,2012-05-18T05:52Z,Thank you very much :D
,tgrphnx,2012-05-18T08:07Z,Don't worry Damorte is just trolling.
,agnostoatomo,2012-05-19T20:42Z,"Without your great uploads of this fantastic Comic and artwork by Adlard and Rathburn i wouldn't have known it at all, since it's not available in the country i live...awesome, thanx a million times."
,grimaudio,2012-05-20T04:10Z,Thanks!
[V],GunningHawk90,2012-05-21T10:43Z,"@agnostoatomo, it's not easily available in my country either :P"
,bsmkchan,2012-05-24T03:30Z,"Thank you very much for the upload. This comic or any American Comics are never available from where I am from, and that is Hong Kong."
,muckymucks,2012-05-27T09:30Z,Looks like issue 98 is late. It was supposed to come out last Wednesday. So much for Kirkman's promise to have it ready in three weeks.
,harry218,2012-05-28T12:03Z,I could never get comics in my country too. Subscription price is too expensive with shipping. This is the only way to enjoy comics. TPB is easier to get though.
,harry218,2012-05-28T12:06Z,May I know if all the comics uploaded here are from the digital edition or manually scanned?
[V],GunningHawk90,2012-05-30T14:47Z,"The ones which are digital, say so in the description. This one is manually scanned."
,S3YMOR,2012-05-30T16:13Z,Hi!! Can you upload PROPHET byBrandon Graham and Simon Roy. I'm a huge fan but I can't find it anywhere. Thanks for all the work you do!!
,thadmacracken,2012-06-24T00:25Z,"Thanks GH90, may the gods shower you with Sweet Pink 	Pantie  Pie."
