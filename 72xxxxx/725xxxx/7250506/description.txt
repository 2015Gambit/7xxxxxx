Description:

This book explores the role of digital information and communications technology in South KoreaΓÇÖs development, starting with and building upon the crucial developments of the 1980s. Its perspective draws on the information society concept and on a conceptual model of strategic restructuring of telecommunications. It also draws on firsthand experience in formulating and implementing policies. The analysis identifies aspects of the Korean experience from which developing countries around the world might benefit.

Oh and Larson describe the revolutionary developments of the 1980s including the TDX electronic switching system, a major surge forward in semiconductors, the start of privatization and color television and the thoroughgoing restructuring of KoreaΓÇÖs telecommunications sector. They further explore government leadership, the growing private sector and international trade pressures in the diffusion of broadband, mobile communication, and convergence toward a ubiquitous network society. The role of education in these developments is explored in detail, along with both the positive and negative aspects of KoreaΓÇÖs vibrant new digital media. The book also looks at KoreaΓÇÖs growing international involvement, its role in efforts to build a world information society, and finally, its future place in cyberspace.

This book will be of interest to students, scholars and policy makers interested in communications technologies, Asian/Korean Studies and development studies.
