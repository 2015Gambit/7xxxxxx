The Romanov family ruled Russia for 300 years; an imperial empire that crumbled in 1918 when Lenin-backed revolutionaries toppled Nicholas II in a violent upheaval. Before their world came crashing down, the Romanovs-- Nicholas, Alexandra and their five children-- enjoyed a life shrouded in mystery. But with the recent downfall of the Soviet Union, information has come to light ending generations of speculation.
