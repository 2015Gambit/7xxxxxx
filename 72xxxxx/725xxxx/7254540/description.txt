DESCRIPTION:

Family therapist Gurian (The Wonder of Girls) approaches his nature-based theme from a slightly different angle in his latest work, urging parents to 
buck "social trends parenting" and make decisions based on the core personality of their individual child. A researcher of brain science and 
gender differences, Gurian believes that much of a child's behavior is inborn from the start. But Gurian sees a disturbing trend in parents' increasing 
willingness to disregard their own instincts, letting media and society-driven fads dictate the way they raise their kids.
