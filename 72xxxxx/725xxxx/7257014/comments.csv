,damoggen,2012-05-10T01:46Z,@pjones452 This is Season 2 of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic from iTunes. They are 1280x720 and is contained in .mkv.
,damoggen,2012-05-17T00:02Z,"Because of all the HnRs, i won't seed this anymore"
,Scootaloo_42,2012-05-17T16:36Z,"That's sad, cuz I was kind of planning to seed this for at least a month. But people are stuck at 90%.

Yea, not everybody is a HnRunning bitch."
,Scootaloo_42,2012-05-20T14:19Z,"Two days with the swarm being stuck at 99%. Please read the torrent description YOU wrote.

Well, I hope the torrents are untagged etp releases, that would allow me to gather the missing chunks and, you know, manage to reboot this torrent you seem to don't give a fuck about."
,Scootaloo_42,2012-05-22T22:36Z,"Finally. Well, that was a painful download.

I will seed this torrent for the serie's sake. But let me tell you, damoggen, that you are no better than the â&#x20AC;&#x153;fucking assolesâ&#x20AC;? which don't seed. You'll learn that a torrent often needs more than a week to start on thepiratebay."
,Scootaloo_42,2012-05-24T01:04Z,"Oh, and btw, I was ranting like a bitch, but be ensured that this is the best A/V quality you can find on tpb for this season at the time being.

So if you wanna download the series in high quality, this torrent definitely is the best one. Even slightly better than the ETP releases."
