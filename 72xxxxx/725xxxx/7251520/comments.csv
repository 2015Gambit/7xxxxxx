,Phatfish,2012-05-10T02:07Z,"@MVC78:

You're probably right, I don't doubt it might be a decent movie.... IF anyone actually understood 16th century English and grammar. 

So to enjoy this film you ironically have to be extremely educated or extremely ignorant and stupid not caring what it's about, just liking the guns and explosions.

Then again,  if you really like Shakespeare I'm pretty sure you will find this movie to be fucking awful anyway. "

,okultus,2012-05-11T00:00Z,"A/V looks really good but audio requires Shakespearean translator interface.

Seriously there is a place for that kind of prose but it's not in a movie. Not even one based on Shakespeare's plays. Sigh. I was really looking forward to this movie, plot seems interesting but I can't sit through a movie in that type of prose.."
,cake0110,2012-05-11T02:28Z,"Pretending to like Shakespearian english doesn't automatically make you smarter than anybody... everybody understands what they're saying, it just sounds retarded in a modern action movie. 

Btw, Leo and Claire Danes weren't any better in Romeo + Juliet. And no amount of being pretentious is going to change that."
,TheKilljoy343,2012-05-11T03:17Z,"First off, thanks a ton for the upload!
A/9.5
V/10

I enjoyed this movie but I agree with what people say about the Shakespearean old English.

I would also add that a hell of a lot is lost in the plot and motivations of the characters when you remove the Roman context. A general proclaiming to be ""all about the People"" and getting excited when someone accuses him of not caring about ""the People"" is completely lost without the Roman social context.

I liked the movie but imo it wasn't a good choice for modern adaptation. Still it was worth a watch."
,TheKilljoy343,2012-05-11T03:43Z,"..another thing about the ""Shakespearean speech""; Shakespeare purposely used the language and rhetorical style of the common people of his day. He wanted it to be understood by as many people as possible. Subsequently I don't see the point in using a dead rhetorical style today. If Shakespeare were alive and made this movie he would likely have written it as we speak today."
,tiz2,2012-05-11T21:41Z,"@ Phatfish : It's really not that hard to understand. Of course some knowledge of the Roman Republic helps a lot to understand who-is-what-and-why, but the language itself shouldn't deter you from watching this movie. English is not my first language, and I understood it just fine and enjoyed it tremendously. 

For my taste though, there could have been a bit more action, more utilization of the modern setting, so it would come off as more of a device for the story instead of just a backdrop.  "

[V],rambam1776,2012-05-12T09:59Z,"mantis1977daman - There is something deeply ironic about someone decrying the uselessness of Shakespearean rhetoric in a post that makes no use of punctuation, capitalization, sentence structure, or logic. Now go download Transformers 2 like a good little 'tard."

,lekwarHUN,2012-05-15T16:32Z,"The quality is good,  A/V = 9,5/9,5 , but if you are not English, maybe you will not enjoy it... Unless you love searching after the meaning of every 2nd word. Good for learning..(( for me was hard to understand, and i use english every day)) Thanks anyway."
,coachrdb,2012-05-15T17:36Z,"Great quality... SHIT movie.  It might have been good, but to have to decipher what the hell they're saying in shakespearese is just not worth it.  I turned it off 15 minutes in."
,DogJosha,2012-05-18T09:08Z,"Its interesting to see how far our education system has fallen to receive this much hate for not being able to understand this movie.  I guess it can't be helped when a book that a 10 year old should be able to read is considered a ""12th grade reading level"".  I can't imagine how much worse its gotten in the 7 years I've been out of high school.  If you have trouble understanding this easy movie, then spend less time on the internet (where language goes to die) and maybe spend more time reading a book?  Having bad internet grammar is understandable, but not being able to understand your own language is just pathetic."

,c6burns,2012-06-02T09:06Z,"I would have to completely disagree with the whole ""you need to have the context of knowledge of the roman empire"" sentiment. I think the entire point of the film is that the story doesn't require the roman context.

Plenty of folks were all about the people in communist China. Or how about during the french revolution? The list of contexts fictional and real into which you could insert these characters is indeed long."
