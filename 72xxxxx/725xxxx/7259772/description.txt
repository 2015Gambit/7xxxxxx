I just found out that Mr.Jonathan Frid,who was Barnabas Collins in the original Dark Shadows TV series,passed from this life April 2012.I offer this Windows 7 desktop theme in his memory.

I loved the original Dark Shadows.I used to hurry home from school to watch it,as it came on at 4 PM local time.Now that a movie remake has been made,with Mr.Frid having a cameo appearance in it .

Besides the New Johnny Depp Movie,there are 5 other movies that sprang from the series.I'm trying to find them now
