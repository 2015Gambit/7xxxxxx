,jonbell,2012-05-23T00:35Z,Awesome thanks for putting this together!
,atroxmav,2012-05-28T21:07Z,"This is not HD, videos are 624x352 and only stereo audio."
,AllHope1sGone,2012-06-20T02:45Z,"atroxmav - true but it's still great quality.  These were probably recordings from a DVR, because the channel logo is everywhere..."
,vivacissamamente,2012-07-02T15:08Z,Seeded until my ISP forwarded a cease/desist letter from NBCUniversal...
,AllHope1sGone,2012-07-07T15:20Z,"DOWNLOADERS BEWARE (USA)
There's a copyright troll on this torrent and he sent my ISP an infringement letter.  Wouldn't recommend downloading this if your IP is public and you live in the USA...  anti-piracy assholes -_-."
,littleinu,2012-07-18T00:06Z,"Confirm AllHope1sGone. Got sent an email after downloading this baited torrent. That's why you don't download without reading comments, I guess..."
,fuckyourbullshit,2012-08-07T17:23Z,atroxmav  - thats what HDTV means. not to be confused with 720p or 1080p.
