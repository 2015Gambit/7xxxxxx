,UA-07,2012-05-09T05:17Z,"It's a false alarm !
It's 100% clean ."
[H],NZPirate,2012-05-09T08:49Z,"Can confirm, false positive!
Installer tries to install uTorrent which is a bittorrent program, other than that its clean and works fine...."
,UA-07,2012-05-09T10:55Z,Thanks NZPirates for confirming :D
,jappe6,2012-05-09T17:00Z,And why is both Symantec and Microsoft Security Essentials alert for Backdoor: MSIL/IRCbot.H then?
[H],NZPirate,2012-05-09T18:39Z,"""Symantec Endpoint Protection SB Edition v12.1.1000.157 RU1"" didn't pick it up. Anyway, installed and working, no alerts through firewall or anti-virus.

This is good to go, as its ""pre-cracked"", hence possible false positives/alerts people are getting"
,UA-07,2012-05-09T21:09Z,"@ jappe6 , two guys told you it's virus free so you can do me a favor by going somewhere else to troll "
[H],NZPirate,2012-05-12T05:57Z,"Well thanks for the download OP, Ive finished seeding this for now, uploaded ratio is 17.80%
Will start this back up if seeder/leecher ratio demands it...

,simonlws,2012-08-08T03:04Z,"Guys beware. Trojan found via AVG. 
Found this 
Luhe.fiha.a is a dangerous and nasty spyware. It often acts like a general file on the computer system, but it will do the bad things as a backdoor trojan. Users may find weird things on their computer but have no idea what exactly is happening.
No joke, I just download and my AVG pick this up."
,kailor,2012-08-30T17:36Z,"It's a virus... my AVG found virus...

Be careful guys."
,doc_up72,2012-09-09T04:04Z,"Something puzzles me. If it's a free program why does it need to be cracked? Or even uploaded for that matter? I already have a docking program so it doesn't really matter to me... just curious.
Thanks"
,doc_up72,2012-09-09T04:43Z,oh...nevvver mind... :D
,sexussex,2012-09-23T07:58Z,"fuck you both kailor and simonlws apparently both of you dont know the meaning of a false positive , so go and fuck yourselfs or eachother since you both are using a shitty AV to begin with and just go and buy the software then ok , cheers fucktards"
