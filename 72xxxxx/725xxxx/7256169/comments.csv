but if they did block the piratebay and single them out then that is plain silly as there are thousands of torrent sites on the web and i would have to pay sky less to make my point or leave them"

A/V: 10

I have a pretty noobish question. My ISP is pretty good, and on average, I get DL speeds of 1.5-2.0 MB/s or better. This torrent downloaded in just under 10 minutes, at an average speed of 1.9 MB/s. So my DL speeds are great, no complaints there. 

My question is, how can I improve my upload speeds?? By doing different speed tests, they all say my upload speed is about 1 MB/s. I've played with all sorts of settings in Utorrent, but for some reason, all I can manage is about 10-20 kb/s. Which is horrible! I'd like to have my ratio be a lot better, and I'd like to be able to help people out more than I am now. Any advice is appreciated! "

good luck

good that ur trying too contribute , we should all try too contribute , ppl if u have any stuff like old cd''s or movies , or goverment files do upload them , our goverments are assraping uss , and sucking our hard earned money its not russia , europe , america , arabia , africa or asia its all of them , this new light facism that we are actually living in its not about power its about decreasing live quality until u get use too it and the next degeneration comes , and skull fucks in the face , we should all wake up and start fighting against it its not bout morality anymore its bout living in dignity "

So let's be clear here: Because you don't approve of Mel Gibson--you say he is beneath your level of morality--you are DECLINING to ILLEGALLY download his movie FOR FREE?

You refuse to rip off work that he invested a lot of money in? You refuse to steal from him because you don't like him?

Dude, what do you do to actors/directors you DO like?

Step back, take a deep breath and think about what you are saying before spewing. 

Stop the Nonsense!!
