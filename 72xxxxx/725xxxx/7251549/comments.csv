,flo-willie,2012-05-08T09:35Z,"thanks a lot man! Let's hope the Clippers play a little better and don't win lucky. It's a shame about Baron Davis, yeah. But damn isnt it a shame about all the players with injuries? Seems like its more than normal, even tough the season has been shorter! Enjoy the game."
,rizalz,2012-05-08T09:38Z,Thanks Ridindirrty69 for the tip .... Yup it works!

,nikita566,2012-05-08T13:10Z,"Thank you very much!!!!

But why are the files so BIGGGGG?

A two-three hour game should be about 1G.

Thanks again!!!!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-08T13:23Z,"Thank you all for your comments! U r all welcome, my friends! About the 4 games problem, please read my comment here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7237976/NBA.2012.Playoffs.WCR1.G2-1(02_may).UTA.Jazz_SA.Spurs.720p
or the ridindirrty69's comment!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-08T14:40Z,"@nikita566: Please, read the description before writing comments! The file is so BIGGGG because contained all the previous games, it means all 4 playoffs games played until today. You have to select only the last one and you'll have a 3GB game file (1GB file is a 480p or less video quality, not a 720p). u r welcome!"

[V],Nepotu,2012-05-08T18:25Z,u r w! :)
,nikita566,2012-05-09T02:17Z,"Nepoto, I appreciate the upload and understand there is more than one game. I also appreciate the top quality. An 800 MB file would still be good quality, that was all I was saying. It's just it can take a long time to download 10 GB. 

THANKS"
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-09T07:54Z,"My dear friend nikita, I understand what you say, no need to excuse, but at that quality it can be 800 MB. And you don't have to DL all 10 GB, only the 3 GB of the last game. And, depend on No. of seeders, on your bandwidth connexion, on your PC, your DL can take from very few minutes at a couple of hours. And thank you for your kind words! :)
BTW, great game!"
