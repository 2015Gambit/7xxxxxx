THE METHOD

Potty Training in One Day is one of 5 methods of potty training your child. The method is based on 2 simple concepts: (1) The easiest way to learn something is to teach it. (2) There are consequences for behavior. The first concept is based on the fact the best way to learn something is to teach it. We know that children learn from seeing, listening and hearing. They learn actions & attitudes and will copy things that they have seen. So, a potty doll is used to model the appropriate potty training behaviors for your child. The second concept is based on the fact that behavior is shaped by consequences. As a parent, you already know that children learn from the consequences of their actions and you have probably already this as an effective parenting tool.

So, basically, with your guidance, your child will teach a potty doll the appropriate "going potty" behaviors. Your child will start learning that the natural consequence of drinking is the urge to urinate. The logical consequence of urinating on the potty are rewards such as verbal and non verbal praise, treats, toys and maybe even a potty party! Then, you child will teach the doll the natural consequence of not using the potty is wet underwear. The logical consequence of this undesired behavior is practicing going back and forth to the potty.

And it is as simple as that! AND IT WORKS! The Book & DVD cover the method in detail. They will walk you through the method step by step!
