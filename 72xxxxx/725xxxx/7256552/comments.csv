,thunderbum,2012-05-10T00:26Z,"Annoyme - what's the backup URL? Ever since I installed the newest uTorrent, I'm unable to grab a magnet here. Piss me off... The error message is 'can't find the magnet torrent in  question!'

Arrrrrgh!!!!!!!"
,ItBitTorrent,2012-05-10T03:58Z,"thunderbum, uTorrent 3.1.3 is working like a charm for me. Maybe try an uninstall then reinstall. 

Many thanks, ammoyme for spreading the words of liberty. "
,thunderbum,2012-05-10T05:43Z,"ItBitTorrent - Yup, I have same version. I installed this two nights ago. Desktop confuser is offlline because we're moving contents of rooms around so I installed it on my laptop. It even came bundled with a toolbar which installed itself even though I didn't want it installed...then it highjacked my default Google search!!!!!!

,Annoyme,2012-05-10T21:55Z,"Sorry, not much I can do.

The other torrent sites I have tried posting this show to have been disasters. 

It is a settings issue with your installation. There are other torrent clients if you cannot correct the problem."
,thunderbum,2012-05-11T04:47Z,"I tripped over an alternate URL when I googled today's podcast. Still can't catch a magnet link.

I looked under the General tab and the 'associate with torrent files as well as the install IPv6/install Teredo' are greyed out. No amount of fiddling in the Preferences changes that. Is this because I'm using a laptop with Window 7 x64?

Thanks for any and all feedback. Much appreciated!"
