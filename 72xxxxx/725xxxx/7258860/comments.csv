I guess CSPR cryptic shadows Paranormal research
air a nre case on their tv website?

they need a better video editor though :)

and more gear.. just wondering
why she didnt have a few cameras setup
on tripods filming the house as it happened
would of be cool to see the light
swing on its own as it happened like

and the time people are saying is not changing
from 3:11am

is obviously not a camera date and time.. it
was added to the video as a overlay
as its the same colour and size as the 
words/script explaining each part of the
video

the ghost hunter would be good if they
got some tv channel to gake up their
idea.. they need some fresh blood other
then taps
"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-05-12T13:00Z,"i still think discovery channel should have never droped ghost lab...but hey,whata'ya gonna do"
[V],psspss,2012-05-12T13:15Z,"shes hotter then kris willams i think:) no wonder
demons hang around

how the bloody hell can one sleep in the place
with those darn crickets and owls all night

ghost lan was ok.. they got better in s02 but man they are louder then the crickets in these heeh"
[V],psspss,2012-05-12T13:20Z,"thats a interesting orb.. I dont think its a laser light fake
as it dont seem to bend on the cushions

imagine if ghost hunters use 3d IR cameras.. then you 
could see on the new 3d tvs the actual orb
in 3d and then you be sure its not faked

I really had to edit these and up the volume
though.. they need someone like me
that can edit their stuff better :)
i was thinking about messing with the
music and amping the speech for the ghost hunter but was 4am in morning when I finished and upped these as was."
[V],psspss,2012-05-12T13:46Z,"i should of added their official youtube

to mess about with the http so reedited
yourselfs change add youtube back

,bubbanuggzz,2012-05-13T09:57Z,she is hot indeed sir.& i dont think a million crickets being lead by Zack from GAC could get louder than the Kling brothers.                                                                 as for the orb...single best one i've ever seen.it made up for all the un-needed time spent in her backyard
[V],psspss,2012-05-13T12:28Z,"she looks better in IR then normal light though haha.. just watching the other clips.. i think thats her doing the interview.. from the side shes
a bit chubbier

maybe she lost some weight since them.. that was may and the poltergeist was in Sept/aug

shes still nice though. think they be as good as GA if they got air time

not sure about that voice box.. shows how the
tech has improved since them.. like cycling channels very quickly opposed to only plays a radio station randonly e.g. the EAD haunting in bundle#2"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-05-15T03:27Z,im not sure why but everyone seems to look better in night vision
