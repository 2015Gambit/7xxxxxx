Cryptic Shadows S.W.A.T. Paranormal Team-Poltergeist Ghost Caught on Camera (Investigators Own House)-Aug2011.xvid avi

I found these on youtube various home grown ghost hunters- they seemed interesting ghost investigations but with youtube its hard ot know
whats been faked but these looked legit or entertaining espc
the black dude with top hat and eye patch
i had to crop them and up the volume heaps .. very bad editing and
it always makes me laugh all these home grown paranormal groups
love their heavy metal music intros and annoying music louder  then person speaking why do they add music at all when someone is speaking
crazy!

help to seed if grabbing

enjoy

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
===================================
Ps/3 , phone and xbox users may consider grabbing
the free tool umile encoder 3.1.1.2 it can convert
to most devices to make compatible in 8mins
on dual core or higher. as some of my converts may
fail for certain devices.. you will need a pc to run it
though. no link just google it..
