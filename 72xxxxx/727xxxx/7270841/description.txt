
False Memory

ItΓÇÖs a fear more paralyzing than falling. 

More terrifying than absolute darkness. 

More horrifying than anything you can imagine. ItΓÇÖs the one fear you cannot escape, no matter where you runΓÇªno matter where you hide. 

ItΓÇÖs the fear of yourself. ItΓÇÖs real. It can happen to you. And facing it can be deadly. 

Fear for your mind.
