Fifteen years after leaving his family in exchange for his daughter's life, a repentant father returns home to face the tyrant who took everything he ever cared about. When Luke Cain (Robert Patrick) double-crossed Lyle Tyrus (Lance Henrickson), he knew that coming back home could mean certain death. The only thing that saved Luke's wife Sarah (Samantha Mathis) and their ailing daughter Emily was the fact that he vanished without a trace. But now Emily (Mika Boorem) wants her father back. When a clandestine family reunion at a quiet café on the edge of town catches the attention of Lyle's brother Norman (Richard Brake) and his vicious gang of killers, however, the stage is set for a bloody showdown. Lyle Tyrus wants his revenge, and he isn't about to let Deputy Doug Brady (Joe Flanigan) stop him from getting it. But café owner Hec Hawkins (Hal Holbrook) and Rose Carter (Kathy Baker) aren't the types to stand idly by as Lyle and his thugs torment a desperate family. Unlike the past, today there is no running away for Luke. He's come back for his family, and this time he's going to stand up and fight for them.
