,KeiraTG,2012-05-17T18:14Z,"4 seeds, 36 peers, dl speed 20kb.
This will only result in my ul speed being throttled.
I always upload at least 1:1, i hate leechers!"
,KeiraTG,2012-05-17T18:16Z,"Also, if none of the (now 9 seeds) aren't uploading to me, why are they connected?
This happens a lot, i don't get it and think it's a bit silly."

,dynia49,2012-05-18T17:21Z,"in torrents uploaded by TvTeam, the subtitles of this type never work. They only upload the *.idx-file of the subtitles, which is merely the index. The subtitles are stored graphically in the *.sub-file..."
