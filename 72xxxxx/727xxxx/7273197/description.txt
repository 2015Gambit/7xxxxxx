 DESCRIPTION:

 This book is not a buyerΓÇÖs guide. In it, you wonΓÇÖt find endless boring lists of prices and products and useless part numbers. 
 Instead, this book assumes that you need a computer for some reason. YouΓÇÖll discover that reason and then read about how to find software to 
 carry out that task. From there, youΓÇÖll match hardware to your software and end up with the computer thatΓÇÖs perfect for you.
