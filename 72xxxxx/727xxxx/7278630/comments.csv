,Zipgun,2012-05-21T03:44Z,What nearly a hundred seeds and no one has any game play comments?! Come dudes us PC guys wanna know if this game is tight or hype!
,turntable83,2012-05-22T00:09Z,"@zipgun, people still game on pc? i gave up that ghost long ago. never have to tweak settings for fps, wait for install, all past and future games guaranteed to work on same hardware, dont have to hunch over a mouse and keyboard, and get to sit back on my couch and play on my big screen. just pop in a disc and go. wish i would've converted sooner ;)"
,Zipgun,2012-05-22T05:13Z,"Only freaking 9 y/o kids play the ""OOO the console is so much better than the PC"" bullshit. Grow the fuck up. Hey kiddo unlike you kids the rest of us work for a living we don't only play video games.  LOL! My kids are probably older than you are.

BTW What do you think they used to program console games with moron? When ya grow up you'll know a PC will smoke any glorified bluray player any day of the week."
,Zipgun,2012-05-22T05:18Z,"So no gameplay impressions eh? Game must be shit or most of you dummies don't know shit about stealing stuff as is the case with the other torrent on here. 

Besides only a FNG (fucking new guy) would use a public tracker like this one anyway."

,turntable83,2012-05-25T00:41Z,"Whats with all the PC elitist nerdrage, homey? Umad, bro? Spent hundreds or thousands on a lame computer that'll be obsolete in a few years. I work for a living, pay my own bills, take care of my own kids. I've got a PC for doing ""PC"" stuff, and have my console for gaming. I used to have a 'smokin' computer that I used to dump money into. That was until I grew up, and seen how useless it was. Hell, besides gaming, you could probably use a netbook for your other needs. Internet, office, watching movies, ect. 

Yeah, I get it, a PC will smoke a console any day of the week. For what end result? What do you do with a super fast computer like yours besides gaming? Encode movies? Grow up. Be a man and quit hyping up your computer like a 90's Honda Civic with a cold air intake, ""kiddo"". "
,turntable83,2012-05-25T00:48Z,"Oh, and tell all your buddies to quit coming to the xbox games and asking ""wheres pc version?"" 

In case you haven't figured it out yet, PC gaming is DEAD. "
,luckybill14,2012-05-25T09:54Z,^this guy is either a troll or has never had a good PC. I just played this game on 360 and I had to stop because i knew how clear and baddass it's going to look on my PC. enough said
,luckybill14,2012-05-25T09:56Z,And by the way my computer is 4 years old and plays every game flawlessly. This guy is a pure idiot and it's obvious.

,arsoned,2012-05-28T14:30Z,"I dont know what the deal is with everybody hating on the pc. It's always the price argument too. I built my PC for less than 5 and it'll be a beast for probably ever. 

And wtf is this ""PC gaming is DEAD""? Yeah, that's why PC games annually get downloaded more frequently.

But honestly, You're all douche bags. =]"
