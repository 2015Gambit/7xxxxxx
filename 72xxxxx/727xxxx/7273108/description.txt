Steely Dan is an American rock band consisting of core members Donald Fagen and Walter Becker. 
The band's popularity peaked in the late 1970s, with the release of seven albums blending 
elements of jazz, rock, funk, R&B, and pop. Rolling Stone has called them "the perfect musical 
antiheroes for the Seventies."

The band's music is characterized by complex jazz-influenced structures and harmonies played
by Becker and Fagen along with a revolving cast of rock and pop studio musicians. Steely Dan's 
"cerebral, wry and eccentric" lyrics, often filled with sharp sarcasm, touch upon such themes 
as drugs, love affairs, and crime. The pair is well-known for their near-obsessive perfectionism 
in the recording studio, with one notable example being that Becker and Fagen used at least 42 
different studio musicians, 11 engineers, and took over a year to record the tracks that resulted 
in 1980's Gaucho ΓÇö an album that contains only seven songs
