"Holding On"

Former Princeton Plainsboro colleague 
Thirteen returns in an all-new 
episode. The team takes on the case 
of Derrick, a 19-year-old college 
student who had a mysterious nose 
bleed during cheerleading practice, 
and discovers that his health issues 
are likely both physiological and 
psychological. Possibly suffering 
from schizophrenia, Derrick claims to 
hear his deceased brothers voice in 
his head. Meanwhile, Foreman tries a 
different approach with House.
