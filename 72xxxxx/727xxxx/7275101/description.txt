Rls Info:

The new age of trance music starts here, and it starts now.

DNA Records is delighted to present the thirteenth release as a label and this time it's a compilation of the label presented.	
  
After the big success of 'KamaSutrance Radio Show' that entered to Psyshop top 20 chart, the show must go on, and on it goes. 'Kamasutrance Radio Show Vol 2' is the 2nd compilation which is now born from the great collaboration between DNA Records and Israel's leading music radio station Radio Darom.

We produced this full length CD so you can share it with the hundreds of thousands of our listeners the amazing experience they sense in each and every one of Ofir KamaSutrance broadcasts.

You're about to get on board through an adventure of riding sub sonic vibes with full elemental dubbish percussion artwork on the psychedelic highway. The 21st century shamans of the dance floor headed by some of the biggest Israeli electronic producers will be leading your way.

'Kamasutrance Radio Show Vol 2' is a secret eye pick of the future of electronic music and an actual taste, better licked, from the sound that will be delivered by Ofir KamaSutrance, later this year in his upcoming solo album.

So, Let The 'KamaSutrance Radio Show' begin!
