Hey, first off, great job on creating the self-extracting rosetta. Really great. Secondly, when extracting these language packs to the default location,""C:/,"" the download won't occur because there is already a ""Program Files (x86)"" folder in the C:/ drive, your Rosetta Stone program. So can I extract the language to the desktop and copy and paste the ""Content"" folder to ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone?"" Secondly, when I open up the program, I clicked never register, and then I got an error that read, ""There was a minor error. Click OK to continue. #8112, 1007, 20"" and then I got to create my profile and so on. This shouldn't interfere down the road should it? I just want to make sure I get everything right this time and make sure it all works... Sorry : I appreciate your time and effort."

I'm a little confused by your comment, are you saying that the download fails to extract?

I ask this because, besides testing this on 3 different machines, I set it to overwrite any files.
And since it only CREATES the Program Files (x86) folder/Rosetta Stone/content folder,
it doesn't actually ""overwrite"" any files in the Program Files (x86) folder.

As far as your second question, yes, you can extract it anywhere you want, 
as long as you maintain the file structure.

I'm not real sure what the 8112 error is, but I think it has something to do with permissions in the Program Files (x86) folders.
change the permissions for that folder:

Open My computer
open C drive
right click Program Files (x86)
click properties,
click Security,
click advanced
click owner
click edit
under the ""Name""
hilight your user name
click OK
click Permissions tab
click Edit,
check ""Include inheritable...""
check ""Replace all existing...""
click Add
in the box that comes up, type your user name
click OK
in the next box that comes up, check the ""Full Control"" box to Allow
click OK
If a box comes up for you to confirm this action, click OK
A box will come up and show the progress
when it disappears, click OK until all the boxes are closed
reboot

That SHOULD solve the problem, but I'm not sure."
