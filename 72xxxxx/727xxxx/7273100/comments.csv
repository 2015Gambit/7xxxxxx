Tnx Reloaded and many tnx Scene4all for posting this. 

Now gonna buy the game anyway. Its just 1200 dinars in Serbia now. That is fine by my count. Cheers."
,Terehi,2012-05-17T17:26Z,My antivirus whines about some suspicious activity that the cracked anno5.exe is trying to do. Can anyone confirm that is the exe harmful or not?
,BlackeyeVuk,2012-05-17T23:43Z,No its not. Game runs fine and well.
,damp_,2012-05-20T09:50Z,Does this have DLCs?
,hotsparks,2012-05-23T13:40Z,does this need patch 1.01-1.04 before installing the 1.05? 
,earth3,2012-05-24T13:02Z,"it doesnot work with kaos release.....

,kidlonewolf,2012-05-27T10:23Z,"Alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There is a virus in solidcore32.dll. It is an autorun.inf virus that copies itself with a fake explorer.exe to every drive.

You've been warned. "

i mean no disrespect "
,earth3,2012-05-29T19:31Z,"@kidlonewolf
it is just packed with some kind of malware packer to the best of my knowledge. ur AV detects it becouse of high heuristics"
,Sajuuk_Khar,2012-05-31T14:22Z,"Guys I need help. With this update, I cannot load ANYTHING on Ark. Not a single item. I tried relocating Ark, no success. I NEED HELP FAST! Thanks in advance."
,Sajuuk_Khar,2012-06-02T00:26Z,"""Ark-storage and upgrades are both disabled in offline mode. In order to take advantage of the Ark's full functionality, the game must have an active connection to the Ubisoft servers...""

FUUUUUUU"
,earth3,2012-06-03T03:47Z,buy the original to make use of ark upgrades :P
,TehForkinator,2012-06-08T14:24Z,"Why hasn't anyone asked if we need any previous updates..?

Do we need any previous updates?

cause i'm trying to install this update (1.05) and nothing happens after i click offline patcher.."
,realspy,2012-06-24T18:50Z,thanks

yup. if you want ark as well as academy functionality (any new recipes researched won't get added to the list, even when ark is turned off) you'll have to pay $50 for the 3-activation rental. I passed on that scam as if I wanted to play an mmo I'd subsribe to an mmo, nevermind $50 for a rental (=game won't work after you change pc parts 3x= which some people do in under a year) is insane. And people wonder why piratebay is so popular. After playing this I was actually gonna buy it from Amazon, but not after reading all the negative DRM reviews. They can take their academy/ark and shove it. If this is the new way game publishers are going to run I'll end up selling my gaming rig and finding another hobby."

DUDE WTF. I am having this same problem. How did you add the registry??!! 

Don't just say 'fixed it' it is so effing annoying"
,OmegasParadox,2012-07-29T16:07Z,"FIXED IT
--------

JK. I did two things that may have fixed my problem.
I used this: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6848027/Anno.2070.Fix-KaOs (With reloaded Anno 2070)
And I also reinstalled it with my anti virus turned off."
,asanesslights,2012-07-30T06:33Z,"thanks a lot man, after I had finished updating to 1.05.  I clicked the icon to launch  the game, nothing happens. For the second time, I've used task manager to observe the processes tab. I relaunched the game again but nothing happens, in fact, the anno2070.exe suddenly disappears in the processes tab. What could be the solution for this?"
,Speeder172,2012-08-01T20:14Z,"There is a virus in solidcore32.dll ! 
My AV is KIS 2012, it always right. "
,kensuke77,2012-08-07T02:05Z,Still waiting on confirmation about this trojan business.  Hurry the fuck up already
,Fuqthegovt,2012-08-07T04:07Z,"solidcore.dll is not a virus. norton reports it as a heuristic virus, which means if it were a picture and a virus were porn it has similar levels of red green and blue colors as the porn, but doesn't 100% guarantee it's a virus. practically every av works this way and errors on the side of caution. If you are that worried about it feel free to pay $50 for the 3-activation DRM scam. Personally I just installed it on a machine that is never hooked to a lan cable, problem solved, that way even if it were a virus there's no way it can steal data and send it somewhere."
,Samuellko,2012-09-05T16:17Z,"Hi there, have a bit of a problem like a few problem, and that is, after this patch the game just doesn't open. In the task manager you see a glimpse of the anno5.exe task but after that nothing happens. I AM NOT USING ANY ANTIVIRUS AT ALL ON THE COMPUTER THE GAME IS INSTALLED ON, as it has no internet connection, and my Windows Firewall is disabled. Any ideas? And please don't kill my post with those idiotic ""im not duwnlodin, is to riskey, mah crappy anti-virus sayz with 0.0001% probability"" comments, okay? The solidcore32.dll is no virus, no trojan or whatever shit, so stop the fuck worrying..."
,tergazzi,2012-09-10T00:14Z,"Installed, blocked all ANNO files in firewall, and now when i try and play the game it asks for an activation key????  WTF? Anyone got a fix for this?"
,Samuellko,2012-09-10T12:02Z,"asanesslights and I have the same problem with the game not even starting, tergazzi with the activation key - is the update actually really working for somebody???"
,Samuellko,2012-09-10T17:38Z,"All right, tergazzi, you just forgot to crack it once again with the new crack that comes with the update. Do it and be so kind as to inform us whether your game works or doesn't start, ok?"
,Samuellko,2012-09-12T17:48Z,"OK, problem solved even for us :) The solidcore32.dll is being deleted automatically by the antivirus for some of us so we didn't even notice... Just disable the antivirus for a while and download the torrent once more and only select the dll file to be downloaded... It'll be a part of the crack, so just copy it in the install directory and you're done!"
