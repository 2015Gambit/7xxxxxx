,anshu21,2012-05-18T08:04Z,a 480p also same size as 720p?
,nahtnas,2012-05-18T11:33Z,"No. the runtime of the movie is > 3hrs. if in 720p, it will b around 950Mb. moreover, format is not 'mkv'. mkv gives more compression than mp4"
,anshu21,2012-05-18T19:48Z,"okay... eagerly waiting for super hits like mankatha velayudam..!! :P
very rare to see tamil films in 720p in such small size... and also with regular updates ..!! :D
