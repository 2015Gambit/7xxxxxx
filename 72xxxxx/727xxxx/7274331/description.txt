Tom Jones - Spirit In The Room-2012-pLAN9

Sir Thomas Jones Woodward, KBE (born 7 June 1940), best known by his stage 
name, Tom Jones, is a Welsh pop singer particularly noted for his powerful 
voice. He was born in Treforest, near Pontypridd in South Wales. He rose 
to fame in the mid-1960s, with an exuberant live act which included wearing 
tight breeches and billowing shirts, in an Edwardian style popular amongst 
his peers at the time. He was known for his overt sexuality, before this was 
as common as it became in subsequent years.
