Installed it without a problem!

But, when I start the course, I get an error:

""1000: One or more files required for Speech Recognition are missing or unreadable. Speech Recognition will be disabled for this session.""

How to solve this? I'd like to learn how to speak it too.."

I re-installed the language using an ISO from another torrent. 

The problem is that your program only extracts the 'data' folder into the 'content' folder, but not the 'speech' folder which seems to be necessary for Speech Recognition to work!"

You are partially correct, it DOES copy files to the speech folder, 
BUT, it did NOT copy ALL of the files to the speech folder.

I apparently missed this on more that one language pack, so I will fix the error, 
and reUL them, and title them ""with & speech"" in the name, 
so that the proper version can be DL'd.

I thank you for the input, it allowed me to easily track down the problem."

On my laptop (Win7 SP1 x86) it did not copy any files to the 'speech' folder; this folder was absent!

Thanks for your answer and great that you'll re-upload it!

Again, thanks a lot for this! It is highly appreciated! :)"
