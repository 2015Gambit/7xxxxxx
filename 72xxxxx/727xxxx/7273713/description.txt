Affection is the first album by English pop and soul singer Lisa Stansfield, released in the UK, 
in November 1989, for BMG/Arista label. Written by her husband and musical collaborator Ian 
Devaney, former school mate Andy Morris (who left her band in 1993), and Lisa herself, the record
was widely hailed as one of the finest debut albums ever by a British soul artist, going straight 
to number two in the UK Albums Chart.
