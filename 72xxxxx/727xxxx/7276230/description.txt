Director Darren Lynn Bousman explores the so-called "11:11" phenomenon with this enigmatic thriller concerning a best-selling author who stumbles upon a life-changing secret. His wife and young son taken from him in a tragic accident, Joseph begins attending therapy sessions as his estranged father, Richard, a small-town priest, wrestles with a terminal illness. Upon returning home to bid his father farewell, Joseph also reconnects with his wheelchair-bound brother, Samuel, also a man of the cloth. Now, the longer Joseph remains in town, the more frequently the numbers "11:11" begin appearing to him in a vivid series of hallucinations and nightmares. Meanwhile, the congregation of a nearby church begins to experience an onslaught of inexplicable supernatural events. As November of 2011 draws near, it becomes obvious to Joseph that something truly profound is set to occur. But what incredible cosmic secrets will that mysterious date reveal?
