National Geographic: The Best of Lisa Ling 
National Geographic Ultimate Explorer host Lisa Ling travels to the far corners of the globe to seek out adventure and address some of the most topical issues of the day in this collection of memorable episodes from her weekly National Geographic Channel program. From travelling overseas to investigate the motivation of female suicide bombers to exploring American prison culture and travelling to Nepal to meet with two dedicated doctors who bring the gift of sight to one of the most remote regions of the planet, there's no assignment too dangerous for Ling, and no issue too tough to tackle.




5)  Female Suicide Bombers 
A new kind of terrorist is on the rise: female suicide bombers. More difficult to spot, and in many ways more difficult to understand, these women are the new face of terror. From Russia, to Sri Lanka, to the Middle East, women are increasingly turning their bodies into bombs, blowing up theatres, markets, schools, even jetliners. Who are these women, and why are they dying to kill? Are they driven by different motives than men? National Geographic Channel's Lisa Ling journeys to the war-torn streets of Chechnya, and Israel's occupied territories to investigate. What she uncovers are surprising pieces of a complex puzzle
