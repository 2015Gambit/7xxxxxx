,TxJag,2012-05-15T06:49Z,My Internet has been sketchy as of late I will continue the upload in a bit.
,BigBod,2012-05-15T09:01Z,which bit?
,TxJag,2012-05-15T15:09Z,its back up now. So give it a go.
,TxJag,2012-05-15T15:24Z,Let me know if your downloading the file without issue. Like I said my internet was having issues.
,chromepony,2012-05-17T18:20Z,"Txlag, thanks, I really appreciate this book but I don't understand the way it ends.  Is it all there or is the last few paragraphs from something else?  I  haven't read it yet, just checked to see if it was alll there.  CP"
,TxJag,2012-05-20T05:15Z,"@chromepony, I'm intrigued now too, because I haven't started reading it yet I downloaded it from the iBookstore and it does seem cut off. I can't say it was intentional or not. (author or publisher intended) cause it wasn't by me."
,chromepony,2012-05-20T16:26Z,"Apologies from me, Txjag,  I checked the book at the store and it ends exactly as your version does.  I'm reading it now and it seems like two different stories in one.  Very interesting.  Thanks again for your timely posting of such a new book. CP"
,TxJag,2012-05-20T17:18Z,"@ChromePony no apologies necessary. I mean I thought the same thing. In fact, it says on the iBookstore that it's supposed to be 416 pages and it gives you the option to change to iBook page numbers or printed numbers and it comes short of the 416. I'll know it's right if you can relate the last sentence on the last page to me."
,them0rgan,2012-05-21T00:37Z,How do a find the password to open this?
,TxJag,2012-05-21T03:05Z,@themorgan there is no password for this. What problem are you having?
,chromepony,2012-05-21T03:40Z,"Txjag, Without telling the story, the last sentence fits perfectly.  It's like a ""continued in the next book"" type of thing.  I just finished the book and loved it.  CP"
,TxJag,2012-05-21T04:37Z,@ChromePony thats fine you scared the hell out of me when you asked about the ending. Nearly crapped my pants! I'm trading emails with iTunes and Penguin at the moment haha.
