Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego? is an American animated television series based on the series of computer games. It should not be confused with the PBS game show Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?.[3] The Earth show was made by DIC/Program Exchange and originally aired Saturday mornings on FOX. Its episodes have subsequently been repeated on the Fox Family, PAX and the short-lived girlzChannel. Reruns of the series currently air on The Worship Network, KidMango, The Hub, and, starting spring 2012, on Qubo. The series won an Emmy Award for "Outstanding Animated Children's Program" in 1995.

The first season of the series is now available on DVD from Shout! Factory. Lions Gate Entertainment has released two of the show's three-part episodes ("Retribution" and "Labyrinth") as full-length direct-to-video films entitled "Carmen's Revenge" & "Time Traveler" respectively. A video of the episode "Timing is Everything" is included with some versions of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? Treasures of Knowledge.[4] All 40 episodes of the series were released on a 4- disc DVD set in February 2012.
