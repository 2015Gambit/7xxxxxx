After a string of big 12-inches for the likes of Apple Pips and Brainmath over the last handful of years, one of the UK's freshest voices went silent in 2011. Brackles released just one record last year, a two-tracker on Rinse with the promise of a full-length to come. More than six months after that teaser, Rob Kemp's first album has finally arrived, and it's no wonder we haven't heard from him in a minute: Rinse Presents: Brackles is a cohesive, singular statement that finds his sound truly rising to the occasion. Nothing here is exactly new: from Roska to Cooly G to Brackles himself, UK house has had plenty of rhythmically adventurous, bass-forward proponents over the last few years. But on Brackles our man takes an established formula and utterly enlivens it.
