[b]Moyers & Company, May 4 2012: Between Two Worlds - Life on the Border[/b]

No writer understands the border culture between Mexico and the United States more intimately than Luis Alberto Urrea, whose life is the stuff of great novels. Son of a Mexican father and Anglo mother, Urrea grew up first in Tijuana and then just across the border in San Diego. Over the years he has produced a series of acclaimed novels, including [i]The HummingbirdΓÇÖs Daughter[/i], [i]The DevilΓÇÖs Highway[/i], and his latest, [i]Queen of America[/i] ΓÇö each a rich and revealing account of the people of the borderlands that join and separate our two nations.

Earlier this year, a number of books were removed from Tucson, Arizona classrooms when the Tucson school district eliminated a Mexican-American studies program on the accusation it was ΓÇ£divisive.ΓÇ¥ The program included references to UrreaΓÇÖs work. Urrea talks with Bill Moyers about that episode as he unfolds the modern reality of life on the border.
