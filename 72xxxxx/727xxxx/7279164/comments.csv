,Calel1234,2012-05-19T00:44Z,"MrDT, what bulk file uploader do you speak of? I haven't really bulk downloaded since TPB got rid of torrent files.

Btw, does anyone know where Hulk 49-50 is? "
[T],MrDowntown,2012-05-19T01:06Z,"This one:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7275631/DC_52_Week_38

or ichiroyoung's
But I think we're talking about two different things. Im lazy so instead of downloading 15 separate torrents, I download the DC week torrent and then remove the ones i do not want."

,MC_Hammer_Pant,2012-05-19T02:11Z,"@ Mr Downtown,

Holy crap, I had no idea about the bulk downloads.  Thanks for the heads up!  I don't mind snagging individual torrents, but sometimes I can't find all the titles... very much appreciated!"
[T],MrDowntown,2012-05-19T02:48Z,No problem - BUT I can also see why some people may ONLY want Wonder Woman for example and not the other 14 DC comics out this week so nvm above
,DVCIAM,2012-05-19T06:16Z,"yeah, you should upload each issue of each series to 1, I only watch batman, JL and WW series alone, so I don't know about the bulk pack"
,PiggyV01,2012-05-19T06:36Z,"Cheers MM, and thanks for Ferals too!...any chance of Batwoman? Cheeky, i know."
,soum136,2012-05-19T14:43Z,Thank you :)
,Batmanfun,2012-05-20T20:34Z,"First of all, I thank you for your great investment and admirable consistency, if you can upload Green Lantern vol 4"
,Suzuka16,2012-05-21T02:21Z,"I request the ""Tokyopop Cine-Manga"" called:
Avatar: The Last Airbender (Cine-Manga)
It had 8 volumes in total.

Here are links for more info:
1. http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=46732
2. http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Tokyopop_Cine-Manga

So please, try to upload those when you have the time cause I can't find them anywhere on the internet."
