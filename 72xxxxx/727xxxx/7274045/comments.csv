I think the track order is incorrect, though... I am showing that Unshakeable should be the second track, for example."
,Krood0824,2012-08-21T16:44Z,"Actually the track order is correct.  This is the track order for the Deluxe Edition of the album.  On the Standard Edition, the track order is completely different."
