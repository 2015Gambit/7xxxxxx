,drdoom6996,2012-05-17T14:00Z,Thank you.  The Chicago announcers are horrible.  I don't download this amateur crap more than once.  And I am not seeding the one Chicago game I did dl.  I am seeding all the rest and will till the end of the season.

I'm still seeding everything I've got from you.

About the announcers. Yeah, they're on the White Sox side - like any other announcers are on the side for their team too - and maybe not as professional as others, but that's Baseball and I myself don't mind it."
