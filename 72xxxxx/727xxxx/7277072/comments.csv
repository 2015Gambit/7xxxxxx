,rebelflagvl,2012-05-20T07:07Z,"man this is a fail.
Video is good but audio switches back and forth between chinese (i think) and english.
may not be chinese i dunno but whatever it is i dont speak it."
,coolhanddool,2012-05-25T03:40Z,"all you guys with your different quality ratings,
some say 3 some say 7 some say 5, gees sounds like its just a matter of someone's opinion, and we all know how different peoples opinions are from one another.
So if you ask me, its not worth reading peoples opinion of quality, not even of the movie, cause some may hate it and some may like it, so that's all a matter of personal likes and tastes."

,knightallan,2012-06-01T20:00Z,"I think what they (we) are trying to rate is that of the RIP or source (or whatever it's called). like, CAM or TS can't be compared with DVD or Blue-ray. 

coz it's pretty obvious the CAM will have a rating of 0-2.  LOL...

then, it would be like this example (Battleship 2012 max. rating=2)  ..hehehe... "
,st0gey,2012-06-03T13:59Z,"Using that previously posted 'Legio scale':

A-1
V-4

As stated by rebelflagvl, audio cuts in and out of original language. It doesn't happen too often; it just adds insult to injury because the overall sound quality is so poor that it completley distracts you from the (ahem) 'story' anyway. The hardcoded foreign subs are also useless and distracting. You can also hear the audience laughing at their own stupidity throughout the movie.

Overall, It's a really bad copy of fucking rubbish movie. But, you know, thanks for uploading it...etc"

How About? this a little more detailed
10 = 1080p bluray
9 = 720p bluray
8 = 480 p brrip
7 = DVD rip
6 = r5, r6,
5 = TS
4 = Cam
3 or lower = unwatachable"

8 = Excellent
7 = Superior
6 = Above average
5 = High average
4 = Average
3 = Low Average
2 = Below Average

0 = Very Poor

This would be a ""awesomer"" scale,wouldn't it?"
,Ticklebum855,2012-06-09T21:01Z,"Okay, first off, its a CAM! But, its one of the best CAMs i have watched, the video is okay, very watchable and i didnt even think about it after five minutes as i got used to it, and the audio is very good, apart from the fact it turns to chinese like three times throughout the film but only for about 5-10 seconds, and the movie itself is pretty entertaining allthough not one you should fork out money for, so stick to this and you will be fine :) (p.s its also a small file size which allways helps :D)"
,iMars666,2012-06-17T03:41Z,"@strangr2 - what does ""Bellow"" mean?"
,WdeBruyn,2012-06-19T07:31Z,Bad quality... Disappointing

A - 1

,induskreed,2012-06-24T19:33Z,"The video is good. Sound is okay for TS. Movie doesn't come to standard of IDay or Battle of LA. 1st half wasted on a bum (who is also the hero). Good visuals, but bad direction. Some places actors appear expressionless as if they don't know what to do. For God's sake you're fighting aliens!! Thanks to sCorp/HeroMaster."
