Marcus Price and Carli is back with their new monster single. If you
dont know Marcus and Carli they have been around for quite a while.
Marcus was first known for his part in the swedish hip hop group Fattaru
and his own sideproject Basutbudet while Carli is a part of the swedish
producer duo Savage Skulls. They have been working with artists like
Robyn and the Crookers to mention a few. As "Marcus Price and Carli"
they have made a few releases already like "Mat bira kvinnor weed",
Bubbelgum and they say themselves if they werent too busy with other
stuff they might as well be working on a full length album. Lets cross
our fingers cus this is well made dance music. Which i think you can
enjoy even if youre not swedish. Now its time for you to listen to the
song. If you have read this while listening to the song, the song is
probably over, then listen again and enjoy!
