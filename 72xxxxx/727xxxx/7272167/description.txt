S08E11 The Princess and the EVP
Original Date Aired: May 9th, 2012

One episode left before Grant leaves!!!

Tonight the team returns to The Omni Mount Washington Resort, the site of the most amazing EVP Grant has heard to date! And Grant will take a turn
investigating one on one with each of his team members. This is where Grant went on his honeymoon. What a place for one of Grant's last cases.

This historic hotel offered plenty of experiences during the last investigations: crystal clear EVP, glass being thrown and loads of personal encounters.
In room 314, where the team caught the EVP last time, guests claimed to see and feel a woman in Victorian garb sit on the bed. In the south tower, people
have seen apparitions and heard footsteps. Craig, the manager, is opening Bretton Arms, the home across the street from the hotel, to the team. Here a staff
member saw a white glowing woman floating towards the fireplace, and guests have seen full-bodied apparitions in the hallway.
