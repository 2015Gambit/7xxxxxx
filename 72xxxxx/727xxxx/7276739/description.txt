Announced on Delphic's website[9] on 2 November 2009, their debut album was called Acolyte and released on Polydor on 11 January 2010. Reviewing for BBC Music, writer Lou Thomas commented that it "might just be the first great album of 2010".[10] Acolyte was also described as "on kissing terms with magnificence" by Simon Price of the Independent.[11]
Songs from the Album, including "Counterpoint" from their first EP, and "Doubt" from their debut album have achieved mainstream success on YouTube, contributing to Acolyte's strong first week sales in the UK.
"Counterpoint" was used as one of the theme songs for Sky Sports' coverage of the Barclays Premier League in the 2010-11 season, and also is one of the songs included in the playlist of Pro Evolution Soccer 2010.
The song "Red Lights" has been featured on the new E4 advert for 90210.
The song "Halcyon" has been featured nationwide on the new advert for the Samsung Monte mobile phone.
The first song from the album, "Clarion Call", features in the F1 2010 video game by Codemasters, and is used by Sky Sports as theme music for International Cricket highlights programmes.
After a sell out UK tour in early January with pop noir band Mirrors, the band set tour dates for a second run of the UK in March.
The band have also been nominated for the "Best UK & Ireland New Act" in the 2010 MTV EMAs in Madrid.
