,shingabo,2012-05-20T19:24Z,@zixnbg what program do you use to sync audio?
,zixnbg,2012-05-21T00:17Z,"I used VirtualDub for saving audio from the film, ,WavePad for editing audio, and MKVtoolnix, for adding video to audio, or removing it, :) "
,zixnbg,2012-05-21T00:20Z,"Full procedure, MKVtoolnix, for saving only video from Webscr version, VurtualDub for saving audio from sc9rp version, thad Wavepad for inserting pauses to audio, and then changing it to mp3, and finally MKVtoolNix for connecting the video and audio. It may seem complicated , but it is is not really :D"
,zixnbg,2012-05-21T00:21Z,best to change audio to mp3
