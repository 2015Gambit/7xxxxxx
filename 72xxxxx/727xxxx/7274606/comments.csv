,jessie.p.johnson,2012-05-17T13:06Z,"Thanks Nepotu!  I accidentally already saw the score on this one, so for once, mentallyours can't ruin it for me.  Actually, I don't bother reading the comments anymore because of him.

Life is full of people like him who enjoy ruining things for others.  Hopefully he'll go back to gm 2 torrent and read what everyone thinks of him.  HINT HINT, mentallychallengedyours.

Keep it up, Nepotu.  Your hard work brightens my day!
