Hardcore #1 [IMAGE]

From the creative minds of Image partners Robert Kirkman & Marc Silvestri Once the hard core is shot into the back of your neck, an assassins brain waves can be transmitted into your body - circumventing your brain functions - taking complete control of your body. When assassins use this technology--your killer can be anyone; your barber, your neighbor or your wife. They are the best assassins in the world - but what happens when one of their own turns against them? Who can you trust when your enemy can change his appearance as easy as someone changes a shirt?
