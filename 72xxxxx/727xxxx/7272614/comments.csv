,george1052,2012-05-15T17:46Z,Usually I rely on others' comments but this time I will check it out for myself and leave a comment. I'm not that familiar with mkv files but I'm a little concerned that a 2-hour movie was squeezed into 413 MB. It's pretty slow but I will post a comment as soon as humanly possible.
,snowpea29,2012-05-15T17:53Z,if its a rar its fake....But the 1.8gig one is real just has hardcoded chinese subs
,atndigcrk,2012-05-15T18:23Z,"its not rar, and it hasnt been removed yet , im guessing this is a encode from the original 1.8 gig version"
,george1052,2012-05-15T18:25Z,"Hey guys, it's me again. The movie is definitely real! However, it's not an R6. It looks to be the same quality as the last cam that was put up. Kinda dark. I would watch it but I'm afraid I'll miss something really important. I'm not complaining...too many folks have helped me out to do that. Always grateful for what I get from Piratebay and the uploaders."
,biggdaddyben,2012-05-15T18:27Z,even if it is a rar it dosent mean its fake snowpiss29 dumbass nubes like u need to keep your comments to yourself for u could cause some other nube to miss a good flick.and no no dont down load an mkv file isnt that what everyone was saying just a few months ago.well i told you so nuttin wrong with mkv i hope you remember my comment on the mkv's cf22.like i said mkv is the way to go and oh yea size dosent matter.like i said charlesfire22 a few months ago you keep on keepin on with the mkv's bro for some of us know how to use um and love the size you get um to for us for we all dont have unlimited bandwidth and have to pay outda ass for it when we go over our limit.thanks again cf22 this is ben from dmwh just had 2 log in under anutter account other1s haveing probs as always catchya on da flip.

1.87 GB 

mkv files can retain great quality and have small size so its encoded 

its real i google it , its from china has hard subs and some are complaining abt sync issues im sure great copies will start showing up today "
,snowpea29,2012-05-15T18:50Z,Seems like it its a good movie if you can stand the subs cant really be croped to much more without sacrificiing more od the screen...Its been croped some already from what ive seen
,atndigcrk,2012-05-15T19:13Z,"jus got it, looks like a cam imma wait for nice r5"

,ch4dg,2012-05-15T19:25Z,"looks like a cam copy to me, but the best out there so far...the subs i hardly noticed

,goodfella94,2012-05-15T21:52Z,"Can anyone tell me how to convert to mkv in low size, high quality 7 2 0 p..i need it for gaming..my twenty minutes gameplay is three hundred mb...

,firsthd76,2012-05-16T08:53Z,"this is a cam. best so far. this one seems to be in sync, where-as the larger file is out of sync throughout the movie.
Thanks to the uploader."

I mean, if it's a cam, why is it being called an R6 or a WEBscr?
Is this a conflict in termanology?"
,vreyhr676y,2012-05-22T01:24Z,".mkv is a container only, it doesn't affect quality so judging a movie only because is .mkv is writing out of ignorance, the video and audio codec are the ones that compress the original video and audio, so also depends on the original source.

.mkv files can contain subs, more than 1 audio/video tracks and other objects, similar to .mp4 containers."
,Rithish,2012-05-31T08:34Z,"Can anyone tell me about the Quality??
and How is the speed..??
Should I trust on the torrent or not?

Reply ASAP!"
,panamalynn,2012-06-14T01:04Z,"charlesfire22 is the ""best"" at downloading small compressed files.  I trust anything he puts out there.  Thank you very much.  Without people like you I would not get anything.  I live in Central America where I am fortunate enough to have internet.  Where I live there is no cable, theatres, video stores and I obviously can not watch anything online.  TPB and other sites are my saviours.  Kudos to you all.  Namaste"
