Ooppss, when I wrote the description for this file, I left out a kinda crucial bit of information:

DL whichever language pack(s) you want, as many as you want.
(assuming you have that much free space on your drive)

It should read:
===================================================
DL whichever language pack(s) you want, as many as you want.
(assuming you have that much free space on your drive)

The correct language packs are named something like this:
""Rosetta_Stone_v3_Latin_Preinstalled.exe"", the key is that it MUST be an .exe file,
and may or may NOT have the word ""Preinstalled"" in the title.

===================================================

Here is the language pack you need:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272676/Rosetta_Stone_v3_Spanish_(LA).exe.

Sorry, that one's on me,

EinDeutschMan"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-17T17:27Z,"@snipercow,

Did you DL this ISO:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272676/Rosetta_Stone_v3_Spanish_(LA).exe

or THIS ONE:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7061421/Rosetta_Stone_-_Spanish_(Spain)_-_Level_1__2__3__4__5

The first one is for Latin America"" (LA), and is self extracting.
The second one is for Continental Spain and is NOT self extracting, 

If you DL the first one, and then try to load the second one, or (vice versa) you will get a 4112 error, 
""The language file is corrupt"" (Because it isn't there.)

I am still UL'ing the language packs that you need for this (self extracting) version of Rosetta Stone,
but I haven't gotten to the continental Spanish one yet."

Do you have any idea what might be causing this? Or has anyone else had the same problems?

I will scan it right now, I DO NOT put viruses in ANYTHING I UL,

My sincerest apologies."
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-20T05:29Z,"@curlycruz77,

Solution 1:
Set the permissions to the c:/Program files (x86)/Rosetta stone to make you the ""Owner""

Open My computer
open C drive
open Program Files (x86)
right click Rosetta Stone
click properties,
click Security,
click advanced
click owner
click edit
under the ""Name""
hilight your user name
click OK
click Permissions tab
click Edit,
check ""Include inheritable...""
check ""Replace all existing...""
click Add
in the box that comes up, type your user name
click OK
in the next box that comes up, check the ""Full Control"" box to Allow
click OK
If a box comes up for you to confirm this action, click OK
A box will come up and show the progress
when it disappears, click OK until all the boxes are closed
reboot

Solution 2
Go to Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3.
There is a HIDDEN file named ""tracking.db3"" - delete it

Solution 3 
TEMPORARILY disable you AV/Firewall software, 
If this solves the problem, you must put in an exception for Rosetta Stone.
You DO NOT want it to have internet access, 
BUT it must have something similar to ""trusted outbound"" for the speech recognition to work.

Let me know,
"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-20T07:04Z,"@njdss4,

I have scanned all 5 levels of the English (American) with Vipre, and Norton, both came up clean.

If anyone else scans this,and it comes up infected, I will remove it until I find out why

Again My sincerest apologies.

,njdss4,2012-05-20T13:10Z,"I Google'd the virus that is detected in the English (American) preinstall.

You are correct, the English Preinstalled does NOT have all of the speech files
I apparently missed this on more that one language pack, so I will fix the error, 
and reUL them, and title them ""with & speech"" in the name, 
so that the proper version can be DL'd.

BTW, Vipre, Norton and McAfee all report this file as clean, I have it on my own computer as well,
my thought would be that it is a ""false positive"""
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-21T04:20Z,"@crimss,

What language(s) were you trying to install? Also, where did you find the language pack(s)?
I want to see why it didn't create the folders correctly.

The main program (Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe) 
Does NOT create the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Content folder
It creates the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3 folder
The language packs create the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Content folder

While I do not know why the language packs did not create the Content folder,
Your resolution to the problem is absolutely correct.

The C:/ProgramData/Rosetta Stone/dynamicStoredPaths.xml file is what tells Rosetta Stone where the language pack(s) are
The C:/ProgramData/Rosetta Stone/Porducts.xml tells Rosetta Stone what languages are installed and activated"
,BlackMaryFlint,2012-05-21T05:07Z,"@EinDeutschMan thanks for your response. I was able to stop getting the first error by running the program as administrator. The second error was 4112 because the preinstalled language packs were not installed. When I tried to install them it said it was a 32bit program and not compatible with 64bit windows 7. I have another computer that runs Vista and everything installed fine. I tried to manually create the content folder on the win7 and that also did not work. Thanks for the program it works great on my computer, I am using it for my kids over the summer. It was my mother's computer with win 7 I couldn't install on. I will check back periodically to see if there are any solutions. Thanks again."

Yes, you need to block the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta stone/Rosetta Stone v3/RosettaStoneVersion3.exe file from accessing the Internet,

Check that these lines all have the paths as shown here

When the extraction box comes up, the C: is hilighted in blue, simply change that to a drive letter that you have rights to

All may not be lost,

Try this;
First of all, make sure you are the owner and have Full permissions for the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta stone/Rosetta Stone v3 folder

Then go into your AV software and put an exclusion for C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta stone/Rosetta Stone v3/RosettaStoneversion3.exe

Open Rosetta Stone, and create a new user with the new tracking.db3 file,
go into at least 1 level of 1 language, do a few of the lessons.
This helps ""define"" the tracking.db3 file

Exit Rosetta Stone

Go to c:/Program files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta V3 folder
Find the Tracking.db3 file you just created, and rename it to TrackingBAK.db3

Then see if you can recover your old Tracking.d3 file from the Recycle Bin
If so, try to load Rosetta Stone, this will sometimes trick Rosetta Stone that everything's O.K.

If that doesn't work, There isn't a whole lot left you can do, 
Rosetta Stone's answer it to upgrade to Version 4 Totale"

The second file will do what you described, it was for 32 bit machines
Don't sweat it, just DL the first file, let it extract to C:/

Then DL this file

Open the C:/Program Files (x86) folder. 
Extract the Russian language file,

open that folder and you will see the Content folder

open that folder and you will see the Data folder

,Hadkinz,2012-06-01T22:51Z,"Same problem as ka0tix. 
I tried multiple things, I noticed you said something about the products.xml, I deleted it and of course I got more than just a blank screen (tells me the products aren't registered and gives me the option to activate), that was encouraging in a way. 
I tried RS alone (without any of the languages DL'ed) and I tried it with French (the preinstalled.exe of course), both ways have the same result: The home screen with just the top right buttons and no more.
Running on windows 7, 64 bit, not sure about the specs but at this point I think that doesn't matter so much. 
Have you found any solution yet?
Should I try to DL a different RS from you? I tried the 32bit one (presinstalled.rar), and it worked for 2 days, but then gave me the error of ""Product out of date"" and refused to load (think it was error 2025? or 2125?) even after I reDL and fresh install. 
Thanks for all your replying comments."

Is there any way to make this portable? I figured since is was an .exe it wouldn't matter. I installed it on a flash drive (main program first, then languages) and ran the ""RosettaSoneVersion3"" file that you said to run. But it just gave me a screen with a background and the top menu items.

,donderry,2012-06-03T08:25Z,"If you are like me, you want this program on a flash drive so you can take it anywhere with you. Well you are in luck because I figured out how to make it portable (it's actually quite easy)!

How to make this program portable: 

1. Make sure you have enough room on your flash drive for the program and any language pack you may want. For mine, I have an 8GB flash drive and the program and one language pack takes up about 3.63GB.

2. Write down the drive letter for your flash drive. You will need this. For instance, my flash drive is E: on my computer. But you might have something else. I will use E: for my examples. 

3. Navigate to E:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone V3/support/config/.
Open the file named ""installerDefaults.xml"" (right click and click edit) and change all three instances of ""C:"" to ""E:""

4. Now navigate to E:/ProgramData/Rosetta Stone and open the file ""dynamicStoredPaths.xml"" and change all three instances of ""C:"" to ""E:"" once again. Now make sure to save these files. And you can now run it from the flash drive!

NOTE: This will only work if the computer you are using registers your flash drive as drive E: (or whatever letter you changed ""C:"" from)

,EinDeutschMan,2012-06-09T05:02Z,"@mdmvipers33,

The language pack you have may have errors in it, also, I haven't had a chance to create the self extracting version of it, If the one you DL'd is a RAR or ISO file, they're not going to work.

The 4112 error is that Rosetta Stone can't find the language pack(s), 
it could be as simple as they didn't get installed in the correct location.

Give me a couple of days."

,EinDeutschMan,2012-06-09T05:13Z,"@f0xtr0t666,

The 2123 error is ALMOST always due to the Firewall/AV.
Try this, TEMPORARILY DISABLE your A/V Firewall, 
even go so far as disable the services in the Administrator Tools
run Rosetta Stone, if it runs, then we can work on it.

O.K. 
What language?

What error # usually 4 digits, (don't  worry about any long string of letters and numbers after that)

Are you using the ""Preinstalled"" version of Rosetta Stone AND the language pack?

The language pack MUST have ""Speech"" and ""Preinstalled"" somewhere in the name,
something like this: ""Rosetta_Stone_v3_French__amp_amp__Speech_Preinstalled.exe""

Try this and let me know..."
,EinDeutschMan,2012-06-09T05:40Z,"@Hadkinz,

The Products.xml file tells Rosetta Stone what files are installed AND activated, you MUST have it!

Do a Regedit, search for and destroy ANYTHING that says Rosetta Stone.
Then search for and destroy any Rosetta Stone folders (and their contents)

C:/Program Files(x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3 
C:/Program Files(x86)/Rosetta Stone/Contents

C:/ProgramData/Rosetta Stone/the 2 xml files

Reinstall the Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe file
DL and extract the language pack(s)
Then DL the language pack(s) you want,

BE SURE that they have both ""Speech"" AND ""Preinstalled"" somewhere in the name:
""Rosetta_Stone_v3_French__amp_amp__Speech_Preinstalled.exe""

Then run the 
C:/Program Files(x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3/RosettaStoneVersion3.exe as an administrator
Hope this helps"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-06-09T05:51Z,"@Thuggish456,

Yes, your method will work fine, the key is that the content folder in moved to
C:/Program Files(x86)/Rosetta Stone, 

so it should appear as:
C:/Program Files(x86)/Rosetta Stone/Content
AND this folder:
C:/Program Files(x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3

Thanks for the input!"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-06-09T06:13Z,"@donderry,

Good plan,
Install Rosetta Stone to the default locations on your hard drive, create the folder structure on the flash drive, and then copy everything over .

you can edit the DynamicStoredPaths.xml with notepad, and create any file structure you wish AS LONG AS the paths all point to folders that exist on the flash drive, i.e.

installerDefaults pathToAllUsers=""E:/Rosetta Stonev3.4.7/Rosetta Stone v3""
localDatabasePath E:/Rosetta Stonev3.4.7/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3/tracking.db3  /localDatabasePath
languageDataBasePath confirmed=""true"" E:/Rosetta Stonev3.4.7/Rosetta Stone/content

And then all you have to do is change the drive letter from E to whatever you want,
and it will work on any machine"

 i DL'd  Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar, Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe, and Rosetta Stone v3 Japanese & Speech Preinstalled.exe and currently DL'ing Spanish_LatinAmerica_PreInstalled.rar.
 im sorry, i havent successfully DL'd a program like this before, ive done PSP games, and attempted sims 3 EP's for my younger sister but i could never get it to work.  

SO, first i coppied Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar files (Program Files and Program Data) to disk C in the correct places. then i ran Spanish_LatinAmerica_PreInstalled.rar to disk C also. i opened it as administrator, made it to the end, and there were the language packs, except the Japanese pack. ...what am i doing wrong? i have Win7... if i click on one of the languages such as spanish Latin America (which is still installing) it says error 4112... if that helps  

should i try using this torrent instead of the v3 Preinstalled.exe?

use the scroll bar and go to the top where you see Computer in the left pane
click on Computer

Find, 
in the Find what box, type in rosetta
click Find Next
a box will come up ""Searching the Registry""
when it finds an entry, it will be hi lighted in blue 
RIGHT CLICK the blue part
click Delete,
a window will come up warning about deleting things in the registry
Click Yes, 
press F3, 
repeat until it says ""Finished searching through the registry""
exit Regedit

Now, pick up in the comment for kikazz303,
delete the folders, and continue with the installation.

Install the http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272499/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_Preinstalled.exe FIRST,
then DL the language pack(s) you want, extract them one at a time.

,Smityro,2012-07-11T07:28Z,"@jeffreym  @lollyjay44
I assure you, the extractor did create the Rosetta Stone directory within your ProgramData folder. C:ProgramData is a hidden directory, therefore you are not able to see it unless you have set Windows to show hidden folders (which is in Control Panel under 'Folder Options') However, to fix the issue that you are having with this infamous Error 2123 - There was an error in this application, please see below:

Go to the path of Rosetta Stone v3 (C:Program Files (x86)Rosetta StoneRosetta Stone V3 or C:Program FilesRosetta StoneRosetta Stone V3 for 32 bit operating systems) and run service_installer.exe. If this does not correct the issue, right click on service_installer.exe and 'Run as administrator'. Cheers!

I downloaded the Spanish Preinstalled.exe file and got it to work just fine. 

I seem to have two problems and maybe you'll be able to give me some clues as to what I did wrong.

1. I passed the speech recognition thing...(u know, 1,2,3,4,5) and once I click continue, it says something about a file being missing for speech recognition to work. I let it go, figured I'll just do the other exercises. but another problem occured.....

2. Once i finished level two, it asked me to put in my activation code, instead i clicked Activate Later, hoping it will just let me go over to level 3 but it didn't.

I then removed the tracking.db3 as suggested, and then I got the same problem as @brazillianguy. It never asked to register the product, and it wouldn't allow me to create a new user.

5. Rosetta Stone will prompt you to install the language, do so

1. in my case there was HIDDEN FOLDER for tracking.db3, in my case it was in [drivename]:Users[username]AppDataLocalVirtualStoreProgram Files (x86)Rosetta StoneRosetta Stone V3 and there it was. i deleted it and.. (as you may know, as one runs the programm it is regenerated a new, every time, so, i deleted this file after every change i made pointed in point 2) question might be for some, that how to see the hidden folders i have not english windows so i shall not explain/translate it here but if you do some searching in google, you will find it. you can try to search also inside windows for 'VirtualStore'.. and p.s. in the virtualstore folder, 

NB! there is hidden folder for products.xml (...VirtualStoreProgramDataRosetta Stone) that holds all information about user names and progress. if problem persists, you can delete that has well.

2. i DELETED ALSO tracking.db3 from main folder(drivename:Program Files (x86)Rosetta StoneRosetta Stone V3)


3. COMPATIBILITY ISSUES: right click on RosettaStoneVersion3.exe (drivename:Program Files (x86)Rosetta StoneRosetta Stone V3), right click opens a window, a second tab is compability tab and from there i clicked run as windows xp (service pack 3). 

but i had some problems with that. first time i did, program started and.. but second time it didn't. i went back to delete tracking.db3 as mentioned in step 1 and 2 and (i did it many times) .. it didn't help. i even tried to start it as administrator and also tried to have compatibility shared to all users and... no. deleted tracking.db3 again and then i remembered the best advice and RESTARTED comp and it worked. have tried many times and still works BUT

4. NO MIC was found as i ran it in compatibility mode. so i tried to unmark it and run it as normal and it worked. and it found microphone as well.

i can not guaranty that it will work with you but the best advice i would give is DO NOT GIVE UP: TRY and .. i did it and it works. and .. it is worth to try. knowing languages is a treasure!

Have you installed any languages? You'll find the languages in EinDeutschMan's torrents list. Use the ones which have the title ""preinstalled"" in them.
You get this error when there aren't languages installed or Rosetta Stone can't read the languages from C:Program Files (x86)Rosetta StoneContent (Assuming you've installed them there).
The preinstalled versions of the languages by EinDeutschMan automatically put them in that folder.

1.You can ignore the error 8112, Rosetta Stone works fine even with it. I do the same, just click OK and forget about it. 
2.About the 4112 error, have you downloaded this torrent? http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7302900/Rosetta_Stone_v3_English__amp_amp__speech_Preinstalled.exe
Only download torrents which have the word ""Preinstalled"" in them. Only they work fine. To install a language, just double click on it, and click extract. It installs in the default drive. Before you ask any other questions, have you installed Rosetta Stone in C:/ drive? That matters for the language packs to work.

@sean6283
Download languages which have the word ""Preinstalled"" in their title. Only those work fine. In your case you want the Spanish (LA) version, so this is the torrent for you http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7343196/Rosetta_Stone_v3_Spanish_%28LA%29_v3__amp_amp__Speech_Preinstalled.exe
Hope that helps.

I googled a bit about ""blank screen in rosetta stone""
One of the possible methods to fix it was to delete the 'tracking.db3' file. 
Another was to run it in Windows XP SP2 COMPATIBILITY mode and running it as administrator after rebooting your pc. 
Note : Do a fresh install of Rosetta stone for it to work.

Please read EinDeutschMan's comments on page 4 addressed to kikazz303, it's the 16th comment from top on that page. It gives instructions on what to do in regedit, what files to delete and how to reinstall Rosetta Stone. That should make the 4112 error go.

About installation, the Preinstalled version of Rosetta stone v3.4.7 should install in C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone V3 if you're using 64-bit Windows, or C:/Program Files/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone V3 if you're using 32 bit Windows.

The language packs (AFTER YOU HAVE INSTALLED THEM) have to be in C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Content if you're using 64-bit Windows, or C:/Program Files/Rosetta Stone/Content if you're using 32 bit Windows.

In your case you're downloading German language packs, so your Content folder should have ATLEAST these files : 
SK-DEU-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-DEU-L2-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-DEU-L3-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-DEU-L4-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-DEU-L5-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi

The L1, L2, L3, L4, L5 in the names obviously stand for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th stage of the language.
Well, hope that helped."
,prakkat,2012-09-07T06:20Z,"Hi. I just want to thank you Eindeutschman for this fantastic educative upload. I have installed it personally and without a glitch on 9 machines so far and given the french preinstalled version to almost 400 of my french students! For those who have had problems, I have been able to solve them by deleting the Rosetta Stone folder located in the Program Files (x86) folder and reinstall the app as ADMINISTRATOR (otherwise the installation might, if it installs at all, generate fatal errors) and never directly from a USB but from the HDD (I copied them from the USB to HDD otherwise the app sometimes asks for an installation disk). I needed to demonstrate the use of the Rosetta Stone system to justify the purchase of license and it is a huge step forward in the assisted teaching of languages. I probably wouldn't be able to learn so well a language without enrichment from a teacher but as a tool it is simply unbeatable. I HIGHLY recommend this upload for all language teachers to prepare a 2 year planning for students. It is that good. Thank you so much Eindeutschman for making this tool available. 5 STAR UPLOAD!"

,Bashfool,2012-09-20T01:28Z,"I love the work you have done to make this work.  I was trying to get a danish version working, never could get it to recognize the language disk.  So after months of beating my haead against the wall.  I found your system which works perfectly on my windows 7 (x64).  Any chance you might be able to upload a danish language pack, or tell me how to install the language disk to your version?"
,GoPx,2012-09-20T21:29Z,"Could someone please help me to install the Arabic language. I have tried to install different Arabic versions on different Rosetta Stone programs and it doesn't work. For example, when I mount the Arabic CD and install it on Rosetta it installs for a few minutes and then calculated goes high like 180min and the whole computer stops then. I can install other languages like german but not arabic, please help me. 

Its the same with this version, I install Preinstalled Rosetta stone and a preinstalled language like german and it works like a charm. But I cant install preinstalled arabic, it installs for a few sec and then it stops and the whole computer stops. please help.

I have Windows 7 64bit"
