TO ALL:

I don't know why I didn't do this earlier,
I have created a SELF EXTRACTING version of the "Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar"

It takes out all of the guess work.

DL this file, extract it, allow it to extract to the default location (C:/)

It will create a "Rosetta Stone" folder in Program Files (x86) AND C:/ProgramData.

It will then copy all the files needed to run Rosetta Stone.

You will see that ALL language packs that I have are already activated.

DL whichever language pack(s) you want, as many as you want.
(assuming you have that much free space on your drive)

Extract them, they will copy all of the files needed for that particular language to:
C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/content

Go to the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3 folder.

run the "RosettaSoneVersion3" file

Click "Never register"
At the activation screen, click "Continue" 
(you can scroll through the list of languages that are activated if you wish)
Create User

DONE!

NOTE:
I have tested this on 3 machines, 2 Vista's, and 1 Win7.
ALL of the files have been scanned with Vipre 2012, and are clean.
