   I appreciate the work you have done in all your posts, they are very well done.  I have a question, and if you have answered it in an earlier post, just direct me there.  I checked many, but not all of them.

What program did you use to create these?  I want to do basically the same thing, high quality DVD rip, with separate subtitles.  Ideally it would be nice to have multiple audio tracks (movie, and commentary for instance, or multiple languages).   

Any pointers would be appreciated.   Thank you for your time."
[V],meech,2012-05-20T16:13Z,"Hi HarmlessBug.  I use a free program called Handbrake.  It is a powerful yet simple and user friendly program to use.  I would get the latest nightly build as they are always pretty stable and offer the latest features.  Go to the Handbrake forums and go to the General forum.  The first post at the top will be Nightly Builds.  Go in there and download the latest nightly.  Right now, they are in the process of changing over to a different interface which is now included in the nightlies.  But I wouldn't use that right now as it isn't very stable yet.  
When you download the latest nightly, you can do something to continue to use the old interface.  Once you open up the program, there is a button at the bottom left to view beta info.  Click on that and it will open up a page that tells you how to restore the old interface.  Here is a link to view/download a .pdf that I put together which is a guide to the settings that I use: https://www.box.com/s/7066985886fb9b34c6a0  Note that you will need a pretty fast processor as the settings are turned up pretty high to get the best quality at the best compression.  If your computer can't handle it, I can make some suggestions at what settings could be lowered first.  Handbrake should let you do everything you are looking for (multiple audio streams, etc.)  I've never used the subtitles feature.  I use vsrip and subrip to create the subtitles. If I want to embed these subtitles (or subtitles I find online), I use mkvtoolnix.  Let me know if you need any other information."

Thanks for this one"
[V],meech,2012-05-20T21:42Z,"I have all remaining seasons (3,4,5,6) plus all the specials between seasons 4 & 5.  I was able to find 4 specials (out of 5) in bluray.  So there will be 720p bluray (with DTS audio) rips.  I also encoded them at standard definition for those looking for smaller files.  Just a matter of time till all is up.  A few subtitles to rip, and then the rest should be up soon."
,supertje2011,2012-05-21T16:47Z,"Good Job :)

One question:

Can you please , please upload Doctor Who season 3 in 1080p ? 

Thank You so very much"
[V],meech,2012-05-21T23:18Z,"Hi supertje2011.  I don't believe season 3 is available in high-definition.  If it is, I don't have access to it, so apologies.  I'm about to post some high quality rips for season 3.  That will have to do for now :-)"
,userr1,2012-07-30T20:11Z,Hi meech. Could you please upload a file containing the CRC hashes of all the Doctor Who episodes you have uploaded? Do you still have those files?
,bdowell67,2012-08-12T19:14Z,Does this mean you have the option of subtitles? and that i'm not required to have them on?
