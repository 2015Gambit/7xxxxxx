,bert16,2012-05-18T05:42Z,This couldn't possibly be the entire Copy Trans Suite with all the programs included. Manager alone without the rest is some 8.4 MiB in size.

Note that this is just for ""Copy Trans"" NOT all the other suites that you can get from the site."
,bert16,2012-05-19T04:31Z,"Yes, but this is where the confusion lies. If you look at the site (as I just did), Copy Trans SUITE means the whole shabang, and this is precisely the title of your torrent. If you had simply titled it ""Copy Trans"" then OK, you win. :-)"
[H],NZPirate,2012-05-19T05:57Z,"Ok so the guy mislabeled it. I cant change the title, I'm just a helper, I'm not a master Jedi yet. Nothing I can do (no Jedi powers)    :)"
