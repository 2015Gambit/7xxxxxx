,cturtle41,2012-09-14T02:42Z,"This is amazing, but could you please do something about the resolutions? In Wide09, none of the options are actually proper widescreen resolutions, and when I try to enter one, it tells me I entered an invalid one. The best option for me still leaves about a 2 inch white bar on the right side of my screen."
,Rob_of_Rhine,2012-09-14T11:10Z,"Why did you post the whole game again and not just a patch? Just a question, not a complaint."
,Rob_of_Rhine,2012-09-14T19:05Z,"Hey man, I can't get anything to work... And the game is also now crashing, a set of instructions would be great! :)"
,Rob_of_Rhine,2012-09-14T19:46Z,"Hey sorry for so many comments but I can't even start up a game without everything crashing in this new mod, is there a fix?"
