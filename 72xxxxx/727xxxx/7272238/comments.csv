,LeGrinde,2012-08-11T06:11Z,"Great! The flutes on ""My Way"" are fantastic! And on ""It's Over""! So much more depth now, and Elvis' voice even has more nuance. Listening to ""It's Over"" now and hearing things I have never heard before! Fantastic! I hope you are still active and see these comments. I am a loooong time Elvis fan. It takes a lot to get me to appreciate this album again, but you really revealed a much much better album than I thought was there!"
