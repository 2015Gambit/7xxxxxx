This classic work covers all of the major movements in literary studies in this century. Noted for its clear, engaging style and unpretentious treatment, Literary Theory has become the introduction of choice for anyone interested in learning about the world of contemporary literary thought. Those new to the subject of literary theory will find this book both a resource rich with historical tributaries to explore as well as a welcoming invitation to the practice. Eagleton offers an excellent overview providing any number of handles with which a novice might take hold of the scholarly exploration of English and thereby develop his or her own personal method of inquiry. Phenomenology, Hermeneutics, Reception Theory, Structuralism, Semiotics, Post-Structuralism, and Psychoanalysis are the main areas of focus. The writing is clear and at times quite funny.
