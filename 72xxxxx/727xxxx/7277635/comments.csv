,jinqx,2012-05-19T13:12Z,"Thanx maximersk for the up and Hive-CM8 for the hard work.
This is by far the best copy out at the mo,I agree with previous reports on quality.
Excellent TS"
,.Leto.,2012-05-20T09:26Z,"I agree, this release is better than the one that's being downloaded the most. Picture is smoother and clearer here."
,Jawshewah,2012-05-20T17:18Z,"While I agree that this is the best version out, it's still not very good. I have no idea how anyone can rate this a 9, when that's DVD quality. This is nowhere near that level.

Thanks to the uploader anyways."
,segascream,2012-05-20T17:52Z,"@Jawshewah- the rating system is not overall quality of the film, but quality based on the category it's in.  This is a TS, so it's not going to be the same quality as a DVDrip or BRrip, and anybody who expects it to be is an idiot.  That's why each source is/should only be graded against similar examples of the same source.  That way a TS is only being judged against other TSs, DVDrips are only being judged against other DVRrips, etc."

That's cute but its not how it should be.

If you say that a chick is good-looking, you don't say she's good-looking for a fat chick...

,JaZzY2010,2012-05-23T10:40Z,"@segascream

What are you talking about? you rate a movie out of a single standard! Not as a TS, CAM, BR, DVD etc"
,zmogusnr1,2012-05-23T15:52Z,"Nope you rate what the quality is on HD standarts

Not a HD? Too bad bro.

All of you comparing this against DVDrips and HD are a bunch of whiny, spoiled brats. Back in the day getting a movie in such quality so soon after release was nigh unheard of. Be grateful for what you get or quit your bitchin'.

,patrik_2345,2012-05-25T15:45Z,Slow as fuck. I've been downloading this for at least 3 days and it's not done yet. 3kb/s ...

,bitchndog,2012-05-26T02:25Z,Help guys T_T I streamed it and I don't know how to make it stop streaming. it slows my download speed to 14 kbps T_T halp please. and VERY NICE QUALITY. best pirated version of this movie. but the sound is too silent

It's definitely watchable. But if you want to maximize the watching experience, then I suggest wait for the Dvd/BluRay Rip. "
,ReVaQ,2012-05-26T17:18Z,"A/V: 7/5

Not watchable, pixilated and dark. Wait for a DVDrip!"

,PlumBastard,2012-06-06T16:41Z,best till date.. ;-)
,.Leto.,2012-06-22T18:05Z,"I've watched this again yesterday and really enjoyed it, best action movie ever! Really good sound quality, powerful for a TS, dialogues are perfectly understandable. Audio goes off sync for a few minutes during the last part of the movie but it comes back to normal quickly so no big deal. End credits are cut so you won't get the extra scene.
No idea why it's a shitty version of this awesome movie that's being downloaded the most. Having downloaded both this one is clearly better."
,Kinectd,2012-07-01T17:39Z,"Downloaded samples, rating for a cam:

A: 7

Perfectly watchable, at least the 2 samples. Can't wait to watch this!"
,lillenkk,2012-07-07T03:14Z,NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! FFS
