Video:
I took the proper chinese cam for source video - thats the one that also got tagged r6,
It had full chinese subs hardcoded, but video is running smoother than on the first one,
also didnt have the logo in the lower right corner.
the subs are only partly in the video so just cropped couple lines - nothing major.
video had a lot of noise in it, which i removed for good and added slightly sharpness back
colours were nice, a bit dark perhaps so made it brighter.

Audio:
For the Audio i took the Dragon Line, which was awesome, honestly the best line i got so far,
nothing much to do, just the usual cleanup. synced the line from scratch on to the Video,
so its "lipsync" now all through, you know i like it that way. wasnt that complicated took me
around 3h. had no audio for the first 10sec of the logo, instead of silence i made a
audioloop for that.

Notes: there are around 10 lines at the 12min mark, which would require english subs,
since i dont speak chinese and the custom subs that are on the net are google translated
i cant use them, but thats no biggy

All in all a nice quality release with nice video and nice audio,
wont get better than this till r5 date
enjoy.
