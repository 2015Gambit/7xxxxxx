,sebolito,2012-05-15T00:39Z,seeeeeddd!!!!
,thedouce69,2012-05-15T01:31Z,Please seed this somebody... anybody.
,Omapapa,2012-05-15T02:12Z,I am seeding! but i've just put it up a few hours ago and my upload sucks.. so i guess it's gonna take a while till it is fully seeded..
,joaolonas,2012-05-17T13:33Z,"third day downloading it..finally reaching 80.porcent but again no seeders just leechers ..lots of them, but even united we wont stand a chance. camon...one seeder only would make so much diference!"
,trublaze,2012-05-17T15:04Z,"same, been stuck at 81% now for awhile. Still chugging along slowly but I've already uploaded 60+gb"
,GrunnyRiku,2012-05-17T18:30Z,"I am downloading now. Will seed forever! Even if i end up disliking the gane, will still seed."
,Omapapa,2012-05-17T21:35Z,"@trublaze and joaolonas: sorry guys! my upload speed really sucks! I am seeding.. but my upload speed really sucks! please help me seeding this!
@GrunnyRiku: thx mate! i need help seeding this!!"
,saucebawse,2012-05-17T22:04Z,"can i make a request??

deus ex human revolution now on the mac appstore"
,gmodm1,2012-05-18T01:49Z,I really hope this works on my mac
,reatha1,2012-05-18T03:05Z,pleaseeeeeee seeeed
,gmodm1,2012-05-18T06:46Z,"98%, one last push"
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T06:59Z,"Also a good Idea is to have DHT and Peer Exchange enabled as there are 150 seeds available then.. whereas without those you get 2 seeds from torrent trackers only.. 

@saucebawse: I'll have a look.. usually I buy games n stuff once there is a special offer on the store (almost all have an offer during at least one or 2 days some are even free for that offer) My guess is though that somebody else will share that game since it is way more anticipated then darkness 2"
,gmodm1,2012-05-18T07:54Z,"@Omapapa How do you do that, sorry, I'm a noobie at this"
,Darque666,2012-05-18T08:33Z,I have a request: The Witcher? Don't know if it's in the Appstore but I'm looking forth playing that one....
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T10:08Z,"@qmodm: Use ÂľTorrent it automatically has DHT and and Peer Exchange enabled!
I think also Transmission has those settings by default.. 
If you use a different client, check out your Settings.. I stopped using Vuze a long time ago (which would be the only other client more or less recommendable) but I guess (if you use this one) that you can enable both settings in your preferences..
@Darque666: I don't think that there is a mac version of the witcher (can't tell for sure now.. ) but I do have the windows version of that game (both parts) but you find those here anyways.."
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T10:15Z,"I personally wouldn't recommend Vuze though, because it needs Java Run Time to be installed on your system.. and Java sucks monkey balls, as it puts your system continuously at risk with several flaws and vulnerabilities as we have seen with flashback trojan.. also a hack where another user can execute arbitrary code outside the sandbox, if he is in the same or in a sub net with your mac computer, is possible if you have Java installed.. I DON'T LIKE THAT X)"
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T10:37Z,"Apple may be as greedy and evil as anybody else in the commercial IT-world, but nevertheless they are trying to sell a ""perfect"" product, so there is a reason for why Flash and Java have been removed by default from their OS..."
,joaolonas,2012-05-18T11:25Z,"Hi Omapapa! finally 100 porcent and seeding.
But it asks me the password for a certain ID apple user name..
What to do?"
,joaolonas,2012-05-18T11:29Z,"It asks for a password mate. Other than that i am seeding and i am not alone.
Thanks !"
,totesmcgotes92,2012-05-18T11:47Z,requires a password for mac app store
,didi.mozhi,2012-05-18T11:58Z,plz seed
,Gekkieaap,2012-05-18T12:03Z,So its need to be cracked
,muffbuffer69er,2012-05-18T12:30Z,"yes it needs a crack to work people !!!!!!
WHAT A FUCKING WAIST OF TIME AND INTERNET "
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T12:43Z,try logging out from your apple ID before starting the game.. I tried it on my beta install of Mountain Lion to be sure.. there i am not connected to the AppStore..  strange..
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T12:45Z,Also my Mountain Lion install is not connected to the internet.. that might be needed as well (to not be connected to the internet when starting the game)
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T12:52Z,I could of course also try to make a torrent with the User/Library/Application Support/The Darkness II folder.. that might help.. 
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T12:52Z,tell me if you get it to run when offline.. if not I will upload the folder
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T12:56Z,"Please let me know if you get it to run when offline, if not I will upload that folder.. which should be downloaded in no time since it is very small in size... "
,trublaze,2012-05-18T13:15Z,nope. Even when disconnected and signed out it still asks for ID 
,trublaze,2012-05-18T13:17Z,nope. Even offline and signed out it still asks for ID
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T13:20Z,"OK try this here:

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7277810

sorry for the inconvenience... "
,joaolonas,2012-05-18T13:20Z,"Not working offline.
lets be nice muffbuffer69er.. 
so Omapapa that folder might be the solution then?
thanks"
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T13:34Z,"@joaolonas: I very much hope so, but can't confirm, will try more stuff (if not working) this weekend.. please be patient, in the worst case scenario, I might come up with a working crack this weekend.."
,muffbuffer69er,2012-05-18T13:38Z,there is one version that works (macosx-moneys)
,trublaze,2012-05-18T13:44Z,Yup not working even with the system files. Bummer :(
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T13:52Z,"@joaolonas: I very much hope that it does, please confirm if it does/or doesn't. so I can try to make a crack if needed this weekend"
,Omapapa,2012-05-18T13:53Z,WELL THAT CERTAINLY SUCKS... WELL BE PATIENT. I might come up with a solution over the WE
,joaolonas,2012-05-18T14:29Z,We will be holding the lines and waiting for ur plan of atack.
,thedouce69,2012-05-18T19:53Z,So after almost a week of downloading I now find I need a password you could have said that from the start.  This torrent should be deleted and the uploader shot in the head and you call yourself a pirate.
,trublaze,2012-05-18T20:16Z,He tried to do a good thing. Get the fuck off his back 
,Yamcha67,2012-05-18T21:19Z,"This doesn't work.. Finished downloading it, it asks you for Mac App Store login details, and when you enter them the game doesn't launch..

So It's not cracked.."
,Siempoko,2012-05-18T21:48Z,"I did the steps and before i opend the game i put the folders on the right place, then I tried to open it but i have to activate is with app store, and i think your name was standing there! so with your password i could play the game i think but i think you don't want to give your password so it sucks :("
,Cpat2971,2012-05-19T05:40Z,i think it has a problem on the reciept..but im not sure about it..
,Siempoko,2012-05-19T09:08Z,I think we just need a crack
,didi.mozhi,2012-05-19T12:38Z,Omapapa: plz create a crack
,Siempoko,2012-05-19T20:18Z,yes pls
,didi.mozhi,2012-05-20T03:07Z,I am really looking forward to playing this awesome game
,Siempoko,2012-05-20T09:03Z,me2
,Omapapa,2012-05-20T09:21Z,"Yeah.. I was trying to do something this weekend, but so far without success.. I was hoping for a simple solution since it is actually a Windows application in the content of this app (using cider to port it to mac).. but the whole activation process is unfortunately different to the windows version, meaning that it is coupled with the apple ID, so it is a bit more complicated than I thought, and  I would need some help to get it cracked.. which sucks.. coz the only person I can think of, has no time at all for this.."
,Siempoko,2012-05-20T09:54Z,ok :(
,didi.mozhi,2012-05-20T11:03Z,try to do it soon. ;)
,VsDbIb,2012-05-22T12:10Z,any luck with the crack yet?
,didi.mozhi,2012-05-23T13:38Z,I think he gave up
,Siempoko,2012-05-23T18:01Z,I don't hope so
,didi.mozhi,2012-05-26T03:52Z,he quit
,muffbuffer69er,2012-05-26T09:46Z,"there is a working copy on, mac app fans, forums !!!!! google it !!!!!"
,Siempoko,2012-05-26T15:16Z,muffbuffer69er!?! I can't find it :(
,DEATHMITE,2012-05-27T13:59Z,"Apparently we need your iTunes password for it
when you open it up it says log into:
pull0betty@me.com 

DISAPPOINTED >:("
,DEATHMITE,2012-05-27T14:05Z,HEY WE NEED A PASSWORD SO CAN U TELL USIT THEN CHANGE IT THE NEXT DAY!
,didi.mozhi,2012-05-30T11:02Z,guys its time that we forget about this torrent 
,joaolonas,2012-05-31T15:16Z," Ok guys, lets all jump to this link http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7314684/The_Darkness_II_1.0.8032_[Cider]_(FULL_WORKING_AND_CRACKED) and say thanks to muffbuffer69er.
