,hooplah123,2012-06-10T12:52Z,"I downloaded it, mounted it, and installed it already.  I don't know what you mean by copy the things inside the skidrow to where I installed the game.  Does this mean that I should literally copy the files into the folder I made for the game?  I tried this, and then ran the game.  It started up, but then stopped at the loading screen and I got an error saying, ""portal2.exe stopped working"" then it starts checking for the error.  Also, the files that I moved were the files off of the mounted disk, not the one off the disk.  Any help is appreciated, thanks!"

,Kozuka7,2012-07-24T13:08Z,"To anyone having the problem where it locks up during the loading screen. You placed the .dll files in the wrong location they should be in the portal2/bin folder not the bin folder... so if you installed in default it would be 
C:Program Files (x86)ValvePortal2portal2bin

not C:Program Files (x86)ValvePortal 2bin"
