be sure to seed for as long as you can, so that other people can get this great artbook as well.

also, if you really like this book, and have the possibility, I encourage you to buy it.
I intend to as soon as i can, for sure ^^"

Very considerate of you.
I've seeded until x2 ratio and will continue seeding at low speed until x10, I hope that helps.
So much things to seed you know :P"
