National Geographic: The Best of Lisa Ling 
National Geographic Ultimate Explorer host Lisa Ling travels to the far corners of the globe to seek out adventure and address some of the most topical issues of the day in this collection of memorable episodes from her weekly National Geographic Channel program. From travelling overseas to investigate the motivation of female suicide bombers to exploring American prison culture and travelling to Nepal to meet with two dedicated doctors who bring the gift of sight to one of the most remote regions of the planet, there's no assignment too dangerous for Ling, and no issue too tough to tackle.




3)  Chinas Lost Girls 
National Geographic host Lisa Ling examines the consequences of China's two-decade-old, one child policy designed to curb the country's exploding population. Due to cultural, social and economic factors, traditional preference leans toward boys, so girls are often hidden, aborted, or abandoned. As a result, tens of thousands of girls end up in orphanages across China. Today, more than one quarter of all babies adopted from abroad by American families come from China-and nearly all are girls. Ling joins some of these families as they travel to China to meet their new daughters for the first time. Along this emotional journey, she shares in the joy of these growing families and also witnesses firsthand China's gender gap, its roots, and its possible repercussions.
