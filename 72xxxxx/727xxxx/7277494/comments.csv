,xeatsa,2012-05-18T20:14Z,what exactly i gotta tweak? cuz it downloads just fine from other trackers. Its always problem with piratebay.
,xeatsa,2012-05-18T20:26Z,this tracker definetely sucks... speed is damn stone age something. Why is nobody seeding right? Is it so hard to keep seeding ?

I am stuck on 92% for long now."
[V],scene4all,2012-05-18T23:51Z,"I don't see why ur not able to connect to the peers that have completed the download, at least if your not connecting to them you should be able to connect to me, coz i have uploaded over 328 GB on this torrent alone, and I'm still seeding it!"
,_antongirdeux_,2012-05-19T01:15Z,"be patient, people... :)"
