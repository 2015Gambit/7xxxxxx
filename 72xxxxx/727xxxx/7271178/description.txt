When Mick Thorne is paroled and released from prison, the only thing on his mind is getting to the city of New Covenant and fulfilling a promise. But his hardass parole officer won't let him leave town, and Mick finds himself washing dishes in a diner for another ex-con. Eventually, though, he manages to slip his leash and get to the big city, where he quickly finds himself neck-deep in trouble with a local crimeboss, King Silver. You see, Mick's there to deliver a message to the sister of his former cellmate, Doug Orten ΓÇô the man's final words after taking a shiv meant for Mick - and that message may be a clue to the location of a cache of money that Orten stole from King Silver. Needless to say, Silver wants his money -  and so do a lot of other folks.
