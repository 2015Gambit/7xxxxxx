,johnpaulmathew,2012-05-17T09:37Z,"Best print available on tpb as of now. I have downloaded almost all of the avengers cams but this one beats them all. Great thing is audio is really good in this one.Well i havent watched it fully but so far so good. Video is bit dark but nothing to complain about. Overall a very good cam totally watchable with good audio.

,DxDan,2012-05-17T09:47Z,bad copy that is not worth downloading ..
,Night_Creature,2012-05-17T10:18Z,"A:9
V:7

Nothing wrong with the quality , but the Sync is bad."
,heavydiamond,2012-05-17T10:26Z,screens look dark but clear
,bogbhoy,2012-05-17T12:57Z,"Not gonna get any better for a cam,best out there.You either watch this or you wait for a dvd rip.Vid is a lil dark in background for dark scenes,other than that its pretty damn good. A.9 V.9 (ratings based on fact its a cam) Great job uploader, cheers."
,bogbhoy,2012-05-17T15:13Z,"the film itself is the same old rehashed superhero movie,same jokes,same story,with just more characters.exactly what you'd expect really,good for kids but a far cry from the likes of the dark knight. quality of the cam tho is really good. cam 8 overall, movie 5"
,sumo955,2012-05-17T19:04Z,"How do i download the movie guys ?
Installed utorrent and the plug in then what Heromaster?"
,HOCKEYxxPLAYA,2012-05-18T01:18Z,"DxDan, Shut Up Please.

Personally, I think this is the best copy out there for now until DVDrips come out. 

Thank you HeroMaster for the amazing job.

A:10

,vreyhr676y,2012-05-22T01:12Z,"If the sync is bad then is a crappy copy, another failure release by HeroMaster, do it properly or not at all, there is enough crappy copies outthere, yes a bunch of morons that write: ""ENJOY!""."
,bigd198402,2012-06-16T12:05Z,"this has the ending credits in it. i was looking for it for a long time and finally got to see it. like all the cams for this movie are dark this one is as well. the detail is alot better making this one the best i've seen. thanks Heromaster. i'll be watch out for more of your work cause if it looks this good i'l be downloading from you for now on.
