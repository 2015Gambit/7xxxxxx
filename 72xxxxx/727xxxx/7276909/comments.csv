      Thanks for all the great downloads. I was wondering why on this one show is it one week behind. Normally they are right on line with the networks. Last week 6/14 was on the air but 6/13 was being uploaded. This week 6/15 is on the air but 6/14 is being uploaded. Can you help with this problem?  Thanks John  johnsolgot@yahoo.com"

What the HELL is wrong with all the uploaders of Rules of Engagement ??

IF this is the one aired May 17, then it's Episode 15, NOT 14, and it's called Audrey's Shower .

,xViviDx,2012-05-19T02:37Z,vtv tvteam ettv are just the uploaders. they dont do the encoding according to some site on the news of the change to mp4. they have no say in its encoding there for they would just upload what they are given. the fault would most likely come from the encoder
