,macwtf,2012-05-28T11:40Z,"Thanks tonyisaac for uploading a watchable version of what happened. 
Nonetheless,  what Cub666 said about Caesar and Donna Campbells book ""Wrecking Crew"" is absolutely correct. There's far, far more truth in it than the TV series but as Chopper Read said ""Never let the truth get in the way of a good story"". ;-)"
