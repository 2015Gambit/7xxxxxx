[T],drock232,2012-09-09T16:47Z,"No sir, it's not crap. I have been seeding 24/7 the only issue is it's only a 5.0mb connection. I had to downgrade.(Money troubles, no one gives us people that upload torrents. For the blockbuster subscription I have.) I had to down grade to the 5.0mb plan and since I am seeding over 700 torrents it's just slower. Be patient my young grasshopper don't leave ignorant comments on my torrents. Once I move at the end of September I will be using Comcast's 50mb bandwidth and they don't have a bandwidth limit, stupid monkey."
