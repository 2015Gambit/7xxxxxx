Also includes my Greatest Hits Collection.. with this little set up very nice to store anywhere!.. 

Every .torrent made has a Hash Code and it's that written hash code that is used in this desktop. When you place the hash code (copy hash code from any torrent site as most torrent sites provide the hash info and then you paste the code into the box where it says "Place Torrent Hash Here" you then can add Trackers (Optional) but because torrents are tracked by a central DHT you don't need to) and then select "Get Torrent" and uTorrent or compatible client will appear and then press "O.K." 

Also available thegoodforum.com for another way of downloading.  

Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
