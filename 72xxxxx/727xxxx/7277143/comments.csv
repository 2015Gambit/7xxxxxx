What do I do?"
,Crusisx,2012-05-30T23:45Z,there is no password required if your referring to your adobe login then you needa make an account and sign in if your struggling please go to youtube and search for Adobe After Effects CS6 Download and Install For Free 64Bit Only Sorry click the first link you see or search for CrusisxSoftware and click one of the videos then scroll through my videos and look for the one on how to get after effects cs6 for free and follow the tutorial hope that helps
,psynr,2012-05-31T14:12Z,does this work on windows 7 32 -bit?
,Zanmann,2012-05-31T17:55Z,"@Reeseboy

I got the same problem with not letting it install because its not authentic / counterfit.

Tried 3 times and said the hell with it!"
,NYTropix22,2012-06-01T23:16Z,"Im a noob, and I was able to install this just fine...You folks need to read instructions better..."
,cbr150,2012-06-02T03:25Z,where's the sn??
,ExplosiveCheese,2012-06-03T13:48Z,"I've installed Adobe software like this before and cracked it just fine.

Install it as a TRIAL, then sign in if it asks. Then once it is installed, copy amtlib.dll to 

C:Program Files (x86)AdobeAdobe After Affects CS6

(Or the respected folder, I'm not too sure as I've only done this with photoshop)

Then, open after effects and close it several times to verify that it isn't asking for a serial.

Not difficult."
,4ourD,2012-06-06T21:36Z,I tried to install it 3 times and it keeps saying it can only be installed on 64 bit. 
,Crusisx,2012-06-06T22:17Z,"@4ourD
ya i deeply apologize i said it was 64bit and 32 compatible but turns out its like aecs5 was only 64bit compatible again that would be the uploaders error that being me, I will be sure to do more research before jumping to conclusions for next time "

,chapter81,2012-06-19T00:42Z,"YO EVERYBODY:

It installs correctly, but the CS6 Suite has a small problem.

When installing your Adobe CS6 software, DON'T PATCH IT BEFORE OPENING THE PROGRAM.

Install it as trial, then RUN the software the first time...CLOSE IT and replace the .DLL file.

Why do that? Because the first time you open it, it registers as a trial with ALL functionality. Photoshop won't be Extended if you patch it BEFORE first run. After Effects won't render to MPEG2 if you patch it BEFORE first run.

So: UNINSTALL IT (check the option ""Remove preferences"") and RE-INSTALL IT, RUN IT AS TRIAL AND ONLY AFTER FIRST RUN, CLOSE THE SOFTWARE AND PATCH IT.

SPREAD THE HINT! PEACE!"
,chapter81,2012-06-19T00:45Z,"I recommend the uploaders to incorporate this hint until the problem is solved (if it's going to be solved, I mean).

INSTAL -> FIRST RUN AS TRIAL -> EXIT THE PROGRAM -> REPLACE .DLL FILE.

Not doing so (patching before first run) will deactivate some functions.

Spread the word!"
,tylerawesome,2012-06-19T17:43Z,"when i replaced the dll in the support files, i ran the program and it says this ""The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b). Click OK to close the application"" please help :("
,Crusisx,2012-06-19T18:56Z,"@tylerawesome
Go to Start> Run> Type in cmd> hit enter
type in this in your command prompt ""chkdsk C: /R"" without quotes then hit enter after that it will scan and fix errors this might take 2-5hrs so you might want to play on your 360 or what ever while that is doing its work when done reboot your pc and try after effects again if problem persists comment back

-Kind Regards-

,mrevilgaming,2012-06-21T02:38Z,"English;
