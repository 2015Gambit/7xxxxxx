,k8bit,2012-05-25T07:15Z,"EinDeutschMan! Let me start by saying thank you so much for all your hard work! You rock!

I got both this pre-installed german pack and the Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 pre-installed exe, and I followed your directions (to the best of my ability.) When I open Rosetta Stone, it never gave me an option to ""never register"". Instead it just takes me to a screen where I have three options: Add Language level, Remove Language Level (grayed out) and de-activate products. If I click add a language level, it asks me to insert a disk.  What did I do wrong? I'm assuming something with the German, but the Program Files (x86) copied over flawlessly, so I'm lost. Thank so so much in advance!"

Awesome UL Sir. I started this yesterday and it worked with no issues whatsoever. I had no problems extracting any files, no problems find said files once they were extracted and it works just fine. I'm half way through Level One Lesson Two after starting it yesterday and am quite thrilled.

I'm also working on getting your Spanish (LA) UL and I'm keeping my eyes peeled for Russian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Gaelic, 

Current plan is to one day be able to at least hold a conversation in each of those listed languages.

Keep up the good work Sir."
