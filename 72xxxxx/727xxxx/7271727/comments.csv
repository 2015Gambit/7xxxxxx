,kubrick,2012-05-15T11:06Z,Why 256? The size difference between this and 320 wouldn't be that significant and I see no other reason to go with less bitrate.
,Flyfisher61,2012-05-15T12:34Z,Thanks!
,thejoltman,2012-05-15T12:51Z,"Actually, 320 wouldn't have been any better since these are just transcoded from iTunes anyway. Could you post the original iTunes m4a files? At least for the bonus track?"
,person66,2012-05-15T22:46Z,"Yeah, iTunes only downloads them at 256kbps, so I didn't see the point in making a 320 MP3.

Anyway, here is the torrent with the original itunes files: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272640/"
,metalman390,2012-06-01T15:09Z,"i cant hear the difference between 320 and 128, i'd rather have the files in 128 but nobody uploads them like that anymore"

If you want them lower to save space, why not just resample it yourself? Mind you, that would mean re-encoding the audio file, so if you start with an audio file that uses lossy compression (Such as MP3) then you will obviously lose a bit of quality. Not much you can do about that unless you have the original lossless files (which iTunes does not provide, unfortunately)."
