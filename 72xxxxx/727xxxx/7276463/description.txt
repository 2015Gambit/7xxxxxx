Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday, May 17, 2012 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with former FBI translator and founder of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition, Sibel Edmonds. Her allegations of misconduct within the FBI following the attacks of September 11, 2001, came to the attention of the Senate Judiciary Committee and led to a call for an independent audit of the FBI's translation unit. She subsequently gave sworn testimony accusing current and former members of the government of treasonous activity. Edmonds is the subject of a documentary, Kill the Messenger, and she hosts a website, Boiling Frogs. The FBI has attempted to prevent the publication of her book, Classified Woman: The Sibel Edmonds Story. 

Alex also covers the Obama impeachment bill, calls for a more invasive and "tougher" TSA, and the continued government crackdown on raw milk.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
