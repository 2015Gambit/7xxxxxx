First torrent.

Was in the church of scientology the other day.

This is what I bought.

Don't fuss about that. All of the "workers" at the place are volunteers, they spend a lot of their time waiting on people like me to buy their stuff.

Seems pretty cool, but it doesn't seem like many pirates have it.

Disk one of Two.

Link for the other will be posted shortly, after I've seen that this torrent is working.
