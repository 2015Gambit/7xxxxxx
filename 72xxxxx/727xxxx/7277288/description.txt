Matthew Nudds, Casey O'Callaghan | 2010 | 277 Pages | ISBN: 019928296X | PDF | 2 MB

DESCRIPTION:

Sounds and Perception is a collection of original essays on auditory perception and the nature of sounds - an emerging area of interest in the 
philosophy of mind and perception, and in the metaphysics of sensible qualities. The individual essays discuss a wide range of issues, 
including the nature of sound, the spatial aspects of auditory experience, hearing silence, musical experience, and the perception of speech; 
a substantial introduction by the editors serves to contextualize the essays and make connections between them. 
This collection will serve both as an introduction to the nature of auditory perception and as the definitive resource for coverage of the 
main questions that constitute the philosophy of sounds and audition. The views are original, and there is substantive engagement among contributors. 
This collection will stimulate future research in this area.
