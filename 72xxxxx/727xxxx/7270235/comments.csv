,axinte,2012-07-01T14:08Z,"I got tired of fake cracks and I looked for an alternative.

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "
