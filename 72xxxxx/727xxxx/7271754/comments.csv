,Powerslave0,2012-05-20T04:59Z,Don't know how they can make a completed game when the series is only in Season 2...   There will be tons of stuff missing.
,roosterofjustice,2012-05-22T07:55Z,The books.......
,Tyclone,2012-06-29T14:36Z,There'll be heaps of stuff missing from the game of course! They'll chop the shit out of it and put them in as DLC just so you can understand the bloody narrative...what a scam Microsoft.
