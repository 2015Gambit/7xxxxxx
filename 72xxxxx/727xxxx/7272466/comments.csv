Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 20 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info/screenshots or covers,  please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum & fakes (after theyve been online at least 60mins)  thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "

1)Wrong IMDb link. The CORRECT link is:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1816705/

2) QUIT WHINING ABOUT SEEDS!!! It is your internet connection, or your PC - NOT THE AMOUNT OF SEEDS! I have a high speed connection, and I have seen full movies dl in under half an hour with only 5 or 6 seeds. 
I would suggest having your computer upgraded and/or contacting your ISP."
