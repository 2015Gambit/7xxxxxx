The title is an intentional error to correct an earlier error of the title of the torrent ASME Y14.5M-2009, which reads "NACA papers and reports collection FULL". 

The actual ASME Y14.5M-2009 is at http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7268948/NACA_papers_and_reports_collection_FULL

This torrent contains approximately 7600 research papers, reports and technical notes on aeronautics prepared by NACA between 1917-1948. 

These are found at http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/

The torrent includes an Index file to locate the desired document.

Share and enjoy this wealth of aviation knowledge. And please seed generously. 

Cheers!

Note: This torrent genuinely contains NACA papers and reports and NOT ASME Y14.5M-2009.
