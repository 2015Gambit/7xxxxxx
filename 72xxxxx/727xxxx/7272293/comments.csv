,shahidleu,2012-07-15T22:30Z,"i downloaded it in about two days and on finishing downloading, only goblet of fire and half blood prince is running and rest are all unrecognized by windows and media player.  in properties taking it show nothing 0 bites, no file format.  i am not saying fake, but for me was a 80% waste of time, so be careful."
,shahidleu,2012-07-15T22:38Z,"i tried it again and same results, now it, for me, it is 80% fake."

I downloaded this torrent and it works fine, Windows doesn't recognize the format because windows media player is shit, just like Windows Explorer so go get VLC Media Player as it plays a LOT more formats than Windows Media Player, Then retry playing it on VLC Media player and you will notice it works.
