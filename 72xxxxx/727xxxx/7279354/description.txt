   Bumboo movie is based on one simple       
   idea. Every person meets someone,         
   who screws it up and makes life           
   miserable (In the 'Bambaiyya' lingo       
   it is called as 'Vaat Lagna'). In         
   Bumboo the movie each character           
   screws someone or the others happiness.   
   Each situation is humorous and ends up    
   into comedy of errors. Bumboo is based    
   upon "L'emmerduer" which is by Francis    
   Veber.
