,fscii,2012-05-19T22:20Z,"I'm a bit confused.  I go to install this and the installer says it must be used WITH and gives its own filename.  hmmm ok.

Then I see there is also: Rosetta_Stone_Latin_Preinstalled.rar

floating out there.  I installed both as directed yet neither have an .exe file?  How am I supposed to run the program then?

I also have the 5 iso language files but none of them has an .exe file either.

So how exactly do I launch this program and use it?"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-20T05:50Z,"@fscii,

You need to read the comments again: 
""You MUST use it with the ""Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe"" file I have UL'd
If you don't, the activation process may not work right (or at all!)""

This is the comment that I included with THIS, and ALL OTHER language packs I have recently UL'd:
""This will create the following folder:
C:Program Files (x86)Rosetta StoneContent
it will install ALL necessary files to run this language pack.
You MUST use this with this file: Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe to ensure that the activation works properly.
LEARN!""

all of the files that have ""preinstalled.exe"" in their name are the ones you need to use.

The ""Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe"" is the actual PROGRAM file, 
it is needed to run ""Rosetta Stone Spanish (Spain) Preinstalled.exe""
which is ONLY the language file.

DL this:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272499/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_Preinstalled.exe

it is a self extracting file, let it extract to the default - C:/,
do NOT use any of the Rar files,
DL the language pack(s) you want, just be sure that it has ""Preinstalled.exe"" in it's name."

,eXPerience94,2012-05-23T20:08Z,How many levels does this torrent have? I installed it but I'm asking because I feel like kinda I f**ked up something while trying to save my progress by copying my Application Data from 3.3.5. 
,hellmell,2012-05-23T21:34Z,"This seems to work fine, but the speech recognition doesn't work, is anyone else having this problem?"
,eXPerience94,2012-05-23T23:59Z,I succeeded to fix my problem. It was all my fault about it. Improvisations like mine in the installation are not allowed.
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-24T21:00Z,"@hellmell,

I'm aware of the problem, apparently a few of the UL's didn't have the speech files,
When you see the UL with the words ""& speech"" in the name, that's the right one

,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-27T06:40Z,"@21285,

Yes, I'm double checking ALL of the language packs because apparently some speech file are missing.

Any of the torrents that have ""& speech"" in their name are complete.
I have UL'd the Russian, and will get to the German soon

If you are getting an error 1117, it usually has to do with your firewall

To test this, TEMPORARILY disable you firewall, and then try Rosetta Stone,
If it works correctly, put an exclusion for 
C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3/RosettaStoneVersion3.exe

You will want to block the program from the internet, 
but put in a rule to ""allow trusted outbound"" or something equivalent

Let me know"
,ajc1981,2012-06-02T21:23Z,"I installed this and ran it with no problems. However, upon scanning the files with Mawarebytes AND Microsoft Security Essentials, a Trojan was detected in one of the ""content"" files.  Be aware.  "
,EinDeutschMan,2012-06-05T20:11Z,"@ajc1981,

I'm not doubting your word, but could you give me more details, so that I can root it out, and make SURE these are CLEAN

I use Vipre 2012, and Norton on every scan

Thanks,

,lucky87,2012-06-07T09:57Z,"Hey man works great, im really excited about this. followed your instructions downloaded the actual program first, then this spanish language pack and installed no problems. I do not have a microphone for my computer so I cant confirm if the speech recognition is or isnt working, but everything else is great."
,hellmell,2012-06-07T21:27Z,"Hi,

I'm not actually getting any errors it just doesn't seem to pick up my voice. I know its not the microphone because that works fine. Is this the same problem that other people are having or just me?

How long until you upload one with speech? 

Thanks in advance."
,NineNinjas,2012-08-27T02:02Z,"@EinDeutschMan
Does this version have the Speech included with it? If not could you please upload it?"
,babatzim,2012-09-09T10:32Z,"@EinDeutschMan,

First of all a big thank you.
Knowledge is power and you definitely promote both with your work.

A little feedback:
-Preinstalled files work perfect on XP platform.
-I get a trojan alarm (like ajc1981) with Spanish (Spain). AVAST antivirus detects SWF:Malware-gen [Trj]
I wonder if this is a real trojan or just an incompatibility of the antivirus with the file.

Last, a kind request: 
Do you plan to offer any preinstalled Turkish with speech?

Best,
B."
