,baconninja,2012-05-20T17:32Z,Where is the newest ep??
,blajas,2012-05-20T19:53Z,The episode has been censored by us courts because of supposedly profanity-laced song mike jagger sung last night about the presidential elections
,blajas,2012-05-20T19:55Z,profanity-laced
,VelvetMirror,2012-05-20T21:02Z,Does that mean that there is not gonna be a release of this episode?
,syaugust8,2012-05-20T21:53Z,thanks for the upload!  oh well who cares honestly 'cause if the great will ferrell can't save this tripe (and now with kristen wiig gone) i think it's safe to say that snl is officially in the shitter!  they need to get rid of seth meyers or hire some actual competent writers so that it isn't so painful to watch.  i tried but it's just not funny anymore and it won't be until they change things up.
