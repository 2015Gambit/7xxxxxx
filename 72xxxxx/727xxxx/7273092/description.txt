Smash is an American musical drama series.

The show revolves around the creation of a new Broadway musical based on the life of Marilyn Monroe, which is initially entitled Marilyn and evolves to become Bombshell after its first workshop. As the production takes shape, everyone involved in it must balance his or her often chaotic personal life with the all-consuming demands of a life in the theatre. The series features original music by composers Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman.
