,jcarr73729,2012-05-24T09:19Z,"Thanks for the link to the ISO of this DVD-A. I've tried every possible playback and rip of this release, and in my opinion it does not work in stereo. The 'rear' channels are so heavily centred that listening in stereo loses the twin-channel separation. It's a very different mix to the stereo CD, and I can find no official release of this Quad DVD-A. The artwork is a re-work of the CD artwork. Can anyone authenicate this official release? To me it sounds like a recording off a vinyl record (Quad?), and much has been lost in the transfer and master. Either way, not for stereo listeners."
