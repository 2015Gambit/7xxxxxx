[center]Plot Synopsis:[/center]
There is an outbreak of vampire-controlled ghouls in the English town of Cheddar, and the Hellsing Organization arrives to help. Hellsing is a secret military group that exterminates the Undead. Their prime weapon and servant is Alucard, a vampire who hunts other vampires. During the combat, Alucard shoots a young policewoman named Seras Victoria. She chooses to become a vampire rather than die of her wounds, Alucard obliges in this request, and Seras joins Hellsing in their fight. Lately, Hellsing has more work on their hands than usual; a lot of new vampires are appearing for some reason.
Alucard and Seras later clash with Alexander Anderson, a warrior of the Iscariot Organization. Iscariot also works to eliminate the Undead, but they and Hellsing disagree over territory. Alucard and Anderson gear up for a battle to the death while a wounded Seras watches, and Integra flies in to take control before the situation explodes...
