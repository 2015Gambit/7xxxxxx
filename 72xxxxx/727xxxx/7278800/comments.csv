Awesome job! hey, can u tell me why the specifications of the movies show that the resolution is 1920x800?! didn't noticed any major difference in quality, but whaen I try to visualize the resolution through iTunes, it shows that this is the resolution of the movies. shouldn't it be 1920x1080?! thanks, man! keep up this incredible project!"

It's been a LONG day, so forgive the brief answer: This film is not 1920x1080 because the director chose not to produce it that way. (research ""aspect ratio"" to understand the creative and technical choices that go into why films aren't always 1920x1080.)"
