
First up, yes this is the real Tyler
Anything on this site that says From Tyler on it is really from yours truly. I dont allow my name to be used for anything unless Im the guy who wrote it, so if it says its from me then its from me.
Now for those of you who know me, you know that I live a pretty interesting (if not somewhat weird) existence.
First and foremost, the main occupation of my life is teaching guys how to be successful with women.
Ive been doing this job since I was 22 years old, basically my entire adult life.
Its an intense, high pressure, and also a very rewarding line of work.

Right off the bat my success with women skills have to be so razor-sharp that Im consistently able to obliterate peoples realities of what it means to be good at picking up girls.
Did the hottest girl in the venue just walk in with every guy now stunned and gawking at her? Im expected to be the guy who steps up to the plate.

Is she surrounded by five rowdy meat-heads who act like theyre being all protective when they really just have a secret crush? That doesnt matter. Im still expected to somehow swoop in and steal the show.

See, people dont travel from all over the world to take my programs and hear excuses. They want to see exactly how to properly meet and attract women in real life, and they want to see it done very, very well.

Does this sound like pressure??
Well believe it or not, thats actually the easy part of the job.
I always feel totally confident doing the on-the-spot demonstrations because I rely on the most field-reality-based, results-producing principles for attracting women in existence  and Ive got them totally down pat.
Its a no-brainer.
The real brain-frying aspect in what I do is a heck of a lot more challenging
