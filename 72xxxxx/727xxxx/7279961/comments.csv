Found Trojans very nicely hidden
Full of Viruses! This Dude is sitting somewhere in Yabadaba Doo Land Hacking us!!

Allow me to explain how to test Large files or Iso.

Greetings! I have been using TPB and thought I must start giving back to the community. 

Always use Virus Total for the very best in Virus Detection.https://www.virustotal.com Use Rar to create archives 30mb in size.

I use RAR to make small archives because https://www.virustotal.com has a 32mb Limit per upload.

Then I go to https://www.virustotal.com/ and upload each archive to be tested.

Very time consuming BUT YOUR 99 Percent sure your Virus FREE. Never Sure100 Percent!"
