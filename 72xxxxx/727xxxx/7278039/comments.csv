,IndigoAK,2012-05-20T15:30Z,"Great upload.  Guide is all there.

Some things to note though.  

1) As with most Brady or Prima eGuides, the conversion to PDF breaks a lot of stuff, especially if you have image smoothing turn on in your PDF reader.  

2) If you are looking for information on how to unlock all of the NPC conversations like I was, this guide has absolutely NO information on that.  It doesn't help you find all the journals either.  This seems like a huge oversight from the writers/publishers."

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "
