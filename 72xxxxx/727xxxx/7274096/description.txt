This is the last one i'll upload from these Recordings, gotta keep somthing for myself ;-)

A 1965 Soundtrack, Remastered from analog master tape by Retro-Audio. 

Originally with songs who sounds very poor and some are real good(no idea what happened at RCA that time), it was the same story on my source tape, did my very best to let is sound better, without losing some frequences.

Like to get feedback about this one, incase the sound quality, just curious.
