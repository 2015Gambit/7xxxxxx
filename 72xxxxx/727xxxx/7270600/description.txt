The Discovery Of England

Elizabethan and Renaissance expert Jonathan Bate presents a three part series examining the flowering of culture that took place under Elizabeth I and shaped our image of England forever. Famed for exploring the new world and laying the foundations of the British Empire, the Elizabethans also focused on domestic and inward discovery.

This programme was made available online in April 2012 as part of the the BBC's Shakespeare Unlocked season.
