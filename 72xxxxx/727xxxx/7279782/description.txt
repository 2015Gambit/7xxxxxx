"Survival of the Fittest"

Dean and Sam prepare for battle with Dick 
Roman. Dick's in the final phase of his plan 
and the Winchesters must team up with 
Castie, Bobby, Meg, and Kevin, the prophet, 
to stop him. However, Dick is one of the 
smartest enemies they've ever faced so it's 
a mind game to see who can keep the upper 
hand.
