Prager 20120517    2 I Got Mine

Prager H2   Dennis saw a sign yesterday with this phrase, Mitt   I Got Mine, Screw the Rest. 
 That nicely sums up the LeftΓÇÖs view of RepublicansΓÇª Whites account for the half of the births in the US for the first

Prager H1   DennisΓÇÖs computer wakeup call this morning came with a message: the way to wisdom is a loving heart.
