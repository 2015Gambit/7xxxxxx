The film is hosted by Hollywood star Dennis Hopper and is directed
by Hermann Vaske. Shot in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco,
Hopper delivers a powerful performance. Arty as you've never seen
him before, he puts advertising into perspective of popular culture
at the end of the 20th century.
Spitting colour, laughing his head off, destroying books,
Dennis Hopper sends Hermann Vaske on a mission to talk to the
greatest ad men, directors and artists to find out about the
crossover between various creative disciplines.
In a visually dazzling, wickedly funny slam of creativity and
media obsession, Hermann conducts unconventional kinds of
interviews.
