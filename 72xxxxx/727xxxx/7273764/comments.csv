,Muzikants,2012-05-17T00:52Z,THE GAME WORKS! THIS IS THE REAL SHIT!
,nytstalk,2012-05-17T01:49Z,"This is the real game! Quite good so far, but it's just me or the game is very hard to master?"
,Deborg,2012-05-17T02:44Z,Sry for late answer (was playing the game) yea it works fine .
,evan1991,2012-05-17T03:02Z,"game works fine!
nice upload azaq! "
,drakenoshway,2012-05-17T13:36Z,you cant full screen. you cant change any options. all menu's are blank. and when i try to start a game i get stuck on the character screen with multiple faces glitched all over the place. i'll wait for a crack from a group that knows what they are doing because im not gonna sit here and fiddle around with something that should just work.
,GObonzo,2012-05-17T14:04Z,game sucks bad. dont bother. VERY generic OTS console action.
,Gros_Shadok,2012-05-17T14:58Z,"Are you sure about the Hash ?
Is it a MD5 or a SHA-1 ?
Cause it doesn't match any of those..."
,Gros_Shadok,2012-05-17T15:05Z,"The size seems not enough. The version for XBOX is twice that size. This size seems to better suits the bad ""Game of thrones - Genesis"" that was released last year. I'd say it's not the RPG released yesterday but the old crappy one !"

,ShadowAU92,2012-05-17T19:44Z,"The game works, the textures are compressed though, when playing on medium or high quality they screw up quite a bit."
,Herctic,2012-05-18T03:49Z,"The sound seems to double up and lag on me, but other than that it runs perfectly for me."
,Cireagle,2012-05-19T16:53Z,"first a few facts:1st this repack is what it claims to be; 2nd it's virus free; 3d the game instals and works without problems (although I had to run the game in compatibility mode for xp..probably because it uses unreal3 engine)........Last: thank you azaq318 for your work--we appreciate it;-

p.s.: as to the quality of the game itself I'll only say try it ...and then imagine it would have been done in the assasins style..uhhh....   "
,bockers123,2012-05-20T13:13Z,"Not working, the first video plays then game shuts down"
,madanbad1,2012-06-02T13:27Z,"ok, dunno if this will work for everyone but i managed to fix blank screen the game and get it to run perfictly,,i compleatly uninstalled my pysx driver then downloaded the latest version from nvidia, reinstalled the driver from scratch,  then started the game,,it seems to have solved it for me so far,hope this will help  oh yea, and dont play the game in full screen unless you know for def your monitor/lcd tv will be ok with the res,,otherwise you  might have to reinstall the game,,but apart from that no probs for me."
