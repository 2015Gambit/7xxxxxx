Released in 1978, this still stands as some of the most beautiful electronic music ever recorded. The album is impressive enough for the inestimable technical innovation of leaders Ralph Hutter and Florian Schneider, but their formidable writing skills are also on full display. Glowing, liquid synthesizers are as expressive as a human voice in "Neon Lights" and "Metropolis". Sombre melodies and shimmering washes complement each other perfectly in "Spacelab", while heavily processed vocals provide pointed contrast in both that song and the moody title track. "The Robots" is a bold statement of intent, executed with exotic staccato melodies and skilfully deployed sound effects. "The Model" is an almost prescient glimpse at the commercial synth pop that would arise in Kraftwerk's considerable wake
