,zeflac,2012-05-18T00:38Z,"Thanks for that geokyr1969. I copied and pasted it from somewhere (i forget where). I'll paste something else as a comment in a second (not sure if I can edit it?).

Could you please let me know how the sound quality is once you've had a listen. I'm knew to this ripping/uploading lark and would appreciate some feedback.

All the best,

Trans-Europe Express (German: Trans Europa Express) is the sixth studio album by German electronic music band Kraftwerk. Recorded in mid-1976 in D端sseldorf, Germany, the album was released in March 1977 on Kling Klang Records. The album's themes were influenced by friends who suggested writing songs about the Trans-Europ Express to reflect Kraftwerk's electronic music style. Critics have described the album as having two specific themes: celebration of Europe and the disparities between reality and image. Musically, the songs on this album differ from the group's earlier Krautrock style with a focus on electronic mechanized rhythms, minimalism, and occasional manipulated vocals."
