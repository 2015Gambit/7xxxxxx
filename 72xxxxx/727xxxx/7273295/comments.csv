they always get it wrong.. but I dont know

if roll back wont it confuse things. worse are roll forwards like sons of guns.. 

always easy to rename how you want i guess

whats interesting though the first season was only 12 episodes so I can see why they think S02 end with ep12 as well.. rather then a mid season break"
,car2025,2012-05-17T16:07Z,"I guess it would be confusing, I thought it funny as well that Season 1 was 12 episodes. Common sense would make it Season 3 but leave it to the brainiacs to call it a ""New"" season. Keep the Xvids coming. Thanks Again!"
[V],psspss,2012-05-18T04:25Z,"not all shows are 24 episodes.. or 25 or 23
even that varies per season it seems

also pilot seasons are often 12 episodes

my ghost stories is like 12-14 epi per season

so using 24 is no guarantee who they are doing things at the tv chans"
