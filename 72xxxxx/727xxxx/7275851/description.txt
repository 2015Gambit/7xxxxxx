The setting is a "techno-Byzantine" Greece. A mysterious, menacing swarm is approaching. Winged creatures from the east threaten the peace of the kingdom, slaughtering anything that comes between them and their mysterious goal. 

The story follows Alonisso, a beautiful young woman that is on a journey with her master to the city of Milos. Alonisso's nightmares seem to be somehow connected to these mysterious enemies. But not even the wise Auraki seems know how.One night on the journey she has a horrible dream (that more than likely depicts the future) and is so rattled that she must be consoled by her friend Eleni.
