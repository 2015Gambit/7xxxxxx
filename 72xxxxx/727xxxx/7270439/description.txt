High School senior Luke Harris (Justin Schwan) dreams of just one 
thing... pro surfing. With his best friend Casey (Angel Cruz) at 
his side, they have two goals: surf and party! But Luke's Mom 
(Raquel Gardner) and especially Dad (Greg Carlson) have other 
ideas: pick a college and grow up! When Luke learns that a spot 
is opening up on the local surf team, he see's his big chance to 
prove to his parents that he can make it as a surfer and avoid 
being shipped off to school. Only two things stand in Luke's way: 
new-surfer-in-town Matt (Andy Shephard) who has his own eyes set 
on the surf team opening, and his Dad, who insists he give up his 
surfing dreams and get an education. When a devastating tragedy 
strikes, Luke is forced to take a hard look at his life and with 
the help of beautiful "church-girl" Emily (Kelsey Sanders) and 
his Youth Pastor (Danny Smith), he learns that there's much more 
to life than riding waves
