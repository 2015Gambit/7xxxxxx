While Attack Decay Sustain Release is the debut album by Simian Mobile Disco, James Ford and James Shaw have been here before ΓÇô before SMD, they were one half of shambling, psychedelic indie outfit Simian. On that band's demise, Ford and Shaw fostered something as a reputation as remixers and producers, tweaking knobs for The Klaxons and Arctic Monkeys. Here, though, they return to the artist's chair in their own right - and if you were one of those people complaining they couldn't hear the 'rave' in new rave, Attack Decay Sustain Release should make you very happy. Tracks like "Hustler" and "Tits & Acid" are unmistakably pitched for the dancefloor, layered constructions of wobbly bass, ecstatic analogue synthesiser washes, and rave blips, presented with a muscle reminiscent of their Parisian rave compatriots Justice. "It's The Beat", featuring Ninja from The Go Team, takes a 'keep it simple, stupid' approach to lyrical ingenuity: "You know it's the one for the treble/Two for the bass/It's the beat". And while in general, there's few signs of any remaining indie sensibilities, "Love" ΓÇô- featuring guest vocals from Barry Dobbin of Clor ΓÇô features the sort of choppy punk-funk bass that should keep the Rapture fans happy. An impressive reinvention.
