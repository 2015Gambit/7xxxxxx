This is the Natalie Dee Valentines cross stitch kit put out in 2008 by Subversive Cross Stitch. This was a limited edition kit, and there aren't many pictures of these patterns as finished cross stitches online, so not many people are doing them, or even know they are out there. So I figured, why not let people use them instead of having them just sit in my drawer? Please don't be a dick and sell these. I am giving them out in a (subversive!) spirit of crafting.

If anyone else has any trendy cross stitch patterns, please share! There are a lot of classic cross stitch patterns on here, but I have yet to see anything from more modern pattern makers such as Subversive, Steotch, The Frosted Pumpkin, Sublime Stitching, etc. There is Dirty Embroideries:


It's a Swedish artist who was inspired by Subversive cross stitch. A few patterns, some really, um, interesting stitches.

So enjoy this, stitch the patterns, and when you're done feel free to post them to Subversive cross flickr pool!
