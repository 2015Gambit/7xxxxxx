Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa Full Hd 1080p BrRip x264

The animals try to fly back to New York City, but crash-land on an African 

wildlife refuge, where Alex is reunited with his parents.


Left marooned on the distant shores of Madagascar, the New Yorkers have hatched a 

plan so crazy it just might work. With military precision, the penguins have 

repaired an old crashed plane - sort of. Once aloft, this unlikely crew stays 

airborne just long enough to make it to the wildest place of all -- the vast 

plains of Africa itself -- where our zoo-raised crew encounters species of their 

own kind for the very first time. While discovering their roots, they quickly 

realize the differences between the concrete jungle and the heart of Africa. 

Despite long-lost relatives, romantic rivals and scheming hunters, Africa seems 

like a "crack-a-lackin" great place...but is it better than their Central Park 

home?
