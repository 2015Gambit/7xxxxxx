,vivatpb5776,2012-07-06T03:28Z,I am very impressed with this .torrent. I downloaded the original .torrent back in June of 2010. The quality of Season 4 was garbage. The screen resolution of the original release is 352*240. The quality of this Season 4 release is much better. There is no embedded text within the video and the screen resolution is 512*384. Thank you uploader.
