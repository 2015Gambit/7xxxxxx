The first link apparently failed :(  

This is the 2nd of the Conquest games that was never completed or officially released.  It has a few bugs but is still playable in most areas. 

Installation:
Unzip to an appropriate location
Execute from that location
Play and enjoy

Praise and many thanks to whoever tweaked this to fill in the missing parts for acceptable playability.
