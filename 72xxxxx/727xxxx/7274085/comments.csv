,Mutha111,2012-05-18T16:40Z,So why is there wmv and mp4 is that HD and SD?
,shallow2,2012-05-18T20:05Z,"Hey @Mutha111. Both the WMV and MP4 are in the same resolution, 720p HD. But the mp4 is higher bitrate which means higher quality. I and many others wit hfast download and much storage capacity prefer quality over size (heck I keep both to satisfy you guys :) ) but many ppl prefer the smaller wmv both for download time and storagespace.

After filelist is downloaded just select 'do not download' if there is one of the files you dont want."
