Former yakuza and fulltime mercenary Shozo Iwaki (cult actor-director Tak Sakaguchi) returns home to Japan when his gang boss father dies, but is seriously wounded when he seeks revenge. Shozo regroups for another try – but this time he’s got an M61 Vulcan cannon and a rocket launcher hidden in his cybernetically-replaced limbs! Expect blood, brains and naked body parts to fly as Shozo takes on the Death Drop Mafia as the ultimate Yakuza Weapon. Co-directors Sakaguchi and Yamaguchi are not unfamiliar with gleeful, hilarious, over-the-top genre excess, having teamed before on the cult action-horror-comedy Battlefield Baseball.
