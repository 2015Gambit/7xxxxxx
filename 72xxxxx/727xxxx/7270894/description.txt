Choker is a hardboiled noir fable, set against an unconventional backdrop. Johnny ΓÇ£ChokerΓÇ¥ Jackson, is an ex-Shotgun City police detective who lives in his own rendition of hell. His case of Alien Hand Syndrome has manifested into the most psychotic entity on the planet, heΓÇÖs stuck working at a deadbeat detective agency, and heΓÇÖs engaged in a squalid and involuntary amour with an otherworldly creature that dwells beneath his bathtub. That, believe it or not, is just for starters.

But thereΓÇÖs prospective light at the end of the tunnel: a high-profile con Johnny once put behind bars is at large, and not even the cityΓÇÖs elite has been able to track the sleazebag down. The police department has offered Johnny a deal: put the rogue back in his below regulation-sized cell and heΓÇÖs got a job for life. However, it comes at a price, and itΓÇÖs one nobody will see coming. But if you want something, and want it real bad, what would you be willing to do to get it?

Choker is hardboiled detective fiction, but unlike anything youΓÇÖve seen before from this well-worn genre. The story is set in a dystopia, where crime is so rampant that the regular police force has been replaced by troops of enhanced officers, who carry brutality licenses, which allow them to violently beat suspects, on the streets in broad daylight. The city is filled with mutants and freaks, and the sex culture has run wild, with sex clubs everywhere, and 2 auto-wanking machines in the middle of the street. ItΓÇÖs grim, itΓÇÖs gritty, and itΓÇÖs an incredibly compelling backdrop to tell a story against. ItΓÇÖs a great piece of world building by McCool and Templesmith, and sets the tone for the whole story.
