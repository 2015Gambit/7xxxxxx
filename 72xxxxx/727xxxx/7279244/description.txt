Hey everyone, I really enjoy this band and want others to fall in love with them as I have.

This is the debut and self-titled album for the band Lissy Trullie fronted by Elizabeth "Lissy Trullie" McChesney on vocals and guitar. Also in the band are; Eben D'Amico on lead guitar (formerly of Saves The Day), Josh Elrod on drums, and Ian Fenger on bass.

They have a previously released LP titled "Self-Taught Learner" which is also here on TPB.

If you enjoy the album please give the band your support!

They have a few pages:

Please, please, please... if you enjoy the album try to buy it (or a shirt or something else I guess x.x)! Emerging indie artists like this need support to continue to make music for us. :D
