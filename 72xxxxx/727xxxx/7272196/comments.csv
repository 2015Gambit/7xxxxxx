enjoy the avengers is next :D"
,George114,2012-05-16T17:08Z,So how's the image quality?
,dollymadison123,2012-05-17T21:59Z,"Video is really good for a Cam. Probably the best I've seen.  I wouldn't know it was a cam.  Audio though, is echoey and sometimes out of sync for a few seconds but gets right back in sync. There's some Japanese parts that have only Chinese subtitles and Scene Set up shots are in Chinese too so, you have to guess where and what it's trying to show.  The movie as a whole is not the greatest.  The script has some holes and some of the acting is crap, but over all, ok.
This copy is VERY watchable though.  
A - 6-8/ V - 8-9 and M - about a 7
Great Job froggie!  appreicate the work"

,Chuckfist,2012-05-20T14:28Z,"No offense to chinese people but are they stupid?
They laugh at anything in this movie. A few times you can hear them laugh at non funny scenes so what the hell do they find funny? Chinese subtitles to different meanings in english?"
