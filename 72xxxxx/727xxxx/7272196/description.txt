Sources - VIDEO: SmY ....Thanks :P
          AUDIO: 26K...Thanks :P

Notes -
where to start the SMY release was misslabeled as r6.. it is very good cam for starters... on top of that the video has missing bits.. around 5mins in total... so the audio has been cut a few times to match the video... i just cannot be bothered with this anymore.... sick of the movie... the audio used was from 2 sources we had.. got the best bits out of both.. and used it... has end credits which has chinese audio...
overall cropped,resized, and denoised and filtered the video.. then muxed our synced audio to the encode and skipped through it, it is all in sync even the start added 3 samples for you guys to check... so enjoy...
