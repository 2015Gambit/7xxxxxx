,baretoof,2012-05-15T19:28Z,what u mean? its the whole show
,benqfc,2012-05-17T19:02Z,"No, This is NOT the complete version, First 14 Minutes come with Introducing the ""Judges, Top 10 Finalists , 1 Wildcard"", and the Wildcard ""The Mend"" performed ""Without You"" .......  
This version started Sam Kelly, which is the second acts of the night... "
