I have been trying to download this for an hour. I see one seed (I assume that's you), but myself, and the other peers are stuck at 0.0%.
Please don't restrict the upload rate on your bittorrent client to 0.0 Kbs"

I see there is one seed (I assume that is you). Please ensure that your Upload Limit on your BitTorrent client is not set to zero."
