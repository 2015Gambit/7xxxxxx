,kinger77,2012-05-19T16:46Z,"Hey man you always have great torrents! I have a couple!

I've been looking for the transformers ongoing run that IDW did before it branched into the two current series, Now i don't know if you do independents or not but it'd be great if you could find/post a torrent of that series!
Thanks! :) "
[T],MrDowntown,2012-05-19T21:27Z,"Not very familiar with the series, is there a volume #/title you want, what are the two current runs you dont want... one is autocracy right?"
[T],MrDowntown,2012-05-19T21:30Z,"If you search Transformers under comics, there are 2 pages of torrents, I guess what i need is more specfically which ones are not here that you're requesting, so I can see if I can find them..."
,kinger77,2012-05-19T22:23Z,"It's called ""Transformers"" and is from IDW recently, The two series currently in publication are ""robots in disguise"" and ""more than meets the eye"" which i do not need. It has a run of i think 35 issues or somewhere around that ballpark. 

Sorry for not being specific enough earlier, If this still isn't enough i'll try and find more info! 

Thanks for at least trying! :)"
