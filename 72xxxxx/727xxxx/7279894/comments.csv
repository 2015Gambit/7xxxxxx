,Dragonpup,2012-05-20T20:09Z,ty for the .avi ... its the only format that seems to work with live streaming to xbox 360 tyvm
,velcroman0001,2012-05-22T10:02Z,AVI is not the best but IT WORKS. You never know if the MKS will not always run.  MP3 and MP4 have compatability and I don't have the time or the ability to find what CODEC will run.  And let's not talk about the prople that use RAR what a waste of bandwidth.  I think PIRATE BAY should make it mandatory to identify language and download package format.
