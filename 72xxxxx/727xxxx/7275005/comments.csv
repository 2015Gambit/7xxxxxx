Protocol including alarms and lock down procedures are common place. The right snake, the wrong timing and fangs meeting flesh merits an emergency situation and the entire facility jumps into action. Yet, there are individuals who keep deadly snakes in situations without any backup. Are they thrill-seekers or just naïve? Henry Rollins meets people obsessed with dangerous snakes in “Fatal Obsession” the first episode of Animal Underworld and looks into this very question. Crazy or not, if someone is bitten by a deadly snake with no one for miles around, what really happens? It all depends on the venom.

There are ""individual"" hotkeepers who take better care than any Zoo. 

Also the ""pet"" called a dog or a cat can be more dangerous than a snake. So please make a show of that. This kind of series pisses me off."
