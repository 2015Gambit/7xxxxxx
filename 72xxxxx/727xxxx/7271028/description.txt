                            The Complete Season 9


Two and Half Men is an American television sitcom.

The series revolved initially around the life of two Harper brothers: Charlie and Alan (Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer), and Alan's growing son, Jake (Angus T. Jones). Charlie is a bachelor who makes his money writing jingles for a living and leads a hedonistic lifestyle. When Alan's wife Judith (Marin Hinkle) decides to divorce him, Alan moves into Charlie's beach house, with Jake periodically coming to stay with Alan and Charlie. Charlie's house is cleaned by Berta (Conchata Ferrell), a sharp-tongued woman who initially resists the change to the household but comes to grudgingly accept it.

In the ninth season premiere (after Charlie Harper's death) the beach house is sold to Walden Schmidt (Ashton Kutcher), an Internet billionaire in the process of being divorced from his wife Bridget (Judy Greer). Although Alan leaves to live with his mother Evelyn (Holland Taylor) after the house is sold, he is invited back to live in the beach house by Walden as he needs a friend to help him deal with his marriage breakdown.
