Although this one seems a bit out of sync when Jeremy is talking the overall video quality is way better on this on.. This one is about 1400kbs and the other one is about 900kbps with similar encoder settings.
So to summarize this video has a noticeably higher quality than the other one floating around so i wouldn't waste your time looking for the other one.."
