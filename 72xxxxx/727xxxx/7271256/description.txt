In the spring of 1945, Allied troops entered German concentration camps and made a systematic film record of the atrocities they saw. The documentary, which contains startling footage from Dachau, Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen, was left unfinished and stored in a vault of London's Imperial War Museum. In 1985, this somber record of man's capacity for inhumanity was broadcast for the first time by "Frontline" with narration by actor Trevor Howard.

LOADER'S NOTE - This documentary consists almost entirely of raw footage taken by soldiers. It is extremely stark and open, and may be difficult for some people to sit through.
