And EinDeutschMan can you upload the Preinstalled of Chinese (Mandarin) and Korean or is it possible to use the regular iso without having to use the preinstalled versions? "
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-17T21:32Z,"@Psclonewonders,

Sorry about the break in the UL, but my internet connection went down for a few minutes.

I have the Chinese (Mandarin) and the Korean already UL'ed here:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7062617/Rosetta_Stone_-_Korean_-_Level_1__2__3
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7062606/Rosetta_Stone_-_Chinese_(Mandarin)_-_Level_1__2__3

but you would need to use these 2 ISO's to set it up correctly:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035540/Rosetta_Stone_v3__amp_amp__Patch.iso
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035678/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_w_Patch.iso

That is why I created the self extracting versions, DL this:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272499/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_Preinstalled.exe

Choose your language pack(s), DL them, extract them, you're done.

NOTE:I have NOT UL'd the 2 languages you want, but I am in the process of creating and UL'ing the ""Preinstalled"" versions of ALL of the languages I have. (I have 17 or 18 left) so it may be a day or so. But I AM working on them, it takes about an hour to create each one."
,Psyclonewonders,2012-05-17T21:48Z,Thanks for the reply EinDeutsch i guess i'll just wait thanks again for the upload.
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-18T21:06Z,"TO ALL:
Apparently when my internet went down a day or so ago, it screwed up this torrent, so I recreated it, INTENTIONALLY misspelling the word ""Installed"" - ""Installd"",

Anyway try this one:
