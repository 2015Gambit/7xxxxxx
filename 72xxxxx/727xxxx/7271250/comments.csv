,jh31415,2012-05-17T13:43Z,"This is the final episode, right?  Is anyone working on a full season pack?"
,7b,2012-05-17T15:29Z,"NOTE:  Even though EZTV has failed to make it obvious in the torrent notes, this is *.mkv.  Useless to many, as it won't play  xbox - please make it obvious when using a non-ideal container format!"
,random250380,2012-05-17T18:47Z,"Thanks for the share!
@ 7b. I understand your point, though would have to say .mkv IS the ideal container for the preponderance of people on the internet now."
,nameless.twisted,2012-05-17T18:57Z,"Awesome, thanks for uploading.
I'm waiting for the season finale, haven't watched any episodes and we'll have a marathon.

Will you upload a full season pack?"
,OXAROS,2012-05-19T15:53Z,Thanks a lot
,thecommander79,2012-05-20T23:51Z,"Hey Guys, thank you very much for sharing, any chance for seasons 5,6 &7"
,Manuela89,2012-05-22T01:38Z,Episode 22 ???
,90731sp,2012-05-22T08:35Z,"@7b - Fail, mkv is fine for torrents. Most people use computers, and this is a TORRENT SITE ON THE INTERNET. Not a media manager / video game on an XBOX console. Learn the internet."
,lynx_ca,2012-05-23T16:31Z,"@ 90731sp Fail? You're telling the guy he fails because you don't use the same way to stream as he does? 
Guess what, I use my Xbox as well for streaming shows from my computer to my tv. 
The fact that you think he's downloading the shows with his Xbox and storing them on his Xbox shows how much YOU fail. 
No kidding this is a torrent site on the internet. My Xbox is a media receiver and guess what, IT'S ON THE INTERNET TOO. 
What are you? The internet police? Telling us which file formats are right or wrong?
Before telling someone to learn the Internet, take your own advice. 


@7b Thank you for that valuable information. Since AFG uploads have taken over the torrent sites there has not been anywhere near as many good quality avi's out there. "
