"Bombshell"

The big night is finally here. Tom 
and Julia race against time to save 
the show, while Derek makes a 
decision that will change the lives 
of Karen and Ivy forever. Ellis 
reveals his true colors. But when he 
finally makes his move to save 
"Bombshell," will it be for or 
against Eileen? In the midst of it 
all, another bombshell goes off - 
this one is in Karen and Dev's 
relationship.
