Note that this is a promotional damce mix arranged and orchestrated by C1TZN.X (that's me) for promotional purposes only.  This material is copyrighted by appendiges other than myself and I am merely excercising my creative commons as a DJ, possibly tapdancing in the gray area of legality with this material.  Also, It all comes on one 53 minute track.  If I had split it into separate tracks, as I have donw before, the flow wouldn't have been as smooth... so if that bothers you... sorry and too bad. Lol!!!  Enjoy, I really hope you do.  And PLEASE SEED!  An artist is nothing without an audience.
