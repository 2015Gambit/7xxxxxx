,Fabian-b,2012-05-18T12:56Z,"Movie trailer:

http://www.thetrailerhouse.net/index.php/component/content/article/10-trailers2/movie-trailers/316-journey-2-the-mysterious-island-trailer"
,blobbhers,2012-05-19T01:20Z,"I've seen some movies in my time, good movies as well as bad ones. Most movies makes sense. It's crucial for the narrative that the audience not only can relate to the events that make up the story, but that they also see the purpose of the different parts that make up the movie; the characters, dramatic stages, the basic rules of the depicted world and the cultural frame in which the movie is to be interpreted. 

Journey 2: The Mysterious Island does not make any sense at all. The plot is filled with more holes than the average Slovenian country road and the exposĂŠ is too sudden to establish contact with the protagonist, yet utterly dull. Really, if you want a lesson in how NOT to present a feature film, go watch the first 10 minutes. It's hilariously badly done!

If you need a crappy movie to laugh at, or to run in the background while hanging out with your friends, look no further! 

Otherwise: Don't download this. If you do, don't seed. This tumor of a movie most be put down."
,Opiumthoughts,2012-05-19T08:41Z,"@blobbhers Thanks for the review, I had a wide grin reading through it. I knew it was bad from the trailer but now I'm just curious on how bad it is. LOL"

,L3GiTPro,2012-05-21T02:38Z,"Just a heads up, you might wanna use png for the screens because the screens you provided look bad either because of it being a jpg, or because this is a re-encoded copy of someones else copy like YIFY which I am not complaining about, they are good quality for such as small file size, but this one being judge by the screens doesn't look to well.   This also could be a re-encode of something that was XViD but I don't know.  I will still probably download it though."
