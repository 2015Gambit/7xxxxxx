,undercover_agent,2012-05-19T12:03Z,Finally a watchable upload! Thanks!
,thegh0sts,2012-05-19T12:54Z,FINALLY! Downloading now!!
,jerseygirloooo,2012-05-19T13:50Z,29 instead of 25?  Still not enough for me to download.  I'll wait for Sunday night and record a proper version then.  What the fuck is up with this shit?  Are people getting lazy?
,IlanF,2012-05-19T14:12Z,"@jerseygirloooo you won't go any higher than that, this is the same as it's displayed on your TV.
the 25 FPS one you found earlier is the same as the 15 FPS video.."
,phantom13666,2012-05-19T15:43Z,"@jerseygirloooo Not good enough for you, eh? The scene standard is 25 FPS lol, anything more and you would not even notice it. "
,igorivanov666,2012-05-19T16:28Z,@jerseygirloooo What a diva.
,_drnick,2012-05-19T20:44Z,Audio isn't great but a big Thank You anyway!
,rocket221,2012-05-20T01:22Z,"Quality is OK. Audio is slightly out of sync.
I hope someone does a proper capture when it airs again tomorrow."

yeah it's slightly out of sync for 2/3 or so. about -100ms(j button twice in vlc).
Still a worthwhile watch!

Thanks to m-byte and igorivanov666. :)"

It was a lot smoother than the other iTunes video.  Almost as good as the videos eztv puts up."
,RedSmurf2,2012-05-20T21:06Z,"Very watchable, but still waiting for the 720p. I'm curious about the non-standard 29fps. The standard NTSC framerate and the usual framerate for MB episodes is 29.976fps. If whatever software that was used to capture this only allows integer framerates, 30fps would have made a lot more sense.
I do not notice any audio offset by the way."

Not HD (SD TV) but it's watchable if y'all are interested."
