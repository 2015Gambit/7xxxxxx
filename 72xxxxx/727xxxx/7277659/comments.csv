,Crim2k8,2012-05-25T00:19Z,"I should go into detail. The TV content rating graphic is in the corner of the screen (mostly Canadian). They're TV rips, all of them. Except for the gag reel.

Why people try to pass this stuff off as retail is beyond me."
,rayador,2012-05-25T13:13Z,I rechecked all episodes and I didn't see anything (not even a watermark) that suggest an hdtv or something different fron a bdrip. Where exactly do you say you saw the TV content rating graphic?
