@frizoky:

AR [aspect ratio]:  2.40:1 !! Cropped or not ? The original [1080p SPARKS] is 1920:800 that means  2.40:1 !! Non-Cropped !!

BUT ... bitrate too low for video stream !!

The movie has more than 2 hours long so it should be 800mb-900mb minimum! 

Quality frame =0.166 at this size? MediaInfo sais ... 0.123 Bits/(Pixel*Frame) !!!

Very well seeded torrent ...but with some quality problems ! 

The ripper should reconsider his strategy ! Good for speed...Bad for name and ....quality !!

Cheers"

,Alobarku,2012-06-12T11:21Z,"Thanks, really, for the upload.  But AVI, no matter if it's DIVX, XVID or ARSEX is so 1989!  For portability's sake (not to mention A/V quality, or modernity), EVERYBODY STOP MAKING SHITTY AVIs!!"
