Biography

NECROPHOBIC REVULSION were formed in May, 2008 in Athens, Greece, by three friends from Kalamata and Messini, Dimitris, Marios and Vasilis. In November 2008 bassist Marios M. joined the band. After few days the band played live at An Club. Initially, the music style of the band was Death/Grind and then released a promo called "Eat Your Brains" via Deathforce Records which was recorded on September, 2008 without a bassist. Few months later, Marios M. left the band and about a year later George joined. NECROPHOBIC REVULSION changed the sound to old school Death Metal and finally in October 2011 released the first full-length album called "Brigades Of Subjugation", recorded and mixed at M.I.H. Studio in Kallithea, Athens by David Prudent. NECROPHOBIC REVULSION continues playing live in Greece and gets prepared to spread the music everywhere.
