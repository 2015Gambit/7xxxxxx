Britney Spears Live - The Femme Fatale Tour (2011) - SBS 3D 1080i HDTV


Ripped from the SkyHD broadcast in Italy. Not sure when they'll release an official 3D Blu-ray. This version has a lot of new angles so even if you already have the original 2D Blu-ray, you still might wanna check this out. There are less close-ups, less audience shots and more full-body shots of Britney (= more danceney). The quality is alright, nothing amazing but it's the only 3D copy we have of the show right now.

This is side-by-side 3D. You can use Google to try and find a way to play this on your computer / TV. I myself don't have a 3D screen or TV so I used a program called Bino (Windows and Mac OS X) to play it in 2D. It's worth it cause of the new angles and edits.

Enjoy!
