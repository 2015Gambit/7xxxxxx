This scale makes no sense; so many arbitrary quality points (aka magic numbers). WTF is this, Olympic gymnastics?

Deduct points for technical errors: out of focus, cropped, skewed, oversaturated video, or clipped, popping, missing audio.

If anything, make a 5-point scale (adujusted for 10-point).

Audio is TS audio, no echo, very clean. Audio includes the starting intro, which the other mid-may TS doesn't have. Audio drifts a little, about 1/2 second by the end of the movie. This might be codec related, since skipping around seems pretty good. Calling Audio a 9.

To the other commenter, this is a CAM/TS. Since there wasn't a screener copy pre-released, there's no way you're getting a DVDRip until there's a public DVD release."

A:7... The audio is TS so it's much clearer and more audible than a cam, if it weren't for the shit video and subs this would be a much less painful upload

,boondall,2012-06-07T14:14Z,watched the movie in the theater. Better then recent superhero movies and worth watching a couple of times. movie- 8.5. Totally worth watching there rather then a cam copy. but if u can wait for a good dvd rip and watch over a big screen then skip the theater. 3d not worth it
,xo10deke,2012-06-07T16:15Z,"MrDerrrp, I Sooooo agree with you! Iron Man is by far the most entertaining. Hulk in comparison is quite dull and as for Thor, it's seems hard to look good and act well all at the same time. I did enjoy Loki's performance in both ""Thor"" & ""The Avengers"". But i'm very unhappy with what the writters did to Agent Phil Coulson. To me, he's the real hero!"

,tflagger997,2012-06-09T00:10Z,"Another person claiming HD when it is not.  So why the giant size for a good cam? Let me guess, it was upsized because that makes it better.  No actually it just bloats the size and blurs when you make it full screen.

This is not a great cam like some people are claiming.  I guess they have not seen many good cam, instead just DLing and watching whatever is ULd first.

For a Cam this is a about a 7 (V/A), and against a BR encoded down to 2GB this is a V4 A5."

,Hystrionics,2012-06-17T03:49Z,"These comments make me want to break things. Yes, the video quality is not great. It's grainy, and some of the darker scenes are hard to make out. This is because it was recorded with a camera. When it's out on DVD, you can download a higher-quality version. In the meantime, shut the fuck up and enjoy your free shit. And keep in mind that the 1-to-10 rating scale is subjective. If you really can't wait, this is certainly watchable."

It is easier to make AVI files, hence the reason why the MAJORITY of video files you will download comes in the form of an AVI file. If you don't like it, stop being a dick, and start ripping your own videos instead. There is no reason to be a jackass."

So the director of this movie, Joss Whedon, turns out to be a total socialist idiot!  (Or at least a self-serving liar who knows that the majority of the movie-going mob are jealous economically-illiterate idiots, and tries to gain their favor in spite of the fortune he is making.)  This is a big stab in the back, in particular to all those libertarians who liked Firefly / Serenity...

This is exactly why I'd wait even an extra year to pirate almost anything that Hollywood produces, rather than see it in theaters.  If pirating cost me 100x more, then I would pay 100x more, knowing that the money isn't going to those socialist scumbags who are completely detached from economic reality and are using their media power to fuck up the world!

Read real economists - it is socialism that is destroying itself right now, and free market capitalism is the answer!  Real free market capitalism respects the real Natural Rights to life, liberty, property - not the socialist construct of intellectual monopolies backed by the state!"

,Tecness3,2012-08-06T16:09Z,"For a TS torrent, this is good quality, except for a few...exceptions. In one or two scenes, you can see people (In the theater). Several scenes are cut, several scenes were cut off (As in you can't see the top half of it), and other's have their audio slightly cut. Also, random Chinese subtitles. Once again, for a TS torrent, this is good quality."
,axpendix,2012-08-06T21:17Z,gj for the uploader but sorry its almost unwatchable. 
,DiabloXxX2000,2012-08-07T01:27Z,Any word about the dvd/bluray release ?? Next week maybe ??? 
,gabriellhm,2012-08-08T20:05Z,"@DiabloXxX2000 

The BR release will be around september 25th"
,KKKDownlow,2012-08-09T01:22Z,So nobody has been able to actually put a watchable version of this up yet but they can make watchable versions of complete garbage that nobody cares about. Nice one.
,DiabloXxX2000,2012-08-09T01:27Z,"gabriellhm 

Do we have to wait until sep 25 to download it ??? Usually it takes the week before it hits the stores to able for download."

FYI: Marvel is notoriously good at keeping advance copies from getting out.... u might have to wait the week of the retail release to get a version u want"

,go.scrw.urslf,2012-08-19T07:44Z,"1) there are better copies than this one. take a few seconds to look.

2) whoever did the subtitles is an idiot who dosen't understand english very well

3) the picture is jumpy and encoded poorly.
