This book explores influential designersΓÇÖ sketchbooks as a truer reflection of a designerΓÇÖs thought processes, preoccupations, and problem-solving strategies than can be had by simply viewing finished projects. Highly personal and idiosyncratic, sketchbooks offer an arena for unstructured exploration, a space free from all budgetary and client constraints. Visually arresting objects in their own right, this book aims to elevate sketches from mere ephemera to important documents where the reader can glean valuable insight into the creative process, and apply it to their own practices. Featured designers include Ralph Caplan, Nigel Holmes, Chris Bigg, Eva Jiricna, Jason Munn, Gary Baseman, Marian Bantjes, and many others.
