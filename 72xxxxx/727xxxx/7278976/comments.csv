,bacchusduniddufaisan,2012-05-22T20:59Z,"hello bekimi07, I did not get it to work on Windows 7 64 bits version, I don't have any 32 bits, excepts for a computer with XP pro, and that works fine, no problem at all. The problem in W7
is not a install problem, install OK, but when I try to run, it tells to insert a DVD, and one made with the program, doesn't work, sorry but not much help for you."

,archey3,2012-06-08T01:29Z,"NOT Working on Windows 7 32bit SP1

I installed latest C++ re-distributional 2010 
I burned to DVD and ran install.cmd 
I selected Yes when prompted for dependencies
Files copied to hard drive OK
Downloaded AutoData 3.38 crack by crash01gl 
I ran crack.bat - successful
I run cmd as admin by pressing ctrl+shift+enter
I changed directory to cadcda2
I ran regsvr32 ChilkatCrypt2.dll - successful
I changed compatablity of ADBCD.exe to windows xp sp2

I run ADBCD.exe (also as admin) - ERROR

ERROR 1 - small box with red cross (no message)
ERROR 2 - ""please insert DVD""

This works on windows xp no problem so why is it not working on windows 7?
Someone must be able to work this out!!

If anyone could help us out we would really appreciate it!"

,YuKELito,2012-07-20T19:08Z,"Having problem with win7? Try boot in safemode, helps for some!.

Win Vista:
Install the Microsoft Visual C ++ Package 2008 thats comes on the ISO file. NOT the latest 2010 from microsoft!!!
Turn off the UAC and reboot.
Run install.cmd.
Move the crack ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7292761/autodata_3.38_crack ) into C:ADCDA2 and run. You must get a ""success"" pop-up.
Change ADBCD.exe compatibility to Windows XP SP2 and run as administrator.

Have done the installation on 3 different vista versions and it worked."
,sippea,2012-07-23T22:59Z,"I tried what YuKELito described above on Windows Vista, but it still asks me to place a CD/DVD. Is there anything I can do to solve this problem? Pleaseee?"
,aires_pt,2012-08-02T23:47Z,how about the latest multilanguage version? thx in advance!
