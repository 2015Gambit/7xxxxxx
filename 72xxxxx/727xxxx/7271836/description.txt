While teaching foreign students at an Alberta college, Wayne Magnuson discovered that he lacked a good dictionary of idiomatic English. So he compiled one. With more than 5000 entries, each with a simple definition and a clear example of typical usage, English Idioms, Sayings & Slang is an excellent primer for English learners. It's also a great reference for native speakers who want to be sure what colourful expressions like "going bananas" really mean.
