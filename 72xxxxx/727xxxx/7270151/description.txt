Relegated to the status of local legends, The Fallen Angels continued creating and performing original music in the D.C. area until the fall of 1969 when the group disbanded.

Still years after their demise, The Fallen Angels may be gone, but not forgotten. In the February '72 issue of Stereo Review, music critic Joel Vance wrote an insightful article entitled "The Fragmentation Of Rock", which analyzed the problem of developing new talent in the industry. To illustrate the overwhelming odds against succeeding, he states:

"The Fallen Angels, for example, a remarkable band from Washington, D.C., put out two astonishing albums for Roulette Records in 1967/68. But they never made it, even though they were far better than most American groups of the time."

Records by The Fallen Angels have become true collectors' items, with original vinyl LPs going for upwards of $200 each, if you are lucky enough to find one! The second album has even been bootlegged in Europe, where there has been a resurgent interest in authentic psychedelic music.

The unique music of The Fallen Angels would have remained shrouded in myth had it not been for the efforts of Collectables Records, who made special licensing arrangements with Rhino Records to digitally reproduce the original master recordings (which fortuitously had been stored in the vaults at Abbey Road Studios ).
