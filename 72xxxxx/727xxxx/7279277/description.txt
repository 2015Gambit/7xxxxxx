Join the BBC archive for a night with Barry Manilow.

A mixture of songs, interviews and rarely-seen documentary footage offers a glimpse as to how the great American crooner's career has evolved on screen for more than forty years. Classics such as Mandy, Copacabana and Could It Be Magic were played to millions of viewers first time around and are revisited in clips from Top of the Pops, Parkinson and various filmed shows including his pivotal open air concert at Blenheim Palace in 1983 - it's a miracle!
