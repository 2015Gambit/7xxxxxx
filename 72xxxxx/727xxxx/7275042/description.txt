As with all Rifftrax movies if you want the original theatrical, re-mastered, or re-re-mastered Blu-Ray version of this Star Wars movie then this is not the torrent you are looking for...

Return of the Jedi.  For sixteen years, it was widely regarded as the worst chapter in the Star Wars saga.  We now look back upon this period of time, appalled and embarrassed at how naive we were.  For while Return of the Jedi may be slow to get started, while it may delay the final confrontation between Luke and Vader in favor of an endless Ewok/Stormtrooper battle, while it may feature C3PO as its main character for the first twenty minutes and while it may have killed off Salacious Crumb instead of making him the focus of the entire movie, consider this: nobody utters the line "Yippee".

As this is the final chapter in the Star Wars saga for RiffTrax to tackle, Mike, Kevin and Bill would like to take the time to reminisce about their favorite moments in the series.  Here they are in order: The time Jar Jar became a senator and the time Stinky the Hutt was kidnapped.  Thank you and good night.
