DESCRIPTION
The power of love can survive anything, except the spell of a very odd and mysterious watch that latches itself on to the unsuspecting. Loaded with a supposed curse that can ruin even the most intense love affairs, it afflicts the one in possession of the watch with explicit images of their mate with past lovers... and those yet to come. The sexual hauntings go deep, and the only cure is to present it as a gift to the next unsuspecting couple in love and on the verge of marriage.
