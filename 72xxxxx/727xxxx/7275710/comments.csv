,Romgun,2012-05-19T07:44Z,"1. Install ""FSX Alternative Traffic Pack for the Flight1 Ultimate Traffic"" from here 
2. Ignore the error. Close the program UT2
2. Install this update with option ""Check UT2Settings.cfg""
3. After this UT2 will start automatically.
Do u have error ?"

,virtualanarchy,2012-05-20T20:06Z,"I'll wait to download this until someone confirms it's working and that the problem mentioned above is fixed. Keep working at it though, Romgun, once perfected these extra tweaks and added realism will become a necessity for any and every flight simmer. "

,Crash2701,2012-05-23T08:25Z,"Romgun:
Don't know how you did it, basically I don't care. Lol.
It just works. Now them planes actually touch down where they are supposed to: on the runway.

Went to 5 different airports (three 3rd party and 2 default) and my FSX world is at piece again.

Outstanding work, mate! I shake your hand.

cheers ;0"
,nimshi,2012-05-24T08:15Z,"Romgun
