Included in this torrent is 23 different PDF's that contain study guide material from all advanced majors: Biochemistry, Finance, Physics, Math, Sociology, Psychology, Electronics, etc..  All for free, because I love you guys so much lol.  

I created all of the files in the 'Custom Study Guides' and here is a general description of them:

A very comprehensive 1 page (both sides) study guide that contains all material covered during the semester for a specific professor.  On the first page of the PDF there is a space on the top right hand corner for your name, and a space on the top left hand corner for the class number.  It was all handwritten in pencil originally so there is some graphite smearing unfortunately.  Ideally you would print all pages on 11 x 17 paper at the original size (at a print shop maybe, its usually pretty cheap there), then cut the paper out to the original 8.5 x 11, staple the two sides together, then hole punch both sides.  The reason for both sides is so that you can flip the guide in your binder to see one side or the other easier and faster, depending on which side you currently use the most.  Also take tape and tape both sides of the hole punches, six in total for one page, and then use a single hole puncher to make a hole again through the tape.  The reason for this is so that the paper will NEVER rip out of your binder over time.  The results of this can be seen in the scan from where I did it.  Also, if you print it out, at least the ink will never smear on you, unlike pencil.  Also keep a copy of this PDF with you on your laptop at all times.  Thanks and God Bless.
