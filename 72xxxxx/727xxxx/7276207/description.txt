This sports comedy from Class Act (1992) and Houseguest (1995) director Randall Miller stars Kadeem Hardison and Marlon Wayans as basketball-playing brothers. The Tylers have been dreaming of stardom on the court since childhood. Now that they are the top players for the Washington Huskies, Antoine (Haridson) has become the more flamboyant and attention-getting of the pair. While Kenny (Wayans) is also a talented athlete, he lacks the self-confidence to become a star like his brother. When Antoine suffers a fatal heart attack during play, Kenny is grief-stricken, and the team's chances of making it through the Pac-10 to the NCAA finals become seriously diminished. Luckily, Antoine's ghost returns to give the Huskies a helping hand by blocking shots, tipping the ball through the hoop, tripping opposing team members, and even giving players a supernatural lift on their way to the basket. Only Kenny can see his brother's spirit, but a beautiful school newspaper reporter, R.C. (Michael Michele) suspects the truth.
