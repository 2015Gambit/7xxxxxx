[V],Maherz,2012-05-14T21:51Z,"@BLOVES
To save bandwidth :)"
,roy2646,2012-05-14T22:24Z,"Maherz, thank you very much for giving me an idea that your windows xp 32 bit can be installed in a 64bit computer. I installed to two computers 64bit dual boot with windows 7 and it works so nice. Thanks again for your upload."
,press2012,2012-05-14T22:29Z,Thanks for posting. Can this be made into a live cd and if so do you know how to go about doing it with this particular file? TIA.

,jibba123,2012-05-16T05:12Z,It's asking for the Volume License Key? Is it possible to extract it from the iso?
,roy2646,2012-05-16T20:16Z,"If you will do a clean install it will not ask for a Volume License key. If you want to know the key, go to www.nomaher.com and everything is there, good luck."
,TPBxiaz007,2012-05-17T11:21Z,"+1 For Good ISO !

But Why you Don't add WMP 11"

[V],Maherz,2012-05-18T17:13Z,"You're welcome ;)

@9912rock
Use win2flash.
Google it."
,Sydrotten,2012-05-20T17:43Z,can this be installed on parallels for a mac?
,noelnyc,2012-05-20T18:27Z,Can this windows install all the Drivers... automatically....... or I have to install all the Drivers Manually.....?
[V],Maherz,2012-05-20T19:38Z,"@Sydrotten
Yes, but you will need a serial.
Use this one:
MR49R-DRJXX-M6PX2-V96BF-8CKBJ

@noelnyc
That depends on your system (PC)."
,duriotic,2012-05-21T04:27Z,"Thanks so much for these trustworthy, convenient updates of XP Pro SP3.  Several people I know are indebted to your kindness.

QUESTION:  Why haven't you (read: YOU PERSONALLY) uploaded any Windows 7 releases?  There are a few torrents by ul'ers claiming to have gotten them from you, but that breaks the trust chain.  The upload services you use on softarchive are slow, cumbersome with so many dl's, and unreliable.  We can all find Daz loader ourselves to activate, so a clean yet update slipstreamed Windows 7 (64-bit Ultimate, yes please!) from you would be so well received.

Thanks for all you've done and are still doing!"
[V],Maherz,2012-05-21T18:00Z,"@duriotic
You're welcome.
As for Windows 7, my upload speed is very bad! I can't upload to both file-sharing sites and torrent.
But it's easy, you can download from those guys who claim it's my Windows, then check with the hash to see if it's really mine or not ;)
You can find the hashes for Windows 7 at my forums.
Good luck."
,duriotic,2012-05-22T03:39Z,"Thanks, Maherz.  Now if we can just get one of your fans to upload a copy of the 64 bit version of Win 7 Ultimate, I can dl with confidence.  Anybody up to the challenge???? 

Thanks again!"
,cokebus,2012-05-22T05:49Z,"When I tried to make bootable USB via WinToFlash it comes out likes this when I boot it:

NTLDR: Couldn't open drive multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)"
,seedANDtorrent,2012-05-23T21:12Z,"Thanks brother Maherz.. شكراً :)

What's the best way to install this?

and do you suggest installing any Windows 7 version on an Intel Core 2 process with 2GB of RAM (6 year old Dell Inspiron 6400 laptop) instead? cause I have Vista on it and I'm fed up with it :)"
,D255,2012-05-25T12:26Z,"maherz;
thanks man
clean as it should"
,homard,2012-05-31T21:45Z,"My Av said that sfcfiles.dll has been modified, is it normal?"
,mbmirel83,2012-06-02T04:04Z,"So, thank you for the torrent and making it very easy to burn and install. But...most of my drives are not working. I know I have to open device manager and update them. But how can I do this when I can't even connect to the internet hard wired or wireles? Seems my network adapters need to be updated. See my dilema? What do you propose I do? Please help. "
,brunsviger,2012-06-06T02:50Z,"Why is it still been uploaded new Microsoft Windows XP Professionals SP3 (November 2011, December 2011, April - and so on) ?

If I download the latest  (May 2012) and install, do I have to make a new download in June, July, August and so on ?

Does it have anything to do with security up-date ?
Does it have anything to do refreshing of MicroS. licence ?"
,tutupa79,2012-06-06T04:06Z,"Maherz, key not working. Downloaded JUne 5th. Any idea? tks@"
,duriotic,2012-06-07T22:32Z,"@brunsviger:   No, this uploader has different versions every month because it's the same EXCELLENT ready-to-use forever Windows XP, but he adds the latest security updates so that you don't have to waste time downloading and installing them.  You can get the latest XP version from Maherz and keep updating yourself afterwards.  No need to get another version later."
,lupuispis,2012-06-07T23:02Z,is 64 bits or 32 bits
,stevieb1,2012-06-08T07:14Z,thanx :D
,sage404,2012-06-08T18:41Z,"@mbmirel83 use another computer to download the drivers you need using the model numbers of your unrecognized devices, then copy them to the pc you're working on and install them"
,araiqa,2012-06-09T13:43Z,can I usb boot this windows xp version? or do I have to have burned cd? my cd drive is roast :/
,pkisme,2012-06-12T11:32Z,"@lupuispis

""Windows XP Professional SP3 Integrated May 2012 (32-bit)"""
,dbuck53,2012-06-17T06:22Z,"Thank you for the torrent, Maherz. The installation works perfectly. Was able to make an old computer with Linux usable for something meaningful again."
,lockie1,2012-06-23T11:40Z,Could I use this as a repair install.
,Chex1389,2012-06-28T23:34Z,"Thx for install and effort, but i have a question. I've burned ISO file as bootable CD, and when it starts to boot, it analyzes some things and stops waiting for me to enter some DOS command. When i enter smth it says wrong command or file name, any suggestions what should i type,  or do?"
,Chex1389,2012-06-29T00:25Z,"I used Nero Express/Data/Bootable Data Disk and burned the ISO file, is that ok?"
,Chex1389,2012-06-29T00:38Z,"When it starts booting from CD is says:
Starting Caldera DR-DOS
(in one of the lines i read, No drives found, aborting installation)
then it analyzes other things and finishes, waiting for me to type the command  
[DR-DOS] A:>"
,extracube,2012-06-30T17:18Z,"Installed and working well so far.  

Question -- it's been so long that I used XP, I've forgotten.  I've installed graphics driver and sound driver.  That's only things I need to do extra, right?"
,Chex1389,2012-06-30T17:21Z,Evrything works fine now...
,Chex1389,2012-06-30T17:23Z,"@extracube
