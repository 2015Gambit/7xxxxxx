Have you, in the four decades since progressive rock band Jethro Tull released the concept album "Thick as a Brick" in 1972, ever wondered, "What ever happened to little Gerald Bostock?" Do you like flute with your rock & roll? If you answered yes to either of these questions, you'll be interested to know that on April 3, 2012, Ian Anderson, the founder, lead flutist and singer for Tull, has released a sequel to "Thick as a Brick" called "Thick as a Brick 2."
