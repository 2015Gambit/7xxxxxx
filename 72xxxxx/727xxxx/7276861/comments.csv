,Dimmis80,2012-05-23T07:10Z,For my point of view i will take what u give us.If u can't have anything i prefer Mondays and what can we do we will not watch Thursday-Fridays episodes.At least we will have something to see.I need my dayly soap fix..LOL.So if there is no way u can have those two so yes please upload Mondays.
