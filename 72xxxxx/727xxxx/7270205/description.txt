Star War: The Third Gathers: Backstroke of the West

The hilarious Chinese-English recursive translation of Star Wars: Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith... DUBBED!

In May 2012, FOX had the first part blocked from Youtube, so I am uploading my copy here.
Original account:

Part 6 of the dub was blocked earlier, so it's missing from this torrent. Instead, I have included part 6 with original dialogue and translated subtitles.

This is the source of the meme "DO NOT WANT!". You'll find it at the end of part 24.
