,ZilEighty,2012-05-23T09:58Z,Upload throttled to 1mbit since there have been no other seeders from the 15 completed downloads of this show it is now on the bottom of my seeding priority.
,ZilEighty,2012-05-25T19:45Z,"I will stop seeding this torrent on Monday (May 28), after then you're on your own. Sorry this has to be done but not one person has stuck around to seed after they've finished the torrent."
,Smithcraft,2012-05-27T22:22Z,"Thanks for this ZilEighty!

I wish it was simulcast though. The announcer is awful!"
,Smithcraft,2012-05-29T11:47Z,"Ok, Craig Charles isn't horrible, but his script is."
