P.S. plz don't stop seeding isis-vs-sinn - i want them too )"
,shallow2,2012-05-18T23:18Z,"@nemez505: Dont worry man :) I never stop a rseed until either all peers are gone, or until there are enought seeds to keep it going.

We dont tease, we deliver :) hehe "
,jonlooy,2012-05-18T23:22Z,"@shallow2 - muchas gracias.
I've downloaded it, but I dont seem to be uploading it at all, even though there are peers.

Anyway, I'll keep trying to seed it.

Cheers"
,shallow2,2012-05-18T23:54Z,"Awesome man, happy we could help :)"
,Serenifly,2012-05-19T00:38Z,"Note that those torrents have pictures in them. Anyone who doesn't download the pictures is classified as a peer by BT. So you may see a few peers, but it's probable that they have all the files they want."
,shallow2,2012-05-19T00:55Z,"I see how many are available, with more than 2.000 avail its ok, right ?"
