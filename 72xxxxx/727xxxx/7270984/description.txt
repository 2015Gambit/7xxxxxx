When Chess Putnam is ordered by an infamous crime boss - who also happens to be her drug dealer - to use her powers as a witch to solve a grisly murder involving dark magic, she knows she must rise to the challenge. Adding to the intensity: Chess's boyfriend, Terrible, doesn't trust her, and Lex, the son of a rival crime lord, is trying to reignite the sparks between him and Chess.

Plus there's the little matter of Chess's real job as a ghost hunter for the Church of Real Truth, investigating reports of a haunting at a school in the heart of Downside. Someone seems to be taking a crash course in summoning the dead - and if Chess doesnΓÇÖt watch her back, she may soon be joining their ranks.

As Chess is drawn into a shadowy world of twisted secrets and dark violence, it soon becomes clear that she's not going to emerge from its depths without making the ultimate sacrifice.

NOTE

There is an error running through these copies.
The chapter title is always one chapter ahead.
Chapter one is marked 'chapter two', etc.
Until chapter thirty-nine has no number, instead the end cover.
This does not effect the story, everything else is as it should be.
I'll leave it as it is and offer it to you.
