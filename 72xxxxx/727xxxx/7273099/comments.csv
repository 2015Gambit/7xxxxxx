I see you're new here. Cracks often contain stuff that AVG and other half-good AVP's take as viruses. Nothing to worry about."

,Ravaner,2012-05-17T18:38Z,"After installing update my game now runs about one frame per second if even any ideas, even the intro is affected."
,Angelo85,2012-05-17T20:16Z,"If the game suddenly isn't fullscreen any longer, go into the ini folder, open up the ConfigDefault.xml.
In that file, search for fullscreen. Change the entry from ""false"" into ""true"".
Now the game runs in fullscreen once again."
