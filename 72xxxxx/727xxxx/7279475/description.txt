His third studio album, 'Pure' heralds the frontline return for DJ, producer, singer and songwriter, Solarstone (aka Richard Mowatt). 

A 13-track collection of new music, it features musical co-productions with artists like Aly & Fila and Giuseppe Ottaviani and vocal team-ups with singers including Betsie Larkin, Clare Stagg, Billy McGruddy and Hannah Magenta. 

"I recorded this album as a reaction to all the riven division that's crept into trance over the last 3 years. It's a kickback against nonsense genre terminologies and a fight-back against the self-appointed style councils that try to tell us what music's cool and what the latest must-like is. Against tracks that have such a mish-mash of sound styles that even their producers don't know what they are making. This album is both a purification and celebration of the term TRANCE. I'm reclaiming it, for all those who just want to dance to music that takes them to another place, for whom this music is a feeling, a passion, a way of life. So I say: VIVE LA TRANCE! You need to be proud of what makes you feel goodΓÇª To all of you who know your own minds, this album contains PURE trance - embrace it!" - Richard Mowatt, Solarstone.

Release Date: 21st May 2012.
