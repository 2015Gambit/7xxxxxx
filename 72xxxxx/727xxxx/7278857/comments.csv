,piratepatron,2012-05-20T02:10Z,How do I prevent it from always showing me to put serial after exiting and starting again? Why does the program not show in list of programs in the computer?

I wanted this as a portable app, now I think I will be downloading most of your stuff and buying more USB drives.

One point with Lr Portable, the x64 asks for a serial or take 30 day trial... The x32 works perfect. I used the revision!!

Thanks again
