I'm the guy who's been asking about getting some Barcelona Games off you. I've come up with a list but it's up to you if you want to upload them all again... I know it's a lot but I would be eternally grateful...
Barca 2009/09 Season - Any games!
Barca - 2009/10 season - 34.,36.,46.,47.,49.,51.,55.,56.,59.
Barca - 2010/11 season -
03.,32.,34.,36.,38.,42.,50.,54.

I've already got the torrents on standby so whatever you can manage would be absolutely amazing!!"

But please, first-stay online, second-when you finished to download one of them let me know, because I don't have many space in the HDD, and I have to delete one to put another. Ok?"
,woogiezoozoo,2012-05-17T22:22Z,"That's great Nepotu!! Whatever you can do i will be grateful for.

I let you know which games have finished downloading.

Many thanks!!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-18T01:20Z,"Ok, bro! I'll hope you'll be able to restore all those games."
