,JMit,2012-05-16T10:31Z,Screws up text like v1.13. Doesnt work.
,JMit,2012-05-17T09:59Z,"Doesn't work either. It's not language, it's garbled text."
,laggo123,2012-05-17T11:54Z,"u need this one to make it work:

then it will work, but the dlc is not working since there is no dlc button in main menu"

,JMit,2012-05-17T13:58Z,"Thanks, I'll try it."
,quellochepassa,2012-05-17T21:57Z,"well, actually I just made a try: 
1-uninstalled the game
2-made a clean install
3-took the files from the ""1.13 patch fix"" torrent and copied the folder (interface) with the files in it to the bin_win32 folder
4-installed the 1.13a update contained in this torrent
5-did what the .nfo up here says
6-launched the game through the executable, not the launcher
7-language is setted by default to english, but it worked and game works pretty fine; texts are clearly readable, both menu's and game's ones.

STILL there are a lot of  here and there (really, a lot of them), like those on the in-game sector inventory and, when selecting New Game, the small text under Difficulty (the 2 options are clear), what should be ""tactical mode"" with both on & off options, and the ""start new game"" supposedly.

I also tried another language than English, I chose Italian, and everything seemed to be like in English (same s )

A fix would be really appreciated."
,laggo123,2012-05-17T23:22Z,"and let me guess quello, worst thing is u cant play the dlc shades of red too?

well i think there wont be a fix, since last 2 skidrow updates were fail non working versions and he never upped a fix for it. the patch fix was made by some random dude.
so im not even sure if those updates r actually skidrows work, since there have been reports there is a troj included and first of all: those patches r broken -not skidrow perfection style

the 1.13a is working but the button for ""dlc"" in main menu is missing, so we wont be able to play the dlc that was included in the patch"
,agush78,2012-05-18T13:17Z,hello guys i found the problem. file interface_win32.pak.crypt that make the crash. i try get the rusian ver it work fine . but the menu become russian and i cant read that. if anyone have interface_win32.pak.crypt english version for 1.13 please share. cus i cant play with russian lenguage it's anoyin'
,laggo123,2012-05-18T14:23Z,"agush how about u read what quello and i wrote.
especially where it says ""get the patch fix"""
,quellochepassa,2012-05-18T15:39Z,"that's right laggo, I couldn't play dlc 'cause I couldn't find any button for it...
anyway, I think that the dlc will be available only after one has finished the game (I just tried the first mission)

And I agree with you when stating this may not be a SKIDROW release since they, as far as I know, have always did a great and clean job.
Maybe RELOADED could/would fix this one.

Anyway, I didn't found the troj.

And maybe, a full, uncorrupted, with all languages working, ""interface"" folder, would simply be enough for everyone..."
,quellochepassa,2012-05-18T15:43Z,"PS: I saw that in my first post the boards didn't showed the couple of words ""invalid text"". I wrote them and should appear after: 
STILL there are a lot of .... 

and after: 
in English (same ...s )"
,laggo123,2012-05-18T16:25Z,"nah u dont have to complete the game to play the dlc as it says in the patch notes:
""Added DLC support, DLC can be accessed via main menu""
so its just missing cuz of bad work

when ppl talked about the troj they said something about opening the patch exe file with 7zip, there u would see the actual patch and the troj r combined to that one file"
,JMit,2012-05-25T02:53Z,"laggo123 Thanks, that fix works. There's just something broken when leveling up the mercs of a town. What are the 2 icons? When hovering the icons I only see ."

,laggo123,2012-05-30T13:35Z,those icons tell the militia which flag they stay at and defend in that sector when its under attack
,JMit,2012-05-30T19:17Z,I didnt know that. It makes the game even more enjoyable. Thanks for the answer.
,urineg,2012-06-13T18:48Z,"First I installed the game skidrow version, then I played for a while, and after shutting it down and trying to play again I couldnt load a single save game I had, then after installing patch 1.13 and the fix, and then now the 1.13a with the shades of red from this torrent, everything is working great!
thanks for the great upload"
