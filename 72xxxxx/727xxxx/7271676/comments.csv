,MCM823,2012-05-18T11:34Z,"lol, it's all good... i waited as long as i could without not knowing and eventually went to espn.com and watched the highlights... Thanks anyways! i'll be on the lookout for game 3 tho lol.  thanks again for uploading these.  I look forward to watching them cause i have AFN which gives ppl in the military american television all over the world... but the picture is HORRIBLE & since i have a 59 inch hd tv, i like to download these and enjoy the game in HD, so thanks Nepotu!"
