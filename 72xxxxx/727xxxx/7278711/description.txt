Review by Scott Yanow (AMG)
Tenor saxophonist Houston Person has stuck to his singular musical path throughout his career, playing uncomplicated but soulful and swinging renditions of blues, ballads, and jazz standards for a couple decades, ignoring current (and usually short-lived) musical trends. For this set, he is joined by pianist Stan Hope, bassist Peter Martin Weiss, drummer Cecil Brooks III, and Ralph Dorsey on congas for six superior vintage tunes. When Person adds his soul to "What a Difference a Day Made," "Stormy Weather," or "Some Other Spring," the songs sound brand new and almost as if they were written for him. Recommended.
