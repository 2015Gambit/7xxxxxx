Also a uploader name ""C-Leon"" uploads bollywood movies in small file size http://thepiratebay.se/user/C-Leon/"
,abhi6780,2012-05-17T19:08Z,"Dear Sam please use good software like other uploaders do, to reduce the size of the movie and also which will keep the quality too.

Its a request."
,nithinjs,2012-05-18T05:49Z,"hey SAM,

keep u the good work by uploading 12 gb 1080p movies. If your 8 gb 1080p movies are excellent,then ur 12 gb 1080p movies are awesome. dont listen to assholes who want a 1g 1080p movie..
Sincerely,
Your huge fan"

,abhi6780,2012-05-18T18:37Z,"@nithinjs, then keep on downloading 1080p in 12GB. And will see how much you Guys returns back by seeding. People like you just downloads the torrent and not seeds them. We download it as well as also seeds the same in return. I was just suggesting SAM to use some good software.
But people like you will not understand and will not suggest anything good to someone."

No offense meant, but please avoid making comments such as "" I was just suggesting SAM to use some good software"".. check the tech specs of the release .. video is 8mbps@1920 x 816 with a run time of 02:54:06.
If you want a 700mb DVDrip please look elsewhere"
