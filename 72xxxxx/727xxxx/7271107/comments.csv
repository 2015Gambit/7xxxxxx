,CatireTropical,2012-05-17T17:35Z,"Need help, please! 
Since VTV and others changed from avi to mp4, I have mayor problems seeing the videos without problems (I'm using VLC, but the problem occures in other players as well). Some time into the video the picture gets realy distorted and sound fails. The picture than gets back to normal but sound stays mute. I have to stop the player, restart the video and skipp forward right after the point where the movie is corrupted to keep on watching with sound."

Since VTV and others switched from avi to mp4, files are played with problems. I'm using VLC, but the problem occures in other players as well. Some time into watching a file suddenly the picture gets distorted for a couple of seconds and the sound fails. The picture regains stability but the sound stays mute. To go on watching the file I have to stop the player, restart the file, and skip to a point right after the corrupted part. Then I can watch it in usual video and audio quality.
Any thoughts or hints?"
