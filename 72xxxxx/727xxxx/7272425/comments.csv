,freebeer9,2012-05-19T16:49Z,Why I can not find this 1080p version on your website spastikustv.com?
,S-7d7,2012-05-20T01:10Z,"This is not true 1080p.  It looks like 720p expanded to 1080p, and thus has lost quality.  You're better off with a natural 720p version than this."
[V],spastik64,2012-05-21T15:15Z,"@S-7d7

Your obviously noob.

Just download 720p version and this. Open both with mediainfo, compare resolution and bitrate."
,PAiN.577,2012-05-30T05:09Z,"It took very long to download this torrent and after several hours the video still refused to play. The player would launch and nothing would appear.

I have never given a negative review but sorry mate, it didn't work for me.

Look elsewhere people"
