This show romanticises the ""ideal"" american family and that disgusts me.  But then again the gay couple amuses me.  But then again america is still dealing with the gay rights issues in 2012.  I was disgusted that it took Alberta until 2005 to legalize gay marriage.  I'm sorry, I love the american people, but your government is fuuuuuuuuuuuuucked."

If the world was ever invaded by aliens from outer space I trust the intelligence and power of Canada to save the world.

Thank you, oh kind neighbor."
