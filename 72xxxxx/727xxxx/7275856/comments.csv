Also a uploader name ""C-Leon"" uploads bollywood movies in small file size http://thepiratebay.se/user/C-Leon/"
,aksh58gup,2012-05-17T21:42Z,"@abhi6780 C-leon,yify,sujaidr and other 1gb uploaders are those rippers who download big size movies from SAM,PUBLIC HD,3LI and then rip these big file size movies to small size for downloaders like us.                      

also see that C-leon,ameet6233,sujaidr .....
always list the original uploader's name in their source for torrent !"

,1mann,2012-05-17T22:19Z,"oh please people, each to their own, i always d/l large file due to the sound files being included all the above mentioned might have small files but when u watch films on screens 50"" plus you need all the data you can get! you try watchin yifys films on a large screen and see how pixelated they are, if u don't know get to know before u comment! keep up the excellent work sam, and thanks for this 1 in advance."
,aksh58gup,2012-05-17T23:18Z,"@1mann I forgot about the size quality and pixelation while viewing on 40"" + LCD's"
,aksh58gup,2012-05-17T23:21Z,"@SaM ,please..... upload Rang De Basanti and Lagaan in Blu-Ray - 720p - x264 - DTS and keep the size to around 4+ GB !"
,abhi6780,2012-05-18T18:32Z,"@1mann, No movies of YIFy or Sujaidr Gets Pixaleted. I always watch it on my 40"" LCD and also om 22"" PC Moniter. Please confirm the same and then say...
No offence to SAM, i was just suggesting him to make his uploads size small. Which will make lots of other people to download the same."
