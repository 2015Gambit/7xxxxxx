Spice And Wolf Seasons 1 & 2 Blu Ray [English Dub, English Sub]
It also includes Japanese audio in the setup.

I find this set of disks is very difficult to find, so I wanted to post it in a more organized way and I will seed it for as long as possible.

Original 4 torrents came from demonoid, but I stuck them all into one and included a couple images."

,generalyeung,2012-06-28T06:01Z,More seeds please...
,kronflux,2012-07-02T06:19Z,"the problem is that nobody has continued to download long enough to help seed it. And I can't seed constantly.
I wish I could give the files to more people to help seed."
