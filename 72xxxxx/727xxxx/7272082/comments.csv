,tamse,2012-05-23T07:16Z,@Tierrah you can try other keys in the file. 
,Nevodaniel,2012-05-23T09:33Z,"This is for Kaspersky Internet Security 2011. In 2012, there is no option import the license like in previous versions so this does not work with 2012. It probably works with 2011 since so many people are leaving good comments."
,yoep,2012-05-27T10:32Z,"@Nevodaniel

When your in the main menu:
Click on Upgrade -> Enter activation code -> type in : 22222-22222-22222-2222u -> wait a sec -> now you can upload a key file"

,Nikosthrilos,2012-06-16T11:22Z,"@ yoep thanks a lot,you helped me with your comment,i activated with the last key,i have 283 days remaining...but i am still curious,how everyone can be so enthusiastic?how do u know your key won't be blacklisted in 5 days for example?isn't that the case in KIS 2012 as in older versions?"

,zabardast,2012-06-25T21:48Z,its blocked after update ....
,(hotrodder),2012-06-29T10:36Z,"wtf, lol! what the heck I'm i doing wrong to view the key files? I'm using note pad but they all kinda run together so i was guessing but there is really no 20 digit number to insert, i can see the first part of it OK where it says ""serial number"" but its only a 18 digit number"
,jjnhl68,2012-06-30T19:47Z,"Strange things happening! I received massage that licence is blacklisted and I lost protection...So I went to manage licence, there was offered to update, I pressed it and viola: I received another licence and was able to update database. I don't know will it last but this is surprise for sure. Have somebody explanation for this?"

Same with me. I have downloaded about 100 keys and none of them fit.
I would like to think I am doing something wrong but since no reply I have to assume I'm not and they are just bunk? LOL"
