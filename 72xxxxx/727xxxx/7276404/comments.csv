,HeadToe,2012-07-26T09:16Z,"Wow!  Just heard this was out, and lo and behold, someone has already paid the money and done the hard work!  Thank you so much weedson!  And BTW, 48 leechers and 27 seeders, and I am only the 2nd person to say thanks, very sad."
,yrkeschaffis,2012-07-29T16:43Z,"I want to tell you ""Thank you,""
But it doesn’t seem enough.
Words don’t seem sufficient--
""Blah, blah"" and all that stuff.

Please know I have deep feelings
About your generous act.
I really appreciate you;
You’re special, and that’s a fact!"
,gungunner,2012-07-30T03:58Z,"Most seeders disappeared and now it's downloading really slow.

I'm about finishing downloading the first season and the speed is now lower than 10 KB/s, I don't know if I'll be able to download the other seasons because of this.

Seed please."
,SCSA420,2012-07-30T15:18Z,I appreciate the effort to upload these but the speed is only 9.2 kB/s and at this rate utorrent says it will take 7weeks to download it and I'm skipping the entire season 1 episodes because I already have them in 720p off the usenet but the season 2 and 3 episodes on the usenet are incomplete rars and there are not enough par2 files to repair the rar archives. PLEASE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE SEEDERS RAISE YOUR UPLOAD SPEED SO THAT THIS WILL GO FASTER!!! THANKS IN ADVANCE.................
,dginger,2012-08-04T15:24Z,this is a great torrent and it was d/l'ing at 3.3MB/s for a while! 
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-08-17T11:29Z,"It's not doing that now, unfortunately.  This is one of the slowest torrents I have ever experienced.  At the current (LACK OF) speed, it will take over 6 weeks."
,Kannabiskrispy,2012-09-06T01:00Z,"To all those complaining about the DL speed...stfu and deal with it, you're getting it for free! ...or would you rather pay for the collection.

Great UL tyvm.  ill seed for 2-3 weeks"
