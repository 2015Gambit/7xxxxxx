Mercyful Fate concert from 1983!

This gig took place in the old (now demolished) Dynamo youth center in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
The new building sits on the same spot.

I was surprised that this video wasn't available on Rockbox so I've decided to upload it here.

It is not my original. I downloaded a copy from TPB.

This video is a MUST HAVE for everyone even mildly interested in Mercyful Fate and/or King Diamond.
It was shot with multiple cameras for a semi-professional feel but sadly the image quality is pretty much f due to age of the original tape. Audio is good enough though.

You can burn these files as a DVD if you want or play them with VLC Media Player.
