Nepotu, what's the difference between the two files you uploaded today? Which one to take?"
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-18T10:18Z,"Heat starting lineups modifications:
31. Shane Battier and 45. Dexter Pittman replaced 40 Udonis Haslem and 21. Ronny Turiaf"
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-18T10:29Z,"You all are welcome!
@nikita566: As you can see this is the usual 720p. The other, like I've specified (but you don't read), is 720p with 6 audio channels (5.1 audio). If you have a home cinema system with 5.1 audio system, worth DL the other one. For stereo systems with 2 or 2.1 channels, no need that."
