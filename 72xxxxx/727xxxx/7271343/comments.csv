,SCSA420,2012-05-21T19:19Z,"I have done a 720p version of WWE Over The Limit PPV 2012-05-20 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH and I tried to upload it here 20 minutes after the show was over but the TPB was down for me in the USA from 11:15 pm - 6:00 am EST and I couldn't upload it here. I even tried using numerous proxies from around the world but none would work for uploading it. So I gave up on this place which can't even keep themselves operating properly anymore like they used to be able to. IF you want my WWE Over The Limit PPV 2012-05-20 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH version I am uploading it on the usenet at alt.binaries.pro-wrestling and my release also includes the Pre-show as well in 720p. Here are some screenshots  from my release:  WWE Over The Limit PPV 2012-05-20 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH
