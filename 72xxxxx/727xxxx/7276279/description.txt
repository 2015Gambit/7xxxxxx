I did some muxing and combined parts from these two sources

Lenoxseer's torrent: http://www.demonoid.ph/files/details/2912160/0670654994/
Abcdqfr's torrent: http://www.demonoid.ph/files/details/2892086/04023929964/

I just wanted to get 1080p goodness with Dual Audio :)

Dual Audio - Jap/Eng
Subs - Eng
Video - 1920x1080 BD Rip, 10bit, no censorship, mkv

***********************************************************************************
I take no credit for anything in this torrent besides muxing the english audio into the 1080p mkv's and syncing them up.

Thanks to the people who made the original torrents, and hopefully funimation will release an offical Eng bluray soon.

Runs flawlessly in VLC for me.

HEADS UP!!! ~~~Episode 12 has unsynced eng audio in beginning, but after 0:51 it syncs back up.
I have no idea if the Jap audio is synced, I left it untouched from the original copy.

~~From Abcdqfr's post~~ IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE PLAYING THIS, that's likely due to the 10 bit encoding. It's still fairly new and unlikely supported by whatever player you're using. Get UMPlayer to fix that. It outperforms even VLC in my opinion. If your hardware can play 1080p in the first place, then it will almost certainly be able to handle 10 bit encodes.

It has the whole season and some pictures.

First torrent so I hope all goes well.
