Daniel Robert "Danny" Elfman (born May 29, 1953) is an American composer, best known for scoring music for television and film and creating The Simpsons main title theme as well as the 1989 Batman movie theme. He was the lead singer and songwriter for the rock band Oingo Boingo, from 1976 to 1995. He has scored the majority of the films for his long-time friend Tim Burton.

So-Lo is the only solo album by Danny Elfman and was released in 1984. It was performed by members of his Californian new wave band Oingo Boingo, but deliberately not released under the Oingo Boingo name in order to circumvent a dispute with the band's record label. Elfman stated that he used the opportunity to release material that would not be suitable for an actual Oingo Boingo album, moving away from the band's ska origins and more towards mainstream synth pop. He described it as "chance to experiment with slower tempos", with no intention of beginning a solo career.
