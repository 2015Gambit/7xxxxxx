,zzlio,2012-05-19T10:30Z,"Great Album and one of my favourites also.
When I am making my own compilations, I am always using ""Stay Away Joe "" and not ""Stay Away"" which is more in the spirit of the Guitar Man sessions. Can you reveal a little bit regarding your sources or processes to achieve such an impressive sound ?"
