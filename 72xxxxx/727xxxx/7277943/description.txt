Firemaking is the fastest, but also, the most boring skill in Runescape. 
It takes around 90 hours with around 100 thousand maple logs to reach the desired level 99, 
which many people use to get their first skillcape. Not to mention, PRO Burner supports Bonfires also!

The bot is designed for speed and does everything to be ahead of the people who are trying to burn their logs theirself. Pro Burner also supports bonfires, which allows you to squeeze more experience out of each log, and also get the rewards from the fire spirit. Pro Burner doesn't mind the usage of boosts either, you can equip your Ring of Fire and your Firemaking Gloves for an additional 5% experience boost and your Penanc horn to double your experience.
