Resident Evil: Degeneration, known in Japan as Biohazard: Degeneration (πâÉπéñπé¬πâÅπé╢πâ╝πâë∩╝Üπâçπéúπé╕πéºπâìπâ¼πâ╝πé╖πâºπâ│ Baiohaz─üdo: Dijener─ôshon?), is the first full-length motion capture[2] CG animation feature based upon Capcom's Resident Evil video game series. The film was made by Capcom Studios in cooperation with Sony Pictures Animation and Sony Pictures Entertainment. Degeneration made its premiere in Japan on October 11, 2008 at the Tokyo Game Show, and was released nationwide one week later on October 18.

Unlike the Resident Evil live-action film series, Degeneration is set within the same universe as the original video game series.[4] The main characters are Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, who appear together for the first time since the 1998 game Resident Evil 2.



* Plot :

In the year 2005, the Harvardville Airport is under attack by a zombie infestation. Claire Redfield is now a member of TerraSave, an organization which handles search and rescue at chemical and biological attacks. Claire was on-site to meet a family she is aiding, and coincidentally runs into U.S. Senator Ron Davis, who was trying to avoid protesters. Meanwhile, a passenger aircraft approaching the airport crashess due to a man infected with the T-virus, who caused an infestation on-board. Unable to escape from the airport terminal, Claire, Rani and Davis, along with an airline stewardess, shut themselves in the VIP lounge and call for help. By nightfall, the airport has been locked down by the local Special Response Team and the United States Marine Corps, aiding evacuated survivors. Two officers Angela Miller and Greg Glenn, are joined by Leon S. Kennedy. Leon, Greg, and Miller manage to save the civilians, but Glenn is infected during their exfiltration, with the U.S. Marines clearing out the terminal.

Claire sees a convoy of trucks from the WilPharma Corporation arrive to administer the vaccines for the viral outbreak. Suddenly, the WilPharma trucks containing the vaccine are destroyed. Claire accompanies WilPharma chief researcher Frederic Downing to the WilPharma research facility for more vaccines. After a tour of the facility, Claire is shown a molecular-scale image of the G-virus. Downing, surprised by her anger, excuses himself and she is left alone in his office. Claire informs Leon about WilPharma's possession of the G-virus, and learns that he and Angela Miller have found the house of Curtis Miller, Angela's brother, burned down. Downing phones Claire to warn her that a man has just left the facility and that a time bomb has been activated. Claire catches a brief glimpse of Curtis Miller through a window, only for the bomb to detonate.
