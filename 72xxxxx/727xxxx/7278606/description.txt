This recording from late 1984, made for the King Biscuit Flower Hour, is taken from the band's first visit to Cincinnati. This show may have been the first time a lot of people had heard the band: in spite of their Grammy award for "Anselma" earlier that year (for Best Mexican-American Performance, one of the few awards Michael Jackson did not win), they would not achieve a great deal of widespread exposure until their work on La Bamba in 1987.
