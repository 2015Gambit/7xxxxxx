,c6burns,2012-05-27T08:10Z,"""Can't complain about acting as these are real navy seals playing the roles""

This is an action movie so yes I can complain about the acting. There are plenty of realistic war movies with excellent casting. ""Blackhawk Down"" comes to mind. There are also excellent *documentaries* about the military and the SEALs specifically. ""U.S. Navy SEALs: The Silent Option"" is one. This movie is not a documentary so ""realness"" is not something I care about.

Yes, these are real SEALs ... I get it. That doesn't make the plot better than it is, or the acting better than it is, or the character development better than it is. Character development has nothing to do with the actors ... Im not shitting on them for the failures of the script. They are only responsible for the bad acting and I forgive them for being bad actors as they are SEALs by trade, not actors. It's not their fault the movie turned out to be crap ... I'm sure they are badass at being SEALs so who cares if they can't act. I am not forgiving the movie for being bad ... it's not a 10 or an 11 or w/e the hell rating unless you evaluate it as a propaganda piece for recruiting more SEALs.

Please note I am not using propaganda as some kind of negative term. This movie is one big recruiting video for the Navy SEALs which is *TOTALLY* fine except it's a bad movie when compared to other action movies. That's all sorry for the rant :)"

The next thing that gave you away was stating that you have been involved in secret Al Qaeda raids, and you stated a confirmed kill count, which no real SEAL ever keeps track of, nor admits to. The next thing that gave you away was stating that you have access to an entire arsenal of Marine Corps. Since when are Marine Corps. soldiers considered an arsenal? And there is no such thing as a SEAL who can call on ANY Marines on a whim, simply because he wants to kill someone who insulted him on the internet. I AM in the military, and I know REAL Navy SEALS, and not a damn one of them CAN or WANTS to talk about what they have seen or done in their lifetime. And most will admit that the most they have ever had to do was recon in the mountains, camping out, collecting intelligence. They are no different from me and my brothers in the 82nd Airborne Division who are doing nothing right now but sitting on our asses either at home on base, or on base overseas.

Also do any of you know who put the government that is in power in Iran right now we did they were democratic but at that time wanted to nationalize all oil and keep the money from the western corporations so bye bye democracy hello dictator who will do what and when we say it.   We also put Sadam Hussein in power in Iraq and when he stop listening he stopped living. I realize none of our military ground troops are to blame it there higher ups who make the calls but without anyone to fire their bullets to launch those missile to man the unmanned drone craft to kill innocent women and children do we have war at all? Boycott this movie and the military we have done enough damage to the world under the guise of freedom, democracy, and heroics that make me sick. Don't go because you feel patriotism obligates you understand what patriotism actually is.  "
,I_dogg,2012-06-22T02:33Z,one of the worst movies ever. 
,stanleytgho,2012-06-23T17:38Z,"Had to make a profile for this. @jebus1111; for people in my profession you are an obvious faker, your first dead give away is that all these civilians know you are a lying piece of shit. If you know whats good for you I would keep your fake military service restricted to the internet. that is all"
,sonny1960,2012-06-24T02:13Z,"Thanks mate, I will leave to seed for a month so that others can enjoy your efforts. "
,Nitrous0xide,2012-06-25T02:00Z,@ Jebus1111 Your a Fucking Moron and I second e4tTh3b4bY's comment and anyone else who commented on his dumbass. I hate little fake fucks like you who play too many video games and think they are anywhere close to being capable of what a SEAL or any service member is capable of. I am a soldier with 126th Combat Military Police Brigade and I shit on those like you... So get off of your grandmothers couch in that smelly ass basement and join a branch then run your little cock sucker off on TPB.

,jrobb55,2012-06-25T20:01Z,Probably the best movie I've ever seen
,bigboi32593,2012-06-26T03:12Z,@ the jebus1111 idk if you know this or not cause CALL OF DUTY dont teach it but even if you were on a SECRET raid in al-queda you would be aloud to speak of it at all you tard which means that you were never on one but hey 300 kills in call of duty thats pretty cool as long as you got them in one game lol haha oh and btw you might wanna watch your back cause i dont think the government or the military take kindly to people inpersonating soldiers much less say there the best the military ever had lol hahah what a tard 
,vgmbael,2012-07-03T15:15Z,"@jebus1111 To start I was never a Seal but I did serve in the US Navy 2005-2010 2 tours to Iraq (FOB Endurance) Basra and 2 tours Afghanistan MSU FOB 28D Azertak Valley. First off you mentioned you were top of your class in the Navy Seals if you were a real seal you would of called it Buds. Second you said you had 300 confirmed kills and your the best sniper in the service well after doing some research unless you are Lyudmila Pavlichenko and fought during WWII then no you're a fake. Third secret network of spies hmm you are claiming to be a Seal not CIA try again, Seals are a fighting force not a spy agency they get intel just like the rest of the military. My forth and final conclusion that your just a scum bag is this part ""I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps"" a Navy Seal is just that NAVY. Yes USMC and Navy are the same department but resources we don't share on a regular basis. Sorry Jebus but all you are is a snot nosed lying kid and you failed at it. "
,willytakum,2012-07-04T18:32Z,"@jebus1111>>>I really hope you are just a spoiled kid, under the age of 18...cause if you're not, you can expect to be arrested, tried and convicted of impersonating a member of the US Armed Forces. A federal crime punishable by death. Chances are good that you won't be shot, hung, electricuted or given a lethal injection, but believe me...they will find you and you WILL be arrested. I just sincerely hope extremezone or TPB doesn't suffer for your ignorance..."

These are the guys that smoked Bin Laden after they took on the Mexican Cartels and smoked them too!!!!    Warning Spoiler...  Cristo goes to GITMO, he sells out his long time terrorist friend to the SEALs who are working with the CIA and it ends in a show down where the lead terrorist gets smoked by the SEALs who are wounded and fighting down to the last bullet to smoke the terrorist.  All and all a good flick, more cursing needed and more sex, but all and all a good recruiting movie for the SEALs.  They did smoke Bin Laden... BTW and that footage is not included in the special features menu...  Good Job Extreme!!!! another quality rip"
