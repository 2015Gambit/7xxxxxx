,host92,2012-05-18T19:44Z,is this region-free or ntsu and pal as on other sites
[V],boobsman,2012-05-18T19:51Z,@ spiderforpc hope you enjoy it mate :)
[V],boobsman,2012-05-18T19:55Z,"@ host92 sorry in the rush to get this out i didn't check n followed the nfo, this game is NOT region free, ONLY PAL AND NTSC/U"
,ix9nine009,2012-05-18T20:10Z,"thanks for the upload boooooobsman.

is this really region free or NTSC U/PAL only?

will be waiting for Dragon's Dogma"
,Bonji93,2012-05-18T20:18Z,"Hey boobsman, is this version already patched with the topology data? Is patching the data as simple as running it through abgx? Because right now i was getting this through ETGamez link. "
[V],boobsman,2012-05-18T20:23Z,"@ ix9nine009 yes sorry the iMARS version is only PAL, NTSC/U. The nfo says RF but this is NOT the case:

[V],boobsman,2012-05-18T20:26Z,"@ Bonji93 you don't know how to patch topology? No this does not come pre patched as some will want to use the downgrader to play on LT2.0, are you running LT2.0 or LT3.0???"
,Bonji93,2012-05-18T20:35Z,"Thanks for the upload boobsman, all we have do is run this through abgx now right?"
,Bonji93,2012-05-18T20:35Z,I did not mean to post that again
,Bonji93,2012-05-18T20:36Z,I'm am playing on 3.0
,ix9nine009,2012-05-18T20:37Z,can I still play this even if I have NTSC/J console? I dunno but some Ubisoft games that are NTSC/U are playable in NTSC/J console
,Bonji93,2012-05-18T20:42Z,Is there a way that I can keep these comments refreshed? I can only see them all when I post something new 
[V],boobsman,2012-05-18T20:48Z,"@ Bonji93 yes you can run through abgx to get topology or use the master topology although i've not tested to see if that works as it didn't with MP3.

@ ix9nine009 you'd need to download and test for yourself, abgx360 only says PAL and NTSC/U but since i don't have an NTSC/J console there is no way for me to test, if you do download and try please post back to let everyone know :)"
,kizo11,2012-05-18T20:51Z,"Hey boobsman , I have LT 2.0 can i somehow play this game , Will the topology work ?"
,murderdro,2012-05-18T21:00Z,hi im new to this download for the 360 thing.. does my 360 have to be modded? and is tehre software for a mac user i can use to burn? 
,nooralmadi008,2012-05-18T21:03Z,thank u man
,murderdro,2012-05-18T21:05Z,i cant see all of the comments as wel
[V],boobsman,2012-05-18T21:23Z,"@ kizo11 depends what drive you have, the old Hitachi's are not effected by topology so you can play as is, for other drives you'll need to use the downgrader, its worked for all xgd3 games so far:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6999991/Final_Fantasy_13-2_XBOX360_LT3.0_ISO_Patch_To_LT2.0_

@ murderdro yes you need a modded console to be able to play copied games, Google xbox360 modding for more details :)"
,fankoosh,2012-05-18T21:40Z,"for those only with LT+2 consoles , they need to be sure that their consoles has not been online b4 , so u should have OFFLINE console to play all latest XGD3 games of course after u will update ur DB to 14719 via USB method & applying LT+2 ISO patch (ff) to remove topology data , so after u update ur console , reboot & wait till it finish metro dash updates , then reboot again & u r fine now u can play all XGD3 fully burn & truncated & all XGD2 with those OFFLINE consoles having Phat or slim Liteon drive , also benq & samsung drives r ok. i have done what i wrote here on my LT+2 phat Liteon console Offline & never got silent dae.bin , & remeber only ppl got that silent update fron XBL online & still on LT+2 , dont bother doing what i wrote , just go directly to flash ur box to LT+3 & u will be able to play all games with updated DB 14719"

Thanks."
,kizo11,2012-05-18T21:50Z,"@ boobsman , which do you recommend , xbox backup creator the topology for final fantasy or the topology from abgx360 ?"
[V],boobsman,2012-05-18T23:13Z,"@ DanielRibeiroMarinho sorry i don't have a timeline for game release dates, you'll get it as soon as i do :)

@ kizo11 either but make sure you keep a copy of the iso in case something goes wrong you can easily undo :)"

[V],boobsman,2012-05-19T11:33Z,"@ cisse9 because with 2 semi dedicated 1gb seedboxes i can do it faster than that, problem is people downloading don't like to share! If everyone would stop limiting there upload speed and seed what they take it would improve it for everyone!"

,Bonji93,2012-05-19T17:53Z,Hey Boobs I have another question. Is it safe to play the single player while signed into xbox live?
[V],boobsman,2012-05-19T19:25Z,"@ vstream that's not an error it just means there is no shop brought copy to verify against so do not play online as stealth cannot be verified. You can burn and play the game now but if you plan to go online you'll need to reburn after the game has been released in the shops and you can properly patch.

@ Bonji93 no i would stay offline until the game has been released and has been properly patched.

2. you can seed when the download is done
3. you dont have to inject any topology, because, like you said, you have LT3.0"
,Law-Giver,2012-05-29T15:07Z,"I'm still using LT2 after the updates. I swapped my Liteon flashed with LT2 for a Liteon with an open tray error i had lying around. Installed the security update as i'd previously updated the dash via the game disk. I then put my flashed Liteon back in and plays a charm, no more update nagging.

This console is for offline play mind and i have to add the older dae.bin to the XGD3 games and burn with my ihas 124 drive. All my other disks play fine as well. ;-)"

I've just finished Max Payne 3 and now i'm finishing Prototype 2... later on: ""Ghost Recon"".

For those who are having problem: I was on LT 3.0 and Dashboard 14699.. i simply downloaded the update at www.xbox.com and updated via USB. Then I checked the game on ABGX 1.0.6 and received all green message, after all this, i had to burn this with IMGBURN on Windows (cause i use mac) using Truncate Mode. That's it !!!

Any doubts i would be pleased to help !"
