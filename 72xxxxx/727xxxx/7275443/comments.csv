Hey, I downloaded this and the Rosetta stone preinstalled, but this saves to Programfiles(x86)
where as the actual rosseta stone program saves to Programfiles. Am I doing something wrong because, I can't start it and I've re downloaded twice. Any help you could give would be greatly appreciated. =)"
