Download the torrent and mount the iso's with a Iso Mounting Program I use Virtual Clone Drive, after the installation just run the patch. At the end just replace the files with the Crack's in the installation directory. Important first install the Simple Battlegrounds and then the Clone Campaigns.

Enjoy!
