Thanks for the share, but can't access.
The AI asked for Administrator password.
So I tried to run it as Current User, ut it said ""it can only run as ""Administrator"".  :(
Pls help.
The Bridge ain't working for me either. Always stopped working when launched. Tried many times. I am on WIN 7 32 BITS.
Pls help asap. Thank so very much."
