Performance Notes: new software that are resource intensive like Illustrator
do not perform well in XP. i highly recommend upgrading. if you're here, then
you ought to be able to find a working copy of Win7... for Christ's Sake, M$

Synopsis: with Illustrator.. you kind of need Adobe Bridge. It makes it so 
much easier to browse for files as it provides thumbnails images of Ai, EPS,
and other vector formats. You can also export directly into Illustrator from
Bridge. I feel the benefit from having Bridge alongside Illustrator is worth
the extra effort of compiling another PAF and uploading.

There seems to be a lot of people who are unfamiliar about the purpose/benefit
of "PAF". PAF runs naturally on your PC, thus allows you to use your PC's 
resources like RAM/Graphics Card. It does this by copying files back & forth
on the fly. Because of this.. i have to balance between load time & 
functionality. It's a fine line.. and what i consider perfect may not be
for others.

HOW TO ADD MORE FEATURES
------------------------
1. install Illustrator on a VM.
2. copy over the "Adobe" folder from "Common Files".
3. compare the difference between that "Adobe" folder and:
IllustratorPortable > App > DefaultData > Adobe.

* i.e. i left out "Linguistics" because it's 213MB. if you wanted this.. simply
copy into the "Adobe" folder inside "IllustratorPortable".

5. Delete "Data" folder to reset everything.
6. Launch IllustratorPortable and the feature should be available.

USB USERS

You're better off using a ThinApp/Spoon Studio version.. because Illustrator
is so deeply integrated into the OS and requires a lot of files/registry keys.
