This torrent includes all four volumes of "Chemistry and Technology of Explosives" authored by Tadeusz Urbanski. Second in comprehensiveness only to "Encyclopedia of Explosives and Related Items" which was written by numerous researchers from Picatinny Arsenal, this treatise is still revered by modern explosives engineers and developers, and still cited by scholastic research in the field. Although written almost half a century ago, this work is just as relevant to the student of today as it was on the date of it's release. At 2,604 pages, even such famed works as "The Chemistry of Powder and Explosives" by Tenney L. Davis become light reading in comparison to the writing of Urbanski.
