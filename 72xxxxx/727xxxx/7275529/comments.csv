,cstraybeck,2012-05-17T17:14Z,"It's cam, but it's one of the very, very, very, very good ones.

,scout4pb,2012-05-17T19:05Z,lmfao.thanx cstraybeck. too much misrepresentation nowadays often followed by childish bitching. its too early for this print to show up legit mkv rip. I was gonna pass till i read your note. Both of them. You didnt down the kid and credited his effort. That's Class. Now I gotta check it out. If its good Ill grab a decent 1080p mkv AC3 copy later. Ill follow up if i can remember:-)

,scout4pb,2012-05-18T05:59Z,"Yep. Mono cam UP-converted to .mkv 720 res. for some mysterious reason. Decent for passive viewing but not an HD 5.1 cinematic experience. Hey, Its a cam. Figure another week for the true BD rips to appear. READ THE SPECS. Beware if they arent all there."
,lainer5801,2012-05-18T08:07Z,"Thanks for the uplaod first off.  
Looks like an old VHS tape video and most of the sound is slightly off....

i would say:

A:3

but thanks again for the uplaoad."

Audio desync's constantly throughout the movie.  After syncing 10 times within the first 30 minutes I gave up (using VLC).

Video is not bluray quality but it is much better than your garden variety cam.

*Spoiler*

If you keep reading this then you deserve to have the plot spoiled.  Please look away if you haven't watched it yet.

I enjoyed how much this movie portrays true human nature.  We try to contact aliens.  Aliens respond by coming to visit us.  We shoot at them as a warning expecting them to understand this.  They shoot back.  After getting in a gun fight they finally stop attacking once we stop aiming our guns at them.  They attack our weapons and anything that seems to pose as a threat to them but try and leave us alive if possible.  After multiple instances of this happening we still assume they came to earth to annihilate us.  Due to hysteria we decide to eliminate them all and pretend we protected the earth from annihilation.

*Spoiler End*"

,Agathon_81,2012-05-20T16:52Z,"Best cam i have seen. But the audio is awful, very buggy and very poor quality. Picture is very good to be cam.
Audio: 3
Video: 8
Movie 1,5 (its a soup with fireworks and no storyline whatsoever)"
,PrototypeR,2012-05-21T05:03Z,"It is definitely a cam. But one that is worth watching. I don't know why anyone would write 720p in the title though.
 A:5 
 V:7 "
,TehAgent,2012-05-22T00:46Z,"good quality video, but the audio is from the 26k upload, you have the audiance laughing and the base that is just over powering on the speakers.

If there was better audio out there, would be a good idea to sync it with this video source."
,TehAgent,2012-05-22T00:51Z,"new source video with the same 26k audio from the very first upload, i have a feeling the real audio was korean dub

Shame there isnt a better audio version of this film to sync with this video source, you would have one very good copy then. "
,TehAgent,2012-05-22T00:53Z,"damn it PB, why you hiding my comments, making me put the same thing twice lol

anyway, video 8/9 almost dvd quality, audio 4, bass is having a nightmare on my speakers, mono sound, laughter from the audience, and it goes out of sync in sections, does correct its self but sometimes you get the same audio twice as it tries to sync.

,qqmr,2012-05-22T11:57Z,the coolest movie ever after!
,bearscar93,2012-05-23T21:26Z,"@Radiotransmitter 

I'll download whatever the fuck i want to download. Go suck a tree or something, instead of writing stupid comments. "
,eb121209,2012-05-25T00:03Z,"I find it funny when people comment on movies that were just released into theaters and says ""It's a cam"". No shit it's a cam, it just came out. Idiots."
,frostbite2011,2012-05-25T04:45Z,"@eb121209

exactly! you got it right. . LOL.

and how funny that people usually download stuff from here and still don't know how to choose the good and the bad quality.

3 things to consider: Uploader / File size / File name."
,Heavytoe53,2012-05-25T23:48Z,A=7 V=8 Thanks
,JostiBob,2012-05-27T14:10Z,"A: 4 (is way off)

,spifkitten99,2012-05-28T15:37Z,"People, nobody here gives a shit what you think about the movie. Go to imdb for that shit.

Here on tpb you should inform us about the quality of the rip. That being the quality of the video and audio.

Shut up about the movie."
,spifkitten99,2012-05-28T17:36Z,"Audio is from a cam, and it's way out of sync.

Texts in the movie, are in korean.

Give proper information for the torrent for fuck sakes.

eb121209, you are a fucking moron. People comment that it's a cam, because it's not fucking labeled as a cam. It's important to make people aware when torrents are named wrong."
,PownderHead,2012-06-01T03:20Z,V=10 (cam) A=6 (out of sync)
,dylank22,2012-06-04T08:19Z,"@bigboyzback - you are an idiot. we know there is no such thing as hd cam and that is why we get mad. people like this guy put up cams in the HIGHRES section and don't even label. yeah, sure its free but it still wastes our time and could easily be avoided."
,Skeiron,2012-06-04T13:58Z,"To all you people complaining about audio sync issues (this applies to basically any movie download with audio sync issues)...

Download VLC
Press J for -delay
Press K for +delay

Seed seed seed :)"
,spifkitten99,2012-06-04T15:16Z,"@Skeiron, that doesn't help anything, when the audio is constantly going in and out of sync.

Where was this recorded? The people in the theater laughs at ANYTHING. I don't know how they can find it that funny, but they do. Happy people. :)"
,eb121209,2012-06-08T22:55Z,"@spifkitten99 

This was actually uploaded one day before it was released in theaters in the US. So doesn't take a fucking genius to know it's a cam even if it doesn't say cam in the title. So who's the fucking moron here? Stfu and stick to playing Sorority Life, suits you a lot better."
,tofumunch,2012-06-20T17:13Z,"even if it doesn't say ""cam"" there is ""WEBscr"" which is pretty much the same like ""cam"". "
