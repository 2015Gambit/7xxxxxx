Raging Black Metal Madness. Devathorn cult consists an aural Qliphotic channeling of Chaos. Accipe Verbis et Dogmate!

Sic Transit Gloria Mundi. Devathorn cult manifested during winter 2002 Anno Bastardi, by Saevus Helcath.After several line-up changes , the cult took its present form with the joining of Althagor and Mechblastess. Given a handful of live peformances, the band completed the recordings of the debut album "Diadema", which came to the light during fall 2007. The release got supported with several live performances.Also,the band started creating new material for its second release ,and for the SECTA NOVA split cd (Enshadowed-Burial Hordes-Devathorn-Angstridden). Following the agressive paths of "Diadema" to further borders , the new material is enriched with more sick and raging elements. Secta Nova release came in 2010 and soon the second full - release dogma will be unleashed . On behalf of Devathorn.
