after a discrepancy of pattern selection of picked producers following Nick Warren's release,

balance is becoming more or less like the new GU, shame really.

This was not a pain staking cd mix , nor the production.

Holden's was the golden age solid Prog with unique edits

Voorn was the first with multiple track as one abstract mix of 190 tracks to about 30.

This is just a solid solid filler."
