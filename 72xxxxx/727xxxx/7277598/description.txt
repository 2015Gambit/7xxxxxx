Named for the Skip James song 22-20 Blues, the 22-20s hail from Lincolnshire, England, and mix blues, rock, folk, and country influences into a sound that got the quartet noticed early in its career. Vocalist/guitarist Martin Trimble and bassist Glen Bartup had played together in local bands for several years, but formed the 22-20s in mid-2002, while they were still both in their early twenties.
