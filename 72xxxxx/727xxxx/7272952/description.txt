The king of Dutch deadpan Alex van Warmerdam strikes again with the delightfully off-kilter Ober (Waiter), in which a fictional waiter (played with evident glee by the director himself) goes to complain about his miserable existence to his creator. Twenty years after his now-classic debut Abel, Van Warmerdam here proves that his unique combination of deadpan humour and quintessentially Dutch settings are still a winning team -- though one that could only be coached by the director himself. After the oddity that was Grimm (in which Van Warmerdam did not star) the actor-director is back in top form and his cult following at home and abroad might grow further if Ober is marketed well.
