Terence Davis moving, harrowing and elegantly artistic masterpiece is one of the few 
Britsh films of recent years to embody a distinctly British identity. The plot
involves a family wedding in working class Liverpool just after the second world war
and the various episodes in the family's past dealing with their sometimes brutal
and disturbed father. The beauty of the film lies in the deeply artistic composition
of various shots, coupled with Davis' enduring compassion and understanding for the
characters, especially the father played brilliantly by Pete Postlethwaite. It is an
incredible evocation of family life and even though at times it makes for hard
viewing, this is a film that must be seen. - (Dominic Maitland)
