BTW Thank you extreamzone for the upload."

,Hancock79,2012-05-18T08:56Z,"people expect too much because the show is so awesome lol

the gameplay is average at best. voice acting is terrible, which some think ruins the best part of a GoT game(the story).  just be glad you don't have to pay to find out if it sucks"

,torrentjimmy1,2012-05-18T09:02Z,just fyi to people who havent read about diablo 3 before posting... the game even on single player mode requires u to sign into ur bliz account as ur char is only saved and played online even in single mode as that is just online without friends... so I Highly doubt someones gonna remake the game just for a few... altho it would be cool as I bought it but both laptop and desktop have each the only 2 brands of graphics cards that would not work with them...

loading the file with daemon tool i see it but cant start the install anyone got the same problem?"
,drakenoshway,2012-05-18T16:02Z,"just so people are aware this is the bugged steam version of the game. it will most likely work for you but some people will be unable to create their character to start the game or adjust options as all the required fields are invisible. so give it a shot but dont be disappointed if it doesnt work.

on another note while yes this does draw story from the books that isnt present in the show on HBO this is in fact the official HBO game of thrones game as it is based on the tv show. thats why the hired people from the show to voice act the appropriate characters."
,kim96,2012-05-18T16:06Z,"if you delete your files .. easy way to unistall is
that you press the start button and then button under computer and delete installed files or something like that :) .. i have my computer language in finnish so i can see the them english :P"

,slaneesh,2012-05-18T17:12Z,"Just save yourself the trouble and skip this horrible game.

I wound´t even consider the bandwith required to download the game worth it.

An utter waste of time and space"
,urieaal,2012-05-18T18:40Z,"for the people saying this is terrible its baised on the books, not the TV series. Personally love the books, cant stand the tv series.. so ya imo give it a try if you like the books dont expect anything from the tv series.

Also its an atlus game... at best your looking at a 7 out of 10 rated game depending on your personal point of view.

Also to note Isn't diablo 3 online only??? pretty certain it is so that wont be pirate able im sure...
"
,drakenoshway,2012-05-18T19:57Z,"if it was based on the books alone they wouldnt have a giant HBO logo when you start the game, the characters wouldnt be designed to look like the TV actors, and they wouldnt have hired the actors to do the voices. yes it went into development before the series aired but its obvious that they worked closely with HBO on this, dont spread misinformation saying is based solely on the books. the game is by no means bad IF you like this type of game. they took alot of tried and true concepts and put their own spin on them, such as the fact that the ""pause combat"" doesnt actually pause it, just slows things down considerably. if your really worried about difficulty bump it up, you'll watch yourself die pretty often and find yourself saving after every small skirmish.

and as far as the diablo 3 discussion dont hold your breath waiting for this one. yes they will have it cracked eventually but your still going to need a private server for hosting. "

It ran for me once made my character, but while picking the skills and strengths all those options were invisible to me, if I highlighted over where they should of been I could see what they were tho so I improvised, but then it crashed on me. I blocked it from the inet so dont think it was that.

@everyone having install/cracking problems. at least for me kaspersky hated this thing quarrantened everything crack related. after telling the AV to stfu I was able to use the keygen."

,adyc80,2012-05-21T20:09Z,"This game is quite good if you liked the books and games like swkotor then you will probably like this, yeah the combat isnt great and the camera is annoying but the story is pretty good and very loyal to the style of the books (nothing is black and white). Comparing this to skyrim is like comparing apples and oranges its totally different style of game."

This is exactly why I ALWAYS download a game before I actually go and buy it!!!  I Just saved myself $50 - $60 thank god!!

You can get the reloaded update from TPB, or you can run the game, click play , and let the game update itself. either way works fine.

The game is not the best I have played by far, but not the worst. Combat has a real sluggish, forced feel. Voice acting could be better. At least the storyline is canon, so true fans of the series(books or show) should get enough enjoyment out of the game to be worth their time."
,thedeathlessprince,2012-06-17T20:42Z,"AVG throws a hissy fit on the keygen and wont let you access it, only way I found around it was to uninstall AVG.
Otherwise it works fine.

Guess what - buy the game and you will have no need of keygen."
,ElsbethMurdelizer,2012-07-19T13:44Z,"Is there any way to play this with a mouse properly? It really sucks that I have to klick the right mouse button to rotate the camera, is there any way to let the cam rotate ""freely""? or to rotate the cam left/right by pressing buttons?
this really kills the game for me."
,jhlw,2012-08-01T03:56Z,"I'm with a different problem. the tutorial registry worked perfectly. the problem is that I see no settings option (game, sound, video) and I can not start the game. I think I have to choose a character, but I can not read / see anything, only the body of soldiers. The initial animation did not show any problem, after the animation this problem appeared. Any ideas?"
,gaguy26,2012-08-03T14:58Z,"if anyone is/had problems like I did getting the game to play make SURE you get the updates 1.2 and/or 1.3  game works flawlessly for me now!

Before the updates/patches I would get the black window and 100% cpu usage >.>"
