,Tech-Noir,2012-05-17T14:54Z,"The uploader is very reliable. And again, this is NOT ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"". "
,MistryWho,2012-05-17T15:17Z,There are 2 Abraham Lincoln movies coming out this year. This is one of them and it being released straight to DVD May 29 so its possible to get a hold of the Blu Ray. The other bigger Vampire Hunter is coming out June 22 in theatres.

,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-08T08:09Z,"Another Hollywood TURD. Every single movie by Hollywood. You might as well go to the Toilet, Drop a load, and use a chop stick to play with it. That will be more entertaining than watching a Hollywood Turd. Because Hollywood turds don't stick, and often Float like Battleship. "
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-08T08:10Z,"Correction: Hollywood Turds dont STINK. Not Sick. Well, that too. We'll just add that. Lincoln must be flippin' mad in his grave. "
