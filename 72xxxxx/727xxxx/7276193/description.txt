Quite possibly the biggest star that television has ever produced, Carson commanded, at his peak, a nightly audience of 15 million viewers ΓÇô double the current audience of Leno and Letterman ΓÇô combined. Rarely giving interviews, Carson chose to remain a very private man whose public persona made him an American superstar. He once revealed, ΓÇ£I can get in front of an audience and be in control. I suppose itΓÇÖs manipulation. Offstage, IΓÇÖm aloof because IΓÇÖm not very comfortable.ΓÇ¥ American Masters Johnny Carson: King of Late Night explores this dichotomy and enigma, unearthing clues about CarsonΓÇÖs childhood, early days in the business, and personal and professional life.
