[V],psspss,2012-05-17T13:15Z,"of course it be the same.. but its 25 fps.. it just dups frames to get it to 25..

looks alright to me.. only some jerkiness cos of the capture frames being low..

i guess he used screen virtuoso and didnt change the default.. or couldnt use tubedigger which caps
all webstreams.. ones it cant do are dmr damaged standalones.. so xcreen capture is one option on a fast i7 

the main reasonf or this is so it plays on more devices not to satisfy the 720p nobs out there"
,OneBigToe,2012-05-17T14:37Z,"Will leave it or wait. (simply feedback, not meant to provoke)

Not sure what's going on, obviously something bad...

You guys do an awesome job at greater personal risk, personally thought the thanks were apparent with the popularity but if you need to hear it ""Thank-you"".

It's about satisfaction in doing something well. Please, please be careful of bad blood (better off stopping then letting this move into something less quantifiable--it'll drive you nuts).

anyways, for wub and jimmies... always appreciated, never obligated."
[V],psspss,2012-05-17T16:15Z,"no need for thanks.. but complaining dont help

but looking at the seeders sure shows xvids still popular..

most dont care avout quality as long as its reasonable .. as they rather watch it then not at all

you know VLC is more then a player right?'

it can stream aross lan to android phones and xboxes etc.. "
,OneBigToe,2012-05-17T17:11Z,"I spoke out of turn... my bad.

Googled the missing episode and was led to believe there was growing animosity over a lack of comments/thanks.

Yup on vlc player... np playing the file... a low fps gets me nauseous, computer screen is a 42 inch tv (grin).

ty for the reply and for the release, time and effort."
[V],psspss,2012-05-17T17:49Z,"i dont see what others are obviously
i have laptop on the bed and lay and watch 
it a foot away.. 

the only thing i noticed is one scene of the car
moving fast it almost seemed slow motions

think its worse in the 1st 5min..

,skurys,2012-05-17T23:36Z,Is this a quick frame blend conversion or a full blown interpolation ala avisynth style?
,skurys,2012-05-17T23:46Z,"search the net for MythBusters.S10E08.WEBRip.XviD-NoGRP.avi , just came out (just not on torrent sites yet)"
,twice72,2012-05-18T02:03Z,"@skurys - I just grabbed that 'webrip' but I have a feeling it might just be this one renamed.  same size, codec,  frame rate(25fps), etc. Anyone know?"
,skurys,2012-05-18T03:21Z,@twice ah crap i think you're right
,guyabano,2012-05-18T08:35Z,"Thanks, psspss. Not the best, but I appreciate it.

You're pretty awesome too because you were the only one who was uploading Top Shot for a while. :)"
[V],psspss,2012-05-18T09:35Z,"funny thing is hundreds in usa downloaded it

and yet most complain about quality .. why dont one of you rip it and upload it instead of moaning

your internet is better then ours too

first they moan at no episode then moan at quality never ends

just watch it on your laptops with vlc
and its ok"
,skurys,2012-05-18T16:16Z,"while free yes, and appreciated yes, i am patient also, so while i downloaded it, since normally this gets ripped by like 4 diff groups, ill wait awhile, and if no other pops up then ill watch what's available. 15fps just gives me a headache"
[V],psspss,2012-05-19T03:56Z,"

i see hes got a new fps mp4 up.. but havent sourced it and wont bother.

i let someone convert it to xvid for older devices as
im sick of the moaning here

and im happy to stick with this..

no doubt its still a screen capture he did.. but withhigher capture rate.
it will still be no good to the moaners LOL

they will want a HDtv one"
,pterrordactyls,2012-05-19T07:07Z,"people are so ungrateful. why sit and whine about something YOU'RE GETTING FOR FREE. the person who ripped this originally is risking getting into massive trouble for sharing copyrighted information, all so that you can sit comfortably in your lumpy bed with your laptop on your stomach and your hand buried in a bag of chips, watching mythbusters for free without having to pay for cable or moving to the living room. "
[V],psspss,2012-05-19T10:35Z,"not all of us are in usa

can be years before it even airs on tv in my country

thats why p2p lives and people take the risk

they dont want to wait for it and dont want to suffer ads"
,OneBigToe,2012-05-19T14:16Z,"Delayed here, plus incredibly hateful/hostile/offensive advertising.

Making me feel bad, I'll seed your torrent for a while... was trying to be helpful"
,igorivanov666,2012-05-19T16:44Z,"I case you missed it, I've posted the 29fps version from M-Byte http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7279377/Mythbusters_S10E08_x264_iTunes_29fps_M-BYTE_tv-links.eu"
,kornbred69,2012-05-20T09:45Z,"psspss.... not just vlc, but wmp classic, or windows media with the appropriate codecs, i use wmp with the k-lite codec pack-mega (not 64 bit, as the 64 bit versions are shit) and have never had a problem, unless i need to use classic to adjust the audio sync, but shit happens, especially when doing a lot of videos like you, vtv, tv team, and eztv do. so i would say thanks for being the first of the one's i trust for posting this episode!"
,kamatao,2012-05-20T20:26Z,Can anyone tell me what happened with this episode? It took more than usual to be released and with poor fps.
[V],psspss,2012-05-21T15:53Z,"VLC sharpener is unique.. no other players filter comes close.. ive played with most players
and even the converters plugins filters for conversions is no way as good results"
[V],psspss,2012-05-21T15:56Z,"in VLC
its under tools pulldown called filters the videos tab

also can find track sync there .. I think ctl-k and l
also do it and increase up or down per 100ms"
