"The Past in the Present"

Evil tech genius Christopher Pelant, 
a suspect in a previous case Brennan 
and Booth handled, is back in court 
on appeal. Knowing what he is 
capable of, Brennan and Booth inform 
the judge that he is a suspect in 
two murder cases. Then, Brennan and 
Booth are called to the scene of a 
new murder. After determining the 
victim is Brennan's friend, who also 
is linked to Pelant, the 
Jeffersonian team works to prove he 
is guilty once and for all. But when 
law enforcement examines the team's 
findings, key pieces of evidence are 
tied to Brennan and suspicion falls 
on her.
