,ngc6027,2012-05-22T11:01Z,"Hey EinDeutschMan,

I downloaded your Preinstalled edition of RS and all of your available languages (the pre-installed versions as well, not the ISOs). They almost all work like a charm, thank you! The only two I'm having issues with (I keep getting error #4112) are Japanese (I did get your updated 'Preinstalld' version, not the first non-working version) and Hebrew. Like I said, all the other ones work perfectly, thank you! I'm not sure if it matters, but I'm running Windows 7 64-bit OS. I did the normal extraction as I did with the software and the other language packs. Any reply would be greatly appreciated, and I can supply you with more info on my setup if needed."
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-22T15:52Z,"@ngc6027,

Error 4112 comes from corrupt language pack(s)
you can try to DL them again, and reinstall it, but I can't promise that it will work.

Also, I have apparently left out the speech portion of some languages,
and I'm in the process of correcting that.
So give me a day or so, and I will re UL the language pack(s) with ""& speech"" in the name.

Also, are you getting the same error# with the Hebrew?
Check back tonight (Tuesday)"
,ngc6027,2012-05-23T22:04Z,"Sorry, I didn't get a chance to get on the computer yesterday. I do get the same error # on the Hebrew pack. I'll try to DL them again today and post back."
,ngc6027,2012-05-24T04:48Z,"Okay, I DL'd and installed them both again and received the same error, #4112. "
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-24T21:19Z,"@ngc6027,

Error 4112 it a corrupt or missing language file.
I will DL it and see if I get the same error,

But in the mean time, go to C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta stone and see if the ""content"" folder is there.

when you open it, you should have 4 folders -Data, Documentation, Languages and Speech.

Also in the content folder, You should see these three files for Japanese:
SK-JPN-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3
SK-JPN-L2-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3
SK-JPN-L2-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3

And these three for Hebrew:
SK-HEB-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3
SK-HEB-L2-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3
SK-HEB-L3-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3

If you do NOT see these files, search your drive for Content, and move the whole folder over to
C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta stone"
,ngc6027,2012-05-24T22:49Z,"Okay, I've got them. They installed directly into C:/ instead of into Program Files. I'm moving them now. Thank you very much for your help!"
,Zephyrus21,2012-05-25T03:53Z,The files installed directly to C:/ and C:/Program Files (x86) was not created. I have all of the files in C:/. What do I do with them?
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-27T17:28Z,"Zephyrus21,

That's odd, I'll check into it, but here's the solution:

Go to C:/Program Files (x86) and create a folder named Rosetta Stone
Open THAT folder and create a folder named Content

NOTE: There should already be a folder in C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone named Rosetta Stone v3, don't worry about it, that's the program folder

When you get done it should look like this:
C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Content AND the Rosetta Stone v3 folders

O.K. So far?

Now go to where it installed the files 
there should be 4 FOLDERS that you have to move:
Data, Documentation, Languages and Speech.

There should also be 3 FILES you have to move:
SK-JPN-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-JPN-L2-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-JPN-L3-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi

Copy ALL of these files and folders into the Content folder.

Just a note, there are about a BAZILLION files in the Data folder 
(O.K. not a BAZILLION, but there ARE almost 85,000 files, 
so don't sweat it, it will take SEVERAL (10 or 15) minutes to copy them)

It will only take a minute or two to copy everything else

We're ALMOST done,

go to C:/ProgramData/Rosetta Stone and make sure that there are two files there:
DynamicStoredPaths.xml and Products.xml

If the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3
OR
The C:/ProgramData/Rosetta Stone are there, 
You're done.

If NOT, DL and extract this file:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272499/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_Preinstalled.exe

Then you'll be done!

Let me know"
,junipersunshine,2012-07-10T04:27Z,"I have a question. I downloaded the program already, and I tried your torrent for this language and the one for French, and both were stopped. Apparently, my access has been denied? How do I get around this?"
