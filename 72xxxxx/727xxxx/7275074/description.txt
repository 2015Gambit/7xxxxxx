Beatles "Around the World" actually contains three sections. First is complete version of the "Around the Beatles" TV broadcast from England. The theater sketch along with the music segments from all the artists (Cilla Black, etc.) and The Beatles music segment in pretty good quality (like the medley and Shout among many others.) This is the best quality overall of the 3 sections.

Next is the promo ad for theater showings of the first U.S. Washington D.C. concert program, and then the program straight through until the abrupt cut durring the next to last song. All the stage rotating and banter, along with the music is included. 

Third segment is the 1966 Tokyo "light suits" concert.
