,siddhesh20002004,2012-05-22T18:45Z,"Hi brother, Can you kindly confirm what is the region code for this game. Is it Region Free? Please advice."
,proftb,2012-05-25T18:36Z,"I just downloaded, burned and verified. Works great. Thanks a lot, uploader!

As for the language - I don't see an option to change from something else than English, but maybe I am not looking right.

I am also not sure what the region code is. Anyone an idea how I can check that? Anyway, it works for me (in Europe)."

,ITegoArcanaDei,2012-06-16T18:28Z,"This one solved my problems with Disc 2 not reading correctly.  Like many others, I originally downloaded the XPG release- Disc 1 worked perfectly, but Disc 2 was giving a variety or errors (not booting, the dirty disc error, unreadable disc error, stuttering and freezes during the 1st cutscene of the disc with Max on the cell phone, etc.).  Tried burning it twice with same results- I use the Lite-On iHAS with Verbatim discs (not sure if they are the mkm001 or mkm003) for two years with dozens of good burns.  So my thinking was that the XPG Disc 2 rip might possibly be a bad one.  Thus I tried DL'ing this one and, lo and behold, Disc 2 seems to be working fine now.  I have only been playing Chapter VII of the campaign (the first chapter on disc 2) for 20 minutes or so, but thus far no errors.  Those having problems with their Disc 2 might want to try out this one.
   I should also add for full disclosure that I burned this release at 2.4x speed, as opposed to my normal 4x, so it is possible that that is the reason why it worked.  Also, I noticed that the screen grab of agbx in the download lists the file name as being an XPG release- though when I ran it through agbx the name was changed.  Not sure what that signifies. "
