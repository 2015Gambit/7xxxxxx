,thet2811,2012-05-17T23:16Z,"I get an error everytime, so downing stops. It says: can't find element
Do you know what this can be?

thx"
,shallow2,2012-05-17T23:34Z,"@thet2811 how many % did you get. Know Merzedes had some problems with a dl too earlier, might be related to the down time the other day..

Anyone else have problems ? Lets not hope QS manage to shut down even torrents.."
,MrB8,2012-05-17T23:53Z,Many thanks to merzedes & Shallow2
,press2012,2012-05-18T00:37Z,">Anyone else have problems ? Lets not hope QS manage to shut down even torrents.. 

I am getting error messages as well. Perhaps time permitting a re up in say 5GB packs might help. TIA."
,nightprowler.,2012-05-18T01:06Z,"Wahbam!

That's a lot of Queensnake, you guys are too good to us."
,MediaLight,2012-05-18T01:14Z,WOW! Thanks Man!
,shallow2,2012-05-18T08:24Z,"Im leaving for work now, so will check status whhen I get home. By then, torrent will have seeded for about 20 hrs. Have seeded about 5x full now = 232 gb! :)

Are some/most getting this alright with some patience or are there problems all around ? See I have some dl's with 25-72% complete.

Also, what errors you get, and at which point in dl (%)

Have anyone asked on Suprbay forum what problems might be?

If this hasnt cleared up by evening Ill split pack and we'll reup. Files and folder will be the same so already dl parts will just recheck and continue where they left off.

Hope everything works out though :) l8r guys."
,thet2811,2012-05-18T10:18Z,I still keep getting errors. Even before 1%
,KalDeSnoar,2012-05-18T14:07Z,"Hi, mercedes !
Do you have more ""KinkyCore"" with Christine ?"
[V],merzedes,2012-05-18T17:28Z,"I think your problems to download this one is because you are from Holland ? They have started to close down ISPs. Here are a link you can try...For the dutch people,

Maybe this will help you,  we hope...."

,boyprime2002,2012-05-18T18:20Z,"@thet2811 - check the space on your DL drive, you maybe exceeding it's max capacity.  So you may want to give moving some completed items off, remember this is a 47 Gig torrent"
,thet2811,2012-05-18T19:26Z,"thx, Boyprime2002, but there is enough space on my HD.
I download with Bittorrent, and yes I'm from Holland. Even when I use http://tpb.webjoch.nl
 the errors keep coming
Does anyone have an idea for me.
thx advance, Thet"
[V],merzedes,2012-05-18T19:44Z,"thet2811@  Maybee you can try too download with Utorrent......

Cheers  :-)"
[V],merzedes,2012-05-18T20:08Z,"thet2811@  Is it only this one you have problem with or you having prob with all the torrents

Cheers  :-)"
,shallow2,2012-05-18T20:14Z,@thet2811: Try going into the Tracker List and select 'remove tracker' on the piratebay trackers. And then only use the Openbittorrent ones.. maybe that will help ??
,thet2811,2012-05-19T02:11Z,"Merzedes, this is the only one that causes problems. Bit now, it runs without erroors, only the down-speed is very slow..."
,thet2811,2012-05-19T02:14Z,"Downloading another file (ES) goes faster, with more than 3 Mb/sec, but the QS stuff onlu goes by 100 Kb/sec
I have a > 20 MB download speed???"
,shallow02,2012-05-19T09:58Z,I had to reduce QS upload speed to get the new kink.com finished :) will resume speed on QS later.
,shallow2,2012-05-20T00:44Z,Are people getting this ok now ?
,nik2512,2012-05-20T07:20Z,"Thank You Merzedes.. You are great..
Merzedes by any chance You have Decorativegirls video or rip? 
Please help me.


Thanks again for great upload... You are great Man.."
,thet2811,2012-05-20T10:34Z,"No errors anymore, thanx a lot"
,alvishork,2012-05-22T02:25Z,"Thanks so much for this upload, merzedes! 

Queensnake had to remove all the creepy-crawly videos from her site! Does anyone have Helix (the one with the snails)? It seems to be one of the only ones missing from this torrent. It would be amazing if someone could upload it!!!!!"
,jay.leung69,2012-06-02T03:02Z,has anyone completing downloaded all the files? 46.7 g is a lot. I appreciate that you provided the videos but its a lot to download at once. 
,jay.leung69,2012-06-02T03:10Z,can you split up the files and reupload? 46g is a lot to download at once. 
,shallow02,2012-06-08T02:09Z,"You dont have to dl everything at once. Just select 'dont download' on a bunch of them, and then you can go back and set low-normal or high priority and start one at a time.."
,press2012,2012-06-11T18:40Z,">You dont have to dl everything at once.

Thanks for posting. I may be wrong but I do not believe that dl just a few is the problem. The extra large file size discouraged to many down loaders and if anyone ever did get this they removed it from there main hard drive to a portable one. There just weren't enough seeders to make this one viable. I have expressed b4 in another post that it would be much appreciated if you could reup at your convenience in 10GB chunks. TIA"
