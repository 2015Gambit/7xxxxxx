out there..

its still worth a watch .. as its like a behind the scenes .. its 43min long LOL i think im the only one to release the footage on p2p?
i doubt many out their knew what they have been up too lately
but now you know

enjoy.. I wish I could see the full docu though.. is it even on their tv site?
I think only the other projects are? not sure

I stil dont know why they dont embrace p2p .. zero distribution costs
and the fans will support them. its not about pirating and copyright.

but you can see why they wanted to produce it all themselves
and cut out the middle man..

loving the work.."
[V],psspss,2012-05-19T10:07Z,"ok 23 seeders now.. I leave you to it..

if your a fan and keep seeding it.. more people
will get to hear about their work and documentaries
via p2p

if the torrent dies.. then so be it."
