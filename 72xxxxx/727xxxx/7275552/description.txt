Description

Have two computers? Ever wish you had an extra computer display? There's an app for that! With Air Display, you can turn your Mac into a wireless display, to extend the desktop of your other Mac or Windows computer.

Developed by Avatron Software, home of the popular Air Sharing and Print Sharing apps for iOS, Air Display lets you position your Mac next to your other computer, drag windows onto it, and interact with those windows as you would on any other computer display.

ΓÇö FEATURES ΓÇö

ΓÇó Air Display's performance is extremely responsive, employing a unique dynamic compression algorithm. On a typical Wi-Fi network, mouse cursor refreshes are indistinguishable from a wired mouse.

ΓÇó When you disconnect and reconnect, your windows automatically reposition, so you don't have to drag them back onto the Air Display screen.

ΓÇó You can choose to connect automatically to Air Display every time you launch the app (when connected to another Mac only, for now).

ΓÇó Can connect over Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

ΓÇó Runs full-screen or in a window.

ΓÇö INSTALLATION ΓÇö

1. Purchase this app from the Mac App Store on the Mac that you want to use as a second monitor.

2. When you first launch Air Display, it will present easy instructions for installing the drivers on your other computer.
