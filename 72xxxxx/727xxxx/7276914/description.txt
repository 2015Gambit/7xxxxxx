The offical DVD images for Ougon Musou Kyoku + Cross and the Patches for version 1.10 and 2.30. Must install patch 1.10 before installing expansion to Cross and then install 2.30 patches to unlock Willard H. Wright/Lambdadelta and Bernkastel as players! Enjoy the game and this will fix the problem with not being able to install updates from 07th website as Cross will be installed the right way.
