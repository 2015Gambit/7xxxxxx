,xDhe,2012-05-22T15:56Z,I can't seem to get the Cross Expansion installer to work. It keeps giving me an error message everytime after I select the installation directory. I've already run the setup for 1.00 and update for 1.10.
,WitchOfRiddles,2012-06-06T06:58Z,The 1st game and all expansions must be installed under japanese region. If you didnt install the 1st game then the expansion wont install. Also you can't just manually move the game folder from 1 place to another and then install you'll get errors. As for the expansion be sure to burn to DVD as use existing image or use daemon tools and mount it for the installer to pop up to install the game.
