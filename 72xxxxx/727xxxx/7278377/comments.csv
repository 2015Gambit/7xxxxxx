[H],NZPirate,2012-05-18T20:06Z,"Well its on heaps of other sites, so I guess it stays."
[T],Nighted,2012-05-19T03:15Z,"Theta isn't a scene group, I have never seen their releases on orlydb."
,OmniNegro,2012-05-19T04:54Z,"How did you get a purple skull if you have never heard of THETA?

They *Are* a release group.

Put THETA in the search and see for yourself."

I said ""scene"". 'nuff said. I'm sick of reading your stupid comments."
,Halibuty,2012-05-20T08:15Z,"Even though this is a very minor release, I've been waiting a long time for this crack and release.  Thanks for taking the time."

Grow the fuck up. ""Scene"" and ""Release"" mean exactly the same thing.

Hell, you even used the word ""releases"" in your idiot comment.

It is not an audio book, therefore you probably know jack shit about it.

Just because something does not exist on orlydb, that in no way means it ceases to exist.

Either STFU or die in a fire. I would hope for the former, but I would settle for the latter."
