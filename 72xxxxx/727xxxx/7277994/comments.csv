,marcoleetan1980,2012-05-20T01:51Z,1080p of this please... thank you.
,cnstarz,2012-05-20T06:43Z,"@razzss69 if you're getting codec errors, then download the right codecs, don't expect them to take extra time out of their time to cater to you.  they're the ones ripping it and uploading it, at least do your part to make sure you can play the damn file.  i suggest VLC or media player classic with CoreAVC codecs. ;) "
,saiamaka,2012-05-20T08:19Z,Thanx Yify. Am waiting for 1080p. Cheers for the good work.
,klearlycanadian,2012-05-20T09:23Z,"All hail Sifu YIFY.  Master of the scene.  Thank you for this.  As for codec and proper player.  Forget VLC!  If you have a decent rig please look into pot player and how to set it up for HD playback.

For your convenience here is the link to the guide for Daum's Pot Player.  It's the awesome spiritual successor to KMP.

,klearlycanadian,2012-05-20T09:29Z,"O yeah one more comment.  What does the acronym YIFY stand for again.  I thought I'd read it somewhere but I must be mistaken.

Did I mention pot player is awesome?"
,B3lanuj,2012-05-21T01:13Z,"Thanks yify for this movie...oh yeah, i also use Pot Player, it is almost compatible to all format and it rarely crashes... VLC sucks,it crashes  whenver i play bigsize movies.."

,rohit2310,2012-05-26T18:36Z,"@ razzss69 :

Man try to download new codecs for your system. I did the same too. These movies  are in High Definition so therefore also require a player for it to play.
I am now using Media Player Classic latest version with upto date codecs. 
No Problem at all watching this movies now.

@ Team YIFY....: Guys great job ..ALL Torrents are great with pure HD quality where the file size is mere 700MB or less.
Worth watching your torrents & will download & seed your torrents"
