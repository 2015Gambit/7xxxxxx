,bw95,2012-06-17T01:17Z,Didn't work for me. Whenever I downloaded all I got was .mkv & .srt files and they 7 seconds long and had nothing on them. Am I just doing something wrong?
,firstmen,2012-06-27T03:35Z,"Thanks for the upload man! I've been meaning to see what this series is all about.

And just out of curiosity, why is the piece size 8MB?"
,userr1,2012-07-24T06:09Z,"Could you please upload a .sfv or .md5 file containing the CRCs or MD5s of each of the Doctor Who torrents you have uploaded, to mediafire, and post the link here? It would be very helpful."
,RoflWafffles,2012-08-02T16:06Z,Could you guys please seed? I really want to start watching this show. Going at about 20kb/s.
,RoflWafffles,2012-08-03T07:05Z,"Don't be selfish, and seed :/. At this rate I'll be done in 2 years. No exaggeration. "
