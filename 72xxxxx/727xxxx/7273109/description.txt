Do you like true works of art? Do you like nonsense? Then you /might/ just like Tobey McTired's beautiful existence: "A Number Between Juan and Ninety-Nine". Its baby's first album!

Featuring the skills of professional artists such as musician gurus Appidoodle & Sir Wolfs-a-Lot ('Aptiva' and 'Wolfy' of prog rock bands Freen in Green & Wolfblur (respectively)), this work-in-progress album is kid tested and mother approved! Get your first album today, as soon as possible, por favor. Do it for the seals!

No really. All potential funds gained from this album are immediately sent to the department of McTiredLand so that these poachers and furtrappers would quit whipping up on my favorite baby seal. So once again, DO IT FOR THE SEALS!

Are you confused, yet? Good. Here's a gecko painting a picture. I love you and you love this album too.
