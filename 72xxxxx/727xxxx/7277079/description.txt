The primary concept in this book teaches that man must  be a challenge to the woman he is interested in. Challenge, according to Doc Love, is the most important reason that a woman is attracted to and chooses to stay in a relationship with one man over another. Challenge is defined as "allowing the woman to do the pursuing". Other key ideas in "The System" include a list of Male Traits and Female Traits.

Doc Love's additional ideas from his philosophy include bringing salesmanship into the area of dating, namely by "closing the deal" with a woman by getting her HOME phone number.
