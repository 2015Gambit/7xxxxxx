We used to be surprised when foreigners proferred some Maltese expression.
Today a good number have found it useful and wise that in an independent country with a political press in Maltese and with a lot of business being conducted in our language one should understand directly and not through the medium of translation.
The number of those academics who see in Maltese a strange linguistic mixture is also increasing. All these will find it a pleasure to have this learning pack in their BitTorrent client.
It is a timely publication in that it not only helps those who already had a reason to learn the language, it will also arouse the interest of those who may have had occasion to come across it.

We wish it every success!

Dr. Ugo Mifsud Bonnici
