Missing is an American mystery thriller drama television series, starring Ashley Judd and Cliff Curtis.

The series follows Rebecca "Becca" Winstone (Ashley Judd), a widow and retired CIA agent with an 18-year-old son, Michael (Nick Eversman). In 2001, when Becca and her husband Paul Winstone (Sean Bean) were active CIA agents, he was killed in a car bombing witnessed by their son. In the pilot episode, Michael informs his mother that he has been accepted to a summer architecture program in Rome, Italy. Becca, who now lives an ordinary life running a florist shop, is hesitant to let him go but gives in. After not hearing from him for over a week and receiving a call from the architecture school informing her that Michael has moved out of his dorm room, Becca travels to Rome to track him down; but she finds herself in the middle of an international conspiracy involving the CIA and an Interpol agent who was once her lover.
