Just my opinion obviously but this movie is crap. Seann Williams Scott's character is so odd and I couldn't really get past it. I understand he's supposed to be a nice guy that can just beat the shit out of people but the character just comes off awkward. I'd say the character seems more like he borders on retarded. 

I would say it's not really worth watching. I also wish they would stop giving roles to Jay Baruchel. He was crap in this and crap in The Sorcerer's Apprentice. I did think he did good in Tropic Thunder though... "

Happy to see somebody else who liked this movie, its different and seann does a really good job doing this movie."

If you liked this for the non Stifler character, check out, Stark Raving Mad... If you can find it with seeders! (if you do, please let me know!)"
