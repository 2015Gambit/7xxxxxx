Aren't you ashamed that YOUR English movie was ripped faster by Russians than your own English people ??? Why do you come to comment here even though you KNOW this movie is in Russian ?? It is like searching a movie with ""RU"" in it and then commenting on it ""WHY IS THIS NOT ENGLISH"". It is clearly stated that spoken language is Russian, why do you complain that Russian spoken movie is not English ? You don't make those movies, Hollywood does and I am sure they would agree that making them in Russian language makes it available to watch for like another 1/4 of population.

@LeLoup9

I could problaly name more countries where people speak Russian than countries where people speak English. Russian hackers are the best in the world and only because they rip movie in their country faster than your own English hackers do than it is not their problem, it just shows how dedicated they are for their hobbies. You guys make me want to think that you want to seperate humans by such things as language etc. Don't go to a Russian movie and complain that it is in Russian. That is completely retarded."

You get everything for free and still complain about it. Spoiled much ? Amerikan is just my private way of saying American, because honestly I am tired of saying that word and everytime I see it there is this American accent in my head pronouncing it. Oh and guess what people: you can go to trackers like rutracker dot org. It is a Russian tracker and they got like shitloads of English movies translated into their language.

You are a complete fool if you think Stalin was a good man in ANY way. Even Lenin saw him for the evil man he was and tried to prevent him from becoming leader. Stalin was WORSE than Hitler in many ways. 

Sure, Hitler killed tons of Jews and many other nationalities, but Stalin brutally and constantly murdered HIS OWN PEOPLE. Including the people closest to him in his life. You need to educate yourself about Stalin. I could spend all day listing off the evil of that man. 

The fact that ANYONE in Russia could still regard him as a good leader only goes to show how brainwashed they are/were. It would be one thing if it were just the old people but now the young still let themselves be dominated by a dictator. Russia even to this day isn't free. This has been proven several times by the watchdog group freedom house. 

The west may have their share of bad leaders now and again, but Russia consistently lets itself be complete subjects to its leaders will more than any major country in this world. "
