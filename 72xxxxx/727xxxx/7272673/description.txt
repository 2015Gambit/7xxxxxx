DESCRIPTION:

Something is clearly rotten in our Republic. Americans have lost faith in their politicians to a greater degree than ever, resigning themselves 
to ΓÇ£the best Congress money can buy,ΓÇ¥ as the comic Will Rogers once put it. It doesnΓÇÖt matter whether they are Democrats or Republicans, 
people are disillusioned and angry as hell. They feel like outsiders in their own nation, powerless over their own lives, blocked from having a 
real voice in how they are governed.
