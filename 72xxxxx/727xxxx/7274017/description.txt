Release Info:

Mind boggling, spiralling psychedelic melodic Goa-trance in its purest form!


Crossing Mind is French artist Stephane Beze, making fantastic, intense, multi-layered Goa-trance for over 10 years. He caught a lot of attention in the 'old school' Goa-trance scene in the last 2 years with an album on DAT records containing older unreleased tracks, a free online EP on UAF Records and several tracks on Suntrip compilations.

Today Suntrip Records is proud to present his first up to date album filled with 8 fractal stormers!

'The Inner Shift' starts with a slower deep story-telling track continued by several dance floor devastators. Tracks like Solarnium, Modulated Self Reminders, Magnetic Fields of Life, Elastic Harmonies and No Way Wrong Rmx are a treat for the brain! Earcandy for everyone who loves multi-layered melodic music. Expect melodies, spiced up with acidic sounds and hypnotic background atmospheres. Besides that, every track is a great story teller. When you listen carefully, we promise you a hell of a trip to colourful lands!

The last two tracks, Plutonia and Optronic Circles Rmx, are downtempo tracks to give you a peaceful landing back into reality!

Are you ready for it!?
