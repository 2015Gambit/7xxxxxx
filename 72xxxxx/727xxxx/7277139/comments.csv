,Thooty,2012-05-18T18:01Z,"@kalaznikob
Shut up please! Don't be stupid... It works fine, I just need my language pack. And thanks for upload and patch, it's much better then editing hosts file."
,Crusisx,2012-05-18T18:29Z,"@kalaznikob
Ha ha ha looks like we got a comedian in here because its a download straight from adobe and 2 dll patch files 32 bit and 64 bit they both work there both clean scanned them myself before upload i never upload anything that has a virus, trojan, backdoor, cloud, malware, keylogger, rat ect."
,Crusisx,2012-05-18T23:03Z,"@Rock_Flint
lol i guarantee that there clean like i said before all it is, is just a download from adobes website with all the files you need to initialize the installer, with 2 harmless and clean dll files. I can understand where your coming from, because i to myself wouldn't trust it if they said its clean with no proof unfortunately I do not know any good website that scan the file and give a list of all anti virus software to see if anything was picked up, your just going to have to trust me here, and if your pc gets fucked up because of it then you can sue me fair enough?"
,Thooty,2012-05-18T23:42Z,"I have noticed now, when I open a Photoshop it's say ""Photoshop CS6"" but not ""Photoshop CS6 Extended"" and I don't see in the menu ""3D"" . So where is the problem? I used just that patch files amtlib.dll and it won't work as EXTENDED :-)"
,vosomoso,2012-05-19T00:01Z,Crusisx. It's great that you have done this torrent but Have you done something clever with your .dll files because Photoshop CS5 and earlier torrents had a keygen as well as the amtlib.dll
,Thooty,2012-05-19T00:04Z,"Oh sorry, I forgot to open Photoshop before patch that amtlib.dll, now it works fine as Extended version :-) But I downloaded it from Adobe website with my language pack and just used that patch file and works fine.
---
Instruction I used (i found it on another torrent)
1.Download the torrent 

2.Extract the contents with 7zip or winrar

3.Disconnect the internet

4.Run as adminstrator

5.choose the language

6.say I have a key
use the following serials:


1325-0949-2080-9819-3777-3230

1325-0160-5283-9851-2671-8951

7.it says no active internet connection, say validate later

8.wait till the installation is over

9.edit the hosts file or use the one i have uploaded

10.for x86 run the Photoshop it should show the same screen as mine; close it then replace dll file/ 

11.for x64 bit users better replace the dll file for x86 and run the x64 Photoshop and the viceversa it should show the same screen as mine and later replace dll files for both x86 and x64
12. Reconnect to internet

Cheers :-)"
,K_nakamura,2012-05-19T00:53Z,"can somebody tell me if this version has te full filters after install (the other torrent lack some filters and some liquify features, because there is no serial number) so i can leech and seed
thanks"
,JusoKmac,2012-05-19T16:45Z,"Just tried installing this and it doesn't work. The damn instructions provided don't even help. After I copied over the .dll and reconnected my internet, photoshop said I had an invalid liscense and stuck me with a 30 day trial.

Shitty torrent and possibly a virus."
,Crusisx,2012-05-19T21:02Z,"@JusoKmac
The instructions are fine and you don't really need to disconnect from the internet just install as trial then open up the photoshop cs6 and activate your trial then close photoshop cs6 now copy in the corresponding dll files for your system if you have 32 bit then you just want the 32bit dll if you have a 64 bit then you want to copy both 32 bit and 64 bit dlls in the program files folder and the program files x86 folder run photoshop cs6 no trial anymore there is no need to disconnect your internet and a virus pfft please if you think its a virus than go ahead and scan everything in there guarantee it will say its clean"
,still_dre_day,2012-05-20T09:35Z,"this isnt extended, its just the normal version"
,Crusisx,2012-05-20T12:01Z,nope this is the extended version
,still_dre_day,2012-05-20T12:12Z,also this is the pre release and is not the proper photoshop cs6
,Crusisx,2012-05-20T20:57Z,OMG quit trolling this is the extended version and its not the damn pre release this is the full version downloaded from adobes website nothings been altered at all trust me the pre release was much different then this one
,celticwarrior22,2012-05-20T22:19Z,"1. To the the idiots saying this torrent has a virus, it doesn't so quit your fucking trolling.

2. To the people who can't get it to work, that's YOUR fault and has nothing to do with anything else but YOU. It works fine, just follow the simple instructions provided.

3. It's not running at the extended version for me, just Photoshop CS6 but I'm not too bothered about that anyway but yeah, people seem to be right about that.

4. It's not a pre-release version, it's the proper, full Photoshop CS6.

Anyway, good upload Crusisx and thank you.

10/10"
,Crusisx,2012-05-20T23:21Z,"@celticwarrior22
Thank you and when I installed mine i have Photoshop CS6 Extended idk why no one else is getting kinda of weird but I might just repackage and upload this again with more language packs and a little more simpler instructions maybe ill include a video tutorial in the file it self idk well for those who got it working congrats and for those who didn't you didn't follow the instructions carefully"

,garrettkillu,2012-05-22T22:00Z,GUYS! I think i may know why it doesn't work for many people. you have to copy the cracked files not into the AMT folder but outside the AMT folder!
,devildie1,2012-05-23T18:58Z,"* 3D features and some GPU-enabled features are not supported on Windows XP.

maybe you should put that in description..
put also System Requirement.."
,colts2609,2012-05-23T19:14Z,"Perfect. For 64 bit people copy both 32 and 64 bit patches into, not inside the amt folder in the cs6 program file. Works great thanks man"
,Mercermagi,2012-05-23T23:36Z,"Photoshop works fine but it's not Extended. Also Colts2609 if you put both 32 and 64 bit patches into the folder the 64 overrides the 32. Why would you need to do both? I only added the 64 bit patch and it works for me.
THANKS CRUSISX!"
,Crusisx,2012-05-24T21:58Z,alright for those who say this isnt the extended version i assure you it is for visual proof and a btter tutorial look up on youtube and type in CrusisxSoftware Photoshop CS6 Install if u dont find the video then just search for CrusisxSoftware then click my channel name browse my videos for the how to get photoshop cs6 for free and install

,Bonesman1990,2012-05-28T13:38Z,"It's the Beta. There is no option within the Type Options dialog for Font Sample Size in this version and thus, it is NOT the retail version.

Just one question:
I have done just like the instructions. photoshop opens and its extended version.  however as far as I know the way to know it's activated and not trial is to go to Help menu and if there's an Deactivate button not in grey then it is good to go but in my case the deactivation button is in grey color. does it mean I'm still on trial?!

as I mentioned before I have copied and overwrite those patch files in their respective directories.

* by the way I don't have 3D options available (I'm not using windows XP) and 3D is still available on my CS5 extended version.maybe CS6 requires more advanced graphic card."

but i try this one with my own idea, itry to explore to run your program CS6 Ext. with compatibity mode into Windows 95 after i apply then i run the program 'surprisingly' theirs a 3D tab menu appears but when use the program then save my work when i click the save bottom the windows exit and when itry to run again the window didnt appear so i restart my pc and then uncheck the compatibity mode then back to normal CS6 Ext. with no 3D menu

my OS is XP professional 32bit x86 intel chipset

i look in the settings
heres what ive found out

Graphics Processor Settings

No GPU options available with Photoshop Standard.

pls share if you have a solutions tnx more power"

Going by memory:

►Use Adobe ID.

►Copy .dll files to crack.

could you please tell me if this torrent has all the filters and the liquify features complete?
the other torrents are missing this elements, even the version that i downloaded from adobe, maybe it needs a serial number to unlock everything, i dont know.
thanks"
,Nagatosan,2012-07-08T04:43Z,"Great upload! Thank you very much, Crusisx!

The instructions were fine, but if anyone needs finer detail:
1. Install Photoshop - select the ""TRY"" option. (Install 32 and/or 64 bit.) Make the Adobe ID account, you really don't have to confirm anything, so no harm done.

2. When you're done installing, open/run Photoshop, start your trial, make sure it says ""Extended"" or when Photoshop finally loads, there is a ""3D"" tab between the ""Filters"" and ""View"" tab. Exit out of Photoshop!

3. Now go in the patch folder

4. If you installed the 32 bit one, copy the amtlib.dll file from the folder labeled ""32bit"" in the folder ""Patch"" and ""copy and replace"" the one in your computer C:Program Files (x86)AdobeAdobe Photoshop CS6. If you installed the 64 bit one, copy the amtlib.dll file from the folder labeled ""64bit"" in the folder ""Patch"" and ""copy and replace"" the one in your computer C:Program FilesAdobeAdobe Photoshop CS6 (64 Bit)"

,Axxo977,2012-07-15T23:13Z,I have a question? Is Adobe tools fully functional ? I noticed with a different uploader that the Adobe tools wasn't working with his torrent yet? Also can this program be updated normally or do I have to do the updates manually from the adobe site?
,keithallen,2012-07-17T19:20Z,"I also am coming up with ""00 Days Left""  when I reinstall the package. This prevents a trial run with ""Extended"" privileges, resulting in plain CS6 after replacing amtlib.dll.  I have been trying reinstalls to get ""RAW"" working in Bridge. Thanks for any help!"
,allen_04,2012-07-18T05:28Z,"works great!!i followed your you tube instructions!!
thanks!
-make an adobe account
-download torrent
-run as admin..then click ""try for a limited time""
-choose language on upper left box
-login with your adobe account
-install....takes 10-45 mins.
-go to the torrent folder->patch->32 bit.>..copy the amtlib.dll
_now go to hard disk->program files->adobe->adobe photoshopcs6->then paste the file (replace if noted)
-Do the same for 64 bit (if your PC can go 64 bit)
done :)"

7. Patch the files.
8. start application again.
