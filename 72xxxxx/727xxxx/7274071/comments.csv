For my own collection ive made the  Sony-BMG album ""Tomorrow is a long time"" with the same front cover and that include those songs and not the movie songs produced / co-written by Billy Strange(i'm a fan) so i did create this one

[V],jeroep,2012-05-18T19:59Z,Great compilation! The songs on the Camden label are great. It was a shame that they didn't put it on the RCA album at first. Thanks again!
,LeGrinde,2012-08-08T08:16Z,"This was the 1st of yours that I downloaded and was very very surprised to hear how great it sounded! Then I checked to see if one of my all-time fav Elvis songs was here (since I heard it first on a Camden album): Wonderful World. It's not here :-(  But that's ok, everything that is here is fantastic! Charro is especially great! You get such rich, full sound--much better than those Elvis Double Feature soundtracks they put out a while ago"
