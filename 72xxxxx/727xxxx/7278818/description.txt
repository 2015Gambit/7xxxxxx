Thro the Mist, Fog, Steam and Smoke - a DJ mix by the Tapestry Weavers


Voyage down the road less travelled.

This epic two hour DJ mix focuses on drones, feedback, distortion and reverb - merging Avant-garde, guitar feedback, freeform jazz, dub, electronica and trance with smokey cocktail lounge jazz.

Venture through the mist, fog and steam, into the smokey dancehalls and ballrooms - only when you are dancing can you feel free.
