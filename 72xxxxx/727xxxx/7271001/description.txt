________________________________________

    King Records originally assembled this album in 1958, five years
    after Hawkins left the label, but long before his return in 1962.
    Surprisingly, while it contains "Slow Poke" and "Sunny Side of the
    Mountain," it doesn't have his other big hits from his first period
    with the label, including "I Love You a Thousand Ways" and "Dog
    House Boogie." It does offer a cross section of his honky tonk and
    traditional country material; Hawkins could be ultra-sentimental,
    but he could also boogie with the best of them, and this disc fills
    in some holes left by the Bear Family box. There are, as usual for
    King, no notes or session information and no information on the year
    of release of any of the songs. The audio quality on the 1988
    remastering leaves something to be desired -- the sonics on some of
    it are a bit compressed, but there may not be much that can be done
    about this, as some of the stuff goes back to the mid-'40s, and the
    producers have at least had the courage to pump the volume up high,
    so the guitars are nice and loud (check "Rattlesnakin' Daddy").
