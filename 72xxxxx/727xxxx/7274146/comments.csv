,Limrocker,2012-05-17T13:47Z,"This is a fantastic torrent, saw it in the Cinema already and wanted to watch at home with the GF. The sound is great, there is a slight crop at the top of the picture but doesn't interfere with film. As a cam 10/10, probably the best cam I've ever watched. Great work. "

,lancebunny,2012-05-30T12:30Z,"pretty good for a cam, not quite dvd rip but i dont give a shit

A: 10
V: 8"
,kakarott72,2012-06-04T14:18Z,"quality looks great, only down side i can see is that the translation of the russian conversation was incorrect, around 12:47 the guy either called black widow a beautiful/pretty face and she responded with you think i'm beautiful/pretty, i can't remember which one it was.

but that aside this is still the best copy i have been able to find thanks alot to the uploader for this copy.

v:8
a:8"
,gdeanu,2012-06-07T00:31Z,Downloaded Saturday and received a Copyright Infringement Notice dated Sunday from Mediacom regarding this movie.  I don't know if the problem is on my end or the torrent's but I'd be weary if I were looking at this torrent. 
,yohomofo,2012-06-09T03:44Z,"Best ever. Great Job, thanks!"
,SkinnyBones18,2012-06-09T17:25Z,"Fast torrent, downloaded in 6m 15s"
,Omnicae,2012-06-09T22:06Z,"Why say TS, if its a CAM ?"
,robison2,2012-06-11T00:06Z,why piss and moan if you're getting it for free and don't have to do anything to watch it other than complain? thanks for the uL and the hard work envolved Bone :)
,Sean1998,2012-06-11T08:12Z,"Good quality for a CAM. V=8, A=9. Thanks .BONE. :)"
,spifkitten99,2012-06-11T11:59Z,"robison2, you are retarded, and should go to a doctor, so you can be placed in a protected home.

That it's free has no relevance.

If it's a cam, then the title should say it's a cam."
,spifkitten99,2012-06-11T12:00Z,"robison2, by the way. Don't complain about my comment. It was free, and so was the comment you did complain about, so you are quite a hypocrite."
,spifkitten99,2012-06-11T12:08Z,"robison2, why piss and moan about his comment, when his comment was free?

You're a retarded hypocrite.

That it's free has no relevance. The title and description should not say it's a TS, if it's not a TS.

We need comments that tell us about wrong information.

,StaticChamber,2012-06-13T00:54Z,"@Omnicae - If you are going to bitch about how a title is written, maybe you should learn what the fuckin definitions of TS, Cam, R5, HDrip, DVDrip, and so on actually mean...

A TS IS a fucking Cam with the audio source recorded directly from the audio out source in the theater OR with HD mics @ the speakers.

I haven't watched this copy yet but all you idiots that don't know the difference and bitch about a free movie need to eat a dick. On the same note, a poorer quality movie will look like smashed assholes on an HD tv but may look fine on a SD tv. So again, Stop bitching you ass clowns and thank someone for once in your life for making the effort to do you a favor..."

,rkanejm,2012-07-10T17:47Z,"Oh no you got a notification from your ISP! That isn't the uploader's fault. If you're going to dl torrents then it's all about CYA (cover your ass) cause no one else is going to do it for you. There are ways to avoid being tracked such as using the infamous PeerBlock which updates its P2P lists just about daily to keep our filching pirate butts out of trouble. Don't spam out the torrents because you aren't being careful enough, they have enough issues with covering their own asses and don't have the time to be worried about you."
