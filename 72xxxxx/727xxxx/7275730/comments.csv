M1 (my opinion)

here's what i hated about it. bad acting (or bad dialogue? or both), bad pacing/story telling (i was getting real bored), and the physics of everything. (i know it's a fantasy film and to a certain degree you have to be able to buy into the fiction to enjoy it but this was just too horrible that i couldn't) if he can jump that high cuz of the weaker gravity, it means all his muscles are proportionately stronger than everyone else, yet there are scenes where he's being held up by the neck by an individual alien guy. if he could theoretically jump that high, he should also be strong enough to rip 1 alien in half with his bare hands. he should have been kicking way more ass than he did. and just the sheer fact that you see him struggle with the weaker gravity at first,(which mars' gravity isn't that different from earth's so it's ridiculous but i can totally look past that cuz the premise of weaker gravity, therefore superior strength is pretty awesome) but then on the next scene you see him walking like it's normal earth gravity. (ever seen someone walk on the moon? you can't just walk like it's normal gravity even if you tried.) i know i know it's a fantasy movie and you can't enjoy it if you nitpick like i do, but i just couldn't enjoy it cuz of my intuitive understanding of how ludicrous the physics was. i feel like it was lazy film making. they could have tried to make a lil more sense of it in that department.

and to those who say you would like the film more if you read the books, i'm sure that's true, but that doesn't excuse how shitty the film is(in my opinion). a film is a medium in itself and should be enjoyable to everyone whether they read the material or not. i'm sure the book series are superb cuz it's got tons of fans. but this movie is stuck in limbo. only kids could look past all the physics bullcrap, but the original material/plot/characterization is not for kids. ppl blame the marketing for its box office flop and that's probably part of it but it's just a bad movie as well. this is all merely my opinion. if you enjoyed it, that's awesome. more power to you."

guess it sucks not being able to sit back and enjoy a film for it's entertainment value, which this is good at, without checking to see if the film follows the laws of the universe. if that's your only complaint, and hated the movie that bad, then you suck at life.

i enjoyed the film. watched it twice actually. how you are able to fit a meat sausage as big as an arm in your arse is against 'physics', but nobody is complaining about that.

@cornellial

on that subject of criticizing the physics, you can also point out that the terminal velocity on such a weak gravity planet would be much slower, thus if one could jump that high, he would float down much more slowly. (like on the moon) if he theoretically did jump that high and land at the speed he did, it would be no different than jumping off a building. there's no reason why he wouldn't break his legs.
as for the movie itself, i definitely thought there were some gratuitous and cool scenes. but for the most, yes it was a little too silly. my little brother enjoyed it though. i think it's a solid film for kids."

,leftstep,2012-05-23T18:18Z,"A9V9

@arikel   Your comment towards others and what should happen with them should be applied directly to yourself.  Nobody cares that you care so much about how other people feel about a movie you don't like.   Keep that shit to yourself.


As for the movie - I had to watch it, just because of the epic flop it was - and I enjoyed it thoroughly."

,Cobb099,2012-05-23T23:30Z,"It's freakin movie people.  This isn't a documentary, or a physics lecture, or a historical re-enactment.   If all we did was make movies that have accurate physics and such the sci-fi/action field of movies would just be NOVA documentaries.  Turn off your logical, nit picky part of your mind and let the part that loves big explosions and impossible events run wild.  "
,boombox82,2012-05-24T00:23Z,"Thank you Exzone love your work!!
A 10 V 10 M waste of my life.
Cornelial ~ I agree. I haven't seen a Disney movie I enjoyed since Aladin. I was amazed there was a tiny plot twist at the very end. Everyone has their own opinion; who is to say what you can and cannot post here? Telling someone what he/she cannot write online, on TPB no less, is complete hypocrisy. The site IS internet freedom. Go ahead tell me what you please. I will continue not caring about anything you say.   "

,7thWonder,2012-06-03T19:02Z,"I thought this movie was awesome. The problem is that these movies serve a purpose, which is to entertain us... Nothing more, nothing less. So you have to go into watching this movie with the right mind set.. That the acting, literature, vocabulary, and plot is somewhat dumbed-down, so that everyone and their mom can understand the plot and get the gist of the basic morality of the story; which is that good overcomes evil. Take the movie for what it is, a movie, and enjoy it as best as you can. No need to rant about the movie, other than the quality."

,bpellmann,2012-06-09T03:22Z,This is the third time Disney has sent me a warning about downloading copyright material. I have changed my IP and spoofed my MAC several times. Be careful when downloading any Disney owned material. With that being said is there any safe alternatives to downloading illegal material? Peergaurdian doesnt cut it my ISP (Charter) detects it everytime and seems to send me more warning when I use it.  I know VPN's work but are there any free ones that down bottleneck my Download speed so much?
