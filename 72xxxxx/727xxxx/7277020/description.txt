Klaus Krippendorff is an influential figure in communication studies widely known for his book Content Analysis. Over the years, Krippendorff has made important contributions to a host of fundamental issues concerning communication scholarship: theory, epistemology, critical scholarship, second-order cybernetics, the construction of reality through language, design, and meaning. On Communicating assembles Krippendorff's most influential writings-many of which are virtually unavailable today, appearing in journals, less accessible publications, conference proceedings, out-of-print book chapters, and articles in journals outside the communication field. In their totality, they provide a goldmine for communication students and scholars. Edited and with a critical introduction by Fernando Bermejo, this book introduces readers to Krippendorff's most important works.
