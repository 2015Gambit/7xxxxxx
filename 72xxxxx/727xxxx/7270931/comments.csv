,TheRealAngelMike,2012-05-17T14:09Z,"Pleae upload Ghost hunters ep 12....cus other ones prolly upload crap, and you know they will....."
,saka0529,2012-05-18T08:09Z,"Sorry guys, i dont think he is back. to bad, TN was one of the best uploaders. As ghost hunters says ""onto the next brother"""
,luapttam85,2012-07-03T10:30Z,"Dammit. We've lost another great uploader because of one asshole. 

tNe please don't stop because of that dick. "
[T],trialNerror,2012-07-04T20:04Z,"you guys don't know how much i want to come back at times. i've even perfected those x264 mp4's to have flawless audio and in sync every time. however, there's other things going on right now and i'm not sure if i even can come back.

if i do release torrents again, they will have a small, non-obstructive, transparent watermark on them so if anybody does take it, convert it, and re-release it, those who download the re-release will know for sure where it originally came from. i highly doubt that one guy knows how to remove them since he uses junky software with limited options. even if he did some research on how to remove a watermark it's going to leave a blurry spot.  it'll irritate him, that's for sure, and that'll make me smile.

he already makes me smile. i love how he wastes so much time converting stuff when other teams that know what they're doing release better xvid versions. reading some of his comments crack me up, too. i am so amused at how much bandwidth he wastes each month and also how much money he wastes each month on a vpn and proxies. absolutely loving it! doesn't he realize there's still a digital trail that points directly back to him? cheap vpn's and proxies are not always going to be %100 guaranteed protection. peerblock really doesn't do a thing. bad IP's change all the time and the blocklists will never be on top of it. as an IT guy once said, no security is better than false security. don't take any security advice from you know who. 

if all you are dealing with is tv shows you don't need any extra protection. nobody is tracking those and nobody is handing out infringement warnings for them. if you're getting movies and music via torrents, well that's just stupid. if you must get those then use direct download links on RLS sites, not the industry monitored bittorrent network. i've been using the RLS download links for over a year now for brand new stuff and not a single warning letter. i tried getting something new with a torrent and BAM they sent a warning letter.

o'kay that's enough for now. we'll see about tNe coming back; but right now, no. the shows i once did are now being done by reputable groups in scene."
,the_crown,2012-07-12T10:46Z,"Dunno if you'll see this but -- the ptvs blog is gone! Did you remove it or was it taken down? I'm in a panic! How else will I know what's going on in the para/crypto world? It was a small but fun community. Have you perhaps moved it? Were you guys on IRC at all?

[T],trialNerror,2012-07-12T23:50Z,"it was down.

,bubbanuggzz,2012-07-14T11:33Z,"what a bitchy little twat you are.if your shits so much better than psspss....oh,I'm sorry...I mean ""the other guy"" than upload it.you sound like the type thats all about being king of the hill until you see someone else start to climb up it,than you shit yourself & run away.I used to love your work & to be honest its better than his on the mainstream stuff,but he goes out of his way to post shit you've never even herd of.so unless your a 15year old who's mommy caught him downloading porn & took his computer away than suck it up & post new conntent"
