This was CIRCUS' debut from 1976.It's quite mellow with lots of flute.It's interesting that the vocalist sometimes sounds like Ian Anderson and at other times like Peter Hammill.He sings in a reserved manner for the most part which suits the music here.I should mention that many consider the follow-up to this "Movin On" to be a minor classic. "Stormsplineter" settles in with vocals quickly as flute plays over top.His vocals remind me of Ian Anderson here.Some impressive bass later. "Nowadays" is barely audible for over 2 minutes then it kicks in.It's quiet again before 4 minutes as contrasts continue. "Sundays" is mellow with keys,guitar,flute and drums standing out.Vocals join in around 1 1/2 minutes.Lots of flute when the vocals stop. "Dawntalk" doesn't have much going on and no melody until after 2 minutes.Sax and flute arrive later.Some prominant bass too. "Room For Sale" is the over 15 minute closer.It picks up before 2 minutes with flute,guitar,bass and drums.Vocals 4 1/2 minutes in as it settles right down.Some chunky bass 6 minutes in.I like the instrumental section before 10 minutes to 12 1/2 minutes. A good album without a doubt but the next one is an improvement in pretty much every area.
