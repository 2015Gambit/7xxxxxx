(You did say it was xvid,mp3 and 1100 bitrate)
I was wondering about display resolution and frame rate. Most non-scene releases without a sample usually give more info.
Thank you very much for your time"

,stewox,2012-06-15T11:30Z,"Why are people still going with this awful terrible Xvid Divx quality bullcrap in this time and age.

Killers and Momentum scene stopped uploading HDTV versions of american chopper for a while now, hopefully they come back, because I have a pretty good samsung HDTV and want to watch it in actual quality I bought the device for, im definitely not going to watch it in this quality.

1.6 GB is perfect for one episode, 1.1 GB is enough as well, but anything below that is ridicolous.

This stupid 350 MB shit needs to die already. I have 3x 500 GB and 2x 1TB HDDs lying around the house, plus one SSD ... who the fuck cares about space this days come on, something needs to change, this xvid divx should be dead 2 years ago.

And im saying this just because when people see an Xvid release already up, then when this is ruined oh .. most people saw the episode, no need to upload high-res. LOW RES releases SHOULD have LOWER PRIORITY, those that can't download in a timely fashion can just wait a bit or what, and nobody would get screwed in the end."
