Visions of the Sea is a glimpse into another world. Behold a dazzling
variety of shapes and a rainbow of colors as you meet an amazing
assortment of creatures-from tiny, single-celled organisms to massive
mammals, from the beautiful to the icky. Travel more than a mile and
half underwater where living fossils thrive, then experience the
thrill of breaking the surface with a humpback whale. Float through
hundreds of thousands of jellyfish as if in a dream and join a herd of
hammerhead sharks on the hunt. Tour the architectural artistry of
coral like an underwater tourist, so mesmerized you will find yourself
falling for the camouflage deceptions of the cuttlefish. Featuring the
underwater photographic artistry of Al Giddings, the American
Cousteau, stunning imagery is paired with informative narration and a
soundtrack that embodies the eclectic rhythms of life in the ocean as
it moves from big band to classical to new age.
