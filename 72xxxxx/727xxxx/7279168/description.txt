                            The Complete  Season 1


Person of Interest is an American television crime drama.

The Series follows former CIA paramilitary operative, John Reese (Jim Caviezel), who is presumed dead and teams up with reclusive billionaire Finch (Michael Emerson) to prevent violent crimes in New York City by initiating their own type of justice. With the special training that Reese has had in Covert Operations and Finch's genius software inventing mind, the two are a perfect match for the job that they have to complete. With the help of surveillance equipment, they work "outside the law" and get the right criminal behind bars.
