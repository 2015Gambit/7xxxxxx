[V],manOtor,2012-05-21T02:40Z,"please note:

I accidentally put a colon where a dot should be in episode 20:
Person.of.Interest.S01E20.HDTV.x264-LOL.Matsya.Nyaya,mp4
                                                                                  ^right here.

Please simply rename the file and replace the colon with a dot.
Cheers ;)"
