,Ind0,2012-05-19T15:42Z,"For anyone who feels like messing around; according to the steam forums the random chrashing (Usually when entering a port) is due to dual cores. Only using one core for the game makes it more stable, yet still slightly prone to chrashing."
,jolle747,2012-05-19T23:35Z,Thanks a lot for this.
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-05-20T02:40Z,"I cant install the patch, msi installer box says that something is wrong with my installer or that I have to re-install the game. But I have tried that, but just keeps happening. Samething with the 1.1 patch."
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-05-20T02:47Z,"Nevermind, fixed it. Had to re-install the game again for some reason?"
,Ultra-Tron,2012-06-05T10:17Z,"I own a single core P4 D 3 ghz with XP and it kept crashing on me when entering ports... Same with my laptop, which is dual core 1.8 Vista..."
,Agoneous,2012-06-09T10:59Z,"For those for whom the game crashes on start-up, if you have multiple monitors, only enable one.

Hope that helped."
,Tycoonyer,2012-06-16T18:34Z,What about new updates? They already released 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 ....
,MIGUELbM,2012-06-20T19:48Z,"ANYONE KNOWS WHEN THE 1.1.3 UPDATE IS OUT?
it improves major stuff from the gameplay, without the update the game becomes really annoying"
,Yakuzha,2012-07-06T13:36Z,"Thanks for the upload, is there anyway that you can help uploading the v1.1.4 patch for us ? :)"
,harmze,2012-07-16T12:22Z,can any1 help me with a product key
,Yakuzha,2012-07-19T04:55Z,"@harmze: read above.

Option 2:

If you prefer an untouched exe and absolutely adore keygens, install
the update and use the keygen from the KEYGEN folder, also included
with this release."
,Smart-The_real_one,2012-07-21T08:36Z,"@Ultra-Tron

It's a known and common problem on dual-core processors.

On the compatibility tab of the PortRoyale3.exe check:
- Disable visual themes
- Disable desktop composition

Enjoy!"
