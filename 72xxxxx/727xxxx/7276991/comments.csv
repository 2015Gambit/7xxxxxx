some lame segmenting tools""?!? Uncool. Uncool uncool uncool."

It's not hard to unrar these. I agree it's a bit unnessesary but if you don't appreciate their work just leave it. I'm sure you don't need to comment on a hundred torrents to get your view across."

I never said it was hard to reconstitute the split files; it's not only unnecessary but also annoying. Also, I didn't comment on ""a hundred torrents"" you Exagg Queen, I only commented on a couple done by the same uploader.

Clearly, you're as streets behind as he is. I hope you don't have Asperger's like Abed and Shelly from TBBT. :P"
