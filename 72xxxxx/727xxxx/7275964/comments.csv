,allecher0,2012-05-18T05:08Z,"I can't seem to get the keygen to work, i tried what it said to do in the instructions but it didn't work. I always get an invalid key error, any fixes or explanations to this problem? should i keep trying or give it up?"
,8906,2012-05-18T05:31Z,"allecher0, follow the instructions and delete the licenses in your registry, then try to activate again.  Follow the instructions."
,Hancock79,2012-05-18T09:01Z,"i'm following the instructions to the letter, deleting registry entries correctly and trying again, still doesn't work."
,Hancock79,2012-05-18T09:11Z,"ok figured it out, it's not in the instructions.  once you generate the final code you need to actually close the keygen before you hit the last activate button"
,allecher0,2012-05-18T14:11Z,"I probably have screwed it up somewhere along the way, as all of the ways are not working.  I think I may not have placed the keygen.exe right.  Is it supposed to be in C:/program files(x86)/Cyanide/Game of thrones?  Thanks in advance."
