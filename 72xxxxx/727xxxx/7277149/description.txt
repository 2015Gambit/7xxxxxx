C4 have released the Upcoming album ΓÇ£IsΓÇ¥ by Hey Ocean!. Overall ΓÇ£IsΓÇ¥ is an amazing well produced album, filled with happy catchy pop songs, and haunting beautiful songs. There are so many layers and different instruments used in Hey Ocean! that other pop acts donΓÇÖt, which sets them apart from the masses. The songs are poppy enough for pop music fans, and complex enough for a music fan that wants a little bit more substance in their music. Hey Ocean! has truly evolved since ΓÇ¥ ItΓÇÖs Easier to Be Somebody ElseΓÇ¥ the predecessor to ΓÇ£IsΓÇ¥. The band has recently signed to Universal Music Canada, which is a huge thing for this up and coming talented Vancouver band.
