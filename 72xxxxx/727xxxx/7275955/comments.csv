,bajsmanx5,2012-06-07T05:35Z,"Something is wrong with the permissions of a folder inside the app package. Fix it with a forced chmod in the terminal. 
1. Put clarify.app inside a separate folder. 
2. cd your way into the folder in the terminal. then run the following command:
chmod -R 777 *

It should work now."
