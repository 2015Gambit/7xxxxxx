Clarify provides a hassle-free way of turning screenshots into beautiful documents in five minutes or less. 

Many screen capture applications let you work with one picture at a time. But combining multiple screenshots into clear documents is a pain. It's such a pain that most of us don't take the time to do it, even though we KNOW our clients, co-workers and friends would like us to use more pictures when we are trying to help them. 

Clarify gets rid of all of the hassle and frustration of creating documents out of screenshots. Say goodbye to working with multiple screen capture, image editing and word processing applications and say hello to instant productivity. 

Clarify lets you:
Capture multiple images and turn them into a document
Add text and annotations with simple, integrated tools
Share your document via email, PDF, Dropbox or Clarify-it.com
