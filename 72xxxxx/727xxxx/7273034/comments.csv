The Pirate Bay Suffers (Local) Downtime

Yes, The Pirate Bay is down at the moment. No, not everywhere.

Every time The Pirate Bay suffers a few minutes for downtime, thousands of people start to worry that something awful has happened to their beloved site. Luckily, this is usually not the case.

When the site’s not responding someone probably tripped over a cable, they’re working on software upgrades, replacing hardware or facing another technical difficulty.

The current downtime appears to be a routing issue as the site is still reachable in many parts of the world.

That’s also good news for people who can’t access it at the moment, because many of the proxies are still working just fine.

We expect that the regular site will return within a few hours, and will update this post when we hear from the TPB tech guy."

:)

BTW: I have decided to return to Demonoid.

My issues with the comment moderation there shouldn't trump you; the users, access to content."
