Attack of the Killer Bees 
A single swarm of killer bees can deploy an attack force of 80,000 stingers, chase predators for a quarter of a mile, and bring down a creature as large as a horse. Killer bees have pushed farther north than many scientists thought possible and are now colonizing in the southern United States. Can scientists, beekeepers, and exterminators stop the invading hordes?
