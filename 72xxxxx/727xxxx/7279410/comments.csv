,ryunax14,2012-05-19T17:42Z,Guys Be Good Pleasee seed! thanks :D
[V],boobsman,2012-05-19T19:17Z,"@ felgluz update via usb offline, you can play install to hdd so long as you've burned twith ihas and have a complete disc, if you've used the truncate method then you have to play from disc.

@ rethur this has no disc errors, goes through abgx no problem and plays fine :)

@ tomy800 what firmware are you running LT2.0 or LT3.0? are you using abgx360 or trying to downgrade, more info please!"
,cisse9,2012-05-19T19:33Z,"@rethur.shut up dumb ass.
ive dl max payne 3 and ghost recon from imars and have had no problems.
just ignore this MUG."
,spiderforpc,2012-05-19T20:41Z,"Q? about old games i have

,raijinn1,2012-05-19T21:22Z,omg never fails me boobsman love it man :) this and ghost recon wow keep it up 
,rethur,2012-05-19T22:00Z,I've read around and other people are having problems with this copy of the game as well and getting a disc unreadable error within 10 mins of playing the game. I injected topology just like I do with every other XGD3 and burned with 2.4x TWICE.
,rethur,2012-05-19T22:22Z,It might work if you have an iHas and don't truncate.
[T],razalgul1979,2012-05-19T23:53Z,"I just bought a tube of 50 Ritek 8x, You can send more for me

Ritek 8x works fine for XGD3 burned with Liteon."
,bgwtf,2012-05-20T00:23Z,"Disc error!

Burned with ImgBurn LayerBreak=2133520.

Ghost Recon Future Soldier XBOX360-iMARS
Max Payne 3 RF XBOX360-XPG
Both work perfect but this one give me error i never had this before with your torrents boobs!
"
,139466,2012-05-20T00:37Z,WTF why i always getting a disc unreadable error within 10 mins of playing the game ?and i have a LT 3.0 This is how i burn i check the game in abgx360 and then burn in ImgBurn on calculate and trunce. Did i do something wrong ?
,rethur,2012-05-20T02:10Z,"Like I said, it's a bad copy of the game by iMARS. I read that it may work if you have an iHas burner otherwise don't waste your time downloading cause there is a 99% chance you'll get a disc unreadable error within 10 mins of starting the game. Hopefully someone else releases a better copy soon."
,ix9nine009,2012-05-20T02:56Z,"this will only work if you don't truncate and IF YOU HAVE iHas Burner

iMARS confirmed that this game has extra protection like serious sam 3"
,marco699,2012-05-20T03:03Z,"Note: It seems that this game has some extra protection and truncated burns are not working. If you truncate/overburn this game it will stop working at around 5 minutes of gameplay and will show you an error.

You’ll have to use a Liteon IHAS burner to burn this game + use good quality dvds ( verbatim are recommended).

This is what i have seen till now

JTAG & RGH = Game works fine

LT+ 3.0 & 2.0 with IHAS drive = Game works fine

LT+ 3.0 & 2.0 without IHAS (truncating or overburning) = Game stops working after 5-10 minutes

X360key & Wasabi = No reports yet.
"
,templarmonk,2012-05-20T05:34Z,"Guys, if you are burning this game as truncate, change the layerbreak to 2086912, people are reporting this to work"
,felgluz,2012-05-20T09:57Z,Strange..... I have LT 2.0 with 13599. I update via usb to this Dash 14719 and i lost all the old games. BUTTTT Sniper Elite V2 wich i had downloaded before works. I didn't do anything for this game (topology nor other stuffs)
,ello195,2012-05-20T17:33Z,"I tried with user specified layerbreak: 2086912

with no sucess, anyone else?"
,ello195,2012-05-20T17:50Z,"This is what I have read in some forums:

No this game haven’t any new security checks. The game is not 7.7 GB. the developer have found a new way and maxed out the double layer at 7.9 GB so the same security are last always at disc. so with one original driver cant copy this game to play it. you want Ihas burner with Ixtreme Burner MAX. this custom firmware created by C4EVA of course cracked the space at 8+ GB at double layers burn data at empty discs. so no problem at burning and safe gaming and no errors and freezes

Does this mean it will only work with an IHAS burner ?"
,Ryuman13,2012-05-20T20:25Z,"@marco699, i can confirm it works fully on the x360key. Thanks for the upload, boobsman! It's a pretty good game :)"
,Jnado,2012-05-20T20:37Z,"Ok, I'm having the same problem as most people, where I get the unreadable disc error. I am using abgx360 1.0.6, Imgburn 1.5.7.0, and have an ATAPI iHAS422 8 burner. All the games I've downloaded from boobsman have always worked, except for this one. Firstly can someone give me their recommended settings for abgx360 and Imgburn, and can anyone explain how I can make a copy that works. Please and thank you. "
,Jnado,2012-05-20T20:50Z,oh yeah also have a liteon
,Assassinprofessor,2012-05-20T20:54Z,"@ello195 
Can someone tell me what is IHAS burner?Is it a similar software just like ImgBurn?"
,Jnado,2012-05-20T21:12Z,An iHAS burner is not a program. Its the thing you put your cd's in on your computer. iHAS is just a type of burner that allows you to burn games and such.
,felgluz,2012-05-20T23:03Z,Burned with Layer 2086912 and doesn't work in my LT 2.0! Any sugestions?
,raijinn1,2012-05-21T00:38Z,damit i got same problem was so psyched for this one i tried how i normally do it and tried changin the layer break and no go sadly 
,ryunax14,2012-05-21T05:03Z,Damn I download this and its only corrupted!!
,tomy800,2012-05-21T12:14Z,"Any info what happends when your banned from xbox live and plays this game, will there be pawns available?"
,Backstabing,2012-05-21T16:18Z,Burned it with my iHas Max burner and it works flawlessly thanks boobsman.
,jamesfludgate,2012-05-21T16:24Z,"Hi all

So wat do u need 2 burn this game n poss future games? A liteon iHas 124 drive?

Boobsman = Legend"
,LKatsu,2012-05-21T22:44Z,seeds please!
[V],boobsman,2012-05-22T00:16Z,"@ felgluz Sniper Elite is an XGD2 game this is XGD3, they are TOTALLY different.

To everyone else you MUST use a flashed ihas burner with this game or IT WILL NOT WORK!!! This will probably be the first of many games that require you to use an ihas burner so you better get sorted or prepare to miss out on some games, the other alternative is the x360 key :)"
,turntable83,2012-05-22T01:49Z,skip the ihas and just get x360key (xk3y)
,jay90009,2012-05-22T03:56Z,hey boobs man email me if you can i need with picking out the best ihas burner heres my email thanks and much appreciated mr boobs jay90009@aol.com
,jamesfludgate,2012-05-22T10:47Z,"Hi All

Jus a quick question

Would u recommend the Liteon iHas 624-32?"
,mrnexus,2012-05-22T14:51Z,"Here is the link for the Liteon-ihas burner
http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B0026N4U9Q/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1
all you need after this is the c4eva;s max burner firmware to flash it so you can fit xgd3 8.14gb etc."
,jay90009,2012-05-22T16:24Z,"@mrnexus thanks for the link bro, but is there a way for me to connect it to my laptop?"
,jay90009,2012-05-22T16:25Z,through usb?
,bgwtf,2012-05-22T19:48Z,"I got today LiteOn IHAS124

Do i need to burn with special program or can i still use ImgBurn? Anything else i need to know before i start burning?

Thank u"
,The_Human,2012-05-22T22:17Z,Extra security sucks dick
,jay90009,2012-05-22T22:18Z,"@ bgwtf i'm trying to get that one too, i was wanted to ask is there a way for you to connect that drive to your laptop through a usb?"
,tomy800,2012-05-23T08:15Z,Any chance of getting banned if you use it online to search for pawns?
,jamesfludgate,2012-05-23T17:43Z,Jus got an upgraded LiteOn iHas 124b to a 524b flashed wiv iXtreme 4 £40 - is that gd?
,mrnexus,2012-05-24T10:41Z,"@jamesfludgate /you paid £40,i bought a liteon-ihas 124-xx-b for £15 off of amazon thats a baseline model i only use it for burning xgd3 and anything else,£40 is quite expensive imo,if it's just for xgd3 backups etc."
,mrnexus,2012-05-24T10:54Z,"I use a sata cable and a usb and a molex power brick to power the liteon-ihas drive here r the link were you can get them and what they look like

(I use my x360usb-pro to connect my sata to-usb-molex power supply thats how i do it.)it's really very easy and cheap in the long run.
"
,mrnexus,2012-05-24T11:03Z,"to power the liteon-ihas 124-xx-b you need 1st
http://www.modtraders.co.uk/12v-dc-4_pin-molex-external_power-supply-adapter.html
and 2nd
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wired-Up-SATA-Power-Adapter-Cable/dp/B000ITL1PG/ref=pd_rhf_cr_shvl1
and 3rd a way to connect them to your pc i use my x360usb-pro because its handy and does the job,thats it,thats all you need to burn 100% of the data on xgd3 8.14gb disc's,truncating them is just to risky as you only copy 97% of the data on the iso which will get you banned on live.hope this helps you all out
ps not sure if i double-posted as TPB  is showing me my comments."
,Assassinprofessor,2012-05-25T16:42Z,will it work with topology 2.0 just like the rest XGD3 games??? can someone confirm pls :))

,remedy2,2012-06-09T00:55Z,I only have LT+2.0 and a iHAS burner.  Is there any advantage to having LT+3.0 for this game? 
,remedy2,2012-06-09T06:30Z,"abgx says it cannot patch ""Failed to reopen Dragon's Dogma for writing"" Permission denied. Autofix failed, Stealth still unverified.

,remedy2,2012-06-09T06:44Z,Disregard last post.  Somehow I had mounted the ISO to virtual clone drive so abgx couldn't write to it.
,remedy2,2012-06-09T07:57Z,Ok same problem as Jnado.  Disc not supported error on 360 after running through abgx. Also burned one and didnt run it through abgx and got same error.  Used latest abgx and iHAS drive and imgburn software to burn.
,remedy2,2012-06-09T08:51Z,Argh to make things worse my console is now flagged for AP2.5 failure. Prob due to burning it without patching with abgx.  Why not patch with abgx then upload it boobsman?
