I was going to post a Kid Koala discography, then realized that would look much like an Automator/Deltron/Kid Koala discography, so here it is.

Lots of FLAC format and other various high quality lossy bitrates.

Enjoy, and please buy some merch from these guys.... Kid Koala does his own artwork and it's really a great way to look stylo and support the musicians.

Please seed widely, this is some of the best material in the Galaxy, lets promote it :)
