""From Elvis In Memphis"" will be perfect if you have it? I used to own ""mobile Fidelity"" vinyl - No digital edition beats it's sound.
Thanks again, appreciate your efforts "

,LeGrinde,2012-08-08T08:12Z,I'm just discovering these! Listening to Harum Scarum now! I am sorry you are not getting lots of comments. Pirate Bay makes it kinda hard. Most people just download things without ever joining and getting a username and password. And you cannot leave a comment unless you are a member. So I'm sure people are loving these as much as I am!  Thank you!!!
