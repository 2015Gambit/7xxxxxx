IT HAS A VIRUS"
,ipodmonesta,2012-05-18T17:58Z,"ITS FALSE POSITIVE! my antivirus detected it as a virus too, but dont worry, IT's NOTHING. anyways, only RegSetup.exe is detected and you can just delete it. the game might also work without it i dont know."
,tjroon,2012-05-19T08:02Z,yeah if you delete that single infected file in the .rar it exits setup with an msi.rar missing error.
,ipodmonesta,2012-05-24T19:13Z,"it's false positive it has no virus, I SWEAR! i you dont believe me then dont download. it obviously didnt infect the other 9 people's computers"
