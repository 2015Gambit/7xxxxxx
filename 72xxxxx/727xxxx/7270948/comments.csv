These modern day warriors are on a mission to protect the largest Indian reservation in North America, and to preserve an ancient way of life. They must deal with big city crime like gangs, drugs, murders, and human trafficking while also protecting wildlife, cultural landmarks, and endangered archaeological sites. On a landscape straight out of the Wild West, they even square off against the supernatural, as they investigate attacks by beings with supernatural powers known as Skinwalkers.
