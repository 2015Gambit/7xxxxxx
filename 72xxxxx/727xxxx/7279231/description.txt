Spider-Man Reign [MARVEL]

A searing vision of Spider-Mans future, brought to you by superstar Kaare Andrews. They finally did it. Kicked them to the curb. The capes and tights crowd - theres no place for them in the Big Apple anymore. Peter Parker? He cant even remember what it was like to don the red and blue, and swing through the night sky. Doesn't want to, anyway. After all, there's nothing left to fight for, is there? That is, until an old friend appears on Peters doorstep, bearing a package and a message - and everything changes. If its not Peters responsibility, then whose is it?
