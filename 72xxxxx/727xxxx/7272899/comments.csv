,kinger77,2012-05-17T18:29Z,You should see if you could find the transformers ongoing series IDW had before it branched into the two series currently publishing!
,contatnt1one,2012-05-19T01:53Z,"Transformers Ongoing would be great if you could manage it. I actually have most of those already. I'm missing about 5 issues plus ""The Death of Optimus Prime"" numbered as issue 125 for some reason. We all know he wont stay dead of course. "
