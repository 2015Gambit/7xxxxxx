Ok. So here is the Application Support folder from my User Account.. this might work in order to get the game going..

I included a dashboard widget for showing and hiding hidden files on your mac (since the Library folder in your User Account is invisible)
and instructions on where to exactly copy the folder.. 

I cannot confirm that this will work.. I only have this machine and I have the game already running..

I tried this game on my Mountain Lion Beta install (I downloaded it on Lion though)
to be sure that it works.. But the Beta install is not connected to the internet nor to the AppStore with any ID.. so that might be working as well..

If it doesn't work, then I am very sorry for wasting your time, but also my time has been wasted.. 

Be patient as I might come up with a working crack, once I get on a different mac to do some testing
