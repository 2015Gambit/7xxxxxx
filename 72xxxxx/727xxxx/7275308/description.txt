Release info:

HypoGeo is Nicola Grigatti from Italy.

His debut album contains a deep industrial vibe, but is also cerebal and hypnotic, like real trance should be.

His sound clearly draws upon his EBM/Industrial roots yet fuses it with crunchy percussion, massive atmospheres, futuristic sound fx and deep basslines to make something truly unique.
