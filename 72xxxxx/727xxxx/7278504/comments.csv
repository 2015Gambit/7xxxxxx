I have watched these on a laptop and on a 50inch plasma using an external media hard drive. They work fine, fault is with you."

Burnt the lot to DVD and its playing like a bomb with English Subs which popped up automatically!!! Awesome!!! I use BS Player PRO Ver 2.62 which to my experience has is far superior to VLC, absolutely no lag at all. If you know about any more interesting Scandinavian Crime, do give us the links!!! "
