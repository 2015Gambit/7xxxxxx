,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-08-25T13:16Z,"I've yet to see the Toomin version of season 4 so can't say which is better (I think it's not even out there) but I know this is much better than the  Nick version someone else earlier uploaded.  Comparing the quality of episodes on this torrent to any of the three Toomin versions out there, I feel there's not much a difference and they're equally good. As for it not being from Comedy Central, don't you notice the big channel logo on each of the episode? I don't understand how anyone can even make that claim. I honestly don't also remember seeing the picture getting scrambled on any episode... perhaps that's just your computer having trouble playing these. Also, there are tools you can use to make out-of-sync subtitles sync better with the picture. It's just a lot of work and I can't see the point in going thru the trouble knowing all the dialogue is in English anyway."
