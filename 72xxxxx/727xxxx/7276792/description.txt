Greatest Hits is a compilation album by David Gray, released on 12 November 2007 in the UK and a day later in the US. Greatest Hits contains songs from his first album A Century Ends in 1993 through his 2005 album Life in Slow Motion, and includes two new songs: the first single "You're the World to Me" and "Destroyer." In interviews, Gray has described the new single "You're the World to Me" as "joyous" and "unselfconscious,"[7] and called his Greatest Hits album: "a bag of happy shit."[8]
All tracks are the original album versions, except for "Be Mine," which is the single remix; "Babylon," which is a new mix; and "Shine." Due to record company issues, the original recording of "Shine" could not be used; instead, a live recording from Gray's concert DVD Live in Slow Motion is featured on the compilation.
