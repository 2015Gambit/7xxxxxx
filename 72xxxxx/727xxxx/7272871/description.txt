Synopsis: I learned how good UltraISO is the hard way. When Win7 was released,
i used MagicISO among other ISO software to make my DVD assuming all ISO 
software was the same. Big mistake, and to make a long story short, none of
the DVDs worked. Only UltraISO was capable of creating a Win7 DVD correctly.
UltraISO truly is the standard when it comes to ISO/Disc Imaging.

1. Virtual Drive Support: yes.. you can mount ISOs!.. and you don't have to 
worry about removing drives before exiting, i've ensured PAF takes care of it 
for you. :)
2. Shell Integration Support: you can simply launch UltraISO, minimize it, 
and browse through your library, right-click it and open it in UltraISO...
no worries.. when you exit UltraISO.. it cleans up after itself :)
3. Shell Icons Support: all formats supported by UltraISO will show UltraISO's
icon.
4. Truly Stealth! yep.. even takes care of the infamous "LEGACY" keys :P
