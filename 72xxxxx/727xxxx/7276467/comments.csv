,ryanspeck,2012-05-18T11:05Z,"They apparently only showed this episode in Britain. (It may be like the sixth episode of last season, which ABC pulled for some reason and didn't show until after the season was over.)

Despite renewing it for next year, this just goes to show how much ABC actually cares about the series."
