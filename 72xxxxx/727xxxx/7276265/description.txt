In the late 21st century, a star map is discovered within the archaeological imagery of several otherwise unconnected cultures, which includes the Aztec, Mesopotamian and Magdalenian civilizations. The crew of the faster-than-light spaceship Prometheus are sent on a scientific expedition sponsored by the Weyland Corporation to follow the map as part of an outer space exploration mission to find the origins of mankind. Exploring the advanced civilization of an extraterrestrial race and discovering their amazing technology, they soon face a threat to humanity's very existence.
