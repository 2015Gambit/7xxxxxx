,FireflyN7,2012-05-31T08:55Z,"nobody here knows how to appreciate the music huh? The movie is NOTHING without this. Assholes want the movie huh? shut the hell up and wait!

And Thank you very much Lithcore for providing us with this wonderful OST!
The theme is very dark and sci fi noir-ish.
Quality is just fine. keep it up! :)"
[T],Tanauser,2012-05-31T16:27Z,"I just saw it

It's a good SF movie ; solving some of the questions stated in the first Alien .... and now also New questions 

 - No Alien monster as the original one
( only a at the very  end of movie some kind of humanoid Alien appears for 5 seconds)

 Definitely Worth the movie fee entrance; 
+ it's in 3D and THX"

What gives you the right to speak for everyone? A search for 'Prometheus soundtrack' yields this result. 
You have no idea what an age you live in, where we are privliged enough to have a medium such as the internet to share beautiful music.

When your mind matures enough to comprehend these things, please come back and enjoy this instead of corrupting it with your forlorn hate."
