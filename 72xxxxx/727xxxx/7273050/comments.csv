,Wu_Lord,2012-05-19T16:47Z,@zixnbg - totally useful comment. That was really appreciated by me. I guess many others also who have d/l'ed this one. Being a fraction lazy I will find one that is more in sync. Thats a hell of a lot in sync if you keep having to add those amounts. Great stuff nonetheless. Peace
,imurdaddytoo,2012-05-20T07:28Z,whats the best program to edit this audio onto the video?
,dvdriprocketmail,2012-05-20T15:26Z,"I watched this in the theaters and wanted to watch it again, but my favorite part of the movie was cut out.  No extra scene.  Booooo!  The extra scene was my favorite part of the movie.

Thanks for the upload.  Video is clear for a cam.  The heads get cut off sometimes from the angle of the camera, but it was watchable.  Sound was pretty bad, but bearable for something free.  You can hear audience laugh at one scene."

I used VirtualDub for saving audio from the film, ,WavePad for editing audio, and MKVtoolnix, for adding video to audio, or removing it, :)"
,eb121209,2012-05-24T23:50Z,"I have no idea why people are giving the audio a 3. The audio is well above a 3. Maybe around an 7, yet it is out of sync.

Video is about the same, 7 or 8.

At about 56 or 57 minutes, their speaking English then all of a sudden they start speaking some other language for a few seconds then it goes back to English.

I'm at 1 hour and 36 minutes right now so I'll update this when I've seen the whole movie."

Out of sync and has weird echo. TS.XviD.HQ.Hive-CM8 had much better audio, but lower visual quality (v:6, a:8). Pick and choose basically."
