,matttyger,2012-05-16T22:05Z,"is legit and confirmed. igorivanov666, thank you very much! Have been looking forward for this. Also M-BYTE, thank you for your effort!"
,mojo-666,2012-05-16T22:27Z,"Thanks for sharing. While this is indeed S10E08, it runs at just 15fps, which looks a bit odd. Does it come like that from iTunes?"
,igorivanov666,2012-05-16T22:33Z,"@mojo-666 M-Byte remove DRM using camtasia, and that's the default FPS in camtasia. It will do for now, this episode will air again this Sunday, hopefully someone will have the eye on ball and capture it this time, along with the new episode that will air this week."
,anuzbitt,2012-05-16T22:42Z,unwatchable :(
,igorivanov666,2012-05-17T00:23Z,"M-BYTE said that he's going to recapture it at more FPS, as soon as he uploads it, I will post it on TPB.

@anuzbitt Unwatchable it's a stretch. I've watch it just fine, but you sense the missing frames."
,mojo-666,2012-05-17T00:59Z,"Thanks for the explanation, Igor. I think it is watchable. Thanks in advance for posting the 30fps version."
,amoeba,2012-05-17T10:10Z,"Thanks for the upload, igor. The low framerate is really only noticeable when there's a lot of motion, and since no one else has uploaded this episode beggars can't be choosers."
,nike1981,2012-05-17T11:55Z,"Thanks,
Not a day to late.

Its ok to watch ! "
,thegh0sts,2012-05-17T14:53Z,will wait for a proper 30fps version
,jerseygirloooo,2012-05-17T19:07Z,Waiting for a PROPER release.  Like an .AVI or other format instead of this retarded iTunes shit.
,AA82890,2012-05-17T22:56Z,"Yeah, for some reason, this episode is really friggin scarce all over the internet. I guess I'm definitely grateful just to have a copy so I can finally watch. Thanks for the upload."
,skurys,2012-05-17T23:46Z,"search the net for MythBusters.S10E08.WEBRip.XviD-NoGRP.avi , just came out (just not on torrent sites yet)"
,skurys,2012-05-18T03:22Z,nm i think its the same as the other torrent of this on here
,nuke4u,2012-05-18T06:56Z,"@AA82890

yeah whats up with that.. why is it 5 days since it aired and its almost non-existent online?"
,thegh0sts,2012-05-18T16:53Z,15fps just will not do!
,igorivanov666,2012-05-19T16:38Z,"I case you missed it, I've posted the 29fps version from M-Byte http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7279377/Mythbusters_S10E08_x264_iTunes_29fps_M-BYTE_tv-links.eu"
,leogyn,2012-05-19T23:24Z,is there any reason for the no real 720p release of this mythbusters episode ??
