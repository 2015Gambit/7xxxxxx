Sweet Daddy Siki, best known as a wrestler, also had a country music career (well, career might be a bit of a over-statement.) But he recorded two albums, mostly covers of the greats of country music, like Charlie Pride, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard etc.

After being unable to find hide nor hair of either album on the internet, i got my hands on a couple old albums of his, cleaned them the best I could, and ripped them from vinyl. The rips are not great owing to the condition of the records, but at least this will put them out there for anyone who might want to have this as a piece of nostalgia.

I have run noise reduction and normalization on them, split them into proper tracks etc.
