,yuioooot,2012-05-18T11:11Z,"it's horrible, and full of USA patriotic crap. It's like a huge ad for the american military, showing how brave and fantastic the navy seals are bla bla bla. The military has given them shitloads of hardware to play with (nuclear submarines, carriers, weapons and so on). Got some nice action scenes, but the acting is soooo bad it's hilarious at times."

the acting is bad because they are real navy seals :P and it is based on a true story"
,darkbrawler,2012-05-18T23:34Z,American bullshit. Pretty comical to be honest

,leodelacruzx,2012-05-19T07:27Z,This movie is a great shit
,blizz4u,2012-05-19T11:18Z,why dont i have sound?
,MNNNNGGH,2012-05-19T20:33Z,"Maunopieru, the actors are not the SEALS. The SEALS were used as consultants, and are only in front of the camera in scenes where their faces are obscured to add authenticity to the weapon handling and squad manoeuvring.

The film was horrendous shit, and by the producers' own admission primarily only allowed the inclusion of the SEALS as the DoD saw it as a recruitment initiative.

A/V quality's good."

,divinebaal,2012-05-21T00:19Z,oh.. it is like.. COD in real life.. OMG.. I just have to get it.. wanking to dead 'rabs is an american dream 2012
,extracube,2012-05-21T18:03Z,"MNNNGH, the main characters are indeed real life navy seals.  Do a youtube search and you'll see the real navy seals / main actors being interviewed, explaining why they decided to be a (real) navy seal as well as do the movie."
,Aim_To_Maim,2012-05-23T13:11Z,"V/10 A/10 M/08. I ain't no yank but to those that said 'it's horrible, and full of USA patriotic crap' are full of shit. The acting is decent and I've seen a lot of films that are FULL of US patriotic crap, this ain't one. What the fuck do you know of the personalities of Special forces teams, personally I think that a lot of them might just be legit good cunts they just may come across as cheesy because of that. To those who liken this film to Call of Duty, I doubt we'll be seeing the exact same film coming out every year with only different characters so no, its not. While we're on the subject play a real fucking game, play Battlefield 3!"

,jperez2003us,2012-05-26T15:28Z,Why 720p and not 1080p? You think you will lost quality using a higher resolution?

Terrible movie. Shit acting. ""But they are REAL NAVY SEALS!!!"" Yeah but they suuuuuuuuuuck at acting so why would that even matter? Poor plot ... poor acting ... poor character development. This isn't a documentary so why would anyone care they are real Navy SEALs? It's just a gimmick and one that doesn't save this movie at all."
,DamnPigs,2012-06-01T07:53Z,This shit is fucking awesome.
,QBall70,2012-06-04T05:22Z,"As a former United States Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant with sixteen years of active duty service (1988 - 2004) AND two wars under my belt, my best advice to you fucking whiny, bitchy pussies who are complaining about this movie is:

SIT DOWN, HAVE A COKE AND A SMILE, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP.

These ARE real-life, active-duty United States Navy SEALs as well as active-duty United States Navy Special Warfare Combatant Crewmen.

Show some fucking respect, assholes."
,QBall70,2012-06-04T05:22Z,@BOZX ... thank you.  Outstanding effort.
,ZombieLionelHutz,2012-06-04T06:44Z,"@jperez2003us 

I only download 720p because
- bandwith caps in Canada suck
- even though I have a 2TB drive my friends don't
- my laptop has only a 720p display as most ones under $1000 have

If you want the full quality blu-ray experience rent the blu-ray or at least stop bitching on torrents others like."
,danny3975,2012-06-06T03:03Z,"This is directed to yuioooot, because you obviously haven't realized freedom is not free by any means, it is because of the fine upstanding people who serve in our military you can call yourself free. Its because of the patriotic crap I can proudly call myself an american."
,Stillborne,2012-06-07T19:20Z,You guys ever figure out where those trojans are coming from lately? Serious? I did some checking and this fuck is actually a Chinese bootleg importer. This shit is always Trojaned. Stupid fuck. I'm on to you you bitch.
,blairblink,2012-06-07T23:10Z,"@QBall70  Outstanding comments and thank you for your service!

To a few of the anti-US assholes here: just remember that while you're posting on the Internet (which was invented by the United States and with much of the backbone residing in the U.S.) that your right to express your dipshit opinions is guarded by men like the one in this movie."

,Damondelicious,2012-06-12T00:19Z,"Not the best acting but an overall great movie, i'd recommend this to everybody."
,stalker277,2012-06-30T05:31Z,"@QBall70 ""These ARE real-life, active-duty United States Navy SEALs as well as active-duty United States Navy Special Warfare Combatant Crewmen.""

Is it strange that I as a European though from the moment I noticed their unusual acting that they are actual soldiers using actual military equipment but your own, as you called them, pussies, for which you fought didn't? BTW, I got me a bear, sat down and smiled. Good enough?"
