Travel Documentary hosted by Jo Sinnott, published by Travel Channel UK in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Jo Sinnott hits the road travelling from Ireland to Portugal on her Triumph Bonneville motorbike. Her challenge? To explore Europe but sleeping 'wild' all the way. During her journey, she meets some incredible characters, from artists and musicians, to survival experts and wildlife enthusiasts; all of whom offer a guiding hand to help her discover some of the continent's most beautiful and unspoilt locations. From camping in the grounds of a remote school house in Ireland, to sleeping on the deck of a multi-million pound yacht in Monaco, Jo persuades the locals to let her pitch her tent or roll out her sleeping bag in some truly unusual and remote settings. Throughout her journey, Jo finds herself in the midst of weird and wonderful events such as Beating the Bounds in Wales, bull running in Spain and a Secret Supper at the Cannes Film Festival.
