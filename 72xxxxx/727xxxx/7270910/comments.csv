It's been common knowledge amongst torrent users for the last SEVEN YEARS that many packed torrents give false positives for torrent downloads.
Un-pack your download in a sandbox - THEN run a virus check (if you must).
Then and only then can you report a ""virus"". Now apologize for being so dumb, and get educated.

Thx to scenerall for the torrent."
