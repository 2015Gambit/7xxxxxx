Sci-Fi

A female creature created in space tries to live on earth
and has special (and sometimes dangerous) powers.

"This is probably the finest example of Soviet sci-fi movie-making.
Great cast, great story and one-of-the-kind atmosphere, brought
mostly by the efforts of the director."  A very underrated film.
