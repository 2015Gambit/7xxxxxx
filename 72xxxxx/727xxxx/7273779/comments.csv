Your site does work, only that you don't really have to do survey.
FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO PLAY IT
make a shortcut of ""Diablo3.exe""
go to it's propertes, and after target after the "" add these:
 -launch -auroraaddress 127.0.0.1:1345
EX:""*:Program FilesGamesDiablo.III.Collectors.EditionDiablo III.exe"" -launch -auroraaddress 127.0.0.1:1345

You are the mentally handicapped one if you think that everyone who torrents stuff via PirateBay is doing it entirely because he's too much a fuckwit to buy it. Developers are not just pulling games out of a thin air whether they feel like it. Only a fuckwit can't understand that.

For example, I'm downloading stuff only if it's not quite evident (from videos/screenshots/reviews/forums/etc) if a game is worth it. So, I go to piratebay, dl it, and try for an hour myself. After that, it either goes to /dev/null (common case), or it goes to /dev/null and I buy it officially instead (rare case)."

,bravo2011,2012-05-23T00:37Z,"@snipeyou

I've seen you commenst on most D3 torrents, and your always saying that every game can be cracked (which is true). But for D3 how do you explain for the fact the Blizzard held back key componets of the game on there servers, then encrypted that data. 

I understand that this would need an emulated connection to crack but what about the missing files. NO OTHER game in the past has done this do to bandwidth problems. So yes someone will have to emulate the server but that someone will also have to reprogram all the missing components of the game, which takes a very refined skill set and many man hours. 

So what am asking is, if there's 10% of the game thats never on owners PC, how can this be emulated. Again thats why I have an interest in this because this type of programming has never been done; eg Starcraft II, Assisains Creed, WOW, all had 100% of the game on the user's PC meaning ONLY an emulated server was needed."
,snipeyou,2012-05-23T01:40Z,"bravo: lol if the game has 10% that's never on the users computer what exactly is that 10% doing?  if it's anything to do with actually playing the game, like textures or maps, it HAS to be streamed to the user at some point, so rest assured it can be downloaded and emulated.  but considering the massive strain it would put on blizzards servers (and a massive cost $$ in bandwidth) it's very very unlikely they store anything on the server beyond the normal stuff in mmorpgs like the character info, eg. stats, inventory, and stuff like that.  i don't know where the ""10% server side"" crap came from but it's most likely bullshit"
,uvall,2012-05-23T02:25Z,"@Mram256- Agreed. This game is a total let down for any previous Diablo fans. If you guys want a true Diablo 2 successor you should try out 'Path of Exile'. It's an awesome game in beta now (I'm in the beta) and will go Open Beta sometime in June. Just google it. It's going to be free to play as well, and from what I gather the only things you'll be able to purchase with real world money are asthetic, in other words, nothing game changing.. Not going to be a pay to win at all. The gameplay is great and is basically considered the REAL Diablo 3 by everyone playing in the beta.

,fdfdf4343,2012-05-26T14:33Z,"Just a word of warning, a lot of people in diablo 3 are being hacked and it might be unofficial blizzard clients, such as this torrent.

I dont work for blizzard but i just wanted to say that if you download this torrent for what ever reasons, dont use it to login to battle.net with your official wow or diablo accounts.

Antiviruses take time to get keyloggers etc into their database, and a lot of stuff like this gets infected with very fresh keylogger, so no antivirus will be able to detect it for weeks, or months, and you never know what else they have done to it.

If you bought diablo 3 download the official client from blizzard instead so you dont have to worry about being keylogged."

i guess blizzard spent most of the last decade designing an anti-pirate game"
,bloodred125,2012-05-28T21:54Z,"first off the guys that made Diablo 1 and 2 had NOTHING to do with diablo 3, thats why it looks like friggin warcraft 3 with slgihtly better graphics and theres stupid cooldown spells. Secondly ive played the guest pass now and seriously i dont even know if i want the pirated version of it..IT IS SHT compared to Diablo 1 and 2. Its slow paced. Torchlight 2 is going to be more fun than this. THEY are the guys that truly made Diablo 1 and 2 and it shows in its gameplay and pacing."
,bloodred125,2012-05-28T21:56Z,"also ive got the guest pass to this game and its all true, it lags to sht..completely impossible to play Hardcore mode, because its skips and you cant avoid death at times because of it....."
,faaaaq,2012-05-29T05:02Z,"i already played the beta bloodred125.  just because some people have issues doesnt mean everyone does.  and if you dont like the game, gtfo and go do something constructive.  I played the beta, felt just like playing D1 or D2.  I also dont think it looked like Warcraft in any way shape or form..  go take your 13 year old ass back to school, maybe youll be able to get your grades up enough before graduation to pass to the next grade."
,just.keen,2012-05-29T14:14Z,"@all:
Here's your emulator -- www.blizzhackers.cc/viewforum.php?f=238 (mooege.org went from their 1st-level domain to blizzhackers recently).

Check back in a year, and *maybe* there will be a shoddy working semblance of the real deal.

At the moment, they haven't yet figured out the login sequence in non-beta D3, but I expect it to be done quite soon. After that, you'll be likely able to do the same stuff as in mooege for beta: run around any empty level, spawn some zombies with a server command, and kill them! Then spawn some more and kill them too, etc!

It's a pure joy, you know."

,nunyabidnezz,2012-06-01T05:13Z,"You know, it really cracks me up reading comments. Some are like ""pirates, it'll never be hacked, but buy it"". Others are like ""Sucker, you fucking paid 60 bucks for it, ahahahahah"". Well, you know, eventually anything can be hacked. Pure and simple. Those saying anyone that paid for it are a bunch of suckers, and the game isn't worth it, the game sucks, etc blah blah blah but yet, here you wait, day after day after day for a crack...... to play a shitty game according to you .... and still you wait.... catch the fuckin hint?

I'm not opposed to try before you buy. I beta tested the game, it's got a good story, it's pretty but the skill system just isn't diablo. I bought it, I play it here and there. I'm waiting for Torchlight 2. I pre-ordered it after playing the beta. I think it's better than Diablo 3 and it's actually made by the top 2 designer leads of Diablo 2. Imagine that.

I've had a little lag. No disconnections. Some have more of both or less. Unless you've played it, I'd say, stfu complaining about the game :) If you aren't going to buy it, wait for the crack that may or may not come. However, whether you think the game is worth it or not, you are still waiting to play it, huh?

For those that say there will never be a crack. Might not be. It really depends on whether those that are cracking it, think it's worth it, not those that are waiting for the crack. It can be done, it's a matter of does anyone want to.

Put that in your asspipe and smoke it, both of you stupid lamer groups of people."

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "

,TheAznDonut,2012-07-12T21:39Z,"Look is not that hard to install the game follow these steps and you will be fine
Step1: Download emulator and Diablo III 
Step2: exact or mount D3 
Step3: exact emu (after the exaction emu will automatic create a folder ""emulator V4"" and inside that folder there will be  ""mooege""  folder, so move ""mooege"" out of ""emulatorv4"" NOTE this is very important the ""mooege"" folder |||||HAVE TO BE||||| exactly to to my directory ""C:Mooege"".
step4: install D3 
step5: after you install D3 move it inside ""mooege"" and you NEED to renamed it to Diablo III This is also very important. 
step6: run Single play in C:MooegeDiablo III ip Injector 
Step7: some will ask for you to upgrade the patch and close the client some will not, if you are one  of those who need to upgrade your patch let it upgrade. then go and find Diablo 3 patch 1.0.3 exact it copy and replace the client in your original D3 folder(C:MooegeDiablo III) 
Step8: go here C:WindowsSystem32driversetc open your hosts file in notepad or wordpad and paste these line there
127.0.0.1 us.actual.battle.net
127.0.0.1 eu.actual.battle.net
127.0.0.1 enGB.nydus.battle.net
Step9: run Single player in C:MooegeDiablo III ip Injector again and if they give you error msg 3003 run BnetPatcher in C:Mooege try again and it will work.
