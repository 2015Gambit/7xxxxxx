,bogie5of8,2012-06-08T00:50Z,"criznit, I am crazy about your playlists. i have discovered several artists and greatly expanded my musical palette. Imagine Dragons has played a part in several of your playlists over the last few months, and I was wondering where you get the older music by them (I.E. Tokyo), if there is somewhere I can buy or download them. any help would be appreciated. I'm desperate to hear their discography, not just continued silence ep."
