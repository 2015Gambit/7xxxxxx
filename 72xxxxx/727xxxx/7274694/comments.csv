,zelazny21,2012-05-18T02:07Z,"I'm trying to. Had some weird disconnects. Just be patient, I'm not going anywhere even if it seems to die from time to time."
,zelazny21,2012-05-18T18:20Z,Could someone explain why uTorrent claims there are 10 sources/seeders before I have even uploaded the whole torrent size?
,zelazny21,2012-06-09T20:53Z,"I have seeded almost 1,3 TB now, so there should be at least 24 full copies out there ... Please don't hit and run ppl."

,zelazny21,2012-07-08T23:44Z,"I have noticed that episode 8x03 has become corrupted for some reason. It won't play past ~10 minutes or so.

You can download the correct 8x03 from here:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6991337/Hustle.S08E03.720p.HDTV.x264-TLA

I'm also in the process of creating a new torrent with a non-buggy copy of 8x03."
,zelazny21,2012-07-09T00:33Z,"I will be removing this torrent.

Please use this one instead, where 8x03 has been fixed:

,zelazny21,2012-07-09T00:38Z,"Just to clarify: Episode 8x03 is the only thing that's been changed in the new torrent, linked above. So if you've started downloading here you can use those files and continue downloading on the new torrent."
