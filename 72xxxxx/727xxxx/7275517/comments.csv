[T],MrUnpopular,2012-05-21T01:08Z,"Weird, just checked and it's fine on our end + nobody else complained. (we usually get complaints one way or another) Just use VLC's audio tools to delay/speed it up to match the video then?"
,disp2030,2012-05-23T19:52Z,Played well for me audio/video in sync. It was zoomed in slightly for me but did not make it unwatchable. Barely noticed after the first few minutes. Please continue to add future episodes if possible.
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-05-25T13:58Z,"We usually up if the episode isn't online from another group about 10-12 hours after release. No need to do what someone else already did.

(Mainly referring to KILLERS and YesTV)"
