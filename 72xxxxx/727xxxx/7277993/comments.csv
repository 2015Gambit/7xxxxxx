Did you use the wrong encode settings ?"
[T],despo1ler,2012-05-18T21:44Z,"can you clarify where pls, I just sat thru it for the 4th time and can't hear what you mean.Used same encoder settings as the last 7 episodes and the capping process doesn't allow for any other sound effects to be recorded and encoding doesn't allow for any other sounds to be added. you sure it wasn't just part of the soundtrack?"
,newton8573,2012-05-19T21:04Z,"No its not part of the soundtrack, i checked with the previous episode.

The chat effects are between 00:06 - 00:10.
It appears two times.

I didn't notice any during the rest of the video.

I didn't make a big deal of it since they were in the intro.

But felt i should at least notify they were there so they do not appear in the video at again outside of the intro or outro."
