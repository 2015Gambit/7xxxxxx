,Joeri1987,2012-05-18T17:11Z,Is it just me or are PublicHD torrents rather slow? Good quality but takes long to reel m in.
,sgcb,2012-05-18T17:44Z,"Joeri1987:

It's probably the 16 meg chunks, It's probably ok for people with a decent connection, but for the rest of us, it takes a good long while to download the first few chunks in order to start seeding and building up a ratio."
,honester,2012-05-18T18:06Z,A/V ?
,princedennis7,2012-05-18T18:58Z,tnx BOZX!!! fantastic job!
,ungraph,2012-05-18T19:08Z,How is this Bluray? It's the same quality as the DVDrip just sharpened a bit.
,Taikalasit,2012-05-18T19:25Z,I thought this was a medical drama about a doctor in chicago? 
,Zonkedfurball2,2012-05-18T19:29Z,When is this released in 3d? I wonder when the 3d torrent is released.
,SCSA420,2012-05-18T19:43Z,"SLOW DOWNLOAD :( 

Ive been connected 7 hours and only have 19% complete"
,guntai,2012-05-18T20:25Z,Something's wrong with the seeds - absolutely no performance at all
,xenomyz,2012-05-18T21:13Z,"Is it only me , or does my VLC crash cuz of the MKV file , ive tried all the things now installing Codecs etc etc , or is it just my corrupted file?"
,Bebin23,2012-05-18T22:58Z,what is the source? blu-ray is not yet release until june
,CakeMonster,2012-05-18T23:00Z,"@xenomyz 

Use splash lite player which is free and good, and it is free

@guntai It takes somewhere between 1-20 min for your computer to make space for the movie file, only after it has made space do you start downloading at a real speed"
,guntai,2012-05-18T23:25Z,@CakeMonster - no - sucks - around 50k-70k down...  other torrents today have zipped along at 1MB plus down - I've even added trackers - no change - I'm getting really suspicious of this torrent
,guntai,2012-05-18T23:32Z,"@CakeMonster - weird - my comment got deleted - no, the performance still stinks - plods along around 50K-70K down - other torrents today have been at typical 1MB plus down - this is a suspicious torrent"
,CakeMonster,2012-05-19T01:15Z,"@guntai Your comment did not get deleted, it takes sometime before it shows up :)

NOW about the speed i myself today got 8 megabytes! On this torrent, so be patient, and keep your pants on ;)"
,GarbageGuyUK,2012-05-19T01:19Z,"I was only looking for this the other day, thanks :)"
,guntai,2012-05-19T02:13Z,@CakeMonster - I've used torrents since that technology came out 10 years or so ago - and I can't recall when I last got this sh*tty throughput out of a torrent with this many seeds.  Something is wrong.

,CakeMonster,2012-05-19T03:33Z,"@guntai

It is about luck when a new torrent comes out it is about getting lucky and getting someone with great speeds to connect with you

Anyway the movie itself which I just saw is a big motion picture movie yes

But the story was written by a 6 year old :)

How do movies like this get funding is there really nothing better

I myself am a big movie buff so for me this movie is ok but for others it might be not so much, unless of course you are a person with the attention span of fly :)


Which you might be since you dont seem to understand how torrents work :)

Anyway sooner or later you will get a good connection, dont forget to restart your computer at least once a day, that will help"

M=Shit, BUT I want to know what happened after the end :P"
,guntai,2012-05-19T05:08Z,@CakeMonster - you're a moron - I have forgotten more about torrents than you will ever know.  Your use of English tells me you're Chinese - fool.

""But the story was written by a 6 year old :)""

I believe that Edgar was more in his thirties when he wrote it:

Hope that they will make enough money to put next one into production. "
,Kolke,2012-05-19T12:47Z,"any one know how to increase upload speed? I've 1000 kbps download speed and 100 kbps upload... anyone know how to increase upload without paying for it to some company?

PS. see at least some people want to know how to seed more ^^"
,CakeMonster,2012-05-19T13:59Z,"@infernal92 

No my player did not stop, use Splash lite player if you have problems with your player, splash lite is both free and free :)"
,infernal92,2012-05-19T15:40Z,"@CakeMonster

Wow you really aren't bright, are you?
You wanted to see what happens after the end.
When movie ends, player obviously stops."
,dandalis,2012-05-19T15:49Z,what is better - SPARKS or HDChina

You really are stupid arent you

Let me write it again so that even you the complete idiot can understand

The movie is bad

BUT I still want to know what happens after the movie ends, which means I want to know where the story goes after the end

But of course you are such a complete idiot that you can never understand such things"

,eddide,2012-05-22T19:43Z,Thanks alot!
,assfacefromhell,2012-05-24T04:33Z,I literally turned this off at 4 minutes into the movie. It is probably the gayest shit I've ever seen in my entire life and I would rather stick my entire fist up my asshole for a week than to have to watch even 1 more second of this garbage.
,Pedrojkan,2012-05-24T09:38Z,"I really liked this movie, lots of funny little details like when the hatchlings were sleeping all nozzled up to John. Funny stuff! I just feel it was a bit too compact, but that's often the case with movies based on a written story. Can be tricky to adapt to the screen. I'm definitely buying this one on BR."
,cldrain,2012-05-24T15:15Z,"This is movie is not that bad.  It is definitely watchable.  

I think some people may have unrealistic expectations for this movie.  "

TORRENT QUALITY: Great picture, awful sound. I have to keep turning it up to hear dialog, then turning it down when there's action because the sound is so garbled and low quality, it hurts my ears. 

MOVIE: Pretty bad acting, top quality special effects, costuming, set design. I haven't yet read the book this is based on, so I can't compare, but so far I am engaged by the story, in spite of the shoddy acting. "
