i cannot beleive nobody except you has uploaded an xvid for this show this week"
,Digital_Orfanz,2012-05-17T22:23Z,"@seemovies: there IS another one - I think it was uploaded about the same time as this one - but it is named oddly ...1021 or some such.

not all capture groups are doing XviD anymore, so the problem will get ""worse"" as time goes on"
