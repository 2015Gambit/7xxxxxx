DESCRIPTION:
"And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red and the rider was given power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another, and given him a great sword."
The New Testament, Revelation.
You - War, and your only task - to bring the apocalypse to the human world to sow death and be a punishment of God on Judgment Day. And then came the hour, you called ... but what is it? Arriving on the ground, sees the devastation war - hell on earth, in the truest sense of the word! Demons and men clutching each other in a death grip and the whole ball of fire and death rolled on you. And in the end kills the hand of the most powerful demon in hell ... you ...
After 100 years in prison board rescues war, but not to save him from punishment. They believe that this war is all my fault and offer to correct the situation.
So begins the story of the struggle between hell and paradise, where you will play a key role. Who is the traitor? Because of whom mankind was destroyed early?
All this is hidden, perhaps in one of the coolest stories created over the past few years. This game will completely immerse you into the world of the Apocalypse. Stock up on tissues, as from time to time have a desire to wipe the face of angelic and demonic blood flowing river on the monitor screen and you're surprised the entire building in the window when you leave the game.
