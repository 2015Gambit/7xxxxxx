Fuzz Machine is the fourth album by guitarist/singer-songwriter Marc Ford. The album was released initially at Marc Ford's live shows on his tour of Spain with The Steepwater Band in February 2010. Later, it saw an online-exclusive release via BandCamp. Fuzz Machine was recorded in the Fall of 2007 by Ford's then-current band shortly after they returned from nearly a year-long stint on the road. The album was shelved prior to its release as Ford opted to form, tour and record with The Neptune Blues Club instead.

The album garnered several positive reviews upon release. Ford briefly toured in support of the record in late January 2011, with son Elijah Ford and Ben Harper drummer Paw Paw Smith comprising the backing band.
