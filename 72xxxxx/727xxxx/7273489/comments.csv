You greedy user.
Just follow Danny and check his uploads everyday or two. You'll find tons of useful lessons and stuff. And be happy and thankful to him, you're getting everything for free!"
,balaguitar,2012-05-19T15:50Z,Of course I'm very much thankful to him. I'm not being greedy. U need not tell me anything. I just wanted a tutorial n I asked him. Nothing wrong in asking right? If he has it he'll upload it or else not. End of story. N of course u too asked him stuffs b4.  Even u r being greedy in that case. The way u r thinking. 
,RecycleBin32,2012-05-19T19:21Z,"Stuff? Not really. I asked him how he did the ripping thing.I want to learn and try it myself. Btw, Are you the same person with Iron Maiden and some other bad quality covers on youtube?"
,balaguitar,2012-05-19T20:09Z,Nope. I dunno what u r talking about. I dint post any youtube videos.
,balaguitar,2012-05-19T20:16Z,Btw I can ask WHAT I WANT. U r no one to question me coz I din't ask any of ur stuffs. I dont want anywy. So goodbye.
