The next number that the machine dispenses belongs to Adam Saunders, a proprietary trader with the Wall Street investment firm Baylor Zimm. Adam is seemingly a high roller who likes to play big and win big... all with the company's money. However, that high rolling exterior is partly a mask for a man who does his homework to figure out the odds, which usually pay off for him. Below the professional surface, there are three issues which may be factors in whatever incident will be happening.
