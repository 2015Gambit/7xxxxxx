just watching it now myself.. looks like a very slight sync shift over the whole video consant

+100ms seems to be the result
fix easily in vlc sync

was tired when I converted this today. 5 hours sleep 

i prob load mine into avidemux.org again and
time shift it by 100 and save it in a minute
since i will be keeping them for others to watch

and its free.. its a good know how to use it as
many videos can be out of sync.. the harder ones
have audio sync drifting all the time and
not a easy fix"
