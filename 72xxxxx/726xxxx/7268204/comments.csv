What do you think you are doing to my beloved torrents !!?

Why, though this is an tv-serie it's also on DVD-R/+R.

And so is :

&

and so on and on ....

But i didn't see you tampering with those shares (for as far i can see) !!!??

So , why do you come between me and my torrents all of a sudden ?

Is that thanks i get for sharing my stuff for FREEEEE i might add ?

And please don't gimme that false pretence crap about this belong there etc ...!!

We both know that explanation won't cut it ..."

Now you""re just talking semantics here or wurse .. !!

Iam sure you are aware that dozens of other people releases ""TV-Shows"" in the ""Movie & â&#x2020;&#x2019; DVD-R â&#x2020;? "" section.

but that doesn't seem to disturb you at all !!?

If you think in your rightful mind you are doing the right thing here.

Fine by me..

But, atleast do so consistently.
And move every single TV-SHOW dvd-r or not to the appropriate section !

,NLtopapa,2012-05-15T01:43Z,"Furthermore,

Before anyone needs to ask...

... unless the mod treats everyone as equals and move every single TV-show to the appropriate section.

I will put my torrent super-seeding ON HOLD for an awhile untill they do so!
