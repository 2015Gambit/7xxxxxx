Narratives:

Flash Bang Grenada's excellent new project, 10 Haters, warrants comparison to the bloated republican travesty that our rap overlords recently thrust upon us. It's similar in all the superficial ways - a funhouse mirror version of what was supposed to be the biggest rap album of the year. We've still got one relatable personality and one a bit more outside the box, rapping together over tracks provided by a production bullpen that, talent-wise, equates with that ridiculous Red Sox roster from 2004. But the in-your-face difference, is the clear amount of thought, time, and effort (work) that went into 10 Haters.
