"Crossbow"

Percy calls the President the United 
States (guest star Cameron Daddo) and 
threatens to set off a nuclear 
explosion unless his demands are met. 
Birkhoff finds two scientists who 
could help stop Percy's new nuclear 
satellite, so Nikita and Michael head 
after one and Sean and Alex look for 
the other. Unfortunately, Alex and 
Sean get caught at the very location 
that Percy blows up as an example of 
his power. Meanwhile, Nikita realizes 
the best way to stop Percy is to go 
into the belly of the beast Division 
itself.
