All of these models can be downloaded for free at http://www.pokemonpapercraft.net, but you'd have to individually download each one.

Each .zip contains lined and lineless versions of the model (pdf, and has pictures of the finished model), and a pdo file for Pepakura, which is included in case you don't have it, and any instructions.

All of these are for letter sized paper, but A4 sized is available at the site.

Download whichever ones you want!
