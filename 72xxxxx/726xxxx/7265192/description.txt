Plot

These fine stories, each written in what King calls a burst of faith, happiness and optimism, prove his point. The theme, mood, characters and language vary, but throughout, a sense of story reigns supreme. 

Nightmares & Dreamscapes contains 20 short talesΓÇöincluding several never before publishedΓÇöplus one teleplay, one poem and one nonfiction piece about kids and baseball that appeared in the New Yorker. The subjects include vampires, zombies, an evil toy, man-eating frogs, the burial of a Cadillac, a disembodied finger and a wicked stepfather. The style ranges from King's well-honed horror to a Ray Bradbury-like fantasy voice to an ambitious pastiche of Raymond Chandler and Ross MacDonald. And like a compact disc with a bonus track, the book ends with a charming little tale not listed in the table of contentsΓÇöa parable called The Beggar and the Diamond.
