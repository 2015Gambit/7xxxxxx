Borderlands is a first-person shooter that includes character-building elements found in role playing games, leading to Gearbox calling the game a "role-playing shooter". At the start of the game, players select one of four characters, each with a unique special skill and with proficiencies with certain weapons. The four characters are: Soldier, Hunter, Siren, and Beserker.[4] From then on, players take on quests assigned through non-player characters or from bounty boards, each typically rewarding the player with experience points and a reward item.[4] Players also earn experience by killing foes and completing in-game challenges (such as getting a certain number of kills using a specific type of weapon). As they gain levels from experience growth, players can then allocate skill points into a skill tree that features three distinct specializations of the base character; for example, a Hunter can become specialized in sniping, melee combat, or scavenging. Players can distribute points among any of the specializations, and can also spend a small amount of in-game money to redistribute their skill points.
