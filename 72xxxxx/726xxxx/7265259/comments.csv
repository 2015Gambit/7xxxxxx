,seatides,2012-05-12T23:19Z,does this dl have the nick logo by any chance? 
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-12T23:32Z,"The Nickelodeon logo? Of course, that's the channel it airs on. lol. There won't be any releases without the logo until the series is out on BluRay/DVD."
,CardboardDoom,2012-05-12T23:55Z,That's actually 100% wrong. You can get every episode excluding (for the moment?) this episode in 720p with no Nick logo.
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-13T00:36Z,"Are they releasing the series online somewhere? Because the only other option would be digital downloads without the logo somewhere, like on iTunes."
,PC187CA,2012-05-13T01:19Z,"@SecTPB: They release them for free on Nick.com, you just have to rip it from there."
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-13T01:42Z,"You're right, I just checked it out, although doesn't look like new episodes are up until later and there's no HD available."
,JKC2,2012-05-13T05:25Z,"Thank you so much for providing this! I can see from your chat that this one has a Nick logo in it... will just have to wait for the WEB-DL version.

Thank you! :)"
,emminerd,2012-05-14T20:45Z,thank you! I'll download this one for the moment :3

The Audio was really Low. I had to turn the sound all the way up.

Since I forgot to turn the sound back down after watching, I nearly blew my eardrums and the walls apart."

Large to be stupid, Web-DL version has no logo!
They are sold on iTunes!"

No idea what that first sentence was about, nor understood it. 

Okay, good information to know."
