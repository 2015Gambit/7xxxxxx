,mustaki,2012-05-13T20:17Z,"In game, everything is white. All the textures don't load, except for the main characters body (His guns are all white as well). Makes it hard to play... and just looks stupid. For about a second after changing graphical settings, they will show up, but load back to the white. everything looks like statues.... any ideas ?"
,mustaki,2012-05-13T22:44Z,"nevermind, fixed with a reinstall"
,blurx1x1,2012-05-14T22:58Z,"Is it just mine or is everyone else forced to listen to a crappy song (which I assume is the person who compressed this, band) Before they can get to the in-game menu. Because frankly it is really annoying."
,blurx1x1,2012-05-14T22:59Z,"wait, didn't read the bottom of the notes, but still, lame."

,HopeBringer50,2012-06-18T15:32Z,"Hey guys. I installed the game fine, deleted the bik file and all of that. The game doesn't seem to have audio though. The audio works up until the menu screen but then stops. The rest of the game seems to be working perfect. Any tips? "
