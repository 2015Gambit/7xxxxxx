,botakal,2012-05-11T23:43Z,"Yes, this is the latest build/version. You cannot install this, you may use this to backup your disk in offline mode or the term ""cold imaging"". Burn the ISO or you can make a bootable USB using YUMI or XBOOT."
,T1417B,2012-05-13T12:40Z,Thanks nikita200. Is it not possible to have clearly visible text.
,Pirat47,2012-06-23T17:29Z,Thnx Man! My standard Acronis USB didn't recognize my hard drives after changing the motherboard. This ISO image saved me tons of time. I burned it on a CD and it works just fine. Thanx again!
