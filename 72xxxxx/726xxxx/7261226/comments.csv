Then when I get your files I will seed."
,Zonerd,2012-05-11T12:06Z,"Yes I am, I just started seeding, sorry about that."
,Zonerd,2012-05-11T12:10Z,"I'm trying to seed it, and it was working at first, but now it stopped as soon as it uploaded 30.55 Mbs. How do I get it to continue seeding? This is my first torrent. "

Title ""Zone Alarm"" say something but not everything.
Title ""Zone Alarm Extreme Security 2012 and Zone Alarm Internet Security 2012 with Patches"" will say everything we need to start downloading."
