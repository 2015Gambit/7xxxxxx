,darkdevil2,2012-05-14T16:27Z,How come 1394 seeds and everyone is stuck at 0% when u try to download it ????
,ust2,2012-05-14T17:58Z," Hope this is for real, it's the only avi uploaded.. *fingers crossed*"
,ust2,2012-05-14T19:21Z," Looks legit, but i've never watched the show so I can't say for sure if it's the right episodes.

 It's about 1hr24min so i'd assume it's lastnights 2hr show.

 Thanks so much for the AVI, the usual uploaders really dropped the ball on that front this time. Keep it up :) you'll be filling a void, plenty of people still need/want avi's."
,VicVega,2012-05-14T20:37Z,"Quality is bad, encoder did something with the framerate. Wait for a proper xvid scene release or go x264 or 720p. Our girlfriends deserve better than this crap."
,aapnootmies1414,2012-05-14T22:30Z,The quality is good. Always this comments about bad quality. Buy a good TV. AVI never runs good on LCD.
[V],psspss,2012-05-15T00:52Z,"frame rate is 25.. standard for europe

only usa have 24 or 29 frames

frame rate never matters on laptops

nothing wrong with thw quality.. scene dont do

xvids... only some dude called afg and his always seem to be out of sync


this i randomly checked before uploading and
all was in sync"
