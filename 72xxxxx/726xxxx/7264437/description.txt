In the cycle of life, predators always occupy an important position. They are killers. But they kill, only to 'kill'
their hunger. In fact, the story of the animal kingdom is full of predators trying to catch prey, and the prey trying to outwit predators. It is the balance between the two that takes the drama of life forward. In the wild, there is no place for the weak, whether it's the predator or the prey, and only the fittest survives.
In the long-played-out drama of evolution, when a predator gains the advantage, the prey develops skills to counter it. The hunters keep populations healthy by weeding out the old and the sick. Of course, there are also creatures that steal the prey caught by others, like hyenas.
This issue ofTell Me Why takes you to the fearsome world of predators, in their magnificent variety. The animals presented here mostly live on land, some of them hunting in the water. We hopeto bring you the hunters of the sky and water in future issues.
