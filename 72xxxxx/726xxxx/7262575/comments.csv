,Whiteboy7698,2012-07-04T21:47Z,waste of time. d3d11.dll error. Install.exe is crap just like this torrent.
,ra8hav,2012-07-09T10:55Z,"@whiteboy
This is because your graphic card does not support directx11 or you didnt have updated drivers"
,Betasilverback,2012-08-15T15:46Z,"Finally got it to install but it crashes a couple seconds after starting the game up. :(

I'm using a Windows 7 Toshiba laptop.
2.20 GHz Processor
4 GB RAM
64 bit operating sys
"
,Betasilverback,2012-08-15T15:57Z,"I'm the 3rd commentator here who had the problem of it crashing on the logo screen.
Then I saw in the comments the fix.
Adjust your Nvidia graphics options to 3D settings - High Performance.
I don't have Nvidia but you don't need that specifically.  Just right-click your desktop, then go to graphics or something, then 3D Settings or something."
,Betasilverback,2012-08-15T17:17Z,Nevermind.  Still crashes after logo screen. :(
