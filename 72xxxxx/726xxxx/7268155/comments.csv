Its a real shame that Jorah died the way he did, even though he had to to get the dragons back, and he did it for love *cries*. Tyrion's got some balls though throwing Cersei into the dungeon, even if its a really, really bad idea, if you know what happens to him in the next book (he gets sent to the Wall). I love this series! Great job guys!"
,ishan001,2012-05-14T04:21Z,Download this. Uploader is a VIP and won't upload any fakes!
,M3TALxSLUG,2012-05-14T04:24Z,idk... alot of fakes lately for GoT episodes. illl comment again when its finished.

,PhreakyFriday,2012-05-14T04:32Z,"Thanks for the upload, but can you consider uploading high res videos in more compatible formats in the future? I understand that .mkv is good with compression and quality, but there are those of us out there that wish to watch this on our TVs, and not our computer monitors."
,shizanky,2012-05-14T04:32Z,"For the love of god, please once you're finished downloading DON'T hit stop right away! At least seed for just a little while til others can do the same!"

,zx6rider,2012-05-14T04:51Z,"@darkizzle 
1. This is 720p with 6 channels of audio at 384kbs...the Audio and video are top notch 10/10 it does not get much better then this. If you are raiting this V:4 A:3  your computer is shit or your just an asshat. 
2. The fact that you mentioned Jorah dies and does not get the dragons ruins this episode for others as you did not put --SPOILER...
Good news though, I think your computer is fine and you are just an asshat."
,Dakins,2012-05-14T04:51Z,@PhreakyFriday My WDTV is playing these on my hi-def TV quite well. Perhaps you might want to consider investing in some more compatible hardware?

,eddlang,2012-05-14T13:33Z,"@darkizzle
I hope dothrakis were real, so they would enslave you and fuck your sorry ass all day long you shit eater, or perhaps you'd actually enjoy it.

@drigruan
How's your comment any better? You just spoiled what'd happen in book 4, you idiot.
I just hope I'd forget it until then."
,kiwij,2012-05-14T13:53Z,"I suspect censored, bc not a great deal of gore, but I have nothing to compare it to.  It might just be a low gore episode."

,async420,2012-05-14T17:57Z,"@ zx6rider You're either a troll too or a complete moron. Why would you repeat what darkizzle says in your comment? If you aren't a troll, just so you know, I avoided darkizzles comments because I knew from last week he'd fuck around. I saw yours and the first thing I read was what you quoted from his comment. Nice going stupid. If you are a troll, then quit riding darkizzles dick and be original. Either way, fuck you."

he doesn't spoil anything, just saying bullshits and people believe him hahahaha - nice

@PhreakyFriday you can convert it to whetever you want if you have good source, I prefer quality over compatibility, thats why you have a computer to manupulate data to suit you

AT last mkv container with H264 codec for video compression, the only thing that is missing is OGG Vorbis audio and we have the best combination of all

Thanks DibyaTPB for the upload, from a small view I say the audio/video to be 10/10 but I can't be sure if I don't download and see it completely. Probably its the real deal :}"

,RinkerLft,2012-05-17T19:33Z,Let this be a warning - HBO is tracking all the Game of Thrones torrents! I know because I got an unpleasant email from my ISP... I guess it depends what country you're in and how they define copyright infringement. I don't wanna discourage seeding and all but you can also watch all Game of Thrones episodes through game-of-thrones.uprisestudios.co.uk in HD (and they're uncensored). 
,Zikman1,2012-05-18T19:35Z,Darksizzle actually makes me laugh. This is some good trolling and I mean it.
