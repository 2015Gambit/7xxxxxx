,Proteus11,2012-05-13T12:07Z,Thank you very much! I am a sucker for WoodÂ´s artwork.
,TheDogwelder,2012-05-13T14:45Z,No problem; I love it too. I'm also a big fan of Sam Kieth's work (which has some similarities).
,Street_Disciple,2012-05-14T14:22Z,Any way someone can post just the Popbot stuff?
,Street_Disciple,2012-05-14T14:27Z,"Scrap that. I'll take it all, thanks dude"
,TheDogwelder,2012-05-14T15:44Z,It looks like my Popbot collection on here isn't very thorough (I have all of it in physical form). I'll try to find the rest and put it in a collection soon.
