""You can pay as much as you want for this film*. If you liked the trailer a little, just pay a little for the movie. If you liked the trailer a lot and want to see us make more films, chip in a bit more.

* As long as you want to pay at least a dollar. We've got to pay our hosting company for all of the data people download and the files for the movie are pretty big! If you really can't afford a dollar you can always find some way to get it... we won't sue anyone for sharing."""
