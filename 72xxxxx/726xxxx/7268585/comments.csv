,2HardRain,2012-05-14T08:22Z,"Dibya uploads the best on the net, so yeah they're good."
,Featherawr,2012-05-14T08:27Z,"@Odelia
Yeah it's good, it's from DibyaTPB which is a VIP and has been uploading these 1080i releases since the beginning of season 2.  I've torrented all of them and they're all legit.

I'm pretty impressed that they're even releasing these in 1080i, it's pretty awesome IMO."

The show is excellent...

The quality of these 1080i that Dibya has been upping is the best you will find.  I have been DL these the past few weeks and did a side by side comparison of this and a 720p encode on my 73"" with 2 MPC windows open playing at the same time. 

 The detail gained is astounding.

Hope that helps

Looks greats and having a 1080i version is fantastic. Thank you."
,byjove,2012-05-14T09:38Z,5.53gb???????????????????????????? WHY?
,kiwij,2012-05-14T09:55Z,"Damn I wish I DL'd this version instead of the 720p version , as the smaller torrent is painfully slow.  Anyone know if this is censored or uncensored?? Thanks!"
,meltcow,2012-05-14T10:22Z,"If you don't care about intensely excellent audio/visual quality, then download the 720p version. Otherwise, get this awe-inspiring, HD version and have your tits blown clear off."
,argotera,2012-05-14T15:38Z,"@ Evangeline.

I have the exact same problem. I tried to re-install vlc with ""disc playback"" option enabled. Can't know if it worked till my download finishes though cause i don't have any other 1080i .ts file. "
,Anndrej,2012-05-14T16:14Z,"Any subs for this RLS guys? Or at least ones that fit? I've been DLing these these past few weeks and the quality is OUT OF THIS WORLD, but every week I struggle with subs...

Big thanks to the uploader!!"
,HighDefinition,2012-05-14T18:52Z,"To the people having problems playing this file with subs, try splash from mirillis. Pro version is great."
,expiry5,2012-05-14T19:07Z,"I tried this version one episode, but when I tried to play it in vlc it lagged quite a bit. I usually don't have problems with other 1080i files in mkv and such with bigger sizes. Any way I can play it smoother?

If not, I was happy with the 1080p version of 2-something gb. If you decide to upload one of those for this episode I'd be very grateful :)"
,expiry5,2012-05-14T19:13Z,"@ Anndrej

I'm not entirely sure about this particular release, but I'm usually happy with subtitles from here http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/ssearch/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-63130. Give it a try if you haven't, but slap me if it's no good :)"
,ccoltmanm,2012-05-14T22:15Z,Is the quality of this large 1080i file better than the smaller 1080p file here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7270271/Game.Of.Thrones.S02E07.1080p.HDTV.DD5.1-genkasper_[PublicHD]
,MikeyMetal,2012-05-15T10:18Z,"26/690 Seeders...c'mon, please seed! this is excruciatingly slow. Takes almost 2 days to get an episode because CUNTS are tight with sharing.

Thanks for the quality DibyaTPB, always superb!"
,imri29,2012-05-15T12:07Z,"Exeptional quality. 
Great release, thanks a lot!"
,netsurfx,2012-05-17T04:47Z,"Awesome awesome quality!!! Huge file size, but worth it."
,la_cross37,2012-05-17T22:16Z,"Superb quality!

Thank you for the UL!"
