I'm especially grateful for this one, the only problem I'm having is that for some reason all the serials that go to Key Correct always register as Primatte Keyer, so I can't get Key Correct installed. I could care less though seeing as how I love Primatte Keyer and everything else described works perfectly. Thanks!"

,YoHoYoHo3,2012-05-25T21:22Z,Would you happen to have a key for psunami as well? It appears it's in the same boat as Grinder and Key Correct.
,theblackthumb,2012-05-26T02:18Z,i have just learned that the keys that work for red giant cs5.5 work for this too. So all the keys that work on that work here too.
