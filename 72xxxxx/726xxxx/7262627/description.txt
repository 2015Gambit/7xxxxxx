This is the complete Red Giant Suite that will give you the option to install for CS6 applications, you can still install all these files for previous versions of Adobe applications. 

I have tested all of the files and they work perfectly on my 2008 Mac Pro running 10.6.8. The only file that I was not able to get to work was "Magic Bullet Grinder 1.5" but only because I couldn't find a working serial for it
