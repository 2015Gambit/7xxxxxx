IDW brought a different flavor to their horror line with the release of 96-page digest-sized volumes of "Dampyr," a long-running Italian series which debuted in America in 2005. 

Editor Kris Oprisko introducing the series for readers: "The main character, Harlan Draka, is a Dampyr - the product of a union between a human mother and a vampire father," Oprisko told CBR News. "As such, he possesses the rare ability to kill vampires. Starting out as a con man, Draka slowly awakens to his destiny and begins to battle the forces of evil, aided by Tesla, a female vampire who's switched sides, and Kurjak, a tough human solider."

In the first book we find Draka, haunted by horrible nightmares, walking the countryside trying to make money ridding small villages of what the naive citizens believe to be evil vampires. Draka puts on a front, claiming to be a dampyr while not knowing the truth, until he's summoned by soldiers who are under attack by real vampires, only to discover that his nightmares are true - he is, in fact, a dampyr.

The series is written by Mauro Boselli and Maurizio Columbo, while a variety of artists provide the disturbing imagery for "Dampyr." "These stories were and are being drawn by famous Italian artists such as Mario Rossi (known as 'Majo'), Luca Rossi, Maurizio Dotti, Nicola Genzianella and others. They all are very well known in Europe -- Italy in particular -- but will be new to the U.S. audience."
