File is compatible with XBOX360, PS3, etc...


Original file had 5.1 audio, but all channels did not contain audio. I took left and right channel and then mixed Rihanna's vocal in with it, to fix the situation. Sounds great!

Other performance from this show will be up soon, later today, so keep a look out for it!
