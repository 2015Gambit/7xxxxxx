Jonah Jones - Swingin' On Broadway [1957] [Album]
2011 - EMI Music Japan Inc. / TOCJ-50105 / Reissue / CD


"Review by Scott Yanow" wrote: Trumpeter Jonah Jones was a hot property in late 1957 due to his hit rendition of "On the Street Where You Live." This follow-up LP had an equally big hit in "Baubles, Bangles and Beads," making Jones a household name for a decade. With shuffling support from pianist George Rhodes, bassist John Brown and drummer Harold Austin, Jones was able to make a lucrative living playing and singing music that did not differ much from what he would have been performing anyway. Other highlights of the LP (which consists of 12 songs from plays) include "The Surrey With the Fringe On Top," "Just In Time" and "I Could Have Danced All Night."
