About:
"Dense rhythms with a light touch & a kaleidoscopic spectrum of synthesized brouhaha enliven the latest release by Wolf In a Spacesuit: the full-length Safari: Sea of Doors. Appropriate title. The album is a sort of journey with countless doors opening and closing on tidal wave vistas of sonic exoticism." 
-QRO Magazine (December 17, 2011) 



Dedicated to the planet earth, our temporary home. 


Sea of Doors was recorded in bedrooms, living rooms and public spaces across Chicago in 2010-2011.
