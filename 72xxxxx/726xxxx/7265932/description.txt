Biography:

KINGS OF THE CITY blend blues rock ΓÇÿnΓÇÖ roll, hip hop and grime like no other. With ages ranging from 16-24 and eclectic musical tastes, matched only by their diverse cultural and social backgrounds, the bandΓÇÖs unique sound was almost an inevitability.

The London-based collective consists of members Ali Bla Bla (rapper / producer), KoKen (rapper), Danny Wilder (lead singer / guitars / rapper), Rich Pun (guitars), Memari Man (bass), 8 Bit (synths / co-producer) and Royal (drums).

The KingΓÇÖs have been busy tearing down venues across the capital, headlining hotspots such as the Jazz Cafe and Cargo. Recent shows have taken their high-octane, crowd-pleasing antics across the country, steadily garnering them a large and loyal following along the way.

Driven by a shared love of music that pushes the envelope, KINGS OF THE CITY are regularly recording new material and releasing videos. Their latest track ΓÇÿDarknessΓÇÖ features a guest vocal from UK rap legend Klashnekoff and has picked up strong support on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.
