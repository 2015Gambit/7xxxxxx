The Us Government released a memorandum written in 2002 by the Office of Legal Counsel that came to the conclusion that waterboarding did not constitute torture and could be used to interrogate subjects. 

As the men accused of responsibility for planning the 9/11 attacks face trial by a military commission, Peter Taylor examines the history of their capture and imprisonment. 

Representatives of the ACLU and other legal counsel are also interviewed along with the US officials directly concerned with the waterboarding itself and legal issues surrounding it.
