,caincha,2012-05-13T15:51Z,I would rather download this then make my own conversion to a smaller file than waste my time downloading {C_P} version of it.

 I only re encode these web dls when we are unable to do a {C_P} release, like with avengers atm as we do not have an encoder who receives the channel it is on, and only when I do not have an HDTV source to use before these are released."
,caincha,2012-05-13T21:14Z,"Well, what I do is download this .mkv then use Handbrake and reencode it to .mp4 (H.264) and that's it, from 680mb to 220mb with no noticeable loss in quality. =)"
