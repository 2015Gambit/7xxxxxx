Do you have any front covers for S1 S2. I've looked everywhere but can't find any.

Many thanks"
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-05-13T04:39Z,Any chance you can seed S03_E01-20 2 torrents of man from UNCLE as we are all stuck at 99.7%?
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-05-13T04:46Z,Just saw your comment about not being complete. In the past it has happened to me and I simply remake thetorrent and upload it again and tell it to do a forced recheck of the same original files and it should show 100% if the files are not corrupt. Then all we have to do is load the new torrent and finish the download. I show 13-19-03 and09 not completing.

[T],alien99,2012-05-13T05:38Z,@thetorrentlord tried it didn't work couple times think it was where program i used because i always recheck all torrents before uploading was fine then.
