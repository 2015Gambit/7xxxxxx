Translated and adapted excerpt from ilicito.net's review by
Martim Santos on 2011-05-25:

"The atmosphere is contagious, it's dark, sometimes
minimal, sometimes chaotic. In it travel honest feelings
that choose words wisely, feelings that grow, that explode,
mixing themselves in a mesh of homesickness and
irreverence. Enough with the labels, Guta Naki are far away
from all that. They are near themselves and, with that,
attract us to listen to them."
