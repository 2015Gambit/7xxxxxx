This is my ogg vorbis rip of the 2-CD album At The Golden Circle Stockholm by the Ornette Coleman Trio. (Since there seem to be no seeders for the other Golden Circle torrent and it is only one of the two CD's anyway, I decided to post it.)

This is a rare glimpse into Coleman's mid-1960's European tour featuring David Izenzon on bass and Charles Moffett on drums. Coleman plays violin and trumpet as well as saxophone here.

From wikipedia:

At the Golden Circle Stockholm documents "concerts on the nights of December 3 and 4, 1965, in the Gyllene Cirkeln club in Stockholm. It marked the beginning of Coleman's contract with Blue Note.

The music has been described as 'brilliant, optimistic closely unified thematic improvisations'. 

The Penguin Guide to Jazz listed both volumes as part of its "Core Collection" and gave each a four-star rating (of a possible four stars).

The 2002 CD reissue includes previously unreleased bonus tracks in both volumes."

Note that the track "Doughnuts" here is actually a different song than the "Doughnut" on the 1962 Town Hall album (which I will also post).
