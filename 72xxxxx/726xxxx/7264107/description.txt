The next update for Port Royale 3. 
The authors claim to have fixed the freezing bag in 1.1. so I don't know how useful this will be, check it yourself!

How to install:

1. Open "PR3_DE_1_1_2" and update. (the installer might freeze for a minute, just wait for it)

2. Copy the files from the "Crack" folder to the game folder

3. Turn off the internet (it's needed in order to open the game, after that you can connect back)

4. Open the game. When asked to introduce the serial number, open "gns-por3" (from the crack folder) and copy the serial.

5. Play

It might throw out a few errors but just keep opening it and it'll eventually work lol.

Search for the changelog on google or whatever, basically they've also added and improved a lot of shit.
