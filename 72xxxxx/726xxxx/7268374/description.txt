This is my ogg vorbis rip of Matching Half, a CD of collaborative poetry between Anne Waldman and Akilah Oliver.

Anne Waldman is widely known as a beat poet. The author of more than 40 collections of poetry, she is associated with the Jack Kerouac School at the Naropa Institute and the New York School.

Akilah Oliver passed away in 2011. She has four major books of poetry and was also associated with Naropa and the New York School. 

Anne's son Ambrose Bye accompanies the two poets with ambient music.

This material is artistically important and hard to find, so please seed!
