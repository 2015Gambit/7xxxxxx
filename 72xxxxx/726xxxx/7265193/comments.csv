,vududis,2012-05-13T05:40Z,"The video is just so bad on these GL:TAS uploads. I don't think it's anything {C_P}'s doing as far as encoding, just that s/he has really shitty cable (if {C_P}'s the actual source). The 720p uploads take a while to come out and are probably overkill, but I DLed this torrent and couldn't get past the recap. I'll just wait."
,TheRealAngelMike,2012-05-13T12:33Z,"Not that overkill, if you download this .... and than the HD.....trust me you wont ever think going back to any other than HD, course you need a HD tv to see the difference to!"

,vududis,2012-05-13T16:00Z,"I just wish there was a better upload under 350MB, but the 720p ones are brilliant with the vivid, detailed animation in GL: TAS. It's not the resolution at fault on this upload, but the crappy source."

Somehow you're the only doing us a favour by uploading these episodes for those of us who don't have the luxury of being to watch HD on our computers.
There is a new person doing the {C_P} uploads. This was posted a few months back in one of the torrents.
And somehow cartoonpalace seems to be down. Maybe that's why no one else is uploading these episodes. Everyone else grabs these uploads from {C_P} and posts them on other websites."
