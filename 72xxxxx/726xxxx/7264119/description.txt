BBC Radio 4 Science Documentary (2005) - Creative Genius - antonyjscott

We make, we create, we paint, we write, we think we discover and we invent. Humans are endlessly creative. From our ability to utter

completely new sentences every time we speak to the artistic and scientific genius of Picasso, Shakespeare or Einstein. Do scientists or

psychologists know very much about what creativity actually is, or which bit of our brain is in control when we do? In a new series Ian

Peacock unravels the myth, science and psychology behind creativity.
