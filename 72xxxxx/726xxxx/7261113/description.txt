Hot Water Music has achieved a lasting relevance that most acts only dream of, releasing seven full-length albums, countless singles and touring with everyone from Flogging Molly to Coheed and Cambria. Combining elements of punk rock and post-hardcore, the band pioneered a blend of music that has inspired bands like The Gaslight Anthem and Against Me!. With high expectations set by critics and fans alike, they headed to the studio with Bill Stevenson (Rise Against, The Descendants) to record Exister. The band will be on tour all year to support the release.
