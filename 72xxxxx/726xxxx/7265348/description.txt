Virgin Mobile USA MC760 Modem

this is for windows but i got it to work in linux tooo.

just copy the files to a CD an it should auto run

or just unzip to a folder and run it from there

i had it working in linux, ubuntu 11.10 under wine



All i did was copy the files from the usb stick before i installed it
once installed the files on the stick are hidden.
