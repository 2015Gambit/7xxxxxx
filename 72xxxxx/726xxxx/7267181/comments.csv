Footy uploaded the BBC and Sky versions!!!
What a man!
Many thanks Footy.

PS: 
Footy - any chance of uploading the three Eurovision shows later this month? (Semi 1, Semi 2 & Final).   :)"
,TurnonLoud,2012-05-14T01:13Z,Thank you for bringing BBC F1
,pxpierre,2012-05-14T03:15Z,"Thank you footy as there is no other way for seeing this where I live in Central America.

Thanks also for splitting intro & race in two files so one can choose depending on his interest/bandwith. Thanks for the BBC coverage.

Finally, thanks to all the seeders!"
,digimike50,2012-05-14T03:17Z,"Thanks, footy, you are the biz! Cheers ..."
,pxpierre,2012-05-14T03:21Z,@ Chuck2012 - Please upload faster so we can all download faster! :-)
,josh6499,2012-05-15T01:30Z,"Thank you so much Footy! I've missed the BBC coverage. I like the tension between David Coulthard and Eddy Jordan. Like others have said, I could not have seen this without you. I haven't seen the races uploaded anywhere else and the BBC certainly doesn't provide a way for me to see it. You're a hero to Formula 1 fans worldwide. "
