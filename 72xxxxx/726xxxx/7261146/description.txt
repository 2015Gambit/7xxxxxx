PLOT

Young construction  worker Wayne,  rams into  the back  of his

actions in a resolution conference led by moderator Jack. This
face-to-face confrontation  between the  young man,  his boss,
his  boss's  wife  Claire, Greg's  PA  Julie,  the accountant,
Therese, his co-workers Richard and Hakim, best mate Barry and
mother Maureen  lifts the  lid not  only on  his dysfunctional
life but on their workplace secrets and private dirty laundry,
turning all of their lives upside down
