,paulliverpool8,2012-05-14T07:25Z,thank you for avi :)
,wavydjm,2012-05-14T08:59Z,episode seems to be short by 1 min cut off the end.
,sprite2,2012-05-14T13:38Z,"So...is it really cut 1 min short ? 
(or is it just one of those abrupt endings like last weeks ep when Meg was about to talk?)

I have eps 1 -20 in AVI so I'd  rather get this one in AVI too... rather than have to change media players. 
[I am now a fan of MKV format though.....I am amazed that such small files have such high quality AV playback! ]"
,OscarAlhoII,2012-05-14T18:20Z,AVI!!!
,milito78,2012-05-14T18:44Z,"Nope, I can confirm it's the full episode, just end titles cut off."
,kamikazee706,2012-05-18T01:57Z,"thanks to the uploader. But this has ""terrible"" resolution. "
