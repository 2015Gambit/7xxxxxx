     In 1905, after 10 years of missionary work in Africa, the Rev.        
    Charles Fortesque is recalled to England, where his bishop gives       
      him his new assignment - to minister to London's prostitutes.        
     Charles hopes Deborah, his fiancee, will object and give him an       
       excuse to say no to the bishop. But she is so imperturbably         
     innocent that she totally fails to understand what he is being        
     asked to do, and urges him to do his best. Wealthy Lady Ames is       
    expected to fund the work, but once she makes it clear to Charles      
      that there will be no contribution unless he shares her bed.
