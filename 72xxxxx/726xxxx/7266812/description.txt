After cutting a series of best-selling Mento and Jamaican R&B discs, Duke Reid continued his run of success during the first half of the sixties with innumerable Ska hits, performed by some of the island's biggest talents.

Not least among these was the most celebrated musical conglomeration in Jamaica's history: the Skatalites. Comprising featuring the cream of the island's session men, the core of this super-group played on almost every disc to see issue on Reid's many labels throughout the Ska years, either as featured acts or backing many of the most popular performers of the period.

This thoughtfully and loving compiled 2CD set brings together 40 massive hits from the early to mid-sixties, and by so doing not only illustrates the huge influence Duke Reid had on Jamaica's music industry at the time, but also provides the greatest ever collection of his Ska works on one package.
