Note: This DOES NOT include the book. This is ONLY the CD. The book is kind of useless; it does give you some tips on how to use Photoshop, but you could find that info and more for free on the internet.

Sidenote: Tested on Windows 7 and Mac. Works flawlessly.

About: The program is basically a character maker. There's a "Head" "Upper Body" and "Lower Body" section. You may choose from a dropdown text list or open the thumbnail viewer for each section. The program automatically attaches the clip-art. There is also a "Lucky Dip" function which is a randomizer and the results are usually silly. And once you're done there's a Copy button, so you can paste it into Paint/Photoshop/Whatever, and a Print button, so you can print it out and color it and put it on your fridge if you want. There's also a Quit button, not quite sure what it's for.

Directions (Windows):
Mount the CD with Daemon or PowerISO. Alternatively, you can burn it to a physical CD.
Run the autoplay.
Follow the on screen instructions.
Enjoy, lol ;)
