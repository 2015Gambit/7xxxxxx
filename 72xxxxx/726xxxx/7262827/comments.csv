,dingdongd,2012-05-29T08:13Z,Thanks a lot for this! Has anyone successfully tried it with hackintosh? I was able to restore it to USB Thumb Drive but haven't tried to load it yet.
,MrBenABle,2012-06-10T05:54Z,"Not sure if this will help anyone but...I wanted to make a bootable USB unibeast and unibeast only seems to be able to create a usb from either a mac app store file or lion usb from apple, and since those of us who have downloaded the mac app cant uppdate it i just replaced the esd file in the 10.7 app with this one and unibeast works like a charm!!"
,SanityFanboy,2012-06-13T20:13Z,"Thanks heaps, I needed this to create an image using a pre-existing Lion installation, and the Mac App Store doesn't let me re-download the installer. 

To use with unibeast, just duplicate an existing application (such as the Dictionary.app) and rename it ""Install Mac OS X Lion.app"" then right click it and select ""Show Package Contents"". Navigate to Content/SharedSupport and paste the downloaded .dmg file here. Rename it ""InstallESD.dmg"".

Then you can run UniBeast :)"

help me installing mac
unable to open
my osx version  is 10.6.8
how to upgrade"
,mongpa,2012-06-22T12:09Z,"I had a good installation of Lion, updated to 10.7.4, but it was missing the hidden recovery partition, accessed by holding down command-D during startup. (The guy who installed it just formatted the hard disc and restored Lion from a backup of a clean install.)

I downloaded this app from here and doube-clicked the disc image (.dmg) in the folder it was downloaded to, which was not even my downloads folder, let alone the Applications folder. This mounted the disc image. I had two good backups, a clone and time machine, so I then just tried a quick and dirty installation of Lion over my previous installation by double-clicking the installer in the disc image. The installer took over and did everything correctly. All my old stuff is there, including the 10.7.4 update, plus the missing hidden partition.

I bet this would work with installing Lion from Snowleopard from this download. I've read, though, that Apple insists the startup disc from which you run the installer is 10.6 or later. You can reportedly get round this to install from a startup disc with a previous version of mac OS with the following hack from one of the excellent Take Control ebooks:

If you find yourself in this situation, you can follow Plan B: Clean Install—erase the Leopard or Tiger disk, install Lion, and then transfer your old data back. Or, you can perform a sneaky little hack that’s slightly riskier (that is, unsupported by Apple) but much faster. This will trick the Lion installer into thinking that your Leopard or Tiger volume actually contains Snow Leopard—thus letting you install Lion directly over Leopard or Tiger. If one were disposed to do that, the steps to perform immediately before upgrading to Lion would be:
1.
Start your Mac normally from your old (Tiger or Leopard) system.
2.
Make sure you’re logged in as an administrator. (If you’re not sure, open the Accounts pane of System Preferences. If the account under which you’re currently logged in has the word “Admin” under it, you’re good to go.) Then follow these steps:
3.
Open Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities) and enter this, followed by pressing the Return key:
sudo nano /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist
4.
When prompted, enter your administrator password.
5.
Use the arrow keys to move the cursor down to the last  entry (the third-from-last line). Replace the current version (for example, 10.4.11 or 10.5.8) with 10.6.8.
6.
Press Control-X to quit the text editor, and press Y when asked if you want to save the modified buffer. Then you can quit Terminal.
Now you can boot from a volume containing Snow Leopard or Lion (see Make a Bootable Lion Installer Volume, later) or use Apple’s official Lion installer thumb drive when it’s available, and follow the normal steps for an in-place upgrade; when the Lion installer prompts for a destination, you can select the specially modified volume."
,falconr3,2012-06-27T12:39Z,Thanks! Works perfectly! :)
,kkk7771234,2012-07-04T12:26Z,Is this a crack version or is the original copy ? is it a free copy or i will need to purchase from a serial number from app store ? regards 
,sqlife,2012-07-08T09:21Z,"Thanks to MrBenAble for the heads up on the Unibeast install. Going to through this on a usb drive and kickstart my hackintosh. Thanks for the up, xereba."
,CX2118,2012-07-25T01:33Z,Does this work with Unibeast from tonymacx86.com if I drag this app into the Applications folder?
,lunar7,2012-08-24T09:45Z,"Confirmed that SanityFanboy's tip works, although the top level folder is Contents not Content.

If the Unibeast installer fails or succeeds far too quickly you know you did something wrong."
