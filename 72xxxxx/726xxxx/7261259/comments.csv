New Paranormal Reality Series

School Spirits (previously announced) – Premieres June 2012 – School Spirits will tell true ghost stories of hauntings that have happened at schools across the country.

The stories will be told in first person narratives through the testimonials of real students, teachers, parents and staff that have encountered the paranormal activity, blended with bone-chilling cinematic reenactments to further bring the haunting experiences to life.


Paranormal Highway – Summer 2012 – Paranormal Highway puts the pedal to the metal as Jack Osbourne and Dana Workman investigate the most frightening claims of paranormal activity along America’s remote back roads.

Fueled by eyewitness interviews and evidence collected by state-of-the-art equipment, Jack and Dana will travel alone, self-documenting their harrowing road trip while coming face-to-face with paranormal legends.


Ghost Mine – In the remote woods of Oregon lays one of the richest gold mines in the United States. For the last 100 years, it has remained abandoned—until now. Soon to be re-opened by a scraggly group of miners, these hardy souls will battle the elements to find their fortune.

But with a rich history of paranormal activity surrounding the mine, they may just find something else.


Paranormal Reality In Development

Stranded – In each episode of this frightening paranormal social experiment, a family or group of friends moves into an infamously haunted location, self-documenting their experience in total isolation.


Buyer Beware – What does someone do when they need to sell their house—but it’s haunted? They call in a real estate professional who specializes in matching haunted properties with eager buyers.

In each episode, viewers will see what it takes to sell a home—still occupied by the spirits—and what kind of buyers have the guts to take it off the market.


Deadfinder – When the morgue drawer closes on a Jane or John Doe, rarely is it reopened. Deadfinder follows a group of mediums as they search through the vaults of cold cases using their paranormal skills to bring the mysteries of the murdered back to life.


Ghost Town, USA – Settled in 1677, Mount Holly, New Jersey, is a town teeming with reports of paranormal activity. And for the residents of this town, that’s just the way they like it.

Ghost Town, USA follows the colorful characters and real drama that plays out among the town’s living residents, from renovating a haunted house to organizing the annual Witches Ball."
