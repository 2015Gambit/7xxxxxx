,podar124,2012-05-13T20:35Z,"boobsman: have you tested it cause i lost 2 discs for this game and i am afraid to lose another one
by the way i am using silverline and i have an LT 3.0"
[V],boobsman,2012-05-14T12:38Z,"@ podar124 yes was per tested, have you run the iso through abgx360? can you provide test results???"
,ehsan89,2012-05-14T14:31Z,"@Boobsman

Hi dude. I get verification abgx360. But when i load game, after a few minutes or seconds the game freezes. Got any clue why this happens? Burned the game about 3 times now"
[V],boobsman,2012-05-14T21:04Z,"@ ehsan89 so you've run the iso through abgx and everything is green? then its not an iso issue, maybe a burn problem but unless your burning with ihas you cannot use abgx to check. Best thing you can do is get good quality discs and burn as slow as possible, game plays fine for me and is abgx is all green it must be a problem at your end."
[V],boobsman,2012-05-14T21:06Z,Also what firmware are you 2 running? don't forget you need to patch topology if your on LT3.0 and use the downgrader if on LT2.0.
,ehsan89,2012-05-14T22:32Z,"@Boobsman

Im using LT 3.0, Imgburner with Verbatim Discs. I've burned all the games recently. but this is the only one that does not work. (unfortunatley it is the one i want the most). Also burning on 3.0x"
,podar124,2012-05-18T14:22Z,@boobsman what kind of discs are you using cause people told me it's my silverline discs
[V],boobsman,2012-05-18T23:31Z,"@ ehsan89 if the game goes through abgx fine then its probably a burn issue so there's not much i can do for you, try burning as slow as possible :(

@ podar124 yep i'd buy some better disc's, verbatims are the best for 360 iso :)"

,Morsmetus,2012-05-31T13:24Z,"When I downloaded this, file size become more than 8.5 GB and how can i write it on my DVD - R DL?"
,They_Took_Er_Jerbs,2012-07-26T00:00Z,does anyone know if this iso is good...already wasted 2 good disk on another naruto iso that just would freeze mid game -_-
,They_Took_Er_Jerbs,2012-07-26T00:05Z,@ Morsmetus you cant...you need DVD+R DL
,bakafish4,2012-09-03T20:45Z,@ehsan89 heya! i was having the same problems you were having... regarding the crashing and all... but the reason i was having those crashes was because of a usb stick i had connected to the xbox... i removed it and the crashes stopped happening... i did everything with the abgx and stuff... and burned the game WITHOUT IHAS... and the game is working pretty well for me now. hope this helps :D
