,94falcon,2012-05-13T04:49Z,What is it with these morons that keep insisting on putting DVD in the title when they're CAMS???
,Ozi-miner,2012-05-13T08:57Z,"@ 94falcon: the title says ""TVRip2DVD""
NLUPPER002 is a Dutch uploader (hence the NL Subs) who caters specifically for Dutch people wanting to burn the files to dvd rather than watch on their pc.
Quite obvious really ..."

,YardBoy,2012-05-21T02:06Z,"V8/A5, +1.  Thanks for sharing.

Not what I wanted because I didn't know that ""TVRip2DVD"" means ""these are files for burning to a DVD disk"".  Nonetheless, will re-seed at least 1X.

Note to other less informed: simply burn the entire 4.2GB ""VIDEO_TS"" folder to a blank DVD."
,jc128,2012-05-21T16:02Z,"Why is this under ""DVDR""? DVDR means ripped from a DVD, doesn't it?"
,prabho,2012-05-21T19:41Z,"thanks tho, but i'll wait for the dvd rip to come out
heard that it's a good movie tho"
,RichiiJm14,2012-05-22T21:38Z,ill rather watch it in the movies it is not a waste of time and worth the money!!! when the DVD comes out u would love it better !
,Spartan210,2012-05-23T02:38Z,I'm new and want to upload full 1080p torrents but cant figure out how.. SO SORRY!! for spamming but can anyone help so i can do this without having legal problems!.. input would be appreciated! 
,Spartan210,2012-05-23T02:42Z,DVDR i think means DVD Recordable not rip.. Means it can be put on disk easily.
,peter6961,2012-05-23T03:47Z,what size is this video? how many pix?
,bogwart,2012-05-23T19:45Z,"Why can this achterlijk kut never say the subtitles are burned in, therefore making it useless for proper human beings?"
,klip1,2012-05-26T10:04Z,FYI this isnt the movie
,phils1114,2012-05-27T00:17Z,Why is there a background noise in almost all your torrents NLUPPER002? If you listen closely you will here this annoying sound in all NLUPPER002 DVDR torrents. 
,PokerPimp,2012-05-29T12:02Z,"Ok to clarify for some of you who obviously just came to this site on ACCIDENT... NL SUBS means that there are hard coded subs from the NETHERLANDS.. RIP2DVD means that the files are ready to go onto a DVDR and do not need to be converted to .vob format first (which is the file type needed to burn to a DVD.) There are different blank media types such as DVD plus or minus R.. these are 4.7gb in space... the in this take up a little over 4gb to fill the blank DVD, so it has been converted using the best quality available to still fit on a DVD5 *the kind we buy and burn to* a DVD9 is the kind original store bought DVDs are burned to in factories.. more space better quality...unless you buy a DVD9 you can not burn straight from store bought DVD to a blank DVD5, it has to be ripped to a file (.avi which is what we like to download from here) and then converted back to .vob and then burned to the smaller DVD5... you people should honestly do some research before bitching at an uploader because you cant understand what they are saying. And I dont have a dog in this fight.. Im not the uploader and not even downloading these files..just commenting on how ridiculous non-informed people are..."
,PokerPimp,2012-05-29T14:44Z,"*the files in this,,, I meant to say."
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-06-14T23:38Z,Someone needs to throw Rihanna in a burlap sack and dump her in the f**king river.
,cubstudios,2012-06-21T15:42Z,Just another cinema cam made to look like a DVD with annoying Danish subtitles. Wait for a proper DVD to come out. Same crap that this uploader always uploads.
,pierobon,2012-07-24T19:26Z,"Ah, I don't know, shaded corners on all screenshot files, does seem like a good camera recording a good TV on some controlled lightning living room.

Think i'm gonna wait 28 August for a real BDrip."
