I had scanned & uploaded 2 books in this "Teach Yourself" series earlier - on Algebra & Statistics. Here is a third book which is pretty old & belongs to my father. I have scanned it with OCR, bookmarks & covers.
The author rightly considers that the approach to mechanics should be largely experimental, and therefore in the early chapters he describes experiments with simple apparatus which can be easily constructed or obtained by the student. This is a splendid book, and anyone working his way through it conscientiously should acquire a sound knowledge of those mechanical principles which are applied in many branches of industry and in the technical branches of the forces.The book is well illustrated with singularly clear line diagrams and full use is made of varied types which make the text very readable.
