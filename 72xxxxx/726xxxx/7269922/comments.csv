,opdday2,2012-05-14T18:46Z,It seems real... The problem is that I don't think there is a crack out yet and the way blizzard has set up daiblo 3 it might be a few days.
,Evilmo,2012-05-14T18:49Z,"well, i have a mate who got the game via mail this morning, so its plausible that its genuine, but we'll see =)"
,opdday2,2012-05-14T18:50Z,"It seems real... The problem is that I don't think there is a crack out yet and the way blizzard has set up daiblo 3 it might be a few days. So the only point in downloading this, is if you want to get ahead of the game."
,ShadoRyu,2012-05-14T18:50Z,"no legit, it's the pre install files"
,kuske93,2012-05-14T18:54Z,Is this real?
,KrazyK9,2012-05-14T18:54Z,it's the beta
,kuske93,2012-05-14T18:55Z,Anyone downloading this?
,discobikiez,2012-05-14T18:56Z,"Its Not Fake!!!

,Danik1990,2012-05-14T19:20Z,"wait so can someone clarify this? is this real? and also dont you need product key or somthing?

i have a battle.net account but how do you play this then?"
,RegginRellik,2012-05-14T19:22Z,most likely real but not cracked
,Danik1990,2012-05-14T19:26Z,anyone download it so far?
,Mr.BlizzardBeta,2012-05-14T19:42Z,Can some 1 post some trackers from this for me. 
,Mr.BlizzardBeta,2012-05-14T19:44Z,"Im sure its real. the installer has been released and is real, but cannot play on BNET servers til you purchase it, but get tunggle I hear and you may be surprised."
,dudurr,2012-05-14T19:45Z,"You cannot expect a crack, Diablo 3 is an online only game. This is merely the installer, which helps people who need to avoid the slow Blizzard patcher.

A crack won't be released until much later, if at all. Either way you will have to play on some cracked server and it will be messy."
,Orhteeex,2012-05-14T19:52Z,Can anyone confirm this?
,GObonzo,2012-05-14T20:08Z,fuck these idiots! even if it is real installer you will still need servers to log into to allow play and if you don't have a working serial then...DUH!
,MTeo567,2012-05-14T20:38Z,"no one download this.!
its full of malware.!"
,cotfss,2012-05-14T20:42Z,"@GObonzo
Heard about Tunngle?
Anyway, in the beta the online play wasnt so better then the offline :D"
,ljuljaj1991,2012-05-14T20:53Z,"jebem mu mater,valjda ce neko krekovati,nemamo mi leba ovde da jedemo,ne da kupujemo igrice!!!!"

,Bean-Bandit,2012-05-14T21:57Z,"Your just wasting your internet and harddrive space cause you won't be able to get it to work. At least not now.

Besides what idiot would trust a user that is Anonymous and not somebody that's either a VIP or Trusted."
,GObonzo,2012-05-14T22:52Z,"@ cotfss and everyone,
the 3 different beta testers where i played diablo III had no offline mode. this bitch is retarded. and why aren't there any tunngle links if the fake servers already magically up?"
,Beowulf6666,2012-05-15T15:33Z,crack is getting done...chill out and wait
,Killerko,2012-05-15T17:59Z,"ok guys this one is real.. but not cracked... but you can still install, reg an account and PLAY THE WHOLE FIRST ARC I, while waiting for crack or undecided if you buy it or not..

for me.. if it would not be £45 but lets say £35 or so i would have bought it... but £45 is just too much!"
,TobyGriz,2012-05-15T19:08Z,"The crack will likely be a while. An emulated server has to be created. Blizzard/Activation is punishing buyers, not preventing piracy."

,redavpl,2012-05-27T11:26Z,It works. We just need to wait for the crack
,tflagger997,2012-05-28T00:53Z,"No, there are no Cracks or Emulators that work with D3.

Everyone on YouTube is lying about having one, and most of the major crackers are not even looking into getting it working. What is really pathetic, is they will not even let their faithful fans know that they are not working on it.

So posting these things, and saying 'wait for a crack' is a scam. There may be an emulator eventually (6-12 months) but no time soon (unless YOU hack the Blizzard servers and get the other 2GB of assets they withheld). This is nothing more than a 8GB waste of time right now. "
,Xenocyder,2012-06-09T00:14Z,"It works great, download this and wait for the crack friends."
,axinte,2012-07-01T15:24Z,"I got tired of fake cracks and I looked for an alternative.

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "
,kingab,2012-08-21T14:57Z,"I'm from Montenegro and there I can't buy Diablo 3.  
Can anyone tell me is it possible to download this game (by torrent) and play it?"
