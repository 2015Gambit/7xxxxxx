Hi all!

For most of tv lovers, The Wire is the best TV show ever. After watching it, it became my best TV show too.
The first time I saw it, it was a crappy dvd/tv rip (it was the best quality you could find out there at the time). The Wire is already a bit hard to watch (4/3, not a lot of post-prod/special effects...), and it appears that the quality of popular torrents of The Wire is still the same :(

So here's the best quality you can find of the TV show The Wire. The only way to get a better quality is to go and buy the DVD/CDs...

In this pack you'll find the TV shows (5 seasons), the sequel (3 mini-episodes) and the extras. All the shows contains english subtitles and audio commentary. Everything is encoded with x264 codec.

There is also a 720p version of the first episode. There will be no other episode in 720p. You can read more about it here  http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/inside-hbos-the-wire

The pack contains also the OST. There is a 320kbps MP3 and a FLAC version. Not the crappy one you can find out there.

Here the screenshots for the show:

Please help us seed (even just an episode or the OST) and make it popular for anyone who search The Wire find the good quality rips. 


NB: Torrent is server seeded for a few months (1GB/s)
