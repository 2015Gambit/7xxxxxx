,craddle,2012-05-12T23:03Z,Terrible quality as always.
,edgaaargh,2012-05-13T00:08Z,"Good episode, but bad encoding"
[T],despo1ler,2012-05-13T00:09Z,"Really? The quality has been steadily improving over the last month and now is not much different from what I could encode by copying the 720p Web DL I will be releasing tomorrow so did you actually download it and watch it b4 making your criticism or are you just crying because it's an SD release recorded from SD TV? Which you are getting for free long before any other copy shows up btw. If you want the quality of our releases to improve then pls put your money where your mouth is and donate to our release group so we can afford to buy new HD capture equipment and pay for HD cable channels and we will be more than happy to release 720p copies ASAP after the show airs, otherwise just appreciate what we are able to offer as there is little alternative."
[T],despo1ler,2012-05-13T00:33Z,"Anyone who wants an h264  re encode is more than welcome to wait until a few hours after I release Reaperza's 720p copy tomorrow, there will be an mSD copy released sometime tomorrow evening, but if that is what you want then please do not bother downloading this just so you can then cry about it not being perfect.
 Talk about kiddies jumping on a bandwagon, it's almost getting to be funny the way people keep trying to complain that something that is clearly released as a TV quality isn't perfect.
 The thing I pay attention to is the number of Seeds and Peers, they are our approval rating and I dont see any h264 or 720p copy of any episodes of this show or most of the others we release having anywhere close to as many people seeding it as our releases have.
 To those people seeding our releases I would like to say thank you for your support."
,iamsiaho,2012-05-13T00:33Z,"does the HD version of the show not play until sunday? that's the only reason i can think of that it takes up to 30 hours after the show airs for a DECENT QUALITY version to be uploaded.
hell, even SD is fine as long as you don't crop the screen like C_P does"
,lentilis0509,2012-05-13T03:39Z,"Appreciate the ""effort"" put into the release time but like everyone who comments about your releases i have one question.

WHY DO YOU CROP THE VIDEO?"
,nottagrammernasi,2012-05-13T05:19Z,@despo1ler. Don't listen to haters like craddle. He's just a self in-titled butthead. All ya-all keep up the good work and thanks for hooking the rest of us up who appreciate the work you guys put into getting use these shows.
,kidvapor,2012-05-13T05:29Z,seriously? never seen so many goddamn grown men complain about the quality of a cartoon. thanks for the upload 
,BlackandBad,2012-05-13T06:13Z,"C_P has been here for years.... i'd expect more from them

A+ for delay
C- for quality
B+ for effort

All in all i'll download it and watch it but will probably have to redownload season 2 when MP4 comes out

Thanks C_P

p.s. why do u crop some files ?"
,J-RedtheRed,2012-05-13T06:32Z,What the hell people theres never anything wrong with the quality. But why is there 1181/367 seeders/leechers and its almost not downloading at all
,craddle,2012-05-13T07:08Z,"Cropped, bad video and audio encoding. Regardless of what the uploader says, this and all other previous releases are very bad quality. The quality has improved, but it's not even up to par with 480p. "
,craddle,2012-05-13T07:15Z,@nottagrammernasi Try downloading and viewing the video before commenting next time. Bye noob.
,megate,2012-05-13T07:15Z,"FOR ALL YOU PEOPLE WINING ABOUT THE CROPPING LOOK AT THIS PIC IT IS THUMBNAILS OF THE CAP FILE BEFORE I DO ANYTHING TO IT AS YOU WILL SEE THERE IS BLACK BARS AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE FRAME SO I CROP THEM OFF CAUSE THEY NOT NECESSARY BUT IF IT WILL STOP THE WINING I WILL LEAVE THEM ON FROM NOW ON

,Neon_Jackal,2012-05-13T08:45Z,"I think the problem with cropping is that once you remove the black bars the rest of the image is stretched to compensate and the quality is lost a bit there.
The only reason I think that is I remember about halfway through season 1 of Young Justice, I was downloading the C_P releases and started getting some cropped episodes that I couldn't bear to watch. Since then I've just decided to wait for the webrips instead of jumping on these ones every week and complaining."
,kywong5005,2012-05-13T09:17Z,Thank you
[T],despo1ler,2012-05-13T12:00Z,"The 720 release takes so long because it is a WEB DOWNLOAD not recorded from TV and the person who encodes it has to wait for iTunes to release it before he can buy it from them and encode his release and iTunes do not release anything until at least a day after it airs That, and the fact that if the scene bother releaseing the show at all it is at the bottom of their list of priorities, is why there is never an HD release until I am sent Reaperza's encodes.

The image that is left after cropping off the black bars is exactly what we release, it is not stretched at all, any difference in the image from the 720 release is down to the TV Company, ALL WE DO IS REMOVE EMPTY SCREEN, I included this with our uploads on other sites to proove the point but TPB doesnt allow much text on the upload anymore:-
And once again, for anyone who wants to complain about the black bars being cropped from above and below the actual Picture we release these are from the file directly from the  captured hardware so you can see for yourself that none of the actual picture is cropped off, if the picture is different from the 720p HD version it is done by the TV company not us so pls send any complaints to Cartoon Network.

,naga111,2012-05-13T13:19Z,Ty!
,megate,2012-05-13T13:47Z,@Neon_Jackal actually its not cause after i remove the bars it is at like 412 for hight and i leave it like that 
,Neon_Jackal,2012-05-13T15:55Z,"@megate; Sorry, it was just an observation, if you have to crop it out it's not really empty space then, is it?"
[T],despo1ler,2012-05-13T16:23Z,"Now this is interesting, I just found a re upload of our legend of korra release that is mis labelled as HDTV h264 despite still being our SDTV Xvid file and yet this is one of the comments made about it:-
-------------------------------------------
GyrnNEY at 2012-05-13 03:15 CET: 

Good quality, though mislabeled. It's XVID, not x264.

720x412 XVID @ 998 kbps
 mp3 audio @ 128 kbps constant.

For HDTV, I give vid/aud = 8/10

Thank you uploader. 
------------------------------------

I think that says plenty about how the quality of this encoders work has improved hugely over the last month and the people who are still trying to cry about it being poor quality are just doing it for self agrandisement and probably complaining without even downloading it and checking it 1st.

 The seed/Peer stats tell me all I need to know about the quality of our releases."
,alac1984,2012-05-13T16:34Z,"Guys, this bro is doing a good job. No point in complaining, you are all downloading it. Keep your mouth shut, if you don't like his work, so don't download it. {C_P}, thanks for this =)"
,stephenball70,2012-05-14T10:02Z,"Oh shit. Despo1ler's part of this release group? I shouldn't have voted these down; I feel like kind of a douche now. 

Sorry, Despo1ler. Keep up the good work. "
,ROU-KillingTime,2012-05-25T22:04Z,"I can't believe all the whining either. What do the whiners want, their money back?? :P

I'd like to thank {C_P}, Despo1ler and everyone involved in creating and uploading these files. Without them I couldn't afford to provide nearly as much entertainment for my son.

Some of us do appreciate your work!"
