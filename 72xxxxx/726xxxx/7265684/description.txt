Favourite Bulgarian Folk Songs

Duo gives new insight into Bulgarian folklore-and sound-and choice of instruments
and arrangements. Heat and specificity. Sounds and harmonies of innovation, much different from past traditions in the Bulgarian style of recording and making 
music ... New voices and new artistry. New magic! Great album, meeting the requirements of time and a challenge to listeners, connoisseurs!
