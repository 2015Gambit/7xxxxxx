,TonyTheTiger1969,2012-05-14T07:52Z,"So then you make it a triple comment by apologizing?

If you want an AVI get yourself a free converter. Not hard to convert really. "
,lalapoo,2012-05-14T07:58Z,"This is a zip file, which I can't play, even with stuffit (i use a mac) correct me if i'm wrong. Don't understand why it's a zip file?"
,pgcorps,2012-05-14T09:22Z,@lalapoo Zip file means it's compressed. You need to extract the files before you can play them.
,omnipote,2012-05-14T13:26Z,"Very nice quality 9/9. It's not a zip, just the mp4 like it says if you look at the files. Thanks ettv."
,pxpierre,2012-05-15T03:53Z,"File extension crybabies: get the free VLC Media Player.

Thank you ettv & seeders. Any extension you choose is fine."
