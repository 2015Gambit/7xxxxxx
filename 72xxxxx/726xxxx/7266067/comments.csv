Its lame. 3.5/10"
,johnhomly,2012-05-13T16:39Z,@NZPirates The 3.5 isn't accurate. Click through and you'll see that's just imdb's fucked up 'weighted average' system. It's actually a 7.0.
,wizzard4all,2012-05-13T17:17Z,"Who gives a rat's ass what the IMDb Rating is???? That entire site is run/managed by asshole and morons. MOST of the ""reviewers"" there are 19 and 20 year old kids who give movies shitty reviews because they THINK it makes them look intelligent. 99% of the movies that IMDb reviewers said were crap, were actually well worth watching."
,babybluetits24,2012-05-13T19:12Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1734122/ imdb score 3.0/10 made on $150k budget most films with score of 5.5 or less on imdb suck

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 78 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info/screenshots or covers,  please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum & fakes (after theyve been online at least 60mins)  thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
,johnhomly,2012-05-13T19:42Z,"Yeah, but this one isn't a 3.0. Imdb has this thing called 'weighted average', and if you click through you'll see the actual average from votes is like 7.0.

As for this file - sync seems a few frames off."
