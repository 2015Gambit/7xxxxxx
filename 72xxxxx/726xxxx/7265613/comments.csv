I tried some airportlist.bin from 1209 down to 1204 and it did not work :( I also deleted the old .bin and also just overwrite the old one. Both didn't work."
,V1RotateV2,2012-05-19T02:37Z,Cannot see VFR Europe charts in JV1210 IpaD version. Help plz!!
,V1RotateV2,2012-05-19T04:06Z,"Finally I could make IPAD version work 100% with Europe VFR charts, by creating my own airportslist.bin using ""JeppView airportlist.bin creator"" (google to get it & have a look at readme.txt). 

A couple of clues: 
- In Windows Vista you'll find TermCharts in a hidden folder called C:ProgramDataJeppesenCommonTerminalCharts. 
- Replace the old airportlist.bin with the new one, and add into the TermCharts ipad folder all files related to VFR: vfrapts.dbf, vfrcharts.bin, vfrchrts.dbf, vfrntms.dbf and vfrntms. 

Good look!!"

thanks, works like a charm :) Good work!"
,precursor1188,2012-05-22T05:40Z,"The reason that the VFR charts are missing is because the Ipad data package posted here does not have the vfr*.* files. Also the airportlist.bin generated from the Ipad data does not have those airports.

The termcharts data should be copied from the PC data and airportlist.bin generate from the PC data for VFR charts which has the vfr*.* files."
