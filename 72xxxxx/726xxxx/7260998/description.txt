Ode to the dawn of man (Werner Herzog, 2011)

Werner Herzog's companion piece to CAVE OF FORGOTTEN DREAMS features composer Ernst Reijseger in the studio recording the film's score. Herzog did this same type of short for GRIZZLY MAN but I honestly don't think it's half as entertaining as the actual film. I think these shorts can be entertaining but this here clocks in at 39-minutes and I honestly think it went on for way too long and there's really no structure behind any of it. We basically have Herzog going around with a hand held camera capturing the recording sessions. That's it. There's no doubt that the score is a pretty remarkable one as anyone who has seen the film will admit. There's also no doubt that it's interesting getting some behind-the-scenes stuff but unfortunately I thought it just went on and on and on until the point where you just didn't want to listen anymore. Still, fans of Herzog and his bizarre style will probably still want to check it out.
