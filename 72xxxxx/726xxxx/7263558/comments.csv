,orcpeon,2012-08-06T02:59Z,"Exception: A TCP error (10050: A socket operation encountered a dead network) occurred while listening on IP Endpoint=0.0.0.0:5031.

I altered my hosts file by copy and pasting the new hosts. Started HB_Auth and it worked twice with a login failed message on Honorbuddy.exe. I restarted my computer to see if that might fix the login issue. Then I started getting the error above when I run HB_Auth.exe. Then I used the hosts file included in the torrent. I still get the same error message. Is this a message that we'll get if the servers are down?"
