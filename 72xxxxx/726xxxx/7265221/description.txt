[1994] - Miserere mei, Messe, Motets - A Sei Voci EAC - FLAC + CUE + Covers

According to a famous story, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, aged only fourteen, heard the piece performed once, on April 11, 1770, and after going back to his lodging for the night was able to write out the entire score from memory. He went back a day or two later with his draft to correct some errors. 

The thing is that most versions out there are the basic ones (without the ornamentation thaat makes the piece even more beautiful than it already is).

It took me a long while to track this CD down so I hope you enjoy it.
