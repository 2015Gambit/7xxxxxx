,naughty_damon,2012-05-18T09:35Z,"Ipmark, I don't get this how to install??? And for the Map, should i change the file name to gmapsupp? Sorry coz errtime i run CNNANT2013, im getting error ""CANT FIND BIN.1""

pls help"
,Ipmark,2012-05-18T14:44Z,"In Winrar run the integrity check for the compressed file, if it reports no errors decompress the package in a temp dir and THEN run the CNNANT2013_10Update.msi file.
When the setup wil be completed, run the tool (MapInstall or Mapsource) to send the desired map to the device."
,chucky21,2012-05-18T16:25Z,"hey ipmark, I downloaded this file, but have no idea what to do now. Do i need additional sd cards and everything? do i drag and drop the files onto the gps? please help!!!!!

much appreciated!!!"
,naughty_damon,2012-05-20T05:51Z,"I followed everything you said and I run CNNANT and i'm still getting the same error.

This is the message im getting:

""the file 'file29.1C9C0221_0F2C_4F14_87C0_CAB92645F6C2' cannot be installed because the file cannot be found in cabinet file 'Disk1.cab'. This could indicate a network error, an error reading from the CD-ROM, or a problem with this package. 

I dunno what to do with this one."
,Mustafa_NYC,2012-05-20T06:17Z,"This torrent is better than your other one because I got lane assist on my nuvi 1300T.

Thank you for the maps!"
,Mustafa_NYC,2012-05-20T06:18Z,I got lane assist after the installation. 
,Ipmark,2012-05-20T08:11Z,"@ naughty_damon
Your download is damaged, re-download the
Garmin City Navigator North America NT 2013.10 Unlocked Mapsource.rar
file"
,naughty_damon,2012-05-21T23:01Z,This is the 2nd time I download this map and same error I got from the 1st one. 
,Ipmark,2012-05-22T18:49Z,"Have you used Winrar to decompress the package?
Have you checked the integrity of the rar file?

I can't figure what could be the problem.

This torrent has been downloaded by hundreds of users and it seems you're the only one with this problem ..."
,SerSpec-V,2012-05-24T04:11Z,"This works great, you people must be doing something wrong if you have problems. I have updated a few Nuvi's. "
,naughty_damon,2012-05-25T05:54Z,"Ipmark, one more thing.... Where should I extract this files? is it inside my garmin/SDcard? Then run the CNNANT2013_10update from there? 

I will try to download it again and extract it using 7z. Hope this one wokrs this time. Thanks"
,Ipmark,2012-05-25T18:29Z,"@ naughty_damon

This release MUST be installed on the PC !!
Run the CNNANT2013_10update from a PC's folder and then, using the tools provided, cut out your map to send to the device"
,Ipmark,2012-05-25T18:37Z,"And use WINRAR !!

,smegivax,2012-06-21T22:36Z,Where can i get the Garmin updated POIs?  The ones from random sites are not as good as the original ones from garmin.
,bbrum,2012-08-18T00:08Z,How to install 3D Buildings to my Device?
,bbrum,2012-08-18T00:09Z,"One more question.
I use Map Install to install maps to my device, but it is not really replace the old one. So i have a very limited space and not able to install all new maps. How i can handle this?"
,bbrum,2012-08-18T02:07Z,I have only 2GB in my Device. Then i try to Install all NA Maps (Canada + USA) it requires 5GB.  Is any way i can reduce this size?
,Ipmark,2012-08-20T09:16Z,"North America NT 2013.20 is out !

@bbrum
To make room, delete preinstalled maps.
USA + Canada are less of 1.7 GB"
