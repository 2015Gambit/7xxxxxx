Battlestar Galactica: The Plan is a television film set in the reimagined version of the 
fictional Battlestar Galactica universe. It consists of newly filmed material as well as 
a compilation of footage from the TV series and miniseries.

The miniseries and first two seasons of Battlestar Galactica are retold with more emphasis 
on the Cylon perspective and their plan to wipe out the human race. The story follows two 
versions of Cylon known as Cavil, with one admitting they may have made a mistake, with 
the story being told in flashback. The "Final Five" Cylons are featured prominently.
