Wildlife film. Multi-millionaire landowner Paul Lister wants to turn his 23,000
acre estate north of Inverness into Europe's first wilderness reserve. Reinstating
the old Caledonian pine forests is the first of his plans. He then wants to 
release long lost animals, starting with moose and wild boar, and eventually 
predators such as brown bears, lynx and wolves. Some of the local people are far
from convinced by Paul's vision. Will he even be allowed to let loose moose in the
glen?
