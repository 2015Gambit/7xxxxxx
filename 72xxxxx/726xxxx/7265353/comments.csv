,TheDogwelder,2012-05-13T14:58Z,"I posted 1-16 of ""All Hail Megatron"" here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7266741/The_Transformers_-_All_Hail_Megatron_01-16

I'll have to look for the others."

Thank you very much."
,SnakePlyssken,2012-06-30T21:13Z,"Thanks for your efforts. You wouldn't happen to have the Wynonna Earp books, would you? I have Yeti Wars physical books, but that and the other IDW Earp series would be awesome in digital. I have the Image series from the 90s in digital just not the IDW. Thanks!!"
