Synopsis: i like Aneesoft software because of it's simplicity, small footprint,
and is USB/Portable Media friendly! Aneesoft does exactly what it says without
all the bells & whistles like eye-candy which bog down the software with useless
dependencies, registry keys, and trash everywhere.

NOTES
-----
* YouTube Converter works! :)
i know the previous releases did not.. but Aneesoft has since fixed it.
What's so great? You can download multiple vidoes simultaneously, and 
it will even convert it to a format of your choosing.
* But make sure you select the correct original file format when you download 
or it will cause an error when it begins to convert. 

i.e. if it's HD Video.. select .MP4. (refer to provided screenshot below)
