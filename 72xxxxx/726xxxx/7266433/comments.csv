CleanMyPC has the usual 'Fix Registry' tools, but compared with Netgate, has a much better utility for examining startup problems and I was able to quickly spot and fix the problems that had been so difficult to deal with previously.

So, I would recommend this program as it dealt effectively with what had been a really difficult Registry issue for me."
