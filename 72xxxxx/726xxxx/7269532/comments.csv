,ellakim1,2012-05-14T20:27Z,Thank you so much. I don't understand why the other uploaders suddenly don't up an xvid in the middle of a series. All those h264's and no xvid till now! Thanks again.

,Digital_Orfanz,2012-05-14T21:18Z,"you're welcome all

@grahamt: sorry, I don't do cartoons

@ellakim1: yup, even if you think MP4s are better than XviD, changing in the middle of the US broadcast season was a brain dead decision.

I was going to post the series finale of Desperate Housewives, but it turns out there is already an XviD here.  The format is a bit odd, but it has 1000 seeders so that should suffice."
