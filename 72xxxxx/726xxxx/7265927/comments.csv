,joe8585,2012-05-13T06:28Z,Alright the NFO for this torrent is the wrong one. Im calling fake until someone can prove me otherwise. Not much faith until I complete the download but nothing looks legit so far. I mean cmon dvdrip of a movie not even in theaters yet......
,h903999,2012-05-13T07:11Z,"Don't confuse this direct-to-DVD title with the theatre to be released: ""Lincoln the Vampire Killer"".  This one is Zombies, by the same to-DVD company who brought you: ""Snakes on a TRAIN"""
,joe8585,2012-05-13T08:29Z,Your right my mistake. damn bootleg knockoffs getting my hopes up and shit.
,bubbanuggzz,2012-05-13T09:35Z,@joe8585 the green skull already proved you otherwise noob
,babybluetits24,2012-05-13T19:04Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2246549/ no imdb score yet , it sounds stupid

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 67 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info/screenshots or covers,  please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum & fakes (after theyve been online at least 60mins)  thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
