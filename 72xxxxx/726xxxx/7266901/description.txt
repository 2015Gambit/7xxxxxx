Austin Stevens is a South African snakemaster, as a wildlife photographer, 
he travels on assignment, documenting his activities finding and 
photographing snakes. This is a 2001 product.

During each episode, he searches for a certain species, 
while encountering and describing a variety of other snakes along the way.

Bay has the similar pack, but it does not contain the 9th episode:

              In Search of the Black Mamba

I also add the Chinese subtitle.
