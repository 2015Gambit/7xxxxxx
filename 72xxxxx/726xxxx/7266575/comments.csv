Thanks again!"

I get an almost unnoticeable shift in the dock, as if something is about to  open- but then it stops.
Any thoughts? Thanks again for uploads and help."

EZ Drummer all packs, SPL, Sugar Bytes... etc, etc, etc...
Including my new Traktor S4 with Traktor 2.5 Legal, not problems, not to mention a KONTROL X 1, ZeR0 SLMkII, RME with 8 analog inputs + 4 stereo inputs ADAT of a machine with a Steinberg VSL 2020 audio card working with Ableton (RME MIDI Clock port 2 to VSL 2020) sync and MIDI control to another machine under Linux with WINE by controlling to Clavia Nord Modular (ZeRo SLMkII MIDI IN/OUT port 1), more MIDI IN / OUT (RME MIDI port 1) to a Roland V-Synth...
