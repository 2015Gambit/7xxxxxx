By the latter half of 1968, Rock Steady had been superseded by a jumpier sound that in time became widely known as Reggae.

With some of Jamaica's most talented musicians at his disposal, Duke Reid's effortlessly adapted to this latest musical transformation and over the next few years continued to be a major player on the island's recording scene.

But by 1973, the growing influence of Rasta allied to his ill health led to a gradual reduction in his output, culminating in the sale of Treasure Isle to rival, Sonia Pottinger, in 1974. The following year, the Duke passed away after battling the effects of cancer for many months.

In the years immediately preceding his passing, Reid produced many of the most influential Reggae singles of the period, the most popular of which are collected on this, the most comprehensive collection of late sixties and early seventies Treasure Isle works yet to see issue.
