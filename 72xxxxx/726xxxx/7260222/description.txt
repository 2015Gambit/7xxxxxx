An outstanding firsthand account by the Mossad agents who planned and implemented the covert "Operation Eichmann." Shot on location in Austria, Germany, Italy, Argentina, England and Israel, the film uses a mixture of documentary techniques and dramatic reenactments to retrace Eichmann's escape route from Germany after World War II. Isser Harrel, the former head of Israel's secret service, recounts how his agency captured the Nazi fugitive and brought him to trial in Jerusalem. Adolf Eichmannn, the architect of the Final Solution, was eventually executed by the High Court of Israel. 

Narrated by actor Gregory Peck.
