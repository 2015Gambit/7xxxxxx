Storyline:
A violent storm hits a town in Maine, then an approaching cloud of mist appears the next morning.
As the mist quickly envelops the area, a group of people get trapped in a local grocery store, among them, artist David Drayton and his five-year-old son.
The people soon discover that within the mist lives numerous species of horrific, unworldly creatures that entered through an inter-dimensional rift,
possibly caused by a project on a nearby military base.
As the world around them turns into a literal Hell-on-earth, the horrified citizens try desperately to survive this apocalyptic disaster.
