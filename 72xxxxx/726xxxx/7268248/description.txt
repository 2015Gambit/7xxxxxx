"Give Me the Blame / Finishing the Hat"

All good things eventually come to an end, and in the 
two-hour finale, "Give Me the Blame" / "Finishing the 
Hat," Trip (Scott Bakula) begs Bree to tell him what 
really happened the night of Alejandro's murder as her 
trial begins to go south and it looks like she's about 
to be convicted; Gaby tries to come up with a solution 
that will take the burden off of Bree; Susan tries to 
keep the sale of her house private until she's had a 
chance to break the news to the ladies; Katherine 
Mayfair (Dana Delany) returns to Wisteria Lane and 
offers Lynette an intriguing job opportunity - which 
could end her chances of reconciling with Tom; the 
women all agree to take care of Mrs. McCluskey when 
they discover that she wants to die with dignity at 
home; Susan finds herself at wits end when Julie goes 
into labor at the most inopportune time; and Renee is 
shocked to discover that, as their wedding nears, Ben 
has been arrested and thrown in jail.
