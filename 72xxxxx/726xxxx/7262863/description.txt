Scales in Antiquity is a solo music project of multi-instrumentalist Dan Morgan. Using modern audio recording technology, an assortment of acoustic and electric instruments, and a variety of digital plug-ins, Scales in Antiquity has a sound that pulls from a multitude of genres. The result is a sound that is both fluid and rigid, organic and mechanical, and intense, dark, brooding, and optimistic all in one breath.

The debut Scales in Antiquity album ΓÇÿOriginsΓÇÖ is scheduled for release in May 2012. Self-recorded and released, with artwork by Julius Bernotas and mastering by Capp Audio Productions, the album is the epitome of the varied dynamics that listeners should come to expect from Scales in Antiquity. 10 songs and just over 40 minutes long, songs range from melodic instrumental guitar lines and soft, wire brush snare rolls and tambourine hits like in ΓÇÿThe Weight and the BalanceΓÇÖ to hard hitting passages including distorted electronic drums and effected vocals like in ΓÇÖ2011ΓÇ▓. The title track ΓÇÿOriginsΓÇÖ is the most epic instrumental rock song of the album, stretching to over 8 minutes long, and featuring lush, reverberated guitar and a steady drum beat throughout, finally ending with an emotional finish layered with glitchy electronic drums and keyboards.
