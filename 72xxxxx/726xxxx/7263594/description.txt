Hey all!

I put this pack together for you guys to get you all back playing online again!
In this pack is everything you need to get your MW2 up and running again
FROM alteriwnet TO FourDeltaOne.

All these files are avail from other sources, and I didn't make any of them.
I only put them all together in one easy pack, with clear instructions 
on how to use them all.

This pack has been tested by me and works just fine as of today. 5/12/12.

Please read the INSTALL.TXT file for full install info. 

Enjoy!

                   - it will ask to hit any key at times, do this as needed.

5. THATS IT! YOUR ALL SET, Launch iw4m.exe !!
    - during game start-up, it will ask you for a name and password,
    - these are the name and pass you made in the beginning
 
6?.?. - The game may not start up correctly when you try. there may be some
        errors about sum shit or another, if so, hit ok, or cancel or 
        whatever to quit, then run the game again. mine ran ok on the 2nd
