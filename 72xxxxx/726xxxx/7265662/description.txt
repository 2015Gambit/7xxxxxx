Detox diets are making news as the quickest, easiest way to shed pounds, boost your energy, and get yourself on a wellness track. Popular in the 1970s, cleansing fasts are again all the rage among celebrities like Gisele Bundchen, Gwyneth Paltrow, Stella McCartney, and Madonna.
One of the key advocates of the health benefits of cleansing detoxes is Roni DeLuz, ND, a licensed naturopathic and health practitioner at Martha's Vineyard Holistic Retreat, part of the renowned Martha's Vineyard Inn. The idea behind DeLuz's new detox plan is the belief that the foods we eat (along with the coffee, tea, and alcohol we drink and the air we breathe) contain harmful and toxic substances that accumulate in our bodies and need to be removed in some way. In 21 Pounds in 21 Days, DeLuz offers three different detox programs, including the original and most effective 21-day "MasterFast," which promises a 21-pound weight loss in just three weeks and focuses on detoxification through antioxidants, fasting, stress reduction, and lifestyle changes. Also included in the book are:
Maintenance plans
Dozens of easy, delicious recipes
Real-life tips
An extensive glossary of terms
A guide to supplements
Meals consist of supplement-laden drinks, herbal teas, thick, delicious vegetable purees, and "live" juices, along with nutritional supplements, vitamins, and enzymes designed to keep the body's systems stable and its cells nourished while harmful toxins are flushed out. 21 Pounds in 21 Days isn't just for those looking to lose weight; everyone can benefit from this revolutionary detox diet that results in a clean, refreshed system that functions at its best.
