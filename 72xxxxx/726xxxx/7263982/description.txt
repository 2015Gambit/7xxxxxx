Saxophonist Michael Blake and drummer Kresten Osgood have collaborated in
projects and groups before, but this is their first duet album. The extra space
available without a piano or guitar and bass really inspires them to investigate
both free jazz and interesting melodies. "Salutations" introduces the album at a
slow pace, with the musicians checking each other out and setting the stage for
the rest of the album. Once they are warmed up, the title track follows with a
very exciting performance and the two musicians are almost giddy with the
possibilities. The possibilities are exciting indeed, like using some subtle
overdubbing on the beautiful melody of Duke Ellington's classic "Creole Love
Call" before moving on to a spontaneous and bracing improvisation. "Elephants
are Afraid of Mice" is another rousing improvisation, their partnership is very
productive, acting like dance partners on a skewed and ever changing dance
floor. This alluring in-the-moment feel is also captured by "Cheryl" where Blake
and Osgood move on pure instinct through a free jazz performance filled with
impromptu spirit. A hidden track at the end of the album captures the to
musicians convulsing in uncontrollable laughter, and this giddiness and bonhomie
suffuses the entire album with devil may care excitement.
