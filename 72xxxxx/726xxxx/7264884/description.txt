This is the first part of the capes and claws series, a swashbuckling series of Ayroles and Masbou, who also wrote Garulfo. It was written in the style of an Italian comedy, which means that the most important plot points were thought of before, but the rest was improvisation. This makes the plot sometimes a bit messy, but overall I think they managed quite well. I hope that you enjoy this release.

Have a nice read!

This is a remastered version of the pack I uploaded. I translated the cover too, added a hind page, and re-compressed the pages since the old compression method (ACE) apparently gave some problems with ComicRack.

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).
Then, you can use ".cbr files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!

Hope you enjoy!
