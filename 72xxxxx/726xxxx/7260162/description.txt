Stop-motion/claymation graphic adventure game created in 1996 by Dreamworks and The Neverhood, Inc.  Way cool if you're into games that people put a TON of work into.  Must for any adventure/puzzle gamer.  Works fine with the fix on windows 7, don't know about XP or, God forbid, Vista.

Instructions for thickheads:

1. Mount the "Neverhood" image file using a virtual 

drive program like Alcohol 120 or Daemon Tools, or burn 

it to a CD and run it off that.

2. Install as usual.

3. Look in the "Neverhood_Win7_Color_Fix" folder.

4. Copy "WAVistaWin7" to the installation folder.

5. Rename the game exe to "WA" (add ".exe" if your 

computer is set up to display the file extension).

6. Use "WAVistaWin7" to play the game, (compatibility 

mode helps).

7. Share this game with people who appreciate art and 

puzzle games!
