As alway, much appreciated. here in North America it's tough being an F1 fan, no decent coverage, and what there is in on the TV at ungodly hours with no replays. We depend on good folk like you Footy, and you have been there for us all season, so thanks again.

Much appreciated. I've been going through withdrawal from the long wait for this race, next up Monaco, can't wait for that one."
