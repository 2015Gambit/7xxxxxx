The sustained dry wit of the dialogue and the wonderful interplay between the three main characters -

Jim Hacker, Sir Humphrey and Bernard Wooley - made Jonathan Lynn and Antony Jay's satirical comedy

compulsive viewing.

The strength of the writing makes these audios a joy to listen to.

These sixteen episodes of "Yes Minister" were specially adapted and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 1983 and 1984
