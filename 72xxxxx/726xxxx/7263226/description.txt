Louis CK - WORD - Live at Carnegie Hall (2012)

Ready for more Louis C.K.? You're in luck. The comedian released a brand new album, "WORD: Live at Carnegie Hall," today as a download on his website. Laughspin first reported the news this morning, and although they first indicated that the album would not be released until tomorrow, "Word" is currently available on louisck.net for $5.

The comedian received plenty of accolades for his latest one-hour special, "Live at the Beacon Theater," which he announced, produced, and independently released within about a month last November. This time, he's beat his own record by releasing the album without any formal announcement beforehand.
