,H.C.S.Klown,2012-05-12T10:04Z,"I listen/watch/use something and decide if I'm willing to spend money on it, when I'm out and come across it. Louis CK I like, I will probably get this once I see it in a store. But that's not going to stop me from downloading it now."
,RealPure,2012-05-12T14:42Z,Some people are fucking poor. Go q_q somewhere else about fairness. Bitch.
,thizzface,2012-05-12T19:02Z,"i have the money to buy this but i pirate it because fuck you. that's why.

,BagOfDicks,2012-05-12T20:13Z,"Don't lump that AIDS in audio form with Louis C.K. material, please."
,lsipain,2012-05-12T20:50Z,First half of the show completely repeats his TV appearance: 
,BagOfDicks,2012-05-12T22:49Z,"He doesn't try to hide that, though.

""This is material that I was performing two years ago (about) on a tour that was called ""Word"". Some of this material was on my FX show ""Louie"" in pieces but the entire show in one piece was never released. This show was recorded at Carnegie Hall on November 4, 2010."""
,lsipain,2012-05-13T14:39Z,"I'm just saying that if people wanna watch him actually performing this stuff, search for ""Louis CK Leno"" on youtube. Would love to see more of this performance in video though."
,tkoxxx,2012-08-09T11:19Z,"why are the moral police on a pirating site? the fuck? I don't care how much something is, I ALWAYS test it first before I buy.Same goes for albums, movies, games, etc."
