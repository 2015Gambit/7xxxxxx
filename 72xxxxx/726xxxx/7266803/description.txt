PLOT:
Memorial Day, 1993. When 13-year-old Kyle Vogel discovers the World War 
II footlocker belonging to his grandfather, Bud, everyone tells Kyle to 
put itback. Luckily, he ignores them. Although Bud has never talked 
about the war, he finds himself striking a deal with his grandson: Kyle 
can pick any three souvenirs, and Bud will tell him the stories behind 
each one. Memorial Day not only takes us on a journey into Bud's 
complicated wartime past, but also into Kyle's wartime future. As the 
two men share parallel experiences in combat, they come to realize how 
that magical day on the porch shaped both of their lives.
