Sylvia Mark wants to be just a normal girl. She wants to go to school, play sports, hang out with her friends, and maybe talk to boys. She can do without the nightmares that assail her nightly and she's not too crazy about the spurts of freakish strength that get her into trouble. But what she can really do without is the group of shadowy strangers that have started following her. Unfortunately, Sylvia is going to have to get used to all of these things.  

Sylvia is a thirteen year-old girl who feels like an outcast from the other kids her age. She skipped two grades, is amazingly strong, and has the olympic level gymnastic agility. Sylvia also feels incomplete, and always has strange dreams. Night after night these dreams seem to be harbingers of something dark. What she doesn't know is that she's just one of one hundred girls created as part of a genetics experiment, each with their own superpowers. Eight girls were taken out of the facility, and grew up secretly across the country; Sylvia was one of them.
