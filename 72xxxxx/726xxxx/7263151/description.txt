It's hardly a surprise that a band called Lonely Drifter Karen would be as footloose and fancy free as possible, and the trio's third album, Poles, shows they're just as willing to change their music as their location. Core members Tanja Frinta and Marc Meliá Sobrevias moved to Brussels after a stint in Barcelona with longtime drummer Giorgio Menossi, recruiting French multi-instrumentalist Clément Marion along the way. Regardless of whether it was the change in lineup or home base that caused it, Poles finds Lonely Drifter Karen striking off in a bold new direction, injecting their already masterful blend of folk, pop, and cabaret with rock and electronic touches, but these new additions don't tame the group at all - if anything, these vivid, intricate songs are among the freest in their songbook.
