[V],dynstab2,2012-05-11T05:45Z,This file is an exact duplicate of the watermarked PDF  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7212110/Tate_-_Seeleys_Principles_of_Anatomy_and_Physiology_2nd_%28c2012%29 uploaded two weeks ago. This uploader is a repeat duplicator of files already indexed on TPB (and not just mine). This duplicate upload is reindexed to erase a warning by a moderator for uploading infected files (not this one). [...]

[V],dynstab2,2012-05-18T23:27Z,"Watermarks (made with 2 different uncommon apps; extremely hard to spot and remove) show the first being a repeat outright liar and the second being genuinely deceived (assuming no puppeteering spin). This rogue uploader has been slapped twice on Demonoid for duplicating the exact same files and had his/her sorry ass kicked out in a mere 2 weeks for these and other lowly actions (like indexing infected files). That is that.

Here when you tell an uploader he/she duplicated your file (that's all you can do here, moderators don't moderate) they hypocritically downgrade your status for commenting, thinking you won't notice."
