This is my ogg vorbis rip of the CD, a classic "soul jazz" recording.

From Wikipedia:

"Phenix is an album by jazz saxophonist Cannonball Adderley recorded at the Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California in 1975 featuring performances by Adderley's Quintet with Nat Adderley, Michael Wolff, Walter Booker and Roy McCurdy with guest percussionist Airto Moreira and sessions featuring past Quintet members George Duke, Sam Jones, and Louis Hayes.

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars and states 'Adderley's next-to-last recording (cut just four months before he died of a stroke at age 46) was ironically a retrospective... A recommended set with plenty of excellent music, it serves as a fine overview of Cannonball Adderley's career'."
