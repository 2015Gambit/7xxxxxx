,Namorax,2012-05-13T08:04Z,"lol this isnt Battleship, so why would you care"
,thaifss,2012-05-13T08:42Z,This is really American Warship...a knock-off low budget movie for the Sci-Fi TV channel. American Battleship is the big-budget movie by Universal Studios. Universal sued Sci-Fi for using copying their movies name what has been uploaded doesn't show the name change.
