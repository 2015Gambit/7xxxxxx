,mattblak,2012-05-14T12:16Z,"Thank you to EZTV for all you have done in the past and the future.

HOWEVER: I understand many Torrent folk now use x264 codec. But previously many people used or still want to use their XVID/AVI compatible DVD or Blu-Ray players to watch shows in the comfort of their lounges and TV rooms, with the fireplace going during winter, NOT on a small PC or laptop screen!! Some people have PC-based media servers to watch some fancy codecs, I know. But many people can't afford that sort of equipment, especially for a single-use. Those of us in 'foreign' down-under countries are months or YEARS behind U.S. and U.K. shows. THAT'S why we download!! And when they do eventually play here, its often very late at night un-advertised or on expensive Sky/Cable subscription channels FULL of adverts.

PLEASE PLEASE go back to XVID/AVI codecs. I have been wasting hours converting x264 to DVD so I can watch them in the comfort of the lounge. And I don't keep those discs - being rewritable, I erase straight after watching. I never had to do that with XVID. I have tried to buy a DVD player that handles x264. BUT IN MY COUNTRY AT LEAST, they do NOT exist!!

And I can't speak for everyone, but many shows I have downloaded, I often end up buying them on Box set DVDs, so from me at least, TV/film companies are not losing money. And I RARELY download movies - and NEVER the shot-with camcorder ones."
,rayban66,2012-05-14T12:56Z,I'm hearing you mattblak....eztv please post .avi version as well. 
,Thetic,2012-05-14T15:30Z,"eztv don't listen to them, x264 is fine."
,chadz1991,2012-05-14T15:43Z,Please can someone upload a avi one please. cos thats all i can use. Thanks! 
,ajzaak,2012-05-14T17:14Z,seed please
,ust2,2012-05-14T17:55Z," So it's either mkv or mp4 for this one? Well, neither of those help me out lol.

 The scene is really letting me down this time, about half of this sunday's shows don't have an avi uploaded for them :("
,carmen_lisrose,2012-05-14T19:33Z,"Thank you eztv, you have never let us down! "
,raffytaffy,2012-05-15T02:01Z,Thank you.
,euphoria4949,2012-05-15T05:11Z,"Last ever episode of Desperate Housewives :( I'm sad now!
Thanks eztv for all the uploads, really appreciate it."
,BrikHaus,2012-05-15T06:36Z,"@mattblak - x264 codec was chosen because it is a superior format. No amount of grovelling will get them to go back to avi. Its like complaining about SD TV because HDTV is out and everyone has that now. Move with the times Man.

Get yourself down to Officeworks, buy a Western Digital Live for $130, and an 2.5"" external drive, and copy all your shows to that. The WD live will play any format, and simply plugs into your TV. Easy."
,ShahinD,2012-05-16T03:31Z,"Thanks
x264/H264 is much much better than DIVX/XVID

any one that wants XVID download other's group releases"
,mattblak,2012-05-17T10:25Z,"Brikhaus - I hear what you're saying and when I get a new TV next year I'll certainly consider it. And ShahinD: I would if other groups still did XVID, but most don't. Also, guys; re-read my first comment - all the reasons are there. Also, its not about x264 being better - it probably is - its about convenience with existing equipment compatability. Also, XVID is/was entirely adequate just for viewing on a simple data DVD then deleting later!! And like I said: if I really like a show, I BUY it later on DVD or Blu-Ray. Otherwise TV and movie companies miss out, and we can actually damage the industry. Downloads in this forum are actually useful 'promo' tools to see if I like a show. If I don't, I don't download them again."

The world is moving on with tech and we all have to move with it, everyone else is dealing with it and enjoying better quality movies."
