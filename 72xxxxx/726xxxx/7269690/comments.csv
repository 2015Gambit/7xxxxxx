,Kdawgs,2012-05-26T08:32Z,"@seventhfirst: Thank you for standing up for those of us who prefer AVI  to ""x264/h264 video & AAC HE v2 Audio"". We don't NEED it on OUR iPods or phones.
@vreyhr676y: These Comment boards are for appreciation and evaluation of what being given to us for free not to bash, hate and criticize.
P.S. If your 'puter can't handle the file size...  I suggest an upgrade or an Ext.HHD. Until then... have a coke a smile and shut the fuck up!  "
