Chamak is a village school teacher, utterly sophisti. Incidently he is married to a well educated and wealthy girl. On the first night of the marriage his mother has to force him to meet his wife in the next room Chamak blissfully ignorant of the joy of such meeting plods towards the brides room. At the door he hears a baby cry and rushing back to the mother and tells her that her daughter-in-law has given birth to a baby. The mother is plunged into despair at her sons simplicity. . Chamak is very anxious to see his father-in-laws wealthy place but has no chance to do so. Providentially such a chance comes. Chamak loses his post and his father-in-law himself comes to take him to his place. At first Chamak is paid high respect due to a son-in-law. He is ushered to a Dining Hall teaming with dishes of delicious food, fruits and sweets. Chamak grabs the dainties with terrific voracity totally indifferent to the repulsion produced by his rusticity at the table. Consquently he loses weight with his in-laws and is treated with scant courtesy. Chamak smarts and foams at this insult but for want of alternative meekly submits.`Time and Tide await none. Chamak is a gifted singer. The town theatre director hears him sing and employs him in the theatre. Soon Chamak is prosperous and makes fine clothes and dresses. The in-laws look upon his prosperity as due to thieving dacoity. Chamak is greatly enraged at his unwarranted suspicion and is goaded into avenging the wrong done to him. How he avenges himself with love and respect for them and rises from height to height of prsperity come and see on the screens of `Damad with an appeal far more powerful and ringing than these words can tell.
