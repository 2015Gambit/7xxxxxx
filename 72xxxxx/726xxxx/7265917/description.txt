DESCRIPTION:

In this era of fad diets, detox programs, and "superfoods," this examination of the relationship between diet and lifestyle looks to the Far East to claim 
that the simple principles to live by are balance and moderation. By rebuilding the connections between what is put into the body and how it functions, 
the diet outlined in this book teaches the daily effects that particular food choices will haveΓÇöon bodyweight, energy, mood, and the quality and 
duration of lifeΓÇöand that ultimately all foods are good in the right proportion. All major food groups are covered, with additional sections on 
dietary supplements, lifestyle, and attitude, plus a handful of recipes to demonstrate the principles of the diet.
