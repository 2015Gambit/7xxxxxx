ΓÇ£I feel that Travis Morgan has created a book that is simple to read with a purpose and focus that is beneficial to all. I feel this book is an excellent resource for parents of any aged children. It shows how to actively monitor computer usage as well as tips for discussing certain issues/behaviors with a child. Additionally, the book encourages an open communication between spouses regarding on-line behaviors. It is a particularly good read for anybody who is not computer savvy.
As an educator and a parent, I would recommend this book as a great resource for anybody wanting to learn how to monitor internet and on-line activity of your child.ΓÇ¥
