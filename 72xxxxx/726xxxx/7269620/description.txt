Title : Hyperdelic Video
Length: 56:44
Format: MP4

This is an hour-long video of early 90s techno music set to trippy visuals. I got this on VHS from a friend in 1992. It's a copy of a copy, so the quality isn't the best. The video doesn't show for the first five seconds, but it's okay after that. Sorry about it being so big. I converted it with Handbrake and this is what it gave me. I've included a 60 second sample so you can try it before you download it all.

There's another music video from the same group (Hyperdelic) at the Internet Archive: http://www.archive.org/details/Timothy_Leary_Archives_295

Enjoy!
