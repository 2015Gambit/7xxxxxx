,Velorian1,2012-05-13T03:22Z,"thanks ez... And try to disregard the retard that thinks you should do more work to make his life easier. 
seemovies: get better equipment, and drop a thank you every now and again you fucking douche bag!"
,ajarnmark,2012-05-13T04:19Z,"seemovies should simply try getting a dvd player with usb plug then copy onto usb flashdrive, and plug it in. Good to go. I didn't know anyone still uses cd/dvd. It's great to be able to get a copy of these shows. I'm in an area that doesn't have access to the airing (Thailand) so this is my only avenue. Thank you for the share. Great show, sexy birds, and good acting throughout, what more can a man abroad ask for?"

,ItsClueless,2012-05-13T12:31Z,I am new to all this.  I have been downloading AVI files and they work but now everything in the past few weeks seems to be MP4.  My BlueRay Player is only 6 months old and it does not play MP4's from the usb for some reason. I have tried converting MP4's to AVI but the sound doesn't match the film.   THANKS for everything you do!!!!!  I will just have to figure it all out again :)  It's just hard Cause I am Clueless. 
,Bartolllo,2012-05-23T06:03Z,"I've been downloading .avi's for some time now. 349mb for your average 1hr. show (42mins) and 550mb for HBO series. Now there is 15 Fuckin' different sizes for every upload...
I understand that the only human who likes change is a wet baby... This aside, I downloaded 4 episodes of Magic City in .mp4 format (304mb, 318mb, 342mb, and 326.6mb) and burned a DVD... that is, DVD format viewable in a 10 yr. old DVD player ...and to my fucking surprise... the SOB works.... Thank-you ConvertextoDVD-4.All TV episodes I used to download in .avi are now finished for the season, now it's on to mp4's.
Any do's and don't's from the experts, related to dl/burning DVD's in .mp4 format (different file sizes) with ConvertextoDVD4 would be appreciated
Bart out.."
