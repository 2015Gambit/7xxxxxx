Unlock the Power of your HP-50 Calculator!

The HP50g Calculator is the flagship calculator from Hewlett Packard that can handle many advanced math functions that are used in science, engineering, and high school AP classes.  Unfortunately, the calculator itself can be difficult to use if the student doesn't take the time to learn the functions.

This DVD set will teach the student how to use the HP50g using step-by-step video examples.  This way, the student learns by doing rather than reading a dry manual.
