,jessie.p.johnson,2012-05-13T14:28Z,"Thanks a bunch, Nepotu.  Do me a favor, buddy.  When you post game 2 of this series please leave a comment ""mentallyyours, kindly stop leaving comments about what happens in the game...you are spoiling it for others"".  I could leave a comment, but he would never see it if he has already downloaded the game.

Thanks kindly!"

,CloudedForce,2012-05-14T08:12Z,Hey Nepotu ty for the great upload. I am a huge celtics fan and was hoping you may have some of this big threes older playoff footage. Im working on downloading last season but anything you may have would be great and id seed it indefinitely.
