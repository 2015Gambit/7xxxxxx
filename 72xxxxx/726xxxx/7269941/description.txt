SUPER SPEEDERS 1

LAP OF NYC

Enter the world of the Super Speeders, where horsepower rules and the rules of the road don't apply. Get ready for 90 minutes of edge-of-your-seat entertainment that will leave you wondering what we could possibly think of next. Watch thrill seekers smoke their tires and rip up the streets in and around New York City. You'll see 20 Ferraris take over Times Square and do burnouts on 42nd Street. Souped up sports cars will power slide their way across city streets and do donuts in a 10th Avenue intersection. Your adrenaline will pump as a Lamborghini Gallardo hits its top speed and 60 exotic cars storm up the highway to Connecticut. Buckle up as we push the limits of sanity and the pavement in NYC.
