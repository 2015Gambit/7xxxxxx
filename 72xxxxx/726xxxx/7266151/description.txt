 DESCRIPTION:

 Beginning to learn a completely new language can be a daunting prospect. "Success with Languages" is designed to help all students develop the skills 
 they need to become an effective language learner and to make the most of language study. Written by experienced language teachers at the 
 Open University, this book offers crucial and practical advice on important areas such as: - choosing the language and study programme - setting 
 personal goals for language learning and monitoring progress - using ICT to support language learning. 

 Each of the ten chapters feature a number of exercises in order to help students assess the ways they learn and consider where improvements can be 
 made, making the most of media available and how to use resources effectively. Designed primarily for undergraduate and postgraduate students 
 studying courses that involve a language component, this study guide is more than relevant to anyone learning a language in any situation. 
 Whatever their motivation and goals, this book will help students to realize their potential and open their minds to new cultures, peoples and heritage.
