,Shatnypamsss11,2012-05-13T17:18Z,please seed!! tnx!
,LethalDosez,2012-05-14T02:19Z,What is the point in not seeding and making people wait 3 days for every post?  I dled a 40 gig remux from public hd that i set to dl at the same time as this post at 700 megs. I mean cmon your encodes are terrible in the first place but to purposely not seed thats just gay.
,cdplaya,2012-05-14T03:00Z,@LethalDosez-the seeding is done on my part and  you have to understand that I am a busy college student and i work...my life doesnt revolve around these torrents .... i think you should appreciate the fact that I am even doing this in the first place.... your not paying to do this so i have the free will to post whenever i want and if its so terrible why even bother downloading it....by the way what do you mean by gay? 
,LethalDosez,2012-05-14T04:53Z,Every once in a while you have to kick a guy in the ass to get em moving. Thanks for the Dance crew posts and keep up the good work!

,cdplaya,2012-05-14T11:26Z,"@LethalDosez - I dont think your method of kicking me in the ass is gonna make me move anywhere...it'll only make the situation worse....I can stop making these torrents completely...trust me i have a lot of other better things to do but i choose to do this for you guys....lets get one thing straight im no ones bitch and I wont be told what to do..... if you dont like the way I operate here you can take your impatient,ungrateful ass somewhere else and find someone else's ass to kick around ...."

There are ungrateful users around who mooch off others' effort and complain about it. Please don't stop releasing ABDC episodes, and take your time for uploading; it's worth it for the quality. Thanks a lot for helping me watch a show I can't see in my country!! As always, epic uploading."
