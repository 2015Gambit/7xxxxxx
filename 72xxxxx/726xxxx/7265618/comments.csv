It's h264/ac3 in mp4 container encoded with standard setiings. It should work flawless on every decent PC [better with a media player dxva compliant such Media Player Classic]. Recent media players dedicated standalone [TV incorporated for sure ] should also play this kind of rip with no problems.

So....try harder !
Good luck."
