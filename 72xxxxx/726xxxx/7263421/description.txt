TAPE 02, our second issue, is available now, featuring editorials by Sandra Åberg, Angela Marklew and Paolo Prisco, among others. Music-wise we’ve been busy, with a multitude of live and album reviews, a new indie corner, and interviews with And Also The Trees and Cinephile.

Download it, read it, and if you like it, share it. Maybe even pick up a print copy. In any case, keep a look out for future issues every 2 months!
