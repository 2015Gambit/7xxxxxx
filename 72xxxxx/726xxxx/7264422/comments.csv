I'm uploading the file, but it registers as 0 seeders. Please someone try to download this so I can either verify a mistake on my part or a delay in torrent status update. Thanks"

,Psych007,2012-05-14T19:00Z,"Well dangit.... I've noticed episode five (05) is of a rather bad quality. Sorry guys. Either watch it on YouTube, or download with ""Free YouTube Downloader"". That's what I did (no conversion - mp4). v3.5.126.0 was the one I used...."
