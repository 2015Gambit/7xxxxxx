What is your problem? It is a HDTV-Rip, so it has been recorded from Nick in 720p HD-Quality.
This means it contains the Nick-Logo.
If you don't like, than just don't download it!!!
Maybe you can find a better 720p Version of it, and upload it here! I'm so sick of you people, who never ever had any upload here, but only  complaining and demanding!!! This is all free!!!
So please shut the F@ck up, Jerkface!!!"
