,Sasshi106,2012-05-21T13:26Z,Hey downloaded it and installed no prob... but the game doesnt launch. Says problem with the dat file u gave me.
,xorkatoskipreos,2012-06-01T02:17Z,"when i try to open ZH i have this message...

you have encountered a serious error.  serious errors can be caused by many things including viruses, overheated hadware and hardware that does not meet the minimum specifications for the game.

my pc model is: Lenovo win7

processor: AMD Athlon(tm)II Dual-Core M320 2.10 GHz
memmory (RAM): 2.00GB
system type: 32-bit

any thing wrong? "
,Lvobjectx,2012-06-01T10:02Z,"@Xorkatoskipreos use the desktop shortcut to open it. I got the same error when I tried to open it using the crack, but when I double-clicked on the desktop shortcut I created it opened up perfectly =). Hope that helps."
,R4ffe,2012-06-03T01:43Z,"@Xorkatoskipreos do as lvobjectx said, open it with the icon on the desktop and there should be no problem at all. Your computer is good enough to run this game. :)"
,doctor.elias,2012-06-07T19:54Z,does this work on x64-bit ?
,Lvobjectx,2012-06-08T02:45Z,"@doctor.elias yes it does, my computer is 64-bit and it works perfectly."
,ErickFTG,2012-06-10T16:45Z,"I had the issue that many posters said above. My computer is above the minimum requirements and I clicked on the desktop shortcut.

Anyone got an idea of what can be done?"
,Mazikz,2012-06-11T02:41Z,"I downloaded the crack for generals that was in the description, but when i attempt to open the game from the directory and desktop, it proceeds to attempt to load and eventually says ""Sorry, a serious error occurred.""

Someone please help me out.

Thanks and I appreciate it."
,L3nny,2012-06-13T10:27Z,can we play online with this?
,R4ffe,2012-06-14T22:05Z,Command and conquer generals and zero hour cant be played online since all servers are down. But you can play it on a lan or hamachi.
,pbcrazy,2012-06-20T04:20Z,"Ok im going to sound dumb probably, but i download this and i got a folder with a bunch of different things in it, there are 2 .mds and 2 .mdf for each generals, a zip folder with the crack, and the zip folder with the update. This is the first time i hve ever done this, what do i do?"
,pbcrazy,2012-06-20T04:28Z,"Im a first timer and have no clue what im doing, i downloaded and seeded this and i got a folder that has 2 .mdf and 2 .mds files for each generals, and a zip folder for the crack and update. What do i do? "
,pbcrazy,2012-06-20T04:28Z,Sorry the first comment didnt show up but now both are on there :/
,R4ffe,2012-07-05T01:31Z,"@pbcrazy You have to mount those files using a program called Daemon tools which you need to install almost any game that you download.
Just download Daemon tools and mount the 1 file thats for generals and after thats done it will ask for the second part and you do the same on zero hour"
,Thelies,2012-07-05T19:22Z,"Hey uhm, whenever I try to load Generals or Zero Hour, even from the desktop it says ""Please insert the correct CD-ROM and try again"" 

:("
,R4ffe,2012-07-09T20:03Z,@Thelies Did you update it and then copy the crack over?
