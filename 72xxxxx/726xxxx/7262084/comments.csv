,moosh,2012-05-17T08:23Z,"everyone stuck at 99.8% ...

question for deny87 -- if you are the original seeder ,,, how are you stuck ?? you should have the full original version ... 

Also - except for 1 deep purple & 1 coverdale/page - none of your other torrents have even started yet ... 0% ... what is going on here ??"
,deny87,2012-05-17T12:15Z,"Answer to Moosh......I am not the original seeder, this torrent and the other torrents I found on the net ...... I wanted to with the help of you who love this, these torrents works ... because these are rare things .... I did not create them.If this can be turned on torrents that do not work (except for compilation Rare Rainbow, Deep Purple Sttutgart  & Coverdale Page) .... help ..... or tell me how to seed?"
,deny87,2012-05-18T15:35Z,"Guys,this video works....if not going to 100 %,but it's complete.

Note:Torrents that don't work,i did not create them, I found it."
,deny87,2012-05-18T17:37Z,"i uploaded this torrent again.....try to download,i hope it works :)"
,moosh,2012-05-19T07:04Z,"Hi - New torrent you created works ... mine just completed - 100% .. 

Thank you .. 

Just a little clarification for you ::

re: your note - 'Torrents that don't work,i did not create them, I found it' .... You ARE creating the 'torrent' when posting it to this site , you ARE the original 'seeder' for this site ..... as long as the dvd file was 100% complete, wherever you found it, you ARE the one bringing it to this site ,,, whether you originally created the file or not ... all of us leechers have to depend on you for the completed source material based on the torrent we download from here
(or at least that is the way I understand this whole process)

Thank you again ... "
,deny87,2012-05-26T16:21Z,"Thanks for clarification.....i understand this process.
Everyone depends on the original seeder,but in this case it was not me. Cheers Moosh & All of you!"
