mewithoutYou returns with their 5th studio album, Ten Stories.
Helmed by producer Daniel Smith (Sufian Stevens) and mixed by Brad
Wood (Smashing Pumkins), Ten Stories is an allegorical coellection
of songs that, at first listen, follows a winding narrative about
a circus train crash in 19th century Montana. Long time fans will
know that although we are introduced to a talking elephant, fox
and tiger there is always more then meets the eye.
