Description: As Mordecai walks to the coffee shop ready to ask Margaret out, he looks through the window and sees Margaret with another guy who is in the position of proposal, making Margaret say "yes, dude! yes!" After Mordecai sees this, he goes back to the park and locks himself in his room listening to a song on repeat smelling rancid (much to the chagrin of Rigby). Fed up with Mordecai's self-incarceration, Rigby sets up an account for Mordecai on an internet dating website.
