Gene Vincent - A Million Shades of Blue [2008] [Anthology]

Nearing the end of his life, Gene Vincent cut two astonishing Country-Rock albums for New York's Kama Sutra label.  If Only You Could See Me Today and The Day The World Turned Blue were released in 1970 and '71 respectively.  This CD couples the two albums, and is accompanied by a booklet which includes detailed liner notes.
You're no doubt familiar with his 1950s rockin' classics.  Here is how Gene Vincent sounded in the latter part of his career with two of the best Roots/Americana albums of the time.
