    This features 28 radio broadcast transcriptions from the mid- to late '40s of Merle at arguably the peak of his strengths. These loose, Cliffie Stone-produced broadcasts capture Merle at his most relaxed and musically imaginative. His version of "Cannonball Rag," which features a bridge not found on the better-known Capitol version, is absolutely mind-boggling in its effortless technique, while his coughing spurt in the middle of a duet with wife Tex Ann is loaded with simplistic charm. In between the solo guitar pieces are a great a cappella "Churchy Time," some of the early band hits like "Divorce Me C.O.D.," and the trial run (from The Grand Ole Opry) of "When My Baby Double Talks to Me." Transfer quality varies wildly, but nothing sounds horrible, and the performances are worth every nick and pop. A marvelous collection.
