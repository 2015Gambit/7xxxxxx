Audio looks like 2 channels stereo or is it just my VLC?

,ajnsd,2012-05-13T04:55Z,"Thank you Aiden! Nice work. Another film by Korea that is pure Fire. Sick movie, for sure. 

A: 8
V: 7
M: 10

After about 5 minutes into the film, you'll forget you're reading subs or that the video quality isn't perfect. 

Don't be fooled by the beginning either--give it a chance--the movie is not a slow burn, the action picks up right away (that last comment is directed at my fellow Americans). 

Aiden, thanks again dude.

Inspired by a true story. Jun Shik works for Tatsuo's grandfather's farm while Korea is colonized by Japan, but he has a dream to participate in Tokyo Olympics as a marathon runner. Tatsuo also aims to become a marathon runner, so the two are in rivalry. But war breaks out and they both are forced to enlist in the army. Tatsuo becomes the head of defense in Jun Shik's unit and he devises a scheme but fails. Jun Shik and Tatsuo are captured by the Soviets. They run away but soon are captured by Germans and forced to separate. In 1944, they meet again at the shores of Normandy."
