And morning and evening, the beautiful commuter acknowledges himΓÇöjust like she does everyone else on the platform. But Blake Hartt is not like the others . . . heΓÇÖs homeless. Memories of a broken childhood have robbed him of peace and twisted delusions into his soul. He stays secluded from the sun, sure the world would run from him in the harsh light of day. 

Each day, Livia McHugh smiles politely and acknowledges her fellow commuters as she waits for the train to the city. She dismisses this kindness as nothing special, just like her. SheΓÇÖs the same as a million other girlsΓÇöcertainly no one to be cherished. But special or not, she smiles every day, never imagining that someone would rely on the simple gesture as if it were air to breathe.

When the moment comes that Livia must do more than smile, without hesitation she steps into the fray to defend the homeless man. And she's surprised to discover an inexplicable connection with her new friend. After danger subsides, their smiles become conversation. Their words usher in a friendship, which awakens something in each of them. But itΓÇÖs not long before their bond must prove its strength. Entanglements from the past challenge both their love and their lives.

BlakeΓÇÖs heart beats for LiviaΓÇÖs, even if her hands have to keep its rhythm. Love is patient. Love is kind. Love never fails. Love never fails, right?

Complicated families and confused souls find their way to light in this novel, which manages to be racy, profane, funny, and reverent all at once.
