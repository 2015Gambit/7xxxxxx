,Shep43,2012-05-12T23:24Z,"Ipmark - is there any way of getting the ""gmapprom"" or the ""gmapsupp"" IMG file, I've downloaded your ""for Mapsource"" 2013.10 files but have NO SMUCKING clue where to  get ""gmapsupp"" IMG file from. Trying to get your Unlocked IMG file torrent but nobody is seeding and I'd rather not combine 5 maps into a whole North America NT IMG file."
,Ipmark,2012-05-13T09:19Z,"Using the GmapTool's join function you will obtain a fully working map, I used many times this method without any issues. It's fast and easy.
If you prefer, you can use the Mapsource tool provided in the package. Install the tool, overwrite the original Mapsource.exe with the patched one. Start the tool, select the map release (upper left corner), click on the map tool (the irregular shape icon not the tool menu) and highlight all the component maps you want, assign a name to your map.
Finally send the mapset to the device or to a folder of your harddisk."
,funkoligy,2012-05-13T14:49Z,PPL please seed

,funkoligy,2012-05-13T21:26Z,Thanks Ipmark will do.
,funkoligy,2012-05-13T21:47Z,"Hi i followed that Ipmark but for each map it reads this

== Warning: repeated map ID number.
== Map ID 17647942 (10D4946)

There were errors, result is faulty.

I cant get it to join all unlocked maps"
,funkoligy,2012-05-13T21:56Z,Ipmark can you email that link to me please funkoligy1 at yahoo dot com. thanks

,ram26,2012-05-15T00:37Z,new to gps.need help.what to do after downloading torrent? also not able to open basecamp.exe.
,Ipmark,2012-05-15T01:05Z,"Decompress the maps with Winrar and put the gmapsupp.img file in the Garmin folder (older models) or Map folder (newer models) of Garmin GPS.
Basecamp must to be patched to works properly, install the original version and overwrite the Basecamp.exe file with the patched one.
Then copy a map on a pendrive (FAT32 filesystem, Garmin folder) plug it in a USB port of the PC and start the tool"
,Fritz1670,2012-05-20T05:20Z,"Ipmark, any chance you could help an idiot (me) out and post a just a North America 2013.10 gmapprom.img file? It sure would be appreciated!!!  Thanks in advance"
,Mustafa_NYC,2012-05-20T06:15Z,"Installation was easy for me. However, your other torrent https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7261170/Garmin_CN_North_America_NT_2013.10_Unlocked_for_Mapsource

shows lane assist. This one does not.I like the other one better (the one with mapinstall).

Thank you for sharing the maps!"

,Visokoo,2012-06-03T23:27Z,Thank you so much. =]
,hchang9,2012-06-07T07:59Z,I messed up. I accidentally formatted my garmin 1450 and wiped out all the contents. Does anyone know how I can fix this? Any downloads I can get? Any help would be great. Thanks.
,edmitchell,2012-06-23T05:47Z,"Okay, so big ass NOOB here, I have a question:
I do not have a garmin device, I just want to be able to view the maps using mapsoource or basecamp ( it doesn't really matter which.)I'm just looking for an offline mapquest sort of thing here. Anyways, I have downloaded this torrent and am unable to view the maps in mapsource or basecamp. I have already installed both programs and have put in the patched exe's. I have ran the mapset toolkit with cgpsmapper and keep getting the error: E032 Layer 0 cannot be empty. What does this mean?? I have also tried splitting the gmapsupp.img files with Gmaptool and then tried to load each of those files, but have had no success. I have already tried everything posted in this and other torrents' comment areas with similiar luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
,ranjo52,2012-07-18T16:12Z,"hi ipmark
i downloaded 2013 and installed in garmin
When i try to tpye in an address it tells me no data"
,Puterman,2012-07-30T14:16Z,"Thank you so much Ipmark!!!
I really appreciate the separation of the different maps. My little Nuvi350 just can't handle the size of the full mapset. This is perfect!"
,digigypsy,2012-08-12T22:04Z,"I kept getting write errors until I figured out that GMapTool was having trouble creating a new file... when I made an empty file called 'gmapsupp.img' in the target directory, I could save with no problem... Hope that's helpful to someone. :)"
