Description:
The Wheel of Time is a first-person shooter video game based on Robert Jordan's fantasy series of the same name. For thousands of years The Dark One has been trapped, but now the four keys keeping him sealed have been found. It is your job to lead the forces to collect all four together. In doing so you must command a vast army and make use of over 40 magical artifacts, which can produce fireballs, healing spells and the ability to send a tremor through the Earth. The game is based on Unreal Engine technology, and combines elements of first-person-shooter games such as Unreal with strategy/role-playing game elements.
