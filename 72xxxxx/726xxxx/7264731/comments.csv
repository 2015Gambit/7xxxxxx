Not to be a hater (the fast upload is awesome), but why is this posted in Hires - TV Shows instead of just TV Shows?  I have a bookmarked search for hi res uploads of this show, and it's kind of lame to search for hi res and have results that even have filenames that clearly say 360p, which is even worse resolution than standard, non-hi-def television.  This is far from the only time it's happened, so I don't mean to point any particular fingers, but it renders the specific search criteria effectively useless.  Just a thought...

Thanks for the fast upload, though.  I love to see attention brought to this show.  It's great!  I will be anxiously awaiting the higher res upload soon...  Thanks again!"
,JimiPain,2012-05-12T23:02Z,This isn't Highres at all. The sound quality is really bad.
,korralove,2012-05-13T00:08Z,"People, before you post comments, about a less favourable quality, maybe read my first post explaining the quality. "
