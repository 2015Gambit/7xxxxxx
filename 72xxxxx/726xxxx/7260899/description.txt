The year is TCY 412, and a long age of peace is broken when mysterious and powerful fleets of starships suddenly orchestrate a coup d'état against the Transbaal Empire. The Transbaal homeworld is surrounded almost immediately, after which they begin an orbital bombardment of the capital. The orbiting space station, which seems to be the one that is used as the Moon Angel Troupe's base in the anime, is also destroyed, while the White Moon suffers significant damage. From this, the Elle Ciel along with the Moon Angel Troupe and their Emblem Frames manage to escape in order to get help. 

    Meanwhile, out in the remote Criom star system, a small 3 ship garrison is on standby while trying to find out more information about the coup d'état. On the bridge of the cruiser, the Commanding Officer of the garrison, Takuto Meyers, is scolded by his XO, Lester Coolduras for being too carefree in his attitude.
