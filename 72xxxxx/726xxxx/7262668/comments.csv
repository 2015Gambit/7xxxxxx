As in wired better, genetically superior, purer souls by birthâ&#x20AC;&#x201D;made of the Right Stuff, worthy of what comes to them, more worthy, perhaps, of life.

Doubt me? From the blurb: â&#x20AC;&#x153;A significant chunk of the electorate, it seems, will never accept the facts as they are, no matter how strong the evidence.â&#x20AC;? Just you ponder what this sentence implies.""

""The Republican Brain"" Do they have a ""brain""? :))))"
,ut1880h,2012-05-12T14:23Z,""" War on science"", lol. Like ""the war on women"", I suppose. The Leftist cult knows no limit in their incessant quest to justify their own bullshit by smearing everyone that doesn't partake of their koolaid.

The real story will be told in a book titled, ""The Left's Bullshit and it's 'War on Sanity'""."
,brianxxx,2012-05-12T17:02Z,"I do not believe republicans are 'dummer'. But it is obvious that they do not get their news and info from honest, reliable sources. I am an independent and I favor no party. But I have to vote democrat for now because they are the lesser of 2 evils. I meet with clients from all over the US and Europe. The Europeans always ask me why republicans are so evil (their term, not mine!) and why they ""hate"" so much? I tell them it is because the republican voters are misled and manipulated by the republican politicians. The dems are manipulating their voters too, but not in the non-compassionate way the neo-cons are. The European clients I deal with or fly to meet with are very worried about us right now and they believe neo-cons are nothing more than gun loving, woman hating, racist, homophobic, backward thinking cavemen without any intelligence. Again, that is not my opinion, it is how they voice their concerns to me when speaking of politics in the US. They deeply fear neo-cons...and at this point, I cannot blame them."

,gnosis2,2012-07-05T12:13Z,"I had to have a good chuckle when I read the comments here. I am not a democrat or republican, conservative or liberal. I am a scientist (neuroscience by training) and I think. 

It seems like a lot of republicans are in denial about the science of why conservatives deny science. ;-) 

I have not read this book yet and may not because I generally read the primary scientific literature not popularizations of it. Nevertheless, it is very clear that there are cognitive and emotional differences between conservatives and liberals. 

There is no doubt that conservatives are more vigilant against threats. More sensitive to nonconformity. Better at maintaining social coherence and stability. Are more decisive.

Nevertheless, liberals are better at at handling new and ambiguous information. Creative innovation. Setting aside prejudices and looking at the facts.

It is not a coincidence that most captains of established industries, accountants, soldiers, policemen, fundamentalist religious figures and blue collars workers are conservatives. Our society would fall apart without them.

It is not a coincidence that most innovative entrepreneurs like Jobs, Gates and Soros. Artists. Revolutionaries and reformers. Scientists and Teachers tend to be liberals, nor that liberals thrive in universities and other forums where innovation is the norm. Without liberals society would stagnate and would eventually crash when it encounter something new and important.

Anyone who thinks we don't need both types of people are blinkered fools. 

As far as the republican war on science goes, I noticed it as far back as the 1970's and it predates that. It is a natural consequence of a conservative mindset that dislikes ideas that upset the status quo or contain ambiguity. 

There was strong political opposition to the science of the dangers of tobacco, asbestos, radiation and DDT, science that indicated that challenged traditional child rearing practices and the treatment of criminals. The republican rejected the idea that nuclear war was unwinnable or the infeasibility of an orbital satellite defense shield. They denied acid rain and ozone depletion.

By the time the Bush administration rolled around this denial was routine policy. Most notable was the active censorship and suppression of climate research. Textbooks were tampered with across the country to alter or deny scientific findings with regard to human reproductive biology/psychology and evolution. 

Conservatives tend to do bad science in the same sense that liberals tend to make bad foot soldiers and guards. They have the wrong mindset to cope with it. 

If you are a conservative and want to prove me wrong, go ahead and read the science around this issue with an open mind.

BTW libertarians don't properly fit on the conservative liberal spectrum. "
