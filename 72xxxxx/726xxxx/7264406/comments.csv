,Fritz.,2012-05-13T21:04Z,"@mylegacy , some people have data limits... 

i also really doubt anyone who is going to rage out on the pirate bay forums runs their own business.

selling your blood and semen is not a business btw."
,michaelmotes,2012-05-14T00:22Z,"The beginning of this torrent is awesome. At first, I thought it was the guy that made this cam getting busted, then I was like, no it's just the guy that made this cam making a mockery of the anti-freedom of information gestapo."

Good quality for a cam. Thanks, Mantesh!"
,Fritz.,2012-05-14T03:09Z,"its decent enough to watch, but i would recommend using VLC player and opening the built in equalizer to adjust the sound otherwise it sounds pretty awful."

,darthkostas,2012-05-29T15:27Z,you asshole @takisant you have to pay in this site in order to download
,spyder5555,2012-06-17T19:39Z,"V/8
A/3

you can kinda hear what is being said but it sounds like the audio was recorded in the background though you can hear every movement the person recording makes just fine.
its watchable...if, you can get used to the audio. video is just fine if its a lil dark just up the screen brightness and tweak the contrast."
,torones,2012-06-18T05:22Z,This thing of pasword socks. Don't download!!!
