DESCRIPTION:

Peter Taylor reveals how adopting a more focused approach to life, projects and work can make you twice as productive. 
The lazy project manager illustrates how anyone can apply the simple techniques of lazy project management in their own activities in order to work 
more effectively and consequently improve work-life balance. This 'productive laziness' approach builds on the Pareto principle that states that for 
many phenomena, 80 per cent of consequences stem from 20 per cent of the causes. To put it simply, only 20 per cent of the things people do during 
their working days really matter. Inside this insightful and informative book you'll discover: * The intelligence of laziness - why smart, lazy people have 
the edge over others; * Why the Jungle Book's 'Bare Necessities' should be the productive lazy theme tune; * How to get the maximum output for a 
minimised input; * Quick tips to productive lazy heaven. Everyone wants to achieve more without chaining themselves to their desk. 
By concentrating your project management and learning to exercise effort where it really matters, you can learn to work smarter. 
Welcome to the home of 'productive laziness'.
