,macomaniac,2012-05-11T16:44Z,"Once downloaded, the .dmg file cannot be mounted. I downloaded the file twice, and twice got the same answer : 'impossible to open CrossOver & CrossOver Games disk-image', reason : 'not recognized'."
,btckfc,2012-05-11T17:57Z,"This is the release by The One Byte Wonder
CrossOver 10.1.1 and
CrossOver Games 10.1.2"
,sammetje12,2012-05-12T08:13Z,"@btckfc  

 yeah i know this is not my own work!

"
,sammetje12,2012-05-12T08:14Z,"@macomaniac ehm... try to change the dmg into zip,rar or iso or something"
,macomaniac,2012-05-12T12:27Z,"The extension .dmg shown by the file once downloaded is incorrect, indeed. One has to convert it to .rar, in order to be able to open the file.

Now, when done, I find, as said by btckfc, that the two CrossOver apps inside the folder are 'CrossOver 10.1.1' and 'CrossOver Games 10.1.2'. Two apps already proposed by the following and well seeded torrent, I used some times ago to install CrossOver on my computer : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6635602/CrossOver_Pro__amp__Games_%5BNyaTaku%5D_OSX_Lion_Compatible

Hence the obvious question : what's the utility of this dupe, the only originality of which being to bear a wrong extension?"
