Maria (Halina Reijn) and Jacob (Jacob Derwig) are abandoned by their father, a grumpy old man, in the nearby forest with nothing else but a short note announcing that they have to find their uncle who now lives in Spain. Quickly realizing that they are no longer needed Maria and Jacob embark on a journey to sunny Spain leaving behind grey and unfriendly Holland. During their trip they will encounter an aggressive and very horny middle-aged housewife, an abandoned Spanish village with a friendly donkey, and a desperate doctor looking for a kidney donor. With other words Grimm offers all the necessary ingredients for an engaging and utterly sophisticated story.
