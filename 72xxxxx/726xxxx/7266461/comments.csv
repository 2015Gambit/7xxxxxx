I'm about to run out of my download allotment for the month (am on 99%) so will have to wait for2 and a half days before I can download these.. but will seed when I do.. it's the least I can do!

Thanks again - so much - it really is very kind of you to do this. 

And btw, have you seen this season before or is this your first viewing of it as well? Are you loving it too!?

Cheers!"
[T],Snowhiter,2012-05-13T21:23Z,@ Fangular - This is my first viewing of The Bridge and think its a great series - Next week for the final 2 episodes - should be good ;)
[T],Snowhiter,2012-05-13T22:21Z,"@EdwardEdward - I'm afraid that I just didn't feel  'Those that Kill' was worthy of my time editing and converting - a different story each week just isn't my thing - I much prefer series' like Forbrydelsen, Borgen, Spiral and Braquo that build over the course of the season. I could upload all the shows mentioned above as I originally put them on BTJunkie but hey - there are many decent versions already here.

Thanx for your comments guys - its appreciated

Am just downloading 7 and 8 now, so I have these episodes to look forward to first.

(Btw, I loved Borgen and the Forbrydelsen series too.. so much fun! Can't wait for the second series of Borgen to screen on the BBC so episodes with subtitles will become available..)"
