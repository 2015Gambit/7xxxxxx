CSI New York (Crime Scene Investigation: New York) is an American police procedural television series.

A spin-off from CSI: Miami, the third edition to the CSI franchise follows a New York City forensics team/police officers headed by tough former Marine Major, Det. Mac Taylor, and his newest partner, Det. Jo Danville, an experienced investigator from Washington, D.C., whose work is driven by her empathy for the victim. Against a backdrop of simmering ethnic and cultural tensions, Taylor probes cases similar to their Las Vegas and Miami counterparts, along with his team of CSIs, consisting of Det. Danny Messer, Det. Lindsay Messer, and Dr. Sheldon Hawkes. The CSIs work alongside Medical Examiner Sid Hammerback, lab technician Adam Ross, and hardcore homicide Det. Don Flack. Former team members include the late Det. Aiden Burn; Mac's former second-in-command, Det. Stella Bonasera; and the late homicide Det. Jessica Angell, who was Flack's girlfriend.
