Synopsis
Kaiji (Tatsuya Fujiwara) erased all of his debts by successfully navigating through death-defying games one after the other. A year later though, he's back in the same debt ridden situation. Kaiji then gets a chance to clear himself of his 200 mllion Yen debt, but he has only 2 weeks.

Kaji then decides to take on the mother of all pachinko machines named "The Swamp". The top winning payout is over 1 billion Yen. "The Swamp" is controlled by an illegal casino operation named Teai. Meanwhile, Seiya Ichizo (Yusuke Iseya), controls the machine from a remote location to ensure the machine never pays out the jackpot . Kaiji recruits the help of Yumi Ishida (Yuriko Yoshitaka) whose father was killed by Teai, Kotaro Sakazaki (Katsuhisa Namase) a fired employee of Teai and Yukio Tonegawa (Teruyuki Kagawa) who lost his position at the hands of Teai. They all join Kaiji to take down "The Swamp," but their lives are at stake ...
