[T],NoggintheNomad,2012-05-11T21:32Z,"Smashing upload, many thanks. By the way, with Illustrator, as well as the opening splash, you can get rid of the 'tryout' on the 'about' panel as well, in a similar way in contents/resources. Very nice work, aces!"
,acesandeights,2012-05-11T21:50Z,"Thank NoggintheNomad, yeah i did the other credits screen as well, just a note to say updates work fine but think you have to patch the amtlib.framworks file after any future update"
,Sighters,2012-05-12T01:33Z,"Thanks this kicks ass, but what about the ability to use camera raw? It tells you that you need to open in another app?"

,AardvarkFirefly,2012-05-15T08:16Z,"HELP!  I got an error when running each of the patches:

The action “Copy Finder Items” encountered an error: Check the actionʼs properties and try running the workflow again. [OK]

What is the contingency plan for something like this?

THANKS!"
