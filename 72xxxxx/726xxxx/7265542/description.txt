Porn metatheater reaches new levels of absurdity as director David LordΓÇÖs efforts to shoot a stereotypical slumber party showcasing the considerable natural talents of Bree Olsen are continually frustrated; hilarity ensues. And while insider jokes permeate the witty screenplay, the movie is for the most part accessible for everyone.

DavidΓÇÖs first mistake is attempting to inject a political message into a medium that is essentially sexual. Bree and Penny Flame engage in a heated argument about the virtues (or lack thereof) of Fox News that turns into a wrestling match that we were sure was about to lead into a strap-on grudge fuck, but instead Derrick Pierce shows up as a peacemaker, offering to fuck both of them as a means of bringing them together. Adam & Eve is underwhelmed with the scene ΓÇö they donΓÇÖt want a political tome, they want to see a standard slumber party movie ... and anal.

The slumber party evolves into a slasher movie, with Bree as a knife-wielding serial killer who goes into a rampage. Kayden Kross is the sole survivor, running out of the house and into the arms of Charles Dera. A grateful Kayden fucks his brains out, just before a bloody Bree runs into the room to finish them off. Unfortunately for David, a member of his crew is a real serial killer ΓÇö and heΓÇÖs been practicing his trade on the set, which leads to the movie being confiscated as evidence.

Out of ideas and out of production money, David decides to give the fans what they want to see: A pillow fight that turns into a four-girl orgy that includes an awesome split screen segment that lets you see all the orgasms.
