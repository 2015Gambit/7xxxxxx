*****  CARRIE (1976) *****

Note 1: I'm not entirely happy with this matroska. The source DVD was not even anamorphic, what a bummer. Anywho, there are several audios and subs available for those who want them.

Note 2: Sissy Spaceck (Best actress in a leading role) and Piper Laurie (Best actress in a supporting role) were nominated for Oscar for their performances.

PLOT SUMMARY:

Carrie White is a shy young girl who doesn't make friends easily. After her class mates taunt her about her horrified reaction to her totally unexpected first period one of them takes pity on her and gets Tommy Ross, her boyfriend and class hunk to invite Carrie to the senior prom. Meanwhile another girl who has been banned from the prom for her continued aggressive behaviour is not as forgiving and plans a trick to embarrass Carrie in front of the whole school. What she doesn't realise is that Carrie is ... gifted, and you really don't want to get her angry.
