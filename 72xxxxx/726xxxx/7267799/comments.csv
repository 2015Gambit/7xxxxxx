There are no Avengers prequels, there are Iron man, Hulk, Thor and Captain American movies.
A Prequel is something that comes out after a movie but takes place before said movie.
Educate yourself and you won't look like an idiot.

I won't waste my time on this as nothing like this was ever intended and kind of tarnished that fact that these were STANDALONE movies building up to something."

Enough said - wanted to share my creation. "

There in the same Marvel Universe!!

In Smallville show you saw Green Arrow, Black Canary Flash/Impulse and so on!
Did not mean it was leading up to there own shows....
These are in de DC Universe so they know eathother, like Batman knows everybody!

Its just commensence they do, would you if you where Iron man, not notice a green giant running around the world?
If not, that you would not be a good superhero!

The only real movie who ties into Avengers is the Captain America one, cus of the Cube!

The Rest all Stand Alone...
They reverence the others cus there known, plain and simple.

,nextcut,2012-05-14T12:12Z,To each their own I guess - I enjoy them as stand alone films and together as a part of the big picture of the Marvel Universe. 
,nextcut,2012-05-15T02:58Z,Since this is a big torrent - please be kind enough to seed when you have a complete copy - I won't be able to seed forever.

There is a relation in all of them as they all have references to SHEILD... besides, who doesn't want more material to watch?  I personally am stoked to finish the download so I can watch it with my wife.  Thanks for your hard work... I certainly do appreciate it!"
