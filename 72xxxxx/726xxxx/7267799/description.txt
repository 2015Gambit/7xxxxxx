The ultimate cut of the Avengers prequels. Based on an incredible timeline of the Avenger movies this film was created. The film's goal is to create one cohesive edit of Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America. The movies weave in and out based on its chronological order. The 10 hours of source material was cut down to 5 hours and 45 minutes for this cut. The cut focuses in on the main characters and aims to create something that flows together and feels like it was shot for this purpose. 

Shorter edits may come, but for now here is the chronological story of the Avengers - Phase One - Enjoy!
