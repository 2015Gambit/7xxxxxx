I think a lot of people do not leave comments because most people do not log in, and pirate bay will not let you comment unless you log in. But I am sure everyone is very grateful and blown away by the fantastic sound quality!! If I got to make a request, it would be the song ""Wonderful World"" just because there is a lot going on in that song and it needs to be separated to sound clean, the way your masters do. I'd love to hear the Double Trouble, Roustabout and Clambake soundtracks too! I love the song ""There's So much World To See"", probably because of the strings. It's too bad they cut a verse out ( FTD put it out. )
Anyway, these are awesome! Love them all!! Thank you!!!"
