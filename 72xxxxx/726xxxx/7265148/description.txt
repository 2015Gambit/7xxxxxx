NOTES:
 
This is a proper of the FaF release..And yes, the rule is stupid, but it's still
 there..
 
The rules state: The removal of extras to keep the video untouched is ONLY
 allowed if the release size is at least 4.33 GB. However, if the size is under the
 limit then the release will be nuked for undersized. Therefore, the extras MUST be
 kept and re-encoded to fill the DVD.
 
This is a DVD5 so even if all extras are there size is still below 4.33 GB.
