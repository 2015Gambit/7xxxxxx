,jokeduder,2012-05-26T04:20Z,After weeks of searching for this movie i found it at the dollar theaters one town over.
,jokeduder,2012-05-27T02:41Z,Ok so I went to the theatres and saw this movie today and it was awesome. Even better is that I recorded all the audio using my iPhone! Does the quality suck? Yes. Is it better than any other English audio out there? Yes. I'll take it off my iPhone and try to upload it later tonight. One of you a/v geniuses has to put it with the video.
