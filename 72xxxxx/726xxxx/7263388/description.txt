To ensure that you can get proper playback be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below:

Once installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:

Media Player Classic, Power DVD, or Windows Media Player. 

VLC player doesnt play the video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to a DVD -R disc or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player does.


This is my 17th official 720p H264 AVCHD-SC-SDH release. Enjoy the show wrestling fans. I went to see this show live in person on Tuesday Night May 8, 2012 at the Roanoke Civic Center and I am on camera at different points in the show see if you can figure out who I am in the crowd!!!
