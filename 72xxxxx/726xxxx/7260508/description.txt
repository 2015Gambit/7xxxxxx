Wow! What a step forward Cannibal Corpse has made! Synthed orchestras, accordion, even some female operatic segments thrown in! This is clearly the dawn of a new era for this band, reinventing themselves into something far more intricate, dynamic and delicate than we've seen from them - or metal in general - for ages.

I'm just fucking with you. This is Cannibal Corpse being Cannibal Corpse. Reviewing a Cannibal Corpse album seems so asinine by this point I needed to give you folks some reason to read on. These guys are basically the Mot√∂rhead of death metal; the overall quality may fluctuate from album to album, but not for lack of consistency. When you buy a Cannibal Corpse album, good or bad, you are going to get a set of frantic death metal beatings. 

The only thing that feels different this time around is the more linear approach in the song writing. The simple album title and the less-clever-than-usual song titles reflect the nature of Torture. The sharp tempo shifts and more technical riffs don't seem to be as frequent as their other recent works. While that makes Torture a slightly more accessible Cannibal Corpse album, it serves to give it a more natural, visceral feel.

This entire review is completely useless, though. If you are familiar with Cannibal Corpse, you already have a pretty good idea of what this is going to sound like. If for whateverfuckingreason you've just heard of them today...Well, I suppose Torture ain't a bad place to start.
