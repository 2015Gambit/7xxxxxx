What if, instead of Jesus having his normal disciples (Peter etc,) he was instead saddled with all the Republican Party candidates for President?  What if they put him in a toxic waste dump, unleashing an undead scourge?  
This satirical short story takes a humourous look at these 'special' people and what would have happened if they really did meet Jesus.  You won't think of American Politics in the same way after reading this story.  

NOTES: I believe this is the first story to use the word 'santorum' as it was always intended.  
I will also consider putting up a proper epub version for iPads (instead of this pdf file) if there's any interest.  

This story is being put up for free with no strings attached, because I honestly didn't think anyone would pay for it.  
Enjoy.
