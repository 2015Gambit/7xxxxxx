,Luc1dity,2012-05-29T01:25Z,"I was having problems getting Encore to actually open at first.
I used a patch from another torrent combined with Radio Silence to keep them quiet.
If you try that combined with this, you may get a spinning circle of death. Instead, do this:

1. Use the Host File Patch from this torrent:

2. Unblock them all from Little Snitch or Radio Silence

3. Viola!"

,Dr1ver_X,2012-06-03T22:12Z,"@NastyCircus:
Are you saying there's a way to update cs6 programs with cs5 installed? How do you do that?"
