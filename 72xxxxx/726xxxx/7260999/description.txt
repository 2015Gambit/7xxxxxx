DESCRIPTION:

This text bridges the gap between traditional and reform approaches to algebra encouraging students to see mathematics in context. 
It presents fewer topics in greater depth, prioritizing data analysis as a foundation for mathematical modeling, and emphasizing the verbal, numerical, 
graphical and symbolic representations of mathematical concepts as well as connecting mathematics to real life situations drawn from the students' majors.
