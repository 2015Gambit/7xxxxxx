NOTES:
 
OK sources used ,video was the chinese rip thats been doing the rounds....yes the rmvb file one.
 Video was nice,seemed too have some slight framerate issue,had chinese subs @ 12min mark where you really need
 english ...only last a few lines.
 There is a hardcoded watermark in the bottom left corner aswell......the video Q itself is pretty good,but needed
 some lovin.
 Audio ...well had 3 too choose from,but this seemed the best out of them.Does have some laughter here and there and
 does contain audio for the AFTER credit scene.
 
Video.....right used alot of filters from smoothers,too sharpness,brightness,contrast,rgb eq....
 Also blurred the watermark in the bottom left aswell.Messed with the framerate a touch aswell via a script,still not
 100% right but can only do so much.
 Auido ....well first off was it was a case of syncing it....do the normal of shrinking.stretching ,but came across a few issues..
 in two parts there is some video missing ....7.2 first time round and then 8.4 secs later on,so had too make a few cuts and change
 the offsets,but seems all good now
