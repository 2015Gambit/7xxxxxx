I wonder if there was a solutions book, just as there is one for Dondo Modern French Course. I wonder also if you have preserved any math books. You are doing a very great service."

There is no solutions book for this series.
I do have Dondo Modern French & its key, but the book is 550 pages!
Too long to scan."
