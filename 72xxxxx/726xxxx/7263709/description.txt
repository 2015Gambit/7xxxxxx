I studied French as my third language for 5 years in high school.
I have preserved all my French books of that era of late 70s & early 80s.
In this torrent, I am sharing with you my first two French textbooks.
These beautifully illustrated MacMillan books are a pleasure to study!
They were published in 1976-78 and are not in very good shape. But I have cleaned up most of the images.
First part of this revised French course for schools is "Point de DÃ©part" which is for beginners.
The second part "En Avant" is for the advanced students.
I have OCRed both books in English & French and added bookmarks too.
Please comment after you go through them.
