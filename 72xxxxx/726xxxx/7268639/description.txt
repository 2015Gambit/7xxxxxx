Greatest Hits (2008)




Led by the obnoxious and proud Jimmy Pop, Bloodhound Gang are an alternative rock band out of King of Prussia, PA, who rose to fame in the late '90s thanks to lyrics filled with sexual innuendo and sophomoric humor. Formed by Pop and friend Daddy Long Legs in 1992, the group was first called Bang Chamber 8 before they lifted the name Bloodhound Gang from the '70s children's public television show 3-2-1 Contact. Calling Howard Stern a key influence, Pop designed the band to "hurt everyone's feelings; it makes us feel better about ourselves." Naming one of the group's early demo tapes The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack to Hitler's Handicapped Helpers proved they meant it, but the Universal-associated label Cheese Factory Records shared the Gang's sense of humor and released their debut EP, Dingleberry Haze, in 1994.
