,catflusher,2012-05-13T09:12Z,"Sorry, but linking to a site that just says the movie with the same name has been released is NOT proof that your files are real."
,BLOVES,2012-05-13T11:47Z,"I'm ain't arguing any more .

If you want download or please let this alone."
,umirin,2012-05-13T19:06Z,wasnt 300 dvd leakd before the movie hit theaters?
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-05-13T20:29Z,"I confirm it, it's not a fake at all, great quality too. Only thing is that the movie isn't so good, poorly executed the few action scenes, watching a random video on You Tube would be more entertaining."
,BLOVES,2012-05-14T03:34Z,Thanks for the conformation.
,Rumikosan,2012-05-14T13:13Z,"Doubt this is High-Res according to it's release date. That's ONE of the reasons why I doubt this and also want you to know this is HIGH-RES category, dumbfuck.
Also, to make this more trustworthy,- why not put some pic examples?
And PEOPLE PLEASE,- What's with all the freggin' downloading and seeding without ANY commenting?
Fucking stupid.

Although, i still thank you, BLOVES for this release. Good upload, not TOO bad movie and good sound.
Movie: 4
Audio: 8
Quality: 5 (because it's the freggin' WRONG category)"
,Rumikosan,2012-05-14T13:14Z,I doubted*

,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-05-14T16:10Z,"@Rumikosan

Dude, seriously? You know the difference between a potato and a banana right? High-res = High resolution, this is 1280x720 and for that it's in the right section, if it was 700x350 or something it should have been uploaded in the standard movie section, therefore your argument is not valid. "
,oldtimer48,2012-06-06T06:30Z,"A/10, V/10, definitely high resolution, great copy, thank you BLOVES, and to those who criticise without cause, may your chooks stop laying."
,jaxSL,2012-06-24T22:21Z,"quality of this upload is good. but this is piece of shit  movie i ever watched. you like to waste your time and 1.95Gb  bandwidth, then download this shit... this is a joke f***ing movie... ;("
