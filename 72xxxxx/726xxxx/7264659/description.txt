Synopsis
The worst is yet to come.
In 1942 an elite fighting unit was formed, officially named the First Special Service Force. They were made up of mountain men, hunters and all-around misfits, and were trained to scale cliffs, jump out of airplanes, and kill Nazis. The following summer, days before the invasion of Sicily, the best of these men were handpicked for a desperate mission. Amidst the bloodshed of World War II, these men went armed for combat, and the only way out was to aim, fire and stay alive.
