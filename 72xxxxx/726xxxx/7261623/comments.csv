Make sure the content is compatible with Bryce , you installed in your content folder (Presets) with the materials,skyes,textures,objects and make sure  when you use Bryce to see the content (might need to be imported by hand)"
,Asymov,2012-06-08T18:54Z,"I have a few Qs:

Q1:  When downloading, I can view other people downloading at fast speeds (at least it appears to be fast [a high speed appears under 'peer download' in some users])--or am I reading uTorrent incorrectly?  Can you advise me on how to obtain such speeds?

Q2:  In regards to seeding, the torrent stops seeding shortly after I have obtained it (though I have set uTorrent to seed until I manually decide to stop the process).  What am I doing incorrectly?

Q3:  I have comcast for my ISP (it's the only really fast ISP offered where I live), and they are ruthless when it comes to seeding (they throttle my connection to near dial-up if I attempt to seed anything above 11kbs)--if you know of any way I can defeat this reaction, please advise.  (I've looked all over the internet, to no avail.)

Thank You."

Q1 : srry im not so ""professional"" on using torrents and i really don't know how to set utorent for higher speed.You might need to google it and read some forums if you have some time to spare.Compared to let's say 2010 now torrentz are much faster i guess due to better internet equipment. I let the speed as default, tweaking for higher speed may require advanced knowledges to set the Advanced options.Yes , all i know has something to do with the ""Advanced"" menu from preferences.
Q2:The auto stopping of seeding is due to the almost ""no requests"" (from local area too) to download this torent.It's a 3d application not a popular movie:).I think :)
Q3: About the ISP speed ; it's ok no need to charge your internet bill to high for a torrent which doesn't have to many requests.Maybe leave it as default, stop seed and try again in few days again and see whats happening.I have  a 1 year old torrent and sometimes i get requests but sometimes its just ""seeding"" without a speed..:)- means there are no requests.The torrent wont die..yet  :),it just have very few requests sometimes.Also bryce 7 pro now it's free on official website but nobody knows for how long.I appreciate this, try again to seed in a few days,at your normal low speed ,if still nothing then ignore it, i don't want to cause you troubles;).Meanwhile enjoy Bryce"
