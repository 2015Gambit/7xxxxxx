Hello Everyone,

Here is another MKV -> AVI conversion I just did.

As with the previous uploads I have done, this was converted using the Sothink Video Converter.  The only advert for the software appears in the bottom right corner of the screen and only appears every so many minutes.  Most of the time I don't even notice it when I watch my conversion.

This episode is about creating an ancient computer that displays the locations of the planets.

Enjoy.
