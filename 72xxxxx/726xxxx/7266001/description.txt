[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

Politicians spend and regulate. They have us on what F.A. Hayek called "the road to serfdom."

Tonight Congressman John Mica shows us office buildings in Washington that sit empty. The White House even put up an interactive map of excess properties across the country. You can view it here.

In Tombstone, Arizona, after a storm knocked out the water supply, the feds told the locals, "you can repair the damage only if you use horses and hand tools." Darcy Olsen of the Goldwater Institute will explain.

Dr. Lee Hieb tells us how President Obama's "greatest legislative achievement" affects our path on the road serfdom.

Fortunately, one part of America recently got off the road to serfdom--Puerto Rico. Luis Fortuno, Puerto Rico's Governor, will explain how he reduced Puerto Rico's deficit by 90%.
