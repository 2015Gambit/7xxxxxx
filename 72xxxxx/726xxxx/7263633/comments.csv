[V],80zforever,2012-05-17T20:24Z,welcome guys. glad you'd like it.
,robssbmw,2012-05-18T00:24Z,Can't say that a single artist looks familiar. Should be good to hear some new tracks. Thanks
,r.trifun,2012-05-20T02:53Z,"Wow, how many extreme rarities. Subtle Hints are such an underrated Canadian band, I never knew what city they are from. 
What a great ballad by RPM, from their eponymous first from 1982. You've uploaded their second album from 1984. I think that        their first album should be worth uploading, so if you come by...
Thank you for the music once again.
Cheers."
,ishti,2012-05-21T17:14Z,hey bro plzzzzzzz upload rare hits of the 80s vol. 37
,ishti,2012-05-21T17:17Z,"Bro, do you have some rare unreleased songs of Morten Harket(of A-ha) ?? the songs are girl, a place i know, sound of rain. And some singles of Nick Van Eede(of Cutting Crew) the songs are hold on to your heart,
rock n roll fool, all or nothing, ounce of sense, i only want to be # 1 & dicing.. If you have plzzz upload these songs..."
,grantcool,2012-06-09T14:37Z,Great collections. Can you repost Vol 24? Mine is missing songs. Thanx
,brianscottmatthew,2012-07-04T04:46Z,"Terrific collection once again, i've never heard this B-Movie track, such a criminally underrated band. As per a previous conversation concerning the David Freeman (of Lover Speaks) solo albums, I found a user on discogs that owns all of them, however he refused to share any of them. He told me he paid way too much money for them to be sharing them... how sad. Would you happen to have any John Bottomley albums?"
[V],80zforever,2012-07-18T09:04Z,Anyone interested in vol. 57?
,r.trifun,2012-07-19T15:28Z,"Well, of course, 80z. I speak for myself, but I think that we all would be interested in vol. 57 and 58 etc.
Thanks for your efforts once again.
Cheers."
,fanciz,2012-07-22T17:49Z,"Ha ha What a question? Everybody here is delighted with your postings. I guess some of us are busy with projects or CD hunting that is time consuming haha Had to get Eleven Pond from Russia coz it was quite expensive on Amaz...Might get B-F-G soon etc
Btw Did U already post The Red Temple Spirits. Got interested in this band years ago, then forgot about it hahaha"
,zenith2134,2012-08-01T02:54Z,"Hello, 80zforever, I was formerly 'z-nith' but my accound was removed for some reason.
Anyway, another superb torrent. Thanks again. About a week ago I uncovered a treasure trove of unopened LPs including Jon St. James-Trans Atlantic, almost every Fixx album, the Bolshoi 12"" singles, Boom Boom mancini, etc etc. I immediately thought of these torrents. Such amazing music. "
,svenbanan74,2012-08-12T12:25Z,"Thanks 80zforever for all the good stuff you share. Lot's of memories. I've been looking for a song from the mid-eighties with the line ""Night train to London"" in it. I'm not sure thats the title of the track though. And I have no idea what the artist/band is... "
,dragonbandit314,2012-08-12T14:53Z,"Would we like a new volume from you???
Hell Yeah!!!
It has taken me weeks to get past the database error to answer that question
Again, YES please.
Be well.
One of your biggest fans. T."
[V],80zforever,2012-08-19T02:34Z,Alright folks! stay tuned.
