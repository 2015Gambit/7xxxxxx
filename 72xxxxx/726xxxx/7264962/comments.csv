What media player are you using cos it plays fine for me in both VLC and media player classic

And the 1st TV rip I released had a glitch in it where the signal was lost for a second about 3/4 of the way through hence the proper"

i know 1st rip has glitches but smooth playback, this proper has no glitches but has jerky playback"
,YominCarr195,2012-05-13T22:34Z,The Signal glitch is forgiveable. The episode was all there.
