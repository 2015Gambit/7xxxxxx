38 12 "Tunnel Vision" TBA TBA May 5, 2012 212 

Upon discovering the locations of four relics from the Vaults of Iacon, the Autobots split up and travel to each location simultaneously to retrieve each relic. Arcee, Bumblebee, Jack and Miko head to New York City to find the first relic, which is buried somewhere deep in the city's underground subway tunnels. During their search, however, they are attacked by Knock Out and an Insecticon, who are also looking for the relic.
