KINGS OF THE CITY blend blues rock n roll, hip hop and grime like no other. With ages ranging from 16-24 and eclectic musical tastes, matched only by their diverse cultural and social backgrounds, the bands unique sound was almost an inevitability.

The London-based collective consists of members Ali Bla Bla (rapper / producer), KoKen (rapper), Danny Wilder (lead singer / guitars / rapper), Rich Pun (guitars), Memari Man (bass), 8 Bit (synths / co-producer) and Royal (drums).

The Kings have been busy tearing down venues across the capital, headlining hotspots such as the Jazz Cafe and Cargo. Recent shows have taken their high-octane, crowd-pleasing antics across the country, steadily garnering them a large and loyal following along the way.

They recently supported Maverick Sabre on his debut nationwide tour after a releasing a series of covers on SB.TV.

Driven by a shared love of music that pushes the envelope, KINGS OF THE CITY are regularly recording new material and releasing videos.

Look out for their next double EP 'No Guts No Glory' in Summer 2012...
