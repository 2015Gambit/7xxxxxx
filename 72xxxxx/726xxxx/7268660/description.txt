Bikhre toote tukde saare jud rahe hain dheere dheere
Haule hauley ...
Betuke se sur woh saare mill rahe hai dheere dheere
Haule Haule...
Aaine ka dhundhla chehra khil raha hai dheere dheere
Haule Haule...

Scattered broken pieces are all getting joined back, 
Slowly, slowly
All those incoherent notes(music) are now becoming meaninful
Slowly, slowly
The hazy face on the mirror is blooming/playing(beginning to smile), 
Slowly, slowly


Nanhi si ik jaan ne apna bachpan khoya
Khauf ki maili chaadar odh ke soya
Bebas akela, Bezubaan chupchaap roya
Barso se ye behte aansu tham rahe hain dheere dheere
Haule Haule...
Khul rahi aankhein jo ab tak num rahi hai dheere dheere
Haule Haule...

A little innocent life has lost its childhood,
It slept covered with the dirty sheet of fear
helpless, alone, mute, it wept in silence
Tears that were running for years are stopping, 
Slowly, slowly,
The moist eyes which were closed till now are opening,
Slowly, slowly.


Aaine ka dhundhla chehra khil raha hai dheere dheere
Haule Haule...

The hazy reflection of the face on the mirror is blooming/playing(beginning to smile), 
Slowly, slowly


Chura ke khud se aankhein main har pal jiya
Zeher jo usne ghola maine woh piya
Chuppi ke aad mein chhipkar usne jurm kiya
Zubaan par laga woh taala khul raha hai dheere
Haule Haule...
Meri nahi koi khata, ye pata chala hai dheere
Haule Haule..

I lived in disregard of myself always,
I drank the poison he dissolved (in my childhood)
Hiding in the cover of silence, he committed a crime
That lock put on the tongue, is opening, 
Slowly, slowly
I am getting to know that there was no fault of mine(whatever happened to him) 
Slowly, slowly
