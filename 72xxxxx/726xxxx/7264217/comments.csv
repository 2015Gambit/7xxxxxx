,irmitarosa,2012-05-13T04:25Z,"works fine but as with the other versions that I downloaded first, I keep on receiving the warning pop up from Avast that this is an illegal copy. But tks anyway..."
,KOLAVERI,2012-05-13T05:44Z,"@irmitarosa : Yo are welcome man... :) dunno how to prevent that popup from coming...

Try this... Open Avast Interface -> Settings -> Cloud Services -> Un Check Both Reputation Services and Streaming Updates and click Ok. 

It may work... :)"
,KOLAVERI,2012-05-13T07:49Z,@irmitarosa : Try uninstalling the current one in your system. Download a fresh version from avast homesite and install as trail and then switch off the net connection and follow all the above steps for cracking... :) it should prevent the popup from coming... :)
,wulf579riker1,2012-05-13T07:58Z,"The crack by ZeNiX has been successfully detected by avast...You will continuie to get the warning about the illegal copy no matter what you do. They have integrated it into the virus definifitions download, so you can't stop it. Have to wait for another workable crack or suffer through the message."

,djwenz08,2012-05-28T08:36Z,why it doesn't work on me..i followed the instruction..
,Johnny5PR,2012-05-30T04:34Z,"To stop the warning issue:
Open the firewall, go to the application rules section and block all connections of avast antivirus.  Then, open community tab in the settings menu and uncheck all.
Hope it works for you like it does for me..."
,brandon_123,2012-05-30T19:47Z,"

They guy named Johnny5PR is absolutely correct! if you follow his instruction you will get rid of the ILLEGAL COPY pop up.

""Open the firewall, go to the application rules section and block all connections of avast antivirus. Then, open community tab in the settings menu and uncheck all."" Thanks Johnny!"
,yoncenator,2012-05-30T19:55Z,If you block all internet connections then you can't get any virus updates.  Real bright.
,Johnny5PR,2012-05-31T15:31Z,"@yoncenator:  At least someone (brandon_123) was ""real bright"" enough following a simple instruction that STILL gets its virus updates without the warning popup... Hope our ""brightness"" help you or you will be ""brighter"" to find another solution..."
,gubbin64,2012-06-01T03:52Z,"Hey KOLAVERI, thanks for the ul, but after rebooting, and selelcting ""insert licence file"" , the program wants me to browse to an area on my computer for a file......any ideas, or am I just missing something?"
,KOLAVERI,2012-06-01T09:06Z,"@gubbin64 : Yo dont need to insert any license file after rebooting.

Just check your Subscription info whether it has got till 2050 ok :)

Cheers :)"
,KOLAVERI,2012-06-01T09:09Z,@Johnny5PR : hope your tip works for everybody :)  Cheers mate :)
,Johnny5PR,2012-06-01T14:22Z,"@KOLAVERI: Although I wasn't download the crack from you, thanks for the upload. More than a week after the tweak and still receiving the updates without the warning popup, so it appears to be working. Doesn't hurt to try it, so pass the word if you like... Caribbean cheers from Puerto Rico! :-)"
,vithchea,2012-06-05T07:41Z,pop up can't be stop but it seem everything is ok....they not shut yr update so don't worry
,sniperboss86,2012-06-09T16:32Z,"works perfect on my win7 32bit thanks!
I found this on YouTube about the popup issue and it works fine, virus definitions updates still works automatically!
Open your Avast Interface. => Firewall => AVAST Software => avast! Antivirusďťż => Packet Rules => Then you will see two rules, change their action to ""BLOCK"", also make an inboundďťż and outbound rule in windows 7 firewall and block avastUI.exe, that resolves the problem."
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-12T06:22Z,This does work and if you block avastUI with firewall you will still get daily updates without the pop ups. I also unchecked Cloud Services and Community. Thanks dude!
,SerSpec-V,2012-07-17T20:26Z,"UPDATE; No longer working, Avast saying that my subscription is expired and I will not receive definition updates. Even though my subscription still says active and valid to 2050. I guess they busted the crack.  "
,nag1649,2012-07-19T06:16Z,"My Avast Internet Security 7.01 unable to load at System START UP time, am manually opening at every restart.. Please someone help me how can i enable avast at start-up ?
