A haunting portrait of depression, suicide, and the occult, "Giles Corey" contains some of the most disturbing, beautiful, and poignant sounds of 2011. Released in conjunction with a 150 page book, this record and it were meant to be experienced concurrently. When done so, this album goes from depressing to devastating, and from frightening to terrifying. "Giles Corey" is an incredible, incredible release from Dan Barrett, of Have A Nice Life.

The album contains everything from spirit recordings and "spectral choirs", to slow, beautiful acoustic love songs, to a recording of the musician himself wearing a "Voor's Head Device" nearly suffocating as he's slamming his hands on his piano, screaming in terror.
