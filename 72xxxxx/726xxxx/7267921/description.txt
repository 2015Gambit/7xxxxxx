Gene Vincent - Born to Be a Rollin' Stone: The Challenge Sessions 1966-1968 [2008] [Anthology]

Original Release / Rev-Ola / CR REV 266 / CD

Gene Vincent had already been Europe's top Rock ΓÇÿnΓÇÖ Roll legend for some years. In the US however, he was seen as very much yesterday's man. Escaping the clutches of his notorious manager Don Arden, Gene made tracks to Hollywood into the open arms of 4 Star Records and Music, a happening hive of music.

This CD documents their efforts to reinvent Gene as an LA folk/country rocker, with a slew of beautiful songs almost on a par with The Gosdin BrothersΓÇÖ seminal The Sounds Of Goodbye or The International Submarine Band's debut. In great voice and expertly backed by LA session giants such as Glen Campbell and The Champs, and generating hits in ΓÇÿBird DogginΓÇÖΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿBorn To Be A Rollin' StoneΓÇÖ, this collection shows an amazing direction Gene's career could have taken.
