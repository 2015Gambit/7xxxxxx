There's a present from John Cena outside. It's a Corvette, a classic piece of Americana.  He doesn't want them to tint the windows or put a new set of rims on.  He wants them to grab the heaviest thing they can and destroy it. The car he wants the guys to build for him needs the engineering of a Corvette, but the body by the Parker Brothers. It breaks their hearts, but they take an enormous wrench to the thing. John Cena gives them a couple of days to strip it down, then he's coming down to see what they want to do with the machine.
