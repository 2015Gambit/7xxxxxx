,p.aspa,2012-06-02T21:03Z,"When this torrent was posted I had 1Mb DL for few days, and after that it dropped to few Kb to none. Could you guys seed a bit longer, I'm only 2 seasons short.
Btw, really great upload"
,pirateabag,2012-06-04T22:26Z,"you are welcome, guys
i seed 24/7 (25 mbit/s), but the size is big, so... be patient"
,football2801,2012-06-14T16:22Z,"Hey, i'm having a bunch of trouble recently downloading your file. It says there are 0 seeds and i'm only downloading at .5 kbps."
,akumod77,2012-08-05T08:03Z,"Still downloading, reencoding and watching. Reencode back using latest Handbrake to mkv at lower video bitrate @ 1900kbps, audio AAC5.1 @ 384kbps. I get around 370MB file of 22minutes video.

Video is excellent especially the BluRay ones. Audio is pristine DTS codec @ 1.5mbps. If u have audio receiver capable of DTS,AC3(DD) passthru SPDIF via optic cable yeah audio is superb! Mine is Yamaha RX V357. So for 720p video & DTS audio......

Audio = 10
Video = 10"
