[T],DownHD,2012-05-11T18:24Z,thank you bro:)
,Revisionist,2012-05-11T19:14Z,My prediction is 13 gigs (lol) + HDChina is going to = really bad synch. I avoid their rips as a rule. They always have problems.  
,pirateabag,2012-05-11T20:05Z,"never had problems with their rips, maybe it's just a bad player you are using"
,_Muse_,2012-05-12T01:39Z,i hope the quality is great cause the download is slow as shit. downloaded 5 gigs and sent 60. keep seeding
,savvas127,2012-05-12T13:53Z,thanks mate
,mandruf,2012-05-19T01:59Z,PublicHD rips make my explorer crash all the time. I don't recommend. THey must be using some shitty codec.
,Beowulf6666,2012-06-09T02:25Z,atrocious quality...fucking get the rips right or stay the fuck of TPB
