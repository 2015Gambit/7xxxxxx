Valentina is the Wedding Present's ninth full-length album, the third since David Gedge shut down Cinerama and went back to using the WP name. It's also the first time in 12 years Gedge has been without the services of bassist Terry DeCastro; though she did stick around long enough to provide a few backing vocals. Otherwise, longtime fans will be glad to hear that nothing else has changed. Nothing at all! Almost every note, lyric, and sound could have appeared on any Weddoes record of the past 20 years or so without any problem. Lyrically, Gedge is still wrestling with the same relationship issues, sorting through the emotional debris with his usual mix of arch detachment and brutal honesty.
