,rap02,2012-05-11T08:19Z,should this episode release tomorrow and not today? 
,Dramat,2012-05-11T22:43Z,"Thank You VTV !!
Top Quality as always :)

lol, @rap02 IMO no - it usually was released with a day delay. Nikita is broadcasted on Thursdays!"
,Grifeichadam,2012-05-12T08:16Z,Where does it air on Thursdays? IMDB seems to agree with my cable menu listings that it comes on Fridays.
,rap02,2012-05-12T13:41Z,"@Dramat
yeah it usually broadcasts on Friday "
,Dramat,2012-05-12T14:41Z,"I've double checked and U're right - it's usually boradcasted on Friday. In that case i don't know how VTV was able to upload it sooner, buyt i won't complain :)"
,hashuboy,2012-05-13T00:10Z,This series is actually getting pretty boring now all that same thing in mostly every episode!!
,rap02,2012-05-14T10:47Z,"@Dramat
:D

@hashuboy
i agree with you"
,craddle,2012-05-18T08:53Z,"@hashuboy I would agree with you , but you posted that comment on the wrong episode. Since Percy has never threatened the US President before or try to set off nukes. This episode is not the ""same thing."""
,AnimalLeopard,2012-06-18T18:13Z,Thanks!
