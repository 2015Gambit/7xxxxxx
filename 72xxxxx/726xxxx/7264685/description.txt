************


The latest case that Reese and Finch work on will be without Finch for much as he rebuilds his computer and library from the recent threat. The next number the machine dispenses belongs to fourteen year old Darren McGrady. When Reese first investigates, he finds that Darren's older brother and legal guardian, Travis McGrady, was just murdered - shot point blank - and Darren has since escaped from the authorities as they were in the process of transferring him to Child Services. Reese quickly finds Darren, who seems to want to avenge his brother's murder on his own.
