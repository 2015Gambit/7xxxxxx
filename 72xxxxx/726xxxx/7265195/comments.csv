,Felty,2012-05-12T22:35Z,Does anybody know the resolution?
,Slave4UBB,2012-05-12T22:37Z,Hows the quality? 720p?
,korralove,2012-05-12T22:48Z,This one has watermarks..
,JimiPain,2012-05-12T23:04Z,"It's 480 without the black bars, so 720x412. It's not the HD quality you get from the videos on nick.com, but it's way better than the other torrent."
,Felty,2012-05-12T23:07Z,Low resolution.
[T],despo1ler,2012-05-12T23:59Z,"All {C_P} releaases are SD and recorded from SD TV unless it states otherwise in the file name, If we need to use a web dl or web rip or something other than a TV recording to cover for an episode we miss or w/e it is released under the [Oj] tag until we can get a {C_P} copy made.
 I hope that clears things up for you for future reference :)"
