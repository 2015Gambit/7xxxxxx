I know it has already been uploaded, but for those that missed this wonderful piece of nostalgia, this may be a better quality upload,

I mainly upload programs from BBC1/2/4, which will only appeal to a small number of pirates.
 
I do most seeding overnight, so I have no way of knowing how many take downloads.
I have to depend on feedback to know whether I should continue uploading, and whether the quality of the uploads is good enough.
 
So please take a little time to leave some feedback. 
 
And please keep seeding !!
