Plot Summary for
The Bells of St. Mary's (1945)
Father Chuck O'Malley is assigned as the pastor of an inner-city Catholic school
and has to work with the dedicated, but stubborn, principal Sister Mary Benedict.
O'Malley and Sister Mary Benedict quarrel frequently and he feels the school 
should be closed and the children sent to a nearby school with modern facilities 
but all of the sisters believe that God will provide for them. Specifically, they put their hopes on Horace P. Bogardus, a businessman who has built a modern 
building right next door to the school and who they hope will donate his new 
edifice to them.

gamblemad: I uploaded this because Ingrid Bergman (1915ΓÇô1982) was
           amazing in this film.  Without her performance this would not
           have been nominated for the Oscar (my opinion only).
