,Valagard,2012-05-12T16:14Z,"Wayyyyyyyy too many false positives for my taste.

Its like one in every two virus programs flags it on virustotal.com"
,Valagard,2012-05-12T18:21Z,"Yeah if this was just a few crappy antivirus programs flagging this, I wouldn't be concerned.

But tons of the bigboy antivirus's are flagging this, so I'm passing this up.

Why wasn't there just a license file like every other version of DXtory out there? Think about that."
,Valagard,2012-05-13T04:00Z,"Just thought I would write one more comment

Decided to try and run it, figured if it mussed up my system, can always do a format

System is 100% clean after reinstall, so I guess it really was just a ton of false positives

What I DON'T like is it opening IE and connecting me to some website after loading, when you install this, make sure you disconnect from internet before you do"
,badabam,2012-05-18T15:47Z,"Program installs fine, but then fails to run on windows 7 x64. What should I do to make it work? I cannot generate a valid license ID if it isn't done on my current system."
,badabam,2012-05-18T15:59Z,please make it work on win7 64 bit
[V],AUDI-A4,2012-05-20T19:21Z,badabam my windows 7 x64 it works fine for me
,badabam,2012-05-21T17:15Z,"Please take a look at these - it's partially in polish, but hopefully intelligible:

I ran it in sandboxie on w7, so I thought maybe that was causing the error, but it worked fine when I had tried the same thing on xp. The licreg returns an error on w7 x64. System is up-to-date as it says in the error log."
,luminatx,2012-05-26T23:32Z,"Does not work for Win7 64bit.
I followed instructions, and when I go to run the program, nothing happens.

I get the circle like something is going to load, but nothing loads.

wouldn't be surprised if this is just a virus.
(STAY AWAY FROM MY PORN!)"
,appie_01,2012-05-28T00:27Z,"I've got a win7 64x and it works. Also, make sure to  disconnect from the internet. You never know."
,SLeePYG74,2012-05-30T00:38Z,"Thank you for this. The installation instructions work, and everything came clean with the latest database for Malwarebytes (as of today). I'm also using Windows 7 Ultimate x64 SP1, fully updated."

,Valagard,2012-06-02T11:15Z,"@Ineedawork

Don't you understand what a ""False positive"" means?

It means part of its code is similar to other code from trojans etc, most likely its the fact the keygen installer needs to read windows host file identification in order to make the key needed to register the program

https://www.virustotal.com/file/322f698f9f9dbe51baddb73e37b06d9017e8f1d871652d4b00a8b6f383283fb5/analysis/1338628261/

If you notice, hardly any of them match, they all are reporting different virus's/trojan's/malware, where if it was an actual virus etc the result would be pretty much 100% conclusive between all the different antivirus programs, not the miss-match replies virus total is giving"
,Raviex,2012-06-02T21:59Z,"Dude, I can't install the ""dxtory license cracked""
It comes up with an error during the install. "
,iNeedAWorkingUsernameFFS,2012-06-03T00:00Z,"By the way.. Some retard ""repacked"" the actual crack in a Inno Setup installer, which is also what opens internet explorer at the end.

The ""Dxtory License Cracked.exe"" (~1MB) is the retarded and unnecessary extra installer. If you unpack it with ""innounp"" (google), the actual license crack (LicReg_cracked.exe) is just 654KB and won't open internet explorer.

In other words, some faggot repacked this in an oddball installer just to launch IE and redirect to a shitty website (knowledgemasterz).

If you're having problems with the crack, unpack the ""Dxtory License Cracked.exe"" with innounp and try the actual crack, not this stupid installer bullshit"
,Valagard,2012-06-04T04:02Z,"Could you unpack the crack and post it please?

I tried to unpack it with that program, each and every time I got a .ini failure when trying to run the crack by itself"
,iNeedAWorkingUsernameFFS,2012-06-04T11:05Z,"I've uploaded the unpacked crack to bayfiles.
But keep in mind that this one isn't clean either! It gets 33/42 on virustotal. Try it in a VM first or something. This is definitely a fishy torrent/crack.

,Valagard,2012-06-05T18:59Z,"I found the crack is completely clean, like I said it just flags half a billion false positives

Spybot, Malware and Avira found nothing, and nothing in my Hijackthis logs. Its clean just flags a billion false positives"
,Camaleoni,2012-06-12T20:34Z,is it safe? on virustotal.com it showed me 20/42 and most of it were trojan virus..
,Valagard,2012-06-13T04:45Z,"If you can't read the comments on this page, you don't deserve an answer Camaleon"
,Kocayine,2012-06-23T02:56Z,"Hey, AUDI, do you think you can make the crack work for .117? It has some neat new functions."
,Itbankrock,2012-06-30T06:39Z,"Agree, Please make a crack for .117 :3

It would be very nice to have it. I returned to .111 as this lags a bit while recording, even though I have a monster pc, I can use fraps but I hate that."
,OpenWifi,2012-06-30T20:54Z,"This does contain a trojan. Will not pick up on initial scan of compressed arechive.

Trojan is Generic32.BOC (if I remember correctly) along with other shit. "

,Itbankrock,2012-08-04T15:02Z,AUDI-A4 Stalbe build of .117 is out! Please crack it and I will be so much happy! Thanks in advance!
,KoreyCX,2012-08-08T03:24Z,It doesn't work anymore. =/
