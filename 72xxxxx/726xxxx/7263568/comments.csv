[T],Jonzee,2012-06-08T14:16Z,"C'mon ...Walter Matthau, (along with John Carradine), plays the part of a major antagonist in this story. This leads eventually to a great showdown between he & Lancaster. The whip-cracking Matthau against the punch throwing Lancaster! One of the best scenes in the film! "
