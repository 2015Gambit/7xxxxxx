,richperson16,2012-05-11T06:24Z,Images are inside the seasons folders!
,dududus,2012-05-11T07:20Z,"Will get this after I buy a new HDD, thanks!

What source, is it uniform?"
,MirrodinX4,2012-05-11T09:37Z,Source is HDTV I guess since it includes the last episode from yesterday.
,richperson16,2012-05-11T10:22Z,"Im not sure, but i know these are 720p hdtv x264 i believe. Hopefully i was somewhat helpful."
,pirateabag,2012-05-11T23:53Z,"I put a minus because this torrent has no technical information and it's probably fake. Check my torrent, it has tons of extras, the quality of the season rips are superb (WEB-DL and BDRips, so not a TV capture, has subs, has original untouched sound and has no channel logos).
richperson16, you said the episodes in my torrent are too big and it's probably fake, but it's a scene release, the BDRips have DTS audio and video bitrate is around 5000 kbps, if this information's of any help to you. 
Cheers, Office fans!"
,richperson16,2012-05-12T00:10Z,"""PirateBag"" stop spamming. And why would you put false flags. Try it before you talk because even if this torrent has no info, it is real and all the episodes do work.

It is .mkv format for most episodes."
,dududus,2012-05-12T03:53Z,"have put a plus to even out pirateabag's negative

but tech info is useful, there are a lot of free progs that do everything, just have to copy+paste the result"
,pirateabag,2012-05-14T01:00Z,"richperson16, you definitely do not know what ""spamming"" means, and that .mkv is not a format. i'm guessing you're 16 years old, or just you know very little.
my minus was already for your comment in my recently deleted (due to update) torrent concerning the fact some episodes are bigger than 1GB (because of high bitrate and dts sound), so you should think before you write something. better not write at all, in your case.
cheers. sorry for some negative shit, you just got what you deserved"
,pirateabag,2012-05-14T01:03Z,"oh, not just bigger than 1GB, but also that the torrent was fake. forgot to mention that."
,richperson16,2012-05-14T07:49Z,"Hey buddy, .mkv is a format and its called matroshka.

https://www.google.com/search?ix=seb&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=.mkv+format

And this torrent isn't fake, i actually have all the seasons in 720p uploaded so try it before you say something. Good luck with your torrent :)"
,pirateabag,2012-05-14T19:46Z,"it's a container, buddy. thanks for your minus, appreciate that. 
working hard on compiling all the stuff, ripping the dvds and blu-rays, converting the subs and syncing them - doing all that for the Office fans to enjoy this great stuff and hearing, that my torrent is fake. way to go! and what have you done? downloaded some other torrents, sorted into folders, put some f-ing txts (is it even your torrent?) and jpgs and you are the man after that? nope"
,richperson16,2012-05-15T10:30Z,"U mad bro?

Whatever thank you for your torrent, i just don't think it should be that big but if it is, anyways thanks for uploading your thing. I actually worked hard on this torrent and those jpgs are samples, and the readme is if anyone wants to support me for my hard work. I was never hating on your torrent, i just said it might be fake. Chillllll"
,DataHungry,2012-05-22T01:16Z,"Could someone with 100% plz seed, i'm stuck at 55%"
,richperson16,2012-05-22T08:27Z,Yea im seeding sometimes i take a break but im usually uploading! So keep it going it'll get there.
,jbackflip,2012-06-03T15:45Z,"@richperson16

""so try it before you say something. "" - Your own words. So why call someone else fake when you neglected to practice what you preach? 

Learning the difference between a container and a format, sure most people get by bullshitting their way through but learning what they really are is only going to help you as an uploader. 

No hate, but for the love of all fuckery, don't use 'U mad bro?' - You're better than that.

After all that.. ty for the upload lol"
,rainbow_,2012-06-04T09:26Z,"Hey guys, please keep seeding both during and after download. i'm downloading it for 3 days now and only got 1,5% so far. Thx"
,arsenal4lyf,2012-06-06T00:55Z,please seed been going 2 weeks and only at 64%
,RedStash,2012-06-06T06:22Z,"I see a lot of peers at 86.5% ( I am also stuck at that percentage). Me thinks the uploader did not seed to 100%! Don't waste your time, wait until there are more seeds. But, thanks for 86.5% of the episodes!"
,iFROSTBITE,2012-06-21T06:09Z,"tooooo much reading in that conflict my brain hurtz ._. anyway who evaaaa is right congratzzzzz :D if this file is for realzzz.... THANK U BROOOOO! (beast mode- [ON] OFF ) if not,,, ima host boot u offline for 99999999999 years BROOOOOO ;3 "

,richperson16,2012-06-22T06:45Z,currently back up and seeding. Sorry for the wait folks!
,xPyrishx,2012-07-10T01:26Z,"@pirateabag...

my good sir, you are a fool, a scoundrel, and i do believe mentally challenged... flagging someone elses torrent because they took a lot more time to set up a more legit torrent then you? now thats just not nice, especially when you say you need to sync the subs...???? and the audio??? thats why these are in .mkv, for your information,  .mkv is the single and standard file format for both DVD's and Blu-rays, WHICH means these are exact copies of the original Blu-rays, and yes you are slightly correct in saying that .mkv as a file format, is a ""container""... yes these .mkv files CONTAIN audio, AND video, and whatever else may be there... but so are your, how you say, ""less-er"" quality video/audio file formats... you sir are whats wrong with this website and frankly the world because you talk shit, you obviously dont understand, cant back it up, and then when backed into a corner, you just continue to bitch, but hey feel free to challenge my extensive knowledge of file formats. seeing as i not only major in computer sci, but also have over 20 credit hours of digital editing, such as audio and/or video...  "
,xPyrishx,2012-07-10T01:28Z,"@richperson16 

Thanks for the upload! I can NOT wait to get started on the 8th season. Thats really the only one I haven't seen so far lol. +1 for you my good friend!

:D"
,valentino1966,2012-09-09T14:14Z,"thanks for this, but i cant find the ENG subs for this, it says spoken, eng, subs, eng"
,squash34,2012-09-13T21:43Z,"A: 10
V: 10

This is not fake. I expected that it might be upscaled or at least the first couple seasons upscaled.

But I guess every season was also aired in HD? Because this looks beautiful.

Seriously. Good work. Thank you."
,squash34,2012-09-13T21:44Z,"Correction. Not aired. I guess the BluRays were released.

Still I skipped through all the seasons and everything looks so 720p.

Why isn't this uploader a VIP/trusted/etc.?"
,squash34,2012-09-14T06:30Z,"On a more negative note, I'm stuck at 97% complete because the availability shows 0.970.

Zero fucking seeders atm."
,squash34,2012-09-17T23:18Z,"Season 3, Episode 3 Audio is left channel only.

Why is this?"
,squash34,2012-09-17T23:29Z,"Three episodes in season 3: The merger, The convention, The job all have an audio issue where the sound comes only through the left speaker."
