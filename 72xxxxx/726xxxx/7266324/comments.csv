,bladeshrk,2012-05-17T08:17Z,"@D255
Maher is not able to upload via torrent because he has a low bandwidth connection and he doesn't get too much time.

,extracube,2012-05-17T16:49Z,"Folks, if you downloaded and used for several days or weeks and it's working great, please report back here.

Also, does this need the use of a loader?  If so, which one is best?"
,dbeloved,2012-05-17T18:20Z,"Thanks for seeding, it has installed for me, the May 2012 Maherz. Pls how do I activate, 3 days auto-activate."

,kankur,2012-05-20T04:17Z,"thanks for the may version bro...
u full filled my request :)"
,extracube,2012-05-20T11:11Z,"Installed, couple quick notes and q's:

1.  during installation it asked for a serial.  I entered two, but both rejected, so I selected 'skip'.  Also, I unchecked the box ""validate me when I go online.""  Did I do the right thing, or will I get hit later?

2.  I checked the updates, and this version DOES already have the 'malicious' update KB971033.  Am I reading that right?  Should I uninstall it?

So far I haven't used any windows loader."
,roy2646,2012-05-21T18:37Z,"@ extracube, regarding item 1 you have done the right thing and about item 2, the new version of windows loader by daz can by-pass KB971033 without deactivating the OS. I accidentally installed KB971033 last month, not in this version, in my desktop computer and it remains activated up to now, so far so good."
,rubys,2012-05-25T17:03Z,Wow! Great sharing. I installed it and now it works perfectly. I used windows loader for activation. Now it became genuine. Thank you very much
,extracube,2012-05-26T09:37Z,"First,

@roy , thanks for the replies. Reason I was asking is all my previous win7's messed up one way or the other, so was kinda biting my nails, but so far this one is working beautifully.  Yes, I left KB971033 completely installed.  Glad to know I did all the right things.

This comes pre-packaged with important updates up until mid-may. It accepts all updates and installs them fine.

BTW, looks like there's a new installer.  Just search TPB for:
Windows Loader 2.1.3 By Daz

Anyhow it's been about a week for me, and this is working Beautifully.  +1 vote!"
,Lordvicius,2012-05-26T12:29Z,works great! Thanks a lot man. :) activated with win loader.
,duriotic,2012-05-29T16:24Z,"tigerpol:  (or anyone) Is there any chance you can upload TO TORRENT the Maherz 64-bit updated version of Win 7 Ultimate?  The upload sites you mention here or in Maherz site are slow, cumbersome (SO MANY .rar files to dl!!!) and unreliable."
,hpusuario,2012-06-03T22:38Z,"@tigerpol, hi, I have a quick question: I have a windows 7 ultimate in my comp and I get a message saying is not genuine, ...today I downloaded your windows 7 and the referred windows loader  by Daz...my question is: which one should I install first, excuse my ignorance, but I am new to this. 
I appreciate any response, thanks!!!"
,Sirmax12,2012-06-05T10:11Z,"Can u upload  ""Advanced SystemCare with Antivirus 2012(v5,5,2 beta)"" for me?With the serial/keygen.Email me at sparta42@ymail.com if u can.. (^.^)"
,tigerpol,2012-06-05T19:35Z,hpusuario :- latest available now Windows Loader 2.1.4 (Windows Activation Technologies)
,extracube,2012-06-09T09:59Z,"Just another quick note:  I notice that if I make any system changes, such as do a Windows Update, that it reverts the system back to ""trial"".  I have to re-run Windows Loader by Daz to get authenticated again.  Is this normal?"
,mogranne,2012-06-10T20:54Z,Just downloaded this. Thanks a lot! Do I need an activation code?
,MicoChops,2012-06-13T03:40Z,"For all those asking, yes, this is not yet activated. You will need either:

a.) an activation code to activate Windows; or
b.) an activation software, preferably Windows Loader by Daz (the latest version as of writing is 2.1.4)"
,tarik33,2012-07-03T11:39Z,Thanks man on torrent!!! nice work:D
,74950085,2012-08-02T20:08Z,"Love Maherz Windows Torrents, they are golden!  If I want to have modified OS, then I'll modify it. Far too many pre-cracked shit being shared while from time to time it's almost impossible to find a decent original unmodified version..."
