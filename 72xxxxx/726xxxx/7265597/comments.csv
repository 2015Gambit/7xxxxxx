V:5.5
A:7.5"
,GyrnNEY,2012-05-13T03:15Z,"Good quality, though mislabeled.  It's XVID, not x264.

720x412 XVID @ 998 kbps
mp3 audio @ 128 kbps constant.

For HDTV, I give vid/aud = 8/10

Thank you uploader."
,GyrnNEY,2012-05-13T03:18Z,"After watching a bit more, my eval for HDTV is a bit lower.  6/8
Sorry."
[V],spastik64,2012-05-13T04:14Z,It's just normal HDTV (720x404 or 624x352)
[T],despo1ler,2012-05-13T16:16Z,"all of our {C_P} releases are recorded from SDTV channels,  to qualify for labelling as HDTV it needs to be recorded from a 720p HDTV channel so the labelling is wrong as this is just our release renamed, it has not even been converted to h264, it is the same avi released through our oficial RG account.
 And the post says to avoid fakes and trust STV uploads?? 
I appreciate you promoting our releases but please dont mis-label them so people download it expecting better than we are able to provide without getting some donations to our RG so we can pay for HD cable channel rental."
