Tommy Vercetti, a member of the Liberty City mafia, has been just released from prison in 1986 after serving only 15 years for killing eleven men.[4] Tommy's old boss, Sonny Forelli, fears that Tommy's presence in Liberty City will heighten tensions and bring unwanted attention to his organization's criminal activities.[5] To prevent this, Sonny ostensibly promotes Tommy and sends him to Vice City under the guardianship of Mafia lawyer Ken Rosenberg to act as their buyer for a series of cocaine deals.[6] During Tommy's deal with the Vance Crime Family at the docks, an ambush by an unknown party results in the death of Tommy's bodyguards and the cocaine dealer, Victor Vance (the main character of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories). Tommy narrowly escapes with his life and loses both Forelli's money and the cocaine.[7]
