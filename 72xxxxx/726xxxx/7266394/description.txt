Somewhat surprisingly, Southern California's metal pop-punk the Offspring's music transfers well to the bluegrass format, shown off in Cornbread Red's banjo-laden and fiddle-laden tribute to them. The album takes songs from six of the band's seven full-lengths (only the seldom-heard Ignition is skipped), and includes"Self Esteem" and "Gotta Get Away," from Smash, "The Kids Aren't Alright," from Americana, and "Jennifer Lost the War" from The Offspring. Maybe it's the simple but catchy hooks and lyrics, maybe it's the teenage angst that Dexter Holland captured so well, but for whatever reason, The Bluegrass Tribute to the Offspring ends up being rather, and unexpectedly, enjoyable. ~ Marisa Brown, All Music Guide.
