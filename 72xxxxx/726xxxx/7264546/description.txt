CommView for WiFi is a special edition of CommView designed for capturing and analyzing network packets on wireless
 802.11a/b/g/n networks. It gathers information from the wireless adapter and decodes the analyzed data.
 
 With CommView for WiFi you can see the list of network connections and vital IP statistics and examine individual
 packets. Packets can be decrypted utilizing user-defined WEP or WPA keys and are decoded down to the lowest layer
 with full analysis of the most widespread protocols. Full to raw data is also provided. Captured packets can be saved
