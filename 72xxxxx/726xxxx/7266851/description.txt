Lambchop is a band from Nashville, Tennessee. The band has consisted of a large and fluid collective of musicians focused around its creative centre, frontman Kurt Wagner. Initially indebted to traditional country, the music has subsequently moved through a range of influences including post-rock, soul and lounge music. (wikipedia)

Mr. M was recorded at Nevers's Nashville Beech House studio cum bungalow, working with the usual core of musicians- Scott Martin (drums), Matt Swanson (bass), Ryan Norris (guitar, organ), Tony Crow (piano), William Tyler (guitar). Guests include original co-founder Jonathan Marx, delightful Cortney Tidwell and fiddler Billy Contreras - and with spectacular string arrangements shared between Peter Stopschinski and Mason Neely, it stretches out sonically as promised.

'This is a record of, and about, love and the healing, binding force that it represents. ItΓÇÖs the thing that becomes, more and more, the only thing worth living for as we move on through these years together, not alone', says Wagner.
