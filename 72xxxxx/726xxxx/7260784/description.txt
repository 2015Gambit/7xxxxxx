As the market-leading textbook on the subject, "Project Management: The Managerial Process, 5e" is distinguished by its balanced treatment of both the technical and behavioral issues in project management as well as by its coverage of a broad range of industries to which project management principles can be applied. It focuses on how project management is integral to the organization as a whole. The 5th edition reflects the latest changes found in the practice. Other texts discuss the topics covered in this text but they do not view oversight as the project manager's operating environment, as does Larson/Gray. Resumes of managers will soon be primarily a description of participation in and contributions to projects.
