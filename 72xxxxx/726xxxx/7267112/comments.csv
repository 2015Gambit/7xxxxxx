,Hiscore,2012-05-30T03:49Z,Interregum- You need to put the second disc over the first one on your imaginary drive to continue the installation.

Any solution for this ? 
I extracted both iso's, copied them into one folder and then started the ORIGININ.EXE"
,Revenir,2012-06-10T00:09Z,"I got past the installation and everything was fine. But then I go to run it, and it does this release date thing...and then it gives me an error that says ""Origin is not installed, and is required to play your game. Please reinstall Origin."" So, what do I do now? o_O The only thing it has for the main game is the 2 iso files and a hash file...so I dunno what I'm supposed to do."
,NosTraDomus,2012-06-10T16:51Z,"@perter918
must have been a bad install or download.
OR
your using vista/windows 7 and your not using the installation with admin privileges. use default install path. also, download the ""TAKE OWNERSHIP"" registry file, install that, then right click on all the folders or the main one, choose ""Take ownership"" from that menu"" "
,NosTraDomus,2012-06-10T16:53Z,"@Revenir
sounds like originInstall is fudged up.

Keep in mind, this game FAKES being used by origin it isnt needed to run, but it does require some files that origin uses,
You might have to UNINSTALL any/all ORigin programs. then restart, THEN run this setup again."
,Revenir,2012-06-11T23:08Z,Do I need to have this origin thing installed? I don't have any programs that use it.
,Sakeo,2012-06-12T08:31Z,"Game works, but whenever I boot it up it says that I don't have an account for the DLC :O

Any idea why it would do so? :x"
,hellotimo,2012-06-12T13:25Z,it's stuck at the part where you have to talk to some coucil :s any help?
,NosTraDomus,2012-06-13T01:28Z,"Yes, you need Origin, its not the FULL program, just whats needed to run, yAy for Pirates!
so run that OriginInstall.exe or whatever it is, im not at the computer to see what the exact name is.

DLC issue?
maybe you signed up SOMEWHERE, and it saved the cookies or something to your computer. and the game reads that info...

talking to the council?
there are many times you talk to them, or they...or single people of the council

just follow what they say, walk around, do side quest...the in galaxy map do the same thing.

if its Crashing or going black screen then you did NOT follow directions and need to REINSTALL the game. or the marijuana fairy gave you too much...she still owes me.

most of the time, you press MAP button...""V""? i think it is, scroll through the levels of that map, the different places, and on the right side, if you see NAMES, go to that place and talk to that person...Names OR tasks ""console"" or ""LIARA"" just go to them,talk or interact.

ive played this game, like 20 times, for different outcomes, dialogue..lovers..kissers...teasers...
even though@ first, you saved the geth, you would get a GETH PRIME as a squadmate...big disappointment there... 
but the prothean rifle is still good.

though i tried to FORCE special weapons on my back, like the NUKE weapon, it didnt work

But, i did manage to get the special rifle of the collectors (coverted protheans) it worked...but no sfx..lol--still, would rather have the NUKE and it working..."

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7080595/Mass_Effect_3-RELOADED game ISO's

Hope it helps :) 


Mass Effect 3 Install Guide with All DLC & Unlocked N7 content.
**********************************
I use Virtual Clone Drive......Its free just google it!!

Mount ISOa start install, 
when ask for the next disk/part mount ISOb & continue the install.
Once finished Exit the installer.

Goto the ME3 DLC UNlocker folder open it up you will find the crack.
This Unlocks the Prothean ""From the Ashes"".

Browse to the Games install directory Binaries/win32 folder, 
It is here by default:- C:/Program Files/Mass Effect 3/Binaries/Win32

Now copy the crack over to the Win32 folder & overwrite it.
From the Win32 folder copy & paste a short cut of the now new,
 MassEffect3.exe on to the desktop.

You can now close everything & unmount the ISO.

Disconnect from the internet.

Start the game with the shortcut.
Enter the game, see if you get that ""You need to activate DLCs message). 
If that's the case, go to Options -> Online and set No for both options related to connecting Online (Sending Feedback / AutoConnect to the Cerberus)
Stop the Game.



Now open the N7 DLC folder.
Now copy the Coalesced.bin file over to the CookedPCConsole folder,
it is here by default:- C:/Program Files/Mass Effect 3/BIOGame/CookedPCConsole
& overwrite it.
Again You can now close everything.

The N7 DLC is available, Get it here:-

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7445633/Mass_Effect_3_N7_DLC

or You could use this one.....

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7137586/Mass_Effect_3_dlc_weapons_armors_and_cheats



Now open the Readiness Level Cheat folder.
Now copy the Local_Profile.sav file over to the Save folder,
It is here by default:- C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/BioWare/Mass Effect 3/Save
& overwrite it.
Again You can now close everything.

Readiness Level Cheat....Get it from here:-
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7148806/Mass_Effect_3_Readiness_Level_Cheat_(Works_on_all_PC_copies)

You can also install The Extended Cut now also!!! 

To Import a ME2 Character you need to have your ME2 Game folder in the the BioWare Folder
& in your ME2 Game folder you need your complete save folder
So to get to your ME2 Save folder the path would be this:-
C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/BioWare/Mass Effect 2/Save 
then it would have your Characters folder in the save folder.
You need the complete Mass Effect 2 folder.

Start the game with the:- import a Character option & sellect your ME2's last save.

Disconnect from the internet during play.

Play the Game.


Heres a Gem....
