After a giant claw kidnaps their eggs, the Angry Birds chase it
into a wormhole and find themselves floating in a strange new
galaxy surrounded by space pigs! Luckily the Angry Birds have super
powers of their own...

Angry Birds Space features 70 interstellar levels on planets and
in zero gravity, resulting in spectacular gameplay ranging from
slow-motion puzzles to lightspeed destruction. With regular free
updates, brand new birds, brand new superpowers, and a whole galaxy
to explore, the sky is no longer the limit!

..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..

Just install.

Note: Looks like you can't see a mouse cursor in levels under OSX
10.7 under circumstances (e.g. full screen - use window mode then).
This looks like a bug in the software itself.

Thanks for choosing
