With them are Brendon, NicoleΓÇÖs Fiancee and Tommy previously a Wal-Mart door greeter who may be more than he seems. Together they struggle against a ruthless, relentless enemy that has singled them out above all others. The Talbots have escaped Little Turtle but to what end, on the run they find themselves encountering a far vaster evil than the one that has already beset them. As they travel across the war torn countryside they soon learn that there are more than just zombies to be fearful of, with law and order a distant memory some humans have decided to take any and all matters into their own hands. Can the Talbots come through unscathed or will they suffer the fate of so many countless millions before them. ItΓÇÖs not just the brains versus the brain-eaters anymore. The stakes may be higher than merely life and death with eternal souls on the line.
