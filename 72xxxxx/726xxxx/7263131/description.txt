Jean (Jean Yanne) and Catherine (Marlene Jobert) are a couple whose every move charts an advancement deeper into an emotional warzone. Theirs is the classic and the tragic case of an emotional abuse centred around a perplexing, but powerful, interdependency. As the moment approaches wherein the relationship can no longer perpetuate its cycle of weekend holidays, apologies, and submissions, Maurice Pialat discloses all the ways in which the future might be at once liberated, and enslaved, by the past.Based on a novel by Pialat himself, and on the trauma of his own personal life in the years leading up to the film, "Nous ne vieillirons pas ensemble" was a smash-hit at the time of its release, and retains its power up to the present day.
