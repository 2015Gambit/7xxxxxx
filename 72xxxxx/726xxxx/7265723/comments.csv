,1828429,2012-05-15T02:18Z,"hey guys i need help. for everyone to be able to download this, do i need to upload everything(im up to 3.1GB may 14 2012 5:18)"
,Jupaboga,2012-05-15T05:54Z,I hope this works :S anyway thanks for sharing :D 
,asinencia,2012-05-15T11:25Z,"Hey @1828429, I really appreciate what you're doing with this, I just have a couple of questions. First one, have you cracked this, or will I have to crack it myself? Second, how much have you uploaded? I was stuck on 48% for a day and now I'm on 86%, and yes, to my knowledge if you don't upload the whole thing then people can't get the whole thing. It'd be great if you yourself left it seeding for a few days. I'd be happy to seed once I get the full file."
,Jupaboga,2012-05-17T09:22Z,"i think i'm gonna need to crack it by myself, it's a shame that i don't know how to do it xD if someone could help i will be happy :D"
,Gekkieaap,2012-05-17T09:54Z,"When i start it up, nothing happens. It ask for my Apple ID so I type my apple ID, but nothing happens after that, i guess you have to crack it first"
,1828429,2012-05-18T01:37Z,"sorry, i honestly didnt know what would happen if you would need a crack can anyone crack this?"
,1828429,2012-05-18T01:47Z,"

,Jupaboga,2012-05-18T05:47Z,"changing that file doesn't work for me :(

,Funkeety,2012-05-19T06:17Z,"i just click the GTA SA.app, but nothing happen. the app didn't open.. does anyone here have the same problem? is there anything to fix this?"
