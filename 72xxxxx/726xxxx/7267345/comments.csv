,pinkeller,2012-05-14T15:17Z,Does it have more issues than Ocnosis' torrents?
,EternalOptimist,2012-05-20T18:00Z,"Yes, it does. A lot more, actually. He was missing some one shots and such, and its a much older upload. This one has everything that was released so far."

,tpbbabu,2012-08-19T06:55Z,"..... But i dont see many issues in ur pack.
Here are the missing ones - 
* B.P.R.D: The Black Goddess
* B.P.R.D: 1947
* Witchfinder: In Service of Angels
* Abe Sapien: The Haunted Boy
* B.P.R.D. Hell on Earth: Seattle
* Abe Sapien: The Devil Does Not Jest
* Lobster Johnson: The Burning Hand
* Hellboy: The Kabandha
* Hellboy in India
and many more . . . 

and u didnt even include a chronological reading order. There are a few in the internet , and all of them varies , they aren't the same n exact , thats why i cant follow those reading orders ;("
,EternalOptimist,2012-09-03T15:27Z,"I guess I did miss some now that I look at your list... I had a list of all the comics, and was tracking them through it, but I guess that list wasn't complete. I'll try to get a new pack up a few months from now, and I'll make sure to hunt those down when I do.

As for reading orders, yeah, I'm not even sure myself which one would be right. The two series (Hellboy and BPRD) are listed by release order, but I can't be sure when you're supposed to read the other series so that you're reading them both at correct order.

But even then, still pretty sure this is the most complete torrent so far. I'm still downloading new comics as they come out, so that when I release a new one, it's still as complete as possible."
