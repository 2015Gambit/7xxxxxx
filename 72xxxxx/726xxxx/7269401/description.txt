National Geographic: The Best of Lisa Ling 
National Geographic Ultimate Explorer host Lisa Ling travels to the far corners of the globe to seek out adventure and address some of the most topical issues of the day in this collection of memorable episodes from her weekly National Geographic Channel program. From travelling overseas to investigate the motivation of female suicide bombers to exploring American prison culture and travelling to Nepal to meet with two dedicated doctors who bring the gift of sight to one of the most remote regions of the planet, there's no assignment too dangerous for Ling, and no issue too tough to tackle.



2)  Miracle Doctors 
National Geographic Explorer host Lisa Ling sets off on an epic journey to Nepal, where few journalists have gone before, mixing extreme adventure with an unprecedented humanitarian mission to bring sight to some of the country's most remote villagers. Ling joins two remarkable doctors who have dedicated themselves to treating - and curing - blindness in Asia's poorest countries. Dr. Sanduk Ruit, born in rural Nepal, and Dr. Geoff Tabin, an American, have given sight to thousands of blind patients in a six-country region for more than two decades. Together with Ling, they trek across majestic mountains and harrowing gorges to the remote and long-forbidden kingdom of Mustang, where they set up an "eye camp."
