DESCRIPTION:

What you need to know now about America's energy future

"Hi, I'm the United States and I'm an oil-oholic." We have an energy problem. And everybody knows it, even if we can't all agree on what, specifically, 
the problem is. Rising costs, changing climate, peaking oil, foreign oil, public safetyΓÇöif the fears are this complicated, then the solutions are bound to be 
even more confusing. Maggie Koerth-BakerΓÇöscience editor at the award-winning blog BoingBoing.netΓÇöfinally makes some sense out of the madness. 
Over the next 20 years, we'll be forced to cut 20 quadrillion BTU worth of fossil fuels from our energy budget, by wasting less and investing in alternatives. 
To make it work, we'll need to radically change the energy systems that have shaped our lives for 100 years. And the result will be neither business-as-usual,
 nor a hippie utopia. Koerth-Baker explains what we can do, what we can't do, and why "The Solution" is really a lot of solutions working together. 
This isn't about planting a tree, buying a Prius, and proving that you're a good person. 
Economics and social incentives got us a country full of gas-guzzling cars, long commutes, inefficient houses, and coal-fired power plants out in the 
middle of nowhere, and economics and incentives will be the things that build our new world. Ultimately, change is inevitable.
