Wouldn't EPL Championship 2011-2012 Trophy Celebration been sufficient?

This may be old news, but I haven't seen either of the Manchester teams in action. As a neutral I don't think I'll even watch the final games of the season.  

I do appreciate all the hard work you do with these torrents all the same though."

Not sure what the above comment is going on about.(scratches head)"

The reason I posted this is I know there are a lot of Manchester City supporters who have been waiting for this for many decades and I thought they should savor and enjoy it. "
,fall1en,2012-05-15T08:44Z,"Aha I see.

I'm an Arsenal fan myself, but am happy with the result. They have a number of players that used to play for us, & I'd rather City won than Man utd. 

Thanks for all your uploads. You do a great job!

Cheers!"
