,ZombiFood,2012-06-14T14:27Z,"Gold trick for this version and maybe others. bye one of the items you get at start of game, master it go to rebirth 1 and sell all of that item. go rebirth 1 again and you will now own all the first items witout bying them thats worh like 1 300 000 or more play all of the intro with all the origonaly equiped items get shot in the eye die let it go on untill your alive and faceing the next monster. go rebirth 1 again and at this point you should have 2 of all the origenaly equiped items exceped the masterd one. all the unmasterd ones sell all the 2nd ones, the masterd one unequip it and sell it you will get about 380 000. go rebirth 1 again and play intro all the way thro again and repeat as much as you want. hint dont equip gems on any of the  original items it will cost you time and gold to remove them. use the gem forge and your gold to  bye and make better gems when you  do this glitch. I found this myself and have not found a better way to get gold without hacks. I sugest bying helm or sheild of orinal items to master. ring is ceapest but i cant find it for sale
