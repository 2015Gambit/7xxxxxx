,weblurker,2012-05-13T16:13Z,"First of all, thanks to TVTeam and VeroVenlo for capturing and uploading the BGT Final.

As other people have mentioned, some segments were missing from both captures.

The TVTeam capture is missing the first 15 minutes oft the episode. That includes the start of the show, introduction of the judges and the first act, The Mend. 

But the TVTeam capture does include two segments, the part that has Susan Boyle singing and includes another section with David Walliams performing with the ShowBears.

The VeroVenlo capture is complete except for the Susan Boyle and David Walliams performances.

So it appears everything is available but contained in two different uploads.

Thanks again to VeroVenlo and TVTeam. Without those uploaders doing a great job capturing and posting all the BGT episodes."
