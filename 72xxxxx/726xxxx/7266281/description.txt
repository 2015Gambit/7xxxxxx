ΓÇ£Belorusian rock band Weesp are fresh, exciting and a great example of good European music, a few Western influences I admit but this is a great band full stop. Alternative is a great word and although this may not be the best fitting genre description I think youΓÇÖll find that Weesp when you give them a good listen are such a fuse of styles and music that youΓÇÖll just love them.ΓÇ¥
