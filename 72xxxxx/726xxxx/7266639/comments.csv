[T],despo1ler,2012-05-13T20:08Z,"This is not converted from a .TS it is not an HDTV rip, it is an iTunes web download that has had the DRM protection removed during the conversion process to make this file.
 I do not encode these Reaperza releases, I just have permission from Reaperza to upload his stuff onto public torrent as he only uploads it to private torrent sites and direct download sites. This is also the reason why I was asked delay his stuff for a few hrs after receiving them, I usually upload them 3-4 hrs after his initial release."
