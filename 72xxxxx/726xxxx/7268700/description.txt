The first thing you need to know about Kill For Love is that itΓÇÖs long: 17 songs, 91 minutes, ends in a 14-minute minimal-ambient instrumental called ΓÇ£No Escape.ΓÇ¥ Now that nobody uses CDs anymore, thereΓÇÖs really no reason not to make an album this long, as long as youΓÇÖve got enough material that you consider worth including. The 2007 Chromatics album Night Drive wasnΓÇÖt an active-listening sort of thing; it was probably best heard as an evocative background pulse, one that would pull you in with a powerful piece of melody every so often but then release you and send you back about your business. Kill For Love works in a pretty similar way. Long stretches are instrumental, and the tick-tock beats and zoned-out vocals might get a bit boring if you were exclusively focusing on them. But thatΓÇÖs not how most of us listen to music, and the music on Kill For Love works in the same sort of way that Explosions In The Sky does. It fades into the background while at the same time making the colors all around us look a bit more vivid, making us feel as if weΓÇÖre existing in some imaginary cinematic landscape.

Of course, that involves making extramusical brain-synapse connections. ItΓÇÖs no secret that Explosions In The Sky start to sound a whole lot better once youΓÇÖve been watching Friday Night Lights for a while; their winding guitar filigrees evoke the dusty Texan triumphs of the TV show that famously uses them. In just the same way, Kill For Love now calls up the glimmering, skeezy, beautifully brutal imagined Los Angeles of Drive, and I canΓÇÖt quite imagine how the album would sound if I hadnΓÇÖt seen the movie. But thatΓÇÖs really a moot point. If you havenΓÇÖt seen Drive, what the f*** are you waiting for? See Drive! ItΓÇÖs great! Then listen to Kill For Love.
