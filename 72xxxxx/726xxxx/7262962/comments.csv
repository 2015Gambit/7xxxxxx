,asbolina,2012-09-01T09:19Z,"To the encoder/uploader of this movie:

The sample from this release shows horribad artifacts (see http://s14.postimage.org/tothh5k5r/image.png or http://s14.postimage.org/z1ibva827/image.png for example). Given the size of the faulty macroblocks (10x10), it's a decoding error on your side, before resizing to 1280x528. Is the full movie the same?"
,Pannaika,2012-09-20T20:25Z,Please come back!
,duriotic,2012-09-23T17:38Z,"Hi, GoodFilms.  I notice you specialize in older stuff.  Could I request a 1080p version of  La Boheme: Il Film with Anna Netrebko   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1157547/

There's only one HD on TPB, and the uploader TOOK OUT THE INCLUDED ENGLISH SUBS!!!! No subs can be found online, either.  I'd be really grateful."
