[T],SecTPB,2012-05-14T04:54Z,"Correction, the title of this episode is ""A Man Without Honor"" that aired 5/13/2012. Made an error in the description. My apologies."
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-14T04:58Z,"...and it's still not ""fake"" no matter how many spambots post random stuff in the comments about it lol. Unless those are actual people, then they're just idiots. It's the first upload of this episode and it is legit. Enjoy, and sorry about the description error. 

Game of Thrones - Season 2, Episode 7 - ""A Man Without Honor."" "
,sateda,2012-05-14T05:43Z,"The fact that the spammers are saying it's a RAR when it clearly isn't is making me think it's not a fake, i'll download and check."
,roomtemppotato,2012-05-14T09:41Z,"I made an account just to say that this looks legit to me. I haven't watched it through but I clicked through and it's definitely the correct episode, the video looks good, and the audio is great. Downloaded really fast. Thanks, SecTPB!!"
,mrod61,2012-05-14T11:55Z,It's the real deal. Watched it all the way through. Thanks SecTPB.
,Diabolixxx,2012-05-14T12:33Z,"Someone delete those cretins comments, makes my head hurt. Thanks for the upload, great torrent."

,Mad_Leo1,2012-05-14T17:06Z,"Fake. When you are opening the folder, you are getting explorer.exe crash. What a nasty virus"

[T],SecTPB,2012-05-15T01:39Z,"You're welcome, guys."
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-15T01:41Z,"@johanibal 
Maybe your system can't handle the 60FPS. If your system is good, try using a different h.264 decoder. CoreAVC is the best."
,Torrenad000,2012-05-15T17:39Z,"REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL!!!
Thanks SecTpb And fuck all those ungrateful spamming trolls."
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-19T03:37Z,"You're welcome, everyone. Nice to see support and understanding. Wish these ridiculous bots didn't scare away most people though. Typically, people only see the first comment or two, so from now on I'm just going to have to make the first comment on the file to avoid this issue. These bots are relentless."
