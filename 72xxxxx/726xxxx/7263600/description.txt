The Third Power - Believe [1970] [Album]
2005 - Akarma Records / 033 / CD

Hailing from Detroit City, hard rockers Third Power were led by singer/guitarist Drew Abbott (later to become a longtime member of Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band), along with bassist Jem Targal and drummer Jim Craig. Third Power formed in 1969 and quickly emerged as a favorite on the local club circuit thanks to the band's hard rock, bone-rattling sound and their influence from such three-person bands as Cream or the Jimi Hendrix Experience. In 1970 the album Believe was recorded for the Vanguard label but it was deemed too heavy for the label's direction and lacked the support that could have made it more of a hit. This decision by Vanguard to drop the band from their roster almost immediately after the album's release made it an instant collectable. Now, for the first time, Third Power have been legitimately released on CD with the sound digitally remastered and the original album graphics faithfully reproduced in a digipack CD package.
