If only all albums were made like this. 

Transmitter Failure, the sophomore release from New York's Jenny Owen Youngs, her second with Nettwerk is an accessible, engaging, tour-de-force of 13 (technically, 12) pop-rock songs that are fully satisfying, wholly confessional and startingly real. Armed with honey-throated vocals and a deft ability to write both memorable hooks and saturnine ballads, Youngs is the new millenium's Liz Phair wrapped up in an unassuming coziness reminiscent of Regina Spektor.
