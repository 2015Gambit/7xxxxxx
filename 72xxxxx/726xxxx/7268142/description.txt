"Its been a long time coming but Clare BowditchΓÇÖs fourth studio album, Modern Day Addiction, is very much worth the wait.

Modern Day Addiction is a contagious, satirical, yet heart-achingly tender album about humanity and ΓÇ£the eternal search for meaningΓÇ¥ in a world of quick, delicious fixes. It stands as a companion on the journey for anyone whoΓÇÖs ever asked the question ΓÇ£Surely there must be more?ΓÇ¥ followed by the statement ΓÇ£If so, great, IΓÇÖll pop back for it once IΓÇÖve finished reading this article about absolute-rubbish-that-somehow-has-me-transfixed-to-the-screenΓÇªeveryone SHUT UP! IΓÇÖm concentratingΓÇªΓÇ¥

As Clare tells it (and who knows if sheΓÇÖs telling the truth? Have you noticed how all her stories these days begin with ΓÇ£I woke up one morningΓÇ¥?)
ΓÇ£I woke up one morning and my heart was broken (just in the usual, everyday way) and all I wanted was a muffin, and a tall glass of combined coffee and Jagermeister, even though I was neither hungry, nor thirsty, which prompted the thought ΓÇ£Hmm, how very interesting! Perhaps thereΓÇÖs an album in here somewhere?ΓÇ¥ Thus began my extensive and exhaustive research-project into the topic of ΓÇ£Everyday Addiction and the Human ConditionΓÇ¥. Oh the reading list was endless, I tell you, IΓÇÖve barely left the local-newsagency sinceΓÇªΓÇ¥

In a most enjoyable and surprising way, Modern Day Addiction also aims to celebrate and question the modern world that produced it."
