Hi,

I noticed this was my 50th upload dedicated to Indie Music solely (not counting the other indie playlists of Dutch Treat and Sweetlists). So I felt, before I do the Mai lists, I do a special to mark the Jubilee. It has become an odd mix of old and new songs and is already one of my favourites (I like nice and easy). All interesting tracks in the best quality you are used to get from me.

If you like other music as well, please download ΓÇ£Dear Mr. PresidentΓÇ¥ and seed to make a point. Strangely it might make a difference.

Enjoy and seed.
