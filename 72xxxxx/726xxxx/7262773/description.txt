Introduction:

MP3Gain analyzes mp3 files to determine how loud 

they sound to the human ear. It can then adjust the 

mp3 files so that they all have the same loudness 

without any quality loss. This way, you don't have 

to keep reaching for the volume dial on your mp3 

player every time it switches to a new song. 
MP3Gain operates in two modes, Track and Album: 

Track mode volume-corrects a mix of unrelated songs 

to a selected level. MP3Gain calculates the volume 

level for each song individually. It then corrects 

each song to make its volume level match the Target 

Volume. 

For example, if you have 3 songs that have volume 

levels of 86, 91 and 89 dB and you use Track Gain 

to convert them to a Target Volume of 92 dB, they 

will all be at approximately 92 dB.
