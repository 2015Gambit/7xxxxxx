Charlaine Harris's newest Sookie Stackhouse book! Many more where this came from. If you need the file reconverted please use Calbre Library (which is great with converting books). I'm a newbie when it comes to uploading torrents so if you have anything rude or crude to say, please dont. Always appreciate any constructive assistance or helpful tips anyone has though. I have tons of books to share. Oh yes and please seed!
