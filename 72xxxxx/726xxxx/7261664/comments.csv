Thanks I've tried a long time to learn arabic, but I only know very basic things, simple phrases and food words since I'm a food nerd, a lot of people where I live in Sweden are from Iraq and Lebanon, and I learned the arabic script when I was just 6 years old even though I'm a swedish guy from the country, but I always was going to learn arabic ""later"" but hopefully I can get going now! Thanks."
