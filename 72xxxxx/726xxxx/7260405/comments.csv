- NOTE ALL MY FILES ARE FULLY TAGGED JUST AS IF YOU DOWNLOADED THEM FROM THE ITUNES STORE!

Let me know your thoughts what i could do better etc..  

Don't forget to re-wind the file when you are done watching it."

Since you asked for thoughts: confirm (and, probably, adjust) the h.264 Profile your application is using. 

It seems to me that you're using Baseline profile, which is resulting in your encode being so blocky and seemingly low-resolution. (Baseline Profile -- used by iPods and the AppleTV before Apple went HD -- supports only 1620 macroblocks, but a 1280px x 720px frame needs 3600)

Anyways, output a High Profile 3.1 file if you're aiming for the 1st gen AppleTV. If you're aiming for either the AppleTV 2 or 3, output a  High Profile 4.0 file.

Looking forward to your next encode."
