,Leopardi,2012-05-13T16:30Z,Cinavia? these shit HDChina torrents never have mentioned if there is cinavia.
,CrAcKeZ,2012-05-13T21:07Z,"5-20 kb/s WoW ..thats speed hahaha

Seriously people seed properly or stop seeding. whats the purpose of limiting a torrent upload at 1kb/s or less - grow up"
,CrAcKeZ,2012-05-13T21:11Z,"@Rouca it doesn't ..torrent if you know is based on users so even if the leachers are way more ..you as a downloader with incomplete torrent can also download from a leacher the parts that he has but you haven't!

So more users ..better speed, especially if the seeders are over 1000 (they spread small bits to everyone and everyone is exchanging the bits at higher speed)

More info on google, wikipedia or whetever source you need to see how bit torrent protocol works - no offence ;}"
,CVDB,2012-05-13T22:06Z,"wy does the movie stop after 1:20 min. (on PS3)

Are you guys completely inept or just blind to whats been going on?
Do you have any idea how many trojans and fifefif viruses this up loader is responsible for? You think they let people freely bootleg from their? This idiot has some of your computers remote wired and you don't even know it. Most of them are set to disintegrate after a few weeks if nothing happens. Do some tech investigating you peons. This shit ""does"" come from China and it's fraking dirty!
He/She, whoever Bozx is is a fucking leech. "
