Ready, aim, squirt! Join over three million players in this wet physics puzzler!

Using a water cannon mounted on a crane, players must adjust the height and angle of the cannon to fight fires, move obstacles, spin wheels and activate traps in this challenging water-physics based puzzler! But squirt carefully as you will run out of water and the less water you use, the more drops you earn!

Sprinkle features:

Amazing water physics

Brain-teasing puzzles ΓÇô What starts as simply pointing and spraying to quench each fire becomes much more challenging through the 72 levels, as players must overcome the intricacies of each puzzle before time and water run out.

Blocks, boulders, and cogs oh my ΓÇô Use the power of your water cannon to move blocks of ice and boulders, spin giant cogs, and depress traps inorder to reach and extinguish every last fire.

The inhabitants of Titan, a moon of Saturn, lived out their days peacefully in their straw hut homes ΓÇô until space tourists from Earth crashed through SaturnΓÇÖs rings, bringing a storm of flaming asteroids crashing down on the Titans. To combat the widespread fires threatening their homes, the Titans have built a massive water cannon. And they need you to man it!
