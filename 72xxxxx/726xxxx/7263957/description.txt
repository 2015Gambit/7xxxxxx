Douwe Dabbert is a remarkable guy. Nobody knows where he came from or where his lonely path leads him. With his magic knapsack on his back, he wanders around the world and experiences the strangest adventures.

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).
Then, you can use ".cbr files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!

Hope you enjoy!
