[V],TorrentTracts,2012-05-17T14:32Z,"Smaurice2001, glad you're enjoying these torrents.  As for your question about locating those older 2011 bundles, you can do so in one of two ways -- (1) you can do a simple Pirate Bay search on something like ""2011 Christian Music"" and all of those older bundles will pop up, or (2) you can click on my username, and it'll show you all I've torrented here on The Pirate Bay."
,blueget,2012-05-18T11:50Z,"Thank you for all the great uploads, it is really great for me to be able to explore the world of christian music (and interestingly since I started downloading I bought much more CDs than before)

What I would be really interested in are the early Albums of Remedy Drive, back then when their name was ""Remedy"" (and, in the very beginning ""The Aslan Band""). I can't get hold of them (except ""Magnify"", I found that one at a sharehoster and will upload it here if you don't have it) "
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-05-18T20:48Z,"Blueget. Good hearing from you. I find my experience here on The Pirate Bay to be quite impersonal at times. So hearing from a fellow Christian such as yourself tends to tie things together for me. Thanks for writing. :)

Remedy Drive.  I have so very little for Remedy Drive. When I read your post today, I went looking through my collection and I was quite surprised at how little I did have.  I certainly don't have any from ""Remedy"" or ""Aslan Band.""  So chances are, as a fan, you likely have more than I have at this point.  :)"
,blueget,2012-05-30T21:09Z,I torrented everything I have from Remedy Drive here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7313453
