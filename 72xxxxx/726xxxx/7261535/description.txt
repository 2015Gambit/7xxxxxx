"The People Will Hear"

In the penultimate episode leading into the two-hour 
finale of this landmark series, as her trial nears, 
Bree begins to fall for her attorney, Trip; Susan 
becomes concerned when Julie doubts Porter's 
commitment to be a hands-on father to their unborn 
baby; as Tom gets closer to being transferred to 
India for his job - thanks to Lynette - she begins 
to have second thoughts and tries to convince his 
boss to rescind the move; and the ladies are shocked 
about Gaby's nonchalant attitude as Bree continues 
to stand trial and take the fall for Carlos in the 
murder of Alejandro.
