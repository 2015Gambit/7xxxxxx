COMMENT (IMDB)

THE WARDEN OF THE TOMB is very stylishly filmed in black-and-white with exemplary 
sinewy camera-work around the décor of a castle hall in which most of the action 
(or rather story) takes place. A young and benign ruler meets for the first time 
the aged and practically forgotten titular figure while taking stock of his
employees; their conversation reveals that the old man has been having ghostly
visitations in the crypt by the ruler's ancestors every night for the last 30
years and, even more distressingly, that they have lately taken to calling for 
the young king to come join them. 

When the latter absents himself for a little while, the warden is joined by an 
arrogant and bullying member of the Royal family (the king's brother-in-law?) who, 
with the sinister court adviser (having been witness to the previous encounter), 
conspires against the throne. He mentions in passing the doppelganger nature of
the regent but, just then, the latter returns to find the old man almost on the
point of dying. As the warden is carried out by the royal attendants with the
ruler following them, the latter's consort enters the room herself: "This Autumn
is sad beyond belief".
