THANKS as always!!!!!

Any idea when the Miami game might be uploaded today?

I almost saw the results a few times today. It's hard to stay away from the news while working online.

Where I live the cable company are real pricks. They have THREE premium sports packages and you need ALL THREE to see all the games they show. They switch from one to another so you have to order all of them, freaking scumbags.

Whole world is full of greedy scumbags with small letters contracts for you. And the law comes from them made for them. The law protects them not us. I have thousands examples but is not the time..."
