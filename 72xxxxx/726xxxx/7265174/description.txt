The songs contained on this release are from the heart and soul of the writer...and they are guaranteed to touch the heart and soul of the listener. Richard writes with what I would call a 'studied sentimentality', as opposed to the knee-jerk variety. The feelings that he so eloquently expresses in these 12 tunes are deep and real...they've been grown and developed over the course of a lifetime. In 'The wedding dance', he can sings from the point of view of a dad dancing with his grown daughter at her wedding, musing on the gift of being a parent and taking comfort in the gentle touch of his wife's hand in his, and in the process illuminate the precious and rare treasures of the experiences without getting maudlin in the least. In 'The gifts', he has crafted a song that sits so comfortably in the bardic tradition of Ireland that it could easily be mistaken as traditional, a classic passed down orally through the years. 'The wild west' speaks from the heart of a man living at the cusp of the old ways and the new, knowing that change is inevitable, but aching for what will soon be lost forever.
