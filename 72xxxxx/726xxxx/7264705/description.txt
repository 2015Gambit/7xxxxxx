************


The latest number that the machine dispenses belongs to Michael Cahill, who on the surface is an unassuming and upstanding but solitary citizen, which masks the fact of being involved in a major smuggling ring led by a man named Neil Vargas. Members of the ring will not hesitate to kill if anyone gets in their way. Reese quickly infiltrates the smuggling ring as one of their own. But when Reese follows Cahill away from the group, Reese finds that he is really Daniel Tully, husband, father and undercover cop, who is deep undercover. Tully could have long ago put Vargas.
