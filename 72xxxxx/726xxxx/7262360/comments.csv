,snowpea29,2012-05-12T02:21Z,its barely letting you download
,Venturai,2012-05-12T02:33Z,"Going on the sample, it's a little too dark, but the quality shits all over the best thus far."
,hardyz100,2012-05-12T03:31Z,is the chinese writing on the bottom left on the samples in the movie as well and should i wait for another realese 
,snowpea29,2012-05-12T05:34Z,sount is out of sync some butr if you have vlc player back the sync to like -0.400 it fixes the problem
,arathur,2012-05-12T07:46Z,"Thanks zingooo. I was sick of seeing all the fakes these past few days, especially today. I agree with snowpea29 that a -0.400 offset on the audio helps with the synchronization. "
,Gagnasky,2012-05-12T08:59Z,"V = 6

,bajungadustin,2012-05-12T09:07Z,"BEST COPY SO FAR

V-8
A-2

Video is very nice and way better then the others.. seems like someone turned the sharp up too much but very very decent... especially toward the very end its almost DVD quality no joke.

Audio seems like a 5 year old did the editing on this. There are about 15 clipped scenes that seem to be attempting to re-sync audio. Audio is on sync for half the video then travels. half of the resync attempts work and the audio is on key then the other half seem to make it worse.. 

also.. toward the end the movie jumps backwards about 5 minutes.

But over all worth a download. i for one am going to redo the audio myself and match it up and take out the skip and add correct subtitles and will end up having a copy that will last me untill the DVDRIP comes out. but to be honest im going to purchase this one.. this movie is better then sex"
,zezant,2012-05-12T17:44Z,"The movie is great.

,professorjpj,2012-05-12T23:19Z,"WE NEED GOOD AUDIO PLEASE!  The video is watchable, the the audio makes it crap!  Someone PLEASE do I good job with one of these HD cams asap!"
,cainyboy,2012-05-13T01:22Z,"V:8
A:4 at best and out of sync

If your using VLC just hit the J key till it says -450 and it puts it in sync

Best version out yet, shame about the sound.

Anyway, Thanks zing"

Thanks for the upload zingoo.... keep up the good work!"
,Refessati,2012-05-13T19:21Z,"Created an account just to comment. Audio isn't great but video's decent. This is one of the better torrents for this movie, but we're gonna buy it anyway once it's out, because crap, I can't go without supporting Joss Wheadon.
Pretty good vid though. Seeding now. :D"
,ZombieLionelHutz,2012-05-13T19:25Z,Thanks... went to the theatre to see it then had to leave early and was waiting for a decent cam to catch the end :D
,bigmike1280,2012-05-14T00:16Z,"@professorjpj,,, please stop trolling everybody's downloads and posting the same shit. if you don't have anything original to say or constructive... just shut up."
,tkrulz,2012-05-14T02:42Z,"A: 6
V: 7
Let it download overnight, was waiting for me in the morning and was very impressed with the quality, best I've seen."
,skyvillage,2012-05-14T04:45Z,"Most over-rated movie in history.  Every single idea is copied from a better movie.  It's meh.  Not even remotely a classic.  Will be completely forgotten in another month, just in time for the next vastly over-hyped wallet hoover."
,BlackB3rry29,2012-05-14T06:22Z,"best quality so far. only flaw is a couple scenes jump back especially near the end, its about a 5 min loop. but hey cant complain"
,movbuff39,2012-05-14T09:05Z,"Found a way to increase the Audio quality, 
In your VLC player, go to menu, tools, tools and filters ( Ctrl + E) and select graphic equaliser. 

check enable, two pass both and select preset of ""live"" from list. 

Also use decent headphones and increase the volume to 130%. 

I can recognize 80% of the dialogs this way. Please try and see. Best of luck. "
,daemonesc,2012-05-14T17:44Z,im really quite excited about this ...saw it in the cinema last week and as a marvel fan i think i came in my pants at least twice ...the screens look good and crisp ...i think i may have to make love to you for this 
,daemonesc,2012-05-14T17:48Z,and hulk ......SMASH 
,daemonesc,2012-05-14T17:52Z,@skyvillage ...fuck off you fucking penis its just fun its supposed to be silly and stupid and a laugh its marvel you fucking bellend ....have you even read a comic ...what did you expect a fucking deep and meaningfull dialogue ? fucking shut up and stop being a cunt ....HULK SMASH ......PRICK 
,thewizardchrist,2012-05-14T18:52Z,"This isn't Marvel, this is Disney.

There used to be a difference."
,thewizardchrist,2012-05-14T18:53Z,"@deamon - I don't know what comics you are reading, but YES, I expect deep and meaningful dialogue, character choices, twists and turns."
,thewizardchrist,2012-05-14T18:55Z,"I don't know what comics you are reading, but yes I expect deep and meaningful dialogue, character choices and development, twists and turns and a plot a 10 year old couldn't think up."
,adalia33,2012-05-15T02:12Z,"V 7/10
A 1/10

Audio can be improved to about a six in VLC by setting the audio delay to synchronize the audio (using your ""J"" and ""K"" keys) and by changing the equalizer settings. Select ""Full Bass and Treble"" from the list and change the 600 Hz and 1 KHz to 3.8 dB. This is opened by pressing Ctrl + ""E"". Do NOT enable ""2 pass"". Also set your volume to at least 125%."
,arham.mir,2012-05-15T04:33Z,guys where to download .torrent file
,uneven78,2012-05-15T07:16Z,"1.  This is the beginning of the team.  They're basically learning to be IN a team and around others like themselves.  Deep dialogue will be around later once they've become closer.  

2.  The characters did make choices.  Yes, they were predictable, but they're heroes.  Heroes are usually pretty predictable.

3.  The plot of the movie is basically a variation of the Avengers #1 comic.  Loki pissed at Thor, tries to manipulate team into fighting, screws up, gets beat up.  They added aliens to make the big fight more interesting though, which I enjoyed. 

I think it was a wonderful first movie for the Avengers, and CANNOT WAIT for #2 with Thanos.  Should be EPIC."
,uneven78,2012-05-15T07:18Z,"Oh and as far as character development, thats why they made one or more movies for each character.  So they wouldn't have to do a bunch of backstory or development.  I would have like to seen more of Hawkeye's or Black Widow's history, even though its just basic spy/assassin background."
,stan-the-man82,2012-05-15T10:52Z,"thankx for the up zingooo,  fast dwnload 7.5 m/b sec.. sample looks nice will seed for a few days
cheers!!!!"
,Virusbomb,2012-05-19T06:09Z,"Best video quality I've seen of this movie but the sound is about a second out of sync, otherwise it's great."
,Crazedkid,2012-07-01T17:58Z,"@Skyvillage, You're a fucking moron. If you're gonna whine about a movie then don't fucking come and download it you homo-erotic waste of space. This movie is a Marvel fans dream, Go kill yourself, Bitch. Have a nice day."
