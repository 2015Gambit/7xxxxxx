,revultra,2012-07-15T04:55Z,"Hey liluser I just wanted to say thanks so much for all your work.  The install went flawlessly on a older machine I was forced to get up and running once my main rig failed.

For those about to dl this: The initial install takes longer than a basic or stripped down version, BUT considering how long it would take using windows update or installing these necessary components manually.. this is clearly the preferred option.  Again, really professional job liluser.

All components including update works just fine.
