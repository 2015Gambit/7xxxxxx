cause seems footy and footballmal upload ON and OFF"
[T],footy,2012-05-14T17:27Z,"@ lucabara: Normally i try to up MOTD as soon as possible, but if some one already has upped it, i don't do it, as two torrents of the same thing i think is not good, as the single torrent could benefit from having more seeds and there by more download speeds.
It's the same thing with footballmal too, if i have upped it, he won't do it and vice versa."
