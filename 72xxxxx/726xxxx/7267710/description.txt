I was born in Reno, Nevada, but I was raised in Phoenix, Arizona where I live now. I'm a very outgoing and personable person, a bit of a romantic with a soft side for people. I like to say I live by my heart. Some of my favorite things in life are coffee, chocolate cookies and good company.  I sketch, draw and like to design clothes. I enjoy traveling, meeting new people and seeing new places. I like anyone who can make me laugh (I have a quirky sense of humor).  I like to take chances and have no time for regrets. My long term goal is to become a journalist and work for a top magazine or maybe to be a designer. For now, my modeling career is most important to me.
