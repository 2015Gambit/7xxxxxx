,pjones452,2012-05-12T11:37Z,this guy is the devil
,HUPHTOR,2012-05-12T11:53Z,"Hahaha, of all the evil people one could think of, you choose to call Bill Maher the devil. Asshole maybe...but THE devil? Seriously? I love you religious types. Your paranoid thoughts are always good for a laugh or two. Anyhoo, I'm off to watch satan on HBO."
,Fitzy727,2012-05-12T12:12Z,LOL @ Religion.  Thanks for the upload :D
[V],TheExecutive,2012-05-12T12:57Z,"If there was a ""devil"" it would be Mitt Romney and a good portion of the too-conservatives in the Republican Party.  

(Notice I didn't bunch MItt in the second category....)"
,eigosensei,2012-05-12T13:30Z,Another great upload
,10912362,2012-05-12T13:47Z,"If you are a good christian you shouldnt be calling people with different opinions than yours the devil... you should kill them for being an infidel in god's name. Religion, what a great concept...."
,room237,2012-05-12T15:25Z,"@pjones452 - And you are here today on PB performing your duty of chastising sinners, as opposed to lets just say for the sake of argument...illegally downloading copyrighted materials. By all means, please continue with your lesson in hypocrisy. "
,jtata,2012-05-12T16:18Z,"yea pjones452 you can suck it. Go believe in your magical man in the sky. Even if they was a god, bill maher would be praised and welcomed in to heaven for being real and telling the truth. Most republican views when you think about it are hypocritical and selfish.. think about it.. if Jesus really existed what would he do. He definitely wouldn't neglect the poor and in a time of depression keep all for himself and let the poor suffer. Trickle down economics never works. lol. Just saying. "
,lenky,2012-05-12T17:18Z,thx for the dl
,KelownaGuy,2012-05-12T20:07Z,"Seriously, you think Bill Maher cares if you call him The Devil?

You've obviously never watched the show, Bill Maher is probably the best known atheist in the United States."
,Caf1000,2012-05-12T20:23Z,"Nah guys, he's just confused. pjones452, just because Maher is around atheists and makes fun of religion doesn't make him the devil. And if you're worried about all that smoke around him, its not hellfire, its weed."
,JohnHolmesII,2012-05-12T20:55Z,I think you all just got trolled hard.
,chelchele,2012-05-12T22:11Z,"Bill, we love you. pjones452 does it too. "
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-05-13T05:41Z,"I second JohnHolmesII and his comment. You all just got trolled BIG TIME by pjones452.

Who the fuck uses torrents AND searches for torrents with bill maher AND would actually post such a comment. Yes, a troll. See chelchele's comment? She's got the picture.

No one would ""accidentally"" stumble upon bill maher on torrents. pjones452 obviously knew what he was looking for and was commenting in jest. Now we got 10+ responses to his trolling. He won. Lol."
,Caf1000,2012-05-13T07:42Z,I just wanted to make the snarky hellfire weed reference. whether he is a troll was immaterial.
