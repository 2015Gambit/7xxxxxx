This collection includes the Khan Academy Math, Science, and Health and
Medicine videos as of late 2011.

To meet upload restrictions I have split the collection into three torrents:
Math 1, Math 2, and Science.

The difference between this and other collections is that I have compressed
them to a significantly smaller file size while maintaining maxiumum
watchability. The total file size has been reduced from just over 36 GB to just
under 10 GB.  This makes the collection much easier to distribute and has the
added benefit of being playable on older computers that have trouble with the
larger videos.

These files are both smaller and higher quality than the PSP files available
elsewhere. The entire collection can be burned to three single-layer DVDs.
Each subset includes an index txt file making it easier to search for specific
topics across the collection.
