WarioWare Smooth Moves WII (PAL)
Wario and his pals learn fun, wacky moves after discovering a strange book and a mystical device called the Form Baton. The WarioWare team took an idea so wacky, it could only be made with the latest technology... the Wii Remote. Players must clear fast-paced sets of microgames, changing the way they hold the Wii Remote each time. As they do, they'll unlock more microgames and souvenirs.
