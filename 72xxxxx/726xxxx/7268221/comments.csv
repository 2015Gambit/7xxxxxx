,DriverAus,2012-05-14T08:21Z,English subtitle: http://engsub.net/?p=eng_series&id=291&order=desc
,WTFaaa,2012-05-14T10:50Z,why english speakers download a subtitle?
,Dgcz,2012-05-14T12:32Z,"WTFaaa,
might surprise you, but not all of those are native English speakers, so subtitle is a great help 
(not to mention the hearing impaired)"
,Mcfeast,2012-05-14T12:46Z,cause thay can't feckin hear all in tha feckin dialogue - that's why...
,gujit_ss,2012-05-14T16:05Z,"I speak british english (like they do in game of thrones), but even i prefer subtitles."
,gujit_ss,2012-05-14T16:09Z,"I say british english, but in s02e06 the british guy who plays Xaro Xhoan Daxos, says 'dreamed' not 'dreamt'..which is americanised and wrong :)"
,dionf78,2012-05-14T17:40Z,Thanks
,AnimalLeopard,2012-05-14T17:55Z,Thanks! :)
,nightprowler.,2012-05-15T00:25Z,I always appreciate the eng sub links.  Sometimes you just can't watch shows as loudly as you'd like to.  Babies and what not. 
,Bmaxim13,2012-05-15T14:58Z,"Thank you so much!!!
And i always watch with subtitles for 2 reasons :
1. sometimes they talk to fast
2. my English is not perfect and i can learn from the subtitles. "
,mobno1,2012-05-18T12:51Z,"WTFaaa
I'm hungarian and I'm still learning the language. I'm always watching Game of Thrones with english subs."
