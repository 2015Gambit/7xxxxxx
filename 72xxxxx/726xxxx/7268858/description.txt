The DVD is a mixture of Norwegian and English dialogue, there are English/Swedish/Norwegian/Finnish subtitles available. The scenery captured is stunning, great underwater footage of Halibut taking lures :)

"The Halibut Queen" contains exceptional underwater sequences, a lot of action, and expert tips from an experienced sportfishing guide. The film is based on the TV-success, but contains plenty of new footage, as well as unpublished clips.
We meet Kenneth Bruvik, who has, all his life, dreamt about catching a large halibut. Per Jonasson, the sports fishing expert, who specialises in halibut, helps him fulfil his dream. In this film we get a lot of inside tips about what strategy Per Jonasson uses to go after the largest halibut.
If you only ever buy one sea angling DVD make it this one! The DVD entitled "The Halibut Queen" is a must watch for any anglers who want to tangle with these massive flatfish when visiting Norway. "http://www.planetseafishing.com/reviews/read/the-halibut-queen-dvd"
