geeh all these people pm-ing for this show you think I was in USA :)
now could I ask people to post questions to the torrent
or prev torrent and I answer there in future.. ta

ok.. I found a mp4 source.. I converted to xvid.. randomly
checked and in sync.. the mp4 source was a different one this time
but looks a bit sharper 

i havent any info on epi.. but they have to  do king of pop
tats on people by looks

help to seed if grabbing 

enjoy

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
===================================
Ps/3 , phone and xbox users may consider grabbing
the free tool umile encoder 3.1.1.2 it can convert
to most devices to make compatible in 8mins
on dual core or higher. as some of my converts may
fail for certain devices.. you will need a pc to run it
though. no link just google it..
