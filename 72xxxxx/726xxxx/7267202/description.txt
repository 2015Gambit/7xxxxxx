Hi.

I was never able to install and play No One Lives Forever with another torrents, because they all used daa files, and i never could get them to work.
So, i used isocreator or something like that to create two iso files from the daa files. 
Now, it works great, already installed and having a lot of fun with this simple, oldie but great game!

This is my first torrent.

Used deamontools to install...

Carpe Diem
