ApolloΓÇÖs credo is simple: ΓÇ£Everything I make, I try to make it my favorite album of all time.ΓÇ¥ He is building on the foundation laid down by NasΓÇÖ Illmatic and Black MoonΓÇÖs Enta Da Stage in hopes of taking it one step further, and most important, is past the trepidation felt in the past. Radio is good, but ApolloΓÇÖs music is for the children of the underground
