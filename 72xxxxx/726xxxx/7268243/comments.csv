,CandiedHaggis,2012-05-14T05:23Z,"Thank you for upping in the increasingly rare .avi format. My dinosaur of a computer will not play stupid .mkv and .mp4 files, which it seems are what everyone is using lately. Much appreciated!"

,Belhene,2012-05-14T06:13Z,"I'm getting tired of the stupidly huge number of leechers. Speed is awful. Thank you, 5k faggots who can't fucking leave their clients seeding in the background. Fuck off."
,akif_mol,2012-05-14T06:27Z,"thnx ettv

,douglino,2012-05-14T06:31Z,seriously.. what the fuck is going on with all the leechers
,RumataDEstor,2012-05-14T06:37Z,"Guys, I don't know about your inet connection, but it took me less than 15 minutes to download and I have 10 Mb/s cable. Note: 550 Mb is MUCH better than 350 Mb. Special thanks for AVI goes to ettv"
,emnioj71,2012-05-14T06:56Z,"Thanks.  

 As for all the people bitching about seeders, fuck off.  You are getting it for free and still you whine like little bitches.  "
,bullryder,2012-05-14T07:14Z,slowest download in a long time........normally very quick.......but great quality
,spawn_9000,2012-05-14T10:04Z,"Thanks ettv! Always great work, and keep them AVI's coming!

emnioj71 it doesnt help when seeders bail out as soon as the download finishes. You are getting it for free, so why not help out everyone else in the same boat."
,Darconn,2012-05-14T11:01Z,"Thx for Avi, keep it up!"
,ozky666,2012-05-14T11:05Z,Many thanks for the AVI file as my DVD player + TV won't accept mp4 mkv etc
,endthetyranny,2012-05-14T12:19Z,jezuz christ do you ppl honestly have nothing better to do than watch the speed of your torrentz? thats actually kinda fucking sad =(

,torourke22,2012-05-14T14:22Z,"Thanks for the AVI format. I use my DVD player and it doesn't like anything else, except DVDs of course."
,JobenJBB,2012-05-14T14:31Z,"Cheers ettv! Have been downloading multiple tv show's from you for a while now and I've never had a problem, always awesome quality, keep up the awesome work man, some of us do actually appreciate it. Thanks and long live Avi files! >:D"
