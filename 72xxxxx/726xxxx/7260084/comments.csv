,bbb_ozoz,2012-05-12T11:44Z,same same.....sorry to say it but this is not working....I'm sure it's not CC....must be mix-up somewhere :D
[V],ChattChitto,2012-05-12T14:22Z,"Guys & Gals:
The Serial is working, be sure of that as i have tried it two times already just to make sure myself :)

Now lets help you get it working too!
Go to the How To Use Guide and follow the Instructions carefully.
I have provided two Serials, One that will allow you to install Nero Burning Rom as trial/demo (first serial) and another to make Nero Burning Rom fully registered (second one).
Now after installing it, (just to make sure, block nero from accessing the Internet using your FireWall) go to nero controlcenter and there you will find a demo key, remove it (if there is no demo key then ignore this step).
after that click on Add and add the second serial that i have gave you (its a little bit shorter then the first one used to install Nero).
The register process is actually pretty easy and straight forward :) and I tried to explain it as detailed as possible!
if this is still not working for you, please provide me with a screenshot of the problem so i would help you out exactly where you need help."

,ROMcentral,2012-05-13T06:54Z,"""Nero has detected unlicensed use of its software. For full access to the latest Nero features and technologies, please go to the Nero Online Shop to purchase a valid serial number.""
Anyone else getting this when attempting to register it?
And yes, I did everything right, up to now. I tried installing it again, too, to no avail. Help us out, CC. Something ain't right."
,paranoid77,2012-05-13T12:04Z,"same here serial doesnt work.Did it exactly like manual says..in the end i used this serial:

9008-0092-XKK2-AL1H-4LWA-WAWX-93HH-28PC

works perfect now ;)"
[V],ChattChitto,2012-05-13T22:54Z,"If it didn't work for you it must be because you have allowed Nero to connect to its Server Home and check for the Serial.

Its working for me, Proof:

,jko81264,2012-05-19T18:14Z,"The original instructions didn't work. Instead I did the following things.

1: Run the setup and install as a trial with serial 8007-506K-1P72-086Z-UE94-727E-T2TT-H67X-CEPP-3A46-AP5K
2: After install go to the Nero Controlcentre
3: Delete the demo-key
4: After deleting the demo-key add this key: 9008-0092-XKK2-AL1H-4LWA-WAWX-93HH-28PC
5: Do not download any update

Worked for me."

pls help thanks"
,bigisle,2012-07-16T02:02Z,"Aloha ALL! This did work for me using the other key. However I only have 3 of the programs. Nero Burning Rom, Nero Control Center, and Nero Rescue Agent. Does everyone else only have these three when you go to: Start All Programs Nero Nero 11 and see those 3 listed??? I am wanting to BURN mp4 video files to my DVD burner. Has ANYONE had success doing this? Please advise me.  It states in the Help Contents: In Nero Burning ROM it is not possible to convert video files to DVD-Video, an AVCHD video, or a BDMV-Video. Converting video files to DVD-Video, to AVCHD video, or BDMV-Video is possible in Nero Video for example. Nero Video is included in the full version of Nero 11. More information about Nero Video is available on the Web site www.nero.com, and more information about video editing is available in the separate Nero Video manual.
Does anyone have Nero Video on theirs?  Does it work?  I'd surely love to get it.  How did you do it? Thank you very much Antoinette"
,bigisle,2012-07-16T04:18Z,"It seems I need Nero Recode.  Isn't this v11 supposed to have it? And several others? Did my programme just not download prooperly? If you have them ALL please let me know and I will re download the torrent.  Thank You,

,bigisle,2012-07-17T09:21Z,"Pretty Strange. Got the whole thing all downloaded by following the read me first install instructions.txt and the other read me. txt.  It shows in the Control Center for Nero that is accepted the serial number for the Nero 11 and shows the State as Licensed. But not the one for the Platinum. That one says Non-Licensed under State. It still says expires Never which does no good.  AND when I try to open any of the 11 Nero Programs I get this splash screen in front of the program!!! NON LICENSED USE Nero has detected non-licensed use of it's software. For full access to Nero and all of it's features and technologies please purchase a personalized serial number for the latest Nero version in the Nero Online Shop. Then it has a Special Offer  The OPTIONS at the BOTTOM are:
REMOVE (to remove the serial number in the Control Panel and put in the valid one)   BUY NOW  OR    CLOSE.
The craziest thing is that it is updating! How silly when I can't use it.  
No where did any registration screen come up to register it using a valid e mail address.  Is there anyway to find that still - would it help?  Anyone's answer to this would be useful indeed.  Thank you, 
bigisle (Antoinette)"

,peluprogrammer,2012-08-29T15:49Z,"I don't like your Launcher. I had to extract ""Nero_BurningROM_trial.exe"", copy serials to a txt file and delete your Launcher. If you want to show how big you are, this in not the way."
