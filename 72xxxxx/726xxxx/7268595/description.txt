Apart from his more well-known orchestral version of the Saxophone Concerto (which are more widely available), Glass also recorded a more intimate rendition using only a saxophone quartet. In addition, there are two shorter works here called Melodies for Saxophone and Windcatcher. The effect of the smaller ensemble is electrifying.

This is off of a CD from the independent label Orange Mountain Music. These are mp3 files at 128-156 kbps. (I apologize for the low bitrate, but this was somewhat hard to find.)

From the Glass Pages web site:

"This CD of solo and all-saxophone compositions contains the world renowned Raschèr Saxophone Quartet's brilliant recording of The Saxophone Concerto (Quartet Version). The Raschèr Quartet has performed this piece 90 times in the major concert halls of Europe and United States and it shows. 

This stunning recording was produced by Mr. Glass' production team, Kurt Munkasci and Michael Riesman, in 1998 at the Looking Glass Studios. Also represented is one of New York's preeminent woodwind players, Andrew Sterman, performing Melodies for Saxophone, 13 shorter pieces for solo saxophone, some of which were inspiration for the Saxophone Concerto. 

The disc is completed with a new recording, Windcatcher. The veteran Philip Glass Ensemble Woodwind players, Jon Gibson, Richard Peck, and Andrew Sterman performed this composition for saxophone sextet. Messrs. Gibson, Peck and Sterman have made enormous contributions to Philip Glass'music for several years (over 70 years among them!) and their ongoing participation in the ensemble continues to assure its excellence. This Michael Riesman/Don Christensen-produced recording exhibits their extraordinary ensemble sensibilities and their keen understanding of Philip's music."
