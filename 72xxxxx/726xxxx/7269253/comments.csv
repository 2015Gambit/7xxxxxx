,mal808,2012-05-14T21:14Z,"A bit more information:

ESPN2, commentators: Ian Darke & Steve McManaman, Macca's pretty much loses his voice by the end which is pretty funny.

Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x720 (16:9) 257.51fps
Audio: AAC 48000Hz stereo

Audio and video are good but have a bit of cable/satellite video compression as you would expect- the big file size is needed to avoid adding more noise.

1st half.TS 1.89GB 49:35
2nd half.TS 2.31GB 60:21
Post Match Part 1.ts 262MB 6:41
Post Match Part 2.ts 362MB 9:14 - includes the trophy presentation etc.

I'll seed this for as long as I can- still can't believe CITY DID IT!"
