After avenging his family's brutal murder, Wales is on the lam, pursued by a pack of killers. He travels alone, but a ragtag group of outcasts is drawn to him-- and Wales can't leave his motley surrogate family unprotected. Eastwood's skill before and behind the camera remains unparalleled in Hollywood history. 

Even Orson Welles? "I reckon so."

I have limited bandwidth. So please be patient.

And seed as much as you can.

Enjoy!!!
