,Blezza,2012-05-15T00:04Z,"I'm not sure why but this is out of sync for me, it's noticeable. Is it something with vlc player or my computer perhaps? I've tried adjusting it in options but.. doesn't really work. 

Btw what happened to your upload of Fired Up! ? I know i said it was out of sync but i downloaded a other one and it was also out of sync, it's probably some problem on my end. the video and audio was good so not sure why you removed it, why did you?


Movie: 7/10

Video 9/10

Audio 10/10"
