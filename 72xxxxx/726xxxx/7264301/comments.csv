not sure about that voice box.. shows how the
tech has improved since then (2011 May-Sept).. like cycling channels very quickly opposed to only plays a radio station randonly e.g. the EAD haunting in bundle#2"
[V],psspss,2012-05-13T13:51Z,"only part 3 of Manson and EADs was any good in this collection

some good evps heard.. shame the ghost box
interferred or they talked over some :)

in fact bundle 1  they did a better job of editing and adding client interviews.. so they did improve
investigating and video editing a bit
they rely on that ghostbox too much though

still be good to see more they do and upload
see none for 2012 yet.. so maybe they arent uploading any more?"
