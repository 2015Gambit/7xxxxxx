O ri Chiraiya
Nanhi si chidiya
Angna mein phir aaja re

O bird,
little bird,
come back again to the yard..

Andhiyara hai ghana aur lahoo se sana
Kirno ke tinke ambar se chun ke
Angna mein phir aaja re

The dark is deep and covered in blood..
pick the straws of sunrays from the sky,
and come back again to the yard..

Humne tujhpe hazaro sitam hain kiye
Humne tujhpe jahan bhar ke zulm kiye
Humne socha nahi
Tu jo ud jayegi
Ye zameen tere bin sooni reh jayegi
Kiske dum pe sajega mera angna

We have done injustice against you a thousand times,
We have given you tortures of the world..
we didn't think-
if you fly away,
this earth will remain deserted without you..
with whose presence shall my yard be adorned..

O Ri Chiraiya, Meri Chiraiya
Angna mein phir aaja re

Tere pankho mein saare sitare jadooN
Teri chunar dhanak satrangi bunooN
Tere kajal mein main kaali raina bharooN
Teri mehandi mein main kachchi dhoop malooN
Tere naino sajaa doon naya sapna

I'll embed all the stars in your wings,
I'll weave for you a rainbow colored scarf,
I'll fill the dark night in your kohl,
I'll rub raw fragrance in your henna (adorned hands),
I'll give a new dream to your eyes..

O ri Chiraiya, Meri Chiraiya
Angna mein phir aaja re
