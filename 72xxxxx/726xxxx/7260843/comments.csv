,Serenifly,2012-05-11T11:46Z,Another one of these shoots were the guy is just completely superfluous. I really wished they did more girl/girl shoots on HT and DB. And they totally ruined EB by making it boy/girl only
,Groovejet,2012-05-11T15:02Z,"yea, kink made its money from girl/girl and then suddenly they think it's appropiate to throw in random guys WTF?"
,Squito,2012-05-11T17:14Z,"Honestly I lost my interest in EB totally when they degraded it down to the level of a usual anal site with some mild bdsm. I used to love it when they made shots like this one:

,birdie123,2012-05-11T17:44Z,Squito the EB with Dana looks awesome is it uploaded grateful if you could many thanks regards
,Serenifly,2012-05-11T18:51Z,"There is just never any chemistry or connection with the guys. Especially the dudes on DB and HT. They are completely emotionless. I like the DB set and their equipment, but the guys just ruin it.

The problem with EB is that it is very formulaic. All scenes start with two women - and you think ""wow, this looks great"" - but then a guy joins and ruins everything. This also plays into the ridiculous stereotype that two women can't have sex without waiting for a man to finish the job.

I get that some people like boy/girl, but I don't see why they can't do both (and not in the same scene!). Why can't there be both boy/girl and girl/girl scenes on one site?

,Vertigoh,2012-05-13T20:15Z,Whenever I read the comments of the g/g scenes there's always people bitching it's all women.  I think they struck a nice balance on eb where they have about thirty minutes of g/g and then the guy comes in for 20.  Both parties gets their scene and should be happy!
