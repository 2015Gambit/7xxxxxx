Narratives:

After a skateboarding accident in 1998, Manafest took time to focus on rap and was noticed by Trevor McNevan of the Ontario-based band Thousand Foot Krutch. This led to his signing with an internationally distributed label, BEC Recordings under the Uprok Records label, and his debut release Epiphany. The album was made primarily of West Coast hip hop with several rapcore outings in the vein of Limp Bizkit, P.O.D. and Linkin Park.
