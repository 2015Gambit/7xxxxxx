This is the complete Bibliography of the Body Farm Series by the author team of Jon Jefferson and renowned forensic anthropologist Dr. Bill Bass (consulted on Patricia Cornwell's book Body Farm). Yes, I did upload The Inquisitor's Key earlier, but couldn't isolate it from the rest, so I included here with the others. They are all retail or close to retail quality.
