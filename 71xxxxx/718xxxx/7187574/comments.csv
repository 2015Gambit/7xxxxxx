Your comment on how to get ""Maxspeed"" that you posted under your ""Mission Impossible 4 Ghost Protocol"" upload - 

[ Torrent Client - Preferences - Bandwidth - Number of connections - Set aprox. 500 for each ] 

Do you set (500) to all three options ?
 - Global Maximum number of connections:
 - Maximum number of connected peer per torrent:
 - Number of upload slots per torrent:

Yes, I added 500 to all three options, Protocol Encryption = Forced and Bandwidth Up/Download=0 : unlimited. 

I used to get approx. 20-30 seeds, maybe 20 peers before but after making the change I got 100's of Seeds and peers indicated. 

I believe it made a big difference in the download speed of this torrent.

Ooooooh, brother... I don't even know where to start. The .avi file format was first introduced in 1992, so it's definitely NOT 1989 -.- And for portability's sake everybody please DO use .avi, because it's THE most videly recognised video file format. Most devices also play .mpeg, but if they do, you can just compress them into avi with minimal loss of quality. But what other formats should we use for ""portability"", ""quality"" and ""modernity""? .mkv?
