,samstaro,2012-04-15T18:05Z,"Thank you!

What is wrong with the subtitles though? It's not even right, it shows something strange like some kind of commentary over the video or something?

Example here:

""79
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,331
I was trying to figure out, you know,
what actually happens...

80
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,209
...when a person is poisoned...

81
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,684
...and I came across these really scary
YouTube videos with, like...

82
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,531
Oh, everything's on YouTube nowadays.
You have to be so careful.

83
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,848
And they had, like, cadavers, and they--

84
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,322
Cutting them open and showing, like,
""This is what happened to her liver"" and--"""

,Revisionist,2012-04-15T19:57Z,"well guess no one can comment on the file yet... most of the publichd's i have downloaded have been ""problematic""... lots of dropped frames or synch issues depending on the player.  seems like any files over 5 gig arent encoded well these days. but them again most of the encoders now seem clueless as to what they are doing anyway.  over all i find the quality has really nosedived the past year.  most of the people who rate stuff 9 or 10s must be watching things on crappy laptops.

,psychoacer,2012-04-18T03:05Z,"I love when people complain about seeders but then can't seem to understand that 
A. Not everyone has super fast internet and compound that with upload speeds being a fraction of what you can download at.
B. There is 3x the amount of leechers to seeders. That ratio means peoples already slow upload speed is cut into 3rds due to 3x's the amount of people leecher. 
C. People are still downloading other crap. If you are downloading your upload speed is diminished. 
D. Even if you had twice the speed you do right now people will still complain. Inpatients is the cornerstone of the human race. When DSL first came around people were so happy to have 50kbps download speeds. If you want it faster you should go join usenet and pay up otherwise you are getting this for free. Stop crying"
,Nycku,2012-04-18T10:37Z,"psychoacer - Youre right about speed and leechers , the torrent is new so it will probably take a week or so to get a better dl speed.
But when DSL first camed out, people where content with it because movies in bluray were not so popular , so waiting 3 hours at 50kb/s for a 700mb movie was ok"
