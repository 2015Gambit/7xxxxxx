Is Justice Being Served?



Seinfeld mocked it. Letterman ranked it in his top ten list. And more than fifteen years later, its infamy continues. Everyone knows the McDonaldΓÇÖs coffee case. It has been routinely cited as an example of how citizens have taken advantage of AmericaΓÇÖs legal system, but is that a fair rendition of the facts? Hot Coffee reveals what really happened to Stella Liebeck, the Albuquerque woman who spilled coffee on herself and sued McDonaldΓÇÖs, while exploring how and why the case garnered so much media attention, who funded the effort to characterize it as frivolous and to what end. After seeing this film, you will decide who really profited from spilling hot coffee.

ΓÇ£Hot CoffeeΓÇ¥ will knock you backward and change your perception of what you thought you knew. The film tackles the corporate demolition of this countryΓÇÖs civil rights system and the constitutional pretzel-twisting taking place to favor big business over those the system is supposed to protect.
