,Tom3511,2012-04-13T03:51Z,I have been trying to stick with .avi but thats becoming hard. Whats so good about .mp4?
,abai92,2012-04-13T03:56Z,"Thanks.

-@Tom3511 MP4 files a much smaller in size."
,Xorakka,2012-04-13T07:26Z,@Tom3511: It's outdated.

There is nothing good about .mp4s. 

All the uploaders are becoming lazy and can't deal with 20 more megabytes of data to upload so that we can have decent files that can actually be used on xbox or anything useful."
,Nummer,2012-04-13T10:43Z,"Instead of posting about how cappers are ""lazy"" and ""don't think about people who use .avi"" (which is just stupid, because .avi is just so horribly outdated). 
I'd just like to say; Thank you, EZTV, for providing me with a great show every week, which I wouldn't normally be able to watch! So thank you, EZTV, and keep up the good work."

,moza_en,2012-04-13T11:08Z,Thanks from Iran for this great show eztv. Senor Chang owns this show and i can't live without seeing him each week.thanks eztv you're the savior!
,Seutekop,2012-04-13T11:26Z,"@Tom3511 .avi is completely outdated. Give it two years and no one has heard of it anymore. .mp4 and .mkv will become more and more used.

@govermint don't be ridiculous. .mp4 files are smaller in size than .avi and yet the quality is the same. Also, .mp4 files needn't be converted for use on smartphones/tablets. Everyone has them these days and their screens are big enough to watch a decent show/movie."
,wertham,2012-04-13T12:52Z,thanks!
,Baguett,2012-04-13T19:34Z,".mp4 files is supported by many devices, but .avi is not very greatly expanded."
,tk9314,2012-04-13T19:43Z,"@Tom3511 you ungrateful bastard hahahaha

Jesus, dude asked a question, a valid one at that, way to bite his dick off.

And I agree with Tom, .avi is a good format for those of us who want to watch a show on a screen bigger than our hands.

Try ettv (http://thepiratebay.se/user/ettv/), they upload about the same shows and mainly in .avi format"
