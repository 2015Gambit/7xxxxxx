Take a trip back, before Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and SW:ToR to check out BioWare's first publication from 1996, Shattered Steel. Call it a MechWarrior clone if you must, but some people -like myself- find this game in a league of it's own. I'm uploading this because it was a childhood favorite, and I could never find a torrent for it after weeks of hunting. So, I purchased it from gog.com and decided to share it here :)
