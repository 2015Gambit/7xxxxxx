The popular racing franchise takes a hard swerve in a unique direction with Ridge Racer Unbounded, adding a punishing dose of destruction to the familiar arcade gameplay. Get ready to take the action off the circuits and into the streets for one of the most action-packed and destructive racing games ever seen. Players will careen through the competition using their four-wheeled street-racing thoroughbreds as high-octane wrecking machines with a new mantra - Drive, Destroy, Dominate.



Features:
-Crash through everything - Cutting edge physics and effects combine to bring direct destruction like you've never seen before. Unleash your rage to obliterate everything in your way and carve your own path.
