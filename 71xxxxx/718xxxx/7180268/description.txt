Narratives:

To dance, smile. These are the ambitions of clairementaffichTes Cyril Douay, mastermind group Montpellier The Chase. Dela pop, pop and even the pop: this is the agenda of this eponymous premieralbum produced by the talented Mark Plati, who has already put his pattesonore on disks of David Bowie, Rita Mitsouko, Louis Armstrong, The Cure, Alain Bashung or Charlie Winston. Certainly, the beautiful moments stand out from The Chase: the western pop "The Desert Way" and the final resting "Keep An Eye On That Line," and, of course, the single touttrouvT "Butterfly (In My Stomach)." Certainly, the group energy estindTniable, like his potential sympathy.
