Atomic Kitten are an English pop girl group formed in Liverpool in 1997. Consisting of members Liz McClarnon, Natasha Hamilton and Jenny Frost, the original line-up included Heidi Range (who would later join Sugababes) and Kerry Katona (who left in 2001 when she became pregnant). The group had three UK number one singles; Whole Again, the fourth best-selling single by a girl group of all time; "Eternal Flame", a song originally recorded by The Bangles, and "The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)", a song originally recorded by The Paragons and later by Blondie. They also had two UK number one albums, Right Now, a re-issue of their debut album, and Feels So Good, both going double platinum in the United Kingdom.
