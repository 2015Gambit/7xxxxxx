If asked to register your game online, choose "Register Later" or "No"

When installing, use the "Typical Install" - using the default install directory given

1. Use Daemon Tools to mount the ISO, MDF, and MDS files and open the virtual drive and run AutoRun.exe or setup.exe, whichever is given, to install in order

Note: 01, 02, 04, 05, and 09 must have both discs mounted at the same time
while installing

Remember: Renaming any of the MDS or MDF image files will cause mounting problems,
so just don't rename them.

2. Use the serial keys provided in "Serials"

Note: Some of the expansions have cracks included in the CD. Ignore them, you don't need them

3. After everything is installed, unmount all images mounted to virtual drives and delete all Sims 2 desktop shorcuts given from installations

4. Copy Sims2EP9.exe from the Crack folder and paste to the Mansion and Garden Stuff pack install directoryTSBin (C:Program Files (x86)EA GAMESThe Sims 2 Mansion and Garden StuffTSBin) and replace when asked

5. You will use the Sims2EP9.exe you just copied to run the game, so right click that and make a shorcut and put that shorcut on your desktop and run it to play

6. Enjoy!

Note: Before you play, realize that when you start up The Sims 2, it seems like it freezes on the intro video but you have to wait a long time. Don't worry it's not frozen, it just takes a long time to load. Then after it gets to the actual loading screen, it'll seem frozen again but it's not. Same for when you're starting a level for the first time.

This really slow loading only happens the first time you start it up. After that, it'll still seem like it's frozen but it takes a lot less time to load. Just be patient.

It took me a long time to put this together, please seed it for a while.
This is a large torrent (about 13 gb) and large torrents don't get seeders easily, so please share.

I tried to make this easy to understand for noobs, but if you still have questions, feel free to comment and I'll try to help you.
