,BossBadger,2012-04-15T04:02Z,I have to stop seeding right now but I'll start again in a few hours so don't give up on the torrent.
,Elizir,2012-04-20T22:05Z,"I'm having trouble with this one. I put in the crack but it doesn't replace anything. Then when I tried to enter the game trough Sims2EP9.exe, it ask for directX 9 (i have 11). Thanks"
,BossBadger,2012-04-20T23:36Z,"If it's not replacing anything then you put it in the wrong folder. Put the crack in C:Program Files (x86)EA GAMESThe Sims 2 Mansion and Garden StuffTSBin

So that's in the TSBin folder, which is in the Mansion and Garden Stuff folder, which is in the EA GAMES folder which is in your program files folder.

For DirectX, download this:

,Elizir,2012-04-21T00:03Z,"First of all, thanks for the reply.

Second, it was my fault since I over read the TSBin part. Turns out I didn't need the directX download. Thanks again and great torrent."
,BossBadger,2012-04-21T01:19Z,Oh no problem
,drakeluvr,2012-04-27T06:44Z,"Hello, and thank you for the great download. But I'm having a problem with it. I did everything you said to do in your instructions, and when I click the new shortcut link I get Failed to enumerate any DirectX9 compatible graphics adapters in this system! Please make sure you have a DirectX9 compatible graphics adapter and have installed the latest manufacturer provided driver. The application will now terminate..."
,drakeluvr,2012-04-27T07:15Z,"I checked, and I have updated my NVidia driver, checked my directX version (11) and it still won't work. I get that same error message, which is weird because I've played the Sims 2 and University before with no issues. Please help."
,drakeluvr,2012-04-27T07:25Z,Ah! Never mind! I did what Elizir did! I just had to redo the copy paste of the crack. XD
,BossBadger,2012-04-27T08:11Z,Lol yeah guys make sure you're reading the crack part carefully in the instructions. Don't let 'The Sims 2 Mansion and Garden Stuff/TSBin' slip your sight..
,jessicab17,2012-04-28T08:09Z,Hello i am still seeding the torrent i have download it but i still don't know which to install first please help me since i am new to downloading games so games have different methods to install it 
,jessicab17,2012-04-28T11:39Z,Never mind 4 get it i figure that the first on was the deluxe and thank you for the torrent i will keep seeding so the torrent will never die 
,BossBadger,2012-04-28T19:41Z,Yeah just install them in order and mount them using daemon tools. Thanks for seeding :)
,CorilinE,2012-04-29T06:39Z,I am putting the code in for the teen stuff pack and its telling me its wrong?
,CorilinE,2012-04-29T06:50Z,nevermind my fault read it wrong
,BossBadger,2012-04-29T07:42Z,lol
,IronBeard420,2012-04-30T14:11Z,"hiya, i'm having problemswith mine...i'm a bit shit at all this so forgive me lol. When i go to open a file a window comes up and say 'Windows cannot open this file' then gives me the option to choose from a list of programs or go online :s heelp !!"
,BossBadger,2012-04-30T19:20Z,"Lol I'm assuming you're trying to open a .iso, .mds, or .mdf file? You need to mount those to a ""virtual drive"" with daemon tools. A virtual drive is like an imaginary extra drive on your computer. So how do you put CDs in it if it's ""imaginary""? That's what ISO, MDS, and MDF files are for. Those three files are virtual versions of a CD. You mount them (mounting is like inserting a disk, but virtually) with the program Daemon Tools (you can find that program on this site) and then open the DVD drive they are mounted to to find the setup file. Btw, you can make these virtual drives with Daemon Tools. lol

With MDS and MDF files, they work together; so they both have to be mounted at the same time to work. When you mount one with daemon tools, it'll use the other automatically. And for them to work together, they have to have the same exact file name (with the extension name differing being an exception, of course).

Good luck"
,shadowfox555,2012-05-03T03:16Z,Hay i have demon tools but i cant open the iso files PLEASE HELP
,shadowfox555,2012-05-03T03:19Z,the wierd part is i got to download some of the files and started to play but then i quit to download rest and it dident work
,BossBadger,2012-05-03T04:20Z,"Lol whoa.. stopping the download and playing and then downloading again is not good... umm I'm assuming the problem is you didn't download it completely and your ISO file isn't complete. Download the entire torrent 100% and try mounting the ISOs again. Remember you mount the ISOs to a virtual drive and open the drive in ""Computer""."
,WeeOWeet,2012-05-03T16:40Z,"Hey, what if i didnt unmount all images mounted to to virtual drives?
I didn't do this cos I understand this
I skipped this step and I still can play the game,
so is there anything if I didn't do this?"
,BossBadger,2012-05-03T23:27Z,You don't have to unmount them but it's pointless to keep them mounted
,Fwalandra,2012-05-04T00:03Z,How would I go about adding custom content/downloads? Or can I even do that?
,BossBadger,2012-05-04T00:40Z,"Mods? You have to get .package files and put them in Documents/EA Games/The Sims 2/Downloads

If there isn't a Downloads folder, you can just make one"
,WeeOWeet,2012-05-04T10:22Z,"man, it load so long, any idea to make it fast?"
,BossBadger,2012-05-05T02:14Z,"After the first time you load it it should be faster. I don't know how to make it load faster, sorry :p

You could google it but there probably isn't a way"
,my_calate,2012-05-06T12:34Z,PLEASE HELP!
,my_calate,2012-05-06T12:35Z,"it's my fist torrentz, the download has just finished, what do i do now?"

,Bexamondo,2012-05-08T13:44Z,"HELP PLEASE!!! I'm stuck. I don't usually download games so I'm puzzled on what to do now. I'm on this page (the same one you're on at the moment), and I dont know what to click to download The Sims 2... HELP?! 
Can you show me through the steps?"
,whatdo,2012-05-12T20:17Z,Help! It won't let me copy the Sims2EP9.exe because there's no space left? I've tried just using the launcher which opens and then says I have the wrong CD and have to enter Mansion and Garden Stuff. What do I do?
,Free_Stuff_Please,2012-05-13T09:52Z,I'm having the same problem as the above. Please help?! :(
,swagandvans,2012-05-19T15:42Z,"i installed the sims 2 deluxe, question how do you unmount the images that are mounted to the virtual drive? im new to this stuff, and how do you do the stuff afterwards, please help!"
,irushe,2012-05-29T16:11Z,"@Bexamondo
go download utorrent or bittorent. just search it on google. after you installed it. click ""GET THIS TORRENT"". after that. your utorrent of bittorent will download this. after the download completes. just follow instructions.

@whatdo
just mount the Mansion and Garden Stuff if the crack wont work. then open the game.

btw. is there some seeders here? im afraid if ill start downloading it will took years :D"
,Atanih23,2012-06-03T18:44Z,"Hey BossBadger, I'm having an issue with this game. I know you've warned that it may not work with Vista 64-bit, but I tried to use it with Windows 7 64-bit anyway. I've tried troubleshooting to the best of my ability (Running with mansion disc mounted, running in compatibility mode, fiddling with graphics card and whatnot, etc.) but I'm having the issue still.

My issue is that everything becomes transparent when the camera is stopped. When it moves, however, it looks like normal. This is the *only* error I've encountered playing the game. Is there any way to fix this, or am I stuck with what I have?"
,missangel_1,2012-06-10T04:30Z,"Hi, Have a problem, when i click in Sims2EP9 gave me a error about my directx 9 , updated my directx 9, but is continuing. Can you help me :( ?"
,deadtroll,2012-06-13T06:42Z,"Is the only playable part of this torrent the Mansion and Garden stuff expansion? I tried using just the regular deluxe edition and it wouldn't open, but the Mansion and Garden stuff worked fine. "
,deadtroll,2012-06-13T06:49Z,"The exact error that I receive when I attempt to play just the Deluxe edition is ""Conflict with Emulation Software detected""."
,kmart21,2012-06-19T04:14Z,hi i downloaded this i am on step 4 i beleive the one when you cope the .exe in to the tsbin when i try it says not enough memory help plz by responding to kmartallstar@gmail.com
,Lena1399,2012-06-19T09:59Z,I installed sims 2 double deluxe but it said i need a real disk not some backup... What should I do???? Can some body tell me?
,IndigoPop,2012-06-22T17:38Z,"This torrent is absolutely fantastic. I had struggled to find all of the Sims 2 expansion and stuff packs for download, and at first I didn't want to just download all of them in one big set (I'm very impatient, haha). After little luck, I finally gave in and downloaded this torrent. I am so glad I did! It took less than a day to download, and the installation was extremely easy. So far, I have not experienced any issues with the Sims 2. Thank you so much for this awesome torrent, I'll be seeding this for a long while!"
,CrazyAaron84,2012-06-24T00:29Z,"only issue i had was when i initially tried to installed the ""teen style stuff"" pack... it wouldnt let me do it in order (#13), but i installed it after the apartment life update and before i installed Mansion and Garden stuff and had no issue when i did it then. haven't ran the game yet tho but ill post again if i come across any errors though i doubt i will... ty for upload!"
,CrazyAaron84,2012-06-24T00:49Z,"im getting the freezing thing the uploader was talking about lol... well ill be patient and see what happens...

as far as some of the other comments...
you have to use the crack file you placed in mansion and garden stuff, hence why the uploader worded the instructions they way they did! even if this wasnt cracked thats the way the sims games work, it uses the last expansion to launch the game!
and the direct x thing... just cause you have direct x 11 does not mean you have direct x 9!!! those are different versions of direct x! one does not get updated to the other like a software update! hence why vista and win 7 do not come with direct x 9, cause microsoft only includes the most recent version and not the previous versions! if you do not remember running the direct x update then you most likely do not have direct x 9!!"
,mariejones,2012-07-03T01:59Z,"Whenever I try to install Apartment Life, I get the error saying ""A problem occurred when trying to transfer the file 'E:TSBinSims2EP8' from the media."" with options to retry or cancel.

,Snuusnuuu,2012-07-03T07:22Z,@craigjacey - Yes. Installation went perfectly for me.

its installing now and it says its going to take about an hour but none of the instructions in the description seem to correlate to the torrent i downloaded.
confused as hell."
