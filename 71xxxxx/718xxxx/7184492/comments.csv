,sage1210,2012-04-15T05:30Z,"even buy a key still damn expensive. so you should give up about to buy it cheaper.

and honestly this game even now after many patched. this game still just a bugs nest.

still have ton of hackers, stutter, stupid ram leaking and waste a lot of bandwidth that cause from run game via web browser.

if you badly want to play this game. i recommend you play it on console version instead.

*this game death before start year 2011 in my region (Asia). today seem only play in North America region.   "

First of all.. This game is awesome..!!

If you want Multiplayer.. Buy the game.. 
Make sure you run it on a optimal system!!


I Think you are a real High-Class Noob Cupcake.. Frustrated because you cant work with this, and cant win! 

Game works 100% without stutter, Lag and other issues..

Ow yeah..  about ""Stupid Ram- Leaking..  Game Graphics looks almost like reality!  
Air-Jets crashing into other Vehicles.. without Death and Destruction is NOT realistic!

You are just a Noob cupcake..  cant handle a Battle[field]..      Here's my advise: Go play ""Super-Mario Kart..  or DUCK-HUNT..
