Game Notes:

Have you ever dreamt about working on the
apron and step into the shoes of a flight
controller to manage the schedule of an
international airport? Then its time you
tried the "Airport-Tower-Simulator 2012 by
astragon.

Be the one to take over the responsibility in
the tower and coordinate the taking off and
landing of the aircrafts. Not only are you
responsible for their flight schedule, but you
also have to assign them to the runway or
terminal. During your work, be as efficient as
possible and use your instruments  such as
radar  to guarantee a flawless clearance.
Its only the short waiting periods on ground
and the save handling of your maneuvers that
will bring you the points you need.

Next to fulfilling your missions thoroughly,
you can also enjoy the view from the tower:
here you can observe a variety of detailed and
animated aircraft-types, which you can watch
from near or afar. Moreover, you have the
possibility to tune in into the pilots
cockpits.

But watch out The longer you play, the higher
the traffic and the more challenging your
missions. In case of airplane collisions on
ground, or if your airplane gets out of
gasoline and needs to make an emergency
landing, your career will be over
immediately

But dont worry  thanks to a saving mode you
can restart your missions any time you want.
The "Airport-Tower Simulator 2012 will amaze
you with its 3D-graphics as well as a
realistic day-night-shift. Next to
preinstalled sceneries, you can create your
own airports and missions and even trade them
with other players with the airport-editor.

Good luck in the tower
