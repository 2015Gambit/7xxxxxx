But I must inform you (and others) that this is the badly cropped version of the film that was released on dvd as 'widescreen', missing a lot of picture info on top and bottom. Try to find the fullscreen version, as it does justice to the framing. I made a side by side comparison, and there is a hell of a difference.

But thank you for uploading."
