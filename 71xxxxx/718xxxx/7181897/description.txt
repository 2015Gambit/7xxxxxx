Meet Bharat, the Aam Aadmi, part time cashier    
and part time "Hanuman" at Ramleela, residing    
in the city of Bhopal where he lives with his    
father Shivnarayan, an old timer who values      
freedom and hopes to see a corruption free       
administration in the country. Bharat is         
married to Nisha a schoolteacher, loving and     
caring but doubting wife concerned more about    
Bharat's promotion from cashier to manager at    
the bank than his flying tricks at the 'Ramleela'
The small and happy family lives with a forced   
upon guest Amita, a young, beautiful girl who    
works at a call center, forgets her ID at home   
and likes to hitch a ride with Bharat on his     
scooter when he is not busy dropping his wife at 
school. Did I forget to mention, Bharat drives a 
Scooter, the sidekick of this story.
