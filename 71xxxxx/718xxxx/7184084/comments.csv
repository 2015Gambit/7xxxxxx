I have installed the Base game from Reloaded, and applied the crack that was provided and used the serial provided to run the game.... and then i close the game.   and then copy over these crack folders and files into the game directory... and i get nothing but the Blood Bowl splash screen when I double click, but nothing past that, the process shows up in Task Manager and then dissappears.... i take the original Crack folder and copy those files back over the new ones and can get Blood Bowl to work again.....     This update, these files, I can not get to work.   1. Has anyone else got this update to work?   2. Does anyone else have the same symptoms after they do this update?    3. Is there a different way to apply the update on the cracked game?
Thanks for any help."

1. Install the game.
2. Install the 2.0.1.4 Patch(Dowloaded Seperately).
3. Copy over the contents of Crack folder provided here, and play the game with the update."
