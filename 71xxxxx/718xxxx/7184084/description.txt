The game is a combination of a tactical game and a sports game The basics
are extremely simple: two teams, one ball. The team that carries the ball
into the opponent's end zone scores a touchdown, the team with the most
touchdowns at the end of the game is the winner. However, it's how you
decide to do this that makes things interesting, the ends justify the means
It's not just the players you have at your disposal either. You can bribe
the referee's to look the other way as you cripple or trample annoying
opponents and hire illegal wizards to give you a hand directly from the
crowd... Blood Bowl severely tests the finest tacticians' strategies. There
are many races to accommodate every player's profile (20 in the Legendary
Edition, 9 in the Standard Edition) and even more strategies for
experimenting. Winning a game requires a strong game-sense and a lot of
self-control. For the player's enjoyment, omnipresent humor and the use of
spells, weapons, and other non-regulatory means place Blood Bowl outside of
the classic sport simulation genre.
