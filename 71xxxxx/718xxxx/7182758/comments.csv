,Dimmis80,2012-04-13T17:01Z,Whats up my man Nepotu.Another great game that u uploaded.Good for u dude..Two of the best teams of the NBA play and lets see who is gonna prevail and stuff..I think that Miami has a lot of changes to win because of the quality of the big 3 but Chicago has a solid unselfish team-players not the bigest names exept Rose but they know how to win..We will see.Does Rose played in this game.?Cheers my friend to u and to your friends.
