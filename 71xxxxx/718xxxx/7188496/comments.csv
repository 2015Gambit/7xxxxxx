,AeroZoft,2012-04-16T01:13Z,"yah me also, it's the 700 I require for baking.I know of 700's but their of the fs9 class."
,_SnakEye,2012-04-16T07:29Z,"Why not just use iFly or PMDG Variant of the 700.. it's much better IMO and it supports updated AIRARC for the FMC , unlike the Ariane which doesn't."
