A Max Igan Film. Trans-Formation 1, The Easy Artistic Version

Can we transform the path of destruction into one of loving harmony. A heaven on earth?


This is the first phase of other videos to come. The next documentary in the series, to be made avaiable in around six months, will delve more into the scientific realm around us and more importantly, ourselves.

Be captured by the hope.
