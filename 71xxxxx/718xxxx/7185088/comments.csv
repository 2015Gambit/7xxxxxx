The Pixies was the most influential indie band of the eighties and nineties decades, a machine to produce alternately melodic noise and silence. Inventors of U.S. Indie Rock, created the model for all the bands that were to come. What happened with The Pixies? After seven years of existence (1986-1993) and five of the award-winning albums in rock history, the group broke up and swore, addictions and abuse. Twelve years later, in 2004, they met again. The documentary ""loudQuietloud"" follows them on tour this year, showing the backstage of this legendary band that swings between the mystical and divine reality not as protagonists."
