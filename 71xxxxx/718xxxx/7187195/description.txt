This is the client for Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO), an MMO that is currently Free-to-play (with account-level restrictions).
You can sign up for an account at http://lotro.com/

The method Turbine provides to download the game (through Pando Media Booster) has been giving some people problems, so this
is an alternate method of getting the game. This is the High Resolution client, for the Standard Resolution client go to http://www.lotro.com/support/download-lotro

Note: The client is universal (for both EU and NA) and is current as of the Isengard update.
