,efgenios,2012-04-16T21:51Z,"easy fix peope.... download both versions and play them simultaneously... then mute the audio on the italian one and watch the eng version... or better, extract the audio with Adobe Audition and then mix it in with movie maker.... simple as that.... the lamers who laugh at this are probably feltchers who are into self-anal satisfaction... dont reply to them, ignore those fags...

,smokey_pt2,2012-04-17T03:03Z,"Seriously its not that easy, if it were you would have been able to do it.
I took the 2 versions, and edited them, for a start the eng version has a couple of extra scenes which will throw you out, and secondly the compression used is different in both, its a pain in the ass to get it near perfect. Its only a solution to have them both run side by side if the film is started at the same point and does not have more scenes, not laughing at the ideas as this is essentially what you can do to get the audio right, but its not as easy as you would first think. So all those who ask for the eng audio on ita video, download the apps from google and try it yourself, it would be good for you and the community if you can do it, and reupload it, then you can do it in future releases."
,smokey_pt2,2012-04-17T03:06Z,And for the record this version has the best video so far.
,teamtianix,2012-04-17T13:33Z,"teo_bill1968 you sound like a complete dumbass the most important thing about reading is having the ability to which you dont have apparently he said ""TAKE THE AUDIO FROM THE ENGLISH VERSION AND PUT IT IN THE ITALIAN VERSION"" its basic video editing thick shit"
,smokey_pt2,2012-04-17T17:36Z,"Teamtianix, whilst Teo is a twat, if its basic, why haven't you done it yet? 

Before you take the piss, try it yourself, if its basic like you say, then put your money where your mouth is and make the copy, Im expecting a perfectly in synch audio for this version to be uploaded by you.  When it is we will all thank you.  

I have tried and as stated it really aint that easy, for a start they dont play at the same speed, as funny as that sounds its true due to the compression methods used, secondly the other factors are that the english version has extra scenes, so you will need to cut those bits out and then synch it perfectly.  Good luck you will need it, as well as a lot of time.  I will wait for your copy mate."
