PLAYSTATION 2 EMULATOR (PCSX2) + BIOS


READY TO PLAY!


The PCSX2 emulator for the Sony Playstation 2 is the most complete and functional PS2 emulator out there. Each new revision and patch enables more games to be run and improves on the stability and speed of the emulator. The great thing about this emulator is that you can insert your PS2 game straight into your CD/DVD drive and the emulator will allow you to play the game on your PC!

Emulators are only as successful as the games that run on them. The PCSX2 website provides a compatibility list of games which shows the games supported by the emulator. The status of each game on the list and its compatibility is colour coded for easy reading:

-Green is playable

-Blue you can get in-game but there will be odd bugs and crashes

-Yellow means you can enter the menus of the game but usually not the game itself
