Anyone want to talk about the show?

My prediction, in the end of the series, we find out he was the one who dies in the car accident and in ""the real world"" his wife and son lived on. "
,shinji1170,2012-04-15T17:37Z,"While I like Theambassador's theory about how the show will end, I kinda like the idea that he's in a coma and at the end of the series he wakes up with his son and wife still there, etc.  Otherwise excellent series.  THanks for the ULs :)"
,piratebus,2012-04-16T23:07Z,"A marvelous show, with deep implications and an unclear future

I'm personally opting towards the fact that the crash hasn't happened yet, i'm thinking he is in the process of crashing and rolling his vehicle and the dreams are more like the possible outcomes"
,analfabetic,2012-04-18T22:20Z,"Wow, you guys really think outside the box. As long as the end is as creative as your guesses im happy. 
And hopefully they wont drag on for several seasons instead of ending it with honour...

Great torrent btw!"
,random_97,2012-04-21T17:46Z,"All interesting theories about the ending. I think the reality is that the show is too smart for the average viewer. Not enough dick and fart jokes for those who have the Nielsen voter box.
In a world where a show like DWTS recap/rerun can beat a first run episode of higher quality; television is doomed. At least as we know it. 

As for my take on the show... I'd like to see what would happen if one of his waking selves was suddenly forced to sleep or wake. Example: he's shot with a tranquilizer and forced to the other world. Or he's forcibly woken up in one world and his other waking self is left to fall asleep - in the middle of a high speed chase. Something like that. It'd be interesting. 

At some point he will obviously run into someone who can move between worlds as well. "
,mattjhorobin,2012-04-24T11:18Z,I think that he is in a coma too but when he wakes up both wife and son are dead and he created the worlds in his subconscious  to suppress the guilt he has for killing them both. I love this show... and the dude from Harry Potter is almost unrecognizable as a American Thanx for seeding
