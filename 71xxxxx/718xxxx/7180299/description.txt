Quote:
The most violent criminal underworld in history! Finn and Egil, brothers - one bad, one worse - are trying to stab and steal their way to a seat at the table. Two men at war with the world around them. But today's the day the world fights back. From the writer of The Cross Bronx comes a crime book for the 9th Century.
