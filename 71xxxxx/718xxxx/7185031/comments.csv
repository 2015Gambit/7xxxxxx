DosBox it is certainly the less pratical game system to play the games with borring work many times to have the games prepared to be played and making monotonous the use of the games with the necessary unzipping , search for the executable and the check of the game , for not speaking in the normal DosBox way that it is needed a folder on the drive and the games mounted carefully ... all of this is over with the EasyDosBox using the games accessed in 1 click in a autorun tool with more than 850 games including a cheater program to increase even more the possibilitys to enjoy the gameplay of the games , the games run quickly in 1024x768 resolution and without the usual console window at the background during the gameplay ... never was so easy and nice to play dos games ... it was a pleasure and real worthy spending 15 days of hard work to make this tool ... now DosBox it is a game system easy accessible like any other game system with nice emulators running the roms from the menu , no more hard work to play the dos games ...

enjoy ..."

[V],globeplus,2012-04-14T18:33Z,"Quick notes to the less familiarizated users of the dos games on the pc :

many times on the start of the games the users are prompted to select the video type and sound , the best options are like this :

Video : VGA first then EGA but only if it is the case that the VGA option not available what can happen but not frequently

Audio : Soundblater 16 or other sound blasters normally no problem , Roland normally no problem too or PC Speaker ok too , any of this options normally safe to get the best possible sound on the games


Happy gaming ..."
