COACHELLA ( 2006 )

This movie  is awesome.  This is a great documentary on the first 5 years of the festival held annually in the southern california desert. If you love Coachella, or want to know   all about it ,   see this movie which  capture the feeling of the festival. . I think it's essential  enjoying it,  more now when Coachella is moving 
At least for me, that I've never been there , this was  the best way of experiencing the festival 
This movie isn't all about the music, here Drew Thomas  pay special attention to the people who go because  are the people who make the festival what it is,  is more about coachella as a whole, not just the bands,  and showing us  the audience  side in short, concise, and poignant glimpses.
I have never been to Coachella , but seeing this movie always made me want to go across America to be apart of it....
