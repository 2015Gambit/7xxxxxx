Thank you for downloading JLinux-12-4.15

Installation instructions:
=========================
Install the .iso file to a DVD-R (it's too big for a CD-R)

Or Install it on a 2GB Thumbdrive with UNetBootin:
 
http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/

Features:
========
XBMC and Serviio (A very flexible UPnP/DLNA client and server together)
Pre-configured BTGuard and HMA ProVPN 

** BTGuard is also pre-configured in the Network Manager OpenVPN Section **

Applications include: Vuze, Banshee, VLC, Chromium, Skype, much more... 

Command line aliases:

BTG = connect directly to a BTGuard Canadian OpenVPN Server
HMA = connect directly to a HMA Canadian OpenVPN Server 

Both are included but you will have to use your own username/passord for Pro VPN

Installers right on the desktop for Libre Office and Gnome

About this distro:

With ISPs, Government and Media interests working (sometimes together) against the free Internet...
This distro was put created to give real privacy back to the user.

Based on Ubuntu 10.04.4 (Lucid)
Kernel version: 2.6.32-41-generic #88-Ubuntu SMP Thu Mar 29 13:08:43 UTC 2012 i686 GNU/Linux
 
This was to avoid Gnome3, Unity and to prevent this distribution from looking like a phone.

Thanks, 

j

P.S. This version is still in testing, use at your own risk!
