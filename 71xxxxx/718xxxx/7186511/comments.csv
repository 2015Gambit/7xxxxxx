,DOHC-6,2012-04-16T19:33Z,"Please...what is the accurate frame rate of these files?
Is it Bluray 23.976 or PAL 25fps?
If it IS 25 why have the encoded files been altered from the original Bluray 23.976?"
,ImSoJaded,2012-04-18T20:39Z,"Movie quality: 10/10
Seeding: abysmal
I've been downloading this torrent for 3 days now, and I'm still only at 82 percent. :S"

,southak,2012-05-12T19:08Z,"POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT

Whichever fuckwit retard uploaded this has misnamed them. The file named as episode one is, in fact, episode three. How can anyone be so fundamentally stupid lord alone knows.

POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT"
,southak,2012-05-12T19:13Z,Forget what I just said my media player is up the complete swanny and played the wring episode. Apologies.
