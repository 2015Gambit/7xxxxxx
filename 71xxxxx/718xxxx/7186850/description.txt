Notes
Turn On Your Lovelight is the last song from set 1 of the 3/17/68 show. The majority of the songs from set 1 could not be salvaged due to technical problems that were partly due to "sound experiments" conducted on the master tapes during the production of Anthem Of The Sun. That's It For The Other One through to Feedback is the complete second set.
