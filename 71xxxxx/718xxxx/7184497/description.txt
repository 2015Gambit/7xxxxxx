INCLUDED GAMES

HALO: COMBAT EVOLVED

DEscriptION

Halo consists of an intense, story-driven single-player campaign and a multiplayer mode. The campaign is a good 12 hours long at the normal difficulty setting, and the dynamic nature of the battles, along with the multiple, well-balanced difficulty settings, gives it good replay value. The multiplayer component only supports up to 16 players and includes a bare-bones integrated server finder. The game tends to play smoothly online if you can find a server with a low enough ping, and it features an assortment of different modes, which are variations on the standard modes of play found in your typical multiplayer shooter: They include slayer (meaning, deathmatch), team slayer, capture the flag, king of the hill, and some others


HALO 2


DEscriptION

The epic saga continues with "Halo 2," the much anticipated sequel to the highly successful and critically acclaimed game "Halo: Combat Evolved." In this sequel, the battle comes to Earth, and Master Chief, a genetically enhanced super soldier, is the only thing standing between the relentless alien Covenant and the destruction of all humankind. Pushing the Xbox hardware to its very limits, "Halo 2" will expand on everything that made the original game great, plus add a wealth of technological and gameplay advances.
