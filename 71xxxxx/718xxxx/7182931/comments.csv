,IBeyond,2012-04-15T06:32Z,"Hey, I've tried a couple different torrents  and in all of them I can't see anything except particles, e.g. torch light, along with seeing the HUD.  No walls, no items, nothing.  I'm 100% sure my P.C. can handle it and my driver is up to date, any ideas?"
,NewWinter,2012-04-16T17:23Z,Great work ! gansuk is it possible to make il2 sturmovik 1946 ?
,james9946,2012-04-17T12:54Z,hello gansuk ihave one doubt what is the diffrent between gansuk files & ryzy
[V],gansuk,2012-04-17T21:42Z,"the ryzy torrents are our releases this person is just reseeding them, and from reading comments from other users he changes our releases removing our installer and other files sometimes missing files out required for the game to work. ""he does not work for us"" i would not bother downloading his torrents and stick to the gansuk account what actual kaos members use to post there rips. hes basically trying to make a name for himself by using ours."
