The second file doesn't have the index needed to play, its fucked, VLC will fix it if you have the correct versions, but still, basics and they are fucked up!!"

first of all,footballmal did not encode it,this was encoded by Pakman,so get ur facts straight.

Secondly,the 2nd half is missing roughly 17 MB,correct file size as encoded by Pakman is
472 MB.I downloaded the 2nd half from here -
