Any plans when its available????"
,cur37ious,2012-04-16T02:09Z,"Once you've created a torrent, can you go back and edit the title, TxJag?  If so, it'd help to put the author's name in it, though the series name is also very useful.  Unfortunately PirateBay search doesn't search descriptions, only titles. So, searching for Scott Mariani comes up with nada.  Which does mean, though, that you're the MAN, cuz you uploaded the whole series (so far).  For which I thank you profusely."
,TxJag,2012-04-17T17:15Z,"@paigerich That book wont be out until May. There are a lot of books I have that need updating and editing. So I upload books as I can. Right now ALL of my torrents are up to date. I have 1 book in my Scandinavian torrent that needs to be updated and when it gets the proper release in May as well then Ill get to it. Believe me, I prefer complete series books."
