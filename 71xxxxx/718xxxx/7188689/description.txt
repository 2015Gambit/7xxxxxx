"Pride Comes Before a Fall"

Pastor Tudor's rivalry with 
Reverend Steve has Amanda taking 
charge of a church musical that was 
written by Heather in high school. 
The GCBs come out of the woodwork, 
resulting in a sing-off between 
Carlene and Cricket. Meanwhile, 
Sharon takes her "Losing it with 
Jesus" weight loss program to the 
next level and recruits Gigi to 
help.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
