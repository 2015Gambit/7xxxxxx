This is a sharing community so share your upload please."
,mrme12,2012-04-17T00:07Z,yes the star game burner is well recommended! ive been fine now since ive used that. i got my old ip blocked 
,tonyanuk,2012-04-17T00:13Z,"Nis this not a real NTSC release?!!!  ye http://www.stargameburner.com is a must now days, old tho"
,zero423,2012-04-17T02:06Z,'stargameburner' is for bitchass faggots...we all know what we need to burn and its not that bullshit.. go spam somewhere else. thanks for the game unholychild
,unholychild,2012-04-17T04:26Z,"You don't need starburner for this. Your a fuckin troll and needs to die. Fuck any who says you need that shit and this is the real NTSC relase tonyanuk, you stupid fuck. All the free ones work just fine. Why spend money one shit you can get for free. bosbuil, mrme12, tonyanuk and bosbuil  need to be murdered. Don't give money to those fucks, They'll sell you something that's already free."
,collinsrv,2012-04-17T08:38Z,"you fuckin spammers, don´t listen to those idiots saying you need stargameburner to burn these disks, don´t even know wtf is that shit. 
YOU ONLY NEED IMGBURN, 2.0.6 OR LATER VERSION "
,collinsrv,2012-04-17T08:39Z,I MENT IMGBURN 2.5.6.0
,zero423,2012-04-17T17:30Z,"seriously, why is no one seeding? this is rediculous..average speed: 25kbs?? been d/l for 2 fuckin days..COME ON ALREADY! selfish motherfuckers, uncap your up speed and lets get this bitch going..."
,unholychild,2012-04-17T18:32Z,"Im seeding at 500kb/s. Please be Patient, the game is not going anywhere. "
,Leski,2012-04-17T21:54Z,"FAKE ????

the game release date its set 04/17

this torrent uploaded 04/15

wtf ???

anyone can confirm this real ?"
,unholychild,2012-04-18T00:01Z,I can confirm this is real you piece of shit. A lot of games come out before its released idiot. Leski is a pedophile. 
,cc178700,2012-04-18T00:05Z,"@ Leski:  You made me laugh out loud.  One of the best perks of using torrents is that you almost always get e games & dvdrips before they hit the streets.  It's not uncommon at all to see a game hit the net a week or so before the release date.  Someone out there has a way; don't ask ""wtf"" questions, you sound totally noobular.  Just say thanks and enjoy the fruits of others' labor!"
,unholychild,2012-04-18T00:06Z,"kevocon your a cunt. I don't have a seed box so I can only upload so much. If you want the game go buy it, it's out today or just be patient. Fucking scavengers."
,Leski,2012-04-18T00:34Z,@unholychild HAHAHAHAHAH
,unholychild,2012-04-18T01:23Z,"I'm glad that made you laugh, your now on my good side."
,collinsrv,2012-04-18T01:25Z,"@kevocon you got banned on live because you are a noob. and for all you fuckin spammers and complainers, you should be lickin unholychild´s hairy balls for this is the only working NTSC copy uploaded on this site"
,unholychild,2012-04-18T02:15Z,"Ha Ha Ha! how do you know I have hairy balls. Just kidding, glad you appreciate the upload. "
,unholychild,2012-04-18T04:28Z,"How come this torrent is being attacked by a bunch of spammers.  antaniuks you dirty bitch, the only way to get in to DownloadsLand is if you take a survey. And then you only get 1 hour to browse the site. I'm trying to give people something for free and you motherfuckers are trying to get people to spend money. Fucking dick-less bastards. "
,rodrg,2012-04-18T06:57Z,"finally!
thanks for the upload, unholychild. I'm dying to play this game.

Keep up the good work and thanks again"
,Methusul,2012-04-18T17:45Z,"So first off, im a huge fan unholychild I have downloaded many many of your uploads and have never ever had an issue. im running into an issue with the first dvd on this game, i keep getting an unrecognized disc error. if I put in the second disc first it starts just fine, i was able to then swapp over to the first disc and play for a few minutes and then it froze. I have reburnt the first disc 3 times, I have ran both of the dvd files  through abgx (even though there isnt a verified rip out yet)  I was wondering if you had any ideas? Like I said before I have many of your uploads and this is not my first game, just my first problem :)"
,Aktive16,2012-04-18T19:58Z,thanks unholychild this is the only torrent of this game on the net that I know about. And I do check on a few sites. Just waiting for it to finish. Currently at 47.9% in 23hrs. DLing is at 80kbs with an avg of 97.6kbs. To the people that finish DLing can you please continue to seed plz.
,unholychild,2012-04-18T20:53Z,"Sorry your download is only 80kb/s. If I had a better setup I'd seed faster, but glad you appreciate it."
,unholychild,2012-04-19T00:21Z,"@Methusul I'm not sure what to ell you. I did however burn 2 bad discs too, on a memorex. Then I used a verbatim and it was fine, but in the imgburn log while burning it said L0 sector (or something like that) not a capacity. so I let it finish and it worked fine. And every disc I burned for friends got the same reading but still worked. Sorry I can't help you with your problem, I've never had that exact problem. Anyways, hope you figure it out."
,leahjo,2012-04-19T01:32Z,"tonyuk, where can i get the star game burner for free? ive read some forum and a lot of guys saying you  need it now days? :/ please help me, thank you."
,unholychild,2012-04-19T02:46Z,"@leahjo, you can't be fuckin serious. Are you? Moron."
,RestlessMills,2012-04-20T18:45Z,"Great torrent, work perfectly. Thanks a bunch. Surprised it's not in the top 100. "
,unholychild,2012-04-20T20:24Z,I'm not in the top 100 cuz I don't have a pink or green skull next to my name. Ill only upload what hasn't been uploaded. Glad you appreciate it.

,babbleM,2012-06-10T03:15Z,"THIS WORKS. NO QUESTIONS ASKED. EVEN WITH A TRUNCATED BURN, WHICH IS WHAT I USED. I DONT SEE ANYONE MENTIONING WHAT THE SECOND DISC IS FOR, GAMEPLAY I SUPPOSE. JUST HAVN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR SO HOPEFULLY I DIDNT JUST BURN DISC 2 FOR NOTHING. "
