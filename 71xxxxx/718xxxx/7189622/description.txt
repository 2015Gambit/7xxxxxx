Titanic At 100: Mystery Solved
This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Titanic's sinking. This epic tragedy has been shrouded in mystery. We know an iceberg did it, but not how this legendary and supposedly unsinkable vessel broke apart so quickly and plunged to its icy grave on April 15, 1912. The sinking took less than three hours and around 1,500 lives. The History channel joined top underwater experts in an expedition to map out in exhaustive detail the entire wreck site, and made unprecedented new discoveries. Finally we will glimpse what truly went wrong in this century-old disaster. This exclusive two-hour special documentary will also reveal for the first time the complete picture of the ship's breaking and sinking by the use of a virtual hangar. Using space shuttle and aircraft accident investigation techniques, the experts have created a virtual holographic reconstruction of the wreck site in a hangar. While there are many programs on the Titanic, this one seems intriguing because of the focus on real-world evidence and scientific emphasis on analysing what went wrong.
