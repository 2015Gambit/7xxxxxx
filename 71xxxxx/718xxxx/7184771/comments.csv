Only this is this (and the Hawaii Vacation one) would not work on the PS3. Works fine on my pc, iPad, iPhone 4, etc. Every other of your rips have worked on the PS3. 

Not a big deal for me and I certainly appreciate everything you do. Just thought I'd give a heads up about it.  "
,mbunch,2012-04-15T20:58Z,nice!! thanks. looks amazing. have you come up with a 1080p handbrake preset yet?
[T],tr108,2012-04-17T23:08Z,"@luapttam85 thx for the heads up. Not sure why those two titles aren't working. Very strange (I didn't do anything different on those vs, say, the other Toy Story stuff, for instance.)

@mbunch I'll put a preset up in a few days, I think I got something that's at least OK"
[T],tr108,2012-04-20T20:39Z,"@mbunch - 1080p presets here:
