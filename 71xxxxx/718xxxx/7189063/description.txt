S02E02: The Bank of America Robbery 

Stuart Buckley, the bankΓÇÖs electrician, acted as part of the gang who raided MayfairΓÇÖs Bank of America. The raid took place on 16 November 1976, at the Bank of America in Mayfair, London. 

Key evidence in the trial came from Stuart Buckley, the "inside man" who turned police informant. Buckley, who worked at the bank as an electrician, told officers the raid was the gang's second attempt. They had previously tried unsuccessfully to drill through the bank vault's lock. Buckley finally obtained the combination by hiding in the roof space above the vault door and peering through a hole in the ceiling as officials opened it. 

7 men received jail terms totaling 100 years. However, the man said to have masterminded the plan, Frank Maple, escaped justice by fleeing abroad. Only ┬ú500,000 of the haul was ever recovered.
