Colin Murray presents highlights of the day's Premier League action as champions Manchester United met Aston Villa at Old Trafford.

Sir Alex Ferguson's side continue their pursuit of a twentieth league title against a Villa team they beat 1-0 in December. Villa's Premier League security is still not assured - their form has dipped lately and manager Alex McLeish will be hoping for some joy - but at Old Trafford, picking up points is never easy. There is also another chance to catch up with all the goals and incidents from Saturday's games.
