Motor Ace were a great Aussie rock band active from about 1999-2005. 

I had a really hard time finding these albums online so I ripped them myself for the good people of the internet. While I don't have a problem with piracy in general, if you like this band (or any band, really), and find their albums in stores, don't hesitate to pick them up.

This torrent contains the following albums:

Five Star Laundry (2001)
Shoot This (2002)
Animal (2005)

All ripped at 320kbps MP3 using MediaMonkey, volume levelled and with embedded front cover album art.
