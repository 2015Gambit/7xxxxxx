*****How it works?*****

Your computer is assigned an IP address by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) when it connects to the Internet. An IP address is an Internet Protocol address, a unique identifying number. It is what enables you to do things like sending a message in a chat program to another computer, and out of all the millions of computers in the world, it arrives at the correct one.

However, since it is used to identify all the different computers and websites on the Internet, it could be used to track your communications with all websites or programs that connect to the Internet. This is known as Direct Internet Connection.

When you run Hide IP Easy on your computer, it will modify your Internet Connection Settings, telling your computer to make connections through a Fake IP Relay provided by Hide IP Easy instead of through Direct Internet Connection.
