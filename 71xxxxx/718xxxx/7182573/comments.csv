,BigUglyMotha,2012-04-14T18:28Z,Stuck too ! Can we get a skull to upload this fantastic torrent ?
,Conkerballs,2012-04-15T01:36Z,"Its coming very slowly, like a tantric whore.

Why only fits and starts, leper lovers?"
,Astrapoth,2012-04-15T11:03Z,"I'm the only seeder for this on TPB. It's on 4 trackers:

http://tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce

udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80

udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80

udp://tracker.ccc.de:80

and I only have a 120kb/s upload speed. You will get it, in time."
,Conkerballs,2012-04-15T13:54Z,Thanks Astrapoth. I'll try to be patient.
,Finishwhatustarted,2012-04-15T17:00Z,"Yep, stuck at 88.2% with 0 seeds and every other downloader looks to be at the same point as me.  Not 1 of the leechers has been able to complete this torrent.  I appreciate the uploaders effort, but damn man stay connected till at least 1 person completes it.  I grabbed this torrent 9 minutes after it was uploaded, and the same group is still here with me waiting. Estimated time of completion:  infinity.  That being said, I've been waiting for someone to upload this. Thanks."
,pondpaul,2012-04-16T17:28Z,"I did get this complete last year but the reason for very few seeders with it complete is that over half the MP3files do not play, they all break the 256 limit to a file name.
so in order to get it to play you have to shorten the file name so  the length is under 256 and then utorrent cannot find the files to upload as they are different to what it expects.
This 256 limit scuppers a lot of files when you need to change them in order to play them and cannot then seed them"
,pondpaul,2012-04-16T18:27Z,"Hi again

i have gone back to my disks and i think I have added the missing pieces for you to finish it"
,pondpaul,2012-04-16T18:30Z,i have found the missing pieces and added them
,Finishwhatustarted,2012-04-16T23:31Z,Thanks to the uploader. Finished earlier with about 90 other leeches.  Half have hit and run.  Will seed for a couple of weeks. Worth the wait.
,pondpaul,2012-04-17T00:11Z,"Thanks

it was good seeing everybody with 99.6% and I worked out how to do change the names from my download last year to exactly the same names for the 5 files that were missing, and everybody was going to 100% quickly with me just putting these file changes into the download folder"
