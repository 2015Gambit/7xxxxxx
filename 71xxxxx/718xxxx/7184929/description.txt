SYNOPSIS:  
Robert Bressons incomparable tale of crime and redemption follows Michel, a young pickpocket who spends his days working the streets, subway cars, and train stations of Paris. As his compulsion grows, however, so too does his fear that his luck is about to run out. Tautly choreographed and crafted in Bressons inimitable style, Pickpocket reveals a master director at the height of his powers.
