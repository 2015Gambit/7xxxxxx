,disimagery2,2012-04-15T20:50Z,"i think this is a bit mis-labeled...
a FULL dvd is uncompressed - a DVD9.
these ones you have been putting up have been compressed [while keeping some of the extras and whatnot] - they are not actually full but squooshed/compressed versions - DVD5s from DVD9s."

disimagery2 .... With all respect .... !

The expression "" A Full DVD "" 
has nothing to do with compression .... !

.... As long as the uploader keeps everything from 
the source DVD .... ( Bonus-material, Menus, etc),
then it's uploaded as a ""Full DVD"".

I see nothing wrong with Auge's description."

,disimagery2,2012-05-19T03:22Z,"you can call anything whatever you like of course... especially here in piratelandia, eh -
but for phuk sake at least let's call a dvd which has had nearly 1/2 of its main movie video info removed [compressed] what it is - a compressed dvd.
It may contain some compressed version of all the original DVD9s info but it for sure should not be called 'FULL DVD' - or at least put the compression info somewhere in the post -
or not - whatevahz...
'film buffs' will appreciate non-compressed DVD9s a whole lot more [pun intended]."
