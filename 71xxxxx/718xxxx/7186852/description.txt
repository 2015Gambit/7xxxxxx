- INFO:
Queen is a British rock band formed in London in 1971, originally consisting of Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), John Deacon (bass guitar, guitars, vocals), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works, incorporating more diverse and innovative styles in their music.
By the early 1980s, Queen was one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world.
In 1991, Mercury died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since then, May and Taylor have sometimes performed together, including a collaboration with Paul Rodgers.
The band has sold over 150 million albums, with some estimates in excess of 300 million albums, making Queen one of the world's best-selling music artists. 
They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.
