After little configuration map is working fine.
It has maps for North America + central Europe and Middle East. 

Originally map is set to work in 800x420 resolution.
I had to configure it to work with 420x272 resolution of my GPS.

To do so you have to:
1. in sys.txt file set the resolution_dir=""480_272""
2. in ui_igo9 subfolder duplicate the 800_480 folder and rename copy to 480_272
3. in subfolder ui_igo9480_272 edit images and change resolution to 60% of the original size
Enjoy! 

Thanks"
