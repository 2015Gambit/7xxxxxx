 In Nov 2010, a group of friends went to     
 a place to shoot their final year project   
 film but never returned.A few days later,   
 their camera was found.What happened with   
 them was captured in the camera. The film   
 is a compilation of the footage found       
 from their camera.This is the first time    
 not only in Indian Cinema but world over    
 that a film is being released without a     
 title. Instead, to describe this unseen,    
 unheard story, all that is used is a symbol,
 ΓÇ£?ΓÇ¥ .It delves into the found footage genre 
 where the lines between reel and real become
 difficult to distinguish.
