[T],Hyperdrive25,2012-04-13T21:34Z,"@pir8s003: The Trial lock app is the crack.

It is there in the package (ESET5 TRIAL LOCK). You extract it to the folder of your choice and run it and the trial will remain locked 4ever.

But be sure to DISABLE Eset's antivirus and antispyware protection before you run this app.

Or run the app in SAFE mode."

[T],Hyperdrive25,2012-04-21T22:19Z,"@pir8s003: Sorry I included the wrong crack. I Have uploaded a newer Purefix activator.

Download my new torrent, extract and run it in SAFE mode."
,chris6t9,2012-05-21T19:57Z,"The purefix activator stops the stockwatch working on www.moneyam.com, so im guessing this fix does something to your java? How do i fix this so that it works.

But because I trusted you, I will give this one a go.

Will report later on. Thanks."
,kentcave,2012-08-06T12:22Z,"Updating the virus database now.
So far so good.
Will see what and how it perform.
So far not hogging memory and bandwith.
Thanks in advance. Laterz."
,kentcave,2012-08-09T04:34Z,"Deactivated!
What an intrusive program and resource-hog!

Sacrificing 20-30% of your valuable computing resource for protection is like throwing away 1k in a 3k built-up. Not worth it at all.

Panda is lighter, even that was overkill. Live and learn your passion and be independent for life.
Thanks for confirming the unnecessary need for useless protection.
(Aggravating need of changing between safe-mode, for activation and deactivation. Also, cleaning the ekern and the rest is a job into itself, worse than clearing viruses lol)"
