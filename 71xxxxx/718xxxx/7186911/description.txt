Tail for Sale (Classic XXX 1989)

Barbara Dare, Faith Turner, Buck Adams, Fifi Bardot, Sharon Mitchell, Don Fernando, Keisha, John Martin

Keisha and Barbara Dare run a big-money cat house, servicing all of L.A.'s high rollers and pay-to-play sugar daddies. Aside from this premise, Tail for Sale is a little short on story until the end. Most of what we get are long, luxurious shots of the girls applying their trade. And that's just fine, especially when Sharon Mitchell and Don Fernando hook up for some serious horizontal hustling. In the film's final 20 minutes, we find out that each of the girls has been servicing their co-workers' boyfriends. Then everybody has a good laugh and launches into a six-person orgy in the bordello living room. How romantic!
