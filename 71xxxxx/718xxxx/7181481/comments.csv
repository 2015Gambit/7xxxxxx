I downloaded Avatar in 3d by accident, too, and it was just bad color, not split. Well, I shared back almost 2.5 what I took even though I can't watch this, I don't do 3d, no 3d glasses anyway. Just noting this for anyone else to see.. it is a split screen of two small movie images, so you know what to expect."
