How else to explain the feelings these dreams provoke in himΓÇönot disgust, not horror, but excitement.

As Bryan and his longtime partner, Lawrence ΓÇ£PookieΓÇ¥ Chang, investigate the murders, they learn that things are even stranger than they at first seem. For the victims are all enemies of a seemingly ordinary young boyΓÇöa boy who is gripped by the same dreams that haunt Bryan.

And Bryan and PookieΓÇÖs superiorsΓÇöfrom the mayor on downΓÇöseem strangely eager to keep the detectives from discovering the truth.

And as Bryan learns the truth about his own intimate connections to the killings, he discovers that those who matter most to him are in mortal dangerΓÇªand that he may be the only man giftedΓÇöor cursedΓÇöwith the power to do battle with the nocturnals.

Featuring a dazzlingly plotted mystery and a terrifying descent into a nightmarish underworldΓÇöalong with some of the most incredible action scenes ever put to paper, and an explosive, gut-wrenching conclusion you wonΓÇÖt soon forget ΓÇö Nocturnal is the most spectacular outing to date from one of the genreΓÇÖs brightest stars.
