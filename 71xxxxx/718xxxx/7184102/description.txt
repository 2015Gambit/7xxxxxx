Accuracy and timing will be your only allies as you patrol the dangerous waters near Pearl Harbor in a boat armed to the teeth with torpedoes, lasers and nukes! When you spot a ship crossing the screen, it will be your job to make sure it never reaches the other side. Your skills will improve over time as you learn to use mines to destroy clusters of boats, acquire faster and more powerful weapons, and earn bonus points and extra lives! Do battle in broad daylight or at night, master 10 types of missions, and build a reputation as the terror of the seas in 120 campaign levels. Stunning water and battle effects will keep you glued to the screen as you guard 13 locations, man five unique ships and turn nearly two dozen enemy craft into Swiss cheese. Like a classic arcade game, Pearl Harbor: Fire on the Water will grab you and not let go as you pull out all the stops to beat oneΓÇª moreΓÇª level!
