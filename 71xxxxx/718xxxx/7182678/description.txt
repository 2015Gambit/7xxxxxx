In 1978, I was a music director at a large midwestern rock FM radio station and the CBS Records rep shows up with the Journey Infinity album.  After a quick listen the tracks Lights, Feelin' That Way and Wheel in the Sky immediately went on the air and the phones lit up.

The CBS rep also brought one of the more interesting promotional items I'd ever receivedΓÇªa pair of white "short shorts" with the Journey logo on the side.  Seems that Steve Perry was wearing these while he performed in concert and the girls loved it.  I tried my shorts on and immediately understood how he could hit all those high notes! 

After struggling to break nationally, Journey, with the addition of Steve Perry, rocked out and became one of the most popular rock bands of the late 70's to the mid 80's.

Here is Journey, The Steve Perry years 1978 - 1986.  Six complete albums plus some singles from the same timeframe found on their Greatest Hits CDs.

Presented in Apple Lossless.  All tracks were converted using XLD for those of us who use iTunes on Apple products.  It is true lossless so you are getting the best.

Enjoy!
