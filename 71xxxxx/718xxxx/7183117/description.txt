[color=purple]Currently watching, as it just started. I thought I would do a first-episode review. I was randomly on my regular anime website when I had seen this on the list of updated anime as the first episode and was like "ehhh.. ill give it a try" and boy am I glad I did![/color]

[color=purple]This appears to be just the kind of anime for me. The characters are weird and make you want to hug them (or at least I want to hug them... even if its after only one episode). I am actually upset that I found this anime so early on... because now I have to wait for the other episodes to come out.[/color]

[color=purple]I can't really say much about the story, however the direction it appears to be going in is nice and it was a great first episode. The art is fantastic, in my opinion and is very vibrant. Everything appears to be very nice.[/color]

[color=purple]I say give it a shot, its pretty great![/color]
