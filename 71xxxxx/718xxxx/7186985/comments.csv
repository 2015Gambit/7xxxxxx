TANKED"", a six-episode series, dunks viewers into the high-decibel, family-owned business of Acrylic Tank Manufacturing (ATM), one of the country's leading and most successful builders of aquariums. Led by brothers-in-law (and business partners, best friends and rivals) Brett Raymer and Wayde King and housed in a state-of-the-art, cavernous facility located in the center of Sin City, ATM literally has created thousands of enormous, conceptual aquariums for high-profile clients. Working with opinionated and outrageous family and staff, Brett and Wayde take on jaw-dropping aquarium builds, from such intricate and interesting locations as inside restaurants, casinos, banks, hotels, churches, offices, mansions, museums and zoos. Their tanks are for celebrities and ordinary Joes, and their aquariums and their business are filled with the most unusual...and larger-than-life creatures in the world. (Source: Animal Planet)
