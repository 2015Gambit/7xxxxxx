The Woman in Black

From BBC Radio 4 Extra. Written by Susan Hill; Full-cast dramatisation starring Robert Glenister, John Woodvine, Jane Marlow, Jason Done and Paula Tilbrook; Dramatised by Jon Strickland.

Eel Marsh house stands alone, surveying the windswept salt marshes beyond Nine Lives Causeway. Once, Mrs Alice Drablow lived here as a recluse. Now, Arthur Kipps, a junior solicitor with a London firm, is summoned to attend her funeral, unaware of the tragic and terrible secrets which lie behind the house's shuttered windows.

It is not until he glimpses a young woman with a wasted face, dressed all in black, at the funeral, that a sense of profound unease begins to creep over him and take hold, a feeling deepened by the reluctance of the locals to talk about the woman in black or what happens whenever she is seen.
