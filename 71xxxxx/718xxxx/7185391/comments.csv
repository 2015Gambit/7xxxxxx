,bktheman,2012-04-15T03:12Z,"@rahulroy9202
i think this might do u right..
i've used it... good quality i'd say.. why waste the time for re-encoding the same thing ;)
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7115832/The_Walking_Dead_-_Complete_Season_2_480p_Web-DL_.MKV_x264
all epis play fune.. but if u try to reencode/convert them... 4th & 5th episodes will give u trouble..
(i used Bob's torrent for those 2 episodes...)
hope this helped"

thanks buddy.... but u see- 
the average size per episode of that torrent is 280mb except for these two
-
03 Save The Last One.mkv	163.7 MiB
09 Triggerfinger.mkv	150.96 MiB

but every upload of bzingaz to date is the perfect balance between size and quality....

that's why I request him for 

The Walking Dead season2 episode 1-6 BY BZINGAZ"
,bktheman,2012-04-15T17:44Z,"umm well.. usually i ASK for the same..
the common file size is 350mb...
so compared top that this is small right?

but the main reason..
is that this series has only few episodes..
so... torrent is small why care for the file size?
dude i downloaded this with a 50kbps connection
(takes 9 hours to download 1GB 
so.... yah shit happens)
just helping a fello dude that's all
no offense "
