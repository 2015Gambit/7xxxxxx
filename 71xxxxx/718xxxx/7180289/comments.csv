It is called being a connoisseur

I myself some time ago uploaded 720-1080p version of season 2 this is an upgrade

Next time you search at the piratebay type by size and you will get high quality on top

Search for star wars the clone wars then sort by size

Anyway to the question of 1080p Season 3 and 4 the answer is maybe :)"
,lord_nan,2012-07-26T20:57Z,"Hi, do the chapters come with subtitles and/or multilanguage?"
,CakeMonster,2012-07-27T19:32Z,"@lord_nan 

Not to my knowledge, maybe if you google subs, but I doubt it :)

The only thing that has multi language is the first movie of Season 1 that I uploaded it has russian as well :)"
