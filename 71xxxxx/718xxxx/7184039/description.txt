This is my collection of the band BONDAGE. I am actually friends with the main guy who creates this music Terry StillborN and have been hearing his new material to be released this year (2012) and OMFG is it ever fantastic. I can't wait till it's released, but in the mean time I thought I'd share some earlyer material from BONDAGE for those of you who are already fans and for new people to check it out. 

If you like industrial music such as Ministry, skinny puppy, Manson, Rammstein, my life with the thrill kill kult, frontline assembly etc you will like this!!

I'm missing a few releases, but I will get a copy off Mr.StillborN and upload them when I get them. I will try and see if I can convince him to give me a copy/sample of his new material for you guy's also but I can't promise anything for he would only let me hear it at his studio but I will try. 

Included in this torrent is 

BONDAGE - Machination  (released 2007)
BONDAGE - FreeDumb single (released 2008)


If you like this music you should support BONDAGE by adding yourself to their new facebook profile and also their youtube/myspace/ect if you got em :)

Would also be a good idea to maybe buy this from him if you enjoy it and support independent artists.
