Release Notes:
--------
Underwater Sunshine is a testament of a band geek-obsessed with music. 'There's
a million great songs written every day that you discover, and wish your friends
could appreciate as much as you do,' says singer/songwriter Adam Duritz. 'These
songs come from bands young and old, stretching from the early 60s to last year.
They're all great and will hopefully be heard by a few more people now.'

Produced by Counting Crows and Shawn Dealey, Underwater Sunshine features tracks
written by artists such as Big Star, Gram Parsons, Tender Mercies, Kasey
Anderson and The Faces. Each rendition offers an entire spectrum of human
emotion, delivered with the conviction and intense honesty the band is known
for.

As their first independent release, it was the right time for the Crows to make
this album. 'If you wonder why we didn t just write our own record, it s simply
because we wanted to do THIS one,' says Duritz, We now have the creative freedom
to release albums like this and offer our fans more music than ever.'
