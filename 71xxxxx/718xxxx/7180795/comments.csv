Tip: you can download the demo from spidweb directly and copy the cracked .exe's into the install folder.  I have confirmed this works, and only downloading those files in the torrent took about 10 seconds."

,s1raz1,2012-04-13T18:45Z,"kinda hard to give u any help, since u dont post ur PC specs.
Otherwise turn off V sync on ur graphics window options, also games from this studio tend to choose open GL over directx."
,phyke,2012-04-13T19:43Z,"Sorry about that.  Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit, 4GBs DDR3 RAM, Nvidia GTX 465, combined total of 3.25TB of HDD space in three drives.

I've tried doing everything I can think of.  The original .exe's work, but the crack ones black the screen, thus making it impossible to get to the options menu.  Even messing with the compatibility modes have no affect.  I'm starting to greatly dislike force restarting."

,iornix,2012-04-18T07:09Z,"There's a keygen out there (Avernum​.Escape​.From​.the​.Pit​.v1.0​.Keymaker​.Only​-DELiGHT) that works. Virustotal and jotti shows that AVG and Trendmicro flags it as a worm. Might be a false positive but you can run it through a sandbox(such as sandboxie) to be safe.
