,evilcarnie,2012-04-13T05:42Z,the pictures are poor quality in this pdf file. It looks like they scanned a book page by page but the information is very good and detailed. It covers several carbs. I thought it had a very detail descrition of the operation of the carbs.  this was a great site for vw info too  http://www.vw-resource.com/  and the search by index
