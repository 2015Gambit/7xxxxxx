anyhow, I installed and did everything as you Airected. But when I try to run Dreamweaver, my system will black out and restart automatically. There is usually a blue screen with an error warning that I cant read because it doesn't stay for long. 

I downloaded a fresh copy from Adobe's site and it was the same problem. Even used some keygens I downloaded here; the same problem. have any idea why this is so?

BTW, I was using CS5 before. I uninstalled completely before installing CS5.5.

Thanks. "
