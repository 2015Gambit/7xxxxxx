When building a website or programming I prefer to use code editors like notepad++

But if you want to save time when coding, DreamWeaver is for you!

It's pretty simple to install. Follow the simple steps.


1) Instal the app in trial mode (no serial required as it's a trial).

2) Go to the DLL folder and copy the dll file and paste & replace the ones 
   in the CS5.5 program directory, eg copy and paste and replace to here;


C:Program Files (x86)AdobeAdobe Dreamweaver CS5.5

and/or

C:Program FilesAdobeAdobe Dreamweaver CS5.5


Once that's done, you have DreamWeaver. Hope you have fun!
If there's any problems, please let us know and we will fix it asap.
