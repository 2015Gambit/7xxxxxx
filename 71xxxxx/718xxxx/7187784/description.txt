a fully complete savegame file for tekken 3 for use with the pSX emulator

this is fully working with my PC release of tekken 3 too


simply put this file in the emulator directory in the cards folder, then open psxfin.exe and go to file, configuration, then on the memory cards tab select this image as card slot 1.
