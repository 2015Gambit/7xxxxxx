,sa23,2012-05-02T10:35Z,I have tried doing this on my pc.. i dont see all characters even after updating the memory card slot :(
,Gleeze1,2012-05-02T23:30Z,"after you update the memory card, you need to load the game in tekken in options, and if it still doesnt read the card then you must not have done it right

make sure you

1. place tekken_3_a.bin into the folder for cards

for my tekken game release this is C:NAMCOTekken 3cards

2. open psxfin.exe, and click on file, then configuration, then go to memory cards tab, and then load the file tekken_3_a.bin instead of mem1.bin, then close psxfin, and launch the game, it should recognise it then."

,Gleeze1,2012-08-15T17:55Z,"yes, you are right, i have a fixed card now, but i dont think a torrent is the best way to distribute it since its such asmall, and not really searched for file

email me anyone who wants the working save file, and i will attatch the file to you in reply"
