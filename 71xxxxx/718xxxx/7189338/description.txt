After emerging from Boston in the late 50s, already obsessed with Spanish guitar, Walker hit San FranciscoΓÇÖs folk scene. His musical outlook was swivelled by a Ravi Shankar concert and his friendship with fusion master Sandy Bull, resulting in extensive travelling to source locations such as Algeria, Morocco, Spain and Grenada. While continuing to explore the link between flamenco and Indian music, Walker also became Timothy LearyΓÇÖs musical director at the acid guruΓÇÖs Millbrook estate in 1965.
A popular mainstay of the 60s Massachusetts and Greenwich Village scenes, Walker gathered a group including veteran folk session percussionist Bruce Langhorne (DylanΓÇÖs Mr Tambourine Man) and guitarist Monte Dunn, plus Alex Lukeman (12-string drone), Jean Pierre Merle (tamboura) and Peter Winters (om) to record Rainy Day Raga over four sessions at VanguardΓÇÖs NY studio. Moods range from the rippling tranquillity of Spring and Sunshine to full-on escalating raga action on Road To Marscota, bells-enhanced Morning Joy and transcendental title track. A balm of a set.
