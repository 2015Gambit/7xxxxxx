Here's the cabin music from Mass Effect 3.
The OST/music CD doesn't have them so here you go.

It's .OGG because I extracted them from the game, no processing done.
(Exception to the credits music)

Maybe I'll repost in MP3 if people want, but since converting from OGG to MP3 seems easy to me I just posted like this.
