,Kilamite,2012-05-26T12:33Z,"Keymaker works fine and generated valid serial.

@ recon1301, open Terminal and type:

chmod +x AND THEN DRAG THE KEYMAKER FILE INTO THE TERMINAL WINDOW

If you do that, you should get something like:

chmod +x /Users/UserName/Downloads/VMware.Fusion.v4.1.2.MacOSX.Incl.Keymaker-EMBRACE/keymaker

If so, hit return.

Then, go back to the folder with the Keymaker file and open it."
