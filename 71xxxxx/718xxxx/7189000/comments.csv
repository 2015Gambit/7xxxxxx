Thnx"
,Dwollsch,2012-04-25T06:57Z,"Thanks so much for this Tduckin, I'm looking for something I'm hope you might be able to help me with.  I'm desperatly searching for any and all books by Juliet Marillier.  Can you help me with that?...Thanks Again so much"
,lindseyluber,2012-04-28T05:33Z,Anyway you can get all 3 books in PDF? Thanks.
,Truebie4Life,2012-04-29T18:48Z,"Tduckin, could you please get the following ebooks in the .Mobi format: ""White Oleander"" by Janet Fitch, ""Stir Of Echoes"" by Richard Matheson, and ""Suckers"" by Anne Billson? If you can only get these ebooks in the .epub format, that's okay too. I'll just convert them w/the Calibre freeware but I prefer them in the .Mobi format since the converted ebooks often have glitches. I also prefer the .Mobi format b/c I read most of my ebooks on my Kindle on my P.C & smartphone. Either way, I'd still be very appreciative of them and would like to thank you very much for taking requests and for your time and energy! That's very kind of you! =)"
,snuffyboots,2012-05-03T05:01Z,"Another request, and thank you so much for this upload!  My girlfriend and I have been looking for the sleeping beauty trilogy written by anne rice's pen name, A.N. Roquelaure.  Any format is fine, pdf prefered.  And seriously, thank you for your fine work :)"

,SugarMagnolia,2012-05-06T05:54Z,"For all requesting a certain format: D/L ""calibre"" it's free. It's a multi-purpose reader that can also convert any e-book to your desired format. Plus you can email book files right from the app.
Happy Reading"
