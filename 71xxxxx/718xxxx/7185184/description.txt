- Fixed RSBot, Epicbot, and Simba runtime error
- Epicbot updated to v.1.6.9
- Preview scripts now available for RSBot

* Simba scripts can be found here: http://villavu.com/ *


This is a compilation of all of the most functional RuneScape macros and bots as of April 12, 2012. I have included instructions on how each bot is to be set up for best performance & results.

I take no credibility for any development of the bots featured in my compilation. I did however, include every script that I have personally purchased up to this date. The scripts that I have purchased can be found in the RSBot folder, as RSBot is the client that the paid scripts will work for.
UPDATE: I will re-include the scripts when they are functional. RSBot is currently in its beta stage of development, rendering all scripts nonfunctional.

The bots featured in my compilation are as follows:

RSBot
EpicBot
Simba

Upon the completion of your download, please make sure to seed, and leave feedback for how I can make future improvements to it's organization/addition of more paid scripts/etc.

Thank you & stay tuned, as I will be making consistent releases to keep up with the flow of bot & script updates. Please bookmark my profile to be notified of my releases!
