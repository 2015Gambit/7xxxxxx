Tyler Crawley and his friends, who have been the best of buddies 
for more than a decade, but now they're changing - getting married, 
getting promoted, going bald, going insane. During a male-bonding 
weekend, they will discover a spectral corridor through the woods - an 
impossible hallway where none should be. It will lead these five men 
into fear, into betrayal, and into the biggest change of them all: 
by weekend's finish... they'll be dead.
