Having been myself raised with this culture at an Australian British Boarding
school I can honestly say that greatness of mind is often the direct result
of connecting with the idealism in British music such as in these song samples
from the opening credits of The Black Windmill movie (1974) starring Michael 
Caine.

Listen to the notes that are struck by the great children involved and imagine
the same song sung by all children whether in Australia Germany Italy or even
South America - all striving to hit the same level of note attainment in truest
human beauty in idealism of strength with best honesty.

The BBC should have this quality on nightly I say!
