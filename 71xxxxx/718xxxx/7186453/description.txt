Janiva Magness is a blues star quickly crossing over to a larger audience. A multiple Blues Music Award-winner (B.B. King Entertainer of the Year in 2009, Female Artist of the Year in 2006 and 2007). Magness delivers her finest album with the soulful intensity of 'Stronger For It', her first release to feature her striking original songs. On 'Stronger For It', Janiva Magness sings her heart out on some great material, digging deeper than ever on three soul-baring originals and bringing new emotional insight to hand-picked gems by Tom Waits, Shelby Lynne, Buddy and Judy Miller, Matthew Sweet, Grace Potter and more. The album is produced by Dave Darling (Brian Setzer, Meredith Brooks, Dan Hicks). (amazon.com)
