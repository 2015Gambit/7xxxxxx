1. Christie ( 1970 )

2. For All Mankind ( 1971 + bonus tracks from 1974)


Both are at 320 K.

This was a British rock band that very much embraced an American style
from that era. After their second album Jeff Christie replaced most of
the guys in the band, and they released a few more albums that I haven't 
been able to find yet. However, some of those songs are included 
as bonus tracks on the first one here.

Jeff Christie took musicians from another band using the name Christie 
again in 1990 and they toured into the 2000s, although as far as I 
know no original albums were recorded after 1974.
