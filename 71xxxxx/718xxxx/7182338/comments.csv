Chris Elliott stars as Marshal Chris Monsanto in EAGLEHEART, a new show that promises action, cars, suspense, conversations, intrigue, buildings and copious amounts of needless bloodshed in every episode. Aided by his sidekicks Brett and Susie, and under the watchful authority of Chief, Monsanto's goal is always the same: to punch people so hard that they explode.

Produced by Conan O'Brien's Conaco Productions and Dakota Pictures. (Source: Adult Swim)
