This album is a lot heavier than Cancer Bats' previous works, well thats IMO, but it still punches out that edgy Cancer Bats sound that we all love :) Check out their video for Road Sick if you have the time,and im sure you wont be disappointed..it is pretty fkn awesome...Dont forget to buy the cd if you like it or at least purchase some of their merchandise and support them so they can keep playing their brutal awesomeness..and PLEASE SEED!!!! thanks for downloading ;)
