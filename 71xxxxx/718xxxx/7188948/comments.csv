,manseed,2012-04-16T18:27Z,Thanks again!
,rewepewe,2012-04-16T20:09Z,"I never understand why this gets upload to the torrent protocol still PACKED IN RARS. It is either mind boggling inconsideration or extreme laziness. Either way, thanks for the upload."
,boundless,2012-04-16T23:38Z,"Damn, rar packed. Is this real? It has never been packed as an rar archive the IMMERSE release..."
,Ozdl,2012-04-17T02:34Z,"""Mind boggling inconsideration"", ""extreme laziness"" and ""get real"" are hardly terms to be used about someone who takes the trouble to upload popular files so promptly and unselfishly!

How hard is it to unpack a rar FGS?  You guys are the ones who need to get real ..."

It must be pretty fucking hard if the uploader can't do it before upping to save all the downloaders the time and trouble isn't it then?"
