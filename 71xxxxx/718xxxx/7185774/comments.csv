This is one of those movies that pick a name similar to the one of a blockbuster to get a couple more views. This title is no exception, but I have to mention that the movie is bad even for B standards. The acting is absolutely laughable, the plot seems to have been crafted by a six year-old and the camera effects are even worse. Do NOT pay to see this, do NOT waste bandwidth trying to download it. The director should be shot and his ashes thrown into a garbage bin. There is some moderate nudity in the movie which simply does not make up for how bad it is. This is one of those films your friends will tell you to watch just to laugh at how bad it is. Don't listen to them. It's worse than that.

,ch4rm3r,2012-04-16T18:56Z,"Hahhaa ... Here's a review from IMDB: 

I tried, I really did try to appreciate this, but the LAME attachment to Men In Black (Its actually WOMEN IN BLACK-*COUGH* *AHEM* *LOL*)..when this is a very, very.........VERY lame parasitic attempt to siphon the fans of an actually entertaining franchise made me sick.

The story is non existent, You WILL often find yourself asking (To Yourself) ""What the hell does this have to do with the theme of Men In Black? ""WHY are these people having casual conversations about nothing in particular?"", ""Why am I here?"", ""Who stole the last 75 minutes of my life and how do I get it back?""

The ""Character development"" LOL...was a series of inconsequential conversations between inconsequential nobodies that lasted a total of about 10 minutes. The acting is C grade at best and From the start you can tell.

I think I would have enjoyed this more (Slightly)...If it weren't toted as a sequel to something obviously well beyond the scope of this director(And infinitely more enjoyable and entertaining). Stay within boundaries and tame your ambitions before they misdirect you sir, you set the scope way too high and failed to deliver the experience. Sorry but the truth stings when its not what you want to hear.

This was a total wreck and should not have been tied in ANY way to Men In Black. There are no aliens(More like low budget ghosts) although you will definitely feel alienated by the fallacy in its advertised motive(Sequel) and medium(MiB)."
