PartitionMagic is a great partition manager for Windows. With it, users can manage the partitions using a visual interface. In the past, these kind of tasks had to be done using DOS applications that required a great deal of know-how. Now, thanks to Partition Magic, users can create, delete, copy, merge, split, and format partitions and discs, and change their file systems. After installation, the program will be able to do all of these tasks, however, it will have to go to DOS mode to complete some of the changes, so some restarts are to be expected. Even though many applications can handle partitions, Partition Magic has been the most popular application around for ages, mainly because how easy it is to use. Hard discs are depicted by a big bar with code colors. With a few clicks, a partition can be created and formatted. What's even better, users can adjust the sizes of partitions with drag and drop functionality. Furthermore, after a logical partition is created and unit letters change, an integrated application will search for missing or faulty links and repair them automatically. This is a must-have application for anyone who works a lot with partitions or disks and needs to be always on top of problems.
