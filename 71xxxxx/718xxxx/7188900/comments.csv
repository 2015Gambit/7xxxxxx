,kubrick,2012-04-16T20:52Z,@zxcvbnmjm If that's a real spoiler I will find you and I will fucking kill you.
,dizziedunnit,2012-04-17T00:21Z,"zxcvbnmjm, u fuckiNg cocksucker. Why would u post a spoiler without stating that its a spoiler? You are going to die from cancer at a very young age because of all the fucking crystal meth you smoke in between the blowjobs you give to support your mothers crack addiction. How you can afford a computer is beyond me, seeing how you are probably a high school dropout with no education besides passing the 2nd grade. You deserve more then an angry comment, i hope someone cuts your throat with a dull butter knife and spits in the open wound while shitting on your forehead. You are a joke with no punchline, you are not fit to breath the same air as the rest of the human race. Fuck you, you fucking lozer"
,BMeyerGator,2012-04-17T02:57Z,"Your a real piece of shit zxcvbnmjm. FUCKING TERRORIST! Go play in traffic. If you knew anything, you would know that this is the SERIES FINALE. Your a complete fucking idiot bc of your stupid ""THIS SEASON ONLY JUST GOT GOOD!"" comment. At PaleyFest 2011, it was announced that the third season will be its last. @dizziedunnit...well stated."
,h0kiez,2012-04-17T04:32Z,Relax everyone.  Kenny doesn't die.
,GamingIndustryBlows,2012-04-17T07:11Z,"The dumbass obviously doesn't think, and the good thing about that is he posted it before the episode ended."
,d.lee,2012-04-17T23:43Z,"what kind of douchebag posts spoilers about the show.  the comments are for quality and thanking the uploader...never about the actual show/movie.  i know it has already been said, but to reiterate; @zxcvbnmjm you are a ignorant douche.  good day."
,rjcripe,2012-04-21T23:08Z,@zxcvbnmjm FUCK YOU.
