Photoshop co-creator and Star Wars effects guru John Knoll developed Knoll Light Factory to mimic the reflections from a very bright light source as seen through a camera's lens. It's proven to be one of the most popular plug-ins for both Adobe Photoshop and After Effects. Knoll Light Factory goes far beyond the typical lens flares found in Photoshop, with over 100 great presets, real-time previewing, and 19 powerful flare tools for creating your own custom effects.
