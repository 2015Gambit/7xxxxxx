Information
------------------------------

As Hollywood actor George Clooney campaigns against the atrocities being committed in Sudan, the first edition of a new series of the critically acclaimed Unreported World has been able to film the most extensive documentary footage so far from the war zone. Reporter Aidan Hartley and director Daniel Bogado gained rare access to the Nuba Mountains to film the heroic doctors who are saving children in a largely hidden war being perpetrated on civilians by one of the world's most brutal dictatorships.
