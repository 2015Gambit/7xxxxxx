The legendary voice of late, great animation icon MEL BLANC returns to 
the silver screen for the first time in decades with the original Looney 
Tunes 3D theatrical cartoon short "I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat". Alongside 
longtime voiceover veteran and living legend JUNE FORAY, Blanc's 
original song, recorded in character in the late 1040s, provides the 
background tune to this all-new Sylvester vs. Tweety animated romp.

In timeless Looney Tunes fashion, the never-ending game of cat versus 
bird transpires in Granny's placid high-rise apartment while the sweet 
old woman naps. As Tweety Bird creatively avoids the clutches of 
Sylvester the Cat, the famished feline goes to outrageous lengths to 
secure his supper. A musical chase tears through Granny's home as the 
two juggle their roles of predator and prey, all while singing a catchy 
duet. With their manic antics framed by the original Blanc "Puddy Tat" 
song, the epic chase only ends when Granny wakes up and takes matters 
into her own hands.
