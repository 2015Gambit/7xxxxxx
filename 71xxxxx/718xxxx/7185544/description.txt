Under the system of Extraterritoriality an Amerian citizen, resident in China, cannot be taxed, arrested, or tried by the Chinese authorities. That, in simple language is extraterritoriality, and in addition to the Americans, the Belgians, Danes, French, British, Italians, Japanese, Dutch, Norwegians, Portugese, Spanish, Swedish, Brazilians, Mexicans and Swiss residents in China, have similar privileges. The Germans, Austrians and Russians, prior to the World War, had similar privileges but lost their rights directly or indirectly as a result of the War.
