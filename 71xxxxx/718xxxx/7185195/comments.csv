,kimriel,2012-05-02T05:30Z,I'm new to this can someone please tell me how to seed?
,Arctavius,2012-05-10T02:44Z,"For Kimriel

I'm new to this also, but I believe that 'seeding' is leaving your torrent client, I use Utorrent, open after the download. That way the file that you downloaded can be uploaded by other people. I always seed (leave my client and computer running) until my ratio is at least 5.0 or more.

That way, I know that I've uploaded to others at least five times the number of files that I've downloaded. Sharing makes it work."
