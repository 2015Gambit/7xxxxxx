One thing though, the cutscenes in between missions have no sound. Good thing I already know the story because I have it on ps3."
,Kadill,2012-06-27T17:04Z,I have done what is suggested here and the game still does not work. Is there something special I need to do besides install the game and fix the resolution? (windows 7 user)
