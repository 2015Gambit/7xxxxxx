Not only that but then you know your getting the latest version and can pick direct download mirrors depending on what country your in.

Plus you'll have the security of getting your files from the original company rather than a stranger posting torrents ;)

And no registration is required and the download is of course free.

I have no idea why people post half the torrents on TPB
I swear this planet is drowning in idiocy"
