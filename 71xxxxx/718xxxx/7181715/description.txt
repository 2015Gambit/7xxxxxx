Praise be Allah, Who has adorned the aspect of man by granting him good stature and proportion, Safeguarding him from increase and decline in his aspect and measurements, We ask for His forgiveness and guidance, We seek refuge from the evils, which are in ourselves and the wicked in our actions, And may the blessings and salutations be invoked upon Muhammad, His Prophet

Short Description: I do not intend to twist your mind or change your faith, my purpose and aim is to make you acquainted with the message of Islam for
the sake of knowledge, and it is up to you whether to accept it or reject it.


It is important not to judge the teachings of Islam
based upon the actions of some Muslims. Like every
other community there are a few ΓÇÿbad applesΓÇÖ and
it is unfortunate that the media sometimes focuses on these 
individuals in the Muslim community.

    If you are seeking real Truth and Salvation like many 
others before you, give Islam a try.
