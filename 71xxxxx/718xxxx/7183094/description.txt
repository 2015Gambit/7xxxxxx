This torrent contains 3 files:

com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist

com.apple.virtualMemory.plist

README.txt


These files are needed to create virtual memory on a jailbroken IOS device,
to my knowledge it works on all firmwares, I use IOS 5.0.1 as it is latest with tethered jailbreak.

It may cause a rare crash but it is worth it, is you have or run apps that take up alot of RAM you will need this!



I compiled this torrent, the 2 .plist files are from:

This is my first Torrent so please leave feedback,
  
               and remember my files are clean and virus free!
