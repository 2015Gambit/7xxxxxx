,shallow2,2012-04-14T22:39Z,"@JoeBethersonton: Seeding the HT TaraLynnFox now. Could not find the HT's, and Never been a fan of US so didnt dl them when M upped them.

If anyone else has these pls help. If not, Im sure Merzedes can help when he gets back.

Sorry I couldn't help more."
,JoeBethersonton,2012-04-14T23:27Z,"Knew you weren't a fan of US so thought it might be a long shot. The TLF HT has finished, thanks for your help!"
,shallow2,2012-04-14T23:48Z,"I'm pretty sure Merzedes has all of his 2010 shoots lying around, hopefully he can help. Also, you might consider posting requests under the US torrents in the next few weeks for any additional help, think that might be your best shot."
