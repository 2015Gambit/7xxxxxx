        Luther Vandross was one of the most successful R&B artists of the 1980s
        and '90s. Not only did he score a series of multi-millionselling albums
        containing chart-topping hit singles and perform soldout tours of the
        U.S. and around the world, but he also took charge of his music
        creatively, writing or co-writing most of his songs and arranging and
        producing his records. He was equally well known for his distinctive
        interpretations of classic pop and R&B songs, reflecting his knowledge
        and appreciation of the popular music of his youth. Possessed of a
        smooth, versatile tenor voice, he charmed millions with his romantic
        music.
