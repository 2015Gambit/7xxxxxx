Navy Seals
----------
Ripped this movie to .avi simply because I couldn't find a single file version on TPB
Don't expect any blueray HQ widescreen yada-yada, both because this is by first rip ever, secondary the fact that the source DVD ain't a very good quality in the first place.

Bare with me as it's my first release, I did my best, but is it good enough ?

A Navy Seals team was sent to rescue some Americans who were being held captive. And it's during the rescue that Stinger missiles were discovered in the enemy's possession. The team leader opted to leave rather than destroy them. But in doing so, terrorists have in their possession the perfect terrorist weapon. So, they have to be found, so that they could be destroyed, but won't be easy.
