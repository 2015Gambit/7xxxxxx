This was my first created torrent, and I suffered considerable trouble putting it together. At one point I thought I made a real ""dog's breakfast"" of the whole thing and tried to delete and re-create it, but couldnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t for reasons beyond my understanding.

Perhaps somebody could be good enough to let me know whether or not they have successfully downloaded the files, and whether all is in order. The torrent should contain two files within a folder: the audio file, and an image file that gives all the relevant particulars of the event (same one that appears on this page, above, albeit better resolution).

I, and future seeders/leechers, would be grateful for the feedback, I am sure."

Downloading now... will give feedback."
