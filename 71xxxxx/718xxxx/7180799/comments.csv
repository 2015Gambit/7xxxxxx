(You DA MAN)"
,captaind,2012-04-13T03:46Z,"Thanks for the upload.  This is why I get add-ons from here first.  Three airports at 35 MB usually means junk.  The runways textures look about like FSX default.  I would never pay for this, and don't even want it for free.  So thank you for uploading so I can sample the goods."
,_SnakEye,2012-04-13T09:15Z,"I haven't tried this addon, but you are probably right, it could be junk"
,CPT.MJ,2012-04-18T12:27Z,"Cheers mate, rather this improved addon than MSFS shit airport. You survive the addon, love it! Regards Sweden/Bosnia!!"

It's probably the worst scenery I've seen in a very long time. 

It's truly awful. Save your bandwidth.


Thanks for uploading anyway.."
