,sanmiglighter,2012-05-30T14:05Z,"To those having problems with ""insert Disk 1"" in installation, it's better you extract the iso file (same way you would extract a zip or rar) and install it that way instead of mounting it with PowerISO or similiar software. -->This will work if you are installing ONLY Autocad 2013 and NOT installing Inventor Fusion 2013 as well. (you will encounter a problem with certain files like: Autodesk.Catalyst.Freeway.UI.Controls.SheetDocSelector.resources.dll - due to limitations in filename length - google it. This file will not be extracted onto the target folder due to this limit, thus causing an error upon installation).  If you're just installing just Autocad 2013 (to save on space from software you won't use anyway), this method will work just fine.

The best is to burn iso to a CD if you want to install BOTH Autocad 2013 AND Inventor Fusion 2013."
