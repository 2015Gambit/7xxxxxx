PSP Mini - MechoWars

The game is in .CSO format (compressed ISO ripped from a digital download)

Works on any PSP with (L)CFW and an ISO loader. (ISO loaders will load CSO's as well)

I will take requests for other games (slowly). I have around 400 PSP and PS1 classics. (99% are NA region, the other 1% are EU region. Don't request JP,KO, AU or any region that isn't NA basically because I don't have them and won't upload them)

Please post if there are any problems with the game itself or if you're having trouble installing (L)CFW on your PSP. When asking for help with (L)CFW, please post what model PSP you have and what firmware you're currently on. (If you know what motherboard your PSP has that will be good as well)

If you download, please seed. I'll seed for as long as I can. Treat your fellow gamer's how you'd like to be treated and don't be a dick. 

Happy gaming.
