I used to subscribe when I could afford it.

Thanks for being there to fill the gap."
[T],480v,2012-04-15T06:10Z,"lol. i figured your thanks was just sarcasm when you called randi a clap trap in another post. I didn't know what to make of it. I thought...well the thanks looks sincere but why call randi a clap trap?

lol. To be honest, personally i can't stand her. but when she gets in one her zones and just tells it like it is... man, she is the best. no one is better when it comes to no bs common sense.  She does tend to stick to a topic way too long for my taste though. Put it this way, if I hear the name Zimmerman one more time...."
[T],480v,2012-04-15T10:36Z,"actually, “can’t stand” isn’t accurate. she’s one of my favorite shows. randi's definitely the smartest talk host i know while thom is the most knowledgeable. she just has that type of personality that I find annoying sometimes. "
,wfmu.org,2012-04-16T11:14Z,"thanks for the intel, we need to keep up on what the hell is going on/down and Randi and Thom Hartmann are right on.

talk about being too much on the difficult to listen to, well, when you look at Fake Fox un-news and Linbar shit, Randi and Thom are shining stars. 

please keep us informed, thanks 480v."

Fox or Limbaugh is bad for my health...literally. whenever I hear them, of course accidentally, ie, flipping channels or what have you, I get stressed from anger. 

Regarding Randi. It was a bit rash to say I couldn't stand her. I take that back. I love her show otherwise why bother posting? I've just been tired of her Nancy Gracing the Trayvon, Zimmerman story for over month. Yes its a tragic infuriating story with a serious issue about our gun laws & it needs to be addressed. But its not the only news story.

I've listened to Thom and Randi long enough to notice certain characteristics. But that's normal.  "
