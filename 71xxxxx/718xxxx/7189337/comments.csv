Song is alright.
Has an electronic feel to it, and kind of a rock edge."
,Deroba,2012-04-16T21:03Z,How do I make a webseed with: http://74.117.208.26/Linkin%20Park%20-%20Burn%20It%20Down.mp3 ?
[T],stumpie1971,2012-04-16T21:24Z,Why Make A Web Seed when you can just right click and save as mp3 file ?

,FireflyN7,2012-04-30T01:40Z,"Foobar2000 analysis says it's 320kbps. Good quality DL friend. And to those people saying how Linkin Park sucks now cause there music way different. Well did you ever stop to think If it all sounded the same for this long they would still have lots of fans? No. Change happens to keep the music alive.
Linkin Park Forever...  "

Linkin Park is not just a band , but a state of mind. 

How ya' feeling? 

LINKIN PARK

Oh yeah I feel you bro.

As for this song I think it sounds a lot like Foster the People and Temper Trap but I like it"
