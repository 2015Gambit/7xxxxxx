,ViolentC,2012-04-15T14:39Z,"this is all over TBP today. it is not the new MIB3. Rather it is this movie...

,xxx71074,2012-04-15T20:18Z,"This is one of those movies that pick a name similar to the one of a blockbuster to get a couple more views. This title is no exception, but I have to mention that the movie is bad even for B standards. The acting is absolutely laughable, the plot seems to have been crafted by a six year-old and the camera effects are even worse. Do NOT pay to see this, do NOT waste bandwidth trying to download it. The director should be shot and his ashes thrown into a garbage bin. There is some moderate nudity in the movie which simply does not make up for how bad it is. This is one of those films your friends will tell you to watch just to laugh at how bad it is. Don't listen to them. It's worse than that. It's an epitaph to human stupidity and a clear example of how not to make a movie."

,imbatman452,2012-04-24T07:11Z,THIS IS NOT MEN IN BLACK 3
,Paz75,2012-04-29T17:55Z,"It doesnt claim to be MIB3. If you'd bother to read the title and the writeup, its clear. Hence its NOT A FAKE. Its just not what you expected.

Take your Ritalin and relax. Its free (illegally) anyhow so quite complaining."
,leviathanus,2012-05-01T22:55Z,"The quality of audio and video, absolutely ok, the content...
Boring and stays boring until the end...
A guy in a black suit... It should be called ""Man in Black""
Singular, not plural... -.-"
,ironbiceps,2012-05-15T00:00Z,wrong movie ! 
,ozky666,2012-05-25T16:31Z,"Misleading title.
This is WOMEN in black, an awful piece of garbage according to IMDB
