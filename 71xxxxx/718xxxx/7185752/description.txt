- INFO:
Porcupine Tree is a rock band formed by Steven Wilson in 1987 in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England. Its music is associated with both psychedelic rock and progressive rock, yet having been influenced by trance, krautrock and ambient due to Steven Wilson and Richard Barbieri's penchant for the Kosmische Musik scene of the early 1970s, led by bands such as Tangerine Dream, Neu! and Can. Since the early 2000s, the music has been leaning towards progressive metal and alternative rock.
Line-up:
Steven Wilson ΓÇô vocals, guitars, piano, synthesizers
Richard Barbieri ΓÇô keyboards, synthesizers, piano
Colin Edwin ΓÇô bass guitar, double bass
