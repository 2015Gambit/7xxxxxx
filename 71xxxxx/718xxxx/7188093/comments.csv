,unknownpub,2012-04-17T12:10Z,Thanks for uploading this but I can't find India Inspirations Collection.
,kiza17,2012-04-19T12:18Z,how do i install these to my game?
,W_Irizarry,2012-04-19T15:15Z,"@unknownpub, I could not locate the India Inspirations Collection to include in this package.  That is the only thing in April 2012 I was not able to obtain.  www.thesimalogue.com has a complete inventory up to December 2011.  Anything after that I had to try and look up myself.

@kiza17, you put all the sims3pack files into C:UsersIzzyDocumentsElectronic ArtsThe Sims 3Downloads then open up The Sims 3 Launcher.  In the launcher, select the Downloads tab and you will see all the sims3pack files.  Simply click Select All and Install."
,W_Irizarry,2012-04-19T15:17Z,"@kiza17, sorry, the location I said to put the sims3pack files into, replace ""izzy"" with whatever your user name is.  So C:-Users-""UserName""-Documents-Electronic Arts-The Sims 3-Downloads"
,maurneo,2012-04-19T19:04Z,"Hey i dont know what im doing wrong.
but i did the same thing like you said.
put all the files into sims3/downloads
and then i go to the launcher and then im clicking on select all and then on install. But when i'm in the game i cant see something new?? :-("
,maurneo,2012-04-19T19:09Z,"Hey W_irizarry,

I was doing the same thing like you said.
I paste the shop files into sims3/downloads
Then im clicking on the launcher and then select all and install it but when i'm finished i go to the game and i see no new items ?? what is the file full store list.XLSX ???? "
,MainError,2012-04-23T10:07Z,"I'm having the same problem. I have all the EPs legitimately and after I install the packs via the launcher, they don't appear in game. If I restart the launcher it reverts back to saying they aren't installed. My paid-for content works fine. Is it some sort of anti-piracy?"
,MainError,2012-04-23T23:21Z,Figured it out. You have to install them a few at a time. 200mb increments is recommended.
,gilima,2012-04-24T06:44Z,"Wait, you can only download the items if your account is legal? Cause it says that a lot of the items need my software to be updated aka the game? Can anyone help?"
,W_Irizarry,2012-04-25T21:16Z,"I've been noticing this problem too, which is why I've been absent off here.  I've been working on compiling a working .package files list to be able to use just in case it kept messing up.  I've noticed the same problem with Launcher.  I've also noticed that it does work in increments, but 200MB I did not know.  I was just picking up to 20 files at a time and installing, but as you might suspect, that process will take FOREVER!  Also, doing it that way I noticed that after a certain point, regardless of if I was doing it by 20 files at a time or not, it would stay it was installed in the ""downloads"" tab of Launcher.  I would run the game through Launcher and then when it loaded, I would go to the button on the bottom left corner and select ""Open Launcher"".  When the Launcher opened, it would say the files were actually not installed.  So I gave up at this point and started compiling package files to see if this would be a better solution.  Look for a new torrent posting within the next few days that will also include the April 2012 updates I was able to find."
,QuaintBelial,2012-04-27T03:05Z,"Tried installing all at once, none of them stayed installed. 

Tried doing increments of 200mb or less, very few stayed installed, mostly all of them were not installed.

I don't know what the problem is but unfortunately, these do not seem to want to be installed.

Thanks anyway."
,admz0r,2012-04-28T00:03Z,always wait for my release. its always complete and not full with crap like this.
,admz0r,2012-04-28T00:04Z,whwere are these? http://gb.store.thesims3.com/brandedContent.html?categoryId=12595
,admz0r,2012-04-28T00:04Z,"where are these? 
http://gb.store.thesims3.com/brandedContent.html?categoryId=12595"
,QuaintBelial,2012-04-28T09:57Z,"5AB15AE5A7ABA1D7499CE06EB933A6928F4E56E7

^ Installed that one the 8gb one, I can't seem to find now. This one didn't work either. 

This torrent here, didn't keep them installed.

The 5AB15AE5A7ABA1D7499CE06EB933A6928F4E56E7 torrent I installed it via framework.rar into the sims 3 folder and manually adding the package files. It loads game up, until I get to my town and try to load, every time an error occurs where my sims crashes. Idk what the problem is."
,W_Irizarry,2012-04-30T16:13Z,"@admz0r - The branded content is in there if you would pay attention.  It's just included where it is actually supposed to go...it's release date.  You included it in an update for April 2012...which is not accurate.  Shakira, Sex Pistols, Lil Wayne, Ozzy and Kiss were actually released in back in July 2010.  Iams kit was released in October 2011, and the Renault Positive Energy Pack was released in a repack of the Renault Fluence EV Pack in April 2011."
,xanamew,2012-05-01T09:44Z,"Hello, i am new at this, but anyway i have a pirated version of sims 3 and want to install the store stuff, but when i go to the launcher it tells me i have to sign in to do that and that i need to register the game. How can i update the game and instal the store stuff?"
,W_Irizarry,2012-05-03T19:58Z,@xanamew - You don't need to sign in to install.  Simply put the Sims3Packs into C:Users?????DocumentsElectronic ArtsThe Sims 3Downloads and then go to the downloads tab of the Sims 3 Launcher and just pick which ones you want to install and click install.

,Undecided_Love,2012-05-06T20:58Z,"C:-Users-""UserName""-Documents-Electronic Arts-The Sims 3-Downloads, i can't seem to find it, did i do something wrong? I cant find the electronic arts...*"
,W_Irizarry,2012-05-07T03:45Z,"If you can't find the directory, that usually means you haven't started the game yet.  Try starting the Sims 3 Launcher.  Once that pops up, look for it again.  It should of automatically created the folder.  If not, start the game once and quit, then look.  It'll be there."
,Scyrthis,2012-05-13T20:53Z,"Horrible DL speed...

Here is the instruction on how to fix the problem if store items don't show in the game: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t2208-sims3pack-installed-world-inaccessible-or-wont-install-fix
Worked for me. Also don't forget to disconnect from the web when installing the items."
