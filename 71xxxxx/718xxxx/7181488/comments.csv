,Yamcha67,2012-04-14T00:22Z,Thanks for sharing this.. One of my favorite games.. =D
,HighQuota,2012-04-14T02:51Z,"So far I've downloaded 1.1GB, and froze in the last 5Mb uploading 4GB, with no down speed listed.  ŕ˛ _ŕ˛ "
,s_osoly,2012-04-14T04:53Z,for goodness sake SEEEDDDDDD!!!!
,Yamcha67,2012-04-14T05:55Z,"I'm stuck at 93.56%, I've been seeding my portion for a 5hrs... "
,inspirefire,2012-04-14T07:53Z,Guys I'm stuck at 93% can every one seed please i will seed the game then for 1 week
,akdreamer,2012-04-14T10:03Z,is this fake?? been stuck on 93% for a day and a half now....
,HighQuota,2012-04-14T17:16Z,"I've upped nearly 15GB, only 50Mb of down to go..."
,thewalid,2012-04-14T21:49Z,SEED MOTHERFUCKERS SEES
,thewalid,2012-04-14T21:56Z,Stuck at 93% here also!
,thewalid,2012-04-14T22:43Z,This torrent doesn't work... Downloads in good speed until it reaches 93% and then totally stops! Tried it on 3 Mac computers :/
,Yamcha67,2012-04-14T23:21Z,"Please Seed It UKIE, It seems people have not had a chance to completely finish downloading..

I'm also stuck at 93%"
,Ukie,2012-04-15T02:42Z,"Yamcha, it should work- believe it or not. I actually have downloaded a 2GiB game and played it at 99%. Worked flawlessly. It's not Call of Duty or some other 15GiB game where 1% is like, 250 MB. If it doesn't I'll see what I can do. I may have to upload a new torrent. If you don't want to do that I can upload one with step-by-step instructions on how to port it yourself."
,bogdi_N,2012-04-15T04:00Z,"Dude, in this torrent file are missing 38 pieces (76mb), how you can say that this will work if it's an incomplete file with only 0.935 Availability ? On what i can see on uTorrent we are ALL stuck at 93.5%, so no, i don't believe this could work right now"
,HighQuota,2012-04-15T04:05Z,"Ukie, since the .zip file is incomplete, even just trying to unarchive won't work. The file is listed as corrupt or incomplete.  The actual .zip file size is correct though, 1.24GB.

I've upped nearly 30GB now, and I can't hold off my schools IT department much longer, lol."
,inspirefire,2012-04-15T04:54Z,ukie will this work or not? cause if it doesn't set up a new torrent i really like this game.
,rusty-koathanger,2012-04-15T06:41Z,maybe a new torrent is in order. it's obvious that people aren't able to use the whole file and a porting step-by-step tutorial doesn't cut it. just re-up it properly plz
,Yamcha67,2012-04-15T11:10Z,"Thanks for the share Ukie, but unfortunately since I'm stuck at 93% It doesn't seem to extract.. If you have the time & bandwidth to reshare the torrent that would be great..
"
,Ukie,2012-04-15T20:20Z,"That's it guys- emergency measures are needed (yes, the game is that awesome). Before the day ends, I will upload a new torrent. Find it at 

""http://thepiratebay.se/user/Ukie/"" from the list of torrents I have ULed."
,meshuggah22,2012-04-22T16:15Z,"This is stuck at 93.5% for past 2 days so far...
