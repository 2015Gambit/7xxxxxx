It is the same."

Thanks for being the first to comment! :)

I don't think it is the same. It appears that the link you've posted is for Windows 98 Second Edition, whereas I offer regular, standard 1st Version Win 98."
,Maffia_Revenge,2012-05-04T16:37Z,Is this 98 SE or 98???
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-06-06T17:53Z,"Windows 98 lol, good times. I might install it on a VM just for the fun of it. Thanks for keeping this torrent alive."
