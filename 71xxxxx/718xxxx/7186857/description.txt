Since Cadinot's death a few years ago I've been trying to gather up his large library of films because he was such a great (gay) filmmaker. The films in this bundle are in digital format and a much higher quality then the VHS transfer variety we were stuck with for so long.  

Nobody films a hot scene with more beautiful young men then Cadinot.  Add these to your own libraries.  I have more in the wings.
