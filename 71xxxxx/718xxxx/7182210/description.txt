Moritz Stuckmann (Micheal Kebschull) is a strange young man, very much a loner, who confides his troubles to his pet rat and practices the saxophone in the basement. In this film, he has a number of gruesome fantasies about his teacher and the neighbor's cat. His father is preoccupied with having gone bankrupt, his mother can't be bothered to pay any attention to him, and his grandmother in the nursing home is asking for some extra sleeping pills so that she can commit suicide. Little wonder then, that he feels a bit isolated. Music gives him an avenue to the outside world; a band which appreciates his saxophone-playing asks him to join it.
