Whatever. There's a copy online with a full screen and hungarian subs, which is currently the best one you can get for free. Don't waste your time for that one."
,speed54110,2012-04-16T14:54Z,"@act378 Between Hungarian subtitles and French subtitles there is a difference ;) Whose usefulness of my post, sorry, if grieve you do not like do not download it. But the French will be happy."

,prochain,2012-04-19T13:40Z,"Merci,

Il y a t-il une possibilité de récupérer le fichier des sous-titres pour les utiliser sur une release avec une meilleure qualité d'image ?

Ou une possibilité de contacter la team de cette release (car pas de NFO dans le torrent) ?"
