    [Notes]

    Music history is rich with rock bands fronted by dynamic duos. Looking to
    carry on this yin and yang tradition are two talented young women, singer
    Emily Armstrong and guitarist Siouxsie Medley, who front Los Angeles' Dead
    Sara -- an electrifying four-piece rock band whose supercharged music is
    propelled by Medley's exhilarating, monster guitar riffs and Armstrong's
    powerful, wailing vocals.
