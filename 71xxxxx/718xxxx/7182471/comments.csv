,Krosbryd,2012-04-15T00:34Z,"Doesn't look like this works, unless I'm completely missing something.  I tried to mount the MDS image, but Daemon Tools keeps saying ""Unable to mount image.  File not accessible.""  I then installed it from the setup file provided, but when I tried to play, it told me to insert the disc.

I know it's a new torrent, and very few people will get this game (due to it not having an English translation), but does someone know of way to fix this?"

First, download ""Mahoutsukai Patch.rar""‎
Then, extract.
Inside the ""Mahoutsukai Patch"" folder, there will be a subfolder named ""plugin"" and a total of 3 files.
Copy all the files (including the subfolder) and place them into:
C:Program FilesTYPE-MOON魔法使いの夜
It should tell you that files with the same name already exist.  Choose REPLACE for all.
(2 of the 3 files should be preexisting.)
Next, click on the link to the right of ""NoDVD Patch→""
After the download, extract and double-click the files that's NOT the ""read me"" file.
It should prompt you to choose an executive file.
Go to C:Program FilesTYPE-MOON魔法使いの夜 again, and choose the ""魔法使いの夜.exe""
Now Click Open, and everything should be working."
