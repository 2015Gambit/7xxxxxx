Star Lake is an Orlando, Florida band that plays a unique brand of alternative rock with progressive and pop leanings. On their first official release, "Collapsing Stars", this ambitious quartet reveals a wide range of diversity as evidenced by dreamy/poppy songs like "Tides" and the happy-go-lucky "Little Moments". Emotions shift on darker songs like the eerie "Gossamer", the spacey "Graviton" and the uptempo blistering title track "Collapsing Stars". This EP is an collection of rock songs each with their own character that has a little bit of something for everyone. Star Lake wants to welcome you, the listener, to their universe. We hope you enjoy the stay.
