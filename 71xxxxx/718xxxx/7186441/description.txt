It came from the South. The most, primal, pounding, good-time-having sound known to man. Rockabilly. Johnny Burnette, Gene Vincent, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis and nearly 50 other boppin cats have all invited you to the rockingest party in town. Just one warning. Don't step on Carl Perkins shoes. The very word rockabilly with its derivation from hillbilly was originally meant as an insult, but its exponents soon wore the name as a badge of honour. Carl Perkins, King of the Rockabillies himself, called it a country man's song with a black man's rhythm. I just speeded up some of the slow blues licks. 

Sun Studios, Memphis, between 1954 and 1958 was the most famous home of this sound - though of course there are other locations, artists and even some earlier manifestations of the style. But Elvis, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Charlie Feathers and several other big-hitters all worked under label supremo Sam Phillips. That said, this compilation casts its net wide to bring you rockabilly of the highest pedigree. Union Square Music are very proud to present a brand new range of specially packaged releases from the Metro stable.
