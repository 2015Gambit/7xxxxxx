,sensuality123,2012-05-09T18:52Z,So far the Physibles section is a joke.
,Sublime865,2012-05-13T23:41Z,"so far it may be a joke however there are some gems in here and it is the first hint of what is to come. It is a great section for things in the future. I am working on a CAD model of a $10 aluminum part for my Schwinn bike that they stopped making 10 years ago, if it helps one other person get their $900 Schwinn Moab running again, then its helped. The nuke will help me take out my boss, that also helps... haha"
