I hope my new book, No They Can't, will spark discussions about freedom. That's what my show is about tonight.

Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and David Boaz from the Cato Institute will be here to discuss (okay, I'm a narcissist) my book.

We should throw more incumbents out, say Mark Meckler and Leo Linbeck, who started the super PAC Campaign for Primary Accountability. They fund challengers.

Then, Ron Paul joins us from the campaign trail.

A perfect example of government inefficiency takes place right in the nation's capital, which can't keep it's escalators working. Reason TV's Nick Gillespie and Kennedy join us to discuss how escalators were broken more often under government control after private contractors were replaced.
