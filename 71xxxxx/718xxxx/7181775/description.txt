This is my 4th official H264 AVCHD 720p HD release using my New Hauppauge HD PVR. I have captured other shows with it after Wrestlemania XXVIII which I haven't released as I'm still learning how to use it and the software that came with it. As I become more familiar with it I plan on doing even more quality HD releases in the future. Enjoy the show wrestling fans. 


Please leave a comment below if you wish to do so. Enjoy the show!!!
