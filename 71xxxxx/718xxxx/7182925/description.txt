The Singles Collection, Volume 4 is a limited edition CD series compilation box set by the English rock band Queen, the fourth and last set in the collection. The box set contains remastered versions of the next thirteen top-40 charting singles released by Queen that appear subsequent to those in The Singles Collection Volume 3, excluding the Five Live EP and the Small Soldiers Remix of "Another One Bites The Dust", the latter of which was not released by EMI/Parlophone.

It contains the material released from the years 1989 - 1999, and covers the albums The Miracle, Innuendo, Made In Heaven, Queen Rocks and Greatest Hits III. This was the band's final release on EMI/Parlophone before their back catalogue was re-issued on Universal's Island label in 2011.
