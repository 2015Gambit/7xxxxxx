,flagg1999,2012-04-16T04:29Z,Seed more! I'll happily seed this @4mbps all night! Thanks!
,dogbert730,2012-04-16T04:31Z,You mislabeled the episode as S01E03 in the description.
,nico_wasp,2012-04-16T04:38Z,Awesome! Thank you!
,CLost,2012-04-16T05:39Z,"Uploaded so fast! TY! Unfortunately I have to complain a little too. EP1 1.31gb, EP2 1.29GB, EP3 1.23GB. People getting the 720p release don't care if it's smaller, we want it to look good. This EP is grainy and all of them have little grey bars you notice in dark scenes. Please encode 1.5GB EPs like Season 1 those were gorgeous, the Season 2 EPs are getting worse and worse."
,erm...,2012-04-16T06:14Z,"I agree with Clost, Series 1 was better quality and actually had 5.1, most of the series 2 encodes have been stereo."
,cooisat,2012-04-16T06:16Z,"Clost:
Immerse version :S (is bad to me, but are the only who release version 720p for now)"
,cooisat,2012-04-16T06:17Z,Agree with CLost too
,shashu77,2012-04-16T06:20Z,"@CLost
Wait for 720p HDTV EbP rips. They're perfect. first episode is 2.2 gb and second is 2.5. Here's the links:

,miguelslo,2012-04-16T06:29Z,"I agree with Clost. Quality comes first. 

1080p release soon up?"
,DelosD,2012-04-16T07:24Z,What does EbP mean?
,shashu77,2012-04-16T08:20Z,EbP is the encoder name.
,Lapumia,2012-04-16T12:47Z,1080i Please!
,Hokrollo,2012-04-16T13:12Z,1080i out soon?

,digs5446,2012-05-23T14:08Z,Just an FYI to downloaders in the U.S. - HBO is tracking this torrent.  I got a warning from my ISP.
