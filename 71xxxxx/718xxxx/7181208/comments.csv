,michoEcho,2012-04-16T20:02Z,"Dark: Game is always crashing if you reach some lvls & then leave the game. So, my question is STILL without answer. Is there any way, how to save multi. process? "
,D4rkSp4wn,2012-04-16T21:18Z,"To save multi process, start the game, click on single player, profile, create a profile , go back to multiplayer and ur stats will be saved in ur new profile, if the game is always crashing like u said check if u pc meet the minimum requirements and also update your drivers, video, chipset, etc
"
,michoEcho,2012-04-17T23:06Z,"I have tried everything, but when I click on single player, profile, create a profile, it shows an error with creating profile ""please choose a different name and try again"". Any ideas?"

,IMP4CT,2012-05-29T17:46Z,"Downloaded the game, but when i start the mp, everything is red, and has ""Replace me"" written all over it. This happens on every map. Does someone know jow to fix this?"
,sicChuckNorris,2012-05-29T23:33Z,"I already have the game installed through another torrent, do I have to uninstall the game completely and install this one? Or is there just one or two things I can copy to the game directory? I just want to do the multiplayer"
