Jitouch is an application that utilizes the multi-touch capabilities of your macs trackpad(or magic mouse) to the fullest. the multi-touch gestures apple has built into its os lets you do basic stuff (that is all most of us will need). jitouch lets you customize the gestures by letting you decide what action does what. you can also set gestures on a per app basis. 
     one feature you will not find in better touch tool (free alternative) is characters. you can write down a letter (a-z) on the trackpad to launch applications for instance. please leave your comments about this app after using it. i have added a btt gestures list. tell me if you find it useful.
