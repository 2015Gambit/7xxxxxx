,drew1972,2012-04-15T15:22Z,"Thank you again.  You rock.  I love that you seed non-HD as well, since my video card can't handle HD quality video.  Thank you, thank you, thank you."
,jb4thewin,2012-04-15T16:05Z,"Is BBC doing the few races exclusive? I mean skysports then just has a rest while they give it to EJ, Coulthard and Humphrey or are they both doing coverage? I loved F1 on BBC last year but it's just a bit lame to jump from sky, Brundle and the coverage style to a completely different one.
BTW thanks for this again, footy. You're our hero."

,srr37,2012-04-15T19:15Z,"over 2000 dnlds, means footy should not have to buy the beer in any large city round the world! I'll buy if youre ever in portland OR.! 
cheers!"
,Johnpfw,2012-04-15T21:45Z,Thanks footy - beer waiting for you in Dallas.
,Johnpfw,2012-04-15T21:48Z,"@ jb4thewin
BBC are doing coverage of a minority of the races this year. The rest are on Sky. Go to BBC website for list of races they are covering."
,EdoSensei,2012-04-16T04:33Z,"This is the BBC coverage and it's so much better than Sky. Just a shame Brundle went there. Jake, Coulthard and EJ are so much more entertaining to watch than the Sky presenters. Please continue to upload the BBC coverage when they do the live coverage. Thanks again, there's a beer in Hiroshima for you too!"
,TurnonLoud,2012-04-16T05:54Z,Thank you so much. You are the one making F1 possible for me. It means a lot!!!
,fatherded,2012-04-16T07:56Z,"bloody fantastic, bbc commentary is far better than the mugs at sky. i just wish martin brundle had stayed with bbc too"
,mysticsquee,2012-04-16T08:40Z,"Top man footy!! Fan-fu**ing-tastic. Theres def a Becks waitin for you here in Auckland NZ. And what a race!! If you aint seen it yet, you are in for a treat. A few years back i woulda said motogp beats F1 hands down in the excitement stakes, but now, F1 all the way. Thanks all round!"
,mysticsquee,2012-04-16T09:16Z,"Sorry, I couldn't help myself from commenting again, but all people seem to be worried about so far is the whole BBC vs Sky argument. Are we all forgetting exactly what we are watching here? I'm not in it to see who can be the best at presenting Formula 1, all i care about is watching 24 of the best drivers drive 24 of the fastest cars at insane speeds whilst trying to avoid each other to become a world champion. So far, so fucking good."
,EdoSensei,2012-04-16T10:43Z,"Yes, but when Sky have paid for the rights and robbed a couple of good presenters off the bbc. you would expect and hope them to produce an even better programme. Parts of the Sky broadcast detract from the experiance of watching F1, even after the ad breaks have been cut out by the wonderful uploaders."
,vreza87,2012-04-16T15:49Z,they're fun! a bit Top Gear-ish vibe..
,mokker,2012-04-16T16:01Z,"I've been an F1 fan since the 90's but never have I seen races as tight as this season, from start to finish. It's just awesome! I think Pirelli, DRS, and KERS are the perfect ingredients to this excitement. The race in Shanghai is by far the best of them all. And I wanna make sure I get a copy of it. Thanks to you man!"
,ali_nba,2012-04-16T21:48Z,"footy i have no idea how to thank you, you are a great guy.
keep it up"
