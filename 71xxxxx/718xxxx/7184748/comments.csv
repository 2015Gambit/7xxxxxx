[V],psspss,2012-04-14T12:20Z,"oh i think the tv guide say part 2 was air-ed in 2008
is wrong too?

as in the episode they talked about another
dive in the fall of 2006
I suspect this episode was air in April 2006 but
maybe it varied per country.. beats me

still darn interesting watch!"
[V],psspss,2012-04-14T23:13Z,"apparently these 3 are part of the UFO files series

the confusion lies in hist chan had 3 titles called deep sea UFOs

regardless these have be video fixed and 1 newly ripped as originals out there are yellowy divx 5 rips

and people didnt realize that these existed
or deep sea UFO - red alert was a second part to the one they already seen"
