Deap Sea UFOs Xvid_Collection (2006-2008) USOs & more (videos fixed and enhanced)

most people will have seen or got these files in various forms
and formats

I make up this collection.. some were poor tvrips done with divx
and had yellow color.. so I did some work to brighten and sharpen
the videos and sorted out the colors and resync-ed the audio
since no other sources existed and no HDTV ones sadly
and the audio normalised a weebit since some were distorted

I converted the deep sea red alert to complete the collection on USOs
from BPfines mp4 source

one is a special featuring UFO hunters as a pilot segment that lead to the series of UFO hunters

all are 1000bitrate 640x352-360 pixel range and mp3 audio
