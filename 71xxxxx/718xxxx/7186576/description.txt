After searching endlessly for the full 10 minute AVD track and avid 'Joostece' fan, I decided to make my own torrent to save other people the time and frustration.

320 kbps (converted from FLAC), Stereo channel, tags; etc. It's all there- I've no reason not to give out good quality. :)

Anywho, enjoy some new Justice (even though it's not Cross) and seed if you can.
Thanks everyone! ^_^
