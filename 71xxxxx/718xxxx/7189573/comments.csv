,CptHippie,2012-04-16T14:55Z,"@anon:  Actually it's neither 10 or 12.  Mythbusters do not track by 'seasons'.  They list by year.  as such this season is the 2012 season.  But this is the 10th year they have aired; Thus, season 10."
,nazgull2k10,2012-04-16T17:14Z,"I dont care how they list it.  This show teaches both adults AND kids science.. something SERIOUSLY lacking on today's television.  

Mythbusters rock!"
,data101,2012-04-17T02:26Z,i dont get this ettv uped this before you and its the same size oh i just realised you take ettvs videos and up them but im not saying thats bad you always have more seeders
,Killher,2012-04-17T05:43Z,"@data101 - That seems uncalled for. What proof do you have to support your claim? *Gasp* NONE?!?!
Why don't you just STFU and learn how to use a period."
,Apoc_69,2012-04-17T10:57Z,"@data101 if ettv puts it out sooner, go get his copy... nobody is making you download from Eztv.
If you want good HD shit, there's only one man to leech from. 

Thank you Eztv. As always, out the same night as release and fantastic quality, as usual."
