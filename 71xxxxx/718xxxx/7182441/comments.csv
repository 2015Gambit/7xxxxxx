Unfortunately my internet is semi-busted for the next couple days so I can only muster ~100kbps, but since most of you already have most of the torrent, shouldn't be a problem."
,tigerfang589,2012-04-13T15:11Z,"All but ""~~Side 1~~"" for Universe A and Universe B, is unavailable in the swarm... 

:/"
,Pyrogoeth,2012-04-13T16:13Z,"I'm seeding as hard as I can, ok? Nothing I can do about it, I said I wanted to wait to make a new torrent until I had good internet again but folks wanted the new albums."
,twcjz,2012-04-13T18:02Z,"I already had all of the previous albums, anyone mind telling me how to make it so utorrent freaking sees them as downloaded on this torrent so I can get to seeding?"
,tigerfang589,2012-04-13T19:14Z,"Yay! Two more pieces in the swarm! We're doing this! We're making it happen!

Also, I downloaded the albums via bandcamp, I'll try and see if I can help seed the missing pieces as well. Thank you for listening to us and trying with crappy internets :D

@twcjz I'm going to try and figure it out now."
,Pyrogoeth,2012-04-14T01:54Z,"@twgz
Ideally, just point the torrent to the same folder as you downloaded to last time and hit ""Force Recheck"". uTorrent is rather capricious about it though so it might not always work."
,masterread,2012-04-14T01:56Z,"I have it (using vuse) so i only have to download the two new albulms.
I will get utorrent and make a new torrent for them wwhen i finish :)
If i do because my download speed is 0 but oh well"
,skeen9,2012-04-15T02:33Z,"one could also manually select don't downlode for files they already have or set the priority to 0.

 Also it would help if there were more seeders than leechers"
,Pyrogoeth,2012-04-16T10:14Z,"@skeen9
YOUR WISH IS GRANTED."
,IakKereshna,2012-05-14T12:13Z,"Hey, since the corrected tracks Indigo Archer and Purple Tyrant are now available, are you going to add them to the torrent?"
,Pyrogoeth,2012-05-20T23:28Z,"Updating for two, freely-downloadable tracks would rather be a waste of my time, wouldn't it? They'll be added with the next album."
,Pyrogoeth,2012-06-12T22:25Z,"Updated to add the new album (as well as the new Indigo Archer and Purple Tyrant).
