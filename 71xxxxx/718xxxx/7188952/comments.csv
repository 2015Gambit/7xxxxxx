On the night of Saturday, 11 September 1971, a gang of thieves tunnelled for 40ft into the vault of Lloyds Bank on Baker Street, central London, cutting through the reinforced concrete floor with a thermic lance. They began digging the tunnel over a period of evenings and weekends from beneath a nearby handbag store they had previously purchased. 

On the final night the robbers communicated with a look-out sitting on a nearby roof via walkie-talkie. The signal was picked up by an amateur radio enthusiast, Robert Rowlands, who was trying to reach friends in Australia. 

After initially believing it to be hoax, the police eventually tuned in, but could not identify which bank was being robbed. A check of 700 banks failed, with Lloyds on Baker Street being one of those checked. With the vault door undisturbed, police assumed there was no other way of entry and left. 

The thieves gained entry through a 15in hole, prompting speculation that a woman or child had entered the vault. A woman's voice was picked up on the radio transmissions. Scrawled inside the safe, the criminals left the words: ""Let Sherlock Holmes try to solve this."" Four men were jailed in 1973 for their roles in the robbery. 

According to some of the claims, a D-notice was issued requesting self-censorship by the media to protect national security. It has been suggested some of the stolen material contained sensitive information about the Royal Family."
