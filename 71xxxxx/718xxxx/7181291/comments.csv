,_SnakEye,2012-04-13T09:19Z,what's the problem? open the RIP zip file and see for yourself what it is you are about to put in by copying the files.

we need the file(s) in your fsx/gauges folder, probably 'birddog.dll', without this file it cannot work. Add it on separately and I will make a full install with crack with it."

I have the last version of the full install, I just need this 'birddog.dll' file picked in the 'gauge' directory of an installed working version to make it work for everybody and without serial."
,Rapterman_123,2012-04-13T19:20Z,come on some one give tornade25  the 'birddog.dll' file to get this to work Thanks in Advance
,doitordie,2012-04-13T19:43Z,A have a legit of this version and it has an annoying security feature.  You'll have to ask permission from the publishers if you decide to reinstall it in another PC.  I hope someone can crack this one.  Good luck.
,tornade25,2012-04-13T20:11Z,"@doitordie
if it is working on one of your computers, copy this 'birddog.dll' file from your fsx/gauge folder and post it as a torrent, I just need this file to make it work. (copy from the computer where you can run this bird)."
,Rapterman_123,2012-04-13T21:13Z,this is one slow torrent seed seed seed and some one upload this working or the 'birddog.dll file so that tornade25 can get it working and upload it for all of us

,slipcork,2012-04-13T21:58Z,"You ripped off my upload dude, but I have uploaded the missing gauge.dll for the plane to work properly. "
,tornade25,2012-04-13T22:52Z,"They probably used the same method to protect their birddog, you will understand better if you install their safir.

Here you will find an install version of their Safir, it is fully working, just do what I wrote in the Readme.txt file.

,slipcork,2012-04-14T00:24Z,@tornade25 I uploaded gauge .dll 
,tornade25,2012-04-14T10:29Z,"@slipcork
the birddog.dll you posted comes from a non working installation.
I need this file but coming from a working installation, after you have entered the name and all."
,Carlo271269,2012-04-14T18:53Z,"This aircraft is not complete. No virtual cockpit textures, missing wing textures. Waste of downloadtime."

,Rapterman_123,2012-04-16T12:16Z,if anyone has got this working upload a working torrent please
,slipcork,2012-04-16T18:44Z,"@Rapterman I have the working upload. You have to d/l from company,then they email you a 60 (ten sets of 6) digit key. The link is only good for 2 weeks. I have copied all the file I have and made a torrent and u/ld to TPB. I am a newbee and don't know what else to do. Guidance and patience please."
,tornade25,2012-04-16T20:20Z,"@slipcork
if you gave this file coming from your working version then Sibwings must have changed their protection.
Anyway birds from Sibwings are very good and we can invest a few bucks to learn how to really fly :-)) For me they come just after Accusim."
,Rapterman_123,2012-04-16T20:45Z,Many Thanks slipcork sound good please give me the link to the torrent please many thanks
,Rapterman_123,2012-04-17T16:46Z,"here is the link for slipcork SibWings Cessna Bird Dog 1.2 http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7181254/SibWings_Bird_Dog_1.2 it is the same as this one  wing in a blacked out box type shape

,mm_surf_1,2012-04-19T01:59Z,Can anyone crack this bird ...?
,Zakopolis,2012-04-19T14:44Z,This is the only aircraft for FSX that will never be craked.
,slipcork,2012-04-20T00:33Z,I had to buy it 30.00 usd but well worth every penny.Lots of versions and skins with d/l.
,slipcork,2012-04-29T00:45Z,"@carlo271269 , Appreciate the criticism. This was my first attempt at an upload. Maybe you should spend your money on the real d/l like I did, and do a better job of reformatting the files from windows to torrent, then uploading to TPB.  I am sure a cynic such as yourself should be talented in all fields of expertize."
,Carlo271269,2012-04-30T14:56Z,"@slipcork. If you would have checked the files before you uploaded them, there would not have been a problem. I just mentioned that the plane you uploaded doesn't work the way it should and that it's not worth downloading. But a stuck up dickhead like you is probably to stupid to see that."
