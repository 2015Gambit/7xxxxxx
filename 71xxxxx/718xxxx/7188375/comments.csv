That's the third time i'm trying to upload this torrent and the third time the torrent file i'm downloading back from the site doesn't recognise the file on my hard disk.
It acts as if the file isn't there and tries to start from scratch.
I tried on othe torrent sites and there it goes normally."

All the people here who used the magnet link probably won't be able to download, since it seems defective.

My DHT is enabled, so maybe people can download the torrent file from my torrent client and start from there."

Here it seems nobody can download from me."
