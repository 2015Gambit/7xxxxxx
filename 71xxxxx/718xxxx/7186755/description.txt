Name: Landsdomur recordings

The Landsdómur is a special court in Iceland which was established in 1905 with the mandate to handle cases where members of the Cabinet are suspected of criminal behavior.

The Landsdómur has 15 members — five supreme court justices, a district court president, a constitutional law professor and eight people chosen by parliament every six years.
The court was assembled for the first time to prosecute former Prime Minister Geir Haarde for alleged gross misconduct in the events leading up to the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis. The Althing decided on September 28, 2010 with 33 votes against 30 to charge Haarde.
