,Karlston,2012-04-15T23:21Z,"Thanks Mantesh for the ebook.
But, PIRATE BAY... these !@#$%^ popups are insanely annoying!!!!!!!!  Can't do anything on a PB page without making one of the @#$% things appear! Twice while typing the last sentence one popped up, unbelievably fucking annoying!!!"
,tuvokk,2012-04-16T03:37Z,"@Karlston: yes, annoying, but you can use an ad blocker if it gets too much.
On the other hand, if it helps to keep tpb up and running, I don't mind to click on some ads now and then.
@MANTESH: thanks for this and all your other great uploads."
,Metalloy,2012-04-16T17:47Z,Thanks @MANTESH. Seems you are now overtaking @MALESTROM's throne as the royal master of e-book uploaders.
