Abaut Evi:

The first time Faroese Evi Tommysdóttir Djurhuus sang in public 
was at her own wedding in August 2010. Recently she released a 
single album with two country tracks. 

Evi is 30 years old and has been singing a lot at home, inside 
the four walls but she hadn’t performed in public at all before 
her wedding. Evi practiced all night long before the wedding and 
performed the song for her groom. This resulted in him giving 
her a guitar as a present the morning after.

Since that day neither the guitar nor the voice has had breaks. 
She has been practicing very hard, from dusk to dawn. 

Evi has recently taken the next step and recorded two well-known 
country-hits, and a album, which now are available on CD.


Track list:
Track 1: How's the World treating you
Track 2: He'll have to go

The tracks are in the WAV-format.
