,Gerry19101986,2012-04-16T00:50Z,comment plz if file contains missing files because 55 mb for 1 hour of hd quality seems rather low
,Luchadorz,2012-04-16T01:04Z,what is this? is it a part of something some story or what? i am following game of thrones but have not seen this before? are there more episodes?
,BUGAB000,2012-04-16T01:18Z,"Thanks DibyaTPB

At first I did not know what to make of this torrent, since it is such a small file.

The Matroska video File is only 1 min. 45 sec. long, but it provides some nice extra info (history and lore) about the Starks of Winterfell and the Kingdom of the North.

Indeed if there are more of these little extras, uploading these will be marvellous, if you can?!?
Game of Thrones is an excellent series.

ps.
Quality is Good! "
,ydrill,2012-04-16T01:23Z,"It's a very short story about some of the kings who came before the characters in Game of Thrones.

It's not the next episode or anything, but interesting if you're into the lore of the world.

It appears to be from the Blu-Ray of season 1."
,darren_simion,2012-04-16T01:39Z,what is this?
,johnniebrasco1,2012-04-16T01:43Z,it's a 1:45 min long animated story of how the starks got their house a long time ago.
,johnniebrasco1,2012-04-16T01:45Z,"oh, well, it's already been answered. "

It had a corrupted file so I ripped it from the bluray I have"
,TabascoQuesadilla,2012-04-16T06:12Z,"The rest of them are here:

That torrent has a corrupted version of this particular video, hence the RERIP.

There are a whole bunch of these - some are on the DVD, but I think most of them are Blu-Ray exclusive extras.  They tell the history of the Seven Kingdoms prior to the start of the series/books.  Some of them tell the same story from different houses' perspective - this is the Stark perspective on the Field of Fire (the deciding battle in the Targaryen conquest of Westeros)."
,stalker277,2012-04-17T00:25Z,Yeah... took you long enough after some convincing.
