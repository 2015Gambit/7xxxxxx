Narratives:

The self-titled full-length debut from the British alt-rock ensemble Scars on 45, this album features the Yorkshire band's distinct, melodic guitar-based pop. Showcasing the talents of singer/songwriter Danny Bemrose, vocalist Aimee Driver, keyboardist David Nowakowski, bassist Stuart Nichols, and drummer Chris Durling, Scars on 45 make catchy and heartfelt guitar- and keyboard-based rock with a bit of harmony-laden country-rock a la Fleetwood Mac peppered in for good measure. It's an inspired sound that helped garner the band a spot on the Grey's Anatomy, Vol. 4 soundtrack. Fans of that track will find much to enjoy on this debut that features the single "Heart on Fire."
