L'Amour par terre - 1984 - Jacques Rivette
AKA Love on the Ground

Rivette's 1984 film "L'Amour par terre" was made 10 years after "Celine et Julie
vont en bateau" and bears some resemblance to the earlier work. A trio of young 
actors (Birkin, Chaplin, Bo) who specialize in "appartment theatre" are employed by
a rich and famous playwright (Kalfon) to stage his new work at a secluded mansion.
Characters with names like Virgil, Beatrice, Adriana and Bluebeard suggest that
this is going to be no ordinary performance. The roles and personalities of the
actors mutate as the story unfolds, and  the castle reveals its true character.
