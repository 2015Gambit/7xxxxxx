btw I have an intel graphics card, does this affect the game in anyway??"
,TeamCrysis,2012-04-21T04:16Z,"Hi Comlink01,

Try playing it in low config and see what happens....."
,Comlink01,2012-04-21T20:08Z,"Well that's what I did in the first place and it crashed, I noticed that it ONLY works when ""Shaders"" is enabled"
,iFrogzx,2012-05-07T19:03Z,how to change to resolution to 1366x768?
,DACreech,2012-05-08T06:36Z,"I'm having the same issues.  I can play the tutorial, but whenever I try to play the game it starts off fine until I try moving.  And if I play the Campain, it crashes right after the video clip. My settings are low.  Nice game and almost playable!  I hope you fix it so it can become an awesome and useable torrent.  "
,Comlink01,2012-05-17T23:05Z,"Ok, so I tried with my other laptop(low end by the way) which has an ATI Gcard and runs fine on the lowest settings. The other laptop has Intel Gcard and I have to enable ""Shaders"" so the game doesn't crash"
,raion84,2012-05-18T08:11Z,"cannot, it said you must have C&C tiberium wars installed to play kane wrath . HELP!"
,PhoenixNights_92,2012-05-24T06:37Z,"I don't like this one... Lol. I was looking for the real thing(I had the physical copy, it just got destroyed.), and this isn't it. It's got a bunch of the mods in it, and it really drags down the detail... It looks like I'm playing the game on the SNES or something. I'm running a quad core A8-3850 with 8GB of DDR3 RAM, and a Radeon 6670 GPU... So it's not the hardware. The torrent downloaded very quickly, that's a plus, no virus's, game installed perfectly and ran just fine(I'm not sure if it needs or doesn't need the original C&C3, because I own it and it's installed.) This just wasn't what I was looking for."
