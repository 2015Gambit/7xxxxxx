but for the love of christ these other uploaders putting up utter shit quality baffles me.

,lindatexel,2012-04-15T00:03Z,"found the error, some one killed my win-rar program,now the  torrent works fine, game also."
,wendyrx,2012-04-15T17:20Z,can someone share with me how to fix this? it just sits on the title screen.... never says click to continue or anything.
,smurfmeat,2012-04-18T04:10Z,"The game only worked for me when I extracted with WinRar. I used another program at first and it would just freeze on the title screen, with no ""Press any key to begin..."" message."
