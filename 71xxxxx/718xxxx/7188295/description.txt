Re-upload of an older torrent, which broke.


I really loved playing Rise of Nations-
Then I got Lion. I was very disappointed that I could no longer play the game without running bootcamp or some other shit, and missed it very dearly.

I spent hours getting it to work- then, when it finally did, it had no sound. It remained this way for a day or two until finally I tried another way and it worked.

The sound is a half-second or so late, but it is better than nothing. 

Yes, this is a Windows game ported. No, it is not Cider (which can only handle the most advanced graphics), or CXEx (can't work some additional program needed for the game). 

This is WINESKIN, believe it or not. I had to change the wrapper sooooo much to get the game working.

Anyone who downloads this:

Consider yourselves extremely lucky. 

NO NOCD CRACK/PATCH NEEDED!

This is not some "last resort" torrent where it is only for Lion users desperate to play, and Snow Leopard/earlier can just download the mac version; this is the ONLY RISE OF NATIONS MAC TORRENT IN EXISTENCE that

a) Works with Lion
b) Does not require any CD to be inserted or image to be mounted.

ALL mac users who want Rise of Nations should download this torrent, even if you don't have Lion and therefore can run the mac-native version- because this is also NOCD.
