,legion595,2012-04-22T07:59Z,"Ok i downloaded in about 3 hours, Works GREAT, just one minor thing that irritates me is when i move the mouse NEAR the edge of the screen or go to select something like diplomacy or build the screen scrolls down or whatever direction, is there anyway to fix this , really irritating when trying to select something and then constantly having to readjust the screen back to your city
 -__-, other than that game works perfect , cheers for the great torrent :D"
,yolo6209,2012-04-23T01:38Z,I downloaded the file and it still will not open. Keeps coming up with the message MSXML 4.0 is not properly installed. If anyone could provide any help or guidance that would be great 
,Ukie,2012-04-23T03:07Z,"Yolo, that's the problem I feared the most. Godamn headache fixing that one. I'll have to upload instructions."
,ashtonDmau5,2012-04-24T16:19Z,"I'm running 10.5.8, will this still run for me?
If so, i will seed forever!
I fucking LOVED this game back in the day!"
,lucasmxbr,2012-04-25T18:30Z,"Thank you SO MUCH!!!

Running on a MacBook Pro 13"" on 10.7.3
Working perfectly! No bugs! Just open the file and there is the game! Loading even faster than my quad-core i5 windows!

I never thought that would be Rise of Nations for Mac, or i would never find it! 

Uploaded more than 5GB from yesterday to now, and will upload  it 4eva!!! Keeping your credits Ukie! Thank you Ukie! for your hard work!

I love playing Rise of Nations too!


Guys lets all seed this! 1GB is nothing on your HD and this worth very much!"
,DG-Thrash,2012-05-01T12:14Z,"I'm getting the MSXML 4.0 is not properly installed message too, any luck with this yet Ukie?"
,flamegreenthroats,2012-05-06T23:01Z,"Thanks for making this! I played the hell out of RoN on my old iBook. I've been thinking about pulling the disk out and installing it, but my plans to _eventually_ go to Lion kept making me pause. Unfortunately my productivity will probably now decline....."
,fartmcgee,2012-06-03T23:50Z,"When I click it, it starts up; no windows pop up or anything, just the icon, then it waits for a second and then it closes. No messages or anything it just closes. "
,Ukie,2012-06-06T23:28Z,"LEGION595- I'VE FOUND A WAY-

Go in the game menu to ""options"" then ""graphics"" then change the resolution."
,tremourz,2012-06-13T23:14Z,can we play online with friends? because i have 2 friends who still play this game and i cant seem to connect to their games :(
,tremourz,2012-06-13T23:22Z,"can we play online? like LAN status, not just the gamespy"
,evanfire3000,2012-07-03T18:22Z,"I'm having the same problem as yolo... everything is working up to the point where I see the RoN icon in my desktop, but then when I click on it, I get an error ""MSXML 4.0 is not properly installed."" Can you please post a fix to this? I'm running Mac OS X 10.5.8. Thank you!"
,Ukie,2012-07-11T16:35Z,"FIX FOR MSXML ERROR:

find on online download of MXSML (are plenty) and then use wine to install it to RoN directory.
Right click on app show package contents, then the ""wineskin"" app inside, and then run the installer for the mxsml .exe you downloaded. Install to same directory as RoN.

FOR SCREEN PROBLEM:
Go to ""Show package contents"" then drive_c then users then Wineskin then App Data then Microsoft Games then Rise of Nations then open rise2.ini.

Change 
Windowed Width=[Your screen res. width]
Windowed Height=[Your screen res. height].

Then close that. Now go back into the app ""Show Package Contents"" and then Wineskin app and then Screen Options and then Fullscreen, and make sure to put resolution at current unless that is different from your resolution."
,RomanCl,2012-08-17T06:54Z,Hey you need to fix this. Some of the files won't extract and it's driving me nuts!!!!
,Ukie,2012-08-21T22:16Z,"If you want any help then you need to be more specific. I have no idea what your problem is, you need to describe your problem extracting the files."
,Negzero0,2012-08-24T08:21Z,The App doesnt open at all for me I dont understand why. I downloaded the msxml and tried the way to fix it that you commented ukie but i still get the same thing now i dont even get an error message the app just blinks and doesnt open
