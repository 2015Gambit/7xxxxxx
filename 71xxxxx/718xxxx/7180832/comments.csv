,TheRiddl3r,2012-04-13T19:44Z,"Thanks so much! Can you please keep uploading the canucks games for the rest of the playoffs? I will be in another country soon and won't be able to get them on TV!

,AFHCoyote,2012-04-14T07:56Z,"Hey CNKF2 can you upload Game 2 as well? You did a great job on this one. I missed the 2nd game as well and was hoping you were doing the series. If you can, I'd be very grateful :)"
,CNKF2,2012-04-16T18:48Z,"I have game 2 but because of glitches, it looks like crap and the best I can do is 25 fps & 576p.  Looks like ass but I may share it anyways if I can't fix it in a few days."
,Brit-Viking,2012-04-17T12:14Z,Looking Like ass but still watching the game is better than highlight ;) Thanks mate
