[color=Maroon][b]Pink Floyd - A Saucerful Of Videos &  Final Cut EP - Rare Videos [AVI][/b][/color]

Attention: These videos are very low quality. I feel fortunate to have the files I do. I cannot find any info on the internet even about these besides they were fan made videos from 1993. (maybe you can find more I did not try very hard) See cover below. [color=Brown] Add:so I searched and the Final Cut videos are actually available on DVD... I have the DVD and will upload (cover below) [/color]

If anyone has these in higher quality please do upload until then enjoy these, and please do not post here complaining about the quality of the videos. I have announced its bad, any other info about these videos welcome. I have literally hundreds of rare rock videos all dvd quality I will upload some of them here if there is an audience. (these are some of the only avi's I have being they are so hard to find) A thank you or two would help the process.
