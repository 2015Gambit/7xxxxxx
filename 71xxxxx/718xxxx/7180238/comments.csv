I have two questions:

1) are u a member of the 300mb united site?
2) can u make these movie xbox compatible?

when I stream any mkv movie to my xbox (mostly the movies I download from you) via PS3 media server half way the audio gets out of sync! do u know a solution for that? Avi and mp4 movies stream perfectly"
[V],sujaidr,2012-04-13T04:10Z,"@seedANDtorrent,cant answer the first question,regardin the 2nd one,my rips r for pc wit huge ass monitors and i've never tried on lil ipods,xbox ,ipads etc,so dont know if they r compatible,if they r not then u can use the countless apps that r found on the net to convert them to use to ur needs,i am not here to spoon feed u guys,i have a life of my own :)"

[V],sujaidr,2012-04-13T15:54Z,"@doritoman,thanks for the info mate......hope people will now stop askin me to upload in mp4 or whether its compatible wit their portable devices :)"
