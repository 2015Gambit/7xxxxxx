Still waiting for this torrent to finish?

All 4 of these books are available in other torrents.

plus:

Book 1 is available in it's 4th edition, 2 years newer.

Book 4 is available in it's 3rd edition, 7 years newer.

Enjoy."
,UX_junkie,2012-04-16T17:38Z,"sorry for the delay in downloads. I keep the torrents running all the time I am on my Mac, which is about 5-6 hours a day. Keep seeding. 

Plus... isn't it good to have all the ""most recommended"" books at one place? Thats why I created this torrent. 

Plus... if you got links to newer versions of these books, why don't you put them in this thread. "
,sneakrnet,2012-04-16T19:20Z,"""isn't it good to have all the ""most recommended"" books at one place? Thats why I created this torrent.""  -- yes

""if you got links to newer versions of these books, why don't you put them in this thread.""
-- fair enough:

I don't know piratebay's policy about mentioning other torrent sites, but I found all the books, including later editions, using bitsnoop.

Are these particular books ""awesome?""  ""Javascript, the Definitive Guide,"" definitely.  The others, well, depends on the reader.

I would also suggest ""Javascript, the Good Parts.""  A little opinionated, but essential."
