,minnerwa,2012-04-16T10:11Z,"New thing. Now you have to magnet links, for that you have to pay money to uTorrent."
,gr33nday,2012-04-16T10:22Z,Yes. You need to pay into account of minnerwa to download this torrent. Or maybe you can try upgrading your torrent client from http://www.utorrent.com/
,minnerwa,2012-04-22T19:26Z,"Naw, don't pay me, rather try upgrading uTorrent without paying."
,minnerwa,2012-05-12T05:21Z,"I apologise for my ignorance. Magnet link is free, just wait for it to download."
