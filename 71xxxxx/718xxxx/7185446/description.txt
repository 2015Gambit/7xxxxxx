Your Commodore Magazine Issues 00-85 (July 1984 - October 1991) + extras

Your Commodore ran for 85 issues between 1984 and 1991, covering the C64,
Amiga and occasionally Commodore-branded PCs with the main focus on 
programming and hardware, although games were covered to an extent. 
It incorporated "Your 64!" from 1985 after Sportscene dropped the title, 
and the whole mag was later rebranded as YC and focussed more on gaming 
and entertainment.

These PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on public
torrent trackers. They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad.

The OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the
more unusual fonts and layouts used, and by the relatively low DPI of the 
source images. Also, paragraph formatting is a bit random at best.

The file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG
images; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible
without losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check(or Google "RetroPDFs") for more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(www.worldofspectrum.org), and to all the visitors and donators to
RetroPDFs.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
