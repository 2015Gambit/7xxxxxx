,dogdreams,2012-06-08T06:50Z,"do you ppl ever even look at your posts after you have posted them? the second key here that supposedly works is wrong. for one thing, there is no ""="" at the end of the key string, and secondly, the string is too damn short. all i have to say is, ""It's hard to get good help these days."""
