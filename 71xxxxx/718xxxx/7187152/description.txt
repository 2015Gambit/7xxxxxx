SUMMARY/DESCRIPTION
Prince Rama of Ayodhya is a wise and mighty warrior, believed to be an incarnation of the great God Vishnu. His prowess is virtually limitless; he slays mighty demons, wins a contest of strength to marry the beautiful Sita, and before long is announced as the successor to his father’s throne. However, not everyone is happy with this turn of events. King Dasharatha is manipulated into naming another son, Bharata, as heir and banishes Rama to a forest for fourteen years. Accompanied by Sita and his brother Lakshama, Rama lives happily in the forests until the evil King Ravana concocts a dastardly plan to steal Sita away! Now Rama must rescue his wife and defeat the demonic King who has terrorized the land for years.
