If you take the trouble uploading a movie, I asume you like it, why elso would you bother. But I am not you. So, give some information on it too. Just an imdb link would be enough, so that others can see what the movie is about.
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1189340/ is the best guess, although there seems to be a tv miniserie on the story too. And what this ""Freddy twice""is about??? No idea...."
