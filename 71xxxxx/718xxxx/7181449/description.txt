Turns out I forgot 2 files from the CBC set of high resolution episodes - The Bridge and Saturday Night. So I am putting up another torrent with these two and a few after show add-ons from http://www.cbc.ca/video/#/Shows/Love_Lies_Bleeding/

The main torrent is here: thepiratebay.se/torrent/7179427/Love_lies_bleeding_Elton_John_Alberta_Ballet_CBC



What it's all about:

"This is the CBC broadcasting of the Alberta Ballet's show in tribute to Elton John's songs and career. The video files in high resolution M4V format and the full length video of the show in the MP4 format (low quality) were downloaded from http://www.cbc.ca/loveliesbleeding/


The point of the torrent is that only canadian IP addresses are allowed to view the streaming content on CBC's site, while people outside Canada might want to see this show, it's just gorgeous and adds a bizarre flavor to Elton John's music."



My upload speed is not good but at least it's on 24/7.
