The problem with you is your video card., update it or buy a brand new."
,solutioN-Ghost,2012-04-29T17:45Z,"Angry Birds, Rio and Seasons. Are those the final versions? Cause these 3 Angry Birds that I found got different version, some is v1.5.1, v1.6.2,etc which is cracked by THETA and many others I think. So I don't know which one to download although it is obvious that the latest patch version should be downloaded but it seems that there are way too many patch already. I don't know whether there are updates every week,month or so. 

Back to the question : Is this the final version of Angry Birds, Rio and Seasons. For Space I think is still in progress as it is still new and progressing"
