[QUOTE]SYNOPSIS: Ejaz, editor of the monthly ΓÇ£InqalabΓÇ¥ was one day returning after work when he heard a very melodious and sweet voice of woman reciting a poem. He fell in love with the voice and followed it up to the gate of a house. But inspite of all his efforts he could not see the owner of the voice. Some girls in Pardas came out of the house discussing the annual ΓÇÿmushariaΓÇÖ that was to take place at Nawab Baker Ali KhanΓÇÖs house a few days latter. Ejaz went home disappointed for not having seen the face he wanted to see so muchΓÇª.
But now the voice was haunting him day and night and followed him whenever he went and he could not do anything about it. Then he was invited to take part in Nawab Baker Ali KhanΓÇÖs annual ΓÇÿMushairaΓÇÖ! An idea struck him and he recited the same poem which he had heard. The poem and voice belonged to Nawab SahibΓÇÖs Daughter Nazz, who got furious. In her anger she faced Izaz and claimed the poem to be hers. Now Ejaz fell in love with the face as well. This feeling was reciprocated by Naaz also. Naaz was a very sensitive and highly emotional girl. From the very childhood she could not bear any shocks and would loose her voice for a short period if anything happened to upset her. One day lost in EjazΓÇÖs arms, she was seen by her father. He became wild with anger and went after Ejaz with a riffle in his hand. Naaz saw him and due to the shock lost the voice again. The time, perhaps forever.[/QUOTE]
