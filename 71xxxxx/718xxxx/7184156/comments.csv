Here is the Link for the official site.

It has FaQ forum as well as updates for the games files."

,gnoib52,2012-04-18T20:31Z,Brine you torrent is outdated and does include Dark Ascension  nor does it have the current game file or installer.
,brinelol,2012-05-23T18:26Z,"I intentionally left out the game definition and OCTGN installer because they are updated too frequently for torrents to handle, and it's extremely important that the users keep these files updated.  The sets do not get updated very often so a torrent is useful for downloading the bulk of the sets (but not necessarily all of them!)"
