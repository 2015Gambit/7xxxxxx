     Vidya Bagchi arrives in Kolkata from       
     London to find her missing husband.        
     Seven month pregnant and alone in a        
     festive city, she begins a relentless      
     search for her husband. With nothing       
     to rely on except fragment from her        
     memories about him, all clues seem to      
     reach a dead end when everyone tries       
     to convince Vidya that her husband         
     does not exist. She slowly realizes        
     that nothing is what it seems. In a        
     city soaked in lies, Vidya is determined   
     to unravel the truth about her husband     
     - for herself and her unborn child even    
     at the cost her own life.
