,Crusisx,2012-04-17T20:28Z,"Np its compressed in a rar exe file so have the option to just double click on the exe file and extract from there or right click and extract, the videos and images are not downsized so it should be fine as for your download speed sorry for that like a day ago when i uploaded this torrent it had the speed of 2mb per sec  well ill keep seeding this as promised but i think ill give my pc a break tonight its been on 3 consecutive days already, so far ive uploaded 10.5gb of evolution with utorrent and 8.23 gbs with bitorrent"
