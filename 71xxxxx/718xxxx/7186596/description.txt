*DVD Recommended:
With over 4 GBs of data, we recommend that you order a DVD shipment at checkout. Of course, when you order a DVD you can also download while waiting for the shipment to get certain parts that you may need right away. If you have access to a fast internet connection the download will be easier.

These project files are only compatible with After Effects 7 Pro - CS5.

Sup guys this is my first torrent, i don't claim this as my own because i didn't create evolution obviously that credit goes to Andrew Kramer.

Anyways so i'm pretty new to making torrents and i have no idea if this torrent will be either a success or total failure!

All you need to do is extract the files where ever you would like them saved and your done.

Let me know if this torrent works for you O.O
