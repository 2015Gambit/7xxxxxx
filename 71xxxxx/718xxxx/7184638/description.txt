"Dirty Little Secrets"

When Pope & Associates' newest client, DC 
Madam Sharon Marquette, is under 
investigation, the team needs to do 
everything possible to keep her client 
list under wraps. The list is literally 
a Who's Who of DC influentials - and while 
it's Olivia's job to protect her client, 
she finds herself protecting a lot more 
than just the madam. Meanwhile, Quinn runs 
into some trouble with the President's 
former intern, Amanda Tanner.
