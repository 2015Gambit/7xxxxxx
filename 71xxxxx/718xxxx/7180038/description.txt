     PLOT :

      Xavier is now thirty. No longer a student, he is not yet a well-balanced, 
      fullfiiled adult either. His career is unsatisfying : far from being

      jobs such as reporter or ghost writer. His greatest "achievement" 
      in "literature" is his collaboration to the script of a corny TV soap ! 
      His sentimental life is not much better, rhythmed by one night stands 
      and unfinished romances. It looks as if when he seduces a woman beautiful 
      outside and inside such as Kassia or Wendy he can't
