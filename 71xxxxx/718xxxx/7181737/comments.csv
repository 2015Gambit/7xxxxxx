,pxpierre,2012-04-14T02:41Z,"Wikipedia: Newsday's Verne Gay called the series ""fun"", but added, ""All the tropes, cliches and (especially) soap conventions [series creator Shonda Rhimes] has poured so generously into 'Grey's Anatomy' and 'Private Practice' over the years have been poured right back into this Beltway potboiler. The hairpin plot twists. The whiplash character reveals. The bumptious moralizing. The Strong Woman/Wronged Woman character type, and its direct corollary, Weak, Middle-Aged, Married Man Who Secretly Likes Hookers. It's all here! And it's all utterly foolish!"""
