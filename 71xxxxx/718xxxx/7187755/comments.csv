After i install it and click Meny => More => Order Validating, i got a window where it says:
Status: Not Validated
Expiry: 7 Days

Clickable buttons are Validate and Later.
No box to put in the serial you provided.

First time install i pressed the validate button and it says that i cant validate it the first 20 minutes.
After that it says that it has been validated and that i could try it for about 20-30 days (don't remember witch) and then order a key for the full version."
