From the uproariously unrestrained mind of comedian Louis C.K. comes the year's most outrageously original comedy! As a newly-divorced, well-meaning father raising two young daughters, Louie struggles to cope with his strenuous mid-life shake-up, and his stand-up comedy provides a gleefully warped reflection of his hectic, everyday reality. There are disastrous first dates, indecent proposals, high school bullies, booze-addled play dates - and more. Featuring stellar guest stars such as Matthew Broderick and Ricky Gervais, Louie is unfiltered, off-kilter, and hilarious!
