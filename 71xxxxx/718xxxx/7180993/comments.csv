,PaatPiriet,2012-04-13T20:11Z,I started 20 torrents of your re-ups and they simply don't start or stop after a few % your first uploads had the same problem not all of them bud 40% of the first ones. Can you look in to this because there are great soundtracks here.

I will relist all uploads. i'm going to do 50 uploads every 2 days. I will seed for 48hrs or more(each 50 uploads to ensure proper transfer to everyone."
