,Rysco,2012-04-16T08:03Z,AVG picked up 3 trojans with this torrent
,RicePirate,2012-04-16T08:49Z,"Don't worry. I'm using this update myself. Never trust anti viruses when it comes to torrents. My guess is that steam_hooker.dll came up positive? It did for me too.

,RicePirate,2012-04-16T08:55Z,"imo, AVG is only second to Avira in terms of high false positives ^^"
,stegman,2012-04-16T17:42Z,"What about the:
- Sengoku Jidai Unit Pack DLC, and
- Battle Bonus DLC

Are these two present as well?"
,RicePirate,2012-04-17T00:41Z,"I don't think those two are available for download as patches. I could only find them packaged with 'full' game repacks of over 20 gb, so no, its not included. sry :P"
,RicePirate,2012-04-25T07:03Z,"Er, wait. The Sengoku Jidai is included, and the 'battle bonus' was never officially released. My bad :P"
,lagarcha,2012-05-01T21:51Z," when i extract, the files appears with 0 bytes of size, and when i execute shogun.exe an error appears and says that the file is not valid for windows"
,lagarcha,2012-05-01T21:52Z,sry for mi english
,noekk,2012-05-03T21:13Z,"Is this update the really big one that came out when Fall of the Samurai was released  ? Is it the latest version ?

Thanks."
