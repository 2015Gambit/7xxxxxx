[T],liluser,2012-04-13T12:21Z,"so some one put - in Quality
and its not even fully uploaded yet
so that person wont have not even had the chance to test it yet.."
,lort1942,2012-04-13T12:58Z,I'll test this release now. At least you're being very informative on description compared to other releases made by others.
,lort1942,2012-04-13T17:08Z,"This release works like charm. No serial was needed. All updates are integrated, except for a very few. In all, I'm very satisfied with this release. I have had no problems to install this rls.

I wonder, how come you don't release a windows XP professional release? because this version is a student rls."
,Trisson,2012-04-13T17:42Z,"Nothing but perfection! Was searching for a decently up-to-date XP image to replace my old SP2 image which I'd been using forever, and came across this one.

lil-fella's releases are without doubt some of the best (and cleanest) XP torrents available at this point."
[T],liluser,2012-04-13T17:47Z,"its a
windows xp sp3 professional student edition"
,srinumad,2012-04-13T19:57Z,"Thanks for this latest version dude. Your torrents are AWESOME. By you i got a genuine XP on my PC. :):):):):)
Dude can u upload Microsoft office 2010 both 32 & 64 bit with activated version, including latest updates. thanks "
,srinumad,2012-04-13T20:00Z,"Your windows xp pro sp3 is 100% virus free. passes GENUINE validation. No cracks, No serial. 
Burn- boot- install- all done. All works fine :)"
,aleksa64,2012-04-13T20:35Z,"The best, thank you."
,GeenStaat,2012-04-14T17:46Z,"Directx 9 Runtimes June 2011? Is that a typo? Should be 2010, right? Why not Java7u3, instead of Developer Preview Release?"
,nero_n3000,2012-04-16T19:46Z,good work lil fella

Stay away from other people's uploads with your annoying comments.
If you advertise or try to promote your uploads on other trusted/VIP torrents, i will ban the whole account of yours.

Keep flamewars and ""trollacting"" out of TPB.You're a trusted member,act like one!!

That's it,learn from it and move on.Won't be more warnings after this one.Hope you get the hint.

,roy2646,2012-04-27T22:30Z,"@ liluser I have a question: regarding windows 7 activator daz loader, is it after 6 mos. will it deactivate the windows and need to uninstall and reinstall again?"
,extracube,2012-04-29T12:27Z,"liluser

I already downloaded your January edition (first, not REV 2).  However, I didn't install that yet.

Should I download THIS one first, or is the January student edition good enough?"
,Lefty85,2012-04-30T13:24Z,"thank you man

,Lefty85,2012-04-30T15:04Z,"ok man im done installing it....

[T],allal123,2012-05-04T02:15Z,"hi my friend liluser 

we are still waiting for ""May 2012"" release or big DVD version :)"
,nimicas,2012-05-09T21:39Z,"OK, very professional work, except one thing. When the OS installations and other stuff completes , driver unpacking begins, but there are some problems with it. Not all the drivers are installed properly and I had to install it manually, if I hadn't had my personal driver pack or a CD, there could have been a problem with sound and VGA drivers, although the PC I installed the OS was an oldie... I hope for a better and suitable to all Hardware and PC''s , Driver PACK, but still try to compress the CD's image to a 700 MB."
[T],liluser,2012-05-11T10:21Z,"@ nimicas  there is not enough room on a 700MB cd for all driverpacks..
roughly 900MB for just driverpacks alone"
,nimicas,2012-05-11T22:55Z,"liluser, you're a master mind of sotfware, figer it out, there's always a solution, i respect you very much, but when i didn;t find sound and vga drivers automated instalation on old pc... well it was shit, i had to isntall it manually... i love your work, it's the only issue here, you have created a masterpiece of OS... i think it's the most important version of the OS edition..."
[T],liluser,2012-05-12T11:45Z,only way to have loads of driverpacks included is to make a DVD version
,nimicas,2012-05-12T15:06Z,"Or maybe a standalone CD and another great driver pack beside it? I don't know , anyway I use your OS ant they work perfectly, some processes could be shutdown in this OS cause used rarely in xp to make more efficient VERSION"
[T],liluser,2012-05-12T19:35Z,"i normally do that in my gamers edition i make then it runs very fast.. hence very stripped down version..

but like to keep the Corporate fairly normal so its able to be used by many people and many devices and apps"
,extracube,2012-06-30T17:13Z,"@Nimicas, although I didn't install this particular torrent, I ran into same problem as you.  However, it was easy -- I had my video card CD rom so I quickly installed that driver, and then I went to my motherboard maker online and got sound driver for my board -- easy as pie."
