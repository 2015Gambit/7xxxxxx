,Officefx,2012-04-16T00:51Z,".ill wait for dvd or blue ray to watch this one


what was the point of you even posting if your not downloading the file and waiting for dvd or blu ray, might i remind you it says CAM in the file what made you think it was going to be an excellent copy????"
,reowner,2012-04-16T04:29Z,thanks
,maxmaxpayne,2012-04-16T07:40Z,"Froggie, in all the near perfect TS cam's there is always one major flaw that always looks easily avoidable. i wonder what the flaw will be in the good TS of Battleship, i guess a picture and sound glitch, the duo."
,12efr3shing,2012-04-16T15:17Z,anyone knows the name of the song that plays after the final battle? I think it's during the time when they receive medals and stuff?

,nairobi19,2012-04-16T15:37Z,"A = 5
V = -34"
,breadman11,2012-04-16T16:07Z,Why? Isn't it possible to Put the Audio from this over the audio from the Italian one? Tweak around abit...and you have a near perfect copy?
,zmogusnr1,2012-04-16T20:26Z,Im not using any of those downloads since they ask my pin code.
,breadman11,2012-04-16T22:21Z,"Any Way scores are
A: 6
V: 0
Its Unwatchable and The Audio is Good but not perfect!"
,smokey_pt2,2012-04-17T02:53Z,"Thanks for the effort, but the video is unwatchable.
I tried putting the audio to the italian version but its a pain in the ass with the 2 versions not quite the same (This one has 6 mins extra footage) and all my attempts have had the audio out of sync :( Will wait for a better copy.  Seen it at cinema and will probably end up buying it just to support this type of movie.  Thanks for the effort though, keep it up :)"
,dayglo666,2012-04-17T03:30Z,this up is an insult to all who use pb
,Cashy01,2012-04-17T08:40Z,"To all those out there baggin out Froggie, THINK for a moment numskulls, The uploaders are riskin jail time if they are caught, just for giving people freedom of choice for free. They try their best to get the uploads to you as quick as possible.
 they cannot help what quailty they have aint their best, but they try, better than most people who think it is their god given right just to bag them out if something aint right.

Keep up the good fight Froggie, to the idiots out there,

GROW A BRAIN CELL RETARDS!!! "

,scotkio,2012-04-17T22:25Z,"thanks for trying to put this on here, i usually watch everything, even japanese speaking films, but this one is really bad. thanks though"
,barry9271,2012-04-19T16:04Z,this movie is a waste of time as the copy is crap i am suprised as this uploader is normaly good but i dont know why they wasted their time putting this shit on as it is a realy bad copy and it should be removed....... sorry for being so negative but cmon ......
,spifkitten99,2012-04-21T10:31Z,"Why does nobody make good cams anymore?

There used to be cams that were infinitely better than the complete crap that comes these days.


It's like there is a new generation, that doesn't know what they are doing, and have no concept of quality or in any way doing things properly.

They fuck it up both when recording it, and when re-encoding it. Stop cropping it to death."
