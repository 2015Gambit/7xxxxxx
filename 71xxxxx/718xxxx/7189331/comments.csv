,mitcheg,2012-04-16T20:45Z,There is a version of this torrent that has been defaced with idiotic comments. THIS version has been uploaded so the people can access the ORIGINAL  without the dumb comments. Please seed and promote - it's a great documentary that may mean a lot to a lot of people.  
,mitcheg,2012-04-16T23:03Z,Just noticed I only did 1/2 the bloody thing -I;ll do the rest tomorrow -  
,mitcheg,2012-04-17T20:38Z,PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. THE UPLOADER (ME) GOOFED UP AND CREATED A FILE  1/4 OF THE REAL SIZE. THE DUMB UPLOADER (ME) IS CURRENTLY RIPPING A NEW VERSION THAT WILL BE UP THIS EVENING AND HAVE THE FULL VIDEO ... SORRY - 
,thagoatster,2012-04-18T11:01Z,"Wondered why it stopped after about 20 minutes, lol. Looking forward to seeing the whole documentary :) thanks for your efforts mitcheg ;)"
,LJE111,2012-07-31T03:06Z,"So wondering if it is ok to dl now... I don't see a later version posted so I am guessing this one was fixed?

Thanks mitcheg - can't wait to watch this!"
,LJE111,2012-08-01T05:58Z,"Stuck at 10% - can someone please seed? 

Very, very appreciated! :-D"
,LJE111,2012-08-04T11:12Z,Too bad the uploader didn't bother to fix this as promised. It should be  from Pirate Bay - only 21 minutes has been uploaded. A complete waste of time. I will not seed this.
,LJE111,2012-08-06T03:06Z,"Ok - figured this out, but it's still not good news...

Metcheg uploaded a new version of this (presumably the full upload this time) located at: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7159575/WHAT_ON_EARTH. The bad news is it is not being seeded.
This begs the question why this torrent wasn’t taken down – and why is it being seeded? Anyway – save yourself the time and DO NOT DL THIS VERSIOIN, you will only get about 20 minutes. 20 minutes of great quality by-the-way. Hmmm…
anyone else wondering if this is a set up by the producer? These two torrents just happen to be the ONLY uploads by metcheg: this torrent (the 20 minute “preview”) is left up as a “mistake” but continues to be seeded, while the so-called full version has no seeds. Who takes the time to upload something but then fails to seed it?"

""...it should be REMOVED from TPB"".

Don't bother to DL this - its just a preview."
