So this is a book, or story that I have written, and I just wanna get it out to everybody and figured I would upload it as a torrent, you can check it out by clicking on the link at the bottom of the description.

I just want to start off saying that this is just a project and is not intended to actually be amazing or get any views at all, I just have an obsession and I thought maybe one or two very bored readers might enjoy reading this story. It will be made into somewhat like a memoir or maybe not, I have not decided and truthfully I will make up everything as I go on and on. The name though comes from the fact of Zombies, wanting brains and when I thought of brains I thought of that. Though the name may change to something way better as the story comes along. I would bore you with a long list of people I would like to thank but I won't do that, I just want to cut to the chase and that my reader will begin as soon as the next sun rises. i have my favorite zombie bracelet on and a mind full of zombie knowledge and gaming that will help me shape these zombies into what I want them to be and later on I will post sketches of what they look like, but for now I will play my role as the main character in the story because it is easier for me to write in first person than in third, and it gives you a realistic point of view. I bid you all a farewell as I grab my shotgun and brigade all my windows and doors, because Zombies are everywhere around me...
