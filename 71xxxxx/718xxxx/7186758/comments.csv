This is an independent movie and was made purely on donations from people like you and me, they have no big corporation sponsors or affiliates. They are trying to make another ferret movie and are working to try and legalize ferrets in California. Again this new movie is all donation based. Please if you must download this movie at least make a donation towards their next movie the link of which can be found on their Facebook page. Normally I love that you can download anything here but this film maker only survives on donations so money lost because of pirating is a crucial blow unlike movies from big box companies. I really want to see their next movie be made a reality but they need all the money they can get to make it so..."
