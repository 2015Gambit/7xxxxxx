Okey, so there is like different releases of this album. The 1999 version has a extra song and vocal edits of some of the songs from the 1998 release. I've also included a "Bonus disc" that I got with the 1998 version album.

The 1998version and bonus disc are both ripped with EAC, and I found the 1999 version on the net.

Everything includes R128gain replaygain tags.
