Barry Goudreau of Boston decided to make a solo album in 1980.
He brought most of Boston with him for this self titled album.
Brad Delp and Fran Cosmo handles the vocals and Sib Hashian also from Boston plays the drums.

This was Goudreau's first solo album, and it should have been Boston's third album.

Only the most die-hard Boston fans would notice the absence of Tom Scholtz.
The rest of the band sounds great! It's the same great Boston sound as the first Boston album.

A must-have for any Boston fan. 
One of the best albums nobody remembers or has heard of. 

Enjoy! ? please comment ? and seed.
