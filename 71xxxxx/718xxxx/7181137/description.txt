** Important, The folder "Grand Theft Auto San Andreas PC" is the game file. The other folder "Saved Game 100% Complete" is the saved data that you have the option to install. Instructions are in the folder as well. **

This is really easy to install. I've added a crack so you don't need to mount images or install anything. The only thing you have to do is extract the files to wherever you want to locate them i.e Documents. Once you do that, run the .exe and that's it!


There's no bugs that I am aware of. It works for me and several other people perfectly. Even when you install San Andreas Multiplayer.


Hope you enjoy the game as much as we do.
