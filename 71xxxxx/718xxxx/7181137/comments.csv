,zXMonsterz,2012-04-15T02:55Z,"hypedDLS when I tried using the san andreas multiplayer it said that I needed a password to actually spawn on the server, any chance you could pm me the password?"
,hypedDLS,2012-04-15T15:00Z,"That depends on which server you try and go on. There's hundreds of servers, most are public (Which have a green lock) and some private (Red lock) so unless you have the password, you can't get on.
Every time you try and join a server it will have a box for a password, just press connect. But SAMP has nothing to do with this torrent :P If you're new to samp though, just type a name at the top something like David_Smith and select a server. Most you'll make an account. That's you!"

,Nit3wolf,2012-04-16T07:35Z,it wont work for me im running it on windows 7 64 bit it try's to start then says something about windows color scheme has been switched to windows 7 basic and quits. any help be appreciated 
,hypedDLS,2012-04-16T21:25Z,"Because it's an old game, it doesn't work with windows taskbar color scheme (I'm sure it's called Windows Aero) Basically, it changes it to the plain color. I'm not sure why the game won't load though. Try and delete the files and then extract again. Make sure you extract all files that's in the game one. If that doesn't work, comment again and I will make a new torrent. All the best."
,Nit3wolf,2012-04-16T23:33Z,it works now thank you so much. wonder why it wasn't working the first time thanks. ill let you know if i come across any freezes or bugs :)
,hypedDLS,2012-04-17T02:53Z,"It's happened with me a few times. The game bugs a lot (Not just my torrent, even if you buy the game) all you need to do is delete and extract again :) also,  new the s0beit mod doesn't work on SA. It's not compatible on normal game. But in SAMP it works. All the best!"
,asdfian,2012-04-18T01:03Z,"i completely installed game, i mounted it to drive F using powerISO, and i go to play it, it changes color scheme, but then it pops up with a message saying ""No disc inserted. Please insert the CD/DVD."" im lost, please help? haha."
,hypedDLS,2012-04-18T18:25Z,You don't need to mount anything haha. Just extract the files to documents or any other place using winrar. Then run the gta_sa.exe and the game will work. The color scheme changes because it's an old game therefore the Windows Aero doesn't support it. As soon as the game closes it changes back.
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-04-26T02:00Z,"downloading now and it says 34 minute eta. hope everything turns out okay, i am mostly downloading for multiplayer"
,dasjacobfilms,2012-04-28T04:02Z,Hey HypedDLS I am having issues when I click gta_sa.exe it begins saying GTA_has stopped working what do I do? 
,hypedDLS,2012-04-28T16:01Z,"@dasjacobfilms, this error occurs sometimes, all you have to do it delete  where you extracted San Andreas (I.e Documents) then extract back again. As far as I know, it does that with the original disk aswell. "
,adsgrant,2012-04-29T23:34Z,"hi every time i try to extract this file i get to 34% and it says ' read error in the file C:Documents and SettingsAdministratorMy DocumentsBit LordGTA SA PC.rar' with retry or cancel options and a seperate window opening up called 'WinRAR: Diagnostic messages' saying The drive cannot find the data requested' and options  'close', 'break operation' and 'copy to clipboard' help what do i do?

,bostock9255,2012-05-02T23:35Z,"Great Torrent! Thanks! BUT, played it, did a few levels, closed it, BAM. Gone! Can't find it anywhere in the computer, what was it called again though... GTA SA IO Launcher or something :S, please tell me the name of the launcher thing guys, much appreciated.  "
,DaveEggo,2012-05-03T21:53Z,im running on mac and when i open the exe file its just white screen? please help :)
,BigJoeJoyce,2012-05-11T20:00Z,"When I get to the title screen, the game closes and I get the message ""gta_sa.exe has stopped working"" I've done what you said and deleted the folder and re-extracted, but to no avail. Any idea how I can fix this? I'll vote you up anyway, because it is a great torrent and it could be just a problem on my end."
,hypedDLS,2012-05-12T01:37Z,"Sorry guys for this happening. It rarely breaks for me or my friends (Unless we have mods, hacks installed) All I can say sadly is to delete and re-extract the files. If that still doesn't work, run the file as an administrator or make sure you don't have to much files running.If this problem keeps occurring don't hesitate to leave a message and I will try and make a newer crack, or just upload the disks and tell you how to mount them. Sorry for any inconvenience."

,www.baixandojogos.net,2012-07-24T23:39Z,"eu quero baixar em link direto o Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
e bom seria se ele tivesse um patch online!"
,-Tang,2012-07-25T11:35Z,"So I picked up this game and may I say it works GREAT. Haven't run into a bug/glitch/not even lag. Great job hpyedDLS!
But I do have a question.
I opened winRAR to extract the gta_sa.exe for the first time. That took about 8 minutes, which I was fine with. So I played it for a couple of hours and finally closed it down.
But now, how can I open it back up without extracting it all over again?
I'm really not interested in waiting 10 minutes everytime I want to play it.
Can anyone explain a more convenient way of opening it up and playing?
Thanks!
-Tang"
,-Tang,2012-07-25T20:55Z,"I've run into a problem:
After completing the mission with OG Loc where you steal the sound system from the beach (how ironic) my SFX sounds completely cut out. It's not my headphones because the radio still works fine, and the SFX were working before the mission so I know the volume isn't too low.
I thought maybe going into a place would fix it, so I walked into Well Stacked Pizza Co. and all I heard was a light mumble and plates and glasses clinking. When I approached the cashier I couldn't hear him talk, and when I walked back outside I still heard nothing.
I even tried doing a mission. During the cutscene of the mission everything went swimmingly, but when Big Smoke and I got back outside, I heard no SFX.
PLEASE help. I can't just not play without sounds. This is a serious issue for me."
,-Tang,2012-07-25T21:22Z,"FUCK!
Answer me back already, lol.
I'm tired of playing this silently! :P"
,-Tang,2012-07-26T03:27Z,"Yes I realize I've posted four times but I have another problem.
I was trying to extract the files into a more convenient folder for easier access and somewhere along the way I completely fucked something up because when I try to run the gta_sa.exe file a Microsoft Error message comes up saying it has ""Encountered a problem"".
I thought maybe I just needed to re-download everything so I spent the hour and a half RE-downloading and it did the same thing.
I'm pissed now and any help would be greatly appreciated.
Also, it would be great if there was a way I could keep my save from my previous game. I don't really know how these things work, it was pretty simple at first, and now I'm completely lost.
I don't even know if you guys are still going to this and reading the messages but I really need some help.

,xxdarkragexx,2012-07-27T09:22Z,"Hey. I noticed that when I put in my PS2 disc, it has models materials, everything. But on this, I only get the audio models and a few others. I would absolutely LOVE to do some car mods and maybe some player mods. Unfortunately, from the looks of it, I cannot do this. (And yes, I know you can only mod the PC versions...)"
