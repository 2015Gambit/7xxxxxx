,Timewarp43,2012-04-15T04:18Z,"Sorry if the torrent isn't seeding, there's a problem with my DHT that i'm working the problem of right now. Thank you for your patience."
,Timewarp43,2012-04-15T04:28Z,"Seeding is fixed, downloading appears functional."
,ilnex,2012-04-15T17:37Z,seems it isn't fixed. alot of 30.3% 
,Timewarp43,2012-04-15T20:20Z,"Yeah I can't seed at night, but I normally seed all day. Thank you for your patience."
,Timewarp43,2012-04-15T22:18Z,"Okay, it'll be fatal of me not to mention this: Before you select ""New Game"" you have to enter the ""Extras"" section and select ""Part 1 Conversion"". Illias will tell you to copy the Arc.nsa file (You actually don't need to do that, I already took care of it before I uploaded). Just follow through with the dialogue and the game will return you to the title screen and you can start a new game in Part 1 from there. Enjoy!"
,cool_2010,2012-04-16T19:51Z,"i've combined part 1 using the part1 conversion and the game starts from part 1. However, i am unable to save even at the save points.when i click save it takes me to save screen. i select a save slot and click..a popup comes with certain text..press OK and it should save..however it does not.
another thing. after quitting and restarting the game  i have  to patch it again to version 1..am i doing something wrong?"
,Timewarp43,2012-04-19T13:10Z,"Are you sure that you're saving at the save prompts when it says: ""Save location""?"
,voldman99,2012-04-29T00:50Z,"Where do you extract these files to?

How do you install this?

There are 2 readme.txt files, neither seem to have installation instructions."
,Timewarp43,2012-04-30T18:21Z,"You don't need to install it, just extract the files to wherever you'd like, follow the below instructions in the comments section, and play the game. That's all that there is to it."
,Darkkishin,2012-05-04T11:26Z,"when i go to download it, it says there are no files to download...what happened?"
,Arenlor,2012-05-09T10:52Z,"It all seems fine to me, and it's an enjoyable game so far."
,Timewarp43,2012-05-09T20:43Z,"Your torrent client doesn't display the files you are downloading when you are using a Magnet Link. If you are downloading via .torrent file, then you can select the individual files you wish to download. This option is most convenient when one wishes to download an individual song or album from a music torrent."
,Fate413,2012-05-10T05:44Z,"The game keeps freezing my computer (the audio is stuck looping and everything) for a few seconds every time I try to move my mouse. Is anyone else having this problem, or...is there an issue with how I extracted the RAR?"
,blahb1,2012-05-25T22:57Z,I am having difficulty importing the save file from part 1 to part 2. I didnt understand what the site meant when they said to copy global.sav from part 1 to part 2's save folder since I only have 1 save folder upon extracting this game. 
,Vapnam,2012-07-12T00:09Z,There were two crappy viruses in the mod folder I can't recall where they were specifically. One is an .exe file and the other a .zip file. Just delete these files and you should probably be fine.
,viccity1,2012-07-17T02:37Z,"I also am unable to save at the given points. if i click on ""save location"" it just continues with the story. Solution? "
,lampane,2012-07-31T23:21Z,"Hi, I can't seem to be able to play part One. I did the save thing, before i started a new game. Started a new game, and it throws me right onto part 2. I think. Atleast it doesnt mention part one in the slightest."
,Jacecam32,2012-08-04T00:09Z,I can't get part one to work. can anyone help?
,Wolfwod,2012-08-04T02:02Z,"@Jacecam32. I had the same problem. Just start the game normally and go to extras->part 1 conversion. After that, start a new game. I don't know if it is normal but the title screen doesn't change. BTW, someone knows the version of the english patches?"
,lampane,2012-08-08T15:34Z,"Ah, nevermind. I did play through part 1 and part 2 without realizing it. Well, this was a fun game."
,Junky_Cat,2012-08-09T11:32Z,"The torrent works perfect, all you do is unrar the files and go to extras and click ""part 1 conversion"" and you are set."
,aerozord,2012-09-04T11:09Z,"cant get english patch to work.  unzipped it, tried both .exe files, and it appears to work but most of the text is just "" "" "" "" "
