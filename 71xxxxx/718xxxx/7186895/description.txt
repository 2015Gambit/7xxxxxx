Translated from the artist's page on their net label's
official web site:

"Stoner/blues-hard-rock trio made up of ZÃ© Roberto at the
guitar and vocals, Joni at the drums, and Puto at the bass,
they have an unshakable stage hunger and a seventies
inspiration via Graveyard, from Sweden, and Radio Moscow,
from North America."

Free debut album from this Portuguese act. Downloaded from
the artist's Bandcamp store, including front cover, ID3
tags and file names cleaned up, and everything packed comme
il faut. No reencoding, of course.
