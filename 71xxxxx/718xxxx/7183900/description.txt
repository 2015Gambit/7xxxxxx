Shape of Despair is a funeral doom metal band from Finland.
Shape of Despair is a pioneer of an inimitable, haunting, and intricately woven style of music. While the exact genre classification has remained open to debate by many in the metal community, there is a consensus about their importance, place and influence in the metal and musical world. Some of the styles they have been tagged with include melodic Death/doom and atmospheric funeral doom metal with Gothic metal elements. The difficulty in classifying the band under one specific metal sub-genre is a result of the inherent complexity with which they operate musically.
