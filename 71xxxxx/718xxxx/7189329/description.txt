S02E03: The Battering Ram Gang 

During a two year reign of terror across the UK, a gang of ruthless criminals targeted cash-in-transit vans and high security depots stealing a total of ┬ú1.1 million. 

The gang, comprising of criminals from Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham had a highly elaborate, but effective method of welding battering rams to heavy goods vehicles, and driving them into their targets. 

It took a nationwide Police operation to finally bring the thieves to justice, but not before the gang had managed to steal a Police vehicle and flee the scene. 

The investigation ended in one of the largest recoveries of cash ever made in the country, with almost ┬ú1 million seized and given back to its rightful owners.
