This is my first upload and I know it will work because I took this shield from my xbox 360 account and put it on my pc account for borderlands

Unrar this once u download then follow the instructions below its simple i mite not hav explained it that well but u can look on youtube if u cant follow it and if comments r good i will put up a modded shotgun aswell

First of all you need willowtree
once u hav that open willowtree go to open
find where your borderlands save is usually C:Users(username)DocumentsMy GamesBorderlandsSaveData
then u will go to items and in the left hand column u click insert and find this file it should just be a word document or sumthing like that called (Omega Omega) just click on that then go to save or save as if u wanna play it safe and then this shield should be in your backpack when u play
ENJOY THIS!!! :P
