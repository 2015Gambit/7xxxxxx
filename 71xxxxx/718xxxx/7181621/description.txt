ISOLATED VOCALS DRUMS GUITAR BASS PIANO SYNTH LOOPS 2012     

Almost all tracks extracted from original recordings, The isolated tracks are from youtube, the drum loops and synth loops
I've also extracted taken from original recordings, it took me awhile with all the editing but was worth the effort, i put these on my mp3 player and can use them anywhere theres an amp or stereo, most are eq'ed and ready for any live band or jamming, you'd be surprised how many hit songs use these drum and synth loops in the background.

Some of these are experimental, was fun making these, trying to find songs that were loopable was the hard part, listened to a few hundred songs to get these loops.

I used AUDACITY for making the drum and synth loops and editing, it's FREE

**If using these in a Band plug the output into a VOLUME PEDAL then into a PA Amp or Keyboard Amp to be dynamic, make sure the drummer can hear the tracks also, good to have it through a monitor for live playing and also a metronome**

Have Fun
