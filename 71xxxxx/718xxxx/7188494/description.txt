Notes:

Consistently voted as one of the top 10 'must-have' reggae albums of all time. This solid reworking of classic Studio One tracks by Steely and Clevie is a delight in its positivity and energy. This is not Dub Rebel music but the actual music that West Indians live and love by. A testament to the truth that the 'frontline' is sometimes in your heart.
