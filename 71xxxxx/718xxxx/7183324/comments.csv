But I hear you. It will for sure not be my favorite album.

It's solid piece of work, no doubt. The arrangements may even be to clear for the good old pirate sound.

It's definitely recognizable as Running Wild.

For me, it's like with Blind Guardian, the new albums just don't do anything for me anymore.

Technical brilliance is one thing, but it's not enough.

As for the torrent: Superb quality of course! 

What do you say, I'm just 30 and feel old.
Let's put a band together, and bring some oldschool! ;D"
