---------------------------------------------------

Numen  is  a  Greek  mythology-themed    action
role-playing game. The  player's  character  levels
up by killing monsters and completing quests,  upon
which their abilities improve. Some skills  improve
automatically based on the abilities performed, but
the player may  also  allocate  points.  Combat  is
real-time, but the mechanics are  likened  more  to
those of MMORPGs rather than  the  hack  and  slash
genre.
