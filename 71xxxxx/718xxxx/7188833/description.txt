Episode description:
In its season finale, Marketplace expands on its popular "Busted" segment with an hour-long special, The Busted Edition. Co-hosts Erica Johnson and Tom Harrington report on shocking claims and shoddy services that drive Canadians crazy. It's an hour of television that will have the country shouting, "You're Busted!" at their TV sets.

Anti-viral tissue claims, bank fees, outrageous markups at a national car service chain, cable and phone service charges, fast-food marketing spin, extended warranty fine print -- even charities and government watchdogs get "busted" by Marketplace in this wide-ranging exposé.
