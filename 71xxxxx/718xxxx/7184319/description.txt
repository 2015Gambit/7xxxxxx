Benjamin Disraeli (1804-1881) remains one of the most colorful figures of Victorian England. He authored a number of relatively successful novels, but is better remembered as a towering presence in Victorian politics. He served in government for three decades, serving both as Chancellor of the Exchequer and as Prime Minister. His political career was famous for creating the modern Conservative Party in England, and infamous for his rivalry with his political nemesis, William Gladstone.

In 1978, the BBC filmed a biopic on Disraeli, one that focused on his personal life as well as his political one. Starring relative unknown (at the time) Ian McShane as Disraeli, the movie was broadcast on PBS' Masterpiece Theatre in 1980. A&E now brings this movie to DVD.

Disraeli overcame a number of obstacles to achieve the pinnacle of English politics. Although he studied law, he decided to pursue a more public life. He had hoped to write poetry, but was forced to write popular romances to keep his creditors at bay. His initial forays into politics met with failure, but at length he was elected to the House of Commons. He was initially mistrusted by all, partly because of his flamboyanceΓÇöhe had a penchant for fine clothesΓÇöpartly because of his intelligence and wit, and, possibly most of all, because of his Jewish heritage. At length he rose in the leadership of the Conservative Party, becoming the champion of the Reform Act of 1867, which enfranchised every adult male householder. He became Prime Minister in 1868, but was defeated in the following general election. Six years later, the Conservative Party returned to power, and Disraeli served an additional six years as PM. He was a shrewd statesman, expanding Britain's imperial holdings, and keeping both Russia and Germany in check. His party was voted out of office in 1880, and Disraeli died in 1881. The movie covers 1835-1881.
