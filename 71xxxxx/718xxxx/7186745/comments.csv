,popeye013,2012-04-15T03:50Z,"So, over 600+ have the complete file, yet not one of them bothered to comment on A & V !!!!!....

Will there be a TV rip soon at all?"
,Uralder,2012-04-15T04:18Z,"THIS IS AWESOOOME!! I worked all night and couldn't watch this live so I avoided the internet all together, until I could download it here when I got home. Please seed people :) You're great!

.. I also became a member just to write this post"
,Uralder,2012-04-15T04:20Z,I'll post a comment on A/V when I've checked the vid!
,Uralder,2012-04-15T04:58Z,"A 10
V 10"
,Uralder,2012-04-15T05:06Z,"Sorry, after 10 minutes A/V goes down to 6"
,jimijimijimi,2012-04-15T05:53Z,Thanks to the uploader. People who are picky about audio/visual might not enjoy this - moves between 5-8 rating from A/V. Watchable.
,GamingIndustryBlows,2012-04-15T06:02Z,"It's the UFC tv thing so unless you take it off ""best available"" for image quality, you are going to get changing picture. Set it to 3000 and then leave it.

A-4
V-4

Gonna keep watching and hope it gets better."
,GamingIndustryBlows,2012-04-15T06:07Z,As maybe bump it up to A:5 and V: 5 as a webstream.
,fieldstone,2012-04-15T06:35Z,Thank you........

A: 1 (seriously out of sync)"
,spelonkar,2012-04-15T10:16Z,"V- goes from Ok to shit, still watchable if you must
A- goes out of sync pretty horribly, 2.00 seemed to adjust it correctly but then VLC seemed to get angry about it and stop playing the audio all together randomly "
,A_Dying_Baby,2012-04-15T10:43Z,"thanks a bunch!

,swemixer,2012-04-15T15:53Z,Fucked up quality. Ruin alot of the fun. 
,Moonspire,2012-04-15T15:59Z,"The quality of the video and the audio is a true disgrace, like the whole thing was recorded with the cheapest Webcam. The quasy grab/dub artist who are doing the crap like this video is, should be banned from the planet Earth. Please avoid it, and ban the ape who uploaded it and wasted some peoples time. "
,wertham,2012-04-15T19:16Z,many thanks for the great work!
,Mantis69,2012-04-15T23:35Z,"A/V  Looks and sounds like a copy of a copy of a VHS recording.  Thanks, but no thanks."
,artbell2,2012-04-16T02:00Z,"Audio is waay out of sync. Very aggravating to watch and a waste of 1.62gb. 

But big thanks to the uploader for taking the time and effort. "

,evilchadercheez,2012-04-16T03:11Z,"hey JAYOcarlow why don't you stfu and realize that comments about audio and video quality are only meant to be a reflection of this torrent in particular.  the quality for this is shit and there's nothing more or less that needs to be said.  it has nothing to do with showing appreciation or any of that nonsense.  in the end, the quality is still very poor and people should look elsewhere."
,panther66,2012-04-16T09:11Z,Quality is too low. I have to delete and download a better quality torrent. What a waste of time.
,deadzior,2012-04-16T16:56Z,wtf 50% and no seeding
