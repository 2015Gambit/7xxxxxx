,LuxLOL,2012-04-13T20:50Z,"You can use nLite for that.
And the Themes can be also include without nLite by simply ziping the Themes with 7-zip and then by putting them in the ""(source)OEMRunOnceThemes"" folder."

,maduke52,2012-04-20T21:46Z,"I could tell by the way this was described as well as your responses to people that you are sincere and I appreciate it IMMENSELY.  I have to do a full XP install on a system I tried upgrading to 7 and the 7 was bootleg, and need I go on? ahhhhhh
Thank you so much!"
,Legofreak73,2012-04-21T01:27Z,"sooooo... 

1) the USB drive doesnt work when I try to install it. I used PowerIso to write the CD data to a USB drive. When I go to the boot menu and select the USB / Removable Media option, the screen goes black with that little grey line forever blinking at the top left corner of the screen. 

2) I tried to solve the above problem by using a 700MB disc. Some of the folders had an error when copying to the disc, like the Extra Programs. I cant remember the rest... but I pop the disc to my xp and the Windows XP Installation popped up. I cant seem to get the right product key. Of all things... lol. I know your the programmer... but any help would be greatly appreciated. "
,LuxLOL,2012-04-21T11:51Z,"First you should read the Read Me file.

1. Use WinToFlash and not a ISO editor to install Windows XP from an USB flash driver.
2. Clean your CD-ROM drive or use a working one that's not 4 years old or try to burn the CD at a slow speed.
3. This Windows XP is not for Upgrading you must make a clean installation on a formatted Hard disk drive or Partition.

All this you could find in the Read Me file."
,ManinBlue,2012-04-22T07:09Z,"awesome torrent! fast download 1.5 MB/s avg.

,Legofreak73,2012-04-25T17:34Z,"my hd is 90 GB and I already partitioned Ubuntu for 7.68 GB. I'm looking to install mac osx snow leopard on my latitude d620 also... i just need to resize/reformat/reinstall the xp partition. I'm doing the Win to Flash as i type with your recommendations above... but when you say it needs to be a formatted partition, does that mean a blank one, because I cant reformat it. I go to disk management and right click on my xp partition, and I cant click on the format/delete/erase partition option. I tried to use another program (Aomei Partition Assistant), but was not successful. I just need help with the reformatting of a partition :( I don't want to reformat the whole hd because of Ubuntu. Even if i wanted to, I'm not sure I could, because reformatting the hd while running the formatter is just ridiculous. "
,Legofreak73,2012-04-25T17:43Z,"i got farther than i did last time... but it gives me ""the file dmload.sys could not be found. Press any key to continue"" what should i do?"
