,libertaswv,2012-04-16T23:16Z,"TvTeam churns out a stunning & unparalleled number of seeds every day of the year, from at least 3 freakin' continents. If they get a bit behind on their info, so be it. Pretty sure it's not too tough to hit a search engine and post helpful info, as babyblue demonstrated.

This doc, though interesting, is unintentionally hilarious. Paraphrasing.... 'The Nazis distorted the facts to give the impression that there was a wealthy class in England, and they were more concerned with profit than with the safety of their workers or passengers.' 

Lol..... Yes, History Channel..... Unlike the Nazis, we had NICE capitalists, who always put profit second.... After all, rich and poor alike are all decent, community-minded citizens, working together for a brighter tomorrow for all....  Right? lol! :)

Thx to TvTeam and all s/l's.... Much appreciated."
