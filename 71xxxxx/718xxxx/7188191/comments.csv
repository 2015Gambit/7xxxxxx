,soletar,2012-04-16T05:35Z,"Dear YIFY,

1stly, thanks for all your work and generosity. All your work are top shelf material , i see you as the new Mr Kickass or Axxo. A legend in short. Keep it up.

I have a small grouse with you. Your early torrents used to be between 450-500MB... I remember your Taken 2008 was like 298MB. These films were small in size and made download faster and yet still retained their astonishing clarity. Your recent uploads now are relatively big 600-1.8GB. You have your skull now so why kiss the ass of the we want 1G crowd?. Pls remember you achieved ur fame on the basis of those small downloads. I appreciate your work and am still downloading ur stuff but some people have very low bandwidths and speeds..... .THANKS "
,soletar,2012-04-16T05:36Z,"Why not-

450MB- small for the slow connection downloaders

and

1G- for the 'i want super-clear stuff' crowd


at least, 450MB (low), 600MB (medium), 1G (high). Skip the medium one, i have noticed you are doing 2 versions these days. thanks again.sorry for ranting but remember ur past pls. I remember those old 007 uploads and complete series that were small in size, great in quality etc..... PLS REPLY "

,bec9211,2012-04-16T06:43Z,why hwen i play all these mp4 format movies in vlc do they start to play normal for a minute and than get all choppy and im not able to fix them?....any suggestions?
,samjnr,2012-04-16T09:06Z,@soletar instead of delivering a list of orders in triplicate how about you upload it?! wtf
,Avnit,2012-04-16T09:34Z,so much seeders but why my download speed is still slow??
,bktheman,2012-04-16T10:02Z,"umm yah... could u start making 540p rips too sir?
average size 400-600 mb"
,Elisma,2012-04-16T11:08Z,"Hi YIFY, don't wanna seem ungrateful but this release is unwatchable for me - Audio is CRAP, at just 64 kbps! It's a shame that good video doesn't go hand in hand with audio of the same quality..."
,rottzz,2012-04-16T13:50Z,"@soletar : dude, stop grumbling & jus feel happy for da quality..
hello YiFY.. 'Elisma' does have a point!

""..lost my old login"" @tylr.. @rottzy !"
,rottzz,2012-04-16T13:54Z,"tHanks YiFY..


..a'lmost 4got!"
,nosing_glass,2012-04-16T14:11Z,"thanks for uploading.
the audio is ok but a tad more bitrate for the audio woulnt hurt as s-sounds or hissing are not that clear, just noticed. 
just in general 128 kps audio bitrate would be perfect and get rid of this little issue, just a few more mbs needed to do so but with great benefits imho
cheers."
,stonner89,2012-04-16T14:20Z,cooooooooooool
,a_lkaloid,2012-04-16T16:06Z,thanks again cheers to yify-team!
,anisetra,2012-04-16T19:36Z,"hey thank you very much for this, 
you know a good quality adds a '+1' in the movie ratings sometimes...  heh
and a request if you could mention the VIDEO BITRATE in your future uploads,
thank you for this agian :))"

,fofo141,2012-04-17T00:25Z,"Thank you so much YIFY Team 
and special thanks to Sundox"
,lovespiratebay,2012-04-17T01:01Z,FYI to everybody downloading these torrents. This one Bloodsport and Kickboxer all do no work on PS3. I'm not sure if YIFY is doingt his on purpose or what the deal is. I just thought everybody should know.
,jwinston78,2012-04-17T02:32Z,"to encoder Sundox: the video is crisp but.. the audio is again 11Khz why? its fuzzy, why not 24khz stereo (like most other microHD relese group or even 44khz???? 
it's only a few megabytes more... :-( :-(

V:10/10
A:4/10

don't like the YIFY/sundox release anymore, 11 Khz is awful even on crappy speakers.. "
,john_doe123,2012-04-17T03:45Z,"i did only a brief check before and now i have to agree with jwinston78: the picture is good but the sound is kinda hollow. plz increase the sampling rate in the future, more khz is needed for a clear audio. thx anyway."
,vuddha,2012-04-17T04:33Z,"YIFY, you are the KING (or QUEEN). Thanks a million, yours are the only ones I seed."
,eidref,2012-04-17T09:05Z,"hi yify, sorry for my ignorance but can you please tell me how to seed?"
,tofushoyu,2012-04-17T15:26Z,Thank you YIFY Team! +1
,wex1001,2012-04-18T01:27Z,Why such great video with REALLY low quality audio???  Sample Rate 11050 at 32K bps.  How about AAC 5.1 or AC3 5.1 with 720p.
,elishajade7,2012-04-18T08:09Z,"Thank you, YIFY for this upload! I hope that you will upload 'The Big Bang Theory' Season 5 sooner."
,soletar,2012-04-18T12:59Z,"samjnr,bktheman,rottzz, you are all idiots and definitely failed at high school (reading comprehension)

This is a summary of what i wrote- YIFY used to do 500MB rips, he is now doing 1.8G rips, why? i applauded his uploads, in case you did not notice"
,rottzz,2012-04-20T14:40Z,"donno why.. having a hard time tryin to dl. da movie.. its hardly seeded!

is somethin wrong?! other torrents seem fine.. though'"
,rottzz,2012-04-20T14:43Z,"@soletar :
damn u were rit bout one thing.. i did bad at eng at my school ^_^

..try making ur point appear rather simple 'n lucid.. easy to interpret?! ;)

cheers mate!"
,B3lanuj,2012-04-20T23:28Z,"Thanks YIFY! you're the best!

2 things to note: 1.Yify's uploads are small in size,BRrip,very good quality but few seeds. 2.Other uploaders uploads (i.e. extremezone etc.) are DVDrip,big in size and dvd quality (w/c is not sp good) but they mostly had seeds (thousands+ seeders)..so strange..."
,Matak12,2012-04-21T09:04Z,thanks Yify you have small downloads with awesome quality not like fuckin extremezone and his shit quality downloads for 1.5 gb + YIFY ROCKS you should be in top 100
,rottzz,2012-04-23T08:50Z,"honestly.. the audio is a 'bit' appalling..
but the video is of Gr8t quality..

thanks YiFY!"
,rottzz,2012-04-23T08:56Z,thanks 'massanil1' for da subtitles
,naugas,2012-04-24T14:25Z,"Audio is completely unbearable on my TVIX HD M-6500 with Sigma SMP8635 processor. :( Guess it has something to do with SBR encoding, haven't checked it out yet. It's a sharp high pitched noise penetrating into my head... I have to delete this and find another encode."
,strat123,2012-04-25T10:28Z,"Yo, Audio is most important, so I would rather the master add a few hundred megs and have a g8 V and A.
I will give this a miss."

,masterpiece007,2012-04-27T04:50Z,Dissapointed again with the sub sync. Really u should get someone better to do this job! But the movie's good. And the audio/video superb!
,virus.app,2012-04-28T03:33Z,"thanx YIFY. video quality is superb. 
A=9

thanx adlad979 for the link"
,RichiiJm14,2012-04-28T23:59Z,Nice!
,aP1LGR1M,2012-04-29T10:40Z,Video is a 10/10 job.The Audio..is sub par (7/10).
,Ripperx8,2012-05-02T06:55Z,"ChrisD i'm having the same problem.  I transfer the movie onto a stick and put in the ps3 but the file just plays twice as fast on screen.  File isn't corrupted but there's definitely something wrong with it in regards to playing it on a gaming system.  Had this happen with a couple of YIFY rips, but still, nonetheless, you are tops for the movies!"
,Tinny_pb,2012-05-03T12:11Z,"A9 V9. Thanks YIFY.

I played this on a standard def TV with 2.1 speakers through a WDTV Live box. No trouble at all with the audio. It sounded perfect to me; I only gave it A9 instead of A10 on general principle. ;)

This is an excellent quality rip at high resolution for only 800MiB."
,Infenix13,2012-05-20T05:23Z,"Great torrent. My two cents is that everyone should just get VLC media player, its by far the best and easiest. "
,xandao2,2012-05-26T20:30Z,Thanks!!!!!
,gunslinger46,2012-07-24T13:25Z,"Great size torrents btw,,just wondering how i turn off the english captions after I've downloaded it, am i able 2 play ur movies without the captions ??"
,gunslinger46,2012-07-24T13:27Z,ALL HAIL THE CHIEF........YIFY...........!!!!!!!!!!!!
,1997ads,2012-08-01T16:10Z,"@gunslinger46 : I suppose you are talking about subtitles, right?
You can turn them off by pressing 'v'. or simply delete the .srt file."
,wargex,2012-09-05T17:55Z,"Great upload as usual however I ran into unexpected trouble while watching this threw my xbox, which this has yet to happen with a YIFY upload so far till now. But the video stopped 8(to)9/10ths of the way with a ""Unplayable Content"" error with the code 69-C00D002F it has something to do with the audio, just a heads up. Anyway guess I'll just finish the movie on the laptop."
