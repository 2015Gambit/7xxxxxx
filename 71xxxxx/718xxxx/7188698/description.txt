ΓÇ£Last Chance Driving SchoolΓÇ¥ is a half-hour real-life series that follows Sven Ruppaner and his crew as they take on disoriented, despondent and downright dangerous student drivers.

Sven and his team of driving instructors have just a short while to turn their flustered pupils into safe and sensible drivers, with newfound confidence to take on the unpredictable and accident-prone streets of New York.

Every episode follows multiple students as they journey from terrified novice to qualified driver. YouΓÇÖll meet Jillian, a house wife who discovers she has a natural case of road rage. Sharron, a comedienne who wants to ditch public transport for her own set of wheels but she canΓÇÖt seem to keep the car straight. Then thereΓÇÖs Angyl, a model with a mean case of the driving jitters.

All the near misses and accidents taped along the way guarantee a nail-biting driving experience, so buckle-up and prepare for some of the worst drivers ever.
