"Ricky's Tacos" 

An unexpected tip leads Detective 
Britten to an empty warehouse that 
was tied to a case he was 
investigating prior to the accident. 
His curiosity causes concern for 
Captain Harper. Meanwhile, Hannah 
prepares for the move to Oregon. 
Bird and Britten investigate a 
mysterious suicide, while Detective 
Vega and Britten work on a three-
year-old homicide. Later, Dr. Lee 
gives Britten the key to solving one 
of his cases while Dr. Evans helps 
him make a decision about the move.
