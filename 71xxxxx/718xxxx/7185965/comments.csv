,bcabral,2012-04-16T18:39Z,So.. no crack yet?
,ShinSonJazrin,2012-04-19T08:00Z,"Wanna talk about your dead ass dad? Go to psychologist. You wanna talk about torrents? You come here. 

Seeing as this wasn't released by a major group, just some damn bootleggers in China, I can't see this being cracked anytime soon."
,Dulle,2012-04-19T19:25Z,"It's a pity, this game costs full price, I was interested in trying it out but there's no demo of it."
,Djuxy,2012-04-19T21:28Z,"Big fan both on Rts and Rpg games.From what i can tell this could very well be a great game.If not a savior for all ppl dying while w8ing on freaking Diablo and or TorchLight to come out. At least something new, and probably interesting.Sad thing is that crack is taking so long."
,Spirit-Golem,2012-04-20T01:04Z,"Man, I hope the crack comes out soon. I remember the miniatures game before Rackham went under, I loved the gameplay and the setting that they made. Unfortunately Cyanide did not go with some of the more interesting armies, like Mid-nor, Cynwall, or the Ophidians."
,Ninjanyak,2012-04-23T19:54Z,[a][l][l]keygens.[n]et - first really working keygen  p.s. remove all the brackets
,eyereign,2012-04-24T09:31Z,Don't use [a][l][l]keygens.[n]et.  It will ask for you to do a survey first.  These types are usually fakes and a waste of your time.
,eyereign,2012-04-24T09:34Z,Going to [a][l][l]keygens.[n]et is a survey wedsite...don't waste your time!
