Translated from the artist's page on their net label's
official web site:

"Originating from the extinct The Pisces, Eyeblast are a
new sound life of Pedro Le√£o, Ricardo Head's, Miguel Dias,
Pedro Nuno, and Tiago Moreira. With more than a decade of
musical experience, Eyeblast presently show us a more
concise and objective work. Until My Spirit Goes is a
set of songs gathered in an EP recorded at Grave studios,
with Pedro Grave leading production, now seeing day light
in two formats, physical and digital."

Free debut EP from this Portuguese act. Downloaded from
their net label's Bandcamp store (like our previous
release, though its NFO mistakenly says otherwise),
including front cover, ID3 tags and file names cleaned up,
and everything packed comme il faut. No reencoding, of
course.
