Those who remember Mike Farris as the frontman for '90s hard rockers the Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies will do a double take when they hear this unexpectedly moving comeback. The singer has radically overhauled his image, shifting from gin-soaked frontman to gospel shouter on this roof-raising release. What hasn't changed is Farris's powerful voice, even more potent since he cleaned up from various excesses in 2004. While the appropriately titled Salvation in Lights is a drastic musical departure from his previous band's swaggering, boozy approach, it's also a logical use of his soulful vocals and candid personality. The singer delivers the goods on a handful of rearranged traditionals such as "Oh Mary Don't You Weep," but when he rips into Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come," the song shimmers with a passion that nearly matches the original, and that's saying a lot. The oozing, swampy "Devil Don't Sleep," the restrained funker "Can't No Grave Hold My Body Down," and the Memphis-thumping "Selah! Selah!" add to the rousing, rootsy R&B groove. Farris is unexpectedly convincing throughout and obviously inspired as he keeps the faith on this stirring but not preachy album. He's accompanied by horns and a tough yet restrained band with righteous female backing vocals that perfectly position these tunes between heaven and earth. He testifies on his Staples Singers cover that he wants to "take you there," and by the time the album closes with "I'm Gonna Get There," you'll gladly follow wherever he leads. --Hal Horowitz
