,frostbite88,2012-04-15T03:04Z,Thanks so much!
,FittSparc,2012-04-15T03:57Z,"Epic ! Thanks Footy. 

NOTE: The BBC covers only 10 races this year:

15 April: China
13 May: Spain
27 May: Monaco
24 June: Europe
8 July: Britain
2 September: Belgium
23 September: Singapore
14 October: Korea
4 November: Abu Dhabi

Skysports isn't that bad actually - We still have Crofty and Brundle !"
,nobodynever,2012-04-15T05:25Z,"Is this the BBC?  

Sky is fine, but BBC is better.  

But I hate Brundle.  He was always getting in peoples' way on the grid walk for the last few years. "
,nobodynever,2012-04-15T05:26Z,"IT IS!!! It is the bbc, yea!"
,DOHC-6,2012-04-15T06:23Z,"Haven't dl'ed this yet...is this the file uploaded by someone known as *hannibal*?
He has a bad habit of splitting the pre-race from the main race, and he also messes up the audio in some way so the two files can't be joined back together as well as hardcoding his annoying anagram into the video. "
,FiveeNil,2012-04-15T15:26Z,"Remember guys, it's a mkv file. You'll need to convert it first!


But it's a amazing file. Thank you footy."
,FiveeNil,2012-04-15T22:27Z,"Thanks footy, quality stuff. I prefer BBC F1's coverage simply because it's better, even without Martin Brundle. He is still class but he carries them all on Sky F1.

Nevertheless, amazing upload! Thank you again footy."
