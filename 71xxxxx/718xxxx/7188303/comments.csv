,xanaxvisa,2012-04-15T22:29Z,Full filname is: Mission.Impossible-Ghost.Protocol.2011.BluRay.1080p.AVC.TrueHD7.1-CHDBits
,zx6rider,2012-04-15T23:06Z,"Why would anyone upload a 38 gig. movie file?
 If you really want to upload something people can use try to transcode the files into .MKV or anything smaller...38 gigs is just ridiculous. "
,brbear,2012-04-16T04:14Z,"@zx6rider - Because some of us might burn it to a BD disc and use it in a blu-ray player, properly.

So, Thanks for the UL"
,pjones452,2012-04-16T08:17Z,"thanks for this one I don't know why anyone complains about large file sizes, some of us want them!"
,breaking.atoms,2012-04-16T12:09Z,"Thanks!

Can I make a request? Would it be possible for you to upload Fight Club, the complete, untouched BR?"
,xanaxvisa,2012-04-16T12:41Z,"@zx6rider I guess you won't be downloading the 104GB Game of Thrones torrent I uploaded?

@breaking.atoms I can do that

@All Your Welcome
"
,breaking.atoms,2012-04-16T12:59Z,@xanaxvisa: I'll be forever grateful. Thanks again :)
,brbear,2012-04-16T22:51Z,"While I greatly appreciate this torrent, just an FYI, this BD is *NOT* exactly ""untouched""

Missing (stripped from the image) are the following (All from the Extras sections...)

Missing from ""Mission Accepted"" Extra: 
the ""Suiting Up In Prague"" segment (about 20 mins).  ""Heating Up in Dubai"" and ""Vancouver Fisticuffs"" are still on the disc -- About 19 minutes of the original 48 minutes are missing.

Missing from ""Impossible Missions"" Extra:
""The Russian Prison"", ""Shooting in IMAX"", ""Art Department"", ""A Roll of Film"", ""Life Masks"", ""Stepping Into The Storm"", ""Dubai Car Crash"", ""Lens on the Burj"", and ""Composer"". -- (""The Sandstorm"" and ""Props"" are still on the disc under this heading) Missing about 45mins of the original 51 minutes.

Also, five (out of eight) deleted scenes are missing as are the Trailers.

Still, this disc IS in great audio and video presentation, but it's not exactly ""untouched""

Video: 10
Audio: 10
BD replica: 6


(Note: those are the ORIGINAL features, that are missing, I am not referring to the ones on the Best Buy exclusive bonus disc)"
[T],omao86,2012-04-25T18:10Z,"@brbear Wrong!!!, this is the retail non BB version, the bonus materials that you commented are exclusive for BestBuy and are available on a second BD-25 disk."
,RegPulp,2012-04-27T23:49Z,"also because some of us may want todo the encoding ourselves, too many releases without ""MediaInfo"" posted.

i like to know that good x264 settings were used, High quality settings all the way.
"
,RegPulp,2012-05-01T02:30Z,i don't think this was decrypted 100% correctly!
,xanaxvisa,2012-05-01T18:53Z,@RegPulp Explain please
,literone,2012-05-12T05:00Z,Why Wont VLC play the blu ray file :P i waited so long for this movie and now it wont play :S
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-05-12T13:47Z,@literone: I had problems with VLC aswell. Media Player Classic works. You should already have it installed on your PC if you've installed the klite codec pack.
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-05-12T13:48Z,@literone: Or download PowerDVD!
,literone,2012-05-13T13:54Z,@tyl3rdurd3n aahaa ill download PowerDVD right now thanks ;)
,literone,2012-05-14T12:07Z,"I tried using PowerDVD and it worked! But the movie was in french no audio in english only english audio for blind people, french italian and spanish"
,snoopus6,2012-05-18T04:31Z,"Hi xanaxvisa i'm downloading the big game of thrones right now it's a bit slow at times but. Will leave a comment when i get it all & checked it out, only 10.5 gig to go :) Also what do you use to convert bluray to mkv as i would like to do some of my own thanks in advance. "
,xanaxvisa,2012-05-19T11:18Z,"@snoopus6 

Sorry if its slow. I have uploaded a huge amount of data on all torrents I uploaded. Sadly most people ""hit and run""

None of these torrents are my own but you could try MakeMkv to do the task you want. The Game thrones torrent is superb, Enjoy!"
