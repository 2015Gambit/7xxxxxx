,mrrickyhorror,2012-04-14T03:39Z,Thank you Stumpie!
,cloud.castle,2012-04-14T17:03Z,tracks 6 - 9 are playing funny. voices are either faster or lower than Jason Mraz's normal voice.  zz
,cloud.castle,2012-04-14T17:18Z,correction. tracks 4-9 have either higher and faster or lower and slower versions of Jason Mraz's voice.
,PW5,2012-04-14T21:58Z,"Yes, there is definitely something wrong with tracks 4-9. Others seem to be OK."
,Ruby_pirate,2012-04-18T02:20Z,Great quality! :D Thank you very much stumpie1971!
,Ruby_pirate,2012-04-18T16:44Z,"Now that I listened to all of the tracks I need to correct my previous comment.
