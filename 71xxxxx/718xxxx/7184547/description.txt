THE DARKNESS II

The Darkness II takes place two years after the events of the first game. Jackie Estacado, the current wielder of The Darkness, has used his powers to become the Don of the Franchetti crime family. He has been unable to shake the thoughts of his dead girlfriend Jenny Romano and has since, with the help of estranged occultist Johnny Powell and his study into dark essence, contained his supernatural powers, and now The Darkness "wants out in the worst way".
