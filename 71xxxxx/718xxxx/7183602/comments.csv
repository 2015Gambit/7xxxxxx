,Anaslex,2012-05-04T19:53Z,I updated it and it stops responding when I try to run it. I'm using Windows 7 64 bit. I tried running it as admin and my steam is not running.
,TheChodefather,2012-05-05T21:28Z,"Hey, I'm trying to run this on Windows Vista Home Premium, 32 bit of course.

When I change the settings for SteamClient to false, I am able to run counter strike, but I can't use the internet, and it says I need to be running Steam Beta.

However, when I change it back to true, hl2.exe crashes no matter what I change.

Help, plz?"
