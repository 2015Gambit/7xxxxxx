Good video butt kinda bad sound..."
,taboam,2012-04-14T07:05Z,"Thanks for uploading this, I paid for it but it was downloading at 45kb/s so it would take 11 hours. This torrent took 20 min to download."
,iswd1,2012-04-22T21:04Z,"Ok. This is the first time I've EVER left a comment in all these years on TPB... 

This torrent should NOT be here. Anyone who downloads this, for whatever reason, is just low. Jim has made this video available on his site, ONLY, and only for $5.00 -- jimgaffigan.com

This was his way of saying hey, if you like my comedy, pay for it, directly to me, not to some corporation. Instead of some 19.99 dvd (or more?), he is giving this to us for $5.00! 

Please, this is a new way for these guys to give us content without killing our wallets. It's a test of loyalty. 

If people download this torrent, what will that say to Jim, and other comedians, musicians and others who are trying to break away from the corporate scene?  They won't bother. 

Please, don't download this torrent, don't seed it, and don't support piracy against individuals like Jim who are doing us all a great service by getting away from the corporations and working directly with US, instead.  "
,iswd1,2012-04-22T21:05Z,"And yes, I saw the link to his site in the details, but come on... shouldn't even BE an option to download this on torrents. He's making a statement and we're telling him he's wrong. I paid, go do the same!! It's worth it!"
,Mr_Gentoo,2012-04-25T19:07Z,I don't have a problem downloading this. I'd like to get all activist about everything and say I DONT DOWNLOAD BECAUSE OF CORPORATIONS.. That is my reason for not paying for most things.. however not everyone is so idealistic. So stop waving your message around. If someone wants to upload something they can. If they don't believe in the same cause as you that is fine. You do your part. Some people download because they don't give a fuck. Deal with that fact and stop shitting up comments.
,benjy1234,2012-05-01T20:05Z,Im in the same boat as Taboam. I bought it on the site but it was downloading really slow so I just came here. 
,namshub,2012-05-15T02:11Z,"When I have money, I do buy stuff - even after I've previously downloaded it. I like to support the people whose work I enjoy.

But I'm broke now, so I'm downloading."
,Billythebat,2012-05-15T10:00Z,"Stealing from Jim gaffigan..thats just wrong....it is so much more wrong than normal stealing off the pirate bay.
$5 it can hardly by a mcdonalds meal...and he is giving you more than 60mins entertainment. 

BTW..i DL this from jims site and it was really quick and i am in Australia.   So... really disappointed to see this up here, and people using it as a excuse to DL. "
,anonyboy,2012-05-16T08:40Z,I should buy it instead? Do I get a refund if I don't like it? No? Well then fuck off.
,jye-jye,2012-06-25T08:35Z,"I see in the description a very reasonable offer (on his site it says it's DRM-free as well), I'm going to accept it, and buy some Louis C.K. if it turns out I like him too.

Thanks for the heads up.  I usually look in torrent descriptions for good deals because if I really do like something I'll go out and get it, and this is about the sweetest deal you can get.  $5, $1 goes to charity, DRM free high quality download.  I wish everyone was that nice and I want to support this model.

I came here because I can't find stand-up in the store half the time, stores don't really have a stand-up section (good luck finding older sets), and if you do come across them, they're way overpriced (I've seen some stand-up for $40).

I don't order stuff on Amazon or other services, I run Linux and I'm sure whatever DRM they have on those services doesn't work.  I don't have a credit card, don't want one, and they don't sell Amazon cards where I'm at.  Those gift CC's are nice but with the $5 activation, I'm not going to run out and get those unless it's something I really want.  But I do have paypal.

There's this CD I downloaded and listened to it about 10 times.  The next chance I had the money I went out and bought the deluxe copy for me and one for my friend who had a birthday coming up.

I see everyone's fighting and they all have their own reasons.  Fact is not everyone's made of money, not everyone has the means.  But just do what you can when you can, especially when you know the people who are being genuine and care to cut out the bullshit so 90% of your money isn't going to lawyers and marketing."
,TurnRiva,2012-06-29T00:55Z,"Lol at you guys sitting on piratebay stealing, and having the nerve to say ""you guys shouldnt steal this""

Get the fuck out."
,Flyinby,2012-06-29T23:41Z,"I think it's good to let us know about the $5 cost and give the link; choice is good.  I don't think you're going to accomplish much by lecturing about it though.  It's a good show, and I bought it after already seeing it on Netflix.  No way would I have paid DVD prices so all the execs and lawyers could profit, but I'd like to see more artists doing this, whether free or for low cost like this one.  If you like the idea and the show, support it if you can; if you can't, or don't want to, that's up to you.   Either way, there will hopefully be enough positive response that others handle their work in this way.  Incidentally, the downlaod speed for the HD version is now fast, so the slow downloads no longer should be a problem."

I made an account just to tell you... that you made my year worthwhile."

High five!

@TurnRiva

High Five again!

@Flyinby

A philosophy to live by.

@Baphometmsk

Thank you for giving us this option.

P.s. I just bought it."
,TheBlitz1,2012-08-09T09:08Z,"iswd1

Dude, shut your ugly mouth. there's only 200 people active max on this torrent across multiple clients as of 8/9/12. That's 200 x 5 for 1,000 dollars.

Assuming another 600 for people who download and leave that's 600 + 200 x 5 = 4,000.00 USD

If you told Jim Gaffigan he was going to lose 5 or 6 thousand to pirates he would just laugh.

Give it a rest. There will always be poor people, so there will always be pirates."
,sissor,2012-08-14T09:52Z,"@TheBlitz1 - To be honest he's not even losing as much as that even. I'm downloading it (obviously) and if it wasn't available here or else where for free it is not like I was going to pay the $5 dollars. 

I just would have said fuck it and watched something else. When Hollywood cries and says they are losing ""X"" amount of dollars, they never factor in how many people would have just decided to not buy the product.

Anyways, enough of my bitching. If I see that he will be doing some stand up near me, I'll go see him live, because live shows are never the same as the recorded stuff and I think that is worth paying for.

[H],politux,2012-08-28T11:08Z,"Downloading != stealing.  

Move along now."
,DctrEvil,2012-08-29T08:06Z,"To all the people trying to appeal to software and media pirates' sense of morality and shame them; fuck off, I'm here to get shit for free. Doesn't matter if it is on his website for $.01, I didn't come to TPB if I wanted to give him a dime.

Dance and make me laugh, Jim
And do it for free"
,VelcroDays,2012-09-02T02:37Z,"I love Jim Gaffigan, and I think it'd be awesome to be ABLE to buy this. 
Some times, in this very, very poor economy, you just honestly don't have 5$ to fork up. When I'd first heard that this was for only 5$ I thought it was so awesome of him and I WISHED I could buy it. I still do wish I could. I live off of a 2$ meal a day and I thankfully get my internet for free. 
Sometimes when your life is so horrible, you need a little bit of comedy. Awesome, godly comedy such as this guy.
Thank you, uploader. And thank you, Gaffigan."
,bigporch,2012-09-04T16:23Z,"I heard he had a new special and immediately came here to get it, but now that I know he did the Louis C.K. model, I'm buying it from his site. It's going very fast for me from his site so people saying it was taking a long time, I don't think that's an issue anymore.

I pirate shit all the time, and I've come up with ways to justify it in my head, the corporations, the RIAA, the MPAA, outdated business models by greedy old fucks trying to limit people's expression and so forth.

This is how artists should release their shit, and I just can't bring myself to torrent it. People are free to do as they wish, but your getting a year of one man's work condensed into an hour+ show for 5$, 1$ of which goes to charity, the rest goes to support the artist directly. I can't argue with that.

This is the future of how entartainment should be sold, with no old out of touch middlemen controlling what we can and can't see or hear, and charging an arm and a leg for their shitty services, all while limiting the artists true creativity and potential.

Not trying to lecture anyone. But go buy it from his site, guys."
,orelion,2012-09-21T07:36Z,"I was about to download this when I saw your link and decided to buy if for 5$ instead. Please, if you can, support your favorite comedians so they'll keep making specials for us without the middlemen."
