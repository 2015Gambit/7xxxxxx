Is it same update like Update 4 from ALI213?"
,sulfurum1989,2012-04-15T19:34Z,"The update is clean ???        lately some torrents of games and updates have ,, virus in their installers  and archives,,

,dandalis,2012-04-18T00:27Z,"yeah...do i need to install updates 1, 2 and 3 ? i play SP only."
,jamir420,2012-04-24T13:18Z,"I installed he game but when I try to play the game it says "" the program can't start because D3DCOMPLIER_43.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix the problem""

I do not have Update 1, 2, and 3.

PLEASE HELP!!!!!!"
,Vegasbob,2012-05-28T06:33Z,Thanks for this. Dident need the shitty techno muzak durring the install though. Most scene's at least have the decency to provide a mute checkbox
,Vegasbob,2012-05-28T06:57Z,"FYI This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!! The Reloaded version installs the game to a directory called ""BattleField 3TM"" "
,xpmule,2012-07-11T17:57Z,"yeah and it also installs the game (by default)
to a folder called games on your ""D"" drive.
But that is the only thing you see when you click setup.exe or it autoruns the dvd etc..
Also when you click the OK button you are reminded where you are installing.
So if most people payed attention to what they were doing they wouldn't have problems.. Also in case it's not obvious ? when you install the reloaded version remove the trademark symbol from the install path.. it causes problems !

And yeah i agree the chiptunes that you can't kill is gay !
I made a patched version of the GTA IV and EFLC Razor1911 cracks to remove the start up chiptunes and the splash screen.. As far as I am aware i was the first and only person to do this.

Anyway since no one wants to be helpful I'll do it..

Update patches needed ???
Well what i did was install to
C, EA Games, Battlefield 3
then i ran the same patch in this torrent
and i made sure to select the EXACT same path i selected above..
that's it.
No other versions of patches needed
and no copying of cracks or anything
This torrent automatically copies the crack.exe for you.."

,Alluziion,2012-08-24T13:50Z,"Works Great!

To answer some questions...

You don't need previous updates to install this one! Simply run the setup and select your Battlefield 3 installation directory as the installation path (make a backup of the original directory if you're worried that you'll corrupt your files).

I'm not sure what this update includes altogether but I know that it adds support for Stereoscopic 3D."
,Alluziion,2012-08-24T14:03Z,"Works Great! :D

No need for previous updates.
Simply run the setup and install the directory where Battlefield 3 is installed.

Not sure what fixes are included but it does include support for Stereoscopic 3D."
,Eizzo,2012-08-26T15:56Z,Doesn't work. Starting the game and nothing happens.
