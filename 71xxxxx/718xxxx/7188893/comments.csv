,coergo,2012-04-16T15:33Z,"Untrue untrue! This *IS* 5.1 surround. 3f2r+LFE. The only part of it that is stereo is the ""last time on game of thrones..."""
,cayrikan,2012-04-16T15:46Z,"YOU GUYS LISTEN UP


THIS IS 5.1, ITS ONLY 2.1 IN THE INTRO BECAUSE THATS HOW HBO LIKES IT!    "
,ofb,2012-04-16T17:04Z,"I agree with michaelsammler , IMMERSE, I really appreciate you uploading this series, but I don't know what you are doing differently from last season. They were excellent, but your first episodes from season two are more grainy for some rason, just thought I'd give you a heads up."
,thebeav111,2012-04-16T19:13Z,"it's ripped from Canadian cable, and Canadian cable companies are HORRIBLE, and have monopolies, so they don't care about their quality.

THANK YOU IMMERSE/EZTV!"
,Valtieri,2012-04-16T19:34Z,Thank you for sharing guys... and again IMMERSE keep going with this awesome encode mate.
,growlface,2012-04-16T21:16Z,"Thanks for the great quality up, man. I can't say the same for the episode though. Rewriting a whole storyline to make a king a fag! Jesus, is nothing sacred these days. "
,vicawesome,2012-04-16T23:27Z,thanks mate
,sanirif,2012-04-17T00:35Z,please continue to seed... show's still just out... show some support.
,Anonymous1982,2012-04-17T01:37Z,Thanks in Rio de Janeiro / Brazil!!
,Kalohux,2012-04-17T04:10Z,"NOW THE CULTURAL MARXISTS HOMOSEXUAL HELL HAS SPREAD TO THIS SERIE ALSO! 
I AM SO SICK OF GETTING YOUR TWISTED PERVERTED SEXUAL PREFERENCES SHOVED DOWN MY THROAT!

GO FUCKING KILL YOURSELVES!!!"
,superdavee,2012-04-17T07:00Z,"awsome quality...looks great on the big screen, sound is top rate...great upload, thank you much"
,aa11234,2012-04-17T11:46Z,"Kalohux: First, there were homosexual scenes in Season 1 also
Second, this series is the quite accurate television adaptation of George R. R. Martins book cycle, A song of ice and fire, so go and protest his books"
,alvishork,2012-04-18T05:40Z,"Thanks! By the way, Renly is gay in the books, too. They just make it implicit rather than explicit. "
,3xNinjaMan,2012-04-19T11:04Z,"Agreed, if you hadn't caught on that Renly is gay when you read the books then you're living in denial! Luckily mr Martin is co-producing the show so he can help you get over yourself by making it more obvious on the screen... ^^"
,yamato74,2012-04-20T18:01Z,This Kalohux guy must be the biggest idiot on earth.
,yamato74,2012-04-20T20:57Z,"""this series is the quite accurate""

I don't think is so accurate. This series tend to exaggerate things that are more veiled in the books, especially the sex scenes. But I'm not complaining, the are just making clear things which are more subtle in the books. I like the books better, but until now is not bad for a TV show."
,DarkWolfDK,2012-04-20T21:48Z,"Thx for UL.
What type of x264 codec did you use?
Seems the last file you did worked fine. But this has no picture? What changed?"
,CaptRegie,2012-04-20T23:32Z,Thanks for the upload...And thanks to the users who spoiled the episode. Even tho its obvious you shouldn't ruin the content of the episode. You're more of a fag then Renly 
,tops.c,2012-04-21T17:55Z,"I can't understand this whole series ?, when is Breakin Bad coming back ?

Ok this is a war over a kingdom that's kinda in between a sole ruler ? right ?, I want to see the mig. make it with the girl, I wonder if they get laid much :-)"
,meowkak,2012-04-23T07:01Z,Is anyone else having a problem getting this? I usually hit dl speeds of 900+kB/s right now I'm downloading at 3-6kB/s.
