Go there for forced English subs that weren't written by an illiterate monkey on heroine."

Yes, great video and audio, but getting the subs to work with my player were a bitch...then I found out that they are so  badly translated that even the English parts are translated wrong--INTO ENGLISH!  Thanks, VixenofVenus for suggesting better subs, even if its too late for me.  GREAT MOVIE, GREAT (TRUE) AND ONGOING STORY."
