After all the bullsh*t and "seed begging" comments on my last upload I feel it necessary to issue a disclaimer...

I am not online and seeding 24 hours a day, so learn some damn patience. Don't forget that you're getting this for free. If you want it immediately then do what I did - pay for it on iTunes.
