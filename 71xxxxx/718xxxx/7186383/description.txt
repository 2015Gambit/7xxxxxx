This is the first part of my pindaric critical collection. Some of these books were downloaded from Google Books, others were pdf'ed at european libraries, other I don't even remember where they come from. But I hope all of them to prove useful to someone else out there, specially because they're gathered all in the same place.

Remember to always share and seed.

Shanti, shanti, shanti.
