Deleted Scenes (HD):

Twelve brief deleted and alternate scenes are available -- "I Did It," "Dancing Ninja," "I Haven't Yet," "I Don't Need to Be Reminded," "Crew Search," "Broken Seal," "Right About There," "Oil Cans," "Sebastian Leaves," "Searching," "I have Never Run Drugs" and "Looking for Me, Captain?" -- few of which would have improved the final film.

Under the Radar: The Making of Contraband (HD, 17 minutes):

"Action. Action. ACTION!" So begins Contraband's behind-the-scenes featurette, which hones in on Korm√°kur's remake ("I don't really see it as a remake," says the director), the characters and story ("it's really steeped in reality," assures Ribisi), the action ("I went through a little bit of a tumble," chuckles Caleb Landry Jones), and its shoot ("welcome to Contraband, Kate!" quips second stunt coordinator Darrin Prescott after wrapping Beckinsale in plastic sheeting and covering her in wet concrete).

Reality Factor:

The Stunts and Action of Contraband (HD, 8 minutes): Action, action and more action. So drills home the second of Contraband's production featurettes, which shoves the film's stuntwork and action choreography to center stage.
