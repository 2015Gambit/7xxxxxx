,ilang17,2012-04-15T19:31Z,"2 questions. 
first.  any idea on the source? was it the blu-ray 3d or is this just a convert.

second, do you have access to a true hd rip? something closer to 6 -9 gb  ?"
,been12,2012-04-15T22:07Z,not a convert true 3D TRY IT YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITH THE QUALITY  
,ofpirate,2012-04-16T18:19Z,SBS?
,ofpirate,2012-04-17T04:32Z,"following up - it is SBS, focus is fairly soft.. lotta res info compressed out - not saying it is conversion, but it looks like a conversion would look - happy to have it though, at least until a proper release comes down the pipe.."
,been12,2012-04-17T12:26Z,dude what are you talking about?? this was made by sick-flix 1 of the best 3d piraters there is as of now. they charge a donation to get this 3d movie and others i do not. as far as i know this was straight from bluray 3d disc the quality is 100% man
