Pim lives in a run-down house in a dead-end street somewhere at the Belgian coast, together with his mother Yvette Bulteel (better known as Yvette Mimosa, local accordion starlet). Life here smells of cold French fries, cheap cigarettes, vermouth and stale beer. Mother Yvette uses her fat Etienne with his lousy grey Fiat as a driver for the nights she has to ΓÇ£performΓÇ¥.

As a kid Pim dreams of a better life, imagining princesses and beauty queens. But when Pim turns 16 he dreams of Gino, the boy next door, instead. Ever since they were children there has been this tension between them. Now Gino is PimΓÇÖs motorcycling hero. Cold mockery, little humiliations and tiny bits of hope make up PimΓÇÖs life. No wonder he sometimes flees to his dream world.

Then one day Yvette leaves with young, hunky Zoltan, the boy from the fair. When Yvette leaves her son alone in the empty house, Pim seizes the opportunity and his dreams become half-truths. Pim moves to the neighboursΓÇÖ house to live with Marcella, his ΓÇ£second mumΓÇ¥. And with Sabrina, GinoΓÇÖs sister, who circles longingly around Pim. He even sleeps in GinoΓÇÖs bed! But GinoΓÇÖs off romancing and living with a girl from across the border. Dreams never come true. Or do they? On a rainy day Gino returns.
