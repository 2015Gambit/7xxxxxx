Recorded with Fraps, sorry if there's any flaw on it, I left my PC recording it, cut'd the stage setup and uploaded it right away, I'll add the setlist while I see it.

Gotta say I'm impressed with video and audio quality tho, looks like the audio was reecorded directly from the mic's on the stage and the video is pretty awesome for a live stream.

Setlist:
1. Brianstorm
2. This House Is A Circus
3. Still Take You Home
4. Don't Sit Down 'Cause I Moved Your Chair (gotta love long song names).
5. The View From The Afternoon
6. I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor
7. Pretty Visitors
8. Evil Twin
9. Brick By Brick
10. Teddy Picker
11. Crying Lightning
12. Fluorescent Adolescent
13. R U Mine?

Hope you enjoy.
