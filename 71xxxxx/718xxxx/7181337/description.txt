Information
------------------------------

The team head to the Luangwa Valley in Zambia, home to the largest population of hippos in the world. So many hippos congregate to feed here that they threaten the survival of other species in the park, so the authorities cull around 200 of them every year to keep their numbers in check. The cull offers veterinary scientist Mark Evans and comparative anatomist Joy Reidenberg the opportunity to dissect one of these magnificent animals. They are often mistakenly seen as Africa's laziest giant, lolling around all day in the mud. But as the team discover, at night they're surprisingly active. The first obstacle in the dissection is the hippo's inch-thick skin. This acts as a protective shield against the foot-long canines of rival hippos.
