Spyware Doctor is designed to detect all types of known spyware and malware including suspicious ActiveX objects, keyloggers and phishing scams. Since antispyware removal is a much more difficult task than simply detecting it, it comes as no surprise that this softwareΓÇÖs detection capabilities supersede its removal performance. The antispyware software also frequently updates to ensure it can continue to protect your PC against emerging threats as well.

YouΓÇÖll find little beyond this antispyware toolΓÇÖs malware protection. While top-tier antispyware software works hard to protect all points of entry on your PC, Spyware Doctor primarily focuses on potential browser exploits. To keep your PC even safer, weΓÇÖd like to see the software also scan email attachments and removable media such as USB drives for potential threats. Doing so may help boost the softwareΓÇÖs overall performance.

Also missing from Spyware DoctorΓÇÖs functionality is the ability to run reports. While not necessary for effective malware protection, reporting options would likely widen the softwareΓÇÖs appeal to include advanced users who prefer manual, hands-on PC protection and are interested to know more about the nature of found threats.

If you run into trouble either installing or running the software, Spyware Doctor is supplemented with decent help and support. Its manufacturer, PC Tools, provides online documentation and a knowledgebase that you can peruse. You can also contact the company via live chat or email, but no phone support is available.
