,kuttingxedge,2012-04-20T08:57Z,"Wanted to thank you for a kick ass torrent. Awesome quality. BTW, what is a grateful amount of time to seed? Not really clear on the etiquette. Thanks again. "
[V],HiGH-RG,2012-04-20T09:36Z,Glad you enjoy our work kuttingxedge. At the bar minimum try to seed back to a 1.0 ratio or greater cause then you've shared back what you've taken.

,MarchMellow,2012-06-19T10:58Z,are subtitles hardcoded or can they be removed?
[V],HiGH-RG,2012-06-28T21:09Z,"Subtitles are softcoded, and can be disabled inside your video player. I recommend using VLC."
