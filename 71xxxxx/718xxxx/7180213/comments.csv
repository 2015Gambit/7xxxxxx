show how dumb the govs and police are to
even have done this illegal seizure and case

every thing he said made total sense

again he points out the nonsense stats
of the cost of piracy 

and why people pirate cos the shows
are available any other way
or delayed for years to other countries"

[V],psspss,2012-04-18T05:43Z,"this is a great series that exposes gov corruption
and stupidity in the world and aussie

hurt the govs too much and the rich they mocked :)
