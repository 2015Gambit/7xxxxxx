No, it is a fix for anyone who is experience low fps performance ingame and especially during a big battle."
,imasinner,2012-04-13T20:39Z,"Virus, do not download."
,Braga987,2012-04-13T22:51Z,"This is not a virus, your antivirus detecting it as a false positive "
,Endraw,2012-04-15T12:44Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Team Reloaded did not release a crackfix for this game, Skidrow did."
,Braga987,2012-04-15T19:12Z,"Since you say its a virus, let me prove you wrong...if you google ""Men of War Condemned Heroes Proper Crack RELOADED"" and click on the third link you see, you will see this same crackfix is on skidrowgames website"
