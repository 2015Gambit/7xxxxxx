Lol wtf? 
This is one of the best rips you can get when it comes to MLP.

Colors are too saturated? 
HA!! HAHAHA...!
The colors are perfect. And compare a bad tv rip to this?! Get some new eyes kid."

That was one concern I've had in the back of my mind for the better part of a year -- I've never, EVER adjusted my laptop's colours from factory default.

Prompted by your comment, I finally looked into colour calibration, via http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/all_noprofile.php.  Viewed straight-on, each band is distinguishable; the darks blend together when the monitor is angled back, and the lights blend when angled forward.

In other words, the colours are just fine as is.  Consider calibrating your own monitor (if yours is an LCD) with the link above."
,DeShizz,2012-04-20T21:21Z,"Hey Dude, Thanks soooooooo much for the uploads.

If these are from iTunes, why did you re-encode the video stream?

Would you ever consider doing an un-encoded, straight WEBDL torrent with these files? maybe after the season ends tomorrow? Pretty please? Id seed it myself!"
,kipenz,2012-04-20T22:17Z,"In defense of Gotcha34, I personally find the color corrected recodes less-desirable also. The colors are artificially adjusted from the official material, and since we're not dealing with desaturated TV-rips anymore but rather direct digital itunes rips, it's a little redundant and more of a color-enhancement than color-correction anymore.

No one seems to consistently release any raw iTunes rips though, so these color-corrected recodes are really the only high-quality and well done 720p encodes on the market. Inline with what DeShizz suggested though, a raw webrip non-CC pack would really awesome after the season wraps up."
,PHR16384,2012-04-21T19:00Z,"@DeShizz & kipenz:

As you may or may not know, the original iTunes videos had lousy colours -- everything looked ""washed out"".  The late PonyArchive and its affiliates were responsible for the original colour corrections, trying to match up with ""true"" colour refs -- for instance, the vectors of Lauren Faust's original sketches, teaser screenshots posted on the MLP Facebook page, or the promotional Flash games (e.g. ""Discover the Differences"", ""Castle Creator"") found on The Hub website.

Soon after Season 2 started, ""updated"" versions of the iTunes file appeared, with MUCH better colours.  Again, comparing to the above sources, the new versions have better white/black contrast, but are slightly under-saturated.  (Rarity's mane, for example, seems a few shades too light of her usual deep, rich purple.)  Ergo, the colour corrections continue.

(Comparing side-by-side ZR's corrections with the ""spoiler"" screens posted on Facebook, ZR's colours have more saturation.  Personally, though, I support ZR's corrections -- they feel closer to the spirit of ""stylized candy cartoon world"" than any other set of colours I've seen, including the old corrections done by PonyArchive.  IMHO, the colours are SUPPOSED to be super-saturated.)

If you still prefer the unmodified iTunes rips, by all means download them instead.  Torrents of the raw, unaltered* iTunes files are available at YayPonies.  Choose a site mirror, then click ""Torrents"" and select ""I Want 720P Raw ponies"".

(*Video/colours are unchanged, but the file is remuxed to MKV.  ALL their files are pretty much MKVs.)"

Also, for anyone who's curious as to the exact differences, I went ahead and took screencaps from some of the various versions to keep my own curiosity from eating away at me:

Throw each in a separate tab and click back and forth.

Friendship Express and iTunes seem close enough to be explained off as artifacts from the NTSC and iTunes conversion processes, so to me those seem to be the 'official' colors with everything else being variations stemming from either loss or enhancement. Ultimately though I guess it's much like an EQ filter for sound therein it comes down to personal preference. I've personally always just been big on getting as close to official as possible, so the raws are probably my route."
,kipenz,2012-04-22T07:23Z,Just too bad they're nearly 300MB larger :[
,DeShizz,2012-04-22T17:59Z,"@PHR16384

Thanks dude. I had no idea another archive existed."
,Yeddes,2012-04-22T19:10Z,So!.. When do you think the finale will be up?
,PHR16384,2012-04-23T03:04Z,"@Yeddes:

Not a clue.  Some of ZR's files were posted within one or two days; others, within one or two WEEKS.

The uncorrected iTunes files are already available, however, and YP usually emails me when the colour corrected versions get put up.  When they do, I'll let you all know right here."
,PHR16384,2012-04-25T06:42Z,ZR's stuff is up!  Last 2 episodes' torrents will be posted in a few hours.
