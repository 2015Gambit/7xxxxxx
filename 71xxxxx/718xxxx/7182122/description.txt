**MKV files are compatible with media players such as Media Player Classic, VLC, ALLPlayer, foobar2000 and PowerDVD.  For other compatibility, try installing The Combined Community Codec Pack, or consult the website of your preferred media player.

FYI:  "Why MKV files and not MP4, or AVI, or M2TS?"

- MP4s can only normally store AAC audio and other MPEG-style audio streams.
- AVI is an extremely limited and outdated container format (look up on Wiki what ridiculous things AVI can't do without forcing it to).  It's bad and you should feel bad.
- M2TS adds over 30 MB of data to the file compared to MP4 or MKV.  Smaller size is everything.
- MKVs can contain any and as many video, audio and subtitle streams as you want.  Matroska also happens to be an open format.


Don't like MKVs?  Losslessly convert to another container, such as M2TS (which should be compatible with Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and certain Bluray players), with these tools:

PLEASE SEED LIKE CRAZY (That is, um, if you don't mind...)  Expect moar torrents from yours truly of single episodes, and another for the full season 2 as the episodes come out.


Enjoy your ponies, and don't forget to support the show and its community!  :D
