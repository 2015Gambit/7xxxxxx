Every program upload i make,is program i have been working with or 

still working with these programs.The point is that i dont make uploads on programs

that i dont know anything about. (I just dont download and share right away).

That isnt fair aginst you who download from me.When you download something from me

you should know that i've tested these files before upload,and within this 

uploaded folder there is a screenshot pic named --



(Scanned with) AVG I.S  2012 B-Ness.Ed.Final-x86-x64.) 



of the scan result / with year - month - date - time and how many files is scanned

in this spesifik folder.

**


To write that you have made a scan test of a file and then upload is not

enough for me,I have choozen to make a screenshot for you downloaders,

So you can see for your self , every information you need to know.

That the downloaded file is really clean.


I started This way of thinking recently. So not every file i uploaded has this new

way of system,but every upload from now on will have.

Good luck to you all.


Enjoy.
