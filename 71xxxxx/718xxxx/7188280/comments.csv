,snowpea29,2012-04-20T06:05Z,no prob i use this all the time modding wiis this is my own setup as you can tell by the custom card
,been12,2012-04-20T10:05Z,no seeders
,badspazz007,2012-05-07T06:54Z,great setup but usb loadergx and neogamma are garbage loaders compaired to wiiflow. wiiflow will download covers and titles and display's them great.  Will also download cheat codes.  Also you should try Pimp my wii after installing letterbomb and hackmii.  Pimp my wii works alot better then modmii if you are new to wii hacking. and pimp my wii put's all the correct io's w/o any guesswork. modmii is good to update old/outdated mods.
,badspazz007,2012-05-07T07:30Z,"Not worth the download!  NO priloader and no seeders.  For someone that states it's ""perfect"" you are far from perfect.  Just thought you might like it if someone starts cutting you down like you do others. Feels great huh?"
,kibub,2012-05-12T19:57Z,Thanks i'll try it.
,snowpea29,2012-05-22T21:45Z,dude it is a perfect setup the priloader and all that stuff are in there....dowen load and look dont open mouth and talk shit first..........I mod wii every day for pocket change and this is the exact setup i use
