,Dirrrrt,2012-05-20T19:39Z,"I have a problem with this add on. Installed it with the package manager like you should with .rwp files. Route shows up in the game but when I want to start any scenario I get the error that the game can't load rail vehicles - class 86 executive, MK3a coaches and many other things.. Any solution to this?

Thanks in advance."
