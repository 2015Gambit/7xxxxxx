,sistromo,2012-04-14T23:40Z,"Terrific collection, terrible format. Don't you have them in something other than Word?"
,toketom,2012-04-15T00:35Z,Thank you for your numerous contributions. Will the syntopicon be available at a later date?
[T],594mgnav,2012-04-15T19:39Z,i have uploaded all i have.!
,cormaczoso,2012-05-27T18:37Z,"sistromo -- apparently an uploader will upload what they have and not use a 'terrible' format just to yank downloaders chains ... so instead of whining and complaining about someone doing something you have not seen fit to do once on this tracker, convert the document into an 'acceptable' format (to you at least since i see no one else complaining) and then upload it so others may also share in your 'holier than thou' format ... 

until that time however, say thank you and stfu

btw 594, thanks for sharing this and your many other fine offerings :)"
