DESCRIPTION:

There is no better way to own and appreciate the world's greatest written works. 
Great Books of the Western World is one of the most acclaimed publishing feats of our time. Authoritative, accurate, 
and complete, this collection represents the essential core of the Western literary canon, compiling 517 of the 
most significant achievements in literature, history, philosophy, and science into a color-coded set as handsome as 
it is affordable. From the ancient classics to the newest masterpieces of the 20th century, Great Books traces the ideas, 
stories, and discoveries that have shaped modern civilization. Volumes 1 and 2 of this collection is the Syntopicon, 
a unique two-volume guide (not sold separately) that enables you to investigate a particular idea and compare what 
different authors have to say about it. The Syntopicon comprises a new kind of reference work -- accomplishing for 
ideas what the dictionary accomplishes for words and the encyclopaedia accomplishes for facts. Also included is 
the Great Conversation, featuring fascinating background information, extensive timelines, photos, and quotes 
from the classic works and their authors.
