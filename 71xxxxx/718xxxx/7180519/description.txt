What you get here is all currently available subtitled (Jap. voice, Eng. hard-subs) episodes of the Bleach anime series (episodes 001-366) and all 6 "specials" (Both Jump Fiestas and all 4 movies).

What is unique about this torrent (aside from being complete) is that the files are named as necessary for XBMC (see xbmc.org or openelec.tv) to scrape them using thetvdb.com (default TV Show scraper). Names also include conventional bleach numbering (001-366) so you can keep them straight.

Aside from a few random episodes: 

001-271 are subbed by {DB] in 480p (.avi)
272-324 are subbed by [HorribleSubs] in 720p (.mkv)
325-366 are subbed by [Bleachverse] in 720p (.mkv)
Jump Fiesta 2004 & 2005 are 480p (.avi) with subs (unknown team)
Movies 1-4  are 720p (.mkv) with subs (unknown team)
Movies 2-3 have dual audio, so you can listen in English if you prefer (yuck!)


Hope you all enjoy and PLEASE SEED!!!! Some of the episodes between 250-330 are hard to find in HD and alot of the original dattebayo episodes are near impossible!
