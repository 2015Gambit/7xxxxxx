Why is this one uploaded a week too late ?!

IF this really is Episode 9, then it's a week old, and the new episode that was aried yesterday thursday April 12th, is S06E10, and is called "" 2012-04-12 After The Lovin' ""

There are SIX uploads right now of this show - IF it now is S06E10 ?? , and not the one week old E09 ... -  and ALL of them are Tagged wrongly!

WHAT is the problem with all of the uploaders - don't they know how to count ??


A hell lot of the S06E08 are really S06E09 ...


WHAT is the USE of at all tagging/naming shows - why can't we all just upload anything, namned anything, and we will all have some Fun&Games dowloading and guessing what it is we get ...  :-(

,avtraino,2012-04-13T17:29Z,"This tagging problem, whatever the cause, is from way up in the scene. don't blame VTV"

I'm not blaming VTV or any Uploader - I'm just telling'em TO LEARN HOW TO COUNT!
And to use the CORRECT NAME AND EPISODE # !


These shows are all recorded from Tv, they don't come from the 'scene'.

One can tell on the fact that there's always a LOGO in some corner, and that it sometimes pops up Ads for other shows.

If these were recorded directly from some MasterTape/Control Board, they wouldn't have the LOGO there ..
