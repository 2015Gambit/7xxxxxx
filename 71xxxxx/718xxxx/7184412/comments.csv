It worked perfectly as there was no english option I installed it in spanish and got it to work in english by going to the photoshop file located in applications then finding the locales  folder then  kept opening up the files that was in that until I found tw10428.dat I clicked on it and changed 'dat' to bak. It works a dream, thank you I had to upgrade after upgrading to lion…so happy"
