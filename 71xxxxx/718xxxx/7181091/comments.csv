,djlamoreaux,2012-06-13T21:31Z,How do i install the antares plugins?
,csands583,2012-06-14T02:01Z,"There are many .rar files. Do I have to unpack all of them?  

It showed that Vocalign was only a trial version.  Im wondering if this was because i didn't unpack all the files?

Please help.  Thanks"

I do not see it anywhere, I don't want a bunch of trials running on my computer. Please get back to me. Thanks!"
,musicguy1985,2012-09-06T23:33Z,"Nevermind, pretty sure I figured it out! Thanks!"
,musicguy1985,2012-09-06T23:53Z,"Nevermind, nope it still says trial... Not sure what the problem is here..."
