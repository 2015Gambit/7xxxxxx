These are some of my favorite plugins of all time. I found that they were scattered all over the place, and were hard to find. This should make it easier for everyone!

All of the RTAS plugins have been tested, and work with Pro Tools 10.0 running on OSX Lion 10.7.2

I have not tested any of the VST or AU Plugins, but I imagine that they work also.

All credit should be given to the XVX and DYNAMiCS teams for the cracks. I had no part in any of it. Please send them your love.   

Most installations are easy, but if you do require help you can ask me in the comments section.
