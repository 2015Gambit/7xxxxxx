_Release Notes_

Combining the bubbling electronica of Robyn with the hipster synth pop of Annie
and the hook-laden Euro-disco of September, former Idol contestant Tove Styrke
is another product of the burgeoning Swedish female dance scene. Born in the
university town of Umea, Vasterbotten in 1992, Styrke was inspired to pursue a
performing career by her ballet instructor mother and her father, Anders
Ostman, who scored a Swedish number one in the 70s. Encouraged by her piano
teacher grandfather, she took up the instrument at a young age, and influenced
by the likes of Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, and Simon & Garfunkel, became a
vocalist in a traditional jazz band in her teens. After modeling for various
publications including Glamour and Cosmopolitan, she entered the 2009 Swedish
version of Pop Idol, where, thanks to impressive renditions of tracks by
Michael Jackson, Katy Perry, and the Beatles, she finished third behind
runner-up Calle Kristiansen and winner Erik Gronwall. Following the show, she
signed a deal with Sony Records, and began working on her self-titled debut
album with Patrik Berger, Lykke Li, and Shout Out Louds Adam Olenius. Released
in 2010, it spawned two hit singles, ΓÇ£Million PiecesΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£White Light Moment.ΓÇ¥
