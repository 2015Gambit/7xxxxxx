,hoosierdaddy522,2012-04-16T09:45Z,"@slowquin.......just a couple things I want to say. 1st off, 187 seeders & ONLY 2 thanking you for your upload. & 2nd, only 4 people liked your upload enough to give it a +1. That's all I've got to say."
,Cylinc69,2012-04-16T10:50Z,Thanks...
,slowquin,2012-04-16T11:35Z,@hoosierdaddy I usually get a handful of thanks and approx 1500+ DLers....Now it doesn't bother me as I already have the sets nor am I one of those people who need random people on the internet to verify my selfworth. Thanks for your concern though...When Sandra comes back I'll hold that set for a while....Since no one expects her they won't miss her LOL :)
