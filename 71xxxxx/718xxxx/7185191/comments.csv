,RexRexroth,2012-08-12T11:14Z,"I forgot to mention that it's the London Sinfonietta conducted by the famous American composer John Adams, released on Nonesuch Records in 1997.

Around the same time, Adams also conducted a spectacular album of the scores of Leonard Rosenman for ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""East of Eden.""  Look for that, too, if you're a fan of great film music."
