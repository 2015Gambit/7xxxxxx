,diawkdfi,2012-04-14T12:59Z,"Mystic, Sometimes it's better to keep quiet and to be tought a wise man, rather than to open your mouth and highlight your foolishness.  
Disclaimer:  I have never worn a turban.  But I do work with a bunch of 'morans'."
,ben7530,2012-04-14T14:16Z,"Agree with diawkdfi.

@MysticMerlin: I have no real external reason to want to know about the turban. I watch most documentaries simply because I am curious, and this *IS* a nice break from dinosaurs, The falklands, etc."
