Each song is quick and energetic, and has a classic 60ΓÇÖs folk-rock feel. The harmonizing is spot on, particularly in SearchinΓÇÖ and EverybodyΓÇÖs Been TalkinΓÇÖ where the backups by Cass really shine through, as do the occasional high notes and almost-yelling vocals being hit on the male end. While no song is over three minutes long, the expressive You CanΓÇÖt Judge a Book by the Cover clocks in at 2:59 and outshines the other eight songs on the album for sheer quality, of writing, singing, and performing. ItΓÇÖs the kind of song that would be released as a single on the radio today to promote a new band, the kind of single fans download on iTunes and listen to over and over.

Surprisingly, the 21-minute length of the album doesnΓÇÖt disappoint, and in fact turns it into a quick and relaxing easy listen that asks to be left on repeat and let to play over and over. ItΓÇÖs a great tribute to music from the 60ΓÇÖs (big surprise since it was recorded in the ΓÇÖ60ΓÇÖs, right?) and though some of the songs sound vaguely familiar - due to the large amount of music of this type made in the time period - each song manages to hold its own with the listenerΓÇÖs ears and stay new.
