,djt067,2012-04-18T10:16Z,"Gaz, I think there is another ep of TOWIE wed nite uk time in case you were not already aware. Not 100% sure though."
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-18T10:33Z,"I know there is mate, but I am unable to do my own rip of TOWIE as ITV has worked out a new way to block people from doing that. So, I have to wait to get it from the place I have always gotten it from for everyone. That estimated time is Thursday night between 6pm and 12am. If I do work out how to override the ITV block, I will do my own webrip for everyone and try my best to keep the sound in synch :) "
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-18T10:36Z,"PS- That estimated time of 6pm to 12am is Sydney Australia time. In the U.K that would be 9am to 3pm. Cheers, Gaz :)"
,djt067,2012-04-18T11:12Z,Bloody ITV!!! thx Gaz appreciate your work as always.....
