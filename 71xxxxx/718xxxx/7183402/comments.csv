It worked perfectly when I had 1 partition of Win 7 on a computer but seems to not work when trying to delete data from specifically 1 partition in computer with 2 installed Win 7 OS on 2 separate partitions..Is there sth wrong? Am only trying to delete the data from 1 of the OS"
,Ubehage,2012-04-16T18:08Z,It will only delete data from the partitions that are visible/usable with Windows.

Ok thanks. Secondly, it seems like the .exe takes effect immediately. I thought it was only supposed to take effect after a re-log in."
