Personally, I'd prefer Sky. General show/coverage is clearly terrible, but watching F1 without Martin Brundle just isn't the same.
Cheers Footy."
,giffo5,2012-04-15T18:59Z,The qually was Sky sports... is the race only being shown on the BBC Footy ?.... I am confused..lol.
,novsan,2012-04-15T19:09Z,Thank you footy
,Sanyi001,2012-04-15T20:10Z,"no Martin Brundle?? :(
still thanks for the upload"
,Rasmazal,2012-04-15T23:52Z,"@ Paronomasiaster. Don't wish to be an arse?? FFS if you lot had payed any attention over the last 6months you would know that sky and the BBC are sharing coverage of the F1, that means one race you could be watching sky and the next race BBC. So please, everyone stop leaving comments (and being ""an arse"") by asking the U/Ler to stick to one coverage, Footy is U/Ling the live race, be happy with that or go elsewhere!!
Top work Footy, keep it up mate!!!"
,one2123go,2012-04-16T00:11Z,"Forgive my extreme ignorance, but for some reason these are all coming up green with splotches for a second or 2, and then freezing up.  Am I doing something wrong?  It's so hard getting F1 in the U.S., and I love these!"
,nonstop99,2012-04-16T03:24Z,"@Rasmazal.....Actually if YOU had paid any attention over the last 6 months YOU would know that whilst the coverage is being shared it is ONLY the BBC which are only showing half the races. Sky are showing EVERY race live.

Many thanks for the torrent, I really appreciate it and without this I wouldn't be able to watch F1. But I'll be an arse too and say the the Sky coverage> BBC coverage so would love to see the sky coverage where possible."
,eddiesincere2,2012-04-16T03:47Z,Nice one. Much appreciated.
,EdoSensei,2012-04-16T04:38Z,"Sky coverage> BBC coverage

I disagree entire with the above statement. Yes, it would be nice if Brundle had stayed with BBC, but that's the only thing missing from the BBC coverage. It's on an entirely different level of quality than Sky's coverage. BBC got awarded for their coverage. I'm very confident Sky will not be getting that same award."
,nonstop99,2012-04-16T04:56Z,"Well I agree that last years BBC coverage was excellent, and I'll even say that I think it was better than what sky will produce this year.

The fact is that I watch F1 for the race not the pre production stuff. Sky have a far better commentary team and for that reason only I prefer the sky coverage. I'll still watch the bbc f1 forum though.

BBCs coverage simply cannot be as good as previous years because IMHO brundle, kravitz and coulthard were their biggest assets and they lost two of them. 

I would rather Sky weren't involved at all. But they are."
,nobodynever,2012-04-16T05:15Z,"I'm glad Brundle left the BBC.  He did nothing but these two things: 1 bother people and get in people's ways on the grid walk.  He made a pest of himself to Ferrari years ago and now he just keeps on walking past anything red.  And 2 State the obvious.  

BBC>Sky.  Jordan and Coulthard are excellent.  "
,nobodynever,2012-04-16T05:49Z,It says D. Humphrey.  Is he Jake Humphrey's evil (hetero) twin?
,deim0n,2012-04-16T06:58Z,"I'm here in the states and I have to say both Sky and BBC far better than what we get here on Speed. I don't even bother watching it live, I'd rather wait for the UK broadcasts to be uploaded. 

That being said, I would have to say the BBC coverage is better than Sky. Sky reminds me too much of the crap we get here, I like a pretty girl just like the next guy, but I see no point in Georgie and that dude in front of the screen, also Hill is too stiff. I do miss Martin and Ted, but Eddie and David are great, I didn't care too much for David at first, but he's grown on me.

Good stuff Footy, you're a life saver for us over here who have to suffer with Speed."
,DOHC-6,2012-04-16T07:08Z,"@deim0n,

I agree completely, Speed is *left in the dust* when it comes to the quality of the event broadcast.

What happened to the HD 6 channel audio when this file was created? 4 channels are missing, for me, the surround audio is just as important as the HD video."
,EdoSensei,2012-04-16T10:40Z,"""I'll still watch the bbc f1 forum though.""

If anyone uploads it, I would like to too. Did they do one yesterday after the race? 
Not up yet AFAIK!"
,frostbite88,2012-04-16T13:51Z,"bbc ftw!
if onli martin brundle still wif bbc"
,nonstop99,2012-04-16T23:12Z,"Well regardless of Sky>BBC or BBC>Sky i don't think it matters in this case since I think the race was so good. Didn't matter what commentary team covered it.

There was definitely an F1 forum. I was able to watch it on iPlayer through a UK vpn."
,EdoSensei,2012-04-17T04:51Z,"BBC Forum is up. Search ""Forum"""
,meth0dman,2012-04-17T15:06Z,"this is an absolute MUST WATCH, seriously. f1 is back to its golden days I think, the racing is so close and where there was a huge gap between teams before is now narrowed down to virtually nothing. its exciting racing again, thank god it's back!! i've been more entertained from the past 3 games than i've been for the past 2-3 years of f1, gotta love it. congrats to niko, top race from him. the rest behind him were so occupied fighting eachother they never stood a chance of even catching up. his pace was in a different class, and who else than ross brawn can make a car and team function so well? the mans a genius, will be interesting to see if it's just a one race happening or if this car can be competitive, and the drivers ofcourse. something tells me mclaren has the edge though this year, they look strong."
,sandw1ch,2012-04-18T04:39Z,"SOME OF THESE COMMENTS are so stupid I feel compelled to address the most astonishing examples:

""Sky coverage> BBC coverage so would love to see the sky coverage where possible.""

I suspect the choice was made by the highly-respected capper ""Hannibal"". Either way, Footy has done exactly what any knowledgeable F1 fan would ask of him--upload the BBC's superior coverage whenever possible, and upload Sky's coverage when it is the only English-language HD broadcast available. Cheers, Footy--you're a true enthusiast.

""Sky have a far BETTER COMMENTARY team and for THAT REASON ONLY I prefer the sky coverage."" [emphasis added]

You have no idea what you're talking about--visual presentation is the sole advantage accorded to Sky by consensus. Sky can polish their own logo all they want, but all the production values in the world can't improve their commentary. Simon Lazenby is almost enough by himself to make me forsake complete coverage and wait for the BBC's Highlights programme. I'm sure he was brilliant at capturing the political nuances and technological breakthroughs of European rugby, but CGI can't make up for the fact that Lazenby has no relationship with F1 personalities, and high-def eye candy can't distract from the fact that he knows racing about as well as Georgie Thompson.

At least Sky don't let Martin Brundle dress like a Long Island under-don. Note to Martin Turner: put Damon Hill in a blazer so he has some place besides his jeans pockets to stow his free hand.

""Brundle....made a pest of himself to Ferrari years ago and now he just keeps on walking past anything red.""

Did you watch the Melbourne race? Stefano Domenicali invited Brundle to Fiorano last month for a suitably hagiographic interview--and for laps around the pista in Fernando Alonso's 2010 near-championship F10. If you really knew enough to talk this kind of shit, you also would remember Brundle was invited to lap the 599XX around Fiorano years ago. I have noticed he avoids Michael Schumacher like the plague, but he fears red about as much as you fear being underinformed."
,nonstop99,2012-04-19T07:53Z,"For your first point, Hannibal capped and uploaded both sets of coverage. Also no disrespect was ever intended towards footy. I thanked him in my first post and I continue to be gracious for his efforts. Without his upload I would not have been able to enjoy the F1 Sunday night.

For your second point you seem to be complaining about the fact that I prefer Sky's commentary team of David Croft & Martin Brundle over BBC's Ben Edwards and David Coulthard, yet you make no mention of any of these people in your statement.

Your third point I agree completely with.

Finally, I will say again - last year the BBC did a wonderful job and the coverage was top notch and I expect that Sky will not be able to repeat that quality.

However, this year I don't believe the BBC have the resources to live up to last years coverage, and quite frankly nor do Sky.

Once again - I wish Sky weren't involved - but since they are i'm happy to put up with some of the crap in order listen to Croft and Brundle on the main race."
,ohess,2012-04-19T13:24Z,"Thanks footy, nice upload, great race.I hope you upload all F1 races this season. Keep up the good work. I don't know about Martin Brundle. This is the first time I downloaded a race to watch because I live in Greece and was previously watching them on Greek T.V. with Greek commentary of which I understand zero. So it was great to watch and understand what was being said. Seems the race was very well covered. Personally if you have the appetite to upload from 2 different sites I'll try the sky site just to compare. Sounds like a lot of work though and I wouldn't blame you if you didn't. I'm just happy to have nice clear pictures and English commentary. Please keep uploading the regular video versions though as I can't afford to buy an external memory for my computer and the high res uploads take too much memory."
