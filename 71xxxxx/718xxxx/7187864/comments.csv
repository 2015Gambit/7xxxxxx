,Hachiuma,2012-04-22T06:28Z,"It says I need a serial number, help!?"
,ElementalCyclone,2012-04-27T06:47Z,"no you don't need any serial number....
just crack it.
after installation done it will ask for activation.... and choose ""no"" after that crack it up"
,ElementalCyclone,2012-04-27T09:16Z,"EVERYBODY THERE SOMETHING WRONG ON THE TUTORIAL TEXT NO.2
there was wrote: 
""1. Copy VOCALOID2.exe Vocaloid installation directory""
it should be:
""1. Copy VOCALOID2.exe to Vocaloid installation directory""
Thanks for the attention and thanks"

,JordanX2,2012-05-14T02:07Z,hey i need help...wat is the VOCALOID2.exe?
,JordanX2,2012-05-14T02:54Z,ok i do not understand this... can you tell me the file names and to what file i need to move them... i cannot figure out the how to crack!!!!
,ElementalCyclone,2012-05-16T17:11Z,"There should be a guide tell how to install and crack vocaloid try to explore ""How To"" folder and read the guide"
,Muneera,2012-05-20T19:10Z,"I don't quite understand the cracking part, you see this is my first time ever cracking or downloading something from here so the part that says; Copy   
VOCALOID2.exe to Vocaloid installation directory I don't know what's the vocaloid installation? and the VOCALOID2.exe application won't open which is really confusing me. I'm pretty much a noob handling with these stuff so can I have an explanation please? >< I'd be really grateful. Thanks."
,ElementalCyclone,2012-05-22T17:37Z,"Well just copy and paste ""Vocaloid2.exe"" from the ""Vocaloid 2 Hatsune Miku Crack.rar"" to your install dir, for example you install vocaloid on C:Program FilesVocaloid 2.So you just simply copy and paste the ""Vocaloid2.exe"" file to there,Just overwrite the existed file.Sorry for the slow respond......"
,ElementalCyclone,2012-05-22T17:43Z,"And if it won't open,there are some possibility that i know....
1.)The installation wasn't complete
2.)The installation was complete but not cracked yet.
3.)The installation was complete and cracked,but it was revealed if it fake and been modified by Yamaha Server.This can be happen if you attempt to activate the cracked program legally i.e. by activate it via internet but the program was already cracked......."

,Ukai,2012-06-18T01:10Z,"I'm having a problem with the crack program, it starts and stays at 0.0%  What do?"
,Tiagoftw,2012-06-22T02:32Z,Does it work on a Mac?
,ElementalCyclone,2012-07-05T17:31Z,"Ukai : There are two possibilities,first your computer is too fast so the process done so quick or second,the file that will be replaced by the crack program aren't the proper files.

Tiagoftw:it will work on Mac if you do something called ""porting""..... i'm using Windows so i don't know much about porting,just Google for it......""Porting a Windows software to Mac"".Good Luck"
,Skitungen2,2012-08-04T20:54Z,"I'm having a little bit of a problem when cracking, when I start the VOCALOID2 MIKU Crack.exe I press yes and select my installation folder but nothing happens?
I'm totally clueless :S"
,ElementalCyclone,2012-08-08T19:21Z,"Well maybe it means your cracking has done or,something wrong with the file that should be cracked"
,charizard31,2012-09-15T07:29Z,"I have the program but when i do something, it will tell me in random characters"
