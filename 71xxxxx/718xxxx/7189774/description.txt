From Wiki:


The Quireboys are an English hard rock band formed in 1984 in London, England, with strong ties to Newcastle.[1] When the band formed they were originally known as The Queerboys and later as the London Quireboys in the United States.[2]

The band were successful during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with their debut album A Bit of What You Fancy reaching #2 on the UK charts. Their highest charting single for the band was with the song "Hey You", which reached #14.

In 1993, the Quireboys broke up but briefly reformed live in 1995 with different members. A more permanent reformation came in 2001 when frontman Spike, guitarist Guy Griffin and bassist Nigel Mogg put together a new line-up. The band is still active, recording new material and playing live.
