,nydhoggur,2012-07-21T18:20Z,"Unfortunately ""Rattle189"" is not even an honest thief, you should find another uploader  that you can trust.

Do not take my words for it:

 go through the comments here and judge for yourselves.


You will find that either someone else is always sharing what he is trying to peddle as his own.


Have a nice day.

,NormNyan,2012-07-22T12:20Z,"@nydhoggur This torrent ain't fake you moron, he made this by himself. Look at the files, idiot. Reply back if you saw anything. You should think twice before commenting here at a popular torrent."
,nydhoggur,2012-07-22T16:12Z,"Hardly popular... hahaha,  looking at seeders and leechers..  (could say this at all your torrents since none of them are popular, but won't bother)

 and as it happens people do connect the dots and by now most people that even know of your little existence, know it for what it is by now..

game over little thief, I know that you know it... 

play angry, play cool, that shitty feeling in your belly is because you are a sad little thieving looser and you hate that everyone can always see it, so go ahead, try worming around...

I won't bother replying to you further, I wish you luck in trying to find real self esteem little thief."
,Rattle189,2012-08-03T15:10Z,@nydhoggur Thanks dude.
