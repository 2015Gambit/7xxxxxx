V: 7

Hand outs: 9
- not all are given, in the real program it comes with a journal to log your workouts and meals but it doesn't come with this. just use a calorie counting site/app instead and you'll be fine."
,Couch601,2012-04-15T01:34Z,"Sorry there is no Journal, this is how I got it, try pen and paper? ;p"
,Couch601,2012-04-15T01:37Z,"tbh the meal plan is not in my budget, so I'll stick to tatties and mince with some veg :p"
,Couch601,2012-04-15T02:16Z,I curious to why you give the video 7 as far as Im aware its the exact quality you get from the original. Cant please everyone I guess even when its free
,KeyboardWench,2012-04-15T03:49Z,"Nothing to apologize for at all! You uploaded this and for that I'm grateful!

I don't need the journal, I'm using my heart rate monitor and a calorie counter already so it's not a big deal. I was just commenting on it for other people looking at it. Other than one page being out of order for the scans of the books, the pdfs are perfect.

In the world of where people are used to 1080p and 720p, the video's resolution is 640x480. I rated it on what other people might think about it. Again, like the hand outs, this doesn't bother me at all but it isn't perfect. If that is the quality of the videos then that's unimpressive and I'm surprised people actually pay that much for the videos. This (http://i1026.photobucket.com/albums/y322/andyoubrute/1.png) is what it looked like for me. At that quality it sort of irked me as I'm enjoy giffing/making graphics with CS5. I can't see myself doing much with this - the 30DS gif set I created a while back was super popular. It doesn't destroy the view but it's not pretty. It's definitely work-able and passes. When you're working out a few metres away it's going to be a lot more clear.

I wasn't rating the video on the content. That I'm sure is great, as why I downloaded it. [Although I can't say for sure as I haven't actually completed it.] I loved the 30 Day Shred, had great results [-10lbs, -3 inches off my waist] and am eager to start this. However like you said about the meal plan, it's not in my budget to buy the actual program XD I'm a poor student! I couldn't even afford to download this on my internet plan, I did it at my university. 

(By the way, I loved the speed of downloading this. Compared to the original on one here it was very fast - took less than 4 hours and I seeded about 9 gigs of it before I had to leave school.)"
,blazerder,2012-04-15T05:53Z,Does anyone have access key to Jillian Michael's diet app?
,Couch601,2012-05-01T01:47Z,"I stopped seeding this 3 days after uploading but it seems to be getting more seeds every day, Thanks to you all for keeping it going :)

Now if only I could be asssed exercising ;)"
,Couch601,2012-05-01T01:49Z,yeah understand now about the video rating :) its far from High Def 
,oceanjam,2012-06-05T14:39Z,Does anyone have all the pages? It seems for example that pages 12-13 are missing from the 7-day kick start thing.
,crimson85067,2012-08-05T20:55Z,if we do this workout will we be lesbians too?
,Ohbetty,2012-08-22T17:26Z,PERFECT! Thanks!
,gaseous,2012-09-08T21:35Z,"Couch601 Thanks for uploading this!

crimson85067 Yes, and if you are male your gender will change and you will become a lesbian. DUH! LOL"
