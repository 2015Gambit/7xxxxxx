JLinux 12-4.09

Linux Distribution based on Ubuntu 10.04.4 (Lucid)
Lot's of extras, including all codecs, flash, java, etc.
 
Includes both XBMC and Serviio set up together to turn the system into a UPnP media server, media center or both.

Runs on most Laptops and Desktops but needs a good graphics card to get the full experience.

Try it Live and if you like it please install.

This is still in testing, so use it at your own risk.
I haven't ran into any major bugs yet but this is by no means a stable release.

--Thanks
