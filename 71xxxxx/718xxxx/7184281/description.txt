"The Last Meal"

Joe and Annie, a once-happily married 
couple, ate at The Bella Plata restaurant 
every year on their anniversary, until mob 
boss Fico Vasquez closed it down. Now, to 
save his marriage, Joe asks Walter to help 
him find the meal over which he and his 
wife first fell in love. To do that, 
Walter must track down the restaurant's 
chef, whom the mob also is looking for. 
Meanwhile, Willa gets thrown back in jail 
after getting into a fight with a girl 
who's impersonating her.
