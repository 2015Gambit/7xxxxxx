There was a Subaru commercial posing as MythBusters footage before the
last commercial break called "MythBusters Insider Info". Figured it
was not meant to be part of the show since cutting it yielded the
normal Discovery Channel runtime. For those that are curious about it,
it read:

"Adam's pirate accent is an attempt at mimicking British pirate
Bartholomew Roberts. Known as 'Black Bart', Roberts plundered around
400 Ships!"

Pretty dumb, right? Try harder next time, Subaru.
