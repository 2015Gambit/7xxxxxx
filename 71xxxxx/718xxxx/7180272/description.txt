2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

I truly pray that these Christian music torrents I've been sharing here on The Pirate Bay are indeed a blessing to you, and those you might be sharing it with.  Some of it has enriched my walk, and I pray yours too.  Today's 11th bundle is no different.  It contains 19 additional releases, bringing the year-to-date total up from 269 releases to 288 releases for the year.

Please continue to seed for as long as you're able to.  If that's only a day, then bless you for that.  Two days?  Great!  A week?  I'm sure someone else will be thankful you've been able to share for that long.  Every little bit truly helps.
