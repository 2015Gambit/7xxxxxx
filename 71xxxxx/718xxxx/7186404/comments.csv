,Shikaku2,2012-04-15T21:16Z,"When my system crashed and I had to reinstall XP, I had nothing but luck w/Maher's version through 1/2012. Why would be given a ""negative"" about the quality and not state what is (was) the issue?"
[M],{wasalnaser},2012-04-16T15:28Z,Thank You! Torrent Is Completely Clean

click my name ;-)"
,Plassey,2012-04-20T21:23Z,"Your torrents have always been of the highest quality, clean & with a seamless install. I installed your XP March 2012 release & it worked like a bomb!!! You are indeed a master practitioner in your craft, & we guys out in the Cloud all owe you tons. I'm curious though, why have you not put your infinite skills into a Windows 7 Ultimate Release? We all would look forward to such a release knowing the quality would be awesome.  Go for it Maherz!!!! God Bless"
,Syonix,2012-04-22T02:11Z,"Thank you very much Maherz! Iso is in perfect order! Easiest way to set up a boot disk is to right click on the iso and click ""burn to disk"" (if you have windows 7). No serials, no keygens, just easy :) Thanks again!"
,MhrBhr,2012-04-24T03:13Z,"thanks!
been waiting for it :)
for those who are facing troubles, just reburn iso using slow speed with burner software :)
I am recommending poweriso.

Please Maher, where to get latest comprehensive drivers ?"
,MPRangton,2012-04-25T02:22Z,Does this pass Windows Genuine Advantage?
,phKRII,2012-05-01T22:04Z,Need ar product key!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Abett234,2012-05-08T00:40Z,I need step-by-step instructions.
,NeonDrum,2012-05-08T03:28Z,"Just wondering, is this a fully unattended install? I plan to use this with nLite, strip out the garbage and add some software and if the source is already unattended it can cause issues once installed."
[H],NZPirate,2012-05-10T10:55Z,Thanks.
,mafatit,2012-05-11T19:26Z,"getting stuck on saving settings , 9 minutes remaining. please assist how do i get over it."
,bladeshrk,2012-05-12T18:26Z,When is May release going to release??
,xlevelx,2012-05-13T05:03Z,"Very nice compilation. Just click when prompted to set your time zone, and input ""WORKGROUP"" when asked what group you want to join, and it'll finish up nicely. 

And for anyone that is having ""trouble"" installing this, you should just pack up your computer and return it to where you bought it from. You couldn't ask for an easier program to use."
,Bayskuxx,2012-05-14T08:39Z,would i be able to use this with virtual box on a mac? cheers.....
,arun82a,2012-05-20T16:44Z,need to try....
