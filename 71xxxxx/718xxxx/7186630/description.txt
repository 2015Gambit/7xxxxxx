"Josep Guardiola is treating Saturday’s clash with Levante with the utmost importance. He knows that the next league fixture, against leaders Real Madrid, will be much more difficult than people seem to think and therefore “I’ll playing what I think is the strongest team and that can adapt best to the opponent and the ground”. Although he has a crucial Champions League semi final against Chelsea to worry about in addition to the clásico, he is not even contemplating the idea of resting any of his stars. “We know it’s difficult but we want to extend our league challenge and to do that we have to play the best team we can … if the difference was ten points we could make one competition a priority, but given the situation we are in, the game with Levante is more important”.

In La Liga, he believes it is essential for his team to stay within at least four points of the lead. “If we don’t win the game against Levante, we’ll have nothing to play for against Madrid” he said. “We would lose the little chance we have … There is only one way to extend competitions, and that’s by winning”.
