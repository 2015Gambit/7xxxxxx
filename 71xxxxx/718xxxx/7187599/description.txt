SAW THAT THIS WASN'T ON TPB AND SINCE NEW WAKING SERIES IS STARTING ( I'll upload 

that later ),I THOUGHT YOU WAN'T TO JOG YOUR MEMORY OR READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T...

IMO THIS IS SOLID READ AND IS A MUST READ FOR ANY HORROR FAN...

 Pushing the boundaries on horror storytelling, Raven Gregory pulls you in and never lets you go.  It's an edge-of- your-seat thrill ride that you won't want to end.  With pencils by Vic Drujiniu and colors by Mark Roberts, we get to see the visual spectacle that is, The Waking.  If you haven't collected the single issues by now, pick up the trade paperback.  If you are horror fan, you will not be disappointed.
