Herein lies a complete collection of official music released for the Mass Effect trilogy, including
the DLC's for Mass Effect 2.  Specifically, included are:

-Mass Effect
-Mass Effect 2
-Mass Effect 2: Atmospheric

These are all official releases except for the Arrival tracks, which were never officially released 
for download.  Ignore the file names as I was too lazy to bother.  However, rest assured the metadata
