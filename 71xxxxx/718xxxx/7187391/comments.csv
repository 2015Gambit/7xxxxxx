,.Leto.,2012-04-15T17:54Z,"Really stupid... So you have the audio @ 1510kbps, which means that there's about 1Gb just for that, but what really matters, the video, is only @ 1791kbps ??
That's really dumb, you should have done the opposite."
,.Leto.,2012-04-15T18:28Z,"Look at this one:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7187734/Sherlock.Holmes.A.Game.Of.Shadows.2011.720p.BRRiP.XViD.AC3-MAJES
3.5Gb so about the same size BUT video bitrate is @ 3 449 Kbps, audio @ 448 Kbps
So picture quality can only be better. Audio will be the same since 1510kbps is totally useless for that."

DTS audio is great on this one, good video for a 3GB file too.
Stop complaining on the audio and go buy a mediaplayer and surroundreceiver ! Seriously, you'r missing out on the best thing about movies without DTS playback."

[V],meech,2012-04-16T12:38Z,"A big thing to remember is that Video bitrate isn't everything when it comes to video quality.  A LOT of it also depends on the advanced x264 options that are chosen...8x8 transform, trellis, pyramidal b-frames and so on.  If the encoder has a powerful computer, or is willing to wait for a long encode, they can max out or turn up these settings and gain a significant amount of compression.  I've done a few bluray movies myself and the size (bitrate = directly proportional to size) of the files, even at crf=18, a very hi constant quality (for video) rate factor for bluray, was on par with this posted movie, since I keep the encoder settings very hi."

subme and merange a little low, other than that OK,

subme 9 and merange 24 would be far better, and does not add that much to encoding time, 10% approx.

to be picky i would also do rc_lookahead=40 (50) as it gives the encoder more knowledge of what type of frames is coming (allows far better compression ability, and an extra 10 should not add too much to encoding time)

,Shadow416,2012-07-05T22:33Z,"@burn

I'm currently downloading the file so i dont know if the subs are separate. If it is separate just make sure the subtitle file is the same name as the video file and in the same folder. Then run it with VLC player and it'll auto load the subs if not you can right click on VLC while the movie is playing and go to Subtitle and either select the subtitle track in the list or open file and manually select the subtitle, should work that way.

If you're trying to view it on a ps3/xbox/dvd-bluray player, it won't work unless you embedd the srt file with the video (in the compatible player format like wmv, mp4, avi) and most devices wont even see that so you would have to HARDCODE the subtitle onto the video so that it would always show. Only program that I know that does it is Xilisoft ultimate video converter and or Virtual Dub.

Good luck"
