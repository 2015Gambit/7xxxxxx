The classic SRPG Final Fantasy Tactics PSP enhanced port. Now with DrBretto's 1.3.1.0 Insane Difficulty Patch (inspired by Arcael and others from the FinalFantasyhactics.com website)

This game makes the original FFT and the PSP port (War of the Lions) look like a Disney game.

If you enjoy SRPG's and/or Final Fantasy games, or if you're looking for a really hard game, then this game is definitely for you!

The game is in CSO format and is rar'd for faster downloading. 

You MUST have (L)CFW or a HEN with an ISO loader on your PSP to run this game.

If you have any problems running this game or installing (L)CFW/HEN on your PSP feel free to post a comment and I will help you with anything regarding the Sony PSP.

If you plan on downloading this game I also recommend downloading LivePatch and the FFTPSP patches (There are two patches for this game, one fixes the lag for certain battle animations and the other corrects the stretch that the enhanced port for the PSP has over the original for the PS1)
