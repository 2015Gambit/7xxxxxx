theoretical math music
by amon293

“theoretical math music” is the result of eduardo costa alter-ego, amon293 that is used as a channel of communication between the subconscious and the real world. result of a merger of ideas materialized in sound, that doesn’t respect music standards and travels along alternative progressive rock. confuse, crazy, incomprehensible, boring, undefined, repeated ad nauseam, unpractical, impossible to execute, are common words to describe the music of amon293. all those words are true but he simply don’t care.

this album has special appearances of nick borrego (great voice on jupiter), gonçalo castro, guitarist on ravensouland, hatedisposal and clutter (great shred on driving blind) and ana rita who is the voice on sleep. "theoretical math music" recordings began in 2007 and continued until 2008 where the first demo version was launched, with the total alignment and low quality that it deserves. during the years 2009 and 2010 the demo was re-recorded with the acquisition of new recording gear, in order to improve the quality of the sound. well, i think it worth it. all work is licensed under creative commons. you can copy and share freely, but you can’t sell or modify the music.
