HOMESTUCK SOUND TEST is a fan compilation of 'extra' music from Homestuck, with around FOUR HOURS (!!!) of play time, over 120 tracks.

It contains unreleased tracks, removed tracks (with the original cover art and track number), and remixed tracks (songs that have been officially released and then altered for use in a Homestuck flash), unreleased songs by the music team (over 90 of these!) as well as music from three albums: The Baby Is You by Radiation, A Plumbthroat Christmas by Albatross Soup, and Seer by EidolonOrpheus. There is also an in-depth credits text doc. Enjoy!

Changes from the previous version include: 20+ new tracks!
