please stop with bad img hosts and finding lame ways to get around the block.
This is simple warning, if you keep up with this you will soon find your account demoted. If you still do not get the hint and keep going, you will get your acc banned with all your torrents removed.

if you want a img host then there is plenty clean ones.
here is one:

Need to spam,  Infect our computers for your selfish gains.  Unfoertunately, youre not the only uploader doing this"
[T],dodgerblue,2012-04-17T16:24Z,"You can upload about 140 different formats. There's even support for .RAR and .ZIP-archives! If you upload an archive with multiple images, you'll also get an album-address for all the pictures inside of it. Tags are separated by spaces, removal code is a password to let you remove images you upload.
Max file upload size is 100MB. If you're crazy and upload that much, then you should consider getting friends.
bayimg.com is a place where you can host all your images. We do not censor them. We believe in freedom of speech, it's of utter importance to us. As long as your pictures are legal they will be hosted here, but we reserve the right to remove images due to technical reasons though. If something crashes here, you better have a backup yourself - hopefully that won't happen. Usually we know what we're doing.
BTW - If you tag your content, we would like you to know that we did not build this site for any kind of porn. There are so many places on the net that host porn and we're on another mission here than hosting your fap material. Put the porn on Imagefap.com or some other site instead if possible, ok?-another joke??"
