This is the patch to fix the lag/slowdown of certain actions (spells, skills etc) during battles in Final Fantasy Tactics : War of the Lions for the Sony PSP. 

This .rar contains EVERYTHING you need (not including (L)CFW ) to install the patcher, just follow the readme included in the .rar file.

This patcher DOES NOT need to be applied to an ISO separately, it patches the game "on the fly" right from your PSP every time you load the game. 

Following the readme instructions you should have NO problems installing this. 

Happy gaming!
