,Imatman3579,2012-04-14T11:11Z,Anybody going to seed this?? I have been sitting at 0% for 30 minutes atleast.
,Happy_In_Kaohsiung,2012-04-14T12:20Z,"Whoever you are,thank you"
,Happy_In_Kaohsiung,2012-04-14T13:35Z,"Although as @Imatman3579 says if you're not going to seed it there's no point,I'm still at 0% over an hour later."
,Who-He-iZ,2012-04-14T19:17Z,"Hi HAPPY ! Don't worry, it's seeded alright. But as with Part 1 and 2 it's just going slow, those took many days (maybe a week) to be completed but they were completed 100 %. Just be patient, it will be worth it. 1,9 % complete now. "

,Capt.Klaa,2012-04-14T22:59Z,That works
,Happy_In_Kaohsiung,2012-04-15T15:51Z,"Hi Who,yes I guess you're right.And the V models are ALWAYS worth waiting for aren't they :-)

And many thanks to you for all your great stuff over there on mnova,Awesome stuff."
,tt54,2012-04-15T22:28Z,"I need more patience!  180 seeders and I am only downloading at 1.8kbps.  DAMN!!
Thanks for the up."
,Who-He-iZ,2012-04-16T13:34Z,"Yes, it's too slow. 4,8 % after 50 hours. uTorrent shows wrong number of seeders always when there are hundreds peers like on this one (600 peers now). It goes slow because there is in fact  only 1 seeder and he's not online very often it seems. Btw, it's not my torrent (if you thought) i like to upload much smaller files for your enjoyment. Just uploaded Ksenya Y057 in 9 great sets on Mnova :

,gstued,2012-04-17T22:08Z,...this is not the first time this nonsense was pulled. If you are going to run this off of a modem connection...break it down to reasonable sizes. 
,death2Uall,2012-04-21T23:36Z,"Actually, I've been sitting at 18.7% for a WEEK with no activity at all (I don't consider a ""download rate"" between 0.1 and 0.3 kb activity), and the asshole uploader isn't even showing as a seeder any more. What a fucking waste of time."
,tt54,2012-04-28T05:31Z,Word.  I deleted this a few days ago since it is so slow.  Been two weeks and everyone I show is at 27.9%.
,terrenmcconn,2012-05-17T17:09Z,"Thank you, whoever you are.  Worth the wait.  Hope the next one finishes a bit faster, though.  I'll seed for a long time.  "
