,typek10,2012-04-20T00:32Z,"I don't like the title of this torrent. It suggests that the game data origins from gog.com. That's not the case, since gog.com doesn't have this game in their catalouge."

,RealOneX,2012-04-22T20:53Z,This torrent is NOT from gog.com and it DOES NOT run on Win 7 x64. It's a pre-installed copy of SWAT 4 (v1.0 though the latest is 1.1) with a cracked exe and reg file that needs editing to point to where you place the files. At least the torrent was virus-free but was a complete waste of time downloading.

Single player works, and I was excited to see that multiplayer did as well. Great torrent overall I thought."
