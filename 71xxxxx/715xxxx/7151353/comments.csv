[V],bestec1234,2012-04-02T00:45Z,"Yes, I inadvertently used a larger than normal chunk size on those torrents.   Many leechers will appear to have none of the torrent, because the have no complete chunks yet.  Just leave it in your client like you would any other torrent, and you'll be fine.

I fixed it for the torrents after those three, except for the atkextoics video torrent.  For that one, though, the large chunk size is more appropriate (comparatively speaking), and not as much of a problem."
