At great risk I did this for all of you because Sony Classics is carefully releasing this in non Asian territories so it wouldn't get cammed."
,magicman0900,2012-04-03T23:47Z,22 seeders and not one seeding.... common guys!
,magicman0900,2012-04-03T23:50Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEED you thieves!!! 
,otherthani,2012-04-04T00:59Z,will gladly seed for this. If this is real.... YOU DA MAN!!!!!
,kungfusage,2012-04-04T00:59Z,I've got it up on Demonoid and Kickass if anyone wants to try there.
,kungfusage,2012-04-04T01:04Z,"It's real. At great risk I got and at even greater risk I'm uploading it and seeding it! As soon as it gets up and running. I'm out. Sony Classics has kept it out of Asian territories (it's Indonesian, not Chinese) so it wouldn't get cammed. And now I went out my way to put it up for all the guys who really put there time and devotion into sharing (The Lion's Team, Kingdom Release, Vision, HD Scene, you know who you are). But where the fuck are the seeders. I snatch and go sometimes too, when there's hundreds of seeders, not when it's hot and new. C'mon mother fuckers, help me out!"
,kungfusage,2012-04-04T01:07Z,"I snatch and go sometimes when there are plenty of seeders but c'mon guys, this is just up and running. Help it get going. Vision, The Lion's team, Kingdom Release--where are you now? I did this for you guys!"
,otherthani,2012-04-04T01:42Z,also wanted to add... from the first few minutes I viewed during dl.... this is an excellent cam quality. 10v/10a (for a cam). Thanks again... cant wait to watch on big tv when its done downloading. Seed.... seed.... seed.
,magicman0900,2012-04-04T02:04Z,"still not 1 person seeding! demonoid has the right idea, for you douchebags who like to dl but not seed... selfish!!!"
,kungfusage,2012-04-04T02:18Z,"It should list at least me seeding, right? i see 34 seeders. Is something wrong that magicman doesn't see not even one?"
,pbs413,2012-04-04T02:42Z,Not on Demonoid asshole. Not on Kick you're asshole. I'll claim as a fake.
,magicman0900,2012-04-04T02:46Z,"well it showes 0(34)... io dont know if mine is messed up or what but im dling at 12 kbs... its killing me, haha"
,magicman0900,2012-04-04T02:48Z,well it shows 0(60) now... but still no active seeders... is ther a way to refresh it or something
,magicman0900,2012-04-04T02:56Z,"idk, this is the most difficult dl ive had... i think my comp is fuckin up"
,otherthani,2012-04-04T04:09Z,"Problem is... that, the most everyone seeding has of the file is 44% right now. Its at a bottleneck. Once more people have the complete file, it will start to speed up."
,otherthani,2012-04-04T04:12Z,ul speed 110 kb/s. dl speed 1.4 kb/s. haha.
,kungfusage,2012-04-04T04:20Z,"Who the fuck is pbs413 with childish ranting like a little pussy. There's always at least one asshole on these sites. Unbelievable. It's on Demonoid and Kickass, dickhead. Get a life! It's about sharing, not competing you egotistical prissy bitch!"
,stirgy1,2012-04-04T09:16Z,"Seed this muthafucker!!

,koalaman,2012-04-04T11:21Z,"It took eleven hours, but it just now finished. I can confirm that this is the real deal. Thanks a bunch, kungfusage. 

I'll seed for as long as I can. More people need to join me... Right now there are 16 seeders and 577 leechers. That's fucking ridiculous.

ALSO, PLEASE STILL SEE THIS IN THEATERS. I'm only downloading it because I can't wait, but once it comes out in my area (another two weeks), I'm definitely seeing it multiple times. Support the fantastic director and team behind this film!"
,kungfusage,2012-04-04T12:57Z,"Well said Koalaman. It deserves to be seen in theaters. Well guys I did my part. I wish i could've gotten it even better quality but it was very risky to do. Still one of the best cams you'll ever see, especially for a dark movie. I'm glad it's finally up and running now. Enjoy. You won't see me here again unless I'm truly needed as in this case. Thanks for all the guys who helped out. And thanks to Kingdom Release and HD Scene and Vision and all the rest who put so much time and effort into quality and sharing. I did this for you guys."
,TheStrobe,2012-04-04T13:19Z,as fake as fuck
,nickisme123,2012-04-04T16:13Z,"This is a legit copy. However, whoever did the cam work deserves to be fucking SHOT!!!!! will continue to upload, but please be aware this is a cam copy and if you don't want a half-assed copy and can wait, don't bother."
,Wazabi,2012-04-05T05:06Z,Thanks for all the effort!
,geez_r1,2012-04-06T02:45Z,"just finished downloading, will not seed.................................sike sike sike...""seeding"" (in charlie sheen voice)"
,DragonFun,2012-04-06T21:06Z,how bad is it haven't downloaded it yet
,peaquod,2012-04-07T13:23Z,"Thanks mate much appreciated...ignore the BS,will seed asap"
,Pyatin,2012-04-07T23:39Z,"Legit version.  
V4/A4 
the Cam seems to be angled during most of the movie, and adjusts to show the English subtitles.  at times the screen is cropped, and the quality of the camera is noticeably poor.  High motion is not captured very well, and the regular picture is quite fuzzy.  Still for a rare movie, and few Cam versions being available, this is fairly watchable.  If you want a better picture, I suggest you wait until a better version is avail."
,photon3456,2012-04-17T15:37Z,"Opo iki... ora ngarti aku ini....
nunggu yang V10/A10 ah...."
