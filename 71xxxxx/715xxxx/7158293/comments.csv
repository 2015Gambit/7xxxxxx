Seeding ... and A/V quality is 10/10 again :)

Couple of questions ... is this (E09) the season finale? Also, what's going on with Doomsday Bunkers? "

[V],psspss,2012-04-06T01:41Z,"the new container/header avidemux beta uses
seems to throw ps3 users.. 

just download umile encoder 3.1.1.2 and downgrade
it again to single pass.. has a option to convert to ps3 in the menu
its free and very fast tool but can pixelise
on fast scenes.. hence wh I only use that for
some videos that dont need high quality
