Doomsday.Preppers.S01E09.HDTV.xvid-][ Close the Door, Load the Shotgun ][ 04-Apr-2012 ] avi

converted with the free tool avidemux.org 2.6 beta which handles mp4s ok
and does 2 pass
to xvid 640x352 mp3 audio

I notice the new xvid codec they use prevents my win7 showing a thumbnail
though. not sure why

anyhow checked it randomly.. crisp video and audio in sync

take it or leave it.. but SEED if grabbing!

enjoy

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
