Narratives:

Instantly, the vivid imagery in Night GenesÆ lyrics places you in a dismal folklore that is airy and carefree while also regal and tight. Keyboardist and vocalist Amy Foote levels the playing field when contrasted against IngersollÆs rich voice. ôIÆd Rather Feel Smallö is a blue grass-inspired track that drags the listener through swampy guitars. The up-tempo keys act like a floatation device and keeps your head above the murky depths.

Techies across the land can rejoice as ôCyber Meö comes buffering in with robotic feel because of the bass groove, yet IngersollÆs voice remains static and strong. In contrast to the previous two pieces, ôWoods Are Full Of Animalsö is a rage-filled narrative with ghastly opera-styled harmonies, and keys; itÆs like a fairytale gone horribly wrong.

The minimalistic song, ôLifeÆs Not Too Short,ö features elegant guitar and Ingersoll sounding like heÆs just speaking his mind. Even when FooteÆs vocal section comes in, it isnÆt whining gibberish but well-sung lyrics that fits with Ingersoll like a glove. The finale, ôImpression: Flood,ö is a number that sweeps the listener off their feet, and although itÆs the shortest track, it stuck with me longer than the others did.

Like The Blood is an interesting collection of songs that will either satisfy or disappoint, with this release there is a very thin middle ground. At best, even if youÆre not an avid fan of folk, one can appreciate the skillful songwriting featured on the release.
