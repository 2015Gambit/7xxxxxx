,theeccentrik,2012-04-18T21:43Z,"2nd Avast i've DL'd from PB this month only to get "" Attention, you are using avast with an illegal/copied license file"".
Been using PB avast torrents for years so they must have new security measures to block keys.

Thanks anyway."
,umim6,2012-04-18T22:54Z,"Using ""license"" will last only a while. Look for crack."

,gadget699,2012-05-01T16:01Z,"hi Prestoboy67,
can u pls asist im getin popup menu that im using pirated (stolen) copy every now and then, what should i do guys, any help, i have downloaded bitdefender 2012 and it was wiping all my torrents especially the cracked files, i removed it and re-installed avast again, once it updates itself then it pops up again....any help pls?????"
,theeccentrik,2012-05-02T06:58Z,"It's defo something linked to the IP address as i've tried 15 different licenses and get 20mins out of them before the illegal pop-up. Incidentally the pop-up takes you to the avast site offering the real avast for $19 telling you "" to do the right thing "" lmao
Back to norton.

CUNTZ!"
,Prestoboy67,2012-05-02T11:20Z,"well guys, i've tested it. and yes i also do get the popups once every time i startup my laptop. All scanner and protection still works. I dont really know how to fix this situation but im just ignoring it. Come on, its pirated. How perfect can it get right ? hehehe"

,foivossaint,2012-05-27T20:24Z,very good work!!!! the only problem is  when i try to give the license. It's said that has expired but it has the fee until 10/2013. but no other problem. thr scanning is ok and the update too. thanks!!!!!!!!
,Vicpdx192,2012-05-28T00:56Z,Even though this gives problems license wise It does work on Windows 8 consumer preview 64-bit 
,Johnny5PR,2012-05-30T04:36Z,"To stop the warning issue:
Open the firewall, go to the application rules section and block all connections of avast antivirus.  Then, open community tab in the settings menu and uncheck all.
Hope it works for you like it does for me..."
,Pakis64,2012-05-31T01:12Z,license has been blocked!!!! 
,Prestoboy67,2012-06-10T06:33Z,"I repeat what i wrote --> well guys, i've tested it. and yes i also do get the popups once every time i startup my laptop. All scanner and protection still works.
