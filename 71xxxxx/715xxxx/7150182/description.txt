"Uneasy lies the head..." Young King Mikeli of Tsaia, having survived several attempts on his life, now faces potential dangers from abroad as well as continued threats within his own kingdom. Though he has granted Dorrin Verrakai the title of Duke, everything in his past warns him not to trust a Verrakai magelord...and yet she is the only lord with military experience. The mysterious crown she brought him as a gift may instead be a curse. King Kieri of Lyonya, older and more experienced in war, is pressured to find a wife and produce an heir, while his subjects ignore what he sees as greater problems--the relationship between elves and humans, in this dual-ruled kingdom, had worsened and his own elven grandmother will not help him heal it, the economy is failing, and across the great river looms Pargun, a constant threat. King Torfinn of Pargun is beset by both traitorous relatives who want to usurp his throne and a rebellious daughter who wants to escape the duties of a princess. And now Lyonya--which he has not perceived as a threat before--has as its new king the duke who had fought and defeated Pargunese troops in Tsaia. With enemies on two sides, west and south, as well as conspiracies and treason within, what can he do to protect his people?
