Hot Space is the tenth studio album by British rock band Queen, released in May 1982. Marking a notable shift in direction from their earlier work, the band employed many elements of disco, pop music, R&B and dance music on the album, being partially influenced by the success of their 1980 hit "Another One Bites the Dust". This made the album less popular with fans who preferred the traditional rock style they had come to associate with the band.
