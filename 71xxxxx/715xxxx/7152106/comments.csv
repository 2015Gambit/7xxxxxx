,Shutupalready,2012-04-02T05:17Z,"""SEED THIS"" ""SEED THAT"" that's all I fucking hear, you all are selfish ignorant kids who probably just stop seeding the second they download it, but always request for other people to seed themselves."

,botcrawl,2012-04-02T07:14Z,"This is so slow I can not wait 8 minutes. WTF is your problem ETTV? I hate you so much, ruined my day because I have to wait somewhere around 8 minutes instead of 7 for this to download. Life is ruined, there is nothing to live for. I am going to write 298924 blogs about it and a mail a few letters to neighbors from the post office.
What is everyone's problemo... fucking SEED
It's everyone's fault. SEED damnit, 8 minutes is a lifetime. Where is my iPad? I want to watch this on my iPad made in a sweatshop by Foxconn employees while drinking a plastic cup full of iced water that has been sitting out for nearly 30 minutes."
,botcrawl,2012-04-02T07:15Z,"Just get a DIVX codec or AC3 if you have probs, all other codecs are meaningless spam junk."
,leif7385,2012-04-02T07:24Z,wtf is going on here? this download has not budged from 0% in the last 3 hours...anything else I download right now comes in at 1 mb/s
