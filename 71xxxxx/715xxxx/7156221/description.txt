"Safety in Numbers"

When Jack comes in contact with a 
homeless man who possesses the same 
obsession with numbers as Jake, he 
sets out on a series of seemingly 
unrelated tasks that connect an 
abused African woman, a group of 
African boys entering a dance 
competition and an outgoing woman 
at California's famed Coachella 
Valley Music and Arts Festival. 
Meanwhile, Teller (guest star 
Danny Glover) pays a visit to Jake's 
board-and-care facility and emotions 
run high for Clea.
