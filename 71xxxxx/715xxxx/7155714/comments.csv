,DanoSutts,2012-04-03T10:42Z,your the man gaz !!
,djt067,2012-04-03T11:27Z,"thx Gaz, nobody seeding though....."
,edmtunes,2012-04-03T11:33Z,"thanks gaz!
any other good english shows around?"
,djt067,2012-04-03T11:45Z,"Well done seeders, I will seed as soon as I download for sure..."
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-03T12:14Z,"@edmtunes- Not sure mate. But if you or anyone else have any requests (weekly shows, not daily!), I'll see what I can do :)"
,Raggyman1,2012-04-03T19:06Z,"What shows did you want... can do some of the day time ones if you want.. not sure how long can do it for, but can try.. 

Sorry Gaz, didn't realise you were uploading Made in Chelsea.. before i put my cap up. "
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-03T19:29Z,"@Raggyman1- Mate, there is no need to be sorry. You have actually taken the time to do a cap! I get my uploads from another source! Also, 2 MIC torrents available on Pirate Bay is better than none :)
The reason I don't want to put daily shows up is, if you miss one or two, people can get upset, and rightfully so! So, I don't commit!"
,Raggyman1,2012-04-03T21:28Z,"Gaz : Yeah, depends if it is a series or not I guess... Think will just put stuff up and see if people want it.. definitely couldn't commit to doing it long term that is for sure.

Yeah, will try and put up the episodes as we go, first time doing it, so still working out quick ways to do it, but think have it sorted now.. Hopefully it is ok for everyone else who gets them.. "
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-03T23:34Z,"Good work mate. Trial and Error is the only way to learn. And seeing how so many people have downloaded your very first cap and not one complaint, means you have done something right! Although, it would be nice to get a ""Thank You"" or 2! They will come though mate. You have my full support :)"
,Raggyman1,2012-04-04T12:58Z,"edmtunes : Which shows were you after mate... Let us know and I can see what I can get together for you.. 

Struggling, but thinking maybe Jeremy Kyle?  :)"
,djt067,2012-04-04T13:22Z,"jimmy carr on a fri nite is funny, so is jonathon ross.....enjoy...."
,Astro-F,2012-04-04T13:29Z,Thanks for this! Just wondering if you're able to capture Live in Chelsea from 4oD? It won't let me watch it here in Australia.
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-04T13:46Z,"I can't get it either coz I'm in Australia too! Maybe Raggyman1 can? I tried to find it before, but no luck :("
,Raggyman1,2012-04-04T19:12Z,"You could watch it by setting using a proxy...

http://proxy-ip-list.com/free-uk-proxy-list.html

Will see if I can get the 4oD stuff for ya's..

Australian here too, but stuck in this place for now.. "
,Raggyman1,2012-04-04T22:33Z,"OK, have put up Live in Chelsea after I figured out how to do it.. 

Apologise now if it contains ads.. but haven't had time to watch it through.. "
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-05T10:40Z,"Mate, you inspired me to try this myself!
I hope you are not offended by me uploading my own version of Live In Chelsea. I think we both have the same goal. To get people TV shows they love!! The Proxy Settings were a great help!! :)"
,Raggyman1,2012-04-05T14:34Z,"Sweet... yeah use to get all my aussie stuff through downundertv but those guys just seemed to ban me, because i disagreed with the ratio system.  Anyhow, talk about a bunch of idiots, cause use to share loads of the older stuff.  Anyhow, thought, why not give it a go.. Most of it is on here anyhow... which is good. "
,sugar-pie,2012-06-05T14:11Z,Thank you for this season :) You rock!
