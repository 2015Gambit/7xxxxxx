,scooter83,2012-04-02T06:15Z,WTF... how are there not more seeders after an hour?!?!?! Bunch of mofos aren't seeding properly... It only takes like 20 min to download new walking dead shows after an hour of seeding with these ratios

,jrkbabe,2012-04-02T06:37Z,Seed people......some greedy people out there. 
,gacgirl,2012-04-02T06:42Z,How about labeling it properly?! Ugh... Spent a good hour downloading only to find its an mp4 format. Thanks for nothing. /pissed
,jump655,2012-04-02T06:45Z,"This is a RAR file that requires you to jump through crazy hoops to get the 'password'. Waste of time, don't download"
,Polymathj,2012-04-02T06:59Z,"Eztv is dropping the ball.  Using the extra (and superfluous) step of raring files and switching between formats and now using 3gp... Really?

If I didn't have a life, I'd show all these green skulls how to stand out by blending in.  Just doing an efficient job by using standard formats playable on all devices."
,nobudz1981,2012-04-02T07:12Z,i just dl so far it's real...can't to watch it i 
,0qubit1,2012-04-02T07:21Z,"hmm well i was going to dl since it's from eztv, but some commenters say it's fake? I guess even eztv has turned into a douchebag profiteer, huh?"
,peacetin,2012-04-02T07:28Z,EZTV is always real.  Idiots.
,Ivan4ik,2012-04-02T07:33Z,It's April Fools. So eztv is trolling
,Alexthex,2012-04-02T07:33Z,"Y U no look at the file before believing the douches who says it's rar?

It's a perfectly working copy! Watching right now!!!"
,new_wave_prom_81,2012-04-02T07:34Z,This may NOT be Eztv as I had problems trusting a Eztv before. Unsure which one is real. 
,3P1CSL4Y3R,2012-04-02T07:34Z,"It's not a .rar file and thats pretty obvious once you start to dl. And complaining about it being in .mp4 format is just fucking retarded.

""not sure if troll or just stupid""

I'll comment again once dl is finished."
,Valeran42,2012-04-02T07:39Z,"This is legit.

-No rar, no password, just the mp4.
-Not a .3pg file, that's a different upload.
-This is an .mp4 file, which has been the standard for uploaded goods for months now. (Not just an eztv thing, but all groups follow use it now.) If you cannot play mp4s, you are the issue, as it is a much better file type. (AVI is shit, think otherwise? look it up, you're wrong.)
-If you're dumb enough to let it download without knowing what kind of file it is, that's your fault, since any decent torrent program tells you what's in it."

,fejop,2012-04-02T07:53Z,"@At you dumbfucks complaining. It CLEARLY said RM in the title so don't act surprised when it's 3GP once downloaded. 

Thanks for effort, even though I chose to download in another format."
,dududus,2012-04-02T07:57Z,"Dudes, f you see a skull next to the uploaders name, it;s guaranteed to be real!"
,dududus,2012-04-02T07:59Z,"@Fejop

YOU are the dumbfuck. Both this very page (next to 'files') and utorrent say it is MP4 even before its downloaded!!"
,Requiem_Fear,2012-04-02T08:08Z,Great quality. Thanks for the upload. Seeding for now.
,biosteel,2012-04-02T08:08Z,"Watching now, V10 A10. Thank you for seeding!"
,TheSageM,2012-04-02T08:25Z,Love you EZTV!
,peculium,2012-04-02T08:46Z,"Don't believe all these trolls! The file is just fine, no passwords. I was hesitant to the switch to .mp4 at first, but the files work just fine and you get them smaller with the same quality.

Good work eztv!"

,Ukall,2012-04-02T10:35Z,"Why eztv is putting his files on .mp4 instead of .avi?
Same quality occuping less space, is that the reason?"
,Ukall,2012-04-02T10:37Z,"Why eztv is putting his files on .mp4 instead of .avi?
Does it have the same quality of .avi?"

Perfect Video..

Yes it is .mp4. If you burn to cd to play on an avi player it may not work, that's your problem. Play it on your compunter then, use VLC...Or hook your computer up to your TV via HDMI...

THanks eztv...  Always awesome shows in major clarity. Appreciate your work."

A 0.76/0.765
V 27.3002119/27.3002119

As you can see it has great video because it maxed out. Thank you for the movie of Game of Thrones EZTV what does EZ stand for?"

I have Imtoo Video Converter Ultimate."

,Tinny_pb,2012-04-14T03:35Z,"Sulibaba: It depends entirely on your DVD player. You'll need to use ImTOO to convert the download to a format your DVD player will play. At a guess, I'd say you'll need to convert to DivX or VCD."
