,powers987,2012-04-02T05:51Z,"When I try to download this, it gives me zero data about file size, file names, etc. Am I doing something wrong? This has never happened before..."
,Munchkinpuncher,2012-04-02T06:15Z,Thanks a bunch!!
,meeped,2012-04-02T06:19Z,"magnet links take a sec to show up, 
if you arent familiar with them:
go to ui settings (i'll presume you are using utorrent)
untick the box 'show a window that display the files inside the torrent'
this caused me a problem before where nothing was being saved into the selected directory."
,Thor-csf,2012-04-02T06:19Z,"@powers987
It happens with magnets links. You will only see the data after you start the download."

,Skale89,2012-04-02T06:47Z,"It's a .3gp???? WTF, I'm not downloading this."
,dwb1729,2012-04-02T06:50Z,"THIS FILE HAS A .3GP EXTENSION.

THIS IS AN APRIL FOOL'S JOKE.

CHANGE THE EXTENSION TO .MKV AND IT WILL WORK FINE.

Luckily there are a lot of other good uploaders. No need to ever use this guy again :)"

,scooter1944,2012-04-02T07:33Z,Awesome share from eztv - AS USUAL!!!!!!!
,hmathews8,2012-04-02T07:36Z,"Just finished downloading, although the speed was pretty slow. I'll make sure to seed for you guys.

The .3gp is just a joke. Make sure you have Windows set to show file extensions, then just rename the .3gp to .mkv and you're good to go."
,.Leto.,2012-04-02T08:47Z,"I'm downloading this at 2.5Mb/s ... from rutracker*org :)
In case you don't know rutracker is the best and fastest torrent site in the world. Even if it's a russian site most movies/tv series have english audio/subtitles."
,Tombosaurus,2012-04-02T09:28Z,Thank you very much!!
[T],Gondy10,2012-04-02T09:50Z,"Seeded 3x, im done ;)"
,KarpoofdaJulii,2012-04-02T09:51Z,The file extension is an April Fool's joke. Just change it to .mkv and it should work fine. If you can't change it than go to Control Panel > Folder Options and unclick the box that says 'Hide extensions for known file types'.
,barometerrising,2012-04-02T09:56Z,Many thanks!
