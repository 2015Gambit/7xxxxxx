Final upload off the Humble Bundle for Android[Will upload PC version next]

Desc from Zen Bound site:

The official sequel to the multiple award winning iPhone game is now available on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, PC and Mac.

Zen Bound 2 is a meditative puzzle game of wrapping rope around wooden sculptures. It is a tactile game, with a focus on making wood and stone look and feel real and believable.

The highlights of Zen Bound 2 are its controls and its atmosphere. The game teakes full advantage of tilt and multi-touch and feels natural and comfortable to play. The dusty and soothing atmosphere is a combination of beautiful visuals and a unique soundtrack by 'Ghost Monkey'.
