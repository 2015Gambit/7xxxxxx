"Blowing the Whistle"

The team treats an Army veteran 
charged with treason after he leaked 
classified information. But the 
patient's life is put at risk when he 
refuses treatment unless he and his 
brother are given information about 
their late father, a war veteran, 
which raises questions about loyalty 
to one's family and country. 
Meanwhile, Adams suspects House may 
be sick, so she recruits Wilson and 
the other team members to plan an 
intervention and investigate his 
illness.
