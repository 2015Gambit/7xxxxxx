I followed your instructions, disconnected from the internet entered the name and license key but when I click register it says ""Failed to connect to Network"" and won't let it register. If I try to unblock internet access to register the program only, it says the information is invalid. Any ideas or suggestions to fix this? Thanks for any help you can provide."
