Disasters At Sea: Why Ships Sink 
To mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, this documentary examines the disaster and asks why maritime catastrophes still occur. The programme assesses the design and construction weaknesses and human errors that can contribute to the sinking of ships, and reports on the Costa Concordia, which ran aground off the coast of Tuscany in January.
