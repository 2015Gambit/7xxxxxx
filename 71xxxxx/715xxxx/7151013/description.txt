The Heart of the Matter

Classic from 1953 by Graham Greene in mkv-format

The Heart of the Matter does what great adaptations of great books manage to do best.  It follows the plot, does a great job with the casting and manages to find ways to make the narrative come to life.  Ostensibly, this is the story of Major Scobie, a police inspector in WWII Africa who has an affair while his wife is also having an affair and tries to make the best of the situation.  But thatΓÇÖs just plot.  That doesnΓÇÖt give you any idea of the depth of the character of Major Scobie or the guilt that ravages his soul, for this is a film (and novel) about Catholicism and all the pain and guilt and burden that come along with it.
