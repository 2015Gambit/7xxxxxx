could you please tell me where you got this from? And if you have any more episodes would you be so kind as to upload them or to send them in any way? I really really love the neistat brothers, I have have watched all their content I could possibly find on the internet but episode 3-8 are nowhere to find...

thanks in advance,

,alexbiggs,2012-06-13T21:33Z,Dear Contull I have recently become a fan of the neistat brothers but I cant afford hbo so I can watch them online and the torrents of their eppisodes are nowhere to be found. I would really really appreciate it if you uploaded the rest of the series. Thank you.
