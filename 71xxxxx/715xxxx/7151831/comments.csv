Seed it and discover the mystery."

You could at least put all the files with the same quality/format =(

For those who wants all files with same quality look into:

They are split episode by episode though."
,freetothink,2012-04-03T03:57Z,"@misakimei  Did the best I could with the files I had access to. 

I thought people might be grateful to get them all in one torrent instead scrabbling around for each individual episode.

Guess I was wrong about that."

No drama. I was so grateful that I am trying to help seed even though I already have the full serie. But 0 seeds now =T"

Guess that's why they're called leechers.
