Bugis street - 1995 Singaporean film about an innocent 15 year old girl from Malacca who comes to Singapore to work in a Hotel full of some not so innocent people.


IMDB Review: 
Definitely different tale of coming of age, for a waif from the countryside (played well by Hiep Thi Le), now living in the city. A "House of Prostitution" to be exact, where the service folks are transvestites, and the clientele, predominately US military types on "R&R" from Vietnam. If you can make it over that knoll, there are some very humorous observations and some fine dramatic vignettes here to be gleaned. Lian, the country girl grows up around the daily workings, and makes friends with most of the residents. The inter-action and if you will, mentoring, that takes place is basically the crux of the film. If you've a daring nature and care for something out of the ordinary, give this film from Singapore a peek. Recommended.
