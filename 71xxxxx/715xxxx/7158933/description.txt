ESET SysRescue CD 01.04.2012 Update 7018 (ISO)

Here's newly updated ESET SysRescue CD on 01.04.2012. Don't think about the date because you might think this post is a joke however it's not :) Don't hesitate to get this file. ESET SysRescue CD is a must-have for PC users.

Requirements
OS : Windows XP/Vista/Seven (x86/x64)
Requirement: more than 576 MB of RAM installed on target computer, CD drive
Recommendation : Burn the ISO image at low speed (8x if available)

The main advantage of ESET SysRescue is the fact that it runs independent of the host operating system, while it has a direct access to the disk and the entire filesystem. Thanks to this it is possible to remove those infiltrations that normally could not be deleted, e.g. when the operating system is running, etc. Scanning speed is pretty fast compared to other rescue disks. The scan is very thorough as it tries to scan files inside compressed archive and also in setup installers.
