Thank you to the people who made this happen!  This is an awesome book.  I hope one day to be able to afford a real copy."
,Nihility1,2012-04-04T05:48Z,anyone able to get this working on iPad?  Cant seem to get them to load after putting them in ibooks.
,throwaway04040,2012-04-04T06:28Z,"This is a Great, Legit, Clear copy!  I never post on TPB, but I have been looking for this for a while.

No comment on the iPad.  Works great in Preview on OSX.   Just wanted to add that the torrent has been OCR'd. (i.e. searchable text)  Thanks again for the compute power and time guys!"
,creamoner,2012-04-05T05:20Z,"@Nihility1:  I am just starting this download myself, so I can not speak for this particular download.  However, I recommend trying ""good reader"" for iPad.  I have a lot of large books, over 500MB (mostly textbooks) that will not open in ibooks, goodreader handles them without a problem on my iPad.  

The app can do a bunch of other things that ibooks can not do, as well, like cropping, notation, connect to servers and dropbox.  

With all the iOS apps out there, I know it helps some times to get a good recommendation.  The app works really well.   "

Wish I had the $600 but I don't so I'm so grateful to the uploader. Sharing with my son, the scientist."
