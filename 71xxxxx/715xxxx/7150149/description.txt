In the process, the files are encoded, i.e. converted into a format that the 
computer can read. The Audio CD can be automatically identified with Gracenote. 
So called metadata such as title, genre, and track title are accessed by the 
Gracenote Media Database and associated to the tracks. That way you have audio
