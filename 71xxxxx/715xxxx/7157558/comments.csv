,nehamm,2012-04-04T00:33Z,Really appreciate the upload but it is so big and slow. Would love to watch the game sooner.
[V],spastik64,2012-04-04T03:28Z,Top 720p quality ( +7k bitrate) requires large file size.
,felipon,2012-04-04T04:10Z,"I can't even see 1 seeder in the peer-list WTF!
I'm still gonna wait for it and seed, but your bandwich must be really shitty and slow Mr spastik64 "

Dude, don't misunderstand me.
I appreciate the UL as hell, but 256 kb/s up IS slow."
[V],spastik64,2012-04-05T00:54Z,"Now seeded enjoy MB/s downloading speed.

@felipon
