,vladqui,2012-05-04T16:59Z,"Hello mdusanjay, thanks for your uploads. 
I have seen the same comment on every previous version of Xara Web Designer:  The Template Pack cannot be installed, with a final message that says the Software must be unlocked before installing the templates.  
It does not matter  the crack has worked fine, and the program appears as 'registered'.
Is there a way around this limitation?
An additional crack?  A pre-installed or cracked Template-Pack?"
,DickMellon,2012-05-23T08:36Z,"Yes, you are all correct. We have seen this problem before.  The guys over at TorrentDay have gotten it right with the previous versions but I have not seen this latest version up at that site yet."
