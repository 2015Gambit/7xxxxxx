note some called this SEASON 2 or S02E00 or S02E01

and added it on the end of Season 1

so it could be called how I did it or even S01SP01 or even S02E00

[via press release from Travel Channel]

TRAVEL CHANNEL JOURNEYS BACK TO THE DARK SIDE WITH SEASON TWO OF THE INVESTIGATIVE SERIES ""THE DEAD FILES""

Gripping New Season Kicks Off With an Unforgettable Special Investigation of The Infamous Lizzie Borden House

Season Premieres on Friday, April 20 at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT

CHEVY CHASE, MD (April 2, 2012) - Travel Channel brings back an all-new season of its compelling one-hour paranormal investigative series ""The Dead Files,"" featuring retired NYPD Homicide Detective Steve DiSchiavi and medium Amy Allan as they travel throughout the country to uncover the unexplained disturbances in each locale. The new thirteen-episode season kicks off on Friday, April 20 at 10:00 p.m., ET/PT with a special one hour investigation of the notorious Lizzie Borden House, and once again, pairs the no-nonsense detective, who investigates physical evidence, with the gifted medium, who channels the dead. They explore each crime scene separately from each other, joining together only at the end to compare notes and deliver some startling results to the homeowner.

Season two premieres with an astonishing examination of the Lizzie Borden House in Massachusetts - a residence made infamous by the vicious, gruesome and still-unsolved murders that occurred there back in 1892. Now an inn, frightening new claims of violent attacks and ominous apparitions propel Allan and DiSchiavi into a disturbing investigation as they attempt to unravel the mystery and paranormal activity that has plagued this spot for generations. While Allan is eager to push the limits of her unique powers, DiSchiavi digs deeper into the facts, legends and lies surrounding the house. Their unsettling findings shock the inn's owner as they uncover a bizarre new twist to a century-old murder mystery."
