The.Dead.Files.S01E09_SP01.MQwebrip.xvid-][ Alcatraz Special with Paranormal Medium(Extended Recap only+Extras)][26-Mar-2012] avi

I captured some web stream clips to rebuild this missing episode
however its not the full episode its just some of the best bits
and summary I could source and joined them together to
make the episode flow in rough order it should be with some editing.
for some reason clips had slight different volumes

at least you can get to watch 14min of the 44 episode plus ive added
some 3 minutes of extras about the medium on the end

take it or leave it.. but if grabbing help seed it PLEASE

enjoy

note some called this SEASON 2 or S02R00 or S02E01

but its really a Special and most tvguide list it in between seasons
and added on end of Season 1

so it could be call how I did it or even S01SP01 or even S02E00
beats me.. whatever :)
