Roland Emmerich (Stargate, Independence Day, and Godzilla) brings you John Rhys-Davies in a Monty Pythonesque tale of a band of Crusaders who find themselves in possession of an Alien ship and the Alien to pilot it. Armed with the means to conquer the Holy Land the naive Crusaders set off for a grand crusade only to find themselves not in Jerusalem but at the mercy of an entire alien world....heaven help the Aliens.
