Description:

It all started, not with a bang, but with a whimper... Times are good. The Soviet Union has crumbled and the old enemies are long gone. Regions and states that were flashpoints, like Libya, the Middle East and Africa are quieter than at perhaps any time in their histories. It hardly makes sense to maintain a large standing army anymore. So, responding to popular demand, politicians begin reducing military outlays and start automating their defences. In order to keep dictators and terrorists from taking advantage of the situation, all tactical planning in each region has been given over to a computer. The system has direct command and control over the remaining troops and automatically controlled weaponry (such as the missile silos). Budding conflicts can even be solved by the computer alone, but some still require a human touch.
