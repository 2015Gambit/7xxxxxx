[H],NZPirate,2012-04-04T10:13Z,Cheers
,heavydiamond,2012-04-04T10:50Z,yeah this is a older film but still worth a watch
[H],NZPirate,2012-04-04T11:20Z,2005 film...Why label it 2012? WTF up with that uploader? smoking crack or something?
,joegreg13,2012-04-04T13:39Z,Yeah the cover pic is not the same movie. I checked that movie . If it is a older movie and it is wrong for sure. Black 2012 is a hindi movie that just came out on dvd this month. I wanted to see it until I found it about it is a hindi movie 
,Stealthdevil666,2012-04-04T14:35Z,"The original is 2009, I think It's being re-released this year (2012) having been dubbed in English"
