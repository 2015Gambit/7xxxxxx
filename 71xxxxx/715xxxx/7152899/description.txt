Words of Captain Scott 
Dramatised documentary which uses readings from the diaries and letters of Captain Scott, his companions, and those of his Norwegian rival Roald Amundsen to tell the story of their epic South Pole expeditions. Beginning in 1910 with imperial fanfare, Scott's Antarctic expedition ended with his death and that of his three companions in a freezing storm-bound tent in March 1912. Despite being beaten by Amundsen to the Pole by just one month, their courage and endurance in the face of appalling conditions became legendary. One hundred years on, this film retells their story with the help of new information and in the light of modern medical knowledge. With Dougray Scott in the title role, and also featuring Alistair McGowan, Max Irons, Lars Mikkelsen, Julian Ovenden, Charlotte Riley and Leo Bill.
