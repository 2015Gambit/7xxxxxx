,babybluetits24,2012-04-03T18:37Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2112281/ imdb score 8.0/10 thanks
Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 0 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc"
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-04-03T20:31Z,Even though it's just 6 minutes I laughed so hard lol
,muLineZu,2012-04-04T02:07Z,"Thanks, it's a funny short movie, but BRRip? Somehow I doubt it; who would buy a 6 minutes blu-ray? If you'd say it's a bonus movie on a BD, I'll buy that, but if someone would try to say that will be screened, or sold as a full BD, this I won't buy. Even the rip (the technical info is accurate) doesn't look nothing as a BDRip @ over 6,000 Kb/s, even encoded with XviD... and if it would be a BD, than the sound should be DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, and who rip it to mp3 @128 Kb/s - 2 channels? And... there might be other questions, but I'll stop here..."

,powcub,2012-05-05T11:11Z,Only 6 min movie.
,coleFACTOR,2012-06-09T03:38Z,"If your coming into this, not knowing it's a short, than why are you even here. I'd rather take the time to download, than pay whoever for this measly 6 min short. Thank you HeroMaster."
,dream2160,2012-06-25T11:04Z,"the first movie is awesome. they totally should make a sequel, not just a short vid. hilarious but just too short"
