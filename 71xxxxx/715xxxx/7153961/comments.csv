,FTArrow,2012-04-15T22:38Z,"djj just mad :P

Is there a chance you could upload a x64 one?"
,FTArrow,2012-06-28T21:42Z,"@Djj

You like stalking Thumper do you.  This isn't the first time I've seen you accuse him of ""copying""."
,Sen4lifE,2012-09-13T12:08Z,"Djjlicious updated his torrent four days before ThumperTM.  The description is nearly identical with an added pre- and suffix to the paragraphs.

The torrent name is nearly identical.

The files are identical.

Face it.  Evidence shows that beyond and /REASONABLE/ doubt that this is a copy.  Getting your nose more brown by pushing it up Thumper's ass will not change that.  The date is the most undeniable proof."
