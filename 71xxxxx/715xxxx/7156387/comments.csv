,pahavanja,2012-08-07T20:26Z,The game starts but when i get to the menu after a few secs the screen gets all flashy and twitchy and the cursor starts leaving these traces like black squares and shit. And while in game the menu bar below does the same crap flashing thing all the time. I'm using win7. Tried all the compaty stuff and everything but still this goes on. like wtf?
