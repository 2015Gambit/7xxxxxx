,.CyberPunk.,2012-04-04T08:40Z,".Bone. Thank you for your time and effort. I downloaded this, as I have a few skulls on here I go with. You, froggie, and a couple others. I trust and respect that you put up the best quality available at the time.

Do they not have decent Sony HD camcorders in the countries these cams and TS's are recorded in? cmon, it is 2012, I could go get a HD cam for $998 and have quality 4x as good. Not trying to offend, but I don't get what gives. The cams and ts's are recorded with either 10 year old cameras, or cheap $100 cameras.. I dunno, just something I have been wondering, again not trying to bash lol.

Anyways, I stopped watching after 15 mins to see if I could find another source, I didn't notice in your info about the 3d thing, however I did skim through your info at the video source where you lay out the specs. I didn't notice where you said 3d source, it was kind of hidden :/

It would be extremely helpful if you guys (the skull uploaders we all love) would make it more clear when a 3D source was used. I dunno, put it in the title, or at the top of the info, or where you put this:

Sources......: Vid - ILLUM, Russian, P76/INSPiRAL

make it like

Sources......: Vid - ILLUM (3D), Russian, P76/INSPiRAL

Or a notice on the first line that it was a 3D video source.

In the dark, on a 50"" tv, trying to watch a CAM or TS that has a 3D video source will give you a migraine!

I understand, it just came out, take what you can get. I don't mind watching ""DECENT"" cam and TS copies, with it being 2012 they all should be moderately watchable. I say we donate some HD cams to those who have the balls to go record the movies for us, some of them need an upgrade.

But really, the 3d thing not knowing it was a 3d video source is annoying already. I feel I am speaking for a bunch of people when I say, please make it more clear in the info or title that its a 3d video source.

I remember back when Happy Feet 2 came out, I downloaded like 6 different TS copies.. ALL of them were from a 3D video source.. I don't think ANY of the infos said they were 3D!!!

Thank you Bone, I appreciate the upload. After checking, there isn't a better source out at this time, so I will finish watching the movie now. However, if I would have known this, I would have double checked the available torrents to make a more educated decision before downloading 1.3GB, transferring it to my flashdrive, and watching it on my xbox... Damn, I am glad I don't burn them anymore :) haha

Note to the people: At this time, this is the best copy around I am aware of. It is decent, but not the best TS. Watchable, but I think ""some"" of the sources are from a 3D source. I don't thing the entire movie is 3d..? Download this one, from our homie Bone."

,maxmaxpayne,2012-04-04T13:04Z,Thanks to all the people involved in putting this together
,Creyz1,2012-04-04T13:56Z,"@ CyberPunk, I am sure they will get some good corders if you wire them that 1000 dollar. Seriously, you get stuff for free but complain they dont spend 1000 dollar on equipment?
 I'd advice to be patient and wait for a decent r5 or dvdrip OR buy such expensive equipment and go record movies yourself."
,micdirector,2012-04-04T16:03Z,@ cyberpunk you my friend need a program called tversity for ure streaming movies and music str8 to ure xbox :) its very good too it doesnt use any of the cpu and you can have music streaming whilst gaming too :) enjoy.

Makes you wish the VHS was back....wait for a better version unless you're willing to suffer"
[V],.BONE.,2012-04-04T23:40Z,@.CyberPunk. if you can get a hd cam 4 $998 and think you can do a better job of risking your neck bigtime then go right ahead.. or you could save $980 and go the fucking cinema films like this are worth paying for at cinema BONE! went :)
,skuzbucket,2012-04-16T22:07Z,"Its another crap quality cam.

Audio was not good - the background music was more prominent than the actors voices, making it difficult to make out what was said

Video was constantly going in and out of focus, and was grainy for the most part. Annoying arabic subs.

A - 3
V - 3
M - 5

Why do people bother uploading shite like this?"
,SockandShoe,2012-05-06T00:45Z,"There's no arabic subs, no subs of any sort. The video quality is pretty bad, probably because it's in 3d so it keeps going blurry, but the audio is just fine. Compared to the other uploads on here this is probably your best bet til someone gets a DVD rip.
