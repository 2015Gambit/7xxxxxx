,inside83,2012-04-09T23:11Z,why is it on PB when anyone can download it free from Google Play?
,GrandTheftAutoV,2012-04-10T14:12Z,"@inside83 - It is on PB for people like me that have a rooted phone with custom Firmware. Google Play store doesn't show this app on my device and says it is 'incompatible' yet it works fine.

,j_pedro,2012-04-21T12:30Z,"^ What he said. I have Nokia N8 and that stupid google plus program tells you that it should be in that ""white briefcase"" (store). So I go into the store on my phone and nothing about Instragram is in there! Okay, so I go on the net looking for the dl link and guess what - you have to sign into google OR sign into facebook to get it! All I fucking want is the EXE file or program so I can put it into my phone and then run the program normally! Inside83, you're an idiot. Go post stupid questions else where."
,j_pedro,2012-04-23T16:30Z,I must say that this app doesn't work on the Nokia N8 as it is a Symbian phone. Word.
