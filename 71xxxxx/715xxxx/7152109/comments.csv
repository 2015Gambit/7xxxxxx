,Valamyr82,2012-04-02T04:35Z,"Somethings off, how can there be so many seeds 30 mins in, and still be so slow?"
,jedokahn,2012-04-02T04:45Z,omg seed!!!!
,plxseedz,2012-04-02T04:47Z,"plz stop capping dl speed....

up: 300 kb/s

.... wtf"
[T],VixenofVenus,2012-04-02T04:49Z,"@Valamyr82

Because people like you are throttling your upload speed :P"
,thebeav111,2012-04-02T04:50Z,"I agree Valamyr, something's off"
,plxseedz,2012-04-02T04:50Z,Hooray Seeds!
,thebeav111,2012-04-02T04:52Z,"@Vixen, some of us are cursed with horrible ISP options that severely limit our upload speed"
,plxseedz,2012-04-02T04:54Z,stop throttling and we'll all get through this together!! I just wanna watch!! =(
,JacksonHerrer,2012-04-02T05:11Z,can someone confirm ?
,efrimb,2012-04-02T05:27Z,"@ Vixen. That is easier said than done. I have to cap my upload to 250 because beyond that all internet things become totally unusable on my end. 

I can barely even refresh pages at this point.

I'm sure I'm not alone. Depending on where you are, ISP's are dicks."
,LackThereof,2012-04-02T05:28Z,"Good torrent, thanks for the quick up.

Yes, most of the seeds are bogus, but that's pretty much par for the course for popular torrents on public trackers.  There's enough real seeds to keep things chugging along, and the speed just keeps going up.  "
,Hancock79,2012-04-02T05:42Z,if you don't raise your upload speed your download speed will be slow you dumb motherfuckers.  help us help you
,jnbradi,2012-04-02T05:42Z,Seed to Peer ratio way off. Everyone's got too small a piece. Give it a bit should rebalance (if everyone SEEDs like good responsible priates should). I'll post if this is real!
,jnbradi,2012-04-02T05:44Z,Seed to Peer ratio way off. Everyone's got too small a piece. Give it a bit should rebalance (if everyone SEEDs like good responsible pirates should). I'll post if this is real!
,ezekiel_666x,2012-04-02T06:15Z,Incredible quality and great episode! Thanks!
,Libertas_Aeternae,2012-04-02T06:18Z,"Yup, it's real (and awesome). A10, V10, Show 10+.

First Real HD version on the bay. "
,raphael90,2012-04-02T06:49Z,"The number of connected seeds is very low, the upload speed is much larger than the download"
,CyberTootie,2012-04-02T07:54Z,"Great download, thanks for sharing so quickly!"
,BurferTheGreat,2012-04-02T08:29Z,Thanks DIBYA.  Look forward to your ups!
,BurferTheGreat,2012-04-02T08:31Z,...get peerblock AND ipfilter to weed out fakes and it downloads fine.
,.Leto.,2012-04-02T08:46Z,"I'm downloading this at 2.5Mb/s ... from rutracker*org :)
In case you don't know rutracker is the best and fastest torrent site in the world. Even if it's a russian site most movies/tv series have english audio/subtitles."
,bloodthirsty_pirate,2012-04-02T10:04Z,4MB piece size...
,Iamcorrupt,2012-04-02T23:32Z,Torrent looked and sounded great but hot damn took so long to dl.
,notgivingashit,2012-04-03T01:31Z,"WTF??? The mkv file contains country music and not the actual video???

What is going on? How can this be? Please somebody explain.

Are others experiencing the same bullshit???"
,notgivingashit,2012-04-03T01:35Z,"Sorry, disregard my previous comment. I don't know what the fuck was going on. 

The torrent is fine, A and V are a straight 10."
