Interplanetary War

The saga opens with a conquest fleet of aliens arriving on Earth at the time of World War II. These aliens have planned invasion for centuries, based on the findings of a probe that examined Earth at the time of the Middle Ages. "The Race" expected to find life and technology on Earth (to them known as Tosev 3) the same as when their probe found it, as the Race themselves develop very slowly. The first series deals with the war, diplomatic negotiations, and the establishment of Race control over most of the world.
