Lefties is a three part 2006 BBC documentary series investigating some aspects of the extreme Left of British politics in the 1970s.

The series was commissioned by the then Controller of BBC Four, Janice Hadlow. Lefties was produced as a companion series to Tory! Tory! Tory! an overview of the New Right and Thatcherism. Hadlow believed that so called 'serious television' was vital in driving ideas, and her commissions were a critical and ratings success.

1 - A Lot of Balls - The formation of the News on Sunday a left wing tabloid newspaper formed in 1987.

2 - Property is Theft - The non-conformist squatters living in South London in the 1970s.
