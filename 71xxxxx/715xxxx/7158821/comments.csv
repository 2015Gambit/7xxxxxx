,pjones452,2012-04-04T15:30Z,wow good work well done
,breaking.atoms,2012-04-04T19:26Z,Can I make a request? Would you please upload Fight Club with the same audio/video settings as are here? 
,breaking.atoms,2012-04-04T19:27Z,Or maybe even upload the whole blu-ray? That'd be awesome!
,BRAYHUNTER,2012-04-04T21:11Z,This is what i like. More bluray rips with uncompressed sound. I'm hoping one day I can ditch my Blockbuster Video monthly fee.
,marc_lucas,2012-04-05T16:06Z,I couldn't get this to play on PC or Sony BP player & at nearly 30GB it's a massive file
,niji666,2012-04-06T12:22Z,"I'm playing this through my PC on a Samsung 55"" 3d tv.  The picture is one of the best iv'e ever seen in years of DL movies However i'm getting an error message saying ""audio codec not found"" THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TORRENT!! My TV plays MKV files fine but i noticed something about the audio being 7.1? does anyone know how i can get the sound to play as i have not come across this before? Thanks in advance and Thanks to the uploader.

VIDEO 10/10 unbelievably good

AUDIO ?  will comment when i fix my problem"
,Startle,2012-04-06T18:16Z,"Amazing!
Much obliged!"
,monwentworth,2012-04-07T04:26Z,"@niji666
So you're playing the movie in your PC and have the PC connected through HDMI to your TV, is that correct? If so, which program are you using to play the movie? maybe the audio problem can be solved using another program, like VLC. "
,wazzup83,2012-04-24T01:35Z,don't limit the upload pls!
,Thx4allUrEffort,2012-04-29T20:19Z,Am getting at most 1% per hour and am on 20mb! I hope this is worth the effort. Unlike others I will seed.
,evilmonkey99,2012-05-03T22:36Z,"Ok. I just finished downloading this. It took me 3-4 weeks. FYI I play all my 1080p/720p movie downloads on VLC MEDIA PLAYER. I noticed that while watching this video, through scenes where images move real fast, i get a glitch. I'm going to try and change players to the Media Player Classic - Home Cinema (Windows 7 media player) and see if that helps it. Some movies play better with the Media Player Classic. it just all depends."
,d348,2012-05-03T23:06Z,"QUESTION
I`m trying to play this on my blu ray player (s380) using a external hard drive. It is fully capable of decoding truehd and dts MA. video plays fine however the trueHD audio is not supported (supposedly). Most if not all rips  ive downloaded containing DTSMA play audio perfectly. I`m not as fimilar with TrueHD seeing how it is less popular. I`ve downloaded sample trueHD samples to test but they are m2ts and they also play fine. Thoughts? 
THANKS IN ADVANCE."
,d348,2012-05-03T23:07Z,video plays fine however the trueHD audio is not supported (supposedly) on this mkv file****
,evilmonkey99,2012-05-04T04:19Z,"UPDATE: after haven watched this with VLC and tried to change over to Windows Media player - Cinema for windows 7 it actually lagged the audio or the video was way behind. either way, this video has problems. I did watch it from beginning to end in VLC media player, however, it has a lot of areas in the film where it glitches the video and you have to wait for it to fix itself. it's annoying because this happens many times in 30 sec to 1 minute intervals throughout the entire film.
PS: I have over 600 MKV and other high quality 1080p & 720p movies on several external hard drives of mine and I don't have the issues with any of the other ones that I am having with this file. Another side note, i have been playing this video from my C drive, so no reason to blame for running it from an external drive. My monitor is a 32"" Sony Bravia and my CPU is a core 2 duo with 4GB ram. i shut everything down and just played the video and it glitches through the entire film no matter what player i use. I even tried using The KM PLAYER and it was worse.
The quality of the film has bars on top and bottom. The quality is very good, but honestly i have seen the same quality from this video that I see from other downloaded 1080p movies that are 8-10gb."
,MoRggUeS,2012-05-07T05:16Z,"Well, I’m joining the fucking club here, I couldn’t play this file on my Blu-Ray Player,  I agree with the quality video “OUTSTANDING 10/10” but no signs of audio what so ever,  what the FUCK IS THIS !!! You uploaders really need to see what the hell you’re doing before uploading, this is a fucking 30 GB movie not just any file, it took time to download this crap, description is very important to avoid any situation, so if you have intentions of making a Blu-Ray RIP 100% playable in the computer, it’s fine with me, just… don’t be an Asshole and hold us back with that info."
,evilmonkey99,2012-05-09T08:00Z,audio and video do work using VLC MEDIA PLAYER. however there are a lot of glitches and freezes throughout the film as i've explained in my previous posts.

,bala_animation,2012-07-30T19:18Z,"Do you think just downloading a video file will play on your PC, DVD Player or Portable Harddisc, please read the torrent specification above before downloading

Kindly check the compatibility of TV ,Monitor, BDPlayer, portable harddisk or Network media player

Profile and Level used
Resolution
Container
Bitrate ( video & audio )
Frame rate
What type of Video Codec
What type of Audio Codec
Check 4CC
Bitrate transfer for Portable Harddisk
Version of HDMI

use Media info software to explore video files

Use VLC Media player or K-Lite Codec Pack for PC

Most Blueray DVD come in 60 frames per/ sec

Many video converting softwares use their own codec to encode and decode, so ther are a lot of difference which may not be compatibility

if Audio file is 5.1 or 7.1 stereo speakers or head phones want give a good output (low output or only voice)

so pls check before commenting, it is not the uploaders problem, it is your responsibility to check the compatibility

i wonder what will be next quality higher than Blueray

if any doubts with video & audio codec kindly approach me

Thankyou"
