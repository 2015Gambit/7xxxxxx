Patch 1.1 is included but not installed.

I have graphical issues when playing this game (messed up colors), but other people seem to run it fine. If you know how to fix that, please leave a comment.

MageSlayer is a top down Action RPG from the creators of Hexen and Heretic. The engine is similar to Take No Prisoners. There are 4 character classes to choose from and an inventory system.
Gameplay is similar to the old arcade hit Gauntlet.
