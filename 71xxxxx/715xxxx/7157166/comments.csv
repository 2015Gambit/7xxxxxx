These FLAC versions of surround albums are intended primarily for people who can listen to them straight out of their PC, and I don't really know how to burn them back into a working DVD. Check the comments here for some ideas: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6727138/Steven_Wilson_-_Grace_For_Drowning_%5BFLAC%5D_%5Bsurround%5D

However, if you'll only listen to this album on home theater, your best bet would be to track down premade DVD images - there don't appear to any for Aqualung on The Pirate Bay, you'll have to search around."
