V=?"
,lonegunman79,2012-04-03T19:10Z,"would say 
A=8 (bit tinny in parts)
V=7 (blurry in parts)
and there are hardcoded dutch subs (i think it's dutch)"
,adelarge655321,2012-04-04T05:46Z,"lonegunman, the subs certainly aren't dutch - most likely hungarian, as the uploader thought. furthermore: thanks BLOVES, pretty good quality for a cam, but i'll wait for a screener."
,BLOVES,2012-04-07T06:44Z,thankz for the comments
,luciano.duarte,2012-04-22T21:00Z,"V=1
A=1"
,.Leto.,2012-05-24T14:07Z,"Picture is REALLY blurry, plus you constantly see hungarian hardcoded subtitles. Sound is ok.
This movie doesn't look that great, I didn't see any action whatsoever during the first hour, so I'll wait for a better release."
