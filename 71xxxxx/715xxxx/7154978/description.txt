At a top secret facility on Alaskas the North Shore, one of the darkest secrets of the Cold War remains in storage. A substance recovered from a meteor, it has the same properties of anti-matter. Called ICE-10 is a dooms day substance that if released would start a chain reaction destroying the world. Created as a weapon of last resort, it was kept in the far north where the cold helped keep it under control. The deadliness of this material becomes evident when a military plane is dispatched to bring back a small amount for testing. When the plane crashes, the material escapes and an entire town in Northern Canada is wiped out.
