Enjoy and seed!"
,dududus,2012-04-02T09:09Z,"Thanks, but confuse, why should there be any chance it's corrupted? WinRAR repair is not the answer."
,Lelele5,2012-04-03T02:57Z,"Confirmed, works perfectly, just install the game to HDD.

Thank you so much, been searching for this for a long time."

RE was always a great game and id love to see this on the xbox :-)"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
L0 Video padding contains data but this is normal for XGD2 (The old way of
putting L1 video on L0). Add command line option --pL0 if you want to blank it
out (the data hasn't actually been checked that it matches L1 video... it could
be anything). Note that XGD2 ISOs without L1 video on L0 will appear to have
bad video data when checked with older versions of abgx360. This version of
abgx360 doesn't care about L1 video on L0... it will pad L0 video with zeroes
whenever video is autofixed or manually patched. You can rest assured that only
old and unsafe custom firmwares will read L1 video from L0; newer ones will
read it properly from L1. If you're tired of seeing this message then just
disable ""Check/Fix Video padding"", as it still makes no difference in terms
of stealth... this option only exists as a way to make sure ISOs are ""clean"",
with no extra data in areas that aren't CRC checked.

,Tyclone,2012-05-11T15:15Z,It means this rip is FUCKED mate!! All stats failed. What a waste of space...
[T],razalgul1979,2012-05-12T22:58Z,"I finished the game and also separate ways
The game works fine for me.
@Tyclone:
Get out of my torrent!
Currently has 24 seeds and 34 peers and does not need you"
,SingleSanctuary,2012-05-21T19:48Z,Thanks for this torrent! I burned this game onto a memorex dual layer (as with all of my XGD3 games) and it says you must install it to the hard drive! I don't use a hard drive I use a USB drive ! It takes 4 - 6 gb just so you know ! The game will not work if you don't install it! Thanks again! Are there any other arcade games like this one? Perhaps Perfect Dark? 
,this-sux,2012-06-02T18:27Z,"yo what the hell, iv got a question why dose it keep showin up when i try to burn it it says i only have 34K when i need like 2048? how d i get tht?"
,this-sux,2012-06-02T18:42Z,like i need some help wit this cuz this is the first download tht hasnt worked tht iv done
[T],razalgul1979,2012-06-04T05:35Z,"@this-sux:
What are you talking about dude?
It is an iso XGD2 and the size is 7.30 gb. Like all the isos XGD2 XBOX360"
,Ninj333,2012-06-25T02:30Z,"I was skeptical of this download as well as a lot others. Run Through AB, there will be errors, Burn with ImgBurn, and this is the important part if you do not install the game to your HD the game will not play. If you just run the disk you will get “Unauthorized Disc” or an error of that nature. Install to the HD then run the game and it shall work flawlessly. To be clear this game works perfectly, don’t listen to the haters! Great Job Raz!!"
,iNSaNesK8,2012-07-03T17:05Z,I start up the game and think its working.  I start a new game and it says that the disk is unreadable.  I don't know what I did wrong.
,iNSaNesK8,2012-07-03T17:28Z,How do you install this game to a Xbox 360 Slim with the newest dashboard?

Necesitan como bien lo dice instalar el juego y a jugar. Para quien pregunta no es multi idioma, el juego está en Inglés."
