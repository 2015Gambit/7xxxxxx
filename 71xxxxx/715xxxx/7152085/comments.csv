,T1RotfDotm,2012-04-10T09:35Z,"I thank you very much for uploading this show every week. Its mutely appreciated, but I can't help but ask, why is it that every episode goes down in video quality? A few others have commented on other uploads saying they were blurry. I found them to be okay, but this episode is extremely blurry. Yes, it is watchable. But I am very displeased with the quality of this upload. "
