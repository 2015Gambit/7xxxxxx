Which serial key are you referring to?

Regards."

No offense but why would you use Acronis when my installer does everything? And who would download 6GB when my original release is 2GB?! 

I recommend downloading my original release, it's only 2GB and much easier to install..

,bloxwich0,2012-04-04T17:47Z,"iMortaluz, no offence meant, I know your program is excellent because I used it to create the tib files.

The rest of the guys could choose which Acronis file to download, it doesn't have to be both and would then only be 3gb.

I do take your point but only have praise for you!!!"
