,whiskeytango75,2012-04-14T01:13Z,"Just go back from SA, thanks for getting these books KK.  

Seems like you can really find anything and everything.

Great work and I love downloading your books,  "
,freebiejunkie,2012-04-15T01:55Z,"Hiya, thank you so much for this. Might be a bit cheeky, but you wouldn't be able to find Chances, Lucky, Rockstar and Lover and Gamblers by any chance, would you please? Have looked everywhere. Would be a huge favour and I would seed them forever! Well, maybe not, but for a long time anyways! Thanks once  again x "
