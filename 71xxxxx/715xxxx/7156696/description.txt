Bassoa Podcast #2 - Mixed by Eddie Icicle
-----------------------------------------
"Bassoa" is a new podcast from the makers EDM-blog "Random Electric Noises". Like the blog, also the podcast aims to blend and share as many different kinds of music as possible, regardless of it's age or genre. Bassoa podcasts are a bite-sized chunk of the best electronic music around.

In the second episode we focuse a bit more into the great world of broken beats. Some dubstep, followed up by drum&bass, and finally few tracks of glitch-hop. Like "Random Electric Noises" at Facebook, not only to stay tuned with new podcasts but also to receive free downloads and stuff:
