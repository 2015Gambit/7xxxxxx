,Bak2Jak,2012-06-04T18:49Z,"I'm debating whether or not to buy this game, but since there's no ""trial version"" that I can see, I'm thinking about trying one of these cracked torrents first. So my question is, obviously being a noob as far as minecraft goes, how does playing this cracked version differ from playing the ""true"" version of the game? Can it not be played online, can it not be modded, does it lack certain functionality? And if I decide to buy the real thing, having had this on my drive and played it will not impede my playing the real game, will it? Sorry if these are noob questions but...I'm a noob and I ask noob questions."

cant imagine so many people disliking this torrent because they have crashes not realising its their PCs, not the torrent
guys, i play without ANY crashes, allright? So if you have them every 10 minutes, throw out your useless PC or just go to OPTIONS and set graphics to minimum, it will help.

You shouldn't feed the trolls, those are a lonely species and best ignored.

@Rattle189 :Your obsession towards mothers and vaginas can probably be helped with a little therapy, and a couple of years in a strict 12 step program.

There is nothing wrong with liking other boys, everyone including yourself will like you more when you come out of the closet as a proud homosexual, this cussing is just sad.
