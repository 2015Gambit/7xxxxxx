,SoCalRu,2012-04-26T09:27Z,"!!! AMD BULLDOZER USERS !!!

WITH MY GIGABYTE GA-990F-UD3 AM3+ MOTHERBOARD THE ONLY WAY TO GET MAC OS X TO BOOT IS BY PUTTING THE SATA DRIVES ON THE LEGACY ATA PORTS. THIS BOARD AND OTHER AMD AM3+/FX PROCESSOR CHIPSETS USE THE NEW AMD 9XX SERIES CHIPSET WHICH THERE CURRENTLY IS NO ACHI/RAID KEXT. PUT ONE SATA HARDDRIVE ON SATA PORT 4, AND THE DVD/BDROM DRIVE ON SATA PORT 5; SET BIOS TO ACHI WITH SATA 4/5 IN NATIVE IDE MODE. YOU WILL ALSO HAVE TO USE A 32-BIT APPLEGENERICATA.KEXT TO GET IT TO BOOT. 

2ND SOLUTION - BUY A SAS/SATA CONTROLLER CARD THAT IS NATIVELY SUPPORTED BY MAC OS X.
