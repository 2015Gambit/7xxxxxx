,bjw08,2012-04-02T09:43Z,"Cam rip does not do this film justice at all.
Good effort though, thank you.

,DeafMackem,2012-04-02T22:40Z,Total BS. This is a cam rip not a TS. Very unwatchable. V 1 A 1
,kotn420,2012-04-03T08:34Z,Stop posting your TS=total shit copy in the good section
,.CyberPunk.,2012-04-04T08:21Z,"A - 6
V - 4

Those ratings are on a scale of 1-10 for TS only! A 10 being a darn good TS! You can't use a 1-10 scale including quality compared to DVDRips, that is not right!

I checked the quality of this version compared to: Wrath.Of.The.Titans.2012.TS.NEW.READNFO.XviD-HOPE uploaded by .Bone. and Bone's up I just mentioned is much better quality.

No offense Hackulus, I have much respect for the skull here on TPB, however the version I mentioned is better quality.

I am not new to this, I don't comment much on TPB, and I can't remember my old pirate bay account/login so I just had to make a new comment.

I made this new account just to ask this:
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE uploaders, let us know when a 3D video source was used! I have not checked this version to see if it was, but on another copy of this movie I downloaded, you could tell it was a 3D movie! It is annoying, and I can't believe I don't see tons of other people bitching about it?!

Just please, mention in the info it was a 3D source, if it was one, so we can not waste our time, bandwidth. If only a 3D source is available, some of us will take what we can get.. However if there are other TS sources available that are not 3d video stream, then we would like to have to option.

I know I know.. your gonna say there is a sample.. Well with this magnet links, I can't select just the sample to download only. It doesn't show any files until a few minutes after the download starts.

It would just be good information for everyone, if the uploader mentions that it is a 3D video source."
,WeedPirate,2012-04-05T04:16Z,wtf dont put 720p on a movie thats 720x320
,samjnr,2012-04-05T04:56Z,"Cyberpunk its always been this rating, when someone rates something V-10 i don't expect to be downloading a fucking good cam.
Human nature means everyone has standards, some will rate a cam 9 just b'cos their happy to have found it on PB. We've all DL'd a rated 8 cam to find most of it is unwatchable.
Over rating b'cos u like the uploader is just as bad. Common sense!!"
,DragonFun,2012-04-06T15:13Z,so is this one 3D cause from the poster it seems like it..
,Pinophyta,2012-04-06T19:54Z,Why is this in HD? lol 
,keila0407,2012-04-07T08:44Z,hi res? fuck off dickhead
,theeccentrik,2012-04-07T10:16Z,"720/320 pixels is not 720p. You have clearly uploaded enough torrents that you know the title is bullshit!
All this does is render your torrent descriptions fake to encourage users to download it. No doubt ur loyal followers will swallow any old spunk u fire at them!!
cue the fanboys."
,Naglfar666,2012-04-07T21:43Z,"720x320 is not 720p.
You have much to learn.
0/10"
,exe1951,2012-04-08T11:28Z,sorry man not to good way to dark. thanks for trying 
,some-young-guy,2012-04-08T14:43Z,"Stop trying to distinguish which scale of measurement will apply to ALL of the world's video torrent.  TS or BRIP, who gives a shit.  1 is completely not watchable, 10 is perfect.  If it looks like a 1970's porno camera was used to film, then it'll probably land a rating of a 6 or 7.  True DVD Screeners that are released just before a major movie award ceremony will land a rating of a 10, even if not the most crisp blu ray quality."
,mmmeh04,2012-04-09T14:07Z,A TS rip can never be HD moive...when do ppl learn
,2800aaa,2012-04-09T15:49Z,Crap ! Not watchable
,LeadBrick,2012-04-12T22:55Z,"Thanks Hackulus for the torrent!

As grateful as I am for Hackulus effort:

V = 3
A = 7

During bright scenes video is ok, however, most of the movie is dark scenes which is extremely hard to see. Additionally, it goes in and out of focus quite a bit. I still enjoyed it, though. Thanks Hackulus. I'm seeding at around 600kB/s for a couple of hours."
,samjnr,2012-04-13T08:38Z,"@someyoungguy so a dvdscr is the same rating as 1080p bdrip?
Anyone who still has a 90's analogue TV listen to everything someyoungguy says, everyone else remember what year this is and ignore!!!"
,kotn420,2012-04-16T08:24Z,7total shit 720p copy

,Wezzy101,2012-05-05T22:20Z,720? get a fucking clue 1280x720 thats 720p resolution not 320x720
,legio9,2012-05-09T20:15Z,"Problem reside is the lack of standardization in the ratings, where some compared it to the format used, other one the quality etc  etc  rating should be on QUALITY, no matter the format.

here is one that we should ALL use so that we ALL speak the same ""language"":

Legio scale: 

10 = Blue ray quality
9   = DVD quality
8   = Excellent
7   = Superior
6   = Very good
5   = standard quality
4   = Bellow standard
3   = extra bellow quality
2   = Horrible
1   = crap
0   = unwatchable

THIS movie thus:

A= 6
V= 3"

no need to show disrespect to othr languages too.after all he is jst a dwloader !!!!"
,Shantanab,2012-06-01T00:21Z,"@kataramenos32 & shamomo :
Yeah, like watching a Greek mythological movie with ""English"" speaking characters is not ""laughable""...your ignorance about India, a Nation whose history and legacy are far richer than that of America, is only surpassed by your unbounded stupidity - American morons!
That's why every good movie (like Let the Right One In, Girl with the dragon tatoo series) is needed to be remade in English to cater you fools. I even have my doubts that either of you can speak ""proper"" English."
,Shantanab,2012-06-01T00:29Z,screw Indians hell yeah
