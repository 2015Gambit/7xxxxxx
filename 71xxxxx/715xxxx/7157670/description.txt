Narratives:

New York-based singer/songwriter Jay Brannan returns with sophomore full-length album Rob Me Blind on March 27, 2012. Jay released his critically lauded debut album goddamned in 2008, but first gained attention with his role in John Cameron MitchellÆs 2006 indie film Shortbus, where he performed his original song, Soda Shop.

For his sophomore effort, Jay teams up with Grammy-winning producer David Kahne (Regina Spektor, Paul McCartney, The Bangles), who brings instrumental textures to JayÆs songwriting, hinting at a slightly new direction for the minimalist artist while maintaining the signature qualities of a Jay Brannan album: brutal honesty, sharp wit, and sparkling melodies. Lyrically, the album follows the singer through states of loneliness, anger, rejection, and yearning, while somehow offering a glimpse of hope and self-acceptance.
