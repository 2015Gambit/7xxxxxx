[T],PirateBoy,2012-04-02T13:41Z,"Well...this is the last season for sure. But again, nothing can be said about Bleach!!! lol :D

Anyways...other animes like Naruto, Naruto Shippuuden, One Piece and others will be uploaded in due time in 720p HD (if available) or else 720p upscaled quality. :)"

,animeadicted0x0,2012-04-02T20:35Z,if i am not wrong this is the title of season 17 *Final_ARC The Thousand-Year Bloodwar* not sure at all....
[T],PirateBoy,2012-04-03T02:48Z,"Yes. U r right. What we heard is that the anime has ended as the ep 366 is the last ep of the anime but the manga still continues.

So, cant say anything. It depends upon Funimation and the Bleach producers. :)"
,acrinym,2012-04-05T05:10Z,"It's rumored that bleach has continued, just on a different station.... I'm not sure though. "
,acrinym,2012-04-05T05:15Z,"look up jag.jagger on Facebook, and add me. :)"
,acrinym,2012-04-05T05:15Z,"By the way PirateBoy, you have awesome releases. "

[T],PirateBoy,2012-06-07T20:31Z,"@ everyone

Sorry, the resolution in the description is wrong. It isn't 1280 x 720. Its a 480p DVDRip but in very good quality and least size possible. :)

@ bastien360

Well...in a word, its Encoding. otherwise, its a trade secret... lol"
