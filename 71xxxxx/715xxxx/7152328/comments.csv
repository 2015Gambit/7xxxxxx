,scorcher1,2012-04-02T13:39Z,3gp sucks big time. Even worse than the old xvid. Stay with the newer x264!

,The_bay_is_clear,2012-04-02T17:42Z,"K, so this finished downloading for me, and I'd say video/audio quality is 9 & 9 ;-)

BTW, the 3gp extension seems to be playing both in Windows Media Player and in VLC Player for me without renaming :-/"
