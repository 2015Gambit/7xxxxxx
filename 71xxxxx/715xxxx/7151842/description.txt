Duration: 1 Hour

Colin Murray presents highlights of the day's Premier League fixtures between Newcastle and Liverpool, and Tottenham against Swansea.
Both Newcastle and Liverpool are vying for a top-six finish and European qualification, a target that would exceed Newcastle's pre-season expectations, but one which would be considered a minimum requirement by the Reds. Liverpool's season has been undermined by a lack of goals, and all eyes will be on struggling 35m pound striker Andy Carroll as he returns to his former club for the first time since his British record transfer.

Champions League-chasing Tottenham play host to a Swansea side which has exceeded expectation since promotion to the Premier League. The two sides drew 1-1 in the reverse fixture but Swansea go into this game seeking their first ever league victory at White Hart Lane.

As ever there will be a review of the previous day's goals and incidents, with expert analysis provided by Mark Lawrenson and March Goal Of The Month.
