thanks for uploading this,but i have a suggestion for you,the size is too big,most people will wait and download a smaller rip.

you can get a very good quality rip if u limit the size to between 2.5 - 3.5 GB and encode your HD capture using x264.

The benefit of this is that u can upload the file quickly and people will be able to download the smaller file much sooner than the 7 GB file,this means more people will also seed the torrent."
[T],Shepard76,2012-04-04T00:37Z,All right. I will upload an standard resolution with lower resolution of the match as soon as I can too.

i think u missed my point,smaller size file does not mean it has to be lower resolution,u can 1280 x 720 resolution in a file size between 2.5-3.5 GB

for example ,see these - 

Barcelona v Athletic Bilbao 720p HD - 

1280x720,size - 3.43 GB -

AC Milan v Barcelona 720p HD - 

1280x720,size - 3 GB -

[T],Shepard76,2012-04-04T02:14Z,Oh. Alright I get it. I will try to convert and play with settings but trying to keep a similar resolution. I just started to learn how to convert HD to smaller size recently. Thanks for the advice.

sure,no problem,glad to help,and u are right it does take some trial and error to figure out the best settings for encoding.

there is another great free software that many people use for x24 encoding,it's called HandBrake,u may wanna try it -
