,penfold22,2012-04-04T03:58Z,"Video looks quite blurry, significantly worse than a typical 700MB rip. Seems all copies out now are poor quality. I'm waiting for a true DVDRip.

Disappointed because this one looked interesting."
,kriptikchicken,2012-04-04T08:30Z,Yeah pretty much the same as penfold... video pretty blurry... will wait for a better copy. Thanks for the effort though.
