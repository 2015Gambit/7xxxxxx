Trashopolis - S01-S02 HistChan Docu Series (2010-2011) xvid avi

I converted to xvid from a webstream but could only get a lower bitrate
so some audio harmonics exist.. which can be filtered out using VLC
audio filters EQ set to flat or similar

Season 1 
From Paris and Rome to New York, London and Cairo, this five-part series digs up the unexplored history of these great cities in an effort to better understand what made them the way that they are today. 

Season 2
Covers more citys from Jerusalem to Japan and India

IF GRABBING help seed! its a bit torrent and if hit and runs happen
will reduce me seeding new torrents in future.. be fair!

enjoy
