When a high-speed chase goes terribly wrong, Santa Fe police officer Dan Page 

watches in horror as a car and gas tanker explode into flames. Torn with guilt 

that he may be responsible, Page returns home to discover that his wife, Tori, has 

disappeared. Frantic, Page follows her trail to Rostov, a remote town in Texas 

famous for a massive astronomical observatory, a long-abandoned military base, and 

unexplained night time phenomena that draw onlookers from every corner of the

globe. Many of these gawkers, Tori among them, are compelled to visit this tiny 

community to witness the mysterious Rostov Lights.


Without warning, a gunman begins firing on the lights, screaming "Go back to hell 

where you came from", then turns his rifle on the bystanders. A bloodbath ensues, 

and events quickly spiral out of control, setting the stage for even greater 

violence and death.


Page must solve the mystery of the Rostov Lights to save his wife. In the process, 

he learns that the decaying military base may not be abandoned at all, and that 

the government may have known about the lights for decades. 


Could these phenomena be more dangerous than anyone could have possibly imagined?
