It all started with chickens.

It may be the dominant political force of our times, but the economic 
creed that came to be known as Thatcherism was born in obscure circumstances.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, politics was dominated by a single philosophy. 
Central planning and state control of industry was seen by both Labour and Conservatives as the only sensible way to run Britain's economy.

Planning had helped Britain win the war, the thinking went, so why not the peace as well?

It fell to outsiders such as Anthony Fisher - an Old Etonian chicken farmer - to 
challenge the prevailing orthodoxy; even if, initially, they were written off as 
cranks or dangerous ideologues.

Fisher, who made his fortune by pioneering battery farming techniques, founded a think tank, The Institute of Economic Affairs, in the mid 1950s to spread his free market philosophy.

And it is the story of that philosophy and the people who created it that forms the central theme of the three part BBC documentary series Tory! Tory! Tory!. Yhis is the companion series to the documentary LEFTIES.
