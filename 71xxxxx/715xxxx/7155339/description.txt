In this weekΓÇÖs conversation with International Forecaster Bob Chapman we discuss: AustraliaΓÇÖs position in the global economic system, the recent Queensland elections, the possibility of a BRICS bank to rival the World Bank/IMF, the increasingly brazen moves of a police state that is admittedly watching everything and everyone, the 15 trillion dollar party, the funding of the Syrian insurgents by the US and others and much much more.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
