,jachim72,2012-04-02T04:37Z,"3GP?

WTF?"
,steelllynx,2012-04-02T04:50Z,Plays OK for me with Media Player Classic (included with K-Lite Mega Codec Pack)
,Granchy,2012-04-02T05:26Z,Damn I got way too used to the mp4s and being able to transfer them right to my Vita.
,Polymathj,2012-04-02T06:51Z,"Great, now there's another major uploader that thinks he's too damn cool for avi and mp4. 

Why don't you rar it too?"
,botcrawl,2012-04-02T07:06Z,Is this the movie with Nicolas Cage?
,botcrawl,2012-04-02T07:07Z,FREE? WTF?
,undeadxinfection,2012-04-02T09:00Z,3GP... Really?
,Tombosaurus,2012-04-02T09:29Z,Thank you!
,ViolentC,2012-04-02T10:20Z,"was there a simpsons ep last night? cant seem to find it.
PS. Any format is fine by me.
WMP with a kodec pack. use a computer plugged into a HDTV with HDMI cable. these new files play fine at 42"" with my nose pressed against the screen. I have no idea what you are complaining about. get with the times and don't blame the technology for updating, blame your crapbox computer for being the same..."
,dqdsd,2012-04-02T11:54Z,"hahaha, calm down people, it's april fools, although the files have been renamed into *.3gp, they are still encoded just like always. "
,cactjunk,2012-04-02T13:22Z,"Awful episode, best joke was EZ's April Fool's ""3GP"" encoding. Thanks again EZ"
,flashasaurus,2012-04-02T13:23Z,the quality is shit
,jimbo187,2012-04-02T14:44Z,3gp??? mobile format humm this better not suck..i would be upset :( as i allways get my shows and shit from you
,jimbo187,2012-04-02T14:48Z,i take back what i said very good quality as normal :) WOOHOO shame its a shit episode apparently next time people say spoiler alert 
,Baguett,2012-04-02T15:19Z,".3gp, that is mobile video quality..."
,Baguett,2012-04-02T15:21Z,Same quality but lower file size :)
,zielix,2012-04-02T18:10Z,"I just signed up to write this comment. Do go for what people are saying. This is amazing quality at amazing file size. Probably better than .avi and mp4. 

Just download and see it for yourself. 

A10/V10"
,spotek,2012-04-02T19:04Z,Fuck you with your 3gp bullshit. Even if it was meant to be april fools joke. It sucks...
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2012-04-02T19:04Z,"Stop bitching about codecs and realize its all about achieving a small file size. A10/V10
THANKS FOR THE UP!"
,TheSageM,2012-04-02T20:27Z,"It amazes me that people would doubt eztv's uploads. I mean, really? I don't even look at the format, just click ""download"". I have never been and will never be disappointed. Complainers would do well to remember that they are free to download other people's versions. I will stick with eztv, thank you very much."
,Jacexx,2012-04-02T21:27Z,why not mp4?
,Tomstoon,2012-04-02T23:40Z,"Fair enough the file type being 3gp on aprils fools, but it's slightly annoying this week for me as i like to save every episode onto my PS3 and can't do so with such file type!

However, quality is excellent and who am i to moan at an uploader. thanks. "
,Granchy,2012-04-03T00:08Z,"If the 3gp was an april fool's joke, then that's hilarious.  The quality is just fine, so no complaints here.  But damn, that's pretty clever and funny."
,idk420,2012-04-03T00:57Z,"just sign up to say thanks for the upload man, ppl bitch alot lol nice joke XD"
,Denial182,2012-04-03T01:25Z,"Hahahahaha .3gp

,filteredglitch,2012-04-03T02:19Z,OMG i can't believe Peter actually dies in this episode!  Sorry for the spoiler you guys.. just sayin'
,101pepsi,2012-04-03T02:29Z,WHAT THE HELL IS A 3GPP? still nice UP
,joegreg13,2012-04-03T05:34Z,Hey all you haters of EZTV . It's funny how all you drop him because he was trying something new on here.  Just so you JET Audio . a free program and best video thing plays it perfectly fine . Which means nero 11 will burn it or recode it 
,joegreg13,2012-04-03T05:35Z,If you don't have nero 11 . there is a search box . I got mine from here
,DeadlyLady,2012-04-03T10:52Z,Quit whining you idiots.
,Muchacho0,2012-04-03T11:52Z,"whoa, for a moment there I thought it was recorded using a mobile phone or something..."
,High_Voltage_Rock_N_Roll,2012-04-03T13:58Z,"Don't worry, just change the file name from 3GPP to MP4. I did and now it plays fine on my media player for the tv."
,Jugh3ad,2012-04-03T19:02Z,Excellent quality. Can't believe it's only 68MB. Thank you very much.
,Snedde1,2012-04-03T20:00Z,Brilliant
,richwn,2012-04-03T21:18Z,"3gp? really? the format popular with low bitrate phone capture from around 6-7 years ago?

dont seed this and find another torrent.

eztv - sure some of us are fans of future codecs such as h.264 and .mkv file containers, but right now the simple fact is that the majority of devices that just play media dont handle these things. people want something that just plays easy across a broad range of things, their phone/xbox/tablet/ps3/dvdplayer/tv, and right now that format is still, undeniably, the xvid/avi combo."
,Narupriest,2012-04-04T06:58Z,"I got no problems whatsoever, excellent quality for such a small filesize! Thanks for the upload.

@ people having issues with the file: download K-lite codec pack (full), install everything, done. You can now play every type of file, in all media players."
,trafficfighter,2012-04-04T21:49Z,thanks eztv!
,tetrisacidbath,2012-04-05T00:00Z,Wonderful: it worked like a charm and the quality is fantastic. Much love for the uploader.
,cvolcano,2012-04-05T01:11Z,"Works fine WMP or VLC, majority download for PC anyway... and it's TINY TINY."

,666ASPEN666,2012-04-07T06:03Z,nothing special about it being named a gp3 file.. still same as the mp4 ones
,Heromist,2012-04-09T07:16Z,"lol, 3GP lol really? guise use VLC media player itll work fine..

,majuaraan,2012-04-10T19:03Z,"it seem like 3gp format is getting more popular, don't work on my nokia though, just make it easier on everyone and MP4 "
