,opaleg,2012-04-05T04:49Z,when I level... I don't seem to be getting points to put into things..? I downloaded it from this torrent for sure.
,opaleg,2012-04-05T04:50Z,"on my last comment, I guess at level 5 is when you start getting points.. so nevermind if that's true."
,opaleg,2012-04-05T04:51Z,nevermind about the leveling up thing.. I think you start getting points at level 5.
,beserke1,2012-04-17T03:36Z,Is this fully functioning?
,C0QR0UG3,2012-04-24T06:49Z,"@opaleg you dont get any points until lvl 5, maybe thats why? ;)

Great game great torrent!"
,zazick12,2012-05-20T20:55Z,it works perfect:) thx dude
,Sinio1988,2012-05-28T14:13Z,What is the version of this game?
,SeattleSeed,2012-06-03T08:40Z,"Works like a charm. I was getting some errors that said certain files were ""read only"" but I just hit ignore (about a thousand times) and all my problems were solved.

I Downloaded the (razor1911) game 
Then the 1.4.1 patch
And now the DLC to complete the game.

There are torrents out there that have all of those in one file, but I couldn't get them to work. "

,vmanwiz,2012-07-17T07:20Z,"These are DLCs only right? Not the game and DLCs? I know I know, I sound quite stupid asking these questions."
,XATHORN,2012-07-29T03:15Z,"I Followed the directions exactly but when i go into binaries and click on borderlands.exe an error message comes up:
The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration in incorrect Please see the application event log for more detail. Can anyone help me?"

,just1aim,2012-08-05T07:40Z,"thanks .bone.
you are the man
peace from hawaii"
,qtchini2ja,2012-08-28T08:34Z,"for the physxcudart_20.dll missing issue, just do this: 
go to your game's ""Binaries"" folder, in there you''ll find a cudart.dll file. Copy & paste it. Now, you'll have 2 cudart.dll files on the same folder. Just rename the second one to physxcudart_20.dll, and you're good to go. "
,qtchini2ja,2012-08-28T08:45Z,i also have the same question as vmanwiz. These are DLCs only right? Not the game and DLCs?
,Carlos.mh,2012-09-11T20:50Z,"@ vmanwiz & qtchini2ja: Nope, this torrent contains the game AND the DLCs. Works flawlessly, thanks BONE."
,brianxxx,2012-09-16T00:08Z,"Thanks! Worked perfectly for me. My retail copy went missing and I needed a good replacement! Actually, I had no intentions of ever playing again, as much as I loved it but the damn Borderlands 2 commercials got me feeling nostalgic! lol Might do CO-OP with my girl until we get the cash to by B2 in a few weeks."
