Are you an engineer, scientist or graduate student looking for a graphing tool that will allow you to quickly analyze graphed data without having to immerse yourself into calculus and statistics books? 

The problem
Sometimes it is necessary to compare the data obtained from independent sources  to modern data. Typically input data sources are line graphs or scatter diagrams from Internet pages, text files, Excel tables or personal raw data. You want the ability to remove false points and add desirable points interactively.

The solution  
Use FindGraph.  It's quick and easy! FindGraph is a comprehensive, feature-rich graphing, digitizing and curve fitting software specially created for these purposes. Take any graph or data from any source (Web or PDF document, for example), add your comments, and perform any manipulations, like nonlinear regression or curve fitting. Then print your results or export them to Excel or other database. 

If your goal is simply to create a smooth curve for interpolation or simulation, FindGraph is the tool you need. It is especially suitable for the scientific, engineering, medical, and teaching professions, and in finance.
