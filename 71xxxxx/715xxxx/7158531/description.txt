Ohio three-piece MOBILE DEATHCAMP can play some pummeling no holds barred speed metal.

The quality of the songs on their full-length debut, Black Swamp Rising, are straight ahead old school
metal assaults with cross over appeal. What they do is nothing new or even technically difficult, but the
sheer force of their songs is commendable. Originally released in 2008, only a 1,000 copies of Black
Swamp Rising were released through the band, but now that Sacrifice Records took over their distribution,
the band is hoping they will be able to ship some more units. Guitarist/vocalist Todd Evans was GWAR s bassist
Beefcake the Mighty, (the third one). He proudly served five years in the GWAR monster army, but he quit the
band because of his desire to play guitar again with his own band.One Brainis an instrumental that starts off
the CD. It s a mid-paced pounding with some driving riffs and frantic lead work by Evans.Feed The Machineis
a quick punk-tinged blaster with a crushing chorus.Offensive Releaseis another instrumental with guests Devin
Townsend, Shane Clark of 3 INCHES OF BLOOD and Evans trading guitar solos.The Buffalo Songis an authentic
piece of music based on a real pow wow which pays homage to the Native American Indian. It s a welcomed
endeavor for a metal band s diversity to include a song of this nature to its repertoire. This is a pretty decent
release with good production. As one of the opening slots on GWAR s current Bloody Tour of Horror, they have
a great chance to influence the fans to get on board with their brand of straight ahead speed metal.
