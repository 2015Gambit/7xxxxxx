You can change everything by yourself in the screensaver settings.

Such as item order (Sequential, random and shuffle).
How long a image wait for another one.
Position of the images (Resize, stretch or do nothing).
100+ effects to view the next image. (Including the speed)
You can add your own playlist to the screensaver for your own music.
And much more.

The screensaver comes with a easy installer so you don't have to do anything, just run the .exe file in the torrent and click once on "next" and that's it your're done.

I hope you will enjoy the screensaver, and please come back for more stunning free tuned-cars screensavers.
