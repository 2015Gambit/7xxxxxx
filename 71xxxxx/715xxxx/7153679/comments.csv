Did I miss anything?"

,Taikalasit,2012-04-05T05:09Z,@ CapnJump: The scene clearly ends before it should. it's supposed to last 37:20 but it cuts off around the 31 min mark. Looks like the file may be corrupted as you can't rewind normally.
,CapnJump,2012-04-05T15:11Z,I have to look into that. Thanks for the feedback.
,CapnJump,2012-04-15T19:35Z,"Same file. thoroughly checked.
