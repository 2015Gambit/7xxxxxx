The Greatest Bounty-Hunt In History

FIFTEEN NAMES
 There are 15 targets, the finest warriors
 in the world - commandos, spies, terrorists.
 And they must all be dead by 12 noon, today.
 The price on their heads: almost $20 million each. 


ONE HERO
 Among the names on the target list, one stands
 out. An enigmatic Marine named Shane Schofield,
 call-sign: Scarecrow.


 NO LIMITS
 And so Schofield is plunged into a headlong race
 around the world, pursued by a fearsome
 collection of international bounty hunters -
 including the 'Black Knight', a notoriously
 ruthless hunter who seems intent on eliminating
 only Schofield.


 The race is on and the pace is frantic as Schofield
 fights for survival, in the process unveiling a
 vast international conspiracy and the terrible
 reason why he cannot, under any circumstances,
 be allowed to live...

He led his men into hell in Ice Station.
 He protected the President against all odds in Area 7.
 This time it's different.

Because this time SCARECROW is the target.
