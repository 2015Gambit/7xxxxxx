Thank you for downloading this Ultimate AIM-Professionals mod vers. 1.1

Unzip it to:  steamsteamappscommonjabia

The 1.1 release have new weapon and ammunition files. 
After many hours of testing and researching I found the perfect formula for snipers in the game.

I used WilsonMG (Blue Dawn) formulas and also BlackAlphas 
(Firearms Rebalanced Experimental)  formulas in my own way. 
I liked the of the ideas those guys have found. But then my own experiences 
as a Recon Team sniper (Finish Paratroopers, long range, RecBatt)
I felt long time ago that, in this game the sniper are not working as in reality.
Now I had finally time for this testings with these values.

We also have a nice video of these tests and go for yourself and watch it. You will find it from AddMe Youtube website:

Now I also want to tell you that the difference with headshots and shots to torso are making the realism. And it is how it works in real world also. I am very happy 
I found right values so you also can enjoy role-play a real sniper. 
Well, allmost...

There is also a new background video. I encourage you to sometime just sit and listen to the new nice music we have in game and watch the video in background. It is a video from CIA satellite spycamera which was hacked. Place is unknow, but it is from Arulco.

There is also a new background for the in-game laptop.

Some minor adjustments have been made in several files. All small fixes which I have noticed during playing the mod and had few emails also from you guys.

Thanks for all the kind support you have given.

Happy Hunting !
