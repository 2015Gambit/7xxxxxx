,Thepthep,2012-04-03T05:06Z,hi do you have DVD copy of this.. can you post here so i can dowload.. thank's...
,kriiis,2012-04-03T17:24Z,A/V?
,Stellar1024,2012-04-03T19:46Z,"One of the best cams I've seen. 
V=8
A=8
Audio is a bit quiet, but good quality. Only annoying part is the subs, but for the most part they are below the picture."
,Stellar1024,2012-04-03T20:23Z,"Actually, V=7 now that I've seen the dark parts.. a bit hard to view."
,vbtoons,2012-04-04T03:51Z,"Works, not a bad job encoding.... probably the best quality of a cam job I've seen. Sound and vid is good. With foreign subs. VOB files so you'll have to use a VOB converter to recode then master onto a DVD. Thanks!"
,rgid,2012-04-05T03:04Z,What does NL SUBS mean? Thanks.
,Ceronn,2012-04-05T07:54Z,NL is short for Netherlands.  The subtitles are in Dutch.
,Cameigons,2012-04-06T15:26Z,"Very good for a TS.

V: 7.0
A: 8.0"
,OGradz,2012-04-08T15:20Z,Miss categorized. Found this in Top 100 DVDR but it's a TS.
,Sn0okk,2012-04-08T18:35Z,"5gb, for a dvd format, good job..."
,Fluffenstein,2012-04-08T23:00Z,Am I the only one who can't seem to hear any audio? I even turned everything all the way up.
,F3L0N,2012-04-09T06:59Z,"Im about a decade out of this game, but this is a great cam.  No shakes and good audio.  There are a couple of dark scenes that you will swear at but overall this is a great copy of the movie for the time (APRIL 8 2012) that we are at right now(was a mod for a short time at MovieNight if that means anything to anyone).  Previous ref's note some V and A references that I am not familiar with, but playing with Power DVD 9.5 provides pretty good results.  Thank you seeders and I will continue to help out :)"
,neocrosby,2012-04-11T10:53Z,"Decent quality.  The dark scenes suck and you can pretty much not tell what is going on, but for the most part I feel pretty good about saving the $14 or whatever dollars I would have spent at the theater."
,latsoman,2012-04-12T16:11Z,"good torrent (low sound but i don't care) thanks

and for everyone without sound
install ""directshow decoder""
search google"
,pharkit,2012-04-13T16:58Z,"V: 5

A: 5"
,firexninja,2012-04-16T04:03Z,thank you!
,smartiex90,2012-04-18T11:33Z,Its in wayyy too many files. What program should I use to compress them together??
,two_of_us,2012-04-19T02:00Z,"Not sure if it's just me, but I only got 1hr 59 mins of movie? Missing the ending???"
,Shadowym,2012-04-20T02:06Z,This is definitely not a 7 or 8 in quality.  More like 5 or 6
,ChasUGC,2012-04-23T05:52Z,"For an early release, I give it A=8,V=7. Very easy to watch in spite of the dark scenes near the ending, and the subs. Can't ask for much more for free. Thank You."
,ChasUGC,2012-04-23T05:54Z,@two_of_us - It's all there.
,tealc89,2012-04-27T01:56Z,"Great upload. When viewed with VLC media player the audio is perfect and the video except for the dark parts are excellent. There are some color temperature variations, but since this is a non DVD/Blu-Ray release I have no problems with that.

V-8.5
A-8.5"
,NaumanC4,2012-04-28T00:45Z,"Very shitt quality, not worth downloading with 
4.36 GIB lol, waste of time and space"
,Mojonixon12,2012-04-28T08:38Z,"Seems like no-one understands that NL subs swamping PB is just an ambitious attempt from the pirate hunters to reduce PBs popularity. 

Face it, all of it is crappy versions (cam) ruined by subs and always(!) categorized in wrong section (DVDR or DV), to attend attraction.

(Also- traffic from the Neatherlands should be limited and their (viewers knowledge in English should be fair enough, so why bother hardcode with NL subs? Its just strange...)

Please, lets get rid of those fuXXers. Don't download. Don't promote. Spead info on their activities. 

If they turn up with serious stuff, well fine, but until they do (and they won't) - just ignore!"
,reinoud95,2012-04-28T11:58Z,@Mojonixon12 You must be the stupidest fuck in the world to beleive the shit that just came out of your mouth.
,Mojonixon12,2012-04-28T21:39Z,"@reinoud95 Missed your explenation so I could be enlightened...Actually, why bother writing? You are only rude while Im trying to solve a problem. NL-subs torrents has, and are, swamping PB. Did not use to be that way years back.
And why hardcoded. Its work been put down to do that (to crappy copies as well). You could as well just send along a textile. Does not end up.

If you like to believe that the pirate hunters still only works legal ways, your in for a great surprise.

But I guess you are one of five that enjoys NL-subs....? The other 2 millions could bare sifting thru the hundred of NL-subs torrents for you guys, right?

Im sure stupid, but Im still are able to argue for me. So that leaves you where? 
You can stop cutting your own throat when your spine gives resistance. Thanks.

,Sn0okk,2012-04-28T21:40Z,"verkeerde catagorie... het is een cam, geen dvdrip. en 4gb voor een cam -.-... je kan beter een 700mb met de zelfde kwaliteit downloaden en dan gwn een ondertitel bestand van 0.1mb ofzo downloaden"
,yRoshdiokgt,2012-04-29T21:02Z,I just watched Hunger games at watch athf dot com in top quality for free :) 
,tomsan84,2012-05-02T17:15Z,"@Mojonixon12

It doesnt really make sense. Why dutch? why not arabic? I think the dutch community is just very active on PB nothing more nothing less. Also the swamping imo would never have a effect as long as there are good torrents, people know how to interpreted the info. I just think youre fabricating a bit of nonsense. 

I as a dutchman dont care about dutch hardsubs, so I wont stop seeding etc.

on the otherhand maybe youre on to something, I just dont see it"
,FliteRisk,2012-05-05T01:02Z,"What's with the password protected Rar files?? I'm not clicking on your pay sites for a screener.

Anyone else have a problem with this concept?"
,Suhub,2012-05-05T14:21Z,"@Mojonixon12
Excuse me? Are you saying NLUPPER002 is trying to degrade TPB by posting torrents with NL subs? Do me a favor and compare your number of uploads to his, then get back to me. If you don't want hardcoded NL subs, go get another torrent."
,Doowangle,2012-05-06T21:54Z,"@Mojonixon12 

If you are stupid enough to believe there is some big conspiracy to put NL subtitles in movies, then there is nothing anyone can say that will make you understand what a complete clown you sound like. 

I don't suppose you ever stopped to think that perhaps people in the NL like movies just as much as you do...nah that can't be it. Must be a conspiracy! 

Kindly go back to youtube comments where people like yourself belong. "
,hbv19,2012-05-08T06:49Z,What is the password????
,baz5tud,2012-05-09T03:57Z,"FLITERISK.

Hi, 

Yeah I have a huge problem with clicking into or taking part in crap on pay sites to unlock a RAR file.

True sharing is sharing without conditions.

I seed every download I get for 2 days minimum, then I clear them and download something else if I find I want another, if not I just leave the others seeding until I need something and repeat seeding again, so I can share back :-)

I haven't sussed uploading yet, but I'd only be converting to 1080P and resharing as I can't access movies so early like some people can.

Either share freely, or don't share at all it just hacks people off. Maybe that is the intent from some people though............?

The title is clearly labelled ""TS2DVD""
The Source is clearly labelled as a ""TS"" from INSPIRAL.
If you're too damn stupid to realise that this file isn't a dvd rip & has non-English subtitles hard-coded then perhaps it's you that needs to return to school and study English Reading & Comprehension."
,ChasUGC,2012-05-21T00:43Z,"@Mojonixon12- This is an early release. It just came out in the  theaters. It is not available as a screener or DVD rip yet.

The reason there are subs on this one is because it was pirated from a Netherland movie theater. The uploaders try to bring us the best quality, and for now, this one from the Netherlands is the best available. If they 
cropped it to remove the subs, you would undoubtly complain about that.

Stop whining and be grateful, or risk serious jail time recording it in a  US theater yourself, and then spend time refining it, and uploading it. Show a little gratitude to the uploaders, or STFU."
,Evul1,2012-05-21T22:07Z,"shut the fuck up and just rate the download. No one cares about your bullshit drama, and nothing you have to say is anywhere near as important or useful as you think it is.
