,danishprakash,2012-04-06T07:31Z,@oatman █ It's 1080p It has to be Big
,Paradisel,2012-04-09T07:02Z,Not 1080p. Just an upscaled dvd.
,DOHC-6,2012-04-12T01:46Z,"3.2g? you're joking...

That is Not BIG. 
Even the dvd9 version of the SD movie was 8gig on the disc.
There is no release date as of yet for the 3D version of the movie. That is Months away."
,danishprakash,2012-04-29T05:33Z,@DOHC-6 █ I Agree
