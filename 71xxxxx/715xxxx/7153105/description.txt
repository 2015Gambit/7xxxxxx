China: Triumph and Turmoil 
Niall Ferguson meets the people who can explain what China stands for: from newly minted billionaires in China's megacities to the survivors of the madness of Chairman Mao; and from aggressive young nationalists hacking into our computers to the brave defenders of China's rural poor. And he answers the questions that should concern all of us: will this turn out to be the Chinese century? Should we be scared? Or will the Red Dragon crash and burn?


1)  Emperors 
Niall Ferguson shows how the vast apparatus of the Chinese state has always been called on to subjugate individual freedom to the higher goal of unity. Ferguson also examines how, on the other hand, centralised control produces tensions that threaten to destroy the country.
