,evilg0d,2012-06-30T15:40Z,"Thank you fredyr for this. Especially as it is the spoken Japanese with English subs original.

(Personally I think Dubs are horrid and that the people who claim to hate subtitles are usually those who can't read well and won't admit it or are racist or possibly both.)"

,Lorddavo4,2012-08-11T04:24Z,Hey Just for your information I prefer dubs not because I am a sub-par reader in fact I have a reading level which far exceeds most people but because I like to be able to enjoy the art without the subtitles interfering with my consumption of the beauty of the artwork which in my opinion is far more important than the voice acting
