,EngineeringTheEnemy,2012-04-04T07:21Z,Dude... Your torrents are a GOD SENT!!! Pretty much everything I ever had back in the day growing up in Cali.  If you have any Rodney O' Joe Cooley or Too Short would be awesome!!!  Oh and AMG's first album. Hmm I know there are tons more i'm forgetting.  The first DJ Quik would be great too...  Just keep it up bro!!! Thank you so so much
[T],Sackilla666,2012-04-04T08:05Z,"@ EngineeringTheEnemy I do have Rodney O & Too Short, but there are other torrents that have them, so I tend to just put up what I don't see on here.  As for AMG well my Bitch Betta Have my Money is Jacked up.  I'm trying to salvage it, but it skips horribly, so until I can be happy with the rip I won't be putting it up.  Now Dj quick here is the link http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7126064/DJ_Quik_-_Quik_Is_The_Name_(1991)
I'll be posting more I'm just getting into the E's & still a lot more letters in the alphabet to go. :)"
,EngineeringTheEnemy,2012-04-04T20:35Z,Ya... I just know a lot of the great old school rap stuff sometimes is hard to get seeders.  Thanks for all the ups!!! They are great!  It reminds me how awesome rap used to be here in Northern Cali growing up!!  
,EngineeringTheEnemy,2012-04-04T21:13Z,ohh god... what about mc pooh? Do you have that? 
,EngineeringTheEnemy,2012-04-04T21:53Z,The Rodney O and Joe Cooley torrent I found on Bit has no seeding.  If you ever get around to it... I'd really appreciate whatever you have on them.  Thanks so much! You are a god sent!!! ha...
