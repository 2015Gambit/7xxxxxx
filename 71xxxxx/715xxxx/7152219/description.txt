Lyrics:

The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having
A wonderful
Christmas time
Simply having
A wonderful
Christmas time

The party's on
The feeling's here
That only cause (only cause)
It's time of year

Simply having
A wonderful
Christmas time
Simply having
A wonderful
Christmas time

The choir
Of children
Sing their song
They practice
All night long

Ding dong
Ding dong
Ding dong
Ding dong

Simply having
A wonderful
Christmas time
Simply having
A wonderful
Christmas time

The word is out
About the town
To lift
Your glass
I don't look down

Simply having
A wonderful
Christmas time
Simply having
A wonderful
Christmas time

Simply having
A wonderful
Christmas time
Simply having
A wonderful
Christmas time
Simply having
A wonderful
Christmas time
Simply having
A wonderful
Christmas time
