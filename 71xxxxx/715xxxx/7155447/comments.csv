You are wrong Avatar is their original cartoon title in 2005.
This name already used before they release the live action movie.
The Last Airbender is new name for the live action movie.
You should check wiki again"
,poffik,2012-04-06T20:30Z,"this is not live action movie you retard, this is animated TV series, check the wiki as i said, and read first paragraph, fool."

Actually, the other guy is right. James Cameron is a faggot and has copyrighted the title ""Avatar,"" so even though The Last Airbender came out first (and everyone knows it) that little piece of shit forced (I think) Nickelodeon to demand a rename. Thus, the new name of the show is ""The Last Airbender: The Legend of Korra"" Also there was a live action movie called ""The Last Airbender."" You're probably not aware of it because it was awful. In any case, here is to you James Cameron, you greedy douche. _|_"
,ZONE7,2012-04-12T15:49Z,TV team please can u upload ep 2 of this show thank u
,RedWz,2012-04-12T22:29Z,Is this supposed to be Season 4 (S04) Episode 102 (E0102)?
,Qajs1,2012-04-14T22:02Z,"The new TV Series is just called ""The Legend of Korra"" look it up on NICKELODEON's website. No Wiki's or other 3rd-party source. "
,Crimsondrake1138,2012-04-16T18:50Z,"I think the name should be changed. Legend of Korra is a whole new series, yes it has ties to The Last Air Bender but it's completely new. It's like saying Batman Beyond is season 20 of Batman The Animated series. get my point... that and the majority of uploaders as well as the whole Air Bender community sees it as a separate entity, the fact that people are arguing about this point should show proof of that... ant that's my 2 cents on the matter."
,3htthe,2012-04-27T01:22Z,"You guys realize that even if it's official it would be foolish to call it ""The Last Airbender"" because there is no Last Airbender in Legend of Korra."
