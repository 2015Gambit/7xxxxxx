"" A bizarre, beautiful mutant tree is the seed from which author John Vaillant sprouts a fact-filled, immensely readable tale of logging and its impact in the Pacific Northwest.
It begins with a giant Sitka spruce growing on the Queen Charlotte Islands off the coast of British Columbia, Canada.
This nearly 200-foot-tall tree was covered in bright golden needles, “fantastically rare,” Vaillant writes: “From the ground, its startling color stopped people dead in their tracks; from the air, it stood out like a beacon and was visible from miles away.”
The Golden Spruce: A True Story of Myth, Madness and Greed tells of the life and death of that tree, which was cut down in 1997 by a disillusioned former logger. Like nonfiction writers John MacPhee or Jon Krakauer, Vaillant weaves facts into a compelling tapestry, with rich, layered prose, a fine eye for detail and a solid central theme he builds like a sturdy wood cabin. The Golden Spruce is a meditation on what the spruce itself meant, and a springboard for him to look at the conflict between man and nature in the Northwest.
