We start with five girls on display in a meat locker waiting to be inspected with hopes of being chosen as the next trainee. They all know that if picked they will go on to be trained and hopefully succeed in becoming an upper floor slave.

 Once the decision is made for the new trainee, she is taken to be cleaned, and prepped for her first day. It is apparent in the beginning that although she is what Mr. Acworth is looking for she is not even close to being a good slave. She needs a lot of work if she is going to become worthy of serving the House.

 The rest of the day is spent testing her on her abilities, talents, and evaluating her desire to serve. Now that we have set a foundation we can begin her training.
