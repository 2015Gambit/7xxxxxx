,petzl3000,2012-04-03T18:20Z,"You dont need subtitles, you freaks.  The Dothraki scene is 15 seconds tops.

HOWEVER, by watching this episode early, it means the next time you'll get a new episode is in TWO weeks, instead of one.   Trust me.  Don't do it.  Don't watch this episode!  (Btw, it's excellent.)"

It feels so good I may need to change my clothes."
,CrayC,2012-04-05T18:54Z,"The only downside to this, is the lack of translation from the Dothraki language to english. Otherwise perfectly watchable :-D"
,pecsam,2012-04-05T21:38Z,if u wnna see dothraki language go to addic7ed. com
,thiagoadecastro,2012-04-06T00:02Z,Good job! Thank you!!
,rofldinho,2012-04-06T01:47Z,"Doesn't have subtitles for Dothraki to English. 

Also has HBO GO logo throughout the episode, which I found distracting.

Good effort to release early for those who want it, but I will wait for the TV version as it doesn't have annoying logo or lack of subtitles."
,MadMaxxNZ,2012-04-06T02:56Z,this torrent is slow and not watchable on xbox 360 as is the same with most of this uploaders xvid torrents of late.
,Shaneyp00,2012-04-06T05:01Z,"MadMaxxNZ
Are you retarded?
get rid of your POS console and start watching shit from a media center (PC!!!)
Thats how you watch shit these days. Not thru a fuking kids video game console.
Download is good and real btw."
,pjmoney,2012-04-06T09:42Z,For some reason the pitch is high on the audio. Sounds really weird after watching the 11 previous episodes over the past 2 days and having the normal pitch firmly implanted in my brain.
,megz2608,2012-04-06T10:54Z,"Gagging to get n watch but then wot will I fill my hour with next week.. Live in UK and dont believe in paying 4 TV progs when I pay £100 + a year 4 a licence plus another £40 a month for high speed internet . I had to download all season one , in one go 6 months ago and now I very great full to th people who stick it on here as soon as its aired on HBO  . Lets hope I can get Breaking Bad season 5 just as fast. I lost about 10 nights sleep downloading and watching all 4 seasons of BB . max respect to every one who sticks these quality progs on here . I owe ya all a nice cold beer or a big fat dooby doo :D"
,SmartAssNigSimpathizer,2012-04-06T11:35Z,"This guy is a jerk. I know it sounds weird since he uploaded an awesome show early, but listen and it will make sense.
1. If he has access to this he probably could have access to them all if he put his mind to it and he hasn't...jerk
2. all you did was make me have to wait 2 weeks for a new one... jerk.
3.I'm pretty high and cant pay attention to it so i have to keep rewinding it and its ruining the effect of watching tv. I won't be high on Sunday when it was supposed to come out...jerk
4.If this continues every week to be put out a few days early then maybe he's just an early screener or whatever job would warrant an early copy. in which case, cool, ignore my high rant and please do this every week. If not though you are a real cocksucking jerk. Id beat you to sleep right now if i had you in front of me. I'd shoot you if i had a gun with me when i saw you. I'd commit felonious terroristic threatening on the internet if not "
,MadMaxxNZ,2012-04-06T11:40Z,"not retarded fuckface just cant be fuct watching on pc or upgrading just to watch this assholes bs xvid torrents ill just get them elsewhere, only posted for others who also use 360 to watch so they dont waste their time with this

Don't worry it'll only hurt for a minute then you'll get sleepy and take a nap."

,stinki,2012-04-09T03:12Z,"I keep seeing people say that if you watch this episode then we'll have to wait 2 weeks before s02e03.  Uh, I don't think so...

That's not how HBO GO works. This isn't the first show that has been given advance airings on HBO GO -- the entire last season of Bored To Death was, among others I'm sure.

S02E03 should be up on HBO GO tomorrow and on torrent sites shortly after, following the same pattern as this episode. Hope so."
,stinki,2012-04-09T03:41Z,"PS I love getting to watch the episode early, and it's decent quality, but the motion/framerate is a little jerky and detracts slightly from any scenes with a lot of movement. Not complaining, love it, but will re-download in better quality if I watch it again.."
