,angeklaw,2012-04-03T04:30Z,thanks for always having the shows i want almost immediately after they air and keeping the avi format!!
,Demon_Raho,2012-04-03T04:48Z,Ditto to what angeklaw said. Thank you very much.
,TsarB0mba,2012-04-03T05:24Z,"Thanks as always for the incrediby fast uploads, ettv, but I hope this doesn't signify a return to the antiquated lower-resolution xvid/avi rips as your go-to format. Most of my ettv RSS downloads are coming up in higher-res h264/mp4 first, so I hope this is just an anomaly."
,whatwhat97,2012-04-03T05:46Z,I don't see the link to download
,dahauk,2012-04-03T06:21Z,"@whatwhat97
the site is moving to mostly magnet links. suggest you check your download client to change your preferences to accept magnet links--"
