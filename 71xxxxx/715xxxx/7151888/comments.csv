,ergot66,2012-04-02T06:55Z,"WTF!!! 3 Straight weeks of Re-runs (ahem, I mean Compilations).  Shit, they only work a few weeks a year as it is, (if you want to call it work, looks like a great time to me!!!) One would think they could come up with more than a small handful of actual new material before wrapping up the series.  But that's just my opinion..."

,NomadJoe,2012-04-05T08:51Z,ergot66 you do not get to complain about the lack of work actors do when you don't pay for it.

lol , i agree with ergot , and I am the biggest Top Gear Fan the last season was great , but seemed so short , 
I have bought almost all of their seasons and specials , but am starting to get pissed off with the amount of episodes / content per season. It doesn't seem worth it to buy seasons anymore ,
Season 1 had 10 eps , up to about season 6 , then they went to a 7 episode format , wtf !
season 11 had 6 episodes and has been about 7 a season since then ."
