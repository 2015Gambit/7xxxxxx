,johhNyboi,2012-04-03T04:18Z,My whole upload bandwidth is on this torrent but it can be slow because the amount of leechers is damn too high. 
,ecrublrac0,2012-04-03T04:21Z,Is this in English!?
,T905marine,2012-04-03T04:36Z,"I think this is the same that got uploaded to demonoid. If that's the case, the video isn't really 720p and the sound is a bit off."
,Aximili,2012-04-03T05:21Z,It's totally legit.
,Aximili,2012-04-03T05:22Z,A/V 10/10
,QborT,2012-04-03T05:30Z,"The source was HBO GO streaming, it is legit but the quality isn't that good."
,El_Foosay,2012-04-03T05:33Z,I haven't d/l yet but it's prob legit. HBO did the same thing when true blood season premiered. showed the first two episodes on HBO Go. It'd make sense for them to do that on this premier to.
,foxx75,2012-04-03T06:55Z,"I downloaded it, real episode and English as well! 10/10 really worth it thx"
,alphazetabeta,2012-04-03T11:41Z,The video/audio is sped up. It makes the entire thing unwatchable.
,Froglet,2012-04-03T11:53Z,"Thanks dude. I will review and comment, when I have it all."
,Aromek,2012-04-03T14:13Z,Legit. Seeding.
,Froglet,2012-04-03T14:40Z,"Just watched enough to know that it is absolutely excellent.

,cazgrl,2012-04-03T15:15Z,fantastic THANK YOU! does anyone know if there have been subs made / to download anywhere? 
[V],wushdishmeen,2012-04-03T16:18Z,"Game of thrones airs a week earlier than the USA in Netherlands and Poland on HBO GO.  So this is real.  This isn't some promo and you cannot get this on USA version of HBO GO.  Australia also gets it a few days earlier than USA.  It's good quality too...not as good as the 720p HDTV rips but its still a sharp picture with perfect audio.

These should be posted every week if they keep grabbing from HBO GO."
,JtHih,2012-04-03T21:09Z,No fucking way! Thanks for uploading! :D
,mojowoikin,2012-04-07T12:38Z,"Thanks johhNyboi, 
The quality is good, just check the screen shots listed if you're unsure whether to download. It is as listed - the HBO GO Webrip and Getmedia ID's it as 1280x720p, 16:9, V = 3395 Kbps
There is only a short segment in Dothraki without subs, not essential to understanding the episode plot, and you can figure out most from the context. No other subs I've found yet, will have to wait for the TV release. 
Good one j, appreciate it!"
,mojowoikin,2012-04-07T12:43Z,"Also, there is no problem with the AV sync, or speed on this copy, it is right on."
,FRivera,2012-04-07T14:06Z,"Thank you, good sir. Excellent quality (v9 a9), quick DL and no sync or other issues whatsoever.

Power is power."
