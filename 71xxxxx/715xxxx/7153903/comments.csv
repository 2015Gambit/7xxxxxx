,fridych,2012-04-03T07:17Z,"I'm not sure what's happening, but each time I try to download any of your movies my utoreent window pops up showing no files available to download. It was never this way, but I don't even get a link to download the torrents like before. It now tries to use magnets. Can someone lead me the right way here? I only follow uploads by NLUPPER"
[V],NLUPPER002,2012-04-03T12:02Z,"When download it in your client wait a minute, whet it starts u see under files all the files.

On TPB u get no torrent file but a magnet link a little bit slower to load in the client, when loaded there is no difference."
,fridych,2012-04-04T03:23Z,"I wait and wait, but no files come up. Using utorrent and it says the size of the file is 0 B. When I do a search or just browse through your torrents I used to get a green arrow pointing down next to the magnet symbol under the link for each torrent, but now I don't get that green arrow for direct download (only on some older torrents). :-("
,fridych,2012-04-04T03:26Z,just in case this helps... the magnet link asks me to launch an application to open the link. That's when I choose utorrent and my client pops up showing 0B for the size of the file.
,fridych,2012-04-04T03:27Z,"If I'm doing something wrong, please let me know. Do I need a different client?"
,fridych,2012-04-04T03:29Z,it still shows file size 0B after waiting... I use utorrent. When I do a search or browse through your files I don't see the green arrow (next to magnet symbol I used to get) for direct download.
[H],Eppo,2012-04-04T12:50Z,"@fridych either update your client or get the newest utorrent, make sure your client supports magnet links. :)"
,teamholmez86,2012-04-05T19:17Z,"hi fridych im using frostwire 5.3.4 and it works great with magnet links, hope this helps ! :):)"
,johnysla,2012-04-08T20:52Z,"yet again another fake with pissy survey,wots the point ?"
,kvz,2012-04-09T19:42Z,audio video comment?
,COTT0NEYEDJOE,2012-04-10T18:46Z,@fridych you can no longer get direct links because it is now completely illegal that's why they use magnet links now and that is the reason you cant see the files with some bit torrent down loaders so you'll just have to put up with it
,cinderellex,2012-04-16T03:00Z,Cam. Bad quality. Certainly not worth the 4GB download.
,piizda,2012-04-20T14:33Z,"yess, piece of shit."
,Angookie,2012-04-29T19:59Z,"@fridych: The Pirate Bay now ONLY uses Magnet Links INSTEAD of .torrent (direct) downloads. (except for, like you said, a few really old ones)

This is so that they don't have to host any files AND to MAXIMIZE your download speed by offering ALL possible public trackers that are currently seeding the torrent.

When you use a magnet link in almost any torrent client, it gets added automatically.

Then it starts scraping all the trackers for seeders, then it downloads the list of files to download and starts downloading.

If you check your Sources tab under the download list, you'll see all of the trackers, and even soem seeders and leechers in the Peers tab.

It does, however, take a lot longer for a torrent to start this way, but I'd rather wait any where form as little as 30 seconds to 5 minutes in order to download a gigabyte in under 3 mins, then to wait over 10 if it started automatically using a .torrent.

.torrents usually only contain one or very few trackers, thus lowering the possibility of connecting to fast seeders and downloading a lot faster.

""If you wait, it will download."""
