Desc from Cogs official site:

Cogs is an award-winning puzzle game for the PC, iPhone, iPad, Mac and netbook. Immersed in a steampunk world with stunning visual design, Cogs players build an incredible variety of machines from sliding tiles. With 50 unique levels and three gameplay modes, we've packed in hours of entertaining, addictive fun.

This is my second upload from the Humble Bundle. From what I've seen playing the game, I would suggest a medium-high to high end device to run properly.

As with the last one, leave a comment down below if there are any problems.

Next I'm going to upload Avadon: Black Fortress
