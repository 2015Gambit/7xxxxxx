,justinrpg,2012-05-08T22:39Z,VIRUS!!!!! my AV detected a KeyDump Virus in this!!!!!!!
,viperprey,2012-05-18T14:08Z,really a keydump you mean a key dump for the illegal key they are giving you? yea i can see how that would be an issue 
,simplymuh,2012-06-25T21:11Z,Works perfect. No added shit. Just a straight up iso burn of a windows xp sp3 cd pre activated as advertised. Only question I hate is can I run the Genuine Validation Tool update or not? 
,mangkaw321,2012-07-24T15:05Z,can i use repair with this?
,Naveek,2012-09-23T01:22Z,"I want to ask before I install this, can I still create a username and password like I normally would in a legit Windows install? And as somebody else noted, will the genuine thing still be fine to use? And will it be safe to install updates on this? Sorry about all the questions, thanks for the torrent anyway."
