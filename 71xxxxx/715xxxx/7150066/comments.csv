,Ghayyurious,2012-04-02T11:11Z,"@karimbaraka, Gabranthh

@gkv_123
Give it a try but i can't guarantee u!
Newer version works fine on XP SP3.
Upgrade ur windows."
,sam_rock,2012-04-02T17:11Z,"@Ghayyurious, my last keys were for 9/29/2013 yours 4/xx/2013 and 8/xx/2013 might not be overriding them -_- everytime i apply your new keys i get fail alerts and shows my keys are valid till 9/29/2013 then on AV homescreen i see blank license -_-

for now i'm going into another AV till i can try Oct 2013 keys for this."
,Ghayyurious,2012-04-02T20:06Z,"@sam_rock
Did u try Uninstalling Avira?
If u did then uninstall it again and d'lod latest suite 4rm'ere.
http://www.avira.com/en/for-home-avira-internet-security
Then apply these keys.
Reason for getting in all this hassle is jst tht Avira is Totally worth it..None worthy of being a AV Except Avira..:)
Gud Luck.."
,sam_rock,2012-04-02T20:25Z,"yes that the first thing i did when the keys directly weren't working. upon installing it accepts the keys and i successfully install it. once it updates the license is discarded again :-/ i've been using Avira ever since i built this PC few years back and totally love this and installed Avira on every PC i have worked on. just can't run this at the moment -_-

thanx the upload anyway. i'll get back to it when i can find new keys!"

Read Instructions..!
All keys are Working Fine.."
,lucky87,2012-05-16T19:06Z,"my norton just expired today and could not find any keys for that so decided to give Avira a try. read all the comments on here and downloaded the program with the link Ghayyurious provided. then downloaded this torrent and got everything to work perfect on the first go.

Wanted to make clear something up for everybody else cuz i was confused for a second but figured i figured it out quickly. When you download the program from the link and it installs, you are not trying to copy and paste the key from notepad (or whatever program u use) into the program. if u open in notepad its all scrambled up. instead after the install, click ""i already have a key"" and it will allow you to browse for the file. then youre good to go. I restarted my computer and everything is good, it says activation good until 4/18/2013.

THANKS! +1"
,Seibehegen,2012-05-18T00:01Z,No 1 works!
