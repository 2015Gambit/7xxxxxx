It's VERY important that you BLOCK this program in your FIREWALL!

Block this range:
82.165.115.1  thru 82.165.115.255
in BOTH Inbound and Outbound Rules.

ALSO BLOCK the PROGRAM in your Firewall because sooner or later this program ""phones home"" and IF your s/n is not valid, it not only DISABLES the program, it kills many other of your favorite programs!

YE have been warned!

in Win 7 Firewall?
I can configure for the program only.

,geek4real,2012-09-12T18:36Z,"@helob01: Go into your advanced firewall settings.  Create a new incoming rule.  Select ""custom.""  Click next until you get to the SCOPE options click Add (Remote location) 
from 82.165.115.1
to 82.165.115.255

Click OK and Next

Then, in the ACTION options, make sure you click BLOCK!

Name it and save.

Create another rule for Outgoing connections exactly the same way."

Seems they have another range, as I'm getting mine blocked."
