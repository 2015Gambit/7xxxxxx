Narratives:

One of several C-86-style indie pop projects involving GlasgowÆs ôLazö McCluskey, Strawberry Whiplash is primarily a collaboration between McCluskey and vocalist Sandra. Deriving their name from the bands Strawberry Switchblade and Meat Whiplash, the duo formulated a sweet, reverb-kissed sound that nodded to acts like Tiger Trap, Heavenly, and Black Tambourine.
ItÆs strange to think that Hits in the Car is truly the debut record for Strawberry Whiplash. Regardless, this collection of thirteen great pop tunes is pretty spot-on for a debut, going between infectious indie pop and noisy janglings; its all worth every minute of timeà
