,rozitg,2012-04-02T22:04Z,Not at this time. This version is the only one that I can find on warez.

http://www.hbogo.pl/#/Media/528ee054-2d2b-41ad-9c17-65a98d07c72b;815c5839-a4d3-4059-9535-507fa9020992;c8679702-be4d-4235-b56b-8f1faa33eaee

it is possible to watch episode 2 in original language ... just need to wait for someone to rip it. I hate lector voice, so I wait as well. 
Quality of this VOD sucks btw"

[V],wushdishmeen,2012-04-03T16:21Z,"Game of thrones airs a week earlier than the USA in Netherlands and Poland on HBO GO.  So this is real.  This isn't some promo and you cannot get this on USA version of HBO GO.  Australia also gets it a few days earlier than USA.  It's good quality too...not as good as the 720p HDTV rips but its still a sharp picture with perfect audio.

Only problem is there are no hardcoded or external subs for the dothraki segments.  Luckily in this episode its only a few lines of dialogue but if there are any episodes like the first episode after this one you could be missing a lot of dialogue.  So probably best to wait for HDTV version.

But these should continue to be posted early every week if they keep grabbing from HBO GO."
