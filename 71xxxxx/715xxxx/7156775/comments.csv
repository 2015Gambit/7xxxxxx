,Team_Rockstar,2012-04-03T18:54Z,"@ raja123456kumar , look on YIFY's website ( yify-torrents.com ) ,, you will find 720p in 700 mb .. It is on TPB too , link : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7156529/Mission_Impossible_Ghost_Protocol_(2011)_720p_BrRip_750MB_YIFY"
,sun2244,2012-04-03T19:48Z,is this 2c or 6c audio?
,dandalis,2012-04-03T21:32Z,PLZ SEED after download
,fofo141,2012-04-03T22:34Z,"Thank you so much YIFY Team 
and special thanks to Sundox"
,Rex0n,2012-04-03T23:35Z,"Holy fucking shit, a lot of people don't seed, or they have really crappy internet"
,alphamale007,2012-04-04T00:16Z,"My speeds are really crap, but will still seed when done. Mega thanks YIFY."
,theeccentrik,2012-04-04T03:40Z,"DL'ing at 45kb/s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No thanks m8."
,samjnr,2012-04-04T09:47Z,"V-10
A-6.
Firstly Why is it titled 1080p when it runs at 64kbps on my sony BD player? Most genuine 1080p rips run above 300 as a retail bluray approx 2.5mbps+. it's a basic bdrip guys.
Secondly the audio is awful, muffled and had to stop after 5 minutes.
Thanks anyway for the up but whoever chose/sync'd the audio needs to be hanged!"
,sun2244,2012-04-04T10:47Z,"V10

this is terrible 2 c audio, would be nice to make it 5.1 at about 1.6GB total. 
Thanks anyway, i like the video so i will try to mux it with audio from another download."
,Munchkinpuncher,2012-04-04T10:48Z,Your the best Yify.
,sam_rock,2012-04-04T12:14Z,thanx for upload but geez downloading very slow -_-
,windowsxp02,2012-04-04T12:44Z,"Thanks Yify +1

,Ratedadorable,2012-04-04T18:05Z,hey yify UR da man yar Lagay raho
,dandalis,2012-04-04T21:32Z,"expected more from u YIFY, but not so bad. 8/10 and +1"
,Infenix13,2012-04-05T14:23Z,Does this work on PS3s?
,Killajeebus,2012-04-05T23:41Z,"Dude Amazing!!!
Thanks YIFY."
,tofushoyu,2012-04-05T23:54Z,Thank you YIFY! +1
,Infenix13,2012-04-06T18:43Z,"doesnt work on ps3, is too quick and fast forwards"
,Alexnader78,2012-04-06T19:09Z,"@Infenix13 LMAO, also played through PS3 directly, I thought it might just be me. Sounds like everything is x2 speed: picture moves really fast and everybody has a high pitched voice.

This can be fixed by going to options and putting ""slow (forward)"", but then it all seems a bit stuttery (audio&video).

Works perfectly in VLC though. Too bad."
,aP1LGR1M,2012-04-06T23:17Z,"Well...this was bandwidth wasted...kinda makes the 1080p resolution pointless for those planning to run this on a PS3 - the rip is totally f***** in a sense that the movie runs at what i think is x2 the normal speed.
For those who are going to watch this on a lap top / computer the A/V is a 10.
For others..it's.....crap."
,Obiwancanblome69,2012-04-07T02:29Z,"Hey YIFY thanks alot you nigger lovin asshole for not hard coding any of the foreign language parts (RUSSIAN) to English subs.  FUCK YOU AND FUCK ALL THE SHIT QUALITY ""HD"" FILMS YOU UPLOAD THEY ARE 99% PIXELATED.  DON'T PUT THEM IN HIGHRES!!!!!!!!!!!   And all of you guys who are on YIFY's dick fuck your retarded asses too."
,ajnsd,2012-04-07T05:36Z,"@YIFY, Thanks brada -- much love from SoCal! Downloaded in 26 minutes. Not bad, considering size of file and low number of seeders. 

As for @Obiwancanblome, this dude is seriously upset! He must be the only bro on earth paying for torrents. Either that or he's constipated. After all, the shit is free for fucksake. "
,Obiwancanblome69,2012-04-07T20:42Z,Hey if your going to do this shit the point is do it right!
,noesgiron,2012-04-08T00:41Z,"Great movie, and i have a cuestion, did you have the spanish dub for this movie? if you have it could you please upload it? regards."
