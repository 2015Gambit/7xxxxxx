,TheGuyWhoGetsLucky,2012-04-07T23:39Z,Great file. Works perfectly.

,NexiumCore,2012-04-29T00:11Z,Yep! That's why I made it in the first place.
,pick999,2012-05-22T03:26Z,"Thanks a lot for this collection, please dont scrap this project. Its very useful to have all the versions in one installer :)
You have planned the minecraft server collector pack? Or i can make with the newest server files old minecraft servers? im new on it."

,NexiumCore,2012-05-24T05:20Z,I will be updating the app in a few days to reflect the new development releases.
