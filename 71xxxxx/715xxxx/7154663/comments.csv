,bluecar5556,2012-04-07T17:25Z,"04-07-12, availability is 0.28%, I dont think initial seeding was checked so the seeders will have to stay a while to get to 100.00% available.  Stay awhile guys and kick your shoes off because it's free.  Thank you anonymous for the hard work!"

,supermaltese,2012-06-25T17:56Z,"Just wondering Deus, if you made this one capable of NOT needing the dvd's in the drive/virtual drive.  A crack for that would be super sweet!!!"
,supermaltese,2012-06-25T17:56Z,It's almost $100 for 10pkg of 8.5 GB DRD+R!!
,supermaltese,2012-06-25T18:02Z,"Another thought I had, I don't know how to program, but I suppose it would be possible to write a script to automatically unmount previous DVD and mount new DVD into virtual DVD drive without me having to manually tell it to.  Ya know, connect it to the scan disk button (c.f. AllData 9.4) or to ""autoplay"" feature built into windows.  Thanks"
,supermaltese,2012-06-25T21:24Z,"As thrilled as I am to see 10.40 available via magnet, I am sad to say, I won't be downloading it for a while because my little ol' 500 GB HDD only has like 170 free Gigs.  Not that I can't delete some stuff, but hey, what can I say, I collect software...  for now, I have to encourage anyone who is in the same boat as myself, to please seed the 9.4 which is only 83 GB.  Thanks"
,grippin,2012-06-30T00:04Z,"For those wanting to import the data disks here is how you do that:

Extract all disks into a separate folder for each. ie

C:DataDomesticdisk 1
C:DataDomesticdisk 2
C:DataDomesticdisk 3

ect.

Once you have done this, open the program and click on Data then on Devices.

you will now see the Device Setup window. Click connect and within that window you will click the C: Drive and then enter in the data path for each disk excluding C: so the path will look like this:   DataDomesticdisk 1 

Once you have done this for each disk the software will no longer prompt for you to enter in a disk whenever you want to look up a vehicle. i hope this helps and wasnt too confusing."
,grippin,2012-06-30T00:06Z,"for some reason it took out the back slashes. sorry for that.

examples should look like this

c: data domestic disk 1

where there is a space there is a back slash.

let me know if this does or doesnt help"

,grippin,2012-06-30T18:51Z,"EMNAVARRO: Do not run any of the files within the data disks. Once you install the software with the provided crack, follow the directions i posted above your comment for each data disk you want the software to use."
,EMNAVARRO,2012-07-01T23:38Z,"GRIPPIN: Thanks for the response....

Background :
OS : Windows 7 home premium
done : downloaded the file ALDATA_10.40.ISO

Question: 
1.How can I install the program (ALLDATA) without running the setup.exe file? As per your instruction, you dont have to run any file from the data disk. 

2. How to apply the crack file if the installer (setup-.exe) immediately reported an error?

Waiting for futher instruction. Thanks"
,andy_sur13,2012-07-02T05:56Z,Hi I need install cd for Alldata 10.50 with crack
,grippin,2012-07-02T14:51Z,"EMNAVARRO: what i did was extract the Aldata_10.40.iso (74.4meg) to a folder on my desktop. (i know there are 2 of them but you only need one.) run the setup and let it go through the setup. once finished, do not run ALLDATA yet. locate the location where it installed on your C: drive. Now go to the Crack folder and copy the 2 files in it and paste and replace the ones in the main ALLDATA install folder. Now you can open it without a problem.

Hope this helps."
,EMNAVARRO,2012-07-03T08:45Z,"Grippin:

Again thanks for the response.

What i did is the same as what you have done by extracting the Aldata_10.40.iso (74.4meg) to a folder on my desktop. Upon running the setup.exe file I immediately encounter the error message. Probably I will try to download again the said file (aldata_10.40.iso). I will let you know what will be the outcome.
