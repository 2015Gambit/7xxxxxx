Biology: Life on Earth [9th Edition] Chapters 1-30 (ALL CHAPTERS)

There are a total of 30 chapters.

Scans are 300dpi and in color. PDF format. Only the chapters have been scanned, not any pre-text garbage or table of contents, glossary, appendix,  etc.

Please seed, thanks. :)	

Note: 1 page got a little wonky in chapters 23 and 24, it's still readable, but it didn't align correctly, sorry about that!	

Anyways, if you would be so kind as to read the README file, I'd appreciate it, 600 pages of scanning one by one took a long time. <3
