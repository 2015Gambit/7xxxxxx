,firaskalam,2012-05-15T11:31Z,"why u say all  chapeter  if is ee  the books is far big   still ,"
,sissor,2012-05-29T00:20Z,"@firaskalam - I'm not even sure what you're trying to communicate to me. The reason why I say ""all chapters"" is because some people might not know that chapters 1-30 is all the chapters contained within the book. If you haven't read the book before how would you know how many chapters there are to begin with? 

That's why I say all chapters are included. There is no chapter 31, it doesn't exist the book ends after 30."

If not, then do you know where I could find a copy with physiology?
Either way, thanks for the upload!"
,juveed94,2012-08-14T23:32Z,"Hey, does this version of the text book have physiology as well? If not, do you know where I could find it?
Either way, thanks for the upload!"
,sissor,2012-08-20T08:22Z,@juveed94 - No. This is not the physiology edition.
,sissor,2012-08-20T08:29Z,"@juveed94 - I have no idea where you could find that edition, sorry. Unless you want to buy one off of amazon or something. Haven't found any free ones, that's why I got this one and uploaded it in the first place."
