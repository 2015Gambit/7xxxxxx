I know it's not a good behavior to talk about other torrents here, but I can't find a way to make sure you see this. Do you still have DVDs for Star Trek TNG? Could you please rip those extras on S1 and S2 with subtitles? Those extras are very good but there are no good quality versions and few subtitles for them.

Thanks in advance and, apologize for saying those on this torrent's comments."
,inkyon,2012-04-03T09:20Z,is it your first take on a blu ray rip and would you consider to give the tutorial guide to rip a blu ray?
[V],meech,2012-04-04T01:29Z,"mrxff: No problem about mentioning other torrents.  If you were linking to someone else's torrent(s), then it might matter...but no worries here.  Unfortunately, I don't think I will be ripping and encoding the TNG extras.  I don't generally do extras as most don't seem interested and/or may not download, thus killing the ""extra's"" torrent.  Plus it can be kind of tedious depending on how many extras there are.  My apologies.  I won't say 100% no.  I do have the DVDs right now, so I won't rule it out altogether.  But currently I'm working on some movies as well as Dr. Who 2005."

check this torrent:
.../torrent/6129103
the extra's are in mkv with x264 not sure about the audio I think it's ac3 stereo. The rest of that torrent (the episodes) is a crappy avi encoded with divx3 avoid it.
meech tanks again for a good rip."
,ili2882,2012-04-05T13:27Z,"sorry if my previous post was out of line, I respect your work, but I also wanted the extras and downloaded them some time ago they're not up to ""meech"" quality but are good.
btw when is the next batch of shows coming?"
,mrxff,2012-04-09T10:02Z,"@ili2882, I've tried that torrent but unfortunately they don't have subtitles included, but the quality is indeed fair. The subtitles for those extras are difficult to find... although ripping them would be very easy.

Anyway, thanks, and are we talking about another torrent again...?"
