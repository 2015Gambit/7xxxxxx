Run ""World of Warcraft Beta Launcher.exe"" from inside that folder. 

Note, you need BETA-acess to login to the actual test-realms, or the realms will be marked red."

For instant access to the file, just friend me there.  Also, there have been many updates since this build, the launcher will still need to add around a 1gb of data."

when I try to log in into the realm I get the message ""connected"" but nothing happen.
BTW how do you update the beta since I click on launcher but it stuck at updating set up file"
