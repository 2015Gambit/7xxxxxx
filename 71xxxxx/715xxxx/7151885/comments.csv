,angelcure,2012-04-03T02:38Z,Thank you so much!

Excellent quality otherwise. The only complaint I've ever been able to make about ettv's torrents are that they contain more than just the video file so I end up having to go delete all that crap once I'm done seeding. But I can deal with that to get high quality AVIs since eztv and VTV have started focusing on MP4s which PS3 Media Server hates for some reason."
