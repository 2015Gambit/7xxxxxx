[T],scuba-doo,2012-04-04T15:22Z,"@TheHairyCat 

this does not contain a virus you halfwit ... and it is indeed a false positive. The .exe was compresed using UPX compression packer (UPX is an open source software compression packer) ... this is also used by some malware and hence gets flaged by shitty AV programs... take an example from ljbrew and use a normal AV program...

check it with virustotal.com and tell me how many flag it?? no many"
