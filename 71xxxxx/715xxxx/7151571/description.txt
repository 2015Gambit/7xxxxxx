Perhaps the most famous of all the Look And Read stories. The Boy From Space was first shown in 1971; although made in colour its first broadcast was in black and white. In 1980 the film inserts were repackaged and could be seen in their full glory. Wordy presented from his space probe, WordLab 1, with his assistant Cosmo. 
  
So who was this boy from space? He was Peep-Peep, named by the two children who discover him, Dan and Helen. He's crashed to earth after the Thin Space Man tries to steal Peep-Peep's father's meteorite collection. Soon Dan and Helen and taken hostage by The Thin Man aboard the space ship. Helen was played by a very young Sylvestra le Touzel, with Stephen Garlick as Dan.
