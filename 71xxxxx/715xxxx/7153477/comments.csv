[V],TorrentTracts,2012-04-02T22:21Z,"Bishop Noel Jones, TD Jakes, Mahesh Chavda, and John Bevere is a tall order for me to fill.  As I only have Bishop Noel Jones's 2007 release of ""Welcome To The City.""  And three titles for TD Jakes including, ""1996 - Woman Where Art Loose"", ""2004 - He Motions"" and another undated release simple entitled ""The Ministry Of TD Jakes.""  I have no idea what any of it is, but if any of it still sounds interesting to you, please let me know."
