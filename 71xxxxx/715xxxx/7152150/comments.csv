,gacgirl,2012-04-02T06:47Z,"@RealPirateGhost - It must be on your end. Sure, ettv isn't as fast as eztv can be, but they're growing with EZTV's recent switch to all x264 formats and ETTV providing a good majority of the avi's a lot of us still watch. 

Thanks for this, ettv! Lately, I've been getting most, if not all, of my tv shows from you!"
,STAY-AT-HOME-GAMER,2012-04-02T06:58Z,thanks ettv
,BBfan,2012-04-02T07:18Z,"Thanks, I can't stand x264. So I always get from you guys!"
,ecchiless,2012-04-02T09:59Z,"@gacgirl

eztv doesnt encode nothing, they only upload the files, besides h264/x264 has been out for a lot of time, some ppl say is the future but guess what is the present(was the future 6 years ago) divx/xvid(h263 actually) cant improve anymore, so is natural for the groups to change to h264/x264 for better quality/size wise(anime/movie groups have been using x264 for a while now: 4-5 years), plus a lot of lcd, plasma, led tv's can reproduce mp4/mkv files with out problems.

Anyway is not eztv ""fault"" is just how the encoders decide to work, plus with google u can always search how to re-encode a h264 file to h263. "
,mojowoikin,2012-04-02T12:36Z,"Thanks ettv! I guess if XviDavi's are considered old school by some, then I'll gladly be a Luddite. In consideration of file size, compatibility and quality, this is a choice download. dl speed for me was around 200 Kbps, but I'm on high speed lite. I appreciate it. Keep 'em comin"
,XONi49,2012-04-02T18:48Z,".264 codec is not the issue here the codec has nothing to do with the file extension as .264 can be used in avis too the main issue here is that most people that are downloading files to play on tvs and media players that will not use mp4 or mkv files  

if they are saying .264 is the future why not use the most popular containers to distribute it so that everyone will get on the bandwagon 

if you dont believe me .264 can be used in avis download a new encoder and see for your self    4videosoft has been able to do it for at least a year now"
,punkhell,2012-04-02T20:41Z,AWESOME!!!!!
,angelcure,2012-04-03T00:06Z,Thank you so much ettv! I also have been getting all my files from you lately!
,ecchiless,2012-04-03T00:26Z,"@xoni

cause the avi container is not rly your best option for h264 files, header problems, audio limitations, etc, plus the fact that avi is quite old, and about the most popular container well i would say that 90% of my stuff is packed in mkv, so for me mkv is the more ""popular"". 

For not means i wanna say that ppl should use or buy stuff that support mkv/mp4 containers, i just wanna say that the encoders have the final word, so if they think that x264/h264 packed in mp4/mkv or divx/xvid avi  is better i dont gonna complaint, i can easily convert from ts, m2t or any other hd format to h264/x264 mkv/mp4(cmd for the win :3) so if u dont find ur serie/movie in xvid just download the mp4/mkv and download any converter here in the piratebay ^^"
,ecchiless,2012-04-03T00:28Z,"@xoni 

since the begining we can use x264 in avi, here a post of why ppl dont used it http://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?t=34490 the post is from 2006, so like u can see x264 in avi is not new and not the best choice ^^

Cheers and enjoy the game of thrones great series o/"
