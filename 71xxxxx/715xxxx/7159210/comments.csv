[V],psspss,2012-04-05T10:11Z,"http://www.tv.com/shows/bomb-patrol-afghanistan/

and tvrage listings all say these are S01 still

if it was season 2 you would expect it to be a new crew

new locations counting down the tour days before they
head home ...

bit its good to see the stuff they didnt add in S01
with extras"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-06T07:50Z,"Noticed you got that audio aligned on interleaves and stepped up the xvid profile. *thumbsup*

So when ya gonna hook up an HD box to your PC and start capping some UK gems for everyone?"
[V],psspss,2012-04-07T04:38Z,"align seems to happen randomly I dont see a option
in any coder to fix that... maybe its the profile

anyhow this encoder seems to throw ps/2 for some reason..

maybe its bvops of more then 1 that throws it but then
the quality suffers if reduce them..

i find it odd the aviddmux beta does have L5?

anyhow can coverted to ps2 with umile encoder 3.x its very fast and free"
[V],psspss,2012-04-07T04:39Z,does not i mean
[V],psspss,2012-04-07T04:45Z,"im not in UK either or uSA

i might cap some local things from downunder
but generally can find on web in streams somewhere"
