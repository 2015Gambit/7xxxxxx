,SimonGarfunkel,2012-08-18T02:10Z,"Could you please tell me who is singing in the track #10? (St. Matthew Passion - Erbarme dich mein Gott) That would be great, and even better if you could tell me who is accompanying! I HAVE to know who made such a wonderful tune!
Also, great torrent, I recommend everyone to download this one."

That would be soprano Ibolya Verebics and the Hungarian State Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Geza Oberfrank.

The tags on the re-rips (that is not on the bay as of yet) contains this info about the tracks :) Also sent to Gracenote, so if you want you could now update the tags should you want. Else, wait for the re-rips."
