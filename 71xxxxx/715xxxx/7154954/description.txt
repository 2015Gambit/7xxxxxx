SYNOPSIS:  
The sexual chemistry between Depression-era drifter Frank Chambers (John Garfield) and sexy, smoldering roadside cafe waitress Cora (Lana Turner) is so hot that theyll do anything to keep the fire lit -- even if it means killing Coras husband. Although the sex scenes were watered down to conform to industry standards, this classic based on an original story by author James M. Cain was still considered shocking for its time.
