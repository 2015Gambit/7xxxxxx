,pxpierre,2012-04-03T20:45Z,Thanks to sceneline and seeders!
,Ryzoz,2012-04-03T23:27Z,"THANK YOU SCENELINE

Finally, someone willing to upload SBK!

Will be seeding for a while unlimited."
,pxpierre,2012-04-04T06:33Z,"Sceneline seed please!!!

Sceneline, looking at Peers in uTorrent, we are 40 people stuck @ 91% and there are ZERO seeders."
,Ryzoz,2012-04-04T14:46Z,"PLEASE SEED,

This is the only SBK torrent out there, come on guys. I can't even finish mine and I am unlimited upload!"
,pxpierre,2012-04-04T18:59Z,"@ Ryzoz: it seems we said thanks above too fast. I've been trying to download this torrent since 14 hours and I am stuck at 91.1%.

It seems that sceneline is peddling his spped.cd paying site as you can see in the description above where he charges $10 to get access to private tackers.

In my uTorrent client, under the Trackers tab, I can see Downloaded: 0. Meaning nobody managed to complete a download so far. If you look under the Peers tab, there is nobody who got more than 91.5% of the files after more than 14 hours so far. Conclusion sceneline does not seed his torrent, looks like spam for his site. ;-( BTW my upload ratio is 1.1 at the present."
,Ryzoz,2012-04-04T20:13Z,Wow... scene line you douche bag.

,pxpierre,2012-04-05T06:29Z,"Yes!! Thanks MKL37, I can see 6 seeders at the present in your torrent.

Fuck this one."
,racer224,2012-04-22T06:51Z,"I do HATE Deadbeat UL'ers.

PB should delete this torrent, the original UL'er obviously has no intention of actually seeding the last 8 percent to the community."
,racer224,2012-04-22T06:51Z,And a Big THANKS to MKL37 for providing a link to a QUALITY torrent.

,Roadie55,2012-09-24T03:43Z,"Thanks for the up....but please seed. I am stuck at 91.0%.
