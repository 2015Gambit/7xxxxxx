A lion escapes Nick Coster's (Humphrey Bogart) carnival and is captured by grocery clerk Matt Varney (Eddie Albert) whom Nick brings into the show and eventually makes chief lion tamer. When Nick finds out Matt has fallen for his convent-bred sister Mary he makes him go into the cage with the insane lion Caesar. Great Entertainment!
