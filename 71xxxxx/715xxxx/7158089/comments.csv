Synopsis

   How did the table fork acquire a fourth tine?  What advantage does the Phillips-head screw have over its single-grooved predecessor? Why does the paper clip look the way it does? What makes Scotch tape Scotch?

   In this delightful book Henry, Petroski takes a microscopic look at artifacts that most of us count on but rarely contemplate, including such icons of the everyday as pins, Post-its, and fast-food ""clamshell"" containers.  At the same time, he offers a convincing new theory of technological innovation as a response to the perceived failures of existing productsâ&#x20AC;&#x201D;suggesting that irritation, and not necessity, is the mother of invention."
