,tssio,2012-04-04T00:18Z,please seed... quality???
,soyahoy,2012-04-04T03:11Z,"Its a mixup of various encodes.  The last three are crap ""DLBR"" are useless they seem to re-encode already re-encoded episodes a 3rd/4th time so they can stick their watermark on it which does nothing but cause artifacts and lowers the overall quality.  The FLV has been taken from a video streaming site and is even worse quality. The first 7 are okay but you can find them in other torrents. "

,tflagger997,2012-04-05T01:44Z,"Lame.  The last two are 480p!  

People you need to learn to pay attention to your file list as you start the download.  I expect to be called a trash talker, but you can DL this for 10 seconds, see the proof, and cancel the torrent."
[T],bzingaz,2012-04-05T14:10Z,@tflagger997 ..u r a moron that's for sure ..but question is of what kind..talked trash but didn't cared to look on video specs given which clearly indicates video resolution is 704*400 which is 480p..so not only last 2 episodes the whole season is 480P..i never said it is 720p..but again quality is good..so bottom line is u r a moron and my torrent quality is good..as always..
[T],bzingaz,2012-04-05T14:16Z,@tflagger997 u are trying to be a smart ass..but u r not..the last 2 file name show's 480p but that means they have been ripped from 480p..and hello mr. smart pants..the rest of episodes show 720P in their names but that means their source were 720p files..no body needs to be a scientist to guess that a original 720p single file of this time interval will be around 2 gb  and original 480P will be around 1.2 gb..what i am providing is ripped h264 mkv format whose source is either 480p or 720p files..know your role and shut your mouth..
