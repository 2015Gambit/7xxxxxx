,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-06T11:32Z,"if you do the steps from the readme.txt file this torrent will work for you, i tested all my torrents."
,Is_Purple,2012-04-12T21:45Z,"I cant get this to install.
When I run it it keeps trying to install Adobe 10.2. The Adobe thing then says this is not the newest ver of Adobe then the installation terminates."
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-13T14:49Z,"I suggest to you to unistall your adobe flash player software from your computer and all its registry (using ccleaner or whatever you want) and now try to reinstall the product. Your computer need to be 'clean' from any other newest adobe flash player files because oldest version will say 'you have installed a newest version' or 'this version is oldest than the version installed on your pc'... Try it, it may help you if problem persist a PM via Suprbay or comment... have a nice day bro:P"
,Paulinate,2012-04-19T05:36Z,What a freaking bust. I uninstalled everything adobe on my computer and ccleaned the whole thing. Still getting the same adobe message the other dude is. Really just wasted a couple hours of my life
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-19T22:04Z,try with another setup but you will see the problem persist..... adobe flash playyer v10 with active-x is included in installation files and needed by nero 11 installed on your computer... if you want or not you need to have installed in your computer flash player 10 with active-x....
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-19T22:06Z,this setup is the original published by nero... i don't modify it...
,Crash2701,2012-04-29T06:51Z,This is fucking BIG TIME BULLSHIT! Ain't working at all. Get your fact's straight.
,xk3nvel0x,2012-05-14T15:23Z,"it works depends what operating system you use..... i repeat the setup it's the original one from nero website.... in fact, a few days ago i re-install operating system on my laptop (windows 7 ultimate) and i install thie version of nero because i saw bad comments here... for me worked very well (and i don't have flash player installed on it, and nero need it), no flash player install error or something appeared... i tested it on windows 7 home premium (on my pc) and ultimate (on my laptop) and worked... but on a another computer with windows 7 it say error when trying to install flash player 10 because the version old now, i recommend to you if you see this to remove all flash player installed on your pc and also remove all registry entires about adobe, and try to reinstall nero... it must working now.."
,xk3nvel0x,2012-05-14T15:25Z,"after the setup finish the install process, re-install adobe flash player on your pc..."
,dditty,2012-06-13T07:18Z,"Thanks for the upload, everything works great.  Not a big deal at all, but is it possible to prevent these (http://i.imgur.com/YsElA.jpg) from popping up every time i want to use Nero MediaHub?"
