,neumar2000,2012-06-12T01:33Z,"I don't know if it is the movie, but the audio is... I can't explain, wierd? Example: about 1:03:20, when the guy says ""must be the ghost of Madeleine"" sounds like the audio is ""shaking"" and it's difficult to hear what he says. My speakers almost jump off the ground during this part! I'll dl another version to compare later.

So far:

V:10

Thanks!"
