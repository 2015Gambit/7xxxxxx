EVERY single episode, as of March 31, 2012, of Ben 10, Alien Force, and Ultimate Alien, as well as all eight Ben 10 Shorts (Speeded Out doesn't exist; it's probably a hoax, or goes by another name) all four movies, and the Ben 10 + Generator Rex: Heroes United special. Some of the episodes glitch slightly, but most of them are as close to perfection as humanly possible.

All episodes were recorded by Cartoon World and Cartoon Palace, and are from my personal collection.
