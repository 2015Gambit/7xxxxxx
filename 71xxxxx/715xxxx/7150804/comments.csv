,Intellectual_BA,2012-04-01T19:25Z,This is just my way of giving back to the TPB users who posted the original torrents [that I got these from] in the first place.
,Intellectual_BA,2012-04-03T01:11Z,"Sorry, I just did some research, and ""Speeded Out"" is on Ben 10 Planet, the Ben 10 wiki. However, the same wiki says that it is the third Ben 10 Shorts episode (having originally broadcast on February 7, 2008), when the second short (Snack Break) broadcast on February 27.  So it's basically saying that Speeded Out broadcasted 20 days before the episode that came before it.

,Intellectual_BA,2012-04-20T21:09Z,"Don't forget to vote on the OVERALL quality. I want to know whether or not they work properly, so I can know if I uploaded them correctly. But DON'T vote until you've checked every episode from a particular series. Fast-forwarding (NOT skipping) might help."
,sunny_bhai,2012-05-02T18:39Z,"Please Seed guys, I can't download it in high-speed. 
Download speed is too slow....i will seed for a month if download."
,Intellectual_BA,2012-05-19T23:15Z,"I'm going to say this as politely as I possibly can, and I am going to rant:

ABSOLUTELY NO trolling on this page. We've got enough people killing themselves over internet assholes bullying anyone with an opposing viewpoint. You know who you are."
,Intellectual_BA,2012-05-19T23:18Z,"Those of you who intend to gang up on me for being a ""goody-goody"" are part of the problem, NOT the solution! If I were such a goody-goody boyscout, I wouldn't be engaging in piracy, now would I? I just don't like seeing people needlessly making fun of others for something that's really not funny. It's just sad, depressing even."
,Intellectual_BA,2012-05-19T23:19Z,"If someone does troll and another person points out their issues, those of you thinking of saying something like ""Ooh, burn,"" or anything of that sort, just smile to yourself and laugh in the privacy of whatever location you are using your computer or smartphone at. There's no need to throw logs into the flames of the dark furnaces that are these jerks' hearts."
,Intellectual_BA,2012-05-19T23:32Z,"As for the matter of reporting repeat offenders, any POLITE help would be greatly appreciated.

By the way, though I'm not too good on common sense (an ironic misnomer, as it is not so common anymore), I AM a member of Phi-Theta-Kappa, so I am by no means a ""dumb-ass.""

For those of you who don't know, PTK is basically a nationwide honors society for community college students. To qualify, one must have an average GPA of around 4.00.
PTK membership is by invitation only, so I've obviously earned it, through intelligence, hard work, and perseverance."
,darkscale,2012-05-28T05:41Z,"Intellectual: you should probably also point out that your clique is most likely in the USA, and being in  a clique really doesn't impress a lot of us. Some of us here never actually made it to college or its equivalent in other countries. Also you should note that for some of us, college was not a requirement when we started out in life. I was able to do just fine without any degrees in the computer field and made it far as analyst/programmer/tester. Just on High School and barely that."
,Intellectual_BA,2012-05-31T02:36Z,"darkscale: Sorry about that. I just don't like people insulting others' intelligence -knowing next to nothing about it- simply because they disagree with their opinion.
It really, really irritates me.

I realize that there are those who are able to find good, well-paying work without a college degree, and that there are also those with four-year degrees who still can't find work. And yes, as far as I know, PTK is limited to the U.S.

My point is that I was invited to join because of good grades, hard work and perseverance."
