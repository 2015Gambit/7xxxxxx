,QborT,2012-04-03T05:56Z,"The quality of the REFiLL rip is better.  Good up Dibya.

And for all those that will undoubtedly question, yes it is real the source was HBO GO."

[V],wushdishmeen,2012-04-03T16:16Z,"Game of thrones airs a week earlier than the US in Netherlands and Poland on HBO GO.  So this is real.  It's good quality too...not as good as the 720p HDTV rips but its still a sharp picture with perfect audio.

These should be posted every week if they keep grabbing from HBO GO."
,djnero,2012-04-03T23:09Z,thanks =)

,CakeMonster,2012-04-05T12:18Z,"Theis is real

AND

You Turkeys who have problems with the video quality, use Splash Lite player, it is a free player that is free and fixes many problems for many videos."
,karih1,2012-04-05T16:15Z,"
The quality is not as good as the first episode, even though both are in 720p.

And if you have good eyes then you can spot a little stuttering. You'll especially notice it in the opening scene."
,karih1,2012-04-05T16:28Z,"@CakeMonster

I just tried the Splash Lite Player and it fixed the stuttering, thanks =)

Although the only difference I could see with some other videos were that there was more color in Splash Player"
,Rawbrry,2012-04-05T18:30Z,"Video/Audio is sped up.  Very noticeable and detrimental to the quality of the viewing experience.  Same is true of the other uploads of this rip.  Thank you for the upload Dibya, but regardless I recommend waiting for a better quality episode."
,CakeMonster,2012-04-06T02:06Z,"@karih1 

When there is a problem use splash lite player

ALSO

Sometimes in sci fi movies and things with many computer animated stuff then in VLC things can slow down it is not rendered properly this is especially visible in 1080p that is where splash lite should be used

And I know that this torrent is fantasy and 720p I was just explaining where splash lite can and should be used :)"
,killerl4d,2012-04-06T03:30Z,snifff snifff smells like a fake
,Rawbrry,2012-04-06T04:07Z,"It's not fake. I can confirm that this is in fact the second episode in full.  The problem is the quality, most specifically the sped up issue."
,excelguy,2012-04-06T16:51Z,Not watchable for me. Too bad quality
,ebNight,2012-04-07T09:09Z,Tis is a SOPA/PIPA bait upload. All americans who download this will be prosecuted!!!
