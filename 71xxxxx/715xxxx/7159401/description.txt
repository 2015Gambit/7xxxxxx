21 is the second studio album by English recording artist Adele. Released on 24 January 2011[1] in most of Europe, and on 22 February 2011 in North America, it was named after the age of the singer during its production. The album shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her debut album 19, but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008ΓÇô2009 North American tour An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her partner, the album explores themes of anger, revenge, heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.
