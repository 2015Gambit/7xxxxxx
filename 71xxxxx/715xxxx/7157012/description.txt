Notes:
Reason for READNFO... well 1st off got the HD Cam into 3 pieces but was still missing a lil 
so used the russian release to cut in the missing pieces and fix som of the camera movement and sum blur..

so had the thing in quiet a few pieces to fix all properly adjusted everything under the sun
then just synced up littlebirds LiNE to the encode.... enjoy all.. 
may work on a V2 using the russian vid as main
and substitute parts of arabic cam into it... we will see im kinda tired of this movie right now...lol

included 2 samples one of light scenes and dark scenes. enjoy :)
