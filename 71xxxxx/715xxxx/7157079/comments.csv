Malic and I are seeding this both from a 100 mbit fibre seedbox. All future torrents will be seeded from multiple fibre seedboxes.

Expect more ASOT to come !

With kind regards,

Malic & Koolraap"

Thanks for this torrent so far aswell!!!"
,Malicer,2012-04-03T21:20Z,Gimme a sec for that. Can't find the .cue files for them. So either I need to make them my self or I can find them after all.
,AlexPK,2012-04-03T21:20Z,Aswell wanted to mention that on Yellow Stage there is missing set from Ronski Speed... Would like to know why.
,Malicer,2012-04-03T21:21Z,Just found them:P Gimme half an hour.
,AlexPK,2012-04-03T21:22Z,And still this work is awesome so no need to hurry! Main thing for me and probably many others aswell is that everything will atleast be downloadable :)
,Koolraap,2012-04-03T21:54Z,"Jeah we got sick and tired of having to wait for that super big slow torrent. 
That and the inspiron uploads weren't split properly so Malic though; ""I'll do it better"" ;)

He's working on it as we speed :- )
