,Fuckinoob,2012-04-03T23:36Z,"Getting an odd message, ""27 days left on your free trial"", even though it shows registered under ABOUT."
,brbear,2012-04-04T02:22Z,"I'm getting Blu-ray copy expired message.  Did a wipe install of the previous release (8.1.6.8)and installed this ""fresh"" and still getting ""Blu-ray copy"" expired.

When I remove and re-installe 8.1.6.8 I don't get the message and I can copy Blu-rays just fine.

Sticking with 8.1.6.8 until this gets fixed"

,Bean-Bandit,2012-04-04T10:37Z,It's a shame that he doesn't respond back about the problem. BTW do you guys do a full uninstall of your older versions or do you just run the new one and I guess it patches it.
,Bean-Bandit,2012-04-04T10:40Z,I just installed it after doing a full uninstall and it worked fine for me. Make sure if you are using vista or win 7 you run as admin. Maybe that was the problem.
[V],ChattChitto,2012-04-04T12:08Z,"Yes you must run it as admin.
Read the warning when u hover above the automated cracking button!
And I'm not 24/7here standing by to reply!! WTF!"
,CHAOS1972,2012-04-05T00:52Z,"Does not matter....

Even using these .dll files (which i am sure were made by the same standard BBB patcher) it still shows up a warning for 29 day's left.

They must have figured a way to beat the standard patcher, like they have before, but a new one will show up soon enough i'm sure."

,ahearns,2012-04-18T08:33Z,"got a prior version off of you (twice), and eventually your ""crack"" refuses to work. why are your uploads only temporary when others have cracks that are permanent? why do you re-release every month? "
