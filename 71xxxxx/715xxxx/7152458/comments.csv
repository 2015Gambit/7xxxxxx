,gregmlr,2012-05-23T19:10Z,Excellent rip! I rented the Bluray but it started skipping at the 1:20 mark (this is becoming a regular problem with Lionsgate releases for me) and had to look to other means in able so I could finish watching the film. I was amazed at the quality given the file size. Thanks!
