Business is slow for Terry Leather, a London car dealer, married with children. 
He's an artful dodger, so Martine, a former model with a thing for him, 
brings him her scheme: a bank's alarm is off for a couple weeks, 
so let's tunnel into the vault. He assembles a team, not realizing her 
real goal is a safe-deposit box with compromising photos of a royal: 
she needs the photos to trade for avoiding a jail sentence - and MI-5, 
or is it MI-6, is pulling the strings two steps removed. A Trinidadian thug, 
a high-end bordello owner, and a pornographer also have things stored 
in the vault, so the break-in threatens many a powerful personage. 
Is there any way these amateurs can pull it off?ΓÇª
