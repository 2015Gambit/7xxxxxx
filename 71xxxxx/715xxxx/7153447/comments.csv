,blackarun,2012-04-02T16:54Z,"If you worry too much about online safety, then cut your internet. :-) Then to verify the file yourself, use Bittorrent/utorrent client and stream the video. This will help you to save bandwidth , check quality and of-course you can verify video files.  Anyway this torrent is 100% real & i don't post fake content."

,jet013,2012-04-03T06:19Z,requires password :-(
,blackarun,2012-04-03T06:23Z,@ogre916 Subtitle is softcoded. i.e. it can be turned off.
,blackarun,2012-04-03T06:27Z,@Penrice92 Use the newest version of firefox for its great compatibility with magnet links. For fastest downloads through magnet links use azureus/vuze bittorrent client. 
,blackarun,2012-04-03T06:30Z,@jet013 are you out of your mind? 
,EnvyEscape,2012-04-03T23:36Z,"I downloaded VLC Player to watch this. It's great, thanks. :D"

,Dinogaby,2012-04-07T22:58Z,"ogre916:

The subtitles are for those like ME and others, whose native language isn't english and sometimes don't get 100% of what's being said on screen. Subtitles makes it easier. Don't be so selfish.

blackarun:
Thanks SO MUCH for this upload! And for the subtitles as well! Hopefully you can post the upcoming episodes too!"
