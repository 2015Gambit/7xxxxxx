Australia: The Time Traveller's Guide
Richard Smith takes us from the birth of the solar system to the modern world, and tells an Australian story that spans 4.6million years. When Europeans first stepped into the island of Australia they saw it as a young country, but nothing could have been farther from the truth. In reality, Australia is a land with the oldest rocks and oldest fossils on Earth, all harbouring secrets from the time when the planet was being formed. Scattered around the sunburnt face of the country, there are clues and enigmas that reveal our planet's deep past: remains of vast reef systems, bold footprints of bygone creatures, remnants of prehistoric jungles and long, forgotten ancestors. 






4)  Big Island 
Dr Richard Smith embarks on the final stage of his journey through the geological history of Australia, from the formation of its landscape to the development of its wildlife in today's desert heart we plunge into an ancient inland sea, full of monsters. But reptiles didn't have the world all to themselves. Mammals like the enigmatic platypus lived alongside them, ready for their moment in the sun. We know that land as the supercontinent Gondwana, and it was during the greening of Gondwana that the eastern third of the continent was put in place, complete with Australia's vast coal reserves
