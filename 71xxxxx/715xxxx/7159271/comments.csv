,phase700b,2012-04-04T16:58Z,I didn't know it was possible to get a DTS soundtrack from a Dolby TrueHD source.
[V],DownTYU,2012-04-04T17:39Z,"Its possible but a bad idea..
TrueHD 7.1 > DTS HDMA 7.1 > DTS Core 5.1"
[V],DownTYU,2012-04-04T17:46Z,But DTS 1509 is definitely better than AC3 640
,phase700b,2012-04-04T18:17Z,Thanks DownTYU. I'm guessing it takes something more than Handbrake to do that.
