The One Magazine October 1988 - January 1996

The One was a multi-format games mag published originally by EMAP, 
initially covering the 16-bit micros of the era (mainly Amiga, Atari ST 
and PC), before shifting focus to just Amiga gaming. The One lasted for
nearly 7 years before being closed by EMAP, only to be relaunched by
Maverick Magazines, where it limped along for another year before
disappearing for good.

These PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on
public torrent trackers. They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad.

The OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the
more unusual fonts and layouts used and by the relatively low DPI of the
source images.

The file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG
images; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible
without losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check(or Google RetroPDFs) for more
information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors and donators to
RetroPDFs for their support.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
