Art of the Western World was one of Michael Wood's earliest "big" series.
It was commissioned by the old, now-defunct, Television South (TVS)--with additional funding from WNET New York, ORF Austria, and Radiotelevision Espa√±ola--and produced by Screenlife Ltd., a UK production company organised as a one-off solely for this series.
t's always been very difficult/impossible to find. Probably because of the demise of TVS, it's never had a commercial release in the UK, on either VHS or DVD. In the US, it had a very poor quality VHS release on the Kultur label in the 1990s. More recently it's had an institutional/educational release on DVD. The series was also accompanied by a book of the same title.

The original TVS broadcasts were in an 18 episode x 30 minute format. The American version has each pair of half hour episodes spliced together into a 9 episode x 1 hour format.
