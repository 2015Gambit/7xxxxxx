The Koran has been called the most idealogically influential text in the world.
yet there are widely different interpretations. What does Koran actually say?
and How much do Muslims and Non-Muslims alike really understand about the message
and history of The Koran.

It is hard to image another time when this is such a urgent question.
Over a billion people cherish The Koran as authentic word of God his final message,
how Muslims interpret that message will affect the future of Islam and all mankind.
