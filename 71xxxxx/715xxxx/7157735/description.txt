In order to play these expansions too, you must create two different shortcuts.
Copy the same path of Quake 1, should be like this:
"D:DownloadsQuake Iquake.exe"

Then you add the next thing to that in these different shortcuts, -hipnotic, and for the other, -rogue.

Must look like these...

For Scourge of Armagon:
"D:DownloadsQuake Iquake.exe" -hipnotic

For Dissolution of Eternity:
"D:DownloadsQuake Iquake.exe" -rogue

For Quake
"D:DownloadsQuake Iquake.exe"
