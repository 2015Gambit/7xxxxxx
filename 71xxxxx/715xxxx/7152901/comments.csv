,fouti20,2012-04-12T20:15Z,Between steps 6 & 7 I forgot to add that you need to select the config file you moved to the desktop. Then change settings and put it back.

,gabototote,2012-05-12T23:23Z,HOW CAN I PLAY IT IN FULLSCREEN?
,Dasturdly,2012-06-23T09:18Z,"Game starts and loads fine. Then lags as soon as I try to begin playing. Then after about 2 minutes, after i've rushed through picking a car and starting the game, it crashes.
MacBook
Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz
NVIDIA GeForce 9400M with 256 MB of VRAM

Are my system specs not up to snuff?"
