And Then the Darkness is a gripping account of the disappearance in 

the Australian Outback of English tourist Peter Falconio. His 

girlfriend Joanne Lees was found, cut and bleeding, wandering the 

highway, her hands bound. Joanne's account of her ordeal sparked a 

frenzy of media interest and the biggest manhunt ever mounted in 

Australia. Questions arose about the police operation and about Joanne 

herself. 


Award-winning journalist and columnist Sue Williams delves into the 

saga as it unfolds, finding a policeman willing to risk everything to 

crack the case, a journalist hell-bent on proving Joanne a liar, 

endless conspiracy theories, countless devastated lives in both 

Britain and Australia ... and ultimately, the explosive finale.
