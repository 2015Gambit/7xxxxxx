,piratebobby,2012-04-04T19:24Z,"THIS DVD DOES NOT HAVE THE ENGLISH TEXT WHEN RUSSIAN IS SPOKEN!!!!

How hard is it to get a good quality DVD download?

This one does not have correct forced sub-titling when Russian is spoken, others have crap video quality. Please, someone get it right!"

This is the English version you ALL need it`s the ""mpt"" version the source is a retail disc and it has all the required english hardcoded subs for  the Russian speech sections.

 It`s a retail copy with an edited menu (the extras have been ripped) but if it`s a  DVDR version of this your after that`s the one to get. And forget about all the other shit thats` out there and there`s plenty of it      "
