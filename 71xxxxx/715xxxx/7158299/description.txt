Darcy "Two Finger" Tyler is a pitcher for the Turtlesburg Tomahawks and general manager Johnny Sins thinks she's taken her team for granted. Add to that the fact that she's missed practice more than enough times and you've got a player who's looking to be traded. When he gives her this news, however, Darcy does what it takes to keep her spot on the Tomahawks.
