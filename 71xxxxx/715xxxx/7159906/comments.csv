,biblionx7,2012-05-23T09:48Z,"This program works! Easy installation and set up. How do I know it works.......certain websites that I frequently log into have been informing me that I am trying to log in from a different location! The only downside is (at least what I've experienced) is a slower internet.
Thanks uploader!
Cheers!!"

,justinrpg,2012-06-05T12:40Z,can this hide me from my ISP seeing my torrent activity???
,KnuxTheFox,2012-06-26T01:32Z,"I had found that this didn't do as good a job at hiding my IP address as I'd hoped.  I went to trace-my-ip.com and they picked it right up, along with my physical location."
,tylrgamster14,2012-07-01T12:58Z,"This does work and i also went to http://www.tracemyip.org/ 
and it had said my ip was different.

This does not hide your ip in torrents as i did a test and it said my ip was the same but when i browse the net and download things (from the browser not torrents) my ip is different.

It does slow your internet down, I went from 620kb/s to about 120kb/s.

Thanks for the upload BLOVES"

,gazmakka,2012-08-24T12:18Z,"Works wonderfully n my Windows 7 Ultimate x 64. I picked a Physical IP location in the UK, 12,000Km from where I live and was given a Fake IP address number that is in use(changes every 10 minutes) as well as my Real IP address. However, there is only one problem: I have to stop 'Hide IP' for the Pirate Bay site to be accessed. The URL reads as being www.virginmedia.uk and a bit more and the page says that it can't connect. At the moment I have Hide IP Easy sopped, that is how I am here entering this comment.
Shame really. I will have to ask here if anyone knows what the cause of my not being able to connect to Pirate Bay while this application is running using a Fake IP address I'd be grateful for the knowledge so that I can fix the problem.
I also Temporarily disabled the Protection and Firewall of the  Eset 5 Security Suite I use, but that didn't help. I can connect to TPB and other P2P sites with Eset 5 SS operating, but as I said, I can't with this Hide IP Easy application covering my butt.
Shame.
Any help appreciated. Thanks in anticipation."
