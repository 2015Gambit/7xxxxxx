,RegPulp,2012-04-04T07:39Z,"too remind you this collection is made up of films that have been done by different sources, quality will vary depending on each film (there are a handful of settings that can be selected in x264 which really dictate the output quality)

be warned, check each film accordingly to make sure that quality is good throughout this collection (i call this type of collection a hybrid boxset because of the various sources)
