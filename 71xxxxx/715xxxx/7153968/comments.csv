Quiet down dough head, what have you contributed?  Do you even seed?  

There are ppl out there running 32-bit Win7 (I'm using 64, can't dload this one either).

When you start uploading original torrents, you'll be justified in complaining about others.  Till then, shush, K?  Thank you."

Keep up the good work.  "
