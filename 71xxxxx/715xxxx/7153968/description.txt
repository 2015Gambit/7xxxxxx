RamDisk 11 for Desktop Systems
Superspeed offers two high-performance RAM disk products: RamDisk and RamDisk Plus.

RamDisk and RamDisk Plus┬«  
Both use our patent-pending memory management (up to 512 GB) to create a virtual disk out of RAM. The RAM disk appears like a physical hard disk to the operating system and programs. You choose its size (depending on the amount of RAM in your system), drive letter, and file system. You can copy, move and delete files on it. Like a physical disk, a RAM disk can also be shared so as to be accessed by other computers on a network.

The most important difference between a RAM disk and a hard disk is access speed. The time taken for a hard disk to move its magnetic heads over the spinning disks (much like the arm moving over old vinyl record player) is typically measured in milliseconds (thousandths of a second). Whereas a RAM disk does not have mechanical parts and its access speed is typically measured in nanoseconds (billionths of a second). Access to a RAM disk may be 50 times faster or more than to a hard drive.
