Every version since 1.2 (correct me if im wrong) is capable of running in the 64bit java environment, with all the benefits from 64bit applications.

You can assign more RAM to JRE manually. You just have to add some parameters to the JRE. Google will help ;)"

You can download the serial from Rapidshare. The setup will send you automatically to the serial, so don't close your internet browser. Good luck with your instal!"

You're an idiot.

All Minecraft is 64bit... it all depends on what java they have installed.

Why would someone want a torrent that needs a key which is not supplyed and does not even have a cracked launcher..."

Number 2 rule: Computer systems are mutable, so there must always be *at least* 2 ways to do anything.

Number 3 rule: Quit your bitching - get fixing.
People are being forced to run their browsers to activate this program. 
Why if I didn't know better, I'd suspect you to be a bad shitty scamming government hacker. Get off of our internets, idiot."

You are an idiot because this is the exact same launcher you you ripped off my 1.2.4 then put it in a self extractor..."
