had a problem with bach and strauss playing on my ipod classic, but re-encoded them and all is well.
Thanks again for all of this. 
Another pro-tip, I changed the album artwork to better pics of these geniuses, because the cartoonish depictions of them on the original albums didn't work for me....
Cheers"

I do not however ""enjoy"" when David Garrett shows up at my mediacentre, so his covers I always change no matter what :) Anyhow, glad you like the albums and good that you got the device playing them. Hope you did not hit and run."
