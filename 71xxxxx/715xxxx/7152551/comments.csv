,Llwynog,2012-04-16T05:18Z,"First off, I really appreciate you taking the time to gather all of season 2 in one place â&#x20AC;&#x201C; especially since many of them aren't available anywhere else (at least, not in torrents that are still being seeded).

But if it says you need to upgrade to avoid seeing those files, shouldn't you upgrade?

A couple of notes on quality:
* In addition to the episodes marked as such, episodes 3, 4, 9, 13-15, 17, 19, and 20 are C_Ps and therefore suck.
* For some random reason, episodes 18, 21, and 22 are fullscreen. Why would someone intentionally pan-and-scan an episode before uploading it?

Most of the other 11 episodes are actually really good quality. A couple are a bit subpar but they're not so bad that it's worth the effort to replace them (although I definitely have to replace the fullscreen ones so I can finish UA before the new series one starts).

So to sum up, I'm really thankful that you took the time to make available a bunch of episodes that I can't find elsewhere, but I really wish you'd had better quality ones available for upload."
