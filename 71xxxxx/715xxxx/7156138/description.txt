                           DESCRiPTiON 

 To mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, this documentary 
 examines the disaster and asks why maritime catastrophes still occur. The 
 programme assesses the design and construction weaknesses and human errors that 
 can contribute to the sinking of ships, and reports on the Costa Concordia, 
 which ran aground off the coast of Tuscany in January.
                                                                                 
                                 Enjoy!
