Narratives:

While the attention around them grows ever stronger, the LHF collective drop their debut album with a minimum of fuss, and in something of a bold move give everyone a whopping 26 tracks to digest. If anything itÆll silence all those speculating and analysing while they just try to catch up and process this incredible body of work. As the name of the album and the singles that preceded this long player ably demonstrate, the combined forces of Amen Ra, Double Helix, Low Density Matter and No Fixed Abode (whoever they might be) are carrying the torch for the original principles of dubstep, and in turn UK rave music as a whole. This is no more evident than in the irreverence with which they use samples. Nothing is off limits, from Kill Bill and The Matrix through to Happy Mondays and 808 State, in a world where everything can be sampled and obscurity is king, itÆs this wry innocence which informs the rest of the music, but the real joy is that it doesnÆt hamper the sheer brilliance of the production.
