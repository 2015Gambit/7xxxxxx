Live Killers is a double vinyl, cassette tape and compact disc live album by English rock band Queen. It was released on 22 June 1979.

It was recorded live during the European leg of Queen's Jazz world tour between January and March 1979.[5] The album was self-produced by the band and was their first album to be mixed at their own studios, Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland.

Guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor revealed on the US radio show In the Studio with Redbeard (which spotlighted the making of 1980's The Game) that the band was not happy with the album's final mix as the band mixed the album themselves.

Despite May and Taylor's unhappiness with the album, Live Killers reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart, and number 16 on the Billboard 200 in the United States, and is certified double platinum in the US.
