I may switch or just see if somebody continues to do avi. Either way, thanks for giving the people what they want!"
,Schweetz66,2012-04-02T07:09Z,Please let it be .mp4! So I can stream them to my xbox... 
,Doom69,2012-04-02T08:34Z,"I just hope going to mp4 the bitrate isn't skimped/cut down on by too much as some of us like watching them on 46"" TV's.

Thank you for this Lost girl too."
