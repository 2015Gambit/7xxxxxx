,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-04-06T02:10Z,"There is lots of pixelation throughout, especially the dark areas.  I then tried to make a DVD with ConvertXtoDVD, and it had audio problems as a result."
,MerlinBiggs,2012-04-06T20:01Z,Sound goes in and out of synch
,theeccentrik,2012-04-07T10:09Z,"Thanks, i agree the video/audio does occasionally go out of sync and seems almost slightly slowed down/blurry frame by frame as if you got 2 seconds of a blurry 3d like picture.

A-9

CHEERS!"
,fasteddie84,2012-04-07T10:36Z,"Watched this on the PS3 using PS3 Media Server. Video slowed down at some points and sound went out of sync at some points.

The only real problem is that there were no english subtitles for the Russian parts. I assume that it should have them?

Can anyone recommend a version that has this?"
,N-Asadi,2012-04-12T08:09Z,"v=7/10
a=9/10
---------
frame drops at some points
---------
incompatible with some video convertors
you can't convert it to DVD standard using ConvertXtoDVD
---------
Just try other Releases!"
,lewsur,2012-04-13T11:39Z,"I didn't notice any pixelation but I did notice some scenes became out of sync with the audio. 

This became pretty bad towards the last quarter of the movie.

It's still alright to watch, just not worth keeping in your collection."
,thepray,2012-04-14T13:09Z,"Try dvd-lab pro 2, best dvd maker for me
I tried this movie and i got no problem for audio

V:6/10 (frame drops at some sections & no hard encoded subtitles for non english parts)
A:8/10"
