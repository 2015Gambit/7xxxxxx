We're not the RIAA or the MPAA - we are a tiny company struggling to survive, so please bear that in mind before downloading this torrent. 

Without customers we won't be able to keep producing awesome content and our stuff really isn't that expensive! We continually update the freestyle program and the version in this torrent is already out of date! Please stop by www.snowboardaddiction.com to check out the latest stuff. "

See this in the positive view, a lot of people will hear about you guys. It's worse if your a big company but small ones sometimes benefit from it because they get good reputation"
