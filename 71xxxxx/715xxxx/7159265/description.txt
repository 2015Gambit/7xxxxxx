This is version 1.0 of the University of Iowa Visual Ceramics Database, the culmination of a two year, nearly 1000 hour commitment from both myself and the University of Iowa Ceramics Department. This is intended to be the starting point in an ongoing project to test and analyze all ceramics glazes, eventually extending to all materials and processes used in the field. Use and reproduction of these materials is free and strongly encouraged, so long as they remain intact, used for non-commercial purposes.
This work seeks to function as a type of academic journal for the field of ceramics, intended to be a forum for the open exchange of knowledge and ideas. If you have work you would like to have included in the database, please feel free to contact me by email at tyler-cochran@uiowa. edu.
If you have found these materials to be useful, please consider making a donation in whatever amount you see fit to the University of Iowa Ceramics Department. 100% of donations will be used to fund further research, providing invaluable learning experiences to students at both the undergraduate and graduate level.
I would like to dedicate this project to Mat Rude and Reagan Yoder, of the University of Iowa Ceramics Department. This project would not have been possible without their continued guidance and support.
