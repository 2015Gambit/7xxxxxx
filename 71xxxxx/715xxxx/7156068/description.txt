Australia: The Time Traveller's Guide
Richard Smith takes us from the birth of the solar system to the modern world, and tells an Australian story that spans 4.6million years. When Europeans first stepped into the island of Australia they saw it as a young country, but nothing could have been farther from the truth. In reality, Australia is a land with the oldest rocks and oldest fossils on Earth, all harbouring secrets from the time when the planet was being formed. Scattered around the sunburnt face of the country, there are clues and enigmas that reveal our planet's deep past: remains of vast reef systems, 



2)  First Steps 
Great waves of biological invasion sweep us into episode two of Australia: The Time Traveller's Guide. The oceans, replete from the explosion of life that began in the Cambrian, are now spilling their cargoes onto the land. Australia, now part of the super-continent Gondwana is truly a wide, brown land and has had no blush of life on land to blemish its barren surface. As Richard Smith discovers, that all changed in the Silurian. Prepare to meet Planet Earth's forgotten pioneers: the Arthropod armies that invaded the shores. We follow the rise and rise of fish and the emergence of four-legged animals onto the land.. Once again, prehistoric life was busy bankrolling our modern economy and building the basic elements that we know and love as the Australia of today.
