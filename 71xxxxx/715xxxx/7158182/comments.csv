,tbraybrook,2012-09-24T00:48Z,Not working for me. Burned the image file then tried to install it. Told I needed Microsoft Visual Basic C Distributabale 2010 or something like that which I already have. Said OK to install it then got an error message regarding one of the needed programs. DOH! Thanks anyhow but can't find how to get this to work so will look for another torrent of it.
