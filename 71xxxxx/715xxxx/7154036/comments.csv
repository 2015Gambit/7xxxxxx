,Lardzor,2012-04-03T10:13Z,"The quality is good.

This movie is basically some guy with a very soothing voice talking about his feelings and beliefs who tells stories about people who have cured cancer, discovered anti-gravity and solved free energy, but were suppressed by the government. It's intermixed with interviews with alien abductees, photos of crop circles and an underlying theme of the idea that fields in the shape of a torus somehow have the key to all of the worlds problems. It's easy to see why only 20 people rated it on IMDB when I looked. I'm guessing most probably worked on the film."
,truelovesa,2012-04-03T10:17Z,Looking for a movie called Iron Sky. Any info? Thanks extremezone
,seanincali,2012-04-03T10:35Z,"thanks for the up. but i have to say, this new age bullshit repackaged into economics mumbojumbo really didn't work for me. to be honest, after about 10 minutes, i closed it to look for another movie. if you want a nice documentary about economics/money try zeitgeist series (final edition and addendum), the secret of oz, or inside job. 

this is just a self grandiodizing effort by a billionaire heir of gamble fame of procter and gamble corporation. "

,Kole97,2012-04-04T10:18Z,"Interesting enough to watch and think about, but almost all of it is either false or a modified version of the truth. using the enviroment for energy is basic and important (obvious if you take a look at all the nuclear waste we've made over the past years) but﻿ the ufo and symbolism is a fabrication made by a paranoid (but creative) misguided person.

+ Everyone should check out ""The﻿ Torus."" It is a dramatic feature film that coincides greatly with Thrive.Check out the promo video at﻿ indiegogo . com/thetorus."

With the NDAA, SOPA, CISPA... being implemented, it is time to wake up... OWS could be a good start..."

I know that a lot of it is true...."
,skyvillage,2012-04-16T04:43Z,"It's too bad the movie opens with debatable (although interesting) material about crop circles and the like.  But when it moves to the political side, it is remarkable.  You have to see this movie.  It's fun to watch, it's different, it's fascinating, and it's insightful."
