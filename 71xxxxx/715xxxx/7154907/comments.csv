,MhrBhr,2012-04-04T00:39Z,But where exactly to choose convert to .FLV ?

1. Thanks, but I wouldn't recommend connecting Internet as it does check the company's database for 'overused' keys.
2. First drag and drop the video into the window. Second, next to profile, select:
All Profiles -> FLV - Flash Video Format"

,almaenpena,2012-04-08T02:00Z,"for some reason ask me to connect 2 internet, if not the key keeps saying unable 2 connect, and if i do connect  the key is invalid....some advice?"
,almaenpena,2012-04-08T03:03Z,"so i search over the Pb and i found this and ended my problem so tx anyway
Xilisoft added a hidden registey key, which wont allow you to add any more keys after the first key gets blocked. So here is a workaround:

1. Start
2. Run
3. Type in Regedit
4. Select HKEY_USERS
5. Press Ctrl + f (Search)
6. Search for {C06F4056-C35F-4bf8-A93A-9F098F3E503D}
7. Delete the Key, including the subkeys"

,MLO89,2012-04-18T04:17Z,"Works perfectly. This is how I did it. I installed without disconnecting from Internet. Put in the crack per instructions. Opened program and took check out of auto checking for updates. Put in reg info and exited program. Set program in Windows 7 Firewall and then took check mark out of firewall box which then makes the firewall block internet access for it. I then opened program again and got the ""trial user"" message. While program was open I deleted that registry entry per almaenpena's instructions. I then re-entered the reg info, clicked ""Register"" and got a successful register. Now program opens properly and fully registered and no disconnecting from internet needed at all. Very nice. "
