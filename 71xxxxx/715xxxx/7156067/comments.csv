I downloaded one file: Automotive Suspension and Steering Systems.pdf that has a lot of bad pages.

I don't know if that is the same with the other files."
,karunnt,2012-04-04T20:18Z,"Do you think downloading ALL the files help seed this faster than picking and choosing what to download?

I don't know but it is stuck as 80% for a day now."
