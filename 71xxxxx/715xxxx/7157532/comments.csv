One of the few flaws of this great album."

The sound is little distorted. I tought it was somebody who upload the mp3 with bad quality but when I heard the full cd in mp3, I decided to by the original cd and que quality was the same (little distorted), but fu** it. Those are great songs any ways.

For the next album, Flying Colors shoud talk with the guys who produced *Avenged Sevenfold - Nightmare* or the guys who produced *blink182 - Neighborhoods. Those albums have  the best quality I've heard. "
