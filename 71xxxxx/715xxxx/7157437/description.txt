SCP-087 is a Unity-based first-person horror game that involves walking down some stairs, through a random number of floors with random horrible noises and events occurring. ItΓÇÖs the kind of stairway you might find in a House of Leaves. Incredibly simple and far too dark but with sound design decent enough that I just became too nervous to carry on my descent and quit.
