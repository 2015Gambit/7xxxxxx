,The.Buzzsaw,2012-04-22T15:46Z,"Thanks for the comments but I don't like the watermark that appears during a couple of the fights for a few seconds. I will be uploading a great NICK DIAZ career pack this week, followed by a Carlos Condit pack, and then I will put a maximum quality Chael Sonnen pack on here. Also, come join our group on facebook called MMA Know-it-alls."
