,ag_orange,2012-04-03T16:07Z,Is this cropped version too?
,Stealthdevil666,2012-04-03T17:19Z,"V: 7.5 - 8
A: 6.5 - 7
(Compared to a DVD copy)

Very watchable, good frame rate, not sure if cropped as not saw any other version to compare it to, however would guess that a slight part of the bottom of the picture is missing

Will seed to 1.5"
