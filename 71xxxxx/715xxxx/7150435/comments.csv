,wdc1,2012-04-26T17:41Z,episode 21 is not complete
,RooJo4342,2012-05-17T17:30Z,"i will upload season 8 in small size 130mb probably 720p, once downloaded and encoded"
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-05-17T17:49Z,@RooJo4342: Where'd you get season 8 in 720p from?
,RooJo4342,2012-05-18T19:06Z,"from here: http://playskill.in/friends-s08-ws-720p-hdtv-dd2-0-h-264-ntb/

but don't download part 04 and 06 with jumbofiles download with another because they are incomplete"
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-05-18T20:22Z,Ah... I've seen that before. I was hoping for a torrent download. Thanks anyway.
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-05-18T20:26Z,"@RooJo4342: At size around 130mb, you'd have the same quality as is on the rest of dvd rips all over the internet. It defeats the point of high definition. Upload them as they are!"
,RooJo4342,2012-05-19T10:54Z,"no tyl3rdurd3n you're wrong man, you can drop the video bitrate to a certain point whilst keeping the same quality, i've done it may times"
,RooJo4342,2012-05-19T11:02Z,"and i have also found season 10 480p hdtv but i can't download it because there is a problem with uploadbaz, here is the link: http://forum2.moviefa.ir/thread10159.html

you might have to register to have access to the link"
,canagprm,2012-05-22T17:55Z,some scenes removed but good quality
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-05-22T19:02Z,"**Removed by the channel that aired the show, not uploader."

,DragonAirbender,2012-07-22T17:44Z,"has anyone found or sourced season 8 onwards in 720p from somewhere.
having a real hard time finding them, @tyl3rdurd3n have you had any luck?"
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-07-23T08:33Z,"You can get S8 from here: 

h t t p : / / t r a c k e r . a l l - i n . o r g . u a / d e t a i l s . p h p ? i d = 2 0 5 3 1

It's almost dead but I was be able to download all the episodes without much trouble. You have to register to download."
,ImNoMyth,2012-07-28T07:03Z,"Thanks again for your efforts.  Now that you've got yourself season 8, any chance of you uploading here?  Thanks!"
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-07-28T21:27Z,@above: I can't upload that here. It's a private torrent. You have to get it from there if you want; it'd be the same here and there even if I could so...
