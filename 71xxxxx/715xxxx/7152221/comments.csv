,Quazo,2012-04-02T06:08Z,"Is this also in HD? It doesn't say it's HD in the name, unless you consider the Sir.Paul.PublicHD as being it saying it's in HD. Anyways, I just wanted to make sure it's HD and like the other guy asked, is it the whole thing before I started it."
,IrishDiesel,2012-04-02T06:11Z,says it's almost 4hours in run time... should be the whole thing.

,hezekiah957,2012-04-02T07:06Z,"Note that the uploader's site is PublicHD. This upload is NOT HD quality, merely 624x352 resolution. Quality will be just about the same as a standard 700MB encode of a Raw or Smackdown episode, based on the runtime and filesize."
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-04-02T07:08Z,Sorry for seeding a little late. My computer runs on electricity too.

,pirateguy122,2012-04-02T20:25Z,"ARE YOU KIDDING!?

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!

Audio is NOT perfect, it's choppy when played on pc & tv.

I WASTED THE REST OF MY MONTHLY BROADBAND ON THIS

NOW I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH SLOW INTERNET FOR A WEEK

thanks for nothing!
"
,MrFriendly,2012-04-02T20:34Z,Thanks for the headsup pirateguy122..I had my suspicions that it was bad quality from seeing the first 2 minutes. Video was Ok but audio was bad.
,nascarwrench,2012-04-02T21:59Z,"thanks for show, now I will LEECH!"
,user022012,2012-04-02T22:14Z,"Not the best torrent.
On PC: V ok A ok
On TV (Dune HD and O!Play) V ok A sucks

every 2 sec a high pitch sound realy annoying.
Now i need to download another version."
,iH4z3,2012-04-03T02:45Z,"Its a really good quality of a video. 
Played on 720p TV & Monitor at the same time there was no audio lag or tuning out. The people complaining about it must got a bad audio driver or player. I used this with K-Light codec pack and it worked flawlessly. Thanks for the show I enjoyed it.

Audio - 10
Video - 10"

This torrent has decent video but the audio is pretty bad. So only do it if you are desprete and don't want to listen to it. My PC is Window7 and new so there's nothing wrong with my PC. The audio is just bad."
,TheJackDanuls,2012-04-03T12:02Z,"Video quality is very good. Audio, I wouldn't say choppy, more like chirpy. I thought maybe Micheal Cole had already went coo coo."
