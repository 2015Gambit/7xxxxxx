,jordie00000,2012-04-04T12:45Z,TvTeam you have let me down in everything i use to love you guys uploading in AVI not MKV 
,Nirvana9832,2012-04-04T13:43Z,"@jordie00000 Dude, just use DivX Player... they are great quality. i download every week because i miss the show. Better than dvr on my shity tv, id rather watch on my HD monitor. 

Thanks TVTeam"
,jordie00000,2012-04-04T16:54Z,i know that but i cant watch it through my ps3 :/ in my room i would rather watch it on a tv than on a computer :)
,QborT,2012-04-04T18:27Z,"jordie00000 you are a dumbass, the format has nothing to do with TvTeam.  TvTeam is simply and uploader."
,jordie00000,2012-04-05T13:36Z,@QborT they use to upload in AVI you dickhead
,ih4553sharklasers,2012-04-05T17:09Z,Is it possible to do a search for only a particular uploader?  Like if I wanted to search for a show and only have TvTeam's results show?
,QborT,2012-04-05T20:13Z,"jordie00000 your ignorance and lack of knowledge is impressive.  TvTeam uploads what is available, they do not make the rips.

This rip was done by mSD (a P2P group) that always uses the x264 format.  The scene groups used to release .avi files, but scene standards have changed and x264 .mp4 is now the standard (although a couple scene groups still do the .avi). 

How about instead of complaining you take a few minutes to educate yourself."
,ClipperCigars,2012-04-06T06:08Z,"#1: Would you people knock it off with the ""use VLC"" bullshit please. Not everyone uses a Mac/PC for playback. Some of us use stand alone players that VLC doesn't exist for. When VLC starts making Xbox, PSx, xvid-divx compatible dvd player compatible versions, then we can talk. (And shut up about streaming, not interested in tying up a computer for streaming when I already have a damn 6tb lan for browse-able media storage that already works with console media players when shit isn't encoded in stupid formats.)

#2: x264 is an overrated bullshit codec that in reality is not any better then xvid in any way, size, res or quality. All it takes is knowing something about encoding and how to configure xvid correctly. The ONLY thing x264 does is create compatibility issues, particularly with stand alone players. That x264 caters to stupid/lazy people who can't figure out how to use other codecs is no reason to force this garbage the masses who never asked for it to begin with."
,acoastal,2012-04-06T07:24Z,"@jordie00000 Just download the mkv2vob program. It can convert mkv files to avi files, so you can watch it on your PS3. It's free and it works pretty well.

,exp13,2012-04-12T00:22Z,"Qbort, piss off noob. This show has always been released in avi format. Why change now? Now my Tosh.0 folder is full of mismatched video formats. What a joke. 
Jordie, I feel ya bro, just stop seeding for these clowns, that's what I did."

Or maybe people can learn to live within their own means? Why do people even come online to download their favorite shows? Why not go buy it on DVD when its out? Or wait for the recent episodes to play or re-run on tv?

I'm sure there are many reasons, but most people come to get their shows free of charge, or at least at will, NOW.

This is a community of sharing things that many people, you and I included, use to actively seek ways of obtaining these things faster.

I'm sorry the world around you so selfishly changes and leaves folks like yourself crying to others to make it better for you again. Go figure it out. If you are going to use vulgar language like your some adult, maybe act like one and take some responsibility and find methods of getting your show the way you want.

It took me a while to get things the way I want with these files, and it still will have to in the future. But that's life. Learn to adapt and do what so many others clearly are rather then joining ""the masses"" you speak of and complain until you get things your own way.

If you have a computer to download this stuff, you most likely have the capability of converting the video yourself with some easily downloadable program. It may take longer, it may make your precious easy process of getting Tosh annoying, but its someone doing something for you. Complaining that someone gave you what YOU ASKED FOR, for free, in a timely manner, just because you now have to take some more time out of your day... is a clear sign of how inept you are alone."
,manitoloco,2012-05-08T00:02Z,.AVI its better
