,lingerdog,2012-04-02T05:59Z,Awesome files! Do you have any of the old Worth Dying For? Ammunition or their self titled. Also can't find the new live disk Live Riot. Thanks if you can help me any.
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-04-02T16:22Z,"lingerdog, I had four Worth Dying titles including ""2008 - Worth Dying For"", ""2011 - Love Riot"", ""2011 - Tears And Ashes"". and ""2012 - Live Riot."" When you get a chance, do a search here on The Pirate Bay. I've put together a quick discography for you today. :)"
