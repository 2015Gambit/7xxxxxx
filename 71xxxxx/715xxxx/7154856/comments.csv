THE DAY WE FOUND THE UNIVERSE BY MARCIA BARTUSIAK
Until January 1, 1925, the Milky Way might have been alone. That day, astronomers learned that the universe extends at least a million light-years and the faint lights observed by the worldâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s largest telescope at the time twinkled from distant galaxies. Essentially, the date marked the universeâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s discovery, Bartusiak argues in this history of early 20th century astronomy.

""Our celestial home was suddenly humbled, becoming just one of a multitude of galaxies residing in the vast gulfs of space,"" she writes.

But this tale is not about breakthroughs. It focuses on the dramatic insights, sidesteps and missed opportunities, persistence, pride and bits of luck that accompany the scientific process. Edwin Hubble wrote the paper describing the telltale blinks in distant nebula, but he was busy observing and let a colleague read the historic paper. Quite fitting, considering he was not alone in his endeavor."
