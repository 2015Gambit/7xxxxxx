,ch89,2012-04-06T12:38Z,"It may be a large file, but has anybody downloaded it and checked the quality of this?
If they have can someone let me know how it is, because I havn't found a real decent one yet.  the RUDOS 1080p one has very minimal difference to the smaller sized one that is up.
Thanks in advance."
,prboi,2012-04-22T22:31Z,It's a large file size because it's a direct capture of the 4 hour show without any compression to maintain quality. I can compression it & re-upload it
,guccicar,2012-06-02T08:40Z,Can someone seed. It says zero seed on TPB.
