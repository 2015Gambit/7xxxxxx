"The Limey"

A devilishly handsome detective from 
Scotland Yard, Simon Hunt, teams up with 
Castle & Beckett to find the person 
responsible for the murder of his friend's 
daughter. Also, Charles Shaughnessy plays 
Nigel Winthrop, the Deputy General at the 
British Consulate whom Castle & Beckett 
suspect is up to more than just 
ambassadorial balls and diplomatic 
luncheons. Meanwhile, Lanie convinces 
Beckett that she needs to make a move on 
Castle before it is too late.
