,the_devious,2012-04-03T10:51Z,"So, at 1280x544, the IMAX scenes are cropped, right?
If so, I'll wait for the full IMAX version. Thanks."
,canagprm,2012-04-03T11:17Z,@the_devious what do you mean IMAX scenes are cut? How much are we missing/.

no, cropped means removing parts of the image, this almost always (in video) alters the aspect ratio. 

'imax' resolution/aspect ratio has a longer vertical axis than the commonly used 2.39:1.

basically, when you view an 'imax' version of a movie, the black bars that appear on your television above and below the movie (to maintain the intended widescreen aspect ratio) will sometimes disappear and be filled with more image. It's during the scenes that were filmed in 'imax' format that this will occur. 

if the description is accurate and this rip is of the typical res of 1280x544 (actually 2.35:1 aspect rato but pretty much 2.39:1), then it isn't a rip of the imax version. any rips of the imax version are going to be 1280x720. 

being that the offical release date of the blu-ray is the 17th of April, we might not be lucky enough to have a retail imax rip before then. i saw it at the cinemas so i can happily wait till then for the imax version as it makes a nice bit of difference on my 60"".

,captnemo69,2012-04-03T13:23Z,"So is this legit or is it a bullshit upscale of the R6 that's been around for a while?

The fact that it's missing 176 vertical pixels suggests the hardcoded subs have been cropped out..."
,captnemo69,2012-04-03T13:30Z,"notnowplz have you ever downloaded a movie before? There are literally thousands of ""real"" 720p bluray/5.1 rips on this site at 4.38gb, many are even smaller. Read the description, it says X264 - that's a codec which compresses the file to whatever size required. In this case 4.38gb which commonly used because it fits on a DVD whilst still maintaining a good level of quality."
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-04-03T13:39Z,"This is missing the top, bottom, around 88, horizontal lines in the IMAX scenes. Video resolution has to be 1280 x 720 like how it was in the 720p rips of The Dark Knight (also partially shot in IMAX)."

I always check the kbps first. If its a four digit number and not a five-digit number, I know to expect something of a lesser quality."
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-04-03T14:44Z,"Yes it seems there's no part of the picture missing after all. They've kept the aspect ratio the same on the entire film on bluray and it doesn't alternate from 2.40:1 to 16:9 the way it does in The Dark Knight.

,the_devious,2012-04-03T19:33Z,"@DownTYU - Thanks for the update. After some Googling, it seems that Brad Bird tweeted he ""might"" consider an IMAX version on blu-ray if there's enough demand from the fans. In other words, there almost certainly WILL be an IMAX version, but we'll have to wait and we don't know for how long. For those of us who didn't see the movie at the theater, we're now faced with the choice of watching the blu-ray as it is today, or waiting an unspecified length of time for an unconfirmed IMAX version. They do it on purpose, right?"

,Bren0,2012-04-06T16:31Z,"@rinku84

perhaps 'sparks' decided that a 10 pixel vertical stretch would be beneficial in that it fills up more of your display, but not so much that you would notice the distortion? who knows. my other theory is that it could be a typo. without downloading the file you couldn't know the actual res. 

in any case, the following rip is the original 2.40:1 aspect ratio and the quality is certainly up to scratch imo. good enough for me to comment even.

,Tuppy,2012-04-14T04:46Z,"XXX FOR ALL THOSE COMPLAINING D/L SPEED 

(long story short)--In your torrent client don't ""force start"" your torrent. (if you have that option).

(long version)
being a novice myself ""googled"" info on how to speed up upload/downloads.   I like to seed more than I download and in my prefs. I have my option set to upload more than I download.

So when I goto download I just force start.  

When I got to the torrent speed info stuff when I stopped forcing, my speeds increased dramatically. 

Also, I'm not really complaining about anyone but just wanted to share that tip.  So hopefully it can help some people.

Utorrent with a regular torrent file normally has the ""info"" of what you are downloading, such as the files/movies/folders and puts it in your preferred saved directory.  

With a Magnet link, it starts Utorrent, but you need to tell it where to save ei; ""C:torrents"" or what ever, but not just ""c:"" it needs that """".  It will also not show the files it will download until it starts and downloads the files's info.

Also, I have found that some files also deny access for some reason.  Don't know why yet, but I usually just pick a different source then."
