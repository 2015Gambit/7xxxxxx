,bboy8,2012-04-07T04:33Z,"Ok, i do have the wrapper, but it still isnt working. Thanks for the best torrents, though!!!"
,bboy8,2012-04-07T04:38Z,I am such a dumbo!!! Im just gunna re-download this torrent for my best hope.
,mkdhdh,2012-04-08T10:32Z,awesome it works! but its way to addictive so after 5 hours of game time i had to delete it :D but it is fun but to addictive + takes to long to become a werewolf
,Madmax98,2012-04-09T14:37Z,"How do i start it? It just says: 
Failed to initialize renderer.
Your display doesn't support the selected resolution.  Please set a different resolution in Skyrim's Launcher under 'Display Settings'.
No matter which resolution i choose.
Somebody please help, i don't know what to do."

,Gui1999,2012-04-10T03:54Z,"I really need some help, I already downloaded both Wrapper and the .zip file (5 GB), but I don't know what to do next, when I open the .zip file, it opens another .zip file that is called: ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.zip.cpgz"", and when I open it, it appears another .zip file leaving me to a dead end! When I open the Wrapper, it opens the App game, but when I try to open it, nothing happens, the icon just jump a little in my dock and disappear. What I need to do? Step by step?"

Does it work with OSX Lion ? What should I do except remove Lion ?

Thanks. 
"
,graau,2012-04-12T23:26Z,"sorry guys. i cant help u much but go to the system preferences and choose the same resolution to the game and when u open the skyrim pref.... select the elder scrolls... u dont need the wrapper to this game, the wrapper its only for those who already have the pc version. those who the game doesn't start check if the game is on the application folder :] "
,trap3r,2012-04-13T00:31Z,Dosent work on lion it says resolution error.
,Smfvl,2012-04-13T13:42Z,"Well, thanks graau. I guess i've tried all resolutions but any of them seems working. 

Which is the most accurate for Skyrim ?

,Andre[],2012-04-16T05:08Z,"Does anybody know if its possible to use a wired xbox 360 controller on this? I have been trying to find a way for hours, but unfortunately I am not the l33test h4x0r out there."
,bboy8,2012-04-18T04:14Z,"For all the people who cant get the resolution right, i know how!!! This happened to me, so i went to the preferences and it said u need a wrapper, so i downloaded one. Even though i got a wrapper, it still did not work.The thing is, you do not need a wrapper to do this. When it askes for a wrapper, select the elder scrolls V: skyrim the you are trying to open. This will put all these changes onto the game you are playing, not the wrapper!!!"
,bboy8,2012-04-18T04:15Z,"I am also wondering if there is a way to speed the game up. When i select a new game and it is loading, it completely stops!!"
,drbaker,2012-04-19T23:56Z,Could you upload Dead Island? if possible
,sellsoul,2012-04-25T05:57Z,"this is the working skyrim game.. look on youtube for a video on how to upgrade the client the vids there and its relatively easy if i can do it so can you. one question or concern about the game.. theres a persistent ground glitch when im outside, theres not any ground.. im using 10.5.8, 256 vram, and the game runs great actually.. when i enter a dungeon or cave or building the games perfect its just in the outside environment that theres no ground. any fixes or patches for that?"
,bboy8,2012-04-28T00:25Z,"Hey sellsoul, can you find me a video to upgrade the client?"
,sellsoul,2012-04-28T07:17Z,"

1.4 skyrim update


look up this kid FusRoChris on youtube he is a beast..



DID WE FIX THE FAHKIN INVISIBLE GROUND YET??!?!?!?!?!??!!??"
,alejo2460,2012-05-02T18:40Z,Multilingual?
,sellsoul,2012-05-03T23:03Z,ATTN all on 10.5.8 with the ATI 2600 pro 256 mb vram card you need to have 10.6 snow leopard for this to run without flaws.. if your on 10.5.8 itll run but youll have issues with ground textures not loading right. once you upgrade to 10.6 itll run pretty much perfectly. 
,macverdan,2012-05-10T11:53Z,"works great! for the people who can't get past the resolution problem, open skyrim preferences and when it shows the ''open file window'' click the elder scrolls icon. no need for the said ''wrapper'' mentioned if you do it correctly. 100% working on a 13'' macbook pro. zero lag on low res. :)"

,burtonC,2012-06-28T09:19Z,"Thank you so much!
I had no problem downloading, and it only took ~30 minutes. The only thing that sucks is having to select the rapper to open preferences, but it's not all that bad :3
I just did the lowest settings and got a decent FPS for this game on my computer :)
I am using a Macbook white Unibody late 2010 on Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8"
,djskidz13,2012-07-01T14:59Z,I am very new to mac (only had it for 4 days now) and am having a little issue. Every time I try to open skyrim preferences it takes me to my documents folder. There is nothing in my docs about skyrim. When I try to open the game I get the wrong resolution thing that a lot of ppl are getting on here. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
,Ki1lar,2012-07-03T19:38Z,"This torrent is being tracked, I suggest avoiding it"

inb4 get a new computer."
,TheReveR,2012-07-08T22:29Z,"Never mind, I got it running. Only major problem I see is that you can't run certain mods because the launcher splash doesn't appear, so you can't check off the mods in the Data files section. If we could get a working game with the launcher splash then this would be the best find on the internet. Let me know if anyone figures out how to do that. "
,Zampja,2012-07-14T12:38Z,"Hey uhm i downloaded this and when i try to open it a box opens and says 

Failed to initialize renderer.
your display doesnt support the selected resolution. please set a different resolution in skyrim's launcher under display settings

how do i do that when nothing opens up to begin with?"
,Opty56,2012-07-15T10:25Z,"@zampja if you haven't figured it out, what you need to do is open the skyrim preferences that come in the skyrim folder, that should open another finder window. From here head to the skyrim folder and open The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, and you click next to ""screen resolution"" since this bar is invisible it will come up and you can change to the resolution you'd like. After that just open up Skyrim and you're good to go."
,deador9,2012-07-24T14:47Z,"thanks a lot @opty, downloading it now"
,Phorealfilipino,2012-07-26T07:11Z,Is it true that the 1.5 patch broke all of the Skyrim torrents? The wrapper isn't working for me and that was my friend's conclusion as to why it isn't working
,Trickste7r,2012-08-03T09:59Z,Can somebody please post a link to the wrapper? i need my preferences menu to show up and it needs a wrapper

,wilhel1812,2012-08-08T11:32Z,"Has anyone got this to work with Mountain Lion?
When i try to start skyrim.app, nothing happens."
,eXXo23,2012-08-15T17:19Z,@wilhel1812 it still doesn't work under ML because the wrapper isn't updated to work on that version of OS X. But what you can do is try to add the preferences for running in Gatekeeper. Read more on http://www.macworld.com/article/1165408/mountain_lion_hands_on_with_gatekeeper.html
,avenged8fold,2012-08-23T09:31Z,Great torrent works fine on Mountain Lion after setting preferences. however at first i had trouble opening it. i would click and nothing would happen same problem as @wilhel1812 but after 10 minutes it randomly opened and now all works well :) great upload thanks.
,capajalosa,2012-09-03T22:26Z,Anybody else who tried it on Mountain Lion?
,capajalosa,2012-09-04T15:59Z,"im such a noob, can somebody explain to me what should i do with the Skyrim Folder?"
,capajalosa,2012-09-04T17:26Z,"Ok. I solved it. THIS WORKS ON MOUNTAIN LION. I got a MacBook Pro,Intel Core i7, 4gb of ram."
,Ichikasuto,2012-09-15T23:39Z,What are the exact steps to run this? I opened Skyrim Preferences and then opened The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim and nothing happens.
,skyr1mguy,2012-09-19T11:03Z,"Friends, I'm happy to say that after days and days of dinking around, I've finally figured out a foolproof way to make Skyrim work on any mac.  This is a long post, but if you read through it, you'll be playing a fully updated Skyrim *with DLC* and ANY mod you want on your mac without crashes.  You sitting down?  Good. 

First, it's worth understanding what's included in all of these mac torrents.  For the most part, you're getting a ""Thing That Lets You Play On A Mac By Fooling Skyrim Into Thinking It's On A PC"" and Skyrim itself.  We'll call the ""Thing"" a ""Wrapper"".  

The wrapper is pretty small, but relatively complex to create from scratch.  Don't even try it.  It's not worth your time.  

These torrents all contain a wrapper (relatively small) and Skyrim (about 5 gigs of stuff).  The wrapper is what's important.  Skyrim is not. 

So, I promised you instructions on how to get Skyrim to work?  Here's the short, short version: 

{WINDOWS PART}

Download a Windows version of Skyrim (not the mac version).
Download Windows XP
Download VMWare fusion
Install Vmware fusion  
Install Windows XP in VMware.
Install Skyrim for Windows inside VMware.

*** NOTE *** : I wasn't actually able to get passed the Skyrim game loading screen for Skyrim in Windows XP.  It doesn't matter.  Your goal here is to install program files and enable add-ons.  That's all. ***

Install Skyrim for Windows patches inside VMware.
Install Skyrim for Windows mods inside VMware (i used Nexus's NMM mod manager to manage the add ons) 
Run SkyrimLauncher.exe and click on ""Data"" and make sure whatever mod you enabled are ""on"" / checked.  You may need to read NFO files to figure out how to Ungrey the data option (it's in an .ini file), but if you can't figure it out, it's not the end of the world.  Install shit via NMM and you'll be fine.

{MAC PART}


Download this or any other torrent that includes a Cider wrapper (or, if you can find it, a stand alone Cider wrapper, but i've not tested this).  
Unzip/Unrar your Skyrim for Mac download if you haven't already done so.   Hopefully the torrent (like this one: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7157796/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_[MAC]) will contain an icon with system preferences and with the main Skyrim game.
Right click on the main Mac skyrim game icon and click on Show Package Contents.  
Navigate to: Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Program Files/The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.
Delete everything that's there (put it in the trash).  Keep %USERPROFILE% if the folder exists (don't worry if it doesn't, it's not that important).
Move C:Program FilesThe Elder Scrolls V Skyrim from your VMware machine over to Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Program Files/The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim on your mac.
 * If you didn't add any mods, dont worry about this part*
Navigate to Contents/.  You should see an info.plist file.  Open 'er up.
Under CedegaGameName, you'll see a value called  C:Program Files/The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim/TESV.EXE.  If you added a loader (maybe you installed SKYUI and you need the SLSK wrapper), change it.  Mine reads: C:Program Files/The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim/skse_loader.exe.  * If you didn't add any mods, dont worry about this part (end)*

You now have an updated Skyrim with whatever mods you want.  

You should be able to simply double click on the skyrim game icon in your mac and play to your hearts content.  

Worked for me.  Hope it works for you.  "
