A few flash buttons I made some time ago. They were lying useless in some corner of my HDD,so I thought somebody may have a use for them. Created using ActionScript 2.0.

This aint no copyright stuff shit, I made them and use 'em whatever the way you LIKE.


P.S: They are not that advanced or top notch.
