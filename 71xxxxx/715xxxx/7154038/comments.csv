Thanks so much for this. 
Would you happen to know why I got the seeders number up and then down to zero and nothing happen? It has been like that for the last couple of days.

Am I missing something? I'm using transmission app for torrent."

But it seems, at least for me, that it is a bit out of sync, but it may be because of my player, I played it with BSplayer.
All in all, great torrent, thanks for the upload."
