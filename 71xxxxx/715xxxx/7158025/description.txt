Bad Boys Blue is a multinational dance-pop group formed in Cologne, Germany, in 1984 and originally featuring British lead singer John McInerney, American Andrew Thomas, and Jamaican-born Trevor Taylor. After Taylor left the group in 1988, he was replaced by Trevor Travis; upon scoring a number 89 chart hit in 1993 with "Save Your Love," Travis exited as well, and Bad Boys Blue continued as a duo until adding Mo Russel in 1995. His 1999 departure made way for Jo Jo Max.
