quality great!"
,ladyemerald,2012-04-06T23:21Z,"I agree it´s edited and noone knows if she´s really talking to spirits, but it´s fun, very entertaining and it seems to help a lot of people, makes them heal, I do believe that this medium believes she´s talking to spirits, she´s not a con artist like many ""medium"" who takes advantage of people who grieves and make money out of it. But this is television, fun and interesting, no harm"

Your right that we don't see the misses is an issue. I'm sure there are many.
That being said the hits that she does get are EXTREMELY improbable. There is NO way in my opinion that she is doing cold readings.

Also it’s reasonable in my view that she would ask a question like ""who recently died in an accident"" given that she is not ""talking"" to spirits in a normal conversational way but is only receiving impressions.
I appreciate that such a question has the air of a cold reading but again her hits are VERY VERY improbable, unlike the guesses made in a cold reading. The cold reading explanation just doesn't stand up.
Everyone of the debunkers I've read, set up straw men and then knock them down. They don't confront the ""guesses"" that are extremely improbable and can not be just explained away by chance.

Thanks again for the torrents.

Dave"
