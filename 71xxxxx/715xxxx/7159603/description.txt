about game:
League of Legends is an action RTS video game developed and published by Riot Games for Microsoft Windows,[2] inspired by the popular Defense of the Ancients[3] map for Warcraft III.

95 unique champions (as of 3.4.2012)
at least 3 different skins for each champion
3 different maps + 1 extra seasonal


Players are formed into 2 even teams of Champions, 3v3 or 5v5. As of 3 April 2012 there are 95 different champions from which to choose. Each player begin at opposing sides of a map in an area called the Spawning Pool, near what is called a Nexus. A match is won when either team's nexus is destroyed. To destroy a Nexus, each team must work through a series of Turrets placed along a path to each base referred to as a Lane. Along the way, each player gains levels from killing the opposing team's champions and Minions (NPCs that constantly spawn and attack the other team) and defeating neutral monsters. Completing objectives rewards players with gold which is used to purchase items.
