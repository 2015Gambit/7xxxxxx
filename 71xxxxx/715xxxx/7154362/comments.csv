,mray95206,2012-04-04T09:42Z,Thank you so much! I have been waiting for years for this album. I plan on buying the album when it is released but this will do until then. Thank you!
,DXAshram,2012-04-10T04:11Z,"Very surprised to see that this is legitimate. To anyone who wants to know, this is technically the ""special edition"", with four extra tracks that are only available if you buy the album digitally or on vinyl. The only track missing is ""Power of the Ninja Sword"", the bonus track from the Japanese special edition."

But still great work!
