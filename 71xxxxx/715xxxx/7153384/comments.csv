,arvi1592,2012-04-02T19:28Z,you r the best dude!!...all hail bzingaz.. :)
,MrFriendly,2012-04-02T20:28Z,"Cool man.. Is the quality watchable though? I'm obviously not expecting for brilliant HD aslong as it's not choppy audio, and has smooth video? "
,Trax1703,2012-04-02T21:31Z,"if it's legit, I will seed for about 5-6 hours after I am done. Wayyyy too many leechers really killing the speed. I am only at about 1.5meg / s, which is really bad for me. lol "
,Trax1703,2012-04-02T21:33Z,"Bzingaz, ty for the rip btw. Just going to watch then delete anyway like most. So the compact size is fine by me, the bigger ones... LMAO one said like 5weeks, it was creeping along at like 30kb/s, I felt like I was back on dial up for a minute there. "
,Trax1703,2012-04-02T21:38Z,dead at 63%....
,nascarwrench,2012-04-02T22:14Z,"good job rock, taker, shemus, Team Raw, punk...."

,jwa2773,2012-04-03T01:45Z,@nascarwrench:  u r a douche for those of us that haven't seen this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Mr.Seeder.2012,2012-04-03T03:03Z,"100% FAKE !!!

This is wrestlemania 22 !!!"
,MrFriendly,2012-04-03T03:34Z,"Utterly brilliant work with this torrent. Good quality (it's not HD, but I'm not picky) but for it's size it looks great, video and audio work well, and not to mention it downlaoded really fast at like 200kbs compared to all the other 2GB files that downloaded at like 30kb's. Fantastic work, sir!"
[T],bzingaz,2012-04-03T03:57Z,@ Mrseeder ..i think u need to downloada it first before u comment ..it is 101% genuine...No need to be a douche..now it has been uploaded 100% so those were stuck can finish..enjoy..
,Toyzrs,2012-04-03T04:50Z,"Dont worry about Mr.Seeder.2012 he has been going into all of them and saying the same thing to try to get ppl to stop downloading, cause hes pissed cause he had to pay to watch it. It is wrestlemania 28:)"

,TanzeelKhan,2012-04-03T16:10Z,Not A Good Screen Result 
,TanzeelKhan,2012-04-03T16:11Z,Fogy and Unclear Print
[T],bzingaz,2012-04-03T18:20Z,@TanzeelKhan ..well you should not be expecting miracle here..after all its 4 hours stuff..if you want crystal clear print..there are many 2 gb torrents..what i have uploaded is watchable..and for low bandwidth guys..
,sid_ray,2012-04-03T20:21Z,please please seed!!
,MrFriendly,2012-04-04T08:08Z,"oh, and for me, the audio seemed to go out of sync by the time they got the the end of an era match. but that's EASILY fixed, just go to go audio synchronization in the vlc player, and put it to 1 second and it's perfect again.

@bzingaz : right you are. there's only one minor glitch very early on. i agree, this is a very good copy. put into perspective this is meant to be over 2GB's! the quality whilst not sharp HD is very good.

thanks for this upload, i was worried i wasn't going to get to watch it until today but this was a good download and i enjoyed mania despite the first match. thanks for the upload!"
,wwefanz,2012-04-04T14:27Z,@Bzingaz:Bro plz plz do me a favr...can u give d name or link of site where u downloaded it??

[T],bzingaz,2012-04-08T10:38Z,@sisco955 sure u would have but not in this size..there are many 2 gb torrents out there..u can get them..
,analloyd,2012-04-12T22:37Z,"Csn anyone tell me why I cant't play some torrents with media player? Is there another programme or file I wlll need?
Thanks"
[T],bzingaz,2012-04-14T06:53Z,u can use vlc or media player classic which comes with k-lite codec pack..both are free..u can find them on google..
