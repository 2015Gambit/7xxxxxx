"The Stable Boy"

Emma continues her exhaustive search for 
evidence that will prove Mary Margaret's 
innocence in the murder of David's wife, 
Kathryn. Meanwhile, in the fairytale land that 
was and before evil blackened her soul, Regina 
must choose between betraying her mother, Cora 
and marrying for true love, or betrothing 
royalty and living a regal - but loveless - 
life; and the event that caused the Evil Queen 
to loathe Snow White is revealed.
