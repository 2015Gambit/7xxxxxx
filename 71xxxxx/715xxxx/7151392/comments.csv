,The_Processor,2012-04-01T23:22Z,this is kinda pissing me off....i missed the race today and now this is downloading extremely slow...
,SooperX77,2012-04-01T23:35Z,Nice job. Now if only they didn't have all that extra shit like talking to the riders. They only mention sponsors anyway. If they cut it down to only racing the fast forward button would get a lot less use. Blame Speed channel I guess.
,Blueoctober712,2012-04-02T00:37Z,no it is true. I did in fact get a hand job from temp171's mom at the race. Stop lying temp!!
