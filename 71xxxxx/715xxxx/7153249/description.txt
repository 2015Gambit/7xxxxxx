From CineFete's website:
He is the most secretive political leader on earth. A grotesque dictator with the finger on the nuclear trigger. But since 2008 Kim Jong Il knows heΓÇÖs dying. The tyrant has started a race against the clock to perpetuate his regime. A mad bet which might well impact the worldΓÇÖs peace.
