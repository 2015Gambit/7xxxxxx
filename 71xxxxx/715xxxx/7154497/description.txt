In Toronto, Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), the bass guitarist for the band "Sex Bob-omb", begins dating high schooler Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) much to the disapproval of his friends. Scott meets an American girl, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who has been appearing in his dreams, and becomes obsessed with her, losing interest in Knives. While playing in a battle of the bands sponsored by one "G-Man Graves" for a record deal, Scott is attacked by Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha), who introduces himself as the first of Ramona's "evil exes". Scott defeats Patel and learns from Ramona that, in order for them to date, he must defeat all seven of her evil exes.
