,MrFriendly,2012-04-02T15:47Z,"No comments? What up with that? A/V? How is this torrent different from the other ones in terms of quality? And is it me or does that screenshot look like it's from a Raw episode?

Cheers."

,benboy_7777,2012-04-02T23:31Z,After downloaded and maybe unzipped (haven't downloaded yet because i am scared it will be too big for dvd) is it too big for a 4.71 GB 120 minute DVD?
,Infecthead,2012-04-02T23:56Z,"@Pimpmobile If you don't like it, why'd you even search for the torrent and comment on it?
@Benboy The only file downloaded is an .AVI so that's the total file size. Ergo, it will fit on a 4GB DVD"

,daeloki,2012-04-06T11:26Z,"2.1GB for something that isn't even good enough resolution to be considered standard definition?  Typical file size for this quality should be around 450MB or so, either the encoding/compression sucks, or there is something hidden within the video file like a rogue script, or virus."
,mistermechanic,2012-04-07T04:10Z,There is nothing wrong with the audio or the video and there is no virus
,mistermechanic,2012-04-08T06:30Z,What is wrong with you assholes (too many too mention). I know for a fact that this copy is good quality and download land is infected! THE WORLD HAS GONE MAD
