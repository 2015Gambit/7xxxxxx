Finding Shakespeare

Arts Documentary hosted by Lenny Henry, published by ITV broadcasted as part of ITV Perspectives series in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Lenny Henry tells the story of how he fell in love with Shakespeare and how, once he broke through the language barrier, the experiences and emotions Shakespeare wrote about spoke to him. He talks to fellow enthusiasts about what they love about the plays and the writing. He also seeks out some actors who think that Shakespeare's language is just too difficult. Cameras follow Lenny in rehearsals as he tries to prove these fellow thespians wrong and also attempts to convert a group of schoolchildren from his home town who refuse to buy into the Bard. As Lenny prepares to make his National Theatre debut in The Comedy of Errors, he communicates his passion for Shakespeare with warmth, wit and humour.
