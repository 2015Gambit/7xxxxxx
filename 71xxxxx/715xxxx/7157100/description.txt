I elected not to include the film as there are already many copies out there.
However, if people are interested, and I get a few requests, I will upload similar ISO files for disc 1 and 2 which, obviously has the film plus 3 Audio Commentaries and "Branching to behind the scenes featurettes"

Finally PLEASE have patience and share my upload rate could be better.
