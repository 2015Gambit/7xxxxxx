I would also like to request the disc 1 & 2.
Yes there are other versions out there, but most are PAL or the 4:3 ratio crunched with the bars at the top and bottom to give a really small picture on the big screen. If you have the true anamorphic widescreen in NTSC..... I think alot of us would really appreciate the upload.
Again... Thank You Beolab1700!!"
