Queen Rocks is a compilation album by the English rock band Queen, released in 1997.

The album is a selection of songs from Queen's heavier side. It also contained one new track, "No-One But You (Only the Good Die Young)", which is a gentle ballad. This song began life as a track for Brian May's solo album Another World (1998); the remaining members chose to record it as a bookend for their career as Queen. It was the last original studio recording from the 1990s featuring Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon (and the first Queen recording without Freddie Mercury).

The album is unique to the Queen catalogue, as it deliberately does not follow the standard "greatest hits" collection format. Some hits are present ("We Will Rock You", "Fat Bottomed Girls"), while other tracks included were never released as singles anywhere ("Put Out the Fire" and "Sheer Heart Attack"). The album also contains a remake of the pop rocker "I Can't Live With You", with a much louder and heavier guitar and more aggressive drumming.
