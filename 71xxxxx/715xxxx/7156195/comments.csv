,lechia44,2012-04-05T03:33Z,"Seriously sceneline?  You post a torrent and then don't seed it so that at least a few good seeds get it???  Also why zip the files, at least we'd be able to watch it while it was ""mostly"" downloaded, but since it's zipped I can't even be sure it's not a fake."
,Pie_Writ,2012-04-05T15:09Z,"Thank you for the upload.
