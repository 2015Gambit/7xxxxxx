Many leechers will appear to have zero percent of the torrent, because they have no complete chunks yet.  Just leave it in your client for a while like you would any other torrent, and you should get the torrent in the same amount of time you would have with the normal chunk sizes."

Yes, if everyone is having a problem with this torrent I can re-up it.  My understanding is taht while most leechers will show 0, they are receiving content and will get the torrent.  Are you a seeder, micron?  "
