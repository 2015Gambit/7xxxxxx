LIVE FROM THE ARTISTS DEN: THE BLACK CROWES

 “Without the audience it means nothing.”
Chris Robinson.

Fans of the Black Crowes should not  to miss this episode of “Live from the Artists Den” 
Southern rock heroes The Black Crowes carried   their classic sound to the picturesque town of Oxford, Mississippi for a special performance at a former silent movie house in the "Little Easy." Built in 1913, The Lyric Theatre provided a historic setting for the band's first Artists Den appearance, a rollicking concert featuring both fan favorites and songs from their last album, Before the Frost...


Episode taped on September 2009 , features the Black Crowes performing 10 songs; there are also several interview segments with Chris.

Discerning music lovers who admire the band’s deep catalog will appreciate the range of material offered up over the course of 60 minutes. 

Things close out with the band roaring through the retro rock ‘n’ roll of “Thick n’ Thin.” There are few modern-day bands that jam with the kind of raucous and rollicking abandon of the Crowes without losing control and falling off the rails. 

If you are a fan of the Black Crowes – or rock ‘n’ roll that celebrates the past and present – make sure to catch this  great hour of music, courtesy of “Live from the Artists Den”
