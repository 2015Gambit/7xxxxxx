ColoradoΓÇÖs ill-Mannered spawned in May of 2011. Its concept was simple in design; deliver high-energy, danceable music, while also maintaining a level of musicality that is not commonly seen in electronic music. BIG BEATS, BIG BASS, Song structure and IMPACT are what this band does best. ill-Mannered is a trio of 2 producers and one nasty drummer that do not tread lightly in the studio or on stage. Their truly versatile sound incorporates elements of hip-hop, dub, funk and rock into a roaring electronic soundscape.
