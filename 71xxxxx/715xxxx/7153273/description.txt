Notes

Reason for READNFO... well 1st off got the arabic HD Cam in 3 pieces but was still missing a lil 
so used the russian release to cut in the missing pieces and fix som of the camera movement and sum 

blur
spots.. there are still sum blurry spots but oh well can fix it all and still has sum hardcoded arabic
subtitles.. so had the thing in quiet a few pieces to fix all properly adjusted everything under the 

sun
then just synced up littlebirds LiNE to the encode.... enjoy all.. may work on a V2 using the russian 

vid as main
and substitute parts of arabic cam into it... we will see im kinda tired of this movie right now...lol
