,maxmaxpayne,2012-04-02T16:15Z,"since there are requests, i know it could be troubling to deliver but could someone please start bootlegging in a newer good quality cinema with a really good camera, and get digital line audio, or just use a half decent recording device.

i would do it myself but am not that well connected in the cinema industry.

if you agree with the above please copy and post it everywhere."

This is watchable and fine if you can't wait for a better copy. The movie however is as badly created as the first one was. They should have stuck with the original storyline and be done with it."

you said ""i would do it myself but am not that well connected in the cinema industry.""

translated: I would do it myself but I'm to much of a pussy.

thx for the up op."
