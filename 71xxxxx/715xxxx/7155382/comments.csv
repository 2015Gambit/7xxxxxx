,jorjab99,2012-04-03T15:45Z,Thank you for the avi which my preferred  download
,Wizzern,2012-04-03T18:51Z,"Thanks, AVIs are ok, but nothing beats the excellent quality/size ratio of a good MP4 [yet].
They're both containers so the content can be the same, but in any situation I'd pick MP4 over AVI, if only to get rid of the Microsoft smell. ;)"
,Grindosaurus,2012-04-04T00:11Z,"Thanks for the .avi!

Until my Xbox and PS3 can play MP4's, AVI is the way to go."

,KrazyKrl,2012-04-04T12:54Z,"I play MP4 files on my XBOX 360 just fine. Had to modify the registry a bit to get windows media sharing to acknowledge them. (Google it)

But h264 encoded mp4 files play just fine for me."
