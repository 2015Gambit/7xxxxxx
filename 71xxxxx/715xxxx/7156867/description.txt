Second Sight emphasizes stealth and minor puzzle-solving over brute force. Vattic uses psionic abilities to supplement his conventional weapons. Being spotted triggers an alarm mode, increasing the number of guards and they search for Vattic. The majority of the psychic powers are meant to be used defensively, avoiding detection or healing wounds.

The Psychic Powers are:

Telekinesis
Healing
Psi Blast
Charm
Projection
