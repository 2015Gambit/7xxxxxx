Latest version required. ?? I already downloaded the latest version and it keeps saying the same thing. Any advice anyone?"
,girtas_123,2012-04-17T13:00Z,"Maybe try installing an older version of adobe air? http://helpx.adobe.com/air/kb/archived-air-sdk-version.html I didn't need to update mine, maybe the new one screws the game up."
,girtas_123,2012-04-17T13:06Z,"Also, check your current adobe air version with help  from this link http://helpx.adobe.com/air/kb/determine-version-air-runtime.html My ""Adobe AIR.dll"" file version is 1.5.0.7220 and the game works fine"

,arandomguy452,2012-05-07T16:12Z,"thanks for uploading this. i was planning on buying it when i got $10 on steam. but until then, i shall play the pirated version. and only a 30 second download to boot!"
,arandomguy452,2012-05-07T16:55Z,"oh, i have a bit of a problem. after playing for almost an hour, my sound randomly turned itself off in the game. and i have no idea how to turn the game's sound back on. did anyone else have this problem?...."
,arandomguy452,2012-05-07T16:59Z,"oh, nevermind! the game has a mute button. if you press the O key, it mutes the game. all fixed now. i kinda slapped myself for my stupidity there... then again, it is 9 AM. and sorry for the 3 comments."
,Ghost_In_The_Shell,2012-05-25T19:18Z,thnx for upload. A nice Swedish audio review of the game: http://www.skillpoint.se/podradio/indieklubben-5-lone-survivor
,nnlmmest,2012-06-23T19:56Z,"Somehow the in-game X button is not working for me. After interact with something, I must use Space bar or Enter to ""refocus"" to the game to be able to use the X button. The ""New Game - Continue"" selection is fine, though. "
