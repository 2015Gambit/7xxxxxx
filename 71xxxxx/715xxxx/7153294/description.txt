The Killing is based on the wildly successful
Danish television series Forbrydelsen and tells 
the story of the murder of a young girl in 
Seattle and the subsequent police investigation. 
The Killing ties together three distinct stories
around a single murder including the detectives 
assigned to the case, the victim's grieving family,
and the suspects. Set in Seattle, the story also 
explores local politics as it follows politicians
connected to the case. As the series unfolds, it 
becomes clear that there are no accidents; everyone
has a secret, and while the characters think they've
moved on, their past isn't done with them.
