Have you ever wondered what it would be like to run your own fully working farm? Looking after chickens, sheep and cows, producing cakes, wool, butter and cheese. If you fancy giving it a go without having to get up at the crack of dawn every day Farm Frenzy is the game for you! In the style of time-management games like Diner Dash youΓÇÖll have to work hard to achieve your goals, whether thatΓÇÖs owning a certain number of animals, producing a specific number of goods or simply racking up a huge profit.
Farm Frenzy has 48 action-packed levels to keep you busy, starting from simple egg collecting tasks to the rigours of producing cheese, woollen cloth and cakes all at the same time. To help you along the way you can upgrade various parts of your farm, from the vehicle you use to transport the goods to market, to the warehouse you can store goods in, even the buildings that produce the goods. Soon youΓÇÖll be producing vast quantities of products and turning over a huge profit.
As well as the standard upgrades the really canny player may unlock special VIP bonuses, these include super-fast transport vehicles, automatic water-pumps and discount cards to secure cheaper purchasing of animals for your farm!
With bright vibrant graphics, a great soundtrack and more fun than an afternoon at the petting zoo, Farm Frenzy will have you hooked.
