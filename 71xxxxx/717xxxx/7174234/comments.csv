,artisto1,2012-04-13T12:29Z,"For those who experience NOTHING after installing this crack (like Garviell or Rabbitfish, I may have a solution:
1. Download and install Total War Shogun from SKIDROW (some 23 GB) if you don't have them yet
2. download Total.War.Shogun.2.Fall.of.the.Samurai-SKIDROW-CrackOnly from Mbb15, unrar it and copy paste ALL OF THE FILES it into the directory where you have installed the game (ec: F:Program files/SEGA/Shogun2 Fallof thesamurai)
3. Download this crack (Total War Shogun 2 Fall of the Samurai CRACK FIX!), unrar then copy paste all of the files (including the steamfucker.dll) and replace EXCEPT shogun2.exe into the previous directory where you install the game
4. Click  the Shogun2.exe file
5. Enjoy the game

@ all the people who fail even after reading artisto1's explanation:

Start over.
Get rid of everything(EVERYTHING exept iso's from shogun 2/shogun 2 rots/fots).
If you don't have those, download the Shogun 2 from FLT(12.37gb). Install it.
Download Shogun 2 FOTS SKIDROW(22.35gb).

The difference between these and the skidrow versions are what cause the game both not to launch for me and fix the CTD after a few turns.

,RegPulp,2012-04-15T16:26Z,"this game is heavily protected, although SKIDROW has done a good job this time round, unfortunately SKIDROW still has left some protection behind, this crackfix posted here, although again he/she did a good job removing/bypassing further protection from the game, again some protection is still left behind.

you must understand this games protection system gets refined as well with each new patch, the offsets have to be corrected and i can tell you now, there a hundreds of them hidden throughout the code...... many only take place on certain intervals, like every 4 turns, or on turn 48-52 kind of thing, and these BLIND offsets are hard to find, they have been designed to stay hidden within the code, and it only takes one of them to cause instability of the game.

people the original game is only £4.99 now on amazon, £15 for the complete set.... £15 all in, that's it..... most of us have played this game in some form or another by now, either buy the game, or always use cracks that will NEVER work fully..... these are your ONLY two choices.

i have decided that when i can i will buy the game of amazon (very cheap now, £15 for two games in one, plus a big DLC included, very good deal)
and in DVD form aswell.

SKIDROW as well as others now, have tried several times to do this game, it's been nothing but trouble for nearly everyone, and those who say it works for them..... well there will always be exceptions to every rule. but for most of us, since build 3444 this game protection system has proven to time consuming for most crackers to find the hundred+ offsets that need to be found in the code to make this game worth cracking.

10 points for skidrow for keep trying, but they have never got it right since build 3444, and how long ago was that!

the game is cheap now, the first one is only £5 on amazon UK (very good reliable supplier)

,ZalHack,2012-04-29T08:55Z,"Sorry my previous comment was based on the original crack provided in the 22 gig shogun 2 download. And yes I have tried this crack but it crashes after 3 or 5 seconds I ran it as administrator and I also tried all the service packs avalible in the compatibility list.

Please guys help me out on this one!

I also deleted the creative assembly shogun folder not even that helped.

All I can do is play it only with the provided crack in the 22 gig shogun 2 download but there it crashes so far it only crashes in battles that I engage in. Never got farther then one turn in campain mode because of it.

As for this crack as soon as I apply it it just wont start I'll provide the error code here appone the crash:

It instantly happens.

I also tried to mix the Shogun2.exe's from both cracks and still no success I even tried to delete the player name as someone sugguested in the skidrow.ini still no luck.

I installed the game fresh turned my internet off before I installed as well. Can't figure out that either I'm doing something wrong or I don't know please help!"
,artisto1,2012-04-29T14:05Z,Have you try to mix the crack from mbb15 with this crack? Try to apply the crack from mbb15 and then copy paste and replace with this crack EXCEPT the exe file (use exe file from mbb15 crack!) it work for me
,ZalHack,2012-04-29T17:57Z,"@artisto1

Thank you for your sugguestion have been running out of ideas of what to try next.
I'll try your idea and hope it will fix the problem of not being able to launch.
I'll write a how it went after I tiried."
,ZalHack,2012-04-29T18:18Z,"@artisto1

Your my hero!
Finally got it to work played one round and noooo damn crash in the battle like before. This is already a very good sign, before that I could not even play even one battle without a certain crash, I will play a good while and report if any other errors happen.

As for now I only did the mbb15 crack alone, I didn't mix it yet but seems that this crack did the trick for me. If I shall expiriance a crash I'll mix it like you sugguested before and see how that works.

Mnay thanks again made my day, and tahnks to Skidrow for the awesome download for this game. Before I had to use phoenix and other softwar and allot of files to update, I really enjoy that this is a really easy install with all DLC's and fully up to date.

Will have now 3 campains starting with the rise of the samurai till the fall of the samurai ;D"

3 problems
1. Loading screen still takes long
2. Still crashes at 4th - 5th term
3. windows thinks steam_fucker.dll is a virus
4. overall, it does not work for me.

any solutions?"

Its not a virus so you can allow it, as for insructions I can only help you as far as you have the 22 gig version download of shogun 2 here.

Go to that link and read there my last two comments on page 13 I think.

Good luck.

Sometimes it will run okay my biggest army fight consist of 40 units mine(2 generals) enemy 80 units and it works perfectly fine until the end. when i had ctd on a certain land battle ill just auto resolve and continue to next battle . im on low cause my computer specs is 32bit vista, dual core 2.1 and 2gb ram but i can play it all low except army and naval size large. ctd on land battles are real pain cause loading the game takes time"

any ideas?"
,NopeNopeNope,2012-05-08T06:40Z,"ATTENTION! I THINK I KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING THE 6030 CRT ERRORS!

It's steam_api.dll. Whenever I use an older version of steam_api.dll (from older cracks), Shogun 2 doesn't run, but it doesn't show the CRT error.

If I use a Rise of the Samurai crack, Shogun 2 runs, but it does not get past the splash screen.

PLEASE.

,ClemXII,2012-05-10T05:08Z,"Update:

The skidrow FoTS version and crack work to a certain extent. I can open game, I see a piracy warning under all clans, I play...I crash.

Now, when I USE THIS CRACK, the game doesn't even start. I have to physically click the .exe 3-6 times to see a steamstart file appear and then Shogun 2 pops up. But I get the splash screen followed by black screen indefinitely. 


My friend, who has an almost identical computer, is able to get this to work.

Both running W7 x64. He has little more ram than me, 16 DDR3. He has a GTX 560, I have a 570. He has a sandy and I have i7950.

For him, he double clicks, gets a box saying do you want to start Shogun 2, he then waits for game to load up.

I on other hand, get no pop up box, and simply see Smartsteam or something similar being created in Shogun2 folder if I click the .exe a ton of times. In which games sits on black screen forever."
,NopeNopeNope,2012-05-10T10:43Z,"Okay, I am bloody confused here.

I just tried a different crack, and I cleared its SKIDROW.ini file.


AND SHOGUN 2 FUCKING LAUNCHES

But then, after the splash screen, it crashes.

Also, it said to ""change this if you want steam_api.dll to..."" I forgot the rest.

See, thing is:

Steam_api.dll is to blame."
,NopeNopeNope,2012-05-10T10:54Z,"Okay,  I did some experimenting...

STEAM_API.DLL FUCKING SUCKS

In SKIDROW.ini, if I delete the appid, shogun 2 launches, BUT YOU CANNOT PLAY ANY OF THE CAMPAIGNS. If I don't, then I get the CRT 6030 DICKFUCK error.

This shit is driving me nuts.

Can anyone email SKIDROW on this?"

1-before doing anything be sure to install direct x, redist, flash 11. and for god sake update ur windows 
2- install skidrows version. run it one time to the menu screen without applying this crack. 
3- don't play or anything just exit to windows
4- apply this crack
5- play

,alphaecho,2012-05-24T05:27Z,"OK everyone, some of you may have trouble starting the game at all like I did (click the icon, nothing happens). It probably varies from person to person. However, it is something to do with one of your start up items.

Easiest way to fix this problem is to start your computer in safe mode. If it works, there will be a box asking you ""Launch Total War: Shogun 2? "". If this does work, then you will need to try and manually disable start up programs until you find which one is stopping you from starting Shogun 2 in normal mode.

Weird thing is, mine was the logitech set point."
,asmodeu,2012-05-24T09:50Z,"Now it makes sense.
Anonymous have been recruiting various computers (illegaly) into their botnet, for use in spamming and ddos attacks. 

This crack fix works perfectly, but they left a little trojan in steam_fucker.dll, which will consume your system's resources and it may (depending on local laws) forbid you access to the internet.

To be used with caution. "
