,pxpierre,2012-04-14T20:44Z,"Thanks to Regenzy1 & seeders!

I normally hate people making requests but nobody is uploading the most competitive/exiting motorcycle series IMO, the BSB British Superbikes on Eurosport.

MotoGP is like F1, baseball, etc, the budget of the teams are very unequal with ratio of uo to 10 to 1 contrary to NFL for example where all budgets are equal by redistribution and any team can win."
