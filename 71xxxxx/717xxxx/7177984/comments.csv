[T],3R01,2012-04-11T21:03Z,Thnx 4 the upload :D
,Mustikki,2012-04-11T22:08Z,Thanks!
,chipdip1,2012-04-11T23:12Z,"Currently playing the game! Definitely works, the DRM-free GOG installation is there. Thanks guys! Don't forget to support the devs, spend the $14 :)"
,Fanisos,2012-04-11T23:32Z,"You couldn't give 9,89Euros to download it from Steam??You don't even have 9,89 Euros??Come on now!"
,doodoo22,2012-04-11T23:42Z,I keep getting a message that the installation file is corrupt. Have redownloaded it 3 times already. No dice.
,Oromish,2012-04-12T00:26Z,Please do support the developers if you enjoy the game.
,helpmeout1983,2012-04-12T00:42Z,Is this game a remake of an old nes game called Eye of the beholder? I hope its not the same ending:/
,tinynik,2012-04-12T00:59Z,"Uh. No. I don't have any Euros. However if this game doesn't suck and I play it for more than three hours, I'll be happy to give them 14 bucks for it. Definitely not worth more than $15 though. I mean, there's not too much here."

,0xiDIzE,2012-04-12T06:09Z,"Hey guys, I’d really appreciate if you would support this developer. I’m not saying pirating is wrong or some BS like that, just saying that I think this game is absolutely, 100% worth the $13 it costs. It’s at least as good as most of the crap they call AAA and charge $60 for these days, if not better."
,0xiDIzE,2012-04-12T06:12Z,"@tinynik: I couldn't disagree more.  The only current dungeon in the game is about 15 hours to play through, but the developers have already pledged to add more dungeons later on, as well as provide an editor for user-made dungeons.  Not that any excuses need to be made for it as-is...it's already an instant classic.  Rave reviews coming from everywhere, and they weren't even paid for like you can expect from EA or Activision."
,steveo2778,2012-04-12T06:21Z,Downloading now! I've been looking forward to this game for weeks and just wanted to send out a huge THANKS! for getting this here on release day...You guys R O C K!
,hex1985,2012-04-12T08:37Z,works good on win7
,.Leto.,2012-04-12T10:13Z,Awesome game! Thanks
,akmranderson,2012-04-12T10:53Z,"Boughts this online yesterday. I download a crapload of AAA titles and most are the biggest load of shite ever.
This is really a worthwhile game, support these guys and me might have the next-gen world of Xeen in the future."
,nazgull2k10,2012-04-12T17:06Z,"downloading now.  Hope its as good as everyone is raving about.  

If it is, I might actually pay for it."
,leocruznt,2012-04-12T18:45Z,"Hey guys, I downloaded and installed this torrent but at the end of the installation it comes up with the 

""DeleteFile failed; code 5
Denied access""

Apparently it's an error with the goggame.dll and the game is all black, I can't see anything on the game, only torches, no walls, no floor, no ceiling, not even on the menu screen... I've googled for quite some time and I didn't found any good answers, and i know people here know about these things so... if you could help me it would be awesome, thanks."
,0xiDIzE,2012-04-12T22:49Z,@leocruznt: That's a problem that seems to arise when you have some settings forced though Catalyst.  Check to ensure that's not the case.
,druhklam_orbowetsch,2012-04-13T05:28Z,"Many thanks for the upload. Works perfectly and yes, we should spend the 9 Euros to buy it, it's a great old-school dungeon game! I just did..."
,opaleg,2012-04-13T07:51Z,"You cannot get ANY BETTER than this! Hands down the best CRPG I have played in years. Especially with the simplicity, but the strategy to this game has a life of it's own. It might look simple at first, but you really have to make use of the game play in order to do well."
,psdasila,2012-04-13T18:14Z,i like this game very much 
,schizoLur,2012-04-13T20:18Z,"I'm gonna add my voice to the chorus(and I'm delighted to see so many others) If you like this game please pay the few dollars to the guys at Almost Human,it took them ten years,several iterations(it was originally escape from fire mountain) and all their money to develop this absolutely stunning little gem of an old school dungeon crawl,if they get support their will be more classics from them and others,plus from talking to them online+ at their forum they are a really nice bunch of guys,a far cry from the dirt bags at most AAA studios,PLEASE support them!."
,bxl89,2012-04-14T12:11Z,"Awesome game, thanks for posting, just bought it after trying it out, pretty cheap on their official site."
,Epsilonian,2012-04-15T01:16Z,"Everything works except I have no textures, all the walls and stuff are just black. Help? Step 2 says to burn or mount the image also, but there's nothing to mount. Could that be part of the problem?"
,Nerwo,2012-04-16T00:51Z,Thanks!  The exe is a drm free copy of the game so just run it and it's installed.  Easy!
,Furious1964,2012-04-16T01:19Z,Anyone know how to enable Surround Sound capability for 5.1 speakers?
,valg2,2012-04-16T01:54Z,does anyone know of a trainer or a savegame editor for this game? I'm getting my ass seriously kicked in level 5 on hard
,nazgull2k10,2012-04-16T19:50Z,Game is absolutely awesome!  Just bought it.  They need some improvements though..  being able to use items from inventory needs to be a bit easier.  perhaps a hotbar.  And spellcasting is a nightmare on rollerskates... definitely needs reworked on that one.
,e8hffff,2012-04-17T03:55Z,"Just a note : this game works perfect under Linux with Wine.

I purchased the game before release.  Been playing for days and it's fantastic.  Bring back Dungeon Master memories.  Console games suck on PC, so this is a breath of fresh air for PC gamers and RPGers.  "
,tibrusjer,2012-04-17T06:33Z,"You tried the game now buy it!
http://www.grimrock.net/"
,Horvaticus,2012-04-17T07:53Z,"In all seriousness, the game is like, $10 on Steam. It deserves being bought. This is what more games need to be like. (DRM free, made by people who actually want to make good games that they believe in, etc)"
,BakaBaka11,2012-04-19T14:08Z,"lulz, its not RELOADED, its GoG installer and they make games DRM free.

And the usual: buy it if you like it."
,roimoi,2012-04-21T09:53Z,"when the program is run, there is the error message ""the program can't start because d3dx9_43.dll is missing from your computer...""  please help. thank you."

,Tjuh,2012-04-21T12:06Z,Can we get a torrent for the new version 1.1.4?
,Manadona,2012-04-21T20:32Z,It is an indie game that costs 15$! Pirating Indie games is like stealing from the poor. Shame on you all!
,magnum95,2012-04-26T01:01Z,"game works perfect, great torrent"
,pytech,2012-04-29T15:32Z,"Game works perfect.  It's a classic style RPG moving through dungeons one step at a time, etc.

,billyhalla,2012-05-14T06:38Z,Downloaded torrent... played for 2 hours... went to Grimrock website... bought it... played for 2 more hours... went to website... bought copy for best friend... played for a few more days... bought copy for another friend. I would have never played this game had I not downloaded it here. 
,kingzigzag,2012-06-14T09:50Z,i cant see my mouse pointer when i play.....what up wit dat?
,sanlander2,2012-07-01T22:46Z,"I was down at level 5 (Deserted hallways), I stopped went to the developers site and paid for my copy via amazon payments. This kind of effort deserves it."

< Same problem for me.. there is only auto_setup.exe nothing mountable here, game starts fine, but its all black.. wtf"
,LeitorDeQuadrinhos,2012-07-22T19:41Z,I had two dll problems. I solved both with Dll Fixer from http://www.dll-files.com/. But now I'm having the following problem when I try to run the game: http://i637.photobucket.com/albums/uu96/D3M0D3M0/error.png Someone knows how to solve it?
