The Grateful Dead albums
Anthem of the Sun (1968) and Aoxomoxoa (1969)
Original Mixes!!!

1 CD (no pause between tracks!) 77 minutes

Tracks 1-3, 12-13 are from the HDCD remastered Anthem of the Sun released in the Golden Road box set, 2001.

Tracks 4-11 constitute the original Aoxomoxoa album in its original incarnation. This is a vinyl rip, as this original mix was never released on CD. 

These Aoxomoxoa tracks came to me as 256kbs MP3 files. They are now FLAC because after I burned them to CD along with the higher quality Anthem of the Sun tracks, I ripped that CD to FLAC for you. Here it is.

Lineage: Anthem - CD to FLAC to CD to FLAC; Aoxomoxoa - Vinyl to 256kbs MP3 to WAV to FLAC to CD to FLAC
