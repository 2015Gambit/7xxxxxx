,cstraybeck,2012-04-11T15:30Z,"This isn't a dvd screener or anything like that, but it sure looks like it is. It's just one of those very, very, very good cameras. I noticed this because I heard people laughing in the backround at a certain points, and the bottom of the screen is cut. 

But don't worry, this is the best rip out yet.
