Note: dont know what it is
but cant be the old hd cam
it has a chinese intro nd
hardcoded subs witch i
cropped first lot left in
second as they dont pop up
as much but when i cropped
the first line of subs i
cropped the english when
needed out lol dont think
theres alot of places with
non english bits , but this
does remind me of the first
screener/r6 of mission -
impossible - with the subs
