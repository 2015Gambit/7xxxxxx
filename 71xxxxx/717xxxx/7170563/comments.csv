,kevduch,2012-04-09T06:09Z,This IS tonight's episode. It was leaked last week though..
,Lone_Ocelot,2012-04-09T10:55Z,"Thanks for the effort. Your upload has the best quality available.

But would it be possible to upload future episodes in .mkv? Those .ts-files don't work with .srt-subtitles."
,amisnaru,2012-04-09T13:58Z,"@Lone_Ocelot

Works fine with .srt subs for me, just renamed the subs for ""720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE"" to this.
Using Media Player Classic + ffdshow.

But yeah, thanks for the up, this show deserves this kind of quality."
,Rawbrry,2012-04-09T16:12Z,Yet again the best quality available.  Thanks a million.
,SugarGuY,2012-04-09T19:15Z,"Thanks man, by any chance can you upload spartacus lase season in this awesome resolution, thanks"
,profplump,2012-04-10T12:21Z,"The title and description both say 5.1 audio, but I'm only seeing an AC3-2.0 track. Am I missing something?"
,Ponyoo,2012-04-10T16:56Z,"Super!  Cheers, mate."
,cayrikan,2012-04-13T03:02Z,"why is it 29.970 fps and not 24 fps? could yield smaller size. also mkv would be great, im sure most media players can play that now."
