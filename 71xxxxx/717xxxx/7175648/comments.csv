Pretty Good Rip, 2 Tracks for English & Russian

Not Long to download"
,Carjacker,2012-04-17T16:20Z,"For a TS ,not bad, BUT video is extremely grainy and pixelated -very much so in fast moving scenes or dark scenes- and for the English audio, it is not synced up or clear against background effects. 
Having hardcoded Asian language is annoying at the least.
Video=6
Audio=6"

,ThadiousJayble,2012-05-07T19:26Z,"@immagical R5, in the film business, is a copy of a movie made with a telecine machine from an analog source and is typically of a lower quality than other region releases."
,themadguru,2012-05-10T15:13Z,"@saint84 @immagical
Just to clarify the types of releases out there, read this:-
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirated_movie_release_types

This one is certainly not a screener, nor R5 quality.  Wait for a true DVDRip to be released before downloading a film that really requires a high quality to be enjoyed."
