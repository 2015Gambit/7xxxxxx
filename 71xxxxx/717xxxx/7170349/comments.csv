,stevesquirtle,2012-04-10T13:25Z,"i just wanted to ask  ,, i downloaded almost every single one of ur upload anime ,, but the episode 12 and 13 of fate zero is not working ,,is it okay for you to upload it? and what's the difference between the blu ray quality and 720p?

Steve from Phil."
,stevesquirtle,2012-04-10T16:52Z,",,hi again ,,,, i would just like to ask a favor if it's just fine with you,, i already have bleach episode 1 to 150  and i already have all the bleach movies 1 to 4 ,, and it would be a shame if i were to download it all again ,,would you mind if i ask you to upload bleach episodes 150 to 366 only? "
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-10T18:29Z,"steve all you need to do is download this torrent open it
and when it comes up in Utorrent 
click the little arrow next to torrent option and it should show you all the 16seasons and click select none then pick out the epiosdes you need
 which are seasons 8+ "
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-10T18:32Z,"Blu ray Quality is the highest Quality for anime

While most 720p without the Blu ray as source are mostly Upscales Tv streams.
they look great but nothing compare to blu rays

I will be uploading Fate Zero Blu ray in a couple of hours stay tune

Steve are you using windows Media Player Classic for your anime viewing if not i suggest you download K-lite Pack Mega just search it up on google."
,stevesquirtle,2012-04-11T05:52Z,"nope , im using the latest version of vlc player and i already have a k lite codec pack ,,hmm thanks bro ,,"
,stevesquirtle,2012-04-11T05:56Z," i m using bittorrent not u torrent,, how should i do it for bittorrent?"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-11T06:13Z,"Steve, Im sure the same applies for Bittorrent
if not it does not hurt to download Utorrent."

Good job on the torrent! 

I enjoy anime best with Japanese audio :D"

,Notilhenger,2012-06-03T17:47Z,"It seems there's no subs for the 3rd movie, Fade to Black. There's english and japanese audio but no english subs :(

Ah well it's not hard to find some custom subs to go with it, just wanted to let you know"

[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-19T23:21Z,For the 3rd movie the subs are in PGS format. Use MPC for that movie.

,rumml,2012-07-16T03:05Z,"I don't understand, why you had to muxx this with Vorbis Audio, I wasted so many hours today onto trying this to convert properly so I could play it on my Telli. Seriously I do understand that releasing something like this ain't easy but people like you should consider using Codecs, any Player can handle e. g. any TV. It ain't hard to format this properly from the start, I deleted your stuff and I'm gonna get another one. Thank you for wasting my time."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-16T21:47Z,"rummi, your welcome, i could care less what you think. if you want the best buy the DVD and stop being an ass."
,CR45YU5ER,2012-07-20T15:41Z,"rummi go suck on a fat one dumb cunt, someone goes to the trouble of uploading why can't you be bothered to just write them then to ask the question:

""What did you use to encode?...""

it's that simple -_- freakin school kids do not belong here. Me personally im waiting for teh blu-ray rips but nice job Daman4Iife.

YARHARHARHARHARHAR!!!"

,Kez53,2012-08-24T03:32Z,"Great, great download!   Thanks so much for uploading it! 
I thought you might want to know, though; episode 10 cuts off partway through. But, hey, at least it's not a very important episode xD"
,yousucktorrent,2012-08-29T16:57Z,Where is Season 1? its only movies 1-4 and seasons 2-16
,EddieToles91,2012-09-05T02:03Z,"I'm done seeding this thing. I seeded 37.7 GB. It took me a long time since my Up Speed is only 100-115 KB. Great Torrent. My only complaint is, I wish the episodes were in Jap. with subtitles by default. Anyway, Thanks!"

,Gduff99,2012-09-23T02:49Z,"for some reason i cant get the subtitles to show up at all let alone in english starting on episode 132...it worked just fine on episode 131, but after that nothing...i have checked the next 5 and they dont have any subtitles...anyone have any idea what is wrong because i would rather not have to redownload all those seasons"
,Arzaniite,2012-09-25T08:51Z,How come people are so horribly bad at seeding?
