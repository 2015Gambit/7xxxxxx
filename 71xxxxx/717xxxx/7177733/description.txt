Finaly, Here comes the working Drivers and Software from Honestech with Serial V2.5

You don't need to install the Driver under Windows 7 x86 and x64 because, there is a Driver for the Philips saa173x in Windows Update. Under Windows 7, you need to install the Software only... Serial included, the Software ask for the Serial, first time, when you start the Software... The Software is Multilanguage...


Enjoy
