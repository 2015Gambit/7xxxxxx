,ClaymooreEOC,2012-05-04T13:06Z,"The episode of april 18th ""Touch of Death, part I"" is apparently missing. I have only been able to find fakes so far. All the torrents here of ep 21 are in fact ep 22 ""Touch of Death, part II""."
,ClaymooreEOC,2012-05-05T12:42Z,Ok the missing episode is Hawaii 5-0 ep 0221. Its a crossover.
