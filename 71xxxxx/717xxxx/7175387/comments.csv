It has to be renamed as FLV file!!!!"
,r-ardilla,2012-04-11T02:14Z,"helder1965- Or one can simply use VLC which plays the file with no problem.

By far this episode is my fave of the show so far. Tigress' icy exterior gets melted away briefly- not by Po."
[T],helder1965,2012-04-11T02:26Z,"r-ardilla, thanks for raise my expectation about this episode! o/

About correct extension, I use VLC also, so no problem!
Just the correct information of this file is a FLV, as given by G-Spot, media analisys software!"
