,srog123,2012-04-20T12:24Z,I feel bad torrenting an indie game but I'll preorder as soon as I have the money.
,0rochimaru,2012-04-25T04:24Z,Why only Magnets link?  Why no torrent file?
,AzzaXe,2012-05-03T10:00Z,"Fuckin' Magnets, how do they work?"
,erktheerk,2012-05-04T16:18Z,"Always a clown hater around to regurgitate some done to death meme in the hopes of being a cooler newfag than the rest.

 Magnet links are the new and improved way piratebay will bring you their content. sooner or later all links will be magnets. File size and portability are the driving factors. Law suits, criminal cases, and raids as of late have driven a few sites i visit to do this. the SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, watever they call it for now spy on u 24/7 in the name of commercial profit debacle we are doing little to stop continues to shut down sites around the world this will become more common if not standard. With a full magnet link system the down time for pirate bay in reduced to hours or a day instead of days and weeks. Check the bottom links occasionally for all kinds of fresh news and exploitation of the sites progress. Posting a comment when a simple search would have work is a lazy and unproductive way to consume server bandwidth and shows armature users a quick way to ignore

,xXL1ZARDXx,2012-05-06T11:05Z,"This torrent is a virus, it injects itself into your files! It made my laptop crash every time I start it up, and click on the taskbar. Do Not Download"
,xhizors,2012-05-14T05:46Z,"Right... anyway, no viruses. Wish I had a better computer than a laptop, so I could play this though. Definitely worth preordering, if that's your thing. Watched this install, and saw what it did, and it didn't do anything out of the ordinary. Nice upload, thanks a bunch. Decent download speed too."
,darkness83,2012-05-17T17:27Z,"I got a problem with mine, each time I try to launch the game it immediatly crashes"
,Nateboy57,2012-05-29T04:03Z,can you upload alpha 180? 
,CornThatLefty,2012-05-30T00:29Z,"There's a problem with the game itself.
Whenever I die, there's no retry button, so I have to restart the entire application. Also, there's no menu when I press escape; only editing tools. So I have to restart the application to choose a new level as well.

NOTE TO THE PEOPLE RECEIVING CRASHES:
Crashes are usually caused by a faulty GPU. The game won't run on your average dad's computer. Also, the game is 100% virus-free. It doesn't infect anything."
,H1bbe,2012-05-31T02:32Z,"Cornythatlefty, not only are you torrenting a indie game, but you are also too stupid to realize the simplest keybinds and apperently your idiotism is the games fault, because you gave them all your money and they didn't give you something they enjoyed.

Im alright with torrenting things made by people who don't know what to do with all the money the got, but these indie developers are really nice.

and you are complaining about something you did not even buy."
