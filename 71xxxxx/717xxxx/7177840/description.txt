 Marc Roessler | 36 Pages | 260 Kb |

DESCRIPTION:

While it was easy to spot cameras twenty years ago due to their large size, 
this has become increasingly difficult during the last decade. Cameras have become much smaller and 
consume a fraction of the power they did ten years ago. Due to this, covert installation in nearly 
any imaginable place is possible. This paper will show methods frequently used for hiding cameras as well as 
methods to detect and locate covertly installed cameras.
