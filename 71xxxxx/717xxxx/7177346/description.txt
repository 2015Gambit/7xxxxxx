Bj√∂rn J:son Lindh  is a Swedish flautist, keyboardist and composer. Although Lindh is a flautist, he has made use of various synthesizers on many of his recordings. Some of his songs are relatively experimental, using up-to-date technology and instruments of that time, such as the Synclavier which he made use of on the album Atlantis.
