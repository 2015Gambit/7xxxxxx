Publishing this because moron Anti-FileSharing Agency BREIN is trying to block proxy protocol and putting pressure on VPN providers because of massive usage to TPB or any pother File Sharing website... which is huge censorship doesn't matter what country you are from.

Easy steps building your own proxy...

STEP 1.) Download this torrent (Duuh!)
STEP 2.) Unzip & Upload it to a server that supports php ( Try google "Easy PHP"). (Server's IP will be your proxy's IP)
STEP 3.) Go to that index.php file online.

You just set up a php web proxy. Have fun visiting TPB!
 
P.S. FU BREIN!
