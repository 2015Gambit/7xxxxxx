Your other upload of this has been deleted.

With torrents that you create for upload to TPB, you don't need to include any trackers.
The web site automatically edits every uploaded file to add our preferred trackers to the top of the tracker list, and to remove any trackers that we do not approve of.

In this day and age of DHT (Distributed Hash Table), the need for using torrent trackers has basically become obsolete.
The people who collect long lists of trackers, also known as tracker mongers, are those who don't really understand how the bit torrent protocol works.
If they did understand, they wouldn't bother assembling their tracker lists. "
