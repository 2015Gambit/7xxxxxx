,GateKeeper13,2012-04-10T17:20Z,Thanks mate! I always prefer the non cropped versions so that I can hardcode my greek subs over the old ones. Quality looks ok :-)

,theeccentrik,2012-04-11T00:54Z,"Poor quality and the indoor/night scenes are pitch black, even worse than the cams on PB.

Also having the DVDSCR is a little scammy as you know fine it's not a screener.

,theeccentrik,2012-04-11T09:27Z,@Heavydiamond if you think this video quality is an 8 then imagine how your brain will explode when someone shows you an invention called Bluray!!!!
,heavydiamond,2012-04-11T13:47Z,"comment based on R6 OR TS/CAM as these region releases are normally below industry quality
