[V],wushdishmeen,2012-04-10T01:46Z,"Just a heads up.  Howard will only be doing 2 shows this week because of the AGT tapings on Wednesday and Thursday.  So today was the first and tomorrow is the last and then there will be no live shows the rest of the week.

I will be at the AGT tapings so if anyone is going to the NY shows maybe I'll see you there!

peace & love"
