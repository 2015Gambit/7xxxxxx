I prefer single mothers courageously feeding and raising their children, dedicated teachers, cops, firefighters, nurses, etc, etc. No wonder unemployment rate is higher amongst ex-military, who wants psychologically damaged trained killers in their working environment that can go postal any time?

That said thanks to VTV & seeders!"
