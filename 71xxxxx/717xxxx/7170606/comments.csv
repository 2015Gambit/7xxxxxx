,misterjaypeg,2012-04-09T06:27Z,"Dude, shaddup. So it takes you 40 seconds to unpack a .rar file from one of THE most trusted uploaders on TBP.

Lazy douche..."

[V],sceneline,2012-04-09T19:22Z,one seeder and 1000 leechers how can you get? 
,balanced,2012-04-10T02:33Z,40 seconds to unpack a RAR times how many thousands for every copy downloaded is how much wasted time and electricity in the world?  If the lousy poster would spend 40 seconds unrarring it before posting then that's all the time and electricity that would be used and others wouldn't have to waste theirs.
,Hancock79,2012-04-11T06:17Z,i'm glad it takes you angsty bitches so long to download it.  thanks sceneline
,Hancock79,2012-04-11T06:18Z,"and like you really give a shit about your carbon footprint Balanced, STFU"
,balanced,2012-04-17T13:01Z,If I didn't care I wouldn't bother to straighten this nonsense out now would I?
,balanced,2012-04-17T13:05Z,Oh - and btw so you know - I care enough that I never dl scenline's uselessly RAR'd ups anymore and continually post comments against them advising others to do the same so that eventually out of date nntp boys get the picture that RAR's are not an appropriate format for torrents.
