White Resistance Manual - V 2.4 [Team Nanban][TPB]


DESCRIPTION:

Yesterday I posted info about the  Al Qaeda Training Manual so I think its only fair 
to post information about the  White Resistance Manual I don't care what kind of people read this stuff 
everyone has the right to their own opinion if you are not a white supremacist and you are going to read it, 
this material could obviously offend you, but now about the book. This is a white supremacist handbook similar 
to The Anarchist Cookbook. It promotes the founding of white supremacist leaderless cells, 
and is an instructional manual on several illegal activities, such as weapon-making and terrorism. 
The book was popular on neo-Nazi websites until it attracted media and law enforcement attention, 
causing many sites to take it down. It is still out there on some websites and is still circulating around 
and should not be too hard find
