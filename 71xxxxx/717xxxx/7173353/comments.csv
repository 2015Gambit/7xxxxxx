,voltrix128,2012-04-11T00:08Z,Thank you works fine!
,bomofoo,2012-04-11T02:59Z,Any chance of getting the updated railworks 3 version this is for railworks 2. The update is free from the aerosoft website if you bought the route. Thanks for the upload.
,showitoff,2012-04-11T06:03Z,I downloaded this thinking it was for Railworks 3. I installed it and it works perfectly fine! THanks for the upload harz_er! Again another great route with some detailed and very fine scenery!
,pop72,2012-04-11T09:22Z,Works fine in rw3. Thanks harz_er.
,bomofoo,2012-04-11T14:41Z,Yes it will work in railworks 3 but it isn't updated for railworks 3. Anything from railworks 2 will work in railworks 3 but without all the bells and whistles. Just to clarify bells and whistles is a figure of speech.
