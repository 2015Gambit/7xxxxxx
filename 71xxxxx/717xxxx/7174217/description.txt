App Locker II protect your private apps artfully


Γÿà What's the best app protector? 

Strong password? Of course NOT. The best proector would let prier not be aware of any protection. App Locker II is one such protector to protect your private apps.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Γÿà How it works?

When launching a protected app, it will throw a fake crash error which may mislead guest user into thinking that your app has a glitch or something. So it can stop guest from using your protected app in a natural manner.
For owner, it provides several secret unlock methods to unlock it without a trace. Of course, it also provides a password protection with a secret input method.
