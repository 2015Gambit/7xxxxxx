I had tickets for this show, but our car broke down.  By the time we made it from Olympia to Seattle, hitchhiking, there was only about fifteen minutes left of the show, and they wouldn't let us in.  So pissed.  I was 16 years old then, and I never had the chance to see them in concert.

I appreciate you taking the time to put this up for us, and I am sorry that more people didn't say ""thanks"".  People suck, sometimes.  :)"
