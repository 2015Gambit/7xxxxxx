,krisrdj,2012-04-12T19:13Z,If you have any problems with the game and are on W7 try compatibility mode for xp sp3. Enjoy!
,Cerebral222,2012-04-14T03:13Z,"Thanks krisdj, works well on Windows 7 32bit, no need for compat mode, +1 rep, Cheers."
,Bammg1991,2012-06-04T09:15Z,"Neither of the cracks work for me. The one for Rouge Spear is 32bit while I have 64. The one for Urban Ops just crashes.

I've messed with compatibility settings and even reinstalled twice. Any suggestions?"
,Bammg1991,2012-06-04T09:22Z,"""URBANOPERATIONS.EXE : not found or already opened !""

I get that when the Urban Ops Crack doesn't crash. URBANOPERATIONS.EXE is in the same folder and still doesn't recognize. I'm installed the update but I can't play either one because of these cracks. >_"
,krisrdj,2012-06-10T10:24Z,try running installation in compatibility mode and all cracks and updates also
,krisrdj,2012-06-10T10:33Z,"OK, I just installed it. Install rogue spear and don't crack it
Install UO and run update 2.52 with compatibility for xp
Run UrbanOperations.exe if it hangs while entering options then try compatibility xp sp2. Don't crack anything. "
