,danielwe,2012-04-19T21:09Z,I went back to this torrent to check for complaints but none. 99% of eztv releases have worked awesome for me but in this episode the sound gets kinda screwed in the middle no one else? If not perhaps its just vlc fucking up.
,kingpinkyle,2012-04-20T10:00Z,terrible copy. about half way through there is a 30 second gap between audio and video then the gap just widdens till the end. Find another torrent.
,Tinny_pb,2012-04-22T06:04Z,"Plays perfectly for me, both in VLC and on WDTV Live. No audio sync problem. A10 V9.

ViolentC's comment was correct, there is a split-second glitch at about 19 minutes, but it won't affect your understanding of the scene or your enjoyment of the episode.

Thanks EZTV."
