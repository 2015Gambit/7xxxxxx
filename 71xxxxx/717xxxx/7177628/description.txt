Your world will become what you think of it. "Having worked with a vast number of successful entrepreneurial individuals, I have found that one common trait they share is the ability to build a fantastic relationship between the conscious and the subconscious mind...being able to direct and trust its judgement when required...working together, communicating in a positive state, knowing the boundaries of the otherΓÇÖs capacity, and not wasting time over the ΓÇ£whyΓÇ¥ question.... What would happen now, if you started to change your thinking only to the positive...? Would you be more or less successful...? Do you know someone who is negative...if you changed your thinking right now, how long would it be before that person adopted a similar way of thinking, or even better, adopted a positive thinking strategy similar to yours?" Benjamin Bonetti's self-help tools have changed the lives of thousands of people around the world, offering simple solutions for lasting change. Over the years, the Benjamin Bonetti range has been described by its users as 'Dynamic, Positive, Intelligent, Functional, Fun, Energetic and Interactive.'
