Audio: Russian AC3
Subtitle: English soft

Presented in raw approach, Chekist, unveils the sheer madness of a depraved, paranoid tyranny set in post revolutionary Russia. The Cheka mercilessly imposes a purge of its enslaved society; a rule of law that fosters unlimited suspicion and provides no justice.

Warning: Graphic violence.

Chekist, is perhaps the most disturbing film I have ever seen. Off hand I can't think of any other movie that comes close. It is physically and mentally exhausting for me to watch.

I made this encode for myself a while ago as a reference and didn't think I would upload it. But lately, seeing recent circumstances unfold in our world - I have relented. Heed the caution of this presentation everyone and please discuss the importance of liberty with family, friends and even strangers if the occasion presents itself.

Feel free to upload to other trackers as necessary.

Best regards and best of luck, TTT
