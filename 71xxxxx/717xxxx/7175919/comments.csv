,monkey53,2012-04-15T22:40Z,"i play this game for a little time, then it says: 'are you sure you wnat to exit?
all game data will be saved.'
i press on no and it exits and when i go back to the game all data is erased, help.
it also happened to me on the scrubs game and enchanted kingdom that it exits the game and goes to android market"
,Ioniculk,2012-04-16T09:12Z,Same thing happens to me. The game data also is lost when I play another game in between the times I play this one or just restart the phone for that matter.
