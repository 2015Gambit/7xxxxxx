""No serial included - will not work without it. Not my issue though.""
What sense does have this upload.....if one get get it as demo on the dev.site!
The advantage of sites like piratebay is, that one can get applications with registration-possibilities. Apperantly that ""is not your issue""....."
,bigger_mac,2012-04-12T19:16Z,"Feel free to upload the sn# if you have it. Also, a lot of ppl feel it's easier to just dl the stuff in one package. Enjoy. Don't hate."
,Noirdua,2012-04-13T09:50Z,I created an account just to say that bigger_mac is a faggot
,bigger_mac,2012-04-13T19:15Z,"Well, I am so you are right on track. No shame"
,thekind,2012-04-15T18:25Z,"open a text editor, replace all #'s with 3, @ with 99.
(There's a reason to post them like this)

,McPiriX,2012-04-19T20:32Z,What about Mac Serials?
,mrjoz,2012-04-21T13:38Z,it would be real nice if i could get a code. i have  a keygen for 11 but its no good

Please pretty please.

ATTRIB -H %localappdata%L8457789120
del %localappdata%L8457789120

This is the commands needed in Windows 7 in order to reset the 30 day trial version of FMPro 12 downloadable from Filemaker-website
For Mac OS users it might be:
user => Library => Application Support: L8457789120 (the file name)

For version 11: replace nnn12n with nnn11n"
,Gold_90,2012-05-10T15:05Z,"Update: place a ""forvard slash"" between the % and the L in both lines"
,hureya,2012-05-11T13:03Z,"Gold, can you make a tutorial for this tip?"
,Gold_90,2012-05-12T07:38Z,"Tutorial?  Google is your best friend...

ATTRIB -H = DOS command, unhides the hidden date stamp file 

%localappdata% = in the users Local folder within the Appdata folder

L8457789120 = the name of the datestamp file

del = DOS-command to delete

%localappdata% = path to file to delete ( see above)

L8457789120 = name of file to delete

Run the two lines one by one in a cmd window, or make a .bat-file and run them there.

Most people might be better off spending the dough and get the support from Filemaker Inc, but for some this will make it possible to open a file created in the trial period after the 30 days have passed."
,dontbeefkeith,2012-05-24T18:23Z,"Is it possible to also reset the Server trial by deleting the ""L8457789120"" file from application support?"
,Gold_90,2012-06-04T16:14Z,"Don't know about the server.. Sorry.

To reset the trial you may also have to delete the file User.upr (User preferences) in the folder %APPDATA%-FileMaker-FileMaker Pro-12.0"
,nonobvious,2012-06-12T21:28Z,don't download. this torrent is a piece of shit waste of time.
,wkingdom,2012-07-03T20:21Z,"dear all
i am having a hard time working out where the L8457789120 is stored on a windows xp machine.
could you give me any hints. also, an example of the commands needed. or how to get %localappdata% to work on xp.
btw: this trial reset process works like a charm on my mac book.

thanks"
,Antarte,2012-08-25T22:34Z,"Any keygen, serial or link? I searched but nothing, or bad serials. The ones in this page neither work too."
,AntMan89,2012-09-12T10:49Z,"Thanks bigger_mac, lol.
