,spartacus__1985,2012-04-14T00:23Z,"Hello, Is this English dubbed? Thank you!"
,NoLdea,2012-04-14T01:37Z,All are English subbed.
,OPLover,2012-04-14T02:22Z,Good quality and nice compression! TY!
,DrayDot,2012-04-20T02:48Z,"WOW..this is crazy! I was just thinking about finally getting into the series again and getting caught up since this is my favorite anime and i came across this trying to look for the actual dvd's to download for the quality. You saved me alot of time+money that i couldn't afford. Just having the episodes was enough but you also have everything seperated by each arc and you even have the movies/specials in the right spots too. The quality and sound couldn't get any better either damn. Amazing, thanks alot bro! Seeding a couple days. Get this if you really wanna enjoy One Piece to the fullest."

,NoLdea,2012-05-01T18:44Z,"Thanks for letting me know about that. Guess I missed an episode. I've created a torrent for that episode alone. Here is the link:

,yousef86,2012-07-05T18:34Z,"Excellent Quality Collection! A/10 V/10! English Subtitles/10!

You've outdone yourself! You edited out most of the OP ED credits flawlessly. All episodes are Japanese Audio with English Subtitles.

,NoLdea,2012-07-06T04:20Z,Didn't realize episode 83 had no sound. Hopefully that is the only other issue >_

,thekidhasstyle,2012-07-29T17:52Z,"Hey NoLdea, i'm currently watching the yibis fansubs (AFTER ep. 540 when your torrent ends) and i download the videos from yibis but i was wondering what your method of converting the videos is before you torrent them to make them watchable (your videos work fine but the episodes from yibis give lags/graphic glitches). I tried to reformat but it didn't seem to change for me. Can you explain what you do step by step and with what program so i can continue to keep up to date with the episodes without having to change my videoplayer? (i watch all my videos with jetaudio). Thanks for your hardwork."
,NoLdea,2012-07-31T06:02Z,Msg me on the forums and I'll try to help you out.
,TandySage,2012-08-05T22:28Z,will there bee part 5?
,NoLdea,2012-08-08T02:55Z,When there are enough episodes to put into a 5th part. Around episode 600 probably.
