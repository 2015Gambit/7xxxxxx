,Fougene,2012-04-27T02:48Z,"- does not work with my version of the Sims 3. Probably not fault of uploader.
- includes malware that does not appear to be part of the program (reg.exe in AppData?)
Fishy."

,youngdaddytc,2012-06-25T01:37Z,"seems that every time sims 3 is updated, a new CAW tool is released to match that update.  in other words, you have to find a Create A World tool that matches your version of the game.  

on the sims website, they only host the newest version of the CAW tool.  so if you're looking for one that will work, make sure it matches the version of the sims game you are using.  "
,foxwilliam3,2012-08-28T23:27Z,Anyone know what version this is for?
,Thanatos614,2012-08-31T18:40Z,"Got a trojan from this, and no it doesn't work with Showtime... It's the old 2009 beta version that hasn't worked with current versions of the game in years."
