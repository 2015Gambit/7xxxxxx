BBC MOTD 2 - 08/04/2012

Duration: 1 Hour
Colin Murray is joined by Lee Dixon and Robbie Savage for highlights of the day's Premier League fixtures between Manchester United and QPR, and Arsenal and Manchester City.

Both Manchester clubs are fighting for the title with differing motivations - Sir Alex Ferguson's team want to extend their record by winning a 20th league championship, while Roberto Mancini's side are aiming to win a first top flight title in 44 years. United beat QPR 2-0 at Loftus Road when they last met on 18 December, the same day City beat Arsene Wenger's team by a solitary goal in that reverse fixture.

As usual, there will also be a review of all the goals and action from Saturday's seven games.
