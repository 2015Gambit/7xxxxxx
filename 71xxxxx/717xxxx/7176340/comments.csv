,gwapsako,2012-04-11T13:51Z,"@eidref
i tried both of yify's versions...720p is gd enough for my 32' led tv. i wasnt disappointed. plus its faster to download (obviously.hehe). But ofcors the 1080p is better if you want a better resolution.
just thought of sharing man :)"

,Ryan0306,2012-08-02T03:04Z,@eidref: You can only see the difference between 1080p and 720p on at least a 55 in tv. Thats why most smaller tv's only come in 720p.
,An_Armenian,2012-09-14T22:55Z,"Appreciate it YIFY.

Keep up the great uploads."
