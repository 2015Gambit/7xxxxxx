"The Lion Sleeps Tonight"

A lion breaks loose in Seattle, leaving a 
couple's lives and relationship at risk; 
Lexie overhears Mark's discussion about 
moving in with Julia; Teddy begins to take 
steps towards coming to terms with Henry's 
death; Callie grills Arizona on her past 
lovers; and Alex requests to be taken off 
Morgan's preemie case when she becomes too 
dependent on him. Meanwhile, Meredith tries 
to be a support for Cristina as the tension 
between her and Owen hits a boiling point.

Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
