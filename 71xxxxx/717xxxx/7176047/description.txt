Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show, host Mike Adams talks Dale Carson, a trial lawyer, former FBI agent, police officer, detective, SWAT team member, undercover operative and private investigator who now defends clients against unfair charges. He is the author of Arrest-Proof Yourself, which is required reading for anyone wanting to avoid unnecessary interactions with the law. 

Other guests include James Stewart, owner of Rawsome Foods, who was arrested for the crime of selling unpasteurized goat milk, goat cheese, yogurt and kefir, and Mark Baker, a Michigan farmer who is locked in a battle with Michigan's Department of Natural Resources (DNR) over "Invasive Species Order." 
journalist and editor Patrick Henningsen files a report about the Trayvon Martin case and the manufactured race war coming out of the White House and sensationalized by the establishment media.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
