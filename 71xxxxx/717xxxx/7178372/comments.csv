You got any new Eminem man. He postponed his movie, Southpaw, to work on a new album which I am sure has been in the works for awhile. Maybe it will be released this summer (if there's no delays). On a realy note man I need some new Eminem man. lol Love the Way You Lie is starting to get old.

Thanks,
