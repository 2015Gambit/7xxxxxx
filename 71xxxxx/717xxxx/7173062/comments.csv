,tmaxx666,2012-04-10T18:16Z,"Since Apple Lossless IS true lossless and there is not alternative category for these files, they go here.

As for your other comment you may want to take a look at the number of Apple audio devices in the world compared to your PC based device.  Then move out of your mother's home, finds a woman and get a life."

Long live the free software .....!!!

[T],rjordan21,2012-04-11T13:41Z,"^^^ There is a tile at the  top of this web page labeled ""Pirate Search"". If you take the time to use it you can discover so many other things.... like Peter Gabriel's Discography in .FLAC here:

So far there seems to be about 100 people enjoying tmaxx666's upload here and something tells me there'll be more Apple users taking advantage of this torrent too.  I'm not one of them though...

This is a forum to exchange free music.... not whine about computer technology being free or not.

Go visit another site if that's what you want to do....

Thanks tmaxx666 for the upload!"
