Damn good stuff. 

I got to see Gabriel live in the early 80's while he was touring for his 4 (Security) album. I learned one thing. You shouldn't do 'shrooms and go to a Peter Gabriel concert where everyone has monkey makeup on. LOL.

One side note ΓÇª the album "So" is the remastered version, so the song "In Your Eyes" is the last track. Peter approved of this and likes this order better than the original CD.

Presented in Apple Lossless. All tracks were ripped from CD or converted from FLAC using XLD for those of us who use iTunes on Apple products.

Enjoy!
