,Ukie,2012-04-10T22:28Z,I'm seeding... so are 2 other people. But apparently over 30 people downloaded this.
,Yamcha67,2012-04-11T00:15Z,Is this Mac Native? or a Wine Port?
,Ukie,2012-04-11T01:14Z,"A Wineskin port. But, there is no lag whatsoever. The size is 1.83 GiB, and so far I've uploaded 2.7 GiB so as far as the upload being completed is concerned, I've done my job.  I don't know about the seeding though."
,sportorumai,2012-04-12T11:32Z,Any updates for this? no option for widescreen. (And there is on an older torrent)
,Ukie,2012-04-13T01:55Z,"You'd have to download a Windows update for the game, and apply it to the wrapper. As far as I know I've no clue about screen settings, except high-quality graphics."

,Liimiitless,2012-04-23T06:09Z,"it downloaded perfectly, I unzipped it, opened the application, and everything runs okay except its really pixelated and i can't see a thing. anyone else have this problem or know what to do? Im currently running on Lion. Thanks!"
,Ukie,2012-04-24T01:23Z,"limitless, you need to go to the ""options"" choice in the menu (not during gameplay) and then set the graphics."
,Liimiitless,2012-04-27T01:54Z,I set it to low and nothing changed..
,Ukie,2012-04-30T23:38Z,"No, actually you need to set it to high."

,Readwand,2012-08-05T06:07Z,"I am using Mountain Lion, and I confirm that it works on OS X 10.8"
,smashbro11,2012-08-06T20:11Z,"When I try to use the editor to edit campaign maps, I get returned to the main menu. Why can't you edit campaign maps? Is there a fix for this?"
,Ukie,2012-08-08T23:52Z,Not what I know about. I've no idea about editing campaign maps or multiplayer either.
,Readwand,2012-08-14T20:40Z,"Hey guys. Apparently, I spoke too soon as I was wrong. I managed to launch the game only one time, but after that, I got the 'Initialization Failed' error. I have tried to reinstall, and used a different setup, however, the error keeps coming back. Interestingly, I can still run aom.exe, but not the expansion, aomx.exe. I am using a Late 2009 White MacBook running on Mountain Lion. Can anyone help me with this? I have been looking for a fix for some time now with no luck. Thanks."
,Readwand,2012-08-14T20:44Z,"Hey guys. I spoke too soon as I was wrong. I am running Mountain Lion on my late 2009 white macbook, and the game only successfully launched on one occasion. After the first time, I got the 'Initialization failed' error. However, it only happens when I try to run aomx.exe. If i run aom.exe, the game runs just fine. Can any of you help me with this? thanks"
,rengap,2012-08-23T03:19Z,I am really stupid and I have no idea what to do here. I click on the application I'm on 10.8 btw and itll just the toolbar will say AOM but it just goes away and closes. I know I am doing wrong and its probably simple. Anyhelp would be great thanks!
,Readwand,2012-08-23T06:14Z,"rengap, you can do this.

open finder, look for the Age of Mythology Gold.app. Right click the icon, and choose 'Show Package Contents'. Double click the 'Wineskin' app and choose advanced. In the windows EXE bar, make sure you changed it to '/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Age of Mythology Gold Edition/aom.exe'. This will run the aom.exe instead of aomx.exe. What this means is that you will now run the original Age of Mythology game, not the Titans Expansion Pack. I still dont have a clue how to run the Titans though. Hope this helps."
,rengap,2012-08-24T02:53Z,Hey so i did exactly what you did and the same thing keeps happening. The toolbar will say age of mythology but the screen wont come up itll just stay there on the toolbar and then the app omn the dock will dissapear 
,Readwand,2012-08-24T11:32Z,"are you sure it's running aom.exe and not aomx.exe? if possible, give me more details of your problem. i want to help, but without details, I'm afraid i can't."
,Escoces,2012-09-04T20:40Z,Thanks Readwand. That worked well here! :D
