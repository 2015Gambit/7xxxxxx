,nathan_se,2012-06-07T03:23Z,Finnished my dl and it works like a charm. Thanks a lot! 
,paragonus,2012-06-13T05:42Z,"Awesome glad to see that my torrent is working for people. A few words of advice...

sometimes during game-play Sheppard will look at the floor and you won't be able to look back up...no problem just quick-save (do this often because in some areas you can't save at all) and exit the game and restart, you should be good. 

Also the game will sometimes quit by itself stating there is a deficiency in wine but no problem just exit and restart the game and continue playing.

Save and especially quick-save this game as often as you can. Enjoy!! 

and don't forget to donate. Go to Paypal home page...go to send money under the home tab...type your info and click friend and family button enter my email paragonus.email@gmail.com and go from there."
