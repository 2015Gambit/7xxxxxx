This is my first upload. The file says about 9 Gigs but it's more about 12 Gigs

I couldn't find a recent ME 1 wineskin that was compatible with OSX Lion...so I made one!!

Computer Specs:

Mac OSX Lion 10.7.3
2.3 GHz Intel Core i5
8GB 1333 MHz DDR3
Intel HD Graphics 3000 512 MB

Note: 

Should work ideal with Nvidia graphics cards; should work with AMD/ATI graphics cards, but I have heard problems with the Snow Leopard 10.6.8 version of Mass Effect 1 and AMD/ATI cards. If there are problems with my Lion version, especially with any graphics cards, post it in comments. I won't be able to troubleshoot though as it is a compatibility issue between the graphics card itself and ME 1. If there are no problems still post and praise this torrent, so at least I'll know if mine is better :)

Also:

This Mass Effect 1 contains both DLC packages
   #1 Bringing Down the Sky
   #2 Pinnacle Station

Look forward to more uploads in future friends!!

Lastly:

I do accept suggestions for porting games you can't get ahold of, or that won't work on your version of OS, or just plain love and don't have the time to look.

Thanks
