,SoWErA3,2012-04-11T20:40Z,ffs I thought the same thing when I first read your comment but this is almost as bad if not worse :( I really like Carrie and without Austin there is no them :( Jack have been entertaining in the past as well but Madison I am not quite up to date with Days yet to speak about that chr :(
[T],jmanwf,2012-04-11T23:36Z,The main reason why they fired them is because they now have 2 new head writers as well
