* = This song was in memory of Tech Links, a Code Lyoko community built in 2005 by Lyoko Computer, nhjm449, Lotho and Wartonchan. The forum became inactive about 3 months ago due to the end of Code Lyoko and the staff decided to close shop. The song's origins was a short demo in Lyoko Computer's forum signature, which he has had for as long as I can remember. Whenever this song is played, I think of him and TL. This is reason to why I decided to put the full version for you all to listen to.
