Thanks for sharing. I'd like to alert you that you've been bookmarked. BTW, I've a request or two:
No Country For Old Man
We Need To Talk About Kevin [WITH English subs, there are no decent subs available on any site for this one.]

Sorry if the requests cause inconvenience. Won't do so again in that case. Just let me know, if possible. Keep the fun flowing."
