,sahilrox,2012-04-11T06:14Z,Nope....720p is very large. Will wait for small size.
,hansborst,2012-04-11T06:44Z,Very very very slow !!
,Shellshock,2012-04-11T17:53Z,"All his torrents are slow as hell, and have bad quality for the big size"
,BarnabasC,2012-04-11T23:46Z,"Hey SCSA420 There is nothing wrong with the quality that I can see on my 55 inch Samsung 3D LED 1080p HDTV, in fact it looks awesome!!! I think the guy above is just a hater and probably is a nothing more then a leecher who never contributes anything on TPB so do the world a favor shellshock and STFU you jabroni."
,ShepardRahl,2012-04-12T19:39Z,"I love how whenever somebody says there is nothing wrong with a torrent they feel the need to give intimate detail on the device they tested it on like...""55 inch Samsung 3D LED 1080p HDTV"". No serial Number? It's like a big dick contest with everybody trying to outdo everybody else. There is, no doubt, some exaggeration going on. Not by everybody who does it, but most likely by a large portion. I guess they feel the urge to make themselves feel big or something.

Anyway, there is nothing wrong with the quality. Anybody who says otherwise is doing it wrong."
,undermaker,2012-04-15T11:53Z,"sorry, you are not 1st...scene4all is first...."
,SCSA420,2012-04-17T02:19Z,"Guess what undermaker  I was 1st as I Uploaded:2012-04-11 05:34:57 GMT and scene4all Uploaded:2012-04-11 06:22:42 GMT 

oh and mine was 1280 x 720p HD @ 59.940 FPS and scene4all was not HD as it was 704 x 400 @ 29.970 FPS which isn't technically HD, so next time before you talk shit get your facts straight jabroni 

Oh and more then likely I will be first with Monday Night Raw later tonight in 720p HD :D"
