,coachtsr,2012-04-11T23:54Z,2 comments - lazy moochers Rate the video/audio...
,TheMaritimes,2012-04-12T01:37Z,"Dude, if it is a BR Rip then the audio and video should be 10/10. The only thing to rate is the movie itself. And the best reviews are found elsewhere."

,SJDK06,2012-04-13T03:52Z,"Okay so when I DL stuff from here to my Bitcomet, when I try to move the files to a specific folder so that I can view them via Windows Media center on my Xbox 360, it wont let me move the file without first deleting it from my Bitcomet.  I want to be able to seed these but do not know how to fix this problem."
,SJDK06,2012-04-13T03:55Z,When I try to move the files I DL to a specific folder it wont let me until I delete it our of my Bitcomet so I cannot seed them.  What am I doing wrong and how can I fix this so that I can seed.
,kathiemc51,2012-04-13T11:09Z,I have bitcomet too.  Just change the download location to the folder that you want to play them from.  Go to tools - default directory. 
,Sknmissle,2012-04-13T20:49Z,"when i download i put on a memory stick and plug it into my tv. cinivia is not known to me because sony is a piece of shit i will have nothing to do with. just get a program called format factory which is free and the format the file for your piece o' shit 3, no ill regard towards you, just fuck sony... :) "
