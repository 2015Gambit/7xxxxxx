My Gorilla Family

Nature Documentary hosted by Colin Salmon, published by National Geographic in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

They're one of our closest relatives but, without the work of scientists like Angelique Todd, we would know very little about Western Lowland Gorillas such a Makumba, a majestic silverback. Angelique's persistence has been worth it and has seen her earn Makumba's trust, allowing her to get close to this 200kg great ape, his harem of three females and his eight offspring. But there could be trouble brewing for these mighty primates - at the age of 32, mighty Makumba is growing old. Can this weary warrior see off challengers to his reign, and keep the rivalries within his harem in check?
