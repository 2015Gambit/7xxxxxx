Well, it's Windows 7 Ultimate amd64. Just install but remember NOT to insert ANY serial when asked by the setup AND leave the "Automatically activate Windows when I'm online" UNCHECKED. It's gonna show as activated when you start windows up after that setup is finished, and it's gonna stay that way. Updates have gone fine for all the PCs I've tried the DVD on so far, so fire away...

Well, that's that.
