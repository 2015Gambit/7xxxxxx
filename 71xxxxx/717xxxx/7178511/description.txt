In this Clip i present * Bitorrent 7.6.1 *  I also show the tool i have to record 

this clip.  * My Screenshot Recorder Pro 2.3 *.

I am also showing how to upload a torrent file to *TPB* the Pirate Bay *

This time i create a torrent of * My Screenshot Recorder Pro 2.3 * and upload.

You can also see where to add a pic on your uploaded torrent.



And while i'm doing this , you can also see my web browser *Sea monkey *

That i'm using.


These 3 programs are avalible for download at *TPB* * The-White-Eagle *

....

 
The original size of this clip was 2.6 GB *From *My Screenshot Rec Pro 2.3)

If you decrease the frame and quality here you will end up with robotic scen.

So i used full power quality and frame and sound,



and After that i used cucosoft video converter 

and splitted up this file into 350 Mb file size..


And from here i used Windows movie maker to convert it to 1 singel small file.


From 2.6 Gb to 35.8 Mb.

So check the picture and listen to the sound...


*******

A tip , use either WMP or Gom player or Vlc to this clip ,, and increase the size 

a little bit , try to fit it in screen full size...


And enjoy My First ever made video presentation.
