[T],FatFreddy473,2012-04-11T22:08Z,could a mod please tell me why i dont have a pink skull yet? i've uploaded 262 torrents...
,Kemoesobie,2012-04-11T23:26Z,I made an account just to thank you for this torrent. 
,HoodieAll,2012-04-12T00:39Z,Take this down. :(
,Rkid94,2012-04-13T00:25Z,"Come on, guys! just put this torrent down and buy the album... "
,predux,2012-04-13T06:00Z,"Take this down you assholes. The album is fucking 5 dollars. If you don't have 5 dollars to spend on a quality album like this, how do you afford internet? Hoodie worked so hard on this and he's barely making any profit. You're all disrespectful assholes. I can see pirating other shit, but this is one of the only artists who have stayed true throughout the years. Don't be a dick. Pay for the album."

,spekwitit,2012-04-17T02:59Z,I would agree to take this down but I really need that 320 bit rate so thank you immensely
,jadenskye,2012-04-19T10:28Z,"Some younger people like me (17) are broke and have parents who believe that buying an album is a ""waste of money"", even if it's $5. Otherwise, trust me, I would gladly buy this album and many others."
,f0000,2012-04-20T08:54Z,"Chill man. Some people would rather download a torrent than convert their iTunes purchases, like me."
,madamai123,2012-04-24T19:59Z,"i made this account just to say that, i was gonna download it until i saw hoodie's comment, so im gonna download it off iTunes instead :)"
[T],FatFreddy473,2012-04-29T23:09Z,good boy :)
,lucasa17,2012-06-17T22:20Z,I agree with jadenskye on his/her comment!!!!
,green_knight11,2012-07-25T03:08Z,"i started to download and then read hoodie's comment and felt guilty so i hadda buy it, but thanks for the upload nonetheless"
