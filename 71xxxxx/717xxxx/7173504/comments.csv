[V],gnv65,2012-04-10T08:28Z,"It is extremely informative and at the same time EXPLOSIVE to say the least. The author, Mr. M. O. Mathai, as Nehru's Special Assistant, was in an exceptional position to first hand see the goings on in the national and international arena. He also admits to a 12 year-long affairs with Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, and the fact that Mr. Nehru was aware of that liaison. Although a kiss-and-tell chapter titled ""She"" in the book was dropped from publication at the last minute, there is an unverified text floating on the Internet, with credit to Maneka Gandhi, Mrs. Gandhi's younger daughter-in-law. However, there is little of no proof that Mr. Mathai penned those words. For the rest, the author had very little reason, if at all, to publish a scandalous book risking legal ramifications.

The book contains many interesting facts and historic anecdotes. If the mind boggling information contained therein is true, it is unconscionable that the public has been denied access to the facts. Suppression of information only makes the public even more determined. In this electronic age, it is much easier to obtain information and disseminate it to the masses with a simple click. The action of Govt. of India to take such extreme measures-- to prevent circulation of this book-- only supports the author's claims. The reader sees how some able and competent ideologists did not survive the politics to claim their rightful place in running the country. It is an equal shame that early in the emergence of the Republic of India, the corrupt and egotist politicians, who were ill-prepared as administrators, took impulsive, self-serving, near-sighted and ill-advised decisions (or without proper counsel, which often were more for vindictive reasons against their political rivals rather than for the good of the country) that in the process they only caused irreparable damage to India's national security, as well as financial and political viability, not to mention tarnishing her international standing. It took nearly six decades for India to do damage control and to claim her rightful place on the world stage.

This book gives a snap shot of major happenings in the history of India from 1946 through 1959. Mr. Mathai's account of major events is very informative. His candid verbal sketches of a number of key players: Lord Mountabtten, Sardar Patel, Govind Vallabh Pant, Maulana Azad, Sarojini Naidu, Rajendra Parsad, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Morarji Desai, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and others are invaluable. The reader is invaluably benefited by an understanding of the events and actors of a crucial time in Indian history and the country's emergence as a republic. His insights, impressions and reminiscences of the noted key figures of the times are interesting for a generation like mine that grew only hearing those names. Even when he jumps between various characters one does not lose the thread. Whenever pertinent, he links an ongoing discussion with an earlier chapter to sort of jog the reader's memory.

Mr. Mathai's writing is crisp. His style of narration is a combination of being matter-of-factly and funny at the same time. He minces no words. In his recollections, he is both poignant and witty. Mr. Mathai's affection and admiration for Mr. Nehru, and his loyalty comes through and through. Mr. Mathai comes across sincere and perhaps that is another factor that lends credibility to his book."
