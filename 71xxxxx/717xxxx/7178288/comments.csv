,detroitrob,2012-04-11T23:43Z,"Once I try and use the crack I am getting a system error saying "" The program can't start because LIBMYSQL.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem. When I do that it gives me the same thing. Can you please help? "
,willyjinkens,2012-04-11T23:50Z,The only extra files you might need are the VB6 runtime files. They can be found at this URL - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/192461
,detroitrob,2012-04-12T00:24Z,"dang, still getting it. man i want to play this game."
,detroitrob,2012-04-12T00:25Z,thanks for the help though. any other ideas possibly?
,detroitrob,2012-04-12T00:28Z,still cant get it to work for some reason
,willyjinkens,2012-04-12T01:24Z,@detroitrob - If you can't get this patch to work there is a pre-cracked exe you can download. It's bigger but the crack is already applied. Just know that you will have to download a new patched exe for every future update. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7177995
,padoodle,2012-04-12T02:52Z,"I keep getting the error ""Component 'comlg32.ocx' or one of it's dependencies is missing or invalid."
,detroitrob,2012-04-12T02:55Z,gonna try that..if it doesnt work ill try it on my other computer.
,willyjinkens,2012-04-12T03:01Z,@padoodle Check my response to another question above. Grab the VB6 runtime files from the Microsoft site. The file you are missing is included in there. 
,padoodle,2012-04-12T03:08Z,"I downloaded them and am getting the same error.  Where do you ""put"" the patch? Sorry if it's a stupid question..."
,willyjinkens,2012-04-12T03:44Z,"Okay, if you downloaded the VB6 runtime files then you have to run that exe to install them. It might require a reboot after, I'm honestly not sure. But as far as the patch goes, you don't have to put it anywhere specific. You just run the exe that you downloaded from this torrent. There is a single button and some instructions. Just click the button and browse to ootp13.exe (c:program filesout of the park developmentootp13"" or wherever you installed it to. That is it. It will patch ootp13.exe and you will be able to register the game with any serial. It's that simple. If you can't get the patch workign then feel free to download the the already patched exe. The link is in one of my previous comments in here."
,detroitrob,2012-04-12T04:08Z,When I get to the OOTP13 screen where u enter in the serial #..what do i enter in there or is this patch supposed to bypass that?
,willyjinkens,2012-04-12T04:19Z,"If you ran the patch correctly and it told you that the patch was successful then, in the OOTP13 screen, click the button to enter a serial and enter any serial you want. Just type a few numbers or something in there. Anything should work."
,detroitrob,2012-04-12T04:20Z,thank you! that worked
,willyjinkens,2012-04-12T04:35Z,"You're welcome. When they release a new patch for the game, just update the game normally and patch it again. It should keep working for future OOTP13 updates."

,WillyTrombone,2012-04-23T06:10Z,Any chance of getting a patch for Inside the park baseball from them?
,EJK22,2012-04-29T02:00Z,"Yo, guys.

DO NOT update the game with the latest 13.3 (4/27) patch! Seems the designer screwed everything up.

Also no need for [SoN] to work his magic."
,willyjinkens,2012-04-29T13:03Z,Global patch works fine for the new update. (screwed up or not!)
,petepauletto,2012-04-30T01:19Z,The patch worked great.  Just download and install the newest patch then run this crack.  Thanks!!!!!!!!!
,aspr32,2012-05-01T08:46Z,"I downloaded 13.6 file&crack, I installed a file first, then i replace my file with cracked file. And put 1,a,asdasd as a license key, it didn't worked. So i updated my client, downloaded this patch and apply the patch. I mean apply patch to 13.3.9. But failed again. I don't know why. Am i missing something?"
,detroitrob,2012-05-02T00:55Z,I am running windows 7 and I am unable to locate where this COMDLG32.ocx is suppose to go.  The patch tells me that that file needs to be replaced.  I have downloaded that file but no clue as to where to put in in the system32 folder.  every registry folder I have is DLL
,incrediblydope,2012-05-02T18:37Z,any chance of a version for mac? thanks.
,AXXOFAN2008,2012-05-03T00:45Z,This global patch is not working. Sucks to because I had a season going into the year 2021 already. I feel like all is lost. 
,AXXOFAN2008,2012-05-03T00:48Z,I am running Windows 7 and getting the comdlg32.ocx or one of it's dependencies is not correctly registered error. 
,willyjinkens,2012-05-04T14:09Z,AXXOFAN2008: I just double checked and the global patch is working perfectly fine. If you look at the previous comments you'll see the answer to your question. Just install the vb6 runtime files and there will be no more comdlg32 error.
,aspr32,2012-05-04T15:48Z,"Sorry for bothering you, but i need solution. your ootp12 crack work perfectly, but 13 keep saying activation error."
,padoodle,2012-05-07T23:33Z,"What does the updater mean by select the unpatched version.  I understand that, but what If i dont have an unpatched version and if I run the setup file of ootp13 wouldnt that overide my patched ootp13? Help please!!!"
,padoodle,2012-05-07T23:53Z,"Ok, so I downloaded a new 13.2.6 ootp13.exe and put it on my desktop.  I ran the patch and it said it worked, however, it didn't do anything! Any help?  What would happen if I applied it on the cracked ootp13.exe?"
,padoodle,2012-05-08T03:31Z,Can [SoN] make a crack for Inside the Park Baseball made by the same people who made this game?
,inuyashabr1986,2012-06-26T02:08Z,Son can you make a crack for Pro Cycling Manager 2012?
