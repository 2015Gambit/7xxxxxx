SEASON 8 EPISODE 9 - Lizzie

Lizzie, 30, is a self-described "algae scientist." She's been hiding under the cover of academia and to date has logged four years in undergraduate studies and six years in doctorate studies. The result is a vibrant, brainy specimen of a woman clad in a heap of T-shirts, frumpy sweaters and hiking shoes. But she's barely a student anymore ΓÇö she's the one teaching the kids. She admits that she sometimes wishes that a "beam from outer space would come down and dress me." Enter the twin beams of supreme sartorial therapy, Stacy and Clinton. Can they help Lizzie to understand that there's nothing wrong with having a beautiful mind and a beautiful image?
