Description and table of contents:  http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000138.html

NOTA: The files can be downloaded seperately. If you are using a magnet (see "Magnet URI scheme" in Wikipedia), the following procedure will allow you to select one file from the two: 1) Download the magnet from the indexer (The Pirate Bay, Demonoid...) and load it in your torrent client and 2) immediately PAUSE its download. After a few seconds (sometimes up to several tens of seconds) your client will have acquired the .torrent file from the swarm, that is, all the info pertaining to the torrent, namely the name and size of each included file. 3) To pick and choose one file in the torrent using ┬╡torrent and BitTorrent clients for example, go to the lower pane, left-click on the Files tab to see the two files included in the torrent. Then right-click on the file you do NOT wish to share (download) and tag it Don't Download (Skip in torrent parlance). 4) Return to the upper pane and restart the torrent (resume downloading). If you want a few files among, say, the 27 included in a torrent, the procedure is the same and you can use the usual Win/Mac aggregate command for group skipping.


Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
