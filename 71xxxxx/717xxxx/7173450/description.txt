This is a comedy/adventure anime. It never feels too serious but it is entertaining to watch. The subs are not done by me and I think 24 of the 25 files are from SUBDESU, while episode 9 is from a group called WHYNOT. 

All episodes have been named and catagorized for easy sorting and the second season is underway. Please enjoy this upload. Favorite me to look at all of my other uploads.
