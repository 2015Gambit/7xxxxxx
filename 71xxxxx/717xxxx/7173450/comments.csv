,sylant,2012-04-17T06:44Z,"@heretic19 - The seeding is a problem based on the fact that i no longer have internet at my home and I use the internet at work to seed. This isn't the best scenario, but it gets the job done at the very least. I have tried to seed as best I can and will continue to seed this show until I get at least 10 other seeds. I work weird hours 11pm to 7am. Sorry for the inconvenience."
