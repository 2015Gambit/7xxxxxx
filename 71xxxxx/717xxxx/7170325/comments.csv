,brianxxx,2012-04-09T18:03Z,"HOLY F**K !!!!!!!! lol
THANKS!"
,willyj86,2012-04-09T19:33Z,then there are too many to upload...
[V],.BONE.,2012-04-10T01:38Z,I would not of put them in a RAR file no one is going to know what they have downloaded until its finished and not everyone has super fast internet or unlimited bandwidth should of put them all in a folder so can pick out what want to download :)
,vatel88,2012-04-10T17:25Z,"Have to agree with everyone whos posted on this torrent, no names no download. Why go through all the trouble of posting the file without listing whats in the torrent. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! if only to encourage proper file uploading."
,theodor-t,2012-04-12T20:57Z,"Stop bitchin'. Some of YOU pricks could have added the fucking full list after you downloaded it, even when the uploader hasn't done so. That man was kind enough to upload 3gb stuff for us and all he gets is ""boohoo, why is there no list?!"" Shut the fuck up and fuck off. Go buy your apps on the market, you have a full list there...stupid hoes!

Thank you for the upload cad40."
,Shcaz,2012-04-12T22:48Z,theodor-t: ppl actually wanna know what they are downloading you idiot =_=

,Typhoon2000,2012-07-10T14:58Z,"Great, another archive with plenty of stuff in it and no one knows whats inside until it's finished downloading. Not even possible to select parts of it to download, no, you have to get the whole thing. I hate stupid torrent-uploaders. GET EDUCATED!"
,dbpirate,2012-08-31T01:03Z,Thank you so much for this tor...  and to the assholes that bitched about not having a file list...  utterly pathetic you couldn't just down the file and unzip it to see what you were getting...  perhaps you should move on over to limewire or something... ungrateful bitchers
