VIEWING PORNOGRAPHY IS A SIN.

""As to the Righteous, they will be in Gardens, and in Happiness,- Enjoying the (Bliss) which Allah hath bestowed on them, and Allah shall deliver them from the Chastisement of the Fire. (To them will be said:) ""Eat and drink ye, with profit and health, because of your (good) deeds."" SURAH 54:17

IF YOU CHOOSE TO WATCH PORNOGRAPHY IT WILL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM ALLAH'S PLAN FOR YOUR SALVATION.

PLEASE, DO NOT VIEW PORNOGRAPHY. IT IS A GRIEVOUS SIN.

I am going to go SIN now...."

,Palpatin3,2012-04-15T06:32Z,Being religious is a sin. The key to be a good person is to be responsible and honest with oneself if use to much porn or meds or whatever. Honesty is a huge thing that religions failed. If you need more purpose in life I suggest googling the fastest political quiz. Be free but responsible.
,CorvinusL,2012-04-15T11:22Z,"Someone needs to tell samaro69 that blowing up people, raping underage girls, mutilating their genitals and making war on people is also a sin...and probably a lot more harmful than watching porn films made by consenting adults."

 I support u ElZurdz. Actually some of us don't want to bother about thinking what we should do and just blindly follow old traditions (in any religion) try to be fulish child and god as parent although we know who can't take care of himself/herself no one can.

I support u Palpatin3 also being good responsible social being is far better than being religious .Many people uses religion as shield against their actual sins (tricky!) and for politics. Be new age world citizen.Be responsible."
,Ghio,2012-04-16T18:36Z,Hello! Im writing to ask you: How i could totally hide porn?Even that one with a square just bellow the search bar. Hiding is not for me. For my young family members.
,Ghio,2012-04-16T18:38Z,"And yes, the preference of hide porn Y/N doesnt work. F.E if you are searching for dvdrip without ticking the video bar."

The same ""holy quran"" describing how Muhammad rapes 9 year old girls and is considered the perfect man? You should check your religious scriptures for contradictions before you start preaching it.
