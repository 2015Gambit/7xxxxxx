PS - Unwanted, unsold bin at the local dollar store once again. I know these may not be like "mainstream" movie releases however they are movies, and we are seeing the end of days of shared info so I'll try to get what i can out before theres nothing available anymore. I still remember stuff on the old P2P days that i still haven't been able to find again anywheres else just because its not "mainstream".

Sorry the IMDB isnt exactly this movie, only reference i could find of it was that particular IMDB and im guessing that movie was the first in the series while this is the 2nd in the series
