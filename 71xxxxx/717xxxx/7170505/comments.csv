,keelhaul,2012-04-09T09:44Z,@Blitss Most of us can't play this chit [sic]? Educate yourself. 
,Blubs,2012-04-09T09:57Z,"@Blitss: there are many players that will play .mkv and .mp4 files. personally i use mediaplayerclassic that comes with cccp - (combined community codec pack).... google it ;)
thx eztv for the upload :D"
,sunofdog,2012-04-09T10:15Z,Is this really episode 2 it has so many seeders and leechers but epi 2 came out a week ago?
,gru_zloto,2012-04-09T10:21Z,"@Blitss : Get VLC, and a foot in your mouth!"
,Seutekop,2012-04-09T10:42Z,"@sunofdog
this is really episode 2. This episode was already available last week, because it had been broadcast online via HBO GO in Europe, I believe. The version eztv always uploads is an HDTV-rip, so it's a rip from the actual HBO broadcast in the US.
Thanks btw, eztv!"

,boring123,2012-04-09T11:13Z,"I'm a mac user and we can play almost all .mkv files using the free Perian plugin for Quicktime. Anyway, just get VLC for the easiest way to play these files on all platforms, its free."
,GrayFlare,2012-04-09T11:49Z,"i play videos on my ps3, if i download a mkv, i convert it to mp4 using mkv2vob (freeware), usually takes about 5 minutes."
,woollybat,2012-04-09T12:06Z,D/L & instal Klite codec pack for WMP and classic....... then you can play all formats without issue
,thisisntwhatitlookslike,2012-04-09T14:38Z,"Hi. Need some help please. Have put the file on my external HDD which is linked into my Samsung Blu-Ray. The audio is fine up until the title sequence and then cuts out, any reason why and anyone know how I can fix this? Thanks in advance"

Heres What you DO Pay Attention.
Buy a Western Digital TV LIve Media Player ,It Plays Everything, OK.
Connect it to A Modern AV Reciever.Which is Hopefully Connected to a 5.1 Speaker System
Connect it to a HD 50 inch Plasma Panel or Suitable Lcd Display.
Then you will enjoy these High Quality Files as they were Meant to be Watched ,You Dickheads ,Not on Computers For Christ sakes!!!!

,BOORABBA,2012-04-09T17:28Z,As long as it's .mkv no problem we can convert it to .vob in 2 minutes plz dnt upload .3gp anymore it needs 8 hrs conversion hope this one is mkv... thnx eztv anyway

,SaentFu,2012-04-09T18:06Z,VLC plays most .mkv. I still have trouble watching GoT S1 with VLC but I can open the files thru Vuze and they play fine.
,dark_option,2012-04-09T18:22Z,"Idiots! It's very simple d/l VLC... It's free and it plays everything. If your streaming it to a game console, d/l ps3 media server, also free. It transcodes on the fly. done and done! Thanks eztv for the great uploads. Cheers"
,StayPlation,2012-04-09T19:44Z,Good quality. Thnx. Seeding with 25 Mbit/s.

,GUj.,2012-04-10T01:44Z,"Thanks eztv, great upload as always!"
,7b,2012-04-10T02:43Z,*.mkv won't play on XBox - which I'd guess at least half of us want it for. Please make clear when you're using a non-standard format in the upload.
,StayPlation,2012-04-10T03:34Z,"@7b: I'm watching it on a PS3, and PS3 doesn't support .mkv either. But there are ways to convert the .mkv files to .mp4 files which can be played on consoles. "
,mothymandinga,2012-04-10T10:19Z,Thanks for the up eztv.
,lavandina,2012-04-10T15:12Z,Great as always. Thank you!
,castiboy,2012-04-10T17:06Z,"@redsx:

Your hardware setup sounds pretty awesome. But this is a HDTV rip, it's already pretty compressed both before broadcast and after ripping, so there's so far you can go with good hardware.
Besides, if you know what you're doing you can have a pretty decent 1080p + 2.1 sound setup as your desktop, it doesn't have to be bad just because it's a computer.
If you value quality so much, wait for the Blu-ray release. HDTV rips get nowhere close to actual BD quality. The best you can do is uncompressed, which is huge (might as well buy the BDs), but BDRips are already way better than (relatively crappy) HDTV rips.

Now the real question here is which is better: HDTV vs WEBDL. From firsthand experience, webDL is usually better for animated stuff, but live action... I have no idea. Has anyone compared both releases ?"
,pratspall,2012-04-10T19:51Z,"Is there something funny with the audio during the broadcast for this season of Game of Thrones? Almost all HD rips from quality posters like this have 5.1, but for some reason all the season 2 game of thrones rips are 2.0. Even the massive 5gb rips are only in stereo. The video is flawless and the 2.0 audio is clean, but I feel like I'm missing half the show."
,Adesta,2012-04-10T20:43Z,"How dare you supply this torrent in .mkv format! 

I mean, seriously, ALLLLL that effort I had to go to...

Downloading VLC Player...
Turning on my TV and plugging it into my computer...

Frigging hell, I'm shattered. I'm going to have to go sleep this exertion off.

Disgraceful. I demand eztv come here and spoonfeed me my own carecup of QQ mixed with purple panther piss freshly bled from my caring heart too.


/end sarcasm

Seriously, I at least appreciate the effort that has gone into capturing this and providing it so early. Thanks. :)"
,hobarrera,2012-04-10T23:20Z,"Geee... mkv is as standard as it gets. What do you want, a Blu-ray ISO (or wharever blu-rays use)?"
,ucfmatt,2012-04-11T01:14Z,"You can view this file on an HDTV using a PS3 and no conversion is necessary.  Just use the Ps3 media server. Been doing this for close to a year, will play just about any file and you never have to worry about what format."
,verd12w,2012-04-11T03:30Z,@7b Every 720p eztv upload that I have seen has been in .mkv because .mkv is the scene standard for 720p. Expect it when you see 720p in a torrents name.
,starmartyr,2012-04-11T07:48Z,"@pratspall Hey I noticed a similar post to yours on the last couple GOT torrents as well. Are you checking mid-way through the show? The intro (what happened last episode part) is always in 2.0. The rest of the show starting with the opening credits is in 5.1. All of the torrents I've DLed for S02E01 and E02 have been 5.1 for the show. Double check man, otherwise it may be something not right in your setup."
,starmartyr,2012-04-11T07:58Z,"@thisisntwhatitlookslike Must be trouble with your blu-ray player and 5.1 sound from the file. The very beginning is in 2.0, at the intro credits it switches to 5.1. Often MKV can be trouble with 5.1 especially if it's encoded with DTS I've found. Try changing some of the audio options on the blu-ray player side. May have to downmix to 2.0 for this."
,starmartyr,2012-04-11T07:58Z,BTW great torrent as always EZTV! Wife & I religiously get HBO & Showtime shows in HD from you. Keep kicking ass!
,pratspall,2012-04-11T19:29Z,"I finally got 5.1 passed through correctly; the format switch was giving handbrake fits. FWIW AC3 passthrough is the only option that preserved the 5.1 track for my setup. Not exactly rocket science, but its the first I've heard of it..."

,SBonesE8,2012-04-12T01:30Z,ok so what should i do to get this 5.1 audio  n burnt to dvd with avs video converter? or will it just b 5.1?hate to waste a disc 
,SalivaArt,2012-04-12T06:50Z,@ppl complaining about xbox 360/ps3  use GotSent.  1 click mkv to mp4 conversion. and is fairly lightweight. usually ~20min for me. on my laptop.
