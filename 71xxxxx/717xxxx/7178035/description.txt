Recorded with DVC-100 which I got 2nd hand and is one of them generic devices in the market of AV recording with usb, so instead of nothing best i can muster with it is IPOD/MP4 versions which really i have no problems with at all considering i perfer the MP4 formats. These discs also have french audio tracks however I speak english and went with english rips, if a lot of people request the french audio tracked versions, i could put them up to.

Got first 3 volumes, and will be converting them as well.
