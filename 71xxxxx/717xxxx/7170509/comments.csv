@DerSpiegel64, who the fuck checks back on their PB comments 2 days later to see who took the troll bait... your obviously a looser and very jealous of others who own a big TV.
The economy in OZ is fine, everyone here has a big TV and we now build the biggest suburban homes in the world. We here are also glad we can download in full HD glory to take advantage of the great picture quality so suffer in your jocks."
