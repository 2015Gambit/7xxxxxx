Like many viewers of American Idol 2010, I was very let down when James Durbin was voted off. In my opinion, he should had won. Of course, my opinion doesn't hold my weight with Fox.

I have compiled all of James' American Idol 2010 performances onto one 72 minute avi video. Audio for each segment has been normalized. I hope you enjoy - I do.
