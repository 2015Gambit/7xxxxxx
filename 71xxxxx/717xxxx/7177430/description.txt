This is a torrent for the client restore cd used to restore an image of a pc from a windows sbs 2011 essentials server. i couldnt find this anywhere.
So after heavily researching, i found a way to convert a whs 2011 restore cd to a sbs2011 essentials restore cd. this does work, so feel free to download this and use it.
below are the various checksums to check your downloaded file.

File: en_client_restore_disc_windows_small_business_server_2011_essentials_x86_x64_cd_664348.iso
CRC32: 5B5589BB
MD5: B5C614DD2B8438566A1EDCF0FE6DAB8B
SHA-1: 678403787D1E364F65FF5BF27D3988C52792F132

this is my first proper release.
cheers,
