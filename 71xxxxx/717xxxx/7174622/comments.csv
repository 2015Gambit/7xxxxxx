Everyone seems to have their own opinion on this one.  I created this release in both formats so you can choose.  I have never been able to notice a difference in quality between the two.  At least not on my equipment."
,schmig,2012-09-23T00:23Z,"Hey Cheers For the DL. The difference between 320kb and Flac is huge Flac is 24bit, 320Kb is 16bit. Flac is the unaltered recorded sound whereas 320 although it is the best mp3 is still compressed, however saying this unless you are playing a big venue with great gear or listening on studio quality headphones or monitors you won't tell the difference. You learn something new everyday ha cheers again J"
