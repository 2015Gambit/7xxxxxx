,duldi,2012-04-15T17:32Z,Do i need a jtag or modded xbox 360?? 
,duldi,2012-04-15T17:46Z,"Please i need help would this work for me
i have a retail xbox 360 not modded at all completely clean. Would it work for me?"
,evuleyez,2012-04-19T18:17Z,@duldi .. You don't need a Jtagged xbox360 for this to work. I'm using a flashed console though. I don't know if this will work on a clean unmodded 360.
,evuleyez,2012-04-19T18:21Z,"@duldi Try burning the whole ""Content"" directory to a CD or DVD and try running it on your 360."
