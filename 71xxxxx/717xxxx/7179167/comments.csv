longer investigations
crazy sounds and speech 

but still taps such at investigating - no povs  to capture the shadows no thermal or full spectrum cameras no laser grids no speech boxes

i think they need josh gang to do it.. they can get better results"
[V],psspss,2012-04-12T09:14Z,"speaking of which thought destination truth was meant to be on this month?

see fact or faked is coming on again


and yeh actually think ghost adventures could investigate that taney ship better too"
