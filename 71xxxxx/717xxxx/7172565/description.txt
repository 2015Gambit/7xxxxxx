The Idea behind this was to create an easy to handle "all-in-one" package and at the same time keep the filesize as small as possible. To achieve this I made use of the Source-Engine's shared GCF files. More information about this can be found in the README file.

Multiplayer games were left out on purpose, mainly because they're updated too often and there are already about a million releases of them. They don't fit the idea behind this package.

This is my first release, I put a lot of work and time into it to make sure everything works fine. Feedback is appreciated!

Have fun!
