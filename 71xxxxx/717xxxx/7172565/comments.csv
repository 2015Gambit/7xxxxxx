,ColdFist,2012-04-11T12:06Z,"Great torrent! Was looking a long time for something like this ""all in one"" torrent... Thanks uploader!:)))"
,ramiax,2012-04-11T12:11Z,Official url is in README.txt file. In there you can post feedback right to the maker of this repack... :)
,dokter-e,2012-04-12T18:09Z,"Much compliments for your work Ramiax!!!!
This works great. (on my win7 64Bit)

Even parts of the game I never saw.

Thanks!!!!!!!!"
,Anroid869,2012-04-14T15:20Z,Anyone else getting a corrupt ISO when downloading this?
,grox19,2012-04-16T09:37Z,"For those with the corrupt ISO issues: download WinISO/IsoBuster, open the .ISO file, extract all .bin files, setup.exe and the redist folder somewhere, then run Setup.exe. Works fine this way."
,grox19,2012-04-16T10:24Z,"Or not. It DOES extract the files OK, but the installer pops up IsDone.dll error: Not Enough RAM (/w 2GB specs. Seriously, what the hell?) "
,ramiax,2012-04-19T07:21Z,It seems that there is a problem with HP PCs windows XP becouse it shows corrupt iso when you try to mount it. Looking forward to fixing this when i have spare time... 
,hlfan,2012-04-22T15:19Z,im kind of  sad  that  this  dosent  work cause i was  looking forward   to replay hl2 :(  i also get  isdone.dll error i hope ramiax can re-release this torrent without  problems
,ramiax,2012-08-02T09:45Z,"Here is the new torrent, where everything is fixed! :)

,kadorna1,2012-09-23T01:29Z,"Works great on win7 x64. This is a great torrent. For all the people getting errors when mounting the ISO, just extract it using 7zip and install directly. You can also burn this to 3 DVD5 with no problems, the installer will prompt you to insert the next disc when required."
