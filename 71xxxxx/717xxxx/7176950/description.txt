Adverse Effects of Vaccines- Evidence and Causality[Team Nanban][TPB]

NAS Press | 2012 | 895 pages | PDF | 6 MB

DESCRIPTION:

This book reviews the epidemiological, clinical, and biological evidence regarding adverse health effects 
associated with specific vaccines covered by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program including varicella zoster vaccine, 
influenza vaccines, hepatitis B vaccine, and the human papillomavirus vaccine, among others. 

The evidence shows that vaccines do not cause several conditions of recent concern. For example, the MMR vaccine is 
not associated with autism or childhood diabetes. The DTaP vaccine is also not associated with diabetes and 
the influenza vaccine given as a shot does not exacerbate asthma.
