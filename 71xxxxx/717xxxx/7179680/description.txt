SEASON 8 EPISODE 2 - Wanda
Wanda is a 47-year-old family therapist and former Mennonite who's trapped in a lifelong style snoozefest of bland, unsexy and totally colorless style. Engrained beliefs from her past and years as a tomboy have kept her femininity buried below a hum drum layer of khaki modesty. The sad result: Her love life is just like her wardrobe, stuck in neutral. Find out how Stacy and Clinton ushered Wanda into the world of femininity, a place where Wanda can find personal power and ease in expressing a more multifaceted version of herself.
