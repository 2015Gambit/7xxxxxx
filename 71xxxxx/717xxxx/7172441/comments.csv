,Herculine,2012-04-13T00:08Z,"Installs okay except the music is screwed. Is there any way to fix this? (I've DLed other versions of this game that worked fine; I'm positive it's not something wrong with my rig.) Anyway, thanks for the effort."
,sbseed,2012-04-13T01:27Z,probably need to re-up on this one...
,heylookitsprime,2012-04-13T23:21Z,"Im pretty sure I did everything correctly. Mounted with PowerISO, Installed, its in the same folder with PROPHET. I can start the game but when I press play I get an application load error 5:0000065434"
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-04-16T00:40Z,"well 9 hours. not bad i already used up 7 hours downloading the wrong version. the x box version. i hope this doesn't have any viruses. hard to trust ""Free"" 10.4% in and hour got 8 hours to go. well better go to bed when i wake up it should be seeding. i get average 400kb/s sometimes 1 mb. highest i got 1.8mb"
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-04-16T00:46Z,hey wow i just got a download spike. went all the way to 1.4-1.7 mb and it lowered it to 3.5 hours from 8 lol
,NastyNaHa,2012-04-16T19:20Z,Can somebody be more descriptive about installing this please? (:
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-04-17T00:23Z,turns out this is for like coping onto a disk and i couldn't figure out how to install it to my pc so i deleted it
,Umbras363,2012-04-18T03:08Z,"Come on, guys, it's not that tough.

I made this account just to explain it to you guys, so please and thank you.

1. Download the torrent with your program of choices, I use BitTorrent.

2. Once downloaded, go to wherever you set the destination as. It's just one .iso file. If it's more than that, then you really messed up or something.

3. Use the program of your choice (I use Daemon Tools Pro Advanced) to mount the .iso file.

4. Every game is different, and for this one, all you have to do is - once mounted - run the setup.exe file. No viruses. Scanned it clean :) However, I would suggest instead of just running the setup, OPENING the drive that Daemon mounted it to. Some games have special setup.exe's that will need you to open the game. My copy of Hitman: Blood Money made me do that.

5. Let the setup finished. When you're finished, and you're running Windows 7 64bit (not sure about anything lower, including 32bit, Vista, or XP), I would suggest installing both the C++ and DirectX files it gives you the option of installing.

6. Once that's done, go back to the drive ""folder"" where DaemonTools mounted it. Open that up and copy the CONTENTS of the language of your preference (if you can understand this, clearly, you open the ""EN"" folder) to wherever you installed the game. Whatever folder you have the launcher in, you're going to copy the contents and paste them there. Replace any file it asks you to, and then you can run the launcher and you're good to go."
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-04-21T03:47Z,"for some reason i downloaded it like a week ago then deleted from being overwhelmed. then i clicked the ""download this torrent"" right now and then i canceled it since my cpu was out of space from publishing a movie so it would probably crash my computer and then when i went to a folder where i send all my downloads too i found the fallout new vegas disk thing at 18 gbs even though i didn't downloaded it after i deleted it. did the download un delete it or something? because it only got to the point where it got checked then i removed it from my utorrent"
,omegaviper,2012-04-22T05:05Z,"@MrAwesomeLuis when you start a torrent it automatically fills the space before it's downloaded to makes sure the data can fit.  Also you said ""since my cpu was out of space""  you mean your hdd or ssd and your super dumb for what you did."
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-04-22T05:51Z,"Umbrus363 thanks for the instuctions i understand them much better now thanks to some videos and 

omegaviper when i said my cpu was out of space i meant it was to 100% from publishing a video which i didn't know it took up so much cpu till after i started the download. so i really don't get what you meant by me being super dumb"
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-04-22T16:54Z,"lol last time i downloaded it, it only took 8 hours right now i am at 10 hours with 30% but i see that now there arn't 10 or 20 leechers there are 101. i am going make sure to seed a least 1.5 after my download finishes in 12 hours. or 20, or 7 weeks lol"
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-04-22T23:39Z,ALRIGHT so thanks to Umbras363 i mounted and now running the set up. the only thing that can stop me now is errors and not having enough ram. about 16 hours to download for me but it looks like the other 101 leechers are still downloading. at least now we have 30 seeders
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-04-24T03:18Z,i got a vista 32 bit 3 gb ram with only like 1.5 gb usable and fallout new vegas seems laggy maybe 6-10 frames per second but it is good. thanks for the one who said how to install. all i need now is a better computer to be able to play games smoothly. $500 bucks out of my wallet should be good enough

,Sehsa,2012-06-06T04:45Z,"So.. This torrent. We meet again.
Let me tell you a very short yet horrifying story about this torrent.

I downloaded this, waited a whole week. It finished, and the game was wonderful. I had gotten so far. Put in close to 100 hours.
I was lucky to have made it that far.
Because I got a trojan. I got rid of it, thinking it was nothing. What I didn't realize was that it came from this torrent. So when my computer died for seemingly no apparent reason.. I was left with only that virus to go off of.
""But surely such a great torrent wouldn't have such a deadly virus!""
^That's what I told myself when I downloaded it a second time.
This time was quicker. 3 days later and I'm wondering why I have another trojan. I delete it.. Turn off my computer and go to sleep..
The next morning I had nothing but hard disk errors. ""Could not be read, press Ctrl, Alt, Delete to restart""
I had completely re-install windows.
And I lost it all.



You have been warned."
,Sehsa,2012-06-06T04:47Z,"TROJAN THAT KILLED MY COMPUTER. TWICE.
The game works, but after a little while your computer won't.
The second time this happened this was the only thing on my computer.
It literally could not have been anything else."

,steampoop,2012-06-18T00:27Z,Why isn't the patches included? I launch the game fine but it has bugs from the moment d.mitchell speaks to me. FNV UE should be fully patched since it's the final release.
,steampoop,2012-06-18T00:30Z,Why does this have bugs? The moment I start the game d.mitchell already has the first released bugs on it... This is the last release which should be fully patched...
