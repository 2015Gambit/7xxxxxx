Colin Murray introduces the best of the action and reaction from Easter Monday's five Premier League matches.

Chelsea made the short hop to Fulham for a west London derby which is always keenly contested. The Blues are fighting for a Champions League place, and Fulham have shone at times this season as Martin Jol puts his own unique stamp on the Cottagers. Last time they met, they drew 1-1 at Stamford Bridge.

Elsewhere, David Moyes's Everton hosted Martin O'Neill's Sunderland - a meeting of two of the wiliest managers in the league - while Norwich tried to stop Harry Redknapp's entertaining Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Other matches included Newcastle v Bolton, and Aston Villa v Stoke.
