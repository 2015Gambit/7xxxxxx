When a united, independent India was born, it was not without pains. Before the British left, our great country
was divided into a large nu mber of provinces, many of them under the rule of local princes. The Himalayan task ofjoining all the diverse regions of India to form a strong united nation fell upon Sardar Vallabhai Patel, who was known as the 'Iron man of India'. He was assisted by V.P. Menon, secretary of the Ministry of States. Theirs was indeed a task ridden with challenges, because different provincial kingdoms reacted differently to the appeal. Though Cochin joined the union easily, in Hyderabad, the I ndian Army had to tackle the Nizam's army before receiving a 'yes'.
Later, the nation was divided into a number of states based on their languages. Through all these birth pangs, a great nation was being born, ready to make its presence felt in the modern world and create history. This issue of Tell Me Why tells about our states.
