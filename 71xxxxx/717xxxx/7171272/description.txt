Description:
The Immortals of Terra: A Perry Rhodan Adventure is a point&click adventure game for the PC. The story is based on the Perry Rhodan science fiction novel series which has been running in Germany since 1961 and the game provides plenty of background information on the characters and the universe. The player takes on the role of Perry Rhodan, the immortal Regent of Earth, who after an attack on the Terran headquarter finds out that his close friend Mondra Diamond has been kidnapped. You embark on a journey to find her and unravel the mystery surrounding her abduction, while also learning more about the ancient race of the Illochim.

Bonus content: avatars, cg art, characters, concept art, manuals.

How to play:
1) Download the game;
2) Mount or burn disc image;
3) Run Rhodan Setup.exe to install (or press Install on launcher if you have autorun enabled);
4) After installation is complete, extract Patch.zip archive then run Perry Rhodan Patch 1.2 DVD Edition Setup.exe to patch the game;
5) After patching the game, extract TAGES_5572.zip archive then run TagesSetup.exe to install TAGES drivers;
6) Extract MiniImage.zip archive then mount Perry_Rhodan_Myth_of_the_Illochim_RUS_(MINI_image_xKVtor).mdf image with Daemon Tools on a SCSI drive;
7) Play the game with mini image mounted.

! Notice
There are cracks for the game, but all of them cause crashes to desktop at various points, with no way to progress further. The only way I found to play the game normally is by using the mini disc image, mounted using Daemon Tools on a SCSI drive (you must have SPTD drivers installed to use SCSI drives).
