,michaelrwatson,2012-04-10T22:03Z,"White English subtitles over white Chinese subtitles..? 

What moron did that?

Why not, e.g., *yellow* English subs *above* the Chinese subs..? Or even on top of them. Morons. "

V=5,  Video is too grainy and blurred for me.  

Not long to download, but I couldn't finish watching with current quality."
