Notes:
READNFO: Same as Sherlock, quality isn't the best. This release contains synced english subtitles
for the alien speaking segments.

Pretty much the same work done to this one as on Sherlock Holmes, this time I didn't the hardcoded
english subtitles though. Started off by running a few little tweaks over this, to touch up the
video, I ran a heavy denoise filter to get rid of a large amount of noise. Once that was done I
took it down to x264. Subtitles were taken from the TS .srt file I had, originally from Dank I think
so thanks for that, took a good 30 - 60 minutes to sync them but got there in the end and then added
them as a default track to the video. Won't go on any longer as i'm very tired. Enjoy!
