Good evening there

Here it is a good BDRip from "Wanted" BD's movie.
This is a BD-copy so size will be smaller anyway indeed.
Very acceptable and still watchable anyway.
However,few depixelisation may be prsent,sometimes,in certain scenes.
noise and grain seeming quite acceptable also.
Sharp/Bright/Color are properly respected.
This is not my best BDrip and i suggest you to watch it with :
Cyberlink PowerDVD 10,11 or 12
or
Media Player Classic-Home Cinema for best rendering anyway.
VLC media player appears less good for...
See yourself anyway.
