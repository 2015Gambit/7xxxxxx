bud what's wrong with you,huh ?
too slow connection ?
I think both furk proxy client might be your problem as they are dratiscaly slowing down my seed :(
however,
you appear not able to finish your download...
May be it's better for you to abort this last one ...or coming back later so...?
you make a problem at the bottom of my seed as certain peers get difficulty to connect bcause you are inactive anyway.
Please,take a quick and best decision for yourself so,thx.
ty for your understanding
regards"

to new dual faster quad core Xeon processors.We apologize for this inconvenient and we will be back asap anyway.
sorry again
