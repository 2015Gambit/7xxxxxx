From the artist's official web site:

"The album Fantôme - Intro Das Waltz was sound engineered
by friend Mariano Dias; it was released on CD, digipack
format.

The album's single was Legacy, for which a video clip was
made (directed by Rafael Lopes) and was exhibited in
several European television channels; In Motion had already
been included in compilation Offline (Fnac, 2002) and Kafka
(2002); Millais: Un Modèle Pour Ofelia was later released
in compilation Can Take You Anywhere You Want (Bor Land,
2005)."

Second free album from this Portuguese act. Downloaded from
the artist's Bandcamp store, including front cover like the
previous release (whose NFO mistakenly says otherwise), ID3
tags and file names cleaned up according to official web
site, and everything packed comme il faut. No reencoding,
of course.

Track 2 has a glitch at 2:10, which can also be heard in
the original downloaded file and in Bandcamp's player.
