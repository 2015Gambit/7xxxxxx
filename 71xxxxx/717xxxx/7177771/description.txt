Each week NME tells you all you need to know about music, from exclusive interviews and pictures and reviews to the UK's most comprehensive gig guide. NME has been there when all of the great bands emmerged from The Smiths and Libertines to The Artic Monkeys. If it's not in the NME then it's not worth listening to!
