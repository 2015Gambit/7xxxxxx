Rich Johnsons Iron Muslim #1


Trapped in a warzone, Al Stark has an epiphany: Americans are a superstitious and cowardly lot. I shall become a Muslim. Al, newly inspired, takes his jihad to New York City, and a showdown with a Freedom Fighter who resembles a certain Caped Crusader! Part of The Avengefuls saga, Bleeding Cools Rich Johnston takes us on a raucous ride through politics, fanaticism, and the healing power of Hollywood.
