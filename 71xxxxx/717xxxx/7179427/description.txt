This is the CBC broadcasting of the Alberta Ballet's show in tribute to Elton John's songs and career. The video files in high resolution M4V format and the full length video of the show in the MP4 format (low quality) were downloaded from http://www.cbc.ca/loveliesbleeding/


The point of the torrent is that only canadian IP addresses are allowed to view the streaming content on CBC's site, while people outside Canada might want to see this show, it's just gorgeous and adds a bizarre flavor to Elton John's music.

My upload speed is not good but at least it's on 24/7.

Enjoy while it lasts.
