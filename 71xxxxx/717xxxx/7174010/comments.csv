,rhalls28,2012-04-16T19:43Z,Working really good. Doesn't need previous updates too. Thanks!
,hexjoyce,2012-05-10T14:59Z,"Hey , this has no RAR inside ,your instructions say
""Unrar this cracked update into the <install> dir of the initial release.""
the thing is , all that u get when downloading this is a simple folder which contains :
-a readme file
-a reloaded system info file
-a folder called Binaries that contains :
    -MassEffect3Config.exe
    -another folder called Win32 that contains :
           MassEffect3.Exe

-where is the rar? where is the actual Update for the game. the folder downloaded from this torrent is 28.8 Mb , so nothing is lost in the download.
-sure i replaced the files as instructed and the game still works just as normally as it did before but , face import is exactly the same , meaning it's not working, can you give me a hand here?
what exactly do you mean by ""Unrar this cracked update into the <install> dir of the initial release"" ??"
,Jedi_Farseer,2012-05-27T12:09Z,"@hexjoyce
You dumb ass!!! it's already unrared!
just copy the content into your ME3 directory as sayed in the instructions and replace!
LOGIC!"
,Jedi_Farseer,2012-05-27T12:12Z,It does update. It mainly just makes the game compatible with DLCs.
,hexjoyce,2012-05-28T00:31Z,"@Jedi_Farseer hey idiot ,didn't your momma teach you not to troll a 3 weeks old post? i made a simple question to the uploader not to you. so gtfo"
,Jedi_Farseer,2012-05-28T07:10Z,"@hexjoyce 
Yeah you right... sorry man XD"
,Oneiros42,2012-06-05T08:43Z,Does anyone else's game crash whenever they get to a weapon selection screen?
,NephilimNexus,2012-06-13T16:47Z,Ha!  That trainer Gamezman mentions?  Redirects to an ad-scam site.  Not worth your time - you can get other trainers plenty of other places with less hassle.
