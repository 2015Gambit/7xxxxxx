,ajkane,2012-04-11T00:01Z,"Also, not many peers, make sure you use a DHT compatible torrenting software!"
,RossB345,2012-04-11T00:21Z,"Glad you like it!

Sorry if the speed was slow at first, my upload speed was at about 10kb/s but it's now at 120kb/s and has been fully uploaded (I have no idea if that makes a difference).

Also, I'm using uTorrent - is that DHT compatible? (I don't know much about torrents, first torrent uploaded)"

FYI the highest VBR setting is identical quality to 320cbr but it has smaller file size."
