A treatise about crowd psychology.

Some citation from the Preface section: 
"The following work is devoted to an account of the characteristics of crowds.
I have endeavoured to examine the difficult problem presented by crowds in
a purely scientific manner ΓÇö that is, by making an effort to proceed with
method, and without being influenced by opinions, theories, and doctrines."

If you are interested to find out how and why a crowd forms, moves and reacts this the book for it.
Or if you wonder how come becoming "one of the gang" aka being accepted by certain society being matters then this book has some insight too.
