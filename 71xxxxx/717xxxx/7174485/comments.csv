,SomeGuy2005,2012-04-10T15:44Z,"Thanks for the up, but what the hell is an R6???

Looks like a TS to me, far from a screener, but definetly an improvement on the cam which floated around under different names "

,xViviDx,2012-04-11T02:42Z,R6 is the region where the dvd is released. chinese falls under region 6.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_6#Region_codes_and_countries       ...this explains the different regions so you know what your reading on a torrent name
,saint84,2012-04-11T11:56Z,this is a telecine . as if you dl the telecine from scenebalance. you will see the korean subs . explains why it is not dvd or r5 quality 
,Groovejet,2012-04-11T14:10Z,"Slightly above average cam (not DVDSCR as in the title) as in it's full frame, correct aspect, sharper than a typical cam and lighted evenly. Also no people standing up and walking across the screen. It does however, have chinese subs and is low resolution and dark in many scenes like any other cam. Not suitable for watching on a big screen.
V=4, A=4"
