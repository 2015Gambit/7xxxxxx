,uggla72,2012-04-12T23:43Z,"Please mr spoiled brat Xalamanderx. Hold your horses! You have not contributed with anything. The guy might not know how it works.
PLEASE PIRPAWN WHAT YOU ARE UPLOADING. STAY UNTIL A FEW HAVE THE CHANCE TO DOWNLOAD AND THEN UPLOAD"

PLEASE pirpawn you have a treasure here. Please reupload and wait til at least a few have the possibility to download. As in all treasures it might take som time to find them"
[V],pirpawn,2012-04-13T01:51Z,"My dear friends, (especially to you xalamanderx), I am seeding progressively those files, by batches of 10 to 20 at a time. To date, approximately 15 are already fully seeded. For the time being, there are around 100. They will all have several seeds by the end of this week.  Many thx for your encouragements."
,xalamanderx,2012-04-13T02:58Z,"Sorry but I got very frustrated. Your are not going about it the right way. If you upload 10, seed them AND THEN upload 10 more, etc. it will be OK, otherwise people will tie up disk space for nothing for several days as well as torrents in use. The old movies are fine and we want to have them, even at a slow steady pace but NOT waiting for days before they just START to download..."
