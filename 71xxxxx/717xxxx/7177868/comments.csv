,(hotrodder),2012-04-12T05:30Z,"I was wondering the same thing? so many seeders and nobody cared to comment for others? but i will-
another Sony up? will not ply on my Sony player but does play on everything else after burning with convert x, audio & video not the best it does skip and parts missing, don't know how much is missing for this is first time seeing the show but some places seem to skip a lot, but overall watchable I guess, have to appreciate the effort for all of us that cant afford or get out to the movie's, so thanks for the up and my ratings are=
video=5-6 (blurry/dark/skips)
audio=5 (not bad but voices are off, little echos)"
