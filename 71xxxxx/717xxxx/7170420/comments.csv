,ZombieWarez,2012-08-16T08:02Z,"I have v3.5.4 as of now but it seems like androidslide the creators of Camera Zoom FX is rolling out updates one after another. So it would be pointless of me to UL an update every time. Besides most of them are just big fixes so if the versions you have is working fine then you don't need the update because nothing has changed as of yet,meaning no new ""extras"" or ""new features"" Although it is said that they will rolling out an update with ""loads of new features"" so I might just wait for that to roll out before posting an update for Camera Zoom FX. If anyone is having issues or this copy is ""buggy"" on your device I might consider posting v3.5.4 Thank you all for the support ! "
