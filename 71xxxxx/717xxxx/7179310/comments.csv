But... This file is not an MP4. It's FLV (Flash video file) that contains MPEG-4 AVC video, but it's not an MPEG-4 container file, which means it won't play on Macs without conversion, which is annoying. Since they're FLVs, I'm guessing they're webrips rather than actual compressed OTA captures. Secondly, the quality of these FLVs is so much lower than the South Korean files that I actually vastly prefer the South Korean files even with the subtitles and other screen crap. The compression artifacts made my eyes bleed. Sorry. FWIW, my girlfriend doesn't care, and I don't need to watch them with her, so I guess I'm just complaining for no reason. Sorry."

#2 Usually I upload the korean ones but they are now behind the actual eps so I do what I can to upload things ASAP for ppl that want them.

#3 As for the format I have no time to check, I upload in whatever format it's listed in, my comp can play anything in any format so if something comes my way in one format and is actually playing in anoher I have no way to know as my comp is not going to know the what is what.

Last but not least, if you don't like it buy it on amazon or itunes in the format you want, nobody pays me for this, I do it to help ppl out and if it's not your cup of tea it's not my problem. I blow 2 TB of bandwidth per month uploading things for no reason other than to get things to ppl quickly. If you don't like the format don't download it or invest in a converter program and go from there.

Like I said, nobody pays me for this stuff, like the Scene ppl I do it for the ppl, not for money or credit or anything else. If that is not good enough for you then find someone elses rip to download, I will not waste my time and bandwidth on a few ppl that can't or won't install the proper codecs to play something."

The fact of the matter is that there are no other rips that I or most people have access to (believe me, I've looked), so we'll take whatever you give us. I was just stating my personal preference for the superior video quality of the South Korean files and also correcting the misinformation as to the format of the file. This file is an FLV, same as the non-subtitled episode S02E01 and S02E02 files you uploaded a few weeks ago, by the way. It's a simple matter for me to convert it, but not everyone else might be so savvy."
,whmxtra,2012-04-15T04:37Z,"Dudette, not dude :)

But like I said, not my rip, I checked to make sure it played and was the right episode, beyond that I didn't check or do anything.

I prefer the Korean ones too, but they don't exist. Episodes 19 and 20 never hit the web from the Korean guys so this was all I could find. I suspect they aren't bothering since ABC3 has now caught up to Korea and will in fact pass it this week (episodes 21-24 should air in Australia this week while Korean will only get eps 21 and 22).

I don't have much choice in the matter, I only have 2 sources for these files, my friend back in Australia and the Korean guys. And if the latter doesn't put up the files I can't do anything but upload the ones from my friend."
,DarthPlagueis99,2012-04-16T05:50Z,"Sorry, dudette. :)

I never asked you to do anything, and I never meant to insinuate that I thought the rip was yours. I'm sorry if I gave that impression. If I a were to offer a suggestion, however, it would be to rename the files from .mp4 to .flv before you upload them here, but I'm not asking you to do that."
,whmxtra,2012-04-16T22:57Z,"Will take that into account, too late for episode 21 as I uploaded it before reading your post, but will keep that in mind for the other eps this week."
