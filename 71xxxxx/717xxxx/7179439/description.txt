SYNOPSIS:  
This captivating screwball comedy stars Cary Grant and Irene Dunne as Jerry and Lucy Warriner, a married couple who mistakenly suspect each other of infidelity and file for divorce -- but then go to ridiculous lengths to make each other jealous. Ralph Bellamy is hilarious as Dunne's new suitor, Grant and Dunne have rarely been better, and a scene-stealing pooch provides some hearty laughs. Leo McCarey won an Oscar for his sprightly direction.
