Competition is fierce in the hotel business. With the stroke of a key, one bad review on an online site like Trip Advisor can kill a business' reputation. So what's a struggling hotel operator to do? Hire Anthony Melchiorri, one of the most sought after hotel ""fixers"" in the country. His no-nonsense approach can turn any establishment around in weeks...and he plans to do just that in ""Hotel Impossible"". Each episode features a hotel fighting for its life.
