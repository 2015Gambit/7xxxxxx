Real Men of Azerbaijan - On travels to this European country a cameraman convinces a group of handsome straight Islamic men to wank their doodles for the camera.  If you like burly handsome dark haired Eastern Europeans then you'll love watching these hunky studs perform for you.

Where is Azerbaijan?  According to Wikipedia:  Located at the crossroads of Western Asia and Eastern Europe, it is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west, and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, while having a short borderline with Turkey to the northwest.
