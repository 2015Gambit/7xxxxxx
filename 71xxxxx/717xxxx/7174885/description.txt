"John Bolton is a god and Straub and Easton write about evil like it was their own invention. Let THE GREEN WOMAN sink its claws into you." ΓÇô ROBERT RODRIGUEZ (Director of Sin City and From Dusk Till Dawn )New York Times best-selling author Peter Straub resurrects his most sinister creation, Fielding "Fee" Bandolier, the unstoppable serial killer last seen in Straub's bestseller, The Throat. Aging and tired of a life devoted to death, Fee is preparing to end his long career of bloodshed. Bob Steele is a disillusioned New York detective out for redemption and to him redemption means a one-man crusade to stop Fielding Bandolier. Steele's father cruelly named him after a Hollywood cowboy hero. The name has been a curse because Bob has very little hero in him. But he's going to give it one last try. Cop and killer finally face off in a mysterious midwestern pub, "The Green Woman Tavern." And in that abandoned place, an unspeakable evil stronger than either of them lies waiting to seal the fates of both men.
