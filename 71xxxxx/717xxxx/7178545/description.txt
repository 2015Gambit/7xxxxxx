**** Bellow is instructions on how to install & 
what's done to the game (Stats etc..)
and new gang guns and gang territories ****


HOW TO INSTALL ~

FIRST OF ALL DON'T HAVE YOUR SA OPEN.

It's very easy to install, simply place the 'GTASAsf1' file 
within 'GTA San Andreas User Files'(the user files will most
likely be in documents) it will ask you to replace the
already there file. Say yes.
Now you can close everything and open gta. The saved file will
be called "End of the line" which is the final mission.
Load it and that's it :) hope you enjoy!

*GANG FACTS*

Grove Street Gang own areas in West Las Venturas, 
Desert, San Fierro, Desert Air Field, Suburbs, near Mount Chiliad and Countryside.
That means they will be everywhere!
Also, they don't have the standard gang guns, they have guns like ~

Mini Gun's, M4'S and Combat Shotgun's so they're pretty bad ass!





I really hope you enjoy, this game is amazing!
