i.e.: Han Shot First."
,accomplice7,2012-05-05T15:34Z,Does it have any subtitles?
,melzipan,2012-06-19T02:45Z,"Great quality. If Lucas'd used these for the anniversary, then there wouldn't have been a need to ""adjust"" or ""correct"" anything, lol."
,SkiRascal,2012-06-26T16:55Z,"Umm..the quality of this reminds me of a VCR tape that was left in the rain. Sorry, but it is just horrendous."
,peterw16,2012-09-24T05:36Z,I have no idea of the file format or resolution of video by the description. Can anybody tell me?
