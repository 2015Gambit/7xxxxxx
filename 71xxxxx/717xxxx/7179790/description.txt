SEASON 8 EPISODE 5 - Sarah W.

Sarah is a 26-year-old athletic trainer from Seattle with brains, beauty and a promising future. The only problem is Sarah doesn't see it. Her low self-esteem keeps her hidden in a bland wardrobe of boring khakis and ill-fitting, super-tight tops. After a recent weight gain, Sarah's lifelong battle with body image has spiraled out of control and she's taken to using a fierce negativity as emotional armor. Can Sarah see her all-star potential? Or will her serious cynicism be too much even for Stacy and Clinton?
