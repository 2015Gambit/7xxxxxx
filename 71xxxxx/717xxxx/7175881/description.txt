
This 180+ page hardcover book of The Culture Corner includes a foreword that says "We have included in this volume every Culture Corner strip extant - both penciled roughs and finished strips."  I had to look up "extant".  It basically means "everything that exists".  Many have never before been published.  Certainly a must for the Wolverton fan... and aren't we all?

I'm sharing two versions in separate torrents: one at 300 dpi and Photoshop jpeg level 7 which is about 380 megs, and one at 150 dpi level 6 which is about 80 megs.  An average scan in the big set runs about 2500 pixels wide; in the small set, about 1250.

There's also a sampling of Bedtime Banter, Bedtime Bunk, and Culture Quickie, and an introduction by Basil's son Monte.

Have Fun!
