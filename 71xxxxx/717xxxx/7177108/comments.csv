,LanMax,2012-04-15T18:21Z,"..seeding.

The only thing about this is that it's compressed (.rar)
People will have to uncompressed then have 2 copies in their HD. Most of them will delete the compressed one and seeding is gone.

I have a WD media center connected to my TV via HDMI so the file goes in there while leaving the rar file alone for seeding.

Thanks
