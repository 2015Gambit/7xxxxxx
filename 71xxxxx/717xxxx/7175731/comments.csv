,been12,2012-04-11T07:06Z,nobody wants 2d/3d conversions pal there crap
,jip-flip,2012-04-11T17:30Z,Thanks ADW_UK. I will give it a try. Do not mind comments from 3d is the future he does not post any contant at all on tpb. 
,Brucey7,2012-04-11T17:41Z,Nobody wants converts!
,FatFreddy247,2012-04-12T19:15Z,please ignore all the minus scores against this torrent it was an attempt to discredit the quality BEFORE its uploaded.  this is as good as you will get until the official 3D Blu-Ray is released and please come back and comment AFTER you have watched it.
,grotesco1,2012-04-13T00:22Z,"Blade Runner 3D (fake) post for adm_uk in 11/03 After a year he returns with another fake, this time with the titanic that only come out in September in 3D BD.
If you want to waste time, welcome to the club MothaFucka"
,FatFreddy247,2012-04-13T01:02Z,i asked the moderators to review the posts on this page earlier today and they removed a large number like the one from grotesco1.  i have been a member here for a number of years and never post misleading or fake torrents.  this is titanic converted to 3D and is perfectly acceptable until the 3D Blu Ray release later this year for NORMAL people.
,EDCXSW,2012-04-14T11:53Z,"This isnt very good at all. Its a conversion and should say so in the title instead of misleading people. Save your bandwidth people, its a poor conversion and also has a lot ghosting."
,410tc1,2012-04-14T19:24Z,"@uploader: man you must keep in mind before uploading torrent for that data, whatever it is no issues until it is found to be what you said about it and don't bother these -ve or +ve. If you are right then just don't care but while you decide weather you are right or wrong just be honest. 
I can't say its good or bad as i'm not going to download this anyway( whatever types of comment it has or how many -ve points ) as I don't want to see same story again.
Anyway Its a good thinking(idea) to see the 3D movies lol. I have to say your mind working good.
thank you"
,B_Lucky,2012-04-15T01:40Z,"I don't mean to be negative adw_uk because I look out for new 3D torrents as they do not come often but, this is not a viewable film. Terrible resolution despite the size and the 3D was obviously fucked up during rendering, uploading, or original recording.
Video:6 
Audio:7
3D:3"
,FatFreddy247,2012-04-16T14:17Z,"yes its a conversion, (as i said in the description) and its also the best available until we can order the official release.  i expected some abuse but not this much, a moderator told me that one guy opened up three PB accounts to post abuse about this torrent before it even completed uploading.  what saddens me the most is the large number of people happy with the torrent who havent bothered to post comments so its likely i will just be posting on demonoid from now on."
,Kara84,2012-04-17T12:53Z,"ok well adw_uk first off, you are arrogant saying this is just as good as the one in cinemas. Secondly this is no where near the quality of the one in cinemas, it is a crappy conversion and all of the 3D is bad.
 To be honest my tv does a better conversion than this copy. 
 The plain and simple truth is, NO ONE WANTS CONVERSIONS! Literally anyone can make a conversion, we want the real deal. If someone does how ever upload a conversion they make sure it is at least a good one. The aspect ratio was weird, the sound was out of sync and the 3D effects were horrible.
 If you feel you should go to demonoid then go ahead, all we are saying is don't upload converts and don't be so up yourself.  
 FYI Anyone who wants to make a convert use Dvdfab it is found on the piratebay and is easy to use. ANYONE can use it as long as they have a blu-ray drive on their computer. 
Movie = 10 - it is a great standalone movie
Video = 5 - the aspect ratio was bad
Audio = 3 - the sound was quite noticeably out of sync
3D = 2 - as i said the 3D effects were horrid, they are nothing like the one in cinemas. My tv did a better job rendering the normal blu-ray verson, much sharper aspect and 3D effects.
 Nothing how ever beats the real 3D movie that Will be available soon, so please DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS ONE, WAIT FOR THE PROPER VERSION. "
,Pirat47,2012-04-17T18:31Z,"Well, comments may have been removed but 50 minuses have remained. Converts are a waste of eyes.
There's a mistake in the title of this torrent - Titanic was produced in 1997."
,Kara84,2012-04-17T18:55Z,a heap of comments have been removed. If you want the truth check out the comments in utorrent under ratings. They Arn't censored there. But yeah -50 isn't a good sign. 
,Kara84,2012-04-17T19:22Z,idk if my comment was removed. Why is the piratebay censoring comment? Anyways check out the comments on utorrent under the ratings tab... Brutal. I feel kinda sorry for the guy. 
,EDCXSW,2012-04-19T14:03Z,"Why feel sorry for him? His title is inaccurate, wrong year and no mention of conversion. His description starts with ""yes its true"", how arrogant. As if we were all waiting eagerly for him to post a rubbish conversion? Then he gives it all this self-righteous crap about ""only download this if you own the original"". Titanic 3D is not available yet, Sherlock. And obviously he has never downloaded or uploaded copyright content. He then has the nerve to tell us that this version ""is perfectly acceptable for normal people"". Who the hell is he to decide what is acceptable for anyone else? If he leaves, then good riddance."
,Ajube0476,2012-04-19T23:35Z,Your first clue would be that this guy is to stupid to even post the right date in the title. XD /FAIL
,FatFreddy247,2012-04-20T02:13Z,"the wrong date was a typo, it was after midnight when i started the torrent

there is a clue contained in the sentence, ""Convert the 2D to 3D using DVDFab 8 Qt (MKV profile with AC3 Multi Audio)""

any negative comments from so-called members who criticise but UPLOAD NOTHING have no weight because without people like you TPB still goes on because of long-standing members like me who actually DO something


"
,FatFreddy247,2012-04-20T02:15Z,and how can Ajube0476 call me stupid when he cant even use the correct spelling of too in the context of the sentence
,FatFreddy247,2012-04-20T02:16Z,im more than happy to give a full refund to anyone unhappy with my torrent
,EDCXSW,2012-04-20T13:20Z,"Stop whingeing adw. The comments are here for a reason. If you cant handle comments on your torrents, then dont create them. And no, youre not some vital member of the torrent community, no one would bat an eye-lid if you disappeared."
,Kara84,2012-04-20T14:26Z,"careful guys. Adw_uk will run to the admin again and get every negatives comment removed. 
 EDCXSW I agree though, if adw_uk goes to demonoid it's not going to affect anything. What's funny is no one uses demonoid anymore... 
 Also adw_uk how dare you act all high and mighty, this torrent is horrible, plain and simple. Also where the hell do you come off saying your wife thinks it's great. Is she some kind of A.V. Expert??? If she is she fails at her job. 
 The torrent sucks and YOU should never upload anything again. "
,FatFreddy247,2012-04-20T20:50Z,"the moderators removed a large number of comments from one member and banned him as he had created 3 new accounts to have a go at my torrent when it was only 20% seeded.  i suspect the few of you commenting negatively might be the same low-life and one little test anyone can do is click on your names to see what contribution you are making to TPB and they will see NOTHING AT ALL, NO TORRENTS between all of you so crawl off back under the rock you emerged from and leave those of us contributing to the community alone."
,EDCXSW,2012-04-22T01:41Z,Still whingeing like a dog tied to a hot radiator. What a pathetic and arrogant little shit you are. Im more than a valuable member of the torrent community as my upload ratio is always at least 2.5:1. You on the other hand are just a plain and simple twat. We're all hoping you're on the next ship that sinks.
,Darklord56,2012-04-29T01:59Z,this wasn't made in 1987 it was made in 1997 -.-
,D4RK-KN1GHT,2012-05-09T13:43Z,"fantastic 2D to 3D convert, sat and watched all the way through and its perfectly acceptable till the official release in the autumn"
,D4RK-KN1GHT,2012-05-25T14:36Z,"we are all well aware that the studios employ people to become members and diss torrents to limit the exposure of the copy.  you can usually tell who they are as when you click on their name they have NO uploaded torrents so hello AGAIN foley84!

to everyone else this is a very interesting torrent and gives you an idea what titanic looks like in 3D till the official release.  there is a bug in the conversion software which means the sound goes slightly out of sync half way through the film but on streaming devices and VLC this is easily correctable."
,gdignoti,2012-08-04T15:54Z,tiene el castellano incluido
