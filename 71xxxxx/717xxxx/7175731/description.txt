Yes it is true the 2nd biggest movie ever in Hi-Def Side-By-Side 3D and 5.1 audio.

I saw this in the cinema on Saturday and this has turned out as good as i could have hoped. 

Please only download this movie if you own the original movie in one format or another.

Process was:

Obtain a hi-def source
Extract the 1080p 1920x836 25fps 9.071Mbps video and DTS 5.1 755Kbps Audio
Convert the 2D to 3D using DVDFab 8 Qt (MKV profile with AC3 Multi Audio)

Video Results:
Codec: H264 - MPEG4 AVC (Part10) (AC1)
Resolution: 1920x836 (2.25:1)
Frame Rate: 25
Bitrate: 7458Kbps

Audio Results:
Codec: A52 (Aka AC3)
Channels: 3F2R/LFE (5.1)
Sample: 48K
Bit: 448Kbps

Please note you need a 3D enabled TV with SBS technology and active 3D glasses to view.

Due to the known video/audio sync bug i have delayed the audio by 300ms to compensate and the wife said it was fine.
