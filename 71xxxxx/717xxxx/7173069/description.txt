How It Works - UK 3 Part Doco Series (2012) xvid avi S01E01 & E02 Metals & Plastics only in this collection

converted to xvid and resync-ed for those that want this format
and love science docus

enjoy and seed if grabbing

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
===================================
Ps/3 , phone and xbox users may consider grabbing
the free tool umile encoder 3.1.1.2 it can convert
to most devices to make compatible in 8mins
on dual core or higher. as some of my converts may
fail for certain devices.. you will need a pc to run it
though. no link just google it..
