Participating in combat operations and displaying your valour, you obtain awards and ranks, multiply your professional in-game achievements, and, excelling your opponents, climb up the GUNSWORDS players rating list, thus gaining access to new weapons, battle locations etc.

Armed military units of brave tin soldiers of three battle classes recruited for game points fight enemy under your sharp command. Each battle class has its arming line in the arsenal of the game, as well as its personal tactical characteristics. Upon completion of a battle, the victor is rewarded with game points. The grade of your arms and personal level of your recruiters, as well as the level of your enemies that are selected for your fights entirely depend on the amount of game points you have.

To those who like standing out against other players or having battles at some exotic places, the set of premium content is provided. It includes extra maps, fancy design of interface elements and characters and alternative videos of finismoves for each weapon type, that are purchased for extra money (see finishmovedemonstration on the game’s website).

If you are a fan of games of genre “turn-based > tactics > strategy” and you have an eye for exceptional graphics and game atmosphere, then be sure to check out this game. We wish you to have good chillout. And good luck in warfare!
