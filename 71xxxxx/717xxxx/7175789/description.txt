Universe Sandbox is an interactive space gravity simulator. Using Universe Sandbox, one can see the effects of gravity on objects in the universe and run scale simulations of our Solar System, various galaxies or other simulations, while at the same time, interacting and maintaining control over gravity, time, and other objects in the universe (moons, planets, asteroids, comets, black holes, etc.)

Features:

Interactive n-body gravity simulator
Simple tutorial introduction
Several step-by-step activities included
All units are measured in real units: kilograms, meters, seconds, etc.
User control of the speed of time, gravity and other factors
Simulation files are editable
3D Mode for use with red & cyan 3D glasses (anaglyph stereoscopic)
Support for 3D DLP HD televisions
Multiple color modes to help visualize and differentiate speeds and accelerations
Two collision modes, Bounce and Combine
Scaled ring systems of Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, and generate rings around bodies
Particle grids can be used to create 2D computer graphics or 3D computer graphics particle grids and then you warp/distort the grids and watch the gravitational effects by adding in moving planets or other objects (not in version 2)
"Line-up/chart" mode option shows a visual size comparison of the stars and planets
Includes the full sky panoramic view of the Milky Way from Axel Mellinger's photography of the Milky Way
Can capture high resolution screen shots
