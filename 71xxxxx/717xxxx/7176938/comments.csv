,jmhays09,2012-05-20T15:32Z,First of all thank you for your rips release lounge and thank you for uploading them neon. On several of the newest rips including this one it seems like the first 2 or 3 mins is kinda glitchy but then the rest of the movie is perfect like usual. Is anyone else having this problem or is it just me?
