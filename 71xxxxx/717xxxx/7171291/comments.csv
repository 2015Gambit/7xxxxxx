God that Cameron guy is an egomaniac.  Did anyone else even get to talk in this?  And the whole time it was ""I... I ... I.. me... me... me"".  Well, James Cameron's hubris and egomania are legendary.  Good thing he's made money as a director (which is the measure of success irregardless of your films being good or bad).  In that way he's like Apple's Jobs, a complete douchebag as a person but good at what he does."
