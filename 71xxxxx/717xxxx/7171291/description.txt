Titanic: The Final Word 
James Cameron's epic 1997 film Titanic won 11 Oscars and grossed well over a billion dollars worldwide. Now, National Geographic Channel joins the director and Explorer-in-Residence for the ultimate forensic investigation into the most infamous shipwreck of all time in Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron. Cameron, who has made more than 30 dives to explore the Titanic, brings together a team of engineers, naval architects, artists and historians to solve the lingering mysteries of why and how an "unsinkable" ship sank. With their combined expertise, they'll examine the feature film and determine what technology has revealed since its release. An investigation of this magnitude has never been attempted before, and some of the revelations may alter the fundamental interpretation of what exactly happened to the Titanic on April 14, 1912.
