i liked the part when there all swarming to get back thier jewels and riches from the hole inthe wall thing haha, like that lot sank with the ship hmm im sure it did.  if it was all a scam im glad the elitists got scammed just as bad =)"
,djnero,2012-04-10T13:14Z,"Jacob Astor (head of a european banking family) was the last opposition to the federal reserve being set up again in america, also its reported he met with Tesla a few times and would of financed him when J.P Morgan pulled the plug. which of course would of made this world a very difference place. diffrent as in the opposite lol.
Faulty metals, captain was 25 year veteran sailing that stretch, over 7 telegrams telling him to slow down, no binocs in the crows nest are just a few things that make the ""offical story"" stink, like they often do"
,libertaswv,2012-04-10T23:24Z,"^ Interesting - thx, djnero. Wish you'd posted more on the Tesla/Morgan/Astor thing. There are so many moments in history that helped to lock power in the hands of the wealthy class. 

Tesla might well have freed us all, for all we know. Significant branches of his work were disappeared for a reason.

Thx to eztv and all s/l's..... Sincerely appreciated.

I like Fellowes' (sp?) writing, but i am sick to f'n death with stories told backwards, chronologically, or those that jump around in time like this one. Why can't they just start at the beginning and tell the story to it's conclusion? It rarely adds anything to the telling.... No extra insight, no valuable perspective... Nothing. It's just a silly, trendy gimmick (much like the equally absurd 'ambiguous ending' trend), and it's REALLY annoying. 

imo.

Having said that, i'm still off to watch this ep, lol...thx ez!"
,BkwrmP6,2012-04-12T04:43Z,Watch out for this one. When I went to delete it I finally  had to my security software shred the damn thing.
,libertaswv,2012-04-13T00:19Z,"^ yeah, seconded.... Weirdly, this is the only eztv seed (out of many hundreds) that used a codec unrecognized by convertX. Gonna go for the TvTeam AFG release instead. "
