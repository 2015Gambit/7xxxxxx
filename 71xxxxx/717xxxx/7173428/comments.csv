,AFSCN,2012-04-16T06:57Z,"Reset my history inside torrent program and it erased all torrents and soundtracks i uploaded and was seeding. It was an accident(oops). I will uploading everything again, but i will do 50 uploads every 48hrs, ensuring proper transfer to everyone. Not many people seed after downloading(lol)
