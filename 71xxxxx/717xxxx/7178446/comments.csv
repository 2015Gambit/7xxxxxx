,Chaos_is_law,2012-04-16T18:04Z,"Hi,
This is the first time I use an ISO file, and I'm able to mount it but I can't find the crack. When I mount it (using Magic Iso 5.5), I see the files as they would show when actually reading the disk and I see several setup files.

When I use the install.exe file, it says the ""setup.dat""-file is missing while I see a setup.dat right under the install.exe.

When I use the setup.exe, I need to enter a product code which I don't see.

In the map ""Razor1911"", which is made by the creator of the crack I guess, I find 2 more setups. The SkyrimLauncher.exe-file says that it can't find any .INI files and that I should reinstall Skyrim, and the TESV.exe file won't work because the steam_api.dll file is missing on my computer.

Help please?"
,Kiribachi,2012-04-20T13:47Z,I got the game to install correctly and it works fine until I press new game then it will take me to the loading screen then close. Help?
,Falko_Fbob_Cherry,2012-04-24T05:32Z,"Game opens in window (running windows Xp) and didn't change when I switched full screen in the prefs. Any suggestions? :)

Otherwise it seems to be working fine, there's some lighting weirdness and mouse jerking but it hasn't bothered me."
,GreekNuke,2012-05-06T20:22Z,When i click play the window flashes but nothing happens....any1 can help?

,mdbrown80,2012-05-15T14:13Z,"@Chaos_is_law
Did you figure out what to do? I'm having the same problem."
,nealto,2012-05-28T21:18Z,"hey im having an issue getting it to even installing it i extracted the iso and mounted but cant find the install file there so i tried the launcher and got this error message:

Unable to find INI file. Please reinstall Skyrim.

,nathanfat,2012-05-29T17:02Z,"I've installed the game correctly and when the Main menu comes up and I click ""Play"" nothing happens."
,Targetstar,2012-06-05T00:43Z,what version is it?
,zjgrey,2012-06-06T01:50Z,"for those having issues - use the install.exe (Razor ico), then copy Razor1911TESV.exe to the new install directory which contains the steam_api.dll file and run from there.  worked like a charm."
,epic93,2012-06-12T12:52Z,"it works fine, but how can I set it to full screen or
change the window resolution?"
,epic93,2012-06-12T16:23Z,"nevermind, I was opening the wrong .exe file, got it fullscreen"
,nickmaiden1,2012-06-28T00:39Z,"Every times I start a new game,

,APPLEjucie554,2012-07-29T04:28Z,"only getting this torrent because my skyrim cd broke and i need to replace it, thank you 10/10 works perfect."
,AshlynR,2012-08-21T02:57Z,"Whenever I open the 'Skyrim Launcher' it tells me ""Application load error 5:00000065434""

What am I doing wrong?"
,AshlynR,2012-08-21T03:01Z,Oh nevermind.. I'm retarded. Ha
,SupermanSwat,2012-08-21T23:24Z,how did you fix the application load error? when i installed it the error said something about steam so i installed steam and now it says error 53... HELP
,milkbasket,2012-09-07T08:57Z,"OKAY if you're having trouble - 
1. Mount ""rzr-skrm"" with the program of your choice (I used MagicDisc)
2. Let it auto run, or just run ""install.exe"" inside the mounted image.
3. Razor1911 will install Skyrim to your C: drive (or you can specify).
4. You need to copy the contents of the folder ""Razor1911"" which is inside the image you mounted in step 1.
5. Paste these items (atimgpud.dll , binkw32.dll , SkyrimLauncher.exe , and TESV.exe) onto your harddrive where Razor1911Installer installed them. (mine is C:Program Files (x86)The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim)
6. Start the game by executing SkyrimLauncher.exe"
,milkbasket,2012-09-07T08:59Z,"And fuck AshlynR - ALWAYS let your peers know how you got it to work. There is always somebody who has the same problem as you had.
