,KevTheOne,2012-04-12T06:11Z,You are the guy!
,vmax10,2012-04-12T06:13Z,"the developer of this software is a pretty nice guy and I don't think he sells very much since it's so specialized and caters to such a small audience.

if you like the software you should buy it to help support FS developers like FS2Crew.  

These guys aren't exactly making millions of dollars per year like the big game houses.

Without FS2Crew, PMDG, Level-D, etc., flightsim would suck.

Support them or kill the hobby."
,KevTheOne,2012-04-12T06:50Z,Please seed i'm also stucked at 80%
,EbraheemNA,2012-04-12T09:17Z,"AMAAZZING!!, Thank you a lot man, I wish you could bring the Ground Services X.. Thanks again!"

sorry, I had to stop seeding in the middle as I was asked to."

,Scofit,2012-04-12T17:05Z,"Talk about some sanctimonious bullshit! He has uploaded many torrents from developers that have no employees at all, except themselves. I thought this was piratebay. You play this bullshit of wasting peoples time as well as bandwidth, jerkoff and then make speeches as to what you think we should pay or not for. Oh, but if its something you want it fine, ass hat."
,KevTheOne,2012-04-12T18:01Z,"_SnakEye fucking hypocrite wasting ppl time, grow up 8 years old kid"
,_SnakEye,2012-04-12T18:05Z,"I understand how you all feeling and I don't blame you.

You just have to understand me that I had to stop this as I was asked to.
My mistake was posting this Torrent in the 1st place ""Waisting your time and bandwidth"" as you all described it."
,_SnakEye,2012-04-12T18:07Z,I will ask the TPB Mods to remove this torrent on reducing confusion.
,KevTheOne,2012-04-12T18:15Z,"don't worry folk, we will eventually get it, i'm pretty sure some users managed to complete the transfer before this cock sucker stopped seeding"
,Scofit,2012-04-12T18:48Z,"Just so you all know, this vmax10, ya know, snakeye's bud, is actually FS2Crew himself, I've seen him come on here whenever one of his versions gets posted. It goes way back with this shit. But amazingly, you never hear him chime in when other developers are being uploaded, only his shit. Once again, fuck you snakeye!"
,psyonicus,2012-04-12T19:05Z,"Well this sucks.
For the record: I have paid for every single piece of software I've got. As with each torrent I've downloaded, the reason I'm hoping to get this is because the developer offers no demo version and no refunds. Its one or the other ppl, especially with software priced that high. I'm not about to purchase something blindly just to find out it doesn't meet my expectations or doesn't run or whatever. You might have disposable income, I dunnot. On the other hand, if I'd kept it, I'd surely pay for it as I have always done.  "
,InvisibleGhostSniper,2012-04-12T19:15Z,"Yeah right, like I'm gonna buy this shit so I can use it on a pirated NGX. Steal the shoes, but buy the socks, right?"

,Scofit,2012-04-12T19:29Z,"And of coarse, Snakeye wants the Mods to remove the torrent, because it shows what a total hypocrite actually looks like. Amazing. Look at the software this guy has on behalf of the piratebay. Your a total joke. "
,Scofit,2012-04-12T19:39Z,"Now this little fucking brat posts a new torrent, while all this is going on, what a little piece of shit..."
,_SnakEye,2012-04-12T20:28Z,"Scofit, no one is forcing you to use the torrents I am offering."
,KevTheOne,2012-04-12T20:36Z,I'll love to see this piece of shit banned from TPB
,AeroZoft,2012-04-12T20:50Z,"Here you go guys.

,_SnakEye,2012-04-12T21:11Z,"KevTheOne, I you are really fullish. I really don't care if I get banned. the one that should care is You as you won't see that huge amount of torrent flow here in TPB from me.
I only joined in to release stuff, if I get ban? what do I care, you guys will suffer not me.
I'll just become an anonymous leecher.
so saying the statement you just said , is like saying ""I hope my dad would loose his job b/c he didn't give me my pocket money this week""
well, let me tell you something, if your dad looses his job, you aint going to see any pocket money for a long time, not only for that week. "
,Scofit,2012-04-12T21:43Z,"Where the fuck are you from snakeye, you write like you have two fingers in your asshole. I don't give a fuck personally if you ever post another thing here, you little fuck...."
,KevTheOne,2012-04-12T21:46Z,"@_SnakEye go suck a cock you stupid fucking cunt

@AeroZoft thanks a lot mate! Downloaded and installed!"
,Scofit,2012-04-12T21:47Z,"By the way snakeye, I see you never responded to the vmax10 comment, did ya, you shithead. "
,_SnakEye,2012-04-12T22:04Z,actually I did.
,winkerbie1234,2012-04-12T22:19Z,"guys calm down, look _sankeEye got a bit emotional about the creator and stopped sharing this particular addon, someone uploaded elsewhere for us, download that and lets move on... hes uploaded many other great torrents so lets not just turn on him"
,Scofit,2012-04-12T22:30Z,"I'm talking about the comment I made about vmax10, you moron, I know exactly who he is. Man, what a pea brain you are...... "
,Scofit,2012-04-12T22:33Z,"@ winkerbie1234, and so? What of all the other creators huh, just this one? That's fucking ridiculous..."
,_SnakEye,2012-04-12T23:19Z,"Scofit , I'll tell you why.
the only thing IMO that makes this Simulation worthy and realistic are two things. PMDG and it's accessories (other vendors that produce Addons for PMDG), that is what keeps me going on with FSX and many of us too.
the rest of the addons IMO is nice to have but not a must.
now if we kill those two by making it no longer worthwhile producing products, we are shooting ourselves on the leg.
that is why I am not in favor of sharing those products.
as I said before it was my mistake that I posted them in the 1st place.
I personally buy those addons,
I buy all my FSX addons to show support. I never ever post here Addons that I purchased, only addons that were posted elsewhere I bring in front of you.
as I do , I recommend if you like the addon, then go buy it. I post it more for you guys to test the full version before deciding on moving on and buying it. if you do not wish on buying it you should exercise some discretion and remove it from your machine."
,Scofit,2012-04-12T23:40Z,"That is biggest load of shit I've ever read. So, you can do damage as you say to other developers and post their work, but your buddy vmax10, whom we all know is FS2Crew is safe. Hey, I got a fucking news flash for you, this is piratebay jackwad. Your here uploading shit because you want to be a star as you said, remember? Just like your hero on here. And when you began you said he gave you the inspiration. Get a fucking clue. By the way, what you think is important to the flight sim world means fucking nothing. I've seen dozens and dozens just like you come and go. Your not even a hacker, your just a fucking site thief, just like all the rest of us!"
,_SnakEye,2012-04-13T00:24Z,"@ Scofit - if you don't like my reasons, feel free not d/l what I got to offer
boycott my torrents if it would make you happy, no one is forcing you to download them.

BTW-
you complain a lot for one that never uploaded a torrent in his life here.

you are probably one of those that if you were given a pile of gold you would complain it was to heavy."
,Scofit,2012-04-13T02:04Z,"Hey Snakeye, fuck tard, I've uploaded more shit than you'll ever fuckin know on here, this is my forth account change to avoid being run down by Comcast, now shut you little piehole, you little scum fuck!"
,captaind,2012-04-13T02:21Z,"Now I see what the hate is about in the other posts.  Listen folks, just calm down.  Some of you are getting very upset over this.

I love very high quality add-ons for FSX, and I love to get them here first to try them out.  I have been burned before paying for add-ons that are junk.  I think most of the add-ons out there are junk.  FS2Crew may be awesome, but I won't buy until I can try the full product.

That said, _SnakEye is under no obligation to provide pirated software, and it's his prerogative if he wishes to seed or not.  I for one would like him to seed, but I'm not going to get pissed and call for an outright ban for not seeding ONE of his uploads.  He's provided some other good stuff, and seeded, and I'm grateful for what he has uploaded and seeded.

Just calm down, you're all getting upset over 1's and 0's that you won't give a thought towards in time.  It's just a program... "

,captaind,2012-04-13T03:34Z,I'm almost at 92% but stuck there.
