[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-10T02:05Z,"No worries, but people please let me know if the quality is ok. If it is, that means I should be able to get you these in less than hour from their original air time!! I am slowly working out how to do this better each time :)"
,djt067,2012-04-10T03:36Z,"as soon as i dl i will report gaz, prob is taking 1day+ at this rate. "
,Astro-F,2012-04-10T07:59Z,Thanks Gary. Quality on this is fine.
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-10T11:47Z,"Thanks! Now, fingers crossed, I can get these for you every week straight after it airs!!!!!!"
,djt067,2012-04-10T12:34Z,"Gaz, video is not as good as u have done prev for sure, last seasons ep def better I believe,  i would give v-7 and a-8.  But am very appreciative for your work and time u put in to bring these to us."
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-10T13:15Z,"Thanks mate, your honesty is appreciated. So, I can upload the PDTV version when I see it (Not up yet) and can continue to do both versions weekly or just the PDTV cap every week. I am not capable of doing a PDTV myself as that is a Pure Digital TV rip and would need to be in the U.K and record it on a hard drive. This is the best a/v I can get from a webrip so far, and if people are ok with this quality, I can get it out nearly straight away. I will let you, the people, decide!!!
If I get no responses, I will continue to do a webrip."
,djt067,2012-04-10T16:30Z,"To be totally honest Gaz, this is fine, no need to go making things difficult, this is def ok to have evry week, lets be honest its just great to be able to watch it, either same day or next it dont make much dif to me, but others may have a dif view.  Do whats easiest for you, this webrip was fine.  Your a legend just for doing it IMO (*_*)"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-10T16:37Z,Sweet mate. I'll keep it as my webrip uploads unless I get a few people asking for the other version. Cheers :-)

,Sparky404,2012-05-27T04:13Z,"Hi,
Does anyone still have this torrent active? Nobody seems to be seeding. If anyone can seed for awhile then I'd be happy to carry on the baton for a while. MIC S02E09-11 and MIC S03E01-03 seem to have seeding problems.
Thanks"
