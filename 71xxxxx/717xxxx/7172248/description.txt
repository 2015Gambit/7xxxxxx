"Life After Death"

When new tracks are leaked from late 
rapper J-Stryke, music mogul Big Glade and 
his business savvy lawyer, Leo's former 
love interest, ask Walter to find the 
source of the illegally released music. 
Walter and Leo locate the DJ streaming the 
tracks with the help of Willa's online 
hacking expertise. But as Walter pieces 
together the events that led to J-Stryke's 
death, he uncovers a more complicated 
history. Meanwhile, Big Glade's lawyer and 
Leo rekindle their romance.
