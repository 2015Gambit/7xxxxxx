-----[PATCH NOTES]-----
After playing through Conviction several times, the patch had fixed a lot of bugs that I had
the pleasure of fighting with. The biggest improvment the patch provides, is the recognition of
newer graphics cards and also improves mouse + keyboard controls.

Without the patch, your controls will likely lag, no matter how fancy your keyboard is.
