[T],AncientRome,2012-04-13T03:40Z,"Yes, but I didn't see much need for the 1.04, unless I was given bad information."
,carsonal,2012-04-24T20:32Z,"Everything seems to work fine so far, but the sound during gameplay doesn't work. (wouldn't mind it if I didn't care about the story at all) but this is only during gameplay not actually during the cutscenes. Kind of odd, get back to me as soon as you can please!"
