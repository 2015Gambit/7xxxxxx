That 70 show is a sitcom based on a group of teenagers who lived in Pointplace, Wisconsin, in the 1970's.  Eric Foreman has a lot of fun and sometimes problems (mostly problems) with his friends and family. This is the full 200 episodes, not uploading fake passworded bullshit here.  Seed and enjoy!
