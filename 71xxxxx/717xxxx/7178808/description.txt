                              The Complete Season 1


House Of Lies (stylized as Hou$e of Lie$) is an American comedy television series.

The show focuses on a team of management consultants from Galweather & Stearn, the #2 ranked management consultancy in the U.S., who are based in Los Angeles but take on projects across the world. Their key competitor is Kinsley, the #1 ranked management consultancy, whose name is reminiscent of real life top consultancy McKinsey & Company. The team comprises Marty Kaan, the (junior) Partner, Jeannie van der Hooven, the Engagement Manager, and Doug Guggenheim and Clyde Oberholdt, the Associates. In a move unlike normal consulting, this team composition remains constant for the entirety of the season, while in most consulting firms teams are assembled on a per-project basis. They stop at nothing to get business deals done, even if it calls for extremes.
