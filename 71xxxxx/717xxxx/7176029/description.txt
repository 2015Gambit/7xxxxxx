"Inside Probe"

In a very special "mockumentary" episode, 
Nancy Grace examines the "real story" of 
Hope's mom, serial killer Lucy Carlisle. 
Grace interviews each member of the Chance 
family, all of whom relay personal accounts 
of exactly what happened when Jimmy met 
Lucy back in 2008. At the end of the 
program, the Chances are shocked to find 
out developing details about Lucy.
