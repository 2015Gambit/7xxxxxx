Investment in executive development has grown exponentially over the last few years. In particular customised programs, made-to-deliver to the precise needs of organizations, have increasingly featured in business school remits.

ΓÇô Why do successful organizations with their highly educated employees look to business schools for such development interventions?
ΓÇô What are their aims in this and therefore what kind of programs do they commission?
ΓÇô What do those programs contain?
ΓÇô Who are the principal contributors and what attracts key Faculty and subject experts to play a part?
ΓÇô How can one measure the impact of such interventions?

This book addresses the above questions. Written by a program director of customised interventions at one of the world's leading business-school-providers of customised programs, the book summarises the three prime reasons why customised programs are commissioned. With views from corporate sponsors, participants and Faculty contributors, it explores executive education through case studies of customised programs commissioned by 6 organizations.
