32 issues of CARtoons, a wide mix from issue number 2 in 1960
through December of 1992 after they had quit numbering them.
Note that some are so low res that it takes zoom to read the
text and even then it's difficult.  One issue is missing one
page, and there is probably an insert or iron-on missing here
and there, but overall a lot of nostalgic fun.

Plus three issues of Hot Rod Cartoons.
