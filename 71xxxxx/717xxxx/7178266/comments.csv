,doodoo22,2012-04-11T22:48Z,Can someone confirm this is the real deal?
,KeuWrk,2012-04-12T01:32Z,"This is the real deal, installed it and it's running haven't played it but the game starts (running 64-bit Windows 7).

Been waiting for this game gonna be awesome!
Thanks for uploading!"
,brutal_product,2012-04-12T02:55Z,"confirmed on win7x64. fun little dungeon crawler, pretty straight forward if you've ever played any table-top pen-paper rpgs. tutorial's not much: right click on your equipped items to attack. also you can look around 3-d w/ rt mouse. thx azaq318. would've never found this game!"
,schizoLur,2012-04-12T03:31Z,"Lads I feel like a bleeding hypocrite even saying it but please pay for grimrock if you want to play it!,
the 4 man indie team that developed it as a labour of love really deserve the money and its only 15 dollars,you can get it DRM free on Good Old Games or direct from Almost Human.
I can count on the fingers of a blind epileptic butcher with leprosy's hand the amount of games i've paid for in the last few years but this is one,and its worth it,I'm fully prepared for the backlash of hate but it needed to be said."
,brutal_product,2012-04-12T04:11Z,"After an hour of playing, I agree. It's worth a couple bucks. Difficult at times but growing on me >) just don't be expecting Skyrim in this..lol"
,asdfkjjj,2012-04-12T11:02Z,I can't fathom why anyone would want to play with that ancient control scheme. game blows.
,sage1210,2012-04-13T01:45Z,"only bad thing about this game is when you get poisoned by enemy. 

this game not have cure poison spell !!!

you have to mix antidote potion for your self but it damn very limit ! when you have only two or three of them in you pocket but the enemies awaiting for you is nearly dozen plus every bite of them make you poisoned !!

How to survive this ?! "
,schizoLur,2012-04-13T20:11Z,"You can sllep your way out of any status effect,poison or disease,just find a safe place and catch some z's."
,valg2,2012-04-16T01:56Z,does anyone know of a trainer or a savegame editor for this game? I'm getting my ass seriously kicked in level 5 on hard
