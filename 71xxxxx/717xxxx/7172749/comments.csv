I will be at the AGT tapings so if anyone is going to the NY shows maybe I'll see you there!

peace & love"

This whole downloading and immediately deleting it when you finish is selfish and is going to screw yourself over in the end when other people do the same thing and it takes forever to download the torrent in the future.

So change your habits... "
