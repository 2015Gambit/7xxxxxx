,KawaiHentai,2012-05-10T06:31Z,"Hey guys, the preview pics are not gonna work for a while, unfortunately someone reported my site to blogger, and they took down all my posts. I'll have to get my own hosting but that'll cost some money, which I currently don't have. Sorry, but you guys will have to wait until I come up with some money to pay for my own hosting. Like ""Kawaihentai.com"" on Facebook if you got any questions or for future updates."
