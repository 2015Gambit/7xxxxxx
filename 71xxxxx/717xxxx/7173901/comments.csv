If yall have trouble opening this file, just know that Mozilla FireFox has an addon called ""LUCIFOX"". It is an .epub reader and will work just fine. Once installed, you may drag and drop the .epub file into the browser. Simple as that and then some (read the user manual that comes with it). I do not know of any other non-browser .epub readers though.

As fer the eBook... Hmmm. Will keep reading it. Interesting. Will seed."
