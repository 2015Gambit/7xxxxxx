Forza 4 Motorsport for Jtagged XBOX 360

DLC has also been included:

* 1950-2000 Model Year Car Pack
* 2001-2005 Car Pack
* 2006-Current Car Pack

To Install (easiest way)

You will need:
XEXMenu
XM360 (included)
Fat32Format
USB Drive with 10.5Gb available (Formatted to FAT32 using "Fat32format")


STEPS
1. Format usb drive (as described above)

2. Copy contents of this torrent onto USB drive

3. Load XEXMenu on your Jtag

4. Copy the 4D530910 and XM360 folders into the directory Contents/0000000000000000/ on your Jtag HDD (Note : The DLC needs to be on the actual XBOX 360 HDD not a separate USB drive)

5. Load xm360.xex in the XM360 directory, Select Refresh ALL>Show DLC>Unlock DLC>Exit to Dash

Now your on the dash and Forza 4 Disc 1 will now be in your game library as a "Game on Demand" and Disc 2 is already installed as is all the DLC

This will save you a massive fuck around having to set this all up manually as I did.

Enjoy ;p
