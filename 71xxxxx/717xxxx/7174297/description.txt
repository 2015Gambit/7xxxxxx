Save the Titanic
When Robert Ballard and his team discovered the Titanic in 1985, they chose not to remove anything from the wreckage. According to the laws of the sea, removing anything would have meant that Ballard and his team were the owners of the site. Two years later, a private company returned to the site of the wreck and claimed it as their own by removing artifacts. Evidence is mounting that the Titanic is under siege by natural forces, careless visitors and rogue salvage operators. Robert Ballard, along with families of Titanic victims and survivors, is on a mission to ensure that the Titanic will survive for another 100 years.
