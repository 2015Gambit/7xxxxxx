Intro:

	This application was made to download music from SoundCloud given an artist and title.

	Although I'd love to say it has a 100% success rate I cannot. It seems more successful
	with genres such as Drum & Bass, Dubstep, Electronic as you would almost expect with
	most of soundcloud being remixes so please remember this when it is giving you a dubstep
	remix of Justin Bieber when it's not what you want.

How it works:

	It works simply by getting the user provided details (Artist and Title) then it goes off
	to SoundCloud with this data viait
	then strips this page down using simple string manipulation to get the streamUrl value
	which is then used to download the song. After this, it will grab album art using
	(http://www.albumart.org/index.php?searchkey=ARTIST+TITLE) or 
	(http://www.albumart.org/index.php?searchkey=ARTIST) if the former provides empty.
	All that is left is to ID3 tag it all together using UltraID3Lib (mixed into the EXE).
