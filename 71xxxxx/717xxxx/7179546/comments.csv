,DiD.DrC,2012-04-12T11:14Z,"yes, i kno.. its 1080p bro..it sud be bigger in size.
Thats y m seeding @ 100 Mbps 24 x 7"
,hrs99,2012-04-12T21:11Z,1080p from DVD how??
,NikonSLR,2012-04-15T10:58Z,"@hrs99 it is possible to do 1080p files in less that 4/3GB, just look at YIFY's work. He's got 1080p files, some as small as 1.4 GB. 

@ DiD.DrC is the source for this movie Bluray? no disrespect but from looking at the screenshots it really looks like an upscaled DVD"
,Hammer1974,2012-04-17T18:11Z,1920x816 is not 1080p.
,NikonSLR,2012-04-17T18:50Z,"""1920x816 is not 1080p. "" the missing 264 vertical lines are the black bars at the top and bottom of the picture. 1920x1080p is a ration of 16:9 whereas a lot of movies are 2.35:1 hence you'll see alot of movies posted as 1080p with a resolution of 1920x816.

This particular movie is not HD, it's just an upscaled print. You are better off downloading the dvdrip which is a smaller file and is the same resolution and quality."
,hrs99,2012-04-17T20:44Z,"@NikonSLR i didn't asked about the size of the file..
I'm trying to know about... what u already said ""@ DiD.DrC is the source for this movie Bluray? no disrespect but from looking at the screenshots it really looks like an upscaled DVD"" because I too thought the same..
to the uploader the one u posted is gud... but it would even great if its from Blu ray source of 1080p movie  
thank u anyways"
,hrs99,2012-04-17T20:51Z,"@NikonSLR i didn't asked about the size of the movie file.. i wanted to know which was u already asked ""@ DiD.DrC is the source for this movie Bluray? no disrespect but from looking at the screenshots it really looks like an upscaled DVD"" because i too thought of the same..

To the uploader thank u for the movie its gud but it would be even great if its from blu ray source of 1080p.. i'll be more than happy if u post it again with a blu ray source.

Thank u anyways"
,Hammer1974,2012-04-17T21:43Z,"This is an upscale and not bluray rip. The only problem with this is the blacks are not blacks they are more of a blue.
Thank you to the uploader for the effort."
,DiD.DrC,2012-04-17T23:36Z,"i am really confused being asked about the source!
I clearly tagged the file as 1080p DVDRip..then where the bluray comes? bluray isn't out till now.

i know many of you won't like the rip, this is better an experimental one to upscale a DVD to 1080p. 1920x816 is a 1080p rip, only difference is the black borders are cut off, that's the reason of the lesser height of the frames.

anyways, thank you so much guys!"
,DiD.DrC,2012-04-17T23:42Z,"@ Hammer1974 :The only problem with this is the blacks are not blacks they are more of a blue.

Can't get u, can u pls explain a bit?"
,Hammer1974,2012-04-18T12:09Z,@DiD.Drc towards the end of the movie when the people are standing around rather than having black hair they have dark blue hair. 
,Hammer1974,2012-04-18T12:11Z,I have looked on bollywooddvds.com and there is no bluray for this movie only dvd.
,DiD.DrC,2012-04-28T16:04Z,"@Hammer1974 : The end portion of the film was shoot like that only. I haven't made any change in the color at any portion of the film.
And, of course this is DVD rip. I have told many a times."
[T],L3G3ND,2012-05-09T11:03Z,"dude
learn some ripping concepts.
DvD releases are 480p, you can't upscale them.
Only 1080p releases are on blu-ray and rescale rip to 720p.

1920x816 isnt 1080p
1920x1080 is 1080p


actualy you are giving people 480p movie in 4.37gb making it 1080p with black borders.

You can do a full dvdr release which is lossless release

and ur 100mbps seeding joke made me LOL ^_^"
,DiD.DrC,2012-05-09T16:17Z,"@L3G3ND : Bro pls, first know something then leave a comment, this noob-type behavior isn't expected from a ""Trusted"" uploader.

Anything and everything can be done from a DVD, of course if you know how to do that ;)"
[T],L3G3ND,2012-05-11T06:59Z,"well what are you argueing for is proving you an idiot.

Use google, read some tutorials and then after argue with me."
