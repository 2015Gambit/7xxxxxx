,dataswife,2012-04-09T06:28Z,Can someone confirm if this is the leaked version with no Dothraki subtitles or the proper one?
,Elmojio,2012-04-09T06:41Z,"Ok so I know you're totally legit b/c I've downloaded a lot of your torrents, but one question:  How do you get the entire episode when only half of it has aired?"

,Solidarnos,2012-04-09T07:53Z,"Unfortunately, this has the ""HBO GO"" emblem/sigil up in the right hand corner for the whole episode . . . I hate that!  Especially when an otherworldly piece like this-it takes me out of the world of it.

Thanks, though, eztv.  Will look for episode w/o emblem."
,LeadBrick,2012-04-09T08:05Z,"Excellent torrent, as usual EZTV! Thanks!

I'll seed @ max speed for a while, as I usually do."
,dataswife,2012-04-09T08:46Z,"Solidarnos, does it have subtitles for the Dothraki? he version leaked last week had the HBO GO in the corner and no subtitles... Is this the same file or a new one with subtitles?  "

,peterpark,2012-04-09T21:30Z,I wish people would stop writing comments about how they are currently downloading the file. Who the fuck cares if you're downloading the file? I just want to know if it's legitimate or not. And it is. Thank you!
,mberg86,2012-04-09T22:39Z,"buhu, poor man that don`t like what other people writing;("
,oyaba,2012-04-09T22:42Z,"@DrushDrush

yea it is but the other one didnt have dothraki subs"
,pxpierre,2012-04-10T01:14Z,"@ peterpark: indeed, some jerks saying that they are currently downloading with a never fulfilled promise of coming back for comment is surely the most useless post on the planet.

At least they don't mention jerking off or scratching their butt while waiting for the download to complete. :-)"
,BgWienR88,2012-04-10T08:20Z,"Great quality, thank you!
BUT PLEEAAASSSEE EPISODE 3 ALREADYYY!!

,spektator,2012-04-10T09:40Z,Somebody could write it is MP4.
,TugBot99,2012-04-10T10:14Z,"@ spektator

x264 is MP4, or otherwise known as.. H.264

So its listed in heading, as heading reads x264"
,henke_fff,2012-04-10T15:18Z,Does anyone know if the WEBrip S02E03 is coming out anytime soon or was that just a one time thing?
[H],Eppo,2012-04-10T17:32Z,"@henke_fff
untill the people at HBO screw something up again, it's a one time thing ;)"
,shaayned,2012-04-10T19:48Z,"It's legit, it's eztv. I have watched this and its so much better than the web leak, clearer image, no HBO logo in the corner and subtitles. Solidarnos is lying, i'm not sure why you would lie. Anyway 
A/10
V/10"
,henke_fff,2012-04-10T22:03Z,Thanks 3pp0 for the answer. I'll have to wait another week then :(
,spancer_87,2012-04-11T02:14Z,"I don't see  the use of this, when the webrip is the exact same. Give us ep. 03!"
,alexcin2085,2012-04-11T03:40Z,Did anyone see both of the s02e02? web-rip and this? is there a big difference? i just saw it again and is a good rip. Please somebody answer me. Thanks.
