[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-14T22:25Z,Tell me about it.
,scoutledaren,2012-04-17T19:36Z,"There is an additional fan-made episode on youtube that explains what happens next.

Otherwise, you should read the manga. It's truly epic!"
,Judirek,2012-04-19T07:08Z,Nice but is the movie 'Berserk Golden Age Arc I: Egg of the Supreme Ruler Included'?
,Judirek,2012-04-19T07:30Z,"@scoutledaren or anyone who is a fan but hasn't read 'Berserk' completely from the start up to the latest manga go here: [code]eatmanga.com[/code] use the search function since it uses google's search function it opens in another tab but the list is all from the site and is satisfactory cause of its completeness, it even has the prototype chapter the first launch though not official the prototype chapter is like a test run so don't take it as canon. The old anime didn't include some important storylines like the Black Dog Knights but it's still good. I hope in the latest movie trilogies they'll include such major events and continue making movies."
,FilthyAnimalNL,2012-04-20T11:08Z,"of course not. dvd won't release in japan till next month, then fans need to sub it. "

Oh cause of the cover so it's next month then waiting time is still far."
,scoutledaren,2012-05-22T10:30Z,"Judirek: Yes, there are several places to read the Berserk manga. I downloaded it from tpb."
,ReIVIeDy,2012-05-23T05:00Z,"@judirek: Why do the fans need to sub it? Why cant Japan offer dual-commentary so Americans can import it, so the company kills two birds with one stone: They avoid localization drama while still earning sales!

Why should it be the fans responsible to sub this? How hard would it be to bring in a decent American and have him add subtitles?"
,Judirek,2012-05-24T07:20Z,"It's May 24 now and the said DVD/Blu-Ray release date is on May 23rd I'm sure that some people bought it already, I too will buy it if I can to support them to continue making movies but I basically can't(I'm still 17) so any news on anyone working on uploading or subbing the movie?

@ReIVIeDy: If they just did what you just said then Berserk would've been famous internationally already and because of the budget maybe the movie would've avoid 3D CGI."
,FilthyAnimalNL,2012-05-24T10:16Z,"@judirek

It's a LITTLE misleading, yes.
Anyway it should be out now, hope it is getting subbed as I type.

,Judirek,2012-05-26T07:56Z,"Someone recently uploaded the movie: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7300129/Berserk_-_Golden_Age_Part_I_-_Egg_of_the_Supreme_Ruler but the thing is it's 19.2 gigs can someone upload a smaller size? Maybe below 2gigs for DVD and below 5gigs for Blu-Ray cause it would surely take a month or so for me to finish 19.2gigs, please help us slow internet connection people."
