Included are two complete translations of Plato's works. The Hackett release is the more generally accepted, modern translation so if you were to read only one, I would suggest the Hackett version. The Hackett version also does a better job to provide some context and background information of the discussions as well as great introductory material for an ideal perspective going in.

Plato's writing style left a significant amount room for interpretation partially due to his artistic expression and his ever evolving philosophy that left many inconsistencies between his books which is why I have included the Jowlett translation so you can decide for yourself what he intended.
