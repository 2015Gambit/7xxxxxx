However, the Hackett version is an ""empty"" file (zeros).  The Jowett version (not ""Jowlett"" as spelled here; scanning error?) seems OK at first sight. 
Please fix."
,nuneral,2012-04-15T05:54Z,"I've tried repeatedly to fix this error. I am not not entirely what has occurred here. Both files worked perfectly when I uploaded them and I actually had two working Hackett versions that seemed to corrupt just a few minutes apart from one another. I have working copies of both of the files uploaded on my phone but for some bizarre reason I cannot transfer these from my phone back to my computer. Which is something I have never seen with any of my devices with non-critical files.

I have actually uploaded these files on two different torrents knowing the first was botched and I thought I had gotten out good copies on the second and stopped seeding as to not mess it up. I was mistaken.

I can't even seem to delete these torrent listings, as I have tried multiple times.

So it appears this torrent isn't so great and I apologize for any wasted bandwidth. "
