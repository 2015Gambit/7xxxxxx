Doco-UK-BBC-MindShock=Transplanting-Memories-Cellular-Memories-The Heart Is Not A Stone_Aug2010_,webrip.xvid.FixedVideo avi

I ripped this from a multipart web stream.. joined all parts
and fixed the aspect and cropped to full screens and
res-synced the sound as best I could and lastely sharpened it
sadly its the only source of this great doco around
the bitrate was low quality and pixel range but is watchable on full screen 1200x800 laptop
or smaller using VLC espc if use the VLC sharpener :)

Whats it about?
well its about transplanted hearts maybe have memories from its donor
and they may of discovered the heart might have its own neurons
and can have its own memories and maybe the brain doesnt control
the heart but they communicate and share information
interviews with 3 patients and surgeons .. 
so may call this fringe science or heretics.. but what do they know :)

a must watch doco if never seen it..

HELP TO SEED if grabbing

enjoy

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
===================================
Ps/3 , phone and xbox users may consider grabbing
the free tool umile encoder 3.1.1.2 it can convert
to most devices to make compatible in 8mins
on dual core or higher. as some of my converts may
fail for certain devices.. you will need a pc to run it
though. no link just google it..
