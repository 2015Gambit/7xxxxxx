This is a high quality rip of every Nirvana album I own. I consider it to contain everything worth having. All tracks ripped in high quality FLAC format; contains logs. Only one track from Bleach was deemed an inaccurate rip; however it plays fine for me.

There are a couple of albums missing that I quite simply don't have. The EP's aren't there, neither is the single disc variation of With the Lights Out (branded as "Sliver: The Best of the Box"). Also missing the Icon release, and the singles albums- but from what I'm aware they're nothing more than re-releases of tracks already included here.
