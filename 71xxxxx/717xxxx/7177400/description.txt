DESCRIPTION:

The book is a bit of an old book so I wasn't to keen on posting it  but ah well, 
this book was banned in America in the 70s it includes advice on such topics as growing cannabis, 
starting a pirate radio station, living in a commune, stealing food, shoplifting, stealing credit cards, 
preparing a legal defence, making pipe bombs, and obtaining a free buffalo from the Department of the Interior. 
It discusses various tactics of fighting as well as giving a detailed list of affordable and easy ways to find weapons 
and armor that can be used in the event of a confrontation with law enforcement. 
The book advocates rebelling against authority in all forms, governmental and corporate.
