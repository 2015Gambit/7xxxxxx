,RexRexroth,2012-09-05T07:08Z,"As much as I love this set and am very happy with the quality of the recordings, I hate the fact that Decca didn’t get a bit more creative in the distribution of the nine symphonies and four orchestral works over six CDs.  Two of the symphonies are broken midway through and split between two discs.  So if you want to hear Symphony Nr. 5, for instance, you have to get up and change the CD in the middle of the work.

I have worked out a way to get all nine symphonies and the four orchestral works onto six CDs without interrupting any of the pieces of music.

First, just delete the big CUE file for each CD.  Then convert the individual .cue tracks to .wav files by decompressing them with Monkey’s Audio (a simple to use free download; find it on Google).

It will take you a little while to juggle things around and renumber all the individual movements, but it works out perfectly like this:

CD 1:
Symphony Nr. 1
""My Home""
""Scherzo Capriccioso""

CD 2:
Symphony Nr. 2
""In Nature’s Realm""
""Carnival Overture""

CD 3:
Symphony Nr. 3
Symphony Nr, 4

CD 4:
Symphony Nr. 5
Symphony Nr. 7

CD 5:
Symphony Nr. 6

CD 6:
Symphony Nr. 8
Symphony Nr. 9

You can play around with the four symphonic works and place them elsewhere as you like and still come in with a CD of under 79 minutes.  I just found this to be the easiest configuration.

Use Ashampoo to burn to CD and you are set!"
