video:9
audio: -1,000"
,pplRdumb,2012-04-10T16:26Z,not sure what psynaut00 is talking about. must be a dumb troll. the video AND audio are both 10/10 per usual.
,wenex,2012-04-11T04:13Z,"audio is perfect. since the switch from avi, sound and video has gotten nothing but better. Thanks tons for the great up."
,Psynaut00,2012-04-11T06:30Z,"Not trolling @pplrdumb, I downloaded it twice and tried to play it in vlc and it was all static, barely audible for me.  Don't know why mileage is varying.  But if it works for you that's great."
,jnstyy,2012-04-14T04:32Z,"i have also been experiencing audio / video problems with the new formatting. i downloaded a different video player and it seemed to work better. though i would prefer the older AVI format and to play it with VLC... either way, thanks EZTV for everything."
