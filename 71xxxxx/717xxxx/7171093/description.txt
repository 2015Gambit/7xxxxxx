Program Tilt-Shift Generator emulates the effect of selective focusing accessible to users of professional lenses with functions of rotation (an inclination of a lens concerning an optical axis) and shift. Users Tilt-Shift Generator can create photos with effect of a photo-miniature and create pictures in style pseudo-makro. Speaking easier, Tilt-Shift Generator creates miniature, "toy" photos from any picture.
