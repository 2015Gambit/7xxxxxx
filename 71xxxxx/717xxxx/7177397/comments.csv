(I made both samples 1080p & 720p and decided it is not worth making it 1080p)
Any way since the quality difference is not much here it goes as it is.
The blu-ray's picture quality is not that great either (read @ bluray.com).
See the difference:
Blu-ray.com vs HighCode

Yes, it is more light in encode but even the small details are all kept."
