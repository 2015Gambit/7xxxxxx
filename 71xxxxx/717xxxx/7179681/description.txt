salling clicker 3.5 is a re-upload of an old torrent. i managed to download it before the seeders quit( formatted hdd). for those of you who werent fortunate enough heres your chance. tested on snow leopard and nokia n85. works pretty well. 
    you can choose to connect using bluetooth or wi-fi. the app installs in your system preferences. the app contains a list of supported phone models.. models added after the release can be downloaded from within the app.
    copy the registration info provided.. and enter it in the "about" pane. ENJOY.. THANK THE ORIGINAL UPLOADER IF YOU LIKE THIS SOFTWARE.. and of course the makers of this fabulous software.
