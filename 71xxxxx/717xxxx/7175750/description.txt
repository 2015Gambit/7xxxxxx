Special Features:
    - To reduce file size, all episodes have the beginnings and endings   
      removed, except for the episodes they first appear in (for example, 
      opening 2 first appears in episode 48, so episode 48 still has the 
      opening in it)

    - All episodes have been compressed to around 100MB, with minimal quality  
      reduction (note that the show wasnΓÇÖt broadcast in HD until episode   
      207)

    - All episodes/movies/ovas etc. are divided up by saga and arc and are 
      placed in approximate order. You can also access all 
      movies/ovas/specials through shortcuts in separate folders

    - All Episodes are labeled by number and episode title

    - All Fillers/Specials/Recaps are labeled as such
