Hillary: The Movie is a 2008 politicized documentary about (then) United States Senator and Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. It was produced by Citizens United. The film was scheduled to be offered as video-on-demand on cable TV right before the Democratic primaries in January 2008, but the federal government blocked it. The blocking of the film's airing was the subject of the court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. The Supreme Court struck down those provisions of BCRA that prohibited corporations (including nonprofit corporations) and unions from spending on "electioneering communications".
