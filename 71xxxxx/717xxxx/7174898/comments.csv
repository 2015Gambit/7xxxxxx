,stumpalump,2012-06-03T21:37Z,"Yes, I agree. Amazing documentary too bad quality is so bad. Ripped from Asian source with hard Asian subs also. "
,ohmangekyo,2012-07-10T12:43Z,I hope you all realize this is not real... Cause the uploader doesn't seem to.
,FBIOBSERVER,2012-08-06T20:08Z,"rather than seeing the real mermaid,i would love to fuk up these whoreson actors"
,rbr123123,2012-08-13T00:11Z,"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE (and i'm not picky).
Yes, I realize it is the only one but that doesn't change the rating.

-Has awful video quality on every level (pixels, blurry, dark..etc)
-Has extremely bad audio (low, muffled, sounds like it's underwater)
-Has really annoying asian subtitles at the bottom in a huge font.

Don't watch it on a TV, use your laptop or phone or iPod or something smaller or else it's not watchable"

,McSpifffy,2012-08-31T07:41Z,"Well I found A place that has the whole animal planet version which has some bit cut out from the airing of the same thing on discovery channel and its in HD so here it is cause i do not have time to keep my torrent up and running.

The rapidshare seems to be the fastest ^_^"
