SEASON 8 EPISODE 12 - Aleishe

Aleishe is a pastry chef who has always struggled with feeling beautiful. She now works in one of New York's finest restaurants, but despite her accomplishments she still suffers from low self-esteem. In addition, she can't help herself from comparing herself to others and putting herself down -- a pretty crappy way to spend her energy. Can Stacy and Clinton help Aleishe re-route her behavior so that she can see her true beauty?
