This is my first experience with a Monster Music Superdisc.  Monster Music is a division of Monster Cable, Noel LeeΓÇÖs hugely successful accessory manufacturer.  The disc is a DVD video that also has digital music files for an iPod or computer.  Unlike many of the DualDiscs, it does not offer a DVD-A trackΓÇôstrictly DD or DTS.  Although the sound was very good, it could not equal the quality of the superior format.  3 Doors Down puts on a good show liveΓÇômuch like a Matchbox 20 concert.  The concert includes their big hits and a good mix of rock tunes both new and old.  The production is huge with lasers, pyrotechnics, fog, lights, and a large screen behind the stage.  The music is good if you like the alternative rock flavor of the band (see my review of the SACD for more on the music).  I was hoping the Behind the Scenes in the extras would have a lot of information about the concert, but it was mostly an advertisement for Monster Music and their new Superdisc.  All in all itΓÇÖs a good show and sound and looks are good.

Camerawork on this disc consists of rapid cuts that vary in length from a few seconds to a split second.  The video is HD, so it appears grainy in dark scenes, but clean in lit scenes with a soft haze over the entire image (as seen at many concerts).  As for the audio, I found the stage mix sounded much better and louder than the audience mix.  Vocals and instruments are much clearer and crowd noise was still audible.  The focus was shifted more to the front in a good way.  The On Stage mix comes both in DTS and DD.  I preferred the DDΓÇôthe voice sounded more realistic even though the DTS may have an edge on the top end.
