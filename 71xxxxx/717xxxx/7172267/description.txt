The two American sweethearts Georgie and David travel to Spain seeking the wedding blessing of David's estranged and criminal father. Invited to stay at his palatial villa, they find themselves entering a world of wealth and danger beyond their wildest dreams. 

When David's father is away on 'business' they head out for a night on the town where they meet seedy nightclub manager Marlon. He offers his new friends the VIP treatment, providing champagne and drugs. Caught up in the hedonistic atmosphere, David leaves Georgie alone for a moment. When he returns, she has vanished without trace, or a single witness. Now David must wade through corrupt local officials, drug dealers and crazy locals to find her, but is he ready to discover the truth?

PLEASE NOTE: This movie only has English language. Upon request I will upload and seed German audio files (also AC-3), 2 and/or 6 channels, that people can then mux with the rest of the movie themselves. (Alternatively, I can do the muxing if people are insecure on how to do so..)
