,barry1029,2012-04-19T11:40Z,"Do you have the new Set for 6 at quality like this was, I'm always fine with a bigger size as long as the quality shows"

,BatEngland94,2012-07-20T08:36Z,"Good torrent. For the rest of season 6 go to this torrent - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7192818/Naruto_Shippuden_Eng_Dub_127-140
It's good quality as far as i know. Will continue to seed this torrent for a while :)"
,OmegaRay,2012-07-30T06:06Z,Hows The Quality And The Resolution Guyz?
,eightyth_attempt2register,2012-08-04T06:03Z,Same problem as two other torrents.  THis one has nasty watermarks on every episode advertising a website.  Ruins enjoyment of the show.  So far I can't find any watchable season 6 episodes.
,edwardgrieg,2012-08-07T00:21Z,SEED PLEASE.
