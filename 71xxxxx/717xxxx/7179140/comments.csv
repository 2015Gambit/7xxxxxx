,evilchadercheez,2012-04-13T05:34Z,"hey maverick, you are a dumbass.  the whole point of these xvid/avi rips is so people don't have to watch these shows on their computer and can instead stream them to their tv through an xbox (the way i do).  unfortunately, the xbox does not natively support x264, hence the need for an xvid/avi.  you clearly don't know what the hell you're talking about.  thanks for the rip ettv!"

Maverick, you are obviously not aware of what a lot of other folks are able to do.
I do not watch on a pc.
What I do is copy avi to a dvd r/w and play on my divx dvd players, that is the only format they support, other than converting to a vob format.
Or should I just try and please you by throwing out my existing equipment and buying new.
Not until there is no other choice.
Some people prefer to put there hard earned dollars into more important things, like rent, food etc."
