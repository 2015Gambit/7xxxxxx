,rizzo777,2012-04-25T10:25Z,this is not working for me mate burnt is twice any ideas pal
,HorseCrapCoffee,2012-04-26T19:01Z,"If you are not using IMGburn, use it. You need DVD+(Has to be +)R-DL discs, preferablt verbatim. And if you aren't, run it through abgx360, create the IMG file, and burn that with IMGburn at 2.4 or 3x speed (preferably 2.4). Other than that, sorry mate, your on your own. It worked for me. Plz get back to me with results and i will try to fix it if dosen't work"
,rizzo777,2012-04-27T13:26Z,nice one mate got it sorted its working fine i was burning with xbox backup burnt with imgburn and it works fine great work by the way pal good stuff cheers

,HorseCrapCoffee,2012-05-01T20:18Z,"Rizzo-Correct! You Have Won A new Torrent For Your Team! Post A Comment And Tell Me What You Want. Movies, Games, Music...

,civicboy420,2012-05-25T01:14Z,"Ok I just burned this game for the mods, I have LT 3.0, I can't for the life of me find the mods. There not in the pause menu, It's just a regular copy of Dead Island. So I have two now, waste of a disk."
,HorseCrapCoffee,2012-05-26T14:26Z,"Civicboy420-No there's a menu in the game menu at the bottom, called developers menu or something like that. Just explore it yourself and you will find out how to use it, it takes too long to explain everything. Just type 'dead island mods menu' into youtube"
,civicboy420,2012-05-27T23:41Z,"Thanks HorseCrapCoffee, I found the menu, The problem was I had had to copy my original save to usb then delete original off hard drive. The Development menu is the shit!! FN one punch kills and God Mode!! Thanks for the upload and I take back my last comment about the wasted disk. Thanks Man :)"
