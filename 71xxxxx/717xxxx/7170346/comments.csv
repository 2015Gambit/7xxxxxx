Video quality isn't very good and a segment after the first commercial break is missing. This last item is not due to the uploader, rather the Nick site is missing that segment which explains the shorter running time of 17 minutes. This episode is available on the KFP2 dvd and blu-ray. Hopefully a better version of this ep and further eps will be forthcoming."
