,lsmulders,2012-04-10T23:22Z,Keygen contains Trojan (says McAfee).
,keywest33,2012-04-11T10:13Z,"McAfee will always say that a ""keygen"" is a ""virus as will ""some other"" a/vs(ignore)"
,MirrodinX4,2012-04-12T23:22Z,Malwarebytes also detects a infection in the keygen but it's called: Dont.Steal.Our.Software so it's probably not a real virus but they see it's a keygen for their own program.
,emanater,2012-04-13T21:09Z,Its not a trojan. Antiviruses always detect key generators as viruses although its not. So dont worry and just download it :)
,Madlisbon,2012-04-22T20:52Z," All antivirus or almost all^^,are made to detect keygens."
,OmegaWorm,2012-05-27T12:34Z,"malwarebytes' anti-malwarev1.61.0.1400 final multiliang  fff  woot.exe 

Picked up as w32/trojan2.nnlr


Woot.exe?  -____- seems shady"
,lindenkron,2012-06-13T15:34Z,"I'm surprised no one bothered to comment on whether or not it actually works.

It worked. You can download the real Malwarebytes from the original website. Then download this, open the w00t.exe, and copy paste the information in the ""product id"".

Hope you guys keep your PCs safe. Stuff like this should be provided by Microsoft for free, for using their flawed and insecure operating system.

Sorry Malwarebytes.
Best regards,

Also ""for using their flawed and insecure operating system."" Freedom comes with a price you can do anything you want and things that  any mac or linux can but with things that only PC's can as well."

Sounds like the problem is not in the computer."
