,predux,2012-04-13T06:05Z,"Take this down you assholes. The album is fucking 5 dollars. If you don't have 5 dollars to spend on a quality album like this, how do you afford internet? Hoodie worked so hard on this and he's barely making any profit. You're all disrespectful assholes. I can see pirating other shit, but this is one of the only artists who have stayed true throughout the years. Don't be a dick. Pay for the album."
