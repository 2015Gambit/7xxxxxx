About the album.-
Composed, edited and mastered by Moisés Gómez symbolized a change of life exemplified in who watches a TV program and can not do anything to avoid what is happening on the screen slowly leading him to insanity, hence the name. 
It tells the story of a man who believed to have a complete and systematic life with a woman, until the relation breaks, the entrance of a third man splits the opportunities and the protagonist falls into depression who struggles to reach acceptance and move on. Based on a real life experience of one of us, the production of this work took 2 years, because honestly, we didn't had the money to produce it.

Hear the explosive musical work of a mind with something to say and, by this way, let out the experience that changed his life. 53 minutes of progressive rock created to hit your face, mind and ears in a sound that combines virtuosity, feel and power!  

Why didn't we sell it?.-

Well because it is a honest work, not a work for make money, if you want to pay for it, great, but in the mean time we will not charge for it because the idea is to see you, in front of us and jump with the power of music. Cheers!
