"Get Your Business Done"

When the Hecks attend a new church, 
Frankie is inspired by the pastor's sermon 
about getting one's business in life 
completed before death rears its ugly 
head. So she makes it her mission to 
ensure that her family puts it into 
practice. To that end, Mike wants to thank 
his dad for being there for him and his 
brother after their mom died, Sue starts 
up her own baby-sitting service, and Brick 
thinks a new bed will meet the 
requirement, while Axl believes that 
helping Brick get his new bed will fulfill 
his. But Frankie finds it difficult to 
figure out what it is that she should be 
doing to fulfill her own life's destiny.
