,MasterCain,2012-04-11T21:23Z,Thanks for this. I'll be able to play it while I wait for my import to arrive. Xenoblade took over two months to get to me. Fuck waiting. 
,omegaviper,2012-04-12T05:55Z,@MasterCain if you have a modded wii and download games why do you bother buying games?
,GuessMyUserName,2012-04-12T15:39Z,"@omegaviper Uh, to support the game developers? Especially when it comes to games that rarely get published because their sales are so low like this game."
,Rexeus,2012-04-12T17:26Z,thanx.
,matt1tude,2012-04-12T22:34Z,"Thanks for this, been looking forward to it since it was announced to get a UK release. At 75% currently but not many seeders compared to leechers so its going a tad slow now.

I will be seeding this for as awhile.

@MasterCain I'm with you on this one mate, games like these very rarely get a release outside of japan. If we want more games like the superb Xenoblade, Last Story and this we need to go out and buy them to show support to the developers to show them there is a market for games like these to release to in the future."
,matt1tude,2012-04-12T23:42Z,Meant to say @GuessMyUserName in post above.
,charly_corr,2012-04-13T04:34Z,"Thanks, but i will wait for the Undub Version. This one is only in English(British) Audio and i like the Japanese Voices :("
,RegginRellik,2012-04-14T12:31Z,works on dolphin?
,Sinister181,2012-04-20T11:41Z,"I wish that someone would upload the .wbfs version of this game, so that we'll only have to download 2Gb instead of 4.34Gb. If someone did that, I would really appreciate it."
,wunray,2012-04-21T06:39Z,Can this be put on a Flash Drive?
,I-Fatman,2012-05-01T15:25Z,"I am having trouble playing this....

First game that isn't working. 

I have all the latest updates and a PAL Wii. What's the problem?"
,I-Fatman,2012-05-02T10:57Z,"When I try to load it, it just goes black screen and the Wiimote stops responding."
,I-Fatman,2012-05-04T12:56Z,"Wherever I go I get NO help.
The Last Story works great. This game uses the same IOS. Why is it that only I have problem with this shit..... Want to play this real bad."
,asianluffy,2012-05-17T21:52Z,"@I-Fatman depends what loader you use sometimes, some games do not work on wiiflow for me i use uloader. well im going to download this and try on wiiflow, and uloader and say if this works"
,xiyd_zack,2012-05-23T03:15Z,"this works great!!, you just need to update your cios using d2x Cios, this is the link to the installation guide http://www.wiihacks.com/other-faq-guides-tutorials/88654-d2x-cios-installation-guide.html"
,iamchrislechat,2012-05-27T02:01Z,"just finished playing this great (however flawed) game
i recommend CFGusb loader and grab the latest IOS or WII hacking tutorial from http://gwht.wikidot.com/"
,Keithuk,2012-05-27T19:43Z,It plays ok for me on a 4.3 with USB Loader GX.
,thenaughtons,2012-06-06T23:36Z,"thank you so much!

works perfectly off hhd on 4.3E and USB loaderGX

Potent graphics for a Wii game, excellent gameplay and great anime story. not for the young ones though."
