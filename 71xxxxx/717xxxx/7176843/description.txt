Here is a college of desktop wallpaper I use.  It is separated into two folders one for day and one for night.  If you're like me you don't like bright wallpaper at night.  Switch between the two depending on the time of day it is.  They are all high quality and in good taste with lots of different settings, mostly scenic, skylines, some astronomy, and lots of nature etc.
