I have a favour to ask (don't I always?). We all love you and you know that, because you listen to what the people want (fishcat for president?). so, since we all love our drag-queens and rupaul and we want to DEVOUR every single video we can find them on ,I'm here to ask that you upload the NEWNOWNEXT awards 2012 that were broadcast right after rupauls drag race on monday. Thank you in advance and we will be waiting :)"
