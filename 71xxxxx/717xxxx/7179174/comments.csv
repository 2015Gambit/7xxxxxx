,pangit55,2012-04-12T12:13Z,"Could somebody explain why I'm having problems with all these downloads advertising ""speed.cd""? 

Invariably, I wind up with no connections to seeders, only to leechers. Right now, for example, I have a download speed of 5 kbps and an upload speed of 250 kbps. 

If I stick with the torrent (as I have in the past), that upload speed can get up to 2-3 mbps but the download speed will continue to poke along.  I suspect the reason is that I'm on a private tracker and since I'm not a member, I'm blocked from doing anything but poking along the edges of the swarm. Can anybody confirm that or give me a better explanation?  Thanks."
