,HelloMynameisV,2012-04-11T01:55Z,John Carter is hands down one of the dumbest movies ever made! Even if this was a DVD copy i suggest avoiding this crap of a movie that has no real point and a story line that is all over the place with out any real explanation! It's just D U M B ! 
,megz2608,2012-04-11T08:38Z,If we can get every one who downloads this to send Disney a Penny then they might get bak some of the squillions that this movie as spunked all ovfer the screen.
