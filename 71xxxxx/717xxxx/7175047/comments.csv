[V],Nepotu,2012-04-10T23:35Z,You're welcome my dear friend! I will up entire this series.
[V],Nepotu,2012-04-11T12:05Z,"After download please seed! If you don't do that I'll no up other older games. These rare things survive by seeding. If you all are only leechers, why I should do this work anymore?"
,ivo1978,2012-04-11T13:24Z,"I will be able to download just in friday, but I'm going to seed this one! I'm sorry but I have limited HDD space and can't seed everithing that I want! I think I still seed much of 70's games plus some other old stuff. 
Thank you Nepotu and much appreciation from me!!!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-04-12T15:15Z,"It's not about you ivo1978. I know you are one of the good guys. I have the same problem with the HDD space and for this reason I need a little help. Unfortunately, 80-90% of leechers are selfishes."
