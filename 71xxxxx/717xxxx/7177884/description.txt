Plot: The film begins in 1971 with Craig Gilbert (James Gandolfini) discussing with Pat Loud (Diane Lane) the idea of a documentary series that would concern her family’s day to day lives. Pat considers the proposal and accepts, amidst her son Lance (Thomas Dekker) moving to New York City. Pat’s husband Bill (Tim Robbins) travels often away on business, leaving his wife alone to care for their five children. The crew (Patrick Fugit, Shanna Collins) moves in with the Louds and begins to document them. Relations between Pat and Bill grow frayed due to his time away and the stress of the TV show’s production. Craig tells Pat of his suspicions surrounding Bill’s trips away, giving fairly strong evidence that he is cheating on her. The crew fights with Gilbert about his documentary technique, as he makes them film many personal moments. After surreptitiously duplicating the keys to Bill’s office, Pat makes a late night trip to the office and discovers documents that confirm he is cheating on Pat with two other women, resulting in Pat’s preparations to file for a divorce. Angry, she tells Gilbert to have cameras there when she tells Bill, wanting “his bimbos to see it, the whole world to see it.” Against her wishes, he films Pat’s conversation with her brother and his wife.
