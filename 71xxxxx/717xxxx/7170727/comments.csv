,whmxtra,2012-04-09T10:00Z,"ok I'm done with all you guys not seeding right, I'm sick of uploading at 1 MPBS just to get a 1.2 kbps download speed, so as of now my upload speed is set to 1 kbps. No longer will I upload 25+ gigs just to download a 550 meg file that I don't even watch (I only download it for my kids)

This is the only torrent in over a decade that I have had issues with and it's all because you all aren't seeding properly. So no longer will I waste bandwidth spending 10 hours downloading 1 bloody file while uploading 100 times more than I download.

maybe in future you guys will learn to seed fairly then I will be happy to throw away my bandwidth to help seed these torrents but atm I'm done with seeding these for now, if nobody else is going to neither am I. 

So I'll take the crappy 1.2 kbps download (compared to 3 MPBS for other torrents I download from here) and I'll upload at 1.2kbps just like the rest of you. And then we can all spend a week trying to get this one file."

thank you"
,marktoal,2012-04-09T11:25Z,"Nice to see you back dude.
My kids were driving me nuts for these. You's guys are legends. Do you know how hard these are to get. Just a pity every1 hits and runs."
,marktoal,2012-04-09T11:51Z,Uploading at 2.5mb put only getting 1-10kbs download back. Come on peeps. Seed.
[T],burgundyranger,2012-04-09T14:48Z,I'm not an expert on all the ins/outs of seeding but could some of the early seeding issues be because I'm on a relatively slow DSL connection? I use Vuze and my top upload speed hardly ever tops 75 kB/second.
,whmxtra,2012-04-09T21:28Z,"Ranger it's not you that's the problem, it's all the ppl that hit and run and don't do their fair share to seed, so those of us that do the right thing and seed end up carring the torrent for everyone. 

When I tried last night there were 20 seeders, and not 1 of them (aside from you) were actually seeding properly. So while I was uploading at 1 meg/second I was only getting 1.2 kbps download, which week after week means I upload 20-30 gigs just to download the file, and other ppl have the same problem.

19 other ppl who should have been seeding that torrent last night weren't, which ticks me off because I do more than my fair share of uploading here and the whole concept of torrents is to share the load, and when other ppl don't share it sucks for everyone.

Now today I see ppl are seeding, so I've downloaded it at 1.5 megs/second and I'll leave it seed to a ratio of 10 happily."
