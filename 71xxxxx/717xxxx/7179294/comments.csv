Cheers!"
[T],MrDowntown,2012-04-12T16:43Z,Doesnt look like anyone scanned it yet - but when they do I will upload. Compared to the DC/Marvel comics - we're lucky if anyone even scans these and if/when they do its rarely on release day - practice patience.
,PiggyV01,2012-04-13T02:21Z,"Hello, i understand that, i'm not being impatient. It was Cobra #12 that was released this week, i was inquiring about #11 which came out March 28. I guess if it's not been scanned yet, it probably won't be. Thanks."
[T],MrDowntown,2012-04-13T04:45Z,"Sorry piggyv01, didnt mean to sound snippy. The person(s) who scan the GI JOE titles, at least the last few months, seem to do so out of order. If you look at which issues Ive uploaded when - youll see what I mean. Im sure it'll pop up soon - Im still searching - and then it'll be up asap"
,PiggyV01,2012-04-13T07:42Z,"No worries, thanks a lot for all your uploads."
