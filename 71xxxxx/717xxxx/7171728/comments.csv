,Carjacker,2012-04-17T15:06Z,"Audio//Video is garbage. Hard coded Vietnamese subs,choppy,grainy video- audio is OK. Too much bad encoding and compression loss. Also, having Vietnamese ad banners rolling across the top of the screen is truly annoying.
Definitely watchable,but I wouldn't want to save or burn this to disc- more like a disposable movie.
Video=6
Audio=8"
