avast! Internet Security is a powerful security suite from the same developers of avast! Antivirus.

The all-new avast! Internet Security 6 includes a bunch of interesting new features, like the eight powerful real-time shields to protect your web browsing, email, P2P and IM activities and more.

In avast! Internet Security youΓÇÖll also get to try the new Web Reputation plug-in for Internet Explorer and Firefox, which tests the reliability of the websites you visit; the AutoSandbox, to test suspicious programs; and the SafeZone, a special area for sensitive online transactions.
The firewall module included in avast! Internet Security detects network connections automatically, and lets you assign different security protocols to them according to their potential risk.
The interface in avast! Internet Security hasnΓÇÖt changed much. The design is basically the same, only bigger ΓÇô something that may not be that comfortable for some users. In any case, if youΓÇÖd like to try it out, remember itΓÇÖs still at a beta stage, so donΓÇÖt use it as your only security tool.
avast! Internet Security helps you protect your computer from spyware, phishing, spam and other potential threats.
