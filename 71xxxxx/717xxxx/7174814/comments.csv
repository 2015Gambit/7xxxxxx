@TIMETHIF

,tr99tr,2012-04-21T23:36Z,timethief has this also got the nag screen about this being a illegal copy of avast like all the rest have i need to find a copy of avast that works
,tr99tr,2012-04-23T12:48Z,no need for you to come from under your blackberry bush and reply. ive changed to avg now much better
,morph3x,2012-04-27T12:07Z,"avg is trash, avast is way better and always was."
,jcj001,2012-04-27T18:35Z,"excellent, thank you very much!"
,tr99tr,2012-04-30T20:29Z,avast may have a better ui. but avg consistently gets better rating for virus detection. fact.
,titoink,2012-05-07T11:29Z,"I installed, this and when i restart the computer guess what!! BLUE SCREEN OF DEAD!! crap!! i won't let me log in...am so piss!! right now am in safe mode...i'll restart in normal mode to see if everything goes back to normal!! FFFFK!!!!!"
,neverfindme,2012-05-12T09:21Z,OMG Guyz! First look on to its version after installing! This is the older version of Avast! Version 6.0.1289! Not version 7! Go download  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7092625/avast__Internet_Security_v7.0.1407_Incl._Key_[ThumperDC] and use the key from http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7193574/Current_Avast_Keys_Good_Until_2013
,dsacxzasd,2012-05-21T01:31Z,http://www.multiupload.nl/NGOGA44QQ1 Patch still working ( patch for 7.1 internet sec)
,Johnny5PR,2012-05-31T16:36Z,"To stop the warning issue:
Open the firewall, go to the application rules section and block all connections of avast antivirus. Then, open community tab in the settings menu and uncheck all.
Hope it works for you like it does for me... "
,CrazyAaron84,2012-06-15T18:09Z,"lol @ people trying to compare avg and avast... the both are so similar in detection its pointless, and of course any website would you could visit would be biased to say one had a noticably higher detection rate than the other. every site ive been on has always had them less than 2% detection rate difference. just avast is more built for web surfing and torrent/p2p downloading...

anyways, if detection rate is the only thing you are worried about why dont you just go use nod32 or something?"
,CrazyAaron84,2012-06-15T18:11Z,@tr99tr who said avast has a better ui? every complaint ive seen about avast has always been that its ui was was more confusing than avg
