,LatencyXXX,2012-04-12T21:35Z,I can tell you right now your idiots for packaging in .rar files still.  What do you live in the dark ages?  This same rip I found off another site earlier in the week.  I'm repackaging it so we can seed and watch.  Keep that in mind!
,babybluetits24,2012-04-20T19:56Z,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ax_Men_episodes  when is s05e14 due to air in usa ? and when will it be on tpb ? thanks sceneline

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 6 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
