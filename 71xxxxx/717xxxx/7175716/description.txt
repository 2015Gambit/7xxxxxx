Don't worry I got all 4 volumes and will get them all up shortly. I seen there was only like one reference to a video of this online (incomplete and mislabeled) and wouldn't ya know it i bought these 4 discs in the "unwanted" dvd bin at the local dollar store. (Dunno what everyones hating that bin for, 4 disc set $4, I've found 2 Yugiohs and a Bakugan in that bin so far also) They are converted using H264 MP4. Don't be expecting HD on large tv, they weren't made for that.Help seed and I can get the other ones up faster.
