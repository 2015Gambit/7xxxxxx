DESCRIPTION:

There are probably two types of people who are going to read this book: students and teachers.

On one hand, you have the lackluster scholastic endeavorer who knows his stuff. No, not his academic stuffΓÇöhis own stuff. 
He knows that he will be too lazy to get around to an assignment every now and then and that when 
that life-threatening moment arrives, he'll have The Cheater's Handbook in hand to make sure he's doing 
his corner-cutting right, to make sure that he is indeed taking the shortest path from Point F to Point A. 
(The expected societal analysis about why he feels the need to accomplish this can be found in the final chapter.)

Yes, The Cheater's Handbook will be the one book in his life that he ever does study.

On the other hand, you have the teachers, who would want to take a look at this, if only just to keep them updated 
what a student can accomplish by going through this excellent piece of prose.

All in all a great read and very well written, humorous and informative book. A MUST READ!
