Back in '72, I was in the college dorm listening to Elton John when into my room stormed a guy from across the hall shouting, "Turn off that fag music and listen to some real rock and roll. Here! Put this on." He handed me a copy of Smokin O.P.'s and I got my first introduction to Bob Seger. A couple of years later Seger broke big with the Live Bullet album and he became a rock mainstay. 

While this may not be a complete discography, it's pretty damn close. It also includes songs on Greatest Hits albums that didn't appear on other albums.

Presented in Apple Lossless. All tracks were converted using XLD for those of us who use iTunes on Apple products. It is true lossless so you are getting the best.

Enjoy!
