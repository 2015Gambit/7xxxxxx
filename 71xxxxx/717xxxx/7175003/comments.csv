You might need the title update to go along with these maps. Title Update 13.

Get it here: http://marketplace.jqe360.com/getfile.php?file=44827

and put this into:

Content/000000000000000/415608CB/000B000"
,kyocasey,2012-04-13T23:19Z,"Correction:

there is an extra 0 on the end of that, so it would be

Content/000000000000000/415608CB/000B0000"
