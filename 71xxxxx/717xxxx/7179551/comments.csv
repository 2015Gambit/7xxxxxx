,xxDeepThinkerxx,2012-04-27T16:37Z,"To Install .APK files

1. Download ""Astro"" off of android market

2. You must transfer .apk file to your memory card/sd card either via 'PC to memery card' or download off of android market. Just Create a new folder on your memory card for your new apps and drag and drop...

3. Put memory card back in your phone.

4.Open ""Astro"", then scroll until you see your folder you created (with .apk file inside). 

*Astro picks up all files and folders on your Android phone.

5. Click the application you want installed. Astro will give you the option to install. Click, Install and Bame! Your all done!

Thanks, XxDeepThinkerxX"
