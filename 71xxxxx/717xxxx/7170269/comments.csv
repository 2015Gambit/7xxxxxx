,Gleeze1,2012-04-12T18:48Z,"if you are getting a d3dx9_26.dll is missing error, then you simply need to install direct x to your computer from here:

when it is installed to your computer the game will work"
,art-castle.biz,2012-04-15T11:19Z,"Hey I have a problem , the game works and all. Works perfectly actually , the game works really well , but the problem is , once I've ended the game , after the ending epilogue a black screen comes and it is not there for a few seconds or minutes , it's there for a looooong time and bah! and to close the black screen I have the press esc key to stop it and the game ends with it and the progress is lost :( 
Can you help me out?
After a long time I've found a really good version of this game , please :("
,Gleeze1,2012-04-15T15:03Z,"hi art-castle.biz, can you mail me so that i can reply? for some reason tpb comments wont let me post up a link to the fix here"
,Gleeze1,2012-04-15T16:54Z,"actually it's ok, you can get the fully complete savegame from here:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7187784

that has all the characters unlocked already


to install it you just need to put the file tekken_3_a.bin in C:NAMCOTekken 3cards
then open psxfin.exe and go to file then configuration, and go to the memory cards tab at the top, then choose tekken_3_a.bin as the memory card for slot 1


you can also avoid the black screen by pressing start at the ending cutscene

sorry about that error, i only realised it once i had uploaded the torrent, but i dont know of any way i can fix it :S

hope this helped."
,art-castle.biz,2012-04-16T08:32Z,"Aww man :(
I wanted to unlock all characters on my own.
Anyway , thanks for the help , please do let me know if you'll ever re-make the game for pc and without any errors , because this game's like a part of my childhood. Still thanks dude."
,art-castle.biz,2012-04-16T08:49Z,"Also , I tried pressing enter at the ending cutscene , the error still appears :("
,Gleeze1,2012-04-16T15:55Z,"ok just figured i'd let y'all know that this release does have one known bug; where it crashes after the final fmv movie after beating true ogre in arcade mode, unfortunatly there is nothing i can do to fix this, as it is a fault with the pSX emulator, and is out of my control.

other than that the game works fine, and you can get all the characters in a savegame from the link i provided above in the comments, the game is still perfect for playing vs mode, ball mode, tekken force etc, and arcade mode plays fine until the end.

the best thing players can do is to download the save with all the characters, and if you really want to play through with all the characters you still can, you just wont be unlocking anything for it because it will all already be unlocked."
,art-castle.biz,2012-04-17T18:48Z,"Wait , there is a fault , but I just figured out something , guys after the ending epilogue , when you hear a sound ""The iron first tournament"" , that's the moment when you're supposed to press enter and then the game works fine.
I just did that and it works normal and works perfect!
It's unlocking characters and everything , this game WORKS!
I'm gonna seed the game to help you out as a token of my appreciation , I suggest you add it in the description that , so that others don't have to bother typing it out in comments like I did. 
Cheers , thanks again! "
