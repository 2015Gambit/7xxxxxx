"Four Weddings and a Funeral 
       (Minus Three Weddings and One Funeral"

The gang find themselves at yet another 
wedding, this time the nuptials of Derrick 
and Eric. Will there be "DRAMA," to quote 
Derrick? Of course, as Brad struggles to tell 
Jane something important; Jane tries to find 
a way to help Eric hide the fact that the 
pricey reception must be downscaled; and Max 
tries to find the courage to perform with his 
old all-male Madonna cover band. Meanwhile, a 
dateless Penny is sad that she's at another 
wedding, alone, until she meets cute guy 
Chris via Skype.

Evolve...or die.

Enjoy the season finale... o wait, the fools
at ABSHE skipped an episode again this year.
So stay tuned for a random episode sometime
during the summer.

Enjoy :)
