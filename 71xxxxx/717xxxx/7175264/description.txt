Synopsis:

In the near future, a meteorite carrying a foreign virus crashes in Japan, leading to a devastating nation-wide infection and total anarchy. An international organisation known as the GHQ intervenes with martial law and restores order to Japan at the cost of its independence. This incident becomes known as the Lost Christmas.

Ten years later in 2039, Ouma Shuu - a teen with a special ability awakened by the Apocalypse Virus - meets Yuzuriha Inori, a strange girl who incites him to join the struggle against the government organisation's robotic forces and a secret society whose goal remains shrouded in mystery.
