In Law & Order: Legacies, you will play as the detectives, questioning a range of suspectsΓÇöthen use your knowledge of the case to evaluate whether they are lying or telling the truth. You can also search the scene of a crime for clues, and use those clues in your investigation.

Once in court, you will act as prosecutors to elicit testimony on the stand, and object to the Defense attorneys when they get out of line. As the jury watches, their sympathies will sway to one side or the other. The juryΓÇÖs feelings about your case will affect the outcome, as well as your ability to negotiate a good plea bargainΓÇöshould you choose to do so.
