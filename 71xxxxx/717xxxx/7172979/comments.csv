""Seeders:    0"".

I am seeding it right now at about 240 K/s."
,Ukie,2012-04-10T03:55Z,"OK, forget my old comment. The information list now displays the correct number of seeders."
,Sexwulf,2012-04-11T19:04Z,"Works like a charm on my lion 10.7.2, but the mouse is still a bit laggy,everything else is ok.

Thanks a lot"
,Ukie,2012-04-13T01:56Z,"You're welcome, and remember:

Lag is better than nothing!"
,trier12,2012-04-16T00:20Z,"works great... but the mouse is extremely laggy, is there any fix?"
,Ukie,2012-04-19T00:48Z,"I wouldn't know, sorry. Also, that is usually on for the menus, and not the game itself."
,chipsamoy,2012-04-21T10:02Z,"I downloaded this with Lion 10.7.3 but it doesn't open. 

Could be just my computer if it is working for others. Anyway thanks for putting this up here Ukie!"
