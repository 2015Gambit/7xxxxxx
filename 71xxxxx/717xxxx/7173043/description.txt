kefy is a musicial genius. Another great album to follow fractaleline - gift. An instrumental Touhou arrange, a weird blend of Darkstep, Drum and Bass, House, and Hardcore. To be fair, the man makes his own style -- every track on the album is highly enjoyable, making it a rare gem. Bonus points for being highly creative and complex enough to just melt away into.

Definitely worth a listen, or forty.

Enjoy!
