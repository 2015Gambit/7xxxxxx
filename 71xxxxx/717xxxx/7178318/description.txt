This week BEC Recordings' and international rock artist Manafest (aka Chris Greenwood) released his fifth studio album, Fighter. This album follows his critically acclaimed release The Chase and is already on track to reach the heights of his previous effort. In true Manafest fashion, he has already taped two music videos from this new album. Fans can view "Never Let You Go" and "Pushover" online now.

"Never Let You Go," Fighter's lead CHR single, currently New and Active, shows the softer, more spiritually reflective side of Manafest's endless pursuit. This song is also charting on the National Christian Audience chart. The title track is currently at Rock radio and charting in the Top 10.

The media are digging Fighter stating it is "lyrically intense," "packs a power punch," and an "ambitious blend of rap, hip-hop and R&B."
