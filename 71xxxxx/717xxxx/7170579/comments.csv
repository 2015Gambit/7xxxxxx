,dashmtpb,2012-04-09T05:57Z,Why does nobody upload AVIs anymore?
,Lonsman,2012-04-09T06:22Z,They don't upload AVIs because they're watching on their monitors...
,Baker9er,2012-04-09T06:50Z,"Please, people, seed
I'm downloading slow,
lessen your greed,
even just for this show,
and think in your mind,
what a good thing it is
to spread what you find
without consequence

,ViralBlack,2012-04-09T13:36Z,"Im positive if you go through the work of ripping it, encoding it, uploading it, and sharing it..... you can have it in any format you want :)"
,JuliaanLauwers,2012-04-09T17:15Z,"Thank you very much, "
,wask_,2012-04-09T21:12Z,"@lonsman It's funny, I download AVIs cause my TV doesn't support MP4s."
,holv,2012-04-09T21:39Z,It's a pain in the ass when you watch in avi because of the TV/DVD...
,Damocles2,2012-04-10T04:28Z,"This is fake. Inside the rar is a password protected file and instructions to go to a site full of ads to get the password. Went to the site, pulled the password out of the JavaScript (UA-11855010-4 if anyone cares), and the rar file has a CRC error anyway.

Save yourself the time, do not download."
,Damocles2,2012-04-10T04:45Z,Arg -- not a fake. Sorry. This has just an mp4. Ignore my previous comment.
,HandDick,2012-04-10T09:27Z,"Damocles, look at the uploader. eztv doesn't produce fakes :-)"
,bill1874,2012-04-13T05:20Z,Thank you eztv.  Thank you for the many torrents you have made that I have downloaded.
,bannan81,2012-04-15T20:44Z,"why do I constantly get ""error: permission denied"" in my torrent client?
I'm a registered pirate bay user. I seed. "
,mwdr,2012-06-13T15:40Z,Thank you eztv
