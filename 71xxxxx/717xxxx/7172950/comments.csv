,eleaticus,2012-04-10T04:14Z,"lol.  quite a thematic series! I'm Dling them in spite of my better judgement.

Thanks!

How about a ""Four"" series, including Four Fast Guns?  I saw it in 1959? and have been trying to get it for decades. [It is a class double-z western that actually has great dead-pan rips on many western-flic cliches.]"

The hotel is a hotbed of Nazis, refugees, spies and ordinary Germans trying to survive inevitable defeat without getting too involved. 

Good Cast. Haven't seen it. Been looking for it though.

Thx for all the gems you've uploaded SO FAR."
