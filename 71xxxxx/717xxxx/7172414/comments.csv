,0rochimaru,2012-04-10T06:00Z,"Works perfectly (bit stuttery windowed mode for some reason).  It's got local co-op too!

Thanks!"
,ajaxsirius,2012-04-10T08:02Z,Torrent works for me but I was unable to get the resolution to go higher than 1280x1024 in the options menu. Anyone know if this is a limitation of the game or a mistake in the crack?

,x3merrr,2012-04-10T12:47Z,"Doesn't work for me.. i use win7 x64 8800gt and besides the resolution can't go above 1280x1024, the graphics are messed up, almost nothing can be seen properly."
,x3merrr,2012-04-10T13:25Z,"Ok, i found a solution for messed up graphics - turn off antialiasing in Nvidia control panel... but still, fix the resolution issue SKIDROW! i'm sure it can go 1920x1080"
,klord2010,2012-04-10T15:26Z,"only thing skidrow did is putting steam emulator.

problems so far:
resets user configuration, limited resolution support, no key remapping.
also game is not that good.

shame on square enix."
