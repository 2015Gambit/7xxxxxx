,micron66,2012-04-09T21:39Z,"thanks polx73.

what about Amber D,Midori & Vada ? do have them ?"
,polx73,2012-04-09T22:36Z,I have only Midori
,brianxxx,2012-04-11T16:12Z,"Love the uploads. Great stuff!

Just a thought  - maybe not bundle them into one huge RAR? It only forces someone to have to download the whole thing instead of maybe just the sets they are missing, etc."
,polx73,2012-04-11T18:47Z,I will upload separately each set
