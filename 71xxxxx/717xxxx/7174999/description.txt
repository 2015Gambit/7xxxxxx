    Harman had heard that love makes life       
    wonderful, but life had taught him that     
    he has to make his life wonderful to        
    get his love. Harman is a quintessential    
    middle class male in love with Simran,      
    but Simran belongs to an elite family.      
    Like any cupid-struck lover, Harman vows    
    that he will make himself and his life      
    worth Simran. Harman in his pursuit of      
    love and happiness goes to Bangkok, where   
    he expects his life to take a U-turn and    
    fulfill his comparatively small but         
    wildest dream of getting Simran.
