WHAT NOT TO WEAR

Two fashion stylists and a team of hair and makeup advisors help revamp the look of individuals who have been nominated by their friends for makeovers due to their lamentable appearance, using a $5,000 budget.

SEASON 8 EPISODE 8 - Sarah M.

Sarah is a 25-year-old aspiring lawyer who knows how to argue her case in court, but when it comes to defending her barely legal style, the judgment is ... guilty. Because of her conservative upbringing, Sara rebelled with a scandalously skimpy teenage wardrobe, but now that's she about to become a stepmom to her fiancé’s three kids, her inappropriately trashy style is about to be subpoenaed. Can Sarah handle taking a hard look at herself and her style? Or will her defensive attitude drive the What Not to Wear team over the edge — Clinton actually walked out at one point!
