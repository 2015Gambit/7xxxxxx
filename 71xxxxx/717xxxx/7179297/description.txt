my review-
The legendary anime has returned everyone. !!!!
The storyline of Omega takes place in the future era, 25 years after the Holy Wars of the 20th century narrated in the original manga and its anime adaptation. The goddess Athena is still on Earth after reincarnating to cleanse it of the agent of evil as she has done during millennia, accompanied by her Saints, fulfilling her duty of protecting peace on Earth, after her victories over antagonistic deities. Athena and a new generation of Saints prepare to face a new menace that lurks in this new era, in which Pegasus Seiya, the protagonist of Kurumada's manga, is revered as a Saint of legend.
Saint Seiya Omega story involves a new generation of Saints who have to protect Athena from Mars. We are introduced to Kouga who at a young age was attacked by Mars who is after Athena's Cosmos power. Years later he is being trained by Shaina in order for him to become Saint. He is chosen as the next successor of the Pegasus Cloth. We will see the new generation dawning the original cloths. 
Saint Seiya Omega used the original Saint Seiya themed opening. The opening scenes reminded me the original Saint Seiya. Sound- same sound effects of Pegasus Meteor Fist!!! : )
I cannot wait to see more of the new series.
