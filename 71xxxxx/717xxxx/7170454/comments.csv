,taste_this,2012-04-09T04:53Z,FAKE!!! I hate when people upload this crap where one episode is like 20 damn files!
,taste_this,2012-04-09T04:54Z,FAKE!!! FAKE!!! FAKE!!! FAKE!!! FAKE!!! FAKE!!! 
,WakeUpHate,2012-04-09T05:13Z,"It's not fake, you just dont know the right way to play it because you're clearly an idiot. Dont claim its fake just because you cant get it to work correctly for you, because it will keep others that clearly aren't as stupid as you from properly downloading it and being able to enjoy it."
,camaro1975,2012-04-09T05:15Z,"IN REPLY TO TASTE THIS

THIS IS NOT A FAKE, IT IS A .RAR FILE
SIMPLY EXTRACT THE MYTHBUSTERS FROM THE .RAR FILE AND THERE YOU HAVE IT!

A SINGLE .RAR FILE IS VERY OFTEN A FAKE BUT WHEN THEY ARE IN 10 OR MORE EQUAL SIZED FILES IT USUALLY MEANS ITS REAL.

AND ALSO ITS FROM SCENELINE-A TRUSTED SOURCE!!"
,WakeUpHate,2012-04-09T05:15Z,"It isn't fake, you're just stupid."
,SkylineZRS,2012-04-09T05:28Z,"Looks great Sceneline , Thanks . 

""Taste_this"" , Suck my balls . Retard does'nt know what a .rar file is but somehow figured out how to leave a post , really ?"
,tmcmahon51,2012-04-09T09:42Z,taste_this is another example of why 10yr olds shouldn't be allowed to use computers.
,iamsiaho,2012-04-09T09:47Z,taste_this are you retarded or something? sceneline never posts anything fake and the yellow skull next to the name means VIP member. CHECK THINGS before you try to call them out.
,ttford,2012-04-09T10:50Z,Thanks for the up guys
[V],spastik64,2012-04-09T12:07Z,"It's not fake, they're just Noobers or news in the Scene. Most groups rar's the releases, but they don't know that yet..."
,tor12,2012-04-09T17:04Z,Thank God for sceneline! 
,High_Low,2012-04-10T18:03Z,"Thanks sceneline, nice to see 720p.
Awesome episode :)
"
,Naffetse,2012-04-10T18:37Z,"Why would you seed this as rar files? It adds nothing of value, i.e. it won't compress the video even one bit. 

And in addition to that, all the retards will scream bloody murder when they don't understand something like archive files, so please don't seed rar files again. Thanks for the upload though."
,DrLex,2012-04-10T18:52Z,"I agree, putting rar files inside a torrent is pointless. Rar fragments make sense when downloading multiple pieces, not inside a torrent which does all the fragmenting, error checking, and reconstructing for you."
,Leonidas123,2012-05-03T18:49Z,"I am getting CRC Error while extracting.
I have 7 Zip, and i have tried Force Recheck of the file.
What are you guys extracting it with ?"
,Leonidas123,2012-05-03T18:59Z,"Ok, i installed WinRAR and it extracts fine.
Why is it not extracting with 7 Zip ?
And why .rar for videos ?
One who initiated the idea of RAR-Splitting videos is a moron. He has plagued torrent industry for eternity. "
