From the artist's official web site:

"The album Her Only Nightgown was recorded between 1999 and
2000 with sound engineer Michel Carvalho; for the final
mixing, the band went to Euterpe studio (where they decided
not to do it) and to SIC television studios, where they
made a first mix that was rejected by all band members.

The album was released on CD, digipack format. The record
was already circulating in 2000 with a first distribution
in concerts, but it was officially released to the market
in 2001.

The lyrics of the song Her Only Nightgown came out of the
first page of Dodie Smith's book I Captured The Castle -
Filipe Miranda found this book in a street in south of
Spain; this song was also released in compilation Promusica
(Promusica, 2001) and Kafka (2002); the song Gandhi's Dream
Of Chocolate was later used for a promotional video
performance made in Barcelos at the abandoned Vouga
industrial zone (2001)."
