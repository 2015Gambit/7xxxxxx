,4to20characters,2012-04-10T11:10Z,"This is actually part one of ""Domestic"" - BBC pulled ""And then I fell in Love"" at the last minute for legal reasons."
,cinesimon,2012-05-08T01:40Z,"Apparently both episodes of 'and then i fell in love', but they were pulled when the decision was made about pulling the show these last couple days due to a court case involving a similar crime.
Hopefully someone who seeds will have downloaded it, and will at some point upload them for all to see!"
,cinesimon,2012-05-08T01:43Z,"Ignore my nonsensical first comment - here goes again: 

Apparently both episodes of 'and then i fell in love', were available on itunes during April, but they were pulled when the decision was made to not air them on TV, due to a court case involving a similar crime.
Hopefully someone who seeds will have downloaded it, and will at some point upload them for all to see!"
