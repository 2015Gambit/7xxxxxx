,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-13T14:45Z,"hi dude, to fix this uninstall the version from bitdefender website and install the version from my torrent it will fix your problem. This error apear because you have been installed a diferent version of the software. After you install the setup from my torrent do the updates and you will have the latest version of the product. For any problems PM me via Suprbay or a comment. Have a nice day bro :P"

,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-15T15:33Z,"@rms1457 
i recommend one antivirus program on one pc

@adray81 & Yemiboy

do you do the steps from info ?? and do you reboot your pc ? if problem persist try to do a clean re-install (clean registry & delete all files) and try to re-activate."
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-15T15:34Z,reinstall the software and activate it again it may fix. if problem persist contact me via suprbay or comment
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-15T16:40Z,"Sorry for that problem with '30 days' i forgot to mention, sorry for that.
And when you try to activate you saw this message: http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/6124/neterr.png

If that problems apear for you re-install the app using this methode

Use this steps to activate:

1) Install as trial

2) Reboot the computer and start on safe mode with networking !!!!! not like in info.txt

Before open crack file unplug your network cable for a moment to avoid this

a fucking bullshit advertisment. Now when crack will show an error click ok/contiunue
(it's say it because you don't have network connection).
Now plug-in your netwotk cable and continue your activation (select period of license valability..... bla bla)

Sorry for my mistake, i forgot to mention it on how to install guide.

For all who are not sure some screens here:

1) Plug in your network cable again here:

2) Here create a new my bitdefender account for do the updates:

http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/8951/bitdefcreateaccount.png

3) Now contiunue choose your activation period (the standard is 365 day (1 year))

4) Then you will see a pop-up saying bitdef is activated and click ok and you will see this:

' Your current license is xxx days' (how many days you selected when you activate)

5) Reboot the computer, start in normal mode and you will see this:

This is the final

This guide will solve your problems, and sorry again....

,queue2,2012-04-16T16:54Z,i am unable to connect to the internet while in safe mode with networking....what to do plz help
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-17T10:27Z,"@queue2

You only can't acces the internet in safe mode with networking ? or on local are connection appear an X ?? Or what ? Can you describe more or post a screen ?"
,romaniac85,2012-04-18T10:07Z,"Hey guys,

I can confirm it doesn't work. Everything is all good until you need to update.

However, I found a solution:
http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/BitDefender-Internet-Security-2012-1-USER-1-year-/251043066330?pt=AU_software&hash=item3a735531da#ht_1219wt_1139

(If the link is expired, type into ebay.com.au ""BitDefender Internet Security 2012"" then search by cheapest including postage = should be one there for $5).

I'm not being a smart ass but it's only $5 and it works."

,j301988,2012-05-07T01:26Z,crack is a hack tool
,xk3nvel0x,2012-05-07T19:49Z,"@j301988
Hi dude, cracks are detected by the antivirus as a virus or a hack tool but its a false positive alarm, don't worry it's clean... all my torrents are scanned for viruses, if you don't want to use it, buy the software from bitdefender store :P"
,rawasduke,2012-05-10T05:24Z,xk3nvel0x you are a badass!  Thanks a million dog!  I did the x64 version.  Worked like a champ
,j301988,2012-05-10T08:34Z,"I'm actually using this. I began to suspect when the suite automatically changes activity even when in auto pilot. I had several instances when autopilot and auto scan were turned off without me even noticing right away. But other than that, the torrent is great."
,spockdaz,2012-05-12T11:26Z,"I was in safemode with networking, tried to activate using run as administrator and also got the message ""the mode in which your pc started is unknown, clicked again as administrator, got the same message, then just clicked open and it activated, updates are downloading and everything is working fine, cheers."

,mansell93,2012-05-14T20:39Z,and one more thing....the crack just keeps disappearing after some time....have to download it again and again...got any idea of it??
,xk3nvel0x,2012-05-15T16:38Z,"antivirus will remove crack because it detect as a virus, if you need the crack again re-download the torrent. But if you already activate product you won't need the crack on your computer...."
,jakeDassler,2012-05-17T18:14Z,"the mode which your pc is started in unkown! can not continue

this error pop out in safe mode with networking
but if i plugin the netwrk cable,it will go fine and load the ad window

its impossible.how others do it? i followed all instruction"
,testertest123,2012-05-22T02:12Z,"to all those with the ""the mode which your pc is started in unknown! can not continue"" error, after much trial/error the solution is to keep the internet in whenever it checks and remove it otherwise.

So: 
1. Keep internet in, and start the program. 
2. Hit ok at the language selection and immediately remove the internet once the countdown for the ad begins
3. when 0:10 seconds are remaining, put the internet back and wait for the program to continue.
4. follow steps as outlined by xk3nvel0x"

,Ploype,2012-05-25T20:36Z,I don't know how to connect to the internet in safe mode. Can I connect to wifi?
,xk3nvel0x,2012-05-25T21:47Z,"@Jashilthis

Use the instructions from my comment to install & register

@Ploype

At system boot choose Safe Mode with Networking for using Safe Mode with internet connection
P.S. If you use wi-fi or wired network connection is the same matter (in safe mode clasic, not safe mode with networking, wi-fi or wired network connection is not working, are disabled by the system, therefore you need to use safe mode with networking to can connect through wi-fi or network wired (cable)). Have a good day."
,phantomphantom,2012-06-09T09:10Z,does this work for x32??
,bisentex,2012-06-12T06:41Z,i tried using both the instructions of xk3nvel0x and testertest123 and still cannot get the activator to work. :(
,bisentex,2012-06-12T06:52Z,"got it working, tried testertest123's way and got through. :) thanks"
,smokeesid,2012-07-21T09:50Z,@xk3nvel0x Man its hard to understand your instructions. Are you saying that I should first install the IS as trial then open safe mode with networking and choose 365 days in the days of activation? Then when to use the crack? I am baffled.
,smokeesid,2012-07-21T12:37Z,Oh I get it and it works. Thanks a lot man
,BrandonOrJuggalo,2012-08-05T14:01Z,I restart my computer but how do i even get into safe mode??? .-.?
