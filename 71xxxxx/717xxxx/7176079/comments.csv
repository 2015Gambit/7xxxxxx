,UAofE,2012-04-11T10:31Z,File size is far too small to have good quality.
,Punisher_Bay,2012-04-11T15:33Z,"UAofE - thanks, now leave and never return."

,erraticchevy,2012-04-14T05:16Z,When I Play This on my PS3 It plays in double the speed everything goes fast and I cant figure out why
,ancientlou81,2012-04-17T06:22Z,"Hey YIFY just wanted to let you know that for some reason, which I don't know why... This movie in both formats will not play on my xbox through my external hard drive... every other movie you uploaded that was MP4 worked... so thought I would let you know just in case you did some thing different with those ones.... Love this movie and really wanted to watch it on the Big Screen... But as always thank you for this hits Bro... Keep'm coming... Any chance on Ironman? lol "

,kiwibrandon,2012-04-19T10:51Z,"i have the same problem as erraticchevy, two of my most recent downloads play at twice the speed on the ps3 and when wirelessly broadcast to my sony bravia. does anyone know why this happens? is it the new way for studio's to prohibit d/l's?"
,Beetlejuicexx,2012-04-29T21:39Z,"@Ironyman the visual quality may be apparant, but the audio isn't. This was a 5.1 / 7.1 release - but i bet at only 1.4gb the audio is 2 channel only..."
,Beetlejuicexx,2012-04-30T00:09Z,I stand corrected - and i'm surprised as this is the first time i've seen a smaller sized file with the visual and audio quality compressed so well.
,kwaycx,2012-05-04T06:17Z,I'm also having the same problem on the PS3.  The movie seems to play at 2x speed. :-(
,Rithis,2012-06-13T19:25Z,Video quality is very good but there are big problems with audio - sound isn't clear at all. Rather choose different version
,amayab,2012-06-24T03:52Z,"If these downloads are as great as everyone says, you might be second best to aXXo. the pirate technician king of all time. That's a pretty big compliment, especially if you knew the guys work "
,artbell2,2012-07-22T05:27Z,V10 / A7.5. Only issue is that you need to crank the volume up more to hear it at normal audio. This is not a problem if you have a good speaker system. The video is high quality superb. I prefer IMDB ratings of 7.5 to have a bigger file size though. Just an opinion. Thanks for the upload.
,AxLs34n,2012-08-20T06:22Z,"thanks sir, great upload!"
,fakeidmuhammad,2012-09-13T00:46Z,"A-10
