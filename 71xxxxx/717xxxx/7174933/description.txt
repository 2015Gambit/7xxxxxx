You just gotta love Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler's guitar playing. If you ever had the chance to see Dire Straits in a small venue, count yourself among the blessed.

These SACD recordings allow you to sit right among the band as they recorded the songs.

The sound is top of the line excellent. The music emerges from a noiseless background and seems to have limitless depth. The highs are clear and uncompressed, bass is tight and deep.

Presented in Apple Lossless. All tracks were converted using XLD for those of us who use iTunes on Apple products. It is true lossless so you are getting the best.

(PS. I strongly suggest getting an Apple TV. It has an optical audio port that allows you to stream your iTunes library right out to your home theatre stereo. It has a ton of other features but it has been the best $99 I have ever spent)

Enjoy!
