They are UFOs that don't have the decency to stay where they are expected.  Instead, they are said to dive deep below the world's waters as USOs-unidentified submerged objects.
  
UFO FILES plunges into the Santa Catalina Channel near Los Angeles to search for evidence of a 1992 USO event.  

Next, probe the paranormal history of the USS FDR, which was at the center of at least eight major sightings in its two-decade career.  

Then it's off to Australia to examine famed Tully Water-Crop Circle Case. Guides for this journey include USS FDR veterans Chet Gruisinsky and Harry Jordan, USO researcher Dr. Stephen Greer, and Australian UFO expert Bill Chaulker.
