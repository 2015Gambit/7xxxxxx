Is it worth living for three short days only? Is it sensible, to wait for something impossible for a lifetime? Can you tell if somebody's else life is worth living?

This is quiet movie but it's a strong voice in defence of those who are fighting for each day lying motionless in bed. It remains us how fragile we are.
