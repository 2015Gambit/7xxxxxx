If you want you can come find me and ill woop your ass up and down the street showing you how lazy I am :)

,legleger,2012-04-11T01:31Z,just downloadet it and watch.. its better quality than before.. BUT the fight scenes can the camera not follow up.. so if u dont care about the fight scenes its okay.. but if u do dont download !

,gilknut,2012-04-11T09:27Z,"Give me strength. So, so many UNBELIEVABLY dense fucks commenting on things they have no clue about. 

There's no particular reason to doubt this rip is from a disc in Region 6, as stated. But that's completeley irrelevant, because the movie isn't officially released there either yet. So the CONTENT on that disc (as is the case in so many of these Asian copies) is originally from a CAM or TS or TC recording. 

It's not good, and it's no better than any other relatively decent CAM-version.    "
,GateKeeper13,2012-04-11T10:13Z,"@gilknut, then its should have been called TS you moron. Not R6. R5-R6 releases are supposed to be real dvd quality versions from different regions, not dvds containing Cam or Ts content!!!"
,Stealthdevil666,2012-04-11T10:27Z,"A-5
V-4

Unwatchable for me, as with all these R6 ""HD"" Korean rips that have came out this past week, the frame rate is very low, no matter what computer/tv I watch it on it almost looks like every other frame is missing and the film is in slow motion resulting in the action scenes being a complete blur...

If you want to watch this film for the story alone this might be for you, otherwise I'd recommend waiting"

,p1exus,2012-04-11T21:10Z,"I personally don't think this is an r6. The frame rate is low, and at it has light flickers like a cam would. If it is indeed a cam, they did a good job. But my expectations for an r5/r6 is higher than what the quality of this movie is.  

Also as stated in the NFO, a third of the movie is cropped on the bottom. It seems like they were trying to crop out the asian subtitles. Which to me ruins the whole movie. They cropped so much of you can tell that almost half of the movie is missing.

Haven't seen this movie yet so imma wait for a better release."
,exarmy28,2012-04-11T21:28Z,Yea i retract my last comment...not a good copy at all to be honest!

It says R6 in the file name, it is an R6. That means that this torrent is 100% what it says it is, how does that make the uploader look bad? If your to stupid to read the file name before you download thats your fault not his."
