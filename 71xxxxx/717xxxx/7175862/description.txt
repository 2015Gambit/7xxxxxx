eTextbook of "Algebra: Form and Function, 3rd Revision" by W. G. McCallum, E. Connally, D. Hughes-Hallett, et al. (c2010). Small bookmarked, page-numbered PDF file (7 MB) complete with table of contents and index. Quasi-native PDF.

Description and table of contents:  http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000346.html

NOTA: Due to a setting problem somewhere (conversion?), page numbers cannot be seen. PDF page-numbering is accurate though so the index can still be used.

Comment: Produced by the Calculus Consortium and initially funded by a National Science Foundation Grant.
