DESCRIPTION:

GoogleΓÇÖs Android operating system is amazing in the breadth of what it can do, and the many ways it can be implemented 
on smartphones.

That also means that there may be many powerful features that you havenΓÇÖt yet discovered, and a bit of confusion as 
to why your phone doesnΓÇÖt look like the phones you see in other peopleΓÇÖs hands. ThatΓÇÖs why The Complete Android Guide 
was created. ItΓÇÖs a comprehensive run-down of everything your phone can do, written from the perspective of the curious user.
With screenshots, step-by-step instructions, and explanations of how everything fits together in plain English, new Android users will unlock their phoneΓÇÖs potential, and journeyman ΓÇÿdroid fans will pick up some new tricks.

As Android changes and updates, so does this guide. The Complete Android Guide is updated as soon as possible after 
new Android versions arrive on phones and tablets, and major variations are covered, like MotorolaΓÇÖs Motoblur and 
HTCΓÇÖs Sense UI. When new, cool apps come out, we include them in the extended features. YouΓÇÖve got a 21st century phone, 
and a how-to guide should at least try to keep up..
