Moto3
This new 4-stroke, 250cc, single-cylinder class replaces the 125cc GP category, which had its final run in 2011. The maximum age for riders is 28 years (25 for wild-card riders or those newly contracted and competing in a Moto3 for the first time) and the minimum age is 16 years.

Moto2
The Moto2 class replaced the 250cc category from 2010. Honda is the sole engine supplier, and Dunlop provide the tyres. The bikes are powered by a 600cc 4-stroke engine, producing around 140hp, and the design and construction of the chassis is free within the constraints of the FIM Grand Prix Technical Regulations. The main frame, swingarm, fuel tank, seat and fairing/bodywork from a non-prototype 
(ie. series production road-homologated) motorcycle may not be used. The minimum age for riders is 16.
