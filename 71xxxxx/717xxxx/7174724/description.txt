The Singles Collection, Volume 2 is a limited edition CD series compilation box set by the English rock band Queen, released in 2009. The box set contains remastered versions of the next thirteen top-40 charting singles released by Queen that appear subsequent to those in the first volume.

The collection is notable for containing tracks that have never before been officially released on CD, namely A Human Body (previously only available as a 7" vinyl b-side) and Back Chat (which was remixed for single release, and has only ever been available on the original 7"). The live tracks are taken from Queen's Live Killers album.
