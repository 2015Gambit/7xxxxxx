ItΓÇÖs a familiar story ΓÇô men with beards playing vintage instruments and writing folk songs in isolated ΓÇÿrusticΓÇÖ locations. ItΓÇÖs almost an initiation rite if you want kudos for your folk chops, and Melbourne four-piece Husky are no exception, their debut record Forever So the result of a comparable backstory. Based around the songs of singer/guitarist Husky Gawenda and keyboardist Gideon Preiss, the band tread a path similar to Fleet Foxes, reaching back to the likes of Fairport Convention and adding in the odd touch of Beach Boys (see, for example, GawendaΓÇÖs Carl Wilson impression at the end of The Woods). While I had initially expected another poor-manΓÇÖs Fleet Foxes imitation, I found myself drawn to much of Forever So. Beautiful little moments litter the record, instances that grab you and demand attention ΓÇô such as how the finger-picked guitar gives way to the rich intonation of Gawenda during the opening stanzas of the impressive HistoryΓÇÖs Door; the gentle Midlake-like vocal harmonies that drift through Hunter, and the compelling tale of frayed relationships that lurks beneath Dark Sea. HuskyΓÇÖs stories are certainly romanticised, but this type of music works best that way and Husky have the approach down pat. ItΓÇÖs not all plain sailing though ΓÇô the first half of the record is noticeably stronger than the second, the mood changing somewhere around the title track, the songs becoming more self-conscious and less charming. Tracks like the sympathetic How Do You Feel are not necessarily bad, but lack the immediacy of those that come before. Still, I expected to dislike Forever So, but ended up largely enjoying it. Meaning HuskyΓÇÖs music may be powerful enough to win over the sceptics.
