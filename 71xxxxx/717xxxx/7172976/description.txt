"The Bump in the Road"

With the help of Special Agent Genny 
Shaw, the Jeffersonian team 
identifies the remains of a discount 
shopper and "extreme couponer" who 
was dragged along the road by an 18-
wheeler. Meanwhile, Brennan is 
adjusting to her first day back at 
work after giving birth, and Cam 
disapproves of her daughter's 
romance with intern Finn Abernathy.

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
