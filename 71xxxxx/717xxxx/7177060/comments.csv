,omegaviper,2012-05-03T02:56Z,what's with the video quality it's like the watercolor effect in photo shop.  I know the screen shots down below in the description look great but that is far from what the video actually looks like.  I used vlc and mpc to test this with default settings and I tested other videos and they look fine.  I would recommenced getting a different release.
