[V],wushdishmeen,2012-04-09T23:52Z,"More like thanks to the alt-binaries-howard-stern newsgroups. 

You phony losers."
,orbital8,2012-04-10T00:04Z,Has  wushdishmeen retired? NO!!!!! He's the king! 
[V],TheExecutive,2012-04-10T04:09Z,"Doesn't matter where it came from to me.
SternGeek was hours ahead of Wushdishmeen on Monday, and that's what matters !"
[V],wushdishmeen,2012-04-16T19:28Z,"Actually no that's not what matters.  Quality of rip matters and this rip is garbage.

Also giving credit to the person who did the actual work of ripping the show and pays for the subscription & equipment to record it in the first place.

But you wouldn't know anything about that.  SternGeek is taking credit... if he was simply sharing them and saying ""thanks to so and so"" then nobody would care.

It's the fact that he's pretending he did it himself.  Get a grip.  Weren't you one of those imbeciles who said I was lying about having a website?  Now 15,000 registrations later you were begging to get into it.

Funny how things change?   Enjoy being that phony losers cheerleader.  You'll never be an uploader."
