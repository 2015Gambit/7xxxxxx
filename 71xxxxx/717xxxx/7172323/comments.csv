,baloo100,2012-04-12T07:44Z,thanks for sharing!which is the rar password???
,baloo100,2012-04-12T07:47Z,thanks for sharing!!!which is the rar pass??
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-04-12T08:30Z,"I never upload RAR files and a password is NEVER needed for my torrents 

If you DL a torrent that is claiming to be mine but is a RAR or says to DL something else for the password 

Then is not an actual torrent of mine.I understand there are people who false tag torrents for some reason lol i guess nothing better to do

But always make sure if you want to DL a xCrazy0328x torrent make sure it says i uploaded the torrrent before you start to DL it"
