,resmith,2012-04-12T06:30Z,Is this legit?
,scuzz08,2012-04-12T19:25Z,"resmith, yes it is.  MKV file."
,ellakim1,2012-04-12T20:02Z,xvid?
,resmith,2012-04-13T18:09Z,Doesn't work. Too bad others don't comment on this to save bandwidth. I even tried to convert it to a xvid with no luck.  
,resmith,2012-04-13T20:37Z,My mistake. I had to rename the extension to read avi instead of mkv. It plays on wmp now instead of my EM Total video player which normally plays everything.  
,scuzz08,2012-04-14T11:41Z,"It worked fine as an MKVon my computer, but when I converted to M2TS there is no sound.

Thanks resmith, I will try renaming it AVI.
