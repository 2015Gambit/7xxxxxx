Cyber Update Mar.2012US-20372 Isis Love, Rain DeGrey, Izamar Gutierrez, Audrey Rose and Bryn Blayne  + Pics


Welcome to Tag Team Tuesdays: totally non-scripted, all in front of a live audience, all broadcast live to members. Today's update is RD 3 of 4. This was February's live match, now edited for your enjoyment! 

Rain and Bryn have a huge hill to climb to get back on top of this match. However their opponents have other ideas on how this round will play out. This was one of the most aggressive tag team rounds we have seen in a long while. The girls held nothing back, devastating submission holds, brutal finger fucking amazing 2 on 1's.
