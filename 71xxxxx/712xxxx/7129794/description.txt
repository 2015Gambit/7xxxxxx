Having incorrectly and vaguely labelled 'Cairo 678' a 'feminist movie', I was pleasantly surprised to have all my misconceptions quashed in such a subtle and articulate manner. Yes, Cairo 678 is a film about 'women's plight' in Egypt, but also an important commentary on the class structure inherent in most societies, but particularly stark in Cairo, where gleaming BMWs travel alongside over-heated, bursting buses where sexual harassment is inevitably commonplace, as depicted in the film. Feyza is a working-class mother struggling to pay her children's school fees and to fend off her husband's sexual advances. It soon becomes apparent that her tardiness to work is simply a result of her desperate attempts to avoid the over-crowded buses where she is routinely molested by over-eager male passengers. She soon befriends Seba, a wealthy self-defence teacher who we learn was raped a year earlier, as well as a middle-class student (Nelly) whose life-threatening assault results in an historic first legal case for sexual harassment in Egypt.
