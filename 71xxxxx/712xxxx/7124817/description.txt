Watch Holden and Ford V8 Supercars battle it out..

3 files. 3 Races in MKV format 

Does not include Race 1 as that was NOT televised. 

Thanks to original cappers and uploaders. Good Onya Nubbin. 

Hard, fast, great racing, and a monumental stack (prang) on lap 1 of Race 3 which puts a car almost on its side.  

Enjoy.
