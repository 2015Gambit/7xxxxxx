Installed program, entered serial, said thanks for registering, closed program down, reopened still says i'm registered in the ""about"" box, but program actually says ""Trial Version""...Tried watching some different TV channels, and it says I have to be a registered user to watch this channel...hmmm

Thanks anyway though"
