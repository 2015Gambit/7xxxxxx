The debut album of Philadelphia-based neo soul artist Res.  Initially released in 2001 to critical acclaim, "How I Do" shows that not all R&B music has to be cookie cutter clones with lazy lyrics, as each track conveys an unique sound and interesting story.  Experimental beats and intricate harmonies compliment Res' soulful vocals.  Featuring the insatiable pop of "They-Say Vision" and the borderline-Lauryn Hill doow-op of the title track "How I Do," Res stands out amongst as an original artist in her own right.  The hidden acid rock song "Say It Anyway" is included as a bonus track.
