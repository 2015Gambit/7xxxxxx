Half-Cut subs are kinda annoying.

For those of you complaining Marines are grunts.. They don't make decisions, they don't have to think & just get told what to do. I've had to work with many of them and if you try to explain something to them its like trying to fit an elephant into a mini cooper they don't have the capacity they just do what they are told which is why you can't blame them for the recent conflicts its a job and if they weren't doing it they'd probably not be able to gain employment elsewhere."

Ok so I went out of my way to make an account (which I never planned on doing), just because I read this comment....You are a fucking moron. First of all don't try to use a quote if you don't know who its from. Second, do not disrespect a soldier  or anyone who is risking their lives for your safety, you pathetic waste of life. Third, they fight everyday to keep peace in these countries, such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, The DMZ of the Koreas. If we were not in these places their fucked up leaders or terrorists would have the freedom to acquire resources which could harm the US and other countries. 

The last thing is, what are your ""acquired"" skills? Jerking off your little wiener? Yea that would definitely help you in a fight. You would not last a minute overseas you fucking punk. Or you would by being a coward and running from the battle and leaving your brothers to die. 

Sorry my post was off topic, but I felt a hug disrespect toward our beloved soldiers fighting everyday, and even the retired vets for fighting in the past.

An excuse for a human being that shows no compassion to anyone else that seems to be doing something positive to be able to help and make sure that you are able to sit in your home at night and be able to use wonderful sites like thepiratebay.se, seems to have alot to say for just sitting on their ass.

It seems that while you're busy ""pretending"" to cyber ride someone else's mum because you haven't got the intelligence to be able to come back with something half witty, or use something called friction to be able to get those two lonely braincells in your skull to be able to form cognitive thought, needs to take a sit back and see how the world really is.

I'm not a violent guy, never been in a fight in my life. But dear god if it came down to it, I would drop everything to take a bullet for the ones that I love.

You know what, you and these skills that you acquired, go on, give me your best shot. Because I don't think anyone is going to believe that your a hard man when you punch a guy in the face that refuses to fight you.
