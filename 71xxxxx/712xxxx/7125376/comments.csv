,spockman,2012-04-19T02:57Z,"Norton 360 sucks. Don't waste your time unless you surf the same sites. I took a clean PC...one Win XPSP3 and other Win 7...i.e. just post operating system install and typical Microsoft install. I then slapped on 360. Talk about slowwwwwww browsing. Ok...must have been me used to ESET NOD32. So I had Norton learn the sites. Ok...now 40% faster than dead slow. About same effect as kicking off Norton safe surf. Doing everything only got it to about 75% as fast as an AVG, Avira or ESET scan. Save yourself the time and go for FREE Comodo. After frustration and testing Norton on a bunch of searches...I stripped off the Norton on both systems and put on Comodo. Ironically it found some Malware that Norton didn't find."

,la_cross37,2012-07-15T16:38Z,The trial reseter is the NTR by BOX made for norton 360 v5. It will give you 30 days if you use it on v6.
