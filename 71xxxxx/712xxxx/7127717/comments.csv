[V],psspss,2012-03-24T11:43Z,"these guys are funny they come up with the biggest
theories

yet no one has suggested perhaps like some humans that the aliens abduct all creatures even bigfoot and tag them and release and come back
for repeat abductions

hence why some seen them coming out  of UFOS ???

just my theory.. hey history channel
film me and pay me big bucks for my views too :)

I see they dumped the UFO mag ceo for comments lately.. shame theres no more UFO series they kept us informed of the latest happenings and findings"
[V],psspss,2012-03-24T12:15Z,"from now on anyone i see not sharing in my peer list
will be going to my personal block list

and anyone connecting to me with bitlord bitcomet or
transmission or any other weird client other
the utorrent will be blocked
that includes utorrent ver less then 2.x
some still using 1.6 1.7 and 1,83 out there with
poor UTP support

azure and mac utorrent and bittorrent all seem good
so far

im finding these arent sharing the data and slows
it down for all

how to save wasted data using utorrent

http://digiex.net/guides-reviews/guides-tutorials/application-guides/937-enable-update-ip-filter-block-list-utorrent-ipfilter-dat.html

all have a read

this is how Im doing it..
I made a ipfilter.dat in the program data area
and just add found ip from peerlist to it
x.x.x.x
right click on peer list then go update ipfilter.
person is then gone from the list :_)"

Thanks also for the tip on IP filtering in uTorrent.
Have applied the tweak.
Great!
:-)"
,babybluetits24,2012-04-09T17:21Z,psspss im told theres no point using peerblock if we use a vpn as utorrent automatically blocks ip's sending fake data so do we need the thing in your link ?
