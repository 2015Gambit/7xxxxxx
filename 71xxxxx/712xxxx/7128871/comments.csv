,showitoff,2012-04-05T04:17Z,Thanks for the Upload! Lots of great detail and scenery on this addon! Works and looks great! 
,wayner52,2012-04-24T07:23Z,"mita757 is correct. Notice that Fort Kent and Ohio Steel are made by All Aboard! (allaboardrails.com). One of Fort Kent's Assets folders is called ""Allaboard"". Apparently just the Fort Kent's version of this folder is missing things like track rails. Add the Ohio Steel 2 and you get another ""Allaboard"" folder. When you add the Ohio Steel 2 ""Allabord"" folder to your Assets it appears to make it complete. Hence Fort Kent now has rails. Ohio Steel 2 also adds an ""AllAboard Core.pi"" PackageInfo which must help complete it too."
