"Pilot"

Recently divorced Alex (Amanda Peet) 
is a high-strung lawyer raising her 
10 year-old daughter Charlie (Joey 
King) as a single mom. Unwilling to 
let anything get in her way, she 
downsizes into a smaller house and 
hires charismatic contractor Pete 
(David Walton), a free-spirited, 
recovering gambling addict who is a 
ladies man and in desperate need of 
this gig. Upon hiring him, Alex 
quickly realizes that she has met 
her match in Pete, who along with 
his motley construction crew, will 
not only tear apart her kitchen but 
transform her worldview in the 
process.
