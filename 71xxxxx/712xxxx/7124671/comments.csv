[T],promodsharma,2012-03-23T15:11Z,OK ! I am Off Grid. I am seeding continuously nearly 5 times the size of the torrent. All I get is HARs (Hit & Runs ). Does anybody blame me for going off the grid ?
[T],promodsharma,2012-03-23T15:13Z,"Number of seeders has come down to 2 from 12 and there are 41 leechers now. Should I seed forever, without help from TPB members ? Oh ! Well !!!"
[T],promodsharma,2012-03-23T15:21Z,"OK Guys it's 2 AM, Nightie Night ! I am off grid till next time ."
[T],promodsharma,2012-03-24T08:15Z,"OK Guys this was my last torrent. I am now retiring from TPB for personal reasons. It had been fun being with TPB and all it's awesome members.

Goodbye and Good Luck ! God Bless !"
