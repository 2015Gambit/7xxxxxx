,abec86,2012-03-24T06:44Z,Thanks for the release. Does the RUDOS release of friday night smackdown come out about 7-8 hours after the xvid?
,popeye013,2012-03-24T12:51Z,"This also contains a 'read me' text file.
It caused my Anti-Virus to stop me downloading it untill i removed that from the list, the actual MP4 torrent file, with the show inside it was fine, but why the fuck a text file has to be included, i have no idea.. "
,Taevious,2012-03-24T19:13Z,"Including a text file is common practice. It's your own fault for having crappy anti-virus software. The show itself is good in quality. V: 8 A: 8.

Thanks for the upload!"
,popeye013,2012-03-25T00:35Z,"Nothing crappy about my Anti-Virus, its the fact the Text file had something inside it that it didn't like and is becoming a major problem on here no, thanks to Magnet torrents.
The need to include a text file is zero, end of story, and before you again make your retarded claim about crappy Anti-Virus, ive caught 4 trojans on from TPB from text files after the change to magnets, so you, dickhead, no fuck all of what you speak! "
[V],scene4all,2012-03-25T04:34Z,"@popeye013, What Antivirus software are you using? BTW i scanned the same text file with virustotal and its totally clean.

,arathanstorrents,2012-03-25T20:32Z,thanks man. i appreciate your work.
,usethisusethis,2012-03-26T08:00Z,This is the best quality by far to download of this series every time.  Thank you.  Any plans to do the Brasil TUF episode?  The first one aired tonight.
,The_Trancemaster,2012-03-26T10:09Z,Anyone who gets a virus from a txt file should not be on the internet! It is obvious that they know absolutely nothing about how a computer works!
,popeye013,2012-04-01T13:12Z,"For a start im a computer programmer and have worked on them and in that industry for 15 years, so i know my computers and how they work, and what can happen and how easily a virus can be hidden and transferred inside of even a chat that you send to a Facebook friend. 
I use a Norton Firewall and Avast Pro, with anti-spyware and back-up virus protection from Super-anti-spyware. 
The firewall stopped it, the anti-virus that is contained in all the programmes all gave me the same result, that a trojan was contained in the txt file, i report that on here for people and get insulted and have to resort to this because apparently, im a dumb fuck! 
Next time, i will keep my trap shut and then when the reports of virus' in torrents are reported, i'll get slated because i said fuck all. "
,enonumus,2012-04-07T09:11Z,"It's a physical impossibility for an ASCI text file to contain an executable virus that can infect your system, period.  An infected executable file (and a handful of other file types like SCR, VBR etc.) could be renamed to a .txt extension, but the file size will be much larger than an ASCI text file would be, which is your first clue not to run/open it.  Also your ASCI text reader such as Notepad would just error out when it tried to view the file, it wouldn't execute the infected code even if it WAS a renamed executable file.  Now, if it was a .DOC file that's a different story, but it isn't, and nobody uses .doc files in lieu of .txt files inside of torrents.

The included text file in this torrent is less than 3K, it's IMPOSSIBLE for it to contain a virus, end of story.  Also, regardless of what antivirus and/or antispyware you run on your system, I highly recommend running potentially infectable file types through an online multi-virus scanner.  I NEVER trust just one virus scanner no matter how reputable it is.  I also highly recommend using Sandboxie with any files or programs you have the slightest bit of concern about, ESPECIALLY keygens, cracks, etc..  Even if the program was infected, it would trap the infection in the sandbox, isolating it from your file system and protecting you from infection.  

I've only been working on PCs in the IT field since the days of tape drives and 360K floppies though, don't take my word for it.  "
,popeye013,2012-04-07T15:52Z,"Well, no offence, but i don't take your word for it, as it was me it happened to, not you, and for someone that claims to have the experience in the IT field you do, you should know just how far advanced things in this industry have become, so much so, that the size of a file is irrelevant as a virus can be included in something minuscule. 
You can infect an old Nokia 402 if you know what you are doing, with just a text message, thats an old mobile phone..  "
,popeye013,2012-04-07T15:54Z,"But anyway, if you want to download this, do it, its fine, but the txt file gave me an issue, thats all, it can be unchecked if you pause your torrent client or whatever you use, and terminate the text file if you have a concern. "
