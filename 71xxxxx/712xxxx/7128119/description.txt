Eastern Horizons
Directed by Bryan Smith.

The first ever adventure sea kayaking film which comprehensively explores North America's eastern sea board, this is also the exciting sequel to Pacific Horizons.

Documenting the entire length of the East Coast from Florida to Newfoundland, Eastern Horizons aims to blend the rich history and culture of the Atlantic with world class sea kayakers, idyllic destinations, incredible wildlife and compelling stories of people who's lives are deeply connected to the Atlantic Ocean.

From paddling the wildlife rich swamps and mangroves of the Carolinas to the icebergs of Newfoundland; from surfing the "zipper" at Tybee Island, Georgia to playing in the tidal flows around Nova Scotia's Bay of Fundy; and from capturing the iconic urban landscapes of New York City to the remote fishing villages of Quebec's north shore, Eastern Horizons will inspire paddlers and non-paddlers alike to get out and explore the ocean!

Length: 78 minutes, with additional 30 minutes of extras & outtakes

WINNER! - "Best Sea Kayaking Film" at the 2009 Reel Paddling Film Festival.
