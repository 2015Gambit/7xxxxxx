AmericaΓÇÖs favorite exterminators are back for more unexpected on-the-job adventures as they travel across the country in the fourth season of A&EΓÇÖs hit real-life series, Billy The Exterminator. The all-new season sees Billy hit the road for the first time, in search of challenges that are bigger, better and badder than ever. Whether heΓÇÖs going after giant pythons in the Florida Everglades, wrestling 10-foot gators in Texas, chasing a herd of razor-toothed javelina in Arizona, or fighting off an aerial attack by 30-pound geese in North Carolina, Billy comes to the rescue with humor, compassionΓÇª and a whole lot of attitude. Billy runs Vexcon, one of Louisiana's busiest pest removal companies, with the help of his brother Ricky, whom he describes as "just as crazy as me," his father Bill Sr., and his sassy mom Donnie, who runs the office.
