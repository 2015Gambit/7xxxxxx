only problem is the shift of sound and audio"
,Khyrian,2012-04-11T00:52Z,"Audio is brutally clipped and distorted in loud scenes like on almost all ""BRRiPs"" of this movie, probably derived from a screener or something. A: 4/10. People giving this 10/10 on audio have no idea. Video is also clipped (black bars at top/bottom) and has significant color loss. V: 8/10"
,Blondi4000,2012-06-18T02:45Z,A/V 10 MY ASS!!!!!  It is way out of sync.  I have tried 3 others with the same problem.  DOES ANY FUCKING BODY KNOW HOW TO UPLOAD?????
,Blondi4000,2012-06-18T02:46Z,And most of the comments on the others' Immortals uploads say they are having the same kind of audio problems.   FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!
,osriccc,2012-09-20T18:30Z,And you wanted me to even check the sample myself? Look at those comments above.
