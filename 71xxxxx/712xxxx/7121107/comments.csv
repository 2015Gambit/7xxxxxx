,balter,2012-03-22T19:49Z,consrv.dll trojan?
,balter,2012-03-22T19:57Z,"setup file seems to include a skidrow.exe (trojan installer?!) 

I deleted the skidrow file and the trojan alert was gone."
,1451,2012-03-22T20:20Z,can't install. installer says yesterday-en-fr-data001.bin is missing.
,khobQc,2012-03-22T23:30Z,"Antivirus auto-delete so i disabled ESET NOD32 and then, same as user:1451 yesterday-en-fr-data001.bin is missing"
,Pimpmylurker,2012-03-22T23:37Z,Thank you very much. What about the little update proposed at startup ? Is it worth something missing ? A chapter or else ?  
,lindatexel,2012-03-23T11:38Z,"lot off work for nothing, there is NO Key, so I can't  come in, for the rest it works fine but if there is no key and pass word ( is asked)  its useless."

,Torbax,2012-03-25T13:45Z,Hey! I just downloaded the game within 2h and thats all good and stuff but when I fully installed the game and patched it with the crack in the skidrow folder all I got when I started the game was a Black screen with the sound of rain...than some weird Opera singing and then the game shuts itself down... O.o when I press space I hear a *clunk*  but the screen stays black... help!?
,tankaranka,2012-03-25T20:07Z,"@Torbax
I had the same problem initially. Find PSConfig.exe in the install directory, and reset the resolution to your monitor's default. That worked for me. Hope this helps

I have a problem of my own though: the first scene seems to be ok and I can explore it, however when I enter the car the game crashes or simply goes black. Anyone had this same problem? Do you know a fix? thank you"
[T],nystrand,2012-03-26T13:53Z,canÂ´t get past the first scene how do i do to get through it?
,FranckN000,2012-03-26T18:15Z,"@tankaranka
go to PSConfig.exe in the game folder and change the settings and it should work fine."
,tankaranka,2012-03-26T18:53Z,"@FranckN000
thanks but I already did that, and while that did fix my first issue (black screen), the game still crashes with a program error when I try to enter another location from the first scene (the car on the right)"
,tankaranka,2012-03-26T18:59Z,"a small note on my last comment: by program error I of course meant application error (of the ""memory could not be read"" flavor). sorry, my system isn't English"
,B3winged,2012-03-27T21:22Z,"Downloaded - Installed normally - Copied crack from Skidrow folder - Played the game from start to finish without issues. Great torrent! Really awesome game for fans of the genre, a bit short unfortunately and perhaps a little bit too easy."
,vdecarli,2012-03-28T05:18Z,"I have the same problem as tankaranka mentioned. Please, can anyone help us to solve the crash problem in the firts scene of the game?
"
,gogz316,2012-03-30T08:08Z,"excellent torrent! fast download, simple installation, works perfectly on winXP SP3...
what's with that update at the start of the game? any new content? should I install it or the crack won't work anymore?"
,Marqoz,2012-03-30T22:57Z,"Damn! Looks like a good game, but I immediately get "" entry point alSource3i not found at openal32.dll. Help, please, what should I do? Thanks in advance, I hope. Marqoz"
,Marqoz,2012-03-30T23:20Z,"I fixed it. I went to windows/system32 and found the openal32.dll was three years aol. and next to it was openal32.new with todays date. I changed the name of the old dll to ""old"". and changed .new to .dll and it works fine now. Whew!"
,neuroryuu,2012-03-31T04:53Z,how see de pass of .rar??

,Kahdrill,2012-04-02T11:46Z,"Is it safe to update the game, or will the crack stop working?"
,orinvee,2012-04-03T10:46Z,It was crashing on me (same as others) so I ran the update and now it asks for a serial # to activate it (offers a link to buy one)...I'm going to try to re-copy the skidrow files but I'm guessing it won't work. I'll try to report back.
,s1raz1,2012-04-06T16:55Z,Help.. help... idiots... learn to crack a game then dl from TBP
,anonymous82882,2012-04-07T04:52Z,"you can finish the game in less than 3 hours (quite short for a 3 gig game).also in some part of the game(in the warehouse), why do you need to wrap your hands and punch through the glass to get the axe when you have a wood with a roundcutter? and in the beginning, why not just use your cellphone instead of getting a toy receiver and exchanging it with boris. idk about the update. this is just a game review though. but i'm a fan of skidrow.all his game uploads work for me."
,DffeD255,2012-04-16T18:36Z,seed seed seed 153 seeds and i dl with 15 kbps .. wtf guys pls seed
,druhklam_orbowetsch,2012-04-25T13:24Z,Many thanks!!
,TehForkinator,2012-06-08T12:28Z,"Guys, I don't think it's worth downloading this game.

The game is f**ked up, both the story and the game itself tbh. After playing for a few days, my inventory disappeared, and then the game crashed. And now every time i run the game and load the game keeps crashing. It's messed up.

The update fix this bug, and other bugs also. Could someone please upload the cracked new version of this game?"
