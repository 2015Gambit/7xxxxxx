Life is good."

Have a safe weekend!"
,thunderbum,2012-03-23T21:39Z,"I didn't see your comment above me, Annoyme - I don't usually check comments before posting.

Please accept my apologies if I came off sounding rude... that was never my intent :(

I'm delighted to hear your Dad is doing well - it's always such a relief when someone you love comes through surgery with flying colors and looks healthy again! :) :)   Life indeed IS good! :)

Have a terrific weekend both of you! :)"
,Annoyme,2012-03-23T21:49Z,"ha!

I know enough about you here to know that you don't do rude!

It was cancer, but the oncologist says it was very early development of the tumor - combined with the surgery, has a 65% chance of no problems for at least 10 years.

He said he rarely has seen cases with such good odds over the 45 years in practice.

I feel like I hit the lotto."

,koniev,2012-03-23T22:26Z,"man, I wish we have such freedom of speach here in Poland, like you guys have down there. Our mainstream media (heavy governmetal/liberal) is just trying to silence TV Trwam from oposition. Its conservative catholic TV. EU is shutting down analog ground TV, and replacing it with much more digital stations placed on ""multiplexes"". So you just have to have old aerial and decoder for radio streammed ground digital TV. Our government have KRRiT commision, whitch has decisive power on, who gets concession > who gets 1 place for 1 channel on ""multiplex (multiplex in an old analog 1 channel radiofrequency space). So, as you can see cable is going down. Satelite gonna be irrelevant... if you could get free digital tv by radiowaves. And mr. Dvorak and mr. Luft from KRRiT made such rules, to give places to all mainstream media and made sure that tvTRWAM didn`t get none. 2 milin Polish citizens have sended their petitions to government institution KRRiT, and in every major cities theres big marches in defence of patriotic TvTrvam, constitution - whitch sais about kind of freedom of speach and pluralism in media. Right now radio, newspapers and .. f)) everything is  supporting progresive Donald Tusk regime. Its like Berlusconi media in Italy. God bless You, Rush!"
