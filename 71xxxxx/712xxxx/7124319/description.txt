"Kidnapped By Danger"

Liz's scripted version of Jack and 
Avery's love story leaves Jack confused 
and frustrated by his feelings for 
Diana. Meanwhile, Jenna and Tracy 
attempt to beat Weird Al Yankovic at 
his own game, and Kenneth gets an 
unexpected new job at NBC. 

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
