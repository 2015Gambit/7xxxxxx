Or possibly also #3-Post Race? Having this split into 6 parts is inconvenient and unnecessary I think. If there is a good reason for it please let everyone know!"

That's OK, I have software that can join .mkv files into larger pieces as long as the specs are the same.  Everybody also remember that most video players have a feature called a ""playlist"" that plays files in whatever order you like with minimal delay?"
,shreddir,2012-03-24T20:50Z,"One more thing, Sky Sports unlike the great BBC coverage everybody got used to the last couple of seasons is a commercial network with a bunch of advert breaks that determine when Hannibal segments his files.  If you think that's bad, you should see how much worse it is for us having to watch the garbage Speed Channel broadcast here in the U.S!"
