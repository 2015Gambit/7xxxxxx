,Munchkinpuncher,2012-03-23T07:47Z,Great quality thank you!
,oldtimer48,2012-03-24T01:17Z,"YIFY thanks for sharing, amazing quality crystal clear, A/10, V/10, M/10, any chance of you doing ""War and Remembrance"" miniseries?"
,Ajube0476,2012-03-24T13:16Z,Oh look another horrible compressed pile of garbage.  There is no point in uploading a movie in 1080p if you are going to squash the bit rate down so small that the movie just ends up a blocky pile of crap. Just upload the 480p version because this is pointless.
,Ajube0476,2012-03-24T13:19Z,"And to you people commenting v10 crystal clear BS, are you sucking this guys dick? or are you watching his crappy uploads on an iphone?  Because these movies look like shit on a large HDTV.  And there is no fucking point in watching 1080p movies on a screen smaller than 42 inches."
,oldtimer48,2012-03-25T07:19Z,"ajube0476, buy yourself a new tv mate, your comments are uncalled for and completely inaccurate"

Everything you just said in your comment only proves that you are a Retard. And my point remains valid, 1080p rips compressed to this size have a very low bit rate. Why do you think he does not list the bit rate in his descriptions? hmmm? That is the only reason the files are so small. There is NO point in downloading 1080p if you are going to compress the quality out of it, it will only look good on a small screen, and than WTF! is the point of 1080p?! 1080p is for LARGE screens you Retards! Do some research before you bash me, because doing so only makes YOU look foolish and stupid. Not me. 

p.s. You are the one who needs the new t.v. if you think this looks good on a large screen. Or maybe you need to get your eye's checked out and invest in some glasses if you can't see how ""blocky"" and artifact-ed these super-low bit rate encodes are. If you knew anything about video encoding I would not even have to argue this. But it's clear you are ignorant."
,Punisher_Bay,2012-03-26T02:09Z,Ajube0476 - compressed? YES bad quality? no.. don't be a dick..  go download a 10 gb 1080p film and be done with it.  No reason to bitch about YIFY.  We all know what it is.. go fuck off ya twat.
