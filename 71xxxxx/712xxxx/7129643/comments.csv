will be going to my personal block list

and anyone connecting to me with bitlord bitcomet or
transmission or any other weird client other
then utorrent will be blocked
that includes utorrent ver less then 2.x
some still using 1.6 1.7 and 1,83 out there with
poor UTP support

azure and mac utorrent and bittorrent all seem good
so far

im finding these arent sharing the data and slows
it down for all

http://digiex.net/guides-reviews/guides-tutorials/application-guides/937-enable-update-ip-filter-block-list-utorrent-ipfilter-dat.html

all have a read

this is how Im doing it..
I made a ipfilter.dat in the program data area
and just add found ip from peerlist to it
x.x.x.x
right click on peer list then go update ipfilter.
person is then gone from the list :_)"
