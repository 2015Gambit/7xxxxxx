,shahabakhavan,2012-03-23T13:20Z,thank you 
,theMRnate0,2012-03-25T01:36Z,"hey, i am about to download this, but i was wondering why the file size is so small compared to every other torrent, thanks"
,ryzy,2012-03-25T10:45Z,"@theMRnate0

Kaos - Magic and hours of unpacking :)"
,theMRnate0,2012-03-26T09:58Z,"@ryzy

,svfiluto,2012-03-26T22:21Z,I got this torrent and don't know how to play the game now.  Can anyone let me know what to do to play it?
,ryzy,2012-03-27T08:28Z,"@svfiluto

1. Copy content of torrent to folder where you want to have game.
2. Run ~unpack~.bat and be patient
3. To play game run iw5sp.exe from game folder (something like that i don't remember but it's only one .exe file in game folder)"
[V],gansuk,2012-03-27T11:07Z,aww did you remove our install.exe? lol
,ryzy,2012-03-27T15:16Z,"Yeee, but i think now i wasn't  well-thought-out but it works anyway. I promise i get better :)"
,svfiluto,2012-03-27T17:02Z,"I think I already ran the unpak and have it in the right folder.  Now i have 5 folders (extras main miles players2 zone) a security certificate, 10 kaos paks, and a language and localization file.   Since I have 10 kaos paks does that mean it didnt unpak correctly? and If so how do i get the unpak back to unpack them?"
,ryzy,2012-03-27T17:54Z,@svfiluto as i wrote in description instalation files (all in torrent) dissappear after instaling if don't and if you are using vista/7 it is probably instalation rights in system fault. Just run game if works you don't need kaospart files in game's folder anymore.
,pakistanzindabad,2012-03-27T23:38Z,"is it the full game in this size if it is please reply because of the file size i think you must have taken out videos,weapons or other things please reply "
,kronem,2012-03-28T06:59Z,"I've got an error when i launch the game ""couldn't load image 'warning@file'"""

,divendi,2012-03-31T00:41Z,"How do you play this online? The game opens fine and the campaign runs fine, but when I try to play online it brings me to the purchase screen on steam.

Help would be greatly appreciated."
