Description: Re-teaming with The Sound of Madness producer Rob Cavallo (Green Day, My Chemical Romance, Kid Rock) Shinedown presents its fourth full-length album ΓÇô the bruising, unapologetic, and totally kinetic Amaryllis.

Six songs on Amaryllis feature a 30-piece orchestra, including ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm Not All RightΓÇ¥ ΓÇô ShinedownΓÇÖs first-ever song to incorporate horns, which drive home the manic intensity of its subject matter. Another highlight is ΓÇ£Bully, ΓÇ¥ which finds Smith addressing the tormentor in question in the strongest possible terms. ΓÇ£Amaryllis is probably the most rock and roll album weΓÇÖve ever made, ΓÇ¥ Smith says. ΓÇ£WeΓÇÖve always been a rock band, and I didnΓÇÖt want to lose sight of that. I told everyone the album had to do three things: It had to show sophistication in the songwriting, it had to show musical growth within the band, and I had to push myself to go places lyrically that I had never gone before.
