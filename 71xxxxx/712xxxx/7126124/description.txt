                   Oxford ATPL Aviation Meteorology CBT


Oxford Aviation Training and the Met Office have developed a self-teach, media-rich, interactive Computer Based Training (CBT) course of theoretical and practical Meteorology aimed at both student and qualified pilots. Instruction is up to JAA ATPL level, but as the course is designed for beginners it is suitable for CPL and PPL pilots, too.

The main aim of this CBT is to give pilot-oriented training in Aviation Met theory and to teach pilots to use this theory to interpret met forecasts and reports in order to plan safe and expeditious flying sorties. The secondary aim of the CBT is to teach pilots how to extract and interpret met information from the Met Office's web site.
