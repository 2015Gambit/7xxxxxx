In this edition of On the Edge, Max interviews Chris Cook; a former oil market regulator. Cook is an independent energy analyst and a former oil regulator who has the latest on energy markets. He talks about the soaring oil prices and its impacts on the weakening US economy.

He argues that the US market is in a free fall and the US has piled debt on debt. He also comments on the role of investment banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sacks, and the military threats against Iran on the oil price.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
