I didn't know much about Bandcamp until I looked up who produced "Heaven Is A Ghetto" for Hodgy Beats' Untitled EP & picked up on Thelonious. Since then, I took an entire day going through other producers on there who were just producing instrumentals & I was surprised to find out how many talented producers were out there that are just trying to get by. Due to finding these guys, I actually decided to pay $21 for 4 instrumental albums, the first time I've paid for an album since '04.

Though I'm uploading this for free of course, you can always google the artist & find their bandcamp website to support them by buying their albums which are generally just about $1-10 a pop or even for free.
