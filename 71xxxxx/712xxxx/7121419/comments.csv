As it says, its dvd quality, and no pesky logo in the corner. I'm surprised I'm the first to thank you, but whatever, I guess people are busy."

I just have a small technical question since you ripped these yourself: why did you choose 24 fps? I thought Australian TV -- and their consequent DVD releases -- used the PAL system, 25 fps. Thanks again!"
