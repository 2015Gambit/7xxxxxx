I don't know if I did something wrong during installation or of it's the program..? Probably me but I just thought I'd let everyone know."
,Blickity,2012-06-05T07:42Z,"I've been getting that too.  I can start the program up again, so it's not a huge deal, but I'd like to know what it's contacting so I can add it to my host file block list."
,pocket_pc,2012-06-16T21:52Z,"About blocking winstep in firewall 

Note:  if you want to use weather or email module, Your out of luck as these modules need WinstepXtreme.exe to check the net to update, However this seems to allow winstep to also check validity.
There is no one cracking this software except Nemo-crack.ru every release they put out is quickly black listed as there not too hard to find since their the only ones cracking so not worth downloading these copys from nemo.
They use an inbedded incription for activation which has to be emailed to you, so no one can create a key gen for their software, so dont bother downloading any so called keygens they dont excist there (FAKE),
Their early versions however did use key gens, I think ver7 maybe, not sure what versions did though

But If you want to block all access to net for winstep add these exe's to your fire wall rules.
winstep directory is in  C:/Program Files /winstep or Programs Files(x86) /winstep if using 64bit.
I would first uninstall winstep and remove all events of winstep from registry then add these exe's to your firewall then install winstep.

Winstep are asking way too much for their program, after all it's just a fucking poxy icon toolbar it's certainly not worth 25 to 30 euros or pounds that's 1/3rd of the cost of windows 7, get real man!.
Are you fed up of this crap just download free Rocketdock ""google it"" it's not as packed as this copy but it's a free dock you can add your own icons and mess around with it a bit, give it a try, you might be just as content with that one.
good luck.

Thank you Piratebay for putting up a fight against the net censorship. 

LONG LIVE PIRATEBAY
You have certainly earned your place in history.
Best Regards."

It's Workshelf.exe that updates modules and serial
not WinstepExtreme.exe.

peace out!"
,Bubboleth,2012-08-22T23:06Z,"Perfect, thanks a lot :)
I like winstep xtreme!"

That however is spot on. And that is why piracy is a legitimate means to balance out the greed of companies and corporations. It allows you to financially punish the unscrupulous ones while maintaining your ability financially support those who deserve it.
