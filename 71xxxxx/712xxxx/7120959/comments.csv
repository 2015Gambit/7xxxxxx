,Wayne_Brady,2012-03-22T04:01Z,"I started streaming this from my Macbook Pro to my PS3 via a media server, and 2 minutes into the movie a message popped up saying something to the effect of ""this file is protected by _____"" and that streaming was not allowed, Wayne Brady has downloaded and streamed many movies and such a message has never popped up, wish I could remember what it said it was protected by but I was stoned then, and I'm stoned now."
,MalikeW,2012-03-22T05:20Z,"@Wayne_Brady, its a Sony picture.  You'll never be able to stream a Sony film pirated through your ps3 thanks to the Cinavia protection.  Those bastards."
,pjones452,2012-03-22T05:39Z,do not click those links they're BS!
,aceman2010,2012-03-22T07:24Z,@wayne  use showtime and you can watch in on your ps3

,aceman2010,2012-03-22T07:28Z,did you erase my comment
,some-young-guy,2012-03-22T10:38Z,"@ Wayne,

Sony uses Cinavia to screen out potentially pirated materials.  Some files that are in other formats PS3 also doesn't recognize.  My latest torrent has the PS3 sever and the codec app that enables PS3 to view the blacklisted formats but it still doesn't get around Cinavia.

The best solution I hope for is for someone to edit the PS3 operating system to exclude Cinavia, then release that OS right here on the bay. "
,lentheric,2012-03-22T12:52Z,"change the file name Wayne Brady, might be enough to bypass cinevia protection. :)"

,(hotrodder),2012-03-23T16:53Z,"this is the second time downloading this movie from 2 dif. sources, to try to get it to convert & burn with convert X but stops error saying audio discontinuity
 is there something i need to do to get this movie to burn on a DVD?
 i have other DVD burn programs just never had any problem with X before?
 convert DVD did burn but tried to play in my Sony blue ray player it came up with same bullshit Wayne_Brady had.
 anybody else have a fix or is everybody just streaming through the laptop?
 thanks all and keep the movies coming!
 and as far as bad ratings and bashing on cams who gives a shit as long as we have movies to watch when people do not have money or the means to get out to see at the show, watch the cams then burn dvdrips when they come out to watch over and over again!
jmo
p.s. i have quite the collection of programs and flicks so I'll be uploading a shitload of great quality soon"
,cragfrumtarn,2012-03-24T09:49Z,"a 6

,Rush,2012-03-24T09:56Z,"@(hotrodder)... go to settings>audio>tick... ""do not fix audio discontinuities""

this will override the encoder trying to fix the unfixable... sound will be left as original source quality."

,jmoney80,2012-03-31T06:52Z,The audio is very off by about 6-8 seconds and is missing big chunks of the audio as well.. Wait for a better download!
,REDEYESWOLF,2012-03-31T08:44Z,"To people who want to play this on your ps3, only one step, change the movies name to 1 or something random. That is the reason I don't fuck with sony, they suck major balls.."

,ShakeJunt,2012-04-09T01:18Z,Someone needs to ban these faggots who keep posting their shitty websites in the comments section on every damn torrent. Fuck you and your foreign websites!
,Rush,2012-04-09T22:25Z," @hotrodder (Off topic..) .... I assume you're previewing your encoded ConvertX TS file on VLC BEFORE you burn. 

If the TS vid file has problems this is where you want to catch it... not making coasters.

Don't need to change the file name for home dvd players or VLC playback. 

 ConvertX has a good built in burner but IMGburn is better and has wayyyyy more options...

Save all ConvertX files to location of choice and load from there to IMGburn, instead. Tick ""verify disk"" after burn to check for errors... if there is one it will show in log 

Thanks again LegendET... for all the effort... all disrespectful pukes should try and upload their own better copies or shut the fuck up, posting crap about a trusted and verified quality up-loader.... this guy spends hours of work tweaking these before uploading to PB....

Just like yo momma used to say ""If you don't have something nice to say shut the fuck up you little brat""

Like most cam-rips.... this is a little dark... tick up brightness/contrast a few clicks on your player  when playing cam-rips and it helps considerably."
