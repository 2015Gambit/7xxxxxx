Test Drive Unlimited 2

This solution maybe isn't perfect but seems to be working and saving
But i don't promise anything

1. Copy "Test Drive Unlimited 2 - Rip" folder to path where you want to have game (instalation files dissappear after instalation)
2. Run setup.bat, press ESC to close stupid animation and any key to continue
3. It takes 15-20 to instal
4. Run Test.Drive.Unlimited.2.Update.5.exe
5. When it asked for path navigate "Test Drive Unlimited 2 - Rip" folder (it must install files inside this folder - the same folder as games files folder)
6. Run UpLauncher.exe or desktop shortcut
7. Let game patch (57 mb)
8. When you will be able to click "Play" close this window

NOW IMPORTANT 

EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO PLAY GAME DO:

1. Copy TestDrive2.exe from "old" folder to game folder
2. Run UpLauncher.exe or desktop shortcut
3. Wait untill word "Play" will be in white color - don't close this window, don"t click play
4. Copy TestDrive2.exe and paul.dll from "crack" folder to game folder
5. Now click play
