Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday, March 21 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with author, political commentator, and journalist Jerome Corsi about a retired postal worker who delivered mail to Tom and Mary Ayers in a Chicago suburb in the late 1980s and early 1990s and claims to have met Obama in front of the Ayers home. Corsi is the author of numerous books, including The Late Great U.S.A.: The Coming Merger With Mexico and Canada and Where's the Birth Certificate?: The Case that Barack Obama is not Eligible to be President. 

Alex also talks with Russell Blaylock, M.D., a nationally recognized board-certified neurosurgeon, health practitioner, author and editor of the Blaylock Wellness Report. Dr. Blaylock is the author of Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills and Health and Nutrition Secrets That Can Save Your Life.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
