NOTES: 
Ok folks here a nice R5 this time of the vow and for once Line audio. 
The video wasn't ripped by us so credit too lum1x for sending it us would 
have ripped from the dvd-r ourselfs,but theres a wait time on it at the time 
of doing this. The video we haven't re-encoded it ...just syncd some sweet 
line audio to it. Audio has a few static noise a couple of times but last like 
1 secs but otherwise after some lovin in AA its came out nice and in sync with 
1 cut not 174 like some who butcher the bloody things 

Enjoy folks .....oh best part is the end sound track IMHO
