found a way to install latest official patches up to 1.1.06, while waiting 4 scene releases. decided 2 share. this torrent is with all needed patches.

1. install update 1.1.02 by SKIDROW.

2. install update 1.1.03

3. browse to your King Arthur 2 install directory.

4. go to folder "Cfg", then "Soldier"

5. delete these 5 files: 
living_statue_t4.cfg
living_statue_t5.cfg
colossus_t3.cfg
colossus_t4.cfg
colossus_t5.cfg

6. install all other updates.

7. copy/paste torrent's "Cfg" folder to your King Arthur 2 dir. "Yes to all", when asked for replace.

8. play the game.

additional info: I have to guess what Paradox changed in these 5 files. Living statue ones was easy, patch notes form 1.1.04 tells us: "Living Statue Tier level fixed" ΓÇö and thats exactly what I have done (+ small rewarded XP correction). What's the deal with colossus (those were corrected in 1.1.05 btw) ΓÇö beats me, so if somebody have official game patched to the last ver, he can just seed these files to all of us ;)

and yeah, I know 1.1.07 was released today ΓÇö just couldn't find it available 4 download anywhere O_o.

peace brothers!
