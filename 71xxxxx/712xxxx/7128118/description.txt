Arabic Phonetic Keyboard for windows 32 bit 64 bit 95, 98, 2000, XP, 7

Keyboard Generator says:

The package for Windows 2000, XP and NT 4.0 contains two keyboard layouts: Arabic ASDF Eastern with Arabic-Indic digists and Arabic ASDF Western with Arabic-European digits.  The package for Windows 95, 98 and ME has only one keyboard layout: Arabic ASDF, which is like Arabic ASDF Western but without Farsi yeh.

Type Arabic by sound or shape:

 
Some mappings are arbitrary but not completely:

 is placed next to  because they look and sound similarly. 
 and v are dental sounds:  is interdental and v is labiodental. 
Alif maksura is mapped onto Shift+Y and Farsi yeh is mapped onto Shift+F.
