The latest sandybridge socket 1155 i5 cpu's are quad core but the original clarkdale socket 1156 i5 600 series cpu's like the 650 and 680 are dual core, the lynnfield S1156 i5 700 series are quad core.
It could also be a laptop using Sandybridge as the i5 mobile cpu's are dual core. 

check me out, my geekness is nasty."
