,DeviledGod,2012-03-25T13:19Z,Thanks for this nice torrent! Please upload from BBC HD if you can...! It would be great!
,Putte075,2012-03-25T14:41Z,"Thx dude, The HD quality was very good nd i hope u will keeping downloading races to with same HD quality :) much appreciated"
,nex-s,2012-03-25T16:55Z,"I really hope we see the race uploaded in HD 720p before the simple rip... I don't mind to watch the qualification in a worse quality, although I would much prefer HD, but the race definitely has to be watched in 720p. I don't care if the download time is an hour or two longer as long as the file is uploaded before the simple rip one, cause I hate to see it up there and wonder if the 720p one will be uploaded later or not :D"

Just the way it should be!
Hi-def, good sized HD file, not squeezed ridiculously small.
Thx very much"
