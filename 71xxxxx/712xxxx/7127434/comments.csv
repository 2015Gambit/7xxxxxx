,whmxtra,2012-03-25T23:39Z,"Haven't been there in ages but from memory it's actually 1 part of a bigger school that also has divisions for music, acting etc.

The buildings the use to show the outside of the school are actually used for music and theatre, while the actual dance stuff is a bit down the street."
