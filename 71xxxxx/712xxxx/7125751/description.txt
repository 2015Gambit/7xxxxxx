More down-to-earth than Auntie Mame, Driving Lessons imparts the same simple, but enduring messageΓÇöbe yourself. 

In the directorial debut from screenwriter Jeremy Brock (Mrs. Brown), 17-year-old Ben (Harry Potter's Rupert Grint, sluggish yet sympathetic) lives with his vicar father, Robert (Nicholas Farrell), and pious mother, Laura (Laura Linney), in a tree-shaded London suburb. 

Soft-spoken Ben is a shy teenage boy trying to escape from the influence of his domineering mother. His world changes when he begins to work for a retired actress.
