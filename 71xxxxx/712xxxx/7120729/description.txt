About the Film


Urbanized is a feature-length documentary about the design of cities, which looks at the issues and strategies behind urban design and features some of the worldΓÇÖs foremost architects, planners, policymakers, builders, and thinkers. Over half the worldΓÇÖs population now lives in an urban area, and 75% will call a city home by 2050. But while some cities are experiencing explosive growth, others are shrinking. The challenges of balancing housing, mobility, public space, civic engagement, economic development, and environmental policy are fast becoming universal concerns. Yet much of the dialogue on these issues is disconnected from the public domain.
Who is allowed to shape our cities, and how do they do it? Unlike many other fields of design, cities arenΓÇÖt created by any one specialist or expert. There are many contributors to urban change, including ordinary citizens who can have a great impact improving the cities in which they live. By exploring a diverse range of urban design projects around the world, Urbanized frames a global discussion on the future of cities.┬á
