For some of them it doesn't matter if they grab another dudes upload and ""claim"" it as their own. Wich technically, in the name of filesharing freedom, is NOT wrong. 

But ANYONE who claim they ""own"" the rights of uploading for instance a movie released by Warner Brother, is mearly retarded. One would hope that those particular specimen WOULD get caught.

Thus all the multiple copies based on one release, really, at least by the time the screener is released."
