,bigough,2012-04-11T14:44Z,"Need to seed this one, 15 connected at 0% last night.  I had a problem with my first torrent too, if your status says ""downloading"" instead of ""seeding"", here is what to do. First delete the torrent from your client (utorrent/bitorrent). Next

File-Add Torrent- click on the .torrent file you created-open.

On the top ""Save As"" - choose the location of the .exe file you are trying to upload. The folder will appear blank but as long as your .exe file is in there it should start seeding. "
