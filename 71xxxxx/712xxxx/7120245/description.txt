  Sachin is an engineering graduate from    
  a middle class Mumbai family, but his     
  passion is for the world of cinema. He    
  is dreaming and planning for a future     
  as a director, when he sees Jessie. It    
  is love at first sight for Sachin.        
  However, Jessie is from a strict          
  Malayali Christian family, and her        
  parents would never approve of their      
  romance. The other problem is Jessie      
  insists that she doesn't want a romantic  
  relationship, but wants only to be        
  friends. Of all the girls in the world    
  why did Sachin have to fall for Jessie?
