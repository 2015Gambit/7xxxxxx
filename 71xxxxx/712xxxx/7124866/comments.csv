Getting Better UT Performance

The first thing to do is to increase your minimum desired framerate. UT will try to meet your framerate requirements by subtely dropping detail levels during complex scenes and fire fights. The default MinDesiredFrameRate is dependent on the speed of your computer. If you have hardware acceleration and a 300MHz or better CPU the MinDesiredFrameRate defaults to 30, otherwise it is 20. The higher the framerate, the more aggressive Unreal Tournament will be in eliminating excess special effects and detailing. To change the value open Advanced Options and click on Display. There will be an edit tab for the MinDesiredFrameRate variable. The change will take place immidiately.

If increasing MinDesiredFrameRate doesn't help, try decreasing your texture detail levels in the Preferences window. You can also try lowering your screen resolution."
