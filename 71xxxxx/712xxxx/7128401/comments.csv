,ivanhoe68,2012-03-24T18:58Z,"How is this even possible? I preordered this on steam, BUT i have to wait until the 29th mars to play the game. ItÂ´S so wierd that it`s here on TBP, since the game lacks a fysikal copy. 

PS. If you like this game BUY it! 
In other words, try it and buy it. "
,RegginRellik,2012-03-24T19:35Z,"the game is bad, deal with it
the original creator of rayman doesn't even know about this game"
,ham82,2012-03-24T19:56Z,"heard on nfohump this game blows chunks. prepare to RAGE and smash your controller repeatedly since the game lacks character like rayman 2&3 had and bosses are needlessly brutal. Just sayin, be aware."
,minkaihsu,2012-03-24T20:53Z,Wow! How do you get the game before it release!?

 R.i.P DYCUS

 We would like to take the oppotunity to thank our dear friend dycus for what
 he has put not only into rzr but also into the whole scene.

 Everyone in our group knew he had a hard life, being in hospital all the time.
 But he still managed to do amazing things. He was the one behind many Trainers
 and without him even our few releases wouldn't have seen the light of day as
 he was the best game tester you could think of.  Always full of new ideas and
 willing to learn everything in coding.

 For our historical scene friends we will show some steps in his scene career

 1. Dycus joined DBC (Da Breaker Crew) which doesn't exist anymore.
    He tried to crack, code and learned every possible thing you can think of.
 2. Dycus joined Lz0. That was when DBC died because of the risk it was to be a
    public web cracking group.
 3. Dycus joined SoulDrinker and Deviance as a tester. He always told me that
    this was the break in his scene life as he met a lot nice people there and
    which to have stayed there. But as we all know these two groups died as well.
 4. After a long time of no activity he joined a new group called Ascension.
    At first it was really great, he learned to train games even better.
    But soon he realized that the leader was playing a false game. He stole
    unreleased games from another group and he decided that this was not right
    and against his morals so he quit.
 5. Dycus however couldn't stop and he released a couple of Trainers on his own
    under the group ReUNiON. But being the only group member is boring and so
    he came to the one and only Razor 1911 as tester and coder. We enjoyed coding
    installers, trainers and helped the others fix coding problems. Until one day
    when he didn't came back to ircd....

 We hope you finally found your peace, as you deserve it. You've been struggling and
 fighting the cancer way too long. Nobody deserves to be struggling with an desease
 like that. We won't ever forget you in the group. And we would like to give our
 condoleances to your family and friends, who also have to miss you! Thanks for
 being yourself and thanks for all the good talks you had with anyone who wanted it.

 We miss you! And we will never forget you!

 Your friends in Razor1911 and Razor1911 Demo Devision!



 -[thoughts about him from his old groups]---------------

 Dear Dycus,

 For a long time you did a great job in our humble family and with your knowledge,
 your effort and your great sense of humor! You were one of the key factors to how
 we managed to grow and prosper. Therefore it's a sad day when we now learned that
 you have passed away. Cancer is never a good thing - it's a long and hard battle.
 Sadly you didn't make it...
 You've been a great inspiration to us, to what you can achieve if you just set your
 eyes on the goal? And with great determination one can always succeed with ones
 dreams. You did... Even though our ways parted several years ago we still kept in
 touch, you always had  your thoughts on how things evolved, quick wit and always
 there with some kind remarks. The world will not be the same without you -
 the empty spot you leave behind cannot easily be filled...
 We will miss you...
