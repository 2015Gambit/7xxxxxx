Greatest Hits (2008)





Formed in 1967 by former Motions guitarist Robbie van Leeuwen, the Dutch quartet Shocking Blue originally had a lineup of VanLeeuwen on guitar, lead vocalist Fred DeWilde, bass player Klaasje Van der Wal, and drummer Cornelius Van der Beek, and the initial configuration of the band had a minor homeland hit with ΓÇ£Lucy Brown Is Back in TownΓÇ¥ a year later in 1968. Things really got moving, though, when DeWilde was replaced by sultry singer Mariska Veres, whose sexy presence and solid singing brought the band a second Netherlands hit, ΓÇ£Send Me a Postcard,ΓÇ¥ and then a huge international smash with ΓÇ£VenusΓÇ¥ in 1970 after the group had signed to Jerry Ross' Colossus Records imprint. Although Shocking Blue's albums (1968ΓÇÖs Shocking Blue, 1969ΓÇÖs At Home, 1970ΓÇÖs ScorpioΓÇÖs Dance, 1971ΓÇÖs 3rd Album, 1972ΓÇÖs Inkpot, 1972ΓÇÖs Attila, 1973ΓÇÖs Dream on Dreamer, and 1974ΓÇÖs Good Times) featured progressive rock elements and inventive arrangements thanks to VanLeeuwen's writing and production skills, the band was essentially marketed as a pop singles unit, and while they scored several subsequent hits in their homeland, none of the groupΓÇÖs releases approached the massive saturation success of ΓÇ£Venus.ΓÇ¥ Veres left Shocking Blue in 1974 to pursue a solo career, and while there have been various reunions and different touring incarnations of the band over the years (including a version fronted by Veres in the '90s), its creative history ended then. VanLeeuwen later re-surfaced in the folk/jazz group Galaxy-Lin, while his most famous composition, ΓÇ£Venus,ΓÇ¥ continued to see play on oldies stations. Veres died of cancer in 2006 at the age of 59.
