,Tormanoid,2012-07-07T01:55Z,"Great torrent!

Sadly audio is running a bit too late.

You can fix this on Media Player Classic, go to Play > Audio > Options. Tick the box next to ""Audio time shit (ms)"" and in the other black space, type -333

Normally MPC doesn't let you write the minus first, so type 333 and then add the minus at the beginning.

Once you finished watching the film, remember to deactivate this by unticking the box I mentioned."
