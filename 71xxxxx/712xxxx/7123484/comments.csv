It took about 20 minutes for the first connections to come in, but they petered off to 0 very quickly.  I'm working on the issue, at any rate"
,no1453,2012-03-22T21:48Z,"Figured it out.  I only had my starting port forwarded by my router, instead of a range from there upwards...
Uploading fine now."
,no1453,2012-03-24T18:34Z,"I've been using all my bandwidth for this torrent for a few days now, as soon as I see the number of seeds get to 3 I'm going to drop out.  Please keep seeding to at least 1/1 ratio!"
,no1453,2012-03-25T00:28Z,"Just wanted to bitch, don't know who's listening... so far three leechers have reached 100% and decided to cut and run without seeding, leaving me as the sole seeder.  What the hell is wrong with people?"

Yes, there are lots of pigs at PB, but take heart. This was a massive amount of work for you, and it is most appreciated.

I have a complete 5, 6 & 7 if need the missing eps.
