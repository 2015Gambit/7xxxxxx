the shows are interesting what they find and
how much they can make..
but those squeaky usa voices do grate on the
ear drums!"
,DngnRdr,2012-03-22T21:23Z,"The official site calls ""Ice Cold Gold"" this episode 101 and doesn't have an earlier episode.

There was apparently a preview episode early this month but I understand it was made up of clips from upcoming episodes - can't confirm that though."
[V],psspss,2012-04-07T07:40Z,"hmm maybe some guides have it wrong like tvrage
as spike tv says ice cold is the first episode

many places calling e01 something else money and cash perhaps it got renamed or promo name
thats the confusion

as usual someone f-ups the naming and guides
everywhere LOL"
