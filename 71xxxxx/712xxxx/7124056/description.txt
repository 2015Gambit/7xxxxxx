Female monarchs have been the norm, not the exception, in recent British history. In celebrating her Diamond Jubilee, Elizabeth II emulates her great-great-grandmother Victoria ΓÇô and, together, these two queens have clocked up more than twice as many years on the throne as the four kings who came between them. But all isnΓÇÖt quite as it seems.

Modern monarchs donΓÇÖt rule: they reign. When Elizabeth II puts on the Imperial State Crown to open Parliament, itΓÇÖs the words of her government that she speaks, not her own. To find a much-travelled great-grandmother ruling England (as the kingdom governed from London then was) we have to go back more than eight centuries, to the extraordinary Eleanor of Aquitaine, queen of both France and England.
