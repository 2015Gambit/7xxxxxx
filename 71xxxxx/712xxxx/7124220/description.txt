"Contemporary Impressionists"

As the study group returns after winter 
break, Jeff reveals that he's been seeing 
a shrink and he's on anti-anxiety 
medication. The newfound confidence leads 
him to experience debilitating levels of 
narcissism, which Britta tries to help 
him manage. Meanwhile, over the break, 
Abed developed a celebrity impersonator 
habit that has saddled him with debt. In 
order to help Abed shed his debt, the 
study group dons costumes and goes to 
work for Vincent (French Stewart) as 
celebrity impersonators - appearing in 
character at a Bar Mitzvah celebration.
