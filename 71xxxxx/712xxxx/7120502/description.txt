*** In Honor of Roger Hodgson's Birthday Today 3/21 :) ***

"It's Raining Again" is a song recorded by Supertramp and released as a single from their 1982 album ΓÇªFamous Last WordsΓÇª. Its writing credits are given to Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson, members of the band, although it is a Hodgson composition. Like John Lennon and Paul McCartney of The Beatles, Hodgson and Davies joined writer's credits from 1974 until 1983, when Hodgson left the band to pursue a solo career.

The five members of Supertramp made brief cameo appearances in the video for the song. At the beginning, John Helliwell is a street musician playing an alto saxophone (his appearance lasts for roughly three seconds). Before the first chorus, Dougie Thomson appears as the bus driver (this was the last filmed video where Thomson would appear with his then trademark moustache and beard, as he would then be permanently clean shaven for the video of "My Kind of Lady"; his screen time was three seconds). Hodgson plays the guitar-playing bus passenger (he is in the video for the briefest time out of the band members, one second). Lastly, Rick Davies and Bob Siebenberg played the two pickup truck rednecks (their appearance lasts for close to an accumulated ten seconds).

All of the voices on the studio version of the track were done by Roger Hodgson, although in live versions on the accompanying Famous Last Words tour John Helliwell and Scott Page sang some of the harmonies on stage. During the last part of the song, kids sing the old nursery rhyme "It's Raining, It's Pouring".
