,Silvak,2012-03-26T06:59Z,"Agree on that the quality is weird, also seems that the last half of the comicis a bit out of order."
,Xpatriated,2012-03-26T09:29Z,"I thought that too, but I couldn't be sure, so I didn't alter anything.  If you can come up with a rearranged page order, I'll be happy to put up a new torrent."
