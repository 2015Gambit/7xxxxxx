ccproxy.exe is part of the Symantec's Norton Internet Security suite. It lets you set up Internet sharing, and also implements firewall and access control features such as site blocking (restricting access to certain sites) and content filtering (which lets parents block inappropriate web pages). It needs to be running for the Norton software to work properly.
