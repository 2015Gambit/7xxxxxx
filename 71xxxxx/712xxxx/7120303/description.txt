------------------------------


This popular Court TV series explores the corruption, greed, and scandal hidden beneath the wealth and prestige of America's upper class. Who better than bestselling author and Vanity Fair columnist Dominick Dunne to expose the sordid secrets of America's rich and famous? Already an established Hollywood producer in the late 70s, Dunne left the world of Los Angeles to live a simpler kind of life and work on his writing. A personal tragedy soon gave Dunne a clear purpose: to draw attention to those members of high society who believe their wealth and privilege exempt them from legal repercussions. Eager to hold these parties accountable for their mistakes, Dunne has dedicated his time to exploring the seedy underbelly of fame and celebrity ever since.

When investigators are tipped off by a local garbage hauler, Ruthann is arrested while playing in a charity golf tournament.
