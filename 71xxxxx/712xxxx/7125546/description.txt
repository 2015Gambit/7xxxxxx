BACK TO THE BIBLE WITH WOODROW KROLL - 60 SERMONS
--------------------------------------------------------------

I was pleasantly surprised to see interest in my "Grace Church With Pastor Troy Dobbs" torrent.  Truthfully, I really hadn't expected anyone would be interested in 60 radio broadcast sermons.  But because of that interest, I thought I'd share yet another; this time "Back To The Bible" with Woodrow Kroll And Tami Weissert.

Back to the Bible is an international Christian ministry based in Lincoln, Nebraska, using radio, the internet, television, and other media. Back to the Bible is non-denominational and describes itself as "sharing the Gospel message and helping Christians grow to spiritual maturity through Bible teaching and engagement ... dedicated to leading people into a dynamic relationship with Jesus Christ."

Today's torrent contains 60 bible inspired sermons preached during the 2012 calandar year.  Each sermon is about 25 minutes long.  Details of all 60 topics can be found in the thread further below...
