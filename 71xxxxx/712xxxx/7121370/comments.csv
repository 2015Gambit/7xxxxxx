Great A/V quality, considering that this was made 40 years ago. Looks that the appearance of blu-ray (like once the dvd) is a good chance to see (or see again, in much better audio-video, for the elder ones) the films that once defined our youth, and Silent Running is one of those... I don't expect that to be the same for the younger chaps, it might seem a bit obsolete - graphic mostly - but for me it remains one of my favorite films from my youth..."
