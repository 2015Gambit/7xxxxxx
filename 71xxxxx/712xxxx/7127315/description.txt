"This tape was heavily circulated through independent music stores in the mid 1990's. The first 7 music videos are just that music videos. The same ones you will find on Closure. The last segment on here is a fake snuff film ghost directed by Peter Christopherson of Coil. It involves a young man playing basketball, who is abducted and tortured (teeth pulling, blow torch etc..). He is forced to watched the Broken album videos, pinion, wish, happiness in slavery etc... 

The real gem here is that the victim is castrated while a torn sweater wearing Trent Reznor covers his eyes on the TV screen in front of the chaos. All of this going on while the song Gave Up is playing. The video ends with the killer being hanged/decapitated for his crimes followed by a similar fire "n" from the broken album. 

The snuff parts are shot straight to vhs. This being such a heavily bootlegged video the quality comes out so poor it is almost believable. 

Trent talks about this movie briefly on the "Disturbed" bootleg. Check it out!"
