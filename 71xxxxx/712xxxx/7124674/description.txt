Outside a movie premiere, enthusiastic fan Peppy Miller literally bumps into 
the swashbuckling hero of the silent film, George Valentin. The star reacts 
graciously and Peppy plants a kiss on his cheek as they are surrounded by 
photographers. The headlines demand: "Who's That Girl?" and Peppy is inspired 
to audition for a dancing bit-part at the studio. However as Peppy slowly 
rises through the industry, the introduction of talking-pictures turns 
Valentin's world upside-down.ΓÇª
