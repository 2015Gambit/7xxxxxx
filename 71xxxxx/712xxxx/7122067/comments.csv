,moebiss,2012-03-24T17:53Z,"Gringo living in Brasil here, one reason I live here is because Americans like to bitch about everything yet at the same time be complacent regarding everything.
I'm now realizing this bitching includes pretty much everyone in the 1st world.
I'm currently downloading on my little 2meg connection. In about 8 hours I'll be watching this free movie and be quite happy I didn't need to wait or pay for it, whether it is DVD quality or not.

I must say, to the users rating, you should get a little more realistic with your numbers. This is certainly much better than what has been around but its a far cry from great. Critical, constructive reviews makes the world a better place.  "

,oasisfleeting,2012-03-29T08:59Z,a 2 gig movie that isn't getting a 10 rating means that this shit is encoded poorly or just looks like shit. I'm going with poorly encoded. What ever happened to the true scene releases where people actually knew how to compress a film?
