NOTES:

Ok here we go folks ....lets get straight too it.THis is by dvdscr standards is poor and IMHO looks like a poor TC etc..
However we tagged it dvdscr because we've seen ,been told things too it is so......

Right source files were not nice at all for ...dull,colourless,bad ivtc and more...oh also seems overcropped ...like haywire was 
Fixed what we could and had too blend the fields aswell becuase even though i fixed the ivtc ...it was still interlaced a bit.But doing this meant lost some sharpness,but did add some back in at the end.
Went for a large size because its 2hrs 11mins with AC3 448 ....it needed it,otherwise would look even worse.

Anyways ...retail due in around 2-3 weeks i think,but until then .....here ya go.
