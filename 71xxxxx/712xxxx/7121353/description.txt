Edmund Goulding - Nightmare Alley (1947)

English dual audio (with commentary track)


When creative people get to make the movies they really want to make, strange things can happen. Flush from his success with The Razor's Edge, Tyrone Power lobbied Darryl F. Zanuck to play the lead role in this creepy, very anti-glamorous movie about carnivals con games, fake mentalism and predatory spiritualism. The film abounds with unpalatable people and unpleasant ideas, and its sordid carny background seems authentic. Even more disturbing is its very noir atmosphere of moral defeat and universal venality. In other words, Nighmare Alley is one special movie.
