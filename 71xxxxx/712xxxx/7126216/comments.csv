With win7 x86, free space 14GB, all previous updates for sims3 installed."
,Mini_grt,2012-04-11T22:23Z,@zumurud make sure your antivirus isnt blocking setup...
,zumurud,2012-04-12T18:58Z,@Mini_grt: Thank you for the comment. There's no anti-virus software or other anti things in my system...and I'm sure there's no virus...
,Valionek,2012-04-15T19:56Z,Emm...data3.cab just can't be unzipped...

,Invictus_80,2012-05-12T19:15Z,Did you add a product key or keygen? If so where did you you put it so that we can find it to hactivate it? It's asking for a product key.
,Invictus_80,2012-05-12T19:23Z,"NVM, found it. Thanks for a great download. "
,Annimoose45,2012-05-13T10:33Z,"Hi,

I feel really stupid but I am struggling, so 
I thought I'd ask anyways. I get to the part where it says to now run the ""setup.exe and download the update"" but I am really confused because I thought I just extracted from the setup.exe? Basically I cannot ""run"" that and am really confused as to what I am doing wrong....can you help me please? 

Thanks!

...And yes I have done this before haha...."
,Annimoose45,2012-05-13T10:57Z,Just kidding. I was able to figure it out. Butttt how do I get past the activation code? Is there some sort of key gen I am missing?
,Annimoose45,2012-05-13T11:04Z,Okay wow. I apologize. I found the keygen in the Fairlight folder.... this is really embarrassing and I am sorry for the trolling. Also I should apologize for the future in case something else goes wrong and I feel the need to ask an asinine question... thanks though!  
,Mini_grt,2012-05-14T20:27Z,"@Annimoose45

,discobiscuitss,2012-06-01T01:24Z,"when i get to the installation, it stops and tells me insert disc containing data2cab? i've tried different paths that have the file but then i just get another error"
,Skakus,2012-06-14T02:40Z,How do you play it after you install it? It asks for a disk.
,dmilroy,2012-06-20T03:07Z,"Does this need to be mounted? If so, how big is the actual file thats mounting? just curious about disc size!"
,dmilroy,2012-06-20T06:57Z,after pressing the install button i got an error immediatly! The error number was  (-5006 : 0x80070003) please help!
,dmilroy,2012-06-20T19:06Z,never mind i got it to install but when i try to start a new game a message pops up saying it stopped working! please help
,notanjjj,2012-06-30T03:03Z,Hi. I'd like to ask how to fix a problem extracting this. I keep getting stuck at 90%.
,RavynSnape,2012-07-08T21:13Z,"Hey, first off, I want to just thank you for the torrent. :)  I love TS3 and I'm really looking forward to this game and the next episodes.

But I am having a problem with it.  I've run the super short setup.exe and have extracted the Data1, 2, and 3. But every time I try to open the files, it says ""Cannot open the cabinet file.""

Can you tell me why it's doing this? My firewall has this under the exceptions, I run Kaspersky.

Please respond as soon as you can.
Thank you very much in advance.  :)"
