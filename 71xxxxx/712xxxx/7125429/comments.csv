,Tattybogle,2012-03-23T19:01Z,Extended? You mean there's more of this crap?
,ofpirate,2012-03-24T01:49Z,appears to be something wrong with the aspect ratio
,str1nger,2012-04-02T19:34Z,does this have english subtitles for the Na'avii sections of the movie?
,Jeffwa,2012-04-27T18:30Z,"I couldn't get this to work. When my TV put the images together they were the same image. As in it looked like a perfectly clear picture without the glasses. Then about 20 min into it half the screen would have double images, even with the glasses, and the other half would still be in focus. Yes I set my TV to over/under. I didn't watch past 15-20 minutes. 

Anyone else have this issue? "

,baretoof,2012-05-02T05:47Z,thanks for this
,whatami12,2012-06-01T04:25Z,"This is NOT a full 3D extended version.
It is actually the THEATRICAL version in 3D
with 2D scenes cut and pasted from the extended version.
Don't think a true 3D extended Blu-ray exists yet!"
