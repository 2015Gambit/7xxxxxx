***STAR WARS - REVISITED***

The definitive version of Star Wars, created by Adywan.

Every annoying glitch, jump-cut, wonky light-sabre, dodgy special effect etc has been repaired, along with an awesome new surround sound remix and even completely new special effects sequences.  Amazing re-edit of Kenobi and Vaders battle... the list goes on and on.  Has to be seen to believed, as everyone says 'this is what the Special Editions SHOULD have been'.

If you can, get hold of the 4gb+ full DVD9 version - plays just like an official Star Wars disc with menus etc. and the picture is the best I have ever seen in the DVD format, full-stop.

Also note that this .AVI version is compressed so doesn't do justice to the amazing work that's been done - to reiterate; get the full DVD9 version!!

As ever with Fanedits, make sure you own a copy of Star Wars before downloading this or any other alternative version.
