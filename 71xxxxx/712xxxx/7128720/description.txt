Show Description


From the Infowars web site:

Alex talks with Jeff Lewis, the quadruple TSA amputee who was singled out for abuse by the TSA at Phoenix's notorious Sky Harbor International airport. Mr. Lewis was interviewed byjournalist and editor Patrick Henningsen last week. 

Alex also runs down the latest news, including Ron Paul's "Give Me Liberty" moneybomb, the strange "mini-quakes" in the midwest, and Sarkozy's call to lock up people who dare surf "extremist" websites on the web.
