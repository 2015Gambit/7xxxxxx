,s8n,2012-03-24T05:25Z,"Don't thank someone who uploads more torrents in 5 mins than you have uploaded since you graced PB with your royal presence. TV TEAM has done more for everyone here at PB than most other uploaders and is repected and valued. 

wizzkid1970... Feel free to GO DIE now you ungrateful lil fuckin INBRED."
,cragmire,2012-03-24T12:39Z,wizzkid is right. I downloaded it and it wont play on any media player i have on my computer. First time this has happened when downloading a TVTeam torrent...
