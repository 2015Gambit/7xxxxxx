,Wayland-Yutani,2012-04-01T00:20Z,I am having trouble with a very flaky server and a slow upload speed ( 50 kbps ) please bear with me as I am trying to fix this.

,KillTheNoob,2012-05-22T23:02Z,"I want to punch the marketing douche in the face who said they should call it a Quadrilogy. Let's break it down, Quad-Ril-Ogy. The ril is from Tri which is three, not four or more. Trilogy rolls off the tongue but quadrilogy doesn't. It's a fucking Anthology after three and yet somehow this word is now a part of English."
