Filmmaker Lutz Becker sifted through hundreds of yards of archive and newsreel footage from 1918 to 1933 for this objective, journalistic look at the rise of the Nazi Party and Adolf Hitler. Eschewing narration and interviews, this bit of living history shows how the party preyed upon the crushing poverty that had swept the country since the end of the Great War, coaxing its people with a new solidarity in the mounting military regime.
