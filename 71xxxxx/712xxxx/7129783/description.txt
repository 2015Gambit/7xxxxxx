
This is the full run of Anything But Monday

14 issues from July 1986 to May 1993

A couple years ago I did a torrent that said "complete" but I was wrong...
I didn't think volume 1 would ever turn up, and I didn't know volume 4 existed.
Then I met Frank Nora, one of the creators, and he gave me all of the issues I
needed to complete the series.  Thanks, Frank!  And thanks to you too,
jackryder, for introducing me to Frank.

Volume 1 number 1 was done when the creators were still in college.  It's a
single sheet of paper folded in half and copied on a Xerox machine - four
pages.  By the 9th issue it had grown to 20 pages and then, with the first
issue of Volume 2, it became a regular size comic book and gained national
distribution.  Volume 3 was a single oversized 84 page magazine.  Volume 4 was
the last issue ever, downsized and back to 8 pages.

It's juvenile fart and pee-pee humor at its finest, but it's a good deal more
than that as well.  On page 11 of v2 n2 you'll see that the best way to
damage the World Trade Center is with a 747... 11 years before it happened.
