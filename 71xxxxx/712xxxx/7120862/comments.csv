,KatieBaer,2012-03-22T03:52Z,"A great camera version!
I saw this in theaters and I NEVER laugh out loud (especially in theaters) but this movie mad me laugh about the whole time.. sooo I figured I would get a cam version even though I usually wait.
I think it's a great version (a little grainy)
@ the beginning someone walks in front of it but that's it that I saw.. I didn't watch the whole thing because I'm beat and I have to get up early for work, but I just thought I'd leave a comment. 
Thanks For Uploading this! :)"

,MJI,2012-03-23T07:07Z,"Watching as I type this.....
Since nobody else likes to give actual ratings anymore I will...

VIDEO: 6/10 For a Cam it's really not that bad at all, very watchable.

AUDIO: 4/10 Very clear, not muffled at all...Only problem...Seems to BE WAY OUT OF SYNC

Thanks HeroMaster, appreciate the up."
,MJI,2012-03-23T07:22Z,"You know what....I take that back. I played the file on my flash drive so maybe during conversion it made the audio off track. I switched to Windows Media and it's actually on sync sooooo. Final rating:

Video 6/10 (Pretty clear for a cam, cropped on top and bottom but nothing really noticeable)
Audio 6/10 (Pretty clear for Cam Audio, not hollow sounding or off sync.)

Thumbs up, HeroMaster and I apologize for the 1st comment. 

This is an above average CAM to be honest, good work fellas."
,MJI,2012-03-23T07:25Z,"Let me re-do my original post. 

I played this on my flash drive and something must have happened because it through the sync way out of line.

I tried on Windows Media and the mouths and audio are perfect. Sooo my new rating

VIDEO: 7/10: This really is a nice cam, cropped on top and bottom but nothing major

AUDIO: 7/10: Fantastic for being CAM Audio. On sync, no hollow sounds, etc. 

To be honest, this is a very good 1st CAM of this movie. Props to HeroMaster, download with confidence ladies and gentleman"
,MJI,2012-03-23T07:41Z,Well....off sync again at the 13 minute mark...This is getting annoying...Anyone else with this problem...Whole CAM is PERFECT besides this audio issue...damn shame
,skritzen,2012-03-23T09:36Z,Best quality yet. very watchable.
,Teabagger5000,2012-03-23T12:30Z,"Good download

,movie_No1,2012-03-24T13:06Z,great work Heromaster for me the quality was pretty close to flawless. 10/10
