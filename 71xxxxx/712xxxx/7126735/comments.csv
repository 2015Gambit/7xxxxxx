,Betolami,2012-04-04T02:57Z,Works thanks.
,Insomneac,2012-04-09T06:02Z,But I like the eye patch?
,tomatoegg,2012-04-11T20:42Z,It worked for me. On the other hand the one uploaded by scene4all did not. 
,rock53,2012-04-23T07:28Z,This patch works perfectly with http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7034734/Alan_Wake-SKIDROW. Tested 100%. Completed the game and both DLCs.
,thcfreak666,2012-04-25T23:35Z,Thanks !
,seed513,2012-05-12T21:15Z,"Im getting an IO Failure : createDirectoryFailed
I want fix,please help!"
,MLO89,2012-05-17T22:15Z,"Only difference between this one and the scene4all is the addition of the ""AlanWake.exe"" file. So if  you've already installed the scene4all crack, all that is needed is the ""AlanWake.exe"" file and you're all set. Eye patch gone. The_laser didn't need to upload the whole crack again."
,Viciously,2012-05-24T10:50Z,Thanks.
,TaZeRz,2012-08-01T11:22Z,I don't understand what the heck is an Eye Patch and why do I need it over the regular 5341 update?
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-08-02T11:31Z,any chance of getting the latest update?
,EnGxSoLiD,2012-08-02T22:59Z,@TaZeRz the Eye patch thingy is when the game detects that it is cracked you will see Alan Wears an eye patch (Their own way to say please don't crack the game^^).
,hotsparks,2012-08-15T14:14Z,do i need to have previous updates installed for this? thanks
