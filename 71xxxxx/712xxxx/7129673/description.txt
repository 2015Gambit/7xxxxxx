Notes:
I ripped this ISO file directly from the DVD using AnyDVD.  ISO files archive every byte of the original source, meaning you get identical audio and video quality.  This also means you can create an exact, duplicate copy of the original DVD (although the copy protection has been removed by AnyDVD, so anyone could copy it again from this ISO).

ISO files can be opened by many disk-burning programs, or unpacked by WinRAR.  You can also mount the image file to a virtual DVD drive using DAEMON Tools Pro, so it's as if you put the actual DVD into your computer.

If you have any questions, please post them in the comments section.  This is also my first time uploading a torrent, so don't bitch if something is wrong...
