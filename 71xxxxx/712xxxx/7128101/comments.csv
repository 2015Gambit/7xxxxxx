So much effort and time has gone into these that it is just cheap not buying it. It is worth every cent buying it. I would not usually be one to say things like this but after watching all of the special features on the series, so much dedication has gone into it.

If any movie deserves your money it is the Lord Of the Rings Series, BUY IT"
