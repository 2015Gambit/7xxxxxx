Attention: All fans and friends of Terence Mckenna
 
Part 3 of The Terence Mckenna OmniBus 2012 will be released today, 22nd March at 22.00 GMT+2
 
"Part 3 - Who are We?"
 
	Another 12 minutes, 12 seconds and 12 frames closer to the Singularity, 'The Eschaton', the 26,000 year Mayan Long Count, The Apocalypse, (Nostradamus), or the end of Kali Yuga. Meantime, social networking continues to be the glue which binds global consciousness to the Arab Uprising, Nuclear Safety issues, ecological devastation, Earth changing natural events, or whatever you think is of the utmost importance. Back in the moment, whatever happens, the future isn't written, at least not on any kind of a
