The film explores Iguacu National Park on the Brazilian-Argentine border, home to
some of the largest waterfalls on Earth. The story follows animals native to this
Atlantic rainforest habitat, including kamikaze-like swifts who live behind and
fly through the thundering masses of falling water, as well as spotted jaguars and
a family of coatis. The film also shows the struggle of park rangers to defend 
this threatened reserve from opportunistic exploitation.
