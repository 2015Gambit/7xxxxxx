,Adesta,2012-04-10T19:37Z,"Some are excellent quality - 10/10 (I'm not fussed for the Disney watermark)
Some are sadly squished and poor quality (aspect ratio wrong?)

But my kids don't seem too fussed, and VLC soon sorts out the squishedness.

Thank you kindly uploader! I'll be seeding away for a good while yet."
