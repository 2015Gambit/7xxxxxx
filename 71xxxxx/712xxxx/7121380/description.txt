Gary Lineker introduces highlights of the midweek Premier League action as the battles at both ends of the table intensify.

Title contenders Manchester City were striving to maintain their 100% winning home record at the expense of Chelsea. City have fared poorly in this fixture, suffering defeat in 10 of the previous 14 Premier League meetings in Manchester, as well as losing 2-1 at Stamford Bridge in December. However, the likes of Sergio Aguero and Mario Balotelli will be looking to take advantage of Chelsea's uncharacteristically poor season, which prompted the sacking of Andre Villas-Boas as manager.

Like Chelsea, north London rivals Tottenham and Arsenal are striving for a top-four finish and Champions League qualification, but they faced obdurate opponents in Stoke and Everton respectively.

Elsewhere, three of the bottom five sides were playing, with QPR hosting a Liverpool side targeting a place in Europe, Bolton visiting Aston Villa and Blackburn taking on Sunderland
