,missyrocks18,2012-03-24T09:38Z,"Thank you! I usually buy the game because I like to a physical copy to load to my computers..but when I bought the Katy Perry set, the website incentive site is gone..:-(..Im glad I can get it through you :-) Thank you!"
,admz0r,2012-03-24T18:09Z,"@KiddyKat: no dude ,thats not the request section :) btw the Katy Perry outfit is inside this torrent...

@morgan90: yes you MUST install showtime for ""showtime stuffs"", because they not gonna work (they're in seperate folder). If you dont want to install that expansion, you can only get these to work:
-STPatricksDaySET:
-FutureShockMidCModNSOSET:
-SportswearCAS:"

,Edrialyse,2012-03-27T04:47Z,I can't seem to locate a ModsPackages in my Documents folder for Sims 3. Is that a custom made folder? And how would I do this on the Mac? Same process? For some reason after years I still can't get Sims 3 to play properly on my custom top-line PC rig.
,admz0r,2012-03-27T21:52Z,"dude just google ""how to install package files"" aight?..."

Thanks"
,Alibaster,2012-04-03T22:00Z,"Thank you so much Admz0r. I appreciate it Tons. I'll seed out 5 gigs of it. Hopefully People will still hit it. Being an uploader is such a thankless job. Hopefully you'll see this HA! Thanks again man, Think you should get a trusted status, because sims stuff is such a pain"
,archedmaid,2012-04-07T16:58Z,Did any of these have the Three Lakes content?

,Riovanes,2012-04-12T10:50Z,"The install seems to work fine, but when I go into the game, it still wants me to buy things like the Hypnotizer with ""Simpoints"". How can I just get the item?"
