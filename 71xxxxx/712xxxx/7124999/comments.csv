,lazonby,2012-07-25T00:25Z,"Whoever ripped this should never be allowed to rip another CD. Quality sucks for 320. If I had to guess, this was ripped in 320 from an already compressed source.

If you're going to do something, ffs, do it right or don't do it at all.

war59312, how about that FLAC version?"
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-07-25T23:39Z,"01. The fact that MALES are downloading and listening to this music makes me shake my head in disgust.
02. The fact that those same ""males"" would actually engage in a debate about the quality of said music makes me god-damn suicidal.

Download some Rammstein and grow a set of f**king testicles! You're all pathetic!"
,lazonby,2012-08-03T01:30Z,"So Watermelon, if KP is beneath males, why the hell are you even posting a comment on this page, much less looking at it?

Pwned.

And that suicidal thing? Well, good luck with that."
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-08-07T20:11Z,"@lazonby

The fact that you used the expression ""pwned"" merely proves, and cements, your status as a virgin.

P.S. Have a look at the tags. You will of course notice that ""Snoop"" and ""Dogg"" are amongst them. That, oh wisest of the wise, is how I stumbled upon this horseshit.
Now go back to your Warcraft (or whatever the fuck it is you people do), crank up your Lady GaGa and get back to being a pathetic virgin."
