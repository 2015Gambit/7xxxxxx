[T],esharoth,2012-03-24T19:19Z,"Something I realized just now: the game needs DirectX 9 to run and I didn't include it. I assume that most computer users already have it installed, but if you aren't sure and you get an error that some DLLs are missing when you try to start the game, then that's the problem. Download and install DirectX 9."

Only one question: Is there any difference between eXperience 112 and The eXperiment, other than different name?"
[T],esharoth,2012-07-23T17:57Z,"Nope, it's the same game."
