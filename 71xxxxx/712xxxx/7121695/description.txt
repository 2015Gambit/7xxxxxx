 In a quaint village of Haryana lives Miny,     
 a free-spirited tomboy who instantly wins      
 your heart with her bubbly personality.        
 Her father, Bhatti, runs an auto-rickshaw      
 business and is adamant to marry her off       
 against her liking to Sunny. The male          
 protagonist Viren, is a humble and ambitious   
 rickshaw driver working for Miny's father.     
 Bhatti, insecure about Viren's success,        
 sells of all the rickshaws where Viren had     
 carefully stashed his life savings. In an      
 attempt to recover his money from Bhatti,      
 Viren storms into Miny's engagement with fury. 
 This gives Miny the perfect opportunity to     
 escape her marriage and so she stages a kidnap.
 However, the kidnap goes all wrong and she and 
 Viren land up in Viren's family mansion.       
 Eventually, Miny's father arrives with the     
 ransom that she had asked for and takes her    
 back home. Back in Punjab, while she is being  
 married off to Sunny...
