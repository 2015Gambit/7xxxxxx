,Fragrah,2012-07-07T23:09Z,"This torrent DOESN'T have viruses and works fine, but you still need to update/patch it with the latest aRev files (go to their website for more info).

Greetings!"
,kussoja,2012-08-04T21:03Z,"This torrent is fine, but don't download the Alterrev updater.Download the Fourdeltaone from here> http://fourdeltaone.net/ 
Works with these files, you can even change your Alterrev version to this.I used Alterrev and it was stopping all the time on Win7...The Fourdeltaone version even has a lot of great features added.You can read everything about them on their site."
