I know lots of you people are mad about the ending in ME3. I won't go spoil it for you guys that didn't finish it yet, but I'll tell you this. If I remember it correctly, BioWare changed the ending very close to the release date, so that they could sell a DLC featuring a Prothean.
There's been some speculation about that they didn't get enough time to make it properly done. If so, it could explain why long-time fans are so disappointed about the ending. To you guys I can only say, Let's hope we get a DLC to fix this or BioWare fucked up this one really bad XD
I'd happily pay for a DLC that would give us a proper ending and maybe even make sense of all the things you do before the ending so it all fits nicely together :)
I think they talk about that process in this ""interactive-eBook-thing"" :)
Just download & install Adobe Air before you try installing this one.

Let's hope BioWare turn Paragon ;)"
