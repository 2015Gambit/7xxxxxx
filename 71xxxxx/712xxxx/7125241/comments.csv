,gratefulforthis,2012-03-23T22:58Z,"What's with all the 100%ers not uploading?

They're all offline! 

Download and piss off...seems to be the way, these days."

It would have to be a .rar to be password protected..."
,snowbirds,2012-03-24T19:13Z,"That movie poster Onstarring posted is the wrong one.  This movie doesn't star Adrien Brody...

Here is the real poster, but I have to say, if there is no trailer, and even the movie poster doesn't show anybody's face, then that is a BAD sign...

,gratefulforthis,2012-03-24T22:27Z,"This really is a piss poor supported torrent. Worst yet.

What's with all the 100%ers not uploading?

2 fucking days on a fast connection.

Waste of time writing this as the pricks who download, and fuck straight off, won't be back to read anyway.

In short...SEED YOU CUNTS!

,jongepier,2012-03-25T19:07Z,"yes I've got it
just watched a few minutes. Looks really good, sharp and sound is okidoki and I think the movie itself is also fine. I only saw the scene where some bad guys wanna trow a chick of a rollercoaster and that was looking good. Hopefully the rest of the movie is like that.

so A and V = 10"
,jongepier,2012-03-26T21:13Z,just watched whole movie. It's okay. Not a bad one.
