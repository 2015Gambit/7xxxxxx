However the installer sucks, took 10min to install the game... I hate you...

But yeah game works fine, saves and plays."
,pridex,2012-03-22T12:01Z,I'm running on windows 7 ultimate 64 bit. The game runs perfect except for the saves. I have tried everything I could find on google but nothing helps. The game never saves for me. Any idea how I can resolve this issue? Thanks in advance.
,pridex,2012-03-22T12:03Z,Sorry for the double post. I solved it. Thank for the great upload!
,NanoEntity,2012-03-23T02:11Z,"LOL you need to save it at the save stone, the game just dosnt save by itself.

It kind of sucks, but what ever, at least there are save stones you click and can save.

,Skaryn,2012-03-24T00:10Z,"The same as pridex happens to me.I can't save at all,even using the stones.When it does save,i try to load and says that the data is corrupt or it disappears when you get out of the saving screen.Can't find a solution anywhere.Not even on the Steam forum."

,IndigoAK,2012-05-05T05:36Z,"It's great that this is in English, but the fact that the movies are recoded makes it not worth downloading.  It's distracting to say the least.  I can only imagine they did this so the game would fit on a CD, but who in their right mind still uses physical media?"
,lbtgm,2012-05-06T09:53Z,What version is this?
