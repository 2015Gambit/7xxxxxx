War Documentary hosted by Alastair McGowan, published by Channel 4 in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

This gripping film tells the humorous yet heroic story of how a crumbling, Cold War-era Vulcan flew the then-longest-range bombing mission in history and how a Second World War vintage bomb changed the outcome of the Falklands War. Yet astonishingly, this story of one of the RAF's greatest modern feats has been downplayed into near obscurity by history. On 30 April 1982, the RAF launched a secret mission: to bomb Port Stanley's runway, putting it out of action for Argentine fighter jets. The safety of the British Task Force depended on its success. However, the RAF could only get a single Vulcan 8000 miles south to the Falklands, because just one bomber needed an aerial fleet of 13 Victor tanker planes to refuel it throughout the 16-hour round-trip. From start to finish, the seemingly impossible mission was a comedy of errors, held together by pluck and ingenuity.
