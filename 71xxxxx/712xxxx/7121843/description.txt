Introduction to The Cumulative works of Ian McLeod

At the tender age of 15 Ian McLeod refused to pay the council to read the plans given to them of a new room he wanted to build onto his motherΓÇÖs house. Eventually he gave them a plan of the best quality that he could draw, but refused to pay them to read it. And so started his journeyΓÇª

Throughout life, Ian has always tried to help people and assist them to fight against the tyranny that was being imposed upon them, at many times suffering reprisals because of this.

More and more and licences are imposed upon us all. Many of these can avoided.

Ian has taken the Department of Natural Resources and Mines to the Land Court and won! A book was written on that topic called High Treason 5, Who Owns the Water.

Things are getting harder and probably soon will be hard enough that people will start to take notice.

Perhaps by reading these books some will begin to do the necessary, lawful things to correct our country: if we all as Australians stand and unite things will happen!

Thank you for your time and patience.
