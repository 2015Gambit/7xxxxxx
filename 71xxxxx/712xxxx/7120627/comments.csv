Thanks for uploading the nice books!

Would you be able to find books by Kay Hooper?

I've had no luck so far (frankly, I don't know where to look!).  Thanks."

I just finished reading One Fifth Avenue and if you can find any more books by this author I would greatly appreciate it."

Thank you for ALL your posts (I am still going through them :X) I've recently acquired my first Kindle and I love reading on it. I've found your post very helpful. SO many books so little time :))

I was wondering if I could make a request. I am looking for this book: http://www.amazon.com/The-God-Factory-ebook/dp/B005I6IXPU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1332439822&sr=8-1 And anything by Michael Faust. I've tried looking for them myself but I've had no luck.

Thanks in advance!
Have a great day/ night ( wherever you are)"
