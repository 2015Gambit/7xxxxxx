,hedede,2012-03-24T11:46Z,"out of fucking sync fucking mp4's, some one put an avi for fucks sake"
,invisibilian,2012-03-24T12:27Z,"I don't understand why people will choose avi over mp4. for the same quality, mp4 is more compact, and it makes streaming on iPad much easier.

Thanks EZTV. Great work as always!"
,Toommm11,2012-03-24T13:01Z,"Perhaps because .avi can be play by EVERY DAMN PLAYER, and they don't have iPad and don't care."

,JoBur315,2012-03-24T17:13Z,"EZTV!  As always, fantastic job, and a much deserved ""Thank You"" is in order for all the work you do.  On a separate note, if anyone can help me out with this mp4 deal, I would much appreciate it.  My computer won't play em!  Have Xiph.Org and FFDShow codec packs installed, and still nothing.  Trying to stream to XBox as end result.  Windows 7 64 bit on Asus U50F"

,BBL2R,2012-03-25T12:19Z,"Most of my favorite TV Shows are being uploaded with MP4 format instead of AVI. I know it's more compact but the problem is Audio & Video are out of sync. I'm using Media Player Classic & far as I concern, I did install Code Pack."
,karvaka,2012-03-25T14:02Z,"BBL2R

,xpiras,2012-03-25T21:22Z,"FUCKKKk, it NOT WORK on p3 CPU....    550mb avi is work on p3CPU..

FUCKkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk"
,Cheyenne-tgy,2012-03-25T21:27Z,thanks.
,vreyhr676y,2012-03-25T23:47Z,"That 550 MB .avi was probably Xvid; .avi is a old container with many limitations and overhead, mp4 is modern and specially suited for MPEG4 video and audio as such, Xvid, but it's a lower quality MPEG4 video, H.264 (made best by x264 video codec) is the latest high quality high compression MPEG4. Also .mp4 container can have MPEG4 audio or AAC (aka mp4 audio, m4a) if it's HE the better, and if it's v2 even better, but the bit rate @HE v2 it has to be 128 Kbps at least.

So stop complaining about .avi & Xvid, those are OLD technologies

@xpiras: get a P4, DDR-400 RAM and a video card that can decode H.264 video, many old and used cards can do it, so this new system shold be cheap to upgrade.

Thanks for the torrent."
