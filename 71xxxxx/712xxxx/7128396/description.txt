                           DESCRiPTiON 

 
 Documentary in which Alexis Conran sets out to understand why some people view 
 gambling as a pleasurable pastime, while for others it is a compulsion that can 
 lead to ruin. He talks to members of his family about his father's obsession with
 betting, which led to his incarceration, and travels round Britain and to Athens 
 and Las Vegas to meet addicts and experts on the subject.
