,mrnow76,2012-03-23T14:06Z,Why would you need to crop an HD copy?
,mrnow76,2012-03-23T14:28Z,sample wont play on VLC player
,UN4G0TT3N,2012-03-23T14:45Z,Fake?
,dean2804,2012-03-23T15:06Z,It's cropped because it had Korean subs hardcoded. 
,morosanu_dani,2012-03-23T15:21Z,"ok,it's not fake but it's overcropped because of the hardsubbed corean.I guess no one cares about the subs as long as they see the whole image not a relation of 3:1(720x240).I have never seen such a stupid crop.
V:1
A:9"

,johnnydavidson,2012-03-23T16:50Z,"Wait so you thought people would like cropping the entire bottom, over a little blocking from the Korean subtitles?"
,thatdude5124,2012-03-23T18:22Z,thanks legendET but i will wait for the next..... anyone find another yet多
,isinaipodda21,2012-03-23T20:22Z,i'll pass on this one.. will wait for a better one.. thanks for the effort though..
,NiggerRapist,2012-03-23T22:27Z,"Don't download this, It's cropped like fucking mad. "
,j52,2012-03-23T22:35Z,"well done legendET!
Croping takes away part of the picture, but unreadable subtitles (in a language you dont understand) is very distracting. I had to it my self a couple of times to be able to enjoy movies in cases like this"
,AllzCool123,2012-03-24T13:31Z,Will check out the uncropped copy. This looks stupid after cropping.

,Wu_Lord,2012-03-24T17:18Z,"I never read anywhere where it says the that uploader was the person who cropped this. Sure it may not be the ideal dealio - but if said uploader just released what he was given I think it's more appropriate to thank the guy for even putting this out there.. Even if it's just for haters to bounce on. ""CROPPED"" Perhaps I am missing something... Wotevs. Peace"
,TaZeRz,2012-03-24T20:59Z,WHAT A FUCKIN DUMBASS YOU CROP OFF THE BOTTOM OF THE PICTURE TO AVOID KOREAN SUBS? FUCKIN STUPIDITY YOU MADE THE MOVIE WORTHELSS VERSUS JUST A SLIGHT ANNOYANCE WITH SUBS.
,mrholmes,2012-03-24T21:33Z,all of you act like you paid for this. also 720 is considered hd resolution. so all of you SHUT THE FUCK UP. and then go suck your daddies dick.
,f_2_o,2012-03-25T01:22Z,"Thanx 4 the upload.. Good quality, small size."
,BlueEyedCrow,2012-03-25T14:12Z,"People need to take a step back and realise they're not paying for these titles... Whether cropped, subtitled, out of sync or what... YOU'RE NOT PAYING FOR THEM!! - So what right do you have to put people down for effort they've put in to providing something for free?! - If you don't like the quality, move on, rather than slating others!"
,uncas52,2012-03-25T16:35Z,"Good video quality,shity movie.I just hope Cage payback all  taxes he owes  so he newer make something like this."

you are both right and wrong, what's the title - ""Ghost Rider 2 - Spirit of Vengeance 2011 HDRip XviD-cropped FTW,"" The source is HD, which is ripped to DIVX / XVID and 720x240 is actually ok for a HDrip to Xvid RIP"

,felesar2,2012-04-21T17:32Z,"I thought magnet links were supposed to be harder to track? Apparently not. Comcast letter, third one this year, looks like I'm losing internet. Lucky if I'm not in court soon. Thanks everyone, it's been a wonderful 10 years or so, but I'm afraid I'm done here thanks to this one."
,MasslV,2012-04-21T22:16Z,"@felesar2
Magnet links have nothing to do with tracking. You can blame yourself for not knowing what the fuck you were doing or for listening to idiots. Magnet links save the site bandwidth and server space. They also make it easier for proxy websites. And instead of getting the torrent file from thepiratebay, they make you get the torrent file from other people, just like the video file.

The other reason you are getting letters is because of who you voted for in government combined with how corrupted you have let your government become. Because it seems like Hollywood is your real unelected government, and politicians just their puppets. Really again, only yourself to blame.

Your kids will thank you for not changing anything about it and passing on the problem to them. I can't blame you, revolution is dirty and a lot of work. Good thing there is burgers and tv to keep these problems out of your head.

It seems freedom of information, or other human rights like that don't exist where you live (look it up, it's something people have fought for, against their government). If you had this they could not disconnect you or you would be in trouble with online tax, email for work, wiki for kids learning in school, ect and other life necessities. But your government doesn't think that is a right you should have.

And to be real, i don't think you have earned them either. On the plus side however. These disconnections seem to be ridding the internet of idiots...

And yes, i do think you are everything that is wrong with the western world. Lets check how long it takes for you to forget about this post. Just to prove my point."

Nothing is going to happen to you. Your ISP is forced by the copyright owners of the movie to send out those messages, they're more like scare tactics. All the info you need is here;
