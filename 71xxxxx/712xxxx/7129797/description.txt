From authors:
This first issue of Today Software Magazine. The initial idea of having this magazine came up from the need to connect software engineers, project managers, HR specialists and create a virtual community that promotes new ideas and good practices based on people experience. Most software engineers get the news from global portals, specific websites or from inside their companies. There are few ways to find out what others like you are doing, most of the time we are reading guides, APIs or books.
