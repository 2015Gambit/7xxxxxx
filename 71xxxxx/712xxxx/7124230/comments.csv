,Danljohn,2012-03-23T03:32Z,Thanks from a Canadian in Colombia
,saskrotch,2012-03-23T06:11Z,Has anyone explained why everyone seems to be switching to mp4 lately?
,Xorakka,2012-03-23T06:34Z,@saskrotch: Because it is 100 times better. AVI is outdated and dying.

,XWinderI,2012-03-23T14:34Z,Thanks man xD
,segasager1138,2012-03-23T23:48Z,"Bitching about the format being .MP4 and not .AVI is like someone giving you $100 and you complaining because it was in singles. Fucking lazy idiots, update your gear and get with the program. VLC and PS3 have zero problems with .MP4 playback and they look fantastic on HD screens."
,lollerpops,2012-03-24T03:32Z,"I'm all in support of MP4 and usually have no problem playing them with Media Player Classic, but with this the audio is slightly out of synch. Same as last week's episode. Are other people having this problem?"
,lollerpops,2012-03-24T03:41Z,"OK, so in MPC under Audio options I set 'Audio time shift' to 80 ms, and now the audio is in synch. Yay."
,zeeeQ,2012-03-24T04:14Z,"MP4 and MKV are better than AVI, if your Xbox 360 can't handle the quality then badluck get a good PC."
,LiarKing,2012-03-24T16:38Z,"mp4 is way better, because you can play it on your computer AND your mobile phone"
,firexninja,2012-03-24T20:24Z,thank you!
,shWit,2012-03-26T04:36Z,MP4 is better
,ust2,2012-03-30T03:09Z," Not a fan of MP4 anymore, my backup pc died too and now i'm stuck on a laptop that won't play them smoothly for some reason.. not even with VLC.

 So in the future pls upload the avi you probably recorded before converting lol :)"
