I wanted to help out the SWGemu (Emulator community) with the original 3 disk set of Star Wars Galaxies. I used IMGburn to make these myself. When comparing MD5 hashes of other torrents, I didn't like what I saw. So here is an alternative.

These are 3 .iso's made by me using IMGburn....and that's it.
---HASH---

Disk 1 
FF80D2425542A2FC60C60B049305C42A

Disk 2
68DF256C09DADDD732BDA379151CBA88

Disk 3
68E3C2DC5E0D53EE30E8657C385169F2

The SWGemu is up and running (in 2012- yes, it's true) Go to www.swgemu.com to register. 
This torrent exists for those who may be missing a disk or two or they may be too scratched to be read from.

The game DOES work in Windows 7 x64. (You will get an error saying it might not work-it does)
No- you can't play offline.

Come enjoy the best MMORPG ever once again.

Don't mention the word torrent EVER when you are a part of the SWGemu community.
