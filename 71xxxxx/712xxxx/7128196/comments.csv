Use this launchpad to play the emulator
http://lpe.ocdsoft.com/

now create an account on the swg-emu website, it will be your login info also
http://www.swgemu.com/forums/content.php

now you are playing free star wars galaxies, join the liberator server"
,HelicopterBen,2012-03-25T05:45Z,"HumanButOnlyJust is right- do NOT run the game from the default icon that shows up on your desktop. Use the link http://lpe.ocdsoft.com/  I almost added that to the torrent but I wanted to keep it as pure as possible and avoid 'Virus accusations'

Once again, these disk images aren't 'cracked' and you don't need a key, because the 'official SWG' servers were shut off December 2011. These disk images are only to replace the ones you have in your moms attic that you already own, but are too scratched."
,HelicopterBen,2012-03-25T06:25Z,"See what a 100% player run economy is like. 

See what the best resource spawn system ever created is like.

 See how every MMORPG from now, until eternity, can only beat SWG because of graphics, or voice overs.

 See how you won't care about graphics and voice overs anymore.

 See what your older brother can't stop talking about and how Sony destroyed the game April 2005. 

See why a couple of coders and investors have spent the last 6 YEARS, re-creating the server code from SCRATCH in their free time....it's that good. "
,humanbutonlyjust,2012-03-25T11:02Z,"But after update it now says registration is not automatic, contact an admin on swgemu"
,opaleg,2012-03-25T14:49Z,"hell yes, I used to play on swgemu but it was really buggy in the beginning. Thanks for uploading.

-disclaimer-

I haven't installed and don't know how safe it is in terms of infection. I doubt it is though."
,HelicopterBen,2012-03-25T16:37Z,"@HumanButOnly
You have to  make the account on their forums. And then get you account validated by clicking the link that is sent to you. (Just like most other forums). Did you validate? Can you make a post in the forums ?"
,humanbutonlyjust,2012-03-25T20:51Z,"yes @Helicopter, for some reason my first attempt to make account did not work. all good now thanks"

,AnFSweper,2012-04-19T23:07Z,"Pls Guyz, I really want to try this game!"
,AnFSweper,2012-04-22T17:28Z,"K Guyz i Finally found a solution for "" SMTP server requires a secure connection or the client wasn't authentical. Server response was: 5.5.1 authentication required. Learn more at ""

1.Make sure that u have .Net Framework up to date (basicly ver. 4)

2.Make sure that lauch pad downloaded every file for u (dont download filles, just let LPE 
download them for u), for me i dunno why it took so long, about 4h.

3.The LPE will automaticly start (if not double click again on desktop shortcut), and u will see add server button.

4.Add a server from any SWGemu list (optionally its Nova TS, or Liberator TS)

5. Login with SWGemu forum username & password

6.Make a Character

7. ENJOY!!!
PS:
If u have a problem, email me and il try to fix it,

,feedtheblind,2012-09-12T05:08Z,OMFG Thank you - was bidding on a couple copies on ebay - kids scratched the hell outta my old discs - Hoping swgemu is even 1/2 of what pre-soe fucking it up was and I'll be happy for now.
,feedtheblind,2012-09-12T08:46Z,Worked perfectly - again Thank you
,irobot443,2012-09-12T15:07Z, Help?!?! I downloaded it but when i mount it with daemon tools lite and i run it via auto run it says The version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you're running. that happens when i click on run install.exe on the auto run and i am running Windows 7 Ultimate x64 bit. Thanks!
,HelicopterBen,2012-09-23T16:16Z,@irobot443 Im running Win7 64bit as well. I think you just need to ignore the error because it works fine on Win7 x64
