Guess you're referring to the last three uploaded episodes. falkies was tired of waiting for the episodes, so she bought them, encoded and shared them with us.

I'm just happy they're available at all. As for the framerate, I personally wouldn't say it's ""very"" poor, but what do I know?"
,snooks86,2012-03-22T22:32Z,thanks for uploading these. i was getting frustrated that no one had done so by now. :-)
,xaine05,2012-03-24T01:56Z,"Thanks for uploading these! I will agree that the framerate is a bit askew as the episodes seem very ""choppy"" but I wouldn't know how to get around this at all.

This season has just been terrible to get a hold of episodes - don't know why this season is so difficult, never had any trouble with the last seasons."
