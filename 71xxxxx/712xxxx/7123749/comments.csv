What do the rest of you think about ES vs WP ?"
,Norade,2012-03-23T02:08Z,Any chance we might see a  re-upload of Krysta Kaos' (DB 10647) shoot from November 2010. I can't seem to find it anywhere.
,Norade,2012-03-23T02:24Z,I should also add thanks for the great uploads. Keep up the great work.

just search tpb with only the shoot number and you'll find most of merzedes' old torrents. See there are no seeders, so if noone else have jumped in to help throughout the day Ill find it and seed after work :)"

You are right ES is much shorter

+++ not as interesting as WP

USE the same stuff all the time BECOME monotonous ++ boring

GANGBANGs with history are much better "
,Norade,2012-03-23T19:06Z,"I got the torrent already, but there are no seeders."
,jezus1234,2012-03-23T19:59Z,"CAN some one SEED WA-9819 Donna_Madeline NO seeed at all 0/1
