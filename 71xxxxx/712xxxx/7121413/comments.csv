If you want to view them on an android device, grab tTorrent (free from market) and Droid Comic Viewer (also free from market). Use tTorrent to download the file and extract the files from there. Then use Droid Comic Viewer to read and enjoy! "
,trunks83,2012-03-22T13:08Z,"anybody else having problems with the links? seems to not be working on this site, other sites just fine, and yes i have the lastest update to utorrent."
,bravo95,2012-03-22T13:50Z,I just downloaded it on my other laptop now and it is working fine. What is the link doing/not doing when you click on it?
,trunks83,2012-03-22T18:50Z,"yeah, does nothing, but if i find a link with a mirror link that will work."
,Naikum,2012-03-24T06:12Z,Download works perfect.  Thank you - Jay
,tae_maed,2012-03-24T20:34Z,hey is it possible to put them on my iphone?
,bravo95,2012-03-24T22:59Z,"@tae_maed you can put them on your iPhone, but you need a comic viewer. If you do a Google search, there are quite a few different ones and ways to do it.  
@Naikum you're welcome!! I hope you enjoy them like I did :D "
