,theroomy2,2012-04-18T10:25Z,"What is wrong with you?  You actually screwed with every single video, adding 500 mB of useless garbage that people are forced to skip through to watch anything, and then added your own useless bullshit videos onto the torrent, too?  The first thing everyone things when they see the other videos is VIRUS, and what I just torrented is malicious from some spyware company resubmitting other people's torrents with their laced own videos installing god knows what and promoting their own awful fishing website.

And on top of it, you add an extra hour onto everyone's torrent with the excessive video you add.  You should put a warning in the title that 1/3 of this is your own videos so people won't waste their time getting something they will have to delete immediately after.  I, like many others, get digital copies of the DVDs or Blurays I buy so I can watch them how I like and without the awful commercials and copyright FBI warnings they force you to watch for every episode.  The last thing people want is for people like you to put the commercials BACK into the digital copies.

I sincerely hope you stop doing that to your torrents, and especially learn that it isn't what's going to promote people wanting to torrent your packs.  It'll actually make people NOT want to. Axxo or other top torrent makers didn't need to bullshit down all their stuff to become more known.  They just delivered quality, low size, and consistency without any of the bullshit others were throwing into their torrents like pictures or self advertisements."
[V],manOtor,2012-04-19T00:04Z,"""What is wrong with you?"" - Nothing :)

""You actually screwed with every single video, adding 500 mB of useless garbage...""
No, I didn't!

""The first thing everyone things when they see the other videos is VIRUS""
Yeah, right, a Video-Virus...

""You should put a warning in the title that 1/3 of this is your own videos...""
Dude, the three files I added are hardly 1/3 and BTW: it's all in the description ;).
Also you have the option in your torrent client to only download the files you want.

""I, like many others, get digital copies of the DVDs or Blurays I buy...""
Why don't you make your own backups then?

""The last thing people want is for people like you to put the commercials BACK into the digital copies.""
I don't.

""...and especially learn that it isn't what's going to promote people wanting to torrent your packs.""
I don't need to promote - you either choose to download the packs or not.

All I do here is for my own personal amusement :).
I have fun putting together the trailers and making the little teasers in between.
I am no company and don't have the goal to become another Axxo-like top torrent maker.

If you don't like the free stuff I offer, move on ;).

Cheers"

,CleanSanchez,2012-05-09T07:12Z,Thanks for the up! Tons of seeders and I LOVE ARCHER!
,MooseMoosington,2012-06-03T23:59Z,"If you dont want the extra content, you can choose to not download it."
,Andr3w96,2012-06-11T18:35Z,"I am content with this content, but why is it advertised as HD when it clearly is not?"
,shmimbadad,2012-06-17T13:04Z,"Yeah, these are definitely not HD. I'm downloading, because animated shows are usually fine in non-hd, so long as they're not super compressed and fuzzy. Still, shouldn't be calling it HD when it's not even 480p. "
[V],manOtor,2012-06-20T00:19Z,"^^^ Guys, all that HDTV in the title means, is that the content was ripped from an HD source, which still gets you better quality than content ripped from a SD source.
Also the torrent is in the category ""TV shows"", not ""High-Res TV shows"" + the codec (XviD) should also be an indicator, that this is actually not HD ;)"
,styxcreek,2012-07-06T17:00Z,some people are so unappreciative.. go and buy the dvd. i thankyou sir.
,davejoy2,2012-07-17T22:16Z,Thank you for sharing :)

,voodoo797,2012-08-04T00:15Z,"this isn't the complete 3rd season. episodes 4, 5, and 6 are missing. your episode 4 is actually episode 7, 5 is 8, and so on"
,hpstrslyr,2012-08-13T08:11Z,great ul do you have season 1?
,Boh2,2012-09-20T05:20Z,"@voodoo797 
This is the complete season, but the episodes are numbered wrong or might be going by production number rather than episode number.  The episodes are in the correct order though. "
