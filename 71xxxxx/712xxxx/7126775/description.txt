Archer is a half-hour animated comedy series created by Adam Reed for the FX network.
Set at the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS), suave master spy Sterling Archer deals with global espionage.
Here, global crises are merely opportunities for its highly trained employees to confuse, undermine, betray and royally screw each other. At the center of it all is said master spy Sterling Archer, whose less-than-masculine code name is "Duchess." He works with his domineering mother Malory, who also is his boss. He also has to deal with his ex-girlfriend, Agent Lana Kane and her new boyfriend, ISIS comptroller Cyril Figgis, as well as Malory's lovesick secretary, Cheryl.
