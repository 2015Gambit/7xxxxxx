The first 3 episodes acted as a closure/epilogue to the story-arc that made season TWO. Some people (including myself) consider these episodes as part of season 2, since they are part of the same story arc. The remaining 10 episodes of the 2012 contract made a NEW story arc and most people are numbering these as season 3, episodes 1 thru 10."
