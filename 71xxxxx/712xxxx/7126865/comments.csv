[T],immagical,2012-03-27T12:02Z,@zMTz...  Did you not used to have a load of torrents on here?     Clicked your name but none there!   :)
[H],zMTz,2012-03-28T09:50Z,"Move tools a little dodgy, I've moved it again....

Just a helper, no I didn't have any torrents but just commented & used site a fair bit. :D"
[T],immagical,2012-03-28T16:47Z,"O.k.  thanks for help in moving torrent..

I have had a couple of torrent where i have picked for them to go in to /Movies,   and after say about 10 minutes they then appear in ""highRes/movies.,   

So i was wondering  if the server/system reads the ""tittles and codec"" names and places the torrent to the catagory based on the codec names in the tittles of movies.


So you did'nt have torrent..   I think now its just that ive probably saw you name on here a lot and thought you had some up.

Thanks for all the help. :D"
