,Coma-Vision,2012-03-27T05:22Z,I guess this is the anime? Was really hoping for a torrent of the movie.

About this one, it has good quality and all, but i have another one from yellow flash in 720p wich occupies much less space on disc and the quality of video is way better. I did compare them in my sony bravia and the one from yellow flash is cleaner. In other hand, this one has dual audio and a i really miss the english in a anime with european medieval thematics. Thanks for the torrent!"
