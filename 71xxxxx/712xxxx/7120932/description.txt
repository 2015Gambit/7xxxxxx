A custom mix tape featuring the best tracks of New York-based electronica duo HeartsRevolution.  Hailed as "the model for the modern pop group," they are responsible for some of the most fulfilling and exuberant techno music in recent memory.  HeartsRevolution is certainly not for those who are afraid to dance, as ravenous synthesizers, mad beats, and chill female vocals all battle for dominance.  Featuring songs such the ridiculously in-your-face techno anthem "C.Y.O.A." and the delicate pop lullaby "The Rose and Her Prince," HeartsRevolution shows a wide spectrum of the electronica genre.  A couple of remixes are included as bonus tracks.
