Medical Physiology presents the physiological concepts essential to clinical medicine. Each chapter provides conceptual diagrams to facilitate comprehension of difficult concepts, and presents both normal and abnormal clinical conditions to illustrate how physiology serves as an important basis for diagnosis and treatment. Hallmark pedagogical features emphasize problem-solving skills and promote review and retention: Clinical Focus and From Bench to Bedside boxes, a comprehensive glossary, and online USMLE-style review questions with answers and explanations. Companion web site offers additional resources for students (question bank, animations, searchable text) and faculty (image and test banks, PowerPoint slides for use in class).
