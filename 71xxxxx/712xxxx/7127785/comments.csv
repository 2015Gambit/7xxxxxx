,Tinychief1,2012-03-29T23:57Z,I am guessing you need a Jtag for this to work?
,afsilver,2012-03-30T15:47Z,"indeed, hence the torrent name.."
,rev903,2012-04-08T12:53Z,Where does this file go?
,rev903,2012-04-08T12:53Z,Im guessing content/000000000000000000
,afsilver,2012-04-09T00:33Z,content/000000000000000000/415608cb/00000002 
,rev903,2012-04-13T01:32Z,"I did that, it isn't working."
,afsilver,2012-04-13T18:41Z,get the latest Title Update for mw3 and put it in cache. i assume it's at xbuc by now so fsd will find it for you.
,catcherben,2012-05-25T03:15Z,So I'm guessing you just copy this to MW3 directory... and pc users don't have to worry about JTAG.
,Arcticstormfirefight,2012-08-28T02:18Z,so PC users can use this or something or only xbox?
