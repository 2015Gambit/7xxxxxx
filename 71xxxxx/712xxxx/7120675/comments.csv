,NetHazard,2012-03-21T21:17Z,"@beso140

How many what?"
,NetHazard,2012-03-21T21:24Z,"Works fine by the way, and no pirate's eye patch like in v1.04. Thanks for the upload scene4all."
,Famosbo,2012-03-21T22:02Z,"Can someone tell me how to fix the infinite loading screen on the game ?
I already updated my graphic drivers and directx, and didnt work."
,666Apocalypse666,2012-03-21T23:14Z,"@Famosbo Same here, enters menu after infinity does this whenever it loads 
"
[T],Nighted,2012-03-22T01:19Z,Eye patch still persists here.
,TheMunakas,2012-03-22T13:30Z,"There definitely is an eyepatch. Too bad, it kind of destroys the atmosphere of the game. Also, at the loading screens, there's a Remedy text saying something like ""If you like the game, please purchase it"" which is kind of a neat hint by Remedy."
,LordBernkastel,2012-03-24T07:19Z,"Pirate patch does still persist, but I'm ok with it. I just think I'm from Pirates of the Caribbean."
,blueyear88,2012-03-24T16:44Z,"I need help,can't go lower then 1024x768."
,gamezman,2012-03-26T01:13Z,"Thx scene4all for this share of new update.
Alan Wake Trainer for this update is also available here: http://gameznfo.com/2012/03/alan-wake-v1-05-16-5341-8-trainer/"
,sage1210,2012-03-26T10:51Z,"why annoy with just a pirate patch while we are a pirate them self.

if remedy want to do the real sarcasm. give me a pirate sword on alan's ass.  "
,ricardois,2012-04-08T22:50Z,"Thanks so much now i can play that in 3D finally, still a lot of shadow problems but at low convergence it is working."
,ricardois,2012-04-08T22:50Z,"Thanks so much now i can play that in 3D finally, still a lot of shadow problems but at low convergence it is working.

And i love the pirate Eye Patch, YARW!!!"
,ivanhoe68,2012-04-09T13:33Z,"This works, except that alan wake is running around  only in his underwear and wearing an eypatch!!!! THANKS FOR DESTROYING MY GAME!!!"
,tomatoegg,2012-04-11T09:44Z,"Please try the update uploaded by the_laser. I had the eyepatch problem as well. To be exact I installed the game again (after having backed up my save folder in order not to start from the beginning) and applied the_laser's update. I was at episode 4. I restarted the episode and the eyepatch has gone. I do not know if you have installed the scene4all upload, if you can install the_laser's update above it. You can try this first if you want to avoid reinstalling the game and backing up your saves."
,tomatoegg,2012-04-11T13:47Z,"By the way, this is the update that worked for me

,MovieFreak123,2012-04-15T18:00Z,Thank you !!!
,MLO89,2012-05-17T18:29Z,I don't have any eye patch. I installed update 1.05 over 1.03. Had skipped 1.04. Maybe that's why I never got the eye patch.
,MLO89,2012-05-17T19:24Z,"Take that back I did get the eye patch after playing for awhile. I got the other no eye patch crack and it works. Only thing different about it is the addition of a ""AlanWake.exe"" file. Just pop that in and replay from the start of an episode segment and eye patch is gone."
,Draunxer,2012-06-26T02:58Z,does this make 800 by 600 resulotion ????
