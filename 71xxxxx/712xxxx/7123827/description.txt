This is the beta/prototype version of Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories, and it's rare, only a few people actually have it. Wanna be one of those who actually has it?
This is something for the real fans of the Kingdom Hearts franchise!

This is a really awesome beta/prototype with a debug menu that can do about anything, change music, control the camera freely, get every card and other more and fun stuff!

The game is NTSC and this is when they translated the game into english from japanese so they mostly speak in english. The debug menu is though in japanese so you either will have to guess or have to translate it.

Here is a rough translation though: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v450/Borman/roughtranslationdebugKH.jpg

To active the debug menu you simply have to plug-in a second controler in the PS2 and use X and O on the controller to navigate.


To use this you either need a modded PS2, swap magic or PCSX2.



If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the description.
And please once done downloading, seed, thanks.
