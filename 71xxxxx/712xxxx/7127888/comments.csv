,mikeboyy,2012-03-24T17:38Z,Thanks! People still need the .avis!
,nemo9fish,2012-03-24T20:58Z,Why do people still need avi's? Modern players can play pretty much anything. Seeing wmv's tick me off simply because they can be used by scammers to hide passwords and drive traffic to bogus web sites.
,Astralia,2012-03-24T22:52Z,nemo9fish: avi isnt the same as wmv.  I prefer avi as my stand-alone dvd player plays dvd's with avi's on it but it doesnt read mp4. Why would i toss out my fully functional dvd player just to spend money to buy a new one?
,hell911,2012-03-25T06:58Z,"We still need .avi, who the fucks says ""no more AVI""

stfu!!!

dont think that everyone is like you."
,Sassijac,2012-03-25T08:26Z,I have a cheap but good media player that plays avi files beautifully on my 32-inch LCD T.V. Unfortunately it does not read x264 mp4.
,barneyek,2012-03-25T11:57Z,Thx 4 AVI dude! Gr8 work! 
,angel255ad,2012-03-25T19:47Z,FYI people prefer AVI'S because there easy to deal with when using conversion tools and certain software.. mp4 and mkv files are not and most players do not accept them.. i prefer AVI files as there much easier for me to deal with when putting on CD as well as editing.. most software programmes don't work as well with other formats like AVI.. that is why this format is better for people to use you either like it or you don't like it to each there own.. so stop bitching about it everyone is different on what they prefer :)
,xpiras,2012-03-25T21:23Z,640x360  Great. Thank you. it is working on p3CPU... 
,emnioj71,2012-03-26T00:12Z,"Also AVI files are less system intensive.  My android pad will play mp4 and such but the audio looses sync and jumping the video ahead can cause problems.

  Weirdly, these problems are not as bad when outputting to an HDTV...

 Oh yeah my point, more AVI files please!"
,angel255ad,2012-03-26T06:23Z,"AVI'S rock there aint no other format id rather have then AVI.. most of the software i use only accept AVI it don't like the other formats.. and im sick of farting about with the idiocy of those other formats to much pissing about.. AVI simple, straight forward, manageable, and less pissing about hahaha :p"
,morpheusxnyc,2012-03-26T14:25Z,"Yes, please do STFU with that bullshit support for MP4s. 

AVIs are universally supported by all players, especially older or lower end media players, whereas MP4s and MKVs are jagged little pills for them to swallow, only being supported by the latest devices.

Which means that we have to manually convert MP4 to AVI/MPEG every time, which produces shitty file quality and bloated files sizes as compared to a native AVI file."
,Brrr1955,2012-03-26T16:12Z,Thanks for .avi
,joebirg,2012-03-27T21:13Z,any word on copy right infringement? I got an email on last weeks episode from this uploader. I appreciate all the uploads but I cant afford another letter.
,palerm0,2012-03-28T12:23Z,personally ...i wish every .mkv file on this website would fall in a giant pit of fire..
,palerm0,2012-03-28T12:25Z,and while im at it every mp4 can jump in the fire as well
,arildus,2012-03-31T23:35Z,Thanx:)
,bajungadustin,2012-04-20T09:32Z,"Yeah i still need AVI.. i dont burn to disc or watch on my computer.. i stream to my xbox through the xbox video player.
