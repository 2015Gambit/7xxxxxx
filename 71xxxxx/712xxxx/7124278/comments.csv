1.Make dummys of all the _w.xmv files(rightclick ,new txt file, name the same as the file you are dummying) eg. death.xmv 
2.The .xmv files in TRL are of bonus videos after you finish the game. there are 2 versions of each a widescreen one and a normal one. We are deleteing the widescreen ones, if you want the widescreen one still just dummy the normal one .eg death.xmv(standard tv) death_w.xmv(widescreen) "
