,ivygoof,2012-04-02T22:57Z,"@Sujith49 - If you a torrent client already installed, as soon as you hit 'Get this Torrent', a pop will be displayed, to launch the torrent client. Accept it and enjoy the download. With this new feature, no torrent files will be saved. If you are facing problems even after following the above, just upgrade your torrent client and re-run the process. Hope it works."
