,Bookeek,2012-03-25T15:30Z,"I like thrillers too. You have named some of the best. I'm working on uploading Preston & Child right now. Also Patricia Cornwall.

Give Lost Girls a try. Tell me what you think. 

There is also Peter Robinson, who is very highly recommended by critics - he writes traditional not-too-violent mysteries: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6523292/Peter_Robinson_Ebook_Collection_%28epub_format%29
and along similar lines mystery-award winner
Louse Penny- http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6850738/Louise_Penny_Ebook_Collection_%28epub_Format%29

I'm also open to recommendations..."
,TxJag,2012-03-25T17:53Z,"Looking forward to your Cornwell and P&C (those books that I have are riddled with errors and the ones that aren't have no ToC) another author is Michael Koryta I've got a few of his books but not the first one. As well as Gregg Hurwitz. I should really get caught up on everything I've got right now haha. I've got Frank Peretti as well and the funny thing is that I stripped the DRM off the books cause I bought them on Apple and when I converted The Visitation to mobi, Calibre made it the dual release that was in the iBookstore of The Visitation and Monster. Any way you could help me out there? I've converted Monster and it turns out okay."

I have no idea how to strip DRM, but here is my Peretti collection - hope it helps.
