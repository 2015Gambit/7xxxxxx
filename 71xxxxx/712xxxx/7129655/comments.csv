[V],psspss,2012-03-25T05:08Z,at least simon is back.. so this years wont be such a flop as last years
[V],psspss,2012-03-25T05:11Z,"from now on anyone i see not sharing in my peer list
will be going to my personal block list

and anyone connecting to me with bitlord bitcomet or
transmission or any other weird client other
then utorrent will be blocked
that includes utorrent ver less then 2.x
some still using 1.6 1.7 and 1,83 out there with
poor UTP support

azure and mac utorrent and bittorrent all seem good
so far

im finding these arent sharing the data and slows
it down for all

==

how to save wasted data using utorrent

http://digiex.net/guides-reviews/guides-tutorials/application-guides/937-enable-update-ip-filter-block-list-utorrent-ipfilter-dat.html

all have a read

this is how Im doing it..
I made a ipfilter.dat in the program data area
and just add found ip from peerlist to it
x.x.x.x
right click on peer list then go update ipfilter.
person is then gone from the list :_)"
[V],psspss,2012-03-25T06:26Z,"hmm just watching does seem the audio drifts
a little throughout the video after all.
not too bad though. maybe its just my player
or just the first 1/3 of the video.

shame all mp4 sources are not equal.. as they dont convert well 
a few of them but we stuck now as all switch
from xvid to mp4s so have to do a convert regardless"
[V],psspss,2012-03-25T06:37Z,"100 ms on track sync seems better 
when watching in VLC

might have to wait for a 720p source to convert
to fix it.. I think the minor random corruption
in various places
knocks it a bit"
[V],psspss,2012-03-25T06:54Z,"to fix the minor audio sync
if want to fix once downloaded and want to keep do these steps (otherwise use VLC player from videolan.org.. and go tools m track sync and
press up arrow once for 100ms so can watch it)

1) download avidemux.org and install
2) run and load the video
3) tick shift down the side and enter 100
4) file pulldown then save -> save video and 
enter the name

done"
,Tyki,2012-03-27T21:13Z,"is there another version around,  am thankful you took time to upload this but the picture sound is really bad, can't enjoy it."
[V],psspss,2012-03-27T23:47Z,"I think some added the mp4 here for you
theres now a 720p but saem capper so
maybe using a bad tool still which dont convert to xvid perfectly..

the sound can be fix in less then a minute if read above comments either when playing or
via the editor... 1 min in editor to resave it
or a few seconds to adjust in player

the video seemed ok to me.. maybe some pixels
in very fast movement"
[V],psspss,2012-03-27T23:49Z,"as above ..
720p is here
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7130284/Britains.Got.Talent.S06E01.720p.HDTV.x264-C4TV


theres also a xvid by someone else its bigger though maybe higher bitrate so no need for me to redo mine.. as im happy with my version it was good enough on laptop"
[V],psspss,2012-03-27T23:50Z,"another rip of xvid
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7130365/Britains.Got.Talent.S06E01.HDTV.XviD-AFG

I say its done from the same main source though"
