,SonicIt,2012-06-14T05:08Z,"Utorrent says malware, but it looks like a false positive. I get that a lot. What I also didn't get was the game... It just kept making me install some kind of viewing tool. Odd."
,rachross,2012-08-13T00:42Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. In addition to the game, it downloads a client that removes all torrented/potentially illegally downloaded files. I lost EVERYTHING. Thanks a lot."
,rachross,2012-08-13T00:46Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD. YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR FILES! I HAD TO RESTORE MY WHOLE SYSTEM AFTER THIS DOWNLOAD AND I STILL LOST EVERYTHING!!!
