In 1970, a picture of a snow monkey bathing in a hot spring graced the cover of 
Life Magazine. Ever since, Japan's hot-tubbing primates have been protected and 
well fed for the enjoyment of tourists and photographers - they have become 
international superstars of the natural world.

But while their unique lifestyle has brought fame, the rest of Japan's snow monkeys
lead very different lives, enduring incredible hardships as they fight for survival
in their beautiful but unforgiving mountain home.
