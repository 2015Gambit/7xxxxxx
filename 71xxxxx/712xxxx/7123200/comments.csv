,cazeeee,2012-03-25T20:54Z,"Humm... I have problem..

first I copy file ""Nexus8.2.dll"" to my VST plugin folder. Same folder as nexus.dll (nexus 2.2.0""

then I copy the file ""SYNSONXS.dll"" to C:Windowssystem32 but it doesn't work because it says that it can't find the SYNSONXS.dll file.. 

So I but the SYNSONXS.dll file in SysWOW64. 

Then I start cubase, nexus8.2.. nexus box that came up was white.. Whaaats the problem??"

,NY4N,2012-03-27T22:57Z,where can i download nexus2 they don't have a trial link on their site
,ItchyLala,2012-03-28T07:35Z,"""reFX Nexus 2.3.2 will crash if you use(load) any 2.2.0 or higher samples in it.""

The only reason 2.3.2 is needed is to open expansions AFTER 2.2, yet this cannot even open 2.2 samples?

The cracked 2.2 has been available for 2 years, which DOES open 2.2 samples.

This torrent is completely pointless, but thanks anyway.

,Iridescentness,2012-05-11T19:27Z,Can you upload 2.3.2? It's not anywhere legit on any site and reFX doesnt have a trial download. Since you have the crack i assume you have to program installer.
