Storyline:

Horror movie, following the adventures of a group of students who enter the haunted forest Harrow Woods. With the aim of investigating the disappearance of horror novelist George Carney, a group of students, encouraged by Gary, enter the forest where he was last seen two years ago. Uncovering more than they had bargained for - not least that the infamous 17th century witch Lenore Selwyn was burnt at the stake in Harrow Woods and died laying a curse upon the ground beneath her - the students soon find themselves in a battle for survival.
