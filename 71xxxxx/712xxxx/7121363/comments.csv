I don't know why you, and so many others ask for technical help on The Pirate Bay.  This is a horrible place to ask, mainly because you will have to wait a long time, keep checking to see if anyone answered, and lastly, because you are not likely to get an answer.

Why would you go through all of that when it is SO EASY to just google your question?  You can find out in 5 minutes what you want to know and you're not bothering the uploader to answer little questions that are already answered everywhere on the internet...

Good luck."

use Any Video converter it is free and download it from a trustworthy source like CNET downloads or trusted uploaders here like Bone, Froggie100, heist etc.
i use Any video converter all the time especially now as UL's are H264 instead of avi. I will be getting a new TV which reads MP4 on the memory stick mine at present only reads Xvid and Avi.

@snowbirds instead of a long winded rant you could have easily answered. But these days mutual respect and helpfulness are seldom found."

,mojowoikin,2012-04-01T16:29Z,"Thanks froggie, I agree with ecchiless,  AV is about 6.5, but it's still the best I've found so far. It's watchable for me, but if you're looking for something HQ you might want to wait. "
