Jack Herriman is a young private eye in San Francisco. He lives above Scene Of The Crime, an art gallery specializing in photos of crime scenes that were taken by his uncle Knut. Paul Raymonds, a SFPD detective sergeant and old partner of JackΓÇÖs father, tells Jack heΓÇÖs sending a special client over in the morning. The relationship between Jack and Raymonds is strained, partly because Raymonds is cheating on JackΓÇÖs aunt. The next morning, Jack meets Alex Jordan, a woman he figures out is RaymondsΓÇÖ lates girlfriend. Alex says her sister Maggie has vanished, and that she might be at a hippie commune called Lunarhouse. Once inside Lunarhouse, Jack finds himself up to his eyeballs in trouble. Maggie was there but is gone now, and some of the communeΓÇÖs big bouncers chase Jack from the scene. In no time at all, JackΓÇÖs quest takes him through the dark alleys of the city, the bleak fall-out from emotional pain and suffering of a family, and force his own black rage and weakness to the surface so he has to finally deal with those things. Secrets are everywhereΓÇôeven Jack has them.
