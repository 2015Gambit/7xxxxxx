The Murpy Laws

With direct rum injection and more noise than a three legged cow playing a kazoo,
The Murphy Laws are set to break shit with their straight out hardcore punk sound.

coming soon to a stage near you.

The Murphy Laws are currently in the studio working on their masterpiece of Punk music,
and I made this torrent of their demo to try and raise support of local bands just like them.

Feel free to check out their Facebook page,


"like" them and spread this message "PUNK ISN'T DEAD!!!"

They have made their tracks available to download for the simple reason that it's good to share great music,
and its the easiest way to get noticed.

Support local bands!

Enjoy :)
