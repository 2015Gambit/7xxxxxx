NOTES:

Right cheers too lum1x for sending us the properv2 sors 
The video was much better and alot less cropped than the other 2 that are out ...but still has issues,with colouring,contrast levels,also the AR in parts looked bang on and others a little stretched ....so there might have been some cam movement thats been hidden.
Fixed all the contrast levels,rgb colours,chroma....removed loads of noise and 
also opted to changed the res ...
Audio we had to shrink several time to get it dam close then just needed some fine tuning ...5 cuts and only chance was 200 at each point so theres like 1 sec missing if that even though runtime on other videos are 2.13 and this is 2.07 ....
But we have full cam audio and i've had too cut nothing so its all there .
Once synced,dropped in AA and cleaned the audio as it was ful of noise.static 
then remuxed back too our encode.
