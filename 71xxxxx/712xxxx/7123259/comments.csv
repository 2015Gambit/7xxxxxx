,eidref,2012-03-24T21:51Z,"hi yifi, i was never a fan of you befpre. i dont like files that too small but when i got nothing else to download i tried your works and its good. Actually i was not so impressed but when you started doing mp4's that are a little bit bigger in size i became so impressed. It wonderful. awesome. Hope you keep on doing 1080's mp4. I am now downloading your works everyday. Hope you can also upload classic action movies like cobra and over the top by stallone and missing in action and delta force by the great chuck norris. Thank s lot yify."
