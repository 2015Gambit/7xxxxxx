[T],MrUnpopular,2012-03-24T12:23Z,XviD is too slow to convert. 3 hours vs 30 minutes
[V],psspss,2012-03-24T12:30Z,"chuckles at the name

 unpopular.mp4

says it all :D

thanx "
[V],psspss,2012-03-24T13:08Z,"slow? takes me from 15 to 30min to do a xvid
depends on quality and if soft is mult-core

try avs converter 8 its not bad and can join videos
together and can even convert decrypted dvds
very handy

however umile encoder 3.x is way faster again
espc if you got the special nvidia GPU it can use
however its more crappy interface and
dont seem to allow advance profiles"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-03-24T13:40Z,"Well for my two 10 minute XviD encodes, from start to finish (done capping, editing commercials, converting so I can convert to xvid, xvid conversion) it took 40 minutes total, 90% of that being the XviD conversion. That was with minimal processes running on my computer, and I left it alone while it did its thing.

With Handbrake in x264 it takes 45 minutes total for a 40 minute program. I can do 4x more in the same time as I was able to do with XviD. I have to edit the dvr-ms, convert the edited file to mpg, then convert it for it all to work right. I'll look into those programs however I honestly do prefer x264 more."
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-03-24T13:41Z,"Each one took 40 minutes, that is."
[V],psspss,2012-03-24T14:04Z,"for editing virtualdub or avidemux is simplest
you can cut out the bits without encoding it all
once have the xvid etc."
[T],jack.ss,2012-03-24T15:22Z,Thank you m8  :)
,PapaWoody,2012-05-13T12:27Z,does anybody know where to get The Goldfather? 
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-05-15T16:29Z,"That new show on Nat Geo? I've got the eps. Haven't had the time to figure out how to remove the DRM from the recordings, since nat geo and trutv do that for us."
,Wellsj,2012-05-22T10:53Z,Thanks mate!
