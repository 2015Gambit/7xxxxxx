[T],MrUnpopular,2012-03-26T14:11Z,"CRiMSON is doing Car Warriors it looks like, they've upped 4/5 eps from season 2 that have aired so far. If they stop capping them let us know (email or comments) and we'll take over, but for now we don't see a point in doing what someone else is already doing. :)"
,mentallyours,2012-04-06T13:54Z,no more?
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-04-10T00:07Z,We're having VPN issues so we cannot upload anything else until it's fixed. We should be back up soon. We've got tons of encodes waiting.
