:: PLOT :: In 2008, the Reaper virus infects Scotland, so the country is walled off by the British government. A Scottish woman begs retreating soldiers to take her injured little girl with them. Her daughter has an eye injury but is healthy otherwise. The mother gives her daughter an envelope just as the soldiers' helicopter lifts off.The quarantine is deemed a success, with the remaining Scottish population and the virus apparently dying off. Decades later, though, the virus reappears in London. Prime Minister Hatcher and his righthand man Canaris share with domestic security chief Bill Nelson news of survivors in Scotland, and they believe a cure may exist. They order him to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses Major Eden Sinclair, the little girl now grown up, to lead the team. She has a cybernetic eye that can be removed and used remotely for weapon aiming and video playback.
