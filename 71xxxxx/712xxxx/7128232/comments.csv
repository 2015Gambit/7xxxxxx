,dean2804,2012-03-24T23:54Z,"A skull doesn't mean anything, trusted accounts get hacked all the time. However, it appears this is real so I apologise for saying it was fake."

,snowbirds,2012-03-25T00:46Z,"Btw, this movie is more US government funded propaganda bullshit that LIES and makes war look cool and fun so that poor people will enlist and go get themselves killed fighting to make corporations rich.

Watch the movie if you want, but don't believe this bullshit.  This is a fairy tale.  War wrecks people."
,usaidhey,2012-03-25T04:34Z,HD? how did u get that
,usaidhey,2012-03-25T07:45Z,this one totally real shit
,Minerva7101,2012-03-25T10:03Z,"@snowbirds, this is as far from a fairy tale as a movie can be, filmed with real Navy Seals, using live ammunition, and a story based on real world missions. Don't make such stupid comments when you obviously have no clue what you are talking about."
,blnc9949,2012-03-25T16:25Z,"A/V 10, Super Great Quality, but anyone know where to get english subs ?  the korean ones are really disturbing.. :S"
,DumbLuck,2012-03-26T02:04Z,"Real file, but Korean subs are hardcoded. This is better quality than any other version of this film out there. But I'll still re-download it when it comes out without hardcoded subs. Thanks again aiden0!"
,KBROCK1,2012-03-26T08:01Z,"EXCELLENT qulity A/V is 10/10

the first couple seconds have a wierd ad but it clears and jumps in. best quality ive seen. just gotta deal with subs"
,firstbuch,2012-03-26T20:37Z,Great job. Waiting for Polish subs.
,extracube,2012-04-07T16:17Z,Great job.  Waiting for NO subs.
,extracube,2012-04-07T16:19Z,"@elrome, good point.  I was in the military and can vouch, movies act as propaganda and recruitment, but military real life isn't like hollywood -- far from it.  Of course nowadays military salaries are so high, it pays just for the money alone.  But not the life."
