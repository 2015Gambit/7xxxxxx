Lesley Joseph narrates a documentary about the unlikely pin-ups of the 1970s music scene, 
from Gilbert O'Sullivan and Barry White to Leo Sayer and Demis Roussos. These were men whose 
lyrics conjured up images of candle-lit dinners, red roses and cosy nights in with the man of 
your dreams. For millions of female fans their romantic music was the perfect soundtrack for 
dreams of escape from the day-to-day drudgery of life in 70s Britain.
