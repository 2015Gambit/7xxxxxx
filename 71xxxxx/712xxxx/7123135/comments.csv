,yobo154,2012-04-22T09:43Z,"it works perfectly once you patch it. 

1. install using AngryBirdsSpaceInstaller
(by default it will create a Rovio file in your Programs File (x86) in my case. Under Rovio file, is your new Angrybirdspace file. paste the patch file in there and run it. )
2. copy and paste ""patch"" file into your new angrybirdsspace file
3. run patch file, click on patch. you'll get a patch successful sign. 
4. run angrybirdspace.exe file from there. click on get full version.
5. copy paste the THET-ALEV-LEFR-USWO that's in the patch doc file. 

enjoy :)
