Gold.Rush.Alaska.S02E19.hdtv.xvid-][ The Last Word Aftershow Special#5 ][ 24-Mar-2012 ] avi

Basically what they have done is pieced together a special from whats up
on the website already with maybe some small extras in it..
like I already have done with the Aftershow compiles :)

anyhow here it is to complete the set.. I thought it was done with
but seems this is surely the last special until the new season

theres 2 specials for bering sea to come I believe they will
be much better :)

enjoy and HELP SEED

I kept the naming my way to align with my naming I use (some will 
call this S02E21)
