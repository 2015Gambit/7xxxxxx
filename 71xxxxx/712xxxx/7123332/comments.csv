Thanks again Ms Fenmore. It's appreciated. However, I do have a question. How come we can only download it via the magnet link? It doesn't allow me to rename the episode file to reflect the correct day (alternatively, you could name them according to the air date, if possible).

Thanks"

Sorry, I don´t why it´s only work with the magnet link, I don´t understand much of all this stuff, I´m glad  I´m able to upload this stuff...! And I can´t rename the file, cause I need the files with these dates on my computer since I save all episodes on DVD and I need the correct ( for me) dates...!! So Sorry...

@ katien44, I wouldn´t worry about that now...and there will always be new sites...Y&R and so on won´t die...see I´m from Germany, and I found a way to watch it on the CBS site as well even though it´s just for the US..there is always a way..."
