You can install this by going to your music folder > itunes > itunes media > Automatically add to itunes 

And putting the app in there. 

then just start itunes and select the apps tab, it will refresh your apps list, then go to your device in the side menu and select it in the list of apps on the sync screen. much easier than logging into your phone and doing it that way"
