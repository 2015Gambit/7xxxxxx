,KapNkRUK,2012-05-06T07:45Z,This K'racked version caused my macbook pro to become very sluggish and at times unresponsive. i deleted it and everything went back to normal. I had this same torrent installed and working properly on a 2008 white macbook. I will try and re-install it as i know this torrent is good.
