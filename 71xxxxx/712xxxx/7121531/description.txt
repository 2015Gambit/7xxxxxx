ΓÇ£HOW COULD YOU, A MATHEMATICIAN, BELIEVE THAT EXTRATERRESTRIALS WERE SENDING YOU MESSAGES?ΓÇ¥ the visitor from Harvard asked the West Virginian with the movie-star looks and Olympian manner. ΓÇ£Because the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way my mathematical ideas did,ΓÇ¥ came the answer. ΓÇ£So I took them seriously.ΓÇ¥

Thus begins the true story of John Nash, the mathematical genius who was a legend by age thirty when he slipped into madness, and whoΓÇöthanks to the selflessness of a beautiful woman and the loyalty of the mathematics communityΓÇöemerged after decades of ghostlike existence to win a Nobel Prize for triggering the game theory revolution. The inspiration for an Academy AwardΓÇôwinning movie, Sylvia NasarΓÇÖs now-classic biography is a drama about the mystery of the human mind, triumph over adversity, and the healing power of love.
