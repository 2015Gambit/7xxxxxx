Sporto Kantes is a french Drum and bass band, founded in 1990.

The band was born from the meeting of Benjamin Sportes and Nicolas Kantorovwicz, bassist of the Wampas. Sportes played Rockabilly in the 80's with Eduardo Leal de la Gala, (Wreckless Eric/Ltno) and Kantorovwicz Trash, but they play a melt of genres in their album: dub, jazz, reggae, hip hop, and also Brazilian music. The band have worked from samples with an Akai S 2000 on their tracks.
