,dasklney,2012-03-24T07:35Z,@nimd4: It's web downloaded version :D
,BigSkip21,2012-03-24T07:52Z,why not say this is NOT the first show this season!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what a waste of time
,zx6rider,2012-03-24T07:56Z," FYIThis is not episode 1 of season 2 this is recap and interviews to get you excited and updated to the 2nd season hence the  ""S2e00"" ."
,micron66,2012-03-24T08:30Z,"Info - 

Get in the Game! Enter the world of Westeros with this vivid and illuminating special about the epic HBO drama series Game of Thrones. 

Highlighted by behind-the-scenes footage, clips, and interviews, this feature revisits the events of Season 1, introduces new viewers to the many colorful characters, and presents an exclusive preview of things to come in Season 2."
[M],suzitastik,2012-03-24T08:36Z,"Yes, thought it was too good to be true. This is an episode of interviews based on the series. 

The quality is excellent, however it did get a few hopes up as the real beginning of the second series. 

Please be more forthcoming with the description DibyaTPB :)"
,TheRealAngelMike,2012-03-24T10:20Z,"Thought it would be boges, seeing Game Of Thrones would be a lot more in GB than just 300 MB.

But still nice upload!!

I like the intervieuws and stuff, its fun you learn something about the show and cast...."
,r0ssxx,2012-03-24T20:21Z,LOL I'm surprised one of you idiots didn't get your hopes up that it was the entire season 2. Don't blame the poster for the fact that you are to stupid to notice the difference between 00 and 01. For future reference episode 00 for any show is a recap/preview.
,chopstar1,2012-03-25T09:55Z,I know somebody out there has S2E1...they're just not uploading it.  I remember S2E1 of Shameless was on the bay a month before it aired.
,micron66,2012-03-25T17:36Z,"@chopstar1

you are correct,HBO sent the first 4 episodes of Season 2 to a few critics for reviews but i don't think they will be uploading them here LOL."

,humbertolixos,2012-04-02T05:29Z,"@KOBKED-X

You actually fucking came to a torrent site to say the books are better? You must be the biggest douchebag in the whole world.

Great upload, peace."
