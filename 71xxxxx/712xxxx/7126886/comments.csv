1. Disable internet. Pull network cable from computer, do not just disable the network adapter.
2. Install and open UltraEdit.
3. Click Register when it asks you about it.
4. Click Activate, which will send you to another box. Click Offline Activation.
5. Fill in a username and password.
6. Copy the 2 codes into the keygen. Click generate. Copy the codes it gives you into the registration box and register!
7. Patch host file from the keygen."
,Zhcwu,2012-04-15T22:45Z,"keygen keeps crashing after intro? tried run as admin too, and turned of antivirus.... anyone have any other ideas?"
,Zhcwu,2012-04-15T23:03Z,"Ignore me,, for some reason the first time i downloaded it, i didn't get the keygen so I thought the CORE10k.EXE was it... May CORE Live forever, one of the few fine groups left they still care about people and not $$ love you guys."
,dapidc,2012-05-23T11:37Z,"cannot download keygen, TrendMicro detected it as trojan.

Actually, it works OK. just disable the AV."
,Kulstad71,2012-05-27T00:55Z,"@Tedevil
I tried using your method, but when I clicked the ACTIVATE button, I just got an error message saying something like INVALID RESPONSE FROM SERVER, even tho I had modified my Hosts file and physically disconnected from the internet.  Also, I couldn't get the keygen to generate anything.

I'm not normally this wee-todd-ed about ""alternate installation methods"", but what the hell am I doing wrong?"
,Kulstad71,2012-06-01T02:47Z,"With a little bit of help from Google, I found the answer to my problem (merging Tedevil's instructions with my fix):
1. Disable internet. Pull network cable from computer, do not just disable the network adapter.
(1a - patch host file)
2. Install and open UltraEdit.
3. Click Register when it asks you about it.
4. Click Activate. (You should get an INVALID SERVER RESPONSE error message twice)
(5a - click the PROXY button)
(5b - enter anything into the 2 boxes ie: FRUITLOOPS and 2012)
(5c - you should then get the option for offline activation)
5. Fill in a username and password.
6. Copy the 2 codes (there are 2 USER CODES [User Code 1 and User Code 2]) into the keygen. Click generate. Copy the codes it gives you into the registration box and register!
7. Patch host file from the keygen. (I did this before I installed).

The above should work just fine.  Do NOT check for updates from within UltraEdit.

Oh yeah...and don't forget to re-enable/re-connect your internet connection when you're done."
,softsrv,2012-06-04T16:07Z,"""Patch Host File"" does not seem to work from the keygen on Win 7 (64 bit)... so patch manually as per instructions in Read Me.txt....

... and the programmer typed code into his new editor long after the sun had set

spot on guys!!"
,Chewza,2012-07-08T21:26Z,"Thanks for the download, this has to be one of the greatest text editors available for windows, and I use it every day.

And yes, if you disconnect your internet connection, then hit activate, it will give you the ability to click the offline registration button.  

Works great, thanks again!"
