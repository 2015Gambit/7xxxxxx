Three lives. One city. A destiny that binds them together. City Of Life is the FIRST film, produced and solely shot in the United Arab Emirates, and directed by an Emirati - Ali F. Mostafa. The central plot revolves around three parallel lives, amongst many cultures in one city, namely Dubai, thus highlighting the cityâ™s vast cultural and ethnic diversity. A privileged young male Arab at odds with his cultural identity and his less fortunate street smart friend; a disillusioned Indian taxi driver who bears an uncanny resemblance to a famous Bollywood star; and a former Romanian ballet dancer now working as a flight attendant and searching for love and companionship ... these individuals all live in Dubai and their lives are about to collide for better or for worse in a city where ambition, growth and opportunity are encouraged and dreams can still manifest.
