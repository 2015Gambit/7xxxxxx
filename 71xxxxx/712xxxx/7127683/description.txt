This is a collection of material on how to raise capital, do large deals and acquisitions and be generally a super-successful person. 

Dan Pena grew his first company from a $820 investment to $450,000,000 in eight years and has been involved in thousands of deals since then. He holds an exclusive one-week seminar twice a year on his Guthrie Castle in Angus, Scotland for the lofty sum of £10,000.
