This is an archive I took of the playstation2-linux.com website back in 2009 just after they announced the site was closing. The site now says they were going to put up an archive back in 2010. I think I've waited long enough for them to release their archive.

This includes all the project pages, files, and forum posts. The pages been converted to static html and should work locally. Not all links on each page work, but a good majority do.

Looking through the projects, all the important stuff seems to be there and in a readable format.
