,vomov,2012-05-22T13:22Z,"@ajay.dusa
It might, but they don't have a x64 version. Also, since x64 has been around for quite some time now, I'm making the assumption the RocketDock is abandoned."
,appie_01,2012-05-27T11:34Z,WHat is ''file_id.diz''?? And ''embrace.nfo'??

,naarcissus,2012-06-17T13:40Z,"RocketDock is pretty good, but it doesn't have any options for creating multi-tabbed launchers. ObjectDock, like Dragthing (OSX), does though."
,Vandermond,2012-07-26T09:15Z,"After Install
run keygen.exe
1. Press ""Patch""
2. Press ""Save License"" and click ""Save""
(save it in ObjectDock Plus Folder)"
,deftziz,2012-09-10T04:14Z,"I run keygen.exe, click ""patch"" and it asks me to ""Open"" a folder. How can I patch it?"
,spirit84,2012-09-20T08:25Z,"20th Sep 2012. it works just fine. just follow the instructions carefully. It says there is a hack tool 32/keygen, this is only the zipped key showing as a malware in virus scan,  there is NO virus in this download... thank you for the up... it's fine guys..."
