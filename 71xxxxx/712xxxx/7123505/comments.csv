,richrockr,2012-04-02T18:51Z,"@TacoMann and @willrogers: your device must be jailbroken. download ""iFile"" software in your iphone (via cydia, you can get it for free, search youtube"". download ""Diskaid"" software in your laptop/computer. then via ""Diskaid"" connecting your iphone, go to var/mobile and paste this .ipa file there. now open ""ifile"" through your iphone and u will see that .ipa present at the same place. simply click and then choose ""Install"". and bravo.. its done.. :)"

,richrockr,2012-04-02T18:56Z,"other substitute is the software called ""Installous"" which is very useful to install this kind of .ipa files."
