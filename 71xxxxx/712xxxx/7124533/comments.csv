,slowquin,2012-03-23T07:48Z,welcome to uploading. Do you plan on uploading more fame-girl set in the future?
,slowquin,2012-03-23T09:26Z,"@SuM you may be right this  has to be WMI incognito because this and  other torrent both have ...Please Note is desrcips
I never noticed it and the speed with which he previously posted sets is within the usual timeline"
,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-23T10:34Z,"yes guys this is strange ! If it is wmi, then he's taking risks because multiple accounts are not allowed on TPB and the 2nd account will usually be deleted by Mod's quickly."
,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-23T12:37Z,"@SLOWQUIN. You are our man. The Good Guy here. Who this jjkj is doesn't actually interest me a bit. If you want to continue, just do it and ignore this upload, i'll bet he's gone soon anyway.
+1 to slowquin only."
[T],webmodelsindex,2012-03-23T13:01Z,"I always posted the notes in my torrents. Not sure who this guy is, but he isn't me. He just copied from my old torrents. You can tell because he didn't even change the set name in the description."
,slowquin,2012-03-23T13:05Z,"@WHZ there is no need for me to re-up a duplicate of any set..I will up any set of fame-girls i don't see. As I stated previously, I work late so My uploads aren't as timely BTW I should have may-model set #59 in a couple days.  take care"
,yoyodownloader,2012-03-23T14:29Z,"Thank you, to whoever the uploader is :-)

Definately worth waiting to see and already ""finished"" - #41 is the winner :-)"

Wikipedia and Bing state that it's: ""Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a set of extensions to the Windows Driver Model that provides an operating system interface through which instrumented ...""
What does this have to do with Child Models?"
