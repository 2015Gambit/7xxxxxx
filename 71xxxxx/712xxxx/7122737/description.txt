The Mando Diao MTV Unplugged recorded at Union Film Studios in Tempelhof, Berlin on 2 September 2010 , was  finally concreted Friday night November 12 same year  when it aired through MTV Germany to Germany , Holland and Scandinavia, playing 24 songs, including hits , lesser-known songs and premieres, under a acoustic disguise  and stylistic changes giving a new image to already known songs, that make this MTV Unplugged in a kind separate project.

The Swedish band, who has been creating a frenzy all over Europe after an extremely successful album and their smash hit Dance With Somebody , unlike other MTV Unplugged,  refused to stillness in the light of the candles and made a staging with four rooms that reflected  the evolution of his career, with guests such as Juliette Lewis , Ray Davies and Lana Del Rey, as well as some lesser-known compatriots, really a luxury.
