,omegaviper,2012-03-23T07:41Z,i love and appreciate all your releases but why so late on this? it came out almost a  year ago i had to get riddler A's copy which is just as good but I consistency with releases.  also whats with people on here saying your releases are not good they are the best and they think they don't look good on big tv's.  They do look good I have giant 1080p tv and they look great to me I have compared them to uncompressed 720p and they look just slightly worse but nothing to waste the extra space and get the originals.  What is with other people releasing compressed versions that look the same as your but are like 1 to 3 gb they are pointless compared to yours. people on here are so dumb I want to kill them.
