PEOPLE LIKE US - DUCK POND/SEND ME NO FLOWERS - 

DECCA DEMO 12938 1969 UK

Extremely rare 1969 UK single release which featured a pre-Argosy & pre-Supertramp Roger Hodgson on keyboards.

Release Date: June 13th, 1969
Decca catalog # F12938

1. Duck Pond (1:04)
2. Send Me No Flowers (2:29)

I know Duck Pond ends abruptly.. unfortunately my only source was cut. 
I am constantly looking for a full version to replace this one. 

Keep checking back because I will be adding a ton of Supertramp goodies to get everything out there since YouTube copyrights make it impossible to find anything before they split up.
