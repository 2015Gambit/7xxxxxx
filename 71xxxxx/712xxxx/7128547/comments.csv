,jtata,2012-03-25T16:02Z,"Ok Please everyone. the 1-10 rating system should mean 1 being the worst you've ever experienced and 10 should be the best. So when you rate v10 it should be basically 1080p HD perfect resolution. v8 should be maybe 720 or at the worst DVD quality. This torrent I would realistically rate a 
a6v4
It's watchable but no better than a cam. you can't see anything during dark scenes. I would personally wait until a good DVD quality rip comes out. Especially for a movie like this where special effects are everything. NOT WORTH DLing. If you can stand cam quality sure.. but not for this type of movie. It has the quality of old home VHS recorded movies."

thank you uploader"
,jitu757,2012-03-31T16:42Z,People like you make it difficult to get a proper search result.  720p or higher considered high resolution.  Cam is a cam is a cam is a cam and no way HD.
