"Kate is Enough" 

While investigating an alleged 
suicide during an upscale yacht party 
with Detective Vega, Detective 
Britten runs into Rex's former 
babysitter Kate. Later, in a case 
Britten is investigating with "Bird", 
Kate appears again, this time as a 
suspect. Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans try to 
help him make sense of his run in 
with these two very different 
versions of the same woman.
