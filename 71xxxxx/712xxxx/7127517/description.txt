Monster Bug Wars
"Monster Bug Wars" takes you ringside to witness some of nature's deadliest encounters-where losers aren't just KO'd, they're eaten alive. This is the no-holds-barred, real-life world of Spiders, Scorpions, Centipedes and Killer Ants who fight to the death. It's a five-episode bug-eat-bug gladiatorial contest where stings, spikes and deadly venom are wielded with cold-blooded precision. Filmed in super close-up high definition and illustrated with state-of-the-art CGI, Monster Bug Wars brings to life nature's ultimate fight club-five encounters per episode-with expert commentary from Cornell University's eminent entomologist, Dr Linda Rayor, and "Professor Poison", Dr Bryan Grieg Fry from The University of Queensland.




3)  Quick and the Deadly 
When the speedy House Centipede meets a brave and cunning Swift Tree Mantid, a 'Snatch and Bite' showdown is assured. And who'll be left standing when the Whistling Tarantula encounters a fierce Bulldog Raspy Cricket? The Ogre-Faced Spider hunts with a tricky silk 'fishing net' and it's now scheming to use it to catch a stealthy Assassin Bug. Will it succeed? When the venom-packed Marbled Scorpion meets the pumped-up Trap-Jaw Ant, it's sting versus sting and deadly claws against super-fast jaws. And who will survive when the strangely armed Spitting Spider comes face-to-face with the sharp-eyed Metallic-Green Jumping Spider?
