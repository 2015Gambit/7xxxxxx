"Betty Rats, a roots revival band from Nashville, TN, plays an off-kilter style of electric folk that contains elements of jug band and gypsy music. They embrace a back-to-basics approach to recording and performing live that features stripped-down instrumentation and production techniques. This method allows them to incorporate aspects of improvisation and spontaneous expression into most every performance, either live or recorded.

Lyrical themes often border on the abstract or darkly satirical, as represented in colorful songs like "Diner Dionysus," "Electroencephalogram," and "Escape from the Nursing Home." They claim to draw much of their inspirationΓÇömetaphorically or otherwiseΓÇöfrom a pink plastic cup, which they've affectionately christened "Pink Water."

Betty Rats has played over 60 shows in the past two years including two tours of the East Coast and the Midwest. They recorded and released an eight-song self-titled EP in June of 2007. And their debut full length Squeaks Tall Reeds was released by For the Philistine Records on September 27th 2008."
