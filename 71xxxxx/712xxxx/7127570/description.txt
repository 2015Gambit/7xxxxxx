Wildlife documentary. Six feet tall, 13 stone, and armed with five-inch claws, 
cassowaries are birds that deserve respect. So when a cyclone forced dozens of 
cassowaries out of Australian rainforests and into towns, there was bound to be 
trouble. This film follows the dramatic attempts to save these endangered giant 
birds, and reveals their fascinating natural history for the first time.

Narrated by David Attenborough
