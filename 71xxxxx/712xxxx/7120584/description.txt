2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

For those keeping track, we're now up from 154 to 188 Christian titles released in 2012 with this 7th torrent bundle which includes 34 more titles today.  As with all my other torrents, once this becomes fully seeded, I will no longer be able to support the torrent.  So if you download this today, please consider holding onto, and sharing it back a little longer than you might otherwise would.

A special note of thanks to zarkann1 who recently posted "Such a great compilation! Moriah Peters song is giving me goose bumps" in one of my other threads.  That's exactly why I devote so much of my time and energy to sharing this type of music.  In hopes that it will become a blessing in someone's life, and God becomes rightfully glorified through it.
