 I really enjoy your comic uploads and wanted to say thanks.  Do u know where i would be able to find New Avengers #23? Thanks again"
[T],MrDowntown,2012-03-24T21:34Z,You have 50 PAGES of torrents - You ever stop and think about that ...craziness. :D
,captinkill,2012-03-25T18:10Z,"Mr. Downtown, I also enjoy your uploads, I am aware of the amount of pages there are, thank you sir for pointing out the obvious. I was just looking for the Master to UL New Avengers # 23 (because there is no torrent for it atm) at the same time thanking him in a polite way for helping the community. 
bitchness....."
,PirateNinja222,2012-09-23T11:25Z,"captinkill, how high did you get before you typed out that second message? MrDowntown is in no way talking about you or your comment or whatever you think happened, he was marveling in the greatness and generosity of 50 pages of torrents, which is quite an astounding number. 
Once again mirrormaster82, great upload!"
