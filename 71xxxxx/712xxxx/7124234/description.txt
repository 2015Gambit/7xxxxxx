 Jonathan Maitland reports on claims that some local authorities across England are 
 putting up fees for a range of services - from library fines to car parking and 
 social care. Councils say they have no choice but to increase charges for a number 
 of services and blame cuts by the Government, which has accused them of using the 
 public as a cash cow.
                                        
                                 Enjoy!
