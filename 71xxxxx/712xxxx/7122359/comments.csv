I have some more Genesis laserdiscs I will capture in the next week or so, stay tuned! I'd also like to hear comments or complaints about the quality.

The other Genesis LDs i have are Mama Tour (1984), In Concert 1976 (japanese import, this one cost me $120), Invisible Touch Tour (1987), and The Way We Walk Live (1992).

Three Sides Live has the worst video quality of the bunch. I imagine there isn't a big demand for the 1987 and 1992 laserdisc rips since they have been officially released on DVD, but let me know if you want them anyway."
