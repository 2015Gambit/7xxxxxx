Genesis - Three Sides Live (1981)

Length: 84 minutes, 33 seconds
Resolution: 720x480
Frame rate: 29.970
Video: MPEG-4, near 5000 kbps
Audio: 48 KHz, 16-bit stereo (PCM uncompressed)

This is the full NTSC laserdisc transferred to an MPEG-4 AVI. I didn't use any of those crap newer video capture cards that have onboard MPEG-2 encoding, I used an older Hauppauge WinTV with the bt878 chip so the actual recording from the laserdisc output to the computer hard drive was uncompressed. (Actually lossless compression, HuffYUV - would have loved to upload that but it's 50 GB)

Anyway, I've got the full laserdisc in this AVI in very high quality. The video has been left alone. I even preserve the original NTSC interlace. If it bugs you, just turn on de-interlace on playback in VLC or whatever you use. I preferred to keep it looking the same as the source.

The audio has been EQ'd very carefully, the original audio is a little flat. The original recording quality in general wasn't anything special. This was 1981!

The laserdisc player I used is a Pioneer LD-V2200. Here are some screenshots:
