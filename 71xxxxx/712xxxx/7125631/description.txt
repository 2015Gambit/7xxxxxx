This is a very interesting series from the BBC which suggests that the idea of
the "old battleaxe" may be true and there may be no fun in growing old as 
British for some godforsaken reason!

Hogwash I say! There are often no nicer people to meet or have an intelligent chat
with about anything under the sun. So why not find a script to do em justice with?

Too much bitterness showing here to be justified as a showpiece centrally I say!

More seasons waiting to post

enjoy!
