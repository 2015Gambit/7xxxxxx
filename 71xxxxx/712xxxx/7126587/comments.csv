Last I heard is that program is a scam and has more viruses then anything else.

@ Boobsman
I love your uploads. Your'e the best. This looks like a great game. 

And for the rest this is an XGD3 game. Get an Ihas burner and Verbatim MKM-001 or 003 disc and burn this. "

AND before you burn make sure you run the iso thru ABGX on auto level 3 so it repairs the file. On my second pass Thru ABGX the ISO Passed no errors."
