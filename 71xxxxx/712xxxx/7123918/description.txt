Flight 666 documents the first leg of Maiden's legendary Somewhere Back In Time World Tour which took them 50,000 miles round the planet playing 23 concerts on five continents in just 45 days. One of the stars of the movie is the band's customised Boeing 757, Ed Force One, which carried the band, all their crew, 12 tons of stage equipment and was piloted by airline captain and singer Bruce Dickinson. The movie gives a close up behind the scenes look at what happened on and off stage, when Maiden gave full access to a film crew for the first time ever, and contains some of the most spectacular live footage yet seen of Maiden. If you want to know what it is like to be part of the most adventurous tour in rock history, you can't miss seeing this. Taking you from Mumbai to Santiago, LA to Sydney, Tokyo to Sao Paulo and all points betweem, through exhaustion and fan pandemonium, travelling with the band and crew on the plane, to and from shows, in the bar and during leisure time, this really is Access All Areas!
