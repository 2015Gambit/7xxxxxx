Every Which Way But Loose [1978]

Philo Beddoe is an easy-going trucker and a great fist-fighter. With two friends
- Orville, who promotes prize-fights for him, and Clyde, the orangutan he won on
a bet - he roams the San Fernando Valley in search of cold beer, country music
and the occasional punch-up. But he is floored himself by a dainty little country
and western singer, who gives him the slip when she realizes he's getting too
serious. Phil, Clyde and Orville set off in pursuit, pestered by bikers.
