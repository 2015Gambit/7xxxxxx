,mutineer,2012-03-24T13:36Z,"Thanks for all the hard work Brother.
Us here in North America have a rough time watching F1 Qually and Races, and can forget watching the FP Sessions unless we depend on our UK F1 Brothers. 
I know how much time and effort go in to this so THANKS.
And good job on the commercial cuts, you almost get the music sync dead on when you cut back in..
Cheers."
