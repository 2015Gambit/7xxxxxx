Wildlife documentary. A tale of life on the Zambezi River, set against the epic
backdrop of Victoria Falls. The story is told from the point of view of a local
fisherman, Mr White, who has fished these waters for 69 years, and whose riverside

of these animals through his eyes, and learn how their lives are ruled by the 
moods of the river and the rains.
