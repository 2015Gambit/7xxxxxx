,marduk191,2012-03-23T20:23Z,The Beta comes with 64 and 32 bit versions. Is there a patch for this so we don't have to activate online or  anything? 
,TJBab,2012-03-24T03:49Z,is this legit or fake??cos i need it real fast
,tnmysoft,2012-03-24T05:34Z,"This is Legit and it works


It doesn't need any patch or serial
You can freely activate over the internet
It has a time-limit because it is the beta version

,Gdowson,2012-03-25T14:37Z,"If I understand Adobe correctly, the time limit for the Beta is 7 days, expandable to a longer time if you use their free activation. However, there can be no activation unless your computer is allowed to communicate with Adobe. 

The terms state that the program may check the serial number of ""adobe software"" on your computer. This may mean that any non-legit Adobe software will suddenly be flagged and will not start up. 

So until there is a crack for the Beta (not the Pre-Release, which is different), I think you can use CS6 only for seven days. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

And if there is a workaround, please let me know!"
,TJBab,2012-03-25T15:35Z,trusting on ya guys i'm downloading the thing...am at 94%...will be done on about an hour....will keep u posted if it works or not
,TJBab,2012-03-25T18:21Z,it worked...but as it's a trial I have only 60 days of it's fun...i'm hoping that there will be a crack for it in between 60 days
,Gdowson,2012-03-26T00:35Z,"""it worked...but as it's a trial I have only 60 days of it's fun""

Yeah, but you get that 60 days only if you allow the program to communicate with Adobe via the internet. And if you do THAT, then the program will apparently snitch on the legitimacy of any other Adobe software that may or may not be on your system.

I simply think people ought to be aware of that fact going in."
,tnmysoft,2012-03-26T06:29Z,"You r right @gdowson i will try in the forthcoming week if i can find a crack or it disables the other patched softwares


So enjoy the days"
,TJBab,2012-03-26T10:06Z,please let us know if u have a crack for it...
,iMars666,2012-03-30T04:11Z,"Give it a few weeks and TheThingy will have a cracked full release..

Do not download this if you are running Cracked/Patched version of other Adobe Software.

I tried to install this along side CS5.5 and when I went to open its, it closed itself, gave an error about an invalid Serial. Had to reinstall every Adobe software I have."
,po0ibum,2012-03-31T23:58Z,i think i might just wait until there is a crack if its only a trail
,Gdowson,2012-04-01T09:19Z,"Y'know, if you really wanted to try CS6 right now, but you're worried about other Adobe software on your system, you could try this:

1. Take EVERYTHING Adobe off your system.

2. Blank out your Hosts file. (Obviously, you should first make copy of the file.) Search around and you'll see how to change this file.

3. Go through official Adobe channels to download Photoshop CS6, gain an Adobe ID, and activate. You'll have the program for 60 days. Once you are activated, the program need no longer needs any internet link.

4. Put your Hosts file back the way it was -- meaning, make sure that there's a huge ""do not call"" list. This is to prevent your computer from talking to Adobe. (Again, use Google to find outl what your Hosts file should look like.)

5. Re-install all of your old Adobe software and plug-ins. The whole process will take, I dunno, maybe four hours, maybe longer.

You COULD do it that way, if you really need to try Photoshop CS6 right now but you also want to use (say) an older copy of Dreamweaver which you acquired a couple of years ago after it fell off a truck.
