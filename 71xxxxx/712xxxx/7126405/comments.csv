KK, I'm looking for some Rachel Caine. I have the Weather series and the first 8 of the Morganville Vampires. Wondering if you have any of the latest Morganville books 8-12. 

TIA either way. You're the best.  "

,littlekt,2012-04-30T01:10Z,"Thanks so much!! Can you get Life as We Knew It, The Dead and the Gone, This World We Live In (The Last Survivors Trilogy) by Susan Beth Pfeffer?  They are supposed to be a great read for people that liked Hunger Games.  Thanks!  "
