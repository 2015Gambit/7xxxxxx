Copy these into google and click on the bitsnoop link you get in the results. I haven't checked to see if there's people seeding them, though."
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-03-30T10:21Z,Season 5 uploaded here (tpb) is shit quality for the size it is (31gigs). Season 7 isn't here.
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-03-30T11:44Z,Oh and if anyone feels it's too much trouble to switch from Belgian audio to English each time; you can get rid of the Belgian audio entirely using mkvmerge. It's a fairly quick process. And you lose around 700mb also! 
,prax83,2012-03-31T07:07Z,Excellent quality within 14GB... cool man...keep the nice work....Is there any tiny possibility to upload season 4 and 5 with your style...I dint like the GEM rip with 30GB size...Let me know many thanks
,prax83,2012-03-31T07:12Z,Got Season 05 and 07 from bitsnoop...thx....waiting for season 04 720 WS
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-03-31T07:51Z,"I just uploaded the torrent here. These aren't exactly my rips. And I've been looking for the s4 release of whoever's released season 5, 6, 7 myself but seems it's not around, unfortunately. I'll upload the torrent here if I ever stumbled upon it. "
,w000ter,2012-03-31T09:57Z,sweet thanks for the hashes dude!
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-03-31T12:07Z,You're welcome. Glad to share.
,mmuussttii2009,2012-07-12T23:00Z,this is not in english! ?
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-07-13T08:25Z,@above: You have to switch to the second audio track; that one's English.
