[V],{C_P},2012-03-24T22:07Z,Episode 103 had broadcasting error in it. So we have to wait for it to reair.
,Dragen,2012-03-24T23:31Z,"The aspect ratio is wrong, should be 16:9. It's something else.
 Video is zoomed, lots of picture is missing.

 DO NOT GET!"
,morpheusxnyc,2012-03-25T04:01Z,"Ignore ""Dragen""'s comment. 

This is Episode 4, which is not even supposed to be out yet, given that Ep 3 JUST aired yesterday.

You can wait another week for the perfect copy or watch this less than perfect one a eek in advance. 
Your call."
,darkscale,2012-03-25T10:54Z,@morpheusxync: wrong: I already dl 103 last week in good a/v WS format. 
,Dragen,2012-03-25T14:54Z,"The show airs in 720p, morpheusxnyc, so it's clearly obvious that the guy capping this is making bad releases on purpose.

Also, 101-2 aired many months ago, 103 aired last week."
