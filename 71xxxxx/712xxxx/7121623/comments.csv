,Kole97,2012-03-22T07:55Z,"“Bent” follows Alex (Amanda Peet) and Pete (David Walton), two couples who find themselves attracted to each other’s traits that would normally derail them from moving forward. Alex is a divorcee who works as a lawyer. She and her 8-year-old daughter Charlie (Joey King) live together trying to save money by moving into a smaller home. When she hires Pete as a contractor to remodel her kitchen,they share a connection that is attractive to both of them. Alex takes his recovering gambling addict and unapologetic womanizer things as a way of helping whereas he is not afraid to call out her flaws either."
