,Kaufs,2012-03-23T19:51Z,"@blaze69 I had the same distortion with VLC player, but not with Divx Plus player.

Seems the new version of VLC is fucked up...
I have the same problem with some other movies.

Hope this helped"

[V],blaze69,2012-03-24T05:05Z,"First off Thanks For The Info > Kaufs

Yes Very True,, It's VLC Fault

Media Player Classics Play Just Fine. Sorry For Misjudging The Torrent Quality

Updated VLC to 2.0.1.. Same Issue
These Guys Gotta get there shit In Order ,, all these Years Of Updates and Still can't have a stable release To Support New Mp4 Encoded Torrents :(

Again Thanks For The Heads Up kaufs :)
