Any Chance you could maybe post what movies your planing on doing just so we know more of a curiosity thing then anything if not no prob just nice to know whats upcoming 
THANKS"
[T],tr108,2012-03-28T01:48Z,"mamun777- glad things are working out for you. 

To tag my movies, I use Subler (http://code.google.com/p/subler/) which, in case it matters, is Mac-only."
[T],tr108,2012-03-28T02:07Z,"ScubaSteve- I can understand the curiosity. :)

Things in my queue for when I'm back home, mainly bc I wanna reencode in 1080p:

Most def (over the next 2-3 months):
-Kung Fu Panda 2
-The Matrix Trilogy
-Avatar (Collector's Edition)
-The Star Wars saga
-All Pixar films (except Finding Nemo)
-Batman Begins/The Dark Knight
-The Lord of the Rings (Extended)

Maybe (3-4 months?):
