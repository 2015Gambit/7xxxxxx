here is lego star wars 3
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7109170/LEGO_Star_Wars_3__The_Clone_Wars___-___Fixed_for_Mac
I'm not sure if thats the right one though, search ""star wars mac"" and you will find it. Empire at war is also there, if you are talking about star wars empire at war"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-03-25T04:48Z,"SEED EVERYONE, I'm running out of internet usage. there is already a DIRT 2 on TPB so don't worry.
and its mkdhdh's lucky day because i found company of heroes"
,grafkaal,2012-03-26T16:34Z,"Is anyone going to seed this? Now down to 1 seeder!

,teh-cheeseman,2012-03-30T09:12Z,"It is company of heroes tales of valor, though, its still mac native but not the one on app store. Is it still ok?"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-03-30T09:16Z,"SEED, SEED.
 STOP HITTING AND RUNNING, AT THIS RATE I AM GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A NEW TORRENT"
,mkdhdh,2012-03-31T10:30Z,@teh cheeseman  as long as it has shootin it's fine with me  but is it powerpc? cause i'm runnin lion
,mkdhdh,2012-03-31T10:31Z,seeeeddddd!
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-01T09:17Z,I don't think it is power pc. you control the soldiers from above. look up COH Tales Of Valor gameplay on youtube. its not first person shooter like for example Call of Duty
,mkdhdh,2012-04-01T18:05Z,"@teh-cheeseman   yes, i know :) but it still is a war game :) but please upload it i want to play it :)"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-23T05:40Z,Coh tales of valor is up
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-27T14:50Z,This Torrent is FIXED NOW SEEDING
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-27T15:00Z,"OK I Trolled and Lurked around the great expanse of the internet 
and found there was a tracker problem, it will work now"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-28T04:19Z,"wait, no doesnt seem to be. wait, will post agiin when fixed"
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-28T08:30Z,OK IT IS WORKING NOW you can download
,mycophage,2012-05-01T20:50Z,"Torrent works fine, but the game itself is difficult to configure without a three-button mouse: there's a ""hold right click, then left-click"" maneuver that is impossibly to perform on a trackpad or a single-button mouse, even with the use of command keys. 

Alternate keymapping doesn't seem to work. If anyone solves this to their satisfaction, please let us know how you did it!"
,totimomo,2012-05-27T11:34Z,upload dirt 2 :D
