[V],globeplus,2012-03-21T17:04Z,"Hi and this is the file report :

For more unbalievable that it looks only 80 mb less than on the original iso that had 1.59 Gb , after the work it was possible only 1.51 Gb , this game is in pkg archive that have a kind of an encrypted structure and because of that it is about 150 to 200 mb more after the compression , what wasn´t bad for this file was the 7zip compression that even with the pkg archive inconvenience compressed more than 50% of the iso giving a final 708 Mb for download  but i repeat if it wasn´t for the pkg archive structure probably the 7zip compression gived a very positive final size between 500 to 550 mb but well , independtly of this still a final positive size for a possible quality rip compression ...

Happy game to all of you ."

,Haru-chan,2012-03-31T08:04Z,Yeah....No. I remember downloading the game crisis core from someone with the same size file. The game would play until you got to the end... so while I'm here download my copy of the game instead and help seed it. It is the full uncompressed iso and is a strait disk rip.
