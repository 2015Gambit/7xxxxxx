Martin Bohm, a widower and single father trying to connect with his mute 11-year-old son Jake, is led to a pawn shop where a robbery triggers a sequence of unpredictable events that connect a distraught flight attendant in New York, a son visiting from India on a mission to spread his father's ashes, a middle school magician in Moscow, a cancer patient in New York and a mobster in the Bronx. It's up to Jake and Martin to link the thread between them all.
