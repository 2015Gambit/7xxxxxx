Christian Torrents IRC

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a way of communicating in real time with people from around the world. It consists of separate networks of IRC servers, the largest being EFnet (the original IRC net) often serving more than 50,000 people at one time. 

To participate in the chat you need an IRC client. This is a portable version of Miranda IM which is ready to connect to the #ChristianTorrents IRC channel.

Miranda IM is an open-source, customizable, multi protocol, instant messenger client for Microsoft Windows. Features include support for AIM, Jabber, ICQ, MSN, Gadu-Gadu, Yahoo! and more. 

Another impressive feature included in this custom build is "Anna" the A.L.I.C.E (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity) bot that you can set to "Autochat everybody" or "Autochat everybody while away". You can customize the "personality" of the bot to suit your particular needs by modifying the aiml files.
