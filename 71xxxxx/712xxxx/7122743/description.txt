The cascading, sequential chords of "Domerocker" are a favourite trick of Tejada's; one which he's frequently used in ascending varieties as well. Its bell-like tones remain the focus by dint of no-nonsense percussion.

There's little time wasted on clever syncopation, with a muffled kick and skipping hats providing a simple rhythm. Though it employs similar percussion, "Our Aimless Dance" is a little more complex, using a nifty glitch effect to squeeze extra interest out of the upper frequencies. At times, this results in a tortured, 303-like squeal, sans the liquid feel. Nonetheless, the track title is the important part. This is a track that seems to perfectly capture that woozy 9 AM dance where Sunday still seems to stretch infinitely ahead.

Meanwhile, "The Friction of the Day" downsizes the lead in order to accomodate wavering pads. It's strangely dichotomous, the lead a searing pulse and the rest soft and cuddly. This time the hook has a circular quality, rolling endlessly along and mutating as it goes. The only remix of the package comes from Germany's Roland M. Dill, who manages to transform "Domerocker" from serene to savage (relatively speaking). Something cowbell-ish and a sharp off-beat twangΓÇöhence the name "Twangbang"ΓÇöset up the rhythm, while Tejada's original chords have been roughed up a bit. It also shows more regard for the dance floor, using big, fuzzy synths to shift through gentle peaks and troughs.
