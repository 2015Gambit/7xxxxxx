A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE by Oscar Wilde
Adapted and Diected by Adrian Bean
=============================================



Diana Rigg, Martin Jarvis and Annette Crosby star in Oscar Wilde's tale of social scandal.

A Woman of No Importance primarily focuses on the differences between men and women and, more importantly, the way in which Victorian society treated its ladies. Wilde shows feminist leanings as he attacks the injustice of a society that condemns a "fallen" woman while admiring the cause of her downfall. A Woman of No Importance is a great reminder of how good Oscar Wilde is. He writes beautifully in both comic and (sometimes melo) dramatic mode and his main characters are memorable.
