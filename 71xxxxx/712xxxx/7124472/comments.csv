I'm Actually new to android...How to install ?"
,bizzybody,2012-03-27T11:26Z,"First you need to see if your phone supports non-market apps. Menu, Settings, Applications. Check the Unknown sources box.

Don't have that box? Do a Google for sideload wonder machine.

If your phone has an SD card it most likely supports mounting it as a USB Mass Storage device to a computer. Do that and copy the APK to the card in the phone. Eject/safely remove the phone.

Now you need a file manager on the phone. Get one from the Market (I'm ignoring the stupid new Play Store name) like File Expert or Astro.

Use that to find the APK, those file manager have the ability to install apps.

An app this big, you'll want to move it to your SD card if you have one."

I trust BONE obviously, but we can all be fooled."
