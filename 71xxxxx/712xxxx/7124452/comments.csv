,WHIPCRACKER,2012-03-29T16:36Z,"Looked through your list

Colossus Of Rhodes would be great at some time.

Cimmaron would be good too.

If you know of someone with Land of the Pharoahs---that would be a real Bonus.

THANKS----great collection"

,1diamante,2012-06-16T16:36Z,"Wow, this is awesome. Thank you so much for uploading these marvelous movies. You are INCREDIBLY generous!!
Hate to bug you but I see you have a few Vittorio De Sica ones and I've been trying to get hold of Il tetto (The Roof) for so long now... (My bf's grandparents saw it at the cinema! and they want to see it again). If you maybe know where I could get it, I would much appreciate if you pointed me in the right direction.
THANKS A MILLION, AUGE!!!"
