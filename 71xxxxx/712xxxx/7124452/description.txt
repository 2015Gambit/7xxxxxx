Ok, most folks wonΓÇÖt care about this but for those of you that do this is a complete list of all of my DVDs as of today.
I have not included non DVD files such as AVIs and the like; this is strictly a list of my DVDs.
You can use this to make requests but you should know that I will put what is considered ΓÇ£importantΓÇ¥ films at the front of the line.
I also expect way to many requests to keep track of, I will do my best.

I am ripping all of these to ISO and putting them onto a 16 terabyte Drobo media server and thought I would take the opportunity to share.
