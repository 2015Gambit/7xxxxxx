,vandrews,2012-03-26T15:15Z,"Hi,

Thanks for uploading this version of Amiga Forever.

I am having a problem with the extraction. I use WinRar and have unrarred the camgf2012200 file and inside the folder it created i can see the files ciax0001.001 to ciax0001.041 along wite the .sfv and the file crdiso.

Like always i right click on the .001 to get a menu with the usual rar cammands, but for some reason i am not able to unrar the files like i would normally do to create the iso file ready for burning.

The icons for the files are just blank like a notepad icon. Any help would sure be apriciated.

Thanks"
[T],mdusanjay,2012-03-26T19:04Z,"@vandrews
rather than right clicking the .001 file..open the winrar from the start menu..and in its address bar browse to the folder where u have extracted the .001 files.now double click it and u can c the iso image file..just extract it and burn or mount the image.."
