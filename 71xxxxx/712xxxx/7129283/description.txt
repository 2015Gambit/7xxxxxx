Amiga Forever is the award-winning Amiga emulator, preservation and support package brought to you by Cloanto, Amiga developers since 1986. Have you ever wondered what Workbench 1.0 looked like, or how the most influential personal computing magazine of the 1980s introduced the Amiga to the world? Would you (or a colleague) be surprised if you saw your PC booting as an Amiga, instead of Windows?
