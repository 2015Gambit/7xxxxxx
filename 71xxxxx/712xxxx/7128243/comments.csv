,UKGuy64,2012-03-25T18:28Z,Does this work on steam install version of RW3?
,bomofoo,2012-03-25T22:08Z,This is missing the route files the only files in the contentroutes folder is the scenarios folder. now if you have the old route installed it will work but most of the lights don't work. If you don't have the old route installed this will not work. I have tried to reinstall twice and same thing both times no route files.
,bones2904,2012-03-26T02:11Z,"Same here ,  No route files, have installed twice."
,UKGuy64,2012-03-26T07:54Z,"This probably won't work if you are trying to install it to RW3 if it's installed with steam, some of the stuff on here does and some doesn't!"
,captkilljoy,2012-03-26T15:03Z,Well mine is installed with a skidrow version of railworks and the files are still missing.
,UKGuy64,2012-03-26T16:04Z,The truth is you can't really complain since you ain't paid for it!  
,bomofoo,2012-03-26T16:16Z,Pretty sure no one is complaining just stating the fact that files are missing and without them the route really isn't updated.
,Thootje17,2012-03-26T16:27Z,Well it works fine for me.. have you tried clearing the blueprints cache?
,mrantcorr,2012-03-26T18:19Z,I copied the contents apart from the scenario from the old Edinburgh to Glasgow route and put them in content and the same file in content and then it worked it didn't work before i did that
,UKGuy64,2012-03-26T19:09Z,"so will it work on the steam installed RW3, I would guess not, unless someone can tell me otherwise?"
,CCALLUMM,2012-03-26T20:11Z,"thanks for this.

And just to clarify theres no missing files whatsoever."
,tpb_4_ever,2012-03-26T20:14Z,"I'll sort it out, no worries"
,Thootje17,2012-03-26T20:50Z,"I think you guys are just doing something wrong, there is nothing missing at all.."
,bomofoo,2012-03-26T21:49Z,"OK I want to get this right also to all the people that are saying that there are no missing files, here is a link to a forum with pics of the legit copy. http://forums.uktrainsim.com/viewtopic.php?f=302&t=123915
If yours looks like that then I am doing something wrong but I don't think I am."
,bomofoo,2012-03-26T22:04Z,"Another thing to try is find this folder in your Content, Route folder.  ffc02253-25f0-40a6-9759-2c142c8fff56 cut and paste that to your desk top reinstall the updated route and try to run something."
,tpb_4_ever,2012-03-26T23:44Z,"Download this torrent and it should fix all the problems. Message me if you have other problems.

,mrantcorr,2012-03-27T00:17Z,Hey tpb_4_ever are you also getting the East Coast Express route aswell from creative rail?
,bones2904,2012-03-27T08:21Z,"Works fine with the previous version installed initially,  tks tpb_4_ever"
,sharp09,2012-03-27T14:18Z,"Can someone please tell me how too install this because the file is not .rwp or .rpk!

Thanks"
