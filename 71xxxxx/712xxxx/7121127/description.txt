                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Four Rooms sees four of the country's top dealers in art, antiques and 
 collectibles waiting in four different rooms, each prepared to spend their own 
 money if the right item comes through their door. Members of the public show up 
 with their prized possessions for sale hoping to walk away with a life-changing 
 amount of money. They need to decide when to sell and when to see the next dealer,
 because once they leave the room they offer is gone for ever. 
                         
                                 Enjoy!
