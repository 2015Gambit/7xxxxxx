,Annoyme,2012-03-22T21:36Z,"After spending the morning and 5 hours of the afternoon in hospital nervously waiting, my Dad is  out of surgery/recovery, and in his room, under sedation.

The most risk was being under anesthesia or bleeding internally during surgery. Now he just has to eat hospital food for 7 to 10 days. (which to be honest is waaay better than his own cooking :)

Life is a lot less bleak right now. The last week has been depression squared. Time to start enjoying LIFE."
,Annoyme,2012-03-22T21:45Z,"Oh, and lets give thanks to Reagan80 for helping me get the show up and seeded the last week on days I was delayed at the hospital.

Pretty good for a Canadian, HAH!
(send us some of that abundant oil, Reagan)"
,Reagan80,2012-03-22T22:08Z,"send YOU oil? It ain't free here, bro.

and no thanks needed my brother!

Pleasure to give back after years as a taker."
,charlietexas,2012-03-22T23:11Z,thanks from costa rica.
,tainan2u,2012-03-22T23:19Z,"Annoyme - Thanks and best to your Father and You. I went through it a few years back. Lots of worry. I understand what you mean about the ""cooking."" Be careful of stoves left 'on.'

Thanks also to Reagan80 - Good work.

All the best."

Not bad."
,tainan2u,2012-03-22T23:20Z,"Reagan80 - 
I guess that should have been - ""Good work, eh?""

... ;)"
,Arsventure,2012-03-23T00:09Z,"Best to you and your Dad!

I know all too well how difficult what you are going through is.

God bless."
