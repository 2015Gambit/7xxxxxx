,trendelenburg,2012-03-27T19:29Z,you can choose the map that you want. BUT keep in mind to download the patch too
,deadspac3,2012-03-27T19:35Z,"yea i know its just that utorrent doesnt like to let me select which files i want from magnet links and going through individually after the download started was a pain, just figured it would be nice.

also thanks MacrosVS tom tom recently fucked some shit up on my XL350 and its being detected as a tomtom one which keeps me from getting the lifetime updates... after 5 days of emailing them back and forwards im done dealing with it."
,trendelenburg,2012-03-27T20:03Z,"@deadspac3
I have XL 335se with North America 2Gb
will I face problems using those maps ?"
,deadspac3,2012-03-27T20:12Z,"@trendelenburg 
no these maps didnt cause the issue... i read on a forum someone had the same problem as me and it turned out the device was defective or thats wat tom tom was claiming it as... so u shouldnt have to worry"
,MarcosVS,2012-03-27T20:41Z,"@trendelenburg
Use the program FastActivate.exe to unlock ( patch ) your TomTom device.
If it is already unlocked just copy the map and run the program AutoActivate.exe"

,kendra_x,2012-04-16T15:10Z,"Hi everybody :) I know people get angry and annoyed with beginners... but a girl has got to learn right? I'd hate to sound like a complete idiot but in my case I'd like to use the united states map (either one) for my tomtom one iq routse s model 130. I go to my computer, click drive e, and see there is a map folder with a .tlv file and then outside of the map folder i see theres a complketely different folder labeled my current map name. Do i just delete the foler labeled my current map and replace it with one from this torrent? Is there another .tlv file inside these maps i just dont know about? Does this go into the root or the maps folder. Fast activator looks easy enough but id love a quick dummies guide please. This is saving me 90 bucks from buying a new gps with lifetime updates. thank you thank you thank youuu "
,kendra_x,2012-04-16T15:14Z,Could someone please list a steo by step guide on how to do this properly? I'm so frustrated :X thank youuu
,kendra_x,2012-04-16T16:10Z,"Yay i figured it out. i had to delete my current maps folder with the tlv file, delete my other folder that said the name of my current map. then i simply copied the one out of this torrent i wanted, placed it in the root of my tomtom one, put the fast activate in that folder and ran that as well as easy activate just to be safe! Does anyone know if there a fuel prices usa torrent?"

I have a friend's TomTom Go 720 and I downloaded all Australian files for him as that is all he needs. I also downloaded autoactivate, fastactivate, meta and help. I copied fastactivate to tomtom and updated meta, clicked maps, and ttsystem. I plugged it out and it still had the same maps. I turned it off and its not turning back on. reset isnt working?"
