SOURCES:

AUDIO -  HOPE - FURY THANKS
SUBS  - None Add



NOTES:

Ok heres our take ....the video was ok but missing around 10-12 secs in total in several different
parts with the biggest gap being a 4 sec jump.The video like most russian cams have the rainbow effect,cropped,
contrast and colours levels off etc....
Audio was cam audio which was ok ,nothing special,had 3 audio drops and missing last 2mins 51 secs.

Fixed the video up the best we could using HQ smoother,resize,contrast,brightness,hue,intest and finally some sharpen.
Audio was a pita too sync but go there in the end lol.
23 cuts in total due video missing here and there and some slight video glitches ( on source file not from encoding ).
What i have tried too do on the drops is delay the audio so it flows and for the ending i took the audio off the original
russian audio track as it was just singing and no talking so there was no russian in it
