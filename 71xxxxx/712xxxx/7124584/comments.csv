Is there any chance you can upload episode 5 and 6?

It'd be appreciated."
,the_lopan,2012-03-24T05:27Z,"Thanks a lot FQM!

The audio is distorted / clipped. But it's better than nothing. ORENJI's release has bad audio too, it isn't distorted but there's loud hum AND hiss.

,the_lopan,2012-03-24T05:32Z,"I'd love if you uploaded episode 5 (Larry David).
I can't find it anywhere.

@DTake2012
you can find episode 6 here @bitsnoop dot com"
,Seanimoose,2012-03-24T20:55Z,"I'm also desperately searching for episode 5 - Larry David.

Cannot be found anywhere online! (including private sites).

We'll probably have to wait for showcase to re-air it."
,Lonsman,2012-03-25T08:20Z,"Thanks very much. Ya, we're all looking for 5...and 6."
