This transatlantic collaboration features the long-established partnership of
Swiss sticksman Daniel Humair and German pianist Joachim K ühn, but the
presence of saxophonist Tony Malaby further establishes the latter's
fast-ascending status outside of the US. The reedman isn't blowing as
belligerently as usual, tempted into exposing his softer side, his warm tone
denuded of its lime-scale textures.

The material is clearly composed, but in such a manner that much of the trio's
interaction sounds completely improvised (there are pieces penned by each
member). The language of the spontaneous is becoming so advanced (or even
ingrained) that it's becoming increasingly difficult to discern the moment when
one form flows into the other. The disc's opening skirmish reveals all three
players in a swiftly overlapping state and then Humair takes a drum solo,
followed by more trio flooding and then, in the name of symmetry, a piano
solo. Humair's skins are tonally rich down at the low end, helping fill in any
absence felt (imagined or not) by the absence of a bassist.

All three are constantly restless and enquiring, continually seeking
satisfaction, with themes and solos smudging into each other in a blur of
hyperactivity. On the title track, K ühn takes off on a crazed scamper, with
Malaby entering at what turns out to be the piece's peak, acting as a closing
force. Then "Ghisl ène" is a staccato head-banger, with complete equality for
all three players, as they intuitively negotiate outbursts of either dominance
or passivity, switching roles in an instant, energized, but also moving through
a varied range of dynamic stages.
