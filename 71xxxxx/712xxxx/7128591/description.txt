Propellerhead Reason5 / Incl.Serials

Reason is a virtual studio rack with all the tools and instruments you need to turn your ideas into music. With its generous sound bank and intuitive flow, Reason helps you along in the creative process and is the music software that never gets in your way.

Walk into any professional recording studio and you will see racks filled to the brim with different tools used in music production from reverb to compressors, vocoders, synths, distortion units, and parametric EQs. The studio's rack is the heart of its creative factory. Reason and Record are no different. That is why we have outfitted your computer with a virtual rack filled with all the same gear. They look and function exactly like their hardware cousins. Even better, they sound just as good too.

Unlike a real studio, however, if you want another synth or an extra compressor you can create one from a menu rather than taking that second job or signing up for those experimental clinical drug trials.


Do not whine if the serials are out of date! Put some effort in it your self! Cheers!

If you like it, then buy it!
