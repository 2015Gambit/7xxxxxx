,twijjit,2012-03-29T02:28Z,"Its not just you...I'm only up to 4:20 so far and its almost impossible to watch. A whole chunk was cut out at 4:15 (good part, too), and I'm getting those little random green squares I'm use to seeing on this ""new and improved"" codec. Okay to watch I guess, but not worth keeping, which I generally do."

,twijjit,2012-03-29T03:41Z,"Yep, its complete crap. Not even watchable. There were so many random chunks cut out, the whole thing totaled only 19 and a half minutes. The rest of them average about 22. And this's the same copy uploaded by TvTeam, which are the only two I've found so far on TPB."
