.. However, I just noticed something strange at exactly 17:00 into the movie - what appears to be the words ""freedom fighters"" spoken by David Carradine (Bill), have been censored! Beeped out, FFS!

Not your fault, YIFY, but I don't recall that little bit of stupidity in the original DVD. Perhaps it's a later edit by some idiot (probably DHS) in the production of the Bluray.

The fucking philistines that did this to the movie need to have their balls cut off, blended with sulfuric acid and fed to them via their noses.

Love your work YIFY. Thx."

The reason for the [beep] is that he is saying her name. It's a movie trick so we don't hear her name, which is mentioned later on in the movie.

Great rip thank you."
