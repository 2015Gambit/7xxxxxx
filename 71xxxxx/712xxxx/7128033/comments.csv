,shreddir,2012-03-24T20:17Z,"Hey VuDu4000, take it easy.  You already know this a low def version from the description and file size, so just wait for the HD versions to appear later like they usually do?  If you had bothered to do a torrent search on PirateBay you would've seen that Footy has also offered the HD version later because it takes more time to rip."
,SerSpec-V,2012-03-24T20:26Z,Hey VuDu4000 some of us don't need to watch EVERYTHING in 720p. Some people have download limits. Some people don't want to wait hours to download a 4GB file. If you hate it so bad then don't DL and shut the hell up dick head. Thanks footy! PS I am seeding HA HA.
,soryu,2012-03-24T20:48Z,"derp.




i'm waiting."
,mordokch,2012-03-25T12:00Z,Yeha stuff your 'HD' up your arse - this torrent is for us. If you want HD then fuckin well download hd - don't come running your mouth round here and complaining at the great job footy is doing.
,madh4tter,2012-03-25T16:27Z,Excellent quality many thanks to you good sir!
,mookymoo,2012-03-25T19:26Z,"@VuDu4000, why dont you STFU, if you love HD so much, why dont you rip the FUCKING THING THEN.

footy thanks for this rip, i grab the quali in sd and then the race in hd to burn to disc to watch later on. keep up the great work"
