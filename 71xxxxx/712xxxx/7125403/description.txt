GRACE CHURCH WITH PASTOR TROY DOBBS - 60 SERMONS
--------------------------------------------------------------

Trying something a little different today, outside of torrenting my usual Christian Music, this is a radio preaching ministry of Grace Church in Eden Prairie, Minnesota.  It features the verse-by-verse expository teaching of Pastor Troy Dobbs, Senior Pastor of Grace Church; an active and growing non-denominational congregation of over 4,000 members and attendees.

Troy is a dynamic expository teacher of God's Word, with a clear and easy-to-understand speaking style that resonates with people of all ages and stages of spiritual maturity.

Today's torrent contains 60 bible inspired sermons preached from 2010 through to 2012.  Each sermon is about 30 or so minutes long.  Details of all 60 topics can be found below...
