I took the files that came up as infected by my AV, and I threw them into a sandbox on a VM.  They opened up port 6667 and sat there listening, even after the infected host had exited...  Be cautious.  

Not all files are infected, but I've confirmed that the following files open up ports that they have no business opening:
DBZ - C13 Xmas
Foxy Bikini Babe
Hentaikey Girl 3
Mario - Peach Princess
Reiko 1
School Girl Sox
Uni"

,Bluexar,2012-09-06T17:34Z,"Don't download this torrent, alone the description shows that this is maleware

There is no animation or game at zone-archive that has to start as a executable."
