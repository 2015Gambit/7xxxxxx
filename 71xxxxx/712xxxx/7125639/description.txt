Triple bill of feature-length Disney animated adventures following Winnie the Pooh (voice of Jim Cummings) and his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood. 

 Winnie the Pooh (2011) Pooh finds a note from Christopher Robin (Jack Boulter) which leads the bear to believe his friend has been kidnapped by an elusive creature called the Backson. Joined by Piglet (Travis Oates), Tigger (Cummings), Eeyore (Bud Luckey) and the rest of the gang, Pooh sets out on a journey to save Christopher and on the way searches for honey and a new tail for Eeyore.

 In The Tigger Movie (2000) Tigger gets in the way when Pooh, Piglet (John Fiedler), Roo (Nikita Hopkins), Rabbit (Ken Sansom) and Owl (Andre Stojka) try to prepare a home for their doleful friend, Eeyore (Peter Cullen), so Pooh suggests that his ever-bouncing companion go outside and play with some other tiggers. Tigger thinks this a very foolish suggestion, as he is the only tigger in existence - or so he thinks. In fact, this proves to be the start of an exciting adventure in which Tigger discovers his long-lost family members.

Pooh, Piglet and Tigger set out to capture the beast, but Roo (Jimmy Bennett), who is told he's too small to join the search party, meets Lumpy the Heffalump (Kyle Stanger) face-to-face and discovers he's not the bad guy he's been made out to be
