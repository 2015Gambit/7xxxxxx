Monster Bug Wars
"Monster Bug Wars" takes you ringside to witness some of nature's deadliest encounters-where losers aren't just KO'd, they're eaten alive. This is the no-holds-barred, real-life world of Spiders, Scorpions, Centipedes and Killer Ants who fight to the death. It's a five-episode bug-eat-bug gladiatorial contest where stings, spikes and deadly venom are wielded with cold-blooded precision. Filmed in super close-up high definition and illustrated with state-of-the-art CGI, Monster Bug Wars brings to life nature's ultimate fight club-five encounters per episode-with expert commentary from Cornell University's eminent entomologist, Dr Linda Rayor, and "Professor Poison", Dr Bryan Grieg Fry from The University of Queensland.





4)  Shape Shifters 
When a cunning Tent Spider come to blows with a vicious Destructive Katydid, it's a battle between sticky silk, spiked legs and snapping jaws. And who'll be victorious when a huge Giant Banded Huntsman takes on the lean and mean Jungle Huntsman? The Rhinoceros Beetle has huge horns and heavy armour, but can it outwit a swarm of pesky Meat Ants with tiny jaws? When a Green Jumping Spider and a Long-Jawed Jumping Spider cross paths in the rainforest, one of these expert athletes will go down. And who will survive when the bold Grey Tree Runner Mantis encounters the stealthy Lichen Huntsman?
